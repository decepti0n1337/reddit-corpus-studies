How do you make your settings not reset? Mine keep defaulting :(

I dont but in glad to know others feel the same way.

Should be a survivor who has no face

How was the after game chat like tho?

---
Well worth drinking to. On me? 
---
Amazing how this wasn't seen as a problem in testing 
---
But which is it named after for this game? Kobe as in shooting a low percentage shot or kobe as in rare meat.
---
This is how 2/3 of Freddy matches end. 
---
I play killer 95% of the time and I go against people who gen rush the fuck out of me and know how to run every loop. But sometimes I do get those games where you 4 man 5 gen cause no one has any idea how to optimize
---
Both concepts mentioned in the title are amazing, they could do a “The thing” dlc and have R.J MacReady and The Thing. Morphing into other killers may be dicey tho
---
Well, keep in mind that despite what people say, rank matters to some extent. I dont have to try to win at rank 15, but at rank 1 i can get a little sweaty for that 4k. Overall though, their are just alot of incompetent killers.
---
This is the reason I stopped using my no mither build. I miss it but not the constant hurt music!
---
I escaped through the hatch in the bottom of the temple small room with two lockers. 
---
3rd guy hooked: I guide others to a treasure I cannot possess
---
*laughs in Freddy*
---
Hardest killer is nurse, spirit is one of the strongest, and is fairly easy once you get used to her.
---
I've seen the hatch once on this map just outside the temple on concrete floor by the walls. Have no other way to describe it lol 
---
So survivor is easy? Is that why there are no more red rank survivors yet all the killers are still ranks 1-3? Weird.
---
Bricky said Spirit is harder.
---
i love the addition of the totem at the top right and i dont know why 
---
 Because a lot of players aren't as good as they think they are
---
Sprint burst is actually a pretty terrible perk , you can't use it when you really need it. And forces people to walk around the map in order to not use it. 
---
They  might have a addon that gives their phantasms collision so you cant run through them. 
---
Its from a DLC for the game The Evil Within.
---
Myers went full apache on you

New Survivor Perk: **Jablin’ Jables.**
---
*When the Killer is within* **5m** *of you, complete a Skill Check to distract and assure the Killer that gaming videos are coming REAL soon. You’re just working out the kinks.*
---
You can use it in a chase, simply loop as long as you can safely, make your way to the shack/main structure available in EVERYMAP, hop through the window, then run down to the basement and get in a locker. It will take the killer longer than 3 seconds to get down to you due to having to go through the window or around through either side of the shack. Wait till they come close and smack them, it has a huge hitbox and is very forgiving.
---
That was not ds, that was some seriouse lag, or a lag switcher.
---
Exact thing happened to me last night. I dont play survivor alot and we were all rank 15. Got put against a rank 2 billy that downed someone in less than ten seconds.
---
Didn't see the subreddit just the title and meme.
---
For sure thought I was over at rdr2o and was thinking who the bell complained it was too easy to rank up?
---
Cool, I can’t even play nurse because she is literally unusable on console, but I’m gonna take the word of someone who plays *A LOT* of killer and is good at every killer except billy and has every killer at P3 level 50
---
disgusting way of doing an objective* oops sorry thanks for correcting my typo

---
People say a shapeshifter would be weak, but realistically, by the time you're asking your swf buddies that if that is "one of you," you've already struck most the time. A shapeshifter into a survivor I'd assume would lack a terror radius and that is automatically strong
---
The thing about morphing into survivors is that SWF is just has to say "Everyone tea-bag for a second" and if someone sees a survivor not do it then you know that is the killer. After they find out which killer it is then you just never go near another survivor as well. It's obviously not the killer if they are hooked and no other survivor should want to get near you either so if you see a survivor running towards you then you know that its the killer and not a survivor. There are just too many flaws in my opinion.
---
For every 10 games I play, 5 don't fucking load at all.
---
Of the 5 games that load, 3 have teammates that DC on the first down, 1 has a killer that DCs as soon as ruin is found, and it seems like only 1 out of every 10 fucking games keeps a full party which actually loads, it's so disheartening to play.
---
It certainly sucks!
---
I got trashed by survivors for just practicing hatchets one game.  They told me to just play the game and not screw around.  You really cant win with some people.
---
I'm a killer main, but the amount of times I hook someone, and a Meg runs in to save them before I even get the chance to leave the area... is actually baffling. 
---
Can you even imagine wtf the Freddy was thinking though? It's not having the infinite dead hard it's abusing it that's shitty. That's not respectable in the slightest. There's such a thing called good sportsmanship, but apparently people have forgotten what that means
---
True they can balance it by hiding player deaths or something like that, I just enjoy the idea
---
You should stop posting on this subreddit, everybody dislikes you
---
Ehh, DBD isn't about winning, it's about humiliating the other player.
---
So I tend to just opt out of that by playing like a fuckwit sometimes. In this case, I didn't want hooks. I wanted hatchets. I got hatchets. I had a great time.
---
I loved the flashlight beams x) 
---
I am glad we finally have a female survivor that isnt a young adult, we have like what 3 old men? diversity isnt just about skin color. 
---
Ik
---
Sorry,didn’t see that someone had made it, I saw the same comment by the guy on the same post. I DID make this though, i didn’t steal u/Smolders1’s clip
---
The stuff you see beyond the scopes of the playable map, so the horizon, sky, and any distant objects in either of them.
---
Badham originally had a pretty sky at dusk, with the shades of blue and orange and pink of a setting sun: https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/012/985/898/large/pascal-quintin-ingame-freddy4.jpg?1537482653). Now it just has a generic, dark starry sky, like Haddonfield.
---
The difficulty has absolutely changed how people play which is what I find more annoying. Feel like killers used to farm a bit or at least let someone get the hatch when people DC, but now I'm running into campers and sluggers every game. I get it, it's a game and you play to win but it makes it a little less enjoyable on both sides when you're playing to grind so hard.
---
&gt; Even at high ranks loops are non issues for most killers if you run them correctly.
---
Depends on the loop tile, depends on the killer, and it banks on survivors making critical. mistakes. Meanwhile, your first 2 to 3 generators go up in the duration of the first chase.
---
&gt; Myers huntress and clown can all decimate solo teams if you know what you’re doing without much effort.
---
I'd call this hyperbolic, but it's too generous to use a more eloquent word for such a blatant and outright lie.
---
You certainly implied it. You said in a scenario where you infinite dead hard and used it to avoid going down when you should have you'd avid being hooked. The only way to do so would be to exploit. So yes, you did say that.
---
I saw you post this on twitter and ive been laughing at this for hours
---
 I think, that the servers will fix  the issues of 3v1 etc. And after this is fixed , we can finally punish leavers.
---
make sure to wear your P.L.A.G.A hats
---
That’s some menacing broccoli 
---
I don't want the devs to change the experience for the entire player base, dude. I want the devs to change the experience for people that CAN'T FUCKING EXPERIENCE IT! Honest to God.. You're just saying the same thing, over and over. I no longer have to energy to bother with you. Kick rocks. 
---
And also if they leave the game you get the points you’ve earned until that moment they left but if the killer actually DCs (internet problems or closing the application) you get no points at all and have just wasted a huge amount of time especially if they decide to do this at the exit gates. Nothing tilts me more than that :(

There's already an extra surv \*cough\* bill \*cough\* survs dont need 6 more perks than killers. imo they should make another killer only dlc
---
This was a really nice video c: makes me think of the good times in dbd. Wish more killers were like this &lt;3
---
Actually it gets me a free 10k bp while reading a book. Since I’m not good at killer, it helps me max out my categories. 
---
Exactly. There is no need to make it harder to rank up if there are literally no rewards for doing it. As you said, making it harder to rank up means less players in red ranks. And that means more lobbies waiting times. So they create this new matchmaking system to completely contradict the ranking system, it's so stupid.
---
Well, that's kinda the point, no? My point is that the hindrance isn't even that because of how good players, if they haven't found it within the first 30 seconds of the match, can deal with it easily enough that it may as well not even exist.
---
Doctor: AHAHAHAHAH
---
*Bell tolls*
---
I've seen the hatch at the back of the bottom of the temple, in the section with the white circle on the floor.
---
Oh I just meant in general not this whole wikipedia thing. That I keep seeing the word thicc everytime Jane pops up and I'm sure it ain't gonna die.
---
Agreed.  I haven't played in a long while but have come back to playing killer at rank 20 (now 18 after some games).  Not once have I been put with someone over rank 11.  Wtf?  I'm all for it being harder to rank up, but like you said, there's no point in it if you're just going to be playing against people way better than you regardless.
---
Honestly wouldn't recommend it. I've heard stories from a few people where EAC slams down on any file editing.

When I do shit like this, I have the expectulion I will be hooked and die.

The only way to not get hooked is to exploit a bug? &lt;- your words.LOL have you not thought maybe I meant just not using it at all once you notice it’s bugged? Maybe your bad at English and that’s why your confused idk but either way I never said I would exploit it. Also I will not just hand myself over to the killer in any instance other than if they wanted to farm. 
---
Missed the obvious chance to use [this song](https://youtu.be/n0Wa_O7Hb1s) in the second half.
---
But it's always nice when the Killer decides to be nice to the remaining Survivors after the rest of them did nothing. He probably felt bad that you guys didn't do a single gen.
---
They don't want you to get easy adepts using mori as it added more pressure.
---
Now you need to use the killers teachables sweaty add-ons and double pip the game.
---
You better pray some little shit doesn't DC feeling lik you bully/tunneling em
---
There’s also silent billy which is really unexpected when he zooms in from out of you POV.
---
With me, I just wait about 2-3 minutes and I'm in. Unless I'm playing SWF with 2 other people, then it takes 10-30 minutes.
---
People here say M1 often. What does it do (console player)? I’m assuming it is hitting them on the hook?
---
They still look too silly to make me mad. Plus ifnsome didn’t do it, I likely wouldn’t have been able to down them.
---
I must be. Everyone is having poor queues right now but me and probably a few others. 
---
Your telling me what you think I meant lol. I said “I will not just hand myself over to the killer” and that does not mean to exploit it. You can still run the killer without using it dear Satan how do people get triggered that I would exploit it when I never said I would exploit it. I feel like the salt is coming from bad killer mains that want everything handed to them. Like wow
---
It's hard to pull off &amp; very inconsistent. Combined with potential latency issues the perk is very high risk for little reward. 
---
Think it might be getting a buff. Hopefully in the near future. 
---
Feels bad getting reported for hacking. Seriously though that's quite weird.
---
So it must be SWF that is the issue since that’s all I play. 
---
It's weird how people in this sub always think "I'm not good at chases" means "I don't get in chases EVER." Of course I get in chases sometimes and practice then. But it's a detriment to my team to seek out a chase if I'm going to go down super quick. I'm not going out of my way to look for them. And if the killer is determined to proxy camp the hook instead of chase me I'm better off going to work on a gen.
---
It's a nice perk on her. Helps the snowball alot.
---
That chipmunk voice from the speedup was so cute
---
Its how you spot a teabagger in the wild. Drop a log on the ground and watch for people who croutch a few times
---
Not really, before the ranking systems there was a LOT of red ranks tbh because pipping was way too easy. I've seen players reach rank 1 with less than 100 hours of gameplay (like me). So maybe the point behind this was to place players in the ranks they TRULY deserve, but this is clearly not happening because it's still easy to pip since me and many others are playing against rank 15 survivors lol. But i agree with you. I understand that they want to make ranking up a harder task for some reason, but this is WAY TOO HARD if you get matched with red ranks (which almost never happens). 
---
 At least you can play solo. :D
---
Why’d you crop out the bottom?  This is Wobedy’s footage, look up “wobedy chainsaw myers.”. You get the same clip with his name as the survivor during part of the video.  Why’d you leave him uncredited?
---
Also to the language part I was actually giving them the benefit of the doubt. Thinking maybe they just don’t understand English that well. Not an insult. Salty people just find all the salt they can.
---
You get a merciless victory from sacrificing or killing all four survivors. That's it. That's how you get killer Adept Achievements.
---
I usually farm/let survivor escape if a person DC other than internet connection. 
---
Maybe more people running spine chill since ds got its nerf
---
hag was always the worst for me
---
The devs mentioned in a Q&amp;A that they are planning on changing Dying light to be less tunnel focused. Perhaps this will bring the solution of having to hook everyone equally for its effect. 
---
Of course, this may be left for months considering how the devs currently have much more pressing issues on their plate right now.
---
SWF is extreme easy mode. I wish the game just let a max of two friends play per trial so they would leave when the exits are open. They hang around so long that my points are maxed. I don’t mind doing other things while they play but I’m sure some killers just want a new trial and pray it’s not SWF.
---
Yeah man this has to be a fucking joke or something. It has to be.
---
Mh, y’all are bitching way too much. Survivors pips might be hard but killer isn’t at all. I’m a rank 1 killer playing mostly Pig/Freddy and I never depip. Sure the system is harsh but it’s not impossible. If you’re tunneling to death one person then the other then the other and you miraculously get a 4K of course you won’t pip you also don’t deserve it. I’ve done games where I got destroyed and managed to kill only one and i still black pipped. Stop fucking bitching and improve your playstyle. 
---
PS : I’m talking as killer side. I almost never play as survivor, I can’t tell about it tho. 
---
Will, again, repeat myself: "there's a difference between harder pips and literally playing perfectly to safety pip." What I think most people wanted was for you not to pip just because you did a single gen and unhooked a single person or because you facecamped two Survivors (one with NOED and one without.) But now as Survivor you have to unhook everyone twice, never get hooked yourself, do all the gens, and be chased for most of the game. And likewise as Killer you have to kill everyone without them doing a single gen.
---
I don't have the Reddit post but in particular for Survivor there's a catch 22 for ranking up at the highest ranks, where you need to unhook Survivors to rank up but you also lose rank if you get hooked? So again it creates a catch 22 where *someone* has to derank so the others can rank up, or else everyone loses rank!
---
It's awful and the people who are just saying that others need to "git gud" ar really short-sighted.  
---
Also doesn't help that Rank 3s are going up against Rank 15s...
---
*Bill. The one and only p3 lord.*

---
What do you mean by entire reddit list?
---
I wish it didn’t annoy anyone, so killers wouldn’t have to see their moronic squats and be upset. They’d quit if no one cared. However, I totally understand how some can’t help but be annoyed. 
---
Fun fact, in the original Halloween Michael Myers was 5'10. It wasn't until later on they decided to make him extremely big. 
---
Head on's hit box is pretty weird. I was next to a locker and got stunned and I sat there in shock.
---
You have to be in the locker for 3 seconds and then you can hold shift to sprint out of the locker. Cant hold shift before the perk is ready to use. Killer has to be in range to open the locker in order to stun him. But the further he is from the locker the longer it takes for the stun to hit him. There's potential for the killer to hit you as you burst out of the locker before the stun hits them. Also, doesnt seem to do too well when its off to the right or left gotta be perpendicular to the locker.
---
Its extremely situational and easy for the killer to play around if he knows you're in the locker or suspects it. 
---

I think it says a lot about the DBD community that you have to justify liking to play Legion. I main survivor but I don't get other survivors that dc the moment they see Legion or get downed early. Like ffs just play the game and try to have as much fun as you can.
---
Good on you for playing what you like!

i cant loop/360 as a survivor at all. But im good at killer

I remember my first match against her, was chased by her till I threw a pallet and then was trying to waste time till she broke it. Then she was just staring at me from the other side until SLASH! God damn I jumped, was so damn fun

Again in the video that is the topic of this entire post he is only able to avoid being downed by using his Dead Hard a third time. It's not very complicated. However it's clear you aren't willing to listen so I'm going to go ahead and drop the conversation.
---
Depends. Were they all grouped together the whole match? Did they do gens alone? Did they seem coordinated, organized?
---
OhHh NooooOo! FraNKliNs' IS oP Now ApParEnTlY!  
---
in all seriousness... suck it up.
---
*Well if all fountains are reset. She gets automatic corrupt Purge meaning...rip survivors*
---
I am annoyed with all of the extra stuff they are throwing in that is totally unnecessary and that no one asked for. 
---
Now wouldn't that be something?
---
I never said I get upset - just that it looks silly and undignified to me. And I never look at other drivers but that can be way more serious. If all they do is flip me off? Fine. If they’re unstable and start tailgating and smashing their horn, it scares me. ( Maybe I’ve read too many horror novels that involve road rage.) I don’t like arguments and am more of a peacekeeper type of person. It’s really hard to offend or upset me, especially   if they’re just random people. 
---
This is so cute oh mt
---
I swear I thought he was friendly, then he killed me ::(((
---
Let's break this down point by point then, because you're clearly not understanding anything. 
---
&gt;I'm a very respectable player
---
Doubt it.
---
&gt;when I see infinite dead hard you better believe I’m not just gonna throw myself onto the hook for the killer
---
Okay, cool. This is in direct response to when I said "but the moment you knowingly and repeatedly use it to your advantage is super duper toxic. Any respectable player would've given themselves up, cause that's just bullshit." This *clearly* means if you abuse it, you should definitely give yourself up because it was a clear, unintended advantage that you knowingly abused. If you don't abuse it, then there's no problem. This conversation wouldn't even be happening. But that's not what you said. You then came back with above quote, heavily implying that you would be more than happy to abuse this because "it's not your fault it happened".
---
&gt;It’s only wrong if you purposely made the glitch happen.
---
It's wrong if you find out about it, and then immediately use it to escape a situation that otherwise would lead to you being hooked. That makes you a dick.
---
Also, what you think you meant =/= what you actually said. You can call us stupid, but the fact that you can't coherently put into words what you're thinking is very telling. Username checks out. 
---
If wanting survivors to not abuse every single bug in their favour and then getting shit on by the survivor main circlejerk in this post makes me a bad killer main, then sure. I guess I am /s
---
I’m curious as to how this would work with daily rituals and add one. I’d scream every time I hit a survivor and got Freddy lol cool concept though for sure. 
---
Oof. If it gets too much, there's KYF
---
Sometimes ppl just have bad games and when they keep going down first every time they just can’t handle the rage. I know cuz this has happened to me😂😂
---
Freddy : and you have my incompetence. 
---
Camping &lt; Punishing people with a speed-demon Chainsaw rush right before they hop a Window.
---
Damn I want to face your survivors! When I play hag they all crouch and then they search chest for flashlights if they didnt bring them in already. 
---
I’ve been seeing this a lot more too. Like wayyyyyyyy more. Nearly every game the first person downed/hooked DCs. It always seems like rage quitting to me for being the first one to get got... but who knows
---
Yeah but no blood points. Rip lol it’s a lose lose situation.
---
Meg or Claud
---
Just a bunch of people who should just uninstall the game and pick up something else. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Jane thicc confirmed
---
...unless they D/C after being found.
---
I swear rank 1 survivors are more likely to feed Myers evil than a new player is...
---
One of my biggest issues with it is that it makes killer pipping more difficult as well. Killer ranks were reasonably ok as far as i'm concerned, they weren't too difficult and weren't too easy. At most, a slight nerf would be all you need. They've turned survivor pipping to stupid levels. If you really wreck a killer, you'll depip that game, because you got no altruism, and probably only chaser or lightbringer emblems with surviving. I just wanted it to take some effort for survivors, since literally getting like 2 safe saves or doing 1-2 gens was enough to essentially guarantee a pip before, and depipping as a survivor pretty much never happened. I wanted it to mean that high rank survivors were actually good, not that they just played x amount of hours a month.
---
Also a lot of my games either don't load, or start with 3 people now. Awful hard to pip as either side when that happens.
---
Got Iridescent and 3 Golds earlier, still didn't double pip. With the current levelling system, some killers are gonna be easier to pip with, which is kinda dumb.
---
~~I only safety pipped on one of those moonwalking myers games.~~
---
https://i.imgur.com/QHClNNQ.jpg pip screen of the nurse match
---
I don't play enough to get to low ranks I'm sure that's why. 
---
Great! That’s what I do too. Or they’re getting ready for a hook save or trying to hit me with pallets. I always go around pallets btw. It’s easier since they don’t expect it and you don’t have to look down. I go back and break them later though so they can’t slide over them.
---
Infuriate is a strong work though - do you know why or is it just one of those random things that annoys you? I hate when they blow up gens for attention more since it hurts my ears. Though I thought this guy was doing that and it turned out he was just really bad at skill checks. I would have thrown him down at the hatch in pity, but I didn’t know how to drop someone on Xbox, plus a hook was right there.
---
People who don't know how to loop.

I'm totally confused by the logic for gaining pips. As a killer it seems to be based on game length now. I have games where I dispatch four survivors in short order and bearly get a safety. Then there are the games where I just manage a 2K but because it's dragged out like crazy I pip.
---
Also (and I may be mistaken here) a 4K no longer seems to give an Iridescent Devout emblem. How does that work? I can't sacrifice more than four survivors in a match.
---
Hillbilly butt boi
---
Its pretty sad that these posts like this are still being posted non ironically. 
---
Because this sub is exclusively shitpost memes and if any valid criticism or discussion appears it normally gets down voted to high hell. Not buying anymore dlc including the plague until they at a minimum fix the matchmaking bullshit. Played yesterday and it took 8 minutes just about every time to find a match.
---
You would, and I don't, but I'm sure it doesn't help.
---
I play a lot of nurse on xbox, taken her to rank 1 and it can be very difficult. My best advice...
---
1. Play with absolutely no add ons that alter anything with charge speed, blink speed, or distance until you grasp the base. If you use add ons, make them balance out. EX: pocket watch for - fatigue, + slight charge time, with the common add on for - slight charge time. So that the only change is fatigue duration. Stick with just two blinks for now.
---
2. Dont waste time on a survivor who wants to be chased, because if they want to be chased by a nurse they will probably frustrate you until you learn the tricks they do.
---
3. If a survivor sees you charging a blink and starts running at you so you overshoot, remember that, they will probably try again. In that case, assuming you're not above the basement, blink straight down to stay in place and hit them.
---
4. In a chase with multiple floors? Aim down to stay on F1, Aim High to reach F2, aim middle and adjust to land on stairs.
---
5. Be absolutely sure your swing will hit, a miss extends the fatigue.
---
6. Good perks on her: Nurses combined with Monitor, gives you a 4 meter advantage to see people healing while they arent in TR. Otherwise, bloodhound/sloppy butcher for tracking and slowdown. Bbq is always good. 
---
I mean there is. Camping will get you to lose ranks against better players. Only way SWF works is if theyre obsessed with getting all 4 to survive. Its a much better playstyle,  rankwise, to just hook and go get another. 
---
I rather wait till 10 seconds, than going into a game with 3 man because the lobby was bugged again
---
Because why else make the post? 
---
i played today and only randomly disconnected one time
---
I fucking hope so
---
Heh. I get this. I've settled around Rank 8. I was 4 before, but I guess my skill level is apparently MUCH LOWER than what I've been at the past two years! 
---
Passive aggressive as well...
---
people who heal in the corner of the map
---
Also, if you get put on rotten fields or any corn heavy map consider it a loss and try your best anyway.
---
Unless the killer face camps you and when your trash teammate unhooks you with her right behind them and hooks you again and repeats.
---
First time I ran into Myers, he grabbed me off a gen with no terror radius. Scared the living shit out of me 
---
Only been playing Bubba since update but before the update I've never had problem before since the update I either get the 4 kills fast or by the time I get a hook(not because it takes long) there's already 3 Gens popped even with ruin n also people would get effected by ruin n go n get it but now it's like people just do Gens even with ruin before update when I was a survivor doing Gens with ruin was so slow especially with multiple people on it
---
At first they're like "?" when she's just sitting there.
---
When they get grabbed it's more like "?!?!?!?!!!!!!"
---
Thats why its cheaper than the other DLCs 
---
Bubba has 0 map pressure 
---
I do this, but I use Premonition so it makes me feel safer
---
That ergs me a lot, especially when they’ve been picking their character or equipment,  then right before *poof* they’re gone.
---
Agreed, i only ever camp the most toxic teabaggers, if someone is just genuinely better than me but doesn't bm, i feel no reason to bm them by facecamping 
---
I haven't gotten one Merciless Killer. Not ONE. 
---
Survivors that just stand at a pallet instead of looping it.
---
Yeah it's crazy how different songs sound in the alternate key. One of my favorites is actually the [SAW theme in the major key.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cAlbLXuS-s)
---
I dunno about that, but there was a double edged sword for the killer closing the hatch: it powers the exit gates.
---
I was thinking about this the other day. I looked at their history and thought to myself that this is really the only game of theirs that's special. 
---
I think they should start taking things a little slow due to the obvious issues the game is dealing with. Maybe don't make a map or just remake the naps like Rainbow 6 does. Make something old new again. 
---
Hell even Team Fortress 2 last few major updates didn't bring as much to the table as they used too but focused more on a rebalance of the game itself. I hope they can focus on marketing the update around the changes and not new items just to make the game more stable before we get the goodies. Like I love the new killer and perks and etc, but I think they should really focus on making the game stable overall.
---
Let's make an example, take the Leatherface DLC, it only came with a killer and that's it. Leaving more time to polish the game because they are not focusing on a survivor or a new map. If they do something small like that, then maybe the game will have a better time being stable.
---
What was it to get merciless, 9 hooks????
---
&gt;and I sat there in shock
---
Working as intended then ?
---
"Chainsaws are OP and kill the game" sounds pretty triggered to me
---
I don't think there's actually an internal debate here. 
---
I leave my Steam Profile open to comments and some of the shit people type amaze me.
---
*”baby Killer had to use NOED kill yourself I hope you get cancer.”*
---
....all because they were mad at a Videogame they lost. Okay.
---
The Plag
---
UeU
---
It sounds like you aren't playing very well, protecting totems is a horrible idea the only time you should be visiting your totem is at the beginning of the game and maybe during any freetime you have
---
Yeah Trapper for that classic horror movie feel but Huntress would be great. That lullaby is just too good.
---
Maybe you wouldn’t get that if you stopped *displeasing* the Entity. Until you get **thirteen** hooks in a match, the Entity will be displeased with you.
---
I think it's a feature.
---
I feel like the wraith has alot of potential due to the false panic the sound of a bell ringing can cause the huntress is cool because shes not a total pycho like half the killers meaning you could have scenes where shes just straight leaves the protag alone 
---
Never seen that before. In my cases it's just me that gets dced. I've been playing with my friend and it happens and he's still in the game so I know it's just me. 
---
Was he a low rank cause Billy Boi got the best map pressure. Anyway, nice job. Send that man a friend request :) 
---
I don't know a whole lot when it gets to the really technical side of things but this doesn't seem all that tough. All of the other killers are already coded and everything. One thing that came to my mind though is as to not have every thing spawn in mid game ALL killer tools would have to spawn right away. All plague fountains, all jigsaw boxes, and all bear traps. I'm sure your right though with all the different variables that could happen from different powers and transforming while preforming actions would all be a mess.
---
Ah my deepest apologies 🥺🥺
---
I mean maybe you’re not that good at running them but all of those killers can easily 4k. It’s really not that hard to force mistakes out of even really good survivors
---
Absolutely. Wraith would create a sense of unease like you said, fear of the unknown.
---
I dont remember
---
No, just no.
---
Usually a claudette or dwight does this to me
---
I thought about that and as to prevent everything from spawning in mid game i think the amp would have to spawn with all of the bear traps, fountains, and key boxes which there is no way the game is going to handle well lol. And yeah in my mind if you place a trap as trapper the trap would stay until disarmed or triggered but couldn't be reactivated unless you got trapper again.
---
But reddit told me it’s survivors who are entitled!
---
It’s a stupid solution but when I don’t think I’ve got enough for the double pip, I farm with the last survivor. Letting them do gens, downing them, kick the gens, get them back up etc. This nets you more bloodpoints and gives them an incentive not to DC
---
You know it’s dumb when the best solution I can give is to farm with the survivor. I’ve found it even harder on the survivor side too. 
---
It should be difficult to double pip but DCs definitely shouldn’t affect that, as if sandbagging, face camping, etc weren’t bad enough. Everyone suffers. Completely agree on all ends
---
That's what I'm trying to stay I only do that with the spirit n never had a problem getting the 4k or having the last person get the hatch I don't do totems with Bubba only use ruin n don't ever go to it unless I hook n see them with BBQ since update the game ends very quickly by either gen rushing or I get the 4k to fast
---
Reddit is a double edged sword friend😭 as many lies as there are truths 
---
Yeah but after being stabbed, looped, stunned, blinded, and teabagged as well as all the other shit most killers just say fuck it, which is what separates the rank 1s and 12s
---
Trapper cause he's the "face of the game"
---
But Wraith or Huntress would be amazing. 
---
The Doctor could be some sort of "torture porn" kind of movie. 
---
It should be the original trio
---
Trapper wraith and billy 
---
Behvr has not realized rage quitting is more common than. People actually taking the L like a champ. This new system enforces you to bully survivors/killers to prolong the match resulting in dcs
---
Saw 2.0
---
Same!! I've had quite a few matches where the ready button is greyed out and I cannot ready up no matter what I try. I hate to be that person but its unavoidable sometimes :(
---
You need to get the plague perk that blocks 3 gens for 2 minutes, run sloppy and run NOED to punish gen rushing and not cleansing totems
---
What rank are you normally? Matchmaking is fucked right now so there’s a pretty good chance you’re just facing higher ranked survivors than you should be. 
---
All three??? Kinda op but ok😂😂😂
---
Legion is really good for bloodpoints; his power encourages you to hit multiple people, and slow the game down. It’s a stupid solution and it shouldn’t just be “play a certain (DLC) killer” but that goes to show how broken the new system is 
---
If dead by daylight ever got adapted to the big or small screen it would have to be an anthology movie or series. There’s just no other way to do it justice.
---
Yep, but Chaser is also a huge issue for me and has always been my greatest challenge. I main Trapper, and the biggest losses of points come from the fact that cutting off chases with Traps doesn't count towards "Chases won" despite the level of skill that actually takes, and apparently setting traps around hooks is a big no-no.

---
Doc would be too f***ed up imo. Huntress would be mad too.
---
I'm admittedly guilty of panicking and hating the new system because I couldn't easily get back to rank 1. I got back to rank 1 as killer just fine today, but survivor is still way too hard. It's not that it takes a long time, but you can play 4 average survivor games, only pip once, and then immediately depip because the killer didn't like the look on your face the next game. This isn't even at rank 4, this is happening at rank 8. Survivor side definitely needs some love.
---
If they're making it this hard to actually rank up, then I sure hope they plan on adding in some kind of rank rewards, too.
---
Kinda pointless to run noed with a insta down chainsaw n that plague can also promote gen rushing even more since ur tunneling more survivors to the same gen
---
Yeah that makes sense. That’d be pretty insane. I like it though. 
---
I know what you mean, and I agree. I'm just thinking of what would be most likely to happen, and I think horror films. 
---
Ok, say I have get chased for 180 seconds as whatever survivor. It would be nice to know when you have accomplished that so you can stop getting in chases and focus on other things. Or if for whatever reason you cant remember if you unhooked two or three survivors do you still need one this game? It would be nice to know so you dont end a game and it say 178/180 seconds. 
---
My friend was playing rank 1 killer and got matched with a rank 20 survivor. At this point, rank literally could not mean less.
---
Maybe ☺️
---
Anyone who farms their teammates. I have a very strict honor code against that shit. You farm your teammate? I will chase you down and I will not stop until I kill you, because I know exactly what it's like to be on the receiving end of that. 
---
Other than that, I get really pissed if a survivor behaves stupidly and doesn't expect me to catch them. You DC out of a locker? Tough shit, own up to the consequences. You DC because you got found first? It's a matter of luck, pal. Suck it up. You're not helping the team or being a good sport by behaving like that. 
---
Haha that was actually pretty good 😂

Wow an actual intelligent person thanks man, but yeah I'm prob gonna stop talking about blatantly obvious problems as its just twisted as negative whining..etc Cant say I didn't try It's just not worth it.
---
Listen buddy, imma clap ya cheeks more times than I’ve got chins 😏😏😏
---
You must be a really good survivor main :P
---
Well i am a Rank 3 hag main and sometimes i play as the wraith , and i find it really easy to catch and kill survivors.Most of the time one survivor escapes through the hatch.
---
The nightmare and legion must be buffed,maybe The Doctor too...  but others killers are fine if you know how to play them.
---
rank 5. &amp; i did.
---
Lol, salty Claudette's downvoting you XD
---
If you slugged, then you deserved it. 
---
Yep, and i think Killers who have an instadown kinda suffer with this same emblem too. Wish they would do something about it.
---
I never have enough larrys on my myers.
---
I partially disagree, sure everyone should respect each other but killers dont make the game
---
Hold up 
---
Wait 3 min
---
As I get my popcorns ready
---
Im honestly scared that i will get bored of the game once i have p3ed every killer.
---
TumTums and Myers are the only 2 I seem to have no issue getting chase. I mean, you do have to chase for those.
---
Somebody obviously doesn't play both sides of the board.
---
I mean at least now it won't look like I have an extra loop, when I really don't. I'd know exactly when to just throw the pallet
---
Basically, had a fun game on red forest. But the survivors decided to swarm 1 exit gate against me (as a leather face) and I managed to get 3 of them and the only one to escape said this in chat.  Anyone else seen someone salty about this? (Hell who knows maybe I’m misinterpreting what they mean by it in the first place.)
---
What is an “OhTofu”? All I see is Bubba doing what Bubba does 
---
Evil Within 4
---
Nah it's fine just farm everyone and move on to the next match
---
In yellow and green ranks,sure. But the only way you can get a 4k in red ranks is it the survivors make a mistake or are just idiots.
---
Honestly, I really like new DS. As killer, it actually has counter-play that's not dribbling, the stun time isn't so bad (a joke with enduring), and it doesn't feel so shitty to get hit by it since it's your own damned fault for tunneling. 
---
As survivor, you're not shafted if you're not the obsession already, it works nice in tandem with deliverance to make some dank end game saves, and you're no longer left *completely* hopeless if you get tunneled off hook. I would, however, like to see it be buffed to not be affected by enduring, or up the base stun time and keep the enduring interaction. 
---
Yeah me when I visited your mom.
---
I didn't slug them, so, that point is invalid.
---
Let the AFK battle commence loser gets no ed
---
(Pretty sure he means Killers host the lobby.)
---
Yeah I can’t stand the D/C culture. There really needs to be stricter consequences or at least an option to let somebody else in if no Gens are done.
---
In a game of 4 people, you are at such a disadvantage when only one person quits at the beginning. Honestly at least half of my Survivor games end in loss because someone got found in the first minute of the game. 
---
You can easily recover and escape after being found so early on. I don’t get why people just immediately quick-hand the Disconnect button .4 seconds after being hit once.
---
It is a bad perk. The perk would been better as a active ability like dead hard. Though dead hard isnt really that good too. But yeah Balanced Landing and DS is a good combo. Lol
---
Looks like dead hard finally works
---
“Hag is on me go for hook” 
---
*MYC goes off*
---
*evil grin* 
---
No Stan , the dicks belong to me:0
---
Why does anyone actually care? Rank literally doesn't mean anything in this game, it's always just been a measure of how much you've played more than actual skill
---
The only thing that really annoys me are people who cleanse all willy nilly and choose fountains around gens that aren’t completed yet. I’ll see someone unhook a sick survivor and cleanse next to an exit gate before they even hit broken status instead of cleansing at a far fountain where the gens are already completed. 
---
What I think should be changed is that the plague gets her power after all her fountains reset. I think it’s bullshit that I’m getting chased doing my thing and then all of a sudden she has her power because of my teammates cleansing the last fountain when they don’t even need to(ie.exit gates will be open, they can just leave)! You can get caught in a really bad spot this way. Idk what does everyone else feel about this? 
---
Aw boo hoo sorry I'm not spending my money on ugly cosmetics. I'm taking a break from actually playing the game because I'm sick of getting stuck in an infinite loading screen every other match. I'll just be browsing the subreddit without playing until they get round to reworking freddy, fixing the infinite loading screens or dedicated servers are released. BHVR wouldn't even need to pay the employees that make the shit cosmetics if they never hired them in the first place. You don't seem to be able to make up your mind; are the cosmetics completely useless and easy to grind for or are they needed for the devs to make money? It's either one or the other because if they were useless with no point in buying auric cells then they would make no money from them.
---
P.S. please go over your sentences before you send them, it's getting annoying trying to translate your typos and grammar mistakes. 
---
THEY CHANGED IT??
---
Pallets are find so long as you use them efficiently and don't just throw them down immediately. Unfortunately we got immersed potatoes who don't loop and prefer to urban evade around with their Sprint burst and self care on hand (imo these perks promote bad gameplay) not giving a shit about pressure gens and will go down in 10 seconds...  Peeps just need to get better at getting chased/looping. 
---
But also fuck Noed tho, fix that bs. Yeah, yeah, "cleanse the totems" TAKE THAT TOTEM AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS.
---
Mmmhm...I'm sure. I'm sure.
---
I agree with this very much.  I don't mind it being harder but the requirements now are way too hard to even safety pip.  Some of my survivors are built to be an evader and stealth.  I haven't pipped at all because of this since i don't get chased and escape.  
---
The movie could just cover 3 trials... be like we escaped that maniac with bear traps! 
---
Wait what now whos this inbred with a chainsaw!
---
 S M O L G A M E
---
I had to pee!
---
Nea: *Screeches in a high-pitched voice*
---
A Meg looping a killer! Lmao 
---
I'll get back in my locker ;-;
---
Being left to die on my first hook. It has even happened with kindred. 
---
As Dwight main I would like to apologize 
---
Removed for salty after game chat 
---
Aw, this video was unavailable :/ 
---
I walk around all game very game with a tool tip showing my left dpad and it says undefined.
---
I reassigned things like repair and self care to that button and it still works and the tooltip changes when it needs to but between just walking around says undefined...
---
Also unknown if related or not but when I stop to self care it doesn't always let me right away and i got to wiggle my left joystick a bit.
---
There is actually a bug going around right now that's causing survivors to dc randomly. I've experienced it a lot since the new patch - 1 time it was unfortunately after getting downed. I can't even play dbd anymore because I don't want to get banned for looking like I'm rqing. 
---
If it only happens after hooks/downs, I'd say its probably just survivors being bitter, but this patch is honestly terrible for bugs so could be anything.   
---
The only difference I see in killer is I don't double pip nearly as often so I think killer is pretty close to being good, survivor though even at purple ranks I have an almost perfect game and still don't even safety so I think survivor needs to be changed a shit-ton (plus the way you get emblem points as survivor is just shitty anyways and needs to be changed)
---
Are you a survivor or killer main?
---
“You checked this exit in the last 5 minutes you gotta go to the other one”  “why does it matter that all 4 survivors were here, go to the other one.” 
---
Lmao read his comment history it's hilarious! 
---
Go stand at the other exit and think about what you did smh 
---
Does anyone have the clip of Myers doing a Mori on a Jake, but the Jake was near some stairs, so Myers ended up stabbing him straight up the rear? 
---
Thank God I’m so ready to escape this hellish realm
---
Pretty new to the game, only played for about a month now
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
that's fucking dumb
---
nah i want more thicc female characters. i'm a skinny girl myself but pretty much all the female dbd survivors have the same-ish bodytype and it's nice seeing something new.
---
the fact that i'm also a huge lesbian is absolutely coincidental to my view on this...
---
We just got rid of this mans karma lol
---
Just because survivors are having a hard time doesn't mean that killers should be ignored.
---
And it doesn't matter if you think it's "funny" that someone can DC and punish the killer for being good. 
---
I'm showcasing the fact that the new ranking system is fucked by showing that survivors are able to punish a killer by rage quitting.
---
I had a perfect game and hooked people enough times that, if they hadn't DC'd, I would have doublepipped. Because of the fucked ranking system, all they had to do was DC in order to grief me.
---
Nah, this reddit is just full of shitty killers who think survivor is op. Playing killer is so fucking easy right now on most maps vs solos. 
---
People on here act like theres some sort of skillcap for killers and they lose games because survivor is broken not because they didn’t play well enough. 
---
Please project more though, I’m sure your inability to consistently 3-4k is indicative of game balance and not lack of skill
---
Perhaps, it was really easy... pretty easy hitting rank one. Always would be getting 4K’s tho pretty rarely would I get an entity displeased 
---
Survivor is skill based but due to how the game held their hands for so long that after they got balanced they realized they aren't good at the game. 
---
Killers get kills based of survivor mistakes, its rarely because the killer is actually playing better
---
Same. Gotta work a lot harder now
---
I have this bug. Have tried other PC's and connections. No luck so it seems profile related. I have also had to quit as it makes it look like I'm some rage quitting jerk.
---
You know..I've been asking for a fat guy for a while now. And by fat I mean Eric from Friday the 13th game fat and I still haven't got my wish. I have the perfect set up for him, one which includes sprint burst.
---
I've started doing it since last patch because in a 3v1 it's basically impossible to pip anyway, might as well farm points from it.
---
That would only really work if this was a stealth game. As is the core interaction is looping the killer, not hiding scared of them and as such once you get good at looping there’s no reason to be afraid of the killer because they won’t just instantly fuck you up
---
Ikr I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB
---
It did, I was agreeing
---
Yep, there it was. Your bullshit facade finally cracked. 
---
Take care, my rank 10 delusional friend.
---
Don't worry, I gotchu!
---
[Bubba's SFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWjn7YXpm9I&amp;t=51s) \- This includes some that, AFAIK, are never actually used in-game.
---
Yea its just super unfair for people to have to click a button before they post or add 4 extra characters to their text comment. Nazi moderators are asking way too much. 
---
Someone must have had ds then
---
When I first saw a Myers: he walked behind a rock. I peek out of my hiding spot to see where he went. Motherfucker teleported right next to me.

Not even foam?!
---
Why are you filthy? You're a nurse main, if anything, you deserve praise my dude
---
I played a game as trapper today and got a 4k with 5 gens still up and didn't even pip. I don't really care about this new rank system(I never really cared about rank) and tbh I think as long as you're in red ranks you should not worry about piping but maybe that's just me 
---
Yea I just had a game where I did 2 gens 1 unhook and was the last to die. -1 pip
---
It doesn't. Just makes it bigger.
---
I still make the first face when I cleanse Haunted Grounds. It's a "Haha I'm in danger!" moment.
---
Yep. I mean playing about 4 decent games without getting any progress in ranking isn't that much fun
---
To see if eac kicks a cheating host.
---
I would love this! I've been considering my own fancomic about Glen and Claudette (idk if I want to make it straight up shipping them or more open ended but I think they'd have a cool dynamic). The huntress has such an interesting design and backstory to work with and I'd love to see more fanworks for this game.
---
Oh hey didn't expect to get a response from you. It can be hard not to constantly point out those blatantly obvious when they can have such a big impact on the game and they seem to go so long without change. For example Decisive strike just now got the kind of change that it needed. It can be very frustrating when so many people see a big issue with the game and it never receives attention from the devs. But all we can do as players is point out what we see, what we like, and what we dislike and hope for the best. Anyway it was nice seeing you here and I'll see you on stream, cheers!
---
Holy fuck yes. This needs to be added
---
Takes about 20 minutes per match on Xbox as a 2 person swf. Game is almost unplayable the last 2 days because we can’t find a match.
---
I haven’t played in awhile, but I remember I was in a party with one of my friends who was playing something else and just like out of nowhere the hag popped up and I let out a little yelp which caused my friend to bust out laughing. 
---
It’s the losing part that makes camping so annoying 
---
"Yay; death!"
---
I wouldn’t say that, great skill checks are quite good if you hit them consistently. If you get 4-5 skill checks that’s an 8-10% bonus.
---
I do think ruin is really stupid as a perk though. It slows down the game in the most inconsistent way possible. Maybe a better solution would be adding 20 seconds to each generator, or something like that. And hexes need a massive rework imo.
---
This happened to me as pig. No idea who was trapped or hurt or dead and didn’t know what perks I had. It was emotionally tolling.
---
Same thing with escaping through the exit gates. The entity will just summon you to another trial lol.
---
Nah, those days are far behind us
---
This is so wholesome
---
And you gotta admit the vaults are fucked right now. Medium-vaulting is safer than fast vaulting, so either the killer is cucked out of a hit or the survivor gets whacked from miles away.
---
We're about to end this man's whole career
---
It still baffles my why people play aggressive against leather face still. He’s been out so long. Still was a fun game and that’s all I look for.
---
Oh my God just yesterday I was playing with this guy in a swf group and I was like "Don't unhook me the killer is literally right there" he said "dont worry I know what I'm doing" he unhooks me to which I am immediately downed again. I'm hooked again and end up dying to which I just shut off my mic and hear him say. "Silver....Silver....oh he probably shut off his mic. I don't blame him I would probably be salty too if I died that early" Guess who left that group rip.
---
Kinda like the in-game report system
---
Click on my profile and look at my most recent comment, not this one.
---
One time I had a standoff with a hag for the hatch and I eventually left the room and waited for her to leave the hatch. When she left, I vaulted over a window to the room with the hatch and triggered one of her traps where she then immediately teleported and hit me which finally gave me the chance to escape through the hatch.
---
The old system would allow 12 points even if they all suicide on first hook still allowing you to pip but now it's suicide and fuck the killer
---
I didn't crop out nothing. I found the gif on the DBD Steam Community artwork section with no sourcing, but glad you were able to source it. 
---
Leatherface is THE defensive killer, it’s his main strength. And yet survivors always play into it, nobody would run in a straight line for a huntress but then swarm hooks against leatherface
---
Join a game as doc, killed a t-bag wanna be, found 2 dwights going to the basement, both same outfit, and a meg.   
---
Okay ,whatever.   
---
Down the Meg, decide to bring her to the dwights.  
---
They just wait there for like 10 minutes.   
---
Go check. Still there, now with birds, going to lockers, and hiding as I get closer, showing me the meg as tribute.   
---
I walk very straight lines, inch closer, whack.  
---
Repeats for several minutes.  
---
Eventually hook them all (they wanted it I think).  
---
Meg kills herself on hook.  
---
Dwights give into the Doctah for the ritual.  
---
We go outside, more hooks.   
---
The kept saying pizza in the post game chat and talking about how it was delivered, how they fixed it, and other mystical things.
---
Laugh at the funniest games I have ever had.
---
See I have a new comment on my profile.
---
  
---
" **Pizza** "
---
I was about to comment saying that a survivor isn’t really necessary..but having a Jane 2.0 looks- erm sounds good
---
[MFW](https://i.imgur.com/QpnBp7G.jpg) risky click of the day.
---
1/3 is like 3-4 shots? I'm estimating here but I've seen people projectile vomit from around that much. Vodka is usually 40% alcohol which is A LOT. I think half a bottle would be enough to turn someone into the Plague, lmao.
---
I say filthy jokingly, because I know a lot of people don't like playing against nurse as there's not much counterplay. (Well, there is _some_ counterplay like genrushing, but even that's slowed by ruin and punished by BBQ)
---
I don't really worry about pipping, but I find the idea that survivors can punish killers simply by rage quitting extremely... Stupid. 
---
Hell, rage quitting is listed as "unsportsmanlike" under the report system (https://i.imgur.com/xC7Mq9l.png) yet it has an actual, legitimate effect in game.
---
Its just how this community is.
---
I’ve been on a deranking spree now I guess cause every other game is like this! 
---
Let’s see how long it takes me to get from rank 10 to 20! :D
---
I retract my statement you’re 100% right, Western feel and everything
---
Damn 😔 never forget
---
Should have gone to a hook on the opposite side of the map from your hex and told him you were standing next to it.
---
😂
---
Out play them it’s very simple 
---
Right. Good idea. How could I have not thought of that?
---
Ranks are fucked because of the new pipping system and queue system. It's much harder for casuals to rank up, so there's less high ranked players, and the new queue system will match you with anyone after it fails to find appropriate ranked players.
---
Apparently not your bitching that you get looped 
---
It seems to me like Freddy’s want a free handout 4K
---
Wait you’re the stupid clown who tried to buff balanced landing like a month ago. 
---
Lmaoooooo. Have fun talking to yourself boss. 
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Victory_Cube
---
Pretty much Killer was only based on hooks and. kills, which lead to heavy tunneling.
---
Now if they suicide on hook or DC, you aren't rewarded as well as before punishing you because of others.
---
Tried to buff? I can make perks? Damn well wish I knew. You’re the stupid clown that bitches about against against killers 😂😂😂
---
Nope, as much as I love Kroger, he is in dire need of a rework. And you know why? His power does not help him. It hinders him.
---
 I repeat, waiting 7 seconds is not a power.
---
It got worse on ps4 after the last update. It took longer to find survivor matches but I always got full lobby’s  as a killer quickly now it takes 10 minutes for me to get a lobby as killer 
---
Freddy by himself is fine, it's just that there are far too many bugs and far too many ways for survivors to abuse how his power works for him to be any higher on the proverbial tier list than he already is to me. 
---
Wait... you think the Waith could use a buff, but not Freddy?  Freddy IS the Wraith except with heavy nerfs and garbage addons.  
---
All freddy has going for him is a free deer stalker:-)
---
You’re right and I totally agree with you. The first month of playing dbd was the most have I’ve had on a game maybe ever, because I was genuinely frightened of the killers and would scream when I saw the red light behind me cos I knew a hit was coming. But after putting more hours into it you realise that there’s nothing to be afraid of, and after that you can’t get that scary atmosphere back. 
---
Here's what happened:
---
Hook someone, look around the map (BBQ), chase whoever got lit up.
---
If someone was lit up, I went over to where they were, downed them, hooked them, then repeated.
---
When nobody was lit up (happened like twice that match) I went to a nearby generator, which had someone nearby that I then downed &amp; then hooked.
---
At no point in the match did I tunnel anyone. Everyone (except for the last guy, the one I hooked &amp; killed after the three DCs) had two hooks before the DCing started.
---
Thanks for telling me why I'm disagreeing, I wasn't aware of my own thought process.  
---
I play both sides, I'm not coming from a killer-main perspective here. I'm mainly a survivor, and I just completely disagree with the vacuum pallets and flashlights. Don't tell people why they reason the way they do, because you've no clue.
---
Seems fair
---
actually i got funny store related to this. when we started to play dbd first time with friend (when it was free on playstation) we had that saw themed room and michael as killer. we didint know what he did back those days and were fixing a gen together.
---
my friend just said that look myers is there. why he stands and stares? should we run im nervous?
---
im just like "lol he just noob standing there lets fix this ez clap"
---
suddenly myers starts charge incredibly fast and both of us made high pitch scream and started to ran in fear laughing. of course one of us got 1 shotted and being like "man save yourself im dead" 
---
it was best experiement we ever had in gaming still makes me chuckle lol
---
Then when you down them they DC and deny your BBQ stack
---
Great, now you got me imagining big ol' entity claws under that dress
---
One word: **Adrenaline**.
---
Besides that, while I do agree people make fun of Freddy more than he deserves, Freddy desperately needs a rework/buff because his power is too reliant on RNG; making him unfun to face and play. 
---
I don't enjoy it when I sleep someone and they get a skillcheck after 3 seconds of transition and I have to sleep them again. It took no effort on their part but demands more effort on my part.
---
Likewise, I'd imagine Survivors hate it when they can fully heal while asleep and never trigger a single skillcheck to Wake Up. Once again, they did nothing wrong but still suffer from it.
---
Those issues derive from Freddy's power and the way it's designed, so yes, I disagree with your opinion and think Freddy does need changes to his power.
---
Voice actor is the same as Feng Min but the tone is deeper.
---
Maybe Nea pussy smell like fish and mustard
---
Isn’t a power essentially an strong built in perk? Imagine if hags traps, Huntress hatchets, doctors madness etc were a perk, you’d see them on every build of every killer, more so than ruin/bbq/nurses imo. 
---
This is why you need to show their BP decreasing on screen while they tunnel or camp. Show it to everyone else in the game too. 
---
Otherwise they'll keep doing it without care. 
---
I actually agree. Everyone say he bad, but freddy is one of the most annoying killers and usually gets 3-4k when I play against him. 
---
People saying hi have no loop counter, well technically he as good against loops as any 115 killer. But dream world can fuck you up hard, when gens are powered and you have no ability to wake up.
---
Yeah mama 
---
Jonny bravo 2020
---
I do have a clue, you’re putting down someone else’s opinion because you don’t agree with his. I don’t agree with vacuum pallets either but survivors don’t have anyway to escape a chase now that pallets have been drastically reduced. Flashlights being pretty much useless now is bs. How much more can you take away before the game is unplayable??
---
sounds like she nutted tho maybe shes into that
---
I had that same thing happening,  I've been playing newly as the Hag to get a daily ritual done. I suuuuuck with her. So I have nothing,  I've been trying to use her devour all hope and as soon as I hook some one once,  next time I down them they DC. Obviously I can't be camping or anything either using that perk. I don't understand at all why survivors DC like that for NO reason. I main as survivor but I enjoy playing killer as well,  and survivor toxicity toward each other and killer is INSANE. 
---
I'll only DC if I get downed at the very beginning of a game,  and get face camped. It's annoying. But if I've actually got to do something I'll accept my fate,  and let my team get gens done. 
---
This is satire right?
---
Please say it's satire.
---
Indeed, it doesn't activate on hook any longer. Nice stealth nerfs, BHVR. There are just so so many good perks, so I completely understand that you have to stealthily nerf some of them, rather than actually buff any, ever.
---
You either play the legion
---
Or become the legion
---
Mixtape intensifies
---
This is likely a super unpopular opinion but BBQ&amp;Chilli and Urban Evasion equally.
---
I'd rather NOED every game than deal with BBQ and nothing peeves me more than being put on a hook after being chased for however long, only to see three other people urban evasioning around the map and 0 gen progress. 
---
Why would they do that? It’s already a bad perk so why make it worse?
---
Adrenaline does suck dick for Freddy yeah. Thing is about Pig is that she slows down when crouched, so you have to time your crouches perfectly when approaching a gen so that you dont waste time. Freddy dont have to do that.
---
Its like in 1 of 3 places. 
---
You literally have no clue though, I was very formal and respectful, not once did I disrespect/put down the person who wrote this. Not sure where you got that from. And as for the " survivors don’t have anyway to escape a chase now that pallets have been drastically reduced" I escape a lot of chases, daily, so still; I completely disagree. I don't find this game unplayable as a survivor at all.
---
He was talking mad shit, within crusade distance
---
Lololol9ooo
---
DBD redditors get triggered, [CRAZY CONSEQUENCES ENSUE](https://i.redd.it/xzkfhaq6t8t01.jpg)
---
Of course it’s high skilled. The killer would know where you are most of the game if you don’t know how to use it. And the fact that you have to run from the killer well makes the perk very unappealing for a lot of people.
---
His addons aint garbage. Class Photo is borderline OP, and range and dresses help slow down the game so much its amazing.
---
He has a lot more to him than a free deer stalker lmao
---
Oh the 'I-have-the-game's-last-remaining-infinite' map?
---
I won't DC but I despise it with a passion.
---
Some addons affect obsession, I know there's one for stalking as Myers and some shit for freddy
---
I've recently started to really "main" him, and I agree with this, 100%. Sure, I shit his power more then I should, but more times then not, I feel like I do well with him simply because people underestimate the fact that you can do well with him. When Marth's depip squad did a perkless run, Freddy's power shined, since they couldn't just cheese his dream with self care. He actually was scary to escape from. But I understand he is not fun to play against, and, at a baseline, his power's negatives outweigh the positives imo. This is why he needs a rework
---
This is exactly the crap that I'm tired of too. Killer mains on this subreddit in particular are the most entitled, self righteous group. (Not everyone but you know who you are.)
---
The constant whining about every possible thing a survivor can do in the game save for being hooked. The constant victim complex and circle jerk of "killer is SO stressful and skillful I can barely contain it." Its nauseating.
---
I used to defend a lot of killer main bias since I actually enjoy playing killer myself. But they don't have valid complaints anymore, now it's just entitlement. 
---
At this point I just want survivors to spawn on hooks so I can read the posts complaining that the struggle phase is too long and needs to be nerfed.
---
Fucking toddler Feng over here
---
Oh I hate Hag. Everytime I spring a trap I fucking jump then run into a wall because my hands flew off the keyboard and I can't find the right keys.
---
He should be released mid ch just for the hell of it
---
I get this as survivor as well. I'll depip two games in a row, then after restarting the game I have those pips back.
---
My two favorite things. RuPaul and daddy Myers. 😌
---
I can't belive Mayers was LIVING while Jane was DYING
---
You’re to ignorant to accept what I said so I switched points your ignorance is blind. And no it’s not all “practice” I’m assuming you know killers move 15% faster at least (nurse is the only slower one) practice won’t matter in that scenario if all pallets are either broken or removed. Flashlights gave the survivors who got caught by normal means or laggy bullshit hit boxes. It gave them a chance to actually fight back but that’s not fair apparently. It’s toxic 
---
Sasha velour is quaking henny 
---
Or the fact that because you're a survivor main, you're low rank as killer so you ONLY get potato's.
---
"If I die it's because the killer is playing unfair, not because I'm bad"
---
;) uh oh. 
---
*Ahem*   Legion is best stabby boi
---
Never thought about that before, but the two do sound really similar.
---
Also yea, I felt obligated to post something on this thread :D
---
I'm not of the opinion that it's a bad perk, but as for why they would nerf perks that already rarely see use: BHVR seems to really love making perks that are hardly worth using. Most of the perks in this game range from bad to mediocre, and are not worth a slot.
---
I dropped from 1 to 11 because literally everyone just kills the self on the first hook. 
---
I'm not ignorant, we have different opinions. There's a massive difference.  
---
It is practice though, I'm not saying "you will guaranteed 100% stun the killer/get to the other side of the pallet if you practice", lag and bad ping does exist. But you will be able to do it if you learn the timing or have the right perks. I was up against a flashlight today, their flashlight seemed to work fine. I've used flashlights recently, they've been working fine. We just have different opinions, and that's okay, let it go buddy. Stop calling people who don't agree with you or others "ignorant". That's the stupidest thing I've heard in a while.  
---
I've heard that about rumor about trolls as well.  It's hard to tell anymore with the way the general populace acts. 
---
Don't worry this gameplay issue will be "fixed" with a perk only available with the new DLC!
---
How exactly can tinkerer and surveillance be countered?  
---
Yep. And no animation resets it. Not dying state, not hook, nothin. Apparently seems to be a legacy bug, seeing forums going back to 2017 discussing it.
---
For the killer change idea I thought it would be really cool to have a copycat killer who can mimic poorly the powers of other killers. Let's say he gets one Hatchet, one trap, very limited amount of Chainsaw use. Fun stuff like that.
---
I'm trying to keep the conversation to what I wanted to discuss. That's keeping it on track, you're the one who switched to a different subject when I wasn't even talking about it in the first place, my dude. Again, since you can't seem to grasp this by ALL of my previous replies; I mostly  D I S A G R E E  with you. Now let it go, you won't change my mind. No point in you getting mad about it. It's just reddit. Also, regarding Hex: Ruin, I don't care that it got buffed, I don't use it as a killer, and I just do my best to hit hex skill checks or work with another survivor so that if I don't, it'll at least be faster in between the skill checks.
---
But how tho. How did they no ur gamertag 
---
LMAO we got a bobby big balls over here
---
[Aslo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqgHFcmAOc)
---
While OP is still salty, the matchmaking in this game is god awful. I had a team of 15+ go against a ran 2 billy. To say it was a short match it a drastic understatement as he slugged us all.
---
PCMR has been a shitload of Plague since she dropped. But she's honestly not that bad, just annoying.
---
Like half of the killers I see in the higher ranks are Nurses. With good blink add ons she's tough as balls. Maybe it's just me sucking at dodging blinks, but I played one earlier with top-tier add ons and an Ebony Mori (that didn't even get used) and we got wrecked. Seemed broken, IMO.
---
Honestly I’ve no idea. It’s not the first time. 
---
I see Freddy as the training wheels killer, when I was new to the game he helped me continue chases that I had no idea where survivors went.
---
If you’re talking about yourself sure, you attacked me first. 😂😂
---
Now that I have your attention, did you tell him
---
You’re pointless to have a discussion with 
---
Finally, concrete evidence he went to driving school. Plothole fixed. 
---
I did not. 
---
They need to add Shrek as a killer 
---
Disappointed 
---
For surveillance go to a different gen it’s essentially an anti camping perk for killers
---
His detective hunch was right.
---
I've imagined 2 possible ways.
---
First way being some perks like enduring and brutal strength which seem almost like necessities some times just being made part of every killer. Guess they way to look at it is of the perk seems almost necessarily needed maybe it should be a perk but be a killer wide buff.
---
Then the other way which may be too powerful but interesting is keep each killer power unique to the killer but their 3 base perks are part of their kit but also still teachable. So leatherface for example doesn't have to use a perk slot for bbq and chill or franklins but they can still be unlocked and then used in say myers perk slots.
---
Again probably too powerful. Just wish they could make the killers scary again.
---
413 ping... 327 ping... 389 ping... *YES! 87 ping!*
---
Aaaaaaannnnndddddddd 3 Survivors.
---
Slowing down killers will just make looping more powerful. 
---
are u ok friend
---
So you’re just supposed to gen hop until he kicks all those gens? Then what?
---
Yep, right now the bane of my existence is all the ragequitters. Fuck you, and fuck you BHVR for not having the most basic safeguard against something that completely ruins matches.
---
It would take more than reducing speed of the killer. Survivor speed would also take a hit, pallets and jungle gyms would have to be severely reduced, and more obstruction/shrubbery/concealment assets would need to take their place. Scratch marks would need changing, and survivor injured crying would also probably require it too. In current form, survivors are pretty loud, but they have pallets to escape to. If the game were changed where it's more about line of sight, vision, and hiding, they'd have to be quieter since they wouldn't have pallets to just sit by.
---
It would require a massive overhaul, no doubt, but I'd be more in favor of making this game actually stealth and skilled based rather than who presses W the best.
---
I think there is a community of killer who hate Quentin's. You have to know how to run or hide to play him I guess
---
Latvian. 
---
LOL SO RELATABLE 
---
If you play Jake against a Leatherface expect to be camped for their cosmetic lol.  I feel like that's a thing because so few people play him and he's their hardest face to unlock.
---
Lmao, okay, I've answered everything, they're just my opinions, and if you can't tell that different people prioritize different things in this game, everyone will seem "ignorant" to you, which is sad. Let it be known, guys; If you don't agree with TheCaptainsQuarterz, you're IGNORANT AND IMPOSSIBLE REEEE.
---
What even is amino
---
i dont give a shit about ranks i just wanna yeet hatchets
---
All of the add-ons are just different food items such as "Extra spicy vindaloo", with the super rare "iridescent a-grade laxatives"
---
You’re a child I can tell 😂😂 I said you were ignorant because you didn’t even give my opinion or the original posters a chance. You shot it down said you disagree and pretty much said yours is the correct opinion 
---
Yeah, I have a feeling there is... I know some people dislike him or were upset he got in over Nancy, but I thought he was still sort of rare so people wouldn't be bothered by the sight of him too often. I try my best to be sneaky, it usually goes okay, just the hostility has risen. Shame because I like playing him.
---
Kids like me hmm, seems to me like you’re the kid due to the fact that you have so much free time to get on Reddit and troll. Due to the void left in your life from your parents not wanting you. Always trying to earn your parents affection. Either through getting in trouble or being loud and obnoxious. I don’t need the help or well wishes. I have a family that wants me around you on the other hand we can’t be so sure.

Well that's gotta be the most unfortunate thing I've seen in the past few days 
---
Baiscally a ultra glitched zoom in of Jane's ass. 
---
I haven't refused to give anyone's opinion a chance, I just simply disagree after taking it in. You're assuming that I'm reading the comment and finding it wrong/dumb because it's not MY opinon. Hmm, sounds like... I don't know, you? I don't know why this is so difficult to understand for you, man. We're clearly on completely opposite sides of the dbd spectrum, and that's fine with me.  
---
How am I not backing up my own opinion, when I've stated that I think this is mostly skill based? Come on, dude, I KNOW you read that part lmao. Stop grasping.
---
Lmfaooooo. It's like that sometimes. 
---
Yeah, it's been happening ever since the patch they added the Medium Vault animation and tried to give "momentum" after fast vaults (whatever that means).
---
On your screen you are past the vault and running; on the killer's you might only be halfway through the window. So on their screen it looks fine, on yours it's complete nonsense. which means unless you are making that vault with a LOT of distance, you're better off trying to spin or throwing a pallet. (You know a mechanic is truly screwed up when attempting a 360 is actually a better option lol)
---
4 swf is fucked on ps4. cant even get into a match
---
She looks like a tip of a penis
---
If you do toxic shit you’ll probably get toxic post chat. Just sayin
---
Damn you trump
---
Happened couple of times to me as well. Sad
---
I’m picturing Erin from You’re Next. She so badass though she’d be considered OP.
---
like.... i was rank 2 survivor before new chapter. I'm 9 now after not so many matches i played.
---
my playstyle is what they call "aggressive" cause i don't immerse, tank hits for teammates, save with BT before second stage, take aggro if someone's dead on hook, can run around the killer depending on which one it is(mostly i kite Spirits, Pigs, Doctors for a long time, not bad with Nurses). but because of new matchmaking i'd constantly get red rank killer and 3 other teammates will be of yellow-green ranks. obviously they get killed real fast so no matter how well i personally performed, the best i get is a black pip. sometimes a normal pip but ONLY if, and here is the problem, when killer i got matched with was green rank. cause there my less experienced teammates can perform a bit better and we mostly escape. 
---
but i hate it even more than being with newbies against a good killer. because i feel bad being a red rank survivor to face a non-experienced killer. it's not fun. i don't even do swfs with people lower purple ranks. 
---
so tldr:
---
they camp and tunnel so much cause matchmaking is so fucked, they're confused and just want to have fun but it's impossible cause everyone game you get certain disbalance 100% and no way to avoid it. 
---
p.s i'm a rank 1 killer and have to say playing as used to play doesn't really work. i have to play more aggressive and maybe even tunnel sometime to not lose a pip since it's so easy. 
---
and i'd love to let people go but like no matter what i do unless i get less than 3k i depip. 
---
keep telling me your version of my life story man, you might believe it one day
---
What's weird about that? The game clearly wants you to wiggle and shake that ass
---
Mine resets sometimes too and most of the time they don't. 
---
I have no idea what cause this.
---
just got to prestige 3 on my jane, have no one else to tell this too
---
I totally understand where you come from. Players like that often end up sabotaging the team as well (the unhooking loop I mentioned was an immersed Claud, strangely enough) and it becomes unfun for everyone. Thankfully I don't play like that so I think I'd be fairly safe with you, you sound like a fun killer to play against! There's nothing worse than a huge disadvantage and you get mercilessly floored, especially when you're just doing your best. That said I don't expect killers to make it easy for me, so it's nice that you have the courtesy to change the game up like that.   
---
I don't blame you with that re: Quentin, either. His OG perks are really not that good, so I can get being a bit suspicious when you finally see one. I only run Pharmacy and I'm already getting tired of it. It's a good explanation as to how killers may see me, too. 
---
I have issues with getting the kills when it's a smart SWF and I'm not up for playing at the top of my game.
---
I struggle to play DBD in general when not fully in it to be honest, which is probably why I've been playing more survivor recently since I just sneak around and hope I don't get cau-oh I spawned next to them how nice. 
---
I would not call a few seconds a massive difference.  
---
Prove Thyself will save you around 4 seconds while working with one other survivor, around 6 seconds while working with two other survivors, and around 7 seconds while working with three other survivors.
---
Well, you could
---
I do it all the time
---
Because I psych myself into fear of the killers
---
By immersing myself, especially easy to do if you fight Myers, pig, spirit, wraith, etc... usually the stealthy killers can be more spoopy naturally, but even the others can be if you play a certain way and understand how dangerous killers can be
---
I also like to imagine they will facecamp me no matter what if they find me, that also helps me not want to be caught haha
---
I've been protesting in my own insignificant way. I just play killer and have fun and let more people go then I kill.
---
Ohh you juked me and looped me for 2 minutes, good plays then juggle them free and lets run some more!
---
Look I'm a pig I can help do gens and tickle you!
---
Playing freddy and making them all stay asleep but no hitting.
---
Or I'll play normal and pick one to go free or just no death hooks.
---
Or just play normal
---
Honestly whatever seems fun that moment. Screw rank screw the broken match making I'm gonna have fun anyway I feel.
---
I generally max out objective anyway from cooping gens and I try to balance out emblems too. Plus like I said BPs aren't really a goal of mine since I have no idea what to put them into anymore
---
Keep trying to be a troll and someday you may live under a bridge
---
How does looping not help the survivors like i explainibg it a few comments away my dude. 
---
You are hereby extendingn the chase so your team can do the generators so you can ultimately win the game as a surv. I would reccomend you to read all my comments throughly to understand why looping is a legit tactic, cause it aint gonna be removed.
---
It's absolutely more impactful than you are giving it credit for.  Run it and see for yourself.  Spawning near 2 survivors and jumping on a gen immediately pops that shit so fast it almost feels like you're running a pre nerf BNP.  
---
I’m not grasping you have yet to say why you dislike flashlights or pallets yet keep trying to insult me
---
Iron will or borrow time
---
To be honest, I had this problem too, but eventually it just fixed itself the other day. 
---
So I don't have any idea what could cause this.
---
But not all people know or realise what's going on and as you said are confused and just trying to play in u balanced matches.
---
I literally just did the math. Math does not lie.  
---
And I do run it. I like the extra BP it gives me. I almost always max out in the objective category thanks to it.
---
The original poster needs validation of others to make himself feel better about life 
---
I've been running it since the rework.  They pop fast as shit man.  I'm sure you run it purely for bps...
---
Sole survivor
---
I agree with your gen rushing but about Noed you can’t predict totem placement
---
Lmao I never said I dislike flashlights or pallets, I said I disagree that there should be vacuum pallets, and I disagree that flashlights are now bad. I haven't insulted you a SINGLE time, pal. In fact, you're the one who tried to insult me, calling me a child, ignorant, saying I'm pointless to have a discussion with.  
---
Again, you're grasping, just stop it, honestly. This "discussion" is dead, and you can't accept that there's a person on here that doesn't agree with you. When you accept that that's okay, you'll be okay.   
---
Have a good one, I'm done with you, man.
---
He perk s can be destroyed within the first 10 seconds of a match, and never lasts more than a couple minutes at most. It got a buff because the perk is necessary and very easily lost which can completely change the outcome of a match
---
Definitely in anthology format. I picture the 3 original killers, Trapper, Wraith, Billy. Although I don't think they'd be the most popular of all the killers. Split into 3 different "games" so to speak. 4 different survivors each time. That way it'd be easy to please a wide variety of survivor fans. (Which I assume is majority of the playerbase.)
---
Although a DBD movie would definitely have to include Danny Glover as Detective Tapp. Even if the game doesn't have his likeness. He'd definitely have to be movie Tapp
---
Except you can. Each map has a particular spawn pattern for totems.  
---
For instance, at least two totems will always spawn near the middle of the map in the Backwater Swamp realm. You will never find less than two totems near the middle.  
---
It is also common for totems to spawn near generators, so if you find a generator, scout the area for a bit.
---
Just accept it. It must be dead you keep grasping at points that no longer exist to make you feel better on the inside because you finally think you won something other then a participation award. 
---
Have a good one, I’m done with you, man.
---
Because there's not enough people with this skill level to fill up red ranks. Most red rank survivors are sitting in purple ranks right now.
---
**-1%** for “camping”
---
This is most likely an error since you get deducted from being around a Hooks proximity.
---
For only getting 1%, this dude never camped any hook. 
---
That was probably just from him checking the area and the gaming counting it as being too close.
---
I edited my comment to show the math.  
---
And yeah, I like BP, so I run typically run at least one perk that boosts my BP gain.
---
I feel bad but still need jakes face and dwights but because jake is so rare... if i see a jake in my lobby i sometimes do it and i feel bad but not bad enough to not do it. But its okay I make myself feel better by letting the other 3 go and also dont try and get and camp him first thing want to let him get some points. And once i have that sweet face i don't have to ever play leatherface unless i get a daily.
---
That’s your choice to run that perk. Any perk you run is your choice if you lose it and can’t keep the match going that’s not the perks fault it’s yours for lacking skill. I have examples if you wish
---
Hmm that seems like a cool idea. Like after they just the power they lose it. But If that was the case where you only get 1 use or something like that then you have to choose which killer you become and I don't know how they would do that. Maybe like a wheel pops up when you hold the power button or something then you select your killer from that wheel.
---
I disagree, I haven’t ever had the same totems in the same area in simultaneous matches 
---
Funny enough I just learned about this today watching scottjund's stream
---
So you’re saying Open-Handed shouldn’t be a perk?
---
Exactly, I usually just hope they have Sprint Burst to help them get away, or Adrenaline for end game. This situation isn't very common for me so I don't run Borrowed Time, which is why I try to take the aggro, but most of the time they just tunnel off hook so it doesn't matter much
---
I never said they always spawn in the same area.
---
Always spawn in the middle of the map on backwater swamp “ALWAYS” 
---
Great, I’ll try these out - thank you!
---
She's screaming because Make Your Choice activated. Survivors scream when that happens.
---
It's possible to get a 4k without it but if you want to not be gen rushed especially if you're using a build/killer that takes more time it's necessary
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Gen rushing isn’t a thing, it’s killers lacking the ability to create map pressure 
---
I think they meant you suck as in it’s your fault you got caught in the first place. But still they should’ve been working on gens instead of trying to unhook.
---
So wholesome. So funny. This is the best gaming sub I follow. 
---
If they DC in loading screen they don’t depip. In this case OP is saying why deal with what is almost certainly a mori when he can leave the match at no penalty to him before the game even loads in.

The real problem is that the way they evaluate if someone is "good" or not is flawed. It was bearable because it was easy to rank up, but people could tell that something was wrong. I think the community didn't really grasp the underlying problem and the devs are too attached to their pet ideas to change what needs to be changed. Now that it's harder to rank up, that underlying problem is in your face.
---
(I've said it before but the problem is in the categories. In particular altruism should be thrown out altogether in favor of straight team survival. Irri if 4 survive, gold if 3, etc. If you run the killer around all game and die while everyone else escapes, you were really useful for your team and should be rewarded for it. Or the whole "lightbringer" shard is fucking terrible. If you do two gens and no one else does any, you are way more valuable than if you barely manage to do 1.25 because everyone else was able to get their shit done too. You should be rewarded as a ratio of total gens done. Or it's terrible that you get punished if you are never found, as another thing to fix. Killers didn't have quite as many issues, but that's changing now too.)
---
Chapters are every 3 months. Paragraphs just kinda happen randomly.
---
If you have "way too many" Bloodpoints, you might as well consider bringing Med-Kits instead of Self-Care, making room for other perks that way. Such as Botany Knowledge, which is definitely worth a slot when combined with a Med-Kit.
---
Iron Will is not only good if you tend to stay injured and heal off of Adrenaline, but its primary utility is in chases, making it harder for the killer to track you, allowing for more mindgames and jukes, and to potentially lose the killer. And it's especially useful against Spirit.
---
If you don't want to bring Med-Kits, I would suggest using Bond and Iron Will with your Adrenaline and Lithe. Bond gives you a lot of valuable information while also helping you get heals, while Iron Will makes it less risky to stay injured and helps you in chases. Plus you get more value out of Adrenaline if you are actually injured whenever it procs.
---
If Lithe is your Exhaustion perk of choice, Dance With Me can be a great addition to your build. Dance With Me is criminally underrated in general, making for a pretty consistent and simple way of juking/losing a killer, while being particularly effective against Nurse and Spirit, i. e. the two killers you have to rely on perks to be successful against more than against any other killer.
---
Apart from the perks you mentioned, you could also consider Hope, seeing as how it's often a better endgame perk than Adrenaline in solo-queue, since its value does not dependent on the timing of the last gen pop, and is also a more reliable way of surviving NOED.
---
I've played tons of matches where gens are completed in 5 minutes whether I was leatherface, legion, or myers. If that isn't gen rushing I don't know what is
---
Im legion main
---
also set **Digital Vibrance** in Nvidia control panel to **90%.**
---
Those who stick with you deserve the respect 👍
---
You are a bad bot.
---
Wow I wonder if you're a killer main
---
That Jake is so fucking hot. 
---
Don't you dare coming onto him, Myers. 
---
Calls me rank 10 but thinks it’s hard to 4k even though survivors are all but gutted. Stay bad stay salty buddy. 
---
He activated the lag switch. Fucking try hard.
---
While Open-Handed isn’t great, I think we need more perks like it.  More perks that combo with each other would lead to a more diverse meta.  Just making perks good by themselves wouldn’t change anything in the meta because there would always be the best perks, but if it was a combo meta then you would have to pick a combo perk to improve your other good perks.
---
wheres THE LINK
---
I got a rank 4 nurse with me and every other survivor at rank 15-16. I was the only one who made it out cause she had devour hope. I'm still proud but like dang that's broken matchmaking.
---
Literally every game ever with a ranking system is full of shitty players with egos and no matter what there’s gonna be a massive gap between real rank one players and the rest. If games like lol with millions of players can restrict the top ranks to 200 people dbd can def do the same. Anything that keeps shitty players from grinding to rank 1 and getting an ego will make the game better 
---
Pretty sure the one in the middle won in the series.
---
Yeah, I mean if s single survivor DC's, then fuck the killer because if he doesn't earn 2 iridescent then no pip for them.
---
The new ranking system is shit for both Survivors and Killers from certain aspects but the fact that survivors can prevent killers from pipping is fucking stupid. 
---
I mostly main survivor and idk if it's a coincident but I've experienced a lot more survivors DCing after the patch. Not sure if doing it on purpose just to fuck with the killer's pips or because Rage Quit. Still, it's sad to see killers getting fucked over by this shit.
---
I'd rather not have a change at all than this shit tbh.
---
Might not be thicc but definitely thick
---
Open handed is awful. Absolutley one of the worst perks in the game. If it doubled aura reading it would still not be meta. 
---
It’s doing the survivors one objective they have, so when a killer gets a 4K in minutes is that kill rushing? Like wtf?? 
---
Yea I understand the latency frustrations for sure. No argument there. This game is just badly designed honestly. This game is so damn aggravating to play sometimes though.
---
Playing a weaker tier killer sucks though against decent survivors. I can’t tell you how shitty the feeling is of having your Ruin destroyed and three gens completed within the first 3 minutes of your game is. 
---
I like how you're very formal and he just acts like a complete condesending cunt throughout
---
Why should you double pip 1 survivors DC so the hooks number despawned? This could be abused by survivors giving the killer an advantage by dcing.  you realize if they never got hooked the hooks never respawn so you have an advantage.
---
Yup, it's absurd how your own rank now depends on how your teammates and the killer play instead of your own performance.
---
You mean Michael Midget? :)
---
Yea, it’s hilarious how much people cry about survivors being op when every patch the game is more and more killer favored. Honestly until every killer has 200% ms people on this sub are gonna whine. 
---
Well as a Killer main,if you suicide on hook or DC you are fucking me out of my Devout medal. Which is ridiculously unfair that a medal is dependent on the mood of the survivors.
---
Is this PC or Xbox? 
---
Jake is like the second most used male character after David on PS4. Sometimes you even get 2 Jakes and 1 David. 
---
Ds a problem bc it wasn’t fun. 
---
Noed not a problem even though it’s not fun.
---
Hmmmm
---
Thats why they've got the febreeze on deck!
---
Honestly a lot of killer mains will tunnel and camp at the slightest excuse. 
---
Claudette? Getting camped. Good looper? Getting camped. Happened to be by a strong loop so you ran it? That’s a facecamp. 
---
At the end of the day it’s just dogshit players pretending they’re not toxic because you did x to deserve it. 
---
I still scream when she pops up :( like loud enough to give my dog and cat a spook too. Oof 
---
Ps4 personally I hardly see jake... and I also dont go after them with bubba everytime I see one.
---
Honestly I feel like I see jake on average 1 in every 10 matches. I see david, jeff, lots of nea and bright fengs and at least 1 claudette almost every match and meg somewhat often. Quinten is probably one I see the least of. Ohh and janes everywhere because shes newer.
---
But jakes if he is one of the most used maybe I'm just unlucky or maybe its a region thing.
---
Me deciding whether or not to burn streamers
---
Genrushing is actually an outdated term for a problem that doesn’t exist anymore. Since the pink add-on for the Brand New Part went from instantly completing a gen to doing what it does now, the term gen rushing should have died along with it. A 4 man team of SWF each having one instant-gen-completion item was broken, and genrushing was real. Now, it’s not. Now, inefficient killers (I hate the term ‘bad’ killers) gripe about it and throw that term around. 
---
What an experience, i appreciate you
---
This is the Wraiths cousin, *Bell Man*

---
^ This is true since the totem spawn update. The most commom being between the boat and ramp in the delapetaed looking raft. I played about 10 games on swamp yesterday and my hex spawned there every time -___- 
---
Myers would have an extremely hard time on most maps considering how tall he is, his lack of terror radius doesn't protect him from being seen. One of the reasons why his stealth build only works on ONE map.
---
I also remember a post about infinite Sprint Burst. Holy shit that must've been cancer to go against.
---
That’s not the games fault you got out played, at that point Accept you’re getting beat and go down with dignity. But either way gen rushing isn’t real it’s a term people made for when they get beat by a good team 
---
Did I say it was the best perk in the game? Did I say it was meta? All I said was we need more perks that combo with each other.  
---
I like open handed, but don’t get me wrong it needs a serious buff atm.  I’d like if they made it give you some aura reading, while still increasing the aura reading range.  And thats the type of perks the game needs to diversify the meta. That would make it so you can pick 2 strong perks or 2 decent perks that buff each other. 
---
There is nothing you can do about the meta though because there will always be one perk that is better than another.
---
I think the worst part is making the safety pip harder. I can accept making a single pip harder to attain, but to move up the safety pip too is ridiculous.
---
B-b-but hardstuck rank 10s on reddit told me killer is weak!
---
One thing I found weird in DbD is the lack of a quick stats menu. Lots of online multiplayer games use the TAB button on PC to display a stats screen. With Ranking to rank 1 becoming harder, something like this would be helpful. Showing our blood points across categories as well as the badge progress could be incentive to perform actions. "Im good in Lightbringer I should focus on saving and healing up my teammates". That sort of thing.

I take them to the hatch, I can't kill someone who's spirit is broken.

I legit just got called stuff I wouldn't even want to repeat here because I used a mori for a daily. I waited until there was one gen left, and killed someone who'd been hooked twice.

Side note; I said gg just as it started, and then continued, and was more in awe and decided to report rather than just leaving. Definitely will in future.

It matters when it comes to matchmaking. When you don't have an even distribution in each rank category, the matchmaking starts to pair Rank 1s with Rank 10+s. This is harmful and contrary to the whole idea of having a ranking system in the first place. Additionally, since there is a rank reset, even for a fantastic player, being paired up with people do don't know the game as well as you without any communication system disadvantages you already.
---
It must be region/timezone then. Because while he and David are not as used as often as the female characters, it's still more than the other male characters.  I also watch a lot of streams from Asia and UAE and he seems used quite often as well. Not surprised about Asia but there's a bunch of really good players using him in UAE countries.

I’ve had the game since October but got distracted by F13th, so only really been getting into the game for the last month.
---
I only play as Survivor - I’ve dipped into a couple matches as killer but I prefer playing on mic with SWF.
---
I’m only now getting my head around looping etc, and I still suck ass at it for now. For me, I get better practice at pallet loops in solo games because when I do SWF we’re usually up against a red rank killer and they’re basically obliterating me as soon as they engage me in a chase. Practice practice practice. I’ll get better eventually 
---
Make it harder, yes. Don't make it impossible.
---
As it stands the new pip system does not reward skill at all. If you think people are just complaining because they're difficult, then you need a psychological evaluation. This new system is overkill, broken, and plain stupid design.
---
As it stands you can get over 20k points and still not pip. You could do the majority of gens, escape multiple chases and flee through the exit gates and still not pip.
---
The game is trying to force an 'all rounder' mentality onto players, where they scramble across the map looking for a bit of everything to do.
---
Your entire team could be very good at escaping and evading, never getting hooked once. Oh sorry, that's a de-pip because they didn't play exactly how BHVR dictates, which involves getting hooked so team mates can get points from saving.
---
You managed to avoid the killer for the entire match, while proactively working on generators? They approached your position several times and you stealthily used the environment to completely avoid them? Sorry that's also a de-pip because you didn't loop around a pile of junk for two minutes as the game gods decree you should.
---
On the killer side of the argument, you managed to outplay all four survivors early in the game and down them all? Sorry, your skilful gameplay does not matter here. You get a de-pip because you didn't entertain the favoured formula, which is to chase survivors around and draw out the match into 20 minutes or longer.
---
Getting points in every category to ensure you pip is not a measure of skill. It's just a very tedious thing. Before the update this flawed design was tolerable because you didn't need to almost max out every category to guarantee a pip. Now it's completely broken, because you simply can't play like a supercomputer every game.
---
The fact that you think the complaints are unfounded makes me question your psychological state.
---
The swamp map is calling for its true master.
---
I just take care of whatever totems I come across so I can generate at least a few points since I'm going to spend the rest of the match being chased and hooked
---
No that's just survivors being stupid, 4ks never happen in minutes, unless they all fuck up. Survivors can make a Chase very long and complete gens incredibly fast. Which is generally what gen rushing is
---
actually 3
---
Alot of people get the same dailies at the same time
---
Make it harder, yes. Don't make it impossible. It's like asking a waiter for extra cheese on your pizza, but the waiter is BHVR and dumps an entire truck worth of cheese on. Overkill and idiotic.

naw I'm all for it, maybe remove the minimal hook requirement of well - 10 hooks down to even 8 would be nice.
---
After a month or so I had already gained a decent amount of knowledge. Then it was just to improve considering what you’ve learned by watching others
---
When I dc now, it's to mess with the Killers chances of getting a pip. 100% gonna dc/suicide if I get a camper/tunneler or if I get a legion or 3 blink nurse, any killer I don't feel like versin against pretty much. Since I know it hurts them and they rage pretty much every time, I just do it for the laughs, seeing as ranks now for survivors are worse than before. 
---
The Doctor is a malignant tumor to this game. 
---
As a killer main, I feel like unbreakable or tenacity are super underrated. The amount of times either of these perks could have screwed me over if a survivor were running them are countless. Most of the end game plays I make are with the assumption you aren’t running unbreakable.
---
Spine chill is a pretty fun perk to run. Personally if it were me, I’d just run pharmacy.
---
*being split open by an axe-wielding murderer*
---
“my wig...!”
---
Be quiet u fools... U want road roller thrown over your heads?! (...Not realizing Myers is currently stalking me..)
---
Not even close, killers can outclass survivors easy, some killers aren’t even on par with a rank 20 fresh out the box survivor. But that’s not the games fault. The game shouldn’t have to keep being pushed in the killers advantage because they aren’t skilled. If you’re bad you’re bad, they developers don’t need to keep catering to them.  
---
"I'm a God! I don't know why you guys are having such trouble! Get on my level!"
---
This just happened to me. You can’t move at all you just freeze I had to disconnect 
---
It isn't being pushed into the killers side because they favor killers it's probably because survivors not long ago were op as fuck and being the fucky devs they are they likely over did it. Besides whichever side is more powerful, the other side is going to complain
---
MY ***WEAVE***
---
I don’t play killer very often, but there’s one that I will do whatever it takes to kill. Blue. Haired. Feng. One deliberately got me killed in my first solo match and I will never forgive.
---
I don’t see anywhere as many survivors complaining compared to killers. They constantly bitch about this perk or that item or that pallet. The only thing I see survivors bitch about is how much of a crutch for shitty killers NOED is 
---
They should just use an elo derivative like a civilized game. Getting matched against a red rank is fine from a ranking perspective if the system actually takes that disparity into account. The problem is that right now it doesn't, and instead it penalizes you the same for losing to someone 10 ranks above you or below you.
---
That depends. What’s your definition of face camping? I think terms like camping and tunneling are liberally used by the general survivor population that essentially every trial has a “camper” or a “tunneler”.
---
Because there is a HUGE difference from a killers perspective. If you are saying they are downing their first survivor with like 4 gens left and then camping, they are garbage tier killers. If they are camping after the gates are open, it’s pretty much their only play unless they are running NOED.
---
all this god pallet stuff makes me paranoid to even use said pallet because it's so good and i just end up not using it and i die at the pallet even though i could have used the pallet but i can't because it's a god pallet
---
MEG
---
I heard that Legion is fun to play, sadly I can't confirm that since I've a shitty laptop that can't handle dbd since unreal engine 4.20 lol 
---
Actually I have posted tons of Evidence. The fact that you dislike it because it proves you wrong does not change the fact that it exists, sorry.
---
Personally I fucking love Legion, from aesthetics to gameplay. Nothing is more fun than yeeting over a pallet stab those pesky loopers. 
---
I rarely tunnel or camp people and I mostly get 3-4 kills every game at higher ranks (1-5). People would say that Frank’s Mixtape is an OP addon but I have more success with Susie’s Mixtape with Etched Ruler. Though it all comes down how good you’re as killer in general.
---
Of course there is the ”moonwalk” exploit that needs to be fixed. Using that will guarantee a down but you’re scummy for using it so expect disconnects if you do.
---
Tl;dr: buy the lovely stabby gang. 
---
The Plague replaced the Nurse as is my favorite killer &amp; now this . 😭 God is good
---
Prayer Beads, Mother Daughter Ring, along with Surveillance, Discordance, Ruin and Haunted Grounds. Get all the gen yanks whilst also playing Hex Roulette!
---
Actually you are not. By person I mean someone who is open minded and unbiased, which eliminates you 
---
Dude same! The plague has beaten the huntress for me and I'm in love with her!
---
I've only been playing for almost 2 months, and I've noticed it too, especially the last two weeks. I think the matchmaking might have something to do with it.   
---
I stopped playing survivor this weekend because I was continually getting unhooked in front of the killer; because of this I decided to use  DS but it's really not good.   
---
Whenever I didn't get hooked, the killer would face camp my teammates.   
---
I went on to player killer, and I continually got rank 3-7 survivors (I'm rank 13 ) and/or players with over 600hrs playtime hours. Not a fun weekend at all.
---
Happened to me at least 10 games with the plague. There waa alwqys someone DCing or i just barely missed it :(
---
Every time I used him/her, at least one person on the other team disconnected before I could even do anything. So yeah, buy it. But be prepared for a lot of people to quit at the start of matches.
---
full exposed build looks nasty.
---
Nope.
---
Gen rush is when a SWF goes in with toolboxes hoping to get out a game asap. It's still very possible to do, you bring in one "evader" for lack of a better term, and then run the killer around for about 3 mins while the other 3 finish the gens. The other for sure bring toolboxes and a good evader will be able to fake being caught out so you dont even know what's happening. The dev's made this harder a couple patches ago slowing progress if 3 people are working on a gen unless they are bringing prove thyself. This videos a little old but it's the most up to date example of a team doing this
---
 https://youtu.be/UfRH5VzNOhI
---
Any other claim of "genrushing" that doesnt fit a 4 man doing gens this way with one dude distracting and 3 men with toolboxes on gens, is not actual gen rushing.
---
No credit to the original creator
---
Shame on u op
---
This is the only way to avoid all the hate mail. Let survivors go free, or else you're a horrible person.
---
1.Mmmm how am I the toxic one here 2. I don't give a shit i just wanted a nice conversation but you're too much of a condesending cunt to talk to normally 3. you are sweaty and toxic, that message there is very toxic. 4. Obviously not every fucking game no I dont like winning over and over that's what makes it fun, but 75 to 90 percent of the time yes that's just how that shit goes
---
on average it takes longer to find games, too! i dont know what they changed, but it sucks a lot. it wasnt this bad before the patch...
---
1.You told me to fuck off I never once insulted you or your opinion
---
2. Another insult by calling me a cunt
---
3.another insult toxic and sweaty
---
4.very rude and aggressive attitude towards anything I say
---
5.avoiding having a nice conversation with that attitude.
---
6.make false statements/lies
---
 Shall I go on?
---
I keep my messages and friend requests off i get none of it its nice 
---
DCing denies adepts because you didn't actually kill them. New Merciless doesn't matter as long as you 4k.
---
Sssshhhhhhhhhhh 🥴
---
I've had a few Merciless ratings.
---
It seems you the best way is to use an M1 Killer, with no insta-downs, and run a gen-defence build to slow the game right down.
---
I agree with you. A games progression is based on killers map pressure. This is why so many killers play Billy or Nurse. I am specifically talking about totem placement at this point.
---
Totem perks need to be more consistent. I’ve had totems last all game or destroyed at the very beginning. Killers have no control over this. It’s not unreasonable to have this fixed.
---
FYI you are clearly survivor sided, so don’t try to rationalize it by saying you play both evenly. You’re attempting to put yourself on a pedestal and give yourself the illusion you have this “enlightened” view. Just stop.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Tell me what you think needs to be done with it, I may agree 
---
I don't know man. I don't think that pressing M1 to repair a gen and crouching behind objects are the fun part of playing a survivor. Chases are fun. You want to minimize the only gameplay part that is fun as a survivor ...   
---
Maybe the game you're looking for is not dbd
---
Only if Survivors try to use the hatch right in the Killer's face.
---
It's almost as if escaping should take... skill, or something. By your logic, hatch-grabs shouldn't be a thing.
---
If the Killer's camping the hatch, go work on a generator. If they leave the hatch, carefully make your way to the hatch.
---
I don't mind losing a kill, but only when it's my fault. I can't stand losing to something which is nigh-on impossible to win against, as that is just unfair. Everything in multiplayer games should have counter-play.
---
I have the same problem. Also as Bill.
---
Personally don't enjoy them, feel their skillcap is limited to how efficiently you can exploit bleedouts, but I generally think you should aim to get as many DLCs as possible (I own all at least), if you enjoy the gameplay you should play it.
---
You never give up do you? Do you feel accomplished? Are you done? Are you really gonna keep this up? I never thought you would go this far cause you're right, I am a troll, and I've succeeded in making you so frustrated that you're grasping at what little you can in order to insult me. Again goodnight. Have a nice life. I hope you're not like this in real life, it's pretty sad.😁
---
Oh didn't know that to be honest. Maybe the killers I encountered do neither xD or they are just not that much fun
---
If there's is a post that has 0 or less than 0 upvotes, people would just downvote it without even reading lol
---
That’s the point of the meme man, lol.
---
you must play on PC. I never face Nurses at high ranks on X Box
---
That is in fact, my son
---
Thank you for posting our game from your Perspective ^^ it made my day recognizing myself from your perspective :D i thoughed this cant be me because of the Controller Buttons etc, but i recognized the part where i sllllooooooowwwwllyy turned around to you, then the part where i stood "inside" you when you finished the gen, and then the stone in front of the exit gate xD
---
 i deleted my footage sadly, except for the part where i found you two doing a totem, popped lvl3 and downed both of you. I'll send you that one tonight when I'm back home xD
---
(I cut the emberassing part out where i missed you TWO TIMES with evil within 3... you even managed to run over to the Shack... xD)
---
&lt;3 see you latee in another game ;)
---
I'm not. I main survivor.
---
If ur gonna run self care id run botany. Self care on its own is such a timewaste
---
Oh well just tried to post it but there is already 2 other posts about it

Any good killer can 4K with Freddy. I’m not sure why people act like this isn’t a thing. You can still mindgame and be good with Freddy if you’re a good killer. That doesn’t mean Freddy is good though.
---
He’s got a shit ton of problems with him. I personally find Freddy a super fun killer to play though. First thing that comes to mind is he easily, and I mean easily disrespected. People just work on gens in front of his face, run to a pallet and smash it in his face before he can even attack. Survivors at the beginning of a loop can trigger a skill check to instantly remove themselves from the dreamworld thus repeating the process of disrespecting ol’ Fredward. 
---
Any killer that has to rely on one or two add ons to even be viable needs a rework.
---
Peed and farded and shidded and camed
---
I agree about Mori to extent. I do not find it to be a fun feature to play against at all, especially not the Ultra Rare version.  
---
However, extremely few people use a Mori every single round all the time, due to it being an offering, while the old DS was almost always used, by almost everyone, especially in the red ranks.
---
**MYERS JACKSON INTENSIFIES**
---
He's literally the only "Michael" in the Game. And it shows :)
---
the screaming is a bit annoying, but other than finding survivors really easy and forcing them to play saver at pallets he doesnt do that much.
---
Add meg in there too 
---
"Near" the middle. The exact location is rarely the exact same.  
---
There's a huge difference between spawn patterns and spawn locations, you absolute genius.
---
They could get the same effect by enabling my mic when I get pallet spammed tbh
---
This is fantastic, bravo! 👏🏻 
---
It’s crazy how controversial this damn pallet is. I’ve seen survivors die before wasting this pallet. Like come  on guys, it’s just a pallet.
---
But little did you know they added bunch more bugs and glitches in said update 
---
Here's a counterpoint.  That's one of the worst suggestions I've ever heard.  Borderline delusional to think this would have even the slightest bit of balance for the game.  After killer buff after killer buff over the past 6 months when playing killer has never been easier for us you want to add in the ability to auto kill downed survivors when the last gen pops.  You say this will solve survivors issues with getting camped endgame?  Yeah you solve their dislike of being camped by simply killing them outright lol?  Like how is that a solution man?  This is seriously the craziest thing I've read on this sub in a long time.
---
Huh, the more ya know. I wasn't around much for the dark ages of DBD. During that time, I only watched the KYF videos that Achievement Hunter would put out, wherein they seemingly never discovered perks or items, and once they did they specifically chose not to use any.
---
To be fair it would legitimately look like hacks from the killers perspective
---
Can you gimme a screenshot of your settings? For  me the gamma gets rly fucked up and shit blends more than normal
---
Aren't there special contacts for kero-eyes? Like harder ones? A streamer I watch has the same condition but idk too much.
---
Because devs have obviously put minimal thought into emblem system and it painfully shows. 
---
Because of the 80 sec gens, just make it 100 -.-
---
Looool one of the very few posts that made me laugh
---
You say this and all I'm getting is salty survivor rage.
---
Playing a really dark game and having your screen go bright white is painful to the eyes more than anything, instant blinding is straight up bad for the game.
---
Being able to instantly repair 4 generators as soon as the game starts with Brand New Part might as well be saying "We don't even want to play the game this round".
---
Exhaustion allows the killer to actually be able to catch people instead of the Survivor moving at 150% for upwards of 10 seconds. If you don't think Sprint Burst into Lithe into Balanced landing wouldn't be a massive pain in the ass, I don't know what to tell you.
---
Healing Nerf is barely there if you're not relying on Self Care.
---
The biggest nerf in this game was allowing Survivors to queue up with a strategy and communication. And that nerf was to killers.
---
Except the average player is a brainlet so by being a brainlet yourself you can predict it weSmart
---
Oh well I have been called nazi by Meg when I hooked one of them in a basement and was changing one around the shack so there’s that 
---
Your face is dumb.
---
"NOED is too OP"
---
"DbD is broken"
---
"Baby killer with NOED"
---
"Uninstall" 
---
Ok 
---
Ever since patch 2.0 (clown) ive been shitting on 4 man SWFs no effort, i feel bad for survivors
---
^(ah yes I was wondering why they were labelled as campers in s-)
---
Honestly I think Billy would be mostly fine and Nurse should honestly be looked at hard due to how much she breaks the game.
---
I understand she takes a ton of time to get good with, but when a Great Nurse player basically makes the Survivors have no chance, it needs looking at.
---
200 IQ play
---
Your first half I can agree.
---
2nd one I don't, Nurse takes maybe 10hrs until you should already be okay at her.
---
That was absolutely one of my favourite parts!! XD I thought you could have had BBQ, but I also thought to be at a "safe distance" during the hook, so you couldn't see me... I was totally wrong! XD
---
Yes, I cut both your first wrong turn and my following wrong turn: you started to turn around extremely slow, building up the tension; my Meg almost talks in my game play like she is saying "oh.. Wait... Did he..SEE ME?!?!?", while, in real life, I was asking my boyfriend :"did he see me? Do you think he saw me? How could he..." _Michael runs furiously and menacingly towards Meg_ "YES, HE SAAAAAAW MEEEEEEE!!!!!" I turned the corner, but half of the controller got out of my hand as I was prey of scare and Meg crashed into the wall! Ahahahahah! I still laugh at it! XD
---
Believe me, I'd really love to see your perspective, too, and if you want, I can send you this video, too! :D
---
Keep up the good play, Myers! :D 
---
This is really arousing.
---
You're barking up the wrong tree man.  I'm a killer main.  An objective killer main that is capable of seeing things from the other side.  I don't know how you can sit there with a straight face and think that we should have moris included in our base kit.  We don't need any more help dude.  We are more than strong enough at this point.  The days of the survivors being op are done.  Games even against swf's are ours to win or lose at this point.  If you can't see this I don't know what to tell you.
---
ENHANCE
---
Hate to be that one guy, but doesn´t the schackles add-on remove the phantasms. 
---
More like playing against waterlogged shoe and butchers hand.
---
At least the old ranking system ensured the people I played against were either mechanically strong or experienced from the hours in game. Nowadays in my rank 3 matches i play against purple ranked survivors all the time, sometimes even straight greens or a rank 15.
---
What will make people like you happy, when survivors spawn on the hook? This post is ridiculous and should go down in some sort of hall of shame.
---
maybe you're better at Solo Games!! :D
---
Meg. It’s always a godamn meg 
---
Plåg ?
---
Billy can apply huge map pressure but could be bullied is chases. Spirit can do well in both. 
---
Everyone in this subreddit thinks the other "mains" are toxic as shit, their side is underpowered, and that Shirtless Myers is funny.
---
The only thing I need to investigate is why I expected more than the few of the actual reasonable posts I've gotten, since 90% of everyone replying in this thread is "This is bad and I'm not going to give a reason why I disagree with you". If you're not going to give me a reason why, you're not giving me a reason to change my opinion.
---
There’s something wrong with that player because o would’ve one for the 4K
---
Because people would abuse the fuck out of that to kick SWFs
---
Unrelenting?
---
With 115% movement speed and an easy instadown if you’re getting bullied as billy it’s because you’re bad as billy
---
Cleanse totems before the end game. It cannot spawn if all dull totems are gone. That's the fuckin' counter, ya genius, and it doesn't take nearly as long as you think it does.  
---
Take it from someone who actually does it. Learn the maps. Learn the totem spawn patterns on said maps. It should come naturally.  
---
Also, the fun lies in the satisfaction of properly countering the perk. You didn't get to have that satisfaction against the old DS.  
---
Also also, you are playing the game completely wrong if you think totem-hunting involves doing literally nothing else. That's inefficient as fuck, my dude. Play the objective, and cleanse any totem you stumble across.  
---
If you are straight up ignoring totems because "it takes too long anyway," it's literally your own fault. NOED is not a punishment for doing the objective, it's punishment for your laziness.  
---
If you refuse to cleanse totems, you are a detriment to the team, yet it's the killer's fault for using it, or the devs' fault for implementing it.
---
"In the basement..."
---
In theory I agree 100% but the game is so fucked with its current patch right now that I promise most of these people aren't DCing on purpose. This garbage patch is disconnecting people in the load screen, I don't know about ps4 or PC but this last update seems to have decimated the player base on xbox, between long queue times, glitches, new bugs, and involuntary disconnects who can blame them for spending their money and time on something more polished and deserving. Perhaps with servers or even a reversion from this patch I'd agree to harsher DC penalties but as of now doing so would only push more people away.
---
In the corner of the map, even though its next to gen I'd say it's a pretty good totem spawn compared to other's I've seen
---
That fucking nodding is glorius
---
I'm into it
---
Maybe that's why I added the words "under certain circumstances"? Like having a high ping over a certain amount of time unlock a kick possible action. In that way killer choose to play in bad conditions or not
---
Looking at this made my eyes water
---
How about a sign like for kindred? Showing everyone "this guy can unhooked himself, no need to rush"
---
I was going to suggest a killer idea of the killer being able to posess survivors into deadites for the new killer. Maybe they will go into like a flying fast freecam mode like the movies and be able to go into someone. I know they said no flying killer but I feel that won't really count completely as a flying killer.
---
Well if you can get easy instadowns on survivors without addons then you are not versing good survivors. Good survivors will left you no choice but to M1 hit them, and even with enduring+spirit fury you’ll have to eat shit ton of pallets if you are on farm or autoheaven. Spirit on the other hand doesn’t care about pallets because she can easily mindgame them and end chases in 20 seconds. 
---
Jesus man you really don't have a firm understanding of this game do you?  I was referring to a Leatherface Facecamping endgame.  There is no dodging his saw.  He stands there in front of the hook with his saw charged.  The moment anyone is suicidal enough to start the unhook animation he simply downs them and the person they may or may not have unhooked at that point (depends on if the animation even finished)
---
You are assuming the survivor is on their third hook.  Why would they have to be on death hook.  Survivors get endgame hooked for the first or second time routinely meaning there is an entire phase or two to attempt a save.  Hell you might even prevent the hook entirely with either body block plays or flashlight save etc...
---
I know considerably more than you about both killer and survivor play I saw your ranks below.  While I'm a rank 1 killer main I also play rank 1 survivor every month and I agree the killers shouldn't use NOED at that rank but they so fucking do lol.  It's quite sad actually how common NOED is across the ranks.
---
By making a play to save a survivor they aren't dragging out shit, they're attempting to save the teamate so they can all bounce.  It's called counterplay but you want none of that you simply want kills handed to you on a silver platter.  Seriously man you really need to play this game more because you are just not grasping the concepts here.
---
First of all I cant speak for console as I value my precious frames and my mouse and keyboard, but if you say you guys got Doctors at the high ranks it must be a wild land. That being said from a PC standpoint I can tell you that Freddy needs some work. 
---
Lets compare him to Trapper, probably the most basic killer in existence. 
---
If you see a survivor as Evan you can shmack them, shmack them again and hook them. As Freddy even if you see a survivor you need to wait 7s to even harm them, in which they can run to a pallet, a loop, a window or just away from you, which makes an open exit gate or the hatch a death sentence for you in endgame. 
---
In the chase Trapper has base movement, terror radius and lunge plus the addition of bear traps to instantly end a chase in the wrong spot. As Freddy you have NOTHING and by that I mean it. the only thing Freddy has is possibly a hit out of sleep when you can effectively mess with the transition, but even then there are four other killers who can do that twice as good (Wraith, Pig, Myers and Spirit)
---
As for tracking that might be the only quality Freddy has over other Killers (except Doc). However if somebody is asleep and you arent going after anyone else specifically, survivors shouldn´t get outside of your terror radius. So even that is somewhat mute.
---
In the end, it´s your opinion and if you think Freddy is fine than thats okay. I just wanted to clarify these things since your argument was mainly just "people make him work so he must be good". Maybe if we get more reworks to the weaker killers like LF, Doc and Freddy we might get some varietyin the higher ranks.
---
Killer finds the IP of a member of an SWF, killer sends packets to make ping rise, killer kicks SWF member. 
---
They are going for the window or around the corner, that’s enough. Must be hard for you to admit that you are not good with Billy, survivors you are versing were just bad, huh? 
---
WE NEED FRANKLIN, just try and catch me in his wheelchair you ugly cannibal (jk you’re beautiful bubba)
---
Its more of a headache to do this I think then just having them undo the changes they made that suddenly saw most of us getting matched with high pings.
---
However I feel nothing will change and they will just tell us wait for dedicated servers.
---
Too much work... if someone’s willing to go through that much trouble to not play swf, they will just leave the lobby and remake 
---
Well as you probably see, not many people particularly like this idea. 
---
The reason being that granting killer Mori's at the end of the game would incredibly buff killers to the point of being significantly easier than survivor. To the point were playing survivor would be unappealing.
---
It presents the same issue as NOED but worse. It rewards the killer for not being able to protect the gens &amp; punishes survivors for getting to close to the end game. Except in this chase its uncounterable.
---
If combined with end game perks like fire-up or remember me, the end game would be a guaranteed win for the killer. 
---
Killers that are half decent at the game would easily be able to win the game. Even in the worst of games it would mean a killer is guranteed atleast one or 2 kills. 
---
This would also remove one the most intense parts of the game where survivors have to choose between leaving early or saving a hooked survivor at the end of the game. For killer it would remove the pressure of having to use a hooked survivor as bait for the other survivors. 
---
Overall this idea would totally break the challenge of killer as it would be too much of a reward for killers in the end game. If you want to mori survivors without Mori, use devour hope &amp; pray that survivors don't find it. 
---
Yeah I was like "is this the same issue like the GTX 970 4GB", or why does that message pop up? Already contacted support and they said that someone else is going to contact me to resolve this issue. It's been 2 weeks now and nothing...
---
That's A fat Nurse Lmao
---
well I must add: it only works on infinite loading screens. If your game is in a frozen state, you still have to suspend the application. Have fun o/
---
I want to win and I will use the tools I have in order to do so. I won´t actively try to bully or annoy you and I will still wish you a gg in the end regardles of how I did and if you do the same I´m happy. Can that mentality be a thing for once?
---
Yeah the problem with fixing/reworking Gens is that you can’t change much without it being a huge game changer.
---
But there definitely needs to be more to Gens than just sitting in front of it and holding M1. I’d love to see mini games/skillchecks that were more interactive or difficult. Unless you’re scratching your nose/distracted an average player wont ever fail a Skillcheck. I’d like to see the Skillchecks sizes random as well as when they pop up. 
---
If you have trouble because they get out of reach, try to use charge time addons, as well as trying to track the survivors. If you realise that they may get out of reach, don’t be afraid to put your chainsaw away and use your mallet.
---
So every survivor I verse is bad? When I play at purple to red ranks? Also run bamboozle and windows aren’t a problem 
---
We need to give the plague a Shrek skin. 
---
I can never find the last one on the new map so i hope my team got it and they never do 
---
The new ranking system is weird, I'm at rank 10 and I feel like I'm in like 3 or 4. I know they changed it, but yeah 10 is the new 4 I guess
---
I don't even understand why people playing for their rank O.o
---
Quentin looks normal
---
Why would I mori endgame unless no one else is left in the match... lost count how many times a hook end of the game made good bait and spiraled into another kill or 2. Amd if that's the case I'd just run a yellow mori.
---
I kind of understand what you are going for in this case but I'd have to disagree with it being a good idea.
---
Man you really are kind of rambling incoherently at this point, the first half is difficult to decipher what point it is you are attempting to make.  You just mimicked what I said then went off on an odd side tangent about unrelated things.  
---
Of course you're a god at this game you just choose not to rank up he typed convincingly....also did I just catch you say you dc on survivors after completing your daily?  If so that is pure trash move right there.
---
Then make sure to NOT get downed by NOED
---
Yes I do agree that very high tier suvivors can give him trouble, I find using the mallet and brute forcing pallets out works well against them.
---
So you are able to chainsaw every survivor in every game? I call bs on that :) and yes, 90% of survivors are potatoes in all ranks
---
Okay but this lowkey made me laugh
---
That actually sounds like a fun idea, I’ll try it sometime 
---
I never said every survivor. I said if you get bullied at Billy, or any killer really, you are bad.
---
Also as I said: he can instabreak and use this to catch up to survivors quickly
---
BHVR: Pretty good job! Here, have a safe pip.
---
I agree completely, my issue is that he’s placed, UNDER other 115%’s
---
Exactly this if they can't tell the difference of how someone d/c with the current problems half the remaining player base would be banned with in the week
---
This was literally me playing with the people who got me to buy the game when I was on my first day, I'm like "Holy crap is that Myers?! Cool! But why's he just standing there looking at us?"
---
*"MOVE YOU IDIOT"*
---
r/TwoRedditorsOneCup
---
LMAO Is that possible
---
Sure. My point was there's no shame is getting killed by such a high rank. OP made it sound like he only lost because he was tunneled. 
---
Same here.
---
After I ran around the killer for 5 gens two times and lost a pip both times it made me more happy. Finally I can get to the lower ranks and run around inexperienced killers, never had so much fun :)
---
We should have the option to remove the heartbeat on our end as survivor if we want to make it harder and more jump scares for any killer.
---
I played against you at one point, birb! You morid me too. A death crusade indeed!
---
Good job!
---
You sound like someone who plays instasaw Billy and thinks he’s good. So salty when pointed out that you’re wrong. 
---
Or maybe you shouldn't rank up if you don't face challenging survivors. Surely those weren't rank 2 and 3 survivors you wiped out before they completed one gen. 
---
The problem is that the emblem system measures how much you do specific actions. Not if you are successful (skillful) or not. It's like measuring rank in CS:GO by how many meters you run each match. Doesn't matter how the match goes...
---
no, i’m not part of the problem.
---
For sure. People seem to over exaggerate how weak the weaker killers are. Bubba and the others are by no means unplayably bad, just not quite as strong as the best.
---
I usually play drift king but okay
---
I just said in another post they should give survivors an option to turn off just heartbeats for all killers. That would up the scare factor and personal challenge but not force the change on others in the match who don't want it.
---
Not a big difference honestly :)
---
Unnecessary comment 
---
That’s what I was saying. I’m saying killer isn’t hard at all y’all are whiny people. I wasn’t judging the survivor side, you should calm down and understand shit before writing it down. 
---
A lot of the DC‘s happen because the game crashes randomly, had this happen to me and my friends multiple times since the last patch. We all have good Pc‘s and a stable connection but this game only loads when it feels like it.
---
Also can you imagine  the frustration of sitting trough 30 minutes of buggy loadingscreen hoping that the game will start one day, only to then disconnect and having to wait another 5/10/15... minutes
---
There really is as one makes you turn more for better map pressure and the other one is a mallet on steroids 
---
Well it's like playing a game of chess. You outplay your opponent and win within a few moves but you don't get a pip or loose one because you didn't capture enough pawns...
---
It's Unbreakable, it increases your recovery speed while down and lets you pick yourself up once per match. 
---
Thanks!
---
You clearly are new to the game, haha. Apparently you can't chainsaw good surviors? and drift king and insta saw aren't a big difference? lol. Okay mate make a fool of yourself.
---
It's to her, what BBQ is to billy
---
Can you PM images? Because I will show you the conversation with my friend
---
I had to poop!
---
I'm kidding it wasn't me but I did have to go once unexpectedly as killer came back 15 minutes later to 4 people running circles in front of me so I smacked one and they scattered was a good laugh we farmed a little and they all got to leave. I didn't want to just d/c on them and punish them because my son woke up figured let the match go so they get something.
---
I did even better, I ran the killer for 5 gens and escaped but lost a pip at red ranks. happened twice xD
---
You can't be sure about anything, especially when it comes to a game like this. It's better to be safe than sorry.
---
Pretty good! We need a way to stop/reduce bleeding other than No Mither. But instead of an automatic effect how about it being a secondary action you can use that takes a small amount of time? If you just stand still and get the buff it looks kinda junky XD
---
My teammates were useless saps, but I guess they did distract the killer the whole game. Also one of them was completely new (rank 20, no perks or anything) so I don't blame him, I remember being terrified the first time I played this game. 
---
Yea😂 I’m on spring break so that’s why I’m staying up late 
---
Oh. They changed the perk's icon for console? Huh.  
---
I knew Bill wan't in the console version, but I never knew they also changed the perk icon. Is it the same story for his other perk, Left Behind?
---
Just imagine this becomming a feature
---
Thank youuuuuu!! ^ ^
---
I took ur advice :)😂
---
Imagine creating fake accounts to participate in internet discussions and calling someone else a fool. What an irony. 
---
Get a load of this nerd 
---
Best creepypasta I've ever read.
---
I believe you, don’t worry :)
---
What made vacuum so good was the amount of pallets back in the day.
---
And looping takes immense amounts of skill
---
Bruh gimme your discord I will send you proof of this conversation 
---
I don’t know why it is, but there’s just so many crybabies on dbd. Actually unreal

It may be against you moral code, but the hot topic teens get in a LOT of chases
---
I was opening an exit gate thinking, "Haha, she gave up!" Rhen I promptly got snatched off.
---
This is a lot more funny than it should be😂😂
---
I said I believe you :)
---
Wow, I've never played on PC but I'm jealous you guys have Bill. I guess that explains all the references I've been seeing haha
---
I guess it is the same for Left Behind. It's not a character perk, and the image is just of a survivor kind of crouching. 
---
Yeah nah that’s a bullshit smiley face mate 
---
I think it’s also because everyone around him is so nonchalant 😂😂
---
Keep nerving survivors until there's no one who wants to play as them. Good Job BHVR.
---
I found watching videos helped. But also playing killer helped me play better survivor as I got to see some good loops and strategies that you don't get to really see as survivor. Some goes for being a better killer play survivor see what other killers do and take a mental note 
---
I'm still average at looping and can't 360 to save my life but getting better all the time. However I don't mind being a sneaky gen jockey way better at not being seen then looping but I'll still tale the heat for someone on death hook if I'm not.
---
Ugh the amount of walking here is insane, swap sprint burst for dead hard and be a free man
---
Yeah dude you 2 GG
---
Yeah I know I just had to fuck with you, 
---
Incorrect there are still more than enough pallets on the map to devastate a killer if the vacuum was still in play.  Also windows never get broken by a killer lol.  A good survivor chains t walls and jungle gyms and uses the pallets sparingly anyways.
---
Immense amounts of skill, just wow.  Dude I can loop and honestly it really isn't that hard at least to learn the basics.  It's a little harder now with no vacuum to bail you out of every hit but back then looping took zero skill.  Just a minimum amount of practice and you get it down very quickly.  
---
With other words: regular Dead By Daylight gameplay
---
Yea i was gonna say something about that😂😂
---
Everyone is playing killer cuz theyre overbuffed, deal with it
---
I love Bill. He was always my favourite in L4D, and he'll likely be the one I main once I have all perks and prestiges unlocked (see you in 6 months lmao).  
---
It's a bit of a shame the console version didn't get him, but oh well, licensing is tough.  
---
Also, yes, Left Behind has the same story in that case. On PC it's Bill kind of crouching.
---
Had a super tense game against Doc last night.  
---
 
---
Everyone was trying their asses off, but he methodically zapped and hooked everyone with almost no gens done. 2 people left, I got hooked, but the other guy unhooks me with Borrowed Time - I get smacked and run away, but I can't mend because I'm Madness 3! I go down, so does the other guy, but further away. I get back up with Unbreakable but the Doc is back and I don't make it to the pallet.   
---
But then he gave me the hatch. What a nice guy!
---
*sirens blaring* THIS IS PUN POLICE, COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!
---
Weren't they actually trying to fix that?
---
F
---
Didn't realise it had been posted before 🤷🏻‍♂️.
---
In game, use a key to open any black lock only once. Its the exact opposite in real life. A key opens only one lock as many times as you want. Isn't that weird?
---
Nah. I hate teabagging because it’s the premise of “HAHA IM BETTER THAN YOU LOL” being into play that sucks.
---
Loop me, stun me, everything. Just be a good sport about it?
---
UNO reverse card bruh get some humility jesus christ
---
Believe what you want buddy. ;)
---
I do :)
---
I had one right there and it was glorious
---
Agreed.  I am an incredibly fair killer I like to play fun competitive games for both sides.  That being said if you BM by teabagging midchase or flashlight click spamming you have forfeited your right to a fair game.  Just say no to BM people.  It's toxic, immature and causes good fair killers to punish your ass with camps and tunnels.
---
That's some prestigious thiccness right there. Grats!
---
The game keeps telling me that I'm rank 1 killer even though I'm rank 2. The only time it actually says the rank I really am is on the pip screen.
---
Killers collision needs to go, I agree.
---
But he had Enduring, didnt he? 
---
&gt;  stun time
---
The killer had enduring?
---
Ive played both PC and console, you kinda get used to the framerate
---
I mean, neither are that great, but Sharp Hands Joe is worse. 
---
Always worse. 
---
I've always been a killer main but I simply can't get a proper lobby as a killer :(
---
ROCK HARD
---
Basically summarizes 50% of my matches, except for me running the killer around for a few minutes after the last gen, without any pallets left and get noed camped
---
Just had an Urban evading brown shirt claudette on my team, killer was chasing somebody on the other side of the map and that piece of shit was just crouching behind a rock waiting for both of us to die
---
Isn't there a punishment of 2 pips down already? 
---
Lol okay
---
I agree, that would be cool 
---
Adrenaline should be mandatory past rank 20. Also Kindred in theory is great but in practice it just makes your teammates go full kamikaze to see who gets the unsafe unhook. 
---
Change that and Sprint Burst for Lithe and Dance With Me. Just find a window and vanish.
---
Lol yeah, you replied to me in the other post as well.
---
I agree, that would be a slick option to have haha
---
In all my days of experience... 
---
Is there? I don't know anything about this.
---
Hard to swallow pill: Stop being entitled and accept that OP’s right :)
---
I play solely Legion and I just love it. Yeah, it has its weak points and although people complain about his Feral Frenzy, on PS4 that power can be easily exhausted due to the controls at that speed.
---
I play the game quite fair, make it fun for all and still get hate messages, people just like to hate on Legion. I don't get DCs though, so I must do something right :)
---
Well, he must had been salty
---
That actually a really good passive and fits her well!
---
Totally agree 👌
---
I finally got my Adept Freddy achievement this weekend. This scoring system was so much more demanding basically requiring me to juggle people around more to keep people off generators but thank god Freddy’s addons carried me through that whole time. Those Dress addons make all the difference in letting people go while I was chasing someone else. 
---
to add to this I was thinking at the minimum survivors should get a passive or bonus when they are in a trail against their killer..  
---
I've this many times with other survivors 
---
I’m a survivor main and even I think killers shouldn’t lose a pip if they kill everyone in less than 5 minutes. I stopped caring about ranking up a while back but my only complaint about this new ranking system is that even if you escape the trial you’ll still lose a pip if you didn’t play a perfect game, I think you should at least safety pip for escaping. I’m all about going for saves and getting chased but if someone beats me to the save or I don’t get found all game for whatever reason, I shouldn’t get punished for that. I’ve had matches where a random or even me runs the killer all game which isn’t that persons fault if the killer decides to stay on them, so everyone else just does gens and we’ll lose a pip because we only did gens and no one got hooked. Both sides get punished for being good......like what is that? Lol
---
Yeah but that the only way to make it balanced.
---
A good solution to this is to make the Lock-in system only available to rank 1-14 or something like that.
---
At the risk of dividing the player base you could have competitive and casual where competitive effects rank and requires lock in while casual does not effect rank. 
---
Like Distressing in reverse, reduces the range you hear the terror radius, get more blood points.
---
A fellow member of the community suggested a competitive and casual modes where casual mode doesn't require lock-in and doesn't effect the rank. While competitive mode requires Lock-in and effect the rank!
---
I believe that is the best solution to this!
---
Shit happens u.u
---
No bill on console.
---
I would pay money for that.
---
That happened to my friend 
---
Nice Job! Here’s a silver lightbringer
---
Aw, what a shame that we can't vacuum through pallets anymore or refresh Sprint Burst in the middle of a chase, Killers just get all the breaks. :(
---
Queues for survivor take about five minutes and killer takes about two. I'd say its pretty quick rn BUT I am a rank 1 being matched with rank 7's and 9's... can't really say its good.
---
1. If you're "not beeing racist", why use a racial slur?
---
2. It'a because they can't maintain a connection. They don't choose who they connect to, after all. Even if they could maintain a connection, why would they want to play a laggy match?
---
&gt; You farm your teammate? I will chase you down and I will not stop until I kill you, because I know exactly what it's like to be on the receiving end of that.
---
Amen. 
---
I will shut that shit down, no exceptions.
---
I tend to carry the last survivor to the hatch when the game was good or mess around when something funny happens, so it's mostly just thank you messages or some laughs. It's pretty funny though when you get alternating messages between getting thanked for not tunneling or camping and then insulted for apparently tunneling and camping. :D
---
I am kind of glad there is no ingame chat though, because I think people still have a bit more restraint using the PSN messages. And when you get a really heavy insult, the PSN reports actually work and can have drastic consequences if needed.
---
Same. Lobbys are so broken on ps4 
---
It's hilarious watching the two of you bitch about the same shit you say Killers do with absolutely zero irony.
---
Which is COMPLETE horse shit if you ask me. Getting a 4k is tedious enough at high ranks but now I have to go out of my way to give the survivors MULTIPLE chances to do gens but also try to prevent them from finishing them so I can get the 4 iri emblems and THEN I have to slug the second to last survivor to guarantee the 4k. I'm just glad I have every adept except plague already, if I didn't I'd be crying.
---
Rusty shackles does remove phantasms, but you can still teleport to the trap if a survivor has triggered one. The survivor won’t be notified that they triggered a trap at all, i.e. hag phantasm popping up with the terror radius. Combined with the add on mint rag that gives you the ability to travel to any trap, it’s insanely powerful. The other two add ons you’re talking about still spawn phantasms but instead completely disables the hag’s ability to teleport to those traps with the benefit of inflicting hindered on survivors who triggered one. 
---
IMO, I love legion. He's the first killer I maxed out. I love the fast feeling you get while in feral frenzy and I love to make it even faster with bamboozle. The only problem is that chases can get long sometimes. Overall, he's still a really fun and good killer.
---
Nothing better than laying the smackdown on a baby back bitch.
---
To be fair, if the nurse is good enough so you can't avoid her match probably won't last long enough for NOED to activate. 
---
I fap to that
---
Honestly the biggest challenge in my experience having just gotten it is preventing the gens from completing. You cant double pip and get merciless without preventing at least 3, maybe 4, gens from getting done. I was super close to double pip with a 4 kill multiple times but it was ALWAYS gatekeeping that kept me from getting it until I ran into a team that didnt do any gens and just kept running into the basement. *shrug*
---
Don't worry, it's supposed to be that way
---
I swear leatherface was introduced to the game JUST so they could sell bbq and chilli. 
---
First off there was no map with him on release. 
---
Secondly, there was no survivor with him.
---
 And Finally, he is the simplest and most 1 dimensional killer in the game. His ability downs people, thats it.
---
 Whether hes a good killer or not, I find him very simple and boring, so for me it was basically £4 for one perk.
---
Just how some people play, I understand its the point of the game but fuck me it’s boring when the match is over in under 5 minutes 
---
We usually hang around, get stacks and chases, anything to keep us away from that waiting screen. 
---
Haha yeah xD i AM everywhere.
---
Stalking.
---
(Don't look to your left. I warn you.)
---
This is true, but sometimes you receive unwarranted toxicity. Because some players are just assholes like that.
---
Took me about a month to actually understand everything in the game (perks, scratch marks, maps, etc,). After that, I learned some stuff from being looped by survivors when playing killer and the rest from YouTube. Would recommend to watch a video on the different type of jungle gyms and loops.
---
Anybody else make airplane noises in their head?
---
Or make a new game mode
---
Perfect example; just had a game where I did probably 60% of generators, tried my best to keep my head down and help survivors where I can. I'm the last alive, get carried to hatch (don't struggle because I know killers hate that), it's basically in the basement shack, he stands there waiting for me to struggle, I struggle because I'm getting over it so he starts taking me down, I stop, he waits at the hook for me to struggle again before hooking me.  
---
Like why, man? I wasn't rude to you all game, I already knew with the new ranking system you wouldn't give me hatch, so why waste my time? Just hook me and get it done. I just feel punished when this happenes. 
---
Add on
---
Nyooooooom!!! *airplane noises intensify*
---
"Gotta go fast!" -Ace Visconti, probably
---
It's an add on. 
---
Along with cutting the guy who almost got farmed a little bit of slack. 
---
It always hurts the killer if they do that. Got a REALLY bad doctor yesterday. Had to watch a feng die on first hook after she ran him for a gen, tried to get her but no BT, so that didn’t go well for me.
---
Rofl omg. He is billy Myers 
---
This close to running like Naruto
---
Haha i love that you say 50% of a normal persons. I think we should all play both sides so we can properly critique the balances of this game
---
The hidden meaning is NOOB
---
BHVR should implement choosable poses and running animations just for this 😂
---
Alright sure I mean who needs 200h on a killer when somebody on reddit explains it to me anyway. 
---
No offense but that´s the joke I made. Ever got into the basement with a hag using these two addons?
---
She moans so loud and for so long whenever she gets smacked. Noticed that yesterday
---
Behind every Killer is a human being, not an AI. It is only logical to go for the weaker target if you have a healthy and an injured Survivor running from you.
---
Even better, I mean who needs mor than 1,5s to warp away from a killer right. Right?
---
Yeah and if what you said was a joke it was absolutely terrible. 
---
Pretty sure that's normal? Why would you have access to the killers if you didn't buy them?
---
GOTTA DO EVERYTHING!
---
When the person you unhooked is running all the way around the map so you try to get their attention to heal them
---
That's why I think that perk is horrible, especially with Ruin. It's just a reason to go after totems. If people just avoid you long enough, it's essentially a wasted perk slot. 
---
And that was one of my better ones so if that tells you anything about my standards when it comes to humor.
---
1. Yes, I want it more in the Killer's favour (btw, I play both sides equally), but since the hatch is currently completely Survivor-sided, this is called "balancing".
---
2. My change doesn't *guarantee* a 4th kill. If the Killer isn't close to the hatch, you have more than enough time to jump through safely. After all, if the Killer's post-attack cooldown is 2 seconds, then jumping through the hatch would only take 3 seconds.
---
3. If the Killer is camping the hatch, they aren't patrolling gens. If they're patrolling gens, they aren't by the hatch. Play it smart and wait for your opportunity to escape.
---
4. Currently, hatch standoffs are in no-one's favour. Whoever blinks first loses. Definitively putting it in one side's favour removes the standoff entirely.
---
5. Killers *can* find the hatch first, but are often busy chasing Survivors and patrolling gens. Killers have little-to-no downtime in a match, whereas Survivors have plenty. Enough that they can search for the hatch while the Killer's busy. Plus, even if the Killer knows where the hatch is, see points 2 &amp; 3.
---
Would be good but he ran noed lmao
---
Clearly 🙄. 
---
Lmao “that’s silly” 😂. Goddamnit made me chuckle
---
Much scary, very wow
---
Or Head On?
---
I agree, buuuuut come on, we would have all attempted to Thomas around the map at LEAST once
---
I’ve seen killers commonly do it on maps like haddonfield, which to be fair is one of the worst designed maps. 
---
OP I hope you and they Freddy talked that shit out in post game chat because I would’ve been mad as crap if I encountered such slippery meat.
---
He sure does have a really confident stride.
---
I dont know man, I think its extremely suspicious that people only disconnect when I down them or pick them up 
---
Sabo time
---
*new and improved* maybe they're just preparing us for the shit storm servers are likely to be?
---
One of the best feelings when you see discordance go off only to see 4 survivors neatly crammed into 1 gen.
---
Survivor running a loop on the killer 5ft from a hooked survivor. “Dude stop camping wtf.” 
---
Just to demonstrate, I guess.
---
You have to buy them anyways
---
Hmmm really weird that happens to me in 1 out of 20 games 
---
Yah she's like a upgraded version of huntress to me with that 115% speed and ranged vomit that is much harder to dodge. 
---
Bro. You’re telling me. Couldn’t help but bust the meanest chuckle because it be like that
---
eye see what you did there
---
Don’t know if anyone else said it but this spot also spawns on another Macmillan map but I forgot the name
---
"It's in the map"
---
Just run the usual 9 or so meta perks and you'll do fine with her. Personally I run Ruin, BBQ, enduring + spirit fury. Alternatively BBQ, M&amp;A. Nurses calling, Ruin. 
---
Let's not forget that when survivors let their teammates die on the first or second hook, killers are also punished for it. Like, I'm not even remotely camping, in fact, I'm on the opposite side of the map, and no one is rescuing their teammate. Not only does the poor survivor get shafted, but the killer is punished for only getting a one hook kill on someone.
---
They implemented a hook camping check in the latest patch, so why is this issus a thing?
---
I like bloodhound on him so I can break the chase after hitting everyone nearby and then track the survivor who has to quickly mend themselves
---
Yeah, but nobody really sees that as a punishment, it's meaningless to 95% of the player base.
---
If you sprint as soon as your exaustion comes back, and I mean the frame it comes back, you can sprint burst withought the exhaustion icon running out. But you get exhaustion as soon as you stop.
---
I would highly recommend either leaving right after the game, or minimising the post game chat. Fun fact, you can actually close that. No one likes getting shit talked (unless you're a masochist or just have a huge ego or something). I know it's rough, and it can straight up be un-fun, but besides learning and getting better at the game with time, there really isn't much you can do, and even after you "get good" you're still gonna get shit talked. It's the nature of the game I'm afraid.
---
&gt;Have a game where matchmaking, DCs and lobby times/lobby dodging is an issue
---
&gt;Literally amplify all the issues except also making the emblem system ridiculous because fuck you
---
Lol well me and feng escaped. 2nd Claudette’s died from noed and I have another clip of our other teammate (I think Kate) killed herself trying to leave still wearing RBT and I couldn’t stop her
---
They cant
---
That’s a bit too strong tbh. I still think that it should still have some utility even after you get hooked once but this is too much for what the perk is. 
---
Enduring is meant to counter stuns, simple as that
---
I had to leave a game to grab food at the door. I recieved a de-double pop
---
Tbh it was good until the store update and since then it seems to have all gone downhill.
---
'Balancing' has been messed up, emblem system was implemented and then pipping has just been messed up in the most recent update, matchmaking has been a huge issue and we've had infinite loading screens for far too long now. Legion was clearly very rushed, possibly because of the brand new map and complicated realm, not to mention they basically had to make 2 different killers (male and female).
---
With all the new content they're trying to make, it seems like they're putting aside the things that really matter. How long have we been waiting on a Freddy rework now? Legion also needs reworking so which will be prioritised? Most of the time all that gets updated is the shop with more cosmetics to buy and I get that it's new content and different sections of the dev team work on different things but why not cut that down and put more people into actually fixing the game?
---
RRRRREEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRR
---
It's all ogre now.
---
Didn't say it's a good system, just pointing put that there's SOMETHING in place even if we still need more
---
Yup, first match as survivor I got DC. Been playing killer since then and lots of survivors have been getting dc
---
Its either get really good at the gsme and accused of being a hacker/ get shittalked about being a camper, or a little bitch for using certain perks. Or never get really good and get picked on by players that derank.
---
Was expecting to find something I heavily disagreed with, found nothing. Great list ignore the salty downvotes 👍🏻
---
I used to be a bill main, but stopped because he has no cosmetics
---
I wonder if there's a sure way to use the perk. From my perspective it works pretty selectively - sometimes it stuns the killer, sometimes it doesn't trigger at all. Even when you get to the 3 second mark and fast vault out of the locker perfectly.
---
I noticed that it happens when the timer is on 15 seconds
---
I use her as a game delay killer, and it's been working fairly well in purple/red ranks. As of present, ruin, corrupt intervention, third seal (i know, i was shocked too but it's actually been working wonders), and a third perk of choice depending on how I'm feeling. Usually it's BBQ for that bp gain, but I could also see M&amp;A working well on her, but I'm yet to try that.
---
Report message
---
What you saw right here is a person that almost met the requirements for a safety pip
---
I like to give survivors time to make sure they are ready. I ready up after a little bit of waiting
---
I can die peacefully now knowing how he learned how to drive
---
Ogrection
---
I like getting shit talked.  Makes me laugh, it fuels me in a sick and twisted way to play even more
---
Also reminds me of the old halo days in Xbox 360 or the lunch break library at school.   Shit talk was at its best
---
These folks on dbd are like little doves compared to the krakens I use to combat in the shit talk olympics back in the day lol
---
So... yeah. They can also become me and just embrace it as a third option 
---
Queue times as killer are becoming ridiculous... Before the patch, filling a lobby on red tanks took two minutes max. Now, it's an arbitrary five minutes. Smh
---
Ah, so its a masochistically induced sadism with you. Interesting, and yet I was one of the ones who refused to use a mic back in the Halo days because I did not enjoy little children telling me to kill myself lol. To each their own I suppose. 
---
Does third seal block the fountain’s auras?
---
Else ()  
---
{  
---
UnPlayable 
---
}
---
Honestly, I'm not sure. I've never asked the survs if that works, and I never even thought about it to be honest. But they all bitch about me running it so maybe?
---
Omg when the music changed I never knew the music would fit so perfectly holy shit 
---
There’s a spawn in the left hallway going towards the circle by a column
---
When I play solo I like to run kindred cause when you get hooked either no one comes for you or EVERYONE does plus if your getting camped it lets everyone else know to just keep doing gens 
---
Better yet No Mither!
---
I was playing against nurse though. I might be misremembering about the survivors’ perks but I didn’t and neither did the nurse
---
Sorry bud barley works now 
---
On Console you can see who's in your current game session 
---
Yeah that's why I've stayed away from survivor since the new patch. I can tell when someone actually DC's or the game DC's them. If you hear the death noise, then they left manually. If they DC without making any noise, then the game DC'd them.
---
DBD Catch and release program.
---
I’ve had a couple of games where people get slugged and camped until the minute is up
---
With a 20k playerbase 2 modes will be too much.. 
---
When lobbies already take 1-4 min it will be hard
---
On add
---
Eh, survivors will bitch about anything, but I think it works where it’ll block other auras but not ones related to the killer’s power. It’s kinda like how it works with pig where survivors will still see the auras of jigsaw boxes but will not be able to see other auras, such as for hooked or downed survivors. 
---
This is a bruh moment
---
Please speak English. 
---
Nooo really? I you want to tell me that Unbreakable counters slugging I will loose my sh\*t!
---
Yeah, it just seems to randomly apply Obsession to people. Just one more thing busted with the current patch.
---
Thats the best.
---
Oof, I don't feel like I bitch about that much when I play surv :P
---
But yeah, I can't imagine it works with fountains, regardless though, it's been doing a hell of a job honestly. I'm gonna try a few games changing up the build tho. See what else works.
---
So what’s the “broken” that belongs to obsession?
---
it's semi-bugged. If they're directly in front of it, it won't work. They have to be like somewhat off to the sides of the locker.
---
I’m a killer main (kind of lol) and Jesus Christ this would be bad. Honestly, I enjoy more a close end game with altruistic survivors who nearly sacrifice their life to get that unhook and get that 4 alive, then facecamping/mori-ing 1 survivor with basically no counterplay/options for survivors to comeback. 
---
It’s awful for altruistic survivors and brings nothing to the game
---
Haha yeah, I hated it at first as well. But once you get good at ducking with them back, it becomes like a second game inside the game.
---
It was damn Ecstasy if you could get someone’s own group of friends to laugh against them because you joked on their ass so hard.  
---
Anyway... yeah, it’s almost more of an adaptation because it’s never going to stop, so if you start thinking of it as that second game, it becomes funny.  For example:
---
I’ve had someone send me hatemail because I used the spirit with ruin and her dummy totems perk.
---
Made me chuckle out loud because of how stupid that was, especially when i only got 1 single down with the false totem, and it was AFTER they already got my ruin. So it was completely their fault for cleansing an unnecessary totem. 
---
Sure, I got the 4K, but it was funny that he would use THAT, of all things, as an excuse. 
---
If I took it personally, I’d have less fun. That’s not what you want from a game, so just enjoy yourself and enjoy the hatemail as though you’ve done your job correctly lol
---
LOL i unlocked it and its capped at 100 due to vsync. You trying to be smart bro? Don’t
---
Your lucky. Most of my matches i run around the killer, finally get downed, camped/ or left to die by my teammates as they sit there and do nothing
---
When the killer doesn't have ruin I will always go for the totems after finishing one gen. Then I cleanse 4 totems but can't find the last one and get hit by NOED, die on hook and get least points.
---
I agree, too bad you are being downvoted :(
---
Nothing you can do until the incompetent devs fix their goddamn game I'm afraid. 
---
Yeah, in those cases you really just have to mallet, which granted he can deal with fairly well because he’s not 110% but there’s nothing he can do about those jungle gyms beyond that, so he can be run around for 3-4 gens by a good survivor.
---
I just hope you put on an objective offering.
---
If you are commenting like 'Got Iridescent and 3 Golds earlier and no pip', please also include your rank. 
---
Aww he looks like a little kid pretending to be an airplane.
---
Hell, I’ve done it with my Feng min, which wears the bright red pretty dress. Lol, not sure how I pulled it off, but damn it if I haven’t 
---
I absolutely agree no one should take it personally, but at the same time it's a whole other beast to expect everyone to find it amusing the way you do. Credit to you for being able to do that, seriously. That's why I simply suggested that OP leave before they have a chance, or minimise the chatbox, as that's a wee bit easier than learning to adapt to verbal abuses.
---
It just seems to be giving a survivor the obsession status arbitrarily, sometimes.
---
Leatherface loves Tofu too
---
Yeah, I totally get that. It’s definitely not for everyone. 
---
Just throwing out that extra option in case they grow to like it haha
---
However in general, I do agree with you, avoid the conflict and there is none. 
---
The Plag vs The Chad
---
#LOOK MOM! I'M A PLANE! PHEEEEEEWWW
---
Ah yes the good old days! Kids nowadays don’t get how ruff it was to be a gamer and the crap we had to endure just to get it working, when we had to fight with a cartridge and they just have to download it and hit start on the controller. 
---
Give him a cane and I am 100% sure he would pimp walk towards your way
---
On Steam you can see recent players as well once you're in game
---
Wait to see how the ping is then use the lobby and loading screen time to bio or get a drink refill. Pretty sure no one does it maliciously except for last minute switchers but do people even still do that?
---
NOED + Rancor = braindead.
---
I get that you're using a full exposed build but that's still kinda noobish. 
---
okay and your point? as long as console users can enjoy the game wtf is the point to comment this?
---
this is before the recent update.
---
Definitely David for me.
---
I actually have to agree a bit with this, playing as Killer has never been easier in DBD for me, especially with the new match making.  You get all sorts of noob survivors, its glorious! 
---
Adam with his brown jacket is also immersive.
---
It should block all auras as far as I know. 
---
Another ‘reimagining’ of a classic map
---
SAME
---
His power literally encourages you not to commit to chases and instead smack other survivors, wasting their time. Thanataphobia slows the game down even further (Legion is great at getting the first hit on survivors). I run bloodhound on Legion so it’s easy to find people you’ve first hit with.
---
The idea of his power is to put pressure on multiple people, not tunnel one guy. Smack one guy, hit anyone nearby, then either follow the nearest wounded survivor far behind until they NEED to mend or try to mindgame them in a chase outside your power. You’re not supposed to use his power to down people 
---
The perfect perk doesn't exi...
---
I bet a teabagger would lose control of their body at a pallet warehouse lmao
---
Tell that to the devs that put slugging perks in the game. It's part of the game, OP is right to use it.
---
Thanks I hate it. 
---
It’s not much on paper but take into account that the slow is for mending, healing and then doing the gen? Slows the game down a lot. If they don’t bother healing that’s still fine since you should be able to find them easier, especially with bloodhound
---
&gt;!i fucking loved the fact that you can beat the final boss just by talking with him, requires something like max Speech though. Don't think you can do that in the newer games )-:!&lt;
---
Which is why BHVR is gonna need to completely rework Legion but that's most likely going to take 4 months once they announce that they are working on it.
---
The wig reveal and the wig RETURN. Nobody could ever serve boomerang wig like that. 
---
Honestly the matchmaking is broken right now, so if you really don’t want to deal with higher ranks you can wait until they fix their game (if they ever do) but concerning toxicity just leave as soon as the game is over, this infuriates toxic survivors a lot
---
Actually no at least in the perk description it still increases likihood u are the obsession baseline
---
Just find a game then 4head
---
Hello good sir how are u today. I see that u are still deleting the files from dbd.
---
Yes that's why I said make my private messages public for a bit. I had already set it to friends only, and I guess I will have to keep it that way.

OR we could have a lobby where the killer can hack and slash in a trial the size of the barn where the killer can unleash their aggression before the game.
---
Oh, I'm sorry I misread the first time. It's highly unfortunate that you have to do that at all, but with the way this community can be, I don't blame you.
---
And obviously not help your fellow survivors
---
Just simply reply salty? With nothing more to them for every reply that always works for me lol. Even if I did bad that throws them off and makes em mad lol.
---
Because its the safest pallet in the entire game and can waste the killers time. Dying can save someone elses life and buy more time
---
Then run calm spirit
---
It’s low hanging fruit humor. I’m pretty sure gender isn’t involved lmao.
---
Better embalming techniques downstairs
---
oh, i'm from Norway and we can't even carry a cheese slicer in public without having a permit for it
---
After playing 1000 hours if DBD : "Ok, I'm almost descent"
---
Holy shit that devotion 8 is terrifying lol. I would not want you as the killer in my game.
---
Just so you know is is also called the Saw chapter, so this is not the first.
---
If the killer DCs, he can cause the survivors to depip too. It goes both ways, but it is ridiculous.  
---
Waste of a perk if it isn’t Doctor or Clown.
---
i was playing swf. and it never took more than killer queues. cause maybe i'm on pc.
---
Yeh I'm more just confused as to whether this is an intended change or unintended, because i saw nothing about it in patch notes leading up to or after the release.  
---
The Dying Light obsession interaction was intended but is definitely feelsbadman.
---
not Rin and Fred, no. others i'm eh at. 
---
No. 
---
Based on the perk’s text, it makes the perk sound like the increased obsession is still a part of the kit. It would only come into play if the killer is using an obsession perk. 
---
As in, you have more chance to be the obsession if the killer does have an obsession perk rather than a random who is not running decisive. 
---
This is based off the wording of the perk though, who knows if BHVR planned it that way. 
---
So you just want to be able to use it to escape the killer when ever you want like it used to be.  How do you recommend changing it in a way that gets rid of the timer?
---
And why are you downvoting all of my comments?  It's not like I'm attacking you or your opinion dude Lolololol
---
Op, I don’t want to make it sound like I’m not sympathetic to this frustration you’re feeling but I have to ask: Would a double pip have changed anything for you? While a ragequitter does spur your victory, even more so if you’re going for an adept acheievement, but in the long run I think you’re still fine. Like that specific play should have less chance to be match made vs you because they lost two pips and you getting one more pip here would t change any ranking as you’re already in reds very comfortably. Even now you’d need 8-9 DC’s to get out of red ranks or 12-13 games getting absolutely stomped to get out of red. You’re still safe and even got rewarded for your effort. 
---
At this state of rank you’re in, what would have been the difference between being rank 3 vs 2? 
---
I think OP is talking about the lowercase C 
---
Inb4 pose only works when repairing gens. 
---
I thought knife scratches was a Hillbilly add-on
---
He's trying to look like a crow so the killer won't notice him.
---
Gen rushing is not a thing 
---
they just have to add a very fast animation like when you heal yourself that would activate as soon as you stand still. 
---
And i don't want that it takes the secondary action slot 'cause you have to be able to use DH with it.
---
It would work like head on.
---
I don’t remember. 
---
Once you get to purple ranks most of the killers will run ruin and “patrol” the first hook. Meanwhile, at least one survivor is looking to save, and the other two are either looking for ruin, pushing through it,or any combination of those, making the first hook/kill super important for the killer to just slow the game down and not have 3 gens done with 4 survs left.
---
From my experience they are willing to lose a few points on first hook so they can have a chance for 4k, which is NEEDED to pip at purp ranks, and hard to safety without 3k, so I don’t blame them. 
---
Furthermore, if purp rank survivors don’t get their altruism points, pipping is again, SUPER hard to do, so that hook becomes a piñata of rank points for both sides, because the survivors need altruism points, and the killer wants more downs/a kill to slow the game down. All in all the downside of camping/patrolling is well worth it at high ranks.
---
I disagree on her being weaker than Mike, IMO she's stronger since she can start instadowning people much faster than him, and she can stall the game better than him.   
---
I agree with the rest, though. Hag is a different type of killer, but Plague is weaker than her. 
---
The change to her movespeed while holding the vomit made her quite worse than she was on the PTB. If that change got reverted, I think she'd be very solidly top tier. 
---
the fuck is goin on here
---
Love when you find somebody who is so violently confident in their own stupidity. It's almost impressive.
---
I disagree with the never encounter the killer. Thats way too easy and means youre not helping teammates on hooks.  Its way harder to get in a chase and lose the killer than it is to just not get in a chase at all. 
---
Most people who think theyre red rank because the old system was too easy are sitting in purple* there's still plenty of red ranks out there. 
---
Perhaps you're ranked high as surv and low on killer (as you barely play it). 
---
I just gave up after waiting OVER TWO HOURS with 2 friends. This is the longest I’ve ever had to wait for a game. We just said fuck it and got off. 
---
Why should I?
---
True that
---
You didn't kill them fast enough 4head /s
---
That would make it the only survivor obsession perk that requires the killer to have an obsession perk/add on themselves.  
---
Which would make inconsistent compared to all the other survivor perks.  
---
Even sole survivor would make me the obsession before this patch.
---
Cactus Jack would be better, imo. Plus he has a barbwire bat. 
---
Have Mankind be the survivor that introduces Survivor mori's.
---
You can spin them in the shop.
---
You can spin them in the shop 
---
of course it is. my meme says so.
---
And? The other three gen rushing doesn’t make it any less cancer for the one guy going down to legions no counterplay bullshit. 
---
Okay you right, actually. 
---
Get out of me swamp dlc confirmed? 
---
The killer's heartbeat becoming erratic when you're within their terror radius.
---
I don’t make the rules. I was just explaining the text of the perk. I don’t even know if I’d call Decisive Strike an obsession perk anymore. 
---
Well. Right. 
---
Any of Laurie’s perks would make you the obsession as long as nobody else used them. 
---
Specially since there are way better (and more) killer mains than survivor mains in this game. If they were truly separated by skill level, red ranks match searching time would be 20m+. 
---
Okay, that seems reasonable. In that case I‘m considering to turn it back on again, if you say the PSN-Report does actually work... 
---
Maybe I will get some nice messages too :,)
---
Uninstall and go back to minecraft babykillerino.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death
---
Exactly that is the issue I'm having, I've had games where there has been NO reference to obsessions anywhere, but for some reason there has still been on.  
---
It just seems there is no strict rule on who is the obsession anymore.
---
No just mine. But don't worry, I'll be on the Dbd blacklist site if you want my user 
---
Did I not say I was red rank? I played plenty. I put in the massive work to get where I am am now.
---
Having the same issue on XBOX One. 
---
It takes four hits to down you in his power, and he’s very slow in without it. 
---
Counterplay: Spread out, exhaustion sprint perks, juking him as it’s hard to see in Feral Frenzy, hide while he’s suffering from going out of FF
---
Don’t get me wrong, he’s powerful, but the playstyle you’re complaining about is the  worst way to play him and there’s plenty of counters - he just can’t be pallet looped as badly as other killers
---
ngl I was expecting you to get cucked by noed and your team bitch at you

---
Chalk it up to a game bug that adds no value or negativity to the current match. 
---
I haven’t played enough of the new patch to test out every interaction. 
---
That's actually a very nice idea. Restricting the rank 1 to a few hundred players. The only problem would be lobby time. 
---
What were the ranks of the other two?  Iv'e had games where an SWF group would bring their useless low rank pal to do literally nothing.  It isn't fair to them or anyone else playing.  
---
The problem with that is if you change the animations of when Killers are approaching survivors, it will give them information when they are moving to a survivor that they themselves can't see. It would be way too hard to implement.
---
poor meg
---
Yeah, it's unfortunate that they can't release any cosmetics for licensed characters. At least there's the prestige outfit, which for me will probably be enough, as I'm not normally the type of person who buys cosmetics in games.
---
NOED references the perk Hex: No One Escapes Death.
---
When the power gates are powered, a dull totem becomes a Hex totem and applies the Exposed effect on every survivor.
---
The joke here is some people find it irrelevant cleansing dull totems being that they are not being "used", having that said, sometimes they're NOED, so when you go past them and you don't cleanse them, don't get surprised if you get downed by NOED.
---
It's ok. You'll get told you're bad at that killer even if you 4k them. Also fun is the only who guy escapes due to leaving his team to die while camping the hatch tells you how bad you are. Even if you win you lose, really. 
---
What's your survivor rank?  If you're having trouble ranking up one side, part of the problem might be a lack of experience on the other.
---
Could be the time of day you’re matchmaking maybe??
---
I had some Claudette in the fortune teller costume just all caps a bunch of racial slurs at me immediately when I 0K'd after returning to the game from a break. Not sure, uh, where all that hostility came from. 
---
He's just a lil scared of nea
---
Me neither, but you can get cosmetics trough gameplay. I am an ace main now and was fortunate that the lunar event had some nice ace cosmetics. I'm not a fan of the head piece, but I love the costume. I'll probably buy a head cosmetic with shards after I've bought all survivors (I already have all killers)
---
that perk on the left, is that unbreakable?  I swear sometimes when I see it it doesn't even look like bill...
---
No naruto music?
---
Oooh sorry, you're right ^ ^'

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=27&amp;v=p629cUMCoro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&amp;v=p629cUMCoro) 
---
SORRY I forgot the link!
---
While it’s definitely worth watching on mute, I admit the music is really annoying after having listened to it a dozen times. 
---
90% of the match he hasn't done anything other than just focus on gens and leaving. He wasn't chased. The only moment the killer had him in his sights was where he dropped a pallet early and just walked away. The emblem system relies on you playing well, as in you need to be the full package - you repair gens, you are altruistic, you can keep the killer on you for at least 20 seconds. This is just a match against a bad killer, possibly someone who just started playing the game. The ranks aren't shown at all. The Meg player has a purple flashlight and level 3 perks which suggests that they are experience with the game. They also save up their sprint burst and play immersed.   
---
Another thing is you use Deja Vu, which leaves no room to speculate whether or not your goal was just to rush gens against a baby killer.
---
So, from 5, you knowing where it is just by casually running past it is loads easier than survivors... you aren’t worried if they see you, they hear you coming  but if I’m mid chase or going to a gen I’m not worried if player 4 sees me or not, survivors are. Using this info, I as the killer use it to either bait them out when I down the 3rd survivor, quick check around the hatch usually spooks them into fleeing or doubling down in their hiding spot. I’ve got plenty of things I try depending on the survivors I’m playing against but that’s way too lengthy to go through. 
---
They are an unfortunate by-product of giving the survivors a Hail Mary, by the way making the escape 3 seconds makes it 100% killer sided. There is no way to mess up, hit once and spam click for easy grabs...
---
As of right now I don’t need to patrol gens, if they need 3 gens I can sit hatch and wait and narrow their position down very easily, some maps with raises near the hatch would make it even easier... it all ends up to can you loop the killer tip hatch safely, and most of the time I just body block the hatch direction and bloodlust if they’re getting places so it’s already an easy win. 
---
Survivor versus killer 1-1 is broken in killers favour, THATS WHY THERES FOUR SURVIVORS lmfao, how is that so hard to see? So of course forcing the only reasonable way out to be also killer favoured would be stupid. All these posts do is the same thing, whine about being owed a 4th kill and complain about the hatch and give half assed ideas. Survivors don’t always survive and you don’t always kill, it’s been the nature of the game since time immemorial. If it weren’t like that you could just mori everyone all the time whenever you want, it’s emulating horror flicks. Get over it.
---
Yea that’s cause this is on console and we don’t have Bill :(

F-F-Father? O_o
---
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!!! When are you coming back from buying the cigarettes? It has been 16 Years! Mom is always sad T.T
---
Ah yes, during the event I managed to get all cosmetics but the Ace headpiece (good riddance lol).  
---
I do like that they give us the opportunity to grab things earned through playtime, but I personally wouldn't bat an eye if all cosmetics were only available through MTX, as it just isn't something that has ever really interested me, and it generally doesn't impact game-play.  
---
That's just me, though. There are plenty of people who wish all cosmetics would be achievable through playtime. I'm just very indifferent about the subject, as I don't feel like I'm losing out on anything.
---
Genrushing only exists if it's a SWF group who purposefully all run Prove Thyself and Brand New Parts with the express intention to get generators done faster than the killer can handle. 
---
NOED is fine, coming from someone who usually plays solo survivor. 
---
Suiciding is the same as DCing basically. But at the same time, I can almost understand it if your teammates are farming or sandbagging you. Sometimes you just want to get one game out of the way and get on to the next one. 
---
DS was gross, especially when multiple people were running it. The new DS is perfectly fine and I actually really like it, far more than I ever did the first DS. 
---
Those are my responses to your hard to swallow pills. Now a couple of my own?
---
Tunneling is fine. Especially if your teammate farms you off the hook right in front of the killer. Sorry your teammate sucks, but I'm going to down the injured person in front of me, not the other one. 
---
Camping is fine if the team is super altruistic or if the exit gates are open. Or even if you purposefully have a build around it. If someone made a camping build with insidious, I'd expect them to use it. 
---
Most people who run WGLF are bad for the game. They only care about being the first to unhook, not if the person they're unhooking will actually survive. It should only give you a stack for a safe unhook. 
---
Killers are allowed to run their overpowered add ons without you having a hissy fit. Yes, an Iri Head Huntress sucks, but it's not like you run into that every single game. It's an ultra rare add on, let them have their fun with the item they only get on occasion. On the flip side, though not as prevalent in my experience, killers don't be pouty because survivors run an instaheal. 
---
Moris are fine, for that matter. Change your play style to accommodate them and you'll be golden.
---
I'm kind of surprised my opinions are more killer favored, given I play more survivor, but hey, there you go lol.
---
They don't depip unless they severely fucked it up with the new system. On the old system it would look like you depipped but your rank didn't actually get changed
---
I quit smoking, and the Himalayan ox milk I had saved for you is now spoiled. 
---
You're confused. You haven't posted a single bit of data that suggests killers downvote if someone doesn't agree with them. All you've posted is match data. And as you said yourself, we are not humoring any claims made without data, so you must provide this proof otherwise you're just irrelevant.

I love this build lol. 
---
I never noticed that Feng has three mouths.
---
&gt;What if they are running thanat?
---
Thanatophobia at full stacks (4 injured survivor = 16% reduction) will add 12s to a **solo** generator (80s).
---
Self-caring against Mangled takes 38s. I trust you are smart enough to do the math and understand the smarter play.
---
Could it include a random killer and survivor perk wheel type of think so if I'm bored i could just have it pick 4 perks for me at random.
---
I know they already exist but be nice if this site had one built in.
---
What in God’s name
---
The idea is that if you're absolutely stomping people, there's an incentive to be less stompy and closer to a likeable person.  If that's not your style though, then don't worry about pips and you're golden.
---
Also include a blank spot on the pick so even if i say 4 perks give me a slim chance of drawing a no perk for you. But allow a respin or a toggle of for that if possible just in case someone doesn't want that.
---
I'm looking forward to this site.
---
I don't know how hard this would but you mentioned a place we can store our build in a build creator. Would it be possible if say every use had a profile so we could for example track our characters. So i could say go to doctor and check off he is p3 and these are the perks he has and i could see what I'm missing as well as track what teachable we have unlocked. And then the random picks could generate from our profile data?
---
Again my understanding of this stuff is minor at best so I don't know if this would be possible or too hard for your project. But just a suggestion.
---
You’re ignoring the fact that it takes ages to down just one person if you’re tunneling, more than enough time to reach another pallet or vault spot where you can mindgame. You’re making it sound like Legion just keeps four-hitting the same person to death and throws the game doing so. You can escape him, there’s counterplay as I mentioned
---
Guess we’ll have to agree to disagree, good luck in your games against him 👍🏻
---
So if I’m understanding this right, you feel that having to hook ANY survivor after the generators are done is unnecessary, and you should just be able to mori? So if there’s 4 survivors left, and you down 1...you just get to mori them? If this is correct, that’s crazy. Just because the end game camp is deemed acceptable, does not mean you are entitled to that kill. I bring Borrowed Time for end game camp situations, but with your idea...that save possibility doesn’t even exist? And neither does a flashlight save attempt? NO. If you want to camp go ahead, but survivors absolutely should the ability to save that person.
---
Honestly its super scummy of them to stealth nerf/buff stuff they need to be more transparent about changes to the game.
---
You're right about that
---
Fair enough about Prove Thyself. I didn't realize it was that slight, it always seems far faster when I'm running it, but I guess it's just a trick of not seeing the red bar lol. 
---
it always makes me feel weird whenever i see this, it's like "HOW, SHE'S RIGHT THERE". she isn't that invisible unless i'm going crazy or something.
---
oh well, i don't need no claudette i got tapp and his investiga-, i mean, sneaking suit and i got my stealth build and itS WORKING
---
The "fuck their shit" build, one of my favourites 
---
Suiciding on the hook is slightly less bad than DCing- at least suiciding only totally fucks survivors, DCing before being hooked fucks the killer out of a BBQ stack and, as importantly, can derail the beginnings of a steamroll.
---
That's totally understandable, and your reasoning is certainly valid. Some people view cosmetics and bonus content, while others view it as something that should be part of the core content.  
---
Studios gotta make extra money one way or another, though, so you can sort of think of it as another way of supporting the devs. They aren't always doing it to be shitty, which is something I feel people tend to forget.
---
Given the variety of killers and powers and this is just a thought and may be a bad idea but maybe deviousness and brutality be merged into one category and have its limit be 16k bp that way killers with low deviousness and ones with low brutality don't suffer. I know not a fix for plague as she is weak in both but just as a general change.
---
I'd be more willing to bet on either them not playing and their rank being reset, or the matchmaking being weird. But, if a player is in a lobby where their skill level is far greater than the killers, and play at a much higher skill level than their current rank suggests, what sense does it make to not reward them for it so they can get back into a rank that they fit better into? If someone bullies low rank killers, and then doesn't pip because the killer was unable to deal with them, just leaving that survivor at that rank isn't going to fix that problem.
---
I’ll be sure to facilitate it if you do the same
---
People will just kill the process then, or pull their internet plug for 5-10 seconds.
---
DCing via menu should be supported, as it can at least ensure a proper match end result.
---
Yeah, they have a 50% chance of removing it with each box. Sucks.
---
Please make this an official emote.
---
The god pallets of the map are just pallets you should be more careful using. Don't slam it down early game unless you would be downed otherwise. Even then it might be a good idea to just take the down. Especially if its your first one.
---
Later game, with like 2ish gens left, like 8 minutes in, or if you are about to be downed for your last hook feel free to use it. Just try and use it well when you do that.
---
When the website hits live, I'm going to ask some streamers (the ones I know about and also the ones that the users request) if I can share their builds from videos and whatnot in there. Maybe if they get on board with it, they can do it manually, as I will make a option to export the build into a link that they can paste wherever they want. So, in the beginning, I will do it all manually and alone.
---
For the second part, I think I didn't quite get it. You're saying something like a add-on couting of your profile? Because if so, that's way out of my league lol.
---
I can, however since you mentioned having add ons and not, put a option to filter out add ons that you don't have unlocked yet.
---
That's a hell of a hit, I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at other then it looks broken. Was it a hatchet but without the animation?
---
Bebe Zahara Benet found mori'd
---
I think he's all in all just mad about the not appreciated effort he put in. In addition this dc's kills the enjoyability of the game.
---
I see your point though, but with this behaviour being continuously I'm adraid we'll see the new rank system never working properly/as intentioned. 
---
You don't like waiting 8 mins (it said 5 but fuck me right) just to finally use that 7.99 killer, just to have 3 DCs and massive salt mail? Psssshhhhh (srsly tho this is a bad update I've got a pic where even perk descriptions are broken lmao)
---
Genuinely surprised this match didn’t end with you getting hit by NOED and left behind.
---
I think his uncle wrote the game as well!
---
Nope.. and it's not the reason why i can only find japanese players as a killer...
---
As a surv i find people with good ping
---
Exactly, it should be difficult to DC. 
---
Haha, trust me, I've been in the same boat. It's almost a total placebo, I'm afraid.  
---
I still run it a lot, though. I really like the extra BP it gives me.
---
Exactly. Without  a fokin animation.
---
Huntress has unlocked her hidden power, the force. 
---
This game just gets more broken every dlc its like they fix one thing break 5.
---
You're running like an excited Gibbon.
---
Huntress is jedi confirmed
---
Could just as well make everything obtainable trough gameplay, people will still pay for it, but at least you give people who don't want to give out money to some optional content the choice to obtain it in a different way.
---
I myself actually don't care all that much about cosmetics and I understand that it is a part of why they can still afford to support the game, just don't place them behined a pay wall that has no way of going around
---
Pbtbtbtbtbrbrbrbrbbrrbtbtbtbtbtbt
---
explain to me what this has to do with dbd
---
It’s been harder for me to fins a game as killer, and this happens to me too
---
Yea, a DC'd survivor should just be a bleeding out slug that the killer has instant aura vision of (And auto get kicked out of a locker if they DCed in a locker), and remove the DC BP event.  You can ignore them and let them bleed out, or just throw them on a hook for more BP instead.
---
This also gives survivors left in a game a bit more breathing room, as they know the killer will probably want their hook event from the DC'd corpse so won't abuse the 1v3 quite as early.
---
*Implying you can be out of chainsawing distance*
---
*\*laughs in Susie Main\**
---
I don't think I'm shaming him. He commented me in open forum and is threatening to black list me?
---
*Trixie Screams*
---
It's not as bad with other killers around pallets. At least not in my experience. In general, yeah, it can be a bit off, but hits through pallets usually look fine for me, with every killer but Plague. 
---
Yeah I'm still confused as to why he was so mad xD Oh well, it's the internet!  
---
Glad someone else saw it too though, haha.  
---
I don't wanna blow your mind or anything, but sometimes... you can refrain from cheating... literally just so you don't ruin someone else's game! Even if there's no risk of banning if you do! :O
---
Big Cock No Shock
---
Suprise Butt Sex
---
That’s the big problem with the new system. To pip, the game wants you to do everything, which just isn’t possible most games. And to double pip, you need to do LITERALLY everything.
---
I had a game yesterday against a baby Bubba, he only had one perk and never put anyone on a hook. I ran him around, I helped do 3 generators, and I survived Unbroken. But I STILL didn’t come close to pipping because I had no way to get altruism points, and I only got silver lightbringer because I everyone pulled their weight on generators. It’s stupid that to pip, you want your teammates to be absolute potatoes.
---
hardly an attack, more of a joke. I just find meta perks boring and not fun to play with. 
---
I was basically saying 'at least try her teachables'. It's more fun than being a metaslave and using the same build on every survivor
---
yeah
---
No mither should grant bonus boldness bp,all BP increases shouldn't be capped at 8k, and no one left behind should have the BP bonus applied to the entire game change my mind.
---
The 3 second mark is pretty fair, it's the fact that there's a 50% chance it won't work even when you've executed it perfectly that pisses me off.
---
Julie 
---
I do feel like that should stop the timer if you are knocked down. In it's current state killers just tunnel then slug you untill the DS is inactive again

Tell them a random location and wait for them there while stealthed
---
Lmfao
---
Because it's not a guaranteed depip?? Yikes fam, what rank are you?
---
For starters, it's not guaranteed to be an ebony mori, or even a mori at all. Secondly, just switch your playstyle to stealth if you're that concerned about it. Finally, how often do you run into moris anyway? What's one or two games every so often? You still get bloodpoints, assuming you don't get caught in the first thirty seconds and farmed by a teammate (which is a whole separate issue.) 
---
Besides, *everything* is a guaranteed depip or safety pip with this new system, lol.
---
I've been wondering this exact thing myself. Otherwise nurses is essentially useless for Plague
---
Plauge
---
When all your teammates get theirs off on the first try, but you went trough 3 boxes and it turns out that your key is in the 4rth box right next to the exit the pig is at. The last survivor preventing the hatch fron spawning is also there. Not to mention that you ran the pig around the whole game and managed to cleanse her ruin during the 20 seconds she lost you.
---
Is this the Freddy rework we were promised
---
That's kinda how tombstone works. Takes forever to get it.
---
Just don't have secret offerings show up on the screen at all. Have them actually be secret lol. 
---
so I don't have to stalk except when necessary, lets me patrol faster, lets me catch people that are not near gens and just hiding, also don't have to stalk and 360 every couple of seconds. It shaves off considerable amounts of time from my experience in this game. Granted it was my 1st time but still. being a killer is all about speed no? And a Tier 1 myers is gonna need all the speed he can get.
---
I dont understand people. I thought rank doesnt matter yet everyone’s upset about ranking up and how they never double pip. You’re rank 3, who cares if you double pip or not?
---
new ranking system is dogshit

Slugging is just smart killer gameplay

Someone made a post a while ago posting that after testing, 50% of the players got their trapp off at the 1st box, 25% got their trap off at the second box, 12,5% got their trap off at the third box and 12,5% got their trap off at the last box.
---
They didn't post any evidence tough, so I don't know how true it is and I hope it is just a myth
---
Why does this have so many downvotes, so people not know what /s means??
---
Thanks, he actually had a big paragraph about not being proud because these people just go the game, then deleted it immediately, presumably because he forgot I don't play often, if at all. I play for like an hour or two every so often, and half the time I crash midgame ;-;
---
Honestly now that Lithe was changed I think it's the best perk choice for a "recovering Sprint Burst user." You can still reliably use it out of the chase but you can also sprint around without it activating.
---
You clearly have not seen my two posts I made before. I tested a high amount of RBT's in game and showed that is all my tests it is a 50% chance. 
---
**nurse bill**
---
Had two guys teabag and flash me all game, I was using all my items because I'm about to prestige so I was playing tombstone myers at the time. Guess who got mori'd.
---
An earlier match went by pretty bad, 3 escaped but I had the tombstone and the unlimited tier 3 so as I ranked up the Laurie that was teabagging me at the start runs towards me towards the gate instead of going to the 2nd gate for whatever reason, managed to snatch her.
---
Honestly I don't mind depiping, or getting a bad score, or even being a facecamper, so long as these people don't win I don't mind being 'that guy'
---
You should try this on Lery's (The Hospital).
---
This is clearly shaming. By all means post it so we can laugh about how he’s a rage quitter but you still need to censor his name. It looks even worse on you because you took the time to censor your own name but not his.
---
God I thought it was a gun. 
---
Yeah but saying ''ez'' after you used it like you were so tactical even though it took them most the game to use is really laughable..
---
I don’t... like u watched the whole video and said this just to make urself look smart and cool as if anyone would ever think this is a correct assessment. This is ur opinion. Basically the equivalent of the guy who gets hooked and dies first but hits you with that “baby killer” the second u get in chat. 
---
I usually do it when I know the game is over. Gotta assert my dominance some way since I can’t T pose.
---
Not gonna happen anytime soon as I'll be prestiging after I use all my offerings ;\_;
---
Woah, I’m definitely not that great at this game and everyone playing was a lower rank than me. I’m just experienced and go for the generators because that’s the main goal of the survivors. I’m not really boasting, this was just the first time where I did all the work like that and I thought it was funny. 
---
I relate so much with the time played and the crash part it's not even funny
---
I just crash before the game actually loads lmao
---
Kinda off topic but I just don't like people raining on someone else's parade when they feel proud of smth. 
---
Also just realized your ingame nickname and got the reference. *Genious.*
---
360s are still around. 
---
My saves have been fine. 
---
Brand new ranking system came out this last patch. Don't expect to double pip, and it's quite difficult to pip at all. They still reset. But you also get matched with ranks all over the place so the system still doesn't matter.
---
Hillbilly, Nurse, and Spirit are all high tier (unless you're on console, in which case Myers probably takes Nurse's spot.) Huntress, Plague, and Hag are in good places as well. Wraith isn't bad because he got an add on overhaul and a couple buffs. Freddy hasn't really been changed. Any killer can work though. 
---
If you used Decisive Strike before, it's been totally changed, so make sure to read up on it. Self Care has been supremely nerfed and takes forever to do. Along with a bunch of perk changes, but those seemed the most popular changes. 
---
More likely a bunch of people who play the game badly downvoting me because I struck a chord. ;-)  
---
If your not gonna be merciless then be friendly and don’t kill anyone at all
---
👉😎👉
---
Bond over Self Care? Yep, it's a braindead reddit build 
---
Ew
---
Agreed. And even if the killer does pick you up, the stun from a successful DS hit is hardly enough as the killer is right back on you anyway 
---
I didn't criticize you, I meant the guy crying about not getting pips for that and blaming the devs because they changed the emblem system and now you don't pip up for just playing the game as survivor and not getting sacrificed in the first minute.
---
Thanks for attacking my already low self esteem
---
Well he's a survivor of a horror movie and a pretty good one that's all I need
---
I feel this so hard right now. Especially with me being the only Rank 1 Survivor in a pool with Rank 15's against a Rank 4 Killer.

---
Wait you can use them? Are they gonna put him in the game?
---
If the killer DCs just as the game starts or a little bit into the game all 4 survivors will depip. 
---
The answer is to derank even more.  
---
Btw, if I see a fourpack of trolls playing at 15 I just dc. I.e. They are all swarming in a group in the first 10 seconds and standing 10 feet away at all timed.

---
Easy breezy new game done
---
Wait time is mostly the same, so who really cares.
---
Also this is probably to prepare the game for dedicated servers
---
Enduring should really only effect pallet stuns imo.
---
Sounds fun but hard pass, they can't even release patches to their buggy updates that don't cause new and *fun* bugs. Maybe in the future if they ever correct their coding and don't sink the game with their incoming servers.

Definitely; M&amp;A has improved my games with her considerably, since she needs to catch people out of position to get an instadown.

And Mike is definitely more stealthy, but more pressuring? Only really at T3, and he needs time to get there. I still think that Plague is stronger than him, but not by a lot.

Not everyone has deranked on purpose to bully bad killers. I have over 1000 hours and am sitting at rank 14 because I don't play a lot survivor so I never rank up that much so the monthly rank reset hurts me quite a bit. The problem is, currently my teammates are usually quite good (not my choice, I'm playing solo) and the killers quite inexperienced (rank 18-20 is what I'm getting mostly). At best they get a single hook, sometimes they can't even hit anyone the entire game. The result is always safety pip, so I stay where I am and must continue to play boring games against new killers who should be playing lesser skilled survivors.
---
Had just right now another such game against a rank 19 Hillbilly with a single tier 1 perk. One hook all game. I've had a "heal teammates for 3 health states" daily for five days now and I'm still at 0/3 progress because so few people are getting hit in the games I'm in. That's ridiculous, but BHVR tunes its rank and matchmaking system more and more to create such boring matches instead of exciting ones where actually something happens (unless you can pour in enough time to rank up fast enough to be out of the range of inexperienced killers after rank reset). With the new higher requirements for pipping and the still monthly rank reset, I fear it'll just get worse and worse month by month.
---
I know your experiences though. When I started playing killer after a lot of time of playing exclusively survivor, I got totally wrecked by "strong" teams on rank 20 already (that was before ranks 16-20 were "reserved" for new players). I'm not the best player either, it takes me quite a while to become good. The only option was to watch good killers on Twitch (good = does well in high ranks without Ruin or NOED), losing lots of games, analyzing situations and and learning from mistakes. I kept playing and I'm really decent now.
---
I don't know where exactly your problems are, but I often see new killers respecting pallets too much, refusing to break safe pallets, or changing direction when getting looped just when they're about to catch up enough that the survivor would have to drop the pallet. Also if somebody is too tough to catch and just wastes your time, better look for a weaker survivor. If somebody wants to be chased, then chances are he's good at that. Oh and another thing, many people on lower ranks may not really belong there, but most of them aren't that great either as you'll find out once you get more experienced.
---
Scratched mirror is utter dogshit againt half decent survivors bar lerys and the game
---
The player shouldn’t be punished for being farmed by a teammate or for being camped, and it’s not a free escape perk as you can be countered by enduring, or just missing the skill check. Also, when you are downed the killer can push people off of the gens whilst still patrolling your downed body. Not all games have optimal teammates.
---
Well, you are less easy to find if you're healed. I mean, don't you use headphones?
---
I used the wiki. Perhaps you should see about publishing your tests there as while your testing suggests a 50/50 split you have no video evidence. Making your claims to the contrary seem a little unsubstantiated.
---
Proof that survivors really don't have brains
---
This might be the dumbest thing ive ever heard regarding plague. If u can get to a jungle gym or l walls or literally any looping spot and are half decent her purge becomes useless corrupt or not. Not only that being sick makes u throw up which in turn makes your teammates sick and im pretty sure throwing up gives the killer a notification. She also has to collect the corrupt purge which from my experience she doesnt just book it for the purge as soon as someone uses the fountain. Ur telling me u shouldnt heal because it gives the plague a limited ability that can injure survivors at a range? Take out huntress from the game then? 
---
He didn't sound as elephant-y as I hoped but you made me laugh.
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
I'm waiting for a game on PS4 right now and it's been about 35 minutes 
---
So in all of your time playing, you've never even once dropped a pallet early? Every survivor does, it happens. You make a bad read or you do it intentionally to do something else for whatever reason. Dropping 1 pallet early does not make you a bad runner in chases.
---
They gotta add 1 for t pose and 2 for something like dab or fortnite dance or something like that for killers
---
Both benefiting the killer. 
---
You’d think with the longer queue times the matchmaking would be better. Consistently facing survivor a good 7-8 ranks above me at my humble rank 10 but that’s why I’ve started playing Legion
---
I don‘t have the same problem when playing survivor (thank god). 
---
But funny enough when playing Killer I get 3 good ping survivors and 1 random Japanese dude (I‘m PS4 EU as well)
---
I don‘t get it.. 
---
I think I played against this guy before. He was playing as a Michael and faced camped everyone.   I might be wrong but his Avatar and name seem familiar.
---
That and making it not get affected by enduring would go a long way, yeah.
---
Alright Reddit I NEED a version of this gif with that song they always played in early Naruto when the action would pick up!

---
It's the I-don't-actually-need-my-perks build

At this point just take DS out of the game for all I care. 
---
Blame steam for that one. The license was steam and pc only but the perks aren't "licensed"
---
Thank you for doing all the hard work to make it come to life can't wait to see when it drops I'll be watching for that post eagerly.
---
agree. i hate it when playing surv and someone that got downed ragequits. even if it would be death hook, but killer waste time. those seconds can be deciding when repairing or opening the gate or whatever.
---
Man, killers are just not allowed to have a counter to this perk are they lol. If you get slugged just crawl away. If a killer just waits 60 seconds then that is 150% better than any ds.
---
I mean, finding someone attractive is up to your personal preferences, and as long as you also agree that she's a super tough 'n' buff badass, I see no reason to try and change your mind.

It's usually a chav with 12 teeth that say it to wind people up after a game I find -.-
---
Wasn't ranting I was articulating my entire thought process and also just bored had a lot of waiting to do today.
---
Why is it people post something publically but get upset when people post replys on those things.
---
You seem to be getting upset about me questioning the motovation for a post and musing my thoughts on how there are so many of these posts on this sub and that they are oversaturated.
---
Maybe if you can't handle any of that don't post publically? 
---
Glad to know all console play is fucked
---
I get slugged more but I actually like this. More players are using unbreakable and I myself was using tenacity. Changes the game plays a little more. My real issue with d strike is the stun time. The perk is often totally useless bc the stun is so ridiculously short. 
---
Overall I've noticed killers tunneling way less which is cool but when you do get tunneled the majority of the time it's too easy for them to hit you right back down for a one time perk that is supposed to prevent that.  
---
You’re saying that as it was old DS. You can just go away from the hook and find them down another survivor instead of tunneling.
---
Feng is really living up to that stereotype.
---
Yeah, they made all his perks universal/not tied to a character for console. And the art was changed for Unbreakable and Left Behind to be a generic survivor, not Bill.
---
Say gg and move on my dude. Bhvr is highly incompetent and this will most likely never be fixed properly. Keep practicing.
---
How to 911
---
In all of my terrible researches* (I’m sorry if someone gets this)
---
It counters iron maiden and infectious fright. But not a great perk but if they dont like doctor it helps
---
Sorry but there isn’t :/
---
You know what else is smart? Not interacting with dumb people. :-)
---
McLean (a Dev) said that he created scoring events related to hitting sick people and whatnot but they didn't make it in with the Chapter, for some reason, but should be added at some point.
---
I didn't get a clip of it but it was on his stream recently.
---
Or at least urban evasion
---
I threw a rock at the clown *(a big one)*
---
When Jane got on the hook it made me frown
---
You know trappers be trappin by the windows
---
Better than playing Freddy who has his wins low
---
Ah, that’s okay. 
---
Adam players are like toddlers. They play with no intelligence. 
---
BLasr;alalslslaldsmfbh
---
I had this happen a few times. I just had to dashboard for it to go away 
---
Asking if your post triggered someone in a topic you posted about a comment a killer sent you that triggered you......
---
You sure get baited easily don't you. Thanks for the laugh. Took a bland post add a bit of salt and its delicious.
---
I join lobby and tab out. The game's audio turns off but it turns on the moment a lobby starts. I don't know if it was supposed to be designed that way but it works pretty well for me.
---
Yes
---
Hag isn't bottom tier. I'm so sorry
---
He's preparing for the puke lol
---
It's just bug fixes, most important fix for me was the fix for borrowed time
---
not really, lol.
---
It is meant as such. Just because something is meant to achieve a certain effect doesn't mean it does it at all unfortunately.
---
Agree 100%
---
See.. Told you.
---
Killing people once a year doesn’t really pay much. Gotta get that education so he can make that bread 😤
---
Not going to change your mind because I agree 100%. 
---
idk she is pretty poor
---
That something as an ez gets you upset. Yeah you did.
---
I'm not I'm laughing at the irony learn to read..
---
&gt;Agree 100%
---
I can't be bothered anymore and deleted my replies in this thread. You explain with facts why DS is actually decent the way it is and they just downvote because they are salty survivor mains who probably aren't even good at the game to being with. 
---
Good idea, as a killer main I did it stupid as fuck that it’s supposed to counter tunneling but it encourages an equally (debatable) toxic mechanic, slugging. Plus I feel like enduring is enough of a counter, even though it shouldn’t be affecting it since it defeats the purpose of anti-tunneling.
---
The most effective counter to DS is...not tunneling (if it wasn’t obvious enough for some)
---
2019
---
What is SWF, and KYF? 
---
really? just dashboard? we had it occuring from the start till the end of the match.
---
I see it just now btw xD
---
This guys speaks the truth. I have no idea why killers are whining about it, I still find pipping as easy as ever. Survivor pipping in red/purple ranks though... Nearly impossible.
---
It's not the fact itself that I didn't doublepip. I can quickly raise back up to rank 1 no problem so, in the long run, there's no issue, yes.
---
The issue, though, is the fact that survivors can just DC and boom, you're screwed. Perfect match where you did everything right? Immediately denied.
---
It's that a survivor can just straight up grief the killer by DCing, forcing them to lose their doublepip. It goes both ways, too. Killer can DC and cause everyone to lose a pip. 
---
I'm trying to show that, hey, this new system is inherently flawed and needs fixing, as survivors are able to directly influence the killer's rank (by ragequitting, which is something that BHVR says is a reportable offence), something which should never happen.
---
That your intentions were bad and then you acted like the victim. Re-read the title you clearly can't detect irony.
---
🤔
---
If a killer is willing to wait for a full minute to pick you up,(they also would have to pull out a phone or something to time it) then clearly you're just not getting out, and they will tunnel you to death for some reason or other. If a killer is forced to stand on you for a full minute before putting you on hook, that's like 5x more effective at wasting the killers time than old DS. If you really think it happens very often to you, unbreakable is a thing you know.
---
By the way, I also play both sides pretty equally, and honestly new DS is just fine as far as i'm concerned, especially because you can't get dribbled. Tired of seeing 50 posts about buffing DS, especially cause it's actually just an ok perk now, it's not even close to UP(just look at perks like deja vu or streetwise, or ace in the hole).
---
The system is actually nice, before as killer it took you a while to get 5 players so you could play a game, at least for me. Now you know as soon as you get into the lobby that there will be 4 survivors there. 
---
I guess you could call them the Yin Yang.
---
Survive with friends and kill your friends
---
Funny, that's my experience with Joey. 
---
😅
---
SWF = Survive With Friends
---
KYF = Kill Your Friends
---
Bloodpoints or daily for me.
---
Check out OhTofu on youtube he has made multiple tutorials !
---
Some of these are legitimate, but some are irrelevant
---
&gt; if you get downed first, you’re looking at a depip
---
I mean, don’t get downed first, or learn from your mistakes and you’ll pip
---
Same goes for first hook, if you get unhooked, learn to play more safe, learn the killers behaviour (nopunintended)
---
But I very much agree with the DC
---
okay
---
I noticed survivor mains are usually the ones who refuse any type of reasoning. They are always swf and have always been boosted. So when their perk gets a nerf, its all over lol.
---
Good for you I want to P3 her after I’m done with P3ing my Amanda, so close to that sweet bloody pig mask! XD
---
He got triggered that I questioned this post. I get the ones about salt and relating, I get the ones with stories. This one was nothing more then seeking validation that his death and anger at the death was justified. When he didn't get that validation he is getting upset.
---
You think 3 kills 3 gens and a hatch escape is good enough for red ranks? Red ranks. Where the best players in the game exist. And you wanna walk in with an average game? Really? 
---
I also think they need to make it so the 3 seconds is not affected by Enduring
---
I feel like she's very balanced, and I love her design -- but good luck trying to get that altruism badge playing against her since you can't heal anyone!
---
Holy actual eff, that’s so rare it should being the (broken) achievement list
---
Just take away enduring affecting head on and ds then im okay.  A 1.75 second stun does nothing. The survivor is down before they can even move
---
My experience is that sometimes EAC will tell me after a new patch that my files are unverified and need to be fixed. It'll download the new ones, work fine, and then I can edit the .ini files again. All I change is Vsync and max frame rate, so I'm not sure if tinkering more with it causes it to lock down or something like that. Definitely not a bad idea to warn people though, since as you said devs aren't unbanning people that get banned by EAC for innocuous changes to game files.
---
I do know that survivor was op before. But now i get 4ks way too many times when i play killer
---
I don't understand the point you're making. To rank up, you should have to compete against similar or higher ranked players, no?
---
Yep. i thought it would go away after the first match, but continued into the next. Dashboarding worked for me, so i hope it can fix it for you.
---
This. No one else seems to understand that if you just don’t tunnel you won’t get hit by DS. 
---
Like I said I'm not here to entertain you the fuck is wrong with you? You're clearly the one triggered to write all this that's the irony xD Don't comment on posts that aren't for you then complain when someone points out your hypocrisy..
---
Damn I remember that game. Our friends banned using the monkey cause he was OP like oddjob in 007. 
---
&gt;I agree with no healing against Legion but Plague has 115% movement speed, she's not looped as easily and a good player can easily get one hit off on you in a short amount of time.
---
You know whats harder to loop than a 115% killer? Her Corrupt Purge. Even injured you stand more chance of holding her for a longer period than a Plague carrying her Corrupt Purge.
---
I don't remember the exact number, but I tought he said 50 games
---
I got cut out in lobby for the patch. It's a lot of bug fixes.
---
I didn't know but I don't play him because it's remake Freddy :s
---
Or both of them! Like me :D
---
Yeah just be careful cause he's basically got wall hacks when you're asleep. 
---
Throwing axe = cinder block. Confirmed.
---
A wild A380
---
Ackchyually ...
---
Because I type long messages and try and be clear and concise you assume I'm upset? That's good for a laugh. The funny part is you give advice you can't follow and you need strangers to validate you its sad. You also have to resort to cursing? Is that for a lack of vocabulary or just short temper?
---
And you posted to a public place the post is for everyone.
---
Anyway I got home a while ago no more hospital waiting rooms I'm going to go fight the shitty matchmaking for an hour and hope for a game or 2.
---
If it makes you feel better you win! I've been defeated I'm so salty and triggered!
---
Also maybe turn off public messaging when you play dbd so you don't get so stressed out.
---
Soooo those are the teams the youtubers and streamers always find...
---
Paige says stupid shit like this all the time. She has an existing fanbase.
---
Is there a way to force this? Looks fun and I want to try. Surprisingly the one bug to actually want I can't get lol.
---
No, lithe needs a rush vault not action
---

Oh look another matchmaking post
---
There was a similar bug that happened last year when Freddy came out. [This one](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/79rag6/naruto_chases_freddy_reupload/) has the music that you want over this video. 
---
If someone DCs, they should take a half hour lockout from queuing for public games. Go play KYF or idk, go outside or something.
---
If you DC more than three matches in a row, or more than five in a single day, you take a 24 hour lockout.
---
Your account is unaffected (no disciplinary action taken) unless you’re disciplined for something else. If your internet goes out, you could be given some kind of grace period to reconnect to the same game (maybe 2 minutes?) before you take a lockout. After the grace period has expired, anyone else in the now undersized game has the option to leave the match without penalty. You can also DC without penalty from matches that start out undersized (ie fewer than four survs load in).
---
The issues with ranking, deranking, rage quitters, etc are never going to be solved unless there is a real and consistent penalty for disconnecting from games. Any kind of bandaid fix that Behaviour tries to apply us effectively worthless until that happens because if people don’t like something, they’ll just DC and queue again in five seconds.
---
I know they weren't actually infected but I couldn't think of a better title.
---
That's only proves that current system doesn't achieve results it has to
---
i used OoO a lot with SWF, i usually loop the killer as long as i could while my friends do gens, also getting the info at the start of the game of which killer we're facing is quite important, also if your're against a wraith this perk is fucking awesome
---
You're literally making yourself look that way though. And no I shouldn't have to cater specifically you when you can simply fuck off..
---
I would absolutely love it, give each character a unique purpose similar to killers. It would change the game in unique ways too, like how you'd have to change as a killer when going against a certain survivor.
---
Yesterday I was in a game with a friend, I unhooked him and started healing him at that pallet, I got a skill check right before we finished and hit space for it and threw the pallet down for no reason. Felt bad man.
---
In what way? She has amazing map control if you’re good with your traps and can contest hooks and generators relatively easily 
---
I'm not sure what triggers it. I just know this is the first T-posing Survivor clip I've seen where there's a running animation along with the arms extended lol
---
It means you had an alright, but not impressive game. Thus, safety pip- you didn’t deserve to go down, but you did nothing special.
---
Agreed completely
---
LF with insidious and protecting the basement chest is pretty funny
---
You've never promised you would actually let him cleanse it right?
---
So cute, it looks like all the Dwights want to ask on Feng but are too anxios to.
---
They just fixed a bunch in 2.6.2 but the Plague weird sfx in the main lobby is still there. Sounds like she is hitting a pallet with m1 instead of chanting. Also her censer has a strange bouncing visual glitch. 
---
I was a rank 9 before the reset and now with the changes I cant get past 15 :( would probably be worse if it didn't cut off cranking at 15
---
We said Harder to represent skill not Rank Padding by making it so difficult youd damn near need to farm for it.
---
And go down in 2 secs after being found
---
Me too ,except the little teabaging fuckers get away no matter what i do.
---
Agreed plus the hallowed blight with a hole in the torso
---
The same thing happened to me a few days ago, same map too. We didn't get all 5 done, but I did 4 generators (3 of which completely by myself, one I worked on with 2 others), but it was ridiculous because aside from that one single generator, they didn't even touch a generator. Not a single other one on the map had any progress on it whatsoever. It honestly seemed like they were just throwing themselves at the killer all game. I got the hatch escape though because they all died, go figure
---
This needs "I Believe I can Fly" song in the background during this whole match.
---
nah
---
It's just one perk
---
It's fine where it is, I'd hope it would die off but whatever
---
They need to buff the other 20 useless perks and freddy
---
And still get the hatch
---
Just ditch the whole game and tunnel them all day, then you facecamp. That's how I killed them. Of course they were a duo so the 2nd one was hiding nearby.
---
Honestly though how did that miss?? 
---
I do this quite often for practice, bloodpoints and fun.
---
feels bad that it will be a epic store timed exclusive............. GOOD THING I PLAY CONSOLE 
---
Guess i'll start playing Susie then...

Norton is the one that causes all of the game crashes because it’s trying to remove this bug of a game.
---
Play a game to find the 3 other players are disconnecting one after another. Finally see why. Ol' skully legion.  
---
It isn't the same system, a killer was previously able to create a lobby immediately, with survivors filling it up shortly after that. Right now survivors will *still* trickle slowly into your lobbies, only you have to wait "&gt;5 minutes" for it to start.
---
I’m PS4 player
---
This ranking system is messed up it will be fixed
---
I got chased all game. Started on gen then got chased First one was a 2 gen. Got hooked then unhooked immediately got chased after I healed for the other 3 gens. I finally get caught and face camped while team leave unhurt 
---
My points
---
800.  150. 500. 8000
---
I de pip. 
---
I distracted the killer all game and get punished for it
---
I think it has to do with how they changed the way players are supposed to load in. 
---
They made a note about changing it so that all survivors join at the same time. I think this may be where we get killer lobby wait times. Even if it still doesn't work right and we have to wait for survivors to load in. 
---
Her\* Again this post is laughing about someone saying 'ez' after the match wasn't easy for them. No one said anything about anger about dying. The death was fair the message was the problem point so stop making shit up out of the blue. And  finally how ironic that now you're 'seeking validation' in other comments to try and 'win' your made up arguement.
---
I always do that ,but they get their friend unhooked some way then body block me so i don’t get to him.
---
So if I chase someone for 30 seconds and two gens get done In that time am I a bad killer for not camping almost completed gens and not chasing 2+ people at once, what am I supposed to do if I’m play Wraith or bubba, or Freddy which have difficulties moving around the map and warding survivors away
---
Do you wait until they're unhooked? They can soak up a hit as they're getting them down.
---
I use the "Small game" perk and clear all totems I encounter. While playing with my bf against Myers, I cleared 4 totems. I could see where the last one was - but got downed before I could get to it. I kept telling my bf to go get it, he said "no, what are the chances" and went to finish the last gen instead. Of course it was a fucking NoED. As a result, I died, and the random teammate who was coming to rescue me also got killed. Great job, honey, great job -_-
---
Pewdiepie would probably start streaming DbD
---
I'd want a trilogy with each of the OG killers (non licensed) and have the respective survivor with them (A movie with Huntress and David or Jane with the plague)
---
"Unknown"
---
Also adding tho I’m former rank 1 and it doesn’t bother me. The match ups are terrible 
---
I’m rank 8 
---
Team member 1 is 16
---
2 was 10 ( which is close)
---
3 was 13 (maybe)
---
I’m not swf 
---
Killer rank 3
---
How’s that work
---
Look at you commenting on every comment to try get validation for your made up story.
---
Before anyone gets pissed I completely forgot the previous ideas I had. Then I remember how many nea's have done this to me.
---
Yes, unless they're injured they can soak up the hit and unhook, otherwise they'll end up unhooking them but being downed in the process.
---
What you should be doing is as they're being unhooked you get all up in the face of the unhooked, that way they can't be bodyblocked by the one who unhooked, then the moment they start running you lunge.
---
We were on the Red Forest map, Temple of Purgation, with Michael as the killer. I think he was either really bad or he hadn’t played him in a while, because I think most of us went without being chased by him for the whole match.
---
As soon as the 5th gen gets done, I open a gate and he downs and hooks our Nea. Instead of leaving, all three of us went back for her. The Michael was face camping her and behind him was the second unopened gate. The Adam and Jane distracted Michael and got Nea off while I opened the other gate. He goes after the other two while I heal Nea, and we make a beeline for the first gate.
---
However, he downs Nea and gets Adam hooked. I’m trying to debate whether or not I should go for the unhooked, but the Jane gets the Nea up and rescues Adam. I managed to get in between Michael and Jane for a body block, and the four of us escape back to the campfire. I later find out the Michael had Make Your Choice, but he really didn’t capitalize on it.
---
I really loved this match because the three of us had the same mindset. The other three could have been in a SWF group, but it felt good to stick it to the camping Michael.
---
So who is your favorite killer?
---
You kidding me? susie is the worst its like they play legion to piss you off. 
---
Effectively makes the sneakster a not sneakster
---
There are crazy nurses on PS4, it's mostly FPS that screws you. With Huntress on the other hand I can't hit shit even though I use Keyboard+Mouse (I use it solely for killer plays in dbd lol), because the aiming is still twitchy
---
Thats great, finally im gonna have my revenge lol . Thanks a lot fellow killer. 
---
My first time playing against the Spirit, I found the husk she leaves behind when she goes phase walking. I walked around her a couple of times before she disappeared, which gave me a spook.
---
/s means sarcasm, everyone. 
---
Oh what a lovely shock
---
Nurses is just a good perk in general and works on a lot of killers. Considering Nurse is free you might as well.
---
I mean, I don't get hit through pallets *that* frequently. It's just something I noticed throughout all the time I've played against her (since she's been popular the last couple days.) Just another small visual bug to add to the pile I guess lol
---
Dude watch James Chen Rage Quit on youtube (I know he plays Tekken but that's not the point). It will make you feel 100 times better. After you watch it jump into a game and if you feel yourself getting mad or frustrated, just watch the video again. I do this when I am getting pissed at games to remind myself that its just a game and I look silly when I get mad at it. If other people are typing away at you, they probably act like James Chen!
---
You're teammate wasn't doing anything but bming at the exit either? Cmon man.
---
Cause is it not meant to be buffed. The devs don't wanna buff it as it is only suppose to be hard mode.
---
I believe the devs said in the past that the purpose of the perk was to be for people who want a challenge, so I imagine that's the reason it hasn't really been buffed. It's supposed to be difficult to use effectively?
---
doing gens, you?
---
This happens so much and it’s so stressful 
---
:D
---
Seems like The Shape has legit gained Huntress Hatch abilities. 
---
That’s when a chase music starts and you didn’t even know there was a survivor
---
What did you use to record this?
---
Also literally did 3.5 gens in a game, most of the unhooks, wasn't hooked once and post game a survivor who died on hook from being hooked 3 times and did no gens said "youre useless, didnt do sh\*\* all game. wtf did you even do" to me.    -\_\_-  
---
fan content(service)
---
Running like naruto?
---
You know I tried that once. After getting pissed at a survivor match I went to go play legion at high rank with a mori and addons to piss them off. Needless to say I only managed to piss myself off.
---
i’m a small lesbian :3
---
Poor Guy got only 1 hook all game and that was the guy opening the Gate. 
---
Matchmaking is do weird atm.
---
I had one game where everytime one survivor got sick, every other survivor got sick as well. Not sure if it was just a bug or what. 
---
agreed 
---
I have to say I prefer legion over the doctor. 
---
You'll be even happier once you try it on whoever your main is. I remember seeing my first match with my main resulting in 60k+ BP, its an amazing feeling. 
---
Then why not give it a BP bonus to incentivize using it? Handicaps for the sake of handicaps would only  be used in a KYF lobby with new players 
---
No need for M&amp;A with piggy, her power has you covered there ;) 
---
No I called him white mask man 
---
I'm always already in the basement by the time I remember it's the huntress who might have that on then I hear her singing :( 
---
Gens open. NOED pops right in front of me. Clear it. Move towards gate opposite of where shit is going down.  Hatch pops right in front of me.
---
I feel like the game is pretty balanced rn. I play equal amounts killers and survivor and can say that yes survivor has gotten harder, but it was pretty easy before.
---
Yeah in its current state it’s basically forcing you to play down 2 perks and broken for..... nothing notable. In most games the “hard mode” has some cool reward for players that use it. Bonus bloodpoints would be a great addition to this perk.
---
I want to upvote this but the number is too perfect...
---
It amuses me that Leatherface is the "scrawny" one.
---
You can change it under a setting like 'mute focus' check box where if it's ticked it mutes the game when tabbing out.
---
Pretty obvious who the obsession should be...***^(hmmm)***
---
I got the gate to 99 so I could do exactly that though, it’s all timed perfectly and you still gotta come be a downer. Didn’t your mom ever teach ya if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all?
---
I do not condone underage drinking and/or other illegal activities. ;)
---
Thank you! I’ll definitely look into those as of right now I’m basically dead if found first

Heres a new killer, the plague. 
---
Also oops now when you get hooked you see from the killers perspective  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Thanks. I was pretty confused.
---
Same with the leather face DLC not having the same naming scheme
---
I thought it was Michelle
---
me when there's any bps and i have a mori: weLL GUESS IT GOIN IN THE CAN OF TRASH
---
Actually I’m ranked higher as killer
---
The worst part is, this matchmaking is not even that bad... 
---
OP clearly never saw a rank 20 killer against 4 rank 1 survivors to consider this bad. 
---
Understandable
---
I'm dumb and don't understand this 
---
I think he was being tongue in cheek. He even said well played, like you played well. And you're embarrassing yourself in the comments please stop.
---
SWF trying to find a lobby be like:
---
What the game say: Estimated time &lt; 1 minute.
---
What's Happen: 30 min later you find a killer with red ping.
---
Man they've already added it
---
What you did to that bulldozer back there... I think you need help, mate.
---
I've just had too many games where I get camped first hook after all the gens are done. Fucking Leatherfaces...
---
Another one? This is the very first one I've ever seen.
---
I mean as a red rank killer I’ve yet to have any of my lobbies be full of red rank survivors. They’re mostly a mix of purple and green ranks with a red sprinkled in.

I had that the other night. 4 bloody party streamers vs. my ebony. With a loud, annoyed sigh, I just hooked them a few times instead of using it lol. At least it gives more points to hook them multiple times then it does to mori.

Idk why this sub is convinced every good player at low ranks deranked. News flash rank resets every month and not everyone is in high school and can play 8 hours in the first week after. I’d bet the majority of really good players at low ranks just haven’t played in a while. 
---
Not to mention deranking is a thing in every game ever so your best bet it to try and learn 
---
it feels like youre being quadruple the amount of asshole when i'm playing legion if i mori instead of farming against multiple BPS

Wow, for a bloodpoint bonus I would 100% do that. Amazing idea!
---
It’s too late in the game’s life cycle to do this.
---
All the people that have grinded ALL the perks on one survivor are suddenly gonna feel shafted because some other survivor has a powerful meta passive whilst theirs is mediocre. 
---
If you make it lock in, then you’re suddenly having to fight with another survivor who wants to play (x) and they’ll probably leave the lobby if they don’t get their survivor choice. If you don’t, then suddenly a particular survivor is the more meta choice and that’s basically all you’ll see.
---
We somewhat have this with Claudette already just because she’s the easiest survivor to hide with. It’s basically her in built passive. 
---
It’s a nice idea and certainly something they could consider for a game mode or DBD2 if/when that happens but with the way the game is currently designed and with how old it is, it’s an idea that would piss more people off than please them.

Why does this have platinum?

I wonder how people are smart enough to do this kinda math stuff man. I suck at the basics even.

I don't get why Bill from L4D is in the game because it's about zombies not killers? I'd really like to see Victor Crowley and Marybeth, Ghostface and Sidney, Pinhead and Kirsty ect.

Well then yes I agree. But have you done that?

lol playing the game in a way because the devs screwed up is "cheating" somehow

Not gonna lie, this actually sounds brilliantly hilarious. Of course the perks would never work like this, but the power would be brilliant to see.

It's such a power move omg. I do this to assert dominance

Good luck finding windows in the game map

Hey I know it's just a funny post but I wanted to ask if you could delete this. I sent this to an old friend in private (that's my pink handwriting) and she posted this as her own without my knowledge. I'm not comfortable with a private text of mine being on the internet, even if it's a harmless joke. Thanks. 
---
It's just like a pallet stun and it has exhaustion.  How can you even pretend to be genuinely discussing it comparing it to DS?
---
I think it means well played but I didn't know either :s
---
I got good at playing dbd by a combination of playing killer a lot and watching monto play. Just watching him helped me learn some mind games, how to better predict survivors, and use certain killers. Also, try to avoid difficult killers like nurse, Billy, or huntress at first and maybe start with trapper.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I don't see how it's fair.  I can't find any use for it unless the timer was removed so you could successful extend a chase with a locker juke.  The 3 seconds basically makes it only useful for the dead weight survivors who literally just hide all game.
---
I rarely use NOED because I find it unnecessary. doesn't mean someone's shit if they use it though. does make your choice make you a shit killer? is tier three myers a shit killer? I understand it's annoying to be downed by it when you would otherwise escape but that's kinda the point. I could point out that it serves more to make people leave right away instead of being a toxic piece of shit when they face a killer that isn't that good or is new to the game. especially with lobbies being the way they are where my gf who's brand new to killer (rank 19) is going against rank 10's.
---

You didnt have to point out bing bong boy's feetsies like that :(

Pretty common with older guys. I used to do this, thinking "hey maybe they want some advice" NOOOO it's distracting unless you are dropping critical information. Usually there isn't so much critical information that the mouth must flap nonstop.  
---
It's an ego trap.
---
tbh I'm trying to avoid the game right now
---
They always break shit and playing the plague is noisy as fuck with that triple sound glitch
---
Fun is subjective. But I’ll play out a scenario. 
---
You want to run around puking on people with awful hitboxes (which takes forever) until they get broken and then one hit. 
---
Or do you want to run around with lower move speed, no terror radius, and a one shot ability. 
---
Myers is not only better, but more fun.

Outstanding move.
---
Shape, and Shape. There's too much busy-work with the Plague for both sides, it's more fun trying to sneak up on survivors and carrying a one-shot in your pocket. 
---
Make your choice and Tier 3 Myers are not even on the same planet as Noed lol.  Myers has to manage stalk and only pops for limited time.  Make Your Choice has a brief timer as well and it's pretty easy to nope out of there after unhooking and simply find a locker or something to wait out the duration.  But NOED rewards killers for playing like shit.  It takes all urgency out of their games and minimizes completely the importance of gen pressure and choosing chases intelligently.  There was a point where survivors were OP and I wouldn't bat an eyelash at anyone using NOED other than a Billy or something.  But that was like 10 survivor nerfs ago and currently killer has never been easier to play.  We don't need the crutch anymore.  90% of killers I face running it rely on it to get their kills.  The other 10% are just incredibly lazy and want mindlessly easy games.
---
I'm pretty sure these are all mechanics put in place in an effort to smooth the transition to dedicated servers. 
---
Oh okay, I was confused because of how much people will call something theirs that someone else worked hours on, it happens a lot in this subreddit.

I know I'm in the minority, but the matchmaking update was working perfectly for me with short wait times and good ping, so boo! But hopefully this is just a temporary stop to make a system that works for everyone.
---
Faaaat
---
As of right this minute on PS4 the timer is gone, guess they took it down because the timer was broken and not giving correct times. Anyone else seeing this? 
---
If you get a good map with Scratched Mirror, it’s easy to win. That’s why you have to take your time and enjoy torturing the survivors. You can’t actually stalk, but staring at them through a window or down a hallway is scary as hell.
---
If you play Jumpscare Myers right, the game will slow itself down because survivors will be too paranoid and scared to do anything.

Chill out, Benedict.

Had the exact same thing happen and it was ruin. Had to suck it up the entire game and power through.
---
Clearly you are set in your opinions and are willfully blind to anything opposing it. My other examples were only there to show you that there are other ones that give exposed effect that no one complains about. You complain about NOED because you're used to comlaining about it. It's actually very weak as a hex totem and is typically broken long before it's able to be used. It is very annoying but so is practically every perk, also: killer's job is to stop you from leaving, not be kind to you and your ego
---
I never take my Myers anywhere without his Monitor and Abuse.
---
They're always shocked. 
---
Ye, he cool, his videos are a perfect balance of skill and failure. Both on his side and the other side. 
---
Shape, Shape, and Shape. Most Myers mains I've met are absolutely adorable to boot. 
---
Think of DStrike as a time waster perk more than another chance... sure it can give another chance but tbh it has always seemed to be a time waster perk, and that is where it is at now if they slug you for that long more time for you to get saved or more time for your team to do gens for free
---
In my personal experience, it's Jakes that are like this. 
---
PC or console?  I hope they keep it as is for console.
---
They pick the character that's hard to see for a reason.
---
This photo is terrifying if you're familiar with the story behind it.

Calm down. I said "I'm the only Susie Legion **I've met**" 
---
I have no doubt there are other nice and better Susies than me out there, I'm just saying that I agree with SixteeNyne that a lot of Susies seem to be toxic.
---
I've carried survivors past hooks to the exist gate and let them wiggle out after standing still for a few seconds, only to have them run off. In that case, my logic is "too stupid to live" and I put them out of their misery.
---
You're not supposed to depip if the killer disconnects. I haven't had that happen on this patch, but it definitely gave a safety pip before.
---
Camping is inefficient, but once the exit gates are open, what are you supposed to do? You can secure the kill, and like you said, these hyper altruistic survivors run over. As I say, it's opportunistic. You *know* they're running over, so why would I leave the hook?
---
As the other person mentioned, I was on console so it filmed it automatically (PS4). I edited it with Shotcut which I highly recommend for low effort videos like this :P
---
But does Sprint Burstaholics Anonymous endorse Lithe?

---
Your benevolent shows black, were your unhooks unsafe? 
---
But ofc, sometimes use the M1 is needed, like someone passing thru a window and u dont have enough time to charge the chainsaw.
---
It happens. Usually I don't consider 1 flashlight to be that much of an issue, but more than that will get me to run Franklin's.
---
^^Hax: ^^Ruin
---
At pallet breaking there’s really nothing you can do, you just got to take it. Try listening for their footsteps though, and you can follow them without seeing them.
---
For picking up survivors, always try to look at walls so you can’t get blinded. If this isn’t an option, turn the oppose direction from where a survivor might sneak out for the blind. If someone starts blinding you, look up as quickly as possible and you might avoid getting fully blinded. Also, if you think you’re about to get blinded, just stand on top of the survivor you down without picking them up, and just peek down. This will bait the flashlight survivor to run into action, and then you can just hit them or even down them.
---
Flashlight saves have been harder to get because they have reduced the pickup animation time, but they still exist. If you’re really having trouble, run franklins demise, but it’s not necessary.
---
Oh boy how things have changed. I don’t trust myself but maybe look up all the patch notes
---
Oops, we fucked up.
---
It's not unfair anymore, more annoying if anything, just never underestimate how game changing a flashlight user can be, try to look at objects or faking the pick-up (you will be surprised how often a flashlight user will come running at higher ranks). The time i have a problem with them is when they last second switch to them, but that is more due to me having ptsd of older times.
---
Yep I just gave up on this game until they fix this shit. I really don’t have to be stuck playing this game while they are more focused on DLC over the bugs and millions of other issues.
---
Most maps are, especially maps that are open with high visibility. Scratched Mirror requires ambush play, since tier 1 Myers is so slow. The only maps that are good for it are Lery’s, the Game, and maybe some of the Coldwind maps if you play in the corn. Haddonfield might be alright too, but I’ve never done SM on it before. Survivor sightlines aren’t great on any of those maps, which is important to the playstyle necessary for SM.
---
Hags ability is amazing, I play her at rank 1 in this current matchmaking. She has extremely good map pressure. I think you need to verse a good one:)
---
Why run 30% missed attack cooldown when you can run 40% hit cooldown and not miss in general?
---
Good. I don't care about the rank changes, but waiting in a queue to get into a queue is pretty stupid.
---
They only get spared if the can keep from being a toxic cunt for just one match.   That T-bag after pallet drop means most of you are dying today and bitching post game.
---
Shape is by far better to play as and against.
---
I mainly play survivor but lately I’ve been trying out killer and realized that flashlights can be really really good, if you’re predictable as hell. As you said, the only time they are useful is when you get stuck in animations. Don’t get stuck in animations. Don’t get pallet stunned and try to chase other survivors away before you pick up the dying survivor. When you see someone has a flashlight you need to be wary of the camp/blind playstyle where they hide just outside of the chase and once the survivor is downed they run up and blind you. All you have to do is leave the downed survivor for a few seconds and usually you’ll be able to catch the flashlight camper with their pants down. Push them away, go back and then pick up the down survivor. It’s definitely not unfair. In fact I’d say flashlights get me kills more often that I get stunned because sometimes people rely on them too much and all you do is dodge it and whack them.
---
I thought so I never see people using it unless they're new to the game :s
---
Yall just want us to play bing bing boy because hes easy as fuck to counter.
---
You should get each Killer perk eventually. Even if you don't play that Killer.
---
fair enough.
---
Could say the same to you and your comment..
---
I am selfish and want mah perfect perk built. I may use it once, but i am sure my teammates will make me regret it, corner hugging idiots.
---
I wish more developers would reduce quality for frames on console. I might still be playing For Honor if this was so.
---
Hey, Nurse is playable rn, lets keep it 😉
---
That's been my experience too.
---
With Wraith I can at least zoom around the map while cloaked and apply pressure by making them unsure where I am, but with Clown I feel like I'm always two steps behind.
---
Mess with the doc you get the shock that's just how itis
---
"Damn this darn survivors always complaining about totems and oh look, that person hit struggle, how bad they are", do you know how hard it is t organize a full solo team?! So much shit goes wrong, but it's fun most of the time.
---
Yeah that personality is *dummy* thicc
---
So, apologies if you know this and doesnt affect what happened in your game, but the doctors shock, when timed properly, stops people from being able to interact with pallets or windows for 2.5 seconds. This can totally fuck up survivors in loop heavy areas.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Herman_Carter#Power:_Carter.27s_Spark 
---
See I never ever understood the concept of running Franklins to counter flashlights.  Why wouldn't you just run Lightborn instead?  Would you rather have a chance to maybe knock it out of their hands so they can't use it OR would you prefer to simply become immune to them period?  They will never time that save properly against that perk.
---
Okay now I'm starting to like you.
---
\^ This guy is really fun at parties. Imagine getting offended over photoshopped images of a website.
---
As a killer main I HATE flashlights. They are so annoying when you're trying to do the objective and wish for easier ways to deal with them. Once when almost hooking someone, their buddy ran from behind the hook flashlighted me, teabags and ran away. Ugh. Easy way tho is when you're carrying a survivor listen and turn last second also moonwalk if you're able. They wont expect that. 
---
Yes I hate flashlights because old game they really hurt my eyes and I had to deal with it irl and in game. But with the different style now I believe that it's not as bad as other moves. If there's a will there's a way and it's part of the game to help other survivors. So basically if you dont want to deal with it find ways around it. Moonwalking, (see a flashlighter pop out, quickly turn behind and keep walking the same direction then switch back when they run to the other side, you're at hook and bam!), keeping eyes on walls, Franklin's demise. Also if you're gonna break pallets do it when you're not in a chase. So much easier so you dont have to. Huntress plague clown and doctor are great for these as pallets dont bother them as much but others can walk away do gens and break pallets later down the road. I've only learned this because I would lose minutes of game time because i had to re adjust my eyes from blinds before they fixed the color. 
---
Hope this helps, your friendly neighborhood Doctor. 
---
menacingly
---
was there an audio cue at all with this??
---
Good for him for getting a higher education 
---
&gt; the potatoes you get put with
---
I think that's the biggest reason a lot of people feel the way you do. The overall standard of survivor play has dropped tremendously. I don't feel like I'm doing a lot to pip when I have 3 (or even 2) other survivors who at least understand the basic fundamentals. 
---
Distortion, Dead Hard, Mettle of Man (when it comes out), Adrenaline, Alert, Dark Sense 
---
Jumpscare Myers &lt;3 
---
Self care is a must and I prefer dead hard for an exhaustion perk
---
[I made perks for this concept once too](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ac24y3/i_know_we_have_seen_killers_from_horror_movie/ed72y9g/)
---
i would have to disagree on this one 
---
You're not immune to the flashlights with Lightborn. Just more resistant with it. They can still blind you with the right add-ons. It's just easier to knock it out of their hands, along with their buddy's toolboxes.
---
Intadowns are a big oof and they should keep away from them, i doesn't matter if it's rare, slapping on an addon and knocking someone down is not balance.The other stuff i mostly agree with 
---
It’s that kind of selfish nonsense that screws over the others.
---
No mither 
---
Now they only need to add Shrek's hut somewhere on the map.
---
Wraith has some of the best skins in the game... What the heck do you mean? 
---
I fully understand how the perk works.  I meant that essentially you are immune because they cannot time that shit properly they would have to start the blind a year early especially with the new pickup speed animation change.  You would have to literally go out of your way to allow them to blind you on a pickup with Lightborn on.  You will ALWAYS have time to look up before they get the blind effect off 
---
Was a rank 18 killer. He is new to the game i think. I told him that he was doing a wrong build and he said i was hacking, because a Claudette got mori'd after everyone left and the Claudette dced so he thought i was the Claudette. Gave him some courage to keep learning the game and he will become better. I said that because he was nice to me afterwards (called me a good player).
---
Your welcome, Oh did you hear we reverted the matchmaking system 
---
We aim to please  
---
\-Behvr 2019
---
But the lock of hair....
---
Please tell me this was intentional ever since that update finding a game has been 10+ minutes instead of 2-3.
---
Are you playing on Xbox One or PS4? I'm playing on an Xbox One X, and although the game still isn't X enhanced it looks and runs significantly better after the 2.6.0 patch. It actually hits 60fps a good amount of the time now although there are still performance drops during certain situations and on certain maps. I'm not sure if they increased the resolution on Xbox One, but I believe BHVR is now using UE4's temporal anti-aliasing which has significantly cleaned up the image. Before not only was DbD blurry, but had a lot of aliasing artifacts and really bad dithering. That all seems to be remedied now, and the game just looks so much sharper and cleaner. Certain effects like lighting a fog have been improved too, but certain textures like those on generators have been untouched and still look pixelated/muddy.
---
Overall I'd say that at least on Xbox One that 2.6.0 has been a massive improvement for both visuals and performance. And my friends playing on base Xbox Ones say it looks and runs better for them too, but that isn't too surprising since like I said DbD still isn't Xbox One X enhanced yet.
---
Hilarious that Devil May Cry 5 can run 60fps with its photo realistic graphics, huge swarms of enemies on screen at once, and ridiculous animation and effects going on all at once AND have online coop, but DBD can't run 60fps even when making its already bad graphics worse.....
---
I personally like the ranking system but that's an unpopular opinion so maybe i shouldn't say it.
---
It was. They just announced on Twitter just a bit ago that they reverted the matchmaking for now.
---
Oops. Been a while since I bought something.
---
Nurse's Calling, Tinkerer, Monitor &amp; Abuse, and Iron Maiden are all excellent. 
---
*BILL! BILL! BILL!*
---
I'm a ps4 (pro) player. Didn't notice anything and honestly don't care. It runs fine and that's all that matters
---
I'm kind of wary against buffing any killers right now as killer in general is in a really good place right now but I'd suggest a very slight buff to her.  I think her jigsaw boxes should ONLY be visible when the timer is active.  Just make that addon part of her base kit.  They could possibly give her a tiny boost to lunge duration or something possibly too.  
---
Np! If you wanna run a “Toxic Survivor” build, you should run Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Distortion 😊
---
Oh fuck oh shit
---
Well I can take a break from the Salt Mines and give you a helping hand. What tips do you want to know? 
---
Had this problem too, only thing is, matchmaking is so fucked that I'm in a lobby for 30 minutes before one survivor joins, than leaves.
---
the point you're trying to make is that swf makes the game too hard for you so you want to dodge lobbies until you find 4 soloqueue survivors so you can get an easy win thats all im seeing
---
She's really unfun to play against because your whole team needs to literally make zero mistakes or she can snowball off corrupt fountains and murder everyone with almost no counterplay. Corrupt Purge is like taking away Huntress hatchets and giving her a flamethrower instead.
---
There’s already a trapper mask
---
Wait.. ur supposed to have more then 12 teeth?
---
Commie scythe? 
---
Nice callback to the original film shot.
---
Not since the Machinegun build was a thing. It used to combine with STBFL and the recovery from successful *and* missed attacks used to be near-instantaneous. It was a trump card against the horseshit that was Decisive Strike back then. 
---
Thank you. RIP machinegun, though 
---
It appears a lot of people are approaching this like it's a given that the community is toxic and that you have TO ADAPT to it rather than changing the root problem.  
---
What we should really be pointing out here is that there's no demotivating factor put in place to lower this attitude. Why do we've to tell people to "bare with it" or "get used to it" instead of "wow the hell, this community needs to be fixed a bit".  
---
THAT is where things are already going wrong.
---
Real talk they need to turn the Tiktok hit or miss girl cosplay into a Feng skin.
---
true but you have to remember that it is used to be just a irritating perk and it made people who run dead hard that are very good at looping basically have another free 30+ seconds of running you around
---
The lower end of the spectrum sure dstrike was absolute garbage (as a survivor main I saw many teammates dc due to missing it) but when you get to those high ranks it was just horrid... 
---
I like where it's at now and thats from a survivor point of view the perk should have never been a random get out of jail card for free now it actually has a intended use to stop tunnelling
---
Honestly I think it's at an okay spot no perk should be a definite use perk, to be honest I think they need to focus on alot of the other perks now to either nerf change or buff (alot of the survivor perks just aren't used)
---
Just pump your points into her to unlock her teachables af 40.  You don't have to actually play her to do this.  
---
excuse me sir you dropped this (L °_°)-\
---
And it not only rewards not tunneling but also yields a staggering difference as soon as 6 stacks in. If you play well it also finds the same use regardless of tier. 
---
Yeah I’ll try that uhh do u know how to get blood points faster it feels like I’m progressing really slow
---
Sorry If I’m bothering you
---
I thought they did.
---
Slows them down and applies some kind of effect to the screen so it’s hard to the survivor player to see/control them
---
You vs the guy dwight tells you to not worry about
---
Are there any DBD memes alive? 
---
We know the community needs to be fixed. We’ve been saying it for YEARS at this point. The thing is, nothing has changed. It takes insanity to continue doing the same thing and expecting different results. 
---
A fitting end for those who would leave their friends behind. 
---
Nobody left behind.
---
I mean I already said that's what's called a "crutch", I don't expect you to agree that you're not actually handicapped without your Discord/Sony PartyChat™ programs. But it doesn't matter, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how much of an advantage that coordinated voice comm is in a game like this. 
---
These are the Karens of dbd
---
Self care waste so much time. I don't think it's worth running when you can have a team mate heal you or use a medkit.
---
lol why am i not surprised 
---
It’s no issue, friend. Unfortunately, the new ranking system makes things a bit harder, but the entire gist is to help your friends, escape chases, and complete generators. Cleansing lit and dull totems help too. 
---
If you’re in a pinch, Killer always grants a bit more BP than Survivor 
---
You don't need Iron Will eith No Mither.  You're already pretty damn quiet at 50%.  When I run it I combine it with Resilience, Dead Hard and usually empathy as I typically am with a friend if I'm using this perk.  It likely won't receive a buff considering the devs added it into the game as a hard mode for survivors. 
---
*Tier
---
Fuck DC’ers
---
Hmm runs fine, but looked better before, feels like a downgrade. 
---
I understand but there’s moments when the killer comes back to hook before your teammates able to heal you nd if you get away you’re ganna need self care to avoid being one hit
---
i can agree its an advantage, i think you can also agree the killers are at an advantage when survivors arent using voice comms, so can we both just agree bhvr sucks at making video games
---
I'm a survivor main. I'm not very good, just want to play the game and have fun. not looking to be competitive. 
---
I hear you. I feel bad for killers when everyone escapes. I tried being a killer a free time, and got owned so bad I stopped playing killer.
---
The Charity case has a bunch of player-created cosmetics.
---
We're gonna live forever(but don't be a douche with it and just farm everyone, each time you save someone from a hook or take a hit for someone, you get a stack, a stack gives you 25% bonus bloodpoints for the game, and it caps at 100%), or you can use BBQ and Chili on killer which has the same effect each time you hook a survivor for the first time, and it also reveals the other survivors that are 40 meters or more away.
---
Big shock big COCK doc
---
I didn't say they make them "too hard", I said that you're boosting yourself in a game that isn't balanced for it, and it's natural that your opponent would want to avoid it if they can. SWF aren't insurmountable challenges or something, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose like any other. They're just less fun.
---
**[Overusing the same screeching sound intensifies]**
---
The perk is fine where it is. The only change I could see happening to it is the timer being decreased. It now actually has a reliable counter (Enduring) and isn’t a guaranteed free escape. If the Killer decides to slug you, then your teammates can get a gen done or come heal you. I think a lot of Survivors are just having decisive withdrawals and are trying to get the perk back to its uncounterable state. 
---
Lmao
---
But only after tossing 3 pallets in that timespan.
---
I main survivor. I still think looping is a dick move. Loopers are the ones who need to 'git gud' and learn how to lose the killer.
---
I use bamboozle ruin bbq and enduring
---
Thanks both of u this helped clear up a lot of things
---
I love how they just drop a 4.5 gig update and don't say a word about it.
---
Was unsure if this was worthy of the shitpost flair or the Subreddit meta flair - chose the latter.
---
Hey Rank 1s you hear that? That's the sound of all the people who give a shit that you reached Rank 1!
---
What? You can't hear them? Well fancy that! Maybe no one gives a shit that you got some arbitrary number in this video game and feel the need to constantly boast about how much better you are than everyone else because of it?
---
I've reached Rank 1 with both Killer and Survivor and I don't feel the need to point out everything that someone does wrong when they post a gameplay clip. At worst I'll comment on if the opposing side didn't do well, because I'm not an asshole and I don't needlessly insult the original poster just to inflate my small ego.
---
No one gives a shit if the player made rookie mistakes. Just laugh at the silly gameplay they thought was Reddit worthy. Like or dislike and move on: don't write an 8 paragraph comment on why the player sucks at Dead by Daylight.
---
Cause you see that? You don't? Well that's what girls think of your dick when you brag about your rank in a glorified hide-and-seek video game.
---
r/outoftheloop?
---
keep salting
---
keep making yourself look stupid
---
Meh, only a matter of time then  lol
---
Nice try, BHVR dev
---
If you can get nea to look into the camera while facing down when using self care, she does that with her eyes
---
How would you apply it Cus if it a throwing weapon that’s the definition of clown
---
ARE YOU READY, NERDS?
---
Do you really think a dev would have shaggy stones as their name
---
yeah absolutely, but if i have to play at a disadvantage or an advantage because theres no balanced option, im gonna play at an advantage and idk who else wouldnt
---
No one is that altruistic
---
DS is still kind of taboo
---
At least someone said it. Personally not against many of the recent changes, and its annoying to see the same complaints over and over again.
---
*"OI! Back to work!"*
---
I think I've never earned 3000 in brutality with her. It's like Pig's Deviousness.
---
Oh god, i do that noooooo
---
Right? I'd rather have them hide like little bitches at endgame than DC at the very beginning
---
In no0b3's video there was a claudette who did nothing for 20 minutes and when no0b3 asked what he was doing the Claudette typed "doing gens, you?" If you want to watch the video here ya go: https://youtu.be/_MvbUqOVJic
---
Thx 
---
Have you seen new DS with Enduring? 
---
Had the same thing happen to me, just randomly got sick. Must be a bug
---
They also need to revert the new stupid pipping system they implemented for it to be "fixed" completely. There is very few red rank survivors because it's nearly impossible to pip for them, so red rank killers are getting screwed over and are pretty much unable to find lobbies.
---
Your point?
---
Teammates carry each other just as often as they drag each other down down. A well played match from four survivors is going to curb stomp a similarly-skilled killer, 99/100 times. See [TRIGGER WARNING]&gt;!Marth88's videos!&lt; for examples. Survivor gameplay has the higher ceiling for that reason, while killer gameplay probably has the higher floor. 
---
I agree, I play both sides regularly but main survivor, the only thing I don't like about killers is Noed, it's just so aggravating when you go through an entire match without getting hit only to get downed by an average to poor killer who will just aggressively camp you and watch you die.
---
Sucks even worse for console players who are very limited in what they can rebind it to
---
yeah to farm the rewards off the hard working ones
---
My point is that new ds is trash and useless if killer has enduring. The stun literally is non existing 
---
I'm a killer main and I do get a kick out of it when I get hit by this perk lol
---
Clearly made by a survivor main.
---
Pebble would like to know your location
---
Exactly. That's the only time I get caught with it are games where I was lucky enough to make mostly the correct moves never go down and then bam lol.
---
thanks :3
---
yeah i can def agree with this. In my experience of playing swf the only crutch things that are said are "im going for the hook do gens", "im looping him do gens", "ive done x amount totems", "exit gates are open", etc. these callouts dont really matter if the killer doesnt camp, knows when to give up on a chase, doesnt run noed, etc. Telling someone you're on a gen doesnt matter because it doesnt affect them unless theyre coming to do it with you, in which case it could be hard to explain where it is at times and can be found with bond in soloqueue anyway. Imo swf just separates the good killers from the bad ones
---
lol ironic you call yourself a hippie when the only thing you are good at is being toxic af.
---
prestigious thiccness indeed! thank you :3
---
&gt; If a killer slugs you then proxy camps your body, that's no different than the killer camping a hook. Gens will get rushed and the killer loses.
---
It's actually even better than just camping, it's giving an extra 60 seconds to the other survivors to do everything. Essentially an extra hook stage, and if there was a perk that gave you a 3rd hook stage before death I guarantee it'd be ran as a meta perk. The new DS is a win in most categories IMO, with the only arguable change needed is making Enduring ineffective towards the stun time, but otherwise a very well balanced perk with proper upside and counterplay.
---
Dead hard, balanced landing, adrenaline, borrowed time. 
---
Dead hard, balanced landing, deliverance, decisive strike for cheeky plays to waste the killers time or be toxic.
---
Tfw you're paid in salt
---
Hillbilly :x
---
Next time you see them, bring a ebony &gt;:)
---
Yeah sadly I no longer have my pc. I’ve noticed on pc killers have a hard time with lobbies and on PS4 it’s survivors. At least in my experiences with both at red ranks
---
now people are complaining about the matchmaking being reverted, holy shit can bhvr do anything without people getting fucking salty lmao?
---
I guess this sub liked Susie because of her design. Won't blame them. 
---
Meh, on Pig, Doctor, and Wraith you'd probably be better off sticking to BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit Fury.
---
That would be a good idea! Might not add that on release as it's going to take a lil' bit more time to import all cosmetics into the database, but a good addition nonetheless!
---
Oh god i havent played dbd in months what on earth is THAT
---
Jane tbh she's just eh
---
[Link for anyone interested.](https://youtu.be/IQRDijaX5Io)
---
I love all his videos, lots of good info. 
---
I got the joke from him, so i guess recognizing the name. Tho tbh dont really get the question.
---
She **T H I C C** tho
---
They're just downvoting any comment that explains why a killer would want to avoid boosted groups, it's a waste of time. The top comment is a strawman about how killers *don't* akshually want a balanced match, they just want to 4k every time....
---
if they do it like the tutorial, they could hide a dwight in a random locker so the killer can play 'pick a locker' or have a bush and play 'find all claudettes' 
---
But you really are handicapped if the matchmaking is not doing its intended job. If I get similar ranked survivors on solo queue, I’m happy, but more often than not (and judging by the hundreds of posts, screenshots, and complaints on this sub), it’s extremely common. With this in mind, there are two options: give into chance you’ll get competent players which is a big factor for living or dying, or SWF with some buddies and save yourself the possibility of grief. At the end of the day, no one in their right mind would choose the former. This is just what BHVR has created. The voice comm advantage is present, but more likely than not, it is not a majority of survivors’ motive for teaming.
---
I'm not really talking about Susie players, just Susie as a character. 
---
I just found it funny how you'll have all these posts like "BHVR PLS DELET LEGION!!" then below it is a Susie fanart with over 1000 upvotes. 
---
or they are chased by a nea
---
probably not, they don’t like doing them.
---
I was asking if you actually are Farmer John.
---
Definitely looks that way. I played as tombstone Myers once and had a survivor spam me with messages during the rest of the game after I tombstoned him/her. Crying about “ohh you never woulda killed me without tombstone, that’s so cheap, get better, you trash” etc. 
---
I don't know how he became like that but i can understand
---
Right, I don't even care if I end up just killing one person the entire match, just using chainsaw everytime is sooo much more fun!
---
Interesting perspective
---
there's also this [https://imgur.com/zhwZLvS](https://imgur.com/zhwZLvS)
---
Bond, iron will, adrenaline, dead hard, urban evasion (if your newer just plz don't tape down the crouch button) i'll throw self care here because as much as i refuse to use it's not a bad perk 
---
I had this happen to me the other day! It’s so frustrating omg lol
---
Come here big boy 
---
I know everyone says that but I just don't think she's very pretty tbh. All the killers but Pig and Plague are pretty ugly as well too imo 
---
Except there was a post awhile back of someone keeping track of this for hundreds of games and the stats came back that each box had roughly a 50 50 shot of containing the key, including the first one.
---
*mind remains unchanged*
---
I’ll take both thanks 
---
I’ve had a lot of other things happen to me while playing this game, but this is by far the worst. The worst thing was I thought that I could fix it by being hooked, but I ended up just be rescued only to not be able to run from the hook 
---
Managed to get a kill and a dc in 2/6 of the match and YOU’RE the noob. Fair enough.
---
Oh, well im not.
---
Could say the same to you.
---
"Me! I'm the special one! I have seen myself and therefore I know I'm the only special one! I'M SPECIAL!"
---
"Not that I would know since I'm outta legion games fast as fuck"
---
**Hmmmm...**
---
So what killers would you say A Nurses Calling works best for?
---
Once you get better at looping being injured really isn’t that scary unless it’s a killer like nurse or Spirit who don’t follow the general rules of looping. But against a doctor and you’re in the middle of suffocation pit you shouldn’t worry about healing since that can waste a lot of time you could be putting towards a generator.
---
Quentin 
---
I don't remember his story but the boil things on his arms make me feel sick :x
---
They’ll never understand that. Their selfishness overrides what’s decent overall.
---
It's the mending state. If deep wounds are applied to you via Feral Frenzy (Legion's power) or being hit with Borrowed Time active, you have to mend in order to prevent yourself from falling into the dying state. Once the bar runs out you can keep mending, but if you let go you instantly fall over.
---
Stalking also means you can see the silouette of the survivors. This is to avoid the use of addons that show auras after stalking them
---
I got flamed today for having NOED with plague (im still leveling her up no much of a choice) and the game ended before the gates were power. The thing i hate is getting looped in haddonfield with my rng windows luck. I wonder what survivor will complain if noed is nerfed, camping? Tunneling? Powerful addons? 
---
Hate to be that guy but some has to do it. an*
---
Mark Hoffman was such a dick, Jill Tuck wasn't a apprentice but I liked her at least, Dr.Gordon had the right to leave Mark chained up on the bathroom forever at the end of Saw 3d (and likeable as well), and Logan Nelson is fine.
---
Amanda Young...I love her (not romantically). 
---
I use brutal strength, save the best for last, sloppy butcher, and devour hope. I’ve tried many perk lineups and this works the best. I used to have enduring &amp; spirit fury as part of my perk build but I noticed that with clown, people tend to throw down pallets super early as soon as you throw a bottle at the loop so it’s not used as often. Might as well use something else while just breaking all the pallets with brutal strength. Save the best for last has been AMAZING since starting to use it on him. The reduced cooldown allows you to be right back on their tail once you hit them which is even better with clown as you can gain even more ground using bottles
---
That's the issue with the new ranking system, it does depip you.
---
The killers are ment to be discusting (exept the liscenced ones) dbd is still a horror game after all
---
Legion after getting ass clapped by jane
---
Fr I don't get why people do that shit
---
I understand I’m a red rank survivor but it’ll be better to heal and waist more time during a chance if you get hit for your team to do gens, instead of just getting hit and going down right away
---
So fun having this perk be active only when you get chased against stealth/low tr killers. To elaborate, with the chase system being so broken you can stand behind some obstacles to end the chase and it will charge.
---
People were having trouble finding games when top rank was easy to get to (time&gt;skill) and now there are even less red ranks
---
Thank fuck
---
Killers that don't really have to deal with loops, so Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, and to an extent, Freddy. It's still a decent perk on stealth killers like Pig, Wraith, and Myers, but the biggest problems they'll typically have is with loops, not with their stealth.
---
[https://www.deviantart.com/oo-fil-oo/art/DBD-HILLBILLY-624225802](https://www.deviantart.com/oo-fil-oo/art/DBD-HILLBILLY-624225802) &lt; I mean those zit-like things on his left arm. When you're in a lobby as him you can see them close up and it's so gross
---
Glorious.
---
Devs have stated they want it to be an uncomfortable experience. You can make it better by rebinding to a different key tho. Space is annoying to hit, so I use the 4 key. Scroll wheel works as well.
---
Nope, they just took the time in a Q&amp;A to confirm it affects it.
---
Weird that's happening from your location. I'm in Australia and a majority of my games are japanese players, most posts in the twitter hashtag for the game are in Japanese too. It's super popular there. 
---
Holy shit, I thought I was the only person that both empathized with playing in an SWF, *and* dodging that same lobby. Reading these comments, I think we're alone. 
---
It truly was a bright and dark time. Nah I didn’t farm anyone. Maximum gains could only be acquired through actual gameplay 
---
Gg man. Good work
---
Found the low rank in their SWF group 😂
---
Dead by Daylight: Now Playable
---
I did that once and no one came down :( 
---
Camping and tunneling isn't a perk, powerful addons are fair. They are annoying to go up against but that is what makes the game interesting. I wouldn't have a problem with noed if it shows the exposed status when it activates, or theres a totem counter 
---
So do something you actually have to pay attention and doesnt destroy your spacebar
---
Nurses is pretty good on Wraith and Pig imo. It's good for stealth killers since you can get within range to see them healing. If you're using a standard TR killer, they can just stop healing when they hear the start of the TR, and since it's larger than Nurse's 28m, you won't know they are there. 
---
I have my Pig P3, I play her a lot, and usually use that BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury. Nurse's is a solid option tho. Nurse's is my favorite perk in the game probably. It will guaranteed help at least once every single match.
---
I think you're just ungrateful. The matchmaking is great and wouldn't have it any other way. The reward for ranking up is the bragging rights and sense of achievement knowing that you ranked up! We all love seeing that red ring around our rank symbolizing that we're the best in the game. A lot of people see the long wait times as a bad thing but I believe it was done to let us have enough time to look at our rank 1 red ring! Rank means everything in this game yet you want them to add more of a reward than bragging rights? You entitled bastard, what else do you want?? 
---
There's also no such thing as crashing and infinite loading screens, it's actually the game trying to tell you that you play too much. Besides, the devs told us to try civilization for a while didn't they? So those "crashes" are really just the game's way of caring about our well being. 
---
The devs did a pretty good job so far😁 
---
damn i did twice and both games did a 3k
---
I think I do survivors a favor when I off these... things first 
---
It’s just a video game turbonerd 😂
---
You should do a video where everyone loads in hard to confirm the reason for one less gen. Unless glitch causes somebody to DC?
---
The pipping and emblems should have been changed first dammit
---
Actions speak louder than words. Saying you're not salty is meaningless when you were bothered enough to feel the need to make a topic to 'laugh' at him over, seeking validation from others over it.
---
If you weren't bothered by his comment you would have simply ignored it and moved on. Not jump online to point out to us that *"Omg, n00b takes all game to get his tier 3 then tells me gg ez when he finally grabs me after all that time!"* You just wanted validation and vindication that he was the loser, not you.
---
And yea, you wouldn't have posted it here if you weren't seeking validation. That's the entire point of sharing shit online. So i'll stop you there before you reply next about how you on top of not being salty, weren't seeking vindication.
---
So yea, you can say "I'm not salty. I'm just laughing" all you like. Read most of the replies here. No ones buying it. 
---
Just let it go and move on. 
---
You're also bitching about me looking to 'argue' with you, yet you're arguing with half the people in the topic yourself in every other post.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
Long story short:
---
Survivors hate them because they are annoying to go against (kind of like "its not that I CAN'T defeat you, it's just gonna be a chore to fight you") and Killers hate them because they're not that efficient as other killers (for instance, nurse pretty much does what legion can do but better)
---
ive done it with a full lobby already. just 4 gens spawned
---
I would choose this as a running animation, also running like Naruto lol.
---
Don't mean to play devils advocate here but why didn't you try to heal her? It's possible she just wanted you to heal hear since it's faster than her healing yourself. Not to mention you wouldn't have done nothing for 2+ minutes.
---
All I can think of while listening to this is "Could she make *any more noise*?!"
---
It was just an observation, chill out.
---
Judging from your tag though I can see why you feel insulted. Guessing you can't anti-loop so just cheese it with a braindead killer eh?
---
It's not mandatory on every killer. Some killers need it more than others but it's not mandatory.
---
The simple answer is to git gud. No, not the pretentious "lol git gud scrub" but actually learn how to REALLY play dead by daylight. As such you'll want to watch Damnnohtml's video "how to run all generic tiles. If the survivors are good and on a coldwind map, you probably won't do well unless you play a top tier killer since the loops are see through and have no room for mind games. 
---
Thanks for the laughs for this whole convo xD I'm completely a woman but yes I have always had sort of big arms and yes I do train as well
---
Get a good Oncologist 
---
Idk why people really feel like they have to bring it, when I play killer I really only bring it on Huntress but that's because she's slow and has no map pressure, as survivor unless I have super laggy skill checks I can hit ruin skill checks like 80-90% of the time so it's not a big deal 
---
Oh yeah doctor is terrifying 
---
Chill everyone, I'm fine with this all xD
---
The estimated wait time doesn't even show up for me and my friends anymore lmao
---
You know what... your right
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
I'd recommend using a different color for text or background for the text. Rather hard to see the text on be left.
---
Then again, terror radius size doesn't affect a chase and only really works against you. You gotta stay so much closer to get any charges. 
---
I don't mind the downvotes I just wish they'd come with a reply. I want to understand why killers who avoid boosted groups are the bad players, but the players using the boosts in the first place are the good ones. Somehow it's the SWF squads that swear they're not trying to get easy matches with Discord, they just want to enjoy their night..... But the killer?? Nah he's the sweaty one,
---
Ya I used to be a killer main. I still play killer frequently but I find survivor more enjoyable at the moment. It’s more relaxing in the sense that their is less pressure and I can go on my phone while doing gens xD 
---
Caught red-handed. 
---
I don’t think you hear what you are typing.  You are a rank what? 1 or 2 NURSE MAIN and complaining about not double pipping? DOUBLE PIPPING.  Where are the people here that can’t single pip?  I know there are 100 threads somewhere.  Honestly I would DC in your game just to stop your entitled elitism mindset.  Let’s stop and think for a moment why a survivor would DC against a nurse.  Maybe she’s broken might have something to do with it.
---
Memes are the only thing this sub is good for. If you want to know more high tier info go look on twitch. It's a much better place for this kind of knowlage.
---
I did try to heal them. That's why I went up to them, and stood beside them. That's why I run empathy to heal those when they need it. If you watch, you see her click her flashlight and go right back on the gen. 
---
Kinda like bandages
---
lul, I dont even play Legion :D
---
I just thought your complaint about ruin was hilarious
---
Deadass 🅱️
---
To my understanding the Legion "creedo" is as follows:
---
* **Frank** - "Default" and basically a tryhard. Any Prestige cosmetic automatically means they're a tryhard. Alternate color pallet skins probably means they're experienced but not the biggest asshat. Frank's Letterman Jacket (the red basketball hoodie) means that they know their way around Legion and are likely invested in the Killer.
---
* **Julie** - Noob. Like I haven't met a single Legion playing Julie who wasn't a noob or at least playing casually. Even if they have the expensive jean jacket cosmetic they're probably still a newbie/casual.
---
* **Susie** - Basic bitch thot. Saying "I play Susie" is akin to saying "I drink Starbucks." You think it gives you a personality and street cred but in reality 500 other people think the exact same thing you do.
---
* **Joey** - Either the biggest fucking tryhard this side of Rank 1 or a completely chill bro who's probably vaping while playing. No in between. Generally speaking if they have either the Julie mask or the skull mask they're chill. Otherwise they're a tryhard shithead.
---
Most likely during Halloween or Christmas. They don't want to make the ruin their precious bloodpoint economy. 
---
This is why you gotta get a skill check on a gen first, before you decide to find and break a hex. 
---
Of course if you spawn right next to it, pray that you’re cleansing Ruin
---
I don't see the point in playing a character if you don't use at least 1 of their teachables. As stated previously, it's a re-skin, so why not go play any other survivor from whom you unlocked the teachables? It's boring using the same build on every survivor, and people see switching up your load out as the devil's work. If I'm Laurie? DS, probably my standard perks to go with it. Adam? Deliverance, standard perks. Jeff? Breakdown, Deliverance, SC and BT. Hell, I'll even run OoO, Sole Survivor, Pebble and UE just to switch it up. 
---
*Dark sense* may be good because it allows you to see the killer once you’ve finished the gen
---
*Prove theyself* increases the gen repair speed of those around you
---
*Technician* will reduce gen repair sounds and when maxed will have a 30% chance to mute the gen skill check fail noises
---
I will agree hitboxes are fucking broken rn but as killer I have noticed less hit through pallet hits and as survivor they might have decreased a bit as well? Although the fast vault hitboxes are more broken than ever
---
&gt;stop relying on 4 soloqueue survivors for easy wins
---
It's not relying on soloqueue survivors "for easy wins" (what?), it's wanting a game this game was, you know, actually built around and balanced for. You said it yourself, you abuse the SWF system. This game wasn't designed for people to be using voice comms with it. This post screams of entitlement, salt, and someone who's never played killer for very long, if at all.

ITS TIME! FOR THE DOCTORS, DAILY... DOSE!!!

NEA IS A KILER BOIS IM DYING RN THIS SHIT SO FUNNY
---
yas gawd
---
Lol love his reply
---
Me too
---
I think they were all moried
---
&gt; Honestly I would DC in your game just to stop your entitled elitism mindset.
---
Literally against the rules of Dead by Daylight and a bannable offense but OK
---
This some interesting shit 🅱️, thanks for the upload😤👍🏼 Deadass want to know more 🙏🏼
---
It's only really a boon in my eyes. Given the new ranking system it really feels like the only way to do well on Gatekeeper. I main Trapper, though, who is a very time-intensive killer who's fairly easily genrushed. Same with Myers, my alt. To them it's a huge help because it has the potential to save a decent amount of time, allowing them the time they need to turn Survivors' lives into hell. 
---
However, whenever I play some killers, such as Leatherface, Billy, Doc, or Legion, it's pretty much a non-issue given how mobile they are and how easily they can both locate and apply pressure to Survivors in the early game. 
---
hol up
---
I've never been tested for OCD...
---
Should I?
---
I say okay how you want, it’s a game. Just don’t be an asshole (:
---
Paging /u/TattooedDaddyMyers
---
Prestige is a waste of time tbh
---
Yeah because you totally NEED to slow the game down that much 🙄
---
Very little? Cool, so if you love 2 million blood-points, I *challenge* you not to contact support. 
---
All survivors are the same but just skins of one another due to teachable perks. You generally want to level david first for We're Gonna Live Forever so you get more bloodpoints each match. Then you level up whoever you want.
---
People always talk about bad killers using it but never killers without all the perks yet. I have a 4th perk and i am not putting bloodhound in it over NOED
---
Yeah but it's still something you need to fall back on. I normally combine it with botany.
---
Ruin has its drawbacks too. Like when its gone 30 seconds into the game and becomes a wasted perk slot.
---
I had 1000+ hours before I realized that Hillbilly's  engraving add-ons stacked. Game changer. Just bring Brutal Strength... 
---
You can vault back pallets that you dropped, or that you could stun killers with pallets. Imagine my friend when I was running through every pallet dropping them down without a care in the world 
---
Yeah, they’re toxic..
---
Actually no difference. Outstanding. 
---
BRO YOU BECAME ONE OF THEM, while roasting them for chiming up abmmvecause they were or are rank 1 you brought up that you were rank 1!!!! THE DECEPTION
---
someone* ;)
---
I don't get the reference. Can you enlighten me?
---
Eyyyy! Just got the reddit name too.  
---
\*\*Shirtlessness Intensifies\*\*

&lt;3
---
you tell me
---
Always here. 
---
i'm kind of shocked that they didn't immediately DC LMAO
---
I could swear I hear some ingame sound when the lobby gets created, no matter what mute focus is set to.
---
You can return now. You were missed.
---
I hate it when I do that. Always accidental. 
---
eaz-E Bby kiLL3r
---
Looks like dodging SWF is back on the menu 
---
Hahahahaha same. I always thought players that crawled to rescue me from hooks in matches against hag were just waiting their time.
---
Thank you for seeing it!
---
Reminds me that I didn’t even know I could damage gens as killer. For months I was at a huge disadvantage for that lmao
---
hey man, disabled people play this game, you know? i'm not disabled but i do have what i suspect is the beginning stages of carpal tunnel and smashing one button over and over is more of a strain than you might think with that sort of thing.
---
Ruin is sort of useless half the time, actually. Still pretty good. 
---
"I erased time and leapt past it."
---
Joey, honey, I’m so sorry.
---
Kate would totally bang Jeff. 
---
Still, it's just a waste of time, and that waste of time was regarded in no support whatsoever from the developers who claim to care so much. It's depressing, and sucks, if this is what the game is gonna be with horrible support, I can no longer trust indie games such as this.
---
I was pointing out that you can be Rank 1 without shoving your e-dick in everyone's face. I awknowledge that Rank doesn't mean anything which is why I don't feel the need to bring it up in every conversation.
---
Rank one freddy
---
David and Dwight? Is that canon?
---
Why does this have so many upvotes...
---
But you brought it up. duuuuude.
---
Lucky guy wish this had happend to me looks fun :&lt; . i also hope they added more animations in game besides pointing out and calling to u
---
&gt;"We gathered a lot of feedback in the last weeks that will help us improve the general quality of the system."
---
"As it turns out, players didn't actually enjoy having an arbitrary wait time added before their lobbies start to fill, who would have thought? Our community surprised us every say!" 
---
If not, it should be. 
---
i think she is. but yeah, she is definitely not innocent-looking
---
i wonder if it was a visual bug caused by the downed survivor on top of it? that's really odd.
---
that kind of surprises me though as internet folks in 2019 tend to associate dyed hair with SJW's. but then again, this is Dead by Daylight, we're all gay and nice
---
actually i peaked rank 5 killer last season so thank for assuming things. As a nurse main ive beat multiple salty swfs, but pair me up with 4 soloqueue survivors and the games over before they get 2 gens done. I can tell from your little outburst that you've never played survivor before more importantly soloqueue survivor, go try it and we can talk like grownups
---
I had an idea for a killer perk that keeps their aura from being revealed unless they're within a certain radius (it disrupts Survivors' aura reading similar to how Sole Survivor does). It would certainly help with that element of surprise. 
---
None and nobody.
---
people out here downvoting with the sarcasm flying straight over their head
---
I think for the 0m clip because the survivor moved to a non blocked area that is what created the illusion of it being louder. Either way, useless perk lol.
---
*BEGONE HERETIC
---
I don't want it to be a perk. I just want you to be able to do in any match without wasting offerings or a perk slot
---
yeah and can we do something about people that DC on first down or hook pls?
---
Half the votes for shirtless David, half the votes for providing a David that can be undressed with your eyes.
---
That second swing looked like it should’ve connected.?
---
I’d rather face maybe potatoes at rank 15 than face definitely not potatoes while still at rank 15. Seeing those red ranks compared to your yellow ass hurts
---
It is in our hearts.
---
&gt;I can tell from your little outburst that you've never played survivor before
---
Actually, I'm a rank 1 survivor, so thanks for assuming things. Doesn't help your case, buddy. My points stand. 
---
You won't win with them. The killer mains cry for more and more survior nerfs deapite the fact that killer is braindead easy now and try to justify it with "TEH SWF!!" But as we all know from playing the game they dodge any lobby they don't like anyway, especially with swf.
---
They just want solo survivors kept weak so they can have the easy win.
---
On top of this all that crying about swf but like 50% of games ive played tonight had an ebony in them, and the only 3 killers I ever saw ere nurse, billy and legion. Fucking 5 blink nurse too.
---
These people just suck at the game but can't admit it.
---
Yeah, the new lobby queues get (from what I've seen on Reddit) a little bit of hate for still being slow. They're faster than they used to be, though, so at least there's that.
---
The ps4’s queue time is terrible again!!!! 
---
I like the Ninja wraith one with the machete looking weapon 
---
Bubba is fun to play with kinda love the noise he make even after u drop a palet on him sounds like a  pig
---
That's stupid. You can enjoy the way the character looks and still just use perks from other characters. 
---
&gt;so why not go play any other survivor from whom you unlocked the teachables?
---
The entire point of teachables is that you can use them on any character once you've unlocked them. You can enjoy the way the character looks but want to use different perks.
---
&gt;people see switching up your load out as the devil's work
---
It's not that people hate the idea of switching to different perks, it's that most of the perks in this game just suck and people don't want to put themselves at a big disadvantage just for "build diversity".
---
Let others enjoy the game the way they want.
---
I need to go re watch the saw movies
---
I did like knowing more or less how long it would take me to get in a game.... like if I have an hour to play and killerqueues are horrible, its nice to know so I can just sneak in a few extra survivor games instead...
---
this is just a joke right? evil dead would be a hilarious crossover.
---
The problem is since loads of people are depipping the high ranks will end up at my potato ranks and just make the situation WORSE
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
That feel when you just bought the outfit because you liked the killer and didn’t want to be a basic anymore. Single tear.
---
This is the catch-22 though. Survivors can do great skillchecks because they get so much practise thanks to every killer bringing Ruin. It's through Ruin alone that I can hit to many now.
---
Now with the changes to Ruin practically every single killer is bringing it. It's only going to give people more practise.
---
Check out the streamer EdgarAlanBroLive on twitch 👌
---
Yes, videos from over a year ago with some of the best players in the game, mostly playing against randoms. Great example
---
This ranking system always complicates everything about this game without purpose or reward - just replace it with something else, it just makes things needlessly worse.
---
Do some shit where instead of rank being based on pips, it's based on time played. And based on time played you are given a rank.
---
Put some requirement of time played on each rank and match players up with the closest rank.
---
And just leave it at that, the matchmaking shouldn't be affected by low population of people on certain ranks since many people should have plenty of time played.
---
The only complication could be when a SWF has a survivor with a lower rank, if there is more high ranks than low ranks - just give them the harder challenge in the benefit of the killer.
---
I just think this current ranking system is ruining everything. 
---
You made garbage points. Just like every other salty killer main on this post you think voice comms are unbalanced because you want to be able to take advantage of the fact that 3 survivors will go for the unhook because no one knows whos going. You wanna be able to take advantage of the farming soloqueue survivors who dont give a shit about anyone but themselves as long as they get a stack. You wanna be able to take advantage of noed being a free kill at the end because everyones out the exit gates once they see it despite anyone on hook. You want to be able to take advantage of survivors getting downed then immediately dcing. Must be nice, if i was a killer main id want that too. But dont sit here and tell me the games balanced if you take comms out for survivors.
---
I fucking wish. At least I could just splash some water on my face and be instantly healed.
---
She also put a trap on me, but I couldn't see it neither take it off, so my head popped up randomly later :'c
---
Shirtless Myers shirtless David.

Well how tf does a bug like that occur in the first place where you had a P3 lvl 50 killer and it goes back to P2 lvl 50 out of no where 
---
listen kid stop saying all this he said she said shit "oh im a rank 1 killer and survivor whos never ran noed so i know what im talking about" for all i know you're a rank 15 killer who gets curbstomped by swfs every game because you have no clue how to play killer and run noed every game and thats why youre so bitter right now. In soloqueue, "outwitting" the killer means taking full brown outfit claudette and urban evasioning in grass, letting your teammates take the chase while you do gens and eventually get hatch or the exit gate. Thats your interpretation of the meaning of survive together or not, maybe it means survive together or die trying, not survive together or let the carry die on the hook so i can get my 5k bp. My whole post is based on the premise that killers need to stop being so salty towards swfs as its in the game for a reason and you guys need to stop sticking to your bias that the games only balanced if comms arent a thing, meanwhile havent played enough survivor games to know how much more fun the game is when you arent getting farmed or left to die
---
Doesn't that go against the whole point of a ranking system if you're doing so good you actually need to sandbag a bit?
---
I'm still waiting for shirtless Meg.
---
It wasn't happening nearly as bad, but  agree with what you say though
---
LMAO bro people are pissed, not the time for sarcasm as the downvotes clearly show xD

has her actress been in any other big movies?  I loved her in the SAW series
---
I think it's good that you can't tell if people are in a swf anymore because it's not fair for them. sure the killer gets put at a disadvantage but not every swf is toxic, i know when i play with my friends we're just having casual fun.
---
I have a friend that tried to convince me that setting off a trap then immediately crouching will stop her from being able to teleport to it.
---
Abundant and obnoxious.
---
People are salty because they died, simple as that. I think its fine as it is right now.
---
The problem is that with the old matchmaking people have the problem you are having with the new one - which shows that reverting it's not the solution either.
---
My personal experience along with everyone I know, was positive - before it took forever to get into games.
---
Imagine calling people selfish for not caring about their friends rank to play a video game with them. Die.
---
If you do not have a hatchet, pick up the hatchet of the ~~man~~ locker in front of you!
---
I just kinda had some time and spare material why not make the best cosplay in the world. Dud you have talent.
---
I'm not convinced it could be done in the current build, do you have examples otherwise? Things change.
---
Why have you come in here just to act like an uppity little twat?
---
That video was actually painful. You just know she was crouched near the hatch somewhere. 
---
I'm just here to say, I enjoy your walls of text whenever they appear on this sub. What about Sloppy Butcher instead of, say, Whispers?
---
The old matchmaking was hell for me and my friends, there's a reason they tried to change it. But seems they fixed a problem for some, and created a new one for others.
---
Prestige takes skill? 
---
Sorry for all the questions but... What is source filmmaker? Like how do you get the characters to pose and stuff?
---
Most wikis about games are riddled with misinformation, it’s very likely that this is no different. 
---
It’s not BHVR who makes and maintains the wiki, it’s the community
---
It's balanced without voice comms because the game was designed that way, the average survivor isn't handicapped compared to their peers or the competition by playing without voice crutches, and cake fucking easy to tell how many perks and game mechanics are undermined with it's use. I have no other way of communicating to you what kinds of benefits you and I get when we play with voice comm, benefits that *you already acknowledged* in other posts to me. 
---
&gt; Almost everyone plays both. Yet, I still doubt you're rank 1 or even in red ranks on survivor. That's okay, there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Except I have. You don't need to believe me, there's nothing wrong with that. I know the truth and that's what matters. I don't need to provide "proof" because someone decided not to believe me. You don't matter to me. 
---
I'd call xbox, and email the devs.
---
I think she looks pretty cute, not sure why you disagree.
---
I'd contact Customer Support, also check your email for a transaction receipt to see if the money actually went out
---
I get way more Shapes and Doctors than Billys.  Actually, I get very few Billys, and judging by the PSN trophies, very few people actually play Billy on PS4.
---
both have proven to be extremely helpful every time I've had to contact them.
---
Funny I had this happen to me too while playing the plague. Everyone disconnected simultaneously while I was lunging. Was this during the new matchmaking or was this after it was taken down?
---
Well it sort of depends on how it's done. You can easily pull of dyed hair and achieve the "cutsie kawaii" sort of deal. I'm not sure if they did that with Susie, but they got close. 
---
Nothing is above adrenaline.
---
Survivors you want to be able to take it off never get it off. Survivors you don't want to be able to get it off first try always do. 
---
 Had a game where a Kate got screwed over by her team and left for dead basically. She couldn't find the hatch and was desperately trying to get the trap off. I was following her to keep the chase up and help. Luckily I found the hatch so I downed her and dropped her by it. If I hadn't found the hatch she would've died, it was so close.
---
It's typically either cleansed before anyone can be downed or all totems have been cleansed before the last gen is done. i never called you a survivor main, and I can tell you aren't because you have some legitimate insights into the game. you're right that it's not necessary, but no perks are "necessary" merely helpful. Those are fairly weak killers for most people but it depends on personal play style. I personally main Freddy and routinely get to rank 5 even though I can only play on weekends for a few hours at a time. And NOED is kinda mandatory on any endgame build. I'm not saying it's perfectly balanced and amazingly fun every time it's used. I am saying that it's not COMPLETELY op, has some pretty easy counters, doesn't go off about a third of the time, and is generally pretty easy to deal with. it's fine the way it is, but some people will abuse it, same with everything in this game.
---
And yet, survivor still isn't difficult to play or succeed with. You don't need voice-comm crutches to beat a killer. You'll be ok without them, too. 
---
The most boring killer matches are when you completely destroy 4 solo queue survivors without even trying. Yet the reddit killers want that to be the norm when they play killer. Its just sad. 
---
I’ll solo queue as survivor and try my hardest to save everyone while sacrificing myself but it gets discouraging when you run a killer around for 2+ minutes using minimal pallets and a gen barely gets popped. When you go down you see 1 is in the basement searching the chest and 2 claudettes were crouched by the trees with a flashlight watching you get chased so they can go for an “epic” flashlight save.
---
I’m certain that its not even about SWFs being strong at this point, its about reddit killers wanting 4ks handed to them on a silver platter. I’ve seen streamers solo queue and everyone joins seperately, but it turns out they were all pretty good survivors while the killer wasnt very good and they all escape. Killer immediately says in post game chat “fucking loser SWF tryhards” and leaves. Killer is the easiest its ever been at the moment and yet people still find excuses for their mediocrity.
---
Feels real bad, man.
---
More than you know. I’m another thread someone told me to die and not take the game so seriously.
---
They have a tattoo of the logo...
---
maybe someone will save and edit
---
would be amazing if someone did tho lol 
---
I'm like 80% sure they are going to revert the rank system soon similar to the matchmaking. Considering how much backlash they are getting from it &amp; that its complicating adept achievements, I doubt they will keep it on live for long. 
---
no but you do need at least one other survivor who isnt a complete idiot to at least stand a chance against a mediocre killer. good luck finding that while solo queueing.
---
No, good not get my stalk on as Myers, Gave me a ruff start, and i made several poor choices.
---
hehe thank u :-)
---
Yeah I agree 100%. In a competitive multiplayer game, just having extra challenge isn’t enough of an incentive to use the perk. We either need the perk reworked to fit a specific play style (probably a stealth based one, giving it the full IW effect) or give people more incentives to use it (with extra bloodpoints end of trial)
