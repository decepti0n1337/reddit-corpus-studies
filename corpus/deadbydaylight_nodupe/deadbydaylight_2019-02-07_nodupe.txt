Adrenaline is toxic? 
---
And here i thought being a swf all with ds and flashlights was being toxic
---

---
Guess ill just have to not use a clutch perk anymore, even though half the time the killer brings noed anyway &gt;_&gt;
---
---
---
I never hated Doc that much, Nurse can go fuck herself though
---
They KNEW i had NOED it spawned right beside the gate  then suddenly a claudette rushes me i down her put one on the hook went back and the other claud was healing her and boom dead
---
Why do people hate him so much?
---
The only dumb thing I've seen him do is put leather face above Hag and Doctor and some other killers that are better 
---
Excuse me for asking but why the hell do we care
---
P3 feng is scary change my mind
---
Their ping was likely bad and they desynced. My guess at least.
---
If they kill you, they're better
---
No I am not wrong. In any game the only way to get better is to grind and get better through playing more. Nobody is top tier at any game overnight. So your whole point as to why rank doesn't matter is completely void. 
---
Once again if rank does not matter then a rank 1 versing a rank 20 should be fair, especially since you believe that all you need to do is grind to get to a higher rank. You need skill to get to higher ranks, you can get there perkless and without addons, so that also disables the need for grinding while enhancing the need for skill. 
---
I enjoy using Adrenaline. I'm the complete opposite of a Toxic player though. It's a big reward for staying alive and finishing all gens. It's a waste of a slot through the game, but that's a risk I'm willing to take
---
Because people didn’t like his opinion 
---
Youd deserve it for knowingly anusing a bug
---
*Feng Min grunts*
---
Haha
---
Console Aim.
---
This reminds me of The Whitest Kids You Know “Baby skull seeking bullets” except it’s survivor skull seeking hatchets. 
---
It was only with one survivor. And he had great ping (Everyone Green, not even Yellow) 
---
Fucking christ people, just spend the 5.99 on LF and grind him out. BBQ will increase your QOL in this game dramatically and I can promise you that most of that money is going to the copyright holders anyway.
---
Most def gonna agree with ya.
---
Well she isn't OP but doesn't suck. Sounds about right
---
&gt; shitless david
---
Is that at&amp;t Operator Shalonda Dykes? 
---
This happened to me ages ago on Penn Asylum. Was getting chased and *right* before I got hit the second time, I teleported 50 feet away next to Claud on a genny.
---
What about dying light? 25% speed reduction seems pretty fucking great
---
I don't really see the harm in adding one. You can already tape a crosshair to your screen and if you're on PC you can use an overlay.
---
Lack of mobility, and if he can't tier 2 quickly, he has huge trouble building momentum
---
4 man swf squad goes against poor rank 15 and absolutely destroys the killer. "Rank doesn't matter"
---
He noticed last second too wow
---
Shhhh, you didn't see anything
---
It's funny that everyone makes memes about killer's hit boxes, because lately when I play killer I'll swing when I'm extremely close to a survivor and sometimes the hit still doesn't land.
---
Precisely this. Plus, controller sensitivity is balls, so 360 melee hachets are far more difficult.
---
Thanks
---
Don’t worry, in a month and a half a new killer will come out and fall into the DBD outrage culture we’ve all come to “love”
---
I think this last patch put Survivor hitboxes out of wack in general. 
---
Look at this doooood! Haha
---
No perks are truly toxic, but if there is one addon that is toxic without a doubt then it would be the combat straps.
---
Rules of the board say No Name Shaming! Admin please take this down 
---
I play both killer and survivor, so I never do any of that. Worst I'll do is be looking for the hatch if I'm the last survivor, but even then, sometimes I really can't be bothered, so I fast vault or something to alert the killer, or crawl towards them if I'm down (which actually resulted in the killer taking me to the hatch once, which was nice :3 and I'm pretty sure they weren't going to do it anyway, cos I wasn't the last survivor yet. Don't remember all the details, but it was the sort of situation where you're unlikely to be the one dropped at the hatch)
---
Thanks captain
---
If the only argument is basically "thank God not everybody can do this" i.e. Nurse, it's still a problem.
---
I’m okay on teabags it’s the excessive ones that get me, pallet drop? Bag. Get through a loop? Bag! 360? Flash? DS? It’s like Holysmokes I’m gonna camp you and depip. I’ve been in games where I teabag like an asshole but I’m expecting assholery in return. The amount of salt from a bagging survivor after getting caught and camped is my favourite 
---
You're right, I shouldn't introduce violence into this chill, Christian game.
---
But he has add-ons that let him get tier 2 and tier 3 super quick 
---
E v e r y b o d y  n e e d s  t o  s q u a r e  u p.
---
True. But the fact he is also predictable, and has a hard time protecting totems, which limits his ability to prevent smart survivors from finishing gens. He's my most conflicted, but overall his inconsistency makes me think he should be D atm. I'm hoping he gets some tweaks in the right direction.
---
Just like how ZubatLEL counters nurse 
---
But those aren't their personalities, it's literally their functions. 
---
That’s a bit unfair. Pandora was created to be curious. It wasn’t entirely her fault that she opened it. The real sad person is Prometheus relative.
---
ALL OF THE SURVIVORS ARE GEN RUSH JOCKIES TONIGHT WHILE I'M TRYING TO HAVE A FUN GAME AS HUNTRESS ON THE BIGGEST AND WORST DAMN MAPS IN THE GAME. HOW DARE THEY RUIN MY FUN AND KEEPING ME FROM MY OBJECTIVE IN THE GAME WHEN THEY'RE COMPLETING THEIRS.  
---
but seriously though, stop. i want a game that lasts longer than 4 minutes please. thx &lt;3
---
At least it IS next to a generator, LOL. If it was one of the spawns in the middle of nowhere, dead out in the open, that is literally worst case scenario. Atleast with that one, there is a percent of games where you will be able to defend both the totem and generator depending on the order of generators that are completed and your map presence during the game.
---
Thank you. 
---
If i play a rank twenty with my skill, i can loop and 360 them the whole game, compared to an average of 30 seconds before i take a hit at rank 1 with no pallets
---
Rank matters, it just doesnt mean everyone is going to be the same skill level
---
And are you omnipotent? You have no idea what they're doing outside of those moments you see them crouching somewhere. I've had people sandbag me because they think I'm "just hiding", when I know the killer's nearby and I don't want to interact with them, after doing saves, heals, and gens all game. That kind of thinking is dumb.
---
Pratt
---
Toxicccc. I love it. If I was that hooked survivor, I’d be laughing my ass off lol.
---
I very recently tried the nurse for the first time (I sucked) and a survivor told me to end my life 
---
Usually the 1 or 2 people who are left appreciate it. I think it's shitty to leave because of the killer, especially when queue times can be insane. At least this way, we all get some more points than me just killing them fast.
---
Bro this is the Dead by Daylight subreddit. Post what ever this is somewhere else. 
---
Please we need to have justice for this ace main! For just one flashlight a day we can save ace mains all around the world!
---
r/dbdgonewild ?
---
I concur. Legion takes some serious skill. 
---
I already asked it before that comment^. I asked what sensitivity should I use for both survivor and killer?
---
One of the most accurate lists I’ve seen so far
---
&gt; However, you don't have a terror radius
---
technically a 6 metre terror radius, and with M&amp;A it drops to 0.
---
Myers- stalky boi
---
Freddy- sweater boi/ nap time
---
They tried that and somehow survivors abused it so badly that they couldn't implement it
---
I just started playing and only have a couple of level 15+ Killers and I hover around the 12-14 rank range. There's nothing more obnoxious than getting shit talked after a match with "ggez" or "lol baby killer". Honestly if BHVR ever wants this game to have a bigger following than 20k concurrent players they have got to do something about the toxicity at higher ranks. 
---
Silence warp is such a powerful add-on, that even on aware survivors who gen tap, it's a free hit. Combined with surveillance buff and disc, you can stall out gens near indefinitely. No other killer, can protect gens or totems as well. Just knowing she has the add-on puts gen pressure map wide. 
---
The fact this strategy has no counter play to prevent a hook is insane. And she's stronger at loops mid-lategame than Micheal, due to mind games with warp. 
---
oh god... i could only imagine 
---
I just leveled up my hag......................................
---
If it's any consolidation hooks used to just be one way, so face camping was literally not able to be beat. The multi direction hooks nerfed it ALOT
---
the average rank 15 player isn't going to be good. Likely won't have the number of perks the average player at ran 1 has.
---
Literally Fucking Me
---
:P
---
I've got absolutely nothing against SWF, I think it really adds to the game being able to work together with your friends, the only thing I find a fun killer is when I'm up against 3 people way above my rank and only one I'm on par with.
---
I really appreciate you taking the time for this feedback, never really looked into streamers so I'll take your suggestion and watch some of his stuff tonight after work.
---
That's an angle I wouldn't have even considered looking at.
---
Finding a solution to pallet looping is definitely something I need to work on but that's going to come with time and practice.
---
The mind games are something I'm definitely keen to start learning, as a survivor I loved the terror of never knowing what the killer was going to do, I want to be able to offer that same experience once I improve.
---
Who do you usually play as? What perks do you find most important?
---
r/whooosh
---
YOU MADE ME REALISE THAT I GOT THE HEX: RUIN FROM SHRINE EARLIER TODAY EVENTHOUGH I ALREADY OWN HAG. I'M DUMB.
---
Thanks! I play killer and survivor at R1 on PS4. Console players are way more casual on average, but alot of newer players get introduced via console. So figured I may as well weigh in with some potential meta differences.
---
Let me ask you the same question, but flip it so that is relates to what you are saying: so you are saying that rank 20 is proof of being good at this game?
---
Ah yes, because playing immersive means that you're automatically worse than everyone else. You don't have to be the best at chases and run meta perks, etc in order to be skilled at the game. If you're still doing objectives while playing super immersed why should that take away from your skill as a survivor? I honestly don't see why You're still trying to argue such a ridiculous point. Everyone has different playstyles and reaching higher ranks takes skill, you can't just grind and have zero skill, and somehow still reach red ranks. 
---
Lucky is an understatement... I can't get myself to ever play a killer if I don't have BBQ on them. I prestige my Myers, and didn't get bbq tier 1 until lvl 145...
---
Amen.
---
Rank 1 on both ps4 as well. 
---
**I think we did a pretty GOOD job so far!**
---
You already know it, don’t worry I got more
---
[removed]
---
Shhh, don’t question the early game killers too much. Devs were still learning how lore works lol.
---
Anything that doesn’t make sense, chalk it up to the Entity giving him extra power.
---
And hey, at least his actual weapon is the spine of his boss so that connects a bit.
---
Also happens to me on PS4
---
Wasn't being a dickhead and wasn't trying to be funny, but live in your fantasy world if you want 
---
First thing is you gotta realize is his was one of the first kills so they ain’t got much in the first place but the basically really went crazy after realizing he’s killed so many people with out even knowing and killed his boss and took his skull/spine then they left the rest vague like with everyone 
---
It's a rule that "exists", if I'm in a good mood idc. If it's the last guy and hatch is available go for it, but mid match it won't fly
---
I personally think he’s an asshole based of his twitter but I’ve never watched any videos or anything else 
---
Rank 18 players are usually ppl who are still new at the game. But again, just because someone is high rank, doesnt mean they're any good. 
---
There's a little justification if the survivor teabags at every pallet drop or intentionally aggravates the killer. Otherwise, fair point. 
---
He forgot to blur his steam account, quick, doxx him bois!
---
How many attempts did this take? 3d printing is all about that trial and error lmao.
---
Right. Three comrades at full health with guaranteed escape. Totally has a reason to stay. 
---
I completely agree with you. Even though a lot of the times it doesnt add too much, I still cant see myself ever playing survivor without WGLF. Something needs to be changed, because it is so much easier to gain bloodpoints as killer than survivor.
---
Mine definitely sounds like the preferable situation, haha. Was this mid-animation??
---
Do you mean you only managed to get one perk per bloodweb? Because that usually happens and the entity takes the other one.
---
If only one perk is spawning per bloodweb than that is weird and undoubtedly a bug. But there’s usually a lot of random little bugs after updates, so.
---
Awww that's so nice. I usually get a "you fucking suck" message 😒
---
They definitely get plenty of mistakes to pick on.
---
A lot of people are complaining about tunneling, if you've already wounded one survivor, is it bad form to keep chasing them even if you see another potential target? Where do you draw the line between working towards a kill and tunneling? If that makes sense
---
Well didn’t this guy have noed? Also I always stay and wait for everyone. You never know what’s gonna happen.
---
God pallet
---
That depends do you like JoJo?
---
I'll drink to that. NOED for the sake of Karma. 
---
Myers - DADDY
---
(At least I assume that’s how most of the fan base sees him, given how much shirtless fan art I’ve seen lol.)
---
Should've Mori'd his ass
---
You should see my place of employment lol
---
IM WITH YOU IN THIS ONE! I HATE WHEN SURVIVORS COME IN AND ITS THAT LAST MOFO WHO IS SITTING THERE NOT READYING UP AND IS CHANGING HOW THEY LOOK FOR A WHOLE MINUTE! IT MAKES ME PISSED SO THAT ASSHOLE GETS FACECAMPED AND TUNNELED WITH A MESSAGE AFTERWORD, WHILE THE REST OF HIS SQUAD RUNS OUT THE EXIT GATES! I WISH THE DEVS WOULD DROP THIS TIME FROM 1:00min to .30sec!
---
hope you didn't want we'll make it 3
---
Would've been even better if someone had been about to come in that door at the end and you could see a face in the glass.
---
Farming off hooks for points is just scummy, but that also doesn't detract from skill. It's the same if the killer hard tunnels for a kills every match. They could be extremely skilled, but just doing a scummy tactic. 
---
Do you even know what ruin does? If you destroy ruin you can breeze through gens. Even if you can always hit greats, without ruin it makes the gen progress faster. I honestly don't see what you're trying to say here. Gens go faster without ruin, so destroying ruin makes survivors pressure the killer faster. If 4 people are looking for it then they most likely aren't swf and think that the others are doing gens. It's quite easy to come to that conclusion. 
---
thats and "ez baby killer" im just like yeah i know i dont play this killer often
---
Not only that, but I'm getting really fucking tired of the amount of killers who camp me, essentially making me waste 2 minutes of my life, and me ending with like 2k BP unless I want to suicide on the hook and screw over my teammates.
---
Seriously, I don't BM, I don't even have Decisive Strike on any of my guys, and I avoid anything that might piss someone off... so why I've run into the amount of people who face camp is fucking mind boggling. Even if they're not camping me, camping other people and allowing us to just bang out the gens still results in almost none of us getting any meaningful BP gains.
---
Fake pallet *doctor* *enters*
---
Yeah, best save it for after Rank Reset when you have tier III in all those perks and decent add-ons. 
---
As a Freddy main, I am ok with this.
---
As a survivor main, I am not the biggest fan, but it does have something simple and enjoyable starting next to everyone else.
---
RIGHT NOW I WAS PLAYING A GAME. I DID ALL 5 GENS WITH NO HELP BECAUSE THE OTHER 3 PLAYERS WERE FUCKING AROUND AND SO WAS THE KILLER. SO I REPORTED THEM. EVEN AFTER I LEFT THE GAME THEY WERE ALL MESSING AROUND WITH EACH OTHER, GIVING EACH OTHER MORE POINTS.
---
lmao just stun the entity with the pallet duh
---
*laughs in Nurse main*
---
Wish I could've. 🤷‍♀️
---
That laugh tho
---
They exist just to mock us.
---
No he didnt. Trapped and camped his ass. 
---
Oddly fitting that it's legion. 
---
That’s exactly what we were saying about Freddy 
---
Sorry for the late reply. Yeah just Quentin. However, I could hook him on another hook so yeah I don’t think it was a hack more just a bug. They change the look of the hooks during events so maybe that messes with your interaction with some of them? 
---
Freddy and Dr are way worse.
---
I enjoy it. 
---
Or super unsafe if theres a killer on the loose...
---
Thats true, but again, rank doesnt indicate your skill level.
---
Is that the new killer in the background?!
---
^Godzilla new killer confirmed.
---
Lag spike mayhap.
---
Oh i think i just use default. I never realy bother with sensitivity
---
Atomic Breath mori would be insane!
---
Throw down the pallet to get the killer's attention. 
---
Considering self care got nerfed and is a major time waster if the killer uses Sloppy Butcher I wouldn't say its a crutch at all. It's a given that you should be able to heal yourself considering the fact you make noise unless you have Iron Will and would go down very easily if you started working on a gen while injured.
---
Sprint Burst has become a lot worse since the exhaustion nerf and if you save it then you're forced to move at walking speed which slows down the game quite a bit, plus if you mistime it then you could get hit anyway so there's not much point in it. The only thing it allows is when using it after an unhook but even then you shouldn't really need to use it if the killer isn't camping.
---
And smh Borrowed Time wouldn't be an issue if killers didn't camp. The only time it becomes a problem is if you tunnel or just not go for the unhooker. Instead of waiting for the unhook just hit the other survivor, they'll get the unhook and then just down them and let the other run free. Not like they'll get very far and hey, you just got 300 more points than if you had tunneled the other one.
---
TLDR; none of those survivor perks are crutches and if you compare them to NOED then you don't really know what you're talking about, sorry :/
---
I will add to this from the killer's perspective--it's flat out disrespectful. People can't seem to deal with the consequences of their own pathetic plays and you're depriving the killer of points and experience, as well as morale in casual gameplay. I'm sick of those idiots. 
---
It should've. The End
---
Too bad, i enjoy discussing this. I guess you know that you're wrong. GG. 
---
I’m unfamiliar with that name.  Is it Italian?
---
You are an enemy of the people
---
Sometimes I don't even blame people who do it
---
I prefer washing my asshole
---
LMFAO relate my dude
---
So my game freezes. It's a fluke. I really wanted to play and not pointlessly waste an offering, BUT I GUESS I'M JUST AN ASSHOLE 
---
nurse has counter plays, being inmersed, ik it can be boring but that doenst mean that nurse is badly designed
---
Is it bad that the concept of mercy never occurred to me until I read your comment?
---
the real question is could you even vault it if you threw it down
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I too have been given shit for having NOED equipped even though 0-1 gens were done. Don't understand why they cry about it when it wasn't even remotely close to being used. Its not like cleansing totems doesn't prevent it or anything.
---
Cool idea I always say on stream
---
For every gen that gets completed break a totem and when there's 1 gen left (especially if all 4 surv are still alive) then look for the totem, I've hit rank 3 as surv purely because this meta is so gen focused that noed is even more common and as such I just break totems, instead of complaining about the perk you could adapt your playstyle and handle it, heck on average 5 gens with 4 survivors alive is about 15 minutes, that gives you 15 minutes to break 5 totems and then help with gens if needs be. :) 
---
Most youtubers who rank the survivor perks still rank these perks as the clutch perks in early 2019. And I like how you say they are all crap, but don't say which ones are actually good. Also, NOED is really not that hard to beat. Did you know totems exist in this game that you can destroy? I know, shocker!🤷
---
Yeah but I mean he has a lot of random guests on. He’s had musicians before too like Dan Auerbach, Travis Barker yesterday. You’re probably right tho but I think a long interview with Johnny would be fucking cool. That dude I’m sure has a lot  of intense stories from the road 
---
4 hex totems? OP I feel math wasn't your strong suit in school... 
---
Noed is fine and has counters, that apparently many reddit users arent capeable of using.
---
While in reality, as soon as I Hit Red ranks, my noed barely even procs, which is the reason why I dont use it
---
I thank the entity I have never gone against legion on console, from everything I’ve heard, they sound horrible.
---
I do agree they should focus on balancing the current killers first. Huntress is fine though.
---
neither yours.
---
1. Ruin
---
2  Devour
---
3-4 Haunted Grounds
---
and what a colorful match making
---
BBQ is ridiculous (not asking for a nerf), you can earn 50k bp just for playing the game. WGLF is a nice idea, but it requires you to go out of your way for the bonuses. If it was a stack for each generator you completed, more people might run it, but WGLF encourages and rewards farming. 
---
The main reason survivors earn less is that they can keep their addons and items if they win, and then also get free ones via Plunderers Instinct and Ace In The Hole, but it's a scuffed way of thinking, as you only get to keep your stuff if you escape. 
---
Huntress release was on anither level as personally no killed who got released for free or paid manage to break the top three most op killers except her so it felt good
---
Plus personally I feel I can play huntress and just chill, it gives me a lot more of a chill vibe in matches while I'm on huntress

That is by far my favourite accidental description of what it's like at rank 20 ever
---
HOLY SHIT YES. FUCKING RUN AROUND THE KILLER HUT FOR 2 MINUTES TBAGGING THE SHIT OUT OF ME AND LOOPING ME THROUGH WINDOWS AT WRAITH, THEN I START TUNNELING YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU DONT ESCAPE, THEN YOU COMPLAIN SAYING IM NOT PLAYING FAIRLY. SOME SURVIVORS ARE COCKSUCKERS.
---
I missed this meme format. &lt;3
---
Always respond to salt and toxicity with kindness. It puts those kind of people on full tilt. 
---
I’m just wondering  besides breaking full totems what are the counters? 
---
Feel free to use it 😉 (sadly there is not a non sexual wink emoji)
---
There was a buff that made it so you can not really track her once she starts phasing which made her drastically more deadly.
---
There's a color for every rank aside from the brown 20 to 17, didn't catch that at first
---
Anyone who’s willing to even play a killer and do their best is good in my book. I’ve tried killer and I know it’s not easy
---
[Yea seems about right](https://i.imgur.com/Iyf8wqG.jpg)
---
It has a very safe escape route. Go the the wooden block between the two doors and see where the killer comes from, after that run the other way immediately and you can then make it to one of two pallets that is guaranteed to spawn outside the building. 
---
exactly that, and this shouldnt be a Problem for anyone higher than rank 10. 
---
There are only a few Spots and you can even use small game/maps  if you struggle with finding totems
---
Once you learned how to play her , that bitch a beast
---
Play myers and just camp the hex its so mich gun lol
---
Don't bother arguing with people on this subreddit.  
---
You wait at the exit gates and that means you're evil. You can't win these discussions because most of the people on this subreddit are trash players.
---
But its the REASON i use NOED. It punishes cocky survivors  who stick around instead of GTFO. I cant tell you how many times ive killed people t bagging at the exit gates  who have being toxic all game. Its legit the best feeling i get in this game.
---
So what's their ship name?  JeBill?  Billeef?
---
Damn I guess I just never checked it out because I don’t play hag. Of the ones I mentioned, which perk you think you’d get rid of?
---
MY HEX RUIN GOT SPAWNED RIGHT INFRONT OF 3 SURVIVORS. INSTANTLY CLEANSED WITHIN THE FIRST FEW SEC OF THE GAME. KILL ME NOW
---
Cool asf
---
"OHTOFU" is on the actual video though. I feel like that's enough.
---
Can relate 
---
Eh, it also punishes random solo players who have  had noed 3 games in a row. But it doesnt really matter seeing as people should just take out totems anyway
---
thanks my dude!
---
Probably be way too strong for someone like Nurse
---
assuming they're a terror radius based killer and dont have any cloak (wraith/pig) and they dont trap the stairs (trapper/hag) they dont blink up onto you and ignore the pallets (nurse), and they dont rotate towards you and around the crates with any killer that isnt freddy.
---
3rd times rhe charm

r/subifellfor
---
Wow, I actually quite enjoy all of these and they seem very well balanced, good job!
---
Only question is for Polycythemia, I'm guessing you're not forever injured like No Mither, and those status effects only proc when you are hit? Otherwise, people would probably never run it lol
---
I always just let them carry me since I never use DS and the odds of getting free arent that great to begin with unless you have luck on your side. 3/10 they bring me to the hatch and I send a happy gg message.
---
That was back in the before time though. In the long long ago.
---
Can someone explain to me what's so bad about having dedicated servers? Every multiplayer game I've played in the last 10 years played better with dedicated servers.

Dark Souls 3 invasions perform better than most of the games in DBD, even when I look for invasions outside EU.

I'm going to do this every time I buy something on steam, laugh at myself for being such an idiot, and thank you :3

I only use NOED when its painfully obvious they are a SWF. You get a insane advantage? Whats wrong with me getting one too?

damn sorry

I main quentin cause I like his clothes :v
---
Haunted grounds has entered the chat 
---
That's interesting. I like it.
---
Could never really see Disney (since they acquired Fox) letting the devs use it or even if the devs could afford it lol
---
Probably because on his screen, you had already teleported halfway across the map lol
---
That, or Billy's chainsaw occasionally bugs out on pallets and breaks them instead of hitting survivors. 
---
Sadly this is probably true.
---
Brass of Steel.
---
Wild selection, but understandable.
---
Not a pretty good job at all...
---
That's how King Crimson works 
---
It was in a few months ago so "finally" is the wrong word especially with how long BBQ has been away
---
You only get one perk per bloodweb until 25, except for milestone levels (5, 10, 15, 20)
---
well, then adapt? 
---
Trapper, wraith and pig are the only true killers with counters to this building. Nurse can be avoided here all together with some smart plays and if they successfully rotate on you it’s on the survivor not paying enough attention. Not to mention trappers and hags could not think to trap upstairs and in hags case you can still get out without being downed. Same goes for wraith and pig but it’s likely they will catch up to you rather quickly once they’ve hit you the first time. 
---
Yes just as I opened the chest, it probably gave off a noise if it slammed shut but the huntress was camping the hatch it turns out! She didnt leave it so I just went and did 2 gens and left! 
---
NoEds tO sTrONg
---
Do you mean perk slots, or perks to choose form in the bloodweb itself? Because after level 10, it always gave me two, and whichever one I didn't chose would be taken away. When did this change occur?
---
They don’t fuck around. 10K a pallet. 
---
Honestly, I need to find killers like this. I’m not good enough to do this to anyone above rank 10.
---
While it would be *interesting,* it would fundamentally go against the crux of the game.
---
In the bloodweb. I am not sure when the change happened, but it’s been that way for the past couple of months at least
---
*Notices your deepwound*
---
Shirtless Kate??? 
---
For real? I could've sworn just a few weeks ago it wasn't. I took a break through December until mid-January because of a breakup, but I definitely remember it not being like that until I prestiged Nurse.
---
They don't know if the person is a he or a she (huntress is a she, but they are talking about the player), so using they is the correct term. 
---
I CANT
---
I have been prestiging characters since the last double bloodpoint event and it’s been that way. 
---
Op is obviously including the entity. /s
---
Huh. Must be a bug that just now caught up to me. It definitely hasn't been that way for me. But I do hate the change regardless.
---
Sorry new to the game here can someone explain this to me lol
---
Holy shit!my we would be closed down! It’s to the point where you would think we manufactured pallets LOL, I work with appliances. 
---
Salty survivor sees perks and messages killer “too EZ”
---
* Content must be directly focused on Dead by Daylight; referring to the game in the title is not sufficient.
---
Got my first ever 4K with no gens done with her a couple of days ago in red ranks. There’s a learning curve but she’s amazing. 
---
I don't get why people keep complaining about legion. Their power is easy to avoid, it's slower than SB or anything like that, and doesn't last long. It takes multiple hits to down someone and they get stunned after the 2nd hit.
---
Billy is faster than anything and downs in one hit.
---
Looks to me like a meme build or something asked for by twitch viewers or something lol
---
That's a god tier build if I've ever seen one. 
---
Typically, once you've hooked someone and still exist on the map, that's considered camping. 
---
For real though, if you're not staying near the hook, you're not camping. It seems like they think you're always near because Territorial gives you an early warning. 
---
Easier spotting thanks to the highlight.
---
malaphor?
---
Ugh
---
Oh ok thx now i can use this build more "chilled"
---
Honestly if im on my way to somewhere else and i see no one and you get unhooked im coming back. Maybe wait for more than 10 seconds after I go to do that when im super far away. People pull me down too right in front of killers. 
---
CURRENTLY RANK 3 ON PC I JUST THINK I HAVE THE RIGHT PERKS TO PLAY HER WHAT PERKS AND ADD ONS DO YOU USE?
---
Yea after wasting another minute of valuable time if they don’t have enduring lol
---
Lol, even the devs had said that juggling's a legit strat. It's valid counterplay, my dude, even if it's irritating.
---
Not that I run decisive strike frequently, but when I do, I love it when someone else ends up obsession. Always means I can surprise with the ds instead of running the risk of being juggled. 
---
"Being immersed", so you agree there's absolutely no counterplay for, you know, actually being in a chase, which is a huge part of the game? Not to mention that the Nurse can literally teleport right on top of someone, even if they're hidden.
---
Definitely memeing
---
and btw, he is very bad against good survivors
---
I want you to whatch monto on youtube play the spirit then tell me spirits bad
---
JUST LOGGED IN TODAY TO FIND ALL MY PROGRESS FROM YESTERDAY WASNT ACCOUNTED FOR. ALL MY DAILIES I DID YESTERDAY WERE STILL THERE AND I HAD NO BLOODPOINTS EVEN THO I LOGGED OUT WITH 250K
---
People already don't like SWF. This would probably just make that hatred worse lol
---
Admins need to do their job and stop letting player shaming happen
---
Honestly hardly matters even with 4 of them. There’s a hefty amount of hooks in each map so spreading them out doesn’t do a ton. 
---
HI HOW ARE YOU GUYS 
---
His eyes are so...unsettling when they don't light up or glow.
---
And Spirit with the fast movement speed. And yes, people seem to overestimate the perk due to points, which are nice, but have no in game value.
---
No point, devs keep changing them.
---
Yea, they do 
---
Don’t want to get juggled? Don’t run DS. You can’t expect the killer to just let you go for free.
---
How I feel when I hear children singing 
---
Combine it with the game/Lery’s offering and the tape it’s really good. Takes survivors by surprise 
---
Daddy David is my lord and saviour but I always respect a good t-pose
---
&gt;The absolute worst killer main in dbd can down the absolute best survivor main in the exact same time as the best killer main can down a survivor who doesn’t know how to look backwards as legion.
---
Sorry man but that's one glaring hyperbole.
---
Because legion is unfun
---
Until you get hit with swf and you’re an m1 killer. Hate noed all you want it’s 9/10 the most efficient perk hands down
---
People must love you 
---
Of course but the Predator still falls under Disney and could never see them letting the DBD devs using the character.
---
 
---
Trapper - Daddy Trappy
---
Wraith - Bing Bong

---
I'M ABOUT TO BREAK!!!!!
---
I think that was me. If it was on xbox then I had the exact thing happen and I was the huntress
---
I prefer pharmacy to self care tbh. 
---
Yet the wraith can have the same addon with no downside lol
---
ye, i like him in the movie
---
There's already tons of them. Team work. Doing gens. Rotating hooks. Borrowed Time. Make Your Choice. BBQ and Chili. Devour Hope. Chaser Emblem Penalty.
---
It sucks to get camped, and it's incredibly ineffective against good Survivors, but it's still a valid strategy. It's not against any actual rules, BHVR's not going to do anything more than they have.
---
Psycho killers? Qu'est-ce que c'est
---
I call Hillbilly, Billhilly. 
---
He probably means hook sabo.
---
Well. Predator doesnt make alot of money in movies. People still like him though. They said they'd leave it all alone under its own umbrella. They will really hurt the franchise if they dont let licenses out. 
---
&gt; For now, the ones I feel that give me the best results are the Huntress, Billy, Leatherface and the Spirit 
---
But I know how to use all of them except Legion (didn't buy it yet) and Freddy. For the most part I'm playing Huntress and Billy nowadays, and I'm pretty decent with both of them. I feel playing any other killer is just masochism.
---
Reports only warrant investigation mate, theres no harm reporting on suspicion.
---
Lol ur deadass lying. Killers on this subreddit are fine with dodging flashlight teams/ toolbox teams etc
---
ITS NOT CAUSE SHES TOXIC OR ANYTHING SHES SHORT AND KINDA HARD TO SEE MY EYESIGHT ISNT THE BEST BUT I STILL ENJOY THE GAME GREATLY NO OFFENSE TO YOUR CHARACTER OF CHOICE ALSO I WOULD SAY JUST IGNORE THE TOXICITY OF SOME PEOPLE
---
Dodging the lobby. Not going in and DCing there's a huge fucking difference 
---
Have fun against a Bubba
---
Nothing comes of reporting innocent people, stop overreacting. A steam investigation starts which is breif IF more reports come through, how many fucking survivors report killers for "tunneling and camping" and then how many of them get banned?
---
Yeah, there we go.
---
Sloppy butcher is great to slow down the game. I’d use that over spirit fury. Spirit fury is pretty much a wasted slot if not running enduring. I’ve also fallen in love with surveillance lately. That with overcharge and ruin is pretty solid, especially if you’re a 3 gen killer. 
---
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Hehe, now we know your tricks. Silly survivor mains
---
not a single mention of legion? this isn't the r/deadbydaylight that i know!
---
I TAKE BACK WHAT I ORIGINALLY SAID ACTUALLY BECAUSE I JUST PLAYED A GAME AS KILLER AND HAD A CLAUDETTE FUCKING FLASHLIGHT STUN AND TBAG AT ME THE WHOLE GAME AND THEN HOLD UP THE END OF THE GAME FOR 5 MINUTES BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T FUCKING LEAVE AND THEN MOCK ME AT THE END OF THE GAME IN CHAT. THIS IS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND I UNDERSTAND NOW WHY PEOPLE HATE THEM. NO WONDER WHY NO ONE PLAYS KILLER THIS SHIT FEELS TERRIBLE.
---
I was going to do that and probably will since his TR is small
---
Please make this Michael’s terror radius
---
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-far better

Run run run run run run run away

Is the map that new resort get show is about?
---
Real good for legion
---
*goes afk infront of lamp to show it's there*

People have been doing this since the maps release, I thought more people knew about it.

Imagine how big of a cunt you could be as this guy lol. Just run DS, Laughing Stock, Last Laugh, and a sprint perk and you can just piss any killer off. They cant even facecamp you for it because it'll take you 5 minutes to die on the hook before giving everyone else a massive buff
---
I mean play whoever you want. You paid for the game. :) If legion is who you wanna play, go for it. 
---
I know. It's quite stressful. Here's hoping that you won't be hit hard.
---
That joystick excuse is just that, an excuse. You can play most killers at 99% efficiency using a joystick as long as you actually learn the game, ie learning how to counter 360s. Stop lunging for starters. And if they try to spin around you, just back pedal and do a swing.
---
As for Legion, he is boring. But you do you. 
---
Quote from the wiki: "The smaller Bloodwebs generated at Levels 1 through 25 will generally spawn one Perk, the larger Bloodwebs generated at Levels 15 and 20 and from Level 25 onwards will spawn two Perks, but one of them will be taken by The Entity, so choose wisely. The very smallest Bloodwebs from Levels 1 through 4 have a chance of spawning no Perk."
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodweb
---
Judging by the page history, this must have been the case for a long time (that part was last edited in April 2018 and it still said 2 perks starting at 25). I have only recently started playing the game, so I don't know if they changed things in between though.
---
As for getting the good perks, it took me 55 webs to finally get tier 1 BBQ on Myers and then recently I start levelling Hilbilly and have it at tier 2 at level 20. :D
---
why cant you play with a keyboard?
---
But, sure do that.
---
I started to Main him as well and rushed to R1 while farming the Event, with constant Double pips 
---
Understand that ranking up comes from Emblems rather than kills, as does the pleasure of the entity. Stupidly enough, I found the entity is more pleased if I hook all survivors once and they escape, than if 2 survivors die and the other 2 don't get hooked. You can abuse it by essentially aiming to complete each emblem. Some characters excel at completing a certain type, like wraith can fill Deviousness quickly. 
---
If you really desperately absolutely want kills, then go all out toxic builds with NOED and Devour Hope and stuff. 
---
As for Enduring, it pairs super duper well with Spirit Fury, but works the best on killers that get looped, which out of the few you play is really only LF. 
---
The title of this post is an imitation of the titles I see of said posts though no one that responded got that
---
This happened to me tonight . Only once so far .
---
Dead hard buff be like
---
I keep finding firecrackers since the event started, so I had to switch up my perks.
---
Why everyone hates the legion? Is not that hard to win agains it
---
Same, I just tell myself I'm the preuel of the movie, where everyone escapes from the killer. 
---
Tbh, I run Franklins for the survivors that teabag at gates and don’t leave. It feels good to take the purple flashlight of a bm’ing survivor
---
I could go with only one best boy/ girl and Daddy Myers just happened to win out over our favorite spooky gang. I'm sorry :(
---
I can’t use a keyboard because I have a wireless one with a track pad and can’t dump money on a legitimate wireless mouse that isn’t trash, and don’t have a typical desktop setup. It’s an Alienware steak machine with windows on it instead of the knock off linux steam OS. It’s setup like a console though and lives in an entertainment center since I don’t have a legit desk. To get a real set up it would cost more money then I have at the moment. Priorities suck. I have the legion dlc already though, and can only choose between terrible keyboard with a laptop mouse pad, not a mouse; which, you can barely play WoW with how responsive those things are. Or I can use the steam controller which is an over glorified Xbox controller with a mouse pad instead of a right joystick. 
---
That’s just David’s new Black-Out Drunk perk.
---
just keep trying.
---
I used to be able to get to ~5 and got stuck there, but after getting more perks( Nurses,BBQ, ruin) I rushed from rank 10 to 1 in under 2 days with almost constant 2pip Games on Legion
---
It's not very bad. It's conducive towards sabo builds obviously, my friends bring them against me sometimes in KYF. But unless you're on The Game with awful hook placements or a sabo team it won't really matter.
---
ay, Sekhmet? :)
---
what about kyf?
---
damn that sucks :( hope you find a good keyboard/Mouse Combo sometime.
---
But Legion might be a good choice despite all the hate, and at least in my opinion its a really, fun Killer, if you got the right perks 
---
I don’t mean to be a grammar nazi, but haikus are 5 syllables by 7 syllables by 5 syllables, so half of the poems aren’t quite haiku’s. 
---
if your still there why not spam sleep till you find her? ^^^or ^^^dc
---
Yea they did that to me when I got Billy’s 
---
If you can record video (long one) you can report (postgame is must) and write the support. They will ask for video.
---
Bilf ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Legion buff
---
You are all but mere children. Only men recognize shirtless bubba as the one true king 
---
ye, maybe around 40-50 minutes and every Survivor who stays longer should be "dead by daylight"
---
Eh, probably the closest thing to a sweaty adapt in terms of perks are Leatherface via tracking and slugging or Trapp (since none of his perks are bad)
---
Julie couldn’t take Frank’s sloppy butcher in their Iron Maiden at 3 am
---
Wait that’s not how you post gifs oof
---
Legion main here in rank 2. Here on Xbox, survivors have the guts to play against me. 
---
Probably hitting rank 1 for the first time ever tomorrow. 
---
*BBQ,M&amp;A,disc,franklins. Green addons*
---
I’ve been waiting for monitor and abuse to be in the shrine for like 2 months &gt;:(
---
Why would you want only 3 survivors in lobby?
---
I’ve had teammates thrown em at me while i’m on a hook and then run off
---
Thank you for the awareness. 🙏🏻 my brothers and sisters are dying left and right and I don’t know how long we can last in these conditions anymore. 
---
I know I'm trash. This gives me hope in the survivor community to be more accepting and understanding of those killers that still have As and Bs in Development Potential... What the fuck am I saying? We all know this is just a small drop compared to the toxicity at large.
---

*Hag rolls 2 d20*
---
Her teleport is successful, she slaps you; roll to defend.
---
Kill your friends? That's basically i lobby and i have to invite people. You can't play 1v1. 
---
Noţ this overpowered perk of doom. Are you trying to make legion even more broken?
---
Its not that. He's just not fun.
---
I wish they add more varities of item. Might be more exciting (not talking about a gun of course) but the devs already do their best at making this game fun already.
---
DBD, behavior, next event just do the 2v8 game mode. Almost everybody would love it, and if it turns out to be terrible then you don’t need to keep hearing it from ass holes like me, or just go back to the old events with just doing gens and getting hooks with a blood point bonus. 
---
I smell the powerful scent of Dc.
---
Right!?
---
All the people I go against heal right at the escape threshold.
---
Lol i love when they kick its ass after realizing what it is.
---
Yeah, that's what I hate about cocky yet smart players 
---
Maybe the people making it not fun to play are the people who DC and not the rank 15 legion
---
What does that have to do with this? Seems completely unrelated. 
---
Cunt deserved it for those rapid fire bags. 
---
People really call anything edgy
---
Gender bent killers/survivors 
---
Personally, I want a Rob Zombie Meyers set up while he was still in the mental asylum; that weird orange mask he had on with the long hair and asylum attire. Imagine sitting at Crotus Penn and looking up to one of the drop offs while you’re on a generator and seeing that horrifying shit staring down at you. 
---
Or for Freddy a Robert Englund cosmetic, even the one from Freddy VS Jason. I’m sure Englund wouldn’t mind coming in to do that iconic Freddy laugh and do some mo-cap for a new stance and how the power stance looks and a new sound for pallet stubs (“You’re mine, bitch!”)
---
Or for Pig just a regular Amanda without the Trench Coat and Pig Head and just have her looking like her cracked out self from Saw 2, or her slightly cleaned up look from Saw 3/4(?) when she was Jigsaw’s apprentice outright. 
---
DEAD HARD IV
---
Jake then immediately proceeds to run towards me to fix my injured ass and I'm suddenly filled with more terror than facing a nurse with Mori. 
---
Lmao, threatening me for mori-ing him isn't edgy? 
---
It’s not jakes fault. He just like to heal using only a toolbox
---
I can’t wrap my mind around that mindset. I wish I got some inexperienced killers every now and then. I love surviving and it’s fucking rare so when I do get a killer that I actually have a shot at escaping from, I don’t want to do anything but send them love and gg’s afterwards. 
---
"Threatening" Literally all he said is he's returning the favor
---
Same, man.  I switched it until event is over.  I've had to do that through 2 events. The chance for a stupid firework trumps items.  Though I did get a red key without plunderers once and scored a hatch escape. 
---
Did he ever respond back?
---
Perk - 'RPG-7'
---
You can find an RPG-7 in the last chest on the map. Allows you to injure/down/FUCKING MURDER the killer once per match
---
"Eat this!" - Bill Overbeck
---
Tyde gives me major douche chills
---
I’m starting to try even weirder addons like Fuming Mixtape and so far it causes hilarious map pressure cause people want to solo gens and I just see all. 
---
Well that was fucking obnoxious.
---
I don't hate it at all. I used it a lot early on. 
---
Freddy: 
---
Burned Fedora (Iridescent): Survivors within your terror radius will slowly fall asleep over 10 seconds or instantly when using M2 inside of your terror radius. Survivor auras are no longer visible outside of your terror radius.
---
Prototype Glove (Iridescent): The Entity has blessed you with an infinite dream to master. You are no longer confined to the dream world; survivors put into the dream world will enter another plane of being, leaving their bodies stationary and unable to be harmed but unable to perform any actions that effect the real world; survivors must be woken up by another survivor, if a survivor is asleep and the last survivor standing, they can no longer be put to sleep
---
I'm sure a million people are going to try to convince you otherwise but I think you have some legit reasons there. I understand the appeal. Plus, I used to be a delinquent teen with a group (that we named) and we had something like a mischief list. So, Legion is like...if we turned to the dark side. I even made mixtapes! It feels like a Twilight Zone version of my past.
---
I don't main Legion but I will non-seriously play Legion to let off steam at times. Sprinting around and vaulting, as a killer, is satisfying. And I try to make the game as fun as possible for survivors (taking all the complaints into consideration).
---
Same. Did all 5 gens and escaped with a lantern. Got 8 points total...
---
I HATE LEATHER FACE. DOESN'T TAKE MUCH SKILL TO JUST RIGHT CLICK AND HAVE ALL OF YOUR WORRIES GO AWAY.
---
I don't think that would work because I had a game legitimately go nearly 50 minutes the other day. Can't you just go find her? She has to be somewhere. 
---
yeah we went on this meme back and forth where he sent kys memes and i sent him pictures of kermit the frog hanging himself, it was fun.
---
I dunno what they did but the hitboxes are so fucked right now, facing a billy is just horrible, mother fucker can hit you from across the map with his mallet.
---
Because i'm not a fan of giving survivors a free 1k points per pallet?
---
God this is so satisfying. I hate those survivors who have to be jerks and teabag at the exit gate like that. 
---
Keep up the good work! 
---
Shirtless Freddy? I think you meant shirtless swole trapper 
---
Just like MW2 multiplayer, lol
---
There’s two killers that do that out of the entire roster. 
---
The herd of wild megs combine to form megatron
---
That looks like a Boomer from the stomach down in the background in my opinion but i might need glasses
---
also hexes are sorta bad
---
r/dbdgonewild/
---
crows 
---
That music...dude why??
---
It's mostly because of gen speed. Pallets/windows buy too much time and gens are too fast.
---
Brutal combination 
---
The thing is, all you have to do to win against a medium to allow skill Jumpscare Myers is just to loop him or just get him on you since he can’t chase worth shit, so don’t even try hiding and be SUPER careful around corners. If it’s a high skill Myers though... good luck lol
---
I'd laugh. That's some dedication to fucking you over.
---
"you are in range". What does that even mean? This is a team game. Someone must have helped you in some way at some point. It's your turn to atleast try.
---
I just imagin chucky carrying someone to a hook, only to get booted to a different dimension by david
---
The only time I ever DC is when I come up against an obvious cheater or I'm being hook farmed by teammates and the killer keeps re-hooking me.  Otherwise just play the game. 
---
Reminds me of the option in Friday the 13th to try and kill Jason. Very difficult, but unbelievably satisfying.
---
One really interesting way to do that would be if each killer had some kind of weakness the survivors could exploit to put them down, rather than just having them bum rush the killer.
---
Except it doesn't just spread them a further distance. If you watched the dev stream, making them further apart could cancel out other hooks. So it could also remove some of the hooks on the map as well as increase their distance.
---
Thanks for the feedback, this is one of my poorest videos as I rushed it but still wanted to upload something. As for the self-promotion thing I was not aware of that rule. thanks for commenting.
---
Come on bill, your rpg vs my hatchet, draw
---
That's got to be the best nurse I've ever seen!
---
OH MY GOD I USED TO DO THE SAME FUCKING THING
---
I WOULD BE ON MY COUCH GOING "NOOOOO I'M SORRY I DON'T MEAN IT" AND MY SURVIVOR MAIN ROOMMATE WOULD BE LAUGHING AT ME
---
What a great person, letting you get all those extra struggle points /s
---
Oof
---
[an attempt was made ](https://imgur.com/gallery/zVCcGu9)  I tried.
---
Yeah, because it should be a fucking crime to play him.
---
Actually considering getting Legion for my “Fun Police” live-streams. 
---
Thanks for commenting, I am aware this video is really bad as I rushed to get it uploaded. im currently working to get many uploads completed but i guess i should go for quality over quantity. cheers for the feedback.
---
No karma for juggling, if anything it’s karma for running DS. If you’re the obsession you’re getting juggled 100% if the situation allows it. 
---
I tried. [an attempt was made](https://imgur.com/gallery/zVCcGu9) 
---
wraith too op pls patch the lag 
---
I love this meme lol
---
Damn if that Nurse had Spirit Fury or Enduring instead of Shadowborn, It would be the ultimate perk setup!
---
I mean you can....
---
Legion recovers so fast you can't 360 that much. 
---
Did you do it?
---
I mean you can check our friends list we have never friended each other nor have we ever played together before this. Just a good group of people 
---
Hex: Monto
---
I’m dead I can’t breathe 
---
So instead of I dunno watching a horror movie and chilling with her your going to play DBD? Doesn’t exactly sound like a good idea, but hey I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Can I subscribe to this artist?
---
I like it. Who needs the Iridescent Head?
---
Again. OP loops killer for ages and still makes a post. 
---
I don't get people who heal themselves far from the actual exit. You already ran this far, get a bit closer to the end just in case. 
---

---
Oh, it's not Pandora's fault at all. The gods were absolute jerks.
---
 I mean, the reason Prometheus ends up being tortured for eternity is because he dared to try and take care of humanity, and because the gods couldn't undo the good he'd done for humanity as a whole they tricked his brother into marrying Pandora so she could unleash all the evils within the jar upon humanity.
---
I have two accounts: red ranks and rank 15.  Rank 15 is worse BY FAR.
---
I'd rather have a perk that "saves" progress on a totem cleanse.
---
Anyone have the link to the comic about d-strike when Bill brings like an AK?
---
This is well thought out and written nicely. Thank you.

Bad idea 
---
That was a rank 1 game

&gt;It sucks to get camped, and it's incredibly ineffective against good Survivors, but it's still a valid strategy. It's not against any actual rules, BHVR's not going to do anything more than they have.
---
I'm sure the OP and many others get that, it's not something we haven't heard a billion times but that doesn't make it any less crappy and unfun to be camped.
---
Predator, surveillance, noed, nurses calling is my typical setup and it works really well. 
---
&gt;priorities suck.
---
Buys legion xD
---
Jokes aside. Play who you want.
---
So survivors get nicer as I go up in rank lol. Currently rank 9 and God they're assholes I had to turn off my messages on console 
---
On the PS4 Pro there’s actually no frame rates problems, my brother got it and the game is smooth, but on the fat one, you’ll run great
---
I mean at that range Bill would also get caught up in the blast....and then get back up because Unbreakable! :D
---
I was waiting for the DC
---
I love how this is both a joke and completely real at the same time
---
WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?
---
HOW IS NOED EASY MODE? IT ONLY ACTIVATES AT THE END OF THE MATCH AND PUNISHES COCKY SURVIVORS. + ITS COUNTERED BY CLEANSING TOTEMS. ITS LEGIT A BETTER HEX RUIN BY MAKING SURIVIORS WASTE TIME CLEARING TOTEMS AND PUNISHES THEM IF THEY DONT
---
Hex: ruin no more leveling up hag
---
I did make this as a joke, nothing here is actually what I want as a buff for bubba, but it would be nice to see him buffed. 
---
How dare the killer use their power. They're only allowed to M1. ^(/s)
---
ILY, yes!
---
While this was funny to watch, I don't know if it was the reddit video process or what but the fps of this clip made it kinda hard to watch. If that is the actual FPS of the PS4 version atm, then all I can say is my condolences. That shiz needs to be fixed a.s.a.p.
---
Yeah because it’d be much more fun chasing survivors in a straight line instead 
---
There is no way to fix it. It depends on the how nice killer is. Also don't make made-up rules. Killers aren't supposed to spare survivors anyway. 
---
Sounds way more fun than an actual legion match though
---
Both sides are salty tbh. It seems like the survivor side are more salty because the survivor population is much bigger than the killer one. I HATE dying by noed, so I tend to do all the totems. 
---
Hitboxes are great. :)))))
---
I got a similar web but instead the green wrench’s or whatever they are called.
---
Pro players want to play on hard mode to show their talent. Why the fuck would they play on easy mode.

IF THEY WOULD WANT TO PLAY ON HARD MODE THERES A PERK MADE FOR THAT, AGAIN, THE LEVEL OF YOUR VOICE MATCHES THE THOUGHT YOU HAD BETWEEN YOUR ARGUMENTS
---
2000
---
A lot of people like Stridor and Predator.
---
Good job! :D 
---
she ran to the gate and waited at the gate to open the exit instead of unhooking me...
---
Crashes happen on pc too.
---
THE FUCKING INSTA-DCS ON PS4. LIKE SERIOUSLY?!?! DC VS A MYERS?!?! JUST BECAUSE HE HIT TIER TWO?!?! GROW A FUCKIN PAIR AND PLAY OUT THE MATCH OR JUST DONT PLAY AT ALL IF YOURE JUST GONNA DC EVERYTIME THE KILLERS ANYTHING BUT FREDDY. 
---
reference from YOU ? 
---
it's like that
---
Red ranks.
---
I agree with sprint burst being a crutch but I have no idea how you think borrowed time is a crutch.
---
You should have picked decisive strike instead
---
yea i didnt feel right posting his profile but i left the username, my bad if thats too far. but he added me and tried defending his use over the word.
---
Sounds like a player issue not a killer issue
---
The deleted comment said red rank, i deleted to add the baby girl since its obvious that you are in fact... A baby girl
---
drastically more annoying which makes me DC against her every time
---
Oh but you did say red then? So are you red? Or purple? Or green? Do you even play the game? You must be pretty busy with your important job that requires sitting on reddit all the day and not having basic comprehension or spelling. 
---
Seems like it somehow spent my Auric Cells instead of the coins I didn't have. That wasn't my intention, but at least it's not an exploit, I guess.
---
I'd prefer to not have spent the cells, though - if anyone at BHVR can get back to me, that'd be great. 
---
i hope you enjoy 4 disconnects every game
---
Bit creepy like a paedophile. Which you probably are to be fair, it is hereditary after all.
---
Welcome to DC town
---
Lmfao ive spelled everything correctly. Im leaning towards you are a true autist. I sit and play dbd at my job, perks of going to college and getting an actual career...you should try it sometime.
---
When I've seen that you need 100 points for a coin I thought that finally we have a good event. 900 points for 9 coins is managable even for someone who can only afford the time to play for one or two hours a day. But then I've seen that you need twice as much for the second coin and so on and I was like wtf?
---
I love and enjoy the game, but the fact that you need 600 points for the first part of the dress, but 1500 (!) for the second and 2400 (!!) for the third is very disappointing.
---
Let's assume that during an average game you repair three gens with your team before you die. That's 12 points. To get 1500, you need to play around 120 games. Not to talk about the third section where you will need around 200 games. In total, about 4-500 games are needed during a ten-something day period if you cannot escape frequently with a vessel.
---
rank 7 isn't for you then. don't complain about the game not being fun when you're at a rank that's too high for you.
---
Big oof. I thought for a second she was gonna come up to yoy and teabag.
---
Even though I used a very toxic build, they were very kind. They were of the first to get moried and got the least points too. By the end game, 0 gen was done. Whoever you are, thank you strangers.
---
ohtofu is an asshole and he's fuck ugly.
---
Lol pedophile jokes...how original. Take your autistic ass back to final fantasy or whatever garbage you played before. Its obvious that you are too fat around the heart to play this game...which is sad because its just a game
---
Haven't worked hard enough to get there since one of the first seasons. RIP my skill
---
Sure, Jay. Bet you went to college right after you took the pedalo to Africa, didn't you?
---
You're the one trying to nonce up an underage girl. Just calling it how I see it.
---
Can i just ask...how did you manage to get 3 auric cells?
---
The console community is slowly going to die if optimization doesn't drop relatively soon. Killer just feels awful so no one plays it. Doesn't help that they give killers like half the event points that survivors get for much more effort
---
I just got 1K today and i was so proud. Congratz on the 800!!!

And you realise you're the only one upset here right? You're the only one in fact in this entire comment section who started whining and crying like this. You've admitted you created an account (a year ago) just to troll. I'd think you were pathetic if I didn't genuinely feel kinda bad for you. 
---
Why do you keep posting the same posts?
---
Yeah, I must've just had some sort of bug and didn't know any better.  
---
But yeah, the bloodweb can be really screwed up sometimes. Maybe get BBQ tier 1 at level 5, and go to essentially level 70 before you get the second tier. Sometimes it is a bit nicer and more helpful, but sometimes it is just ridiculously random.
---
It removes all skill and options to the point where it's not really a game anymore, but instead some shitty edgy horror movie starring a Canadian school ~~shooter~~ shanked.
---
No
---
Just sjw dbd community
---
Why is your name cupcakepie
---
He was cocky he was teabagging and he left the exit gate against a killer with NOED also the op never said they were good 
---
Meg is the best survivor, are you braindead?
---
Laurie Strode lowkey looking like Andy Samberg playing Laurie Strode
---
Really I play on the pro and i get frame rate issues not as much as my old ps4 but still enough to be noticable.
---
I mean, it looks good and plays smoothly. You just need to grind *a lot* before you can actually be an effective survivor.
---
Dude nonce isnt even a fucking word lmfaoo...seriously...if someone ever decides to breed with you, please do the world a favor and abort
---
Then they should fix the matchmaking so that lower play time players are matched with each other and higher play time players are matched with each other.
---
This is just telling new players to bugger off because they annoy you. This can be the case but you have to realize that you were probably at this point yourself when you just started playing.
---
No chance of you ever breeding. Unless you're after more underage girls. Nonce.
---
I don't care what build you use, but it does get tiring dealing with ruin every game.  Also please stop slugging for the 4k and just let the last person go.  It's so gross.
---
That's not a good idea, though. I have 3000 hours and I don't want to wait an hour for a game that has shitty connection. Also, I enjoy playing at low ranks because high rank killers are tryhards, and like many other people with lots of hours, it's the only thing we can do to have fun anymore.
---
No, when I started playing it took me a long time to rank up.
---
Feels proud to brag about using insta heals on top of other second chance shit and then actually feels accomplished of this fact and feels the need to post to reddit?  I'm not even knocking you for using that stuff in game but actually being proud of that and feeling the need to post it is cringe as shit man.  Hey guys I bowled a 300 today!  I mean the bumpers were up but 300 baby!
---
As someone who took the time to learn nurse, people are usually very encouraging when you're in your "baby nurse" phase.
---
Then others will tell you how easy you are, those are the people who disconnect once you get good at nurse =)
---
Nurse is the easiest killer to juke, kudos for playing her.
---
That's an interesting perspective. I'm curious if you believe the theory that he/she was originally going to have the ability to "camo" as a survivor but they changed it, hence why this ability isn't thought through.
---
[DAMN BOI SHE THICC BOI](https://youtu.be/arnWU1sWqKw) 
---
Hello Zepp would be so epic! I'd love to see a remix for it in the same vein they did for The Shape Stalks
---
Nice gen!
---
Ignore them... The community is really toxic but sometimes you get nice ppl. Most of the killers will just camp with Leatherface. Me personally I get FACEcamped so often. I'm trying to be super nice to ppl that are trying to have fun and also make a fun game for others.
---
It's not about survivors or killers... Both sides are toxic af, just ignore them and have fun. I'm really happy to thanks killers that play Leatherface that doesn't camp.
---
Good hunting in the fog.
---
It was a joke.
---
Well, When I think that BHVR can't surprise me with a new bug, they prove me wrong. They are so good at it.
---
But yeah, this really sucks, you can try to contact the support, maybe they can help you.
---
Lol my bad but honestly noed on any killer that doesn't rhyme with Freddy is pathetic.  It's a babydick crutch used by killers first learning the game not red ranks.  It's no different than decisive strike and I wouldn't be caught dead running it on any of my killers.  
---
That's a Trapper btw not Billy.
---
Also I expect noed from a trapper, it's a little bit like freddy and wraith.
---
OhTofu does this for a while now. Every single time he does that: "I aM sO ToXiC HoW cOmES tHeRe Is NO rEdDiT tHrEaD aBoUt mE?!" Guess he got what he wanted by basically forcing it lol
---
Ora ora 
---
&gt;be me

&gt;play wraith

&gt;use annoying ass bone club thing that makes your bing bong annoying

&gt;be in endgame with noed

&gt;2 people at the exitgate waiting to teabag
---

---
&gt;I bing bong around for 20 seconds
---
&gt;Im standing next to the gate
---
&gt;Now or never
---
&gt;I rush out and get a kate ro drop dead
---
I dont even use 4chan, why did I do this
---
Thanataphobia, in my experience, is okay. Pair it with Sloppy Butcher and Dying Light for the ultimate slow-game build. It's also good on Legion, since you can constantly inflict hits. As for now though, I would save your shards. After all, you can just earn BP and pump it into Nurse without having to actually play her. Just get her to a high enough level and get the teachable unlocked. 
---
It's a pathetic safety net and no different than decisive strike for survivors.  I main both Trapper and Wraith at rank 1 and wouldn't be caught dead running that micropenis crutch.  It rewards failure and masks poor play.  Got to cut the cord if you want to improve your killer play.  I agree they used to need this a long time ago but once the pallet vacuum was removed and the window spawns reworked chases got infinitely easier for competetent killers.  The days of the overpowered survivors are long gone.
---
It's very "BHVR" that the window vault momentum change that was supposed to make those ridiculous post-vault hits less common, makes them even more so.
---
MUDA! MUDA! MUDA! MUDA!
---
"Bill, how long have you had that"
---
"Yes"
---
He also uses Agitation and Brutal Strength. Which suggests (to anyone with half a brain) the player doesn't have many good perks to chose from.  Even playing without addons. 
---
No addon trapper with shit perks running noed. That is like No Mither guy running DS. Yet we still have people chained to the glorious scrub mentality complaining.
---
I’ve seen him stream sabo squad multiple times. I don’t think they mean to play it in a toxic way, just as a means to play differently than usual. Instead of just rushing gens and looping killers they sabo hooks and stuff. The trade off is they waste a ton of time saboing and if you have to face camp them it’s within your right. It’s just one game I wouldn’t take it personal.
---
It's slightly less frequent once you reach the higher ranks, but it still happens more often than it should. 
---
Wish there were harsher penalties for quitting, takes the fun out of the match and screws over the other survivors, especially if you DC early after the match starts.
---
I made it to Rank 4. But this game was unfair, huntress was working with survivor to get me killed at the very end of the game. I was hiding to get the hatch for the win but it turned out to be the longest game of my life! The other guy was let go after being downed so many times and healed . The Killers excuse was that I “Had a Lantern” and that’s why he killed me. My Goal was to get to rank 4 by the end of this season but left unsatisfied because of this.
---
This guy is wrong. When I say GG, It usually means I had fun or I was happy with how you played even if you won or lost. I say GG to people who deserve it and never to 'taunt' or 'rub it in the killers face'.
---
Honestly, BHVR is probably the most OP Killer in the game
---
Shoulda put smol billy I see.
---
Tunneling as legion is like tunneling as freddy, it would seem like a good option but switching targets in your frenzy is really important for keeping other survivors off gens. And never heal/self care against a legion!
---
"FUCKING MURDER"
---
The only image going through my head is the clown rounding a corner, Bill shouting,"Bloat! Watch out!" and just obliterating him.
---
They don’t balance the game because every time they touch something it breaks. 
---
Jeff in the back is more scary looking than any of the killers.
---
Either way, Bill wins.
---
You get blown the fuck up, or he catches that hatchet and Chase's you with it.
---
I swear Meg looks like Pippi from Osu!
---
Your first comment either wasn't or joke or was nothing even close to being a joke,nothing to woooosh there. 
---
Negative, they only provide you with extra bp and an additional lantern. 
---
There’s really no point in being rude to someone just because they aren’t the best player to ever exist. Not saying people can’t be assholes at times but that’s a different circumstance 
---
Why am I laughing so hard at this, I would be pissed if it were me
---
Photoshopped
---
Shit perks he had ruin and noed...trapper can defend that shit too I trap up key loops surrounding it and on many map spawns you can even trap the totem itself.  Also many people consider brutal and agitation to be good (I don't) but I know of many people that are fans of both.  Agitation works for basement plays with trapper if nothing else and we all know how strong trappy boi is with prey in the basement that can snowball real quick with good trap placement.  I don't care how bad my run of prestige perks are I will put on a 4th trash perk before I resort to running noed.  This ain't rank 17 anynore.
---
This. But be careful bc some survivors know a lot of huntresses do this and will keep looping you, so imo make sure to mix it up, try the hatchet at the pallet and if you notice they just loop through then try just a regular hit before they can get back to it 
---
"Oh I got hooked once? Better leave and just get into another game."
---
Nah. Ban them for 30 minutes, give them a -25% to BP earning for 10 games, place a "QUITTER" hat on them for 10 games, put them in lobbies with other quitters, and to top it all of, give them a temporary rank of 1.
---
BT has counterplay but Noed is awful? Both perks work in the same way: Either you play less efficient (cleanse dull totems/always hit the unhooker instead) or play a risk/reward game of the enemy having said perk or not. Your logic of why Noed/DS is bad can also be applied to borrowed time even. Rewarding bad plays.
---
You didn't put bitching about Legion, that's the main thing I see on this subreddit
---
Wrong flair. Should be salt.
---
Gotta be honest, watching that match was funny af. You've gotta see the humor in this XD
---
well, entertainment is subjective
---
That being said I go full tryhard for 2 hooks and then the 3rd time I down someone I just pick them up and drop them a few times so they can finish the game off when it's a 3v1
---
You can't counter her phasing around a pallet, you have to guess where she is.
---
This is a solid post. Take my upvote. 
---
Honestly, sometimes all you can do is laugh about it
---
As a killer, sometimes I just like one survivor’s playstyle more than the other, so I’d rather they get hatch. It isn’t a conspiracy, the killer just didn’t like immersed survivors. 
---
Every Bond you take
---
Each Stake-out you fake
---
I'll be watching you
---
It’s Monto’s set up. Tofu has played it with monto a few times on his YouTube channel. Its just a way for them keep the game fresh instead of the same boring game play. I run that build with friends in KYF I can’t bring myself to do it in an actual public match. 
---
I play on ps4 so idk how many hours i got...i wish we had an average time it takes per devotion level, and if someone has one or could give me an estimate on my time played I am devotion 4 level 20ish. 
---
That my friend is scrub mentality at its finest. 
---
To add to this i wish even more that sony just added a thing that shows you hours per game 
---
If i were you, i would say so too :( Unreal.
---
I understand. Thx for sharing your opinion, appreciate it
---
Nea is my main so I was over the moon
---
0 blink Nurse with the spider perk (not sure of its name), since her base speed is slower than survivors.
---
Pig crouching the whole game and doing gens with survivors. She looks really similar to them when ambushed.
---
Wraith ringing the bell only (with the addon making bing bong sound go whole map) or Freddy chasing survivors without using the dream ability.
---
I get called a facecamper too when I play Cannibal. Like hello, idiots? I’m not face camping I’m insidious camping outside. Survivors are dumb and that’s what you should remember.
---
Nice job man!
---
tfuHappy
---
I don't run a survivor until they have self care &amp; we're gonna live forever. 
---
An exhaustion perk like sprint burst is always good.
---
Plunderers instinct is pretty good now with the reworked chests. 
---
For killers, other than bbq and ruin, I liked huntress lullaby, but it always gets destroyed before I get much use out of it these days, so I'm trying thanatophobia along with sloppy butcher, which I'm having a good time with. 
---
I don't know how well these work in the meta, but I reliably get about 3 kills in the red ranks so 🤷‍♂️
---
That is one way to define NOED. Another one would be: A perk meant to put survivors in a risk/reward situation. Just like Ruin survivors will be slowed down to remove dulls. If they chose to take the risk and end the game as fast as possible, they get punished for it.  
---
The only argument I agree with in regards to Noed is that it is a big FeelsBad that can make people feel unfairly punished. And since it reduces enjoyment a lot, it should be reworked. People who claim it is a crutch/op however are actually braindamaged.
---
Different killers benefit from different perks. Shadowborn is very good for Nurse, kinda good for Huntress, meh for every other killer, for example.
---
Ruin is overrated. BBQ is not S+ tier anymore with latest locker and gen auras changes.
---
So, on killer side it's more of a question of your playstyle.
---
Lmao, we’re in the same boat. But in the end, we can’t do much about it. Hopefully, it doesn’t happen to anyone else.
---
ngl that was actually 200 iq with that dc lol
---
Ok
---
Yeah, I'm not even mad. I'm more impressed than anything.
---
They arent bad, they’re inconsistent 
---
Ok, i take the "always" back. Try to bait them into putting it down.
---
Also today I traded ruin for overcharge and it's nice having 4 perks for a whole match instead of 3 with a hex that instantly gets destroyed. 
---
Yeah that seems to be the new anti-slug, not sure it's worth it though
---
For survivor: Adrenalin, iron will, dead hard, balanced landing, borrowed time
---
Depends what killer you play but these are pretty meta.
---
Killer: Bbq, Hex ruin, endurance,  spirit fury, nurses calling, the one legion perk for gens that i cant remember.
---
BS overall is a medicore perk. If there was a tierlist for perks it would be mid tier while there are lots of perks in high tier. Enduring is strictly a better anti pallet perk than BS. "But you can fo both" - If you already run Enduring **and** want a second anti pallet perk, Spirit Fury beats Brutal Strength
---
Exactly he took on 3 tanks and killed all 3 of them some skinny fuckboi with a chainsaw ain’t gonna do shit lol 
---
You ok, friend?
---
I never once stated I can't survive vs him. It's boring and unfun. 
---
Yeah, one Survivor gest zero points and looks like a quitter, while the other gets a little bit of extra points. It doesn't seem like a good tradeoff, unless they only did it to spite me (or any killer). 
---
Mortality clarified in a single strike!
---
Billy doesnt need a nerf tho.  He is fine
---
Billy doesn’t need anything done until they fix legion/nurse 
---
Remove legion * lol 
---
Yeah I know ! I don’t know why I keep playing it even when I get angry at stuff like this oh well that’s the life of a dbd player 
---
Nah, at that distance it would "just" be a ~2.6kg projectile flying at the hag with an approx speed of 120 m/s.
---
Also known as a pretty bad day, seeing as it still has the Kinetic energy of 4 20-gauge shotgun blasts hitting you at the same time.
---
There is a minimum amount of hooks per map. Because of this the offering cannot reduce the amount of hooks that can spawn leaving it purely up to rng. This was stated in the dev stream when the change initially was implemented. I suggest you go and check that out, it’s one of the few streams I don’t completely regret watching. 
---
Mains trapper at rank one
---
Incorrectly identifies a trapper as a billy while looking at a screenshot. 
---
☝🏾🤔
---
Never chase without hatchets, it's fine to reload mid chase.
---
If you're close enough to m1 a healthy survivor, go for a point blank hatchet throw instead, then use a normal attack to down them. This negates the usual cool down from normal attacks and lets you down the survivor quickly without giving him the window to run to the next loop.
---
Other than that watch good huntress players on twitch like scottjund, ralphfromthesouth and entoanthepack. 
---
I have fun even if I get tunnelled or camped as a survivor man, IDK what to tell you. the game is fun and if I get caught it's my own fault. be mad at your team if they do shitty, unsafe unhooks, not the killer
---
People on this reddit are SOOOOOOOOOO bizarrely entitled it's absolutely insane.
---
my neck hurts
---
slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken...
---
Enduring+Spirit Fury is a core combo on any killer weak to pallet looping
---
It doesn’t necessarily mitigate a fuckup, it’s a one time use perk and it doesn’t quarantee anything
---
&gt; it still has the Kinetic energy of 4 20-gauge shotgun blasts hitting you at the same time.
---
So, like, half a David?
---
It ended up being a typical hatch standoff, but when Green put their toolbox down, Red let them go. I just thought it was kind of funny and sweet.
---
And that’s the way it is...huh!
---
 I concur, I too also fear that when trying to escape the killers grasp, I have the whale on the analog stick to raise my chances of escape. I am afraid that in one of those instances I will end up destroying my controller. And I use special edition controllers too, not the ones you can buy at a gamestop (20th anniversary). I hooe they can do something to alleviate the pressure ok the analog, maybe a combination of an analog with the shape (ps4) buttons, i dunno
---
She got several buffs post-release that made it harder for survivors to judge whenever she's phasing or not. Now she's actually one of the killers that's viable at higher rank, up there with the likes of Hag and Billy. 
---
Lmao imagine this game being boring and unfun
---
Pretty sure that doesn't rhyme
---
Decisive strike 
---
What do you mean? They only fix the exploits and not the DCs
---
Lol I mean you're not wrong hahaha.  Definitely mistyped that one.  But the sentiment is the same.  Billy Trapper, neither needs that perk anywhere near red ranks.  Got to take the training wheels off and learn to play efficient killer games at some point.
---
How long does it take to get to level 40? I play like three hours a day.
---
Honestly I feel like the more killers they introduce the more annoying the game gets. I miss when I just played the first several killers. Spirit is the first killer In a long time that I've found to actually be fun on both sides. 
---
CAN WE PLEASE FIX THE CONSTANT CRASHING ITS REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING HAVING TO RESTART MY GAME 9 TIMES IN 1 HOUR
---
I don't understand what you mean. The offering will still oblige by the minimum amount of hooks. That is never a problem. 
---
Say the gen starts with 20 hooks, then reduces it to 15, and then with the offering to 12... and the minimum is 10. There's no problem there, is there?
---
Nurse?
---
If you check all buffs/nerfs over a long period of time you'll see that the survivors have been heavily favored for the longest time and they still are. The developers do not dare change the Hatch mechanic because it'd upset survivors and they're afraid of the backlash changing DS would bring.
---
Even nerfs to popular perks like self-care was psuedo buffs.
---
I feel sorry for you and that doctor.
---
Seeing as how bad the frames were for you I could only guess it was like watching PowerPoint 2007 for the killer
---
WTF IS UP WITH TRASH FN KILLER EVERY FUCKING EVENT. ITS TOXIC SHIT AFTER TOXIC SHIT NOT A SINGLE GOOD FUCKING GAME.
---
No.
---
Really? Legion? Aside from their locker peeking (which is totally bollocks), they really don't seem all that stronk.  
---
But I guess that's why they *can* locker peek.
---
Kyle or kylee?

You wouldn't believe what a hammer can do to a broken leg.
---
Is it even possible to force a depip without playing hyper-immersed anymore?
---
"Mum... Why is that strange man taking a picture of a stick?"
---
"I dont know hunny, just keep walking and dont look at him"
---
Did you even try to block out the names lmao a different part was blocked out each time
---
You can in your steam settings, I forget where, but it only goes as low as 250.
---
Already suggested before. Excluding people that way will never happen. Not to mention they slready decided to resolve it all through thr upcoming dedicated servers.
---
I really hope so.
---
Don’t get me wrong I hate Noed as much as the next guy. People seem to give Freddy and trapper a pass cuz of their low tier abilities 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I HAVE LOST SO MANY RED ENVELOPES FROM KILLERS DISCONNECTING OR THE GAME JUST CRASHING. I LOVE THIS GAME BUT IT CRASHES SO BLOODY MUCH! 
---
This was the first run. 😎
---
R2 vs R10 has nothing to do with balance, and dedicated servers won't fix that.
---
Survivor: Self Care, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Iron Will, Urban Evasion.
---
Killer: Ruin and BBQ should be ran pretty much all the time (you can sub out BBQ when you have unlocked everything in the game). Then other good perks are Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Make Your Choice, Surveillance, Discordance, Monitor and Abuse, Haunting Grounds, Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound, Save the Best for Last etc.
---
I won't say "get gud", tho I will say "git gud". Honestly though, I rarely see good Legion players. They're extremely easy to 360 and fake window/pallet vault
---
Shadowborn on Hag? Why? What's the benefit? Is it because she's short?
---
WHY YOU DISCONNECT BEFORE I HOOK YOU? MY BBQ STACK IS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOONE!
---
Ah, the only good thing to come from that ad...
---
Scp-096
---
polycythemia could be pretty crazy, you work on the last gen at +120% speed? and the only penalty is that you have to not heal/heal slower, running iron will+dead hard+adrenaline is already a viable strategy and that would be pretty insane to add massively increased gen rush speed. Im thinking more like 5/10/15% and maxed at 3 gens completed and im not even sure that wouldnt be too much. To reference resilience, that one perk increases gen speed by 9% at max range when injured , this would be substantially more powerful in its current state after even 1 gen let alone 4. Also acrophobia would interact kinda weird but sure the rest are good.
---
Who's the gaylord in the picture?
---
Just annoys me when I see a Billy, Leatherface or a Myers using NOED. They're telling the survivors that they're toxic 
---
You cut the best part..
---
What have you done
---
Monto, arguably the most famous dbd streamer ever who came up with the famous catchphrase:
---
 "Slow the game down, just a little bit" -Monto on Hex: Ruin
---
Well killers get to brag about them Moring people so why not survivors? Survivors matter too ya know
---
Hitting people over the little white fences is the absolute best feeling. It's air, not a wall.
---
A lot of people will do that if you slug for the 4k. It's a 'hah you wanted your full points I don't think so'. A small price to pay when the killer goes full out like that. 
---
Of course Michael is gunning for Jake's ass. Fucking perv. 
---
Has it had a buff? 
---
So stick to survivor for a while. Going into matches as killer knowing you have garbage internet is just knowing you're making the game miserable for everyone involved. Especially if you're DCing during an event which removes all the survivors point gains and just wastes their time.
---
I went through it, then I stopped being a bad player.
---
-cut corners better
---
-dont respect pallets
---
-play like you're actively going for all 4, don't just tunnel 1 at a time
---
-dont camp unless the exit gates are actually open
---
-dont run Spirit Fury without Enduring wtf??
---
-dont run the same build for every killer, they play differently
---
https://youtu.be/ur48jVNNlKk
---
I honestly just wait for the day people accuse me of trying to sound smart when using the phrase scrub mentality since it happens quite a lot. I do not use it cause it its fancy. Scrub mentality and circlejerking are just two things that are omnipresent on this subreddit.  
---
Oh RIP, whenever someone links gatekeeping I binge that subreddit for more than a hour lol. 
---
Yeah man killers bragging about morying or downing survivors with NOED is the exact same type of cringe.  Two sides if the same toxic coin.  
---
The people seem to disagree unfortunately. Sauce?
---
I especially love when shit like this happen ONLY during chases. Like suddenly and magically the connection is rubber-banding the second you almost get away from the killer. Not suspicious at all. 
---
was looking for this comment
---
I never DC, as a survivor, when I would DC, I run around the killer, give him some points, and then suicide on hook
---
Havent had any problems. I usually am waiting in a lobby for 5 mins tops for both killer and survivor. It might just be your location lacking in high rank opponents 
---
Freddy is the best killer to play in this situation. Just hold out your power and check every locker. 
---
No u
---
??? Cpt
---
Her weakness is looping because her base speed (110%) is less than most other killers (115%) and if the survivor knows it and is decent at looping there's not much you can do (survivors are less bulky then killers so it's also easier for them to run around corners), might be best to switch to finding another weaker or otherwise busy survivor when that happens, if you can. 
---
She's a fighter jet cuz her missiles but she can't helicopter well.
---
I wouldn't recommend spies on any killer especially not doc you should replace it with something like discordance, distressing or spirit fury 
---
This has to be bait right? TydeThyme? Really? 
---
&gt;Dodging is gross. I don't dodge when I see the 'Purple Flashlight' gang to burn their kit. Don't do it to me because of your false sense of righteousness. 
---
Hey I'm kind of new to this game, why is dodging, what I assume is a flashlight, so wrong?
---
This is beyond science 
---
To prevent any sort of doxxing or harassment, I think.
---
Self-care, it's the best for most situations
---
If she throws it into a fire and there's hooks nearby, run.
---
Lmao I had a dumbass last night who responded very similarly when I said GG after he killed me. Some people take this game way too seriously
---
Bond so you can see your teammates being useless
---
Oh, and, I never learned how to throw hatchets over things well but hopefully one of slightly_rational's twitch streamers can teach you, or maybe you can ask this machine: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/am52wi/what_do_you_think_about_this_montage_i_made/
---
Thanks 😎
---
What map was it?
---
A guy reported me for cheating becouse I "got chainsaw hits to often" and in another match for hopening a closet with a survivor in it. Nothing surprises me anymore
---
Lerys
---
Bonus for helping escape the dreamworld
---
No price set at the moment, but I may just sell all the parts as a base white kit for buyers to paint and glue together. 
---
But with who, that's the question. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I run bond and pharmacy. I find bond is more useful than just a self care alternative, and pharmacy is a pretty decent perk too.
---
Self care eliminates needing others or a med kit, but the amount of time it wastes can be massive.
---
Mildly related. Never run bond. Being able to see just how much time your teammates spend doing nothing hurts.
---
Hey mate, if you make any other posts like this try to remember to block out the names. Privacy issues and stuff :)
---
Plus Kindred for everyone to see.
---
If you are camping the hatch like a vulture and let your mate die for it - I will wreck you if I can. If there‘s one thing I hate as a killer, it‘s anti-mates. 
---
Yes, very good indeed. ;w;
---
hag is bad idk why people think she's good
---
i'm not wrong 
---
Not sure what you play on but on PC I believe you have to purchase the hag unlike console, so some people might not want to do that despite it being available through shards
---
The first one was bs, the second on the window was legit. She is slower but she got normal lunge and directly moved right after the hit to run around the T-wall, she wasn‘t that far away the moment she hit you. 
---
A fresh meme from 2016 right here
---
And it makes a louds ass noise of a baby crying. 
---
Thanks! &lt;3 
---
He was pretty ongoing about the rank difference, I guess he meant that.
---
Also if it‘s his internet being laggy, dedicated servers will actually be worse for him 
---
I play killer way more than survivor and I almost never encounter Borrowed Time, even at rank 1. The only time I ever see it is against super altruistic SWF groups.
---
Hitting the unhooker is not a bad play. Applying pressure to multiple survivors is a very important part of being a killer. You down the unhooker while the hooked survivor runs off and spends time healing, forcing a different survivor to come and make the save, leaving maybe one survivor doing gens and applying a lot of pressure.
---
But the better play is to hook a survivor and then leave the hook to patrol gens or follow a BBQ&amp;Chili aura. The majority of the time you shouldn't even be attacking the hooked survivor or the unhooker, you should be chasing a third survivor. Borrowed Time isn't even a good perk if you play right.
---
That sweet fps.
---
New perk: Anywhere but here. Once per trial instantly teleport to a random location.
---
Yes, ignore any counter-arguments and try to "prove" your argument with purely anecdotal evidence. You make claims like "You can easily trick the nurse with her teleports" and never back them up with any sort of logical argument.
---
I always get people who DC against both so, therefore, they are both S tier Killers! People DC against Doctor too so, therefore, he is also S tier Killer!
---
Happened to me at a pallet. A meg was healing me and there was a trap besides the pallet. So during the healing i tele'd to the other side of the pallet. Luckily i didnt get caught in the trap.
---
He moonwalks to lose chase then follows your blood by looking at the ground.
---
counterable btw :)
---
I played against Myers on Autohaven a while ago, and me and this other guy were doing the gen in the garage and all of a sudden Myers comes in through the door and grabs the other guy off the gen, I'd say it scared the living shit out him lol
---
Maining Quentin cause he‘s voiced by McLean. 
---
Fight me. 
---
thats nice, I got reported for hacking yesterday, idk or its salt or he legit thought I was wallhacking or something (I run discordance and surveillance).
---
Its the same way with survivor. Its not like I'm trying all day. My connection saying its good but I can't be if I DC ever time. Have not played for a solid week by now with one attempt to everyday.
---
Console gameplay 101. Trying to play this game on any vanilla console is infuriating. 
---
Yeah before legion the map worked just fine. 
---
Lmao this fits perfectly. 
---
Especially since most Meg players are as useless as Tien throughout Dragonball Super
---
(Disclaimer: This is a joke) 
---
I was playing with randoms, and we ended up making the killer quit 3 gens in. I was top, and I didn't feel like typing everyone's name (on xbox) so I just sent GG to 2nd place. I guess they were with a SWF, because his friend messages me, upset I didnt say GG to him because "he did most of the work". Some fucking people.
---
Nice assumptions there. Also you should go see a doctor if you can't keep games and life seperated. You seem to be on the spectrum buddy. 
---
Well he's almost right about the "your pals are probably getting a kick out of this" part now..
---
Throw a pebble at him
---
My friend said : they should rename it to : "Waiting for daylight"
---
Jesus christ the try hard on this killer is disgusting.  The man got a 3k which is an overwhelming victory got a good game and spouts this type of toxicity?  What a hobgoblin 
---
Feels good man
---
I came from TF2 and Warframe, both cosmetic-heavy games. I probably spent over $1000 on TF2 for the 2 years I played it and about $500 on Warframe and I regret NONE of it LOL
---
It’s such bullshit! I was playing earlier, and it happened again in my second game of the day! It’s gotten to the point where I have to use a map offering every game
---
I just realized that I titled it "the DBD's Immersion" I'm gonna oof myself off a bridge
---
I had a piggy waiting behind the gates once not so long ago, but I heard her breathing
---
I’m not going to wait it out when there are two more survivors...
---
Well obviously...
---
I just can't bring myself to spend a penny on cosmetics. Feels like a real waste of money. 
---
tbh it really is a waste of money, but i have a compulsive need to show people that im richer than them or something LMAO
---
That could be me, except that I don't play huntress. But I had a very similar game where I did hook both once for the barbecue stacks but let them go.
---
Honestly, if you tryhard as killer in such a match you're doing something wrong.
---
i think i know what you mean; I do like that you now have more options for diversifying your characters a bit more, but I also like the original idea of all the clothes looking dirty &amp; a bit damaged, and less peacock-ish. but whilst I also prefer the 'normal'-looking cosmetics, I'm happy for anyone who loves and wears more colourful &amp; bright outfits - im sure there's also been some people shaking their head at my defaults 😉
---
The real mvp
---
With the right perks and add-ons you might be able to get up to four disconnects in one game. Godspeed.
---
oh yeah, for sure. I always wear bright and shiny cosmetics like the kami-flage charity case DLC piece for dwight, but i just wish that they'd made more cosmetics that look dirty and damaged while also maintaining how bright it is if that's what they really wanted for whatever reason, kinda like how the harajuku graffiti artist outfit looks. (i mean i still have issues with the pink hair, but it at least somewhat makes sense and would look out of place if it were black or something)
---
Fair tbh 
---
He killed you but you’re trying to rub something in? Seems legit.
---
Are you referring to the post about how someone thinks a plague doctor should be the next killer? Because that was purely speculation.
---
You must be one of those guys who DC when they get dribbled.
---
How the hell did you manage that? If you didn't have the Coins then AC would have been your only option and you must confirm your purchase so it'd be hard to have done this by accident. Moronic when done twice.
---
**duh**
---
I dont consider legion op as a survivor main (and not a very old player at that) ive played a few of the killers and considering that my performance with them was basically average they cant be that op. Their kit is rather simple but they seem somewhat add-on reliant, which would favour seasoned killers that put time into their blood web and also have a sturdy understanding of how to play properly (regarding skills that are translatable across other killers). 
---
Regardless it kills me that every game where ive played against legion someone on my team ragequits the minute literally anything happens especially if before first gen is completed
---
If you're on PC then you can try launching the game directly from your Steam Library. It's what works for me and some others.
---
If you're on console you're probably fucked. Haven't seen a solution posted for console players with this issue yet.
---
For bonus points, bring the coin offering. Then get hooked immediately and watch as your teammates open all the chests and find brown medkits
---
Probably because they want Jake Park to be mexican for some reason as if "Park" was a mexican last name lol. Park is a Korean last name. Jake is Korean and he moved to the U.S with his dad if I remember correctly. 
---
Pyramid head from silent hill
---
I would empty my life savings for that as a killer
---
Immersion dies after 50-100hrs anyhow
---
Yep. Same with hooks. You used to be able to tell which killer it was by the hook, but then they changed it to be by map.
---
oh yeah huh. i totally forgot about that LMAO
---
You don't have 2 Perks spawning in the Bloodweb until level 25 and you get a few levels before then that have 2, which I believe is every 5 levels.
---
true, but even when you're playing extremely seriously and looping the killer around the entire map for 5 gens, the general feeling of dirtiness and things from the game still carry over
---
Money&gt; Artistic value is the view of every company, all the time. This is the microtransaction-filled state of the industry we have found ourselves in, and only the consumer is to blame. I remember a time we used to laugh at horse armor, not buy it.
---
I dont even use ds lmao.
---
Self-Care is still the best perk, Bond has multiple uses other then just healing (its great for avoiding dumbass survivors), and Pharmacy does what it says on the tin, if you really like medkits its nice.
---
"Is it possible to learn this power?*
---
All I got was 'gg ez baby noob no kills with 3 blinks'
---
I actually play as legion and i dont quit... i know those players are rare but i just deal with lossed ya know?@
---
The feeling of running in cicles scooby do chase with circus music and a laugh track every time a massive beast of a killer gets fucked by a plank. 
---
imagine that, but the survivor looks like they have clown makeup on
---
Then you are just braindead.Go follow your lord and savior tyde and fuck off.Hag is pretty much top 5 killers.She has insane map pressure.She cannot get looped if you place the right traps.She just has a very high skill cap and if you are too dumb to understand her potential then you can go fuck yourself.
---
Yes you are dumb bitch.
---
*You all deserve to be hooked*
---
I don't see how anyone playing Legion can *not* hit R1. I farmed the Deranged Pursuit achievement and never hooked anyone, yet i pipped every single game.
---
Whispers, my man
---
Yes. 
---
The fact that this sub upvoted this shit is mindboggling. They'll complain about crutch perks, busted addons or DCs and Moris but defend a prestige and item bug that allows someone to get hundreds of Moris or offerings/add-ons/items of their choosing. 
---
I don't believe that people only abused the prestige system and didn't touch items, there's not that much honor among thieves. And half of the people in the initial thread about the exploit (I bet this guy among them) were saying shit like "well I already tried out the prestige exploit might as well pick up some Moris/BPS/toolboxes while I'm at it if I'm screwed anyway teeheehee!" They also figured BHVR wouldn't do anything and said they knew what they were getting into so they'd be fine with a ban, yet here we are so surprised and outraged that they actually did something about it.
---
Finished one game once where I played Michael, only ended up getting one hook, and everybody escaped. Let's just say I stopped playing for a while after that point.
---
The survivors have lined in terror all round. The sounds of chainsaws buzzing and screams in the distance punctuate the monotone clicking of the generators. Every encounter with the Glowing Redneck ends with someone on a hook. The survivors play smart, there are many close calls and back and forth. Finally, the gens are almost done, the last person sprints for the open hatch, her groans of pain drowned out by the roar of a chainsaw closing in. A horrible impact, but as the beast recovers from the blow he inflicted, the survivor crawls into the open portal and to safety. A faint utterance is heard from the beast: "gg". And from the closed hatch, a reply "EZ BABY KILLER".
---
CHAT OFFLINE- Host disconnected.
---
He moves at survivor sprinting speed while revving, not "basically the same speed"
---
Up to you on how you want it deal with it. 
---
Well that doesn't really mean much since he is still basically inside you :/
---
That was my initial thought, seems like he is good at countering players who only know how to pallet/window loop you. Forces people to rely more on stealth and sneaky tactics.
---
Want and font rhymes for me so maybe it's something to do with accents.
---
I did this for an ace today haha Clown was slugging me and we was both next to the hatch so i let him have it XD
---
This post has nothing to do with winning a game, it' just crap that u can instadown someone so easily with a killer that "somewhat takes skill", and considering that the rev up time with add-ons is pretty short that 30% less movement speed while reving up means u might get at leasr 3 meters distance and attempt to juke him while otherwise he just rests the chainsaw on your head.
---
No need to get super salty, and it is pretty hard to dodge since either the hitbox is shite or because the blade is clipping through you so u cant really do anything.
---
Both are equally not immersive at all.
---
Okay. So when will survivors get a perk that completely negates the killers ability to swipe their weapon?
---
ive experienced alot of people DCing as soon as the game starts and ive heard its because they want to derank :/ its so not fair and more often than not nobody manages to escape and its selfish.
---
Thx, i actually will use it
---
I agree.
---
cant you take a meme pal smh
---
I preferbly take Bamboozle, Brutal Strenght, Fire up, and Iron Maiden.
---
&gt;This post has nothing to do with winning a game
---
What do you think is going to happen when you essentially freeze the character in place while he's trying to use the main part of his kit? 
---
&gt;It' just crap that u can instadown someone so easily with a killer that "somewhat takes skill"
---
It's no *so easily* and it does take *skill*. The issue is usually on the survivor end. 
---
&gt;No need to get super salty
---
Stop being one of those gamers. I play survivor far more than I do killer. You're being an entitled gamer who just wants a win gifted to them. 
---
I run Franklins because fuck your flashlights and toolboxes 
---
did u just completely miss the first hit where she was litteraly nowhere and then suddenly appeared a few seconds after she hit lmao??? maybe her phasing lagged and thats why you didnt see her xD
---
Youre delusional about balancing Killers with perks. If you take perks into consideration that is the stupidest idea ever. 
---
A fair point but at the same time i wouldnt put it past BHVR to not wanna poke that bear lmao. I guess we’ll see what happens tho, ur probs right its just a matter of when rather than if in that case.
---
For real. It took me less than 10 hours to level him up. Not to mention that his other perks are super nice too.
---
Go terrorise someone else, pal
---
It's a visual representation of the survivor entitlement in effect.
---
You'd do best in closing that post-game chat window and keep it closed. It'll help you retain sanity and make you less frustrated in the long run.
---
I was being nice but ok
---
Wrong. It's not a solution it's a bandaid that will hinder their learning progress.
---
True panic is when you realize the killer burned to Lery's. Because there is only one reason a killer would want to burn to Lery's.
---
Gets to tier 3 and uses tombstone immediately
---
The art is good but that looks nothing like Kate.
---
I'm a p3 50 nurse main with a few months of experience, I run bbq, discordance, surveillance and nurses calling
---
I like running Franklin's on Trapper and putting a trap under the items.
---
The sight has now been burned into my brain
---
Yeah, it is rough, esp when with soemone like Legion, it only removes the bleedout timer, it does not heal them. Freddy, it heals them and removes the dream status. It sucks.
---
However, since you are new to Freddy, may I recommend a video called "DBD: Freddy Transition Guide"? It teaches a really good mindgame you don't see a lot of people use, but that can give you a major edge. Also, glad you enjoy Freddy, he is easily one of the most overlooked killers
---
So you want him to move even slower than Leatherface revvin'?
---
Best way is to pressure survivors - if you have one survivor hooked and chasing other one, that's 2 less survivors doing gens. And if others are in any way altruistic (and more often than not they are) you have only 0-1 survivors doing gens.
---
I rather just have both perks removed, but eh, what do I know?
---
They are not learning the game though? 
---
No i don't take perks into consideration, i just gave an example like okay he can find me relatively easy if im not near him r a locker,
---
bruh memes aside thats what I am always saying:
---
Noed and Ds shouldnt be in the game
---
If they have huge problems even with Nurse, there's still a lot to learn.
---
Do what I do. Treat them like NPCs who are just there to give you points.
---
I like to do this when I dominate a group. like, I'll feed them the hatch to the last person if they had someone DC, or if it's 1 or 2 people all alone, ill just chase one guy and DING DONG DING DONG and never hit him/her (Wraith &lt;3)
---
This. Bond is the best choice of the three.
---
Self-care is only better if you plan on going very body-blocky and aggressive, taking hits and such. Great coupled with WGLF.
---
*whack*
---
Use shitpost flair thanks. 
---
Yikes
---
Also since y’all been complaining about looping and survivors that are op they are just trying to make you guys shut up.
---
The killer is not supposed to kill1! 161! How dare you play the game you're supposed to let us go!252511! 
---
Do you smell that?
---
Smells like a Meme incoming.
---
Because they don't want to play "M1 simulator" since they forgot that's all survivors do anyways.
---
Seriously guys, you gotta bleep out people's names before you post on Reddit.....
---
Who hurt you
---
Because this is funny and pokes fun at the meme of survivors disconnecting against anything they don't like. Just saying "I d/c against legion because wagh" isn't funny.
---
Trying to derank and farm shards. 
---
Always break gens when you have the opportunity. If you're not already in a chase (sometimes even if you are in a chase) break the gens. There's a good chance someone else is nearby to finish the gen while you're chasing the one survivor. 
---
Also, as someone else suggested, injuring survivors and then going back to the gens is a great technique to slow the game down. You can also use perks like sloppy butcher or thanatophobia (or both) and ruin to help aid in slowing the game down. 
---
Lastly, if you're engaged in a chase, don't let it go on forever. You'll get a feel for how long is too long as every chase is different. Also, if you see a lot of pallets where you are, just disengage the chase. Go find a gen and try again. Don't tunnel. It will only cost you the game. 
---
Speaking as a really good nurse with long blink builds, I can succinctly say survivors cannot interact against me. Either I fuck up my blink or they die. There is no in-between, and nothing they do matters.
---
So I don't understand this argument.
---
Oh my sweet summer child... 
---
I think you might be right. Disconnecting, no matter what the reason, is a bitch move and shouldn't be tolerated.
---
He doesnt even have to turn if he revs it up inside u what the heck are you talking about furthemore why are u explaining how he works when in like 15/20 matches i get a billy, which kinda shows how hard he is to play :/  Then again instead of saying something constructive or offering advice on how to dodge since you are clearly an expert all i hear is "get good you entitled bastard" so im just gonna ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Have fun oh master of survivors and killers.
---
Well are you a helpful little nugget. 
---
*DEFENSIVE STRIKE*
---
Woah youre so good  do you play on PC or console ? Also the huntress one triggered me so bad you was tunneled so hard. I loved that team effort on the end of the freddy though! great games! 
---
noted. thanks. 
---
mori everyone i guess
---
noted. good advice
---
idea for freddy skill checks no longer wake up survivors. the only ways to wake up our getting hooked and other survivors who our already awake. 
---
another idea is freddy has noed in the dream world. so putting a survivor in the dream world is the first hit then once in the dream world freddy only has to hit a survivor once to down them. 
---
what do you guys think? 
---
I too only get mildly annoyed by 9mm bullets piercing my skin
---
A smell, a smelly smell that smells... Smelly
---
Imagine thinking urban evasion and self care was toxic lol. Perks cant be toxic. Sorry. Noed isnt toxic. Ds isnt toxic. They are in the game for a reason. Using the games mechanics doesnt make you toxic except tbagging mori spamming and bming on hook. Etc
---
And every time you crouch it makes a squeaky toy sound.
---
Congrats mate I mean I don't know you but I don't think you worked hard enough to deserve  DC's when you grab people from the gens or if you're playing surviour then getting left behind because they had a lantern
---
Honestly y'all make the hat sound so appealing it might incentivize the same behavior you want to stop lol.
---
Billy doesn't need nerfs, get good
---
What is hitops? 
---
I say it's not my fault that you're virgins 
---
Trust me , trust me people get annyoed and triggered over this stupid insult 
---
Im fairly certain freddys power locks on to survivor through walls and stuff. Unless shes in a locker everytime your near, or in the basement, a couple sweeps through the map, his power will eventually lock on to her.
---
Haha thanks you should make a YouTube and post more vids like this!
---
Your comment is not relevant. It’s the survivors objective to do the gens and get out, but it’s also the killer’s objective to stop them from doing the gens and not let them escape. It’s not madness it’s how it’s meant to be played.
---
Well we kinda already know two things about the next chapter. The killer will be from an older time period than huntress, who is WW1. And I think Jannick mentioned in the "Creation of Legion" stream, that the next killers power won't be as complex as Spirit or Legion in design. So I kinda expect something more straight forward like Clown.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
This here, they were very under powered in PBE and everyone was clamoring for buffs because they liked the design so much.  The big mistake was putting buffs out with the live release instead of testing them like you said. 
---
Now everyone still loves the design, but hates the game play.
---
They are very addon and perk reliant though, they're pretty boring and sometimes just painful to play without augmenting them with them. Especially since Feral Frenzy not only  hides scratch marks it erases them and you can't see new scratch marks for a few seconds after cooldown is over (this is in my experience with Legion I've got them at P2 and it's very reliable to replicate). I'm not asking for them to see scratch marks during frenzy but it's just an example of bugs that also made it out of testing.
---
But I think I saw someone post Legion is Nurse for lazy people which I'd say is a fair assessment, just as mobile without the skill shot aspect of a blink but not quite as deadly without being cheesy.  The cheesiest I run on legion is sloppy butcher and bloodhound because I as a player am bad at tracking and I'm okay to admit that lol. 
---
i agree with this so hard
---
I posted a similar question before and got answers like ragequitting or just having to leave for something, but I think ragequitting is the main answer
---
The only killer I dc is Legion and clown.
---
They are not op.
---
I just don't feel like getting stressed, camped, tortured or Hindered to death.
---
Oh my god im cured 😍
---
OH HELL NO! This ping is like getting 80% ppl from my country and they are toxic or idiots... I rather go with somebody else.
---
I love the little animation for a survivor finding someone in a locker. The little surprised look is really funny to me.
---
Camping and tunnel = dc
---
lmao, this is a youtube link. 
---
Here's a vid you might like that i made

Don’t bitch about how the game is designed to be played simple as that, I main killer and I’m not on here bitching about it 
---
So I’m the rank 11, this has more or less been my experience on dead by daylight the past few weeks, not SWF, I don’t smurf or anything like that it’s just been terrible matchmaking, is the player pool on Xbox tiny? I thought I was the best survivor on Xbox until my rank 16 killer ass went against a bunch of red ranks!
---
I used to narrate creepypasta, ended up changing what I did
---
Looks fair to me
---
That’s wholesome to me.
---
So killers can have it in the actual game right now to make it easier to catch survivors, but survivors can't have a fantasy countermeasure to make it easier to get away?
---
The problem are two things : SWF and that dumbass of ochido 
---
But i haven't seen it used like that at all. So even if it should be, it isn't. 
---
What am i seeing?! I heard stories of non-toxic survivors but this...
---
And you realise he has noed
---
just hit them with
---
"aww i had fun im sorry if you didnt!"
---
or give a quick "gg lol" and leave it at that
---
maybe bringing a battery that spawns at the finished gens and you have to bring that to the exit gates or a fuse box somewhere on the map
---
I really need to see this from the killers perspective. I could not imagine getting surrounded by survivors to be so crippling, unless flashlight spam is like a flash-bang.
---
I legit spammed Pig and got to rank 2 Killer :shrug:
---
*Degenerates like you belong in a ~~cross~~ Hook*
---
so pretty! nice drawing :)
---
Imo, the counter to legion is running him around pallets/trees/rocks. He’s not fast enough to catch up to you. He’s got more collision on the obstacles than you do. If he tunnels you down after he hits you with frenzy the first time, yeah good luck.
---
I’ve played legion my fair share of times, and honestly he’s average (if you play how he’s intended) or stupid broken (franks mixtape/blood trail trick). 
---
If I were one of the devs, I’d keep deep wound (mainly because of borrowed time), but completely rework legion. He is not fun to play against if you’re against an asshole. Also, I’m a P3 Laurie main on survivor, so I stick out like a sore thumb but man, sometimes I don’t want to tolerate those chases with him.
---
Devs: we fixed toten placement
---
Me: brings thrill of the hunt to avoid mf's destroying that within 6 seconds 
---
Also me: forgets that you have to give up a chase to check the toten and loses ruin anyway
---
To be fair, if I’m facing a scumbag killer that’s camping/tunneling my ass over and over for the kill, I will be toxic, and I will shit on you. And I will dc so you don’t get the kill. If I die from my own fault, I’ll take the death. Killers like that piss me the fuck off, especially low ranks.
---
I finally came back to get a angry 2man swf who killed themselves on hook and messaged me back that I shouldn’t crouch as pig (rank 15)
---
You can't outrun someone that is faster and as agile than you
---
That's pretty much it
---
Oh yeah and also hit 1 time with frenzy and cancel it to hit second time is also a thing
---
That RPG-7 still won’t stop the legion.
---
And why should they do that, noed and D-strike are both balance perks and works on dumb players, Anyone with a brain can countered it.
---
I remember running around frantically picking up the gears, but it was prob bc of his footsteps outside of the room. I obviously didn't know he couldn't enter that room and he had struck fear in my heart. My bad.
---
Green Medkit but 80% faster search*
---
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
---
Completely agreed. Legion is in a weird spot of being overpowered (denies looping with only minimal skill required) and underpowered (worthless outside of frenzy, multiple hits to down). Despite having giant glowing indicators saying "now hit the other guys", he's only really good at tunneling - the single most hated thing in the community. 
---
I was giving Legion the benefit of the doubt, but now it's very clear, the character was misguided and rushed, and is painfully uninspired compared to the original concept (disguise, anyone?). A real shame. Hopefully BHVR notices this and comes back to fix it, but I find it pretty unlikely.
---
Who's frank
---
Scratched mirror + Bunny/Monitor = Myers with 0 terror radius that can see everybody through walls and Lery's is a map that's nearly impossible to see the killer coming with all the twists and turns
---
I don’t dc as killer, ever. 
---
A month ago I’d say that I don’t dc as survivor either. But now I will dc if 1) I’m getting farmed or 2) it’s a legion 
---
Because fuck it, it’s a video game. I’ll suck it up to a point but after hours of it I want to have fun and I’ll bail on a match I know will piss me off 
---
This power can only mean one thing
---
I see Legion turned into Survivors finally? 
---
Look at my username 
---
Aw damn. Just watched the movie again and thought I was clever
---
This is a killers worst nightmare
---
Yeah that makes alot of sense actually
---
It's a decent way to catch a killer off guard and lunge toward a pallet or vault. 
---
It basically only happen during 2x weekends on extremely rare occasions.
---
Best girl
---
Man, y'all love bitching about Legion. 
---
Had my first Legion game tonight, playing as him. Could have taken a 1K but let him crawl for hatch. Then, I played Doc and Spirit for rituals, and easily 4K'd.
---
Legion is not inescapable, and y'all bad. 
---
Fuck me, right?
---
Totally unbalanced. This is ridiculous. The killer only needs to search lockers?
---
It should be an instant kill on the killer. Then the survivor needs to emote on his body 
---
actually, it's pretty common (at least, in the matches I play)... when a few players just dc (or it's only a 2 or 3 survivors game) killers usually just let you go... and yes, such killers really exist, and I always thank them after the game 😊
---
No. It's because he treats his opinions as facts.
---
I like Wraith more than Huntress. Does that make Wraith better than Huntress? No, no it does not.
---
If I were There, I would honestly believe and genuinely argue that Wraith is better than Huntress.
---
whyyy?
---
I love the shirtless myers behind the wall
---
I would definitely be able to understand why; there's practically no way to give Legion that power without completely making him a noob stomper (Oh, haven't seen this Survivor yet) or busted as hell against randoms while completely worthless against SWF (This you? Thanks, I'm going to run then).
---
Them's dangerous words to say around these parts, stranger...
---
If killer is bad it's like a neon sign "NOED clutch plays incoming"
---
who is ochido?
---
well he has a thousand hours so he must be good
---
I destroyed a team the other day as little miss piggie. As in three hooked all of them and killed them all with only one Gen done. They still spammed the chat with gg ez. ez noob. 
---
I just sent them a lol and a gg and moved on. 
---
I'll never understand people in this game  so why bother trying.
---
name of the meme please
---
ty. noted 
---
The update is so you cant get hurt untill you are " completely on the ground" which is not true because I have gotten farmed when I was not on the ground before

It's infuriating.

---
Very nice. Have my upvote
---
Personally, when I play killer. I hope survivors feel confident enough to try this shit. Just gives me another person to hook. 
---
Camping works because survivors aren't compatible with the concept of letting people be.
---
If I know the killer camps, I am gonna be working on generators but I know survivors who'll rather camp around the hook waiting for a chance to save.. even if it means waiting there for the whole two minutes of sacrifice time.
---
SURVIVOR DC
---
MAN IM SO HAPPY TO SEE ONE PERSON DC AT THE START OF THE MATCH. DON'T GET ME STARTED ON THE RAGEQUITTERS.
---
LOVE 3V1 GAMES FROM THE GET GO.
---
Very lazy
---
Yay! :) 
---
people don't realize you can hear them from lockers and when you pull em out they accuse you of hacking cuz "theres no way he saw me go into that locker!!"
---
sharp hand joe 😂
---
Legion isn’t strong, he’s mediocre at best. People hate/DC against Legion because once you get hit with Feral Frenzy, you have to mend and heal, he finds you again and then you mend and heal over and over. You can’t use pallets and windows to evade them as they can vault them.
---
I mean it was a little harshly put for sure but he kinda has a point, if you let billy get right on your ass and start chainsawing then the issue is that you messed up, not that billy is just too OP. 
---
He’s a strong killer because he can catch you off guard due to his sprinting movement speed and if you don’t get to a loop quick enough then yah you’re gonna go down. Billy is fine as is, worst comes to worst you can still juke the chainsaw at close range if need be, but he doesn’t need nerfs.
---
I liked your previous meme, I find this pretty lazy

tunneling is just an Illusion of bad survivors 
---
Yes more of this PLEASE!
---
I got stuck in REmake for longer than I'd like to admit for because I couldn't find the big gear ( I had almost no ammo and the room it was in had too  many zombies for me to work with on my first ever try of a Resident Evil game )
---
14:24 THIS, so much THIS!  
---
  
---
This should be mandatory to watch for all those camping shitheads.
---
Exactly if you want people to stop camping you have to show them that it’s a bad idea to sit there for one kill, if you keep feeding them kills going for the unhook they will keep doing it. I do the same thing I’ll run in for the save and if they are camping I’ll turn around and do gens
---
Beautiful
---
I know right?
---
It absolutely can influence it, it just can't prevent the minimum from spawning 
---
Seifuku spirit. I approve.
---
Very well drawn :)
---
True. Though a good number of survivors DC on Doc too, so it could be a toss up. 
---
on the boxes in the basement in the building of springwood and haddonfield (the white downstairs section with a gen, lockers and a pallet) there's a sausage
---
Glad you liked it!
---
I’ve only ever been accused of camping once, and no one else agreed w the person, plus i don’t think i was- i checked back on the person once, but that’s not rlly camping? At least i don’t think so. I stayed almost half a map away the rest of the time. Usually they’re just like “fucking bitch, fuck you” then they disconnect. Though once someone accused me of lag switching; I’m basically brand new to the game, and am not really a gamer.. nor smart enough to do that.(sorry for lowercase, but it’s not Wednesday anymore, so.)
---
YOU CALL HAVING PERKS "EASY MODE" BUT THAT'S HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED!! IS YOUR VERSION OF HARD MODE A KILLER THAT RUNS NO PERKS!?!? OR A SURVIVOR THAT RUNS NO PERKS?? TELL ME WHICH PLAYERS DO THIS EVERY MATCH? I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE DO THIS MATCH AFTER MATCH.

Who disconnects on Legion? Low ranks?
---
Amazing, I came a little 
---
i hate it when i'm slaty 
---
yesss! I live for wholesome content where killers and survivors get along and this is perfect! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
Killers ain't any better but you face 4 survivors every game as a killer, so the statistics becomes a bit screwed.
---
No smol billy =&gt; rip this post
---
awwww, so cute 😊  
---
well done!
---
Unlock Legion then level up their bloodweb. Keep the shards for something more valuable than perks you can quickly unlock with bloodpoints.
---
boy i sure do love my whole team getting slugged because a killer is too scared to deal with a flashlight
---
"You're a wizard Harry."
---
That was last night for me. One game, two sacrifices, lots of pressure, and very positive chat afterward. Next game I think I hooke d  one person and couldn't catch anyone. The chat? "You suck ballz" was about as classy as it got.
---
I'm not questioning your definition of camping or tunneling. I even said that I wasn't in my comment. I'm saying that if you justify combatting toxic behavior with more toxic behavior then you make other people who don't look at camping and tunneling the way you do think they're justified for disqualifying over it. 
---
When did he get weaker than Legion?
---
Not really. I’ve dealt with flashlights before. But if all of you are nearby, you’re just asking for me to go after you. How about two of you do gens and one person saves, instead of everyone swarming the area? Sounds like a much better idea.
---
it's slang for high top shoes
---
Maybe if you've been so reckless AND disrespectful.
---
No because you didn't get the 4k. A lot less points for you. 
---
very good fanart. can you draw more?
---
Well, he has poor taste
---
it's situational as fuck though, so it's fine
---
looks like xD
---
I only DC if something fishy is going on with the connection. If you have a green ping in the lobby but once you're near me, weird shit starts happening, I'm not going to play that out.
---
Even being farmed repeatedly, I'd like my mediocre bloodpoints.

Ochido is a DbD YouTuber/Twitch streamer noted for bragging about being toxic, unironically. He plays like an asshole, and makes it a point to frustrate killers. His real-life problems aside (accusations of witch hunting &amp; preying on underage girls,) he's been banned on DbD multiple times (and on both PC &amp; PS4) for his actions.

QUEUE TIMES SUCK BECAUSE POINTS ARE UNBALANCED AND THE HUGE REWARD FOR ESCAPING WITH A LANTERN FAR OUT PACES THE KILLER REWARD FOR BUSTIN' LAMPS
---
Eh I don’t think nurses calling and bbq are that good. BBQ only good on killers like billy, spirit, and wraith that can quickly travers the map and be on top of survivors quickly or without warning. Nurses calling is only good with sloppy butcher because people usually get healed so fast that you rarely ever benefit from that perk. I’d recommend sloppy butcher and bamboozle in place of those perks
---
Them godlike pigs
---
I am error :P
---
Camping is a valid strategy when you only care about one person for any particular reason 
---
I'm scared.
---
"Look honey! I made you these earrings to commemorate your ranking up yesterday!" - rank 20 husband  
---
"Oh wow! The two best perks in the game!" - rank 19 wife
---
camping "works" when u're playing against solo players, if you're playing against a full pre-made team u get max. 1 kill
---
I like the sloppy butcher idea. I never liked Overcharge, like, at all. I feel it's really easy to counter.
---
No he doesn't 😊
---
Yes, I have no doubt he will show that it's still easy to de-pip killers. That doesn't mean this playstyle will become a meta. Most survivors play (and will play) way less seriously. I'm pretty sure a good killers without Ruin will still do OK at red ranks after Marth's new challenge.
---
Finally someone that actually understands how bE functions.
---
pretty darn new.
---
What killer do you play as? Because if you’re not playing as Nurse or Billy it’s tough to end chases before a gen or gens is completed against a competent survivor. 
---
Killers like Trapper or Leatherface playing without ruin are going to have a frustrating experience at high ranks. 
---
Make atleast a few more killers better. Such as Freddy, Wraith, and Pig
---
I do just fine and can stay rank 1 forever without ruin.  Only matches I do bad in are the one where I miss hits, I kind of prefer gens to get done faster.  matches are long enough as is, more matches = more blood points.  Still trying to save up 200 iridescent  heads on my Huntress
---
A perk which sends a notification when you start working on a cursed Hex Totem to all other survivors &amp; killer.
---
Alerts survivors to the totem's position whilst also alerting the killer that they know.
---
Yeah really accurate but you sorta undermine how powerful sprint burst is. Getting a good hit at the start of a chase can mean the time you’d spend chasing is cut in half if the guy is good at looping, it’s the major advantage stealth killers have in dbd. It doesn’t matter if the killer catches you in a bad spot because you can just sprint burst to a loop, and that’s really powerful as it allows you to freely work on gens or complete tasks in riskier areas that normally wouldn’t be preferable.
---
Make atleast a few more killers meta, such as Wraith, Pig, and Freddy
---
I usually run huntress or Freddy. Sometimes Trapper but gathering up his traps can be a pain
---
These would go well with the Memento Mori print I made yesterday. 😎🙌🏻 Lucky you!
---
There's no reason to pun-ish his score like that.
---
Did you guys even watch the video before commenting? Just go to 14:24 as the top comment suggests and see the results.
---
While he was camping and managed to kill all 4 survivors, he only got 17k bp.
---
However, in the game he lost, where all 4 surv escaped, he got 18k bp.
---
I think that the numbers speak for themselves.
---
All right, to everyone commenting. I get it, the deja vu perk sucks. I've never used it. I guess when he was making the perks to print, he only had a few to choose from due to the lines being too close together in alot of the images of the other perks.  
---
But still, I thought it was pretty cool, and urban evasion is probably my favorite perk in the game, so I'm willing to rock the deja vu perk regardless.  xD
---
Nah man urban is lit
---
It's garbage when you're playing him normally, but as other people have said, Scratched Mirror..
---
Both are the problem. 
---
I think it is because Legion can stall a game indefinitely and toxic players would rather DC than play it out.
---
Same as with all killers just don't let him have 3 gens close together. 
---
What?! A killer took advantage of piss poor survivor playstyle to win? How absurd. Remember folks if we're all looking for the hex or trying to get those sweet altruism points no one is working on our get away. Congrats OP they got what they deserve.
---
It’s a method of playing killer. It’s sometimes optimal on Huntress, depending on add-ons/Perks.
---
Slugging is where you down all of the team in the dying state and make it harder for them to be able to heal them, and there are perks that aid with this, such as knock out (have to be within a certain range to see them), sloppy butcher (slower heals), coulrophobia (even slower heals), deerstalker (you can see where the downed survivors are at within certain range), BBQ and Chili (seeking out survivors), and so on.
---
The main point is to end the game quickly and have everyone die on first hook. You will be called an asshole for playing like this, as you can see from the photo above. 
---
No one wants to imagine that.
---
You down a survivor and let them bleed out
---
Every perk that does something usefull will be considered crutch by someone. Once a survibor told me that stridor was a crutch perk and a killer told me that prove thyself (before buff) was a crutch even tho I was only using it for adept
---
clown with hag traps so he just springs out of the ground 
---
He's always been weaker than legion. When a new killer is being tested and just recently comes out, people like to overexaggerate a lot, he was never weaker than freddy. There are arguments to be made that he is better than the likes of wraith, trapper, pig etc.
---
I think you mean it isn’t a valid strategy for blood points. Clearly it is valid strategy since every game you camped you were able to get some sort of victory. And your blood point gains are technically weaker because insta downs hardly reward chases. Killers keep camping and don’t let a survivor tell you you’re wrong. Survivors work a fucking gen and stop complaining. If your friend is being camped work a gen, if you’re being camped, throw up the campers signal and let your fellow team get gens done.
---
I think what you're forgetting is that a lot of killers don't care about BP; they care about killing.
---
That's not audio though
---
I can deal with flashlights, but tossing yourselves like that at me. Come on.
---
Somehow the still image is 20x funnier
---
The funny part is they destroyed my Huntress lullaby almost immediately. And then they are salty I slug them because they are all within immediate vicinity.
---
I wouldve hit that 360 as killer, he just hits foward
---
There are always exceptions. If it's a 3 v 1, I dont blame people for not wanting to waste time. I also dont blame them for leaving when the killer has retarded add-ons that make the game completely unfun (like huntress 1 hit hachets). People need to focus less on people DCing, and start focusing on why they DC, because the problem will always just have a bandaid solution otherwise.
---
I already do all of that, trust me (except the enduring/sf, didnt know it was THAT important, I eat a lot of pallets anyways). 
---
I tend to give up on certain chases when I know for a fact that I'll loose too much time, like an obsession taking you straight into the mine, away from every gen. I don't know if this is a terrible idea, but i feel it is smarter to dont waste time on chases you can't win.
---
Where else do you think the Entity stores it’s cheese? 
---
MYERS BECAUSE HIS P3 IS LITERALLY THE BEST LOOKING OUT OF ANY OTHER KILLER
---
also he's licensed and doesn't have any store cosmetics
---
Not in relation with this postchat but why are your perks so colourful? 
---
I unhook survivor, tell them to follow me for heals.. they go the opposite way and run into the killer..... 
---
tape? doesn't it get in the way? i used a pencil mark
---
Yeah that’s why he thanked me he knows that camping at the end is securing a kill and it’s okay so he’s happy I didn’t even though I should have probably done so
---
Not going to lie... I want to see the fight lol
---
I’m on PS4 so I don’t have the end game chat and I don’t usually care enough to have to say anything to them. But last night I played a match against legion where I was the only one who finished a gen, saved the hooked person and got a gen to 95% just to get chased and hooked. All 3 other survivors were crouched around, not doing gens, going slowly towards me but no one actually getting me... not even finishing my gen.  
---
Now that’s a chat I would want to have with them. 
---
This was a rank 1-2 match. 
---
Yeah, I'm trying to do the same, but it's so hard man.. I mean those sweet extra bloodpoints 
---
Yeah and it got destroyed in the first couple seconds 
---
That's another way to look at it. Still, even if you didn't use one of the top 3 killers, playing with Ruin would be much easier for you-IDK if you ever ran it, but there is a noticeable difference.
---
Myers with NOED is more effective than you’d think, party because you never expect it even from someone’s who’s been playing poorly, even nurse or billy are infamous for being godly with NOED so it’s not a crazy big surprise when it happens, but Myers? You’d never think. 
---
There are so many better perks to run on Myers, but 119 movement speed, a 16m (or 8m with MA) terror radius, and the element of surprise is what makes it surprisingly effective. Doesn’t change the fact that I have no clue why you’d do it, but there are beneficiaries to it.
---
I didn't know tbagging is an important part of helping the teammates escape
---
Doen't they fix the glitch with 2.5?
---
It seems to be very small or region locked, midwest player here and red ranks is more or less the same 50 people.
---
My point being that not every file you modify will get you banned
---
I did some favors for the devs😉.
---
In all seriousness, changes the cosmetic game files. Haven’t found any colored offerings (besides bps). You can download the files (somewhere in the sub) and replace it on your PC. Did the same thing with survivor and killer portraits too. If you need help I can guide you though it, just shoot me a PM.
---
well that was already clarified 
---
Big black dude helping little asian school girl with her *homework* . I have a bad feeling about where this is going.
---
Not necessarily. You down all of them and then hook all of them. Letting them bleed out is a waste of time. You may as well have them die on hook.
---
Thx for your reply. Sadly I’m on console so no colourful fun for me.
---
I love the drawing, but what makes people think of this
---
have you ever considered looking at a wall? baiting hits on the flash people you know that are coming?
---
Rip dude. Yeah, you could do it on console but I highly do not recommend. It takes way too much effort and it isn’t worth it. Get a PC tho👀
---
Stop it, get some help
---
Make the Bloodpoint gain from BBQ and Chili baseline for every killer. Make WGLF baseline for every survivor, and completely rework the perk.
---
Trapper can hold two traps minimum now. Also make traps darker by default.
---
Actually make Windstorm a part of Wraith's kit, instead of nerfing the reappearance speed like they did, basically making the change meaningless.
---
Leatherface needs a sound cue or a visual indicator when his chainsaw is fully charged, at least make the progress bar a different color.
---
Let Shape get Bloodlust in EW1 again.
---
Combine Doctor's two modes into one, M2 will Shock and M1 will hit. His addons will obviously have to be re-tuned as a result.
---
Completely rework Freddy and Legion. The only reason I say that is because i honestly cannot fathom a way to buff either of them without them being OP as fuck.
---
Hexes: Hexes are a huge issue because there is a great chance they get found immediately and then they are worth nothing. One thing that NEEDS to happen is they need to stop spawning near Gens and Survivors, and if that happens it might be enough of a buff, but if not they could try making it so that Totems do not light up until a certain point in the match, or make it so that they do not light up at all, only the killer knows which totems are the good ones.
---
Completely rework Self-care.
---
Change D-strike to only work if you are the obsession, and make it so that it will not make you the obsession, meaning you need to either run a second perk to get it or win the gamble that killer might be running an obsession perk.
---
No more I-frames on Dead Hard.
---
I was thinking of the other mirror for a second while writing that lol
---
Yeah that’s what I figured lol, too bad that one kinda sucks since the range on it is so short
---
Immersed
---
Quit flexing.
---
New meaning to the term "bleeding out"
---
Muses come from anywhere. 
---
I know that it is a waste of time, I've just explained what it is
---
Fair... Everybody likes cheese
---
meh I like being chased and wasting the killers time
---
Survivor mains are getting out of hand
---
Like, totes
---
I have been actually taking it off a lot of my killers over the last month or so due to higher ranks knowing (and using) the counters. Some games I'll play the entire match and see only 1 person with it. 
---
Even in that case, camping is still not the better option since it can get you max 2kills if the survivors know how to play and do gens while the killer is camping.
---
Otherwise, if you know how to play the game, you will almost always get 2 kills even at high ranks and if you master the nurse/billy or hag you can get 4k easily.
---
mean, but funny
---
1) Most of the time I get yelled at for Camping it's because the doors were already opened and I wanted that kill. Very few people will say that you should grab one person and just sit at the hook all game.
---
2) Everyone knows that Insidious Leatherface won't get you many bloodpoints. It's a "meme" build for a reason, and having Hex: Ruin doesn't mean anything if you're not trying to protect the Hex Totem.
---
3) Not everyone cares about blood point gains.
---
Ruin.
---
Ruin and breaking off chases early to bully the gens is all you can do.
---
And now that is all I see when I look at this, thank you stranger 
---
I KILLED 3 PEOPLE AT A GENERATOR, AS CANNIBAL, THEY WERE ANGRIER THAN ME HAHSHHA
---
I understand. I run BBQ for the points, even if there was no aura ability attached to it, I'd still run it on all my killers.
---
She likes the way his hair tickles her.  
---
~~^^^Please ignore ^^^the ^^^fact ^^^that ^^^he ^^^doesn't ^^^have ^^^hair.~~
---
I was wondering if it was about the blood splatting out or the Meg farming.
---
I wonder if reboot Freddy has souls and faces all over his chest like Englund Freddy does.
---
Adam being a good teacher he is, helping her ace her studies despite being a murderous haunted japanese spirit? :)
---
Looking at a wall requires a wall. 
---
If the whole party is there, I better be playing a killer with an instadown, otherwise they are either gonna get the person on the ground healed, or they are gonna end up getting the flashlight save anyway.
---
And if I *do* play a killer with an instadown? Looks like everyone's getting slugged.
---
[i] whack
---
Honestly, I played a fair kit. Uncommon items. But I will say this.. 
---
People underestimate the inability to see scratches during frenzy. I was juked more than once by a decently skilled Meg. 
---
Frenzy is wonderfully powerful,  but that stun is nearly as bad as Nurse.  Additionally, without running stab study, you've gotta land four hits to put someone on the ground. 
---
Immediately following my Legion game, I 4K'd with Clown (with literally no items or perks.. Huntress experience paid off, here, because I was quite accurate with bottles) - followed by my first ever Spirit game (a ridiculously easy 4K, and Spirit is STRONG) and had a 3K with Doc because I gave the last survivor the hatch. 
---
..I just don't see Legion as an overwhelming threat, having now played against him and as him. 
---
I’d really only say it’s a little sus if they’re running ruin and NOED, but then again that’s like saying if you run DS, Dead hard, and adrenaline you’re basically telling the killer you’re toxic. 
---
Just using perks isn’t really toxic even if the killer has a built in instadown
---
Oh, nice. I redact my comment then. 
---
WAIT FOR IT TO COME UP IN YOUR BLOODWEB
---
I'm just pointing out that a lot of the people who camp aren't camping for BP gains. They're either doing it because they're angry, being rewarded for it by swarming survivors, or they're ass at the game.
---
The main reason I main leatherface now is anytime some lil shits get uppity with me like that i can just Jenga them.
---
hmm, that's actually not a bad idea. Maybe when I get good enough I can run higher ranks and only use it for points but for now I need any advantage I can get. 
---
I used the one that made the tank look like Shrek,music and all.
---
What is the playstyle that the community figured out? I've been struggling to get any kills with him
---
Can you draw another one with Adam and his big black do ger in her? 
---
what can i tell you? if you enter a killer game worrying about possible points you are giving the survivors, you already lost. at least at high ranks, i wouldnt know how it it elsewhere. but rank 1 killers , worry about other stuff. when i play killer i will happily give survivors 1k points to be able to destroy a pallet thats a win in any killers book, a pallet destroyed it's a part of the map when a chase is a garanteed down. but then again i never played any killer that deviates from normal dbd gameplay like legion or nurse and never will tbh
---
I like Monto a lot and already tried some perk builds, and even though most are really situational, I find that I cant play certain killers without trying dumb fun builds, so.. you could say perk builds are the only reason I play killer at all now.
---
In regards to the pip/emblems, I must admit I find it hard to understand, and that probably is the reason I struggle to "climb". I know what each category means, but when I'm in game, I never get to milk every point. I tend to play with a plan, go either aggresive or defensive depending on the situation, NEVER tunnel unless the gates are about to open and I need to take someone out of the game and try to always be busy and not running around in circles like a Metal Gear soldier. But I see how not knowing how to fill out each individual category can be a problem when you get iridescent X but bronze Y and Z.
---
As for the kills.. i don't like to be a tryhard, but in my head, in dbd as a killer you have to kill, and I feel that I fail when I don't get kills regardless of hooks and emblems. You can say it's more of a personal matter.
---
I love how my comments are getting downvotes.
---
I don’t understand why survivor mains get pissed for being in immediate proximity with each other to get these saves. Once that Feng missed her DS, they all just DC. Then call me bad for exploiting their flaws.
---
Thanks! I will!
---
Turn the chat off.
---
So the only time I DC as a killer is in a hatch standoff that goes on too long. Any other time, I can deal with the bullshit.
---
I'm not gonna waste my time because you wanna wait half an hour to get 2500 BP, and I'm definitely not gonna be nice if you are willing to sit in a standoff, so the plug gets pulled and you lose your points.
---
O ok I misread what you were saying. So if you don’t get the fuses the gate takes longer but if you get them all in the fuse box before the gates are powered the gates are just like they are now. 
---
I definitely could get behind that and you’re right killers running noed would make you want to get the fuses in there before the gens are done. I was just thinking you meant once the gates are powered then you have to look for the fuses lol 
---
don't spend them all at once 
---
A good teacher helping a student regardless of race (and creature)? \^\^
---
Who gives A dam, she's probably just going through a phase.
---
Doesn't bother me. Free de-pips and not having to waste my time with them.
---
Way more worserer
---
A part of me wants to say this is a coordinated effort to shift the meta more in survivor's favor by peer-pressuring the killers into playing how they want, but I know better, they are just salty idiots who are jealous of my delicious pips and BP.
---
Or the Decisive not working
---
Well, camping still is a valid strategy imo, but not this kind of camping. If there are survivors near the hook not doing gens, why would I leave? If the hooked survivor is near the last 3/4 generators, why would I leave? The kind of camping where you patrol an area where there are survivors is a valid strategy. Also, this wasn't a real experiment as there were different kinds of survivors, maps and perks the survivors used. 
---
:/
---
This is great. My OCD gets a bit triggered by the color fill of Adam's coat not being aligned with the lines.
---
COOL
---
Very cool!
---
Aw glad you do! Hope you'll enjoy some more of my random DbD drawings in the future ^^
---
We need text chat on ps4 
---
Slugging trash 
---
Oh shut up you piss poor survivor main.
---
Not survivor mains getting mad it’s the killer mains that are when trash like you play the killer and make the rest of us look bad 
---
I play on both sides. More so, I don’t play like this on a regular basis. Stop being a piss poor little bitch and grow the fuck up.
---
Watchumean chief?
---
Forgot to mention you’re probably a piss poor killer, who has to slug to win
---
I love this &lt;3
---
Read my next comment you scumbag I’m a killer main 
---
The slugging salt is real.. 
---
When Freddy was released there was a terrible flashlight bug that caused instablinds and it was rampantly abused..  So, I started playing my Leatherface with a Franklin's Demise modified slugging build. I STILL got trash talked post-game 90% of the time - by people who were knowingly exploiting a bug. 
---
But fuck me, right? If you're stupid enough to two or three man rush to save a hooked survivor, and incapable of body blocking effectively,  you get what you get. 
---
The video clearly shows face-camping.
---
If any of the A,B or E scenarios, you mentioned in your post, is true, then I yeah there is no problem going around the hook for 10-15 seconds searching for survivors nearby. 
---
C and D are up to the killer but an overly toxic survivor shouldn’t complain about getting camped.
---
That's why you introduce a repoet system.i don't know is so bad that i can't play with a friend..
---
Evolve worked with the system i don't know why this wouldn't. Not everyone is toxic
---
I’m the piss poor little bitch? You’re the dumbass that played like that and now are bragging about it. That’s like hacking then bragging about how good you are. You don’t brag about something that makes you look like an idiot 
---
I don't know how, it'd be up to the devs to buff them up enough to be more useful. I play killer often, and I want more killers to be viable options so I can play them and not get destroyed by good survivors. I want more viable options when it comes to playing killee, that's all
---
Lmao look in the comments. Some kid is trash talking.
---
Wisconsin is famous for their cheese.
---
Wisconsin is famous for their cheese, sorry forgot to reply.
---
wut
---
It gets even worse when you have people tunneling one survivor then moonwalking them as they bleed wound from the wound and then you get a free hit. The fun y thing that what you mentioned isn't the only problem with legion its just one of many. 
---
not every game sometimes you get 3 to and rarely 1
---
I've always been curious if there was a connection between Adam and Rin.  There has to be a reason why Adam decided to go into an abandoned house at night.  
---
If all the survivors are right up your ass, you’re telling me that you wouldn’t slug them to get the game over with since they are all right there. I also am not allowed to exploit the flaws they have as a team. K.
---
I played lots of surgeon simulator, don’t worry, you’re in good hands!
---
I main quentin because he looks like a stoner :)
---
Source: am stoner
---
What's the original comic?
---
Why this reminds me of the cinematic with Trapper? XD
---
Well that's adorable
---
You need a better booty dance it seems.
---
Idk, ask behavior bud.
---
I can see why you would put him at tier D with base power and perks. However, with cold dirt and frank’s mixtape he is easily B or A... the ability to three hit survivors when you have unrelenting 9000 and are super fast prevents looping. Just my thoughs tho
---
The counter to legion is leaving and mlga blocking them
---
Yeah I know, but I don't like to gamble 😂
---
I play both survivor and killer and I don't see why the killer shouldn't go after you once you get off the hook. You're already injured, are leaving bloodtrails and probably loud injured noises as well. It sucks big balls to be on the receiving end of that treatment, but the killer is simply going for the easier target if everyone else is healthy.
---
I'd personally would do it too, **however** if I hit the healthy guy while he's unhooking someone and they become injured, I'll go after them because I know how much it sucks for one person to be tunneled to death immediately, I have had that happen to me many times. In those cases, I'll try to let the injured guy have a chance too instead of dying with 3k points.
---
tl;dr - killer isn't obligated to make your game fun or fair, they have their own objective just like survivors have theirs, and injured, already hooked survivors are usually an easier target
---
Man that icon for unbreakable is so different to the one on pc, it really weird.
---
I mean, I get frustrated too, when this happens, but you are playing SWF and I'm pretty sure you can manage to clean 5 totems. 
---
I appreciate your critique, but this is just my style! Thank you anyway! :)
---
1) this is a shitpost, hence the flair
---
2) you can 4K with anyone, including Freddy, doesn’t mean they’re good. Bubba sucks. 
---
Daaaaamn that's really cool lol nice
---
I dont think PC is better nor do I think console is better, just a joke my friend. 
---
I don't think that they should interfere. No gameplay method should be forced on the players. If they want to camp, let them camp and be punished for that (low bloodpoints, survivors escaping easily) but don't make it so that camping becomes almost impossible.  
---
First off, it would make Insidious an invalid useless perk.   
---
Secondly, there was already a countermeasure for camping in the form of Borrowed Time, and the early version of the perk was gamebreaking. They've actually had to nerf it because BT after the gates were open = free escape and immunity for both the unhooker and the unhookee in 99% of the cases.
---
Cleanse the totem, of the killer has no ed and someone is hooked, you never save them until the totem is broken, and must learn when you can or cannot save your friend. No ed and decisive are not op, they are just annoying.
---
Fake and gay
---
This is so cute! I love them!
---
"  the genrush is real  "
---
"  This perk rewards bad play  "
---
You are right, it rewarded the killer for you \[4 players\] not cleansing 5 totems that don't even require a skill check. 
---
NOED is available as a base perk from the bloodweb and you still ignored totems and were having too much fun looping the killer and gen rushing. 
---
Base kindred (only seeing the killer if he's in the proximity ofc, not all survivors) and slower entity progression for the hooked guy if he's getting camped.
---
Inb4 Spirit x Adam hentai
---
"I was allowed to use all of my second chances, I'm so proud of using all my crutches!" 
---
I wouldn't contest that second hit at all. I was still in disbelief from the first hit
---
So dreamy 
---
And the fair play 4k is 54k BP. Your point?
---
New Freddy Buff, he is invisible in the Dream World too
---
I agree with that. They aren’t supposed to make it fun. But ATLEAST give the injured guy a chance. At low ranks (and I hate doing this) I HAVE to equip DS to have a chance at not getting camped and not being able to pip.
---
I agree it should not be in the game, but your comparisons to LoL and CSGO are no where close to how NOED works. In league it’s like getting a free team wipe as they are about to kill your nexus. In CSGO it’s more akin to a button that auto kills 1 enemy after the bomb has been planted. 
---
NOED is there for noobs and shit tier killers like Freddy as you mention. But the reason people give trapper a pass is that his power does not directly help in a chase like Billys chainsaw or huntresses hatchets. Playing trapper as you know requires you to put traps down beforehand which wastes large amounts of time at the beginning of the match, as other killers are able to apply pressure immediately.
---
But it is still just a crutch perk, and probably gives the devs a excuse to NOT REWORK FREDDY YET LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD. Because Freddy gets kills with this one perk...
---
I feel the same. My game-play style is awful against killers I can't see, esp Freddy. I get boned by him every time.   
---
The only time I don't is when I spawn with a teammate that likes to do gens. 
---
all hail our lord and savior, ace
---
That's what I did ty
---
It does not lock through objects, his power has a linear hitbox that must touch the survivor to pull them into the dream transition.
---
If one guy is coming for the save and then runs away when you see him and you still refuse to go after him only to go back to the hooked guy, then yes, this is camping.
---
yeah
---
Saved him many times, but buy the  end, he was going to bleed and was saved by killer
---
I’ll throw a pebble back.
---
Nah. Just because something requires skill doesn’t mean it’s not busted. Nurse ignores the fundamentals of the game. And you can’t be immersed if the nurse is doing what she’s supposed to: patrolling gens, and taking into account which ones are being worked on. Also there’s a thing called whispers/stridor. She may not be a problem for you at purple ranks or on console, but pc red ranks it’s a real issue.
---
It was your internet fam.Probably a big spike.A dead guy who is not in the game cannot disconnect.You probably had a problem with the internet at that moment.
---
Mods changed that rule forever ago
---
You got 20 games in an evening? Damn, me and my squad get 1 game every 25mins (ps4). I'd take NOED every game just to get matches. 
---
Eyy adam is my main, he’s the best survivor (ik they’re all just different skins) 
---
It’s still a meme though lol. People will still put it up
---
yes, posts on here do get upvotes!
---
Give it another week, you'll see it again too.
---
Yeah there are definitefly better perks, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it never worth the slot. 
---
What I like to do is to play wraith with the sloppy add-on, thanatophobia and nurse calling. I do it, not because I think it's the best build, but because I have incredibly bad eyes and suck huge dick at tracking as a result. Thanato 
---
Because you always down a survivor right by a wall you can look at amirite
---
This is especially poor advice on maps like Disturbed Ward
---
that doesn't mean its a good thing.
---
Remember, if you’re in the same plane of existence as the survivors it’s camping ^-^
---
Chungus was the guy who gave me 2/3 traps for my daily ! What a guy 
---
That's not what I am saying.... I was saying about that times when all 3 SWFs that aren't hooked just runs in front of you and bodyblocks each other.
---
And that's the difference between nurse and legion but enough of that, we've talked about it to much and IDC anymore, only slightly lol. But that's great I wish our community was more welcoming but still competitive like this, it sucks how many games now in days are filled with toxic communitys
---
That's the thing. Game told me I still had the coins. I purchased the outfit with those coins. Gane apparently defaulted to cells since I didn't actually have the coins. 
---
i was saying that cause the image is cropped in a way that no words are visible
---
Hands down the best Spirit fan art I've seen in this subreddit. She looks so cute! I'd surely guild it if I could :)
---
He looks to be around \~110kg with all those muscles.
---
Sigh.
---
*Unzips pants*
---
Haha, I just noticed that. Whoops. 
---
AND THEYRE NOT EVEN LIVE... Ahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahaa kek
---
That was the same way I read it....that you had to look for the fuses after the gens were done. In other words, a massive NOED buff lol!
---
What a piece of shit. 
---
As an oink main the one thing I want is for people to not be able to escape through the hatch with a key. If they're the last person and hatch is open, that's fine. But someone escaping with a trap on their head because they're SWF and have a key is bs
---
You are not wrong
---
r/aww
---
Because it still is very powerful? 25% progression is nothing to joke about. 
---
Not a change to a perk, item, or killer, but to some maps.  I'd change the jungle gym walls on the Thompson Farm maps to not be see through.  There is already plenty of corn and pallets to loop or lose the killer on those maps, no real reason to take away the mind games with those see through walls.
---
Gay? Maybe. Fake? Nah
---
Botany knowledge.
---
For Freddy, reduce the base amount of time it takes to transition to dream world, make it so he appears less during the transition, and remove the ability to break out of the dream world with healing and add the ability to break out with sabo
---
Omg I love it
---
it's ok 
---
Even if some killers are better than others, all Killers are playable at all levels, assuming that you have any idea how to play them. You can play Freddy and do well, even at red ranked games.
---
while I like some of the ideas, all of them are way too ambitious and are trying to add things that would completely break what the game is all about
---
ex: survivor perk "give it your all" is just no mither with a stun ability that is worse than flashlights
---
the gunslinger seems like a broken mix between the huntress and the clown
---
"hope harvest" with the subpowers and the gears and the inventory system is just so much going on on one map it would break the entire idea of the game
---
"the crawler" seems worse than freddy, and hiding in lockers would become way more effective
---
"the facade" has too many abilities (most of them are just ability-versions of perks)
---
so as much as i want to like someones ideas for a game they like, i think you've really misunderstood the direction the game is in and is going
---
“Max two kills” buddy literally got 3ks and 4ks. And last I checked 2 kills is still a win according to the entity. I’m not defending camping, but flaming people for what they enjoy isn’t right. If they want easy kills and low blood points, that’s entirely up to them
---
THIS IS SO BADASS!!!!
---
More pics can be found \[here\]([http://highlanderfx.com/portfolio/](http://highlanderfx.com/portfolio/)).
---
I play solo so it was a struggle being with dcs and the tunneling of killers. 
---
What ever happened to that game in the bottom left ?
---
Fuck, is that what it is now? I need to catch up. I’m still on patch 1.4.0
---
THANKS FOR EDUCATING ME, AND YES, THEY WERE REPORTED ON STEAM. 
---
if you think Legion is the worst thing this game has seen you have not played for very long, or at least, haven't played killer for very long.
---
We should be getting a ptb near the end of this month so we should start seeing more teases soon.
---
that case out wrong, I healed him off the ground 4 times. After he was hit about the 5th time, he was about to bleed, he was then picked up and wiggles out and used self care. No there wasn’t 3 people. We had 2 gens uncomplicated and I did all 3 w/ some of the others before they died
---
Slay on
---
May your blinks be many and accurate soon
---
You’re insisting that I play like this on a regular basis. I don’t. And the only counter to flashlight swf squads is slugging. Not to mention, I have the Feng a fair chance to hit her DS to save the game. She missed, everyone dc’d. gg ez.

&gt; Change D-strike to only work if you are the obsession, and make it so that it will not make you the obsession, meaning you need to either run a second perk to get it or win the gamble that killer might be running an obsession perk.
---
All your other ideas are good, but d00d this one is bonkers lol
---
15% im pretty sure.. its nothing
---
No it hasn't,the puns will bolster our spirit
---
I'll never understand the people who like to stroke it with the palm facing away from them and the back of hand towards them. 
---
Oh, wait, isn't this what we're talking about? 
---
Nah it’s been this way since infinites “were taken” out of the game @mattwalker window
---
Well that's karma 
---
Ok, let them have easy kills and low blood points.
---
But what about the survivor, whose game is ruined? Hw has to literally sit through 80 seconds of doing nothing but pressing the space bar and if he DCs he depips and his team is at a disadvantage.
---
Deathgarden is getting a lot of changes, but it’s still a dead game. 
---
Goodest boye brave fear
---
Nah, that's not happening. 💁🏻‍♀️
---
When you're the killer and didn't bother with an SSD
---
Nobody really camps like this, most survivors that complain about camping are when they are looping the killer around a pallet 10ft away from a hooked survivor.
---
If you hit both skillckecks it is 25% or 20sec on a gen. Time is essential in this game. 
---
Indeed, no gameplay method should be forced upon the players. But face-camping( as seen in the video) is just holding the game hostage. The survivor on the hook can’t do anything and as to sit through 80 seconds of nothing. If he DCs, he depips and his teammates are at a disadvantage. 
---
Cheese
---
Damn, they really showed you, with the four person quitter bonus.
---
So each dull totem would apply, what maybe a 2.5-3% (12.5-15% total) nerf to healing, sabotage, cleansing, and searching? Wouldn't that make thanatophobia kind of pointless?
---
Actually, you shouldn't even walk as any killer. Go stuck in a pallet or something
---
Heavily implied the company Rin's father worked for (the one with the 'faulty production line' that fired him for their mistakes) is the cause of the train crash through defective rails produced by them.
---
He was actually an afk killer, we were farming him and then he just started running at us lol
---
Thanatophobia is already pretty pointless as it's pretty bad. Maybe not for healing and sabotaging but mainly just repair speed to help against games ending super fast.
---
lol that happened to me last night
---
I'M FRUSTRATED THAT MY SUPPORT TICKET HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED IN OVER A MONTH.
---
Idk. The entire mode would need testing to make it fair and fun. Probably about 6, and bigger maps. 
---
Wow! fantastic work! 
---

---
The point is, if you assume that 10% of all players of the playerbase are toxic.. then you're gonna have a single toxic killer every 10 game.
---
But a killer will have a toxic survivor every 3rd game. So they'll suffer the toxicity "sooner" than a survivor would. 
---

HAHHHHHHHHHH 
---
WAHHHHHHHHHH
---
whoosh 
---
HOAHHHHHHHHH 
---
Eeeeeeeeeeee
---
To be fair, the teams they have doing cosmetics and the teams they have doing balance are different. I have a lot of problems with their design philosophy, but I do think that the devs genuinely care about the game.
---
Nice Ranger helmet.
---
That was actually wholesome, including the thank you crouches. &lt;3
---
That doesn't change the fact that if survivors want camping to go away, then they need to start punishing campers instead of rewarding them. You don't stop a dog from biting by feeding it treats when it bites.
---
I'm a meddling and mischievous god. I always make sure the ones that are wrong know they are wrong.
---
Sometimes I am baffled by how little game awareness survivors have. I've been in situations where I figure out in like 20 seconds that this survivor knows the map so well that it's a waste of time trying to hook him, and every time I see him after that he's running from the gen he was working to the nearest good loop - yet in end game chat people are complaining he didn't do anything. wot? I think part of it is that 2 or 3 of them are on comms but are too dull to keep good track of gen progress, so they think they've "done everything" and then complain at the randoms when they die.
---
Other survivors will actually seem confused or mad that their team made the correct play - like escaping instead of going back to save him from leatherface in basement.
---
Lol yea I was thinking people complain about noed now when really you only have to deal with it for a minute or so if you get the doors open quick, the reddit would explode if you had a second objective to do after gens with a noed killer on you the whole time
---
Agree with OP and with you. The numbers would be interesting to see for certain builds, yet instead of doing that (which seems very easy) they just give us new skins that don't effect gameplay. 
---
11/10 drawing 
---
Nurse here. Just don’t teleport then you are balanced :)
---
Well, that’s why I don’t play survivor anymore and this mindset of yours does nothing to fix this shitty problem. It’s easy to say “just deal with it” but in reality the problem goes much deeper than that. The devs are aware of the enormous amount of bugs, unfair game mechanics, etc. and unless we stand up against that, most problems are going to take months to solve as the sloppy butcher one.
---
Every time a lingering survivor dies, a baby entity gets its wings. &lt;3
---
Aye aye aye, to be *fair, the “t” was right next to the “r” lol
---
With context, my friend led the killer around for about 4 gens and my only interaction was a 5 second stare down when I tried to rescue them from the hook and they chased me off. 
---
I like the idea but then every other killer will have to have some sort of “custom” terror radius
---
My record is 7 in a row. I really want to hit double digits haha
---
Don't be like Icarus and fly too close to the sun 
---
Impressive. You have transcended beyond me good sir
---
From the Killer perspective, it's more like.. 
---
**Picks up Survivor** Behold! 
---
*Pow-ptow-bang-bang-boomy-boom* 
---
**Empty Handed** Now Behold! 
---
Had one match where every single chest I looted was fireworks. I mean I like stocking up on the things and they're useful, but dang. 
---
Lol. Funny when the killer actually plays smart and gets shit for it. I have always played this game solo and I truly feel like it has made me humble in this game. I respect all game styles. If you wanna hook me and stare at me, fine, I will waste as much of your time as possible. You always move on to a new trial after and it is ultimately no big deal what happens. These guys were just buttmad that they didnt get to use their little fire crackers.
---
Why is the TV on the right crooked? 
---
Stands messed up 
---
I had a legion daily to apply deep wounds 4 times.
---
I brought an ebony mori.
---
I just spammed the animation on them a few times to assert dominance. None of them T-posed back so I believe I won.
---
I let them all go except the poor dwight who off'ed himself in the basement
---
This is really really well done. Have my medkit... I mean upvote 
---
This was satisfying
---
That's the point.
---
you'll get him all the way to prestige 3 from level 50 moments before the game dies?
---
I hate getting camped. More so, if I do get camped, just do gens for fucks sake.
---
When I’m wraith and I actually pull someone off the gen on 99% because surv wanted to finish it:
---
WE’LL BE RIGHT BACK.
---
I see more people saying he’s BS or OP  than saying legion sucks. 
---
Don’t even engage - just LOL harder, eventually culminating in the ROFLCOPTER. They may die of brain aneurysms due to rage, so, you know, cover your tracks
---
Why are ur perks like that
---
I love the new art of this killer. Can’t wait to play against 
---
*He is gonna teach her everything he knows*
---
They didn’t stop struggling, the timer ran out my dude
---
Mate sorry to be this guy but if you were in a three man survive with friends and you didn't destroy all the totems that's your own fault that you got destroyed noed especially if you encountered it multiple times.
---
Normally if I'm doing a survive with friends run the second we  encountered noed once every other match we focus on destroying totend just in case.
---
I have had this happen once, I couldn't believe it, decided my killer was Helen Keller
---
Agreed, I don't know how this is even an issue when you can either grow a thick skin or turn off chat.
---
Maybe I'm older than the average DbD player but I don't understand all these complaints about post game "toxicity".
---
Totally agree, I really think the issue for a lot of killers is that if they don't get at least a couple of kills, in their mind they lost the match no matter what. Despite the amount of points, it doesn't feel like a good game to them. Wonder what the pip differences were as well, I'm sure much worse overall compared to normal gameplay.
---
Forgive me but I too am a babby Huntress. I started a few weeks ago and have played almost nothing but Huntress. I actually just got to 50 and have used no addons or just some of the lowest-tier ones on my grind to 50. I have no true wisdoms for you, but Whispers is definitely excellent. 
---
Personally, I have no teachable perks from other killers. So for my first 50 levels I’ve had Whispers and Sloppy Butcher on since getting them.
---
I have used Lullaby, which I like, but gets broken quickly and makes me sad. I have also used Bitter Murmur, but find it a moot point as I learn to track preferred gens and survivors last known areas with Whispers. I have also used Unrelenting, because more smacks!
---
At 50 I’m using Distressing and Beast of Prey to grind BP before prestige, and I like to think Distressing helps pressure them to move away from me and make my Whispers-tracking more useful. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
In some of my Legion games, survivors aren't even running away, just standing next to the gen I found them near of
---
That doesn't justify that she is still OP and totally removes a key element of game-play.
---
At least with Legion, you can loop him.  
---
Basic game theory states that you cannot balance around skill. Its not a problem in lower ranks but at the red ranks, nearly every nurse is good enough to make any choices as a survivor pointless. That's not fun as I have little input on how my game is played. 
---
Red ranks do it often too. They’re all just weak. 
---
r/dbdgonewild 
---
How diluted can you get? My mindset isn’t here to fix someone’s play style, it’s here to not be upset when someone camps me on first hook. And who the hell is talking about bugs? We’re talking about the viability of camping. “Take a stand” this isn’t Tiananmen Square, if you’re so upset by this game play something else. The developers don’t owe you or anyone anything, they already have your money. They could shut this game down tomorrow and take it away from you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. You die on first hook move on and play a little more immersed. The fact that so many people get butt hurt about this shit baffles my mind
---
I see people saying everything. His design sucks, he's impossible to get away from, he farts magic dust that instantly downs every survivor. 
---
I disagree. Aesthetically, Legion looks great,  if a bit edgy. Mechanics are a near miss. Frank's Tape is a bit too powerful,  and I honestly think it deserves ultra rare status. Additionally, the look down or moonwalk is garbo. 
---
That said, I think it has potential to be more fun. 
---
I think I saw FunGoose do 21 in a row on stream.  Was insane.  
---
People shouldn't play killer with such bullshit internet
---
I'm the same as you, OP. I absolutely love their look. I bought the game when his chapter came out, and I bought all the DLC for the game, and out of all the killers, he looked coolest to me. Especially the Joey variant! 
---
*ranks back down
---
It's pretty hecking strong yes. I think it should come with some downsides like slower movement speed or something in tier III. A lot of killer addons could use some fine tuning to make them more balanced.
---
Haha.. Uhh.. Are you trolling? Trapper has exactly that addon. 
---
I'll put in an edit, but I was on black swamp and I play on console. There was some lag.
---
Edited the game files. Can’t do this on console.
---
So addons can’t be better than one another? Trapper has always been a lower tier killer and so have his addons.
---
The point I was trying to make was that another can rescue them and make the entire add-on useless.
---
Agreed, if you wanna genrush and you're that great then you can play the hotel game. Also, if they get the first NOED hit, go find the totem, destroy it, save and then protect. Still an easy win. Personally I don't play it but I imagine it is satisfying when a SWF is teabagging after a genrush  
---
Im on pc

the trapper does have a addon like that 
---
I get confused there myself. But I'm sure high rank is 1-8 and the rest is low rank

---
It’s a whole process. You have to download the files (somewhere in this sub) and replace it with the ones already there. I replaced my character portraits too.
---
Thank you! I'm not trying to say take it out of the game, but I might have come off that way. If it was nerfed, I'd be fine with that.
---
Ahh, thanks.
---
I’ll DC in a heartbeat if it means allowing one of my friends to get the hatch after being slugged. It’s definitely a trade off, but after playing for so long, you don’t care about the BP or pipping. I’d rather we get one survivor out than all die. It’s an us vs killer mentality so if one of us gets out, we all win. Just how I look at it. 
---
I suppose if the killer wanted points for my death, he would have just hooked me in the first place. 
---
I have a very strong feeling that all of them (or most) have escaped. If they had all died then they would probably not say anything nice. That's just how it is with most survivor players.
---
There are some who actually are nice , but those are rare.
---
Edit: Honing Stone downs upon escape. My bad. But it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't. I mean, sure, by all means.. Don't escape. I'm fine with that. 
---
They just came too soon since xmas fireworks. DBD devs need to add more goofy fun items for these events.
---
You lose all the points you earned during that match and you lose two pips. Same as when a killer DC’s. 
---
Feel more concerned for your teammate whose running Wake Up lmao xD
---
So what? A pc can lag too. Just play the damn game it plays fine 
---
Anywhere from rank 10-1 has relatively similar players as this game has been out for 2 years, the only place you actually find new players are ranks 20-15ish after which anyone could be smurfing, or just screwing around to be "mid/low" rank. Rank tells you how long someone has played for the current "season" before their ranks gets reset, not how good they are.
---
[Too late] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdgonewild/comments/9ddepn/spirit_x_adam_by_dirtyplaster). (NSFW)
---
Yeah, I know that. When I was a rank 15, I was once matched with a rank 5.
---
I've not had these but I had a similar white blinding one from the blinking signs in Lerys and a red one in the barn at Mother's.
---
Its a dumb addom but there are way more broken ones than that
---
I do ruin, noed, bbq and discordance. But you can swap out surveillance or strider for discordance depending on addons. I typicallyfocus on frequent short phases or cross map runs; you shouldn’t need predator for those 
---
Am I the only one who have seen enough Japanese "art" to see it differently?
---
If they don't want to punish camping then they'll just have to accept it and stop complaining.
---
Just a little [extra credit] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdgonewild/comments/9ddepn/spirit_x_adam_by_dirtyplaster) (NSFW) after the lesson, lol.
---
I think the most broken one I can think of is the instadown hatchets + more hatchets add-ons. But still, that's really hard to play against.
---
I can see why alot of people like the coloured perks in dbd but personally it's just a bit much for me...
---
Ultra Rare addons are heckin' rare. I entirely agree with them being crazy strong, because killers only get to use them for one (maximum: a few with offerings) games. We don't get to escape and keep our stuff. The only one I find major issue with is tombstone - and I love playing Daddy Mike. 
---
One game of being a death machine is fun. 
---
Unless one of them is in the wrong or out of line like calling another player a slur, I usually just ask them all to knock that shit off. I don't play very well as survivor myself so I hate when someone gripes at me. 
---
What does the tombstone do? Never played as Myers.
---
It’s not going to work. They already separated bp gain and rank gain. And killers in red ranks don’t need more bps they have their build set. 
---
Frankly, if your looping a killer for 7 minutes and the exit gates aren’t powered by the end of it, your not playing in red ranks. 
---
you should make replicas and sell them , bet there is money to be made there, dunno how licensing would work tho but damn i would pay good money for some of these
---
WTF DUDE!
---
Well playing SWF is like camping as well....you are not supposed to know about other survivors right? Unless you only communicate whether killer is camping or not camping, you are playing 5 perk game. You basically get another perk that lets you know what other survivors know. If someone finds lit totem then everyone knowes. If someone is being chased then everyone knows. If someone findes a gen then everyone knows. If someone finds the hatch then everyone knows. If someone worked on a gen and killer came for them then another can easily continue to work on that gen just after killer leaves the area. SWF is like another kindred like perk that showes the killer, gens, totems, and hatch.
---
&gt; fails at censoring the names
---
&gt; ITS A JOKE GUYS CALM DOWN IM JOKING YOU'RE THE DUMB ONE NOT ME
---
ok buddy
---
So, first you prove with your video that it is a valid strategy to secure on average 3 kills per match. (I will not comment on 10 games being a pathetic sample size for any form of experiment) Then you point at the fact that receiving less Bloodpoints makes the strategy not valid? But shitty?  
---
The facepalm at the end belongs to you alone. Camping is _douchey_, yet it is _valid_. It is _not fair_, yet it _works_. In reality it is very simple: "Camping is valid, but subjectively boring, unfair and/or mean."
---
They will do that even if you use protection though. Poor things ain't got anywhere to go.
---
if the host quit during the match starting, you'd get a bit of progress towards your gold tokens, not anymore.
---
Only if they quit during transition into the match? Not if the host quits during the match itself to prevent you from getting lunar points?
---
We really need more spirit stuff like this. 💛
---
Oh right,  thanks👌
---
I try my best not to hook camp, cause I play Doc. I just go where screams are. I start chasing you, you damn better bet I won't stop Chasing you until you're hooked. That's when I know others are around and start spamming shock therapy to find them. It may look like camping, but I'm not. Your dumbass teammates want points too much.
---
It's still more worth it to escape with the lantern. 
---
How is fixing a glitch making it harder lol?
---
So how does Legion make any sense as third panel of that?
---
"during transition into the match" - I think that means that killer had to disconnect during loading screen, not while in a game.
---
lmao i literally had a jake that was messing up his heals all the time. i actually felt sorry and let him. 
---
well thats just a weird bug.
---
this doesnt Change anything 
---
You dont have to pick get both
---
 [Close enough?](https://i.imgur.com/gde6kNW.png)
---
you mean like, Fett?
---
intended or not, it affected progress. there's been a ton of quitting hosts during this event if you haven't already noticed/ heard everyone bitching about it on the sub
---
I agree that would work awesome.
---
So you say that your a rank 1 survivor right? Once you get a feel for the killers powers it’s all about mindgames. Think about how you would run and counter it. I used killer to get good at survivor; it can work opposite too 
---
true :D
---
WHY DO PEOPLE GET MAD ABOUT FLASHLIGHTS WHEN THE HOLE POINT OF THEM IS TO BLIND THE KILLER, I ALWAYS APPLAUD SURVIVORS WHO BLIND ME AND MAKE ME DROP SURVIVORS AND MAKES ME FEEL STUPID FOR NOT CHECKING AROUND BUT I STILL DONT GET MAD AND TUNNEL AND CAMP THE FLASHLIGHT USER
---
Skins don’t do anything. Don’t worry about what other people think. If you think the huntress skin is dope, get the huntress skin! Do what makes you happy! This game is already a void of unhappiness sometimes, so live your life, do what you want, find happiness in the dark corners of DBD. Get the skin you want. 🤙🏻
---
you'd still lose your consumables
---
[Does this count as new artwork? I think so.](https://i.imgur.com/gde6kNW.png)
---
Would anyone be against just making fireworks a permanent item? In my opinion they aren’t OP or anything, most of the time the survivors miss them anyways. They’re a fun item and not as frustrating to play against as a flashlight. 
---
This has nothing to do with event progress though
---
I know they can’t do this to our boy
---
I too, play killer frequently, and I suppose it's a different perspective when you see someone with an ultra rare offering as a survivor.
---
I'd love to, but I'm from southeast asia and I'm not sure how international payments like PayPal works and all that. 
---
Horrible idea. Just because you had a bad game where you couldn’t catch somebody and they trabagged you doesn’t mean the devs should completely destroy the end game.
---
I don't really appreciate editing my art :( 
---
I actually strongly agree with you. People shouldn’t get butt hurt about a stupid game. My point, however, is that we should strive for the best possible experience. Why should we compromise with the current state of the game, when we’ve paid decent money for it and should except more than lies about things like optimization patches.
---
The blight event I got the huntress weapon even though I don't play her much cuz it looks cool. 
---
So I guess the question is do you have to get the full outfit for the huntress and Feng or just pick the pieces that you can mix and match with other stuff. 
---
They made thousands DC (which is technically killing them) with their sheer presence
---
if you play better than the Killer ofc *lol*
---
Art. Fine art. 
---
Damn that kitchen knife. Looks really awesome! The other stuff I could probably replicate with blindfolded eyes. 
---
^^^^jokes ^^^^aside. ^^^^You ^^^^really ^^^^did ^^^^an ^^^^awesome ^^^^job
---
These are awesome! He did a great job :D
---
Okay. I like this one a lot. But I’d love it more if a survivor was on the hook. 
---
EV is one of the most useful perks whatchu talking about? 
---
eh. indirectly because the offering is lost. I was bitching about the potential to lose BPS or valuable shit still even though they fix something that was insignificant for the health of the game.
---
Aw yeah, Bill coming in with those clutch pulls :D
---
high ranks Start at 5 imo
---
Frost eyes was a gret touch
---
He always comes back tho. 
---
I WAS BUSY KITING THE KILLER AROUND AS HE KNEW I KNEW WHERE IT WAS
---
Read sub's rule 3.
---
I know me too 
---
Yeah I know, I forgot to do that. If they take it down, oh well.
---
Insidious?
---
Spirit main here. If you are trying to mind game at a pallet be sure to stay out of line sight this will increase the odds of you not walking in to a fake. Also as the other said only 110ms so if your injured without ''Ironwill''  try to walk away and avoid stepping in bushes, that gives your postion away easy.
---
he didnt have those
---
he was uncloaked when he had no stain or radius 
---
Yes...you never made it clear if he was invisible or not
---
he didnt have insidious
---
I’m a noob, did ranks reset last night?

YEESH!! I'm in HS as a Sophomore and my class did a lot with the 3d printer at our school... So many mishaps, SO MANY!! haha
---
Lol more like this killer is so bad we have to do totems
---
And then i made it to i don't care land, where rank 1 takes no effort to get!
---
Wow!
---
&gt;spirt noises
---
maybe. but theres no way of knowing if everyone wouldve done the totems. realistically i can only count on myself, so id have to do all the totems
---
I’m sure I’ll run into your squad again. Next time don’t be altruistic fucks 😉
---
Honestly at that point they're probably just joking about how bad they did, I wouldn't take it personally 
---
Nurse main lmao
---
It could've been some combination of terror radius lowering perks and addons
---
For awhile, maybe. I am of the opinion that killers should be in control of the hatch because survivors have more than 1 way out. The survivor can do gens. If you don't want to have to do 3 gens to escape, then just die. Otherwise, bring Last stand (because this would be an incredible buff for it) and do the gens because that hatch should be the killer's if they find it first.
---
Truly the most inspiring lines from any character.
---
I take nothing personally in that chat box. If I did I would be a shell of a person bunched up in the corner rocking back and forth sobbing whilst scratching my back. 😂
---
I don't mind the joke! But I don't really like the fact that my art was edited. I'd appreciate if you'd delete it, thanks alot! :) 
---
Nah blocked your ping on mlga im sure we wont cross paths :)
---
here ill clarify his perks and addons
---
he had the addon that makes ur appearance faster and the other addon that makes reappearance faster
---
he had bloodhound,noed,enduring and ruin (to the best of my memory atleast)
---
i know for a fact he didnt have a perk to remove his radius or addons
---
*One Week Later.. * 
---
OMG Shrek OP! Stupid swamp buff makes me move 5% slower! I can't escape him! And trust fucking onion perk makes him cause everyone to cry! This is bullshit! Remove Shrek! 
---
Then you clearly have never faced a competent 4man SWF that do the gen's in less than 5 minutes. 
---
Are we not talking about camping? Take your arguments about the current state of the game and glitches to a discussion that matters 
---

That particular mask is the one I made for VincentVega's gleam giveaway.

Do you remember what perks/add-on he did have?

Wow? You’re that butthurt that you lost to an average Huntress? People like you disgust me. Git gud.
---
Lmao. No they don’t.

Some kid was on here complaining earlier about me slugging when that’s the only method to beat flashlight squads. Lowkey think he’s just a piss poor survivor main.
---
Oooooh! I'm clueless clearly. In that case that sucks...rightfully pissed
---
Not to poke the hornets nest but wouldn’t kill rushing be face camping?

20000 IQ play: trying to body block an ongoing Mori
---
Maybe like 1 in 50 games I run into them.  But rare enough to not worry about.  
---
This helps , thank you so much
---
Why argue? I know I’m right and you’ll just whine. No point to it. Bye bye. 
---
One of my favorite things about this game is how versatile teabags are in communicating. They can mean everything from “hello friend” to “thank you” to “yasss bitch, we did it!!” to “fuck you, eat my ass, killer scum.” The wholesome teabags are naturally always the best though. 
---
Adam: "hey do you need help with anything ?" 
---
Spirit "WAH"
---
Adam: "alright ill come back later."
---
Only very, very slightly. The main reason is that first, every new killer gets called the weakest thing in the game on the ptb (Legion definitely is not high tier, but by far not as terrible as people make them seem), sometimes more so then other times, and second, most people just don't like playing against them. Legion ignores stealth if they find at least 1 survivor, they ignore a lot of the skillful parts of the chase, they force you to mend very often and have some bullshit cheese tactics like Moonwalking, as well as bs addons like Franks Mixtape. So, it is people dc'ing because they rather play against someone else
---
No one is butthurt about anything im not mad i dont really honestly care blocked you because i dont feel like facing someone who actively makes it a mission to slug with a decent amount of gens up you didnt even do it to pressure you just slugged to slug i dont find that play style fun so i blocked your ping also the whole "git gud" what are you 12 let me guess fortnite is your favorite game too?
---
-MxnsterLIVE
---
they aren't interested in working with me to do licensing, I already asked.
---
even better advice 😂
---
I only DC if it’s a 3v1 or franks mixtape legion, or if I’m getting slugged for the 4K so I can give my teammate the hatch.
---
LOL...be lucky to get one 1 gen done with those kinds of setup.  All on maps choice, but all will die...maybe 1  will get hatch if lucky
---
Yeah, there's some quality... I MEAN BEGONE FOUL UNCHRISTIAN SUB!
---
Stop putting your signature, I’m well aware of who you are. I slugged to avoid getting blinded and losing drops, especially without Huntress lullaby. And fyi, my favorite game is dead by daylight, with 988 hours on it. Oh, and I’m 18 years of age too.
---
Isn’t Spies a little better after the buff?
---
Meh. Say what you want. Maybe your definition of doing "fine" is pipping, whereas mine is getting a 4k. And in my experience, I can't even imagine getting a 2k with Freddy and Huntress (in most games at rank 1) without ruin. 
---
Thanks! I've only started drawing dbd stuffs since I'm fairly new. I recently created a Twitter account for it if you're interested though! @scathykitty1 :)
---
I remember in a stream they said they didn't want numbers because it was part of the aesthetic/lore or something. 
---
Basically, image the scene - you are a fresh survivor new to the fog and you found a brown toolbox. All you know is that it sort of helps you repair shit faster, but of course your not going to take the time to measure the toolbox's rate of repair increase. Likewise, one time you found a toolbox that was full of supplies owned by Alex - and it had a lotta stuff in it that helped you not only fix stuff, but break stuff even faster. The game is supposed to be mysterious like that. 
---
Is it bad game design? Yeah maybe. Is it a huge inconvenience? Yeah, it is. 
---
I think someone knowing the stats behind stuff is what will separate newbies and experienced players. 
---
Even then its still not a great perk and not just 4hat but why would you run detection perks on doc?
---
What doc needs from his perks is game stall and chase potential similar to huntress just the other way around (all detection and no chase) I just don't see why you would use a perk that boosts the best part of you killers power 
---
Putting my signature just for those that dont ready above and just feel the need to comment now back to the conversation i explained to you why you were blocked you than said i was butthurt and than insulted me with "git gud" btw fornite players say that why i made the joke also cool dbd is my favorite game as well also im 20 :) 
---
&gt;he had the addon that makes ur appearance faster and the other addon that makes reappearance faster  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;he had bloodhound,noed,enduring and ruin (to the best of my memory atleast)
---
Uh oh. 
---
Also are you like okay? you could idk look at a wall but yeah dude thats the only way OMEGALUL
---
I’m pretty sure “git gud” has always been a thing but k.
---
Mainly depends on maps, I switch to Freddy when I get tired of the Huntresses slow move speed and reloading....maybe I am just a super lethal killer that prefers swfs, I do far better against SWFs than 4 solos who urban evade or dont hook rescue
---
Pretty much. 
---
OP says they play in Punishment mode until mid-game then switch to Treatment to track stragglers. Which is actually kinda interesting, I don’t think I’ve ever seen that. And while it’s not the strongest strategy I think they kinda need at least some tracking for early game 
---
Pretty sure last I checked you still blind with firecrackers even if they are looking at a wall.
---
Yeah for edgy 12 year olds but k
---
Try hard: An insult that is meant to ridicule or shame someone for putting forth effort or executing strategies.
---
It must really suck to be so much of a bitch that you're easily defeated and enraged by any amount of effort.
---
Good job, guy :)
---
That made me laugh
---
You use lockers to dodge a hit against the Nurse and then run while she's in blink recovery.  Hiding in lockers during a chase is an awful idea.
---
You can't loop Legion, use windows or pallets because they just activate their power and stab you. This is why Legion is so dumb when tunneling. It doesn't matter how skilled you are as a survivor or how trash the Legion player is, as long as they can track to an ok level then you will die. If a meh Billy, Hag, LF etc tunnels me I can loop them for 4/5 gens and atleast have some fun. The same can't be said for Legion unless they unbind RMB.
---
"If you don't agree with me you are wrong"
---
I like insidious, as a fun perk. It can be fun to throw on Mike and just.. pop out and stalk. 
---
It's very situational, but it can definitely get annoying when it's in a basement build and ol' Chili Mac is hanging out in the corner. 
---
No need for scratches in frenzy. Hit a survivor then look for glow from another. If they are all close together you should be able to tag most of them easily. Then tunnel one of them while the rest heal.
---
Spirit is strong yeh. Great for mindgames. Probably my fave mori too. 
---
Great, now I can't play Bill.
---
Rookie mistake?  Shaming survivors and lying about it. Big mistake. I know one of these survivors (know of them if its actually them) and I am positive they have the vod recorded. Hex, talk to your squad and have them come check out this post.
---
And you get exhausted.
---
All exhaustion perks allow you to save bad positioning, Dead Hard isn't as strong but more close quarter versatile, where as Sprint Burst can save a greedy hit and balanced landing can make dead zones infinites
---
Dead Hard isn't an issue and doesn't need changing, its strong in the right hands but has counters 
---
All is well! 😊
---
I think you misplaced your comment :)
---
Seriously, peoplein this game are OBSESSED with leaving comments on your profile. Literally the only time I've turned my profile private to stop the onslaught of salt every 4 games or so.
---
They were not streaming sadly they are aware of the post but like i said i stated what happened people are free to believe what they wish either way is fine but we all know what happened that game if hes in need of a ego boost he can have it but we all know what happened.
---
Lmfao. It would be a Claudette!
---
it has counters, but it still does too much, especially when you can use it so many times over the course of the game. Even if you took out the I-frames everyone would still run it.
---
I don’t think so sorry
---
To be fair, that is some weak ass camping. If you break line of sight from the hooked survivor before letting insidious activate, you'd have had more rescue attempts, which means much better odds of an early 2-hook in basement, which is pretty much guaranteed 4K / 3K + hatch.
---
Your points still would have been ass though, because the whole game is seriously like 4 chases and 4 hooks. The broader lesson about how camping is a shitty waste of time because you're standing still instead of doing things that generate BP is valid.
---
It's intentional. To make chases harder for both sides. You can't turn it off
---
Well that's a load of bull
---
Yeah it used to be like an insta heal lol
---
That sucks. :( And is a really bad marketing and PR decision.
---
I just wish I could turn off or turn down the “injured” music. Like... I’m out of chase now, gone it down. I’ll get health when I can. 
---
Once again it had nothing to do with countering flashlight saves no one was even there when he downed them he slugged and actively looked for someone else to down which he did and it cycle continued.
---
Wraith is pretty decent after his buff even if you only have yellow add ons he's in a pretty good state
---
It's become an issue when you make a killers that are really easy to play super powerful this is why you see so much Billy at high ranks 
---
No, it's called game design. Devs wanted it this way. If you don't agree and can't adapt, you can switch the games.
---
I was being sarcastic. Just wanted to say something more ridiculous than "delete NOED".
---
Ok 
---
Honestly, I realize Spirit is difficulty ranked higher than Legion.. but, with that said, she's got crazy map presence and doesn't need to respect pallets. Insane. My first game with her was leaps and bounds easier than my first Legion game. 
---
Fair enough, but it’s no surprise since there’s people that genuinely want it gone. 
---
*Use 4 Decisive Strikes and no one bats an eye, use 1 Franklin's Demise and everyone loses their minds.*
---
If everyone will run it anyways the I-framed aren't always the issue. It's a perk that is in a good spot. It doesn't need nerfs in any way.
---
The I-frames help in very close areas but are very telegraphed.
---
It's moreso the case of the player needing to adapt rather than the perk being changed, sure it's strong in the right hands, but it's a loop extension, if the loop is the issue leave the loop
---
thats just bs my Dude 
---
I think people who having no idea what they're talking about just should not be allowed go engage in conversations
---
I usually get hate messages on xbox even if I play completely fairly. I just throw it back in their face then block them so not only getting the last word in but wasting their time if they try to return the message.
---
Just don't go in the basement once you know he's there. And once you see him his spot is gone and you can easily loop.
---
&gt;We collectively killed one guy.
---
Seriously it's kinda funny how Legion in lore technically all have 0.25 kills under their belt.
---
I've had that happen before but instead it was a Dwight
---
They still give survivors a movement speed burst after hitting them and wipe their blade too. Killers have just as much, if not less chance to find the hatch because there isn't 3 other people you need to worry about. You can go look for the hatch while the killer is chasing someone else, or better yet, find the hatch while by tracking it using the addons! The killer can never track the hatch! Survivors have all these currently useless tools like last stand and hatch tracking because they win the hatch standoff 90% of the time. Make those tools useful and give the killer the power over the hatch standoff so survivors can get even more developed tools for hatch survival such as a perk that could skew the odds.
---
Why do people always complain about survivors not leaving and yet they make no effort to force them out
---
They look nice who cares if the perk is useless ingame 
---
Yeah that sucks a lot. I know so many people who would buy this for cosplay and or just to have as decor. Cough me cough
---
Oh wow that’s fucked up. I retract my statement now.
---
Made an entire team quit last night with it &gt;-&gt; get to the end match screen and low and behold 4 decisives, funny though I only used Franklin's because they were using them damn firecrackers 
---
Exact same thing happened to me with a freddy on this same map lol
---
because in the movie (the reboot, that this freddy is based on) Quentin literally uses an adrenaline shot to wake up Nancy and save her life
---
it originally didn't do this when Freddy launched but fans asked for it to be that way since it matched the movie better. So the reason is fan service. Honestly I think it's fine, Freddy has a lot of other worse problems.
---
tbh yeah pharmacy wastes much less time
---
welcome to the big leagues
---
Does -novid work in your launch options? 
---
What does "valid" mean, here? You won (3-4 kills) most of your matches, without much of any real effort, so if the question is whether camping is a valid winning strategy, then your video suggests only that it is.
---
That's nothing new however. Camping works, we've known that for years, and survivors have been complaining about it for years - because it works. It is the exception that survivors will just do gens and get out, even if given the chance and choice to (which they not always are: especially in solo queue, the other survivors will not know that the killer is camping, so multiple if not all of them will waste time and/or give their lives trying to save, or the survivor on hook will just kill themselves because they are being camped and not saved; likewise, if you catch a survivor early and potentially even have Ruin in play, even the most obvious of camping still regularly means you secure 1 kill before 3 gens are done, *even if* the survivor on hook struggles to their last breath and the others forgo trying to save them in favour of doing gens).
---
And this is Leatherface camping, just standing around waiting. Survivors fall for even that, and they totally have issues against smarter ways of camping, such as baiting survivors in by leaving hook at first, returning to hook periodically, proximity camping.
---
Your video does demonstrate that it is boring and hardly requires skill, however.
---
Listen man it’s a good perk for an all around fun build everyone can enjoy.
---
I agree with you on that. Wraith is the MVP.
---
But, you’re right about him treating his facts like opinions. He did a lot of research apparently on his points so I assumed that they would have been more factual. 
---
And then you run circles around the room listening to 'You're the Best Around' while high fiving yourself.. 
---
Oh, just me? 
---
*Okay..*
---
Thank you very much.
---
guess I play in a different league then
---
but if you want video proof, I dont record my game play but I have almost the same results as a stream named ScottJund who once a month plays evilscott and pulls out all the nasty perks and addons.  He just ran it yesterday.
---
8k bloodpoints for a single time use that saves you 20 sec at best. Ultra rare worthy?
---
Sure, but that's why those items would be more useful. They barely have a use now, not to mention 10 minutes is way less than what a hatch standoff can be. There is no time limit on matches, and I have had 30 min hatch standoffs where I give up because my youtube video ends. That's a dumb amount of time to waste when we likely have both gained a pip. Survivors dont gain anything from bleeding out versus getting sacrificed anyway, so the incentive to hide from the killer for those 10 mins (if the killer doesnt have deerstalker) is literally nothing but the chance for the last guy to come heal him so the game can keep going longer than 10 minutes. Also, hitting a survivor makes noise that can draw the survivor back to the game to leave because they heard they are being hit. Jumping through the hatch is faster and makes 0 noise. If the survivor is full health or has a self care function (which is dominant still) then the hatch standoff is survivor sided because the killer has to hit you TWICE and then pick you up before you realize you are being killed and self care again. So it isn't" whoever hits m1 first, the survivor hast to hit m1 first in BOTH scenarios. 
---
You know what I want to skip? The giant Moonrise pop-up that constantly appears after games and on startup. Leave it in its little tab on the right side, and I'll open it when I want to.
---
You are stupid because the hatch is fine- the only way it would be annoying is if the survivor is refusing to jump in the hatch despite you not even camping it
---
Keep in mind, this is assuming they cant get more than 2 gens done (which is rare at high rank) before there is 1 player left.
---
Wraith is already stronk. Pig could use some love, and Freddy... just... *sigh*
---
Trapper really needs some TLC, though there are some god-tier Trapper mains out in the Fog.
---
Only if you give him "All Star" instead of the heartbeat when you're in terror radius.
---
im going to main adam and the spirit now because of this post
---
And Quentin has it? I have never noticed about that xd 
---
Feng, because you can actually see her costume in-game. Killer cosmetics are only for the survivors to look that. During an intense killer round, you'll forget you're even wearing one 
---
The leprechaun. He just had a new movie somewhat recently too
---
I love doing this on my rank 15 account.  I will point and pull survivors to gens and then run the killer, take hits for them, and just have a great time.
---
My internet is fine, good day sir.
---
Long as they aren't decisive strike I absolutely love them, great work. 
---
He's like a child murderer. They're well known for being very durable.
---
when you wanna get the safest unhook possible but aren't paying attention to how much struggle time ur pal has left
---
Yeah that's fine but then people go on Reddit and complain about how the survivors wasted their time teabagging at the gates. Like just hit them out damn
---
This so much.  Why borrowed time is not the survivor version of bloodlust, I have no idea.
---

---
In the movie Quentin uses a shot of adrenaline to wake Nancy up sooo lore friendly.
---
At some point they're going to have to put a Latina in the game (I say Latina only because there are 9 guys to 6 girls at the moment).
---
You will inevitably get into chases. And that's when I practice. As I said I'm not great at loops and chases, but I'm not garbage. I play alot, and will get into chases just about every game, but I try to avoid them as much as possible. If I can get into 1 or 2 chases a game instead of just spring thing at the killer, I'm going to do it. And this guy specifically asked how to win a chase against a spirit, who heavily relies on scratch Mark's and noises so win, so I give him an answer to his question.
---
Only shit killers slug anyway. Git gud.

---
Press X to Doubt
---
Maybe for Halloween, but I'm not seeing another licensed Killer in the near future. 
---
by the same token if the survivor m1s first he only wins if the killer is afk. technically with certain killers you can body block and use 1 shot effects with short timings like iridescent heads or hillbilly chainsaw but i would say that’s too inconsistent to be fair. also i might test that save the best for last thing (i assume you meant save the best for last instead of play with your food for logical reasons)
---
It's confirmed freddy has force pull
---
this from a killer whose name is a Toxic Dipshit?
---
Seems legit.
---
I thought running Kindred would help. Lol. Still a 50% chance of having teammates of the crouch-and-do-nothing variety as soon as someone is hooked.

Saying less than 50 would be realistic. The community on xbox mainly consists of a core of experienced and toxic players. Not friendly for newcomers. Even at Rank 15 there are almost only Prestige 3 players with DS, Self Care, Dead Hard...
---
Yeah stridor is really good on her. My current build has BBQ, nurse's calling, rancor, and overcharge. Though overcharge is really just a placeholder cuz I don't have anything else better atm. Other perks that are nice to have on her are make your choice, haunted grounds (usually paired up with something like lullaby or ruin), discordance, tinkerer, and surveillance.

In what world is that possible, even on console... 
---
Not 100% but I think nothing happens because they don't have charges to deplete, or have some hidden amount like 10 which would require a lot of hits to destroy.
---
I'm not sure but I'd assume so, that'd be something people would need to test but usually after they are dropped I never see them again

What?

Someone before posted the stats of most of the items, perks and add-ons interactions, however these were pre-nerf of a number of things and alot could have changed by then. Importantly, these were also before Tinkerer was reworked to the perk you see now. Before a lot of addons were deliberately made weaker to compensate for Tinkerer's buffs. We really could use a similar thing now that alot had changed.

That's lovely! Really, well written and different from other (in a good way!) posts here about legion.

well joking aside they only need to do 4 soundtracks . they established that the legion is just 4 people

The point is that Deja Vu’s effect can be learned when you know the maps. So yes its effect is actually pretty strong and handy but it becomes useless when you know the maps and can prevent a 3 gen without the use of a perk slot

Are you fucking serious? Don't just sit there, go hit them. If they don't leave hit them again. If they still haven't left pick them up and hook them.
---
If you're just sitting there watching them, that's 100% on you.
---
The mask on the bottom right corner, what’s the reference?

This is a complicated subject to address, because it's so multifaceted. On one hand, Legion can disregard a crucial element of survivor gameplay by being able to fast-vault windows &amp; pallets with their power. On the other, they cannot end the chase against a good survivor as quickly as Nurse or Huntress, 2 other killers that do not necessarily have to break pallets or mind-game windows in order to down survivors. Instead, Legion is required to deep-wound a survivor with hit 1, then either down a survivor while in 110% base speed, tag them more than once more in Frenzy to deplete their meter, or "cheese" the meter to deplete with moonwalking. All time-consuming processes. But Nurse is another level from every other killer in the game altogether, so the comparison is tough to make. 
---
Additionally, Legion has the ability to see nearby survivor locations for a moment after every successful Frenzy strike. Personally, I have not had much of a problem with this as a survivor, and in my first few games testing Legion it's usefulness varied. But some folks are really not enjoying that particular mechanic, combined with a perk loadout that slows the game to a crawl when all players are injured or 3-gen themselves. In this regard, I sort of compare them to the Doctor. Poor in direct chases, but capable of controlling game time-flow in some cases and capable of doing multiple things to frustrate survivor players with little to no effort.
---
I have had relatively little difficulty against them and mixed results (including moderate success at times) playing as them (though I've only played as a standard killer would, with the addition of making judgment calls when a location-ping pops up after a Frenzy hit). Vaulting to tag a survivor is fun, though the subsequent chase to down the injured party is not and just feels like I'm going through the motions, but slower than I would as Trapper, Billy, or Clown. As a survivor, the "initiate chase, prolong one window loop with Lithe, get hit unavoidably eventually, run, mend when clear if Legion is not Sloppy Moonwalking, rinse, repeat" formula gets old so fast. I have had some fun games against some fun Legions, but it had more to them falling for window tuckbacks and basic baits (which no experienced killers will ever fall for) than anything else. But I have seen other players streaming that have had Legion sink their game into a downright unwatchable state, with tedious repetitive mending, formulaic chases that last far too long without any entertaining gameplay choices being made, and near-stalemate matches at 1 gen remaining. 
---
It's less a question of power level and more a question of gameplay direction. Legion and changes to perks like Sloppy Butcher have extended the game. Which is something I think needed to be done to a degree, but some believe this character and some builds possible with it have taken the game too far in the other direction.
---
That's really only scratching the surface, but I hope that helps you understand. :)
---
With sound they are pretty much worthless. In winter event I blinded a lot of killers and saved a lot of lives, this event I yet to blind one time, or be blinded by them.
---
Yeah same here to be honest, I don't aim for great skill checks unless it's necessary (clutching a 1v1/ruin hex is active).
---
Epic fail by a drunk Russian. Nothing surprising to see here. 
---
This is a huge problem for me and is why I almost never solo queue nowadays. Even at Rank 1 the survivors play like that. Its super frustrating because it even happens on OP survivor maps like Asylum and Haddonfield. I started playing alot more killer during the event and Whispers has been a must for me on console because almost every survivor plays like that.
---
I’ve also noticed people who are so deathly afraid of doing anything but healing themselves when injured... people really need to get the mentality out of their head especially against Killers with an instant down. Some popular youtuber has got to make a video telling survivors why its better to run perks that synergize with being injured than running self care. Because the amount of people I see who after getting unhooked, leave hundreds of scratch marks and blood puddles into a direct line in the corner of the map is just sad.
---
Camping can pay off if the other survivors all stop progressing gens to come for the save, commonly referred to as "the leatherface effect" (lol) but if you just decide to do gens instead of saving, camping gets shredded
---
Well, if you can provide positive feedback that would be beneficial to the financial growth of a company, why not?
---
Unrelated 
---
But the survivors are constantly doing trials. How are none of them becoming aware of the efficacy of items..
---
DC-ing to deny BBQ points is toxic as fuck lol
---
Context: I was playing Killer (rank1btwdontmeantobraglolimsogood) and I went up against some *seriously* potato Survivors. I found my first survivor in about 10 seconds and they would drop every pallet 3 feet in front of me before continuing to run off. In particular there was this one Feng Min who was absolutely terrible (she waited at the shack pallet to drop it. Yes she's *THAT* guy) who I guess was hiding in a locker or something all game because she somehow was among the last two survivors remaining.
---
I found the other Survivor who, at this point I had never hooked before. I chase them and while they give me a good chase every pallet on the goddamn map is gone and I quickly down them.
---
Hook them and roam around the map: Whispers is only going off when I'm near the hook. "K then guess the other Survivor is going for the unhook." I come close and see the potato Feng unhooking the other Survivor. Down the unhooked Survivor and slug them before chasing Feng.
---
I chase Feng for awhile and eventually she leads me to the hatch. It is then that I see her *stop moving to heal the grass.* Well I guess I know where the last Survivor is!
---
Feng thankfully (for the Survivor) fucked off and I downed her a little too far from the hatch to then get the other Survivor. Post game chat went a little something like this:
---
&gt;Only Good Survivor: HOLY SHIT
---
&gt;Only Good Survivor: Fucking worthless Feng holy hell
---
&gt;Only Good Survivor: You almost fucking killed me you dumbass
---
&gt;Me: lol yeah this bitch wastes the shack pallet
---
&gt;Me: She's THAT guy
---
&gt;Only Good Survivor: seriously so bad ffs
---
&gt;Me: Blows up every gen IDK how she lived that long
---
&gt;Me: Honestly might've given you hatch since you did well on this garbage team
---
&gt;Only Good Survivor: would you have given hatch?
---
&gt;Me: IDK wanted 4k but you did do well
---
&gt;Me: really bad allies though
---
Unfortunately true, but hey if you see my name I'm usually the potato at red rank dead set on using a pebble(usually jake or nea) remember fellow console players the game is what we make it, it doesn't have to be a sweat fest, that being said as killer I'm gonna try and get my bbq stacks.
---
I play killer and I didn't know clowns bottles do a mini stun. thanks for that info.
---
Lol what? All you do is press it once as soon as the copyright page shows up. No "rapidly slams" necessary.
---
[This!](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reeeeeee)
---
It's a "sound" you make when mad.
---
I don't know, I think that the Spirit always looks mad when attacking so I imagine her doing a *"REEEEEEE!!!"* sound.
---
Lame joke, sorry. 
---
Just because something has a check doesn't mean it's balanced. 
---
The announcement had excluded P3 50 characters but I dont see that here. Im not sure
---
Yeah but if that killer went hard on you all you'd be doing is talking shit about how he was sweaty and tryhard and likely a Russian terminator robot prototype.  Survivors like it when they win, it's all GGs and WPs but when they get sent to the spider god in the sky it's a whole different song.  
---
Got a couple hundred hours in now, still haven't dc'd from a match. Too greedy for bp to do that lol
---
Oh, you mean *DEADgarden* ? 
---
The way I see it, adding any additional objectives will slow the gen rush a little bit, because right now the gens are the literal only thing the survivors can do to progress-if they had anything else (the totems were a good start) the matches would naturally get slower. 
---
You say the secondary objective should be mandatory, I'd rather have it be optional, but I don't know which way would be better. Hopefully BHVR would test a concept like this around, then we'd see.
---
What's the point of hitting someone who is *literally standing at the gate/hatch*? And I could say the same for survivors: Don't just sit there, leave the arena. That way we can all get on to the next match faster. 
---
The word "moderately" can mean literally anything. A "considerable" increase could mean a 25% increase or a 300% increase, or anything in between, or outside of those ranges.
---
And yes, I also hate it when a recipe call for a "pinch" of something or a "splash" or a "handful" because those words are useless. Just give me a goddamn number.
---
its a [well known](https://www.icommunicatetherapy.com/child-speech-language/autism-spectrum-disorder-asd-children/autism-avoiding-abstract-language/) thing to the point of people making [comics about it](https://imgur.com/hN2r1Rd)
---
Either they only got the license for LF or they didn't have a good concept for Survivor perks when they were designing the DLC.
---
Oh okay, sorry. I’ve only had Reddit for a month and I’ve been lurking for most of that time. Thanks! Thanks for being cool about it too lol
---
Maybe if you’re at rank 15 with a SWF and escape every game
---
because rank doesn't matter and it's not hard to get to rank 1
---
You must be the survivor I teabagged..
---
Gl getting adept with Bill. 
---
I only really like the Huntress body. The boar head is ridiculous and the weapon is eh. What I would do is get the hair and body for feng and the body for huntress.
---
Theres a 2 week grace period after the event ends where you can still spend your coins btw
---
It’s one of Trapper’s (unpopular I guess) cosmetics.
---
Why do I go against a DS every game? 
---
The characters from devils rejects
---
Isn’t Hag supposed to be some sort of zombie witch? 
---
Please make one that says "What's cookin', good hookin'?" with a picture of the doctor.
---
What? Why would it be a player issue? I don't even know what you mean by that.
---
Next Killer Ben Shapiro confirmed. 
---
ik its boring playing against her, and she is powerful, but if you hide good, she wont be able ti find you andshe will loose time searching for you, while other people repairs, so yea, she has that counterplay, she is 96% movement speed.
---
Wait, no idea how people stand in place and swipe at the air? I'm confused.
---
I have a post that I occasionally use to refer to when looking at the numbers of addons and items. 
---
Im not sure if its still relevant but im pretty sure it covers most of the items even though its relatively old.

I don't mind them giving us content for another 2 years and then they can release Dead By Daylight 2 in 5 years time. 
---
The Thing could totally work as a disguise-oriented killer, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LEGION RAAR
---
Literally said Legion isn't OP. Just unfun.
---
People don't want a nerf, they want a rework. 
---
And yes, I have looped killers for 4/5 gens at R1 lol. R1 has a very wide difference in skill levels. 
---
Legion is cool no homo
---
The envelope changes go live later this week. 
---
Rmeinder: It's not BBQ, so who cares. 
---
Kills half of the survivors, then sits on his ass with a contented smile
---
Once I was on the killers shoulder, my friend dropped a firecracker and it blinded me, but not the killer. I was salty.
---
“Thank you... hey, wait a minute...”
---
You too good
---
It must have to do with you because both sides take minutes for me and I ranked all the way up to 1 and stop have no problems. 
---
Knowing perk distances is really important though. You need to know how your perk ranges compares to your terror radius of each killer.
---
Oooooo i didnt know that!  
---
It's a visual bug, you didn't escape as the match didn't even start. 
---
Oh well, scrubs like me does. So sorry about reminding scrubs
---
Did... did you even LOOK at the screenshot?
---
This is adorable!
---
No; it's just that the oldest Killer (Huntress) wasn't released alongside a Survivor, so there hasn't been a chance to see an anachronistic Survivor in game.
---
Although if we are working off linear time, a Survivor that's lasted decades or centuries without becoming a Killer themselves would have to have an adamantium will.
---
It shouldn't happen becase of all the ways it can be abused. 
---
I dont know one person who wouldnt be ok with removing DS and NOED. They just dont belong
---
For 10-15 minutes (it felt like) without missing a single beat. Every single swing was perfectly timed. No way some dude was sat there for that long just hitting R2 that consistently.
---
Candle is in Parapa Palace. Go west.
---
His weapon is LITERALLY a spine so...
---
You have chosen, wisely.
---
I’m guessing you don’t work in the hospitality industry
---
It only takes about 15 seconds base to recharge. That'd be a pretty short chase for any killer.
---
Which again, goes back to the core issue that Legion's power is unfun to deal with not that Legion is overpowered. Legion doesn't get many kills, but the ones they do get are pretty much guaranteed. It's like that slow killer with a spoon video. Except it's the whole match.
---
I wonder what, exactly, his plan was there.
---
Lmfao. Some memes belong here.
---
Man, my corn blindness is approaching unbearable levels at this point lol I understand tracking issues
---
They touch a couple gens.  Get an unhook and immerse their asses until hatch spawns.  That's how pathetic potatoes like Feng get to rank 1.
---
Let's not even mention the independent study recently done on how effective her traps really are. Over half of survivors remove the trap with the very first Jigsaw box. 
---
In over 500 applications of traps, the number of actual trap based kills was *abysmal*.
---
You aren’t the first person to say so. Even still, I shouldn’t have to take that measure. 
---
Not to casuals like me. It's a huge inconvenience, but it stops when I just search the perk/addon/item on the DBD Wiki. Takes like 5 mins.
---
So big inconvenience? Yeah, but the definition of inconvenience is something that is bothersome or annoying. Searching up the Wiki is exactly that, but it doesn't stop me from playing the game and thus I dont really care in the end.
---
Who wouldn't? Jake is a cutie.
---
Fyi, huntresses lullaby isn’t directional, it sounds like that to everyone
---
I vote for Feng.
---
* Survivor is 3rd person camera so you'll be able to see your cosmetics.
---
* Subjectively, I think that the event Feng outfit is one of her better options, and that the huntress outfit isn't one of her better options.
---
They didn’t come when I was flicking or being still. They could definitely hear his terror radius. And people do flicking for camping and for “come get me”. I usually come anyway and if I hear the killer around I leave. 
---
Not everyone does that. I have had people do it and et mad when I don’t come. 
---
Feng. Huntress’s cosmetics are invisible to the user and ugly.
---
I’m getting 2 per BW now. 
---
Lag seems to be against you young one
---
I'd gladly take that offer.  Get rid of both no skill crutches and both sides suddenly have far less to complain about.  This game would be a far less toxic place with both removed from game.
---
You're using the meme wrong. Now it implies that getting keys and all that is bad and that getting that fire cracker is a good thing
---
Yeah. Maybe if you view things on a character that is prestiged, you get stats of everything.
---
Like, P1 shows the common stats
---
P2 reveals uncommon
---
P3 reveals every stats
---
That way it fits into the lore - the more experienced survivor/killer knows exactly how things work.
---
Same here, if it’s an important matter I simply leave but other than that, no matter how bad a game is for me, I’ll tough it through, some points is better than no points and even if I de-pip, quitting can de-rank you really fast 
---
Her lullaby is directional though. It’s Freddy’s lullaby that is nondirectional. 
---
I tbagged to thank a killer and realized they might misunderstand that
---
... best to nod at killer
---
Doesn't look like TP to me, Freddy probably had BBQ &amp; Chili, saw your auras in a healing position. The survivor was insta-sacrificed so he probably made the beeline for you guys the second the hook animation finished.
---
It took him from :05 about 15 seconds to get close enough for you to react. Seems legit enough to me.
---
I, too, write porn on the internet.
---
I agree NOED like Decisive is a trash perk for trash players but in all honesty dude if you're in a swf it is your fault you're getting hit with it.  Count totems and take them all out.  Your on comms dude....Solo queue I 100% agree NOED is beyond obnoxious and guaranteed to go off because randos don't cleanse dulls but in a swf you guys are choosing to eat that noed.
---
Ah, weird. Never seems to be directional for me, must just be me. Ty
---
My friends instead hoard their lery's and the game tokens to burn when we play together, hate those bastards as much as I like them lol
---
It's fun for Legion. Not so fun for survivors.
---
But then again, they use Decisive Strike, so when have they ever cared about my fun?
---
I want to know the perks the 3 experienced members were running. I bet we had at least 2 ds
---
My idea for the gates shutting after 30 seconds is the force survivors to wait on opening the gates until the time is right. If they can just open them and have them stay open forever then you're pretty much guaranteed to lose someone. Granted maybe a 30 second close and after 3 shuts *then* the gate becomes inoperable? 
---
If the only way one can escape is by your friend quitting, I'm pretty sure your team has lost. Even has a Survivor main, if my team did that, that's us accepting a lost, and are now only out to spite the Killer.
---
Of course, we feel differently on this, so I think we'll have to agree to disagree.
---
Lol Sprint burst gets you away with bad positioning, Dead Hard lets you get away with making risky plays and getting rewarded because you have to time it well.

You just started out, use this time to learn the basics of the game and start grinding bp for the killers you like.  
---
I guess you'll just have to wait and see some better survivors.
---
I actually won't fight you on that. I just thought it summarized my thoughts well. I agree. 
---
The dc, it was going to be a 4k if they didnt cheat.
---
I used to think that. Then I played them. I think the people complaining about Legion only do so because they're survivor mains and they can't just run circles around them forcing survivors to actually switch up their strategy. 
---
Lol
---
My heart will go on Celine Dion
---
&gt;@scathykitty1
---
hi i'm a very happy new fan of yours :)
---
Yes because they can surely make accurate measurements and things with the naked eye lol
---
Yeah "everyone" says that but majority of the time the killer is chasing someone else when people do that in my games 
---
Because it takes two minutes for a survivor to die off the hook. Thats not kill rushing thats just being stupid
---
95% of conversation would stop

---
Am i really so transparent :/
---
Alright why do you care though I’m pretty sure most people understood what op was trying to say. It really doesn’t matter.
---
I don't think the traps should kill but yes: statistically the actual stalling power of the traps is very weak, and that probably needs some serious tweaking. I have proposed that the baseline number of boxes required should be standardized, with 2 boxes required on base and the sketch / annotated plan increasing the number of required boxes by 1 along with their current effects. (IE 3 boxes to open in order to get a key and 5 boxes spawn)
---
seeing how they literally have a perk named iron maiden and they all like metal they most likely have iron maiden on it.
---
I don't want to lose 50 hours worth of games just so I can get bbq and chilli... I want to win a couple, you know..
---
I don't think you give blind enough credit that plus exhaustion is infuriating to deal with plus she just got a substantial buff then you have killers like the clown or doc that are both really weak and could use some tuning
---
Dat phat 20% from Prove thyself too.
---
it s really not that hard to play around because as long as you gen rush and no one lets him afk farm youll get through it fast enough he wont even hit t3, theres other even more aids builds like the cold dirt+franklins legion or the mother daughter ring no sound spirit.
---
Whispers? no thanks, Make your choice? I used to, I've resorted more to perks that I like instead of those that are good, these aren't even that bad anyways
---
No I knew he was gonna check there, didn't really make it discreet 🤷‍♀️😂 lmao
---
Daily occurrence. I have quit playing due to being a gen jockie for 3 gens then attempting to help a  random for them to just leave me hooked if I get caught..
---
Juliet dont be alarmed but im now in love with you, i have only just this year startes actually posting content and holy hell i get this. That drawing is beyond what i expected, its fantastic!
---
At Rank 1, you'll see the best there is (in theory). Nobody is arguing that's it's not easy to just D/C, but it's considered a smart play because this last survivor wouldn't of lived otherwise.
---
Not saying it's not cheap to D/C, just that this play right here was a smart move.
---
That's Kate...
---
That Deathgarden mask brings back some good memories.
---
Rip in piece
---
Is it a dick move...absolutely! Is it bannable...I don't think so. I've had it done a few times to me and have done it accidentally myself just bc the game was laggy and not letting me unhook 
---
That's part of the game dude. It's part of the experience. 
---
Woah, woah.. Doc is nowhere near weak. Honestly, I routinely 4K every time I have his rite, and I've barely leveled him. 
---
It happens, the matchmaking in this game can be questionable to say the least
---
You are correct I completely got the wrong
---
killers are faster than survivors
---
Fine I’ll switch accounts
---
Survivors act like they're fucking angels when in reality a lot of them can be just as big assholes as killers. I get more hate messages as killer than I ever do as a survivor, and most survivor friends just has a massive edge.
---
You didn't force them to DC at all though. They only had 1 gen left and you slugged for the 4k. That's hardly being 'too brutal' and they still escaped with some damn good teamwork. 
---
Bold of you to assume players at any rank won’t just rush he nearby gens and ultimately fuck themselves. 
---
🦀
---
If the only counterplay to her in a chase is "just hide", that's not counterplay.
---
All the other 110% mov. Speed killers have ways to apply map pressure
---
Nurse can blink -&gt; cover distance fast
---
Hag -&gt; trleport to her traps = free hits/pressure
---
Spirit -&gt; can cover andecent amount of distance in phase walk -&gt; map pressure
---
Huntress -&gt; she can throw hatches from distance ( unreliable/map dependent) 
---
Legion -&gt; has his frenzy and lower terror radius ( he still lacks in map pressure) 
---
So guving clown only 110% speed would make him even weaker when it cones to pressuring survivors 
---
His strength is his chasing effectiveness wich is a way of pressuring survivors but he still cant get to gens that fast.
---
If a survivor starts running away early, his tonic doesnt help him to catch up ( impossible to hit in some maps and otherwise hard to hit but you can use it to zone survivors in specific locations.
---
Thats my reasoning behind this, if i missed something important just tell me
---
matchmaking is really bad because of the event right now. it'll be more balanced in that area once it's over
---
Pretty sure he had Insidious and you're remembering it wrong.
---
If someone enjoys sitting still camping just securing a kill that's honestly sad and they shouldn't be playing this game at all. 
---
The point of the traps is not to kill but to give the fear of death.
---
Don’t give in to peer pressure!
---
people do it sometimes to slow down the timer when a killer is being particularly campy 
---
What I hate is that the killer has the power to absolutely ruin a survivor’s game but survivor can’t ruin a killer’s game other than disconnecting early which doesn’t totally ruin the game for the killer
---
Yeah I don’t wanna make another account right now.
---
What kind of 3d printer did you use?
---
Thanks, that’s my plan btw :D
---
Study and work hard, create my own start-up and let’s hope it all works out.
---
I wish you all the best and most importantly a boss who won’t fire you for stating that he is wrong :D
---
When you have dead hard, it be like OP
---
I was an advocate for replacing Self Heal with Adrenaline so everyone spends less time healing and more time on gens, but since I run dead hard so often I swapped out Adrenaline for Resilience, kept hope and dead hard, and now feel antsy if I don't enter the last stage injured
---
Can confirm. I play Spirit and if you don't have IW I find you every time. If you have IW I lose you about half the time.
---
It's so satisfying to see you getting her without NOED. A similar video like this got uploaded very recently and it was a pig with NOED that got a fully healed survivor. That wasn't satisfying to watch at all because I have a deep hatred towards NOED
---
Does this mean you finally gave up and put in a service ticket? :)
---
And yes, you were totally spamming. 
---
Hes awful lmao. Only good against inexperienced players
---
They were afk.
---
You survivor mains are getting out of control.
---
Couldn't have worded it better myself
---
Does this robe make me look fat?
---
Are you brand new to the game? A lot of it is learning the maps, which you can really only learn through playing. You have to get used to how players will run the maps. When you know the maps better you learn things like how to cut through tiles, and how to not follow directly behind survivors in a chase but to instead estimate their pathing.
---
I'm also going to echo what people said about perks not being totally necessary. I have killers in my roster with only the one perk that they start out with that I regularly get 3 or 4 kills with.
---
They also don't run faster than you, BTW. Most of the killers are 110% or more of the survivors' base speed, except for the Nurse.
---
All in all, it's like any multiplayer game. You have to play and get used to it and learn the tricks to start winning. Have you played as survivor at all? Because playing both sides helps you learn the game, too.
---
Rank actually does matter, I find these kinds of potatoes a lot less at rank 7 then i did at rank 15. There will always be these kinds of boosted idiots, but rank certainly isn't irrelevant.
---
I have a Raise3D N2 plus.
---
Nah, its good to use solely for the ridiculous perma bloodlust 1 speed boost
---
I also play survivor and killer pretty evenly (although I prefer killer if I had to choose). I feel like I get trolled ALL the time as a killer. I got a message recently from a person complaining that I camped and I totally did not (same situation that you described above). I saw 2 people coming in from different sides and chased. The other person did not get to them in time and they died. They were super pissed and constantly messaged me... On the other hand I try so hard to not troll the killer BUT there are some killers who are just complete jerks idk I guess in my experience survivors are way bigger trolls but I have had it on both sides
---
The problem isn't that you can't push them out, because when people complain the damage is already done, survivors just wait there untill the killer, that is at the other side of the map, comes to the gate so he can see the survivors T-bag and leave.
---
you're In the wrong neighbourhood prepare for salty survivors to complain.
---
seriously most survs are straight up delusional they act like the most toxic little shit but as soon as the killer just even nods at them It's always ''KILLERS SO TOXIC OMG''
---
It counts as sabotage and bodyblocking, because you are also preventing someone else from rescuing them. 
---
Cool, keep up the creativity
---
90% chance he was going to get face camped by bubba anyways. But killer mains will say different
---
Oh that's right originally it was back end, ahead of an actual patch
---
Enya. Just Enya. 
---
Couldn't agree anymore. One of the most frustrating things about the Nurse is trying to know what she can and cannot blink past. So many times where I could've got someone because of it. 
---
Overwatch still has a second opening that always plays
---
You had 2 options. Get gen rushed by them or fuck around.
---
**Urban Evasion** as I can move quite rapidly and quietly in a crouched position.
---
**Up the Ante** as as I tend to have rather good luck and resources.

**Stakeout** as I have a bad habit of snooping in on other people’s conversations if I think they’re talking about me or something that directly effects me.  Also if my boss or parents are pissed I like staying close enough that if they call me I can immediately appear but far enough that they don’t notice my presence.
---
**Deja Vu** because I’m useless.
---
The overwatch opening always plays for me
---
I would probably quit if they put Freddy Fazbear in the game. 
---
Not saying it’s a bad idea, just saying it would be legit frightening. 
---
Does this mean he has cameras everywhere watching you and only appears when you’re not looking?!?!
---
Yeah I’d much rather take that or range add ons. I don’t understand all the people who suggest block addons when they are missing out on the utility just about all his other addons provide.
---
Meg's scream is the worst btw. I wish they made it so Iron Will affected her hooking screams. Would run that until the end of time.
---
We could make a religion out of this
---
The skill jump from 11 to 20 isn't that severe.
---
I'm a killer main, I hate being toxic, instantly makes me feel bad lol. Even when survs "deserved" it, I don't ever camp or tunnel, whatever. Though it's really, really satisfying  to catch  a toxic surv as he's jumping into the hatch. 
---
I don't see a lot of them though. Maybe 15-20%. I've heard it's total aids when you're a killer in ranks 1-4. 
---
I just wish players were a bit nicer to each other. Teabagging at the gates is not necessary at all. And don't even get me started on DC's... Legion's my main so I get to see a lot of them.  I wish it was different, I know it could be annoying to play against him, but man I'm just trying to keep it fun for both sides. It's not fun to play against 2 survs. 
---
Weird. It never plays after I install it each time I upgrade to a new pc. Then never again. 
---
Oh yeah I def. agree that it keeps other survivors from actually saving and that's what's shitty about doing it. 
---
I can just imagine the game crashing everytime you open it
---
"Error: intro.mp4 not found"
---
(Don't know the real file name)
---
u/tot3ntanz you’re gay
---
Which means it’s reportable and bannable
---
Haven't played dbd in ages, what is that lamp over there?
---
Post-game scoreboard. To the right of each person’s name is a thumbs up/down button
---
If the game is shot due to inactive players or I'm being farmed by some random fucked.
---
Promoting means you get rewarded for harder work. This is a demotion.
---
Don't know what to say about that but he is a weak killer, there are tons of people that think so and usually the ones that say he is strong don't know how to play against him or can't hit skill checks there are things you can do to make him strong like iridescent king but overall I would say he is mid or weak
---
Then you just reinstall *shrug*
---
People do that no matter what killer you pick anyway. I was playing Freddy for the dream chaser daily and after letting the team idiot drop pallets for me to break and snowballing my fire up and getting looped for half the match I finally got lord trollzor in the dying state and as soon as I got the .twitch dude on the hook he dc’d. The other three followed suit. 
---
P.S. To show how much I like killers that are garbage, I’d still main Freddy if it weren’t for the fact that you can’t hatch grab without them in the dream state. Can locker grab. But no hatch. His own power ruins everything for himself. 
---
Oh I know it was more of a joke
---
Well their salt is all the reward i need :D
---
Wow, this actually happened to me too, same map, playing as Feng, against a Freddy...
---
New desync bug?
---
R1 killers pick the three gens they are going to defend in the late game when the match starts. You have to make sure you get good placement in late game.
---
Yes, so it is risk versus reward
---
WHAT
---
I had this happen yesterday. Heard huntress coming so I hid in the locker. She started walking towards me and I thought I was done for. She checks the locker next to me which apparently a no mither David was in and the fucker disappeared like Houdini. Then ace disconnected. Then claudette let herself get downed and killed herself on hook. Survivors are pathetic.
---
Exactly. It’s fun sometimes to have a swarm of bees- but only for me and the other 3 survivors, the poor shmuck getting slugged into hook farms is probably depressed.
---
Some killers look at it like giving the middle finger, so it’s kinda like game on buddy. So they get tunnel then cue salt 
---
You:  "Checkout these badass, custom accessories that were made for me because I'm a fan!"
---
Everyone else:  "Your choice sucks!"
---
People are so whiny.  You could replicate one of many swords in a game, and everyone would whine about the sword's stats.  xD
---
It is God Teir. Their only escape. One lives, one is forced to quit and leave his corpse in a dirty bathroom. This whole thing is made better since is was The Pig and on the Game. 
---
Do you have the will to sacrifice yourself and let your friend escape. Or does greed corrupt you, as is always has, and let them suffer the consequences for your actions.
---
Live or Die. Make your choice. (Saw Theme Plays)
---
I revised some attributes of the killer. What’s your opinion on the changes? (If you looked at them)
---
I never got a reply back from them :/ 
---
What about 4 SWF party with voice comm, flashlights, DS, gen rush? Trolling and teabagging you the entire game, then be like GG EZ in end-game chat. Pardon my salty killer main tears. 
---
We could make an anime out of this
---
It’s called “dribbling” and it’s not bannable, if that’s what you’re asking. 
---
Neither is gen tapping during Ruin either. 
---
Part of the current in game event for free cosmetics. 
---
Haven't actually thought about pop goes the weasel, I've got the teachable so all I would have to do is level my nurse. Surveillance helps me so much tho, it completely screws over those survivors who get back on the gen the second you leave
---
What do you consider losing a match?
---
He’s not fat he T H I C C.
---
There is absolutely nothing bad about juggling. I encourage anyone to do it if you know the enemy has decisive strike. It's a strategy, plain and simple.
---
He's the most skilled DBD streamer I have seen so far. He's the only one with my subscription.
---
Lol its deleted but some things are better left a mystery.
---
Hooray!
---
I win a good handful of games and I do not run BBQ and Chili.
---
my longest fight was about 90 minutes (killer vs a toxic meg, and i was playing referee lol). they both refused to leave bc it would show weakness apparently :D.
---
Watch Umbra\_bug on Twitch she's DBD's #1 Huntress and she's awesome. She gives a lot of helpful tips, trust.
---
I’m concerned about the knife bro. You shouldn’t kill ppl 
---
It's so annoying man, it makes everyone sound so whiney.
---
"Ohh but Legion break the core mechanics of the game!!"
---
Okay but so do Nurse and Huntress.
---
"I hate holding M1 the whole game and he always gets me!!"
---
Doctor makes it borderline hard to be stealthy against him. His power makes you hold M1 too with some skill checks, Same with the Pig, AND EVEN LESS SO WITH FREDDY. You literally  hold M1 for 2-3 generators anyways, you do it for opening an exit gate, you do it for Self Caring, you use it to break out of the dream world.
---
"All he does is tag me with Frank's and break chase and moon walk, it's okay cheesy!"
---
Yes we know it's Bullshit but if that person was on **any other killer** he would've just been an asshole on that killer. He could use omega blink Nurse, he could use Insta Down Hatchets on Huntress, Mint Rag + Make your Choice Hag, Infinite T3 Myers, Dying Light Black Box Freddy, ect, the list goes on.
---
There's so much more annoying shit in the game. People don't realize that if he's chasing you and trying to stab you 3 timessage while you're looping a 110% MS killer, he's wasting so much time, more time than your average killer. He's only good in a chase, his map pressure fucking sucks, it's not that hard to just waste his time, to where he'll just leave you alone or make him regret chasing you for 2-3 gens.
---
No. Jeff is Thicc Boi. 
---
Omg, I don't remember Tom ever looking this disgusting.  Haha
---
This ^
---
They aint gonna get banned for t bagging at the gate, hit them out
---
I hope your family know this is a hobby or they’d be rather worried...
---
you got me, i main him bc i like him in the movie
---
What Killer are you using? 
---
What is your current loadout of perks?
---
 Are you using add-ons and if so which ones?
---
Are you tunneling or camping just one person?
---
Are you applying enough map pressure?
---
What tactics are you using when you play as Killer?
---
That would genuinely be one of the funniest things i could have hoped to see.
---
How wholesome would it be tho?
---
*QUENTIN MAINS RISE*
---
Thats all i ever want for him :3
---
He's, uh, European.
---
Not every addon or power actually has that information available though. Like for Wraith, the green swift hunt addon page on the wiki gives you an exact number (35%) but the purple addon only says "tremendously reduces." The difference between yellow and green swift hunt is 5%, so maybe it's 40%? Maybe it's more. Dunno.
---
Or like Boyfriend's Memo for Myers says it increases the tier 1 lunge by 10%, but I have no clue what the actual hard number for that lunge is. I don't think it's listed anywhere.
---
It's weird and pointlessly obtuse.
---
That doesn't let you give any information. I'm fine with t-bagging, D strike, firecrackers, pallet looping, even running circles around me so I can't hit them...sure it's irritating but as long as gens are being done it's fair game. The part that is bannable by the dbd teams definition is holding the game hostage, when they absolutely refuse to leave despite both exit gates being open. There is nothing i can do to stop them from keeping the game going way longer than it should.
---
When I saw the official post earlier, I thought they said they made it so that if the killer DC’s, you still get event points for carrying the lantern. Or something about the host disconnecting. 
---
Thats isnt but i agree, wtf is with that right?
---
/thread
---
Holding the game hostage is reportable using the exact method I said above
---
When you give the one non-toxic survivor the hatch while the rest fume that they didn't get it. 
---
Just put Brenda in the game as the first Survivor who can talk ffs
---
He did dont worry but we got it done.
---
Git outta muh swamp!
---
Ruin is a joke anyway. Hence why I don’t even bother running it. Didn’t like the spirit so I don’t plan on getting her hex guardian perk. So, fair is fair. Dribble that Feng Min and Jake like Michael Jordan. 
---
They have to be at the gate for that. They were taking advantage of the fact that I had never used the killer and was still trying to get the hang of her swing meaning I couldn't hit them or if I did they would run away lose me and heal while the others tried to distract me. 
---
I crushed their hopes and dreams of me painting Dutch landscapes long ago..
---
I have 330 hours with a pretty even split. I can confirm that on a per-game basis, more toxicity comes from the survivors. Most of what's considered "Toxic" on the killer side is just normal gameplay, with few exceptions such as literal facecamping where the killer and survivor are so close I swear they're about to kiss, and maybe hatch standoffs. Survivors definitely have more chance to be toxic, with teabagging, flashlight clicking and purposefully stalling the game. Though I would say that it's also not just between killer and survivor, survivors can also be toxic to each other with sandbagging, unhook farming, giving away another survivor's position on purpose (pointing or pebble) and so on.
---
All in all, people are just a\*\*holes sometimes.
---
THE OTHER PERSON IS RIGHT, SELF CARE ALWAYS 50% HEAL SPEED. THE HIGHER LEVELS JUST INCREASE MEDKIT EFFICIENCY
---
As a survivor main that shit pisses me off like just leave...it fills me with great joy when I escape and spectate just to watch them get killed lol!
---
The hatch mechanic has always been considered broken. Will they ever do anything about it? Only time will tell.
---
Yeah, that's been a problem for quite a while. There's nothing you can do besides try to out-stubborn the other side. And not get distracted, of course.
---
Explains why are you noob, just forget about the match, bad games happen and don’t let it get to you.
---
Sorry, but I disagree, I think that High Skill Ceiling shouldn't be a reason to not talk about these things.
---
Also, IIRC, being a Large/Tall killer isnt a bad thing, but a mixed thing. He can be spotted more easily, but has a better view of the map. That would make the Height of a killer a Skill-Thing too.
---
And a power being an arching skill shot means you have to practice, not being weak.
---
Killers shouldnt be balanced in a way to compensate for "hard" or "high skill" "problems", but balanced while thinking about Maximum Potential.
---
Killers should be harder to play, but devastating on right hands, as Truetalent with Nurse,
---
Thank you, I recently updated the chapter to better fit things people can accept.
---
It also won't work if they use their ears. Hearing firecrackers go down is pretty easy, so if they're smart, they'll look up.
---
Then again, this works all too often on killers because they get lazy.
---
So much SLOW in this picture, picking up, hooking, placing trap.
---
I modeled it in Maya and printed it out on a 3D printer 
---
At this time, nearly any fix they could implement will be either too in favor of the killer or the survivor. 
---
Killers have been kicking and screaming for the “hatch close” ability that was on PTB and never went live. 
---
Survivors want to be able to jump in without having their action interrupted. Which tbh... it IS really shitty when you see your entire character model vanish into the hole yet magically reappear in the killers hand. 
---
I don’t know what the fix is, but I do hope they come up with something that’s actually balanced. 
---
That’s true. I had more success with the last event
---
^what ^in ^the ^goddamn ^fuck
---
That's a 2v1 with 2 gens left. I'm ruling it an acceptable Narnia. They ain't both gettin' out.
---
The thing I hate the most is people saying "baby killer"
---
Also, I feel like the killers are often as toxic as survivors (I'm a killer main btw).
---
I love that one,thanks
---
Survivors should be harder to play, like &lt;insert streamer here&gt; with Dwight. 
---
I just wanted you to read what you just said in context. 
---
A.) Killer difficulty is bad enough when it's 1v4.
---
B.) Saying anyone should have a harder time playing while survivors vault windows, drop pallets, and run around with flashlights and BNPs is silly. 
---
They arent going to be banned cause you cant chase them for whatever reason
---
He might pronounce it "F**oh**nt" instead of "F**ah**not"
---
So the survivor is just supposed to jump in the hatch knowing the killer is going to grab them? What part of the standoff is the problem? I think the killer is just as much at fault as the survivor is. They’re both hijacking/camping at that point. 
---
&gt;That's the way this game plays at it's core though is survivors running and ***hiding*** from killers?
---
Yes, I fully agree. And Legion forces players to utilize stealth and distraction tactics instead of running around in a circle yelling [this](https://youtu.be/bJINv6ffO00?t=5).
---
&gt;hiding only works until someone near you is hit.
---
Then don't stay near other survivors?
---
Considering killers already have perks to regress generators, I don’t think we need anymore in the game. Not to mention, undo hook sabotage? It’s so rarely used these days anyway because it takes so damn long to do, unless you’re running breakdown, which doesn’t prevent you from being hooked anyway. 
---
You're new you shouldnt expect to win all the time. 
---
Someone explain please. 
---
Since when did people complain about juggling decisive strike users? It's the only semi decent way killers can handle decisive strike
---
I literally just played a match where someone was hooked and was waving their arms. The killer (doctor) was on someone else. 
---
Sadly this “arms up means camping” wasn’t in any playbook or tutorial for people so not everyone knows. 
---
It's just the nurse in her new skin
---
IT FUCKING SUCKS ON PS4 PRO TOO! IT'S THE WORST WHEN YOU HIT A SURVIVOR AMD THEN NEXT FRAME THEY ARE GONE LIKE FUCKING MAGIC NO SCRATCH MARKS OR ANYTHING... HIT THE FUCKERS SO HARD THEY TELEPORT. FUCKING BROKEN ASS GAME... AND FUCK BHVR AND THEIR "OPTIMIZATION" IN DECEMBER LIE
---
I have one. Let them dc if they dont wanna play against you. It hurts them not you OP. Just smile and move on to the next game. 
---
Watch some YouTube videos on gameplay styles. Monto and hybrid panda are both good. 
---
Self care is awful, yet, it's the most used perk?🤔 And apparently I wasn't paying much attention. English isn't everyone's first language.
---
The only "proof" is that the devs have stated the next Killer will be the oldest in the game - older than Huntress (who became a Killer during or slightly after World War I). 
---
There's as much evidence that it's Jack the Ripper as there is for a vampire. Personally, I'm just excited to see what comes out.
---
420 shards, level 69
---
420 shards. Player level 69
---
Could be a bug. I played some KYF recently as a survivor and the killer disappeared. I was facing only the red stain. And it was Doc BTW.
---
I have no clue what caused it, but it happened and that makes me think you got the same bug, but reversed (killer stayed but red stain dissapeared). I suppose it happens during some specific action and is very rare (?)
---

---
 Nice.
---
Not Nurse. But that's what her power is for.
---
That and the bloodwebs weren't hotfixed - they've only now adjusted the envelope spawn rate.
---
Ah I see now, my bad
---
Eh I don’t care too much. I’ll take me 3-600 bp for hitting them out
---
Standing in front of you spinning where you can chase and hit them is hardly holding the game hostage. Hostage taking is if they are sat on a rock or something where its impossible to reach them
---
It just sucks cuz I waited awhile for a game, get all hyped to play and use some good items and offerings and it gets wasted cuz my team just gives up ):
---
What if the killer was just trying to kill them? 
---
I’m on PS4 but I honestly send a lot of messages to people after games. Some of them GGs to incredible games from either side, some of them playfully taunting a killer for camping (“Did you bring the s’mores? For your campfire?”) Occasionally to just discuss how the game went. I may be in the minority but I wish ps4 had a post game chat! Even if it’s a lot of salt I love being able to talk to people about the game.
---
I played a few hundred hours of killer and haven’t encountered anyone calling me baby killer, except once sarcastically.
---
Oh boi, that was sexy
---
A group of 4 friends playing together and making it impossible for you to actually get them when the exit gate is open and waiting for them is taking the game hostage because the survivors have the choice to leave but the killer doesn't have an option to end the game without losing all blood points and event progress
---
Imagine being stupid enough to equivocate DCing from a match and leaving lobbies 
---
This seems a bit far fetched to be a survivor perk to be honest. 
---
I use  vanity mirror with whispers, nurse’s calling, sloppy butcher, and monitor &amp; abuse.  So much fun just running around and not letting anyone heal for like 5 minutes then going off somewhere to hide and surprise them again. 
---
It has nothing to do with the character or her cosmetics. It has to do with the majority of the people playing her. Like I said, about 95% of the people I encounter playing Claudette are toxic assholes that purposely try to get the rest of the survivors killed. They do maybe one gen, and that's it. The rest of the time they either hide, or try to get everyone else killed so they can take the hatch. I'm almost always farmed off the hook in front of the killer by a Claudette. I get body blocked all the fuckin time by them, I've seen them working with the killer ratting out where everyone is. Etc.
---
It's horrible. 
---
All I can hear in my head is the Penguins of Madagascar "You didn't see anything"
---
It does suck yeah but at the same time - you can easily acquire those items again. People just hate certain killers. Like I hate The Spirit with a passion - I've screamed and cried in fear facing her. I sometimes dc depending on whats going on. It hurts no one but me. 
---
Not so different from things that already exist in the game. Alert for instance has no limit, and every time the killer makes a break action they see the killers aura. 
---
Lol, I find Nurse’s not too useful personally, I’d rather run something like Haunted grounds for those cheeky moments
---
Its not imposdible for you to get them wtf are you on about. Chase them and Hit them out
---
There are a lot of Killers playing right now, so matchmaking is borked. Unfortunate, but the alternative is waiting an hour for a game.
---
In the meantime, I suggest leveling Doctor - he's good for bloodpoints right out of the gate (meaning you don't need BBQ yet) and his teachables are solid.
---
Or play some Survivor to grind out bloodpoints until you have decent perks on a Killer you want to play.
---
I prefer survivors carrying fireworks or flashlights over toolboxes or keys, its easy to predict and it even tells you that people will be near you when you pick a survivor
---
Well I update my original post btw in terms of how often this ability can be used, so check that out. 
---
I say if a killer trips it, it activates, period, no matter who it is. Alter still works on all those killers, even tier 1 Micheal. 
---
Which is weird because Premonition doesn’t work on tier 1 micheal. If he’s coming around a wall, you won’t know he’s there, but you’ll know for every other stealth killer in the game. 
---
I playe league ( i know im cursed), and they have a toggle option to see more detail in the descriptions. Maybe they should do that. I could see them not wanting the game to lean TOO FAR in that direction though and become too competitve and not for fun (which i think is what they are going for \[fun\]).
---
This game isn'tt really competitive though....
---
I mean, if you want to bring a ton of friends/get a group of people who want to do the sweatiest, try-hardiest things possible on both sides? Good on you, sure.
---
But you don't get to go into a world wide game mode in a game with no actual competition and expect everyone else to play the same way.
---
Now if we can ban Noob3 too....
---
Don't DC
---
To the killers that lobby dodge me because they don’t want to play against me or someone with me. 
---
You guys are assholes.
---
Ya see both sides have the same issue, it’s just one has to wait for the match to start to choose whether or not to play.
---
When you start a game with 5 gens remaining and someone instantly dc’s it hurts the other three that have been waiting to play cuz we’re at a huge disadvantage
---
Same goes for then a survivor misses their decisive and dcs because of it
---
I'm going to say there is probably "I Ran" by Flock of Seagulls 
---
is this a new perk on the ptb?
---
they really need to give people who dc a timer that doesn't let them play for a certain amount of time
---
Ben Shapiro bad fake news good 
---
That sounds so much worse when you read Meg's lore.
---
A family can be a Dwight and his two lesbian moms &lt;3
---
"I have nothing to do with my life but shit on other people's accomplishments, I'm a TROLL!" 
---
Also, addons:
---
\- For range ONLY the ***Mouldy Electrode*** (anything more makes it take waaay too long to charge up, so unless you do a railgun Doc then don't)
---
\- Besides that, pretty much every addon is good (except ***Maple Knight***, you don't need that)
---
\- BUT, what I love the most and use almost every game if I can is the combination of: ***Scrapped Tape*** &amp;  ***Interview Tape*** (This is soooo great. It makes you fire a big circle and a long thin line instead of classic shock. It does not increase the charge time so that is a BIG plus. Takes some time getting used to but is actually amazing -&gt; When a survivor is running in a line or to a pallet you zap him thanks to the extra range (20m) from ***Interview Tape***. If they are at a pallet or behind a corner the circle from ***Scrapped Tape*** will get them. If they try to juke you to miss, then they are just more likely to run into the weird shock pattern. Again, takes some time to get used to but is amazing.)
---
* Ace in the Hole - I've always been good at finding cool shit
---
* Aftercare - Gotta take care of each other if we're going to make it in this world.
---
* Balanced Landing or Lithe - I might seriously be part mountain goat. (Not sure which would fit better.)
---
* Calm Spirit - Not a whole lot rattles me.
---
Not the worst build, all in all - but I'd rather have Quick and Quiet than Calm Spirit (trouble is: I'm neither).
---
Well, I think there was some random percentage addon back when they first released and if you'd buy for 5 euros you'd get some bonus like I dunno, 143 cells or something and when I used them up those 3 were left I think :/
---
I actually didn't downvote you. I only do that with people who are being rude. And even with the nerf it is still way too risky to not run Self Care. Plus with Botanic Care now it is really good and better then most other perks.
---
Why not be mad at the devs for ruining the game? The survivors dc because they want to have fun like u and legion isnt fun for them.
---
No wonder the killer isn't camping 
---
Nurse’s only really helps when you’re fully committed to the assholery. What i like to do is hurt everyone i can as fast as possible and then kinda pick out which 3 gens i want to patrol at the end of the game so i’ll just float around and force survivors to do the farther “safer” gens. Since dead rabbit makes your terror radius smaller than the nurse’s distance you can spot people before they even hear you. Most of the time people will heal immediately after they escaped you so i give a nice 20-30 second chase and back off but i hide behind the walls and shit and i use whispers to follow them if they get too far. It’s so much fun
---
 sprint burst robs the killer of a hit they would otherwise get for free - at the expense of having to walk around the map to avoid using it needlessly
---
self care cancels out the damage the killer inflicted on you for free - at the expense of 30s or longer of doing nothing, and being vulnerable to nurse's calling
---
decisive strike allows you to get out of the killer's grasp for free - at least you should be able to tell if they have it because they're the obsession. and you can attempt a juggle if u want
---
borrowed time allows you to rush in for a free save - this is designed specifically to counter excessive camping, and can be countered by targeting the rescuer instead
---
unbreakable allows you to recover from the dying state for free - at the expense of it being a useless perk if the killer hooks them immediately
---
i'm not disagreeing with what you're saying about NOED, but almost everything in the game (except maybe mori) has some level of counterplay.
---
Yes survivors love free wins, that’s why the hatch is still in the game.
---
I make a concious effort to make sure the immersed, hiding survivors die every game. You know, the people who can’t do anything but hide and flounder the second they’re found?
---
I’m referring to my teammates, I dont have a problem with the killers dodging because the match doesn’t start when that happens.
---
I’ve also not been dodged that much by killers, I try not to play like a dick because I know how hard playing killer is.
---
I respect that
---
Not really the same issue considering you can just hop into another lobby after getting dodged, DC's suck because you'll either lose items or depip. Like of you get into a game and 2 people DC right away, you have zero chance of of coming away with a positive game.
---
Smack 'em and be done with it. A hatch escape isn't a win, it's a consolation prize.
---
oh that sucks :/ work is amazing tho
---
WHY DOES EVERYONE DC WHEN I DOCTOR IT UP
---
They’re both legit. As a fellow killer, if you slug someone you best know where the 4th is already and need that time. If you’re slugging to then go and look, expect the dc hatch. Honestly both sides to this arguement are dumb - the whole arguement is still killer sided since once downed they really don’t have a baseline way up. 
---
Yeah but I'm talking about good survivors. Wraith can't do anything with his ability during chase except maybe cloak and unclear to trick people, but that's only with add-ons. I want these killers to be able to do more things during chase, more mind-game potential to make the killer more interesting to play. Sure you can do good with all killers, but it's not that fun to have your ability to be "activate power and wait 7 seconds". It's just boring. I want both more fun and viable killers to pick
---
Nerfing Decisive Strike is relatively easy - just apply a bleed-out timer a la Borrowed Time. That way it's not just a free extra chase with no counterplay.
---
WHERE ARE MY EVENT POINTS!
---
I gotta start drawing again!
---
Woo! 
---
If Mike Wasoski and the Wraith have a child. 
---
League of Legends does it best - escalating timers following both queue dodges and disconnects (the latter are much longer).
---
I love it. Seriously it’s creative and gives room for the survivor to have a cool mysterious backstory rather than- athlete/nerd/soldier/ investigator did their occupation, trapped by psycho, pulled into campfire
---
The masks can go with any body cosmetic, there is no restrictions  for that.
---
Yes. The mask is basically the top/head accessory. So anyone can wear any mask. 
---
Keep practicing is all you can do 
---
I need to do same but she is so frustrating.
---
In the entity’s name what is happening in here ?
---
I hope so.  Got to banish the P3 Crawldettes back to rank 17 where they belong 
---
Hey thanks!
---
Yes, rank worthless
---
[Footage of a similar situation with me.](https://youtu.be/eBa4_nVtjeQ?t=34)
---
Pretty much this - the Hag knew magic before becoming a Killer; there's nothing suggesting survivors couldn't have magical abilities.
---
Or a technically minded survivor could rig up a simple pressure plate with an alarm - or even a tripwire with some bells on it. Doesn't need to be anything super-fancy.
---
On PC just click the arrow pointing right next to your text box in the post game chat.
---
Don't know how it works on console though.
---
BBQ &amp; Chilli as well as survivor pudding or bloody party streamer 
---
Baseline boxes should be 1, unadjusted via addons it should roll a random integer of 1-5, and that's the box you remove the hat on.
---
Addons should add to that integer, an ultra rare adds 2, a yellow/green adds 1, so if you ran both at minimum they're getting their helmet off on the 4th box.

---
I'd never noticed. Thanks!
---
TRUE
---
You shouldve done it like the Trapper did in one of the trailers for maximum spook
---
So you miss a hit and isnnot your fault? My man.
---
This is the cutest thing ever
---
Where are you seeing that Premonition doesn't work on EW1 Myers? It specifically says "overrides *all* Killer stealth abilities."
---
Did you know that 95% of the percentages on the internet are made up ?
---
Thanks! I’m glad you like it!
---
No One Left Behind: I wouldn't leave a friend behind even if I were to die on their stead
---
Sprint Burst: I can run pretty fast at first but my stamina is trash
---
Adrenaline: In the heat of the moment I can ignore a lot of pain and get a surge of energy
---
Decisive Strike: I ain't no bitch and would try and fight back with all that I had available to me
---
♥ 
---
I dunno why people downvoted this it’s true. Most good killers don’t even need it, when I see a killer who’s done shit all game I know a noed is coming. However if you use noed on a killer who can insta down please, try harder.
---
Hatch standoff has nothing to do with players and is 100% bad game design
---
Claudette is known for her ability to blend in with her surroundings so they’re joking like you can’t see her :B
---
Steam&gt;Steamapps&gt;common&gt;dead by daylight&gt;deadbydaylight&gt;content&gt;movies is the path
---
Yeah especially when their teammates didn’t do shit. 
---
These new killer perks are getting harsh.
---
Dbd on hardcore mod 
---
Maybe the devs should delete legion
---
Now imagine if the reason you heard the heartbeat was because the killer was hiding INSIDE the locker and you, unknowing, went inside to hide... only to be downed instantly. This is why we need Ghostface in the game. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk!
---
Maybe just take a compliment when you get one lol
---
Bro this community is full of needledick crutch users.  Every downvote it a baby killer running noed 
---
YOU'RE RIGHT OMG DUDE TO BALANCE IT OUT WE SHOULD MAKE NOED PART OF THE BASE KILLER LOADOUT AND REMOVE THE HEX PART!! 
---
The wiki has a good archive of the shrine, but if anyone's really that curious they can check the subreddit's archives.

I had a strange thought in my head where Ace just goes to one of the killer zones outside of a trial and just tells the killers shitty jokes and funny stories until they laugh
---
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT, ORDER MATTERS?!
---
No nurse is particularly hard on console because of the poor frames. Yes put the sensitivity up a bit however the frames is what's going to have the negative effect on the gameplay especially on corn maps during a chase. I got the hang of her on PS4 but the frames make it a struggle 80% of the time so I find it not worth even playing her. Soon as the game gets optimized expect to see many nurses, or at least more people trying to learn her.
---
No Mither because I'm retarded
---
Diversion because I act retarded
---
Thanatofobia because I'm bad at math
---
Lithe because I never act when I'm expected to
---
There's no voice chats as it is, it's a third party software being used.
---
But if trapper ran honing stone, who’s laughing now?
---
You, the pleb without no mither, or meg, the stud with no mither??
---
I wouldn't say worthless, it's just not guaranteed that every rank 1 player is good.  
---
But in general there are more good players in red ranks than in other ranks. You wouldn't believe how bad most rank 10 players are
---
*shirtless Myers*
---
Honestly it would be so much better if it just did something like autocomplete a gen so you can get a quick hatch escape.
---
Why 
---
OMG this combines two of my favorite things because I'm a quirky gamer girl and a quirky theatre nerd! I'm so quirky!
---
just made a lobby and got 4 survivors in less than 20 seconds
---
Happened to me a month ago twice as survivor and once as killer with pallets not showing and HUD not showing. Thankfully never experienced it again.
---
Less than 2mins for me
---
Instant when i play survivor.
---
Might just be your location or rank, the latter being more likely.
---
well thats stupid 
---
How is a guranteed hit if you get stunned a good idea? LOL
---
Not guaranteed like maybe he meant throw it a little after so then the survivor has time to go away I’m thinking balanced here ok
---
I fucking love this meme format. 
---
I had a chase with that guy that lasted like 2 minutes. I didn’t do good but enough to get the 4k.
---
The exact opposite works for toxic killers too lol
---
Oh damm. It's not like my idea will become an actual character. I just want to have fun and share ideas. But thank you for your criticism 
---
I didn’t know who it was and I forgot to add that. Sorry and thank you for that. ^^’
---
Best boy since 2016.
---
i want to get stabbed with that knife ;')
---
What if she calls her hachets "my love"
---
I was aboutta ask why billy is wearing Freddy’s sweater too lol.
---
Man you can tell if a killer is running noed 90% of the time because they play badly all game good killers have no need to run it, I personally feel scummy running dstrike or noed, if your a decent player there's no need, and to further that noed is 10 times more effective than dstrike anyway, think of all the noed clutches in comparison to the dstrike clutches 
---
Puppers for me also this image is extremely cursed
---
If you're injured, absolutely. Any part way decent killer should be using headphones. Survivors make a lot of incidental noises. Also you will slowly pool blood through the bottom of the locker door.
---
I tend to overlook lockers and I've actually wasted time hunting around a locker because I can hear an injured survivor then suddenly realised where they are 
---
Wholesome
---
Love how the saw is just in his arm and there is no blood.
---
Imagine, being mad that a SWF group can't instantly do all but one generator instantly anymore. I guess if it's not literally broken, it's not good anymore. 
---
opened 3 chests, all firecrackers in it :)
---
The glitch was losing DS if that happened. Drops and hooks always take priority. Even if he hit the skillcheck, if the hook vacuum was already initiated, DS won’t activate

I don’t even know how to respond to this
---
A Claudette did this once, preventing other from saving a hooked David and alerting the killer to the whereabouts of other survivors trying to save David. 
---
I’m almost 100% sure it’s additive and not multiplicative.
---
Just to play Claudette advocate, is it possible her internet just took a shit? There's been times when I've hid in lockers to try and just wait out some lag and then been kicked out. 
---
Oh, fuck me. Sorry. 
---
Absolutely. But I just think it’s more fun to think of it as a disconnect. 
---
Yeah they took a fucking night class in engineering between trials lol
---
I can see the print screen key *in the picture* goddammit

I'm gonna be pissed if it does
