Clearly you don‚Äôt understand what trolling is. Can‚Äôt wait for the day all these 13 y/o‚Äôs reach puberty lmfao

---
---
Increased repair hearing distance is going to be a massive boost for killers. Imagine Myers/Legion/Hag with Monitor and Abuse being able to hear you before they‚Äôre even close enough for you to hear his heartbeat.
---
They clearly want Ambush to be used more often, the buffs there are nice, but they comes at the expense of The Pig's already-poor map pressure since they increased the terror radius and you'll presumably be spending more time crouching. 
---
Another stealth survivor buff. What a surprise.
---

---
I have to say I've just had my first survivor game now and this feels stupid. At one point me and a Feng - both injured - found each other. I thought about healing her and then realized there's literally no point. We might as well just stand there and heal ourselves. It was so bizarre to get used to.
---
I think there needs to be a benefit to being healed by another survivor as its harder to do.
---
It's treason then
---
Im glad all these changes are PTB. Some of them are gonna be super broken and hopefully get adjusted before the final patch.
---
You should, they're pretty good. Or if you want a cut down, kill countier version of the saw franchise, look up "Dead meat saw kill count " or something like that, they're pretty good too 
---
I'm loving this new feature too, they seem to be making Killers/Survivors feel more ''alive'' recently, as Clown was the first Killer to have facial animations and then the Spirit took that and made it even better, I didn't knew about Jeff's eyebrows, that was an interesting detail!
---
Kate must be hating how she lost her guitar... At least she can still sing though.

Next üëè Meme üëè

So if he didn't spend any money on a already paid game, he shouldn't stream it. Wow, you're rude as fuck dude. Also, you're*
---
So alleged guilt is just enough for wishing somebody to rot in jail? 
---
Voice chat. A killer cannot compensate for voice chat at higher ranks. And if you don't try to kill four why are you playing killer? That is why the game is "toxic" because people like you insist that the killers have to play by a code and that despite paying their money to have the game you insist they play it your way.
---
Perhaps you should stop moderating other players behavior and look at yours. If fun is the survivors always "winning" then you have a poor idea of what the game is about.
---
DBD
---
As a killer main i feel more fucked over tbh they removed my blood lust and my thick fog. Though its mainly bloodlust im upset about as a wraith its the only way i can beat loopers
---
Jake is Asian American though.
---
Not sure about the SC change. The Survivor side of me is loving this change because I also run BK.  The Killer side of me, however, is hating this change and praying that it stays in the PTB.
---
Why was Iron Maiden nerfed? Did it really need the location reveal to be shortened?
---
How are the new hook placements? I‚Äôm worried that if I down multiple Survivors near a hook, I will not be able to hook one of them. 
---
I‚Äôm really liking everything else, nice job BHVR! 
---
So first you need to bring a nearly useless perk to counter a perk that might not even exist in the game you're playing, then you need to do absolutely nothing but flawlessly sneak around the map, getting every single totem without being seen, while your teammates all get gens (and not getting caught, because that would cut your workforce in half), and then survive to endgame to make sure that all you work actually mattered.
---
Am I right?
---
Report the guy, what he did is bannable so yeah.
---
I uploaded links to every survivor here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adys7r/the_new_campfire_idle_animations_are_awesome/?st=jqoexyay&amp;sh=89ec4b73
---
Not every killer is for everyone.
---
I stick to Myers, Pig and Leatherface myself. Don't really touch many of the others.
---
We all have our preferred playstyle. Just gotta find the killer that befits yours :)
---
Killer is an uphill battle? Lol really?
---
Nothing too exciting in my opinion.
---
She must have lost it when she was dragged into the Entity's realm, she probably still can sing though.
---
Adrenaline (this) + Adrenaline (perk) + anti-hemorrhagi syringe + putrid serum + deja vu = drug overdose
---
I love a good challenge. Sometimes its quite easy to figure out what the killer is running though. Just gotta really pay attention. 
---
Such nice animations! Make them all seem more alive.
---
Have you watched how easy it is to troll killers and bombard them? It's not hard to make a game miserable for killers. The worst annoyance killers can do is drag the game out for longer. Even then it's variable, and sometimes amounts to less than ten seconds in game. But sure, be tone deaf.
---
If the entity‚Äôs willing to provide the survivors with Christmas firecrackers you‚Äôd think it‚Äôd have the decency to get her a guitar, huh.
---
Is it just me or is this PTB... not that big really. 
---
It fixes bugs and adds new ones as always. Couple minor balance things. 
---
Only thing that is worth testing are last 2 things. 
---
The devs literally designed this game to be played between people who can't communicate, they've stated so themselves. Plus, they put in SWF to stop people from complaining that they can't play with their friends, not to give people incentive to use voice chat. 
---
In case you haven't noticed, voice comms aren't in the game. Which leads to the next point: the post-game screen is meant to tell individual people what the killer and other survivors were playing. Not for one dead SWF to read off what the killer has to his or her buddies. Full stop. That's always been the intention, the devs are only just changing it now to force SWF to stop relaying the killer's build to each other.
---
It makes me so happy too! It makes them all feel so more alive.
---
The new spirit outfits jc... I can't handle it 
---
Benedict stuck his hand into it and it didn't burn him so IDK how Tapp's gonna get warmth from it 
---
Why are the imgur links always linked incorrectly?
---
That outfit looks so beautiful. Easily one of the best in the game
---
Good changes, but I'd also like to see tweaks to the RBT. 
---
I had a similar instant, let the guy crawl out, he replied "I juked you while crawling, hahahahaha"
---
Next time ima just hook em 
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah especially at high levels you know it‚Äôs gonna be a mix of the same 5-7 perks so there‚Äôs no guesswork there. 
---
Is it really taking advantage if you lose one of your teammates? Now you're at a disadvantage as the survivors.  -\('-')/- something something strength in numbers.
---
Noed 
---
Bites his nails as usual

Identity V-ish

*huntress hatchet*

Let me stop you right there
---
He's a chaser killer so run Hex:Ruin, bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring if u wanna be as optimal as possible
---
Ok you made you point about NOED. Care to explain DS?
---
What are the eyes?
---
 
---
Overcharge may be good.
---
I love this outfit for feng. Bout time she got some love üòç
---
What
---
Yeah your right. This never happens. 
---
Heal kept cancelling itself after every click
---
I know I'll get downvoted but a lot of the time I will not let my team mates heal me. This is because they'll sprint after me off the hook leave a massive trail and run after failing their skill check. Lot of the time I also feel like they could be off doing a Gen and not getting me killed and farmed.
---
What the fuck? Why is he praying, there is no reference to him praying or being religious whatsoever in the movies. Pretty lazy imo, must‚Äôve not had anything to do for him 
---
Wake Up
---
Wrong.
---
M&amp;A put her terror radius below the max range of Nurse's Calling, allowing you to see someone healing *then* crouch.
---
Okay those are one situation. What about the survivor that looped for 3-5 gens that got downed. What about the killer who has put everyone on the hook 2 times and didnt camp so the survivor got saved?
---
Hmm, well Sprint Burst isn't dependent on ping and execution like Dead Hard, and Balanced Landing literally can't be used on certain maps except at the basement stairs. So tell me how those are better than SB?
---
Wake Up! It's a Quentin perk that speeds up you opening the exit gates, and gives your aura to other survivors.
---
‚ÄúMy crutch perk reeeee‚Äù
---
OH NO I GOT GOT
---
Ahhh yeah I know what you mean now
---
How is it a buff to "everywhere else"?
---
It's literally just faster crouching!
---
No idea lol it's Reddit. See you got some downvotes too
---
How could they fucking buff self care
---
Not saying never. Some people are naturally born assholes but ive seen a lot more people be really thankful for it then spiteful and toxic.
---
Amazing! Thank you!
---
actually its last indefinitely(white color), and give a yellow color when regression stops for 8-12-16 seconds. before it only give the white color for 16 seconds or until the regression stoped.
---
I'm rank 17 and I get in to games pretty fast. But it does take longer if I'm playing with my bf who is rank 6 
---
Yes knowing the killer has Bloodwarden or Noed is a huge advantage, especially if you're only a premade of 2 or 3 you can be an extra eye on the survivor out of your premade.
---
Noeducation one could sad
---
It also happens with David and the red leather pants 
---
Yeah, at least the initial comment implying that sprint burst wasn't decent before is now also downvoted. Everybody's getting downvoted. 
---
He looks so fuckin handsome too omg
---
Yeah there was not much,his animation is rubbing his hands together and getting closer to the fire to get warm. 
---
Are you gonna fix the bug where Legion is absolute trash and no fun to play as or against?
---
Thats not my problem tbh. I play this way so its not my fault,when they die doing this. (Except when I already notice , that the killer is elsewhere)   
---
Cool. She's still not getting shit for Deviousness.
---
Because something needed to be done to make being injured against Legion a threat.
---
neat. when do you go pro?
---
Unrelated to the picture, your name is the word that I replaced the other word in your name with
---
I'm confused. I originally thought you were pro noed, but now I'm feeling you're not?
---
This sounds like some pussy shit Democrats would do. üòÇ
---
Could you link your twitter?
---
1*
---
I didnt read it as a buff tbh
---
As a wraith main i never found it more then a minor annoyance. They rarely get far with it and its once only. 
---
Hope someone uploads all of these, I‚Äôd love to see the personality they give to the different characters. Wouldn‚Äôt mind more of that, although I don‚Äôt know what they could add. 
---
I just realised I fucked up; I meant Adam.. oopsie
---
Nothing says I totally dominated you this game, but im not going to be a A-hole about it more than taking the last survivor to the hatch
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ive never seen someone complain when you hatch them though??
---
lol it‚Äôs fine
---
You heal faster. How is it not a buff
---
Niceeee
---
I think we've had a pretty bad time so far
---
I have seen them.  And they're almost always good.  And toxic. 
---
Yeah, I have noticed this as well.
---
Hopefully it is something that they can fix sooner rather then later.
---
Wait till I happens to you as killer. Then you will know true pain
---
I was wrong in my original comment anyways. The best detection perk is Whispers by a long shot. I'm just saying that there are way better detection perks than something that gives alerts based on crows. I mean, BBQ gives TONS of points and Rancor allows you to kill your obsession. Bit of a difference and I think you know that
---
This should IMO apply only to SWF groups, like if I die first i'd still like to know what i was playing against without waiting 10 to 20 minutes.
---
I only play killer in goal to kill ALL survivors. If just one survives I consider it a loss and I didn't do my best. If I only get two it's because the survivors were too damn good or the map didn't suit my killer well and I ended up having to tunnel one of them and kill him and the unlucky survivor that tried to save him. 
---
Need Monitor and Abuse
---
Yup. Purple rank too here , has been like that for some time now. After midnight I just can't find any games and after a few minutes it throws me into red ping lobbies . Eu btw
---
You missed the point. Of course killers should try to kill all 4, but that should be rare to actually happen. Most matches should have at least 1 survivor, if bot 2 survivors. That is balance.
---
Then make friends on Dead by Daylight. 
---
I say either you can carry them to a hook faster? (slight counter to ds) or stop the thing from going off before you get there and it cancels out boil over
---
This change shouldn't effect anything about vault hits. That's hitboxes and latency, not vaulting.
---
I do it if they didn't irritate me and they get less than 2 gens. If it's a slaughter I usually feel bad and let the last one finish all the gens and leave.
---
Or they could just make a casual mode and cater to people who just wanna mess around 
---
Sprint Burst can't counter most of the Killer's actions and forces you to walk around unless you're prepared to recharge it and spend some time being vulnerable. It was the best Exhaustion perk before the nerf to recharging Exhaustion, now it pales in comparison to other perks that can be activated during a chase when you need them.
---
Balanced Landing and Dead Hard will save a skilled player from a hit. Sprint Burst only saves bad players from hits, like the ones that still can't tell when the Killer, even a Pig or a Wraith, is close enough for you to run away.
---
I'm not sure if whispers is better by a long shot as I constantly see people upset the crows. Hell just standing still self healing sets them off. I realize Rancor and BBQ are different but again original spies was so good they nerfed it into Oblivion
---
It's a pretty nice thing to do. I always play as a survivor and I really appreciate it when killers do that 
---
So by your logic, a pleb who gets destroyed all game and then crutches on NOED is "pretty good at the game"? LUL
---
Tru3 lacks fundamental skills and knowledge of pallets, loops, flashlight counters, how to play around DS and Dead Hard etc etc. As I said, I've never seen a streamer be bullied so easily by such mediocre players.
---
I'm not wrong, you're just delusional "UwU"
---
No, why would we pretend that?
---
I'm just cracking up now at that while thinking about
---
Doing gens (-_-)
---
Hanging on a hook (-_____-)
---
Worst part is the phoenix shirt used to make them golden which got removed on the cosmetic update, I'd prefer if Feng's nails changed per cosmetic though tbh
---
What the fuck does PepeHands mean?!
---
I don‚Äôt even know if this has anything to do with the game, but I‚Äôve been getting more and more into watching people play dbd on Twitch and this constantly is said in chat
---
They always survive, They can't die
---
Whether they escape or not and gather more hope for the entity to feed on in a later match is another thing all together
---
Im telling you otherwise 
---
Source on them being denied the Scream license?
---
Amanda sits cross-legged, with her pig mask on, wondering when the survivors realize she's a Killer.
---
That 4000 co op points beats the 500 from using decisive, I‚Äôm team prove thyself to the day I DIE
---
Ahhh that‚Äôs hot
---
Doctor buff: Shock range increased by 160%, whenever Doctor shocks survivor, survivors get into dying state.
---
I bet it has to do with ptp hosting honestly. I could see this being a thing that's implemented when dedicated servers go through this summer. Here's hoping.
---
Think of it this way people
---
Did Laurie strode try and run around the kitchen table repeatedly before pulling the fridge over? No.
---
Did she try and get away and hide? Yes.
---
If you had a murderer in your house with a bloody knife, what would you do? Loop, or get the fuck away and try and lose them?
---
Hmmmmm
---
The thing is. Do you fear something that you can just run around a bunch of scrap with? Or something thats been on the other side of the room Stalking you despite the only entrance to the room being one doorway, or a loud drop you managed to miss because of the generator noise?
---
Do you fear something slowly waddling, or something that appears oma wae mo shindeiru style and yanks you off of the generator and slaps you on a hook?
---
What if it wasn't an in game feature because of limitations on the dev side? It is a small team after all. As for being able to strategize i think its 100% fair. If the killer gets to be so strong strategy is all you have as a survivor which apparently doesn't even work too well if the highest escape rate map has is 46% lol. I think we don't have voice chat in the game because we don't have dedicated servers. This game is laggy as hell already now imagine if it also had to keep a p2p voice chat system in play. The game would probably shit itself. Plus it was the first game in this kinda genre so i'm sure the devs didn't have a game plan yet going into it.
---
What about locker bug that traps survivor and unable to come out.
---
&gt;This is because they'll sprint after me off the hook leave a massive trail
---
I mean, in this situation it sounds like you're also running away from the hook, so unless you're running Lightweight you're leaving just as much as a trail as them, plus blood. Granted, the scratch marks are doubled up but they'll all vanish together.
---
&gt;and run after failing their skill check.
---
ok  yea, not much can be done about that
---
Good, because he's not getting re-worked, Legion is doing exactly what BHVR designed it to do; create chaos around the map, prevent killers from de-pipping with it's easy Chaser/Brutality point generation, and give survivors a non-threatening killer that earns them a ton of Altruism points. And allows them to sell more cosmetics. Legion checks all of their boxes. 
---
She looks nice, it's a nice drawing overall.
---
Imagine comparing those perks to noed Lmao. You can only make a case for DS and its not even worth running. 
---
Legacy? Dodge/mori is real man. New killers dodge prestige 3 survivors too.
---
I would support this if it only affected SWF premades. As a solo survivor I'm not gona wait until the end of the trial but id still like to know what i was playing against.
---
I have been using this exact set of icons for surivors as well as killers and item/item addons for a long time. I haven't been banned. I don't know if anyone cares either, but while I'm here I'm going to give myself a righteous self plug and plug my video on it. https://youtu.be/5SVA8GPLTKo
---
The video shows you how to do it as well as having links in the description for everything I used in the video. Shoot me a PM on here or on YouTube if anyone needs helps and I will try and help you, brothers.
---
Queue*
---
Don‚Äôt make the same mistake as I did and wait to level up David till the last second, his WGLF perk helps get a massive amount of bp, unlock its teachable and you‚Äôre good to go as it will help level up other survivors quicker. 
---
Yea honestly he‚Äôs got a point ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Her Deviousness buff was ok, but still *really* weak. It also doesn‚Äôt change that her traps do nothing towards deviousness after they‚Äôre applied. 
---
Didn't we just have wake up in the shrine like a week or two ago?
---
Pick up Sprint Burst and Overcharge if you want perks this Shrine, the other perks are too niche to really warrant using Iridescent shards on them.
---
If you really want to maximize shard efficiency, just pick up Overcharge if you play killer. You can get the Sprint Burst teachable  from Meg, who is a base game  survivor and also has Adrenaline (which is also amazing) and quick and quiet (which is good on certain builds). 
---
Disappointing shrine outside of SB and maybe Overcharge. 
---
I guess google still considers it in the top 10 resources for the question. Imagine how funny it would be to hear the killer saying, "Imma gunna getcha... Imma gunna getcha..."
---
They made it so that there's no difference between self-caring or getting heale (since everyone has self-care). Yes they're idiots.
---
Yea I'm actually bummed about this change. It sucks that this game has to be balanced around two different group of players: solos and swf. 99% of my games are solo, when I was learning the game seeing the killer perks and addons/offerings was crucial to my learning experience and now for the most part that is gone. I would not have waited around for the game to finish to see what setup they had.
---
This isn't set in stone and honestly nobody cares what you do on the hook.  People will save or not save no matter what,  throwing your arms up and down doesn't change a thing. 
---
But then all a dead SWF has to do is ask a solo survivor that died what the killer's build is, and then we have the exact same problem.
---
Was it possible to do that?
---
After 100 hours im confused pls someone explain...
---
he's such a cutie i love him
---
It is, I just think leaning is cool. Kinda like how I think crouching or going prone are cool. I know it‚Äôd never work, just fun to think about.
---
They sent the overall objective , more so a side objective.
---
its really annoying when you're running nurses calling and suddenly after the first death no one is healing anymore while in terror radius. In my opinion its an unfair advantage.
---
It has but for less time and I wasn‚Äôt savvy enough to do that 15 min screen record :(
---
How come they havent made the technician perk at t3 just make the generator silent but you still make the repair sounds your character makes 
---
Oi jeezus, i don't get some of these changes, some of the buffs and nerf are so random
---
*faints*
---
Thank you! Finally someone. I mean it's great that swf will no longer counter specific perks but why do they include solos? So stupid. I really hope they change it. 
---
Fair enough then I guess lol. 
---
Why should survivors have to waste precious generator time in order to remove a perk that might not even be there and get no reward for it?
---
Totems do not class as objectives because nothing is forcing you to do it to escape like generators.
---
If DS is annoying because it rewards bad players, then NOED also rewards bad players.
---
Oh, god forbid Killers have another good perk. It is nowhere near overpowered as is, especially when compared to some of the perks survivors have. 
---
&gt;make it so the killer can't see the survivors before the game starts because they can adjust their perks based on what they see on the survivors. Survivors don't know who the killer is till the game has started.
---
I mean... that's exactly what's intended. So no, they won't change that.
---
Thank you for the information! I‚Äôll take a look at Dwight 
---
What is SWF pls...
---
But, since it has been impossible to earn every single cosmetic from the blight event (and this probably also being the case with the upcoming event), I think it would be pretty unfair for those that want to get every cosmetic, since they wouldn't have any way of obtaining the remaining skins.

If you need help remembering some of the survivor names, here are some nicknames I made for them:
---
Clodette
---
Baked Jaked
---
Smug Face Ace
---
NutMeg
---
Tortilla Nea 
---
If you are getting cucked by these perks you need to get good. 
---
it means Survive With Friends
---
Gen at 76%: left
---
Dull totem: right
---
Ok shit I guess the best DBD players need to get good. 
---
And how did that make seeing killer‚Äôs perk possible?
---
Nurse/billy + bbq... *shudder*
---
At least lockers hide auras now, that helped a lot with that bs combo.
---
Hides in a closet
---
Yeah it almost does feel mandatory on killer. With surv you generally want an exhaustion perk but besides that the other 3 can vary a lot without you losing too much potential. When I play killer, it's like a choice between running bbq and NOED or just not having fun, and it's usually an easy choice.
---
That‚Äôs not Gen rushing you goon, that‚Äôs called doing the objective. Nothing is forcing you to save the guy on the hook other than points and ‚Äú-rep‚Äù while generators force you to do them because you physically cannot escape without doing at least 2.
---
Didn't think of it from that angle, it doesn't really make sense for them to stop solos from seeing it after, since it offers no benefits other than learning the perks as you said...
---
Myers needs to slow the game down. Since he doesn‚Äôt have much outplay with loops. 
---
My build right now is Ruin. Blood warden. Enduring. Spirit Fury. 
---
If you can slap people that are close. Do it. Just don‚Äôt always go for the stalk. Save your tier 3 for optimal use. For me I usually never tier 3 until after I hook someone to help after the map is shrunk from gens being popped. 
---
I agree they me be crutch perks but it doesnt mean they are bullshit. There is counter play for both. 
---
Ah you see when you get killed or escape you get the post game screen, there you can see the perks and add ons everyone used (survivors and killers) when you SWF you can communicate via voice chat the perks the killers have to your teammates in that way you can give a great advantage in countering the killer's strategy.
---
Oh my! Thanks for this information, this may help me or someone else:)
---
Dude relax lop, everyone in the game is running top teir meta including the killer, hes just noting the ultra rare items/add ons.
---
If OP was a survivor he would note if the killer used iridescent hatchets ok? Chill lol.
---
I think this is a fair change as it's kind of stupid that you can just tell your friends what the killer is running once you are dead if you are in Discord or whatever. I kind of wish they would change it for both sides though, so that the killer can't see what survivors are bringing in or whatever on top of this change. Just my .02
---
Ooooooohhhhh
---
Thank you intelligent living creature.
---
These are wonderful! Looking for forward to Freddy‚Äôs and Legions!
---
que
---
Well les say you spend all game destroying totems thinking they have NOED just for them to not have it. Now you just wasted your time for no reason. 
---
DS can only be countered with dribbling, which doesn‚Äôt 100% work all the time, and enduring which still gives the survivor a free escape. 
---
The style of these are honestly really well done. I would be interested in seeing all of them completely done. Nice work, man.
---
PC
---
Character Select
---
Last year's Howling Ground cosmetics unequipped themselves upon starting up the game. Happens every time
---
Hot, would love to see the schoolgirl spirit
---
That‚Äôs true, I used an xbox controller while I was waiting for a new keyboard and I kinda got used to it.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of these what happened 
---
No matter how good of a killer you are you cant guarentee that all gens will be finished before your first sacrifice. What if the killer hooked all survivors 1-2 times giving them a fair chance by not camping the hook?  I would think that killer deserves the kill.
---
To be fair they have made it clear that this is something that they're just experimenting with. Time will tell if this change in particular will come through and how strong it could be (they could always tune it down).
---
Doc is balanced right now. A little little bit on the weaker side but pretty balanced.
---
People complain about Doc because they cant Urban Evasion around the map with prestige 3 Claudette and have to rely on chases 
---
That doesn't change what I said at all. The killer only objective is to kill, just as a survivors main objective is to do tunneling and gen rushing are both stupid terms made up by salty players 
---
As if legacy means fuck all in this game. If you‚Äôre doeging cause you see legacy or priestiege clothes, you‚Äôre Garbo. 
---
There‚Äôs no equivalence or cosmetic to skill. So the reason it doesn‚Äôt need to go is there is no hinderance. What you need is a more valid and tangible reason for hiding something as silly as cosmetics. 
---
No but the term survivor means they ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù something. But they didn‚Äôt.
---
I've seen some streamers saying they 'see footsteps' (not scratch marks) - but I see nothing on their stream. A couple seconds later they find someone. Is there something I am overlooking? 
---
When you mess up on a gen and then hear a heartbeat
---
Yea definitely , I mean don't get me wrong for a shooter I wouldn't touch my gamepad with a 10 foot pole , but for a game like dbd where the mechanical requirement/precision needed is very low comfort is king.
---
That‚Äôs legitimately terrifying
---
Mostly happens when you dominate a set group then let the last guy escape. Happens a lot for me

there's at least 20 posts a day talking about queue times...
---
The clown looks awesome! (That sentence will never be said again!)
---
Hangman's Trick would be my choice in this one
---
Unneeded and stupid.
---
They somehow made Surveillance overpowered...
---
Too true. 
---
Yeah, the Scream franchise IIRC is in kind of wonky place and it's more than possible licensed Legion cosmetics wouldn't sell enough to turn a profit.
---
(Nice username and flair BTW)
---
With the fingers on his keychain 
---
&gt; objective is completing the generator
---
&gt; having a team with items aimed at that (as opposed to say, healing or blinding) isn't rushing gens though 
---
And general grammar. Actually, scratch this, I'm gonna fucking rewrite this so that it's actually readable.
---
So I'm a Survivor main, however I get more Killer rituals than I'm happy with. Today, one of my rituals involved the Trapper. The Survivors that I'm up against include a Laurie, Quentin, Ace, and Nea. I catch Quentin quickly, and he chooses to DC rather than go on the hook, and the Ace and Nea didn't really do anything of note, but the Laurie has Object Of Obsession, and tries to bait me into getting looped the entire game. Eventually, I down the Ace and he dies when the Nea isn't able to save him. I choose to slug the Laurie when she tries to draw aggro for the Nea, who I down and then sacrifice. The Laurie follows me, because if the Quentin hadn't DC'd they would have easily escaped since they had completed all but one generator, which of course means that the Hatch is open, so I bait her into getting too close to a hook so I can instantly sacrifice her, and she DCs halfway through the animation, causing her to lose around 15k bloodpoints.
---
There, now it is readable.
---
It's half your team when someone else is in a chase, then someone else has to go get them for three.
---
i typically wiggle once the killer is gone saying  "come get meeeee it's safe!!!"
---
if the killer is camping, then i'm chilling on the hook so everyone else can get gens done during my hook time. I thought that's what we were supposed to do. oh well.
---
Someone's getting laid tonight! GG Mr King Dong ;)
---
If it's not in the patch notes, hopefully it's just something that slipped through. Does the description for Resilience still say vault in it? I'm on PS4 so I can't check PTB.
---
If it is an intended change, hopefully they're planning to give a vault speed buff on Lithe.
---
Agreed I fucking love this 
---
But it seems survivors are mass disconnecting against Legion. He's just shit design, nobody liles him.
---
The devs are just clueless.
---
That and wake up
---
I'd assume so because why would they have to cut off the rest of the other players scores lol. I smell a stunt.
---
&gt; But why would you be healing them in the first place?
---
Because most people don't use self care.
---
Hey that's toxic
---
Boy you need to edit this wall of text down. 
---
I hear ya, sometimes I wish there was a manual rank reset that didn't involve fucking over 3 other players. Killers are either really good and it's an amazing tense match or it's really shitty and it's a camp fest. Sometimes you just want to play without that bullshit. 
---
Tbf I've made friends with people in a lobby before the game has begun and then had them message me on Steam after their death to warn me of the killer's loadout. This is probs just to ensure no issue.
---
How about no.
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 survivor on console as well, games usually take 3-5 minutes to find for me but when it‚Äôs longer than that it does usually take about 20-30 minutes, but that happens rarely.
---
I love it 
---
For me it was sb sc wglf then mostly bt since i was extremely altruistic 
---
Haha?
---
Its the most widely used perk there is. And when people realize there's no time difference between being healed and healing yourself...
---
Your objective is to escape, preventing NOED from spawning furthers that goal.
---
NANI? 
---
But the fact that came up with such a stupid idea is what's worrying.
---
I think maybe he was just telling a shitty joke, but who knows.
---
Dont go for the grabs right off the star... 95% of them fail and you miss out on the opportunity to gain stalk. The most popular and best strategy is to get your stalk meter to 99% before hitting tier 3, then once behind a healthy survivor, get that tier 3 and instant down. As a rank 1 killer main, this is one of the most effective strategies. Or go watch Monto if you want weird gimmicy builds but you might not have the perks being only 50 hours. Good luck to yah
---
but i love doing dull totems :(
---
They rock! I'd get them inked even 10/10
---
Ok, so now can they remove the killer‚Äôs ability to see anything about the survivors before the game? Yes the survivors shouldn‚Äôt be able to warn friends what the killer is packing, but the killer shouldn‚Äôt be able to tell when a large group loads in, who they‚Äôre playing, and if they have an item. It‚Äôs the same concept in reverse except now there‚Äôs an actual imbalance. 
---
Oh great now people scribble better than me. Jokes aside these look amazing 
---
I think the change makes sense logically but in game... Yeah, could be broken, especially when combo'd with botany knowledge.
---
Oh I‚Äôm not saying I like the guy. I‚Äôm just saying that if the way he played doesn‚Äôt count as gen rushing then I don‚Äôt think we saw the same videos
---
At the start of the chainsaw sprint, you can do some funky turns and even do a full circle with the right addons
---
Except jiggle physics isn't nearly as difficult to fix as Freddy. That's a WD40 job, Freddy is trying to rebuild the fucking highway system.
---
They are called survivors... If a killer died, are they no longer called killers? I don't think so boo boo. It would be called killer pudding üòâ
---
Please explain to me how someone who has so many hours in this game is still so bad, and still wins most every game he plays?
---
The noed analogy also doesn't work here because that's one game. Tru3 wins MOST every game. What crutch perks carry him?
---
Yeah, not even a PTB thing, but if you spam R when picking someone up, you can drop them asap before being palleted or flashlighted.  
---
And since you can't get stunned while dropping, it's a free anti-save. Kinda bullshit too
---
I think you forgot doctor.
---
Theres not one major post on front page about this though just bullshit memes , this is game breaking, 
---
O shit you rite. I knew I was forgetting someone
---
They‚Äôre very fun for sure! You‚Äôve got good taste
---
Good to know
---
Okay that‚Äôs good to know 
---
Edited
---
I know right. The truth is, it was probably longer than an hour and a half. Sorry you have a better experience with the match making. I‚Äôve been having problem even with solo que taking forever. 
---
Is the film about playing killer with the best addons and playing on the game map every time ?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ClearAnimatedBobaFrankerZ
---
That does bring up a good point on how the killer can just block the basement. To avoid hostage taking situations, they should make a system where if the killer is standing still or in the same area for a certain amount of time (like 5 mins) all collision disappears and the survivors can run through them. Thats enough time for RBTs to go off and definitely enough for BT to vanish.
---
Oh should so its intended then? Well guess I learned something new.
---
You either can't read or you're just being intentionally dishonest.
---
Aww, thanks stranger!
---
That‚Äôs a fair argument tbh didn‚Äôt think about that
---
Yeah I just don't get it. The point of changing it is to lower the amount it's used because it's on 90% of survivors, so now I'm encouraged to bring it cos if I don't, I'm just wasting time finding someone to still get self care healing speed.
---
A meme from 10,000BC
---
Ah you see, this is why I run bloodwarden now.
---
NoED is a expected, they waste their time preparing for a perk I'm not running. Then as they run up to their gates toxicity rushing through their blood like a cheap energy drink. They see the spikes, and they realize the error of their actions.  
---
Ohh I like the little mori symbol that appears, console player no ptb for me. 
---
Hmmm. As a player with over 800 hours currently I can see that side of swf being an issue. I do think the devs should implement a voice com in game that only extends to a certain range. And if the killer is near they should be able to hear you. Imo it would make the experience more exciting.
---
However, the devs have some mixed signals with surv being able to emote to each other meaning they want some kind of communication. Idk. I hope bhvr comes up with a fair voice com at some point. Id prefer limited comms if it meant killers wouldnt abandon lobbies half the time. 
---
They changed it, it's not a straight up buff.
---
All those killers I got forced to have it maxed out on before level 10 have a real perk new :')
---
They should give the ability to see the hatch if you're wearing a RBT.
---
The Trapper* (I‚Äôm going to hell for that one)
---
Whats wrong with noob3
---
With the new matchmaking system killer won't be able to see when people come in premade. And it's intended that the killer see the survivors and get prepared accordingly. Player using another program to get an advantage is not intended by the developers. 
---
Nothing, it‚Äôs just his exact setup 
---
Those outfits are gorgeous. I'm hyped.
---
Amen brother
---
Oh hell yeah this looks fucking cool
---
IF they are in a chase, and WHEN they need to be rescued, sure.
---
It could just be made of pieces of a survivor that still managed to get away.
---
Hes already kinda bad why would we need those changes 
---
Molded hag!!!!!
---
I'm going to have to agree with everything in this post, and add that I personally learned a lot from the streamer OhTofu. He's a great survivor and killer, and knows quite a bit about the game. It really just depends on your preference in the type of streamer. Also, I think StreamDad is great for how positive he is in this game! 
---
To add to the list of how to get over your fear, my best suggestion along with the hiding of the end game chat would be to make sure no comments can be made onto your profile. And if you do go and find someone talking mad shit about you because "you're bad", you can laugh at them because they're literally talking shit about a newbie. It's like laughing at a newborn baby because they can't walk or talk. Or laughing at a virgin because they aren't sure how to have sex. It may get them laughing, but in the end, everyone knows they're being a douche. 
---
This game can be a load of fun and can also be so very frustrating. Don't let it get to you. If you play both sides, and are having a bad day at survivor, switch to killer. Or vice versa. Take breaks when needed. Don't be an asshole, unless you plan on dealing with the asshole behavior in return. 
---
Ummm I'm rank 1 and killers seem to 4k and at the very least 2k with absolute ease. I'm not sure if you are matched with people far better then you but at the top the killers don't "get trolled" they wreak havoc on survivors.
---
At least it makes Blood Warden more playable
---
It very very slightly reduces the stun when you leave frenzy. Honestly not worth using IMO 
---
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite type of killer Cole?‚Äù
---
Yeah, just like everyone adapted to self care taking nearly a full limited in the sloppy butcher meta. Oh wait, no, they still brought it every game.
---
The ptb is out?
---
Franks tape was already a free 4k for any good killer, what the hell is this?
---
Nah, that‚Äôs the cold dirt type add-on surely, which reduces the cooldown/stun time of Frenzy. 
---
Youre talking about cold dirt, joey' s mixtape and another addon I forgot the name of. Not the pins
---
It's not dstrike. It's dstrike, dead hard, adrenaline, and self care or borrowed time, on an already decent player, times 2-4. Combine that with voice comms allowing them to report the killer's actions and coordinating item use, and it gets quite frustrating and unnecessarily powerful. I mean, I'll deal with it but I don't have to enjoy it, or be silent about it.
---
Everyone does not have Self Care. Maybe 2/4 survivors at Rank 1 have Self Care.
---
This change might push more people into using it and make it a required perk which makes survivors less versitile.
---
Isn‚Äôt it a competitive game, though? Intended for PvP multiplayer? Like, smash is more of a party game to me. I agree that people should take it less seriously anyway.
---
Couldn't HAVE spoken better.
---
Lol it's still gonna be trash.
---
From the PTB patch notes they‚Äôre releasing, it seems like they‚Äôre working on noise issues like footsteps, music, and VOs. Not sure how well it‚Äôs gonna go tho :/ (2.5.0)
---
You can read more about it here:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/40566/2-5-0-mid-chapter-player-test-build
---
Oh crap. You're right. These affect the cooldown depletion when you hit a survivor outside of frenzy.
---
Thanks
---
Nice I really just want a blond male survivor 
---
gens were definitely super quick back in the day. blinds were insanely easy too. if anything back then survivors were o.p and deserved nerfs along the way. I think too many in my opinion but it depends who you talk to. Things seem pretty balanced now I guess. 
---
Swf will always have upper hand on killers unless the skill gaps are massive between the sides, and I only ever play solo so I'm not sure how many people are with friends or not. Can't balance the game around swf, as it makes no sense. Like i said to another comment in rank 1 the killers rarely get smoked, so I just don't see any of what you are mentioning. Sometimes and i mean SOMETIMES they do but I think those are the killers that don't belong at rank 1 or ones that just have a bad game.
---
These seem kind of useless then, not that I ever noticed an effect when I tried using them. 
---
Yup, just remembered and editted my post to reflect that. 
---
Brand new parts were originally intended to finish a generator instantly too lol
---
We are getting so many overcharge x huntress lullaby doctors now. Ohno
---
8=======0~~~~~
---
Because not everyone is having problems takes me under a minute to get a match going. 
---
Legion is fun and interactive zubSAD
---
Patch notes just released so yeah probably.
---
I honestly prefer using the rulers instead, they reduce the time it takes for the power gauge to refill but most add-ons for the Legion are pretty underwhelming to say the least
---
They pay attention to grass moving or noise being made. 
---
They have the data. They know which side does better.
---
Last time they shared it, less than 2 of the 4 survivors escaped each game. The rate was as low as 40% on some maps.
---
It‚Äôs about 8-10 meters. 
---
I love to play SWF with all my friends, got them back into this game and i can firmly say im perfectly ok with this change. Almost never took advantage to tell my team mates about the perks the killer has but either way its nice for the killer to feel more secure :)
---
Smash has a whole esports scene, seems like a bad example 
---
You get, like, 25. Is it really worth it?
---
One rewards you for getting caught, the other rewards you for letting all the gens get completed.
---
That's the argument, anyway. 
---
Probably not, sorry to disapoint
---
An integral part of the meme is that it's always an opinion inside the book of facts.
---
Nurse
---
Billy/Spirit
---
Huntress/Clown
---
Hag/Myers/Leatherface
---
Wraith/Trapper/Pig
---
Legion/Trapper
---
Freddy
---
That's just how I feel anyway. 
---
I‚Äôm down to try anything just cuz I think having an aura reward you like that is a silly idea. Only reason dr is low tier is cuz he power doesn‚Äôt do anything for the chase and his madness can be dealt with if you put in the practice. 
---
I think so, never checked it.
---
Newest killer is a straight to dvd purge killer
---
As soon as someone asks about rank you can ignore them from there. Rank 10-1 is essentially the same with minimal player improvement moving up.
---
If you‚Äôre asking if it works on their fatigue when frenzy ends, no. It works the same as nurse‚Äôs fatigue. It‚Äôs not a stun, it‚Äôs a fatigued state. 
---
i think that got patched a while ago
---
No one cares play the game how you want to play it
---
I said it was strong lol not op

It's not called dead fried chicken. They were survivors so the pudding is called survivor pudding. 
---
Just press Right mouse click.
---
It's pointless on him because when he gets stunned he loses the Frenzy and is still stunned. 
---
pig is coot oink
---
In comparison I have 6 Brand New Parts (used one), 3 Rainbow Maps, and 1 Skeleton Key.
---
Yeah... when I said I was drowning in Odd Bulbs I wasn't fucking kidding.
---
When the gen is 3 second away from being done, and the killer is 2 second away 
---
You can down people with two hits from his ability, which as you should know, has no counter.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;98% of SWF are people who are queuing with friends.
---
And how does that make it any less frustrating for the killer?
---
Also if you're wondering how many Party Starters: 103. And I used like 5 during the event.
---
You can still see the Killer's name in post game.
---
Where do you live where it isn‚Äôt dead fried chicken???
---
Where? I dont think so.
---
If you want to learn what perks do check the Wiki. If you want to learn what perks are good on what Killers check tier lists.
---
And this isn't so urgent that you can't wait 5 minutes to see them. Seriously just go watch YouTube or something.
---
&gt;but in my 300+ hours of killer play time, I haven't found a survivor thanks to crows once,
---
That's entirely on you.
---
Crows can give you an alert when near then when they crow, tell you someone is there from afar by them flying away, and tell you someone was there a few seconds ago.
---
It's on no one else but yourself for ignoring clues, my dude.
---
No you get 150 per skillcheck
---
**HELL** yeah
---
That is a reason. They are garbage for dodging, hence why they shouldn't get the chance to dodge based off cosmetics. Give a good reason it needs to be there because I Just gave a **valid** reason why it shouldn't because it does indeed happen.
---
I'll take my buck fifty. 
---
*burn a mist offering because I have nothing better to waste*
---
"Oh, hey, two other people also burned mist offerings. What a co-inky-dink."
---
*killer begins frothing at the mouth*
---
Yeah, I glared over the legion buffs on purpose because they are both one of the weakest and one of the strongest killers of the game, there is a lot wrong with them and I think buffing them isn't a good idea. I just think there is nothing that can be done for the legion apart from a rework, but seing how long freddy's rework took, I don't think we'll see a legion rework in the comming year
---
This is exactly not what they said. 
---
Straight outta Vigo‚Äôs journal hahaha
---
I'm going off of what you said about "both sides have (their) strong stuff".
---
The killer can't see the end game screen until the game is done.
---
They added new menu animations for survivors. You can check them out in the PTB.
---
It used to and when perks were rewritten, some of those "increase action speed" perks were also changed so that Resilience is the only perk among those that increase vaulting speed.  
---
  
---
Just to clarify this matter.
---
I don't know why I have such a hard on for dresses. Ling Xiaoyu, Leifang and now Feng Min.
---
I have a new main :)
---
I don't think it's gonna be trash
---
Most have it, and with these changes everyone would have it.
---
Its faster than it was even before the healing changes, and if other people heal you at 75% speed because they have it then you might as well take it and heal yourself at 75% speed. 75% slower at healing others...thats a difference of what, 4-5 seconds? Barely a difference.
---
F
---
Or, rather, an unfortunate lack of F-ing.
---
Not saying that it‚Äôs never happened to me, but dude it‚Äôs pretty rare that you find a survivor because of crows. If the crows are close enough for you to see them, you already found the surv most likely. Crows aren‚Äôt like meta or anything. 
---
Also, you shouldn‚Äôt even really have much time to focus on crows. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as much ‚Äúignoring clues‚Äù and maybe it‚Äôs more that you‚Äôre too busy actually like chasing a survivor. 
---
Oh I‚Äôm on console and can‚Äôt use it anyway but thank you I‚Äôve seen a lot of cool animations and just wondered PS I like the patch notes
---
Yeah idk how they haven't implemented that. F13 did, and its development has ceased to continue.
---
I honestly prefer purple ranks. It has a mix of decent survivors so I can still have a challenge as a killer, but also I don‚Äôt go up against too many sqaudettes and the like neither.
---
That's pretty good!
---
What rank are you? If you can consistently get all the gens done then use Adrenaline. Otherwise the perks you've listed aren't bad at all, dstrike if you can hit it consistently, we'll make it and BT if you wanna go for saves etc. 
---
Reading comprehension dude. I didnt say he shouldn't have the ability. Just that it should be hard/rare to do.
---
‚ÄúWait a minute, this whole operation was your idea!‚Äù
---
Distortion is the perk that makes it so that your can't be seen by the killer, you're thinking of Discordance, which is the Legion perk.
---
you wanna know why this wont work? Because people will shut it off, get in discord and use real voice communication anyway. SWF isnt the problem, its the fact that teamwork and friendship lets them pull off shit that shouldnt normally be done. Killer camps a hook, -10% in chasing. 4 claudettes abuse a freddy, 0 repurcussions.
---
This game imo is a casual horror experience with rank system slapped on
---
You expect anything else from r/deadbydaylight? 
---
7/10 ‚ÄúPretty good job so far.‚Äù
---
Is it really such a big problem the dev's have to make a change to hide the killers perks/add-ons/offerings until the match is over? No, but they did. Show survivors love too. They took away the ability to see the killers profile in the lobby but kept it for killers? Why? And why should killers have the ability to change their perks based on what the survivors are wielding? Survivors don't get that chance. Four flashlights? Time to equip Lightborn. No, if you don't like flashlights then gamble the perk slot. Oh its Legion..guess my medkit is useless. Freddy? Better not equip object of obsession or it'll do nothing but hurt me. That information is very powerful for both sides, so let's make it even.
---
This isn't really a good clip to make that statement tbh. That Quentin was going to go down anyway.
---
I think I just became a Feng main
---
Ah thanks - was looking out for like red footprints or something. 
---
Anyone else peep the bulge? Or am I crazy..
---
But I said dbd is competitive? I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm strawmanning at all. They‚Äôre both competitive. And smash to me is more of a party game than dbd. Relax man. And dbd also has several tournaments and twitch streamers. I actually thought you were talking about dbd in that statement you made about smash. I don‚Äôt even really know what you‚Äôre saying. 
---
Some people consider it a bug but it‚Äôs been in the game for long enough that i think they left it in intentionally? Is this a case of bugs being features?
---
Wasn't this at the beginning of the previous PTB also? I can faintly remember an issue with Exhaustion and hooks being hotfixed on the PTB.  
---
The overreaction is what makes this really funny and saddening at the same time.
---
Out of curiosity, does anyone know if they finally added an animation for her in the Killer menu? 
---
How about practicing when you actually *get* progress for the gen and not running the risk of losing even more?
---
Plus you can never perfect great skill checks. You will always miss some.
---
We‚Äôll just have to remain **ENDURING** until some more interesting perks show up.
---
This is actually such a shit change. The "advantage" SWF groups get out of it is slim to none. 90% of the time any SWF that sees your build after you kill one of them is confirming what everyone is already guessing. All this change does is fuck over solo survivors by not letting them see how they died, whether they got outplayed or got fucked by a perk/add-on combo.
---
SWF will still know your builds. SWF will still be able to run circles around you. SWF will still take out all 5 totems so your NOED doesn't pop. You will still get shit on by SWF if you did already.
---
You're only slowing down solo survivors progression in the game with this change. In any game that isn't triple A, top billing, that is a very bad thing.
---
Downvote me all you want. Yes, I play SWF. Yes, I play solo survivor. Yes, I play killer. This change is a dumbass change that will only hurt the health of the community
---
There is not enough lobby dodging that goes one purely over cosmetics like legacy. Also that only affects one platform so removing a piece of the game‚Äôs atmosphere, the killer seeing and knowing you before you know them, is a useless idea fixing a small problem that is actually not a problem at all. Second, even if your suggestion, seeing only their heads or sillouttes would even more defeat the purpose of having survivors being anything more than just square hitboxes. 
---
The reason seeing cosmetics can and should stay is because A, it adds to the unknowing Presense that you reveal your hand to the killer before you go in and B, it‚Äôs like removing something that isn‚Äôt causing real damage or causing actual in game grief. 
---
The survivors dying and telling their SWF party of the killers build ad allowing them to act according is a product of the game not being balanced around open instant communication like that. A lot of perks are made either fully or next to useless because of voice chat. Taking out something like seeing cosmetics because you think it‚Äôs on the same level as being able to tell a killers whole build because someone died in the first three minutes is just being either purposefully obtuse or severely lacking perception on balance. 
---
good point xD
---
I do. I remember back when Tinkerer and Bitter Murmur were going to be must run perks.
---
um thats almost never going to happen so
---
Hell no they‚Äôre running through every pallet cause they live the taste of it‚Äôs dick I‚Äôm glad the Legion answered out prayers
---
Yesss
---
Oooo ok yea that makes more sense
---
Equip Bloodhound and you can. :)
---
"endgame perks"
---
She is 2 or 3
---
pepehands just means something bad/unfortunate/sad happens, so pepehands
---
Happened to me a couple days ago. 
---
I really want a Sidney paragraph. Maybe ghost face cosmetics to match but having another final girl in the game would be phenomenal. We were robbed of Nancy (and debatably sally of TCM)
---
Ladies and Gents: the salt of your average dbd player.
---
Unless they're using Bloodhound Frenzy is insanely easy to counter.
---
No you said Shrek is competitive. "one is you trying to strawman the fact that dbd isn't a competitive game while smash is" As if smash wasn't a competitive game because "Shrek" has a following or whatever you're trying to imply.
---
nope, last time i had it happen it didnt refill my hatchets, unless they patched it
---
"A" impact font meme
---
Bro. Listen. The game by default has no voice communication. The game isn't balanced around voice communication. If you're using it, you're giving yourself and your friends a competitive advantage. Please there's no reason for the denial. SWF isn't going anywhere so let's just be honest about it. 
---
Rank like 9 i think? Used to be rank one but didn‚Äôt play for awhile so still climbing back up
---
He was like   ...     To WHERE'S MY DAVID 
---
Don‚Äôt have Kate:/
---
I wonder how Dwight got so fast with his hands... wait, never mind.
---
Remove NOED and watch it rise drastically.
---
Hell teach survivors to do gens rather than sit around hooks when the killer camps and it will rise even more.

True but ebony mori is up to four kills. You would have to coordinate with all other survivors to have more than one instant generator. When they changed it to a skill check every two seconds for 5%ish repaired that was fun because you still lost the part if you stopped doing the generator say if the killer checked that generator. Is what it is. When it comes down to everything I would be just happy for dedicated servers lol
---
It's not supposed to be completely even, it is an asymetric game after all, if all the survivors bring flashlights they should be punished, same as if they all bring toolboxes or all medkits, survivors should have to diverisfy in order to helo the team better. Plus the killer should be prepared for the survivors lorewise due to them being connected to the entity who is staging everything. Also, killer can't see survivors perks while survivors could and being able to know exactly what perks a player is using is much more impactful on the game, as opposed to seeing what items survivors are bringing. 
---
thank you
---
Yeah that was op hence why it is not a thing anymore. They had the in between change for the BNP where you would get the skill check every two seconds and if you miss any or get off the generator it breaks the tool box I thought that was fun.
---
I didn't complain about self care. I personally don't think it's a good perk and don't use it. I'm just saying buffing a perk to counter another perk (which I also don't think is very good) is good balance.
---
Super cool, how long does each one take?
---
I assume this is the same with Dark Sense?
---
I think the game lobby should be the campfire instead. 
---
True. It's worth it imo.
---
Is this list a meme?  
---
Awww let a girl live a little man 
---
Fuckin' preach bother.
---
That's nice to know, well I truly don't have problems hitting great skill checks 90% of the time so I will go on and keep hitting them for free points.
---
No it's my personal opinion on their tiers with my rank 1 expirience and knowledge 
---
That makes sense. I do the same. But that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. I had 15 killers quit back to back upon entering. Not waiting around. I Literally joined and they quit. That is ridiculous. 
---
The Gideon meat plant map, as a killer that place is a fuckin nightmare, two levels, a basement that is so out of the way its hilarious, that god awful door system, and so much shit cluttering everywhere survivors can hide within 5m of you and you wont spot them.  Also that map is a nightmare for huntress.
---
That's why it's called EASY Anti-cheat. lol
---
Leader always has worked on vault speeds actually, that's just false information.
---
Whether or not it still will is another question. 
---
Spirit please because she needed some cosmetics
---
The self care nerf was ridiculous in the first place. They were just throwing everything any whiney killer main wanted into the game and now they‚Äôre finally trying to back track. Sloppy is overpowered right now, even with multiple people healing you it takes way to long at tier 3.
---
Man. Only time ive ever done that is when nobody readied up. We had 10 second left so to teach them a lesson, I quit the lobby at 6 seconds, just to show then how it feels waiting forever for everyone to ready up
---
Hides in *the* closet üòâ
---
Small patches better than nothing. 
---
I'm completely indifferent either way. To be perfectly honest even though my friends and I constantly play survive with friends we never even bother reading out perks to each other.  It kills the suspense and fun.  
---
That wasn't the wide scale of what they gave out before. It was stats that included break downs by rank and it was just a very broad picture of the stats concerning game play. The issue with the stats you're talking about is that, as you've pointed out, how people play during an event is not typical. I wish they would do another broad Stat breakdown but alas I dont think we'll get it. 
---
But the point is, killers being able to see what items survivors have in the lobby isn't OP. It gives them a slight advantage and that's intended, and even what the lobby's designed for.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Ikr this is gonna be an instabuy outfit... so good
---
I didn't know there even was hook immunity.
---
Sooo....
---
From the example I responded to: if a killer is convinced they got ass blasted because they were going up against a 4-man SWF they will not take survivors at their word, but the game showing that they got wrecked by 4 solo survivors forces them to face their pride and accept they were outplayed.  idk, lots of killers rationalize being toxic because they are facing SWF with comms, suppose I'm naively hoping that proof they were simply outplayed will temper their bad manners.
---
New Survivor: Nicholas Claus.
---
Just fucking dropkicks the entity and throws presents around.
---
I think it used to be VERY killer friendly, but now I really doubt that. After the engine update I can‚Äôt see shit and it‚Äôs so dark, and after the hook update making them spawn more far from each other, trying to get to a hook can be very unfun. 
---
This character purely existed to get Alyson alone and also to reveal Michael to her. He wasn‚Äôt meant to act smart, he wasn‚Äôt meant to try to escape he was literally in the film to die so when she finally encountered Michael it‚Äôd have a bit more weight to it.
---
Roughly 10-20 minutes each
---
The guy doesn't know what he's talking about, it's been tested that it does improve vaulting speed. It also stacks with Resiliance and Spine chill. 
---
It affects EVERY action except repair.
---
Spine Chill does still effect vaulting speed, despite the destruction. I believe it's one of those things that just doesn't work well in KYF, however. 
---
Reality is often disappointing 
---
Yup
---
He ain't gonna be getting no bloodpoint bail, so he's in deep shit.

I have a guide way down buried in my comment history. I invite you to look at it. I'll also go back through them and see if i can find it for you. Be checking this comment too, because I'll edit it with the link once i find it.
---
Was on mobile posting that, didn't realize it didn't work.
---
I've seen the website for ability teirs. But what other resources should I be looking at to improve by game. Lvl 9 acct, very new.
---
It makes the perfect perk for Huntress since you can be stealthed around so easy. 
---
Okay, I really think you misunderstood what I was saying. And I'm not saying that at all in a way to insult you or whatever, but definitely some confusion I think. From me as well. But, here's what I was saying.
---
OP said to not treat DbD like a competitive game because it's a party game. I said, "Isn't it a competitive game?" I was saying how my stance was that DbD is more a competitive game than a party game. And I brought up the Smash Bros. series. I was saying that, even though smash is really much more of a party game than DbD, people still play that competitively. So, if a party game like smash can be played competitively, than surely people can take a multiplayer PvP (or whatever it's called, don't think this is right) competitive game and treat it competitively. 
---
You then said that "Smash has a whole esports scene." And I still don't know what you meant by that as I wasn't saying that it didn't have an esports scene. And then I brought up Shrek, another party game, and how it has a competitive scene in order to further establish the point that a party game can be taken seriously and played competitively. DbD is not really a party game, and more of a competitive game in its nature, at least more so than Smash and Shrek for example; therefore, one would assume that the game would be played competitively. And even if it WAS a party game, then certainly people could play it competitively as we have both agreed that both Shrek and Smash are party games, and that those party games are played competitively. So, if those party games could be played competitively, then DbD can be played competitively. And with all that said, I still think it's a competitive game that can be played seriously.
---
How many times did I say competitively
---
Lol. Me when I know there isn't a mori and I found me a nice flashlight in a box.
---
Does tenacity and unbreakable stack to get a super fast recovery and be able to crawl?  Thank you! üòç
---
I mean just don't waste time healing. Sloppy isn't even very good right now. It's not like being injured is any huge hindrance. The game is in the most balanced state it has ever been.
---
Get bad nerd
---
Never mentioned that as OP. I just thought it would be a fun change.
---
You sure she didn‚Äôt have haunted ground?  Its possible someone popped a totem which makes you exposed for like a minute and a half

---
One, two, Freddys coming for you.
---
Three, four; better lock your door...
---
it's not hard and not something special. the win rate, unless it's a shit day where I face 5-6 swfs in a row, I'd say 30% - 4k, 50 - 3k(cause people get the hatch too often), rest is spread around 2 to 1k. maybe 1% is when I get 0k. you should stop trusting the sub, Freddy isn't bad when you come to actually know his power. you can do very decent with him, he's just not as good as other killers cause some aspects of his power cripple him. but a good player makes him work no problem. 
---
to your suggestion, dunno if you're saying it ironic but I hesitate too much. had a YouTube channel with blogs back in the day, never promoted them but got over 1k within couple months. that gave me depression for some reason, I don't like too much attention, so stopped making videos.
---
Bubba is actually a decent killer, I know few rank 1 Leathermains who never even proxy camp and get ez 4k and use the chainsaw real well. really think you should just practice the chainsaw timing and distance, there's literally nothing hard. I remember I tried him first time back in March and thought he sucks. but with bit of practice I started chainsawing like nothing. it's really fun but I don't enjoy the instadown kills. when I get Leatherdaily I just chainsawhappy around downing people and only hooking once for BBQ stacks. 
---
Lol , thank you tho
---
If it stacks then that‚Äôs a 50% bonus with 2 survivors. Fucking 50
---
Fookin dead ard
---
Yeah ! Post them its awesome
---
Thanks :), the rest are coming up real soon
---
Not as broken as swf queues on top of lobby dodging noobs. I legit sat in a queue for almost 3 hours because of queue times and lobby dodgers. We FINALLY got a fuckin killer and the game starts. Yay. As soon as we could move. "You've been disconnected from the host" is plastered across all our screens. I got off the game immediately after that. Didn't even say bye to my friend. Just left chat and got right the fuck off the game. All these boosted ass killers on ps4 is disgusting. They want a bunch of randoms to pick off easily so they can boost themselves into ranks they don't belong in.
---
Not gonna lie, this shit is kinda confusing...but my understanding of the coop penalty is each survivor gets a 10% repair speed penalty when working with another survivor on a gen.  If you have the buffed Prove Thyself, each of the survivors you are with gets a 10% repair speed boost. Isn‚Äôt this doing nothing but canceling that penalty for everyone but yourself?  I may not be understanding it right.
---
Came to say this!  Hate that map with a passion, I don‚Äôt even like playing it as a survivor
---
&gt;Decisive Gun
---
Thanks , and i love my freddy one üòè. Had to do him extra special cs im a freddy main 
---
If I die at the start of the game then I could wait for like 20 minutes yeah lol
---
Yeah but still he went down in only 2 stabs as opposed to the usual 4 which is the part that matters.
---
It should still apply to resilience since it actually says it in the description at the very least otherwise its bugged. 
---
Well I hate to say this but if you think Myers is that high and hag is second worst I fear you are not rank 1. 
---
Thanks , and right ? Such a handsome lil boy that one 
---
Try playing that map with Trapper. It hurts, as a Trapper main, to play that map.
---
Thank you , theyre coming up real soon
---
Is the patch only on pc right now?
---
I‚Äôve had people message everyone + me when I‚Äôm the killer about my perks
---
Ok? You doing fine without knowing isn't really an argument. You're just proving it doesn't matter if the killer knows or not. While my point it because it doesn't matter the devs have no reason to bother changing how things are with the killer in the lobby. 
---
Also please explain how a killer knowing what items survivors bring is more impactful or just as impactful as survivors knowing what perks killer has. Perks are far more powerful than items.
---
The "advantage" of knowing all the Killer's perks when someone is sacrificed is slim to none.
---
Coming up next on the Survivor News Network: Why Killers should be happy with getting a 0k and shouldn't hook a Survivor more than 0 times!
---
Funny how some ppl are obsessed on treating a game like a job instead of having fun you have to go this far for advantage..
---
Not so much a "buff" as a fix to an age-old problem that should've been done decades ago.
---
I shall , just got a couple more to do 
---
Got fixed when clown was released I think
---
Ive been rank 1 since before Pigs release. Again its just my personal expirience talking. Just because its not yours doesnt mean I'm wrong
---
Yes, this is from the Public Test Build on the PC version.
---
yeah, to downing with chainsaw, it's just a good killer thing. you need to scare them off the gen, take a shortcut around, get on their booties and start your chainsaw. ez down. only trick is to learn to not bump into object or bump and make them think it's safe. not everyone realize/constantly remember that tantrum also downs. on your ranks downing with tantrum would be good decision.
---
also, just like Billy, fukin corner them lol. listen closely for immersed Claudettes in darkest corners, body block and start the chainsaw. 
---
If it's "slim to none" why you so salty?
---
I‚Äôm a console peasant suffering from this issue still. Going on about an hour and only found 1 match. 
---
While this sounds good, Balance wise the 3 story buildings would be a pain for any player but the nurse (but then again nurse does have a problem blinking multilevel... Referring to basement). Also would be hard to design loops indoors considering the maps would have to be extremely small to be multilevel, otherwise the maps would be enormous and inconsistent with the other map sizes.
---
Dont most cosmetics cost twice as much as LF already?
---
Posting the same thing I replied to the other guy with (literally same arguments):
---
And yes, it does actually cause grief albeit small but if they are making the change to hide the load out then make the small change to give survivors black silhouettes. I can tell you right now that if you've played this game long enough then you pretty much know the killers load out already. Nurse/Myers/Billy/Leatherface playing badly? Clear totems, guaranteed NOED. Not to mention competent survivors play around perks anyways. Survivor just got downed and you're opening an exit gate? Pause for a second, let the guy get hooked, THEN open the exit gate.
---
So is the perk load out that big of a deal? No, but killer mains make it one so it gets implemented hence every patch for the last dozen patches has survivor nerfs and killer buffs lol. Throw survivors a bone and hide the items/cosmetics in lobbies.
---
Lol if you check my profile I have multiple videos of me doing exactly that. Stop trying to justify the devs making overpowered killer perks and unnecessarily nerfing survivor perks. Stop whining and just play the game. 
---
Competitively: 10 (including the one in your question)
---
Competitive: 7
---
I may have miscounted, but I‚Äôm too lazy to recheck.
---
https://youtu.be/IxX-JmhaxVQ
---
Your claims make no sense. How is one meant to dispute nonsense?
---
You get Shards for Leveling, not for your Devotion. Just saying that there should be a Bonus for reaching 100 and starting over. They could just give us more Shards for instance. A 1000 Shard Bonus(total of 3 levels) could be fair.
---
Myers is a very cool killer. He has a slow start and sometimes luck just isnt on your side and the first gen pops and you havent found a surv. My tryhard build with myers is Ruin, M&amp;A, Spirit Fury, Enduring. Some thing i like to do is save tier 3 after I hook someone, then next survivor i find gets the 1 hit down and suddenly you got 2 people on hooks. 
---
Of course we thought of that before, of voice coms in games.
---
Kind of ruins the feel when you join up with "lolol get wrecked ur gay this is my gen"
---
Knowing the devs and how they do their tinkering, I guess they want Prove Thyself to just cancel that penalty. 
---
Normally, when repairing gens, you do not go 1x speed when solo, 2x Speed with 2, etc., but 1.8x for 2 Survs, 2.6x Speed for 3 and 3.4x for all 4 on the same gen, so it's minus0.2 for each surv.  
---
100% Co-Op means deliiiiiicious points off that gen tho.  
---
(1.2k + 1.9k -&gt; 1.2k + 3.8k off a single coop gen!)
---
Where you doing it and lost it somewhere?
---
Don't be toxic and they won't dodge you.
---
If you're not toxic and they're dodging you, then they're toxic and you're better off not in their game.
---
I fail to see an issue.
---
I mean you can type all you want, saying smash isn't competitive and then going on about how Shrek is competitive is wrong on both counts. I'm not reading an essay about you trying to use circular logic on how you're right lol
---
A few hours ago, yeah.
---
Your diligent work will not go unnoticed.
---
Holy crap the bots even now what's up.
---
It is a marked improvement. Not good enough to be general meta, but it is no longer the worst perk in the game. I haven‚Äôt been able to play with it of course, but at a reading, it is at least playable.
---
But it punishes everyone who doesn't take it. This is not a good change
---
I like how you did each with a different color, looks very nice.
---
I believe so but don‚Äôt quote me on it, I haven‚Äôt used that perk in ages.
---
Cant unsee
---
Totems dont matter anymore after the noed "buff". Most games survivors favor doing totems over fans now whereas back in the day people would ignore them. The buff was really a nerf for all hex perks.
---
That doesnt change his ethnicity 
---
Lery‚Äôs/The Game/Shelter Woods (Macmillan) as survivor.
---
Grim Pantry as killer. God forbid if you ever down someone in the lower level of the pantry, then trying to find an exit as you attempt to carry them out without trying to get stuck on all the clutter. 
---
Also despite Red Forest with a passion because it‚Äôs always so laggy and the frames drop. It‚Äôs really bad on console.
---
Best maps as killer and survivor is basically any Autohaven or Macmillan map. Everything else is not as good as.
---
The dlc clothes like charity pack no you have to pay. For killers yes you can earn them but it will take a very long time and you can only earn them if they are not licensed 
---
It's not like waiting 5 minutes will kill someone. Getting a lobby takes longer than that right now. And again, every perk and add-on is viewable in the game. If someone *wants* to learn, they can. Easily.
---
Thank you so much. Bless to you.
---
Snake isn't exclusive to consoles
---
It's not opinion if it's how the devs made the game, lmfao.
---
No just takes more practice I have seen some very good nurses on console 
---
My wish would come true if they just removed him from the game and gave everyone a refund if they bought him with either shards or real money. That will never happen, but that seems like the best solution to me :(
---
Well it's not like you kill yourself on purpose to get that bonus, you contribute as much as you can and then tell your friends the perks. It just shouldn't happen in the first place, you shouldn't be able to contribute to your team even after you're dead, as you say, it should be a complete downside and not a situation where you can get something out of it.
---
Thanks , and i will do it only for the 4$ 
---
I think you just want to be that way. 
---
He went down in 2 stabs because of his add ons and the fact that he was already injured before frenzying him 
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. Not like it‚Äôs $60 or anything.
---
Okay thank you for the help! :) much appreciated 
---
Bloody auto heaven or whatever it is
---
I hate how open and ugly everything looks
---
Meat plant as well...
---
I'm starting to like back swamp a little more now
---
I'm a killer main and my roommate is a survivor main. I saw this happen to her a couple times when she plays and it always makes her feel nice, especially if she played well. I chased a survivor off a hatch once but they gave me such a good runaround the map when I finally downed them i just brought them back to it. It's not a hard and fast rule, but I think it spreads a little positivity into people's experiences.

---
Let‚Äôs nuke Self Care into orbit cause one of the most annoying things is seeing someone spend a whole minute self care healing when the killer has Sloppy and Thanatopobia meanwhile I have Autodidact on 5 stacks. 
---
I main Feng Min, the perks don‚Äôt matter,Feng is all that matters
---
Np man 
---
Resilience is a good perk. T3 Resilience gives you a 9% boost to your action, repair and heal speeds. I usually run self care with it. Heal myself to 99% and then get on a gen. I also use Dead hard. When I hear a killer coming I usually try to loop them until I have to use my dead hard, at which point I quickly fully heal, so the chase can keep going longer. 
---
I've done it in games before. If the killer downs someone and picks them up while I'm opening the door, I just leave it on 99% until they hook them. Pretty safe assuming the killer isn't right next to you anyways.
---
I like it. It's like paying for the car behind you in the drive thru to get your morning coffee.
---
Left 4 dead isnt exclusive to PC
---
The console version of the game has inconsistent frame drops which have a particular effect on certain killers, particularly the nurse. Because the nurse relies on being precise with how long you hold down your blink for, the game regularly dropping or skipping frames means that window you are looking for can sometimes become literally impossible to achieve. Nurse is known for being inconsistent on console. If you are very good she can still be playable, but she is no longer S tier as she is on PC.
---
I think patch 2.5 holds quite a lot of interesting things for the community, here's what I think of everything. 
---
First of all, knowing that survivors won't be able to see the killer's perks until all survivors are out of the game is very nice and a decent counter to survive with friends. The killer perk changes are also pretty nice, especially the buff to Surveillance :D, I feel like Surveillance is gonna work kind of like Discordance and the Wraith's "All Seeing-Spirit" addon now or maybe even be better than these two things, I really like the idea of this perk change. As for the survivor perks, all of them are pretty nice, however I don't really like the idea of buffing Leader. If there's one thing in DBD that defeats almost all killers, it's gen rushing, and now that Leader is getting this buff, I just feel as if Leader is gonna become one of the most annoyances for killers. The change to Prove Thyself is okay I guess, now we have another perk that grants more bloodpoints other than We're Gonna Live Forever, but again, they buffed the repair speed percentage to 10% and survivors can combine this with Leader to do gens super fast and easily win against the killer. And finally for survivor perks...Self Care. Personally I think the idea for this perk is pretty bad, although it's only being tested in this PTB and we might not see it happen in the actual patch, I still think the change to this is a bad idea, now that the heal speed for Self Care is being buffed up to 25% slower instead of 50% slower, survivors have almost nothing holding them back from doing the gens besides the killer himself, this perk has been in the meta for so long now and now it might be getting a buff when it's already what almost all survivors use, I personally don't like this idea for it. 
---
As for the killer changes, I think the changes to the Legion don't make too much of a difference to him other than the change to the deep wound timer and the Pig changes are quite interesting. Now that the Pig can crouch faster, she'll be able to use her dash attack more better and more to her advantage and I also like how you are granted more bloodpoints now for using your power as her, she definitely needed that for more bloodpoint game. However, I'm not exactly sure about the idea of bumping her terror radius up to 32 meters instead of 28 meters. Sure, I understand why it's being changed, so that more Pig players can use the crouch action and be more sneaky, but the problem with this is that the Pig moves a little bit slower when she's crouching than she does when she's walking, sometimes Pig players might need to walk to get around the map faster, but now when she's walking she'll be alerting her presence more to survivors. And finally, the changes to the Jigsaw box distances to me both are good but also are not good. First of all, it's good because it buys the Pig more time to catch survivors and do some damage but it's also not good because now that she's going to have a 32 meter terror radius, it'll be a little bit harder for her to sneak up on survivors trying to remove a trap because if she's standing, survivors will be a little bit more aware of her presence and if she's crouching to get to them, she'll have to walk slower to get to them, so that part might make it be a little bit harder for the Pig. 
---
And finally, as for map changes, all map changes in this patch are very nice, I like how there is now a better chance for survivors to find generators in Treatment Theatre by just simply looking for flashing signs around the map and the changes to both the Backwater Swamp maps are also very nice, now that the weeds on both Backwater Swamp maps will be adjusted, it could make it so that the killer can keep the chase with the survivor and not worry about losing them every time survivors run through a big thicket of weeds, and the change to Badham Preschool is also pretty decent.
---
So basically, this patch to me is gonna be quite interesting and fun :)
---
based on the games ive been having, its a surprise when the killer DOESNT have noed :P
---
So I just did some research and it seems that it affects vault speed, does this mean we'll be able to achieve 40% vault speed after this update? 9% Resilience, 6% Spine Chill, 25% Leader.
---
In terms of opinions, no you aren‚Äôt wrong because it‚Äôs an opinion. 
---
You cannot however say you are not wrong when making blatantly wrong claims such as hag being the second worst killer in the game.
---
I‚Äôve been rank 1 every season since release btw. Doesn‚Äôt mean a whole lot.
---
I can only speak for pc players myself, but I think the que times are very fast. I used to have to wait 10 minutes minimum to find a game as killer, now it takes less then a minute. Survivor que times are also pretty fast compared to how they used to be.
---
I mean, if you think about it, if you were exhausted and just got impales, and then removed from a giant meathook, would you really be like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs got my second wind, time to sprint again‚Äù lmao 
---
Survivors lobbies take a bit yes, killer still have no problem. So if an issue with having too much survivors and too few killers, the patch won't do a thing.
---
satisfying ending
---
Honestly quentin is best boyy

Here you go!

LMAO. Telling a primarily Survivor player to "take off their Killer blinders." Really? üòÇ I'm dying right now. KYF is a thing. It has every perk and add-on, the wiki is also a thing with all of that info. Survivor mains can learn easily if they want.
---
Besides, given the frequency of people asking what a **map marker** is, I don't think most solos bother to look at the end game load out screen anyway.
---
A good SWF isn't worrying about blood warden anytime soon, I assure you.
---
I NEED these as posters NOW!!
---
She's still good Imo but like the other guy said super inconsistent. I've been practicing her for over a and still have games where I chase the same guy for a couple gens and all 4 escape. What really screws her on console when more than framerate is the low ass sensitivity. Nurse needs to be able to turn super quick to deal with jukes.
---
Didn't read my second sentence, did you?
---
You realize this is my personal list yes? Hes asking what I would rate them, so I did. On *my* opinion. I rated them by *my* expirience with them. Meaning that theyre rated by *my* win to loss ratio with them and *my* chance of getting a 4k with them
---
I do the same with DbD, not to mention platformers, and single player games. Mouse and keyboard is not comfortable for long sessions. Overwatch, L4D, and Diablo are the only games I stick with M&amp;K because to not do so puts you at a big disadvantage. 
---
Does anybody think that maps will eventually get more editions such as the macmillan estate has? (example: The doctor receives another map instead of just the treatment theatre, and maybe clown has a circus map of his own. Even an addition to ormond where the map is primarily snowy ground and trees would be similar to rotten fields or shelter woods.) I think it would be a nice addition.
---
Side note: Does anybody know if the algorithm for determining the map is based on the realm or the map itself?
---
(When choosing a map, does it first choose the place, such as Coldwind farm or Macmillan estate, or are all the maps thrown together in a pool and one is chosen at random.)
---
I feel like if all the maps are chosen at random by just being thrown together, it would be unfair to maps that only have one or two variants instead of the original maps that have a few more variants.
---
fair enough 
---
Sprint Burst even works like Dead Hard, in that it negates hits from the rear like Dead Hard's ".5 second of no hitbox" thing. If the survivor disappears out of sight for a moment, sometimes you can miss which one it was. It's become easier to tell them apart now that Dead Hard has it's own animation though.
---
Is this what leatherface sees?
---
Me and a rando decided to do a backpacking build as pig. I downed them at the start and just chased everyone as per usual, only dropping them to hook the downed survivor or break a pallet. It was really funny, even if we only got 2 downs.
---
Well if you're far in the game you don't need that much gens anyway. And you never know if the killer has noed, bloodwarden until it happens. Or Whispers, sometimes you're not sure if they have Nurse's calling or if they are about to get Devour Hope and so on and that's never a downside. And even if it's not, well this change doesn't change anyway in your eyes so I'm not sure why we are arguing. :)
---
Amazing! Btw Myers has a giant knife lol
---
Yes. What /u/BaeTier was saying is what I was talking about. I don't think it's fair that the killer can see what items survivors are bringing in, allowing them to switch their perks around for what is being used.
---
xD
---
Flair
---
what's the point in getting kills with scammy perks if people don't learn how to *efficiently* trap? 
---
that's the problem with the killers these days. they all want to win instead of enjoying the game and killer powers. 
---
as survivor, I love being on Trapper's shoulders. but how I got there is most pleasure. if there was a trap I got into I didn't predict or he just pushed me into it - oof. that's hot. then it's a daddy Trapper to die for. 
---
i mean you replied -\ ('-')/-  i dunno.
---
I think it's great tbh. First of all, I love how at the start of the game you can see all generators in white and I think they turn to orange until a survivor touches it but I'm not 100% sure, I also really like that they made it so that when you kick the gen it stays highlighted in white and then lights up green when a survivor touches it again to indicate that a survivor has begun working on it again and you can go back to it and attack the survivors working on it to both slow the gen down and somewhat apply pressure. I feel like this perk will definitely help a lot more than it did before now and honestly with the right build, the right killer, and the right amount of skill you have on that killer, Surveillance might just lead to little to no gen progression for the survivors.
---
lmao that's not even a meta build, they just sucked
---
That is a significant buff to the killers and i'd say its totally fair and should be a thing from the start.
---
If you‚Äôre solo why does it matter that you can‚Äôt see killer perks? 
---
She's getting some check the PTB thread
---
Finally surveillance might be fucking useful 
---
Uh huh
---
Where‚Äôs nea
---
Why wouldn't it hurt them? My gameplay changes based off the survivors I'm going against and the items they have. If 3 of them have toolboxes and 1 has a flash light I know to ignore the obvious distraction and go for the ones focusing gens. 
---
Sprint Burst can help you extend looping, just in a different way. It's just the exhaustion perk with the least caveats. That's why it's probably generically the best. Sure the best players with the best connections might be able to make better use of DH, but if that's 5 percent of players, it's kind of irrelevant. Most would be better served just using sprint burst
---
How do you even get the PTB
---
I'm 25 xD
---
Only problem is, how often do you hear someone with a mic that is constantly making noise due to background noise. 
---
It was not on Ps3
---
you can only purchase the original killers and survivors with currency you earn by playing. 
---
licensed only with real money.
---
Bbq is basically usless outside of bloodpoints now. It literally has like 8 counters
---
I truly am sorry
---
Is this the Freddy rework
---
Is that you're only justification? The survivors don't know the killer so the killer shouldn't know the survivors? That's insanity. 
---
I used to make guides about how to be efficient with killer kits but nobody liked them. They just want 4ks. All they cared about. So I said fuck it and started making them guides about getting kills with false promises that they'll work at red ranks.
---
Valve got incredibly pissed off when microsoft basically told them they couldn't sell one of their DLC's for free (the sacrifice i beleive), despite them desperately wanting too. so they charged it on Xbox, made it free on PC and pretty much ignored console ever since then. 
---
That‚Äôs a nice edit. What did you use?
---
WhyUMad :)
---
Damn
---
Who just sits and waits 30 minutes? Cancel, try again. 
---
It was on Xbox 360, but Valve got incredibly pissed off when microsoft basically told them they couldn't sell one of their DLC's for free (the sacrifice i beleive), despite them desperately wanting too. so they charged it on Xbox, made it free on PC and pretty much ignored console ever since then.

You can tell Tombstone and Omega Blink by gameplay. You can look it up in game or online. It's not fucking hard, stop being lazy. Bye. üëã

---
Are there any updates planned past March of this year? Or will that be the last major update for the game?
---
I've had this lol. Was it invisible for your teammates?
---
They have mentioned it, but that'd be a lot of work for a character that only affects a very small percent of the player base and cannot make money from the store. So, probably a pipe dream for now. 
---
This change only impacts SWF. And if you're goal is to just see what the killer used against you, then just spectate for a couple minutes and look.
---
LMAO MEG'S GOT GRANDMA TITTIES
---
The hatch only spawns on the bottom level of the game.
---
‚ÄúNot you‚Äù made me chuckle.
---
That would make the perk still trash for SWF and borderline required for solo players. We want to push the two to the same level, not away. 
---
It chooses the maps individually. You'll see Coldwind Farms way more than Haddonfield or the Game, but you'll see each individual Coldwind map the same amount as Haddonfield or the Game.
---
Aw man, it kinda looks like Bill is sitting the same way he was when he first past. That's a nice nod
---
It‚Äôs not hard to hit rank 1, you can fart on a survivor and pip so yeah you see a lot of shitty killers at rank 1
---
Yes.
---
It's a good change, but experienced survivors can figure out your perks by the way you play anyway way before they are dead most of the time.
---
That is my favorite map by a large margin. :(
---
New animations that were added into the PTB! Aren't they cool? 
---
I don't mind the comms, just balance it accordingly.
---
I'm here
---
We'll have to wait and see for some people to crunch the numbers!
---
Can you stop being like....amazing? Thx.
---
Ive thought about starting a youtube channel with killer tutorials but I cant think of anything else to do on a youtube channel that hasnt already been done with DBD
---
Hell yeah they are! I can't wait to see the animations for everyone 
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 and i‚Äôm losing sleep
---
I think the biggest disconnect I have with your vying for hiding survivor items and clothes is that in the last statement you said was Throw the survivors a bone. The root cause of this change is to make it so the unfair advantage that‚Äôs gained by telling your group the killers loadout is negated. Yes, you can guess and assume the killer‚Äôs build within a few moments and for people who can tell by play styles can assume even addons after a moment or two. However that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the advantage you gain by telling your allies something they didn‚Äôt know beforehand was not intended from the game‚Äôs direction. If you‚Äôre good at figuring out a build in game then this changes nothing. It‚Äôs allowing perks and addons to have the ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù moment someperks have built into them to actually exist like that. 
---
Even when you know the spawn locations it will take 3 minutes to find and break them all... 14 seconds per totem plus travel time and potentially checking the wrong spawn locations will put you at around 2.5-3 minutes being generous.
---
Can't tell if it's tombstone if you die before he hits t3 and you can't know if it's omega blink just by gameplay LOL. It's pretty telling what you said earlier, I would take a guess that you would be one of the only people to do that. Similar to how cheaters are always paranoid about their spouses. Rofl.
---
It's not the same at all actually.
---
Play a lot. I also recommend OhTofu's videos. He makes good tutorials for various things.
---
These remind me of League of Legends splash arts for some reason
---
These are really fr*cking awesome
---
So detailed, yet so rushed. So messy, but so clean. You sir have incredible talent and should pursue it! I hope you do the Legion soon!
---
They will update the schedule as more time passes. I think the devs want to have a loose map because they can‚Äôt reliably date map everything like a bigger developer/company. 
---
It certainly isn't bad, but with the healing nerfs it isn't as good. If the killer has sloppy butcher healing yourself will take longer than a full gen. I think you could live without it with bond or being in a SWF, but it's still decent.
---
Thank you
---
Imagine downvoting someone for asking a legit question in a post...
---
Nah , i have 11 done so far :) . Ill post them all when im finished 
---
Username checks out
---
(I edited, I messed up ohtofus name, thanks!) 
---
A week or so ago, I got whipped by StreamDad and his group.  I had to ask them in post game chat..  "Is this the real SteamDad?", and they laughed and we talked for a bit.  It was the nicest curbstomping I've ever received.  He's genuinely a great streamer to watch for survivors, just a good example of a good human being for that matter.  
---
Works nicely if you find the hatch and someone has a key
---
I wish , but alas . Its a curse :( 
---
What I find funny is that your concept of balance is in fact balanced, but has long since been abandoned by the gaming industry as a whole. Perfect balance can in fact be achieved, but is boring as hell and should rb avoided as it kills games.
---
So while you're sitting here telling me that's horrible balance, I'm in agreement, it is. However that is the point. Only IN horrible balance can one find worth.
---
Is a virgin still a virgin after they've had sex?  :)  
---
Thank you! I was just curious.
---
Thank you üòÇ,and yeah legion is done already. Posting the full thing soon 
---
They‚Äôre planning more updates in Spring. This December was the groundwork and they‚Äôll add onto it later on. 
---
Im going to have to disagree. When games arent balanced, it just creates frustration. In any game.
---
Losing 90% of games isnt fun. Neither is winning 90% of games.
---
Losing half and winning half is what keeps things neither boring nor frustrating
---
At low ranks because i don't really see NOED or Hex at high red ranks as often
---
Slugging is generally a situational thing. You don't really want to do it all the time, but sometimes it can be effective. If you have downed all but one survivors, getting the last one means you win unless someone has unbreakable/no mither. Also if there's a bunch of survivors hovering around you trying to flashlight save or block, it may be better to just leave the other person on the ground and force them to heal while you go for downs. Also if you're trying to avoid a ds you might slug that survivor.
---
sleepy boi
---
No
---
Yeah, I would blame it on totems becoming the first priority due to everyone running NOED after the buff.
---
Yeah but if we had that then we'd have more threads about how Jen Denise is ruining the game by resetting her rank
---
yes. yes indeed it is.
---
I love the Style.
---
well, the whole thing about YouTube is that you have to be appealing. I've seen many small channels where genuinely good guides have little to no views in years just because people don't want to watch those when someone has an unpleasant voice or bad way of editing. 
---
look at any top dbd YouTuber, they all are pleasant to eye/ear and editing is pretty smooth. couldn't say they do something very special. 
---
I want it too. IIRC the devs said it's tricky to implement since it's both torso and head costume, might heard wrong.
---
Look up Guilty Gear Slash if you're interested in a case example of perfect balance. The game flopped because it was boring as hell since it was perfectly balanced. Every Guilty Gear veteran will say the same thing, perfectly balanced, perfectly boring.

Dude holy shit, these are amazing. What colour is your hag?
---
And i love you .........................
---
I never have thought she was ugly. Well her new hair I think is so damn ugly in my opinion though lol. 
---
True thats the other issue i run into. Most of the time I don't even do commentary. When my girlfriend is watching me she has to ask me why I'm doing something, then i explain it, then complete silence. Ive never been good at the whole commentary thing.
---
Nea is best killer
---
Thanks , and shes a purplish red . In between the clown and huntress üëçüèΩ
---
Also they upped the blood point reward for ambushing. 100 for initiating the dash up from 50, and 500 for hitting up from 250.
---
&gt;Okay if i play with my friends ill tell them we cant talk because were giving ourselves a competitive advantage :p. 
---
Lol nobody says that you can't enjoy your advantage dude, I play in an SWF all the time. It makes the game more fun when I can chat with my buddies. I'm honest about it's advantages. Why aren't you?? 
---
&gt;See how stupid that sounds?
---
I think it's stupid that you made up an argument that I didn't write and attribute it to me, lol. 
---
Since regressing gens turn yellow when they stop regressing it let's you know when someone touched the Gen. That's still useful knowledge.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Can‚Äôt wait to see her :)
---
pretend she always asks "whatcha doin?" and answer consistently. having questions in your head makes it easier to explain anything. 
---
Lol you apparently have only heard of people saying infinite loops and werent around when they consistently existed throughout a large portion of maps.
---
Freddy now slows down when holding M2- to a crawl.
---
Don't know if its intentional since it's not included but thought I'd mention it
---
ive been playing at rank 1 (on console) for a few months now, noed got rly prevalent during the event and so far its been carrying over. havent met a wraith without noed in so long (even had a michael use it once :T). 90% of games ive been in have hex (that gets destroyed within a minute ofc)
---
That's kind of lame. It's not like killers don't get to use their perks after one has died. Your noed is probably not gonna activate anyway...
---
Good point.
---
I wish my internet wasnt shit. I used to stream a ton back in the day. The constant flow of comments kept me talking
---
I wonder if this is actually canon 
---
I really hope that it is. I would rather they spend time and resources on something else. Dead by Daylight 2 for PC and next gen consoles would be ideal. We also need optimization, various improvements/balancing, and new game modes in what we already have. New chapters should be at the bottom of the list imo. 
---
Thats great man. Glad to hear it. What's your favorite add ons?
---
Sounds like bots are coming back.
---
This is not rare lol
---
Maybe. I‚Äôm on PS4 (Yes a console peasant) so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that. I might be wrong though.
---
If they allowed solos to see the perks, it could still be abused because the dead people can always add the others in-game and tell them what perks the killer is running. I've had this help dozens of time from dead survivors that tell me the killer is running blood warden or where the hatch is.
---
Just stop being merciful. I like to make them as tilted as they try to make me. It really evens things out. If they don‚Äôt want you to do it but it‚Äôs fun.... do it, oh, and always mori streamers lmao.
---
don't like these too. tru3 is a one trick pony with massive ego, n00b still doesn't know what he is with his identity crisis so he can't make consistent content he himself enjoys. never watched Tyde.
---
do you know Ardetha? I think he's pretty great and his Dark Academy series are really cool with information. he's also a really good Nurse. 
---
If you die to not Tombstone then knowing he had Tombstone would be irrelevant to you, since it's irrelevant to how you died. There's no "how did he kill me like that?" moment to let from. Only reason it would matter is to tell your SWF buddies. And even now when they can see them I still see people asking about perks and add-ons they've encountered, so as I said before plenty solos don't look anyway.
---
And Omega Blink isn't super easy to suss out, no, but the range can become pretty obvious. If they just hooked someone on one end of the map and then suddenly they're on top of you.... It's not rocket surgery. It's also not super relevant knowledge after you're dead. Even not seeing her add-ons you can recognize she had range and know to be aware of it later. And since you can't see the add-ons before death seeing which ones specifically created the effect is irrelevant.
---
Face it, your argument is dumb. This change effects *no one* but SWFs. So stop crying about your ability to cheat getting nerfed.
---
&gt;Why should there be a bonus for just playing the game?
---
Well from a design standpoint, it's an incentive to keep playing. If you are a player who was all characters and perks unlocked, if the game starts feeling stale, which it can from time to time, the player could possibly quit playing. If they give more incentives to play, it's possible it could keep those players playing more.
---
I tend to use the trapper bag and trap setting speed, but I‚Äôm a bit stingy with addons, for some reason I tend to just hoard them :/
---
Oh, surveilance? Nah, it's decent now, but far from OP
---
I mean it pretty clearly affects me if I want to know what add ons they were using. Were you dropped on your head or something? Whole world doesn't revolve around your small understanding that it doesn't lmfao
---
That's amazing..clown is looking thiccc as always. 
---
I'll have to check him out. Theres this one guy I used to watch i forget the name of. I think their name was marth88 or something
---
Right, and built in range limited communication would address that while also buffing playing solo survivor
---
Probably trying to de-pip as much as possible so when the rank reset occurs this week they will be as "low" as possible.
---
I don't know about PC, but it doesn't matter on console. You just directly message them, or start a voice chat, and it pops up no matter what they're doing. If they're spectating they can just go back to the results screen to look. It's not difficult.
---
I feel that. Thats me with Pig. I horde the casette tape add one. Never use them even though i have literal hundreds of them for fear of using them all
---
People would just turn it off or abuse it if it was forced on
---
Oh they do but brutality can be capped out fairly easily if you‚Äôre having a good game whereas a disconnect prevents you from earning your sacrifice points that you‚Äôd get for killing them, thus allowing a surv to dc in order to ruin a 32k game. It‚Äôs happened to me way more times than I‚Äôd like to say.
---
Ill leave him be 
---
This is me with Freddy every time. I use Remember Me and NOED because I think I will need it. nope gens not even finished.
---
That doesnt get you a game any faster anyways. 
---
Maybe for some. Most people that try and de pip usually DC.
---
macros. it de-ranks yet gives points to both sides. can't complain about those at least on pc. doing the deranking manually is a piece of ass if you want to go down a colour for shorter queues. 
---
Can‚Äôt wait!
---
If you're *rank 1* you should probably not try to learn a killer you're not familiar with until reset.
---
Troll/10. Would point and laugh at again.
---
OK IM NOT CRAZY
---
I thought I was bad this entire time for being unable to track these scratch marks D:
---
I like Claudette's((biased)), Bill's, Quentin, Tapp, and Nea's. Claudette and Quentin's screams out to me that their situation sucks. 
---
I know. I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else has seen more of it happening.
---
Autism at its finest
---
I'm on PS4 too, and I don't even know of they're legit players?? I mean, whether they're people or not, I'm not complaining tbh. 
---
My friends and I got the hatch using a key &amp; we got the achievement lol. But otherwise, I do believe it's a problem on the rise. 
---
When a survivor is giving me a really good run around, is it best to keep going, or to move on? I'm low rank, and sometimes a survivor is just better at looping than I am with killing, especially in spots like the killer shack, or if those walled areas are close to each other. If I've been going at them for a while I'll generally just walk away and go find someone else (mainly bc I worry about gens getting done while that survivor distracts me). Do you think that's effective? 
---
Ya. Me and a friend have been getting them more. 
---
You‚Äôre right flashlighting is just a game mechanic... that can be really irritating when spammed. So to have fun again, I just spam dat mori son XD. Did it to a streamer swf today. Reaaaallly satisfying. Especially since his buddies really wanted to save him. They got to squirm on some hooks after bc 4 gens with three people can be pretty difficult. 
---
autism
---
The world doesn't revolve around your small misunderstanding that it does. If you want to know, wait. It's not fucking hard. JFC. So many children in this community.
---
And the rest got buffed so it balances out somewhat and still ends up being a net buff. 
---
I pretty much agree with you (though it really does suck if you‚Äôre the unhooked survivor). That being said, I really don‚Äôt think it was necessary to be a dick and call them a ‚Äòtwat‚Äô. 
---
You're actually brain damage inducing, you should probably stop posting on this sub
---
Aw, sorry to hear about your autism.
---
‚ÄúA pretty good jooob sooooo ffffaaaarrrr‚Äù
---
Don't worry after this next patch you won't be able to see the loadout till after the game.
---
Well the roadmap is only meant to show the plan for this year, next year will be a new map.
---
oh, shit, sorry, your phrasing is bit confusing.
---
I actually haven't seen those very often at all. to be frank, I can only remember one Wraith back in summer and one Wraith in autumn. lots of people here say they see macros a lot even in my region but I can't relate. 
---
I hate PTBs. No one actually tests things and it‚Äôs legit mori paradise. It frustrates me. Like why are you here if you‚Äôre not testing out anything, you know? Might as well be on the Live server. 
---
You seem confused, I'm calling you autistic. Oh you're acting the part.
---
sometimes you just really really really don't feel like swf. if there's even a small chance the people are on discord together, you just don't want that shit. 
---
I dunno, you're either some pro killer with nerves of steel or never even play killer(or very low rank) if you came here to bitch about such a small issue of people avoiding potential bullying. 
---
That‚Äôs one person in an entire community, no offense but your sentiment doesn‚Äôt really mean anything since even if one person wouldn‚Äôt abuse voice comms there‚Äôs a group out there who would.
---
HALT
---
‚ÄúOkay‚Äù
---
30 mins ago had a Claudette try to hook save a Claudette after the gates were open as I was playing Myers.  Went EW3 and downed them after they made the save, they DC'd as I tossed them on the hook... so I ran down the saved Claudette and hooked them again.
---
I was just doing a daily, was only my second or third hook when exit gates were powered.  My 1K turned into a 2K +DC because these idiots tried to hook rush a Myers a long ways from either gate.
---
Skemoo your work is amazing! Plz let me have your babies! But in 4K!
---
The entity doesn‚Äôt only feed on hope as discussed in the lore stream.
---
besides, don't know about others, but literally for few days playing killer every day I'd always get swf. 3-4 men parties. in a row. for 4 days straight. it's really annoying. I am a rank 1 killer but sometimes disbalance is too much. I don't even play top tier killers apart from Rin and Lisa. 
---
Someone still use the shrine? Sure its usefull when you want X perk from a survivor/killer that you dont have and dont want to buy and lvl up just for that perk, but with the store you are better just saving shards for cosmetics and to buy the actual survivor/killer. And at some point the shrine becomes a 150k bp machine with no other use
---
The problem I can see if they hide survivor items is that Squad Claudette all running flashlights chasing down the killer
---
He's a pro rank 15 legion evader, don't question him idiot
---
Well they probably do have more chapters in development rn but fingers crossed that their will be an second game 
---
wtf
---
This is not a stupid question as there are plenty of new players to this game that can learn from it. Also as someone else said yes it does.
---
I would love to use your Trapper one as a phone background. With your permission?
---
Quick question.
---
As killer should you head back to an unhook if you have not found someone yet? And wouldn‚Äôt it be smarter to down the injured person if it‚Äôs not too out of the way? Is this considered tunneling?
---
No hate here just gauging opinions.
---
the op just showed a video proof where Legion hits twice in Frenzy and survivor is down. 
---
If you can't hit the skill checks with ruin you shouldn't be repairing with others.
---
By forcing players to play every lobby, you will get more ingame DCs. Because with current matchmaking you will get red ping lobbies quite regularly. And sometimes you need to watch pings for 25-30 seconds to see if they're stable enough.
---
&gt; And survivors need to stop being such sweaty toxic assholes.
---
Write it couple times more, it will surely help.
---
what add-ons did they have?
---
Just make it to be only able to purchase both parts together and when you equip the head or torso it autoequips the other part and as soon as you remove one of the parts the other instantly changes to feng default hair/torso
---
So does it turn yellow when it reaches zero progress or whenever it starts being working on? Can you easily figure out which gens are being done? This seems like it‚Äôs probably better than whispers if you can keep an eye on gens.
---
I might not be understanding these changes at all though. 
---
No it does not. Why in the hell would you split the player base when it is already not that deep to begin with?
---
Then it would be like some 3 year old CoD game with there being 20 people in each game mode instead of one big raffle-type deal.
---
I mean not on ptb so it was to be expected otherwise they would have to redo the add ons
---
Yeah had a couple friends that used to play DBD every night on PS4...now only one other person still plays due to the queue times. The game is really fun but waiting for a match for so long isn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt get this issue when solo queuing.
---
So what Jason has his own game? The game ie dead now and Jason is also gotten his own puzzle game. He's been in Mortal Kombat also, the license isn't hard at all to get
---
You are asking this questions to one of the saltiest, toxic communities. None of this is going to happen, but if they're a shitty way of doing something, someone in dBD will do it. 
---
Games are designed around what's best for the game, not what makes the most sense. If we are arguing for what makes sense then why can Clown outrun Meg? Asthmatic fat man can outrun college-level athlete.
---
Probably a bug since it isn't mentioned anywhere in the patch notes. They made exhaustion reset on being hooked since Survivors complain about camping. Unhook immunity and exhaustion reset were made to counter camping.
---
~X~
---
I mean, he's evading my offer pretty adeptly so I guess you're right.
---
I think you misunderstood what I‚Äôm saying. Let me rephrase. The killer should not have a lobby open where they see people join. They should remain in matchmaking screen like survivors. Once connected everyone joins the lobby together. Everything remains the same, but killers won‚Äôt be so quick to leave if they have 100% no idea if a SWF joined or not. Still check for red ping and make changes. Just everyone loads into the lobby together. 
---
This is pretty much what I was dealing with every night...until my friends decided to go back to CoD and Fortnite because they don‚Äôt gotta wait as long to play.
---
You think we'll get 2 weeks? That'd be generous.
---
That's why I've been bringing Franklin's to any match with even a single flashlight. That way I don't have to worry about getting blinded at a pallet, plus the dummies often go back for the flashlight, no matter where it dropped.
---
you do realise it's a new ptb, right? and op is just informing the community. and you here just said an obvious thing everyone who plays dbd knows. 
---
This game has always been awful teaching new players things. I highly recommend looking up the DBD Case Files on youtube. It gives a really good detail on what are killers best perks, and how people play those killers. 
---
I think this is the only game I'm being told I'm cheating because I want to talk to my friends on party chat, don't get me wrong I do understand the advantages of using it (that is why I was agreeing with bill a bit up on the thread), but I think it's rough to call on ethical implications for playing a game, because it's just a game. And also I've yet to see a sign in game telling me I'm cheating because of this. I don't think the solution is removing it (which is impossible to be honest) maybe something needs to happen on the killers side of things (balancing) so they can counter that kind of gameplay, I dunno.
---
Devotion 3 rank 1 survivor/killer. Just annoyed with how much time I spend waiting for a survivor game because killers are afraid to just play. That‚Äôs all. 
---
I had that same person dc from my spirit match the other day because the vaulted into my face.
---
Is....is that new? As far as I know they sat stock-still
---
A small but very welcome addition to the game, to say the least. :)   
---
(Small note: your imgur link to Bill's animation is the same one on Feng's. Can you upload Feng's?)
---
So you're talking about new matchmaking system that devs said is coming some time soon. It'll work just like that: killers will see 4 survivors joining lobby pretty much simultaneously no matter if they're 4 solos or 4-man swf.
---
The hell, this is a meme, keep your politics out of it
---
No shit! Sorry I guess I overlooked that announcement. Well then. Just like everything else I‚Äôll just wait! Thanks for letting me know!
---
It's amusing that it's identical to the Tier down noise. But that is actually is part of the film's score.
---
I actually stay after every game to watch for 2 reasons.
---
1. This game is really entertaining to watch. Seeing people getting chased by a killer.
---
2. I'm pissed because I've been looping the killer for 5 minutes and no generators were started. Watching with judgement on everyone's actions. 
---
Steam workshop and ingame store doesnt mix
---
This is gonna be lit fam. 
---
Ahh, so you're thinking it'll occur in February? I didn't think of that...the wording in the announcement made it seem like it'd be the last week of January which would suck for me. I hope you're right! It makes sense it'd coincide with the Chinese New Year, for sure. 
---
Feng's animation is in the same gif as Bills! 
---
Since they were sitting next to each other, I recorded some survivors in one gif.
---
which platform?
---
devotion 6(almost 7) rank 1 killer/survivor pc EU zone. can't fukin blame a single killer to quit a lobby because thought it's swf. it's not killer's fault. swf was and is imbalance that Devs can't get rid of cause then they'll lose a large portion of playerbase. don't blame players. if they don't want to deal with imbalance, it's their right to quit a lobby. 
---
This patch is only to nerf SWF. When you are playing with a group of friends, if your friend dies, he'll be able to see all the killer's perks at the end game screen. So he can tell you what perks killer has. 
---
These are sweet
---
Jen "The Derank " Denise 
---
In so glad we're finally talking about this shit, and to be fair OP she's not the only streamer who does this. Sxyhxy and many others pull this stunt as well so lets not just go on a crusade for 1 streamer but all 
---
Until a random survivor keeps chasing to heal you. That's why I stopped using resilience when not swf.
---
And that's a big part of the problem, players are using an outside advantage to work around limitations set by game mechanics (as evidence by the fact that certain perks grant you this information) yet get butthurt when you call them out on it.
---
Using voice comms is cheating. Full stop
---
Cheating is unethical IMO
---
\&gt; can we buff (anything related to) Freddy?   
---
Blood Warden got a significant QoL improvement this patch.
---
Having a literally broken character isn't ok though 
---
Just because GTAV has long loading screens doesn't mean this one should have GAME BREAKING INFINITE LOADING. This logic makes no fucking sense.
---
The killer population has gotta be in the double digits at this point. Not even an /s mate I can wait 30 minutes for a match as a survivor or wait 5 seconds to play as a killer. Time to dust off the ol p3 nurse I guess, it‚Äôs been a while.
---
It's a stupid joke on this sub about Nea being a killer because of how she looks or something. 
---
I think it's fine the way it is. Maybe if they add another 2 dlc's or so add a 5th but I think it's fine right now. It's not like the shrine is the most beneficial thing. I'd rather just save my shards for killers or characters I don't want to buy with cash money.
---
This why streamers hate this subreddit.A bunch of "killer mains" trying to justify their shitty/toxic behavior.If your strategy is to face camp in the beginning or middle of match then its just you hoping and praying  that you can take advantage of over altruistic survivors.
---
Been rank 1 killer several seasons(not hard btw)and the only time I get wrecked by swf is because I played badly.Survivors have loops and pallets but bloodlust counters that eventually.If you're foolish enough to get looped for 5 gens then its your own fault.Camping hook is a legit strategy only on open gates or 2 survivors left in game.If you think a swf group is gonna be toxic just offer up a mori.Killers have ways to balance the game but its alot easier to blame the survivors when killers play bad
---
I main survivor and it seems there‚Äôs a drought of killers lately 
---
Imagine this + the doctor + the trapper perk that reduce qte + overcharge... this is why it has to stay as a hex, even if it make it a "not so good" perk
---
Can we get the RANKING system changed??? If you have a face camping killer, (which is all the time on PS4 now) and you cannot save that person because the killer will knock you or grab you and throw you to the ground until that hooked person DIES, then start the process all over again. SINCE THE DEVS WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT CAMPING, I want the ranking system changed, since we get a PENALTY for not unhooking survivors because are hands are tied because of a face camping killer! From rank 2 to 20 it‚Äôs bad on PS4. The other day I was in a game and the guy camped his first victim, so we all did gens, next guy got picked up and camped, we finish the gens, killer knocks me since it was a Billy with his chainsaw. He camps me while the last person makes it out alive via hatch, since I didn‚Äôt waste my time on the hook. Get to the emblem screen and I piped down -1 and it shows a -64 for unhooked survivors penalty, I did 2 gens by myself and 2 totems and I get screwed over because of some face camping CHILD! So since the devs won‚Äôt do anything to fix camping, I have this to offer, I want the penalty for hooked survivors removed and the killers can camp all they want!!! People are still gonna unhook people for the points, but when they are camping with their chainsaw ready to go, there isn‚Äôt much you can do and we get penalized for it!  
---
They really missed a chance to include an animated finger guns for ace with this change
---
Can‚Äôt speak for PS4 but solo queue on Xbox is long as well, sometimes you get lucky and sometimes there are literally no killers and I‚Äôm waiting for 30 minutes.
---
Leader doesnt work on gens, prove thyself will end up just putting teamwork gens around the same efficiency as they used to be before they were nerfed. (2 people on a gen used to be 200% speed but it was nerfed)
---
My post was mostly in jest but hopefully they don‚Äôt screw that up too bad with enough feedback. 
---
Who‚Äôs your friend that likes to play?!
---
-smacks wailing bell- BING BONG BING BONG
---
Is there any reason why someone hiding in a locker right before a hook would piss off a survivor?
---
I just got BMd by two people in different games after I did this. (They failed a non ruin skill check on gens we were both working on) Both were prestiged.
---
 Do older players maybe not know about lockers now countering BBQ? Or is there some other reason?
---
There is a big difference between Mortal Kombat purchasing the right to Jason when they are backed by corporate juggernauts. Also, that puzzle game is reeeeeally old. But who knows, maybe F13 having major hiccups might mean Jason will indeed become a dbd killer. Don't see much of a point for adding, but then again we have Hillbilly and Leatherface lmao
---
They 100 can see if, and assume, SWF when survivors load in. I spend more time starting a new search as a solo queue then actually playing the game. 
---
I think the Spirit was more inspired by the Grudge.
---
Stab Wounds Study plus Frank's Mix Tape, both purple but it may be possible to do this with only the mixtape although I haven't tested it myself
---
I mean.. yeah? 
---
Maybe stop being so toxic, most swf groups seem to be more interested in teabag bullying than actually playing the game
---
With how broken this game is with it's code, I dont even know if SWF Survivors being in the same match together is even charted anywhere. Like how you have to relobby up after every game. Once they put this patch in it's going to be a wait until they add sWF tracking. 
---
BBQ is hard to not use when you have it due to BP's but NOED, come on... It's not that good on killers that can stall or knockout with their powers like Cannibal, Hillbilly or Myers... It's a waste of a slot, yes it's funny sometimes but if I can avoid playing the door game, I sure do. Blood Warden is way more fun as an endgame perk.
---
When they ‚Äúsleep‚Äù they see the bloodweb so maybe Quentin just spent all his BP ü§î
---
Helped me slow down the game quite a lot and get a 3 gen strat going with pig.
---
It's not going to be meta changing except maybe doctor because it is really good for 3 gen strats.
---
Wow! This is exactly how my dad used to draw when I was a kid. He used to amaze me as I kept telling him what to draw next. This seriously takes me back. Thanks, OP!
---
The first time I used an ebony mori, I only got one successful kill. After that the 4th guy I hooked immediately suicided, and other two DCd as soon as I caught them. I've since gotten a 4k mori, but good luck with it 
---
\*guys noed isnt op you just need to find 5 hard-to-find totems to counter a perk they might not even have\*
---
And people say rank matters.
---
Huntress can down a survivor with a single use of her power with purple add-ons.
---
Billy and Bubba don't even need addons.
---
Legion still needs you to be injured in the first place.
---
Does this make Legion considerably better, potentially within the same tier as the Huntress as a very good (with addons) killer? Absolutely. 
---
Is this unplayably broken and will lead to a 100% winrate with no hope for survivors? Absolutely not.
---
Overcharge/SB/Wake up all good.
---
The other one seems pretty useless compared to other stuff you can be running, will pass.
---
This is my first time seeing a scribble sketch.. holy shit
---
I main Hag, Pig and Freddy, so not an incredible amount of chasers. I've always favored stealth in every game I play but it's not incredible with being looped. At least not if I don't have Hag/Pid add-ons that speed up trap placement and crouching.
---
I know. But my point is that it's irrelevant. There's other ways of messaging. 
---
Normally in the first 1-2mins of the game I have it figured out what the killer is running, and if your not sure about noed, just break all 5 totems and no worries, I would love to see the killers face when the last gen is done and his noed perk doesn‚Äôt light up lol! 
---
This is why i run franklins. You gonna taunt me at gate? Say bye to your gear.
---
Hey can you send me the patch notes 
---
the inner weeb is squealing at the high school outfit for spirit.
---
Dude it's a trade off. They're for sure doing that every time now, so just get used to it for one. Two, that means that the event skins are probably going to be pretty good every time. 
---
I bet that mask goes well with the hallowed body
---
I keep mine open, they're like trophies.
---
If SWF groups can guess killer perks, why can't solo survivors? I've only played solo survivor and can generally make an educated guess as to what the killer is running.
---
The solution is to not make it impossible to get them all
---
Wait what NOED buff? 
---
Yeah. That's the new buff. Get used to it 
---
What? Self Care, Leader, Prove Thy Self, and vaulting just got buffs....
---
I know I was asking for him to render her because she doesn‚Äôt have many cosmetics 
---
&gt; Huntress can down a survivor with a single use of her power with purple add-ons.
---
Not really
---
And i love you ..
---
Adren &gt; DS imo, but DS still leaves that juicy sting lol.  
---
The game is brighter, and imo looks better because there isn't vaseline smeared across the screen (FXAA). I would gladly use Ultra if a real antialiasing option was available.
---
Well let's just hope in the future a solution can be found that could satisfy all 3 groups, thanks for the discussion!
---
I main Hag, and the best way to pressure a loop is by placing a trap mid-chase; this is more effective if you have an add on that lets you place traps faster. If you place it on the other side of a pallet, they can't really use the pallet to stun you, so long as you didn't place it too close.
---
Generally though, it's a good strategy to break a chase if it looks like it's not gonna end in your favor. Protecting the gens is important, and time is your most valuable asset as a killer!
---
You have your opinion but let me share mine.
---
Billy has 115% movement speed while spirit has 110%
---
If Billy catches someone in the open, then the chase ends there.
---
Billy can instantly break pallets
---
Billy has map pressure
---
A good Billy will not be looped for more than a minute depending on the map
---
I do have to say, they need to stop pussyfooting around with minor changes. I cannot recall the last time they did a major nerf or redesign besides this upcoming SWF change.
---
Xbox One?
---
Before engine update low settings gave you more visibility. Also, for multiplayer games a lot of players prefer more/stable fps to eye candy. Also, if you stream/record on the same pc, low settings allow for more demanding encoder settings
---
Strange, I see no reason why people would get mad at that. It's a valid strategy. I think people just get salty about getting hooked and need an outlet, if anything. I feel it's unjustified though, personally.
---
I saw that one, it looks really good 
---
15 fps will do that to a game.
---
‚ÄúSurvivor are OP‚Äù :‚Äô( 
---
You already get 5k bloodpoints if the killer DC's.
---
Using noed on huntressü§îü§îü§î
---
Noed on an instadown killerü§îü§îü§î
---
you think the audio thing was a bad change? other than that, removing the 16seconds cap is basically what they did
---
Yeah he‚Äôs an meh killer and now he has a good build he still won‚Äôt be top tier he‚Äôll just be better
---
If you are chasing as a Spirit without using her power and trying to trick survivors, you are playing wrong.
---
I've literally caught survivors that vault into my arms by standing still as Spirit. Say that about Billy with a straight face.
---
So no wonder why at rank 14, BTW this is rank 14, I see so many p3 characters with D's and they act like they are from rank 7 to rank 1 as they would 360, loop me and counter almost everything I do. I'm also see alot swf as there are rank 10s to rank 2s in my matches sometimes. This idea of deranking really wants me to just take a break after getting recently in October when it was on sale. I guess I wasted about 34 dollars getting the game and 4 dlc packs. The sad thing is I'm literally forced to put NOed because of this and then I'm called a camper and a trash killer after they gen rush and me being forced to try and secure kills at the end trying to not derank. I can't learn anything new due to people deranking as survivors due to people like Ochido and that streamer the user mentioned. Rant is over and I think I'mma take a break from this game. I would rather play games with less toxic survivors like call of duty or war thunder as at least it's way less compared to dbd.
---
"I don't think the system works"
---
thats what friday the 13th does
---
survivors can only hear you if you are in the same vicinity as them but jason can hear you to if he is nearby
---
unless you have found a walkie talkie then you can talk to anyone with a walkie talkie over the entire map for as long as you are alive
---
Can you quietly vault a pallet without a perk. By crouching or something?
---
Yikes, as if playing against Legion wasn't already cancerous enough.
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!
---
That's just evil bro
---
I don't really have problems with fps even with higher encoder settings. My fps is always at 60 unless the game bugs out, then idk.
---
Wot? People can hit me on the side I stick the most out on and LF chainsaw would hit both. And I think I'll only use this to rescue mates who r being face camped. 
---
Survivors that fall for that are dumb as hell and no smart person is going to fall for that
---
Looking forward to it! You have talent.
---
Yeah, that would be nice. And I kind of like the darkness, it's more spooky when a killer suddenly pops out of a corner.
---
Juggling wastes time just as much as letting the person use DS, it doesn't help. Ds massively wastes the killer's time and ruins his pressure. That's why people hate it, not because "they haven't learned about it"
---
Dont run while vaulting. Just walk &amp; vault
---
Suddenly I'm a Feng main
---
Billy has better mobility, and an insta-down.
---
But he still has to deal with pallets and windows. A good Spirit player will 4k without breaking a single pallet, because she never needs to.
---
I think Billy is an incredibly strong killer, he was easily number 2 before the Spirit, but his position has been usurped. I still have way more fun playing Billy, but I disagree that he's better than her.
---
Spirit is basically the "fair" version of Nurse, except for Prayer Beads. Those things just shouldn't exist.
---
Someone already [posted them all] (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adys7r/the_new_campfire_idle_animations_are_awesome).
---
I strongly disagree.Rewarding killers for not doing their objective(stopping gens) by giving them 1 hit downs and more speed is the most broken thing you can think of.It can be countered by cleansing every totem but that still doesn't make it any more balanced.Good killers can provide enough map pressure already so cleansing totems before all gens are done every single match is just another built in ruin.
---
But any Survivor can have any perk, so it's a bit useless?
---
Don't worry about your stats and just learn, learn, learn. When you're this new, don't worry about trying to find a 'main' too soon. Try and get everyone up to around lvl 5 and then 10 so you unlock the perk slots. But since there's no real 'practice' mode, the only real practice is playing.
---
You must have strength and persist brother lol
---
It did as did spine chill and resilience.
---
I think they‚Äôre pretty even. 
---
Ok how about this. Vs optimal survivors that aren't stupid and know how to loop, spirit is better than Billy. Good survivors won't be caught in the open vs Billy and if they are they can Dodge his chainsaw. A good spirit is pretty much a death sentence. You ain't gonna loop her for long.

I was once going against a Freddy and all 3 of my allies (randos) disconnected. So he just kept putting me to sleep, I kept waking up and running around doing gens. I had Harry Nilsson's "Best Friend" in my head the whole time.
---
One of the only times I've farmed voluntarily, but it was actually incredibly fun. Opened the gate, ran out, upvoted. Sometimes little games like that can be fun, but I'd also say that if you're not communicating with other people, there's no such things as 'considered okay.' If he'd killed me outright, I wouldn't have been salty in the least cause that's what the damn game's about.
---
Prayer beads need to fuck off other than that I really don‚Äôt see how she is better than Billy.
---
Franklins is a salt mine my friend 
---
i believe it is
---
Add ons matter a lot I think. No add on Billy imo is better than no add on Spirit. But the best add ons for both? Spirit by far.
---
I can agree with this. I think even green add on spirit is better (the speed and duration ones) 
---
No it‚Äôs not, can you send me a link to download these icons please :)
---
It is unplayably broken. Forget about 100% winrate. What is a single survivor supposed to do against this legion? A surv can out maneuver huntress for at least a little while. You're not even playing a video game when going against this legion. That's one thing that people are complaining about.
---
Pretty good job so far?
---
Had the opposite happen to me:
---
Was a survivor in a match where one person didn't load in. Don't know what happened but while I'm working on my first gen both other survivors DC. Nurse finds me, but I manage to escape and heal up. Then they find me again while I'm trying to get a generator done. Caught. Hooked.
---
Not bothered because it wasn't the killers fault the rest of my "team" were useless.
---
Killers: Gen rushing is a serious problem and the developers should fix it. 
---
Developers: Prove Thyself will be buffed to increase repair speed. 
---
Yea me too, usually I get 2 totems and my team get the rest.
---
Because in the end everyone was capable of doing everything everyone else did. While doing it in different ways, it was still the same shit. It was boring, there was no challenge or any real feeling of accomplishment. There was no underdog tale. The idea that there is no power disparity and that it is entirely on you, was actually MORE intimidating and MORE repelling to new players.
---
Much like survivor is boring because after awhile all the different survivors are, is skins on the same batch of mechanics. The only variation comes at, are you a boy or girl? Otherwise it doesn't matter if you are Bill or Nea or Meg. Claudette is the only one that offers any true reason beyond camera angles to play her. Even then it is kinda an unintended consequence to her darker palette rather than any meaningful choice.
---
That makes Survivor play less engaging. The unique perks were the only thing creating meaningful decisions and after long enough that goes. Granted it did make some survivors more niche, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. That's why Killer feels more meaningful in choices, the unique powers make the killers play wholly different and that makes them feel more than skins.
---
That's two different examples of why "balance" can be boring or bad.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll go through as is. They‚Äôd have to be on some special kind of drugs to let that through
---
Prove Thyself still sucks because it gives point gen in the category that already gives the MOST POINT GEN. It is a useless perk. 
---
Why can't any of you fucks read?
---
&gt;When Spine Chill is active, Skill Check IconHelp skillChecks.png trigger odds are increased by 10 % with success zones reduced by 10 % and your Repair, Heal and Sabotage speeds are increased by 2/4/6 %
---
‚ÄúWhat? With him? *Looks* ugh ew‚Äù
---
You ever hear of Asian Americans?
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Too bad you didn‚Äôt show the DS and escape before ending the clip, but yea instant karma
---
God that muscle Myers. I like survivor but people in this sub are making me to play Myers. 
---
And yet none of what you said addresses why balance (survivor vs killer) shouldn't be a thing. It doesn't matter if the survivors are all the same, the survivor side in general should be balanced with the killer side. Survivors consistently getting 4k'd a majority of the time is not interesting gameplay. That would be frustrating and kill the game.
---
love that. they try to loop around and pick it up so they dont lose track of where it is, and then they get hooked
---
You make a damn good point. Didn't think about that . 
---
LMAO I never get tired of seeing these
---
I'll be honest I forgot about Doctor haha. 
---
praying to actually get into a trial this time like
---
I know your struggles, I've played on both. 
---
nice
---
Honestly, those are the kind of players who are attracted to Legion. They play as killer and lose a lot and don't learn from their misplays, and they get Legion so they don't have any stress of having to play a game. Which is so strange because why even play a video game at all at that point if you don't want to play?
---
Do! She is an absolute blast to play. I still like Billy more, personally, I think he's more fun (both to play as and against). But a good Spirit is just.. gross to play against. When you get good with her you almost feel like you are unbeatable.
---
Also one thing, you said survivors are already in disadvantage when one of them dies, but isnt that a core feature of the gameplay!? Before the first surv dies he/she usually has done gens and helped their team.
---
Thanks 
---
I mean you can be both, they aren't mutually exclusive. 
---
You can be a tunneling camper and then let the last guy have the hatch, doesn't really cancel out the first part.
---
Especially when most heals are by one person, which makes botany knowledge generally better. 
---
Way to gloss over the "balance is boring and will kill the game" argument. I also never said 4k all the time, The killer should be able to 4k unless the survivors make smart plays. Just showing up and do bare minimum should NOT let two people out the gates. I'm sorry, that isn't balance, that's spoon fed points.
---
I guess for them it‚Äôs not about improving it‚Äôs about not losing 
---
That new killer offering seems so OP! 
---
Oh, like they weren't fucking hell back then either. Fucking hell, they sucked so bad. 
---
If they Click leave game you get the points, if they close application or turn of there net you don't
---
I think I played against you recently. Maybe 1-2 days ago. I was playing Huntress
---
Never had it help me as survivor. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it I took care of it 
---
how can it be not obvious? pretty sure anyone playing dvd can count to 3. 
---
When a killer was heading straight towards me with a survivor but walked through a pallet spot, I thought ‚ÄúOh man I‚Äôm gonna get camped for dropping this pallet Rn‚Äù
---
Once again later in the match a survivor got downed and again the killer started heading to me but I had winter party starters. ‚Äúoh man, I‚Äôm gonna get mori‚Äôd for sure when I drop these.‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt get mori‚Äôd, but I did get hooked and camped, and I am sure it was a sweet relief for that killer since I was such a turd that game. I don‚Äôt teabag killers tho so maybe that‚Äôs why he had some mercy on me ( he did have Mori )
---
Dear "Whoever thought there was a chance the Deep Wounds Frenzy change was a good idea",
---
Please never suggest a balance change ever again.
---
Sincerely, the DBD community at large trying to have fun.
---
Yes, it's hyperbole, but one look at the PTB notes for anyone with half a brain would tell you that this was a terrible idea. Do you guys even DBD, bro?
---
Ya wanna source that?
---
Big balls69 took her fucking quitar
---
All hits 1 shot survivors (crit) but the downside is that your dad doesn't approve. 
---
Preach.
---
What's the logic to selecting the models in the menu? Or is it randomized?
---
I have problem with mouse input in this game (probably due to low fps on my computer). So I fixed it by binding all of my actions to keyboard buttons and they work consistently (though it does take some getting used to).
---
If it isn't every good then why are 4/5 using using it? Sloppy Butcher is VERY strong right now. They need to add a timer to the mangled effect and it would be fine.
---
You know it's not her older brother right? She was just a baby sitter.
---
yeah, unless he's slugging the guy because he sees the bloodwarden icon off, then he can just go for the gate, force you out, go back for the slug/injured survivor who got saved by others and lock in the game the ones that tried to save the slug, 99%ing gates is slightly annoying but not that devastating 
---
and even if everyone runs out the gate because nobody went for the save then well, it's still a clean kill on the slug without having to camp it with the gates open 
---
I don't have an answer for you, but a question if you don't mind. Do you have any specific ideas on a film?
---
go do a gen
---
Ehhhh, I max out objective points most of the time anyway. Now, if it applied post game then it would be something to strongly consider. 
---
I don‚Äôt let them die on the floor but unless I can straight up afford to eat a DS with no drawbacks then yah I‚Äôll keep slugging the obsession until I have a strong lead and can afford the L. It‚Äôs a really strong way to counter DS without preventing the perk from actually being used. 
---
Actually given how the game handles the lobbies they may not be able to separate SWF and solo players. As far as the match making is concerned these 4 players just all matched 1 killer. 
---
Maybe when the game gets dedicated servers, but I'm not going to pretend plenty of solo players won't message the last guy to tell him about some perks. I've done it and seen it happen. 
---
You gotta pull some unpredictable stupid shit to counter
---
This is nice and all, but does it fix the bug with wraith running sloppy butcher?
---
I like empathy. It lets you kind of know where the killer is a good percentage of the time. Plus, it's good for finding injured teammates for the BP.
---
Yeah, not like 3 matches in a row, but i had this issue very frequently
---
They love it
---
I,I was on rhe PTB..... and then he just wandered off.
---
No but seriously mcclean said something about his rework being on the PTB in his stream the other day. (The king made a vid about it). So I thought it would be in this one, but im very dissapointed.
---
I like your bonus idea for playing against SWF, that is a solution that doesn't just ask to ban it and tries to make it play with the game. I agree it is a choice to use voice or not, but my point towards it is that in game we don't get any indication if it is cheating or not, if I didn't use reddit I honestly would never knew how strongly some people feel against using it. And it's not playing dumb, I play all my multiplayer games with my friends in voice I take it for granted.
---
Only it's only a game, why you have to be mad. 
---
&gt; solo players won't message the last guy
---
Nothing can be done about this besides fucking everyone over with an update like this, I've had people message me where the hatch is or where a hex totem is, etc.
---
Don't really care about this update, it's just another poorly handled one added to the list.
---
single tap and a delay with the gates actually opening.
---
 you really underestimate the difference 3 sec can make in this game, you can't safely run out from the game in chase, unless you mean camping by 99% gate lock, but then you're useless to other survivors anyway and if any of them are injured in chase and try to run out they won't be able to because the delay will kill them, especially if they have to run to the lock themselves to tap it before running out 
---
Most common source is escaping for 5k, deliverance gives 1.5k for self unhook,  DS gives 500 for killer grasp escape so that last 1k could be earned either through multiple self heals or 2 more grasp escapes. Which unless the killer is basement greedy or has broken hooks it's probably not gonna happen. 
---
Still be nice if main menu didn't make my ps4 pro sound like jet engine, Cap the fps already
---
what the flying fuck did they do to this poor game. 
---
And I guess all my comments will get downvoted for trying to have a reasonable discussion :P
---
The difference is interfering with gen progress is done to extend the time limit, not to avdvance your win condition. For Survivors, finishing all 5 generators is actually their win condition. Just as totems are a secondary objective for survivors, the generators are a secondary objective for killers. You can win a game without ever touching a generator as a killer. Not saying that it is unnecessary to incorporate delaying generators as part of a strategy, but it is not part of your primary objective to do that.
---
I am fine calling NOED a reward for killers once the gens are finished, sure. But it isn't rewarding the gens being completed, it is rewarding the survivors failing to complete their secondary objective. NOED is completely negateable before it has even activated, and many groups do. There is a reason it is less common at high ranks, and that is that most killers prefer not to rely on an inconsistent perk that only activates during an endgame state, and may not activate at all if th survivors complete their secondary objective. But it isn't overpowered to have a perk do what NOED does if it has so many drawbacks to it. If it was activated at the start of the match I would agree with you, but the fact it only happens during endgame, after the survivors have had every chance they need to prevent it if they chose to, that says that it is ont he survivors for not taking action ahead of time. If NOED wasn't as powerful as it was, it wouldn't establish the totems as a valid secondary objective the way it needs to in order to be worthwhile.
---
that hex is other way around, it covers the sound not the skillcheck pop up. it sounds like a major bug
---
or maybe he's playing against the doc and skillcheck just pops up in a different place on the screen
---
Self care is not op
---
let them die 
---
It says they need to be ‚Äúworking on a generator‚Äù within 8 meters. 
---
Oh pish posh , its just practice my dear child . Thank you tho 
---
Oh, I'm sorry! I misread that. Yeah, that's definitely a pretty bad bug, then.
---
You win a one week stay at Mount Ormond Resort
---
More like everyone gangsta til spirit fury pops
---
&gt;I play all my multiplayer games with my friends in voice I take it for granted.
---
That's the point I was making. It's a staple in so many other games people just assume it's meant to be used. Then with a lot of folks when you explain it's not intended they just shrug it off as NBD or think the game should be changed to accommodate it, rather than their own play style.
---
came out a little noisy in low lit areas  :(
---
if the game starts and u chase the obsession first trough pallet down and they stab u in the back, that's three fucking gens done. DS is fucking busted 
---
The lobby's designed to give the killer that slight edge, to know what they're going to go against. The survivors are supposed to be the ones going in blind.
---
Four survivors coordinating via voice comm is still a greater advantage than the killer being able to hear it. That alone wouldn't be enough to mitigate it, but it's better than nothing. 
---
Stop whining dude.
---
And worse, stop with those statements that have no fucking sens.
---
Really trying to push that wake up on us through the shrine recently
---
Was the gen speed boost completely gone? I thought it was Leader bonus stay at 3/6/9 % while everything else is buffed.
---
Fair enough. 
---
A good idea would be to make a non-hex reverse lullaby, I mean, at first no sound before qte, and for each repaired generator, the sound progressively goes back to normal. This way, it's not op, and even doctor don't make the game impossible to win. It could go well with ruin but tapping gen would still work and when there is only a few gen to repair, it wouldn't be a pain in the *ss.
---
Yup.
---
It Will clearly push the game in a meta where nobody go for the altruism and everyone just salfe care and rush even more gens.
---
Or they pallet stun you spirit fury activates and you slap them before they can flashlight your eyes 
---
haha, alright then. without Doctor this perk doesn't sound so bad without being a hex tbh. but Doctor changes everything.
---
Oh, yes, let's have a new player sit in a lobby with his thumb up his ass waiting to learn about killer perks. If you're the first one dead, games can last up to and beyond 10 minutes after you died. Spectating randoms for 10 minutes isn't fun, nor should it be expected of new players
---
I mean, it is one of the most used perks. But I don't think it needs to be changed either, the old numbers are fine for the most part.
---
generally you want to capitalize on the survivor you're chasing to gain momentum, make another one come for him to the hook while you go for the 2 others
---
if you chase someone for a long time and don't get him it's really hard to come back, my general tip is to cut your loses early if you see them going to a jungle gym or infinites (after first loop and it takes some time to know when it's better to give up, sometimes you just have to chase him to get a hook and some breathing space), switch if you see any other survivor during the chase (once again, not always, its just a good place to switch when you start losing hope) and generally - and I'd say this is the most important one - don't chase people who quite obviously want to be chased. They won't go on gens anyway and they probably are better at looping that their teammates that they try to buy time for. I know its hard to ignore a flashlight clicker when you're just boiling to slam him on the hook, but you actually annoy him back with prioritizing his friends over him in chase 
---
Same as ranked but without rank and mmr
---
Yes, but the thing is that that normally doesn't work, it works with the ptb changes
---
Thank you very much , and the selling/making of prints is something id very much would like to do but needs some time to organize. For now all i can offer is the individual drawing  and choice of background/ line color for like a wallpaper or something . Hope you understand ;)
---
The difference is that survivors telling teammates what perks a killer had was an exploit, the killer seeing what items survivors are bringing is a feature.
---
It really do be like that.
---
Whatever you say, Mr. Bad Killer.
---
Dw, I'm also salty when I hear more than two consecutive *whooosh* in a trial haha 
---
Ah k
---
please explain.
---
Look great
---
It's gone, unless it's just not stated by the text, patched my game into the PTB just to double check.
---
This would still allow you to add other Survivors via Steam/PSN/XBL and notify them that way. Yes, it'd be much bigger of a hassle to do so but if for some reason you're so salty for dying to the Killer it would be possible.
---
All you have to do is count how much time it takes to juggle. 10-15 seconds is accurate most of the time. You could try to prove my argument wrong, or you can just keep calling me names. Your choice
---
Not as great as you ;)
---
Yeah, that's because a lot of bad players use it as a crutch to rank up against bad killers that take longer to catch people then get stomped by good killers.
---
New sitting lobby animations whenever you‚Äôre gonna pick what to play ‚Äúduh‚Äù
---
Trash
---
cool
---
If I‚Äôm left with one survivor, and he hasn‚Äôt used DS or done teabagging/stunning/pointing, I‚Äôll take them to the hatch if I know where it is 
---
thanks and sorry I didn't get it, God I hate Quentin so much
---
Rip hate to here that you hate him.
---
Burn.
---
Even if a gen hits zero it shows the sparks of regression. So yes, it would stay white until it turns yellow to tell you a survivor fiddled with it.
---
H1Z1 has a set of cosmetics that you unlock piece by piece for each Prestige level you get (Prestige being levelling up past 100 and back to 1, just like DBD). That could be done for this game as well with special outfits for the 7 original characters (4 survivors and 3 killers leaves plenty of time to develop new cosmetics for the moment someone goes beyond Devotion 21) !
---
Take my money BHVR. Defenetly best cosmetic in the game
---
I didn't mind it, there was so many bloodpoints to go around! I was regularly clearing 50k as survivor!
---
Its an advantage in that someone who SHOULD now be totally worthless can reveal major aspects of the killer's gameplan, or addons that haven't come into play or may not be obvious.
---
  Revealing the killer is using NOED Warden means you would know that if the killer has someone they are about to hook, you better make sure you leave the exit gate at 99% until post-hook.
---
Perhaps you would find out the Wraith is using All Seeing Blood, and know that trying to stealth is utterly pointless and will just give him free hits.   Perhaps you find out that the Myers has infini T3 Tombstone setup, and he had already maxed evil off of the first guy he killed and the hook finished the job.   Or you could find out if it was an ebony or just a green mori the killer used to Mori someone somewhat early in the game.  Perhaps the killer's Enduring Fury combo hasn't come into play yet due to map setup preventing the one guy from getting to really use pallets, or just a lack of pallet stuns.
---
Doing gens, you ?
---
It was possible on other platforms if you had an out of game way to communicate (So built in voice chats or messaging system in other games) but less prevalent.
---
Get ready for bad time. Playing this killer teaches you nothing that helps on other killer so it will be harder.
---
Or hitting them as they‚Äôre running out so the item is lost 
---
Oh look it's James from Dead Meat!
---
You know it!
---
I don't want you to try to convince me that i'm wrong, because you won't. I want you to actually argue against my points because i am genuinely curious of what aspect i was wrong in. Also, that logic of "if you complain about ds you're a bad killer" is pretty fucking dumb. 80% of this sub has a problem with DS (You can tell from the tons of daily posts about what's wrong with it) so either DS actually has a problem, or 80% of this sub is just trash killers whilst you're an ascended god because you don't have a problem with DS. I'm thinking DS has a problem.
---
I'd rather have enduring and spirit fury. It's a good perk, but I think it gets edged out by other perks if you know how to apply map pressure properly.
---
Boi! How did this happen!?
---
Yes I watch the Dead Meat Kill Count!
---
Wait until you get more game awareness and start catching people kiting you and stealthing away from you at ranges and in situations where it shouldn't be possible.
---
For example, a couple weeks ago I knew there was a survivor on a gen in killer shack, but I attacked the survivor next to me first then did a 180 to face the shack and started to sprint there. The shack was over 100m away and there was no LOS to me. In a normal game the survivor would have no idea I was coming. In this game, a Claudette fast vaulted through the window and started running away, getting a 100m head start because her teammates told her I just started running towards shack.
---
That's probably the worst example I've seen, but the same type of behavior makes some of the most advantageous killer situations kind of moot, like 3 gen. If they're communicating optimally they would get like an extra 20m head start compared to a solo queue survivor wherever the killer goes, which is enough time to make a chase long enough for one of those gens to get done if you chase him.
---
If you actually catch him, there's a higher chance his team 99d the gen for adrenaline or was able to coordinate a flashlight save or body block because, again, they're on comms and know each others' builds. 
---
If you opt to not even chase him because his head start was too good and you go to check another gen, survivors can just cycle and do the same again indefinitely with no penalty.
---
And this is if they *screwed up* and let you have 3 gen lol. You're fucked if they properly divide the gens on the map and aren't nurse/billy with eagle vision, because even with blink or saw they will use their early warning to hide from you. 
---
I love when people say no offense before their statement.  It makes everything after okay LOL
---
It should be reworked. Its fun as a survivor trying to find it if you are the last, but as a killer... 
---
Boring and useless mechanic
---
So true. It should be 1 vs 1. Only fair.
---
What about Tapp
---
&gt; I don't want you to try to convince me that i'm wrong, because you won't. 
---
I just said I wouldn't, 4head.
---
&gt;I want you to actually argue against my points because i am genuinely curious of what aspect i was wrong in.
---
No you weren't', you said point blank nothing I say can convince you.
---
Stop instantly contradicting yourself.
---
&gt;80% of this sub has a problem with DS
---
Well the majority of people are bad at the game, just like with every game. The largest base are the people who are bad and the pool gets smaller as you go up in skill. This isn't new, it's been known since forever.
---
&gt;so either DS actually has a problem, or 80% of this sub is just trash killers
---
They are, the majority of killers are bad, just like the majority of survivors are bad.
---
&gt;whilst you're an ascended god because you don't have a problem with DS
---
I'm not a god, I'm just better than average, which means I'm better than you and the majority of the sub.
---
Same :) it makes him just that little bit more disturbing
---
I really love how it‚Äôs very sketchy, it‚Äôs almost quite sinister!
---
It‚Äôs amazing to think that there are people who spend so much time in this game being toxic, and making it their identity to be toxic.
---
Getting enjoyment at the thought of pissing people off, even when they don‚Äôt actually know if it is working.
---
Then becoming exactly the thing they think they‚Äôre making fun of: a pissy little kid
---
It was supposed to be set up so if you find it as killer then you could close the hatch but the dev's didn't put it in.
---
But it helps killers running NOED or Blood Warden cause survivors can't then work with those perks in mind.
---
you're really shooting down my urban evasion claudette bro üò¢üò¢
---
Now that seems like an alright mechanic. First to find it at that point and then the game continues. At least it gives the killer a goal in finding it.
---
&gt;shut up and deal with bubba abuse
---
What?  How is Bubba the first killer that you go to?  Billy and Nurse I understand, but Bubba?
---
There‚Äôs an even more difficult mode I‚Äôve encountered on PS4, no HUD. Can‚Äôt see perks, or status of teammates, and you can‚Äôt see Skillchecks so working on gens is almost impossible aside from gen tapping 
---
It would have but the dev's didn't put it in cause they stated it gives killers an advantage.
---
Claudette using her Stand's ability to create a gen to work on
---
your post was pleasant to read. you explained your concerns and gave valid argument of game forcing both sides to waste time. 
---
it's not the first post, of course. but maybe, just maybe Devs will figure out something if we won't stop complaining.
---
also, little story.
---
I suck at Nurse. I'm a rank 1 Freddy main, I play decent with all killers but Nurse(and Huntress but it's a shit aim thing). Nurse is the only killer though that I have no Adept with. fatigue gives me anxiety and I just... I can't D: 
---
this one game I used a pink mori(3d and last time in my 1.8k hours of gameplay) to just get the damn achievement. I got 3 people dead and knew where the hatch is. and I've lost a standoff after 15 minutes of staring game where Claudette wouldn't even try to move or do anything. was just standing on a hatch. injured too. that was by far the most frustrating experience i had in this game. wish there was any way to actually do something about it. especially with the fact I main Freddy so 9/10 hatch games pretty much lost. 
---
But if you can already heal yourself without a medkit then what's the drawback lol?
---
So Leader doesn't speed up gens anymore? That was the reason I liked it so much, darn.
---
Thank you very much 
---
The fuck it isn't! This is the stupidest comment I've ever read. You basically just said "The seller of this incomplete/broken item is under no obligation to complete/fix it after seeing it to someone for money."
---
Antipating... Myers tombstone...
---
Yep, just got a pro recently. The difference is day and night. I could never go back now, tge regular ps4
---
Excellent bait for Nurse x Wraith shippers!   
---
**Has rusty fish hook protruding from his mouth**
---
The puzzle game is pretty new, like released last year not talking about the retro one.
---
I hope that change won't go through. Promotes only looking out for youself and discourages healing others.
---
I'm okay with this as a killer. I feel bad when I get them through a window when they have more than cleared it.
---
Nope, that's wrong. You will always completely deplete your Frenzy bar when using a regular M1.
---
&gt;Slow down the rate that Feral Frenzy burns after hitting a survivor with it?
---
This is correct. It slows the rate at which Feral Frenzy is consumed after you apply Deep Wounds to someone (and thus get your bar refilled).
---
I was so hype when I heard Ace was getting another skin, then I saw it and I just :(
---
Ah okay. But they weren't exactly doubled tho. Base healing was increased from 12 to 16 seconds thus increasing self care time from 24 to 32 seconds. And the proposed change to self care would lower the self care time from 32 seconds back down to 21.3 seconds which is faster than the old self care was. I know I'm repeating my post here and it wasn't you to say that but yeah, healing wasn't doubled.. At least not from my understanding. 
---
Shame odd bulbs are so shite
---
Nope :).
---
Matheiu has stated that BHVR plans to support DBD for another 5 years. 
---
That doesn't necessarily mean that we'll get 20 more chapters, but we will get another year or two's worth.
---
I could imagine this being even worse for a Freddy main, I assume they have to be in the nightmare to be grabbed yeah?
---
But yeah the frustration is just unreal on those games ! I stood on a hatch for a solid 20 minutes, and finally just started playing Smash on my Switch until the survivor got bold and thought I wasn't paying attention anymore. Your story resonates with me lol, just an all around frustrating mechanic. Especially since survivors can even abuse it while injured like that !
---
I'd rather not have posts get spoiler warnings if they contained the letters P T or B
---
Adrenaline, Balance landing, Self Care, are usually the top tier core for survivors. I dont change them either from my build
---
Thats what i was thinking. It was the obsession, does she have DS left?
---
Now I can play Soul At Stake without playing Soul At Stake, thank you devs &lt;3
---
Michael and Laurie are related in the original two films, which is the version of the characters in DBD.
---
wait what
---
Does spine chill increase all speeds including vaulting time? The wiki says so but I've heard from others/the description leads me to believe otherwise. Also does Enduring affect Decisive Strike?
---
Maybe the face that his insta down is undodgable and can down a whole party of survivors? Oh and the fact that everyone who plays him is a hook camping asshole?
---
Shout out to the OG barn, with all the windows open.   
---
Unless you were trapper or nurse, that shit was hell.
---
I‚Äôve been destroyed by 2 red rank nurses on PS4 in the last couple weeks. They‚Äôre coming back!
---
been a mod for about 10 months now lol
---
Only works with both at once
---
There's been a history of mass spoiler warnings on this subredit even if your post has nothing to do with the current PTB build.
---
Just something i poked fun at
---
A face that only shows up *when* the killer insta-downs someone?  Kind of shown their hand regardless at that point.
---
I spot a rank 10 scrub
---
yeah, they need to be sleeping. which is weird cause you can pull them out of lockers but can't do the same with the hatch even during transition. very frustrating.
---
i mean i get it hatch camping as Freddy would be op if he could grab while someone is not sleeping but uhm... without it survivors have the all the cards.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs sad, Fire uo actually can be good only combined with other perks that speed up stuff such as brutal strength or bamboozle. Which is sad that you need other perks just to make that perk decent 
---
Yep, if a surv is bad, not even DS can save him.  
---
But if a surv is good and is running DS, you should probably not even touch him till the end of the game for the amout of time you'll waste
---
Well leader is not suppose to affect repair so don't consider it when asking for change. If any the healing speed is what should no go through.
---
I am torn here. Right now Selfcare Heros do nothing but selfcare everytime they get hit anyway (specially annoying into legion, because if u got 2 of them on your team who is gonn do gens), so I am happy it will be faster for them. I am not happy that I need to yikes it out when I am healed by them. I guess running a good Medkit will be my future ones more. 
---
Hmm..I definitely see it as an advantage for Killer..but immunity is also an advantage for survivor that turns the game into an unfun never ending memefest. I do see a need in this game to reward solo players, but I have also seen solo players carry their teammates through other actions such as bodying, looping, etc. Mechanics in the game that are skill based. Regardless, closing the hatch would add even more interesting gameplay to the game. Maybe the last survivor should be able to open it back up with skill checks like a gen?
---
Yeah I guess so. Would made though cause of keys.
---
PTB posts should be marked Spoiler if there is new content involved.   
---
FTFY 
---
Of course the ds user makes it out.
---
hot damn man could you please allow me to have the freddy one as an iphone x sized wallpaper?? these are sick af
---
Even then calling it decent is a stretch. Yes it basicslly reaches its full potential after 2 gens because a 4%increase after 4 gens is ass.
---
I would love to see all of them done and honestly you should make copies and sell them. I'd sure as hell buy one just bc of the aesthetic alone 
---
Gen rushing means doing the objective effectively without messing around. Come on it's not that difficult to understand.
---
Why can't the game look like that?
---
Then maybe you should keep talking about it until a change does happen, because people sure as shit aren't gonna stop. 
---
As a chronic insomniac, i approve.
---
David and Jake look like they are sharing skeletal animation. Their move are almost identical except the seat shifting and hand warming part. 
---
One 100% , just private message me and ill send when i upload the full thing :)üëçüèΩ
---
There's just no reason for a survivor to have that sort of advantage in my opinion. The advantage in the first place was your 3 other ~~distractions~~ teammates, right?
---
No no no no, the Leader effect doesn't work on repairing anymore. It's "just" 25% faster on sabotage, heal, opening exit gate, etc.
---
Really? I've seen spoiler stuff for mori's but not much else
---
you‚Äôre a champ! my guess is that freddy is in yellow?
---
Bad devs ruin games. They shouldn't be in charge of their own balancing issues.
---
They love them and if it's good they may even put it on there stream.
---
Imagine legion walking up to david and he's like: "Kids like you should be burning in hell".
---
I have plans of making / selling copies in the future üëçüèΩ 
---
you‚Äôre a champ! my guess is that freddy is in yellow??
---
Probably just suiciding since they dont want to play against legion.
---
Sound is a mess right now. Supposedly being fixed in the mid chapter, but it's unreliable currently.
---
Yes! Thank you!!

Nurse/Hag

Hes in a reddish brown BUT i do personalized colors if you DM the request üëçüèΩ
---
Nay , thank YOU for enjoying the art :)
---
Next time a dlc gets teased you should realise what im on about, hopefully it gets better but the mods went over board with the latest dlc.
---
I think keys to survivors is like moris for killers. Yeah it's OP but...not breaking the game OP. Both still have objectives (get X number of gens/hook a survivor).
---
New patch on the PTB supposedly fixes the audio mix. Not on PC so I can't say if it does, but it's in the patch notes.
---
You hurt that man
---
Yeah it makes sense. I enjoy moris cause outside of design and ability, it sets the killers apart from one another and gives them unique kills.
---
Right, and the idea I was laying out was that they absolutely do exist. I've played with then, I've talked with them here.
---
Just because your experience is different doesn't name either of us "right". I didn't really find the joke funny, but to deny that those types of players have a home here is odd.
---
Nice decisive strike btw
---
Read it, it does on ptb. Obviously not supposed to but still that healing seems broken as well 
---
I'm nearly always alt-tabbed out until the match loads up.
---
As many surprises as I can get. 
---
Improvements to totem spawns that say... Well, I can only hope they mean it.
---
Also that momentum in vault just makes sense. Likewise, I have no idea what difference .1 seconds is gonna make, but if I can't catch people in their vault animation consistently I'ma hafta ask for that .1 second back please. :p (for real though, it just seems like such a small, insignificant change... Maybe it's  to match the animation better with the new momentum thing they got going?)
---
There can only be one. 
---
You guys are sick!
---
Tell me more. 
---
Leader affects normally as 3/6/9 if I recall. Not sure if it‚Äôs a bug orrrrr, on PTB btw. 
---
Wheat a thrilling match
---
Mirror at teir 1 on the game
---
Have you ever played killer against a squad of Ochido fanboys? It‚Äôs basically the most anti-fun thing in the world. I don‚Äôt blame killers for dodging SWFs, even if it‚Äôs annoying when I‚Äôm trying to find matches, because so many SWF squads on PS4 have been such bad sports that they‚Äôve ruined it for everyone else. Nobody wants to play against BMing assholes that bombard you with messages insulting you afterwards. 
---
Well, I'm definitely going to do that again :) I'm not a fan of the faster self care either... When I saw that yesterday I was pretty... "shocked" ?!
---
wah wah, cri cri
---
Might not have had the iridescent head.
---
Wow, you can just not go a second withot insulting other people and praising yourself. Starting to sound a bit egotistical there, buddy
---
I saw recently a Tru3ta1ent video where a survivor does something like that, i'm not sure if it is that macro or not, but looks like it.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyfQeNhW148](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyfQeNhW148) i don't remember in what exact second this happen.
---
You are right, I misread the post.
---
Actually they say they fixed something about totems in the PTB, maybe this will fix the problem.
---
Anyway I tried the Suffocation Pit totem placement and with over 10 trials in KYF the Hex totem always spawned near the Mine, so the info you provided is accurate.
---
Casual mode hahahaha derank to 15 mate 
---
If I recall they‚Äôre not reworking the hatch because it might not fit into their new end game they have planned. They mentioned this in a dev stream around November. 
---
These are amazing! Clown looking fantastic there.  Can't wait for the Fredster. 
---
Well, I'm surprised you got Rank 1 with the Legion.
---
She betrayed my man Doc 
---
Who knew that even psychopathic mass murders could have affairs like that.
---
Wait, what? The thing I complained about last week is getting fixed? I'm big hard right now. Screw all y'all who disagreed with me, lol
---
Maybe Freddy won't be able to hit me 20 meters away from the window now
---
I don‚Äôt really care what they do with the endgame as long as it results in a quick ending. The 1v1 situations are very boring for both sides, especially killer
---
Ah. Interesting. Thank you !
---
Actually do you have the images for the other maps?
---
The source link in the post is broken.
---
Who cares. It's only an issue for high rank swf tbh
---
I also have watched Twitch SWFs tell their remaining teammates what perks the killer has. Essentially ruins your end game potential if it's announced you have Blood Warden or NOED. All d the team will go straight out instead of hanging around like they usually do. 
---
Thanks , full thing should be uploaded later today
---
And personally for me I believe the hatch is a pride stand off. As a killer it‚Äôs like, how badly do you want this 4K? I get if you‚Äôre doing an adept. But also as a survivor, how bad do you want that extra points to escape?
---
In all honesty, if you‚Äôre at a point where you have a survivor‚Äôs only option is the hatch, you‚Äôve already done a great job. 2 kills is the average. I tend to just let the last one go, or as a survivor just jump in and fuck all. I can‚Äôt be assed to wait. But I know it does matter to some people! To each their own of course. 
---
Ya cause its every survs dream to play with totem scavenger hunt perks, the most boring perks in the game. 
---
Sorry but how ?
---
If you heal someone as dying light obsession you see that you are affected by the perk, so he was not 100% told by dead teammates 
---
This is so awesome! The only thing that looks kinda off is Michael's knife it's huge! But other than that you did a great job
---
Always love me a good cross hatching.
---
When you run NOED and blood warden for 100 games but can only use them once
---
How do you escape? By doing generators to power exit gates. 
---
Do totems have to be cleansed to escape? No, you cleanse them to remove a perk that might not even be there.
---
Is NOED too powerful for its own good because it has a presence, even if the perk isn‚Äôt being used? Yes, no perk can do what NOED does where you have to change your entire playstyle just because it might be there.
---
Wow the killer brought a mori, so that means they‚Äôre kill rushing! 
---
Thought it was because of the large Asia regional players that got access to play DBD some months ago.
---
Thanks , and its actually not off üòÇ [[ reference used  here ]](https://www.google.com/amp/s/1428elm.com/2017/06/27/halloween-see-video-game-history-michael-myers-video/amp/)

Ohh oopsüòÖ
---
You heal yourself at 75% instead of 50% speed, but all your other healing is 25% slower.
---
Holy hell, those reflexes. 
---
I would've been so tense waiting for the DS (even though I don't run it), that I would've blown it.

What's your opinion on tapping? Personally, I only do it when I start going full on potato, (because‚Äîand I'm not too proud to admit‚Äîit happens), or the connection is really bad.

Its all good , youre not the first 
---
I used to think it was an unstoppable perk when I first started out because I didn't understand the perk.
---
I didn't know who had NOED or why I would randomly get downed or why I wouldn't get 1 hit anymore after an explosion happened.
---
I didn't learn really what it was until about a hundred hours into playing survivor, and every time I went to the subreddit I would see "yeah, I hate that perk too" but I would never see why people hated it or what it was.
---
I hated it, they hated it, there was no reason to really ask questions, you know? Go with the hive mind, and all that.
---
Then I learned what the little skull thing on the right was. What a totem was, and what hex perks were, and finally what NOED really did and didn't do.
---
How when you're the killer you can use it when the match is over or not at all if the survivors destroy it.
---
Then I learned what looping really was and how to properly do it, or to destroy the hex totem before getting hit.
---
I think that the bulk of people who complain about NOED are just those who haven't learned how to deal with it or even learned about it.
---
(/s)
---
if that happens then i'll lose a friend
---
It was even confirmed on lore stream that there is something going on between those two so yeh. It is
---
Legion double pip every single game even without trying. 
---
The controller isn‚Äôt on
---
You want happy endings with those 2 nurses, huh? Naughty boy. 
---
Legion is in balancement hell, they cant just buff him now without fine tuning every single little change without breaking the game.
---
Obviously this is BHVR fault for crrating such a killer, but thats how it is. Legion needs a complete rework. 
---
Hmph, blood warden. Is that a type of sneeze? Sounds like it wouldnt last long.
---
There‚Äôs nothing that can be done about it really, the devs themselves have said it‚Äôs fair game. 
---
I'm pretty sure this happens with Claudette and her exclusives so Im not sure why they can't do this with Feng
---
As a doc main glad to know I'm not the only one having this issue. 
---
To be fair doctor's "Grab-Happiness" in treatment mode is kinda crutch-y but if it still works for hatch interrupts, vaults, even locker interactions, hook grabs/interrupts shouldn't be exempted. 
---
Either fix it or remove it completely. 
---
I use it but as I said it feels pretty cheese-y. 
---
lol was obviously irony
---
Makes me wanna learn nurse, she looks incredible. 
---
There's no technical obstacle that would prevent the killer's lobby reading a flag indicating an SWF party, the only question is whether or not it is implemented.
---
Basically in treatment mode, you can still do grabs/interrupts like hatch grabs, possibly gen yanks, DEFINITELY vault-grabs, locker grabs, and until recently unhook grabs.
---
Since you don't swing your weapon, you can mash M1 and get the grab every time. In a recent patch it still works for seemingly most actions but not unhooks anymore which is a bit of a shame. 
---
Cannot unsee.
---
Nah, even against really good survivors. If you just keep using your power hit people. Not even downing. Just go around, hit gens hit people. You will pip. 0k? Pip.
---
Legion's Power design is the ultimate piper. Get chaser points, malicious and the gen breaker one. All easy to do. Press m2, get free hits. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adys7r/the_new_campfire_idle_animations_are_awesome/?st=jqoexyay&amp;sh=89ec4b73
---
And how often happened that in all your games?
---
Vigil should let you get your exhaustion back while in chase at normal speed, what would be a good buff for it 
---
People keep banging on about this but no one has provided a video of it so i'm finding it hard to believe.
---
LMAO
---
DS is considered as much as a meta perk as NOED is.
---
Would normally not even think about it, but 4 man swf with insta heal and 4DS... pretty annoying
---
Also, 2 perks on lvl 1 and using mediocre add-ons to make game not as hard against nurse.
---
What changed?
---
Console player? Nurse is very poor on console right now, but if you are on pc then you just need more practice.
---
Fuckin hate p3 claudette CHANGE HER FFS
---
Again, I didn't say that. So you both can't read AND you're dishonest? Nice.

---
When u get the D
---
Hmm. I‚Äôve seen survivors far away but have had to get closer to stalk them. There is a range but it‚Äôs really big.
---
Why not? If you play the game a lot it doesn't take too much time to get 2,000 shards. If you only play one side that's only two perks a week. I've gotten all of Dwight's perks from the Shrine so now I don't ever need to waste bloodpoints on a character I have no interest in playing.
---
Meg's perks are great so generally you would want to just level her, but if you're only interested in Sprint Burst at the moment there's nothing wrong with buying it from the shrine.
---
Not for this one because it's just a balance patch.
---
Definitely either springwood or haddonfield, for both killer and survivor.
---
She needs buffs/changing anyways.
---
Her TR should've been cut to 24m.
---
Legion didn't get a nerf, he got a phat buff for no reason.
---
Really? Unless it was changed it feels like it stops sparking once it hits zero.
---
ACKCHYUALLY THERE WERE OTHER CHANGES LIKE ANIMATIONS
---
I encountered an iron maiden billy the other day and I actually screamed
---
Kate, Borrowed time and Empathy, oh, and Im always with my fellow flashlight too ;)
---
In the banner I thought this was David and was happy he'd be finally getting pants to go with the Lunar Jacket. Can't say i'm disappointed with it being Ace though.
---
I‚Äôve been running Claudette with balanced landing bond iron will and quick and quiet. It‚Äôs great against most killers but spirit and nurse it‚Äôs especially effective. 
---
You made her do it! With active Ruin she would never camp! /s
---
While general co-op Gen speed is getting a nerf.
---
&gt; no idea what they were doing on red ranks
---
Ruin + NOED + camping = everyone can be at red ranks.
---
&gt; I guess to get to rank 1, some people have to camp.
---
It's easier to pip by playing normally, then by camping tho. Camping will only result in a pip if the survivors go for the save or the guy on the hook kills himself. If survivors do gens, and guy on the hook stays put, the killer de-pips. 
---
Meanwhile, if you play normally, slap some people, kick a few gens. Get a few hooks (don't even need to sacrifice anyone) and you have most likely pipped. 
---
I recently prestiged nurse, that's why I run ruin. Normally if I had all the perks I wanted i don't run ruin with nurse, but given I don't have them I can't compensate for not using it.  
---
Add-ons and offerings plenty of thanks to the event. I have ebony moris and plenty of omega blink, 3/4 blink nurse add-ons.
---
I don't usually play nurse, because of all the hate people have when playing against her, so when I do I try to avoid making game what I would consider unreasonably unfair, if I did, people would hate even more and probably DC.
---
In this game they got the 5 gens and last one was caught with door already open, chased the last one out the door too.
---
There was no hate in chat after the game, so playing against a 4man swf with nurse and having everyone feeling that it was a good game speaks volumes i think
---
Except. It used to buff vaulting anyway. Resilience had that quirk and didn't have the vaulting marked until an update.
---
lol true. then it doesn't matter I destroyed the ruin. they'd still camp and be sweaty.
---
Does the noise bubble notifications from fast vaults, pallet drops, fast locker entering, etc. (but not failed skillchecks) have a maximum range? Can the killer detect you quick-vaulting from the other side of the map?
---
WE HAVE REACHED THE PEAK FOLKS! BHVR RECOGNISE THAT WE SHIP WRAITH AND NURSE! WE WON REDDIT! WE WON!
---
I'm not very smart okay
---
I get the idea but it would just work for a time + if the killer uses a perk that didn't show up they knew it was wrong. either way it would be the same.
---
Thats actually really sad to think the killer had to resort to lag switching just to get kills. 
---
I dont see why it cant be strong. If it was a passive ability fine make it weak but its still a perk. 
---
\&gt; oversmarted
---
wot
---
Vicious Victorian outfit pair?
---
Also you know a "Doctor" and a "Nurse"... don't know about you, but that sounds pretty aligned to me.
---
&gt;I don't really like the idea of buffing Leader. If there's one thing in DBD that defeats almost all killers, it's gen rushing, and now that Leader is getting this buff, I just feel as if Leader is gonna become one of the most annoyances for killers.
---
Well, the extra boost doesn't apply to generator repair. So the only way Leader would boist gen rushing is that it is now a more viable pick and more people might pick it. Prove thyself it the real genrush tool I think
---
You think wrong 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs said they wanted to make Wraith x Nurse a thing so here it is. Also that‚Äôs for Valentine‚Äôs Day 
---
She‚Äôs worried about a creepy lad in a mask 
---
Why its so bright?
---
This is not true. All perks that used the Action Speed modifier did affect window vault speeds, simply because it was treated as an action. The only tool tip they ever changed to account for this fact however was Resilience, yet Spine Chill, Leader and Prove Thyself all also affected vault speeds. They did not specifically go and made it so Spine Chill's Action Speed modifier works differently from all the others. The difference in vault speed with and without Spine Chill was fairly noticable, as well.
---
In the PTB, it appears they simply re-defined which actions are actually affected by the modifier, and now none of the perks affect vaults, since the modifier doesn't.
---
This is a longdue buff for NOED jk.
---
i think this is a good idea, they should add a history so people that are intereted in the build can start a new game and look for the last game later
---
During the game awards Mcote said they plan to keep this game going for *at least* the next 5 years, so hopefully they're not giving up anytime soon
---
Oh good, it‚Äôs only been what, sixteen months now?
---
This is a dirty trick I do with some friends. In the lobby have everyone equip flashlights then 5 seconds before match starts unequip the flashlights. Usually killer will bring lightborn and franklins so this will waste two of his perks. Half of the time killer will dc on loading screen if you do this. 
---
Depends. I've snuck up behind Killers and just stayed crouched directly behind them while they stood on and body blocked the hatch. When they're unaware you're there and suddenly lose collision jumping in is easy, no need to wait for a hit. Literally did this to a Myers during the Hallowed Blight when he used stalk to try and spot me coming.
---
Well, if the other 3 survivors didn't punish the camper doing at least 3 generators then they are the one to be blamed, not the killer.
---
There is too much salt on this game, sure it's funny and entertaining but it's a 4v1, it's meant to be unfair.
---
Elite mindgames. Can't hide now.
---
I use fast waving as killer is walking your way, and long waves as in it's safe to save me
---
I'm mad because of your BBQ stack
---
&gt; I do think the devs should implement a voice com in game that only extends to a certain range. And if the killer is near they should be able to hear you. Imo it would make the experience more exciting.
---
It also wouldn't stop SWF from using Discord or Team-speak.
---
This has literally never been the case. Remember the 2 flashlight nerfs, exhaustion nerf, healing nerf and pallet nerf, just to name a few? Killers will ALWAYS complain about how OP survivors are as long as they don't get a 4k, and I'm not saying it's you, but there's always a vocal minority that has caused a LOT of survivor nerfs in the last 2 years.
---
Darn
---
Well, you can actually do both... 
---
Saying no offence then proceeding to explain why your opinion / statement won't work is fine.
---
Saying no offence then proceeding to call the other persona whores child is not.
---
See how the two are different.
---
Was watching Tru3 play against legion with franks mixtape and he was saying it was a free down. Can someone explain?
---
I find games fast when queuing by myself, with my friend it takes ages.
---
Try hard hahah de Rank to no friends mate üòÇüòÇ
---
I recall the Myers house was a quasi-infinite for a while now. The thing is with the PTB that people will burn through all their "best" offerings because it's not actually lost. When I went to try out the Prove Thyself and vault changes the same thing happened on survivor with every killer burning through their strongest add-ons. 
---
A. The majority of SWF would turn it off/mute it and continue to use Discord
---
And 
---
B. How would it buff Solo at all? If it were a limited range it would give them no more information than their ears or eyes could give them already.
---
Where do you get survivors using ‚Äúinsta‚Äù heals?
---
Had a Nea do this in a Freddy game the other day. She dropped a pallet, teabagged, I faked going around, moon walked back, and smacked her down as she slow vaulted at me. She'd DCed before I was done clicking my knives.
---
Yes! Thanks so much! 
---
Shit. Why isn't it a word üòÇ
---
If a survivor dies or disconeccts back to the lobby they can't see what perks the killer has until the games over. It's going to stop SWF groups from knowing everything about the killer if and when one of them die.
---
For some reason the intro is uncapped
---
Botany + selfcare = 100% healing speed: they stack multiplicatively, so 100% * 0.75 * 1.33 = 100%
---
So thats what it is.
---
I had a yellow bar when I was doing the gens and someone was near me with leader. I wasnt sure why.
---
Also it works on opening exit gates? Really? But dying light doesnt, and this perk just conpletely outshined Wake Up.
---
The devs never think these buffs through then wonder why they end up with useless perks.
---
Basically
---
No. Like what ever killer u want
---
Yes. U might have to try hard and run strong perks but rank 1 isnt full of godlike P3 Claudettes with decisive like people make it out to be.
---
I adore it. One of my favorite ways to depip. 
---
Or just give killers a bloodpoint bonus and not punish people who want to have fun and play with their friends?
---
How is it meant to be unfair?
---
How does that benefit any? When you‚Äôd have to search for other players in online games already. Which that defeats the point of trying to do a KYF. Either that or search on discord or somewhere else? 
---
Claudette comes and starts helping on gen.
---
Claudette blows up gen.
---
i mean bodyblocking apart from waiting out bt timer is bannable.. so just report them and watch they got banned
---
yah it was pretty hype 
---
I reckon the survivor should have the advantage, because the difference is the killer would get a 4k if they win the hatch standoff, but the survivor would barely pip if they win. Getting a 4k should be rare, just like double pipping as survivor is rare.
---
What is "viable" for you? 4k in 70%+ games? No, he's not. Getting to rank 1 and staying there with some games at rank 2? Yes, he is.
---
lmaoo i dont land it all the time but i've definitely gotten better at it 
---
If survivors pick that map you can be sure they know this too and have BL equipped.
---
got no problem with people who want to "play with their friends", my intention isnt to punish but instead keep things balenced.  
---
We have to accept the fact that when they  "play with their friends" , they are getting an extra edge over their opponent which skews the game in their favor.
---
That‚Äôs another reason I hate it lol
---
I mean it probably fixes all the hits through windows which shouldn't have hit. 
---
I only camp when all gens are done and I haven‚Äôt gotten a kill. I literally don‚Äôt know what to do after they get all the gens so I just make sure I get some blood points. 
---
If you use a mori you can't use shattered glasses. Scratched Mirror is total ass on any other map.
---
A glorious change.
---
No one cares how many hours you have Gaylord. 
---
Scratched Mirror is a Myers add on, not an offering. 
---
I mean she is. It doesn't just looks like it.
---
Oof
---
I'm not sure about anyone else but I find scratched Mirror pretty decent everywhere, except coldwind farm, maybe that's just me 
---
Welcome to karma roulette.
---
Darn.
---
Nope.
---
But how do you end it? In death or in freedom?
---
These outfits take a long time to make, be a little more pleased as you get them for free.
---
You should never watch juke tutorials, killers already know the jukes in them. Make up your own as you‚Äôre on the run
---
Yeah, sitting on 253 party starters on Nea, 53 on Quentin, 34 on Dwight. I have 68 bulbs on Nea, 48 on Quentin, 24 on Dwight.
---
"I have to camp the hooked person, because there's one gen left and they might have Adrenaline and will escape if I let them get unhooked". Is Adrenaline overpowered? That's an example of having to change your playstyle, for a perk that may or may not be there, to accomplish your goal.
---
You move like 2 percent faster than survivors with no blood lust. Survivors have to be pretty bad to get caught.
---
Except it wouldn't. Even just one guy wanting to check would be a reason to revert this change to solo players. :)
---
See how stupid that sounds? Now before saying it's a good change think about how often solos want to check and move on vs how often they tell  other randoms the load out. If it happens I'm sure it's close to 1% of the games. But hey, Reddit killers are a different breed, why am I surprised.
---
So what changed? Survivors got worse? No lol. People stopped using it successfully against you. 
---
If you wanna derank while also making people lose their items, just DC after you hit them. It's quicker.

Perks i recommend grabbing:
---
* Dwight: Bond *(the other 2 perks don't really have high enough % to be that useful)*
---
* Meg: All of em
---
* Claudette: Self Care *(Botany Knowledge is ok, i prefer We'll Make It/Autodidact over it, Empathy is good but i personally prefer Bond or Aftercare)*
---
* Jake: Iron Will *(Calm Spirit is too situational, Saboteur is a waste of time)*
---
* Nea: Urban Evasion &amp; Balanced Landing *(Streetwise isn't that useful/too low %)*
---
* Bill: Borrowed Time *(other two perks are situational)*
---
* David: Dead Hard, We're Gonna Live Forever *(No Mither is sort of a "hard mode" perk)*
---
* Feng: All of em
---
* Tapp: Detective's Hunch &amp; Stake Out are ok *(Tenacity is situational)*
---
* Kate: Dance With Me *(combine DWM with Lithe and possibly Quick &amp; Quiet, Windows of Opportunity can be good for newer players, Boil Over is situational)*
---
* Adam: Deliverance, Autodidact *(all 3 of Adam's perks are situational but these two are quite good)*
---
* Jeff: Aftercare *(the 2 others are ok as well)*
---
I left out Laurie, Ace and Quentin on purpose, Ace's &amp; Quentin's perks are too situational/not that useful/only good for certain builds (chest hunting for example), Laurie's perk Decisive Strike is OP in the right hands but i suggest you learn to play with out it, a good survivor doesn't need it. As for her other two perks, Sole Survivor is quite useless &amp; i only suggest using Object of Obsession if you're good at looping/losing the killer, i personally use it to locate the killer/take aggro when needed.
---
My current build: 1. Aftercare or Bond, 2. Balanced Landing or Dead Hard, 3. Iron Will, 4th perk is whatever (usually something like Autodidact/Object of Obsession/We'll Make It/Adrenaline/Quick &amp; Quiet...).
---
for me it's 'hurry unhoojk me!" MOOOOOOOOOOVE
---
Topless Amanda? I'd play Pig for that.
---
I imagine this would be a cool for fun mode if it would exclude invisible skill checks.
---
What sounds need to be fixed?
---
It's not 2017 anymore. If you let survivors blind you when you're picking up a survivor, it's because you're bad.
---
It's definitely not perfect, but the difference is enormous. I played Nurse for the first time in months and I was actually able to play her properly, same with Huntress
---
I still have issues sometimes but it's mostly lag issues rather than FPS. I'll still have a skill check lag on occasion right before it comes up so it just immediately makes me miss it before I can even see it
---
But overall it's much smoother, and FPS issues are still there, but they're much, much less severe and less constant

its not zubat, its Mr.GEGZ with his bullshit addons again

Lvl'ed Survivor Nea yesterday to Lvl 35 to get the Teachable Urban Evasion.
---
Installed &amp; Started PTB and suddenly am lvl 11... ?
---
Any Clues/fixes?
---
I bought Pig during Winter Sale, am excited to try her out now!
---
Where is Ardethabite and Scottjund? 
---
I like your attitude 
---
Not just that. Knowing if a killer has BBQ or Nurse Calling also makes quite the difference. And a lot more perks that aren't super obvious to spot.
---
Survivors: hook rush Myers
---
Myers: *pops T3*
---
*surprised pikachu meme*
---
Seriously though, they never learn. 
---
I often decide to slug No Mithers instead of placing them on their final hook just to show my appreciation for them
---

---
Survivors want their easy mode, why get better when their SWF squad can carry their worthless ass? The babies want their pacifiers, and if you take it away they'll throw a tantrum (review bombs).
---
If survivors are so fucking pathetic they'd rather quit the game than get better they should quit. The game should not cater to their refusal to improve.
---
And not more than one single pat aswell.
---
As a killer i resigned to knowing am going to be hated on no matter what.
---
sometimes its for the killer i selected....
---
doc is bad, pig is bad, hag is bad, myers is bad, everything is an OP character who shouldnt be used....
---
Sometimes its for "camping".....   
---
just hooked someone , can see 2 of you just meters away waiting to rescue not even hiding..... but am supposed to chase the tea bagging Nea who is standing near teh pallet..... sureeee .....
---
sometimes i save the last survivor if they played really well and didnt behave like an asshole.
---
last time i was chasing a claudette on the swamp map, dont know what happened but she got stuck between me and a bit of wall.
---
she gave me hell all game, really smart player, had to work real hard to get her but I felt bad ending her like that. hatch was open so i downed her , took her to it and threw her in.
---
she was really nice in post game chat.
---
not all survivors are assholes..... just a lot of them :D
---
I would lie if I say would have never done that. Thankfully that was long, long ago.
---
I quit the lobby when there's three survivors, and the fourth doesn't seem to spawn. Seems to fix when one of the three leaves lol
---
When the lobby is empty and nothing happens for a while (Or I'm just impatient)
---
When last trial I got a toxic survivor and I want him in my lobby again to destroy him once more xD
---
Bill has too much swag for this world.
---
That is amazing! Thank you so much! All of that sounds really good!!! 
---
Good teammates attract to each other and form SWF links that prevent them from playing with random survivors (and you). This leads to majority of non-SWF survivors being bad and pushing each other away, preventing them from joining into SWF and learning through collective experience. 
---
That's some basic survivor physics for you. 
---
It will only piss stupid survivors off. Even if they're using a purple flashlight with a pink bulb, the shit isn't super hard to get, if they just do gens and farm you for chase points, they'll end up with more free BP than the item was worth in the first place.
---
Doesn't matter if they're in the open. The new pickup animation is so fast that if the survivor isn't a few feet away when you start the animation, they do not have enough time to get in front of you and get a successful blind save. 
---
All you have to do is check any very close corner or walls they might be waiting behind, then turn towards the least open area and stand still. The survivor will come running out to get in front of you, and you just turn around and hit them, no pick up necessary. 
---
It's so easy to avoid now that I've stopped running empathy, my favourite perk.
---
The Wraith x Nurse is gone a long way since it started as a fanart back when nurse was released 
---
I do it everytime, you never know. I usually also say some nonsense to get them to say more
---
Why do people think _I win with X_ is a reasonable argument in the first place?  
---
_I win with Freddy at Rank 1, without even using perks! Freddy is strong AF. You guys who think he is weak are just stupid._  
---
And this isn't an exageration. That argument has literally been made quite a few times in the past.
---
It still works on generators, but it stays at 3%/6%/9% everything else got the 15%/20%/25%
---
&gt;Spies from the Shadows: Increased the chances of a visual notification to 100% for all tiers. Added crow in Loud Noise notification. Increased the notification range from 16/24/36 meters to 32/40/48 meters.
---
The snitches are back my dudes
---
Yes, exactly
---
Not to forget their spaghetti code may not be able to handle it.
---
It‚Äôs wrong for me to critique someone‚Äôs thoughts? 
---
What the fuck is the point in critiquing if it‚Äôs wrong to do?
---
I haven‚Äôt downvoted a single one of your reply‚Äôs. don‚Äôt assume things buddy, it‚Äôs makes an ass out of you and me.
---
Whenever survivors burn it I am like:  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9muK2M36c
---
Alright then, keep your secrets. 
---
No, if ypu read the patch notes, you'll see that it still affects generator repair, but all the other actions got the 15%/20%/25% buff while the generator repair speed stayed at 3%/6%/9%
---
They look super badass to me, but now I can't unsee it, the image is tainted. From Merciless Alpha Survivor With Knife to sweaty guy in hoodie from the city park charging at you
---
DamnNoHTML is Scott Jund.
---
That's why I'd love to be able to look at past matches. I don't know how many times I've habitually cycled through the endgame stats when I wanted to see what the killer was running. Maybe just the last 3 games, even? 
---
Yeah leaving does fix that issue and that‚Äôs not really what i was talking about but it sounds like my issue is already being addressed. 
---
Yeah there's no point in camping during the game. You'll end up screwing yourself with better players
---
&gt;Maybe the fact that his insta down is undodgable and can down a whole party of survivors?
---
Just stay near a pallet or a window and there you go.
---
&gt;Oh and the fact that everyone who plays him is a hook camping asshole?
---
As someone who plays LF as my second killer, that isn‚Äôt true. 
---
Trump Illuminati confirmed.
---
Luckyly they are just testing it out, I am confident that it won't make it to the live build of the game. It seems like something weird to do with self care since in my opinion, it was in a very good spot
---
But hey don't worry, this killer usually stays :D I listen to music, talk to friends a little and it feels like no time when the survivors poof in
---
When you try your best, but you don't suceeeeed.
---
Sadly thats true.
---
Some survivors will say anything to justify why they deserve an easy mode.
---
The devs could at least let us know we are in lobby with an  SWF group so we can adjust perks.
---
Right-click simulator was never fun. I can play survivor while watching a movie.
---
Good job!
---
Eh, I watched his stream afterwards and he even admitted it was hugely op
---
It's not as bad as it seems, what I think happened is: I think they tought that leader wasn't supposed to give a speed boost to generator repair at all. However, Leader still gives the 3%/6%/9% increase to generator repair, so when they say it still gave a speed buff, I think they assumed it was the 15%/20%/25% that all other actions got
---
Because it's an asymmetrical game so no 1v1 Can be Fair.
---
One survivor will probably die against a killer but the killer cannot stand in 3 or 4 place in the same time so every role has his disadvantages and every behaviour Is legit because has his downsides.
---
A community shouldn't create rules beyond the ones of the game itself, i think It makes the enviroment more toxic.
---
P.s. a see a lot of complaints about killers camping or tunneling but nobody says nothing about survivors stalking the killer completely shutting him down. 
---
P.p.s. don't take that as a complain xD i'm totally fine with that.
---
1 pip away from rank 7
---
I saw this hentai before.
---
Leader is supposed to affect repair speed. The patch notes said that all action speeds get a 15%/20%/25% speed boost with leader except for generator repair speed wich stays at 3%/6%/9%
---
All easy to spot especially if your running distortion 
---
It does mean that. 
---
I played last night and I got camped 4 out of 9 games played
---
To answer this question as truthfully as possible we have to look into something about Rank 1 first.  
---
(1) Rank 1 doesn't mean you face good players. Rank 1 has all sorts of players.  
---
(2) Really good players will be at Rank 1.  
---
Keeping this in mind it is important to differantiate between if you want to be Rank 1 and have solid matches or if you want to be competetive against people going tryhard with map offerings, best possible surv build and swf.  
---
**Every killer with any perks can be rank 1 and have good time**. So play whatever you want and as long as you play remotely competent you will be Rank 1. If you want to be able to have a fair fight against the best possible survivor setup there is (You will meet this one game out of 20 if we are generous. Usually even more rarely) noone except the nurse is viable.  
---
Leader does affect generator repair, but it is at the old 3%/6%/9% speed boost. The 15%/20%/25% is for all other actions
---
Prove yourself buff, Surveilance and Spies from the shadows buffs, Pig crouch and Deviousness buffs. (incoming) Totem placement fixes.
---
All these are solutions to problems that were brought up by community. 
---
Do dull totems, that noed works is your own Damm fault, I always do my gen, go around cleaning, meanwhile others save each other and finish the last gennys, why only skill ess suvivors complain about noed? 
---
I was about to expect downvotes once I say it looks like shit... but I guess it wasn't just me after all.
---
The just do totems response is completely true though, don‚Äôt wanna get downed by noed, do totems and don‚Äôt genrush.
---
For the past months I‚Äôve encountered so many killers with Noed that I go out of my way to cleanse totems (unless my team isn‚Äôt doing gens). I agree that it kinda sucks to not know if your team has done totems if you‚Äôre in solo queue, but at the same time there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a reason to worry if people actually did the totems.
---
I rarely get teammates who does this, so I usually end up having to do it myself. But if everyone who complained about Noed actually cleansed the totems they ran past, Noed wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. Yes, it is time consuming to run around looking for them and cleansing them, but I‚Äôd rather take that over getting fucked by Noed in the end.
---
Eventually you‚Äôll learn where they spawn which makes it go by faster, but even if you don‚Äôt know the spawn locations, you can use Small Game to help you.
---
Ace still doesn‚Äôt have finger guns.....
---
Thanks for the info pal
---
Watch some streams or youtube, youll pick some basics up
---
Calm down there kiddo
---
Out of 200 hours it happened once. A dead teamate sent me a group invite called "the killer has NOED" or something along those lines.
---
No.
---
I trust they‚Äôll see unnerfing self care like this takes us back to Selfcare meta and I don‚Äôt want that as a survivor cause I dont like lone wolf gameplay seeing other people reach out with stuff like We‚Äôll make it and autodidact is evidence of adapting to healing nerfs. I may need to run Clourophobia as a killer if not cause the Sloppy Butcher meta is still gonna be here. 
---
So is Face camping though.
---
Not that I'm saying you should Face Camp except in very specific circumstances (Two people left, one has Jigsaw's Baptism and is on a hook, the other is trying to save them. Make your choice: Potentially get both or let the JBed guy escape through the hatch), but it absolutely is part of the game, just as dropping pallets is.
---
I mean, you can say "What are survivor's supposed to do, run in a straight line and let you hook them?", to which anyone could respond with "What are Killers supposed to do, just *let* you unhook people?"
---
Whoever puts it on deserves the golden chainsaw
---
Ngl thats cool as fuck man
---
[deleted]
---
By around the corner you mean about a year? 
---
No, there probably wont be any info for a while but I would say its safe to say that dbd will be there in some form at some point
---
If you‚Äôre that curious as long as you didnt get killed first, just wait till the end. Unless the game comes to a hatchoff, just be a little patient dude. 
---
I honestly can't think of anything either side can do besides post game chat abuse which is toxic
---
A post about post game screen happened like every week
---
Calls someone and hindrance for the team for not running a specific perk... then admits to dc every time the killer is legion, forcing the other survivors to play a 3v1...
---
They already gave us a estimate of when to expect more optimization updates. Also choosing to force pessimism on yourself is kinda odd. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs not coming, it just hasn‚Äôt reached the threshold they said yet. 
---
I guess I'm an idealist, but I think that it would make a decent enough difference. It would at least let the devs balance around having some basic communication, which they can't do currently.
---
Just want to mention 3 occasions I can think of where the hatch stand off can go to the killers favor:
---
1. The Hag: if you find the hatch, you place a trap next to it and start looking for the survivor, if you are chasing them and they make it to the hatch with enough distance between you and them, they will often jump, even tough they triggered the trap, giving you a grab and ending the game.
---
2. The Pig: if the last survivor has a trap on their head, you can wait out the timer, however, there are a few problems with this: the trap needs to be activated and survivors can force a chase by running around in front of you, crouching stops the chase, but you can't grab while crouched, so I like to use insidious
---
Edited. 
---
I never did understand how she‚Äôs so popular when she barely talks to her chat. The only times she does is when someone gives her money/subscribes and she gets all high pitched and acts like she‚Äôs so touched. Put that same donator in the killer role next match and she‚Äôd probably call them garbage. She‚Äôs extremely passive aggressive and acts like she‚Äôs so innocent when her sarcastic comments are how she truly feels. 
---
I never even considered the idea of shipping killers until I saw this image. Thanks BHVR! 
---
Do you have a link for the video or the stream? 
---
That could also work. But forcing us to wait is stupid.
---
Dont cleanse the totems so you have a better chance of finding the hex. DS can only be used once. Unless they are at a loop it's not really a free escape. If someone is looping you all game, the smart thing to do is abandon the chase and go find a weaker player. 
---
I don't use NOED but I do use BBQ and Nurses calling and while many savvy survivors will counter play these perks anyway it takes away any guesswork.
---
There are also a bunch of other perks or setups that are considerably weakened once Survivors know what is going on.
---
That‚Äôs a great the shape
---
I have never had an issue finding a match as a survivor. Ever.
---
They never said that, afaik.
---
Better visibility and for low settings felt like it had less input lag, I can easily play the game on ultra and still have over 60fps but low settings feels more responsive. 
---
Noise notifications don‚Äôt have a maximum range but they do have a minimum range. If you‚Äôre like &lt;10 meters you don‚Äôt get one because you can clearly see them producting that notification. 
---
My bad. Didnt know that. Just watching his streams tbh. 
---
Facecamping is a choice. Arguably a strategy. Stunning the killer with a pallet is mandatory gameplay of any survivor that ends up in a chase.  
---
They are different in facecamping being optional while the usage of pallets is mandatory. 
---
See, this is the reason why I don't blame Killer for camping. It's educational behaviour. 
---
As long as people will keep rewarding the Killer's camping strategy by rushing to him, why would he stop? 
---
There's already counterplay to camping, and if a Killer camps for a few games but nobody takes the bait, he'll keep losing and stop. 
---
You can't blaim camping because there's 3/4 chances you're the one allowing it. 
---
Surveillance is actually kinda good now too
---
Its a meme you dip
---
*Laughs in scratched mirror*
---
Like I said, you only get the same killer when you just played against them because you‚Äôre queueing at the same time. That‚Äôs going to happen at any rank. She‚Äôs also going to get stream snipers at any rank. 
---
High ping lobbies are NOT only at high ranks.
---
I only play DBD at night and there‚Äôs about as many people that play at night as in the day, look at the steam charts. 
---
Rank may not be as great of an indicator for survivor but for killer it‚Äôs a little more accurate. So yea, there‚Äôs a lot of good survivors at low ranks but that doesn‚Äôt mean low rank killers are as good at high ranks. 
---
I‚Äôve never bought a cosmetic in any game, but I really do want this one. Actually impressed.
---
I've pipped and got a lot of bp with a 0k. I consider that a good game and fun. I rarely play as killer but I hate sandbaggers despite what side I'm playing. If someone sandbags me I wont save them off the hook. If someone sandbags in front of me as the killer, I got for the sandbagger. That's just me. I dont care if it gets me a 0k. It may be poor play to you and that's ok. I'm more into fun play for everyone around.
---
Unintentional, and will be fixed. 
---
cAN SOMEBODY POST ALL THEIR ANIMATIONS
---
And get banned
---
but what if were swf with no voice comm.... do we need to be severely punished for playing together?
---
No he needs some advice on how to stop doing drugs.
---
¬øque?
---
Waaaaait... staying in a locker hides your aura from bbq?!?
---
Ebic
---
Straight up buffs would be 
---
- Moderately reduced the chance to escape a bear trap
---
- Every bear trap starts primed and have been placed in better locations 
---
- Base trap setting time reduced 
---
- Rescue time increased 
---
QoL is adding things that make add-ons more useful and allowing him to place down more traps at the start without relying on add-ons. The aura reading could also be countered by distortion. It boosts his power without making it OP and allows him to have better tracking abilities. 
---
Easier to last way longer vs Freddy than legion lol
---
Source?
---
Because from my experience, many people run Dead Hard instead of Sprint Burst.
---
What a time to be alive
---
these seem like new skin portraits !! 
---
Because in the last dev stream, which I watched, they only mentioned:
---
1. Ending Frenzy early will let you retain the remainder of your Frenzy meter.
---
2. Hitting an injured, but not Deep Wounded, Survivor with Frenzy will put them into Deep Wound with 10 seconds off of the timer.
---
I think its fine like this people really dont have time to heal each other and if the devs want to slow the game down nerf something else in mind for good reason SC will be the most picked survivor perk especially with things like franklins or sloppy butcher
---
I‚Äôm fairly new to this game. Does camping only count as staring at the hooked survivor or does doing a wide patrol around them count also? I don‚Äôt want to BM so I‚Äôm looking for clarification 
---
Yep.
---
Make Your Choice
---
Iron Maiden
---
Bitter Murmur etc...
---
Not to mention any number of killer add-ons 
---
I'm getting Siren vibes from that Spirit background. I really hope the decide to invest in a really creepy Yamaoka Estate map in the future.
---
Unless I've misinterpreted it, as a tracking perk the new Surveillance is pretty good.
---
At the start of the game, you can track all players working on generators. This gives you an idea of the player spread and distribution, and gives you a clear direction to beeline in for a chase. If you're a high mobility character such as Nurse or Billy (map permitting), you've saved yourself a good amount of time already.
---
Once you conclude the chase and get a survivor on the hook, you then focus your attention on red generators. Kick any you find and patrol the remainder until the unhook or a new chase. If you kick a generator and it goes yellow before you've left; sweep and chase.
---
Late game during the 3 gen stand-off, you can bring the game to a crawl because as long as you're regressing generators, you've got survivor locations on lockdown. The perk essentially tells the killer: if it's red, check and kick, if it's yellow, sweep and chase, if it's white ignore it.
---
It falls apart in scenarios where the generators aren't a factor (gates powered or 1 player left) or killers that can't reliably sweep the map and always be kicking.
---
The argument can be made that this gameplay loop is bad for the killer or it might not fit certain players' playstyles. That's fine, but for one perk I think it's great as a survivor and makes me terrified as an "immersion" survivor player. 
---
As a parting shot: The perk's existence (like NOED for cleansing ALL totems) induces a change in survivor gameplay ("first one on gens" phobia is real already) regardless of whether it's being used.
---
If oversmarted was even a word, you wouldnt use it here
---
Because there is no reason to be a high or low rank since rank has no effect on the game at all
---
Agreed, best scene in the movie.
---
Also maybe the matchmaking could be based on player level, that way it could be balanced.
---
Why not? 
---
Lets hope sharp hand joe and edgy teenagers can't yeet a hit through the window.
---
You can also send the killer messages informing on teammates, the chance is very slim, but it's still there....
---
Yeah a few have noticed this.
---
Wonder if this was intentional as it doesn't mention it in the patch notes.
---
Guessing freddy needed a nerf?
---
Is there a way to do this to the in game music (like the dramatic chase music?)
---
It's either
---
A: Bugged
---
or
---
B: Preparing him for his rework
---
PTB is a great chance to try that super legit camping strategy.
---
Excellent. Glad this became a thing. 
---
everybody was kung fu fighting!
---
That looks like the sweatiest match ever 
---
Oh man, so much has changed in this game since 2016, I dont even know where to start..  I think the biggest was the removal of infinities.  That use to be the biggest DS gripe, even a crummy survivor could run those loops and then DS and the chase would start all over again.  
---
Op was already injured.
---
&gt; There is no way to block or affect third party voice chat apps.
---
They can block party chat on PS4. They have chosen not to because they want SWF communicating. 
---
You know, there are probably survivors out there who find all 5 totems during a game so NOED does not bother them in the slightest. Can we deduce from this fact that NOED is not an issue? 
---
As yes, the old "mention trump to boost views, sales, or in this case, karma" trick.  
---
Exacatly! There are so many hooks on maps these days than even those running DS who arent the obsession rarely have time to get to 20%
---
&gt; Survivors want their easy mode
---
Killers want easy mode. That's why some crappy killers moan about SWF. 
---
same
---
deja vus new meta perk
---
Depends on what you mean by "earlier" 
---
We just gonna ignore Kate's boob physics now?
---
do you plan on calling anything suggested as a "Severe punishment?"
---
i only wanted something to compensate the fact that some killer abilities and perks are going to be rendered soemwhat useless by playing vs people in VC.
---
you have to see that SWF get an edge from that while killers get jack shit from  it.
---
A group of swf NOT IN VC is pretty rare and more of an exception in this case.
---
However there is Nothing stopping the survivors from getting into VC , many free solutions out there.
---
Yeah im rank 5 and I dont deserve being theres too much bs and Hex:Ruin gets taken out 30 seconds into the game. Always one sided games with swf.

Create a non-blinding flashlight with unlimited battery

---
So? 
---
There is a buff for the legion that the devs are playing around with in the ptb, injured survivors will also have 5 seconds taken off of their timer making stab wounds study and frank's mixtape a one shot combo.
---
It's in the lower part of the smaller pantry. It's always bloody there.
---
This is what everyone‚Äôs been asking for. There‚Äôs only a few twinks who are fine with the current power.
---
So? You don't always have time to rev. 
---
This just made Quentin join my Survivor Army
---
Its now Jake, Kate, Nea, Dwight, and Quentin
---
For killer: BBQ, Distressing, Beast of Prey,  Bitter Murmer
---
Somebody wants the bing-bong. ;D
---
His wig fell off
---
I would be EXTREMELY happy, also Nurse and Freddy while you're at it, please thank you.
---
Franklins can help, but you gotta actually hit them first which is where I can struggle
---
In the ptb he is even slower. 
---
What? It has no effect on the game at all? Have you never played this game before? Rank has an effect on how much you know about the game and how good you are. Someone who has never played the game before Rank 20 facing a Rank 1 god tier player, their is no difference between the two? 
---
I mean, empathy still tells you where the Killer is if they're in a chase, you can still RUN it.
---
Seeing how Quentin is about to fall to sleep, your user flair checks out
---
This looks fun, I wish I was there XD
---
Wait is the wraith fucking smirking
---
Nice
---
Oh god please why
---
that's a very good point, never thought of how similar they are. Either way, both are very unfun to play against.  With Legion, I am kind shocked by how easy it is to tunnel people.  Like you said, you have zero chances of escaping him/her, at least it Freddy you have a chance of waking up from the dream state but that damn deep wound takes forever it seems.
---
Cool, was I leatherface, hillbilly, or spirit?
---
Praise the entity!  \o/
---
Omg I love this
---
See, I have no problem with people using refs (or tracing shit if it‚Äôs all for good fun) but i saw the OP talking about plans on selling them as prints/whatever and that‚Äôs a problem imo. 
---
I know that, but I play SWF quite a lot so I usually have a good general idea of where the killer is anyway. I mainly used empathy for flash saves.
---
*sips tea*
---
Look at bing bong boi. just standing there. menacingly. 10/10 still would hug 
---
I thought I was the only one who left totems up like just in case they are running NOED.  Another tell-tale sign the killer is running NOED, is if they are clearly terrible at chasing but are high ranks, around 10-5, the booster NOED killer signs are easy to read.  Plus some killers are notorious for always running NOED...like doctor, Pig, Trapper. Also if you are up against a Billy who is terrible at chainsaw hits, you can guarantee he has NOED.
---
We got bored so we decided to do a "Killer Appreciation Night" after seeing another team do it to a killer. For the most part we had only two games where the killer was not having it and murdered us. The other games turned into us schmoozing the killer into loving us. Ironically all the red rank killers loved us, but the two that didn't were purple. Oh well, we still love them.
---
Yea it seems unintentional. Even without touching a killer they can mess them up. Lets hope they can fix it before the patch goes live.
---
NOED was not my prime point. I meant to draw analogy. I'll put it in simple words: if you personally don't encounter this problem, it does not mean the problem is not there. 
---
Yes, multiple DS is rare occurence. Mostly because DS is behind a paywall along with not-so-exciting content for typical survivor. But it does not make it any better when you do encounter multiple DS. 
---
I thought it was 50%? Edited post.
---
Survive With Friends
---
What if they are all running with flashlights and tbagging you?
---
Not necessarily though what listed was kinda severe though...  and for me to play with my friend without being gimped is a cause to be hindered then... its kinda is severe...
---
Yup, he is viable at rank 1. Just dont expect all games to go well, You are gonna have some games where you get wrecked.  Just laugh it off and move on to the next.  I mainly run Huntress, Wraith, Freddy and Clown.  Some maps I get destroyed on....looking at your Haddonfield. On the games I get wrecked, I just try to have fun and hope the survivors get the door open fast LOL
---
Yes, this is a nerf for Whispers. If you are fast enough to crouch immediately, though, the nerf is almost nullified since the TR changes much faster.
---
The clown had frenklin's...
---
That really is a dirty trick and you guys should be ashamed of yourselves for being assholes.
---
Wait, what map and where specifically is this? Watched my roomie search for a ruin totem last night and couldn't find it the entire match.
---
It's a CLUE to who the next Killer is... The Sandman!!
---
So, you want Deviousness points for NOT using her power? 
---
From the Wiki: "Deviousness - Awarded for clever use of their Power."
---
Idk if I would label this fan content 
---
Okay! I mostly play solo
---
It's pretty clear that either the devs don't play the game or they don't understand it. They're constantly making braindead decisions like this that anyone who plays the game can tell them is a bad idea. 
---
Wow this is incredible! Look at my bing bong boi.
---
That's what I thought, until it turned out to be haunted grounds. 
---
To make him better at chasing and dealing with looping rather than holding M2 as it just rewards bad killers.
---
Yeah but maybe thats to clarify that it affects everything except gen speeds.
---
The bar definitely turns yellow, but people on the official forums are saying it doesn't affect gens.
---
I feel like its not meant to? Would be strange to have it do everything by 25% and then something else by 9%. Plus I feel this is why they changed prove thyself.
---
Framerate isn't that bad on console for Billy imo. Also I here he is actually better with a controller die to steering. You k ow racing games are better with a controller than with k&amp;m
---
I noticed the pig cause‚Äôs lots of disconnects too, I might get her too
---
Spotted the salty Doc main no brain.
---
Yeah, pretty much. When everyone hears a nurse they said "oh fuck" any other killer it's just "yeah it's a billy"
---
If you're able to hit someone quickly after coming other of stealth than that should be rewarded.
---
Yeah or as is said it only takes 2 hits 1 to initiate and 1 to down once the timer starts.
---
For both
---
Who are the nurse mains?
---
They all look so gorgeous. They're simple but cute I love em
---
It‚Äôs a PTB. Public Test *Beta.* *Beta* being the key word. These changes probably won‚Äôt make it into the actual game. 
---
After being Sacrificed or escaping, prior to this PTB patch, Survivors saw the end-game info detailing everyone's perks and add-ons. SWF players could use this to their surviving teammates advantage and inform them of perks or add-ons that they otherwise couldn't have known.
---
This hampers certain perks like NOED or Spirit Fury 
---
Sure, what would you do? I label as fan content b'cuz those 3D Renders belongs to me. 
---
Pretty strong tracking. I used it a bunch in it's nerfed state and it was respectable.
---
We have Wraith for that.
---
Stealth is just a part of Amanda's power. When you use it in full (with a dash), you are rewarded.
---
It wouldn't generate enough revenue to be worthwhile.
---
DLCs and store fodder is what brings the cattle in for milking.
---
The best feeling
---
phat nutt when the decisive dcs
---
And lots more crows every where
---
The Game is my favorite killer map since I main Doc. Terror radius blasting through floors/the roof is busted and I love it
---
I love throwing gas at my feet as the clown with enduring, and smacking there booty back down with them having no chance to escape.
---
I absolutely aspire these! Also, I ship Wraith and Huntress. 
---
I don't understand why they shouldn't work on the other Killers like Freddy who need more help than reworking a killer because people don't seem to enjoy playing against it.
---
just because people are complaining about a killer (much like they did with Freddie before his nerf) I don't think they should just change legion to appease a few people on the internet. I would imagine the people complaining or a vocal minority because most people I play against and whenever I play against allegiant I don't seem to have problems.
---
Makes sense and fair enough, but they could still release cosmetics around the time. They could also throw out other big changes or the Freddy rework at the same time to really draw attention.
---
Haha
---
Why did I make this?
---
What a joke. Get this shit out of our game, BHVR. 
---
Stop making killers that break the rules, it's so fucking annoying.
---
I‚Äôm not going to lie, facing against legion hasn‚Äôt been that bad for me, it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs experiences that seem to be voiced the loudest and I see where they are coming from. Still. 
---
You saying that everyone asking for it is in a logical statement. I'm certainly not asking for it and I sure you most people are not unless you have factual numbers it's hardly a correct statement.
---
I'd rather just mute chat entirely so I don't see the amounts of salt being dumped on me as a killer.
---
So fucking stupid. Decisive makes survivors so damn cocky. "Oh you're gonna down me? Np I'll just get my free escape" lol just leave
---
If you have friends it's really not that hard. Either way, the game doesnt need a "Casual" mode. The load times are already staggeringly long cause of a lack of people on normally, dividing the pool of people even more just cause you dont like playing against certain players isnt worth it.
---
More like pig
---
The main problem with allegiant is he throws this game on its head. people have to change how they play when they are lesion and when they face legion. And most people seem to be stuck in their ways refusing to change.
---
They're sacrificing all potential purple Feng skins for Bunny Feng :3
---
What?
---
That's no excuse to fucking nerf him again. The devs need to just completely ignore him until the rework is out and completed. This isn't the only nerf he's had recently. 
---
AFAIK, if killer "Leaves" the game, survivors get points (with 5000 bonus for "escaping"). If killer shuts the game down completely, survivors are out of luck.
---
I think it should be different for solo players. I truly just want to know why I lost. I think this might result in more false reports of cheating 
---
If they close the application/turn off console, you don‚Äôt get bloodpoints, annoying as fuck. If they leave normally, you do get bloodpoints
---
But they already confirmed the ship as canon on a lore stream that happened a while ago
---
So chase them to the gates and then you don't have to wait 20 minutes? You're not gonna change the way other people play, and a lot of survivors like to BM, especially against killers who didn't have a good game.
---
Dull Machete for lamest Map goes to Lery's Memorial Institute
---
Even if I'm a main survivor, I really like this idea of new offering.
---
The devs need to ignore him until the rework is completed and out, instead of continuing to fucking nerf his ass. 
---
What I meant is that it's probably not intentional. Might have slipped through into the PTB by accident. Hence why it's not noted in the patch notes.
---
I use this with a mori and go to laugh town. Sometimes get multiple DCs as I jab my blade into their gut and laugh maniacally
---
They‚Äôre banners for the new skins they‚Äôre adding after this midchapter patch comes out, although those maps would be cool to get new stuff for 
---
LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT DAMN YOU!
---
I cleanse totems often enough anyway that it'd basically just be a waste of bloodpoints against me, especially for a "very rare."
---
But it'd be particularly mean against new players who don't know totem spawns yet, especially if it "protected" stuff like Devour.
---
I know it's skin banners but also the backgrounds are very interesting for me, spirit specific, so I was wondering what if... :)
---
*piece 
---
Well using her dash isn't always the best way to use her and I shouldn't be penalized BP for playing optimally.
---
Honestly hard call 
---
Because there are so many whining people that bashed and raged at Legion.
---
In my opinion (I play Legion and played against) I don't see any fucking problem with it. They say it's broken and other shit because they can't escape him or he's OP (like seriously?  Legion OP?). They cry about the fact they use Mori or NOED. Ffs, now the killers have to play how survivors want, yell at from the beginning for what perks to use and what style of playing...I actually got that kind of message.
---
People will never be content with anything they get, they will always complain about something you did, the devs did, etc :)
---
I knew the slutty school girl was coming, I like her weapon though. 
---
this is why franklin's is my favorite killer perk
---
I agree but I've seen slme comments from solo players saying they sometimes message their rabdom team mates telling them what the killer has, so I guess that is why the devs decided to set it up for both types of players. I know not every single solo player does this. We have in Mexico a saying to describe something like this: "The just pay for the sinners", sounds better in spanish I guess. 
---
I guess. But if its still there after the PTB it's an unneeded nerf. 
---
Thats the gag of the season
---
I‚Äôm definitely going to do this next time I can get a game lol
---
Hopefully these changes don‚Äôt go through. 
---
Survivor mirror is better imo. Vault changes don't change killer experience much.
---
How come every time I make a killer dc I get no bloodpoints AND lose my item
---
As long as I get my money back sure they can remember work him, I like his vaulting 
---
It's fair. Flashlight saves are a legit way to beat a killer. It's good strategy for the killer to remove that from the equation, to increase their odds of winning.   
---
It's called strategy sweetie; look it up.
---
For some reason it didn't work when I used them together
---
You have to pay to see them all, though.
---
Then you encountered a bug - every google result confirms they stack. 
---
Sprint and Overcharge are the only good perks oof
---
You are the embodiment of evil
---
Big brain Min Main
---
I agree there's not much to do against that (ability wise), but I do know that skilled survivors can outsmart him. So maybe those that complain need some more hours in game before shouting at every possible Legion they encounter. 
---
Just my thoughts, but then again I don't rage when killers Mori me or catch me, I know I must've done some mistakes. 
---
Besides, Legion's mori is one of the best, I could never get mad over this. It happens sometimes when I see I play against Legion that I hope he would mori me :))
---
Nivida geforce experience lets you change your gaming experience. In this case I have my game turned up slightly and have clarity set to 100% so the game isn't so damn muddled.
---
Master yi has some of the highest kills but anyone that plays league knows hes not OP. Killers are noob stompers, and most players are lower ranks. With boths sides knowing how to play, survivors have the advantage
---
DIDNT GET MY 5K BP SEE YA
---
Suddenly Franklin's Demise useage goes up by 70% and Lightborn becomes trash tier.
---
Leader doesn't affect gens, but it does affect Totems and Exit Gates which is quite interesting. (Totem Rush 4head) Prove Thyself is actually useful now and also provides Bloodpoints which is nice.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not very rare to have that happen 
---
People like you aren't worth my time , I don't work 12 hour shits just to come back to (evidently stalkers) trying to shit talk me. Why are you following me between subs anyways? Go fuck off and waste someone elses time ya creeper.
---
If you are remotely average with your looping you will eventually get some killer stuns in there.
---
It's funny, every comment on this post with "Trump" in it has at least one upvote. 
---
Third time in this thread I say this: Why do you need the Killer's perks so urgently?
---
Actually in one dev stream they said they tested hatch closing and it didn't work out , which led to a bigger issue of "end game" and how they might rework it with a timer or something. So I'm positive that something like it might come 
---
Im getting a strong Chasing Amy vibe here...tracer
---
how is franklins toxic exactly?
---
Exactly my thoughts. Sometimes she does high-pitch noises, yells for no reason, and, once again, no interaction with viewers. Basically she talks only with her SWF teammates and that's it. Even other streamers who have either the same amount of viewers or even more pay way more attention to the chat while playing survivor OR killer. With all that she claims that she barely pays attention to the game since she wants to interact with her community. Like... what? Come on. 
---
My friend destroyed a hex at the start of the match once and I happened to be nearby at the time. Wraith decided to face camp me for it. 
---
Which would you recommend ?
---
Nothing more than backgrounds.
---
I agree that there isn‚Äôt much of a reason to hide offerings, however, if the devs are going to start hiding information to maintain the integrity of gameplay then it has to be even handed. There is only one reason to hide the killers perks post-game, and as has been stated by others, it‚Äôs not even that important since any survivor after a certain rank automatically assumes the most popular perks are going to be used.
---
Fucking Vegans
---
thank you for responding on the matter.
---
Me 2, also thats a T H I C C meme.
---
TBH I agree but it does make a lot of late game perks ~~actually viable~~ a lot more powerful.
---
Blood Warden might actually catch a team out now that people don't instantly know about it.
---
Does everyone on this sub automatically assume that no one plays this game? Or that they only play one side of it? Self projection isn't a good look for anyone. I play both sides, yes I've come across the teams of 10 year olds, no I don't dodge lobbies as a killer, yes it can be irritating but they don't do anything and on those games where you have a bunch of irritating little shits in the match you end up winning anyways because they all spend their time trying to abuse the killer instead of doing gens and if you're good at playing as the killer or have any kind of skill then you can take them out pretty quickly. I get my points then move onto the next match. It doesn't bother me. 
---
Not everyone that is swf plays like that. You dodging swf lobbies doesn't make you better at the game. It in fact does the complete opposite. There are so many boosted red rank killers on ps4 It's becoming sad. The few times they don't dodge the lobby they get walked all over and then facecamp the 1st person they down. So because the ranking system is fucked they only got there by dodging lobbies and picking on solo queue players so they can inflate their egos. It takes absolutely no skill, counter play or a thought process to beat up solo queue players on ps4. It's the equivalent of me deranking to 20 and then smashing brand new players in a matter of seconds.

They have a lot in common. Cry babies lose their minds when they see both of them. 
---
even slower
---
Overcharge. Imo, balanced landing and dead hard are better that sprint burst, so run those instead
---
What post doesn't have atleast 1 upvote?
---
Kappa
---
Eh LF is $5. I'm pretty sure the premium cosmetics are like $4 at best.
---
Leader doesn't even work with Gens now, unless the description in game is wrong.
---
Depends if you play killer or survivor?
---
Its actually not traced ;) im just that good boo , check out my other art if youd like tho 
---
I play both but I think I‚Äôll stick with Overcharge since it may slow down the game by a bit. 
---
Again your still dumb... There is no made up ruleset that I have to adhere to I play what I want , how I want , when I want to. Sorry you don't like my playstyle , would you have preferred me to politely closed my eyes and walked to the other side of the fucking map ignoring the 3 survivors right next to me? Last time I checked the game's objectives it said to either escape as survivor or sacrifice survivors to the entity not play some convoluted 3 dimensional chess.
---
She got two downs out of it. It was a Spirit with 2 pink add ons. We completed 1 generator. 
---
Good choice. 
---
Scuffed invisibility
---
It was kinda obvious but I don't see the problem. They still look cool.
---
Only if you DC too much.
---
Hahaha, good one! 
---
Nurse gets around. Wasn‚Äôt she also with the Doctor?
---
Time to self downvote! 
---
Not a waste. Totems are worth points and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Better be safe than sorry.  Im just going to have to be a little more careful and find my ways of countering blood warden.  Might even stack up some keys :‚Äô)
---
His movement speed was always slower when he's aiming his power. It's like a 5% slow or so.
---
The paint is still fresh, but I'm long gone - Nea

No Claudettes can hide from me especially when I switch maximum Bloodhound!

Just a lil bit.
---
I like L√©ry‚Äôs because I like to use Bamboozle and I play Myers and Clown.
---
Sprint burst, adrenaline, sprint burst, run into the sunset as the killer fades from view
---
That'd be nice.
---
Saw someone else with the idea to give you points for how long someone has a RBT on their head once it gets removed. So the longer it stays on, the more points you get.
---
the Gods have spoken: nurseXwraith
---
The first person is how you have equipped as your survivor. The other three are random
---
And this is a game, you can't apply everything from movies
---
Coming up soon üëçüèΩ
---
You're still using the power to sneak up on people.
---
Makes me overjoyed that Bing Bong Boii gets a fucking vampire cape. Please let it be a body cosmetic and not tied to the head like all of Wraith's other drapes.
---
Its really good style for quick detail
---
&gt; Yes The Wraith has this Score Event, which is why it isn't far fetched for her to be granted the same.
---
Wraith has 1 Deviousness event attached to surprise attack, why do you thing Pig needs to have 2?
---
&gt; And using her dash isn't always the best way to use her.
---
This can be said about every killer's power. Do we add BP events for them too?
---
Description in game might be wrong. Patch notes didn't say anything about removing the leader effect on generators, it only said that the buff applied to all other actions, here are the exact words from the patch notes:
---
Leader: All action speeds, with the exception of repair speed, are increased to 15%/20%/25% instead of 3%/6%/9%. The effect now persists for 15 seconds after the perk owner is out of range.
---
Ngl , you cool as fuck man
---
Did this skin come out yet? 
---
It's now even slower on the ptb
---
Obviously they did, that's clearly intended, the killer is stalking them in the distance while in lobby. This will never change.
---
Can we appreciate how gorgeous the *skins* look? Damn if you've seen the leaks they're really top notch. The Chinese New Year skins in particular look amazing ~~even if they're bright af and will never be worn also **no Pig cosmetics RIOT IN THE STREETS.**~~
---
üòÇüòÇthanks
---
I had 3 survivors in a deadzone , one of them was injured and mori'able of fucking course I went after the adam. Its pretty simple math friend , 1 health state is less than 2. My job as killer isn't to fucking play nice and make sure you have a good time its to fucking kill you via any method available. Maybe , just fucking maybe if you don't want a killer to tunnel someone , don't unhook the person when both the killer and 3 fucking survivors are in one area? If anything that dwight farmed the poor adam.
---
Yes
---
Oh , she‚Äôs in it my friend
---
Meg looks so proud of herself like yeah I did my job here 
---
That's why you run Deja Vu #BigBrain
---
 Thank you
---
Im sure he‚Äôd hug you back :)
---
I like your name
---
Ignoring it seems sensible.
---
I'm of oriental descent and holy shit Feng looks like my mom in that dress.
---
You're using just a part of the power. Would you give points for every Nurse's blink? Or for every thrown Clown's bottle?
---
Could very well be. It's pretty hard to know when the patch notes, the perk description, the HUD in game and the actual gameplay contradict each other. Hard to figuer out wich one is the bug, but I think most logical might be then that they weren't clear in the patch notes and they forgot to remove the yellow bar for leader
---
You don't really counter doc, he still gets the shock points indicator come up when he shocks you, even if you don't scream.
---
If you're playing on 800x600 he does, sure.
---
So solo players will have to wait to see what the killer has?
---
I feel like SWF is that one kid in class who always gets in trouble but the whole class gets in trouble for it. 
---
And the only reason he gets in trouble is cause killers(the teacher) really hate him
---
Did this just come out?
---
0.00000000000000000000000000001% in the middle of fucking nowhere and it's either never found or found 3 seconds into the match by the immersed Claudette who's "doing gens."
---
Finally somebody else noticed!
---
This is just stolen from the top voted post
---
The Self-Care change is a test though (I suspect it will be added because playing solo truly sucks otherwise)
---
^^^
---
Yup this is spot on the money, sadly there is on easy way, its just leveling up to 99 and then rolling over it again
---
yeah when i saw this on the front page this morning it pissed me off, especially since other original fanart only gets ~200-300 upvotes whereas this traced ass bullshit gets 1k+
---
Fuck wake up op
---
Doctor isn't balanced, he's just an annoying prick who gets rewarded for Survivors standing on the map at any given time.
---
I complain about Doctor, but I don't use P3 Claudette nor Urban Evasion, I enjoy not having my ears bleeding because of the screaming.
---
*(inb4 just use Calm Spirit.)* It's too situational to use Calm Spirit.
---
5k &gt; 14k classic Laurie math
---
Postman is cumming
---
Removed for unrelated to dbd 
---
Yeah I guess I'm still missing the same game awareness I have now as a survivor but with killers so I can detect more of those situations. I mean as someone that plays SWF I know I have played in those situations you mention just didn't knew how much the killer player suffered from them.  
---
Crouching only takes 2 seconds and is being changed to 1.3 next patch, so reducing it by 3 seconds doesn‚Äôt really work.
---
Alright, brother. Don't get so worked up about it, it just a term that described a style of play, not everyone enjoys playing like that. 
---
Good luck in the fog.
---
Gib me dat salty PS4 messages u/Dan247
---
not true
---
That guy!?!? With that Jaw line!??!?!?! Lol yeah no, dont diss my mori like that
---
It‚Äôs pissed me off that they‚Äôre stating they aren‚Äôt traced...when uh...they are. I‚Äôm all for people tracing when they‚Äôre doing it as a hobby/for fun, but the way they‚Äôre acting over it is rubbing me the wrong way lmfao 
---
Fucking god same this is a revelation that it isn't JUST a skull
---
Eugh. Hope that's a placeholder. I thought it would just make the perks and shit transparent.
---
Cool idea but how would he know where loops/hooks/killers basement are?
---
Bc man boobs are never big enough for physics
---
He does t like survivors getting through his wall. Omg. 
---
I played a killer game with invisible pallets and I literally hated my life
---
This entire group was your typical super alturistic SWF, flashlight sniping, teabagging, you get the script, not gonna lie this was pretty satisfying
---
It‚Äôs our lord and saviour LongBeachGriffy
---
I LITERALLY CAN'T ESCAPE RANK 15 SURVIVOR
---
THERE IS OF COURSE MY OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THE UNNATURAL LEVELS OF UNAWARENESS OF MY TEAMMATES, BUT THE WORST PART IS ALMOST LITERALLY EVERY OTHER GAME MATCHING ME AGAINST SOME RANK 1 DERANKING SHITTER WHO ROFLSTOMPS MY TEAM AND I BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH MOR EXPERIENCE
---
IF YOU DELIBERATELY DERANK FOR EASY GAMES, ESPECIALLY IF YOU SHIT TALK THE OPPOSITE SIDE IN THE CHAT AT THE END, **FUCK YOU YOU'RE A SHIT PERSON AND I HATE YOU**
---
nea is bored of she being called killer
---
You get better value when a perk is offered in the shrine for the first time. I think its 250k for 2700 shards. Its usually better to wait for those, but there wont be a new perk every week.
---
Generally speaking, if you dont use shards for cosmetics you might as well trade them for BP, otherwise they are essentially collecting dust. 
---
I tend to save them for the better value new perks, but its nice to have some quick access emergency BP without having to play a game. Like "oh crap im out of BP and want to finish this bloodweb." 
---
I allways wonder what more they could od regarding spirit cosmetics
---
It's entirely possible the original poster intended to trace the killers, and didn't feel the need to declare that fact, and was only showing off about his sketchy style (which is still really well done). But, yeah. Idk. Good shitpost though.
---
That huntress hatchet throw sound at the end had me snort out all the cola I was drinking  out of my nose. Thank you. 
---
Surprisingly they didn't message me at all, too embarrassed I guess ü§∑
---
Shoutout to all my fellow Wraith mains.
---
Not an urgent need. But at the end of the game if i die early i would rather just be able to see what perks he has without needing to sit around waiting for the game to end 
---
This would be hell of a problem to solve. If there are survivors on hook, does the timer stops? If one of the survivors has a key that actually can open the hatch, does the timer stops? If there's a chase going on, does the timer stops?
---
&gt;I don't work 12 hour shits
---
Stop lying dude. You're not a nurse making 100k a year.
---
&gt;(evidently stalkers)
---
We post in the same sub, you moron. Nobody this stupid is a nurse unless all you do is spend 12 hours wiping ass. Which sums up your life story I'm sure.
---
nah when your that fast you zoom past them
---
Clearly you haven't played before since someone at rank 1 isn't always better than rank 20, I stumble my way to rank 1 and have no idea what I'm doing .
---
So no it doesn't have an effect on the game get a grip mate!
---
Oh I run into streamers all the time, some of them are good players but a lot of them are toxic for players because they think its funny and the best way to draw attention to their channel.  
---
I'm not saying its not a fun challenge during those games, just that toxic players are a dime a dozen in this game.
---
The only change in the killers visuals is that survivors are not visible. Think The Nightmare's vision. Both can still see everything else. Otherwise it would be impossible :)
---
I don‚Äôt mind it too much, it at least gives the survivors a small chance to survive. 
---
*sketchy style*
---
That‚Äôs what balances the killers a little more. Just practice if it‚Äôs a problem
---
Beyond tilting when people start bitching about how someone plays in a video-game , its a game meant for enjoyment and relaxing , not a piece of critique where people try to shit on you for playing the game. I understand its a term but jesus what other logical action should I have taken there? Hit the dwight and engage him in a lengthy chase while the meg breaks my ruin? Not utilize the mori I brought in for "because MMM mori's are OP"? Were 2 damn insta-heals in that match , see me bitching about the survivors removing any pressure I had created at the tap of a button? Play the damn game how you want and make the most of it , if you hate a playstyle hate the game that incentivizes it , not the player. Have a nice one "brother".
---
sprint burst, self care, decisive strike, adrenaline
---
I will often wait at the gates allowing the killer to down me so they get extra points
---
hmmm today i will put sprint burst and overcharge in the shrine for the tenth time
---
You see how well League‚Äôs skins sell? A big part in the sale is the initial thoughts 
---
Just took a picture of my TV with phone lol uploading from ps4 is too complicated 
---
I once killed all the survivors because they were tea bagging and trying to heal someone in the exit area. I downed the injured and killed all the others while they were trying to rescue her from the hook.  I‚Äôm not here to be nice
---
https://youtu.be/5tBoQKJM1ao
---
Honestly when the second hook was saboed is the point that you drop the Survivor and go "Listen here you little shit."
---
Damn you're actually woke af, u/Bobrysking123 
---
Oof p3 claudette. How many times did you lose the killer by standing still?
---
I don‚Äôt understand all the acronyms sometimes. What does bm mean?
---
Survivors cant find gens, theres windows everywhere, totems are either really good or really shit no in between. WHO IS THIS MAP FOR!?!?!
---
They could do an Oni mask, shrine maiden, maid outfit, some facepaint (kabuki style), karate gi. I'm out of ideas now
---
Kindred FTW

This is creeping me out
---
Not really that slutty
---
the devs too
---
I would like them to take freddy into the rework too, the legion is in a bad state and they keep making it worse by buffing them
---
Same 
---
Good thing you brought Mori ahead of time.
---
"Playing as intended" shut the actual fuck up. If the game can be played any certain way, then it's being played just as it was meant. Open to individual interpretation. Jesus christ mother fuckers like you are annoying.
---
And then blood warden activates before you leave because you hesitated to leave

Unfortunately doesnt work like that lol there's no way to upload to reddit with share button

I had this happen the other night, was looping lf and got stuck on an invisible gen. safe to say I got smacked up. Also had another game with no hud, couldn‚Äôt see anything not even skill checks, that was a fun round.
---
How bput instead give us access to post game stats for the last say 10 games. Or even 5.
---
It isn't an issue though
---
Time to bring back Calm Spirit then. 
---
I think it would be fun if there was a proximity voice chat for all players. So that way if I‚Äôm a killer I can just whisper childish insults at people
---
Ooo the oni mask I‚Äôd love that
---
200 boldness which can easily be earned by siting next to the basement for a couple seconds or getting chased. Until they make cleansing dull ones actually worth time by giving off some lightbringer, no ones going to be cleansing them
---
Something like a twisted and burnt Tachanka.
---
On top of it already being easier to get bp as a killer? Oookkkaaay nothing will make you happy
---
Sometimes it's better to M1 than to throw hatchet/rev chainsaw/throw bottle/shock etc.
---
That's the point you dingus. The top voted post claimed they hadn't traced the art when clearly they had 
---
No. All I fucking want is the DS nerf and secondary objectives to be (1) mandatory and (2) a part of the base game and not tied to a timed event. 
---
Otherwise it's a blah update.

HOW I BECOME A FULL MEMBER OF THE GREAT ILLUMINATI.
---
I‚Äôm Vincent Watt by name, and I‚Äôm a full member of the Illuminati.Before I became a member of the Illuminati, there was nothing to write home about me and that of my family members, it was hardship all the way even to feed my family was a great problem to me, I was rejected by friends , parents and even my own family, all because I was not having a dine , I was so frustrated in life to the point of even taking my own life , till I came across an agent of the Illuminati on the internet, at first I was thinking is was a scam but along the road I decided to give it a try since I have nothing to lose, I contacted the agent on his number +1(508)644-0400, he then gave me the Illuminati email address([illuminatikingdom099@gmail.com](mailto:illuminatikingdom099@gmail.com)) which I summit my application to and I had to wait for some couples of days, so it can be approved by our Lord Grand Master, to cut all stories short, it was approved and today I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm a full member of the hood, are you out there and your story is same as mine or you are rich and all you need is protection, you can also be a member of the hood and our Lord Lucifer will protection you and your family, in what so ever situation you may fine yourself today , I want to let you know that the Illuminati is here to make you become that great man and women you even dream to be, all you have to do is to contact the Illuminati agent on +1(508)644-0400, or [illuminatikingdom099@gmail.com](mailto:illuminatikingdom099@gmail.com), thanks

YOU DO REALIZE THAT YOUR CONNECTION ALSO MATTERS RIGHT
---
KILLERS HOST LOBBIES BUT THEIR INTERNET CONNECTION ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
---
LIKE ALSO, THEY COULD HAVE FINE INTERNET AND SO COULD YOU, BUT LATENCY
---
give me a link to an image without opacity pls
---
As a Killer, yes, you possibly are.
---
BECAUSE EVERYONE FINDS IT 5s INTO THE FUCKING MATCH!
---
Definitely buy it if you're on PC. If you're on console, watch some gameplay and decide if you want it. As a console player, I love the game and have put hundreds of hours in but it definitely has performance issues on console, although these seem to be less severe on newer consoles like ps4 pro.
---
I love how you used Ness as Freddy reference because they both are trash.
---
Im not worried about beeing sniped. It means more viewers, bad or good. Advertising in your name is the easiest thing you Can do to get something going for your channel. So ill take my chance on that
---
Yeahhhh, I'm not understanding the people on this sub. He trash and almost as bad as Freddy but at the same time is unfair and has no counter play. Maybe they are talking about legion with franks mixtape
---
but the devs are finally shipping the nurse and the wraith...
---
Wait, what?
---
If they DC by closing the game, yeah, the add-ons aren't consumed.
---
SOSHSHSHDHDHE LMAOOOOO
---
Thankyou so much man, will give it a go! 
---
Any response to the other top post outing you for tracing?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/adwyik/comment/edkvuak?st=JQPDKCR2&amp;sh=3e2545eb
---
Not if I down vote him.
---
Can i ask why you feel this way?
---
Please explain, I don't have dlc survivors
---
Because survivors are op /s
---
I love seeing idiots get down voted
---
I mean that change was needed. Not downing an injured survivor faster than a healthy one (so healing is not needed at all) is just stupid design. Legion is antifun, but they are not op in any way. 
---
Wow rude
---
after a certain point it is 4200 each level to level up
---
Gnot a gnurse, gnor a legiogn?
---
I'm only survivor rank 13, so you'll have to wait a while before meering me
---
Why not? Everyone misses. I do, my teammates do, every good player does. I imagine we're all used to missing them by now. It's not a big deal.
---
Just don't gen tap.
---
She'll become an even stealthier myers since she's 115% and is short with M&amp;A making her TR 16m. Bad idea.
---
The full premium outfits are 1k + auric cells which is around 10 dollars
---
Quinten is a fucking cutie no matter what.
---
Teaches you the crucial skill, of not respecting pallets ever.
---
That the fact is , if i wasnt on top (which idek how it happened) people wouldn‚Äôt have tried to discredit me. I mean doing something fairly accurate or realistic digitally gets a bad rep because of how people assume it can be traced so easily . But I‚Äôm still uploading the full thing and just let the man get some upvotes from my art üëçüèΩits all love 
---
With the share button you can save as screenshot. After copy it to a USB device. It's annoying but it beats doing it with a phone camera
---
Sure, if you can land it. 
---
I just get a little bit more ticked off when people miss during the down time. Like please, put all your concentration into it.
---
I mean the point of this post was to also figure out why people do that, so thank you for informing me.
---
Go for it üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
---
You've been exposed as a tracer
---
hit or miss
---
Give Freddy wavedashing
---
Salt.
---
Freddy I at least get what they were going for. He isn't fun to play against because he is either invisible or has permanent wall hacks for you, in either case, ther eisn't a lot you can do to escape him except hope he has better stuff to do than go for you. But Legion, I don't even kno what they were going for. Making a killer that essentially nullifies the core mechanic of intrest in the game, the chase just seems like a terrible idea on the face of it.
---
I DONT CARE WHAT THE FUCK ANYONE SAYS.
---
# QUENTIN IS A GODDAMN CUTIE!
---
REFERENCE BTW
---
I‚Äôve only ever gotten a single successful blind with a flashlight
---
It's funny because all of your other art posts look like clear copies of poses or not the same "sketchy style" so I mean you do you. But don't claim original work if it's traced my dude. 
---
At this point it ain't even a secret anymore
---
This.. The description is a Wendigo, my dude. You made a Wendigo.
---
Yo relax. Jesus u sound like a little bitch. It might be a bug. Smh Jesus Christ. 
---
Same with other things as well it‚Äôs annoying 
---
Got a boyfriend , bet he doesn‚Äôt KISS YA . But is exposed and a claim the same thing ? Youre more than welcome to view my other art tho :) it needs the love 
---
AND IF THEY HAVE A SHIT PING DON'T READY UP
---
yeah they'd be great if they weren't traced
---
yo.
---
Yes but if you shock someone than hit them, you get Deviousness BP.
---
If you throw bottle at Survivor than hit them, you gain Deviousness BP.
---
Wraith gains BP for hitting a Survivor after coming out of stealth and so should The Pig for reasons I've already discussed.
---
This is to distract you from a weak mid chapter patch. At least we got some number changes, finally, to some legacy perks?
---
YES, I HAVE HAD MOMENTS OF PLAYING HUNTRESS AND THE SURVIVOR LAGGED AHEAD CAUSING ME TO MISS. BUT IT REALLY ISN'T HARD TO KNOW WHAT YOUR INTERNET SPEED IS AS WELL AS WAYS TO IMPROVE IT. ITS BEEN SUCH A GRIPE OF MINE SINCE I STARTED PLAYING THIS GAME PROPERLY LAST YEAR. ITS ANNOYING AND FRUSTRATES ME TO HAVE ANY AND ALL SKILL THROWN OUT THE WINDOW BECAUSE SOME KILLER HAS HIS FINGER UP HIS ASS AND THINKS HE'S BETTER THEN ME ALL BECAUSE I LAGGED TO SHIT.
---
Oh wow, I‚Äôm such a terrible person for going after the person already injured. Survivors just complain too much
---
Yeah , im using the promotional art for each killer as reference (except for a few ) 
---
you're tracing, not referencing.
---
and lipstick!
---
The devs did say they'd look into the shipping of the nurse and wraith; but these are probably the best skins for these two killers yet.
---
Like the DS nerf they suspiciously stopped talking about it. 
---
TECHNICALLY they said the Freddy re-work is due in winter. So, TECHNICALLY, they have 2 and a half months left since the first day of Spring for 2019 is March 20th. 
---
That‚Äôs why I said I‚Äôm fine with refs because every artist uses them, but tracing over a picture isn‚Äôt using a reference, it‚Äôs tracing. There‚Äôs a huge difference and i think charging people for art that you‚Äôve just traced is wrong. If you‚Äôre doing it for fun, then it‚Äôs all good, but deciding that you‚Äôre gonna sell prints or whatever when it‚Äôs traced art of someone else‚Äôs art/work is wrong. 
---
When you go save your friend and another homie gets downed by NOED. 
---
Im sure others agree with you , i dont mind speculation tho :) 
---
So, more changes that balance the game based on SWF at the expense of solo survivors? If I play solo, get found and am curious how it happened, I have to sit through 10-20 minutes of nothing just to see if their perks factored in? 
---
If they can't restrict this to SWF only, then it shouldn't be implemented. 
---
Remembering Bricky and his case files. 
---
They were really decent
---
[jimmy on the right originally has that opacity](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1149896-nut-button) 
---
I don't know if it is just me, but the terror radius music is overwhelmingly loud. Like, *actually* ear damaging. I can't play survivor with normal sound settings in PTB.
---
I thought he only got slowdown if he actually tagged someone
---
2 things:
---
1) Love this meme
---
2) It hurts cause it is true
---
I would also like a link to that image pls
---
Ok?
---
[here ya go](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1149896-nut-button) 
---
Found the preteen
---
yeah i am on PC :) 
---
You grabbed that Claudette by the butt crack
---
So like two of my posts are jojo themed ? If thats what youre referring to when you say copied poses . And ive also been displaying different variety of styles from all my post . The ‚Äúsketchy style‚Äù is something i do alot irl when drawing realism with a pen 
---
I kinda don't have issues with SWF, with them half of the time being really stupid. But I'd take more bp anytime
---
Some solo players also communicate post game via friwnd request and so on, because of this is why bhvr probably implemented it for everybody. I agree with you it sucks foe real solo players, maybe they can add a match history menu in game so you can check later what happened?
---
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO FIND A GOOD MATCH? I SPENT 20 MINUTES FINDING ONE GAME. 
---
It's a pretty weak mid chapter patch :/ at least we finally got sole number changes on legacy perks. FeelsLegacyMan. 
---
r/Tendies
---
Hard to pinpoint but for the most part pre 2.0.0
---
&gt; i think charging people for art that you‚Äôve just traced is wrong. [...] but deciding that you‚Äôre gonna sell prints or whatever when it‚Äôs traced art of someone else‚Äôs art/work is wrong.   
---
Oh yeah, absolutely.
---
Typically when you trace, you divulge it upfront to avoid people thinking your work wasnt traced. Tracing is totally acceptable, just dont on it that crucial part about your drawing. The "sketchy" style you speak of would be infinitely worse looking without the actually drawing to guide the artist. If they weren't willing to freehand it but glad to lie, why should I give benefit of the doubt?
---
Uncrouching is NOT using Pig's power.
---
The results were taken after the event had ended, so Blight was not included.
---
Never saw them confirm either way whether DC's were included, but in the past they've left them out.
---
I personally think the kill rate of bottom tier killers would fall drastically if NOED was taken out of the equation.
---
how does Michael Meyers play?
---
Yeah at least with Freddy you at least have a chance to pallet loop and vault, Legion pretty much negates all of that. Which sounds cool in theory but in actuality it sucks. 
---
I don't get Legion at all. He's considered one of the weakest, but people also dc at the possibility of facing him - what?
---
Exactly. Either you get no kills and it‚Äôs you suck and they ‚Äúalmost feel bad for you‚Äù or you get literally a single kill at all and you‚Äôre ‚Äúnoob killer and tunnel‚Äù
---
I played against leatherface for the first time the other night. He was garbage and the only reason he got me was because when I dropped the pallet it put me on the wrong side
---
Totally. I was thrown off at the start of course, but in the second half of my invisible pallets game I landed tons of hits I wouldn't normally have landed. Formative experience, really changed how I play.
---
Whats really funny is just because i was top voted some how has brought speculation to my authenticity. I cant claim original work as i use reference already, but the whole tracing thing now seems like spite  
---
Remember when the devs wanted to make it just a button press? This is exactly what people were going to do with it.
---
I'm happy that with only about 2 weeks playing this on PC i can effectively play killer against difficult odds while still getting used to the controls and adjusting my bindings.
---
I just wanted to revel in my victory and share it with those who might understand the struggle.
---
Holy heck those are so good
---
Disagree. High rank solo is mostly fine, low rank does suck.
---
For me its never been about healing though. I adapted.
---
Its lazy killers camping/tunneling, and the group falling victim to it.
---
They should test our kindred as baseline, thats what everyone has been asking for.
---
OH MY GOD I HATE THE NEW SELFCARE CHANGES THEY REWARD THE PLAYERS WHO GO OFF ON THEIR OWN AND SELFCARE RATHER THAN HELP THEIR TEAM! 
---
ITS NOT EVEN PERSONAL, I'M A KILLER, I BENEFIT FROM THIS AND I HATE THIS!
---
I can 100% do that ( it seems alot of people want a video of me drawing for other reasons lol ) but tutorials sounds like a great idea . I‚Äôll have to post to another sub tho 
---
That was funny af
---
weird choice of perks, but okay 
---
LOL IT'S LIKE YOU ALMOST GET IT BUT NOT QUITE
---
No one was arguing it wasn't? Not sure why you needed to make this comment.
---
I think you should identify which teachable perks you'd like for other killers and acquire those; then level your favored killer or survivor.
---
If a character has no teachables you value, then by all means skip them; more teachables known means bloodwebs are more cluttered and it may take longer to kit out the perks you want.
---
Likely they did it to keep the flashlight.
---
Some do it to deny the bbq point multiplier too.
---
&gt; You dodging swf lobbies doesn't make you better at the game. It in fact does the complete opposite. 
---
1) I don‚Äôt dodge lobbies but I understand why people do. 2) I doubt that the kind of person who immediately dodges any SWF lobby has any interest in whether they‚Äôre good or not, they probably just want to play the game casually. 3) This will be a moot point before long as Behaviour changes the matchmaking system so that all survivors join at the same time. 
---
&gt; It takes absolutely no skill, counter play or a thought process to beat up solo queue players on ps4.
---
I play solo most of the time and escape plenty often. I know it‚Äôs popular to assume that all PS4 solo players are complete ass, but it‚Äôs just not true in my experience. 
---
&gt; There are so many boosted red rank killers on ps4 It's becoming sad. The few times they don't dodge the lobby they get walked all over and then facecamp the 1st person they down.
---
Sounds like you should be glad they‚Äôre dodging you if this is the case, that doesn‚Äôt sound like a fun game experience for you or them. Boosted trash killers can go and play garbage solo survivors. I don‚Äôt see the problem. 
---
Ranking up isn‚Äôt hard, probably boosted to rank 10 
---
Hey OP, you wanna explain why you're talking about selling posters and prints of traced over art? I'm surprised the mods havent done anything yet.
---
Another person that clearly can‚Äôt read. I never once said the game is hard. Show me where I said the game is hard? The game NEEDS a casual mode for new players to learn the ropes and get the basics down before being thrown into a match with players that are really good. I‚Äôm not saying all high ranks are good, but their are some that are god tier which in turn makes the game unenjoyable for beginning players 
---
Yeah, as soon as I hit like rank 6 or 7, I tend to call it on killer and swap to survivor until reset. Red rank survivors suck to play against and are no fun to me, lol. 
---
It's not DS that makes people cocky :D
---
The legion is by far the least fun killer to play against. Zero chance you ever get away, can't loop, can't do anything but wait and get downed.
---
Plunder's Instinct to see chests. Ace in the Hole (I think) for nice add-ons to flex on my friend that doesnt have ace [my offerings were best offerings], pharmacy to quickly and quietly open chests if the killer hadn't seen the basement stash yet, then bond just because I love bond. 
---
THANK YOUU
---
Leader is the only perk I don‚Äôt have as a teachable in the entire game pls shrine work with me 
---
It would be borderline meaningless. I say borderline because there's some edge cases where a survivor might struggle out of a killer's grasp on their way to their final death hook as a lone survivor, that this would remove.
---
I could take it or leave it since that particular instance probably rarely happens.
---
*"Her power is not a stealth"*
---
Bruh it‚Äôs annoying to me when I play Myers bc sometimes I accidentally tier up when I don‚Äôt want to bc of it
---
Stop spawning survivors up hex totems asses
---
Easier per match.  Harder per minute.
---
noed is only there for the movement speed, enduring for decisive, unrelenting for hatch standoffs, iron grasp just because.
---
so yeah very situational but it works quite well for me, Billy is more about add-ons (although he doesn't rely heavily on them) than anything else. 
---
Holy moly the background for the spirit one would look siiiiick as a map, specially with the new engine
---
Huh. Well I just go do something else while they're dicking around if I've already gotten to that point. Might as well go AFK. If they're staying, at least I'm wasting their time.
---
then you should see adam with his black coat skin. that shit's not fair xD but ah well i am the one playing it
---
HOW DARE YOU ASSUME I KNOW WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN QUENTIN DIES, QUENTIN IS AN IMMORTAL BEING WITH SUCH AN ADVANCED BRAIN THAT HE USES SO MUCH ENERGY HE FREQUENTLY NEEDS TO REST.
---
I might be slightly biased after seeing this post but his other art isn't that good to think he can do this without tracing imo.
---
if he did this without tracing i think you'd have to have some serious skill/talent and it just doesn't seem like it looking at the other art
---
https://i.redd.it/efr2pv3xj9721.jpg
---
why dont you post a video of you doing the next 4 or so killers without tracing and then no one can doubt anything
---
It really wouldn't give the Killer a real strategic advantage but I guess that's cool.
---
Thank you. 
---
My entire point was I don't find flashlights toxic at all
---
Ahhhh thanks mate. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what the difference was but that makes complete sense. I see why the syringe is better now
---
If you got the killer to chase you, it wasn't that bad a facecamp. Still pretty funny though.
---
weak ass throw. 
---
Already drawn them , but ill redo a few just to ease everything 
---
Nice work. Looks like the streamer friend was probably playing tourist for his friends that don't play DBD as much.
---
Personally I find Billy to be a bit too situational for my tastes. What map was this?
---
rage
---
Yikes, solo queing survivor on Xbox will be even more solo now. I expect people to just not heal each other with that change
---
I don't know, all of the games I played against Legion ended up with everyone leaving through the gate. Then again, I'm still in yellow ranks, so...
---
Interesting
---
And tracing 
---
This would be like reporting someone for shooting you in Call of Duty.  Not sure why they think threatening to report you will do anything to you emotionally or judicially.
---
Not if I make alts and downvote him, but effort
---
As in Kindred becomes a default feature? I don't even think it needs to go that far, any form of in-game communication would suffice as far as I'm concerned. Regardless, this game will always suffer relative to the gap between SWF and solo, and there is one even at rank 1.
---
Because i have original art in this same style that isnt dbd that id be glad to share ( but seeing as how this is a dbd sub reddit i post dbd art) also because a few people simply asked for it . My prints would be of a more fleshed drawing but utilizing this style still. ALSO because mods would have to be going off speculation . 
---
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GOING TO TELL ME QUENTIN AIN'T CUTE WHEN HE GOES DOWN?! FENG IS GOD DAMN ADORABLE BUT LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT GOD DAMN IT!
---
owo
---
It is kind of meaningless, but I rather enjoy getting a mori. Like I said, it is a minor buff such as if the last survivor has decisive strike or the killer ha sbeen playing against a sabateur squad and there isn't any hooks left, but those are rare edge cases. A mori is a lot more satisfying than a sacrifice though, so I just think it would be a nice ending. for the entity to reward a very successful trial to the killer by letting them do the last person personally.
---
Thompson house on coldwind farms, i have found a path where i can circle the map on almost every coldwind farm without stopping my chainsaw as long as i have these add-ons. It's great for patrolling gens and sniping people from across the map.
---
Hmm , i would say just stick to practicing üëçüèΩ
---
only cucks and pussies use noed. change my mind
---
But taking on multiple survivors is the game. Griefing one guy isn‚Äôt gonna win the match which means the other 3 are the counterplay
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC_pbzXn3YM
---
The lack of strategic advantage is kind of why I think it would be a nice change. There is a minor buff in case there is a decisive strike or rare case o there just being no hooks but it is fringe enough that it wouldn't hurt many people.
---
Bill is big so he's easier to see but other than that everything's the same.
---
It's a shame he can't at least have different hats. I hear Valve likes those haha
---
you dont really need more Speed on billy lol.
---
You can waste ds early in the game or just juggle it.
---
How does unrelenting help with hatches?
---
Yeah it looked off to me as well, but I couldn't figure out why. Guess this explains why it had that unsettling and too clean appearance
---
XD i havent played earthworm jim in YEARS!! 
---
I am by no means a top class killer I like to play survivor, and I had a daily for 3 chainsaws and chase for 3 mins with Billy.
---
I wasn't trying to kill them I just wanted my dailies done.
---
I mean no one uses Cypress Mento Mori so it really doesn't matter either way.
---
Expectation: insidious leatherface basement ez downz
---
Realty: Survivor runs kindred. 
---
I think Ranchor should be baseline to balance end game, exposed and mori. 
---
Shhhhh. Don‚Äôt tell anyone that
---
because they‚Äôre shit
---
This is true joy 
---
The twoshot at injured status works **exclusively** if you combine two specific purple addons. Why do people pretend and circlejerk this would now happen every single game?
---
To be fair, Legion's speed is 120% I think. It isn't that fast, only 5% faster than most killer's standard. But that 5% is enough to make escaping if they use it in fairly close proximity impossible unless you can time a pallet drop.
---
THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO CONNECT TO ME FROM VERY FAR AWAY AND READY UP DESPITE HAVING LIKE 300 PING. YOU COULD HAVE AVOIDED PLAYING AGAINST ME WITH THAT PING, DONT TRY TO BLAME ME FOR YOUR LAZINESS!
---
He‚Äôs bad because he can get a guaranteed down but it takes a long time. Legion has no counter play because you can‚Äôt escape unless legion lets you go. You‚Äôre going to get downed eventually, you have no chance. He‚Äôs weird to describe.
---
Does this confirm Nurse is a canon redhead? Cause I don‚Äôt think any of her other skins had hair. 
---
I haven't read trough the addons since I'm not femiliar with them, but there are 2 things I have to say: I think the theme song idea and I don't like the trap death idea. The team song doesn't need explaining I think, but I feel like a survivor dying because of a reverse trap shouldn't have their own icon in the HUD. I also don't like the idea of survivors dying because of bear traps dissapearing. I like them to stay where they were when they died. Yes their face isn't misformed, but I hate it when bodies just dissapear.
---
Everyone did, but the killer was just messing around. He was a lovely guy 
---
Glad to be of service young lag
---
broken key is the definition of useless, maps already have multiple uses without addons
---
WHY ARE THEY FORCING US TO HEAL VS LEGION, THIS IS SO STUPID. YOU CAN GO DOWN ALMOST INSTANTLY IF YOU DONT HEAL AGAINST SOMEONE THAT IGNORES HEALTH STATES.
---
[special for you my dude :)](https://youtu.be/gGaD2g3esYo?t=365)
---
If you really gotta do it put like a tiny smiley face sticker on the center of your screen
---
Damn you licencing! Let us have cosmetics for our favorites. 
---
Who cares what she looks like? Is that what you're spending your time in game doing, checking out the hot survivors? lmao Besides, not like you have to run her. Just get her perks and switch to a prettier survivor if that's what you want. 
---
Nah lmao I had wayyyyy worse (from killers tho) this is the only game where I ran into a insta heal/2 torches 
---
Maybe its a shroud of seperation?
---
That isn't necessarily true. Just because it wasn't in the base game, it doesn't mean they had decided it would break the game. You could make the same argument about any of the killers, survivors or perks that were added since the game was created that they weren't in the base game because the devs "just knew it would break the game". Surviving with friends as a feature isn't a bad feature. The problem is that people abuse it with third party software and the devs aren't incentivised to crack down on it because there is such a large group of players doing it that it would be financially damaging for them to do it.
---
Never gonna play Doc so im tempted to get Overcharge since I‚Äôve heard its good. But im also halfway to unlocking a killer for free...
---
She has some rough spots here and there but its part of the charm. What makes her unique, you feel me? 
---
Top 10 anime endings
---
If you play the game enough to get 2k Shards super quickly, then you can 100% level up the free characters. You don't have to play them, you just have to dump them BP into their web for their perks. It is much better to buy a DLC perk you can't get from grinding BP out. Or even just cosmetics. 
---
nea looks like a normal person, what do you expect her to look like a Instagram model?
---
Yeah. Some killers momentum out of control.
---
Exposed is a bit too much. I only suggest cypress mori because it is a more satisfying end to kill a final survivor by your hand compared to just hooking them.
---
The devs themselves said in a semi-recent stream that people playing with their friends may have been intended, but people being on voice comms was not.
---
Almost every popular streamer and tuber have been wanting it and if you pay attention to posts here on the subreddit a big amount of people seem to want it as well. 
---
Legion is a cancer to this game as chases are undeniably the most boring when they are involved and when you choose to not play as a scumbag you are basically providing yourself a death sentence for that match as securing kills the intended way is not particularly a simple task.
---
I‚Äôm sorry your a part of the minority and don‚Äôt realize it.
---
Nice work! How did you learn to trace this good?
---
It doesn't really matter, it is just a satisfaction thing. Hard to argue that a mori isn't more satisfying to use than hooking.
---
Aha! Jokes on you, that's a Cypress Mori and that only works if it's the last survivor!
---
Video games are to please the Male fantasy, remember 
---
mate, I'm killer main. I bitch on other killers who run noed cause it's a pussy move after Curtain Calls unless you run an rp Pig build. killing is much easier than it used to be. swf still dominates, sure, but my team wasn't in one. 
---
It's not spite, someone just finally got suspicious. It really has nothing to do with the front page and your still garnering upvotes from tracing.
---
I really wish there was a soft ban when people quit like that. 
---
Ruin buff is too OP
---
I CANT PLAY A GAME OF NURSE WITHOUT A SURVIVOR LEAVING MID-GAME! AM I TOO GOOD WITH HER OR SOMETHING?! RANK 1 SURVIVORS TOO!! JUST TAKE YOUR LUMPS MEG!
---
Nea got cute outfits tho
---
It's not that you can't survive, it's that he wins chases period, to the point you can't loop him or gain advantage, then once he's stabbed you he's on to the next guy because you gave away eveyone's positions.
---
There is a difference between saying it was not intended and actually taking action to crack down on people doing it. That and you can't really prove people are doing it even if they did make it explicitly against the rules. I mean nobody in the call is going to be reporting themselves, and what is the killer going to do, report for unusual amounts of coordination?
---
&gt; Adjusted the intensity of the Spirit's Phase Walk VFX. The VFX changed due to the update to Unreal Engine 4.20 and the lighting changes introduced in 2.4.0.
---
:D
---
If you want self care on all your survivors, I'd level the survivors only until they get self care, then once every survivor has it, level them for their unique perks. Because the more unique perks you have unlocked, the less likely it is that the perk you actually want to show up will actually show. 
---
I would level hag to 40 before you level any other killers though. Then level other killers for bbq+chili &amp; ruin, since they're both so important. At least this is the way I did things. Up to you whether you want to play it that way.
---
Yeah, I imagine a lot of survivors will assume you just passed them by on the edge of your terror radius, since that happens a lot, so you can probably still surprise a lot of them.
---
Some people just can't be happy when someone tries to be nice
---
Fake end game chat. Every one knows killer can't be toxic!
---
Either way I'm glad they are weakening sfw a little bit. But the survivor mains in the sub don't seem too happy.
---
YALLLL THAT GAVE ME AN IDEA, they should make an updated version of her, and let that be a switchable cosmetic, updated and classic Nea, yes.
---
and trust me, I know what it's like when your ruin gets destroyed within couple seconds in match. tough luck. but not a reason for literally camping the hook, not even proxy camping. when one gen is done.
---
What boat are you on? Because i think I‚Äôm on the same one 
---
Actually the content of the meme is in response to a survivor complaining. Plenty of people argue that, otherwise the meme wouldn't make sense.   
---
"That's how DBD works" is a response to someone complaining about the killer tunneling...  
---
My comment is an elaboration of the meme.
---
Can you link the announcement?  I am at work with limited search capabilities
---
The classic "you cant mention Trump in any form of media, because I say so".
---
They already said (somewhere) that the killer after Legion will be the "oldest" killer in the game
---
as soon as i see the purple noed in the corner of my screen im instantly panicking. 
---
Because they buffed legion by saying;
---
1) If Legion ends frenzy early it doesn't empty the gauge.
---
2) If legion hits an injured person bleed out takes 20 seconds instead of thirty.
---
imo the only toxic ones are the ones that still shit talk when they win or tell me to kms or just generally rude in messages/post game chat, I dont find body blocking, flashlight lighting or tbagging,camping  toxic.
---
Sounds more like it's time for a blackbeard nerd, to me.
---
My brotha
---
I juke him enough to feel ok about it. Gotta time my pallets better so I get the stun rather then just letting him jump over it but it seems to work just fine. I get away with more then I should cuz he can‚Äôt see scratch marks
---
Ahah but really bro you got some talent fam ;)
---
It wouldn't necessarily stop a hatch standoff. injured survivors can still jump in the hatch before the killer is able to pick them up if they are downed.
---
That's too petty no way do people still do that
---
What happened? I havent seen anything about this yet
---
I like the outfit but WTF is that hair LMAOOO she used too much hair spray on top it seems
---
That plug isnt as sneaky as scratched mirror Myers
---
Oh wow hahaha
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/40632/moonrise-lunar-new-year-event-announcement 
---
To be fair, won is a kind of nebulous and self assigned thing. A lot of killers don't consider it a victory unless they get a 4k.
---
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GOING TO TELL ME QUENTIN EVEN HAS THE CAPABILITY OF A MORTAL DEATH LIKE SOME KIND OF FUCKING HUMAN.  EVEN IF A TRUE QUENTIN COULD DIE; THE ENERGY RELEASED COULD CREATE A CATASTROPHIC SINGULARITY, NO ONE WOULD BE ALIVE TO HEAR HOW BEAUTIFUL IT MIGHT BE!
---
Yes I can, and I think that Nea &gt; Kate.
---
You're not really supposed to tunnel as him though, his correct / optimal playstyle is similar to the legion. The legion does it 10x better though.
---
Thanks! 
---
I was toxic asf last night, guy urban evades to hold the game hostage for a while, finally find him, down him after having a hard time seeing him cause he was claudette with iron will, get DSd. Damn ok get mori'd, then i load into 2 more games in a row with the same Claudette, mori her both times on purpose, i felt like a supervillain when her swf friends tried everything to save her, but she met the same fate. Like when Thanos slowly walked to vision and all the heroes tried slowing him down, poor vision, poor claudette.
---
I just want her to have normal eyebrows, not some Trixie Mattel stuff.  Maybe a mouth that's a bit less wide, but even eyebrow stuff would be enough
---
I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING THE BITCHING ABOUT DS AND NOED! STFU ALREADY AND JUST LET PEOPLE PLAY HOW THEY WANT!!!
---
OKAY COOL I'M NOT ALONE THANK YOU
---
Huh, interesting. Thanks for the insight!
---
I'm expecting the Freddy rework closer to the dedicated servers tbh and definitely not before the next chapter. Unless they've either been working on it for a while and are just cleaning it up or they've rushed it so much it will be trash anyway, it's not likely to be done soon unfortunately. I just want more people to play him since I went over a month without seeing a single one even at a mixture of yellow and green ranks. 
---
This was beautiful, I wish I could have teammates like you üò≠
---
It is part of the narrative. Why is he patrolling around the hook or "camping"?  It is because he knows that the survivors are nearby due to them having blocked the carry to the hook, or been hiding around a corner waiting for a flashlight save.
---
yo Franks kinda hot. I‚Äôll see myself out ;(
---
I agree with you in the case of hatch standoffs. People willing to wait 15-20 minutes for the other person to give up a hatch standoff are ridiculous. Whether killer or survivor, I just give it up and let the other person win because it isn't worth my time. But I am still going to go for a 4k as a killer. Sometimes that means slugging sometimes. My goal is to get 4 kills, not 3. I consider a 3 a win, but I am still aiming for 4.
---
Yeah I don't tunnel in the slightest but a lot of Freddys do because they're desperate for at least one kill. 
---
# QUENTIN MAINS RISE UP!
---
Just want to wobble that belly like a bowl full of jelly.
---
He gets it, my life playing legion 
---
do you know which stream, by chance?
---
I use shards exclusively for the extra 150k BP. Is it a good value based on time invested? No. But if I want a cosmetic I will just buy it. You can‚Äôt buy bloodpoints and you can‚Äôt buy time, so buying a perk I own just saves me time from playing the 3 killer games or so that it would take me to earn it.
---
yes, you get an infinite number of blood webs after lvl50.
---
True. That's misinformation though, they don't really know how to play him. But even when playing him correctly he struggles soo
---
Just put Ruin in already so I don't have to buy and play Hag ._.
---
Yeah but I still want to see Freddy lmao
---
The fact that it has a period of staying for 15 seconds is a pretty good while for a gate, and didn't they buff the sticking period to 30 seconds?
---
&gt;-Survivor main P3 Claudette with DS, Adrenaline, Dead Hard and BT.
---
&gt;&gt;-Uses Death Note OST in background to increase his edgyness.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;-Tries to consistently maintain rank 1 as surv and only uses rare/ultra rare add-ons with swf
---
I'm literally none of those things and were talking about killers dealing with DS not...what ever crap that was.
---
And if you think that the majority of this sub and the player-base as a whole are good then you're lying to yourself because not only is that extremely statistically unlikely it's also anecdotally untrue for everyone who has ever played this game.
---
Unless this is literally the first game where the bulk of the population is really good at it in which case that's amazing, guess everyone is just really good and it's the perks that are wrong.
---
&gt;The person trying to talk to you
---
They weren't trying to have a conversation. You can't have conversations with walls.
---
&gt;that DS is not a well designed balanced perk, just like NOED
---
&gt;&gt;If a perk is designed to have no real counter nor playstyle around it, then it's pretty badly designed.
---
The counter-play and playstyle around NOED is do totems, if you have a hard time there's a perk for it. And if you can't do that then it's called leave the match when you get the gates open rather than staying in and mucking about.
---
That's the real counter-play that people literally refuse to do and say they refuse to do it while still complaining about NOED.
---
The current counter-play to DS that people also are refusing to do and choose to just complain is to either eat the DS near the beginning of the match or to herd them towards hooks and juggle them if need be. Now, is that as legitimate of a counter-play as finding totems, possibly with a perk, I'd say no but it's what we have and it works fine.
---
Then again, you said that DS is literally the strongest perk in the game when the much better perk "Adrenalin" exists so that tells me exactly what type of person you are.
---
You're the type that gets triggered because you got DSed, aren't ya?
---
Do you mean deliberately tunnelling a specific survivor once you have hooked them the first time doesn't automatically make you a noob killer? 
---
No it doesn't. But that wasn't said. Vegan simply said "this is how noob killers work".
---
But I would add, "this is how complete wankers play".
---
It is much weaker than I expected, however, the changes are no less welcomed. I love hiding the killer load out, the momentum after vaults, the perk buffs, and bug fixes. 
---
To be fair,like 90% of Melee's roster is trash so they would have worked too.
---
Yeah that's the point, he's not a killer people can pick up easily since nobody really wants to learn his play style when he has such a bad reputation. Unlike Nurse and Billy who take time to properly learn, at least they have good results. 
---
I feel you hear. I made a similar post a few days ago and got some salt for it.
---
I mostly play killer but I play survivor too, otherwise its just like playing only half a game. 
---
You are probably like me and a nice killer. Y'know like, giving the hatch sometimes or taking it easy on a survivor when half there team or more DC. 
---
Regular gameplay with sabotage hooks, flashlights, body blocking are totally legitimate strategies. However, there's strategy and then there is being a dick to to be a dick.
---
As a killer its dick to just tunnel right of the get go. A little tunneling is ok I'd say halfway through match if your really struggling. Facecamping is super fucked obviously. This isn't fun to do, but then survivors body blocking the first hook and then the rest is dick. 
---
Swf already has a huge advantage over the killer let alone god tier flashlights, tool boxes, and then using comms to help bodyblock and sabo hooks right in front of the killer. 
---
Then sending messages if you get even one kill on them with a bunch of hate and "KYS"
---
My advice is to just ignore them, unless you can change your message setting to private or something. 
---
Play how you want to Play, just try not to be a dick unless the survivors are being dicks.
---
We, as a community, should want to attract more players and being toxic assholes wont do that.
---
It would be cool to get into the pro circuit yknow?
---
But Huntress wanna be Pig too!
---
The Jimmy Meg lol
---
I've never had this happen to me in my 300+ hours, but understandable.
---
Why did you make this?
---
The vault changes are really nice, although I have noticed I still get hit since the medium vault ends you really close to the window. Either way it was overdue and welcome 
---
A map more focused on hiding isn't much an issue to me. Besides, more variations would increase the chances of a better type of it. Macmillan maps have some pretty good variation despite the same theme.
---
Are you dumb or just stupid? You had to play an absolute MINIMUM of 43 matches, double-pip every single game without a 1 pip, safety or down pip, to even get to rank 1. Now you tell me how that is not more EXPERIENCED than someone who just installed the game, never played a match, sitting at rank 20, and that your ranks aren't different.
---
I don't know if we're reading the same patch notes here but there was not much balance content at all. Quality of life, sure. Balance, no. 
---
That is pretty spiteful. They are the worst kind of person to play with. I mean, you got 3 people beaten, don't quit and give up your reward just because the last person is getting out.
---
That said, it might not be out of spite, it might have been a person trying to deranks. Playing the game out and then quitting at the end so that survivors get the build of their points, but the killer still goes down a pip. Still a dick move though.
---
... copying the official art is ...
---
There's no reason for it to be a bug. The devs must have specifically changed the movement speed when he holds his power out because there's no other reason it would have been magically changed. He's being reworked anyway so they wouldn't have leaked a tiny part of it beforehand. 
---
I guess alot of ppl believe they are not worthy of the blessing then ;) lol
---
why do you understand when you say ling ling? there is no survivor named ling ling.
---
I'VE BEEN A QUENTIN MAIN SINCE HE CAME OUT. I'VE SPENT EIGHT MILLION BLOODPOINTS ON HIM IN A SINGLE SITTING WHEN THE CLOWN CAME OUT. I'VE KEPT HIM UP TO DATE WITH EVERY PERK IN THE GAME SINCE HE CAME OUT.  MY TRUE QUENTIN IS MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE.
---
I can too, under the right circumstances. But you gotta *really* care about those extremely important, life changing 150 blood points then...
---
Please read again. Jesus. 
---
Legion is factually weak and it takes quite a biased idiot to claim they are not. Their design is utterly broken and anti fun, but they are everything but strong. This however changes completely if they play with Franks mixtape. Thus the logical reasoning would be to nerf that pure cancer addon.  
---
Next up would be a change to the moonwalking shit. What should one do there? Well, make it so that Legion doesn't remove "current meter" by hitting survivors, but instead "removes maximum meter". Thus moonwalking just wastes time and they have to land maximum number of hits anyway.  
---
&gt; this is the new next thing  
---
It's not because its not possible to run the same 2 specific purple addons every single game.  
---
&gt; everyone is loaded up due to the winter event.  
---
This isn't an argument. It doesn't have to do anything with the killer.  
---
&gt; Even then every legion at high ranks only runs good add one  
---
Every killer in this game at high rank only runs good add ons. This also is no argument.  
---
LMAO bc that's what we call her. Go ahead and get triggered like a snowflake 
---
Ultimate Huntress Guide is actually just a no-scope montage
---
I'M SORRY!
---
At least now Legion no longer loses his power after canceling it manually next it should be his vault distance 
---
adjusting so that there is incentive to actually heal is good. frank's needs to be ultra rare tho
---
FUCK YOU QUENTIN WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU TAKING ME OFF THE HOOK IF LEATHERFACE IS SO CLOSE HE CAN SEE YOUR BACKNE YOU DENSE FUCKING FLOORBOARD?
---
Play some more
---
ME TOO HE IS MY FAVORITE KILLER TO GO UP AGAINST ASIDE FROM NURSE!
---
I‚Äôm just surprised franks was untouched tbh 
---
I dunno then dude, then they broke repair speed with multiple survivors. Pretty sure they only meant it will not stack on one person. Everybody gets their own bonus according to the description
---
Aha, you definitely aren‚Äôt an experienced player. My upvotes say otherwise ;)
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES MICHAEL NOT HAVE A FUCKING NEON PINK JUMPSUIT COSMETIC WITH FUCKING 'JUICY' BEDAZZLED ON THE ASS OF SAID JUMPSUIT IN FAKE DIAMONDS. I WOULD PAY REAL FUCKING MONEY FOR THIS BHVR, THERE IS NO FUCKING EXCUSE, I WOULD SETTLE FOR DAVID WITH A PINK TRACKSUIT THAT SAYS 'JUICY'
---
*Selfish high rank
---
Preach that Rank 15 wisdom dude. 
---
Might just choose some kind of tutorial sub , and i‚Äôll let you know when i post them üëçüèΩ
---
On the PTB. Should be live in about 2 weeks.
---
That's how mafia works
---
You don‚Äôt need to play him to level him. 
---
(Unless you have to buy him then go ahead)
---
Calling people names is really mature
---
They only keep extra frenzy when manually ending the Frenzy. That means the only time they save some of their bar is when they run somewhere without hitting shit. If they hit someone that is in Deep Wound there Frenzy is depleted the same as before. Thus it is merely a slight QOL buff that isn't even remotely meaningful.
---
Yeah I thought it was leather face's but I wasn't sure because I haven't really heard anyone talking about leather face whilst I've heard quite a few people as for a billy nerf. I do agree that LF could do with some changes though.
---
Yea for sure, I just mean it can be annoying if they get the hatch only because they have DS.
---
LMAO! Exactly.
---
I didnt even say the game is hard. I said  "if you have friends it really isnt hard". As in reference to playing KYF. Not to the game. Rank 15-20 IS beginner bracket. That's for players to learn how to play before moving up. Is the matchmaking an issue? Yes. Its unfortunate people get mismatches with higher level killer. But part on that, from what I read, is that you, a higher level, are playing with your low level friends. You are throwing the whole search outta whack. Even if the game solely searches based on your friends lower level, is it fair/fun for a beginner killer to get bullied by you? Also man, we all have different opinions.  You want a casual mode? Personally I say just go play KYF with your friends. You dont need to divide a small community, even smaller. Just cause we dont agree with your OPINION doesnt mean we cant read or we are wrong.
---
So you hit once, then manually end, Joey's mixtape lowers the cooldown to what a normal hit is, and you hit them again to two shot someone who you shouldn't be, and you have frenzy gauge to do it again.
---
I wish the team I was playing last night felt that way I was trying to get the trophy for killing 4 people while in tier 3 so I was running a tuft of hair and an ebony as soon as I get 1 kill they all dc 
---
Sure...
---
Yeah, very true. I love playing Freddy. Luckily for me I don't play to win (I always 2 hook and then don't kill the survivors I just slug the ones who are dead on hook) so winning isn't an issue for me. But for people who play killer properly, I feel for them.
---
Lmfao NOED on Billy with double turning addons. No idea why you posted this garbage, I'd be embarrassed if I were you. 
---
Yea it can occasionally work out, but at higher ranks survivors will just punish you for not taking advantage of their mistakes. They'll even punish you for being "a nice killer." You can get good points for a 0K game, but you ALWAYS get good points for a 3-4K game.
---
It's also not "fair" for you a rank 7 to play against a rank 18-20 killer. They may have ZERO experience as well while you, a Rank 7, can literally coach and loop your team to victory since you play with your rank 18-20 friends.
---
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference etc etc
---
idk if this is a mistake but on the patch notes in game it says the 20 sec change was going to live and the blur effect might not, not sure which is true but I'm guessing the in game ones are (the blur being the one that might not make it makes more sense)
---
&gt;	you only get the same killer when you just played against them because you‚Äôre queueing at the same time
---
You're right about that. But since the pool of players is a lot smaller at low ranks, it doesn't help. I saw Boxghostz yesterday play the same boosted facecamping doc for 4 games in a row. The pool of players that play enough to get to red ranks is not very high. 
---
&gt;	High ping lobbies are NOT only at high ranks.
---
If there's no open killer lobbies in your region, the game will throw you in a red rank killer lobby in another region. Since there's less killers at high ranks, you're more likely to get thrown in a lobby that isn't in your region. 
---
&gt;	I only play DBD at night and there‚Äôs about as many people that play at night as in the day. Look At Stream Charts
---
Are you taking your region into account? Surely the playerbase in your region dips dramatically as it turns to AM, as that's when most people sleep. Steam will still show lots of active players, but theyre in other regions since its daytime for them.
---
&gt;	Rank may not be as great of an indicator for survivor but for killer it‚Äôs a little more accurate.
---
Okay i have to absolutely disagree with you here. Killers are still boosted as fuck at high ranks, with the only exception normally Nurse. If youre using Nurse in high ranks, youre usually a pretty capable nurse. But Legion still can double pio without actually any kills. Survivors at high ranks are just as 4head at high ranks as lower ranks, so its easy to get kills still. I play against *a lot* of bad killers at high ranks. 
---
&gt;	that doesn‚Äôt mean low rank killers are as good at high ranks
---
Again, I dont agree. I still see the same quality of killers across all ranks. Im not sure your qualifications of what makes a killer a good killer, but it clearly doesnt align with mine and many others. Killers are still boosted at high ranks. 
---
OhTofu is actually going to talk about this in his podcast today, it should be a pretty good podcast.
---
It‚Äôs a lack of killers. It‚Äôs not as bad on pc but with all the issues and consoles having like 7 FPS no one wants to play killer anymore
---
Not bad some of these are pretty good ideas.
---
Um, I did chase them...right back to their failed unhook attempts.
---
You know that a COOLDOWN is not a wipe animation/stun animation? Cooldown refers to how fast the bar of the ability refills to full. So what actually happens:  
---
1.) Frenzy Hit  
---
2.) You stop  
---
3.) Your ability bar is full (the same with or without Joeys tape)  
---
4.) Survivor is at deep wounds with a full deep wound bar
---
You forgot the /s
---
Claudette's obviously just going to bash the killer's head open with her purple flashlight, duh.
---
Stream #111
---
oof, how you gonna do me like that :(
---
Delightfully devilish, Seymour.
---
I'm a solo survivor main, the answer is yes. Just cleanse totems when you see them. It's really not as overpowered as you're all trying to make it sound. Yes, it's annoying as FUCK and a huge crutch for bad killers, but it has a hard counter.
---
I PHYSICALLY CANNOT GET GOOD AT SPIRIT 
---
They usually just can't be bothered watching the animation because they're annoyed
---
Teachable yes. To use on her no.
---
Teabagging is toxic and flashlight clicking is toxic. They're how you say "gg ez bb Killer KYS"during a match.
---
or is it more apt to say....its all a bad dream....haha
---
I do that. what is wrong with it? it doesn't take much time either. 
---
the buff was unnecessary but there's nothing to nerf unless we speak of reversing it to previous state where you needed tier 3 to instadown. as much as I look down at my fellow killer mains for using it, as survivor I couldn't care less. it's free points. 
---
Going by the Chinese calendar, it isn't the year of the pig until 5th Feb 2019. 
---
In reference to the LMAO response to your server question, there are no servers right now. The Killer hosts the match. 
---
Can't really say much about the population, but I watch a few EU streamers that mainly play DBD and they don't seem to have any trouble finding matches during their typical peak hours.
---
People are downvoting cos this guy traced the art
---
Dang, this is very useful, thanks a ton!
---
&gt; hehe, I'm not chasing you because I'm facing down
---
I wishhhhh I had you allllll alone, just the two of us...
---
I second that.
---
Oh man, true af. Get so many killers who tunnel hooked survivors all game and they just say "it's the most efficient way to win, why would I chase an injured survivor instead". The only reason they're saying that is because they don't play survivor and don't know how it feels to be on the recieving end. Pretty sure they'd try to tunnel less if they also played some survivor. Haha
---
‚ÄòTis but a meme
---
THEN DEVS SHOULD FIX THE BLEEDOUT SO LEGION CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE GROUND AND "NOT BE IN A CHASE."
---
Dude I didn't even notice the Claudette hair. Just thought it was one of those indirect salty memes. You know when they try to mask it with a funny meme but it's what they genuinely think and are salty about?
---
That's why I was breaking down everything in it.
---
Nea looks fine, the problem is her cosmetics makes it look like she's trying to win an ugly contest.
---
Rather level her to level 40 or wait for DS to be on the shrine, it‚Äôs been their quite often. 
---
I really don‚Äôt give two shits if you flashlight save or not. I have no problem with using in-game devices (but fuck NOED and DS). It‚Äôs just a meme I made at midnight.
---
That is correct. Legion sadly removes the skill input of a killer aswell as the skill input of the survivor.
---
Don‚Äôt trash talk bad killers when you should be in better ranks
---
WHAT IF YOU DERANK AS A SURVIVOR THO?
---
Killer main here
---
So when I was in the lower ranks, I absolutely abused NOED. Nowadays I don't waste the perkslot because SWF teams usually find it in seconds. That's if they didn't already destroy all the dull totems in the first place and if I'm not running TOTH I don't know if they are doing it. 
---
That being said, fuck no does NOED need a rework. 
---
In a game full of toxic survivors with god tier flashlights, teabagging, and salty messages for even one sacrifice, we killers deserve NOED to stay as it is if not buffed in some way.
---
It should be a rule rather than a hex IMHO
---
If you don't like it then cleanse every totem you see. It gives you points anyway.
---
I personally love breaking hooks when I play survivor I break every single one I see üëÄ
---
So true. Not to mention its less efficient against decent players that will just do gens in that time since there's no map pressure. You get less bloodpoints for it too but nobody seems to listen. Unfortunately all they care about is their pip and how many kills they manage to get... 
---
:D but it is pretty cute meme, you gotta agree on that 
---
Third that.
---
Yeah kindred for everyone, due to excessice camping.
---
This picture is so great. LMFAO. 
---
At least it's not Fire Up. That'd break the game.
---
Bad survivors, you mean. 
---
 Still, it would be stupid to count on Whispers+crouching to work when against good survivors. 
---
I didn't, actually. But idgaf if you believe me. 
---
memes aside, this is a great movie. go watch if you havent
---
Is there a perk more useless for killer now than hangman‚Äôs trick? Lol
---
Same
---
The devs said that there is one if you DC to often, but I read about someone actually getting banned only once.
---
grab them by the pus-
---
"I showed you my knife, answer me!"
---
There are replacements
---
Yeah I was playing Sonic Unleashed after a long time of DBD and then I ended up calling the QTE skillchecks
---
Counterplay would be being close enough to a hook that the survivor won't get a chance to use it. Happens me a lot
---
Run unbreakable/no mither. Crawl to the hatch. Don't use ds. That's about your three options to avoid him slugging you to avoid the ds.
---
... I need a backstory for this gif. 
---
Ok but oppressing the scream after a failed skillcheck is still related to the perk. Why does it oppress the scream from madness but not that one?
---
I suk cocks with no aids tho
---
I think he just thinks he's good and wants to taunt the killer.
---
She won
---
Why DID you make this?
---
It was also the same story for Crash Course. They also wouldn‚Äôt let them simply patch the game either. It‚Äôs a similar situation like what happened with the Orange Box on console.
---
Literally just saw it on Imgur with no context, so I don't know it sorry
---
That campfire animation made me actually wanna play him. 
---
0k &gt; 14k 
---
Oh yeah, HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIDEON!...oh wait he never born :(
---
For all the 2 people that use it, since all it does is help the survivors gen rush
---
Im not afraid of DS or SWF .....now haddonfield...thats another story
---
That's how she looks though. It isn't unrealistic or anything, it's just her style.
---
1. I do, you didn't mention you wanted to hear it.
---
2. Im not complaining about the hooking part, I'm complaining about the watching part.
---
3. Because it removes 95% of what this game offers. I could write a paragraph to you on this.
---
Give me one reason that isn't you being a giant imbecile why you don't want an exciting gaming experience. 
---
Well we all kinda dictate what playing the game is you fool, the devs listen to the people and may or may not implement changes accordingly. Would you also say killers who used to struggle with infinites and sad it had to change were up in their own ass? Who were they to tell the survivors how to play the game amirite?
---
That's what ima say now, every time someone asks why I'm so ugly ima jusy say it's my style
---
"Stop that! Stop that right now!!", Said the neurosurg nurse. 
---
I made this.
---
I think Nea looks very fitting for her description she has really pretty eyes and a couple of good hairs. Her cosmetics are all amazing and her voice is lovely. I think she‚Äôs fine not every can be as beautiful as Kate or as cute as Feng. The game brings variety and I don‚Äôt find Nea ugly she‚Äôs adorable. 
---
I think he's saying that cocky people use DS, rather than DS users becoming cocky.
---
Chicken or the egg i guess
---
Someone had to do it
---
Whats wrong? Just because someone can get a 4k outside of their skill level without using meta perks and add-ons you get mad because you cant?
---
Sit down son, let me revel in my accomplishments without your salt clogging my arteries.
---
@TheHag
---
I'd reccomend getting everybody to 40 you want the teachables from (or everyone to 40 if you want all the perks), then focus points into a survivor/killer you want to play.
---
Why would you guys buff self care ? Same as barrow time no one asked for it balance the game jeez ... 
---
why did you make this?
---
They are counterplaying against your decisive strike. They're being smart.
---
Let's see yo fatass do better, Sed.
---
What does he do?
---
That is not the point.
---
Flaming someone and then harassing them on their steam page over a game like DBD is pathetic. Especially a game with no money rewards involved...and no career path. So I stand by what I said.
---
Its not a competitive game...and its asymmetric in nature....so to get so wound up over your character dying is pretty lame.
---
I mean hallowed blight only had 2 survivors(which werent that good compared to killers) and 4 or 5 killers. Maybe they are making it up. But i love the huntress's
---
One of the very few uses for Unrelenting is to help low rank/new killers so I don‚Äôt understand this comment. 
---
Way less killers as of lately
---
Are they owned by different production companies? The one that owns LF may be cool with cosmetics while the one that own saw/pig may not be.
---
*sad oink*
---
Holy crap, you're not getting anyone banned because they DCed once against you, wtf
---
Maybe I will!
---
bih
---
Lol I'm going to start playing sleepy boi for that pharmacy now
---
Without Unbreakable? No, the killer can do this and not be punished for it.
---
I surprisingly encounter them all the time but they‚Äôre probably just doing dailies and they rarely seem competent.  Always sympathetic; admirable to get out there and play the killer that mildly doesn‚Äôt work on console.
---
If you held someone for 10 seconds then that means they failed their DS.
---
Unless you're talking about people who don't have obsession but do have DS in which case, who gives a flying fuck. There's almost always a hook within the time it takes for someone without obsession to use DS.
---
Or are you talking about 3 juggles for one person?
---
In which case you're a damn fool because you're supposed to eat the DS as early as possible and save juggling for when it's late game and them DSing you means they have a good chance of getting out.
---
If you down obsession within the first 0-2 gens and you don't eat that DS because you're juggling that means you're not a smart killer.
---
You eat the DS in the beginning and juggle late-game.
---
Yeah I play swf a lot and we always do meme builds and mess around to just have fun. I never use NOED and I rarely ever use DS since DS is overrated and NOED is a massive crutch imo. It annoys me when other survivors teabag after every pallet or spam click their flashlights because there's just no need for it. Same with certain 'killer techniques' like slugging or facecamping. It's just annoying and unfair. 
---
While most people agree that LF could do with a buff or two, it's ridiculously hilarious how many salty survivors always tell me that I only killed them because of my power, which is probably the most unreliable killer power in the game (not the worst given that Freddy and Legion exist, but using it can be a huge pain).
---
Yeah, but... so were the ones in right now
---
Playstation just needs to have the option to upload to reddit lmao I appreciate the tips and advice though m8s
---
it's a meme best savoured in 4k
---
:( hold me.
---
It's part of the head. You can see each item seperately in the datamined pictures.
---
Not to sound rude but you often get those kind of chainsaws on PC. Maybe on console it's harder and this is impressive but this is kinda usual for me, and I'm not an oustanding Hillwilliam
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but I have to downvote this on general principle.  If it leaves new, the joke is ruined.
---
Interesting. I thought many people wanted to play as killer since it was easy to get points. 
---
Then they act like you totally didn't carry the team by doing half the gens while they couldn't even loop properly.
---
Megs be like: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/240/075/90f.png
---
Who said I'd be looking for that ban from one offence? I think you're trying to fit words into place that were never said; it'd be pretty obvious for a ban if this happened several times, however.
---
Quit over-reacting, an admin would know if this has happened often.
---
That argument doesn‚Äôt really work when he could theoretically be using a different obsession perk. 
---
Even if it wasn‚Äôt DS, the killer would likely still assume that it‚Äôs DS. 
---
Not always an option.
---
Thank God there's no proximity chat.
---
Yup, just one second before escape - some people get salty, you know?
---
Are you saying that Legion is bad ?
---
This is the real reason I've never bought any of the licensed killers.   
---
There's little-to-no updates to them after they release. It almost feels like a cash grab; or "here, you got your killer. now shut up and let us get back to our off-brand versions."
---
You already get 5k bloodpoints if the killer disconnects via the 'leave' option. 
---
Probably a fast and frustrated alt+f4
---
Yea I got this game 2 weeks ago as well. I‚Äôm almost rank 2 killer and kids are just desperate to find something to complain about. They accuse of tunneling and camping even though they are obviously right around the corner waiting to save their friend. Plus I‚Äôm using ruin so no one is getting generators. I might as well secure some kills and hits. 
---
what
---
How sway? I don‚Äôt play killer often but when I do 4k games are not hard to come by.
---
What? 
---
So what when a survivor hops on a gen it‚Äôs no longer white?
---
took me about 800k to get level 33 during the winter event
---
Then stop projecting. :\^)
---
Outstanding move!
---
Understandable have a Mori day
---
Thank you good sir
---
So glad there isn‚Äôt proxy chat with the killer. I would mute the fuck out of this guy. 
---
Except even the good players think the same, like the majority of streamers. Theres a huge difference with mori. Nobody is saying legion is OP, just that hes unfun to play against. He has no counterplay in the chase thats the problem. Thats not comparable to mori
---
Honestly you just sound as whiny as them.Survivors can do whatever they want and you can do as well.First hook?WTF?They can bodyblock whenever they want.Some players play for fun.You clearly do not.By all means patrol the hooked guy since he has no fault in this and ruin his experience rather than the guy you are actually mad at that for some reason.Like it is very easy to justify camping.Classic excuse:didnt see anyone with bbq so they are nearby the hook=camping(or patrolling)time.If you want to camp camp.Dont blame it on something else.Messages outside the game are toxic but you can completely block them.Problem solved.Anything else?
---
Even if he pulls his internet, so it goes down as a connection issue?
---
They couldn‚Äôt even get the Mark Hoffman or Doctor Gordon version. At least with Hoffman we‚Äôd have a reason why the RBTs aren‚Äôt rigged to blow the second a generator even activates. Amanda would sabo the timers so that ding, generator activates, SNAP, you die. Plus it‚Äôs not like Hoffman is a stranger to the RBT, having scored the only kill with it in the entire franchise, and having escaped a rigged one.
---
Just while youre running to break los. 
---
YOU DON'T GOT THE ANSWERS, SWAY
---
Yea so much so that when I'm survivor I accept it. Like yupp I've probably done it as killer five times for that one.
---
Ah yes the old classic villain genrush, better waste most of the game getting possibly pointless dull totems done, finding 4 with the last one in a near impossible to find spot ‚Äòcause baby needs to be carried.
---
Dribbling won't work in most cases because after the third drop the survivor automatically wiggles off
---
Slugging is the counterplay to DS. It has tradeoffs, youre just unlucky it was at the end of the game
---
I didn‚Äôt see any lag
---
yo whats up
---
It‚Äôs why matchmaking broke after the winter event, they haven‚Äôt updated the game since except for reverting it to a previous build but when double BP ended the people who were playing killer solely for BP left. Most of the people who play killer play it because they enjoy killer like me especially but after the latest patch and the crap killer and massive BBQ nerfs and the borrowed time buffs they put out it‚Äôs honestly just so much easier and more fun to play survivor. 
---
I assume many people underwent a similar course of action, but I‚Äôve personally stopped being a ‚Äúkiller main‚Äù and have been playing more and more survivor lately. I can play it with friends, it‚Äôs a lot more fun and a lot less stressful. I don‚Äôt even play much killer anymore and I‚Äôd assume the lack of killers is due to people doing the same. 
---
People really be out here taking Mcote‚Äôs advice regarding killer being unfun and stressful: ‚Äújust go play survivor or civ 4 lol‚Äù /s
---
The point is if he picked the perk he doesnt have a right to complain about ppl playing against it
---
Or a bad killer prolly 
---
Not necessarily, no. All killers can be good in the right hands even if their powers arent quite the best. However, with Legion, I think that their power has too many unnecessary drawbacks pulling it down. For example, the power makes one unable to see scratch marks and gen auras. Additionally, the power meter resets after hitting a survivor normally. There are other issues like audio being completely distorted and there being to penalty to staying injured against Legion, but those features are being tweaked in the PTB.
---
Okay homie I'll be there. I'm gonna beat up your ass and hit you up inside. No homo, only dominance
---
Check for any updates, that's what I do
---
Was it a safe or an unsafe unhook
---
You don't see Billy at high ranks? Or Hook trapping hags? Prayerbead Spirits? That's basically what we run into constantly
---
there was no terror radius so im assuming it was safe
---
You can get negative altruism depending on the stuff you do. If you let people die, unsafe hooks etc
---
i escaped with a guy on the hook because the killer had noed.. maybe thats why
---
Ah I had no idea..still inspired me to give drawing a go:) don't know why I'm getting downvoted though 
---
Maybe. No idea
---
Such as? If its OoO the killer woudlve known. 
---
Yea ngl, if you get my hex before the first gen I'm hooking you and you'll probably end up being the first sacrifice.  
---
With ruin it's understandable. That's why I dont run it at red ranks. Nothing worse than having &lt;2 tokens with devour hope though. Total waste.
---
Or u could just keep running in a building or around walls. Myers is gonna catch up and stalk u anyway. As a Myers main I love when people try to crouch behind cars or trees right in front of me because I still get easy stalk off them without even having to chase them
---
Why wouldn't you want to eliminate a strong survivor quickly after that? It would be dumb not to. It's great play by the survivor, but I know if I did that I'd defs be expecting a tunnel afterwards. 
---
GUYS LOOK AT THIS NERD! He doesn't even skip math class!
---
yea back to killer main for me lol this is dumb af

---
I THOUGHT THEY LEARNT THAT THE PLANTS WERE A BAD IDEA.
---
Killers earn more bp anyways. I play on ps4 and right now the queue time for survivors is like 10 minutes. 
---
That's why they're not necessarily going to put it onto live, they want to see how it affects gameplay
---
They should just be fine with it tho
---
It's "safe" if your teammate stays up for 10 seconds after you unhook them. 
---
*clears throat* 
---
WHERE'S MY BBQ AND CHILE?
---
Your whole comment is just a huge assumption about me not dealing well with losing the game. The only true part being that 2 minutes being annoying. I got outplayed before, I made stupid plays and got destroyed, but it didn't bother me. You know why? Because I got to play the game. Yes mistakes have consequences. After getting hooked it's up to my team to make it work. But if you don't see how getting caught once shouldn't automatically mean I'm out of the game I can't help you. Imagine losing a payload game mode after the attacking team captures the first point. Sounds stupid doesn't it.
---
This is the real answer
---
Based off of your comment history i can without a doubt say you are one of the toxic ochido fans, most of your history is trash talking someone for what they post "because it's garbage" yet the only 4 posts you have is an over used meme, asking if servers are down, saying you enjoy playing freddy even though he sucks and rant about being seen as a survivor because of a bug. 
---
You sir are a failed troll and a toxic scum bag. Get outta here with your dumbass.
---
‚ÄúWindows everywhere‚Äù
---
*HEAVY TRAPPER BREATHING*

That‚Äôd be like letting someone use your phone and they go and factory reset it. You should just be fine with it tho. You let them use it but you‚Äôre not gonna let them do whatever they want with it.

Yeah teabagging is toxic too, everyone knows that. Although looping and ds isn't toxic, it's really the only way survivors can win. Whereas killers can win with skill instead of camping.

Yes, it turns yellow and red, so all you have to have is a good memory and say, "wait a minute that gen was white before!" And it stays yellow for 16 second at level 3

Thank you.
---
Heyyyy, that's pretty good.
---
Billy mains everywhere rejoice 
---
No, they aren't. You can still try to get to the hatch and force a pickup. Besides that, doesn't NOT slugging you force the killers into a situation with no counterplay? Their only other option is to eat the stun.
---
Well my dream of climbing Freddy only seems to be fleeting
---
It's a Hag with all default perks. They're new to the game.
---
Because of the arc that Clown‚Äôs bottles travel I don‚Äôt think I crosshair would be all that useful.
---
They can't ban people on the console version. If you're playing the pc version I would definetely report him and also add a short message to explain what happened and hope that what they did was enough to get them banned.
---
I‚Äôm so glad there isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre kind of a douche bag. 
---
What do you mean? Have a look again, can you not see in either video as soon as I use sprint burst my character starts jerking about, and that the speed is the same when sprint burst has ended?...
---
Not sure which is funnier- The LF getting fucked over or the fact that someone fell for it anyway.
---
GAME 1- NORMAL. GAME 2- CRASH ON LOADING SCREEN. GAME 3- THREE SURVIVORS LOAD IN, KILLER D/Cs. GAME 4- KILLER D/Cs DURING LOADING SCREEN. GAME 5- 3 SURVIVORS LOAD IN, OTHER SURVIVORS D/C. GAME 6- LOADING SCREEN FREEZES. SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED 1 GAME IN 45 MINUTES ON PC. HOW IS THIS SHIT ACCEPTABLE TO ANYONE? HOW ARE THERE SURVIVOR MAINS OUT THERE THAT PUT UP WITH THIS? AT LEAST I CAN BE 90% CERTAIN I'LL ACTUALLY LOAD IN WHEN I PLAY AS KILLER. I WORK FULL TIME. IT'S HARD TO JUSTIFY SPENDING MY GAMING TIME ON A GAME THE DEVS CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO QA.
---
Look at the part where "repair" comes up, that should stay on screen not blink.
---
From what I've seen so far the combination of Self Care and Botany Knowledge together makes it far more efficient for survivors to heal themselves than heal others. In fact it makes healing so fast that I think it's going to be almost a necessity for killers to run Sloppy Butcher.
---
It will be even worse if you know that some of your teammates are running Leader. Just run to the one that's already on the gen who has it, heal right next to them at 133% speed and then hop on the gen with them. 
---
I said damn because the comment was funny. But tbh I would tunnel the guy too
---
Oh brilliant, I can attempt it again. The nurse one will just have to be attempt after attempt until it happens, was it a hook grab or a genny grab? 
---
make this happen!!!
---
Because it's not actually cheating, yet if an error occurs the devs are gonna do nothing about it.

Fake entertainment. I rather watch folks that are more genuine then screaming swf who derank on purpose. If she deranked it means she screwed over so many teams in past games. Dc ruins the game for me and I don‚Äôt support the fools who do it. Hope they take away her fog whisper status. 
---
"Clearly you're the one who's mad, I just quit the game when you were about to hook me for the third time so you don't get the points :)"
---
Hahaha
---
you were jumping around a bit but i dont think you were closer than you should have been. you just ran to a place with nothing to save yourself
---
Deranking is not why No0b3 got banned. In fact, I don't know anyone who'd been banned for deranking. 
---
Glad we agree. IMHO I won't be a dick killer to a good non toxic swf. I've met a good amount of awesome swf teams, but more often than not its a toxic one. 
---
Shit. Just became friends yesterday with a team over a pretty intense match.
---
It is their job to ensure that the game doesn't potentially ban people for something that isn't actually cheating. Pay attention.
---
How would he find survivors that just crouch and hold still? They don't make noises so it seems unnecessary to have to hide. If you could hide while walking or at least crouch walking then I could see it being useful. Another thing to think about is that this killer would potentially be super easy to 360 since they don't have an accurate read on survivor movement. To combat this I would say either give the killer a super wide cleaving swing OR reveal auras of moving survivors within 4 meters (2 meters for walking, 1 for crouching?). Another thing is that while this power sounds super cool it doesn't really seem that useful or strong, it's just a unique game experience. I would say to make this killer's power truly a power and not just a rule set, make their base movement speed faster than normal (120%-130% Idk), make their hearing ranges much bigger than normal, and make their Shriek a much shorter cooldown ability that affects a more local area instead of global, perhaps the size of the clicking radius, and then with a cooldown of like 20 seconds it becomes a more interactive skill. On top of that you could add a charge up to the shriek that survivors can see and then Hide in response to which opens up more counterplay and mind games and such. All in all this is a dope as hell killer idea, sort of like a hardcore Spirit. Sorry bout the wall of text but I got excited.
---
It's tricky to explain how to hit them, but it is possible. Essentially get to the edge and lunge while hugging the rock, you'll fall but if you did it right you'll hit them. Extremely hard to do and it honestly does suck that salty survivors can abuse such a thing without penalty on ps4. 
---
The worst part is that the survivor will most likely just stay there for over 20 minutes just to ensure you dc. But that's just another day in dbd full of salty and toxic people. 
---
I mean, I could 100% tell, but being another art poster on the subreddit if I were to comment it just seems backhanded, if that makes sense.
---
This is probably fucking dumb but im not understading the nerf or buff that is happening here im also new at this game.. im sorry
---
Runs the most OP survivor perk, then complains about the killer fighting back üòÇ
---
He wide
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 but I know it doesn‚Äôt do anything, it sure as hell makes me feel better tho
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Wow, you triggered alot of people. Thank god unis have safe spaces.
---
To be honest, a few more offerings should be hidden. Like the blackward / whiteward. 
---
Actually, only map and BP gains should be unhidden. Even then, I feel like some green tier BP gains should be hidden. Like as a killer it changes my play style of I see two or more alturistic offerings. I know they will be doing faster hook saves so I should stay near the hook more.

If you don't want to get banned then don't touch the game files. It's not BHVR's fault if you get banned for poking around in their junk

When you think that you're good, but you're going up against a low skill killer.

I mean technically speaking we're talking about emotionless and voiceless executioners for a black spider demon so...

Monsterous Shrine?
---
"You gotta learn much" sounds more like trashtalking then trying to be nice. So it makes sense why the killer responded the way they did. 
---
Ah ok I remember that buff. Thought they buffed it again. 
---
i see youve suffered too. 
---
YOU AGAIN ASSUME THAT QUENTIN CAN BE HURT
---
# GODS DON'T BLEED
---
I understand slugging, it can be a good strategy. But it IS really annoying and boring. Face camping is just rude. I don't entirely mind if they're just staying near the hook to keep pressure, but face camping is just rude and unnecessary. 
---
You're only using half of her power then. If you're not doing the ambush attack you're meant to do, then you shouldn't get any points for it. Canceling your power to hit someone isn't the same as using your full power to ambush someone.
---
I‚Äôm not sure either, i haven‚Äôt downvoted you, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve been inspired
---
i can frequently flashlight save in red ranks, if you time it right even the fastest neck snap can‚Äôt deny saves ^^
---
u/not_queen_bhvr Can someone from the team address the fact that Legion is boring to play as AND against and is incredibly underpowered? The power is fundamentally boring and actively encourages survivors not to heal since Legion is so slow they can't catch anyone without using Frenzy anyways.
---
Dead silence (as usual) when you have so many people speaking out against this is disheartening.
---
Next time I face a guy like that, I'll try as you say. Thanks for the advice!
---
Yeah but I mean slugging when there's 5 gens left and it's right at the start of the game with no pressure on the killer whatsoever. They're so focused on getting a 4k nobody gets more than 3k points except for the killer who only gets about 4k anyway. 
---
I cannot fucking believe they made legion worse. What the actual fuck. 
---
Thanks man
---
When 1.5 hit i got dstruck so hard my game crashed. I even have it on video lol
---
Is this real?! :O 
---
predator in the corner.. wut
---
I've only just started playing this game for about a week now.  I can definitely confirm this, even in lower rank play, this is totally a thing and way too advantageous for survivors.  I'm not sure if I'm getting smurfed on either, but that just makes it worse.  I've played games with multiple killers (I'm using nurse a lot trying to get better), and even with high map mobility survivors have gotten 2-3 gens in the first 3 minutes of the game.  I'm not even that good yet.  It takes the fun right out of the game.
---
Not to mention I played against the same group twice, 4 claudettes, and they flamed me after the game to top it all off.  Really put a damper on my willingness to play killer.
---
I don‚Äôt get why they just don‚Äôt make Decisive always be 35% wiggle as obsession and 50% when not

Omg ikr. In a lot of situations the killer will get more BP than the survivors even when they lose. Kind of find it annoying when killers do a big hatch standoff even though they literally wouldn't be missing out on much if the survivor escapes. Whilst on the other hand, the survivor might not even pip. Though yes, they deserve the 4k if they played well, there's no use wasting a ton of time just to get that last survivor. 
---
&gt; soon‚Ñ¢

Seen it happen though. Game is going really well then suddenly you stop moving, then you teleport backwards to where you were a moment ago and suddenly they‚Äôre getting hooks like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not MY fault, I swear.‚Äù

When you realize that Dedicated Servers will be a massive Killer nerf. üòÇ
---
They gave survivors SWF, so I don't see why not.
---
Hyper chungus
---
Sorry lolz. Don‚Äôt know the reddit lingo.
---
Another way to test to make sure you can do it efficiently is to recreate the glitch in kyf and work out the right positioning to hit the survivor when against a friend. Might be boring, but could help save you time and frustration in an online game. 
---
disgusting, guess they didn‚Äôt wanna enjoy the video game anyway, pls dont play video games anymore
---
Freddy does not need a buff. Change my mind

If you DC it means you win

Not unwinnable, but very very frustrating. I like the idea of a bloodpoint bonus, because it at least gives you a reason to play against SWF. As it stands currently there is no reason for me to want to play against a SWF. It's USUALLY gonna be very boring with a lot of gen-rushing and/or very frustrating as the communication aspect makes your job so much harder as a killer. The truth of the matter is that SWF is never gonna be balanced, communication in a game designed without communication, that's not a gap that you can bridge. I'd rather just have a reason to not play a different lobby with some BP.
---
How dare you take our lords name in vain. 
---
That's a good idea, but it would still be as strong as before so they want to add downsides to using it. They're doing the same with self care. In some situations, decisive is STRONGER when you have to wiggle. This is because the killer doesn't know if you have it or not until you use it. The killer doesn't get a chance to outplay it or make decisions based on it like breaking pallets in the area before picking up, possibly juggling the survivor, etc.
---
Ah fair play, I forgot about the slow vault grab aha 
---
Shield health down to 10, and excess damage now continues past the shield into your skull 
---
It is if they have a bad system that mistakenly detects cheating.
---

---
Thats a shame because Myers is the best designed killer to date.
---
I've been a survivor main since I got the game (2000 hours) and I still don't understand that mentality. I play to have fun.
---
True, I‚Äôve opened the gates many times and here comes the blood warden!

---
I JUST STARTED I DONT HAVE ANY OTHER PERKS
---
Play with him for like five minutes at rank 1. 
---
Lol plz report them to psn
---
It's not a test change, it's an actual change.
---
Some areas are bad, some not so bad, but the fact is in my limited time I had far more DS/hook problems than I've had the past few weeks on the current version.
---
I think this might be the point where I just walk away from the game. The devs promised a DS nerf over half a year ago and yet instead they keep adjusting the hooks so it's even easier to pull off. What cunts they are.
---
I don't think a crosshair is a substitute for skill. Every FPS game out there has a crosshair. ScottJund, arguably the best huntress player uses a crosshair. So much goes into a huntresses hatchet (when to throw it, how much to charge it, how it's gonna arc, etc.) A crosshair just let's you identify the center of the screen.
---
Thank you so much!

That's the lazy approach.

Perfect PS4 exclusive would be someone from Until Dawn imo, so probably Sam or Mike (Maybe even Josh too tbh?)
---
It seriously looks nothing like Trump at all. 
---
Not rude at all, I can understand that as from what I have seen of the PC version alone the framerate is much more stable. 
---
But as I do main survivor I thought this was a fun little thing for me to achieve :D
---
The only thing I have done on most of my killers is get them to 10 so I can attempt the achievements letter. 
---
I mean should we be surprised? 99 percent of the top voted stuff is shitposts. 
---
Fairly sure it‚Äôs split into 500 Deviousness and 500 Sacrifice.
---
Hes alright to watch when no one else is streaming. But I imagine like everyone else his mood and attitude probably change over the hours/days/weeks, sometime we're in good moods other time salty moods. Maybe you just caught him in a salty mood, myers and corn don't mix well after all.
---
im an ace &amp; david main. 
---
Don't gotta outrun the killer, just need to outrun your friends.
---
The only god tier being is god. Which is me. Get on my level.
---
You can even send it to yourself, start a message froup with someone and have them leave.
---
WHY ARE THERE NO REWARDS FOR WHAT RANK YOU HAVE UPON RANK RESET? EVEN IF IT WAS SOMETHING SMALL, IT WOULD AT LEAST PROMOTE STAYING IN YOUR RANK INSTEAD OF DERANKING ON PURPOSE.
---
ALSO, WHY DO ALL KILLERS SHARE THE SAME RANK? I UNDERSTAND IT KEEPS THINGS SIMPLIFIED, BUT I HATE HAVING TO WAIT FOR RANK RESET JUST TO PRACTICE A NEW KILLER.
---
Is this an actual cosmetic? If so I can die happy.
---
I originally had the short ranged ability as revealing aura, but changed it due to being OP - but then made changes to weaken him anyhow, so should have brought it back. Also added injured survivors as making sound. I also refrained from messing with actual game audio, because it's always been incredibly buggy and non-functional, so why entertain the possibility :,D

Yeah same especially in the evening. I'm on PS4 and it takes longer than usual . Don't know if they know about it and I'm too lazy to create a forum account to let them know 
---
Is it really that long a wait if you didn‚Äôt die immediately though?
---
When does this come out? 
---
Its better than paintbrush hair
---
I only ever play survivor when it's SWF, i've had one too many experiences with the anti-mates who just hide in a corner all game, not doing gens while i run the killer around for literally 20 minutes.
---
You have my respect, Stark. 
---
yes, but those shitposts are (usually) still original ideas.
---
Yeah it's bad ATM . Especially in the evening for me 
---
I'm on PC but it's the same. At first I thought it was because I was using DLC that wasn't popular so I just couldn't find people but then found that to be false.

Mortal Kombat X has multiple cosmetics for licenced fighters so why can't DBD. Leatherface for example.
---
Its EAC, its not exactly the most reputable anti-cheat bot, and its not BHVR‚Äôs fault behind any bans and they‚Äôve warned people to use at their own discretion 
---
The issue is that Charles Clouser is stingy as Hell with who gets the right to use Hello Zepp. Even the actual Saw games didn‚Äôt get to use it.
---
Damn was hoping we could get the donkey jacket :/ wish they would put all old cosmetics in the store like they to with new ones
---
We need cosmets for Pigerina and Myers
---
4 gens in a minute if you‚Äôre coordinated and have good teammates. 
---
The hunted becomes the hunter. 
---
view from the other side: 
---
i missed out on hallowed blight so i'm excited for this. i love the game, but i admit that the general gameplay can get stale since it's always about repairing gens and that's it. the fact that we'll have a week "break" from that to participate in this event doesn't bother me... it kind of breaths life into the game. and there's no saw cosmetics because it's a licensed killer.
---
Completely agree . I was looking for dbd streamers and stumbled upon them watch him for Abit but stopped because of the reasons  u said. He's what I consider a "tryhard" , too analytical while playing and always boasts about how easy survivor is. 
---
Overcharge is garbage for the most part. For it to even be worth it you have to combine it with Unnerving Presence and probably Distressing aswell. Doctor being the only killer that can do that. And even then you are running 2 medicore perks just to make Overcharge worth it. Bad perk.
---
Either advanced slasher, stalky boi, or Literally The Terminator.
---
I'm honestly not that upset that Feng and Ace got the cosmetics but I really think that at least *one* of the free Survivors should've got a shirt at the very least. I think Jake or David could use more cosmetics imo.
---
I guess the Christmas Clown set is why we're not getting a Clown set but I still think it's lame that we're getting *another* Huntress set as opposed to a set for literally any other Killer. Huntress is swiftly becoming the Meg of Killers as she's absolutely drowning in cosmetics while other Killers get fuck all.
---
And again: I'm just really personally miffed about Pig not being included at all but I fully understand that copyright is a bitch, and I really hope that Behavior and the people who own the rights to SAW can agree over something.
---
Or just don‚Äôt cleanse them and then remember exactly where they are when NOED activates instead of having to find the 5th totem after cleansing 4
---
When the game can't find players around Killer's rank, it just throws anyone in.
---
Ya I'm glad they specified because this change is a mess.
---
Are you the Emperor of Humanity? No? Then this is fucking HERESY! TIME FOR EXTERMINATUS!
---
Yes yes and yes. Tunneling is perfectly fine and valid, it just sucks to be funneled. The only reason I‚Äôd call a killer bad for tunneling is if they chased one dude the entire game while everyone else gets gens, to the point of ignoring the others if they see them. But yeah tunneling is as valid as gen rushing
---
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE KILLER MAIN THAT DROPS A CHASE TO COME AFTER ME WHEN THE GUYBHES CHASIN IS INJURED

Meh not really funny, just a not paying attention survivor getting smacked.  I wouldn't feel bad as a player if I did the same thing.  
---
Scoot Jund btw
---
And that‚Äôs why I always run Small Game 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it would have been the same result if OP was full health. Regardless it‚Äôs broken because there is no counterplay to this unless you happen to time your flashlight as he is vaulting after you.

They're traced. How about you r/quityourbullshit and stop trying to worm your way out. It's not a "similar style", it's straight up tracing.
---
Once I followed someone after unhooking them to heal them because I had WMI. They ran to a corner and self cared through sloppy, thanataphobia, and coulrophobia. I considered fast vaulting a window to get the killers attention because it was so frustrating to see
---
Links to leaks?
---
And Freddy! (Plz don‚Äôt hurt me)
---
So much requested major nerf to SWF = weak patch. OK.
---
Oh, no, I wouldn't be surprised at all, that's why I said "against me" and not "against most people."
---
But, I maintain that it would be particularly mean against new players, especially for things like Devour Hope.
---
I think you need to look again? I'm still sprinting after sprint burst was used, at exactly the same speed. It isn't anything to do with saving myself, you can clearly see the lag spikes holding my character back, do you move jaggedly when moving left or right? Nah, because the movement dynamics are smooth to either direction... 
---
JUST REACHED RANK 4 AS KILLER AND RANK RESET CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH
---
oh my god i burst out laughing when i ready that... literally 2 seconds in
---
I dunno. I know that people play more after 5 pm. Before it's hard to have a game
---
Watch the first video, when I turn around, I start vibrating - that isn't normal...
---
You don't really get to dictate what the survivors do in the same way they can't dictate what the killer does. You got all worked up over them calling you a camper and and how they should have been doing gens when oddly enough they are saying you should have been going around killing away from the hook you feel they should have played the way you wanted them to play and therefore you are being whiney. 
---
If people want to try hard or play like this is an esports game, there is nothing to keep them from doing so. You criticize people for playing in this way but then do exactly the same thing? Come on man, seriously.
---
Name checks out. 
---
It stays the same for me no matter the time. Before 5 pm makes sense but after that I would imagine it should be fairly easy. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't done something wrong to my game 
---
Lol get called out mate. Nice clap back by the way. 
---
Yeah, I was fearing that much. Still I feel like the music would really fit and would really give you the jigsaw vibe
---
the salt is real  
---
if that happens, drop the survivor, get a new target at that point
---
I only see the same Freddy and its after after midnig- oh that Freddy is clever
---
Legion finds you, he goes sprint burst speed and catches up to you. Theres no mindgame like hiding your light with loops, he just turns into usain bolt and hits you. The chase is boring and never changes at all between all Legions. Add bloodhound ontop of this and you cant even try and hide from him, they just look down at the ground and follow the blood while your deep wound timer still ticks down. Add Franks Mixtape and the chase ends in 20 seconds. Legion finds you, gets his guarenteed 2 hits, waits until his power charges up and usain bolts to you and your down. How is this fun to play against or even play? Theres nothing the killer can do to make the chase end quicker except for exploity stuff like moonwalking or abusing the chase mechanic and theres nothing for the survivor to do except run as far away as they can.
---
OH FUCK ITS ACTUALLY PUSTULA PETALS AGAIN. GODDAMMIT WHY NOT JUST GO WITH THE COCKTAIL GENS, PUSTULA PLANTS JUST MEAN NO ONE DOES SHIT AND WE ALL LOSE.
---
GREAT TIME TO RANK UP YOUR KILLERS THO
---
Who do you think put him in power, hm? Ever consider that? 
---
I'm really sorry, I can't really help you... I've √† not too long q so I dunni
---
Increased luck and up the ante and your off. 
---
You seriously haven‚Äôt read anything I have said so far have you? That‚Äôs my point of a CASUAL MODE. So I don‚Äôt have to face those ranked killers while still playing with my friends against other people. 
---
Haha it hasn't happened to me often, but I might get rid of sprint burst after that, I didn't gain any ground from using it. 
---
33 years old, only grade schoolers call people 'kiddo' on the internet.
---
Look closer.
---
Because its an easy killer to use with a guarenteed 1-2 kill game. He also gets alot of bloodpoints and pips even if he does bad. You arent gonna stop seeing Legions because everything about his design is terrible.
---
The problem is he's claiming it as his own work and mentioned selling posters or prints of it. 
---
No person who knows how to play gets pallet stunned. And bloodhound exists
---
Ace main represent. 
---
I'm not sure if it's a bug or not, but either way it's annoying af. 
---
Also getting rid of sb and replacing it with something better like bl or dh will help you a whole lot. 
---
I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt agree with my opinion, just don‚Äôt come at my saying my opinion is wrong like you did. It‚Äôs people like you that start issues and get called out that get defensive, and say ‚Äúoh I never said that‚Äù
---
Or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù so either way if you don‚Äôt agree with my opinion say so don‚Äôt say just because I don‚Äôt like playing against certain players makes me wrong
---
I think the poster of this thread is just exactly what his name is... a salty nurse who cant stand swf. Sound familiar? Imo he is messing with someones livelyhood. This is this young ladies means of living, her job, and her job is to entertain her viewership. And if that is the playstyle HER viewers enjoy then let her be and let her do what she has to to keep her viewers and earn a living. Of course BHVR would endorse someone that gains thousands of views on their game. Its a no brainer. But even with all that said, at the end of the day its just a freaking game! Have fun with it. You win some you lose some.   
---
I do bring devour hope into most games, it is my favourite perk. I just thinks the cypress mori offering is kind of pointless, but very satisfying way to end a game, and I would be in favour of getting that more often.
---
So whether I was referring to them as an item or not, it‚Äôs a picture of the Nurse with the Doctor. And they‚Äôre in a physical pose that Victorian couples often were photographed in. Regardless of what I meant, I was right either way.. not that it matters but you want to keep trying to be right, but you won‚Äôt be. 
---
Did you end up sucking his dick, though? I need to know these things. He was so nice to offer to let you.
---
I was really holding out hope that Amanda would get some Chinese Pig love this year but when the data mined cosmetics where posted my heart sank. Can we start a petition to the Saw holders to let BHVR give us cosmetics? How do we go about doing that?
---
ID ACCEPT THIS IS MY TWO FRIENDS WERENT ALSO GETTING LAG IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER KILLER GAME, I SWEAR MOST OF THEM HAVE FINE PING IN THE LOBBY TOO BUT WHEN THE GAME ACTUALLY STARTS IT SUDDENLY GOES BAD
---
Funny how worked up people get cause you play a killer YOU like with a play style YOU like, and God forbid you get rank 1 with someone other than Nurse or Hillbilly. üôÑ
---
I don't agree with a lot of this aside from a better end game strategy for the 1v1 level. It is completely realistic to do gens, regardless of how many are left, if you are survivor. I have done it several times where I had to complete two gens just to get the hatch to open. Saying that its absurd to do the objective, in itself, is absurd. If you are a good survivor it can be done with skill check baits and looping. Same way you would lose a killer as if your teammates were alive. Also, no one is saying that its "fun" for the survivor, the fact that you bring that up reinforces the point that it must be changed because it is an un fun mechanic for all. Saying that running from gen to gen by yourself is harsh punishment... isnt punishment at all. This is a cat and mouse game that requires teamwork and deviousness because, as an individual, a survivor is much weaker than a killer. That's why there are 4 of them and 1 killer. Also, why would closing the hatch be too easy for the killer? That's a fair race to the hatch. Especially if the survivors could open it back up like an exit gate. 
---
The real truth of the matter is that this mechanic needs to be removed or reworked because it is a problem for everyone. 
---
Didn't think people would get upset at the others who thought the art looked nice. I didn't know, sorry. :/
---
Seems like a pretty good idea. The only problem is that he doesn‚Äôt really have any incentive to keep people in the dream world. He might as well just continue the chase after the first hit. I feel like this idea could be either very strong or very weak depending on how it‚Äôs done. 
---
Like tachanka
---
The seperate survivor faces were part of the license. They were not added after his release.
---
r/unexpectedwarhammer
---
It was on console.
---
In my pants. 
---
Lmfao is this bait? This has to be bait, making fun of entitled survivors.
---
I do this too. If there are no hooks nearby, then by picking you up the killer has a risk of you breaking free and running to the hatch.
---
If he leaves you on the ground, then you have a choice to either die - which gives him points, or you crawl for the hatch, and run the risk of going too close to a hook on the way.
---
It works well and is the best way to handle DS at end game.
---
Lol at you asking for a counter when DS has none. Dribbling doesnt count because its situational.
---
you cant blind them if they're vaulting after you unless it's a normal vault
---
We build the reverse bear trap in real life and force it on them. We give them the option to allow us to use some cosmetics or they die bye the trap.
---
The key is to not chase. I hide more from survivors than i do as a survivor when i play scratched mirror. The only time you ever see me is around a corner with my knife on it‚Äôs way down.
---
I just take DS because I want to win, I don't think it makes me cocky at all, but that's exactly what a cocky person would say.
---
I've tried so many times. It only worked to bully my friend in a kill your friends match. We all yeeted off the hook and pissed off my friend.
---
What? I had people dc to deny me my Evil Incarnate achievement.  Happened twice already, gave up on the achievement(mainly due to only 3 people loading in for 6-7 games in a row). There are some pitiful individuals in this game.
---
This looks fantastic. Your art style is amazing. I'd love to see one including Susie and Joey too! 
---
Just gave some goddamn faith and you will get away with last big score of bloodpoints
---
OOOF same... I started playing on 14th Feb 2018, which was the DAY the event started. I was a mega noob, I only managed to get a few coins. I didn't mind though, since I only thought I'd be playing for ~20 hrs. I was wrong, by about 2980 hours

---
Nea is Bae. 
---
Isn't dream chaser the one you get when you put survivors to sleep? I'm pretty sure it makes sense to give points considering you're using the full power how it was meant to in order to attack a survivor. 
---
I had mine at 45% at first, but I slowly moved it up to max. Definitely a difference and gotten better turning with a survivors who is doing a 360 
---
nah, Im just not a pansy.  I can deal with DS just fine. I just dont give a fuck and am not hung up on DS like a fucking ex gf.  Get over it man 
---
Survivors need all the BP help they can get. You generally get pitiful amounts compared to even a crappy killer who doesn‚Äôt sac anyone. 
---
TrueTalents always going to have my respect he‚Äôs a genuinely good killer and he doesn‚Äôt use the crutch killer perks like ruin and whispers i play more survivor&gt;killer but if im going to watch a killer on youtube or twitch it‚Äôll be tydetyme or truetalent. The only killer not worth watch imo is ardetha
---
I tried. I really did. Even prestiged her, but other than getting nurses calling as a teachable she is terrible on console. Makes me sad because I really think shes awesome. If you put in the work she is decent but its A LOOOOOOOOT of work. Which isn't really worth the time and effort. 
---
Maybe she will get buffed on console at some point but for now don't waste your time aside from her maybe her perks. Thats about all I can say for her.
---
I played a game like this yesterday had potato teamate and me left i did 3 of the remain 4 gens other guy nowhere to be seen while im trying to avoid huntress she finds me hooks me and i spend the rest of the time dangling till i die. feels good man.
---
When you hit a Survivor for the first time when they are in the Dead Woeld you get Deviousness BP.
---
Caught me. :(
---
I have hundreds of hours recorded of me playing killer, at a much higher level and more successfully than you, guaranteed. 
---
Where's your proof?
---
The controller has little to do with it. She is difficult because of the inconsistent framerate which makes blinks less precise. Granted, the controller makes the quick turns you need to do harder, but she would still be the best killer in the game even on console in spite of that if the game was optimized properly.
---
They probably didn't know you were going for the achievement. They were just annoyed that you were winning / doing well and ragequit.
---
"Updates" wasn't meant to solely mean "issues". I meant cosmetics and other various additions/changes.   
---
learn to look around as you blink 
---
You watch yourself play games....thats kind of weird man

why make this.\\?

I BOUGHT GAME TWO WEEKS AGO, MAIN KILLER. AND I HATE THAT I ESCALATED TOO FAST TO RANK 3, WHERE SUPER MEGA CYBER SPORT SURVIVORS GAVE ME CANCER.
---
It says right there *with the exception of repair speed*
---
good username for that.
---
Lil' bit!...still funny, though.
---
&gt;Haha yeah, I'm just waiting for balanced landing to appear in another survivors skill tree, but it hasn't yet even though I've unlocked it.
---
I remember making this same mistake when the Halloween chapter came out. I learned my lesson.
---
My experience as survivor is 50% I find it first 50% I find them camping it because they literally have to. It‚Äôs not super fun for anyone imo
---
you might be spamming too fast/hard. 
---
Well, they did say they'd be rolling out the new matchmaking system to players slowly in January, at least that was the plan. Perhaps that has something to do with it? Because my queues have been faster than ever lately.
---
I never said I was good haha but I don‚Äôt know how to make it work that‚Äôs why this was supposed to be a discussion. And not have the majority of you come running at me like the hillbilly running with his chainsaw
---
So instead of healing yourself but it takes twice as long, your healing speed is only reduced by half of what it used to be and the drawback is that the same penalty applies if you try and heal someone else (this won‚Äôt matter because of how meta the perk will become due to the heavily reduced penalty

It takes twice as long to self care yourself? That seems more like a nerf?
---
So far Legion and The Doctor lead my disconnects. I think the former has died down since more meta started coming out about them, but for awhile it was the old "OP! NERF! BABYKILLER EASYMODE!" that translates to "I don't immediately know how to counter this, so instead of learning I'm just going to get salty."
---
Even using The Pig with an item (so no perks), I managed a 2K with both the others getting hooked, so she seems like she could be a ton of fun. Fighting her certainly is a beast, stealth killers can be actually terrifying to try and survive against.
---
Next up is carpal tunnel in your thumb :/ 
---
Why thank you,made this reddit account after i started maining legion.
---
Well done. I intend to do the 100% as well. The huntress trophy must the hardest one, I have a bad aim lol My last one was the all four escape through hatch, since it was bugged
---
Significantly worse than ds but ibsee your point I guess
---
nobody
---
Who in their right mind would run sole survivor lol and if you‚Äôre running object obsession which is the only other viable one then the killer would know as well lol
---
No the penalty used to be that you heal yourself at 50% of normal speed but now you do it at 75% but you also heal everyone else at 75%. 
---
Why does everybody on here bitch about noed and ds? Every other post is complaining about either one it's a part of the game, deal with it
---
Wait so they deadass made it possible to one frenzy chain someone in the ptb? 
---
How the hell did they think that would be a good idea?
---
You killer is weak, the community will hate at you/call you bad and the Dev might even nerf them in the end cause he is more hated than Freddy ever was. Stay strong, I feel you.  
---
Susie is best girl.

Damm gg ez I‚Äôm dumm srry

Ok so you're using your power how it was meant to be used in order to attack a new survivor. What's wrong with giving points for that?
---
This happened to me recently as well on PS4 for 2 games in a row. Restarting the game seemed to fix it but I‚Äôm sure the issue is still lurking in there somewhere. 
---
Ah, what are the actual times on those do you know what 50 vs 75 would be?
---
only for dailys im afraid
---
Still no function to try out different pieces of skins in the shop without having to purchase them‚Ä¶ 
---
VEGETABLE NOO!
---
The game is not just repair and escape through the door.
---
In this game that legitimately would be a "small loan."
---
A small loan of 100,000,000 or 1,000,000,000 might be more equivalent to the insane claim that is "a small loan of a million dollars."
---
But yes, your referential humor is not wasted. This gave me a hearty laugh when I read it. =]
---
Against mirror myers there are a bunch of actual infinites.
---
Imagine trying to accomplish something using a 3 blink nurse  /s
---
Nah good job take my upvote
---
Well then they need to do something about noed because u cant really save someone on the hook with noed especially if no one cleanses the totems
---
What the fuck are you getting pissy at me for? I was just explaining what he asked

---
And a cross hair can‚Äôt help against dodging, it just makes long distance throws more accurate when you have enough skill to predict movements.
---
Oh look at mr. Ihavefriends way to rub it in üò¢
---
Honestly, they should have it apply post game then. Then it would be a serious contender for builds.
---
The healing is add-on dependent. And survivors Mitchell having to heal agajaht legion was really broken. Something needed to be done
---
Had a pretty intense game the other day as the spirit. Long story short I standing at the hatch waiting for the dead on hook dwight to surface.
---
He shuffles forwards crouching the whole way. Then gently sets his toolbox down next to the hatch. 
---
Idk what came over me. I was all ready to wait this out for a hard earned 4k.
---
But the dwight giving me his toolbox gave a me ["Winter Warlock"](https://youtu.be/nu8UCrqMtwg) moment.
---
I stepped back and let him pass. This game is suprisingly wholesome at times.
---
Why wouldn't she just leave this makes no sense???
---
I don't think you get the point of this thread... It wasn't out of choice, his connection cut at the end of the game, so I couldn't move, I'm not that much of a psychopath. 
---
 "Players in the dream world and the real world are invisible and intangible to each other and can not interact in any way " - Does that mean only player in the dream world can heal each other? 
---
 I play her one match a night on ps4 in hopes that if the optimization does work in the spring, I already have some experience with her. 
---
That‚Äôs a valid point. I figured I‚Äôm gonna wait till next week‚Äôs shrine. Hopefully something decent comes up. 
---
deserved. Hate when cocky toxic survivors stay in the game instead of just leaving. It's always great to have them get shut down. Three survivors I went up against should've left, they didn't and I got two of them. Leave while you can.
---
What‚Äôs your suggestion?
---
As a main survivor started feeling burnout. Playing only killer was like playing a 'fresh game'. Started using trapper because I remember him being weak and usted his addons to farm points... but one game led to another, started chasing better and killing better... and here I am, enjoying killer wayyyyy more than survivor.
---
It was a weird game because they started very well, one of them looped me pretty well, but when Nea was caught they just tried to 'Rambo' rescue her, ignoring traps, healing in front of me and, overall, being overconfident.
---
Fucking hell
---
You right
---
Maybe....
---
I think it should just be removed from the game and replaced with a different perk. Either that or their first suggestion, ironically, to nerf the perk would work out. Just give it No Mither stats. Once you use DS, fuck you, now you get downed in one hit and always make noise. Seems fair.
---
Haha your right I misunderstood. Thank you for clarifying.
---
You sound like an asshole when you tell someone they ‚Äúgotta learn much‚Äù and you‚Äôre both rank 15 and new to the game. 
---
Yo!
---
As long as you face camp and ignore the other 3 survivors, that‚Äôs fine. Otherwise you‚Äôre toxic lol. 
---
What movie is it?
---
I would‚Äôve loved to see post chat
---
He might have been running the perk Tinkerer, which removes the killer‚Äôs heartbeat for a bit when a generator reaches 85% completion. Was it the whole match you couldn‚Äôt hear him for or just parts of it? 
---
I CANT GET OUT OF RANK 15 ON SURVIVOR, IF I DO SOMEBODY WILL FACECAMP ME AND I'M GONNA DERANK!!!!
---
IT FEELS LIKE BHVR IS LIKE "THIS BOY OUT OF RANK 15 GET HIM A TEAM OF SANDBAGGERS AND A FACECAMPING LETHERFACE" WHENEVER I ESCAPE RANK 15!!!!
---
Nah, other people do. Nice deflection though, i'm sure you're totally legit. 
---
It‚Äôs not rendered useless when the killer can have them down within 20 seconds with literally zero counterplay.... how the hell do you expect people to heal when they get downed in two hits that are quite literally guaranteed.
---
Legion is in a number of ways like nurse. Pallets and windows are irrelevant to him as they are with nurse, something only two killers have in common. It‚Äôs so fucking true that they are alike that it‚Äôs not even funny. 
---
It was random
---
Haha all good 
---
I honestly dont have one, Ive seen a bunch of good ones but its hard to really judge. But again Im not a game designer, Im a player. :p
---
Welcome to red ranks
---
If mori baseline no timing in flashlight saves change my mind
---
To be honest I was just more confused about what the hell a scribble art was.
---
Interesting thought there, but if my statement is correct and all gens do start white and go to their normal color when a survivor touches it, then the killer can just go over to the generator and start an early chase to give them some momentum at the start of the game, this would be a huge help most (though not all) killers because some killers at the start of a game might not know where to go and this would basically tell them where survivors are so that the killer can start chasing right away.....if of course this is the case with this part of the perk.
---
Once Self-Care and Ruin stop being mandatory, we can talk about how the meta shifted. 
---
I like that. Like, if you land a pallet stun (like in a chase) than you "save a piece of the wood" to use later. (Just trying to think of something in-game that makes sense...) Maybe you get a token for each pallet stun and after x number of tokens you can use them for the DS, once per game.
---
1 token = slightly stuns the killer, disables the perk
---
3 tokens = considerably stuns the killer and drops survivor, disables the perk
---
I believe the direction the devs are going is giving solo survivors as much info as swf and then balancing from there. As an example they might show when someone who isn't the obsession is in a chase, have a little icon showing what each survivor is doing, etc. I think closing this gap and buffing killers accordingly is the best path to take. This game isn't nearly as good alone so why punish people who want to actually enjoy the game?
---
Legion is the most OP killer lmao
---
i love how Survivors need 4 Very Rare offerings to counter 1 Very Rare Killer offering. Perfectly balanced. Can we do the same for fog?
---
Things are getting heated in the Dead by Daylight fandom
---
It should. The disconnection still comes from him, not you. 
---
Er... I don't know if this will change your mind, but I specified Cyprus mori. If there is only one survivor left on the map and they are on the ground, I have my doubts that a single flashlight save would be missed as a result of this proposed change.
---
Wait what's just happened? Is there a new mechanic in the PTB? I am a console player
---
Well first off the caps lock I want to rage about because I‚Äôm on my iPhone and can‚Äôt lock my caps lock and it has shitty autocorrect. Now onto the game. My rages is about useless freaking team mates. The kind who sit next to you while you are hooked the entire time the killer is on someone else and waits till he comes back to check the hook before attempting to unhook. 
---
It was the worst last night. At least 4 survivors did this after all but one of my friends got off and none were new to the game they were just horrid teammates. 
---
The worst came when He did it to me the first time I got hooked and he was 10 feet from me then tried to unhook me when the killer was 2 inches from the hook and I get insta downed. And hung again in matter of seconds. 
---
Then we get the gens done and I open Both exit gates and my friend gets hung and the guy is basically at the hook with him. The other random gets downed and I get them up while the killer is still around us after finishing the second gate. My friend has been hooked so long with that guy next to him he went into struggle faze. 
---
I then heal back up after taking a hit for the dude I got up and made a mad dash for my friend. By this time the killer ‚Äúspirit ‚Äú is back at him and downs the idiot teammate that decided to try and unhook my friend when the spirit showed back up to the hook and gets downed with my fr end on the hook still. 
---
I grab my friend in a last ditch effort since I have bt and am at full health but somehow I‚Äôm Instantly downed by 1 hit even though I‚Äôm not the obsession somehow and get hanged. 
---
The good random gets the useless guy up but both end up hung as well. This was just the icing on the cake of bad teammates we went through last night. I don‚Äôt care if we all die as long as I get guys that give us at least a chance to escape but most of the time it‚Äôs like getting paired with dumb and dumber. 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm already tracer‚Äù -OP
---
People be on here bragging about getting a 4 man. smh
---
Amazing! Can you do nurse next please? :p
---
Wtf
---
Its that same feeling when you hear Myers reach Tier 2 of Evil Within, and you look around and you realize he‚Äôs been stalking you this whole time.
---
Same.
---
I actually like the balancing of the game atm
---
I‚Äôm also on console! But what happened was someone used a key and since there‚Äôs a time limit for how long the hatch stays open when a key is used. That‚Äôs why it closed, it was just perfect timing! 
---
Oh god yeah I just saw there is others alive I completely missed that and got excited for a end game rework haha 
---
Great work bud.
---
Hatch closed since it was opened by a key. 
---
Yeah I'd like to know as well. At night when I have 3 of my friends playing with me, it can take up to 30 mins to join
---
I don't even think that is needed. Just having DS be unlocked, as it exists now by landing a single pallet stun on the killer would be enought hat most killers would be okay with it I think. The problem with DS right now is that the only counterplay to it is to dribble, which means you have to do that every time you catch that survivor, it never actually goes away. Most killers are just looking for there to be some method of preventing it going off. I like the pallet as a condition because it is something that most survivors will get during a chase, but is still preventable by a killer if they note who their obsession is and respect the pallets with them.
---
I hold grudges like that too, i wont save you if you played like an idiot all game
---
Thank you! At least someone understands! Hahah an upvote and a follow to you my good sir 
---
A simple opinion.
---
IF YOU FIND THEM A BIT AFTER THEY GOT OFF THATS COOL EVEN THO PERSONALLY I NORMALLY TRY TO BE NICE AND LET THEM GO.
---
IF YOURE GOING AFTER THEM AS SOON AS THEYRE UNHOOKED SO THERES NO CHANCE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME, YOURE TUNNELLING 
---
Hopefully one day we‚Äôll get a hatch rework lmao 
---
Yeah, me too. At my rank if there‚Äôs a Freddy or Michael it‚Äôs almost an insta 4 man, but most killers aren‚Äôt even using dlc‚Äôs
---
I think they mainly refer to the fact that just because you are a rank 1, doesn‚Äôt mean you are a god at the game. People throw around the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a rank 1 survivor/killer main‚Äù as if to say that they are very good players. Rank mostly shows the amount of time invested with a small level of skill in order to get to that rank. Rank is not just based on how well you grasp the games mechanics, but also time invested. 
---
So odd to see this message next to such a happy icon 
---
Ohhh, thanks bud
---
The problem is Rank is not combined overall skill. You can hide most of the game never save anyone, but if you do at least one gen, one totem &amp; Escape you‚Äôll pip I‚Äôm pretty sure. I‚Äôm rank one on both Survivor and Killer and tbh you still get some really weak players up there. 
---
You are misunderstanding what people mean when they say that. The ranking system that exists makes it far easier to rank up than rank down. You have to have a very bad game to get a down pip, a majority of games will give you +1 or +0, with some even giving you +2. When people say rank does not equal skill, what they mean is that the way the ranking system is designed, unless you go out of your way to avoid ranking up, you will inevitably continue ranking up regardless of whether you increase in skill or not. A given rank is less likely to reflect your skill in the game but rather the relative amount of time you have spent in the game during this season.
---
And this is why you don't explain the joke. Because, as The Joker said, "If you have to explain a joke, THERE IS NO JOKE!"
---
They can wait
---
Ds sucks too
---
If u play hours on end daily that might be ur issue. Ive been playing since around August and have had zero issues with my buttons i play for maybe 2hrs a day 
---
do both
---
you can finish a gen before they reach the second phase of the hook death giving you time to finish the gen and save them
---
Dude was talking about selling his traced stuff and claiming he wasn't tracing though. As others have pointed out, nothing wrong with tracing for your own benefit, but when you try to build a reputation and earn money on copying works that aren't your own, that's a problem.
---
Another Freddy nerf
---
New totem spawns in PTB are fantastic! ^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
They won't know they've done that though because they never look behind themselves to see üòÇ
---
I play both sides and i feel its completely fair when i kill and when i survive or die
---
Always finish the gen if you have time to do it before second phase! This guy gets it!
---
They don't add mori as baseline every fucking survivor will throw this game to the trash
---
How can play for only two hours
---
Me too, but I‚Äôve never played any of the dlc killers so I can‚Äôt comment on them
---
Deadass he could quite possibly become above billy and with the top tier addons maybe even above nurse.
---
I almost never pull off a generator I'm working to attempt a rescue unless I know the other two survivors are further away and also working a gen. IMO it's better to finish it and attempt the rescue afterwards. 
---
My question is wtf is it? Now that I am looking at it, whatever is up there looks like what you would see on a tree ornament.
---
Trapper is a pretty hard killer to 4k on, it isn't a super impressive feat, but it is worth feeling good about.
---
I woulda immediately dropped who I was carrying and face camped the claudette as punishment
---
This was 910% a farming game. If you have 1% doubt in your mind, get rid of it. There's nothing impossible about getting max score in a farming game. Hell it's not even impressive
---
So every killer would just avoid walking through pallets when they have someone on their shoulder from then on. GG.
---
Gens before frens:)
---
It's me being happy because reached rank 1. But be happy trying to undermine me. Nice community.
---
I don't think anyone said it wasn't her choice.
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
Actually it‚Äôs a cancer community and I want to kms. jokes on you, I undermined you again
---
So Legion went from F tier to S tier? GG.
---
You aren't missing out on anything.
---
YOU DAMNED POTATOS NEED TO LIVE FOR MORE THAN 5 SECONDS INTO THE START OF THE MATCH. WHAT ARE YOU FREAKING DOING TRYING TO EAT THE KILLERS PUDDING!
---
I think it's quite a bit too strong, to be honest.
---
What a terribly-designed killer. The saving grace is that it's so hard to downpip because of how quickly he gets Chaser/Brutality points, but Legion has both an absurdly high skill floor *and* a low ceiling. 
---
One of the things that separates a good nurse and a bad nurse is whether they're happy it's The Game lol.
---
well at least it doesnt affect gens lol
---
Yeah, but would it not go down as connection failure, than disconnecting? You do not get any points what so ever if you disconnect in the loading screen.
---
I like running shit perks for meme builds. Im missing out.
---
Still, it affects at the very least healing (if not other stuff?), so people will be able to heal faster and get back on gens quicker. This seems like it was intended to offset the Self Care nerf/buff, but it affects people who don't even have Self Care.
---
Me if they have franks mixtape.
---
Oh, well if that's case that has to suck.
---
You're not stuck, you're bleeding out but you have a timer.
---
Replace steamed hams with totems and killer tries to convince P3 claudette that totem is for haunted grounds and not ruin
---
Looks kinda like they copied the exact same upper body animation as in his select screen.
---
I‚Äôm not particularly sure myself
---
BM, why leave when you can teabag at the gate with no consequences. Oh wait DS is only free if you have a brain...
---
thats true fair point
---
Oh wait it says it right in the perk description *with the exception of generators*
---
TO MANY DAMN KILLERS WITH TOASTER BOXES FOR ROUTERS THAT HAVE MOLD CHEESE BURNT TO THE SIDE CAUSE THEY LIKE RUBBER BANDING THEM SELVES IN THE NUTS!
---
The balance of the game is pretty dependant on where the player's relative skill levels are. A low skilled set of players will always lose to a high skill, that is as it should be, but when you get closer to even skill levels then you get some interesting showoffs. 
---
At a low skill tier, killers dominate. Survivors don't know any of the mechanics to escape from them, and lack a lot of the perks that are commonly used to make their job easier. Killers also have it hard without their perks too, but for most killers, against survivors that don't know the killer's power in and out, they usually aren't able to counter it much.
---
At mid skill tier, the game is actually pretty balanced. Conveniently, a majority of players in the game are about this level. Both side have their crutch perks like NOED and DS, and often some of the tech has been figured out. Mind games and looping happen, but it isn't exactly optimized. Killer tier list ad meta perks are starting to show up but aren't enough to decide a game before it has started. The game is more or less fair.
---
High skill tier is unfortunately where the turning point happens. Most killers have a skill cap that they hit and the only thing they can do is throw out more mind gmes and hope the survivors will make the mistakes they need to capitalize. The survivors have got looping down to a science though and unless the killer has a chasing related ability, they can keep it going until they run out of pallets. Usually the first hook needs to be within 2 minutes or the killer has already fallen so far behind that the game borders on unwinnable barring a severe mistake by the survivors. The crutch perks haven't necessarily gone away, but there is a more established meta of high tier things that are used. Expect a lot of nurse, billy, spirit and huntresses. The game isn't necessarily that different from mid game play at a glance, but with both teams more optimized, the imbalance in favour of survivors is more apparent as killers find they can't catch anyone until the survivor has made a mistake rather than being able to make successful plays on their own merits.
---
And yet my flair is the Shape.
---
He commited console bath
---
quentin makes me uwu
---
Can someone please explain what death road to Canada is?
---
Did you just said that whispers is crutch killer perk? since when? 
---
Turned a 0k into a 3k nice!!!
---
I don't think this change will go through to live.
---
If they ever plan to implement it, they'll have to rework a bunch of Legion's add-ons.
---
When enough gens are done for the hatch to spawn and the killer gets looped for 20 minutes and then finally downs the Nea.
---
Claudette: doing gens, you? Gotta blast.
---
Are you sure?
---
whispers definitely isn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs a perk he avoids using because it‚Äôs considered cheap. and true‚Äôs said he thinks its cheap aswell
---
They can nerf selfcare but can they nerf Survivors spawning within camera rotation of a Hex totem?
---
Just felt you missed an important step.
---
only if they are injured. its basically counted as a normal hit, except its guaranteed because legion has some ridiculous smack pack ability.
---
Send it to Sony and let them just perma this guy lmao. 
---
Vision is op, plz nerf
---
&gt;In terms of opinions, no you aren‚Äôt wrong because it‚Äôs an opinion.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You cannot however say you are not wrong when making blatantly wrong claims such as hag being the second worst killer in the game.
---
Okay, so if opinions are never wrong nor are they right, why exactly are you saying that his claim, which comes from his opinion, about Hag being second worst killer is wrong? He's just trying to state his opinion on how he'd rate every killer, that's what this post is meant for...for people to come in and make claims that come from their opinion freely, there really isn't a point in arguing about it.
---
yes
---
Uh. I never said I DC?
---
I don't really see what the difference is between the final survivor left getting hooked compared to getting mori'd. There is a small amount of wiggle room to escape in rare cases like DS being unused or there being no hooks left nearby but that is a very rare event. Other than those rare cases, it is effectively the exact same thing, just more satisfying for the killer.
---
you might be lucky enough to black pip if your team died under those points
---
I'm saving my shares to buy the Clown.
---
I don't buy DLC and I'm also waiting for decisive to pop up there
---
Literally the stuff of nightmares. I won't sleep tonight, thanks OP
---
Thats literally what balance is. You don't shift the experience of your entire game willy-nilly, you make incremental changes.
---
also its ‚Äúdid you just say‚Äù* not ‚Äúdid you just said‚Äù ya silly goose
---
Hex Ruin and Sloppy Butcher both reliably and paasively slow down the game for you. Both of them superior to Overcharge for longer games and better gatekeeper emblem.
---
Not before Terratorial Imperative and Shadowborn UwU
---
Welcome to dead by daylight
---
I believe their systems are sophisticated enough (and really, it‚Äôs not that hard) to know from which side the disconnection comes. They don‚Äôt have dedicated servers, but there are still two computers at play, and your PC can tell if a connection was closed from the other end. 
---
[Here‚Äôs the official site](http://www.deathroadtocanada.com/) where you can read up on it and such 
---
Actually this sounds like a very good idea to give the physical manifestation of the Entity (If ever released) this ability but instead of the dream world it would be a special rift / dimension. 
---
Also if you get headshot, the game automatically uninstalls itself.
---
hehehe
---
thank yu for the camos
---
and
---
FLICKIES
---
welcome to the somethingmunity
---
So if I meet you I will bring ivory mori special for you if you don't see any differences
---
Username checks out 
---
Because I was critiquing his list... did you not read the conversation? 
---
Is it Valentine‚Äôs Day 
---
Yah but everyone was also 100% sure that mending would work with nurses when it went live but then the devs said nah fuck y‚Äôall. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me a bit.
---
What is UWU supposed to mean? 
---
Soft? So you were hard before? So basically he's a turn off for you. 
---
Above billy? Probably. Above nurse? No. 
---
They'll just get farmed by salty killers anyways
---
Ah, that way!
---
Makes sense now, thanks.
---
It seems you didn't read what I typed and got the exact oposite point of what I said. They don't care about counterplay. Is legion good when noobs play him? No? He needs to be buffed. They give 0 craps about what a good player can do with legion. Is it viable for a noob to play him? No? Buff. Yes? Let him stay that way. That is what I said in my other comment about NOED and DS but I guess you didn't bother to read it and need it spoonfed.
---
yeah like the other noob centric perks for survivors- this is happening/kates vault/pallet one etc   
---
like i'm a rank 1 survivor but for the life of me can i hit a axe or chainsaw, no
---
That‚Äôs cool. I would personally have to disagree about sneaking up on survivors. I would say she has a greater advantage than most killers as all killers have a terror radius which allows survivors to know they‚Äôre coming and many are visible to survivors. Yes, you can hear her coming but you don‚Äôt know from where. 
---
That‚Äôs debatable, the addons would make chases brain dead easy and require no skill where as nurse still takes some level of skill to play effectively. 
---
YOU CAN LOCK CAPS ON AN IPHONE.  JUST TAP THE CAP BUTTON TWICE.
---
That's good to hear, thanks for the info I appreciate it.
---
Even if the footsteps aren't where they need to be yet, I'll take anything over the blaring chase music.
---
No rework for freddy or ds bullshit
---
NOT LIKE THAT soft i mean like he makes snuggly soft
---
Mine won‚Äôt and the autocorrect will just fuck things up. 
---
No really?
---
Actually, they are known to look at things on reddit and consider it if ideas are popular. Granted this one didn't exactly blow up but that isn't really the point.
---
Omegablink is just really good, it‚Äôs a question of quick downs and good map pressure vs very quick downs. I honestly don‚Äôt know. 
---
That game was in the middle of a string of facing try hard survivors and it was getting to him.
---
My overall opinion of him is that he's pretty much at the skill ceiling for general killer skills and is like 80% there for survivor. He's usually right about things, but he's not very articulate so sometimes he'll explain himself in a way that doesn't make sense or not at all even though his conclusion is correct. That means he's not very persuasive, so people that don't know any better will argue with him out of ignorance continuously, but he's also a competitive and argumentative person so people that like to troll will start shit in chat for lulz. 
---
Case in point, people asking him over and over again why he was running enduring/SF/bamboozle/unrelenting. At times his answer would just be "because they're the best perks" which just confused a lot of newbs, but I mean on the other hand the stream isn't DbD School either. 
---
Show me 1 idea that devs used from reedit 
---
I can't speak for the other person but I think it was less of a comment on the format and more of a comment on the year
---
u got me
---
Weird I still don't quite get it but have an idea. 
---
When are they gonna fix the issue where you grab someone, and freeze in place instead and they get to run away? 
---
yeet
---
And Blood Warden and Empathy!
---
You can tell that doctor just creamed his pants.
---
That's totally amazing !
---
It's on console, unfortunately. 
---
Please headshot me
---
TOP DEFINITION
---
Soft
---
Soft is many things. It's a feeling, and an adjective.
---
What is Soft as a feeling? It's like love, but the kind of love that makes you simply... soft. You want to stay up with your someone, you want to simply cherish them. You feel bubbly and happy and safe. You feel Soft.
---
CURRENT ON THE PTB: FREDDY'S M2 LOWERS HIS MS UP TO 101%
---
Freddy main here.  I agree.
---
People are playing Freddy wrong.
---
Play him less like an M1 killer and more like Scratched Mirror Myers and you'll do well
---
I saw someone use a syringe and styptic on a Medkit yesterday. Didn‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôd use both other than to flex
---
IM SO IRRITATED BY THE ATUPID BUG THAT MAKES YOU SURF WHEN YOU PULL DOWN A PALLET. IT TOTALLY FUCKS WITH MY ABILITY TO ESCAPE!!!! ALSO IF YOU RAGE QUIT (KILLER OR SURVIVOR) FUCK YOU!!!!!!
---
It only happens on PC, and even that is rare and pretty much does nothing or stop them. 
---
I‚Äôve been having a lot of issues with hillbilly. And suddenly everyone is playing him which is suspicious. No heartbeat, he‚Äôs using the chainsaw around corners, not being struggled by wiggling (even though they don‚Äôt have the perk on). So I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on with that character. 
---
Ok so you feel that way towards him when he does that animation is what you're saying. 
---
~~28~~ 2 stab wounds.
---
You were not critiquing his list at all, you gave no details or theory as to why you said that you thought his list was wrong, from what I see you just said that he was wrong about Hag being the second worst and wrong about Myers being that high up, that to me is you saying that his claim is wrong when he can state what he wants to and not be right or wrong about it. There's no point in arguing about it for literally an hour.
---
just in general towards him lul
---
We‚Äôre dying slowly because it takes us 4 times as long to see everything

Just in the last patch notes: Adding a timer to blood warden. Tonnes of posts about frustrations with that perk and they did what most people wanted, adding a visual timer to it. Making it so surveillance perk can distinguish between the timer running out and a survivor touching the generator, again, a very common complaint that was responded to. I'm sure if I dove into it further I would see more.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I thought your joke was funny
---
And yours checks out with my 5 yr old autistic cousin
---
But it affects other people though.
---
Few ideas don't make them a listeners
---
Then they just pick another hook.
---
I honestly dont think anyone deserves to be in the same sentence with ochido nowadays.
---
I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs not allowed to do it, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs toxic and some people don‚Äôt like that
---
At a high rank not every killer is viable, which yah you‚Äôve already heard before but I‚Äôm not gonna play pig just so I can get stomped on, I‚Äôd rather play nurse and have a good experience even if it gets a little repetitive for me.
---
Game over
---
I don‚Äôt think Ochido belongs in dead by daylight i think he should try league or something a lil more toxic
---
Yeah dude, I watch them and the gameplay is epic game after game, but that‚Äôs it. Her attitude is terrible her friends are the same. She really needs to humble herself or have it done for her 
---
Probably because of the subreddit rules. ~simply relating via the title is not sufficient~
---
More gens less hiding. If you know your teammate is in a chase or your gen is close to done, you are better off committing to the gen than hiding from the killer. If you learn how to pallet loop effectively you can buy your mates a bunch of time. Simple Jukes like running through the pallet if you know the killer will swing at you help a lot. Use items such as medkits and toolboxes to improve your healing and gen repair speed. Learn the killers and their weaknesses. Look behind you in chases. Be a good teammate and help your friends out by taking a hit for them, or making a ballsy save off the hook, they will return the favors. Save items like keys and flashlights for later, they require more skill and gamesense to use, and they also provide side objectives which keep you from going for the main one. Learn the map layouts and the tiles that contain different types of pallets and windows.
---
The slick F
---
Huntress. She's strong if the killer has the skill, but allows for counterplay from the survivors, and is very weak if she doesn't. 
---
Neither will be above Billy or Nurse for two reasons
---
1 Map pressure
---
2 Down potential and the ability to use mobility to slug and create more pressure
---
I highly doubt that Legion will remain a 2 quick hits with power + 1 hit = down, when you can ignore absolutely everything without any skill required to do so.
---
Is this during the entire time he has his power up or just when he sleeps someone? This better be a bug.
---
What does Dwight have to do with Freddy though? 
---
I don't think he should get credit for not using Ruin. Whenever I see him drop it, it's so he can get in a 4th perk to some chaser or stealth build, and is a sound tactical choice.
---
Bad english is the last thing that‚Äôll trigger me, someone said english is like 3 different languages pretending to be one wearing a trenchcoat and i couldn‚Äôt find anything more accurate.
---
Yeah, who cares about their own happiness now-a-days? I'll just go perkless at Rank 1 and derank.
---
I wonder how you did it, plus it is possible to make the killers in Death Road to Canada?
---
At the longest point of the curve - yes. Once someone is hit by the power your speed returns like usual.
---
Perkless Freddy at Rank 1 is the ultimate build, didn't you hear? üòÇüòÇ
---
Wether you chose to credit him for it or not is your choice but whenever i play survivor/SWF and the killer isnt using ruin the killer is gonna get ruined.
---
In-game character creator. I wanna make the killers but I‚Äôd need to make some pixel art and mod it in. I might eventually.
---
I WAS PLAYING KYF, THE KILLER WAS MYERS AND SOMEHOW HE STALKED THROUGH THE HAYSTACKS! BULLSHIT!
---
All depends if you feel like paying money or saving up shards instead of using them on perks
---
Get gud
---
Lol be salty all you want but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that this is a low-effort, off topic post. Goodbye.
---
I don't see how it's toxic to say x,y,z on your stream which no one is forced to watch.
---
I think the winter event sort of coincided with kids being out of school. 
---
2018?
---
Oh, thank you so much for your permission to be salty. That's what I've always needed.
---
Okay dokie.
---
Lmfao how dare they use what he wants?  so garbage, I'd be ashamed if I was them. Dude, seriously, chill out. So what if he uses NOED, do you want to cry about it? You probably complain about lunge attacks, you also probably teabag whenever you can, you also probably taunt the killer with emotes after every pallet stun, you probably wait at the gat for 20 minutes even though you could have left ages ago. 
---
Well as a killer main, it is fun (for now) at the mean time I‚Äôm just enjoying these changes. 
---
I do agree that it is no challenge and requires no skills. 
---
If a group or rank 10 survivors with 500-1000 hours were put against a rank 1 killer with 100 hours, my bet is on the rank 10s. 
---
ScottJund made a video comparing rank 10 and rank 1 gameplay, and the rank 10 gameplay was much worse than the rank 1 gameplay, that he revealed towards the end that all the clips were from rank 1s.
---
Rank 15s can be good, rank 1s can be bad. After all, rank 1 survivor just means holding m1 on a generator and hiding well when the killer comes close.
---
I heard! I should do that from now on, who cares about 'fun' anyways?
---
I know all of this. All I know is that Freddy‚Äôs license holders are pretty lenient, BHVR said they were talking with promising rights holders and if you combo buffs with cosmetics you make plenty of money.
---
I get this seemingly regardless of map/perks/killers on PS4 maybe 5% of the time.
---
Ruin is strong, and it fits well into every build that can spare a perk slot for it, but it's not the only good perk in the game. If your loadout is strong enough that you can down someone right away and give the survivors another objective, you can slow down genrush to the point that you can do without it. And hell, lots of games, Ruin will get destroyed very early and I'll still 4k.
---
This post doesn't deserve to be upvoted. It's traced.
---
The killer considers pallet looping bullying
---
I'm just trying to survive! 
---
I get that. I rarely play killer so I never get past rank 18 by reset time. Lucky for me so I dont have to deal with survivors like that. Bugs me to see my teammates bully. It's just rude and unnecessary ya feel me?
---
Then BHVR must actually fix the problem. Dont think they dont have to.
---
Well you are going to die if you intentionally take agro. It‚Äôs nice for your team when you do it but ultimately they are better off with and extra friend helping with gens than someone who goes out and is out of the game in a few minutes.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to be mean, but if you can‚Äôt loop for 5 gens straight then it‚Äôs not worth going for it at all. Loop if he found you, don‚Äôt go looking for him.
---
Dwearder has always had that shaved headline. It got removed when Clown hit (iirc) but they've put it back in now.
---
I wish they'd pick which one they want though.
---
I seem to have more of a tough game when playing rank 15 survivors. They all seem to be ballerinas, twirling about. Maybe they derank to play with newer killers.
---
Same thing that happens with Wraith. For some reason immersed survivors (who are quite common on PS4) freak out and lose the ability to play properly when the killer is invisible, and you‚Äôll do well against those people. Against people who are strong loopers it‚Äôs a different story because they understand that they have the upper hand. 
---
Pallet looping is not bullying, it is the only way for survivors to live more than 10 seconds in the chase.
---
That's what you get for being a cocky little shit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
#MakeWakeUpGreatAgain
---
Think mine is at 80% for killer.  Did try 100 but went back down a bit.  Can hit survivor 360's okay.  Was thinking of upping to 90% and see how I go.  Think best is just whatever feels good for you &amp; creep it up gently if you want, if it doesn't work after a while go back down.
---
I play battlefield too and have always had what is considered low sensitivity.  I do fine with that where others might struggle.  Higher just throws me off and I overshoot targets, even small changes on there mess me up!
---
haha :( yeah :( that‚Äôs how they‚Äôll play it off when they regress on their statement of the freddy rework 
---
I‚Äôm new to the game and this sub but I have noticed the large amounts of BS posts, silly memes etc, but hey to each their own.
---
Most likely he used tinkerer. 
---
Basically when a gen is at 85% completion, his heartbeat is gone for 8/10/12 seconds
---
i never said it was the only good perk my build on pig is iron grasp, nurses calling, make your choice, and Noed and i‚Äôve gotten plenty of 4k‚Äôs (althought im not rank 1 killer) 
---
They will nerf it hopefully, or it will become the new boring meta
---
My casual loadout is self care, adrenaline, bl and wglf (so tell me if something here is wrong). Thanks for the advice
---
The wiggle thing is global, not just Billy. I've noticed it on multiple Killers. I've also noticed as Killer that sometimes I won't start feeling a struggle for several seconds. And I had one game as Survivor where my struggle meter didn't increase for a couple seconds, then started going normally, then I suddenly escaped at only 75% of the meter. It was very weird.
---
@damnnohtml judging based on hours of gameplay I‚Äôve seen from said person. 
---
Nurse can beat coordinated SWF, nothing else comes close.
---
The entire time you're holding m2 - aside the beginning of the curve. When you sleep someone - nothing has changed, at least that I noticed. No? I've played Freddy since Day 1 and I don't ever recall him stunning himself on a sleep....
---
I'd assume cause children play this 18+ game. they enjoy ez killz and now every survivor main can just hop on Legion and think killers have less challenge due to this particular one being truly broken and not influenced by things other killers experience every game. 
---
That is strange. They definitely have a lot of things to fix and hopefully make the gaming experience better. 
---
But aren‚Äôt these what if scenarios?
---
Myers. Hes counterable and can be shut down, but can also get going hard if played well.
---
Yeah, I swear, on ps4 people will suicide or dc if you aren‚Äôt sprinting to save them two seconds after they‚Äôre hooked for the first time.  Also I think the meaning of waving your arms on the hook has become muddied as I‚Äôll start to go for a save, see them waving, and go do gens instead... and then see the killer chasing someone on the opposite side of the map.  Sorry friend, you kinda used the generally agreed upon ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being camped, go push gens‚Äù signal.
---
Honestly when I‚Äôm hooked I‚Äôd 100% rather have a match where they let me struggle my whole two minutes and die while they pushed gens then one where they all three constantly divebomb the hook and die or unhook you right in the killer‚Äôs face.  Obviously there‚Äôs a happy medium but I favor objective over excessive altruism given the choice.
---
Hes my dad!
---
leader and prove thyself are getting a buff, as followed: 
---
Prove Thyself: Increased repair speed by 10% for each other survivor working on a generator within a range of 4 meters. Gain 50%/75%/100% more Bloodpoints for coop actions. Only one Prove Thyself effect at a time.
---
I tried several times, but the scratchmarks and fps are screwing me over every damn time
---
Explain that to the killer
---
I personally don‚Äôt think so, but I thought I‚Äôd mention it because several people seem to think he is. People make the excuse of ‚Äúbut he can be pallet looped‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know. Insane map pressure, an insta down and 115% MS all seem like too much for one killer. 
---
True since my winning condition is to get my bbq stacks
---
Is this on PTB? My loading screen is them just hanging frozen
---
8
---
I was looking at the patch note why didn‚Äôt I see it
---
I wish it was possible but those are exclusive, and I think they are like a year old now on pc.
---
Hold left click on gen, learn to loop, save teammates, use up perks if you need to
---
I did not know they were lenient, but even so, cosmetics would require a contract and money, and they may not want to spend it right now, especially with the dedicated servers that will come out in the summer. A few months ago they did say they were discussing cosmetics for an unknown licensed killer and survivor with their respective license holders. If you are lucky, it could be Freddy, but I wouldn‚Äôt count my blessings.
---
My sorry ass thought hatch closing was being added in
---
I love the memes, but I would love a Wake Up buff more.
---
Don't get found first. Try to do 2 gens and safe hook rescue at least one time. Cleanse 1 hex totem or 2 dull totems. Heal anyone you come across. If you aren't good at chases being in the terror radius while not being in a chase gains points for the evader emblem.
---
I've had the same issue, but tbh it may be that due to the holidays and all, people have not been playing as much dbdl, so it is extra harder to find anyone hosting specially for a killer. 
---
THANK YOU GODDAMN IT
---
Yeah, I've figured out you are a poe. Which admittedly, is sad that there are genuine players who struggle to break out of rank 15.
---
What if I dont give a fukk bout survivors? Will I miss the only chance I get I buy the killer instead?
---
Poe? 
---
I would prefer if he didn't have that hairline. It really ruins the look.
---
WHAT ARE THE NEW CHANGES TO MY BELOVED META PERK?!
---
Nobody will ever have higher down potential than irridescent head huntress. Instant down from the other side of the map is ludicrous.
---
I'm conflicted about True. 
---
On the one hand, he's good and he's good about narrating his thought process as he plays, which then helps me develop as a player. Also, I'm a min-maxer myself, so I appreciate True's mercenary take on "winning" and "losing."
---
On the other hand, the dude seems super bored with DBD. I feel like I'm watching someone whose job is folding blank white sheets of paper in half. That's it; he just sits there all day, folding single pieces of paper in half, and he's fucking over it. So, that detracts from the experience for me because I feel like he's not interested in what he's doing. If I want to watch someone be bored at work, I'll video tape myself working.
---
I did watch a lot of True when Legion dropped to see how he would handle it, and his excitement certainly ticked up. You could feel it. Same with Last Year--he was pumped about playing that. But just standard-issue DBD? Nah, I'll stick with HybridPanda. 
---
You can see the grass moving tho
---
i used to be a meg main
---
i still do it
---
There's no counter play to legion either 
---
I upvoted all of you
---
That is actually very true. You can still see the Wraith coming tho.
---
Laughs in Nurse. 
---
I understand. I used to use that head all the time and I just got used to it.
---
I think it's important to make stuff different though, and I don't think the red glasses are enough on their own.
---
WELL THEN STOP TUNNELING, TUNNELER!
---
Also in the Illuminati Card game from 1982.
---
( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kkp3gARJEes/maxresdefault.jpg )
---
Also Trade Towers and Pentagon Bombing in that card game.

---
I don't think any of them was cocky, I witnessed true confusion. But still I see more Freddys than lets say Clowns on PS4.
---
it‚Äôs after the map changes and status effect updates. kinda in a weird spot tbh
---
I was at rank 8. Maybe going further is a different story.
---
I don‚Äôt need to. You don‚Äôt need to either. You do not need to justify your actions to your salty opponents. Do whatever you need to in order to survive, the only thing the killer can do is go on reddit and complain about survivors being overpowered. Killers have nurse, spirit, op addons, moris, hex ruin, bbqnc, hex noed and the list just goes on.
---
I‚Äôm fine with discussing overpowered tactics, items, addons, offerings, and perks, but people who complain about one of the core functions in the Game are pretty foolish. Just go out there and have fun, and if you don‚Äôt like the post match toxicity, just drop a gg in chat and leave.
---
At least someone realized it was a joke, guess I made my /s too small. Oh well! :D 
---
New game mode!
---
Nah, Iron Grasp is actually good.
---
You are right the stream is fun for the gameplay. That‚Äôs it. I literally mute the sound and don‚Äôt read chat anymore because she usually has 1.6k mindless followers 
---
Also assuming that button prompt is accurate they‚Äôre on ps4 where nurse is far, far more difficult to play than pc to the extent that people rarely touch her.
---
I wanted an ugly sweater for Freddy so bad.
---
Your username got me ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I only found it out after I suggested the same thing a couple months back, and yeah, Hello Zepp is pretty good.
---
That would be dope.
---
BECAUSE PURPLE RANKS ARE WHERE IT'S AT!
---
I hear the first one at least daily on this sub.
---
- I hate every survivor's scream because it's unnecesseraly loud.
---
- I find turning things cute extremely annoying in genersl, specially in a horror setting.
---
- I don't really care about Huntress having too many cosmetics. In fact, I think they should give more to the rest, not less to her.
---
- Completely agree on gen rushing. And I'm a Killer main.
---
- I don't understand the last one.
---
Reminds me a little of the Tango Twisted Fate skin for League of legends
---
Tbf, it takes other killers like 1 second to down injured survivors
---
What do you mean by Waifu skin C H I E F
---
Haven't played Nurse much myself, am a noob with her, but I know that if you look to the ground she'll do a very short blink, the ground kinda slows her right down to a stop.  I kept doing this by accident when I first started using her, was puzzled as I what I was doing wrong!  
---
Don't know if that's what you mean?  If a survivor runs towards you when blinking you could look to the ground maybe to not shoot off in the opposite direction.
---
I DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN!
---
If you want me to respect the 4%, a non skillful interaction based on rng, then you should respect my totem spawn.
---
My friend says that every time I start getting chased I ALWAYS lead the killer to him. Like I have some type of homing beacon on him but only as soon as I start getting chased. I don't know why it always happens but he isn't wrong, I feel bad but at the same time its kinda hilarious. So I guess I am that person unintentionally :D
---
I choose to believe that Meg is a lesbian. 
---
People have been grinding their ass off on bloodhunt, so most are taking a rest.
---
Its an interesting idea, but the big question is: why?
---
1) I think people take more issue with the earrape than the actual sound she makes
---
2) Fair enough, but I like it and others like it, so why not
---
3) I‚Äôm fairly certain other characters have more cosmetics than hunterina, I believe billy does, and maybe trapper?
---
my thoughts exactly!! Was getting impatient for new cosmetics for best girl
---
Camping and tunneling is a feature, not an exploit or a bug. It is an intended mechanic and the devs have been very explicit that you cannot be banned for it.
---
SMOKEEEEYYYYYYYY
---
SAY IT LOUDER!
---
The Legion buff only effects injured players. Just heal and it's irrelevant. And NOED already got tweaked recently.
---
GOING TO PROBABLY TRYHARD THIS EVENT GET TO RANK 1 KILLER FOR THE SAKE OF CHEEVO GOT RANK 1 SURVIVOR LAST EVENT
---
I MEAN KILLER QUEUE TIMES ARE GOING TO BE 4 YEARS LONG THOUGH
---
Probably bugged given its not announced anywhere
---
I always found streamsniping to be interesting on that list. I get why they do it, it is basically impossible to prove, but still, it seems to be in odd company to the others.
---
Its the extremely generous reach of his chainsaw that bugs me. 
---
If even 1 pixel goes near you it connects.
---
Why is dwight jimmy my grade 11 science teacher.....
---
Cheeto dust makes me type the darndest things.
---
Thats true, maybe after completing a task you gain haste for 10 seconds or something.
---
sure are a lot of people with no previous reddit history here hmmm
---
One can hope
---
Since the killers know that atm they get a full lobby in seconds they are picky. Too much Prestige cosmetics = bye bye, one flashlight =bye bye 
---
IF THERES A DC ON START IM GONNA LET YOU FARM. DONT BE A FUCKING ASSHOLE AND TAKE ALL THE PALLET STUNS THEN LEAVE WHEN I TRY TO GET YALL ALTRUISM POINTS
---
ALSO DONT FUCKING MESSAGE ME AFTER THE GAME BEING TOXIC CUZ I MORI'D YOU FOR A DAILY I NEED MY DAMN FARM TOO. LOST A PIP, A MORI AND AN IRIDESCENT KING AND YOU WANT TO CALL ME A FUCKING TERRIBLE PERSON!
---
FARMING GOES ALL WAYS FOR SURV AND KILLERS YOU MONGOLOID
---
My Hag stocked up during the Winter. 88 Ebonies. That's like 4 livers a mori
---
no he doesnt run towards me, lets say hes running towards point a. I blink to point a but by the time i get there hes running to point b. They wait till i cant see them then completely turn around. Problem is i cant commit to point b or theyll just go to point a.
---
Present!
---
Aww
---
Yeah, if the Legion had basic attacked it would have made more sense. But the key is to imagine that the Legion was further away and engaging in a chase with Claudette. The survivor could use windows or pallets in that scenario, but those are ineffective against Legion.
---
Now picture all the times your team actually found it few minutes into the game.
---
They borrow em from Joey and Frank
---
I‚Äôve literally never heard it, but I‚Äôm glad others share the opinion
---
*onnnnk*
---
Yes this is my first post dude, I‚Äôm not a social media person but I had to get in on his convo cause I love the game and I like her gameplay. I know that‚Äôs hard to believe, you must think This is a burner account or whateva but it‚Äôs not. Not everyone spends their time on socials. 
---
I just got Death Road, so I'm going to be adding all of these.
---
Michael's is so adorable
---
Pig is pretty cute too
---
You are right, and I think it is because you *choose* to stream and know what can happen if you do
---
That's fine, I just know you were obviously linked this from elsewhere by someone directly involved so its kinda...well yeah.
---
About the gen rushing thing, in my opinion its ideed survivors focusing on their only objective, the only reason its called gen rushing its because in higher ranks survivors dont tend to "completly focus on the objective" making it seem its a strategy to only focus on objectives. The only problem i find with "gen rushing" its that in lower ranks as killer, in most killers you have to use hex ruin to not get a 5 minute game, thats my only complain about it.
---
Love it
---
A bunch of advice posts I saw kept saying use Dwight, no clue why though. 
---
It‚Äôs called unpopular opinions, you don‚Äôt have to provide counter points
---
I think the best Disconnect screenshot I got was when a guy named "Killer Kills = I DC" and a guy named "all kilerz r fagos" were right beside eachother on the Survivor list and both DCed when they were hooked in the basement.
---
Heh.. I did play her, I was good with her.. then I bought legion and the pink haired Susie skin... Sooooo... Yeah.. I still like her and will going to play with her after I get bored of legion. But that's not going anytime soon I afraid. :'D
---
Wanna Join the Legion Legion discord? [https://discord.gg/FzajsPB](https://discord.gg/FzajsPB)
---
Nah, you get one perk. And its overcharge.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean Huntress should get less cosmetics, but she does seem to have a consistent stream of them coming out and I think some others could do with some more
---
God people complain about anything. The event might suck but its nice that the game is always shifitng its been a while since the last event. If people dont want to buy dlc fine but it shouldnt restrict which characters can get cosmetics. 
---
Dont play during the event if you hate them so much

WAITING TIL A SURVIVOR CROSSES THE GODDAMN MAP BEFORE PULLING YOUR BITCH ASS OFF WHEN YOU STILL HAD TIME HANDICAPPING G YOURSELF FOR OVER A MINUTE. PULLING YOURSELF OFF AS SOON AS THE KILLER TURNS AROUND TO IMMEDIATELY GET YOURSELF ANOTHER HOOK! WASTING MY GODDAMN TIME. 
---
New ds buff
---
Survivors struggle to pip if the killer sucks, low ranks is a pain to rank up. You have to get a safe unhook and do a few gens and have a half decent chase
---
I'm kind of glad people as pathetic as you exist. You're a great self esteem boost. No matter badly my life turns out, at least I'm not you.
---
Poor Fred
---
Are you being toxic? Because sometimes killer that usually dont camp will if you are toxic. 
---
15 minutes tho, tl;dw please? 
---
I got the game itself on christmas sale + halloween :D!
---
I agree with the gen rushing (and I'm a killer main)
---
I don't get it when other killers get angry over gen rushing, it's the killers job to stop this from happening and it's the survivors to keep it up
---
Theres like 2 pallets on auto its not that bad 
---
I cried 
---
Hence the flair.
---
fair enough.
---
yikes.
---
I think it will always be more to do that than to get it all from packs.
---
$10 v. $8 over, what, 7-8 DLC packs?
---
Unless you get like $14-$16 extra in Auric Cells, when buying around $56-$64, it's gonna be a waste.
---
What made Claudette start at half deep wound? That‚Äôs bs
---
I'm literally just asking for a single clip of her being needlessly mean to someone. As in, unprovoked, complete bitch for no reason. Her call someone who is giving her shit a dumbass isn't toxic.
---
If she does this so often it should be really easy to just find a single clip. Just *one*
---
You win!
---
If you derank, you are a jerk and don't care about the community because you enable this sort of behavior and attempt to normalize it. This behavior leads to scummier play on both sides of the coin and does nothing but foster hatred within the community.
---
Still no stake out? Guys I‚Äôll just die.
---
Besides mediocre twitch entertainment? Maybe learn from the machine get ideas on perk set ups etc. See if the A.I. prioritizes points or 4ks to see what another "being" thinks is a win or a loss.
---
I am a killer main, I don't know this person, but from what you told, I do not agree with their behavior
---
Pretty good summary. I disagree tho.
---
Tombstone Myers had an opinion on this.
---
The dlcs go on sale all the time for 30% off which is $4.89 so I would look so that on isthereanydeal.com
---
Agreed, romance shouldnt be a thing in this game. However, killers can apparently still things certain things and the nurse and the wraith having a thing kinda make sense. They share a similar backstory (driven mad by their work/snapping) and they use the same realm for their power (the spirit world), meaning that they probably met there already. I had a hard time understanding how their relationship could work but I guess those are the reasons why???
---
They should leave and get the game over with.
---
I got them all for arround 20‚Ç¨
---
the fact that this thread and numerous other threads about her say all the same thing (and everyone is saying it) is enough proof that she does what she does. She knows she's toxic. That is why she has those passive aggressive titles on twitch. The fact that everyone is saying the same thing should make it pretty clear.  I hate when people ask for proof bc they know none of us are going to spend time looking through her stream, cutting footage and then posting it here. She bitches that her viewers don't grow at the speed she wants. i wonder why. She leaves those passive aggressive titles, has posts made about her, videos on YT made about her (which is how i found this thread) and many other things. You dont need proof. You need to be less biased.

I wasn‚Äôt being rude. I was simply pointing out that she was clearly also pictured as being with someone else.

Nurse is NOT balanced at all. She‚Äôs broken LUL. 
---
100%

On huntress about 80%
---
Same for clown if i had him

JUST DOING MY DAILY RITUAL: COMPLETE 2 SACRIFICE WITH THE CLOWN.

LOAD INTO GAME, 1 DC. I FIND ANOTHER, HIT HER ONCE AND SHE JUST DC. FOUND THE 3RD GUY, DOWNED HIM AND HE ALSO DC. NICE, NOW I HAVE TO DO ANOTHER KILLER ROUND, THX TO ALL THESE WEAK WILLED PPL

Start where your comfortable and then slowly increase it until its maxed, faster turn rate in ANY game is beneficial. Once at 100 you'll wish it could go higher.

I think Julie is better than Susie so I agree

Ace Main Big Brain

Even if they are just intermediate in skill, having 3 throws of a long range instant down attack is enough to call her at least close to, if not S tier.
---
Oh nvm just found out greenmangaming has 30% discount for all dlcs atm :D
---
Tunneling is just doing the objective efficiently, it's the killer's version of gen rush. 
---
It was the only Dwight head I used. :(
---
I really don't get his Bricky 2.0 content. I guess "it's not for me".
---
Something for April fools day
---
Yes that would actually be very handy!
---
I agree with this, Freddy is really good with add ons but still not comparable to other killers though
---
Imagine coming back from a few months break from dbd and you're a killer main and you go into a game with the cannibal and his bitch ass starts humming üòÇ
---
Meg is absolutely a lesbian. Agreed 100%, and Dwight is a bi icon.
---
NOED is annoying and balanced but I have to blame my failures on something other than myself. /s
---
Freddy usually wrecks my ass 9 times out of 10. But then again, I'm shit rank.
---
Ok but how about huntress with the clowns laugh
---
Me. She‚Äôs strong, ive got her p3, but her strength is entirely dependent on the framerate
