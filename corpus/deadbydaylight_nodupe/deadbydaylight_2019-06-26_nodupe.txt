Everyones saying the Myers is dumb, but to me it looked like he was playing with his food and then letting him go. Did anyone notice at the end that he picked him up and then immediately dropped? And noed on an instadown killer? While he's already in T3? Seriously guys?

Wake Up abuser ! Shame on you.
---
By buff I mean him after the ptb cuz he was worse that's what I ment by buff
---
Wish there was crossplay! Fingers crossed it‚Äôll happen in the future üòä
---
I really hate how downed and especially hooked survivors can still reveal you
---
Yes but closing the hatch gives points to you and him, and letting you wiggle free gives you points.
---
Look again.
---
He closed the hatch on me.
---
He shook his head to say "no" while I was opening the gate.
---
He decided to keep moving me away from the gate.
---
Ace in the Hole? Again?
---
Suckkks
---
Well, he could have melted your ass multiple times (evidence from the amount of red glow on your back during chase) he also could have destroyed your butthole while opening the gate. He was messing with you. Taking you back in the trial and making you run. 
---
Like I said, I do this all the time. He also closed hatch because he wanted points/mess with you. You did nothing impressive.
---
I know there will be a shitstorm of downvotes but thats ok. Tough to swallow pill.
---
Appreciate it! Yea I just told the artist I wanted some scratchy text and this is what we procured.
---
No BBQ, and No Ruin.
---
Such is the life of a new killer main.
---
I saw that. I'm just saying as a killer myself I have done that just to mess with a survivor and then let them go.
---
It wouldn't really have mattered if I didn't have a
---
Adrenaline, would it?
---
If he wanted to let me wiggle free, he'd have done it at the exit.

---
I'm holding on for bbq but with the sale I might just get Bubba, Myers, and Clown
---
Idk about 50% but maybe like 25% so 6750 shards
---
I did hear a rumor about it happening but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true
---
a. Yes you will get these all the time unless you cater to everyone‚Äôs irrational needs
---
b. Shirtless Myers is hot and we need him in game
---
This actually made me cackle üíÄüíÄ
---
If he had both swords at the same time then yes.
---
Perhaps, but you're dismissing a plethora of other possibilities in order to jump to that conclusion.
---
i could have gotten wake up XD
---
went ahead and removed this cause someone beat you to it https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c5hwg3/shrine_of_secrets_62519/
---
Just the toxic community it‚Äôs a very competitive game where one side is never gonna be happy no matter what just ignore them or kill them with kindness. And as far as shirtless Myers goes. Bow before our lord and savior.
---
I think you've completely misinterpreted the post here, bud.
---
Point out anywhere where I claimed that I did anything impressive, you'll have an easier time finding Hitler's left ballsack.
---
Yep, he could have. He instead decided to act like a dick, and have me die by the endgame timer, which didn't work out because he panic picked me up.
---
I'll be honest, I couldn't care less what you do as a killer. Not every killer plays like you.
---
I mean I‚Äôve been in his situation, I would play a few games and one game people would start to lag near the end and I would just get harassed by a group of people for ‚Äúlag switching‚Äù I think you were being a bit salty but you weren‚Äôt as bad as what I‚Äôve had to deal with
---
I was talking about the L and T loop.
---
And as a killer myself, I disagree.
---
No idea but I‚Äôm curious
---
Typical? Depends. Easy answer is yes but it's more complicated than that but I don't have the time to write an essay but I will say that not everyone is like that and to just ignore/report those that are like that. As for the side note.....memes.....yeah that's pretty much all I can say bout that side note.....lotta memes.
---
Yeah the artist NAILED it‚ÄîAmanda is impeccably done, to boot! 
---
Did you get this piece cuz of your love for DBD, or for her role in Saw?
---
survivors are invisible while phase walking
---
I can relate.
---
I second the gentleman‚Äôs motion for BIG DADDY MYERS to finally be shirtless. 
---
Also- this game has a rep because of all the memes and YouTube clips of people acting a fool in the post game chat... it‚Äôs mostly 12 year olds, frat guys with popped collars, and people who have overly irrational opinions on how the game ‚Äúshould be played‚Äù.... don‚Äôt let it get to you.
---
Just the way he/she holds their hands forward while moving looks kinda silly, although I‚Äôm not actually sure if it varies from each other (I only based it off of Susie‚Äôs waking animation).
---
It‚Äôs a bug with the blade addons. Slows down vault speed, gen speed, etc. Devs are banning for it.
---
Agreed I presume they‚Äôve put this in place to not make him anotherLF who can sit at the hook and one down any un-hookers... but hey, we all know what to do if LF is camping the hook.....
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 years and got maybe 2-3 hateful message ! It‚Äôs really d√©pend I guess.
---
This is so stupid. This bug has been in the game for years and they still can‚Äôt fix it. This shows the testers at BHVR just don‚Äôt care and just push content out too be content.
---
I swear I just bought ace in the hole from the shrine a few cycles ago.
---
Yeah I bought bubba back during the double BP event since BBQ is apparently very rare in terms of shrine appearances.
---
You assume that people are just THAT good. Never really had a problem with OoO and I don't think anyone had really a problem with it.
---
A coordinated SWF team will already know what the Killer is doing and will be applying gens pressure without that perk because they have coms anyway. A solo player with OoO is just useless.
---
There was one game where I went on a search for ruin, found and cleansed ruin, the killer found me and then I looped him for at least 3 minutes. Not a single gen was done in that time. Everyone was healthy too so no one was healing either. I still wonder what the hell they were doing.
---
No I was lagging lagging. I mean everytime he would hit me I would rubber band so hard that I would run into a wall. When he‚Äôd hook someone the survivor would just pop up into the hook and he would disappear
---
RuSh In ThErE AnD SaVe HiM DuH
---
I was thinking about this build: thanatophobia (because healing against legion is stupid), bamboozle (idk if it works with feral frenzy), spirits fury (if legion still breaks pallets when vaulting them), and enduring (because stunning is so 2017)
---
So you dont have to waste time stalking (in this example)
---
Did the hotfix come out yet?
---
not to bad.
---
If you stop for about 2 seconds after ruin hits, then you won't get a skill check in the brief period of time when you can't progress the gen. Makes ruin a little easier to work with.
---
ya that too
---
is there a thread somehwere on this subreddit where I can post my perk builds and get advice on them or should I make a new post? I don't really know how to use reddit yet so if one does exist I'm having a hard time finding it lmao
---
look at the shrine every week
---
They are? I don‚Äôt remember them saying that.
---
Here too
---
Did you really just photoshop the event offers and ebony mori's? oof
---
Even one of the blade add-ons will slow down things like gen and vault speed (it happened to me last night).
---
For Both! I‚Äôm a bit of a horror fan. Was super stoked when they introduced her as a playable killer!
---
You actually had them already when they were both up, no way for them to escape unless you downed someone.
---
This thread is a perfect place to do that!
---
Worth it if you like to have a lot of bp at the end, it's not really good at chases and you might want to run Sloppy butcher + thanatophobia on him and try to not focus on just 1 survivor and injure all 4 if you can, if you get a big map like pale rose or the forest you are fucked, but if you get the game or lery ur most likely to get a 3 or 4k. I love Legion and it has a lot of potential until you know how to play it, i usually destroy SWF with him and the rage at the end because sloppy and thanato piss the off is priceless.
---
Believe what you wish. Panic pick up...lmfao. These made up terms get me everytime
---
It would be broken.
---
I hope they have a big sale for cosmetics soon.
---
I mean, it's a combination of two pre-existing phrases. That's kind of how sentence structure works.
---
Well, you know what they say, idiots are amused by anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know. But I tend to lose them when I do. I always phase back in the other direction. Is there some sort of trick to keeping better track of them?
---
Go to the "fuck you" message, hit options, hit report and report him. It's super easy, he will get a warning by the PSN team and if he does it again he will get banned.
---
It does, and so does Wake Up. I love 3.0.0
---
I know that but i will fix that in the next update ^^
---
Who is Peantis? I only know Peanits.
---
Removed for salty after game chaf
---
I know I'm doomed by teammates when I walk to a chest and see a flashlight was left behind
---
&gt; Tunneling is part of the game and doesn't justify a rage quit.
---
Dying on hook is also part of the game, and farming someone off of a hook is not reportable.
---
Shit a typo
---
Which is exactly why I bought that skin and main her, there is at least 1 non-toxic pink haired Nea my good sir.
---
You do realize this is r/deadbydeadlight, the home of beating dead memes.
---
I love how you could see the effect of it when his mask was forced off, yet he cared more about his mask than his eye.
---
Spine Chill doesnt work against Tier 1 myers
---
4 man SWF with flashlights is like having a hex ruin always on, since at least 2 people want their flashy flashlight plays.
---
Just don‚Äôt use the exploit.
---
really? i was hoping for something good not fucking trash.
---
Git gud
---
Probably just bugged. My Huntress has had double stacked Ebony Moris for a while.
---
This is how I play on my pc.
---
Personally I think you were both salty. You didn't have to reply to it with a rant like that.
---
Best thing to do it look for scratch marks, listen for breathing or if on a map with grass look for the grass moving. Also if they are injured listen for grunts
---
Oh... my mistake. Sorry.
---
what does 4k stand for? i see it used a lot, four thousand?
---
also i just bought him and got a 4man kill and 65000 bp(with the gruesome geatue, ty entity)  after a 30mins match, i got gen rushed hard but by the time there was one generator left they were all close together and i had hooked them all at least once so overtime i got em all.
---
Sparks Oink\*
---
He's powerful cuz he's buggy
---
That lunge tho
---
"Wake Up!" Is supposed to let you open the gates faster. There's a bug that showed up recently that makes you do *everything* faster (healing, repairing, sabotaging, cleansing totems, etc.)
---
It nerfed the parts of ghost face that people use and help him win, and buffed the parts that no one care's about and doesn't help him win. Sounds like a nerf to me tbh
---
Ok thank you
---
this is an INSULT to all killer mains
---
how dare thou
---
Lmao some of the shit people come up with really makes me question if they've even bothered playing the
---
urghhhh why can't any of Jeff's perks go on the Shrine? Aftercare was there once but apparently it was bugged or something and i couldn't get it
---
Just remove the wind noise bhvr, please, nerf him anyway you want just give him stealth
---
No he‚Äôs one of the better killers.
---
I think even though they said that it's still a lot bigger
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Yea np
---
So uh... You know if it came out yet?
---
Ok cool. But it could've worked out a lot worse. You shouldn't have rehooked the survivor, blood warden came close to running out.
---
This is epic.
---
"more work will be done to make sure hits look like they are connecting."
---
Bro you just posted cringe you are going to lose subscribers
---
None of them are rank 20.  Also, didn't you notice the rank 2 with the flashlight?  Yeah, it was as painful as it sounds.
---
Myers in tier 2 with m&amp;a has a terror radius of 8 meters that comes back whenever not in a chase, ghostface's terror radius is 32 meters with a stealth ability with a huge cooldown, it makes an 8 (or bigger) directional wind noise, tell me which is better, at least with myers you can't tell where he's coming from with sound alone.
---
I can‚Äôt hear you, I‚Äôm too busy getting 4ks against a team of survivors who bring items.
---
The boots say howdy but the rest screams at you.
---
EAC doesn't comment on the agreements with any contracted party.
---
Blood amber can be nice but yeah most of it‚Äôs add on abilities are just perks
---
Might get dead hard to save points on lvling david.
---
Idk I‚Äôve never done that
---
Yes. He‚Äôs bad. Ask any good killer player and they‚Äôll tell you he‚Äôs lower tier.
---
What is griefing?
---
Yeah that mechanic is definitely an attempt to curb simply camping with him and waiting there to expose the saver.  I'm glad it's in there for this reason.
---
DBD: death is not an escape
---
Survivor: hold my toolbox
---
No endgame chat on console
---
Wait.
---
Wait wait.
---
Where can I get the body pillows - and is there already a Ghostie one?
---
Asking for a friend
---
That's why we dont see them around anymore. Ghe entity nerfed them.
---
Huntress and David have body pillows in the dbd merch store.
---
Nope.
---
Well this was a good way to burn an hour and 20 minutes of my time.

I think he wants some special treatment for playing the game lmao
---
Bing Boii is easily the most fun killer in the game for both sides in my opnion
---
Hell, he was pretending to be an idiot the entire movie and it worked completely
---
Nea we need to talk...

About how I'm the entity?

Dont say that out loud!!!

lol what movie is that from?
---
2500 more BPs in the devionuss catagory for no one escaping does look tempting...
---
Every action is 15% faster not just open gates. Generators,healing,unhooking, vaulting you name it.
---
He was Injured. He didn't even need to stalk
---
Oh good!
---
Basically my current survivor build is Self Care, Adrenaline, Iron Will and dark Sense (All tier 3) but I've been wanting to change it up for a while but I just don't really know what perks combo well these days. Only real reason I use SC and Adrenaline is because almost everyone seems to, yknow they're the perks the Big Boys use, but more often than not the opportunities to use them almost never come up, especially for adrenaline (except when I take it off, same with unbreakable and other perks like that, the second I stop using it I find myself in the situation where it'd be perfect because I'm forever cursed by Sod's Law lmao) so just wanted to see other people's takes and their builds that have worked for them, what they think I should try instead of self care and adrenaline etc.
---
Would like some killer build tips too although since I run different killers with different builds it's more annoying to list them so my mains are Trapper (Agitation, Bitter Murmur, Barbecue, Iron Grasp) and Huntress (Devour Hope, Lullaby NOED, Iron Grasp) both recently prestiged so their builds are kinda unfinished right now, I'm not proud of having NOED on Huntress but don't have much else unlocked right now that isn't tier 1 lmao
---
He's above average I'd say. He has one of the best loop denial abilities, but that's about it.
---
thx I'll switch it out for another perk when i get on
---
What makes a Spirit sweaty? Powerful add-ons?
---
perk replaces her name
---
Wow they were idiots.
---
The devs nerfed it into a state of being a shit tier perk, because of the new hatch mechanic and which let's the last survivor open the exit doors to possibly escape, they said they wanted the last survivor to "still have a chance" so they gutted the perk, even though they could have just put a condition on the perk for it to not activate if only 1 survivor is left, but no, they just gutted it, it's worthless for its intended situation, and ironically even in the gutted version a last survivor alive still probably wouldn't be able to open the door, so congrats bhvr, you ruined a perk for literally no reason.
---
130% movement speed....
---
What 
---
Traps are pretty much insta downs?
---
I love Xbox
---
Legion‚Äôs great if you know how to use him. They spreads out damage very nicely and can secure a down quicker than most M1 killers if you can mind-game well.
---
‚ÄúKiLLeRs ArE aLwAyS tHe PrObLeM‚Äù
---
Yeah but if he wasnt then it would be useful because as a killer, you wont know for a fact that the survivor(s) would be injured at the end
---
He's average, his power doesn't have any mobility but it helps in chases.
---
I don't wanna face the doctor either lol
---
Mickey was the cutest killer :o
---
Just playing the game as killer in your rank is "picking on babies"?
---
Sounds are more important, you could consider stridor if you're really looking for a tracking perk for phasing.
---
Lmaooo the sped up moaning and grunting made it so much more hilarious.
---
HAHAHA WHAT A FUCKER I love it!
---
Nice ink !
---
reported for bribing the Killer
---
In my opinion, his power is boring. But it can defintely deny loops.
---
I can‚Äôt verify it but clearly it isn‚Äôt banning people so it‚Äôs safe in my books.
---
That's cheating isn't it? I mean I'd Iove to watch their point of view AFTER the round, doesn't matter for me anyways, can't really find twitchies on console.
---
gimme some downüÖ±Ô∏èotes
---
Well, that's a shit shrine.
---
"The egc will stop survivors from holding the game hostage"
---
4k mean 4 kills, it may get a bit frustrating as you rank up, but when you get the hand of the killer you are most likely unstoppable (beware the 4 man survive with friends squadette). Remember that legion is not really a chase killer, because it can be looped very easy (it moves as the same speed as trapper if you are wondering, and 5% faster in frenzy) and his power is for slowing down the game, not for chases. His best addons are the ones that add more time to the power and the ones that recharge it faster, you can make different builds depending if you are gonna use the addon "iridescent button" or the "mending simulator with the knifes", i personally like the mending one. Good luck in your games!
---
Considering I have only 300 shards after some recent week purchases, this makes me happy :)
---
Only when I need it. The gates open when I already have something of course.
---
Getting all the perks after you have all teachables is even worse. I think we just need to earn more bloodpoints.
---
I‚Äôve just been waiting for bbq and chili
---
Okay is that all you can say? Because if so, then it  only goes to show how apparent right I am about you. Maybe get off reddit? Get your life together. You can do it.

Lol.

I knew David did, but huntress has one too? Asking for a friend as well.
---
130% OR instadown ... not both. 
---
Think about what Nurse, spirit and Billy can do.
---
Why take Trapper if he can't at least compete against them?  He doesn't need to be better he just needs to be scary.
---
I agree I'm starting way to the extreme but seriously,  he needs help.  Or we can just ignore him and wait for Freddy.
---
I have really good internet and an ethernet cable and I got harassed by an SWF group for about half an hour yesterday for ‚Äúlag switching‚Äù I think some survivors are blaming bad frame drops on lag or something.

And I oop moment for sure
---
One question: why do you hate bubba?
---
Jk, but giving a buff and then giving a weakness to that buff seems silly.
---
I think bubba should be buffed by increasing his movement speed while revving his chainsaw, his concept is hes SUPPOSED to be a Billy without map pressure but has a easier time downing people
---
**but he's not**
---
Billy is way better at backrevving survivors, all you need is to not be an idiot and put SOME skill and thought into your saws. And bubba is literally just the worst if both worlds
---
***anything bubba does Billy can do better***
---
(Except for facecamping)
---
So my suggestion is to buff his ability to chainsaw survivors, ACTUALLY make him more capable of insta downing survivors, make him better than Billy in that aspect.
---
No, it's part of the balance of the game.
---
For survivor, I've really been starting to run empathy over spine chill / dark sense and the other tracking perks. I find it to be incredibly useful because you can usually see from over 128 metres if the killer is in a chase with another survivor as well as allowing you to find fellow survivors when they are injured. Iron will is in my opinion overrated, especially when run with self care, I would suggest if you want to use Iron will for an immersion build (focused on stealth) then you will want to also be running urban evasion so that you can be mobile while also discrete.  
---
Adrenaline is a very strong perk but again doesn't synergize too well with self care since half of the benefit will be lost and if you aren't in a chase or on the ground, then the speed burst won't be very helpful.  
---
Those are just my opinions. For reference my standard build is: Self care, Empathy, Balanced landing, and Urban Evasion.
---
  
---
I REALLY think that empathy is underrated in this community, at least when playing solo. The knowledge it gives is incredibly powerful if you aren't playing survive with friends.
---
No its impossible he is like a foot tall
---
Tier 2 is like the least scary, because then he's just like any other killer.
---
Tier 1 is spooky because you usually dont expect it.
---
Tier 3 is fucking horrifying because he can one-shot you.
---
funnily enough, most of my teammates and I at red ranks dont use self care at all. its just a bunch of wasted time. adrenaline is good because if there is one gen left, it encourages survivors to push for adrenaline rather than heal. i would recommend switching SC for bond. i try to use new builds all the time, but some of my go to's are adrenaline, ds, bt, and balanced landing, or the same thing with dead hard instead of borrowed time. the movement stun reduction that BL gives you is good enough that you can use it with dead hard, and having both gives you options when you are in a sticky situation. usually when you are in a situation where adrenaline isnt useful, its a result of your own actions. if you heal when there are only 1-2 gens left with no ruin, then obviously the perk is not going to be useful 9/10
---
People will complain about literally anything. Obviously there are situations where it‚Äôs advantageous to camp (like the one you just gave).
---
NOED has no downside and a huge upside is why, plus people think it's sneaky when it's totally not sneaky anymore
---
No, no I dont
---
Why has it suddenly gotten so bad? Just a combination of a new killer with no new survivor, and then double bloodpoints?
---
He let you go. He could have killed you at any point. 
---
Just because he closed the hatch doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt want you to escape. 
---
Just because he shook his head doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt want you to escape.
---
So Trapper just stays put towards the bottom?
---
I admit 130% is extreme but I'm trying to get something for the poor guy.  As you point out, his power is fundamentally weak.
---
If u want to play send ur username in the comments
---
Only way to buff him that wouldn't make him too good would be to make his traps darker, let him carry more, or just have them be open to start.
---
LOL @ the DC because they screwed up.
---
Feng Min lmao üòÇ 
---
I started with her because she had technician and I was always failing skill checks so it was useful
---
If he wanted you to die, he would have slugged you at the gate and let EGC run out.
---
But yeah man you‚Äôre so right. He chased you around the map running by hooks because he didn‚Äôt want you to escape /s
---
I was almost disappointed until the very last moment
---
I agree, although I'm not sure your ideas would be the best.
---
If I had to pick buffs for Trapper I'd go:
---
-Make standard traps color darker.
---
-Start with 2 traps always.
---
-Traps cannot be sabotaged.
---
-get Traps from lockers.
---
Then adjust add ons accordingly, an boom he's better then ever before.
---
I'm a red rank Trapper main an these would be perfect IMO to make him better but not broken.
---
Trapper will never be at Billy and Nurse potential, he doesn't have map pressure because he's built for map denial/control. 
---
If we didnt have to waste time traveling the entire map to get all of our power at our disposal, unlike any other killer, he'd have better chances at higher ranks.
---
It would be interesting to see them incorporate him and make him climb up crates and be a very fast killer
---
Yeah, same. I already own every character. Would personally buy so many more cosmetics if they weren't so expensive.
---
its ok if youre not very good with nurse but a good nurse is extremely OP and survivor have no chance but to hide and its boring
---
Yeah lol. I ended up with a 3k. I let the last guy go because of the dc.
---
Yes on Xbox here

---
Play the game how you want. People are going to cry afterwards anyway. If they are going to camp the hook trying to farm teammates as soon you walk away that's on them.  You're going to want people to get unhooked though. The more hits and hooks you do in a match the more BP you get
---
He'd be a cross between legion and pig crouching
---
He fucking deserved that
---
Trapper tip, don't chase people unless it's the tail end of the game or your sure you can get a quick hit/down. 
---
Spend time locking down a set of generators at the beginning of the match an make them come to you and your traps.
---
To be fair, for it being a Scream parody, Scary Movie did have one of the better Ghost Face reveals over any other imo.
---
I had a similar situation a few hours ago. It's end-game, a Laurie's hooked, and sure as hell I'm not leaving her (especially since I can literally see some of the others nearby). She dies, then in the post-match chat, another survivor had the gall to say something along the lines of "never camp". Like, I'm just supposed to let her go and let you guys waltz out the door? I don't think so.
---
This been happening me as well, even before GF update yet they ain't fix it..pitiful.
---
I'd love to him get some love from the dev team, too long have we Trapper mains suffered lol
---
the benefit of killer face camping, the survivors can forget about rescue and use the time the killer is giving them by not playing the game by doing multiple gens, sure you'll lose a survivor- but better lose one than three.
---
In my personal experience at rank 5+ i have seen only 1 person running it if any at all, the people running it are clowns who look to only depip the killer with no skill involved. I understand Wake Up ruins the killers game and such especially with the stupid fuckin long queue times. But the addons made it physically impossible with old legion to mend or do anything without going down with no counter. I think if the same bug was in with new legion and deep wounds less would complain because you can always stall the bar. I don't disagree with it being stupid and broken, but i still don't find it as dumb as the addons.
---
How about releasing the goddamn hotfixes patch?
---
Literally 15 minutes ago I was in a match as doctor leaving the hook when I saw a meg running up to free the teammate. Zapped her off then hooked her nearby. Got a message right after they died bitching about camping. Like alright, am I just supposed to stand there and patiently watch you save the fucker?
---
Survivor or killer? Also which platform? Cuz some dlc are free on console
---
I cant afford gold, so here üèÖ
---
Beat ur ü•© I guess
---
Is there anything that says the entity can't take dead or dying people? I know Rin and Bill were on the verge of death
---
LOL! Your response wins!
---
PC, and I am not sure, I am interested in the whole experience.
---
Dang, this has only happened to me after GF update. They need to step up their game with all these bugs
---
* **Rule 6** - Support Post 
---
* Looking for group posts - Use /r/dbdLFG.
---
I guess he could just drag them to the hook by their ankles or something
---
Entity takes whoever they want whenever they want. A lot of times they take them right before death or when they're going to die as that is one of their lowest moments and the entity feeds on hope. 
---
Quinten for example was filled with anger before the entity took him and probably wanted to make quinten a killer until the entity chose Freddy instead.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any of those really for doc. I strongly suggest even if you don‚Äôt play her, level up hag for ruin. Distressing and unnerving presence is a fun combo that won‚Äôt work on expert survivors, but new and even decent survivors will be thrown off, so I‚Äôd recommend getting unnerving from trapper. And if you can spring for bubba, you will love the points you get from BBQ and will really help you level up a lot faster. Enduring from hillbilly is also great, especially on killers like doc who need to hit survivors twice to down them.
---
Also, don‚Äôt worry about red ranks or anything if you are brand new. Just have fun with the game.
---
Yeah, definitely don‚Äôt take this as an example. I was too excited to see two pallet in one tile (a bit nostalgic) and didn‚Äôt really care about try-harding. But I could maybe find some clips of me shitting on people for you? If that may help :)
---
Fuck killers like him. It makes my blood boil. They whine about tbag, which is harmless but then okay with blatant grieving like this.
---
You either kill the survivors or you live long enough to t bag at the gate
---
I've only seen the 1st movie and the remake and it's a bit difficult finding the other films but I think it would be awesome to see him and her work together
---
Removes the hooking scream suprised the don't just make jakes perks sound denial.
---
Do you realise Doofy was the best killer?
---
He not only managed to kill people, he got the chick and escaped without any injury.
---
Man, I would be at that tile for hours. Leave Jakey alone. He smol boi.
---
It's an achievement so go to achievements and it should say a number or %. Since the goal is 100, any percent would be the number of hits
---
The hooked survivor will be camped. Cause that's an auto 2 sacrifices
---
To add to this if you and the survivor are close and they try to jump in you cant grab anymore however closing the hatch takes priority so if they jump in and your right on them you can close it before they escape
---
If they add Chucky, I demand Gremlins next.
---
For killers, I‚Äôd recommend Myers/Ghostface for the jumpscare
---
Bubba for the bps farm (bbq teachable) 
---
Maybe a clown for brain game
---
Freddy and Pig aren‚Äôt that much worth it same for plague and legion
---
As survivors, dlcs aren‚Äôt important unless you want to main a precise character from your favorite horror movie or a build
---
Leatherface, Flesh and mud.
---
He could of downed you at anytime during that chase. He let you go
---
I saw a really safe pallet on my way out of a liquor store today. Coulda looped that baby for 5 gens.
---
I have 7 ebony moris on Spirit, who is also my main and I can confirm, I do this frequently
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm your best buddhi!‚Äù
---
to be honest, i like the animation that plays when a survivor tries to enter an occupied locker.
---
"Huh? Oh, my bad Dawg."
---
It's almost an hour since you said that and I looked it up, and I am still in disbelief about not having the opportunity to purchase a Ghostface body pillow.
---
Just letting you know.
---
It's also unchangeable without a rework
---
"Fix your shitty internet" - Some Survivor on a laptop on grandma's wifi probably.
---
Had this happen in a game tonight. Seems pretty common with no fix
---
*Look who's shitting in the tall grass.*
---
David got moried by Legion 
---
Adam got moried by Spirit (probably)
---
Laurie got moried by Michael (probably)
---
Bill got moried by...Tank?
---
I don‚Äôt care if Carl is dead. The entity should bring him back and t-bagging ghost face in revenge.
---
How about nurse doc and hag?
---
Yes
---
Until you realize the plague is running permanent aura reading and you need to do this or die.
---
Wait
---
True, true.
---
you havent seen how stupid op Corrupt Purge is obviously lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I main her and sometimes survivors are so good at looping i know i cant catch them. With corrupt purge i literally two tap these same survivors.
---
I‚Äôm an item hoarder. I play with a group of people and just go into each match looting chest trying to get the best item, then never use them lol.
---
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
all the god damn time lmao
---
I don't normally buy DLC... Apparently I violated my policy about 3 days too early. üò°
---
Gonna love this thicc boi &lt;3
---
Found the killer main
---
For fucks sakes you two kiss already. If it gets anymore tsun tsun in here the tables gonna bitch slap the chair and fuck the microwave.
---
I had the same with one survivor. Kept flashing me the whole game got right on my nerves kept hiding in a building so at the very end had no:Ed on hit her then did a mauri on her was sweet justice
---
It ain't even no point playing killer over there
---
Yo isn't hag's hand just claws?
---
:// i dont really keep up with the devs and what they say so do you know if they have commented on this at all?
---
Just noticed that pig cut out looks like an hd version of something from hotline miami
---
I FUCKING LOVE THIS.
---
Is this for pc or all consoles?
---
That isnt a build, thats just consistency and using good perks. Remember a build is basically creating a new mechanic.
---
I have no clue. I don‚Äôt keep up much either. I‚Äôve heard they are gonna fix wake up so maybe it‚Äôll be patched with that
---
Lithe + Dance With Me. Really helps to lose the killer if you can not let the killer see you after vaulting. Has saved me way more than other exhaustion perks.
---
Compares sound a survivor makes to a core game mechanic lol.
---
I absolutely do the same thing. Not so much since double BP event since rank reset but on my meg I have probably a dozen rainbow maps and a 20 something ultra rare keys.
---
How does the hatch spawns work without endgame? Everyone sais you need to do the number of survivors remaining plus 1 in generators, but on the DBD Gamepedia it states the hatch spawns after 2 gens are completed. So....who is lying here?
---
Well if you show mercy like the one that did to me - thank you kind stranger üëåüèæüëåüèæ
---
All consoles, But I understand that Nurse can be slightly harder to play on console but shes still a cut above the rest
---
Just stop, they are never accurate
---
Sorry, prayer beads and diamond ring Spirit shows no mercy
---
Im pretty sure Opinions are never accurate
---
You jave Trapper over Hag on console?
---
It's the addons, man.
---
It's like fighting a plague who's addons make it that you're fucked the moment she's in melee range, no matter what your health state is.
---
What? What are you saying?
---
You could just press the button called "check for updates" you know..
---
Let me remind the comment thread that this is my OPINION not FACT.
---
The sub is not killer sided, not by a long shot. Killer mains are generaly more focused on fixing the game and voicing their opinions rather than survivors who are usually more trying to have fun with friends and play the game.
---
Alrighty, thank you! Hopefully its fixed soon because boy is it getting annoying lol
---
legion?
---
didn‚Äôt know those were dlc oops
---
Anyone will be upset if you didn't save them, no matter what you did.
---
People are selfish like that.
---
it's an exploited bug, has a laundry list of requirements to happen, so it was *not* an accident.
---
you don't have to do anything, devs can track/ban for that
---
Spirit has a much higher skill cap but clown has a much lower skill floor.  
---
Clown would probably be better for an "average" player just because he's very straightforward.
---
spirit is a really solid killer
---
If only we got Sidney :(
---
I refuse to even acknowledge that Legion even exists. Hes lower than freddy he's in z tier
---
He definitely wanted the Ash to escape after downing him twice and dribbling him away from the exit gate. He didn't hit because he was trying to bm, not because he wanted to let him go.
---
Trapper is A but he's higher A than Hag.
---
Porque?
---
There‚Äôs a dog in the picture. Insta upvote.
---
(Also nice tattoo!)
---
I like you because I like toast and jam (my wife makes her own) but most tier lists have Trapper way down near Freddy level.
---
Hard work for the entity seeming that the fuckers keep dropping and breaking the old ones willy nilly.
---
Roni intrudes a majority of the time. And thank you!
---
With the exception of Kate, we have no idea how any of them were taken, save that no one knows what happened to them. For some of them, they were even stated to be in dangerous locales - iirc, Legion was taken during a small blizzard or at least a very cold and snowy night.
---
Sir....this...is...a...
---
Yeah, no. He was just being an asshole.
---
It‚Äôs an exploit that I thought was fixed. You can‚Äôt do it accidentally either.
---
They edited their comment. They wrote spirit at first, hence why I wrote "her". Who tf does that lnao

It‚Äôs not that you killed him, it‚Äôs that you used the tombstone piece, which everyone hates.
---
Lmao
---
They really didn't. They'd drop pallets like 20 feet in front of me. I was Wraith too so I'd just chase them while moving faster while Cloaked and just casually break every pallet they dropped.
---
Why not just run object of obsession?
---
‚ÄúSpine chill activated guys!‚Äù
---
‚Äúyeah, we couldn‚Äôt tell.‚Äù
---
good on Ghost face too, his power doesn't mute TR in a chase
---
I feel the pain, my computer also randomly gets a massive frame drop and won't get normal frames again until I restart so I feel the pain almost daily.
---
Some maps are insta-losses, and his exhaustion add ons are a must at high ranks. He‚Äôs just a mid-tier killer.
---
For one, you clearly didn't let that guy do fucking anything (1379 BP), so that does suck for him. Also you literally can't derank in 15-20 I believe.
---
What do you mean? 
---
The Tbag *IS* the power
---
Now you have the job of showing Shawnee Smith (Amanda Young's actress) your tattoo.
---
She did, with Egc it would have made her RBTs fucking cancer and I don't think people want her to be a new Legion
---
Its like that for pallet dropping too
---
The first Scary Movie had pretty good storytelling in general though
---
The dude in Third Seal just shit himself
---
Oh my gosh it's too relatable it hurts
---
fuck thats right. Unnerving presence is him trying to hold it in, then in third seal its the horrifying feeling of warm shit sliding down your leg as you realise that you didn't make it.
---
The sped up Myers stub sound is beyond blessed
---
Not all heroes wear capes.

Hahhahaha

Wow, that's pretty nice. Though I imagine it would suck if you ever quite DBD, just because even if you stop that tattoo will be there forever.

Lmfao haha it‚Äôs a tv show
---
What a fucking loser. 
---
Too many times Ive faced douchebags who pull shit like this on ps4. 
---
Good job.
---
Still holding a grudge from pre nerf?
---
If your only interest in this subreddit is to plug your youtube channel then it sounds like Rule 7 is working as intended.
---
Myers is much better than Legion...just going up to why you‚Äôre looking for a new killer.
---
if it's good I can finally uninstall Identity V
---
*snorts furiously*
---
Maybe
---
Me:Burning a picture of Legion
---
You say that as if face camping isn‚Äôt a popular thing, Have you Played recently? Lol Clearly Nothing in the game can get a hardcore all nighter, 3 time champion of the waiting game- hook camper away from someone. Therefore something new would probably work and what‚Äôs more enticing than an exposed survivor that can be killed?
---
Clown's biggest weakness is his lack of map pressure, but he's easily one of the strongest anti-loop killers. Just pray to the spider god in the sky that you don't get an overly large map when playing as him and you should do decent.
---
If I go through your profile and find any comments pertaining to DS or MoM before they were nerfed, youre getting a spanking.
---
Best: Torture Creek, Lampkin, Mother‚Äôs Dwelling, Blood Lodge
---
Worst: Game, L√©ry‚Äôs
---
I've had people where I literally had a  whole squad coming in for the save. Like dude can wait just one minute to get away before I even see you.
---
Yoir opinion or meta?
---
Then stop bringing ebony mori you cry baby
---
They face camp because they want to confirm a kill, You‚Äôre talking out of your ass if you‚Äôre actually saying the majority would continue to camp while someone exposes his/herself and presents an immediate (potential) kill.
---
When can ghostface sprint? I detect him and break him out of his crouch only for him to rush at me super fast. I've found it best not to look at him and just creep away..
---
Wait isnt game called gideon meat plant?
---
Jesus
---
My opinion, BL makes a lot of easy loops and infinite‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs all opinions.
---
I think it's like that on both sides and I think people should give it time at least and learn how to counter before telling devs to nerf everything straight away imo
---
They just changed it...it‚Äôs much better than the hatch standoffs we used to have.
---
Wholesome
---
The ‚ÄòRealm‚Äô is the meat plant, the map itself is the Game.
---
Thanks man :D
---
You‚Äôre ridiculous. This is has to be some sort of satire.
---
What are the tally marks by my perks?
---
Remember me? More like forget me
---
If you're deliberately being a bad sportsman, harboring negative behaviour and ruining the fun of a game, or making it unfair, then you're being toxic. But go ahead and keep killing the community, kid.
---
Yes it is but there are still so many killers who just sit on the hatch and hope that the survivor comes by so they can either kill some noob survivors or so they can feel toxic by closing the hatch in front of them.
---
Today i actually played a lot of plague and i enjoyed her woth the apple addon, still i think she needs little changes, thanks for watching btw! And for commenting ur opinion
---
All grocery themed. Cashier fo Life
---
Well, the killer gets to decide what they want to do in a match. Not you.
---
Do more
---
Artificial rules are stupid *Competitively* casually they improve the game for almost everyone
---
I don't even understand how to get merciless haha I was trying to get huntress done and I got a 3k game and still got it i was confused as hell
---
Survivors are basically just skins, and while Jeff's perks definitely are not the worst, they aren't the best either. The Clown is entirely different from the other killers, has unique gameplay, and has a couple of solid perks, even if Coulrophobia is underwhelming at best.
---
Lmao I died when I first heard that
---
Good way to put it. Here‚Äôs an upvote
---
What kind of an answer is this to my idea lmao.
---
Why should the killer camp a hatch for 5 minutes so they can feel toxic if the survivor comes by?
---
Clown, he has decently good perks.
---
Until you gen rush and teabag at gate for the full end game countdown and leave last second. So idk about all that
---
My man got killed so hard the entity blocked the homepage
---
He could also have dropped him because there were no nearby hooks and he realized his mistake. His only hope would be to drag Ash away from the gate long enough to make Ash bleed out, which failed.
---
No no no, i just bosted up my med ps4
---
Big feet, Big Hitboxes
---
you're
---
I don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs so much easier to close the hatch and go back and forth between gates. He probably lacks the confidence to find the survivor. Either way I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs toxic. 
---
After two years I‚Äôve seen so much ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù on both sides nothing phases me anymore.
---
Play the tutorial possibly. If it's a new account
---
They were only free for console players.
---
Lol i mean i get the killing and enemies thing but camping is just boring and especially things like hatch camping or tbagging at gates should be dealt with. It just makes the match longer and simply isnt fun.
---
Don't forget the part where you abuse bug and spread the news about it
---
No kids here, son.  Thanks for coming out though, junior.
---
Whose being "toxic" now Mr SJW?  I never said I condoned poor sportsmanship.  I simply stated my opinion on the vocabulary.
---
Get triggered reddit. Lol.  The most "toxic" people are often the ninnies running around squawking the word.
---
Yep. He wanted to be as toxic as possible. Glad he got punished for it
---
If you see the situation as toxic, that's your feeling, it's not necessarily how the killer feels about it. You're projecting your own feelings onto the situation and labeling it as toxic. 
---
Better yet, if you see the killer camping the hatch... stop trying for the "easy" win and go do the damn gens.
---
I'M A RANDOM!
---
I agree tbh I‚Äôm only toxic when someone is toxic toward me I know it doesn‚Äôt make sense but it‚Äôs deserved you know? I never play killer so I don‚Äôt know that whole camping hatch side
---
Each perk has 3 tiers. Each tally mark is a tier
---
I‚Äôve been getting into survivor games in like 10seconds average
---
Did you read my actual post before commenting? I just said that the killer should be forced to close the hatch when they are nearby it so the gates get powered so the killer can move on to do the easiest task a killer can do which is controlling gates.
---
A survivor will always lose a 1v1 endgame situation unless the killer is a rank 20. So why not speed things up instead of camping a hatch?
---
Leatherface is the obvious choice. He has BBQ which you really need for DBL BPs. If you don‚Äôt care about perks I‚Äôd say GF, Spirit or plague
---
Lol on a good day when my awareness is doing well, I'll always raise a hatchet when they're about to drop it or vault. Easy hits all day, unless you get a really smart survivor.
---
Crouch has nothing to do with his power. If he's using his power he has no terror radius or red stain and moves at normal speed
---
Casey was Stu‚Äôs ex-girlfriend. Casey pulls the mask off of ghostface, and based on her reaction, it is presumed to be Stu. For many of the scenes, it is presumed that Stu was in the costume while Billy did the calls.
---
Not sure why people are hating Myers, he was obviously having fun with you? He watched you open the door and didn't even try to hook...
---
I would have lost my shit laughing. Great gameplay!
---
Friendly tip, the background music doesn‚Äôt need to be there, nor does it need to ever switch if you decide to include it. 
---
Also, this can‚Äôt be a serious post right? A rank 2 should know that mori‚Äôing will not get you a 2 pip.
---
Now this does bring a smile to my face &lt;3
---
Now you know where to run to.
---
He was trying to be toxic. He miscalculated by letting him open the door (on purpose) and realizing there were no nearby hooks because someone died on it already. He was trying to prolong OP‚Äôs dying state so the EGC could kill him but he was too far gone with the wiggle timer.
---
Killer: 
---
NOED is overrated. Yeah it‚Äôs annoying, but it won‚Äôt win games. It‚Äôs better to try and win beforehand
---
Bamboozle makes Infinites a thing of the past, it‚Äôs so fun.
---
Survivor:
---
Obligatory Self care 
---
Kindred makes being facecamped fun bc you know they‚Äôre being publicly shamed
---
Yeah but then they don't get bloodpoints.
---
Second crow, which is 1:30 I think
---
Im afriad I'm a little too fat to vault over the fence üòÇ I'm in a constant state of exhaustion
---
Swf, is likely the scenario.
---
Is it better to buy cells or threw the steam store?
---
Happens literally every time.
---
Hmm, oh man. Thanks for taking the time to reply!
---
or auto aim fucks you over
---
I love when they stall to drop the pallet so you bait the pallet to throw a crispy iridescent at em
---
True
---
Why the fuck her limbs so big though
---
I'm pretty sure it's a perk that slowly lowers the volume of the skill check notifications, until you finally don't get any before your skill checks.
---
What about Jill from Scream 4?
---
sir this is a mcdonalds drive way
---
what if someone got pregnant from the wraith what would their kid be like ( human female )
---
when all gens are done noed will be applied to a dull totem and remains active until its cleansed, but during the match if all the survivors cleanse all 5 totems then noed will not activate, so yes doing dull totems can help against noed.
---
I think Gideons (The Game) is actually a good survivor map despite the bad rep Doctor gives it. Almost every pallet is safe and there's quite a few spots you can make good use of balanced landing at. 
---
As for worst I am not really sure. I don't dislike any map in particular when playing as survivor.
---
I didnt know lmao, i thought that getting 4 kills= adept
---
I put background music because some people requested it, so idk who to trust nowdays... 
---
btw thanks for watching and for ur tips!
---
Look at your own video, man. The last time he picked up you up, did you think you wiggled free? Because no, you didn't. You didn't have a full wiggle bar and you didn't get points for wiggling out. That means he dropped you, knowing what would happen. He clearly let you escape on purpose.
---
Did you read my actual comment before replying? 
---
&gt;I just said that the killer should be forced to close the hatch when they are nearby it so the gates get powered so the killer can move on to do the easiest task a killer can do which is controlling gates.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;A survivor will always lose a 1v1 endgame gate situation unless the killer is a rank 20. So why not speed things up instead of camping a hatch?
---
And maybe the killer wants to try for a hatch play. Stop being so salty and controlling and just go do the damn gens already. 
---
Why do i get the feeling that you 10/10 times camp the hatch until you see the survivor?
---
I know you didn't read my comment now, because you're continuing to project your feelings not only onto the killer, but onto me now. I have never once stayed at the hatch and looked for the survivor. Cut the assumptions, it's not making you look good. 
---
&gt;I never do this when im playing killer. Straight up never. Its a waste of time  for both sides.
---
Nobody cares about what you do. It doesn't prove anything or make you the "better" player.
---
You‚Äôre the type of person that said ‚Äúmeta knight needs to be nerfed‚Äù in ssbb and then played him in tournaments
---
I like to equip glass bead and run between the chasing survivor and killer to redirect the misfortune
---
yea but her traps when gens are done are fuckin useless now
---
That's actually quite nice. Not the biggest fan of tattoos but they've done Myers very well there.
---
If you use filthy knife or dirty knife or both of them it decreases all action speeds except for running
---
You had momentum, if you don‚Äôt mori people and you let others slug out while keeping a steady hook pace, you probably would‚Äôve doubled. 
---
It‚Äôs your video. Do what you want.
---
It‚Äôs basically the opposite of wake up
---
you made my day
---
fuckin sweet üíâ
---
Doofy got away with it tho. Idk about you, but thats the best fuckin Ghostface reveal of all time. Pretended to be retarded and ACTUALLY got away with it.
---
You don't have a 4th perk until the exitgates is probably the only downside. The strongest part however is not the instadown but rather the movementspeed which makes it just as viable on Myers as any other killer
---
Oops I bought legion but then realized I could get legion and Jeff for 4 dollars. Is there anything I can do about that?
---
Give em the ol razzle dazzle
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs her but it might be the pig stuff first .
---
i liked her plan. just not the reveal of why..
---
SWF and plague
---
feng mains unite! if we all pray to the entity, surely it will come out!
---
It was more a joke on the emblem system. But I'll take what I can.
---
I like ballerina Feng but I‚Äôd rather it be piggy first
---
I never looked at the movement speed part of it before, so why don't more people use hope as survivor?
---
IT'S ALWAYS ON ORMOND OR RED FOREST UUUGH
---
sweetie that‚Äôs not peptobismol that‚Äôs a dick
---
Hope is honestly greatly underrated
---
I always thought that the entity kills whoever it takes and the realm is a purgatory of sorts. Once the entity goes, everyone goes.
---
Deja Vu. If one person runs it with a map with the aura add on its really usefull.
---
the perks of having a the ranks messed up every 4 weeks. Whoever thought of that must be very unsmart
---
I've been prestiging my main Survivors and haven't ran into it, I use it when I have it but have never seen someone else use it.
---
 I completely forgot about Noed giving that speed boost because I never use it and always think 1 hit down when I see it.
---
It really comes down to why you play. Some people just want to have a good time, so when they come into a game against a killer who is proxy camping to either prevent an unhook or to tunnel someone right after they are unhooked, it ruins the fun. 
---
Sure, you can tell them to gen rush and let the killer camp, but that's not the point. They aren't wanting to use the best strats possible to win the game, they just want to have a nice match.
---
Same thing with a killer who just wants to have a good time and ends up going against a 4 man SWF with insta heals and stuff. That killer could switch to Billy with an eboni and go super sweaty next match, but again that's not the point. They weren't there for winning, they were there for a fun match.
---
This is where the made up rules come into play (which happens on both sides). The person just here for casual fun will tell the competitive person that they are super lame to play against because of reasons x, y, and z. The competitive person will tell the casual person that they're whinny with their made up rules and that its not their job to make sure other people have fun. 
---
Both players are in the right from their perspective because they both have a different perspective on what makes a good game (winning/vs purely having fun).
---
I appreciate it but people are entitled to their own opinion
---
If a survivor actually does the gens then the gates get powered up and what do you think happens then? The killer already won the second that he got to the hatch first because a survivor CANT win a gate battle. They simply cant unless youre utter trash.
---
And wtf is a hatch play? "Oh no i hear the surv nearby. I better close the hatch. Ez skill" this is the first time in my life that i heard the 2 words hatch play.
---
The only reason i made assumptions is because you defend hatch camping which... why would anyone do that lmao. Only a rank 20 noob in my opinion.
---
I didnt say it makes me the better player why are you making assumptions now?... I mean while were on topic. It actually does make me a better player because im not a hatch camping prick but still lmao. Controlling the 2 gates is super easy. Why would i camp a hatch for 5 minutes and let the survivor do gens when i can close it and kill him at gate battle under 2 minutes? Can you explain me your rank 1 logic?
---
uhhh what?
---
David is free on PC?
---
Sooo many PS4 survivors just dash to the gen right next to the one they just did and don‚Äôt ever want to be questioned about map/gen strategy or they‚Äôll curse you out.
---
welcome to console.
---
Definitely not on spirit because most survivors would just guess you‚Äôre running it when they see a lit totem and it‚Äôs not ruin
---
12 months on one and a year on the other
---
*laughter* you dumb bitch
---
Probably because it‚Äôs been a year and x months since.
---
I hate that stupid shaking effect when you land a hit or get hit. That+ frame drop ruins everything
---
I mean if it's a nurse the movementspeed barely matter. But hope is relly fun against nurse just because she thinks she can get a hit when in reality you're too fast
---
Lmao git gud baby plague
---
I only bought Quentin (and Freddy) with my Cells since I don't really think I'm gonna play him anyways. I just want all the characters just to have them and to get their teachables. For Laurie and Myers I'm just gonna wait for the Halloween DLC pack to go on sale since I actually like Laurie's alternate costume. Don't know yet if I'm gonna buy Leatherface. I already got BBQ from the Shrine, and from using offering to try him out I don't really like his play style.
---
*the Pig stunned squeal*
---
Just fix the detection. Its super wonky. Either i reveal him through a wall, or stare right at him for 10 seconds and it does nothing.
---
Best: Haddonfield, torment creek, blood lodge
---
Worst: Leary‚Äôs (only 1 legitimately safe pallet on the whole map and the window spawns are not nearly as good as they used to be for survivors)
---
Pale rose, aside from the pallets on the boat and the shack this map is really not good for survivors unless they‚Äôre immersed Claudette‚Äôs
---
Not sure someone who suggested teabagging should make you exhausted in a position to criticize survivors for having ‚Äúrules‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt he also typically use titles for videos like ‚Äútoxic bully 4 man!‚Äù I mean, clearly that would indicate he has a code of conduct, or ‚Äúrules‚Äù,  that he thinks survivors should abide by.
---
The game is pretty survivor sided now. It has a lot of pallets near each other.
---
Surprisingly, my post had a positive number of upvotes at one point. I think the gay wave hit and mass downvoted me :/
---
expect lerry is extremly Survivor sided with all those window jukes
---
_Yeahaaah Boiii._
---
Lol you are toxic for running away from killers, didn't you know that?  xD
---
What realm is torment and blood in
---
I saw moonshine add-on and was immediately hard.
---
Well, thanks for the help lmao
---
Torment creek is a cold wind farm map and blood lodge is Autohaven.
---
I always want a smaller map when im survivor
---
While this may be true I still hate you.
---
Meh...Lerys is to small for me.
---
This is badass!
---
I'm a huge payday fan and have been following all the starbreeze drama since 2014.
---
What ever you think starbreeze did they most likely didn't , there is nothing to suggest that involved with DBD development , they were just a publisher and BHVR had complete creative freedom.
---
Aah, understood. I know for flashlight blinds, if you hit them while in animation they drop the survivor so I was confused when I didn't.
---
Escape is not an escape.
---
Jeff good perks
---
&gt;I'm a huge payday fan and have been following all the starbreeze drama since 2014.
---
Yes.
---
Honestly I'll settle for Piggy too and I need Daddy Tapp to arrest me.
---
You're so immature. You're the "toxic" one.
---
4 man SWF and Plague being a bottom 3 Killer.
---
No they haven't 
---
Starbreeze is just the business side of overkill , same company and the people making the game are basically the same people managing the marketing side.
---
Make the map a grocery store
---
Slow Mo OOOOOOOOOOOOFFFF
---
That makes too much sense...
---
Could have*
---
Signed in just to add onto this; a Huntress had full stacks for Lullaby, but it only affected healing skill checks complete with no sound, yet generator checks were unaffected.
---
They really need to fix this scenario. A SWF shouldn't be going against lower rank killers.
---
Weird flex
---
Sir this is a wendy's..
---
The best survivor map is probably Haddonfield. Especially if the survivors have balanced landing. Badham preschool is also pretty survivor as it has 4 extremely strong buildings for the survivors to use (shack, 2 houses, and preschool). 
---
I would say the worst survivor map is Shelter Woods. No strong building except for shack, really the only survivor advantage here is that the map is pretty big. 
---
People are saying The Game is one of the worst survivor maps but since the pallet rework it‚Äôs pretty survivor sided. Not sure how the map that has 30 safe pallets is one of the strongest killer maps lol. The only advantage here for killers is that it‚Äôs hard for survivors to keep track of where you are and your totem can spawn in good hiding spots.
---
Ah, a survivor main. We may have our differences but please understand that this dude was looping and tea bagged after every time he dropped a pallet. Dude would also point at me after every window he‚Äôd vault so I think that my rage was justified.
---
You should buy Jeffrey. Haha, get it?
---
All I want his a fatty survivor that accidentally break palletes when he tries vaulting them and stuns the killer with debre and carrying his is very difficult. And maybe shirtless.  Idk in horror movies the fat guy is always the funniest. Would have much more fun if I was a fat ass nimble dodging hatchets.
---
Yeah, I'm just gonna block you now, since you're being thick-headed, and, quite frankly, extremely rude. I don't have time for that, I have better things to do with my life.
---
Good joke. He's going to be easier to reveal, his stalk time add ons are being needed. BuT iT's NoT a NeRf CoS kIlLeR iNsTiNcT aDd OnS aRe BeInG bUfFeD.

---

---
Nightmare on elm street
---
Okay?
---
Snort it kid
---
I didn't say he wasn't an arse, then I again I didn't know he was tea-bagging. But you camping, then getting butthurt that he responded, then you posting it on reddit making out like he was the bad guy is definitely immature.
---
If you're not doing it already, may I suggest you watch some YouTubers? 
---
I personally like Monto and HybridPanda the best because their videos are fun to watch and I'm not a native English speaker, so it helps when people have a somewhat neutral accent with a clear voice. Monto often does fun builds and explains why he's using the perks he's using, and Panda does Shrinewatch every week, where he reviews the perks on the Shrine and uses them in game. The YouTuber I've learned the most from, though, is Scott from DamnNoHTML. There's a video he did about looping strategies that helped me a lot. 
---
Now, Dead by Daylight is pretty much the first game I picked up on the PS4. I'm pretty crap at the game, but the progress from when I started to right now is noticeable, so those might help!
---
Curtain call 
---
Doctor isn't fun imo
---
God endgame sucks. Really has nerfed the close escapes I‚Äôve had previously. Good that you got out
---
There is a crazy amount of killers who de-rank... between going afk to straight up Dc'ing at the start of a match. I see this on ps4 a few times a week.
---
Any new players in here? Take a good look at the comment section. An accurate  representation of the community's mindset and attitude. Have fun :)
---
IT'S TOMORROW????
---
No thanks i already do coke (pro-gamer tip: thats how you do well at this game)
---
Good lmao. I guess blocking someone is always better than to answer.
---
I mean pretty much all audio was nerfed into the fuckin dirt with this update, how much lower can it be?
---
I made a post about him a long time ago on how he could work. It would be interesting to see him using his medallion to take over other survivors bodies when he downs them, and force them to hook themselves.
---
Wait, can I follow survivors by sound while closing my eyes? Haven't been able to do that since the SAW chapter.
---
Someone got face camped on free weekend
---
*Oh no I'm falling out of a multistory building oh no finger guns before I hit the ground*
---
Really great job so far
---
That's latency. The animation only changes it to make it look like it goes the full distance it can hit. Even a perfect animation won't change you being hit by a high ping lunge.
---
Someone isn‚Äôt currently snorting my crusted semen
---
I've never seen a well deserved teabag.
---
You free now
---
It‚Äôs fine brother
---
I think other dev is onto something here..
---
Dude these are awesome
---
Your name on reddit... your posts‚Äô... imagine a game tilting you this bad.  
---
Find something you enjoy and quit dwelling on dbd if you don‚Äôt like it.
---
I suppose that after the 12months in changes to 1 year, so the video on top is either starting its 12 months or soon ending its 12 month, check back on july and it should change.
---
Imagine you currently not snorting my crusted semen
---
You sir got yourself a keeper.
---
Doesn‚Äôt stop toxic players from messaging me lmao
---
There's new menu music for the three year anniversary of the game
---
Glass Bead is honestly one of the most underrated addons in the game. It can be so insanely useful to add a beacon of clarity in the chaos of a pub match.
---
Still super happy about the one time I had a Glass Bead and was being chased by the Killer when there were two Survivors and two gens left. I passed by the hatch so I put my laser pointer on it and then ran away from it. When I got hooked and died the last Survivor immediately escaped through the hatch and thanked me for the Glass Bead. :)
---
Personnally Nurse is my favorite to go against, juking her feels so rewarding
---
I hate to play toxic and seldom get annoyed if I'm outplayed. But I have a rule, I play fair if survivors aren't toxic.. toxic meaning constant tea bagging and flashlight clicking at every pallet.. constant bodyblocking.. if I face a toxic 4 man then it's game on, i can be toxic too.
---
He's free on everything right?
---
Do you get the killer and survivor for each chapter? Looking at getting the Saw one
---
Yeah, you better wait (just a lil bit)
---
Not on PS4...
---
When you're looking at your phone and nearly get hit by a car.
---
After the toxicity I‚Äôve had to deal with trying to play on both sides today,,, this is very satisfying to see lmao
---
Yes you do (unless it only has one like leatherface or ash)
---
the rank 20 is the one that gets away IIRC      this wasn't made by a fan.
---
I laughed at this more than I should have.
---
I'm just gonna let you rot on that one. You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
---
Quit acting like a child on a dbd reddit for attention, and saying nasty shit at that. 
---
Seek mental help immediately if that‚Äôs how you speak to people.  Clearly something is wrong 
---
Hope you get better at the game.
---
Is that a separate system than green/yellow/purple or whatever the colors are?
---
Wood person
---
Why are you only able to play for one month?
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
I'd say sabotaging traps needs to go. There's no reason just bringing a toolbox is grounds for deleting a killers power for minutes at a time, they can already be disarmed.
---
Traps in narrow spaces need to register across the entire space. You go that way, you get trapped. None of this "it was a micrometer to the left so you can run around it" nonsense.
---
Start with more/all traps, unlimited carry capacity. Any add on that increases difficulty to escape needs to add 0% chance attempts at the start. IE, slightly harder means you WILL NOT escape on attempt one, moderately 2, considerably 3 etc. It's bullshit you bring add ons to stop escapes and it can still happen instantly.

Man, can‚Äôt say 1 sentence on reddit without causing a chain reaction of children crying. Snort my semen crybaby
---
I‚Äôm not making him out to be the bad guy. I thought I explained myself fine in the comments and I pointed out my flaws too. He messaged me first, I was in a bad mood because his constant taunting got on my nerves so I jabbed at him. Again, he was bum rushed, was I, the killer, supposed to let him live? It wasn‚Äôt his first hook just to clarify. Cut me some slack.

There needs to be killer emotes for taunts

You can install the dlc with huntress and David for free on the psn store

Who‚Äôs crying? You‚Äôre talking like a fucking pig over dead by daylight?  
---
You say this shit to get a rise out of people yet you don‚Äôt realize you talk like a pig. 
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit if you do or don‚Äôt love this game. But to be that HURT and that overworked over it literally baffles me. I don‚Äôt get it
---
Any Killer is, it just depends on their build. I am a purple/red rank Doctor main, and it depends on Survivors. It‚Äôs not going to be as fun as it seems unfortunately. A lot of the Survivors I face like to work on gens 2 or 3 at a time or they go on three separate gens, so I have to down a Survivor really quickly or hope that I can make a comeback. I‚Äôll often find 1 or 2 gens close to completion or already completed by the time I hook my first Survivor. The three gen strat will be your friend here. It‚Äôs saved me multiple times.
---
She is like Michael in that she has a very recognisable breathing noise. It's sort of a long, steadying breath that gives you a lot of warning to run which fucks up most ambushes, as it's a pretty short attack.
---
You know, seeing post like this genuinely makes me happy. And if you are a killer that does this stuff just know it‚Äôs worse than tunneling or camping.
---
It appeared when DS got re-worked this year I believe. After almost a year gone from the Shrine.
---
‚ÄúTo be that hurt and overworked over it literally baffles me‚Äù the amount of irony emitting from this response is lethal. Just snort my semen and quit crying about it.
---
Nah man I suggest wearing headphones max volume so you cant hear it
---
Do I really need to explain to you why you should gtfo?
---
Are you sure that you‚Äôre old enough to even produce semen?
---
It was in the shrine IIRC when I bought the game actually so I couldn't save up enough shards in time and didn't know how good of a perk it was Q\_Q
---
Why don‚Äôt you just snort it and find out?
---
Step one. Remove your head from your anus.
---
Step two. Stop ignoring the person frantically tea bagging you and pointing any direction away from the gen.
---
Step three. Don't blame the killer in the chat for "gen camping" when you set up a 3 gen for them with no assistance from them.
---
it's good for finding totems faster, and totems already break fast enough to where you dont really need anything to boot that speed. You don't have to search every corner, just run past jungle gyms/ anywhere else they can spawn
---
It would be nice to have 3 start out in lockers, 1 on the field. If Legion goes up to a locker he'll come out another one with one of the other 3 (press Square, triangle, or circle to switch) and if a survivor goes up to a locker hes in itll notify the one on the field. 115% speed with the same lunge, just a teleport/ control mechanic.
---
The whole deep wound thing needs to be scraped bc plauge does it better and more balanced
---
If everyone is snorting your semen dosent that make you gay?
---
Possible, but I try not to count on the worst
---
I‚Äôm just the supplier. What people do with the crusted semen is up to them.
---
If traps can‚Äôt be sabotaged wouldn‚Äôt that make the trapper able to make areas inaccessible? How would they get basement rescues? Also if traps could be obtained from lockers would that mean infinite traps?
---
I've only ever had this on the survivor side, where the killer swings and misses, then I go down half a second later.
---
Man what the fuck, I just got a PC a week ago and spent all my time getting David‚Äôs teachables for this shit to happen. Hoes definitely mad
---
T-bagging is BM
---
I've been having long wait times and a lot of disconnects. Even ones that bring me all the way back to the main menu to select if you want to player killer or survivor
---
Please Explain

Do people still facecamp? I dont remember going against one in the last few months

---
Me being confused doesn‚Äôt correlate with you hurting.  
---
Who says ‚Äúsnort crusted semen‚Äù...? Have you done that or something? Want the world to know?
---
You also took time out of your day to make a whole profile for reddit, with the name ‚Äúdbd sucks hot farts‚Äù then proceeded to post about how much you hate it.   How does this bother you *that* much?
---
But wake up is not worthless, it does have it's place, at the end of the game. just like adrenaline.
---
Ugh
---
Let‚Äôs not feed the attention seeker.
---
If any of us bump into you, may we have permission to boop the snoot?
---
How the fuck can you even play this game
---
taking a gen from 99 to 30? Try Ruin, which is actually in the game. Missing a skillcheck takes off 8 seconds worth of work if a single survivor was working on it (regression + gen progress freeze) on a good skillcheck, and takes away the 5% (5 seconds) potential progress on a great skillcheck. Over multiple skill checks, that can easily add up to 40 seconds per gen, more or less depending on how good at hitting great skillchecks the survivor is, and it completely stops new survivors from doing gens at all.
---
Selfcare is too slow, of course it sounds like a better perk when you have another person healing you, and you're just using it to go from 99 to healed.
---
BNP used to be the counterpart to moris for newer/ uncoordinated players who can't rush the gens when the killer is holding a mori against them. experienced players never really need them.
---
Yup same.

This update is so buggy in more ways than one.

Lmfaoooooo you‚Äôre weird

Being blinded for a very long time and still hearing the clicking noise, predicting a teleport and still getting hit, being hit after dropping a pallet as he gets stunned. All tree of them deserve to get pulled up on.

Hahaha I think he does love me.
---
He 100% snorts his own semen lmao. Like who the fuck says that?
---
It's because you're in madness 3
---
I pray that it is
---
Me too! Sometimes I get the "Disconnected from host" (rough translation, the game is in Spanish for me) message, sometimes I get a "Error, the lobby you tried to access is no longer available" (again, rough translation) and that takes me all the way back to the main menu. 
---
When I do get a game, it's all buggy, but I've only noticed it with the healing. I can't heal myself or other players, but others can heal me.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main here, and they kinda already have one, I can‚Äôt remember the category name but the last killer category loses points if you stay too close, but I do not want a system even as a survivor, simply because if a killer does it to you it sucks, but the other 3(if they‚Äôre smart) can have 3 gens done so they essentially lose the game to camp 1 kill. Next, Borrowed Time is a beautiful counter to this, have one guy bait the killer, all you need is 2 seconds and you can get the unhook. You also invite more games where 3 survivors hide around the hook and get immediate saves if killers have to run away after. And finally if you have one downed and the other 3 have the doors opened, what else is a killer supposed to do? It‚Äôs a shitty part of the game, but it should be allowed as it is easily countered, and if you happen to be the one camped, rage all you want, I do every single time xD but it‚Äôs just a game, remember that don‚Äôt let the toxicity get ya;)
---
In the exact same minute shrine update, someone posted on this sub. You can easily find it, I have faith in you.
---
no
---
This actually just happened to me rip
---
Yeah, man.
---
Are you really saying the devs listen to killer mains? Wow. Especially in relation to MoM which was obviously a major pain in the ass and was essentially dead hard on steroids.
---
Pretty small load, not something I'd be proud enough of to post.
---
He made a post with his hand full of semen and said ‚Äúfor you bvbyscorpio666‚Äù LMFAOOO
---
It‚Äôs like you smashed it over his head so hard half his body went through it
---
I drop frames every time a status takes effect on me for the first time in a game. So if I get hemorrhaged on the first hit, frame drops and I stand still. If I Dead Hard, frame drops and I stand still
---
I feel like its half off atleast once a month
---
Before endgame was released you had to do 2 gens to get the hatch to spawn and open in a full game as the last survivor. Now it just opens when theres only on survivor left
---
I'm pretty sure that was Billy since there is a close-up on the knife before he kills Casey and you will see the same closeup on the knife near the end when he is fighting Sidney. There are so many hidden clues in the movie and it's amazing how many times you can you find them during each viewing. I'm glad GF is in DBD but he is not the guys I wanted. It's like having Reboot Freddy instead of-oh yeah.
---
I'm on ps4, I tried multiple matches and it doesn't work on killer or survivor
---
Lmfaooo!!!
---
Since David is a Free character, definitely worth grinding for it. Save your shards for perks that belong to DLCs you don't have any intention in buying (such as Freddy, Hag, etc).
---
WHAT THE HELL
---
Are you ok?
---
YOURE FUCKING DISGUSTING
---
If correct they deemed it unworthy of reporting so it‚Äôs fair game, at least from what I recall.
---
There is! It‚Äôs called the emblem system! You‚Äôre  welcome!
---
In my experience (rank 5 survivor) I always have this one person who doesn‚Äôt touch any gens and is just urban evading throughout the match
---
I sure hope those people don't drive.
---
There‚Äôs a change I support that would actually meld nicely with this: split the survival bonus in half and tie it to generator progression. 1500 BP for completing three generators, another 1500 for completing the final two. Discourages players for sandbagging since they don‚Äôt get as many points for laming it out for the hatch. Plus it rewards players who are spending most of their game getting tunneled or camped and can‚Äôt work on generators.
---
It's definitely a popular perk and at least worth trying out. 
---
Keep in mind this is just my personal opinion - I think it's highly overrated. I consider it a "one and done" perk - you'll get one missed swing out of the killer, but after that they will just wait for it and down you right after.
---
As far as exhaustion perks, I'd put Balanced Landing and Lithe above Dead Hard. Being able to dash for 10 meters is great, especially through a bear trap, but I prefer being able to sprint for 40-50 meters.
---
They knew they were screwed anyway since the endgame timer would have run out before the blood warden timer, so they knew it didn‚Äôt matter what they did.
---
Oh wow, what even.
---
There are multiple "systems" already tho.
---
That does sound pitiful as hell, not for you but him. He‚Äôs the pitiful one for such actions if they are true.
---
Other perks are better, Adrenaline, DS, deadhard and self-care are my go to perks
---
Na grind David out. You‚Äôll get Were Gonna Live Forever, another phenomenal perk.
---
The first huntress Hatchet that hits me every game. Like it still hits me regardless but it‚Äôs weird and frustrating
---
We have moderators on this subreddit right?
---
YALL THIS GUY FOUND MY PLAYSTATION NAME AND IS NOW SAYING THE SAME THING.  
---
I got a stalker

---
It's a shooter if you play Huntress
---
Add a cooldown on it for the 100% chance and it'd be good.
---
Am I one too for letting the last survivor repair gens for hatch then closing hatch and killing them when they get to it?
---
Is that Ashley
---
vod = video uploaded after stream has ended
---
The 5 starting trap proposition is the most reasonable one, I like it.
---
His traps are pretty powerful once he's able to set them all down, so I don't think he needs an instadown. 
---
Making him 130% would make him way too strong and brainless to play. You wouldn't even use traps at that point, you are above bloodlust 3 at all times.
---
My advice for getting a 4K is to take a break from the game until rank reset hits once or twice. It‚Äôs MUCH easier and more likely to accomplish at lower ranks.
---
The hatch trophy is tricky so you‚Äôll NEED friends. If you need help I‚Äôm always down if I‚Äôm available: sadface_mcgee
---
Other than that MAJOR kudos for getting this far. The trophy for hitting all 4 survivors out of a phantasm trap as hag is literally the most infuriating and seemingly buggy trophy I‚Äôve ever gotten so I feel your pain.
---
it get even worse after 3.0.0
---
He honestly just wanted to fuck with you &amp; kill you that‚Äôs it. He didn‚Äôt want you to escape but he wanted to you suffer as long as possible or bleed out to make it worse than just a hooking.
---
Thank you, I was planning on playing killer this morning when I got off work, an I run HL in a few of my builds.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
This guy has now harassed me in my messages. Keeps making new posts‚Äô about me. Even found my PlayStation name and is harassing me there lol.  
---
I got a stalker.
---
Given that he dropped you at that empty hook, I feel like he was going to escape anyways. I could be wrong, but I always do that to the final survivor if i get 3k. Or maybe he was just waiting for that hook to respawn...
---
A long time ago, like a year ago I think.
---
I don‚Äôt agree, I posted a picture of a survivor who I had to camp because his friends bum rushed who had messaged me calling me a camper and telling me to kill myself. I got overwhelmed with dudes calling me a garbage killer and person for showing people how toxic this dude was. Apparently, he had some shooters out there XD
---
Why'd you get a tattoo of worst killer
---
I find that it‚Äôs real value isn‚Äôt from dodging swings, but extending loops. If you use it correctly it can easily add 30+ seconds onto a chase, and it isn‚Äôt map dependent like BL and lithe
---
From TRotLD? Oh my god! He thoroughly scared the absolute shit out of me back then. He'd be a cool addition, and I know he'd probably still freak me out now.
---
you know I don't have any of these equipped right
---
Even then there are better perks to use. If you trying running it survivors just won't heal while in your terror radius. There is very little reason to run the perk when Sloppy Butcher exists.
---
Thats amazing. I love it
---
It‚Äôs a 10/10 meme perk though
---
Please note: This is the only edition of DBD available on PS4 and I assume the Xbone as well. The only "special" thing about it you get Hag and Doctor plus Feng and Ace for the price you're buying the game at, unlike the PC version where they are separate DLC that requires purchase.
---
He has a point about the rules but goddamn did this video remind me why I stopped watching true. He felt so entitled to that unhook and then for his teammates to rescue him from the basement while they were marked.
---
Buy a few cans of air, open up the side and spray air from top to bottom. When a can gets too cold switch cans, rotating through them as needed. Making sure that the whole case is dust free.
---
If that does it fix the issue (overheating), your power supply may be going bad, and needs replaced.
---
kinda yea
---
I think we all can tell he does lmfao
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs not the greatest, however I really find hilarious to throw a little pebble to the killer instead of t-bagging.
---
Big balls
---
The last survivor doesn't have to do gens for the hatch to spawn...
---
Need piggy
---
Trying to decide if I should just go ahead and buy Jeff. If I spend five dollars on auric cells that would leave me with 200 I‚Äôm unlikely to spend on anything. I bought Legion with shards a few months ago. I suppose I could buy the chapter just for Jeff‚Äôs bonus cosmetics. Alternatively, I could buy ten dollars in cells (actually nine; you get a 10% discount with Game Pass), buy Jeff *and* Adam to complete the roster, and that would leave me with 500 cells I‚Äôm sure I could find something to spend on. The question is what?
---
That was very funny üòÇüòÇ
---
Kinda? Don't drop the God pallet early on! It's basically a sin!
---
Approximately 12% of the sea‚Äôs total mass comes from people complaining about Freddy being ‚Äòunplayable‚Äô alone.
---
Just wanna play some dbd geez
---
Dedicated servers are already out.
---
Yea, this is definitely not allowed here.
---
alright i‚Äôll take it down if necessary, thank you for the clarification.
---
it's what he deserves
---
Did you record the whole thing? If not, you have no case.
---
Im sorry what?
---
I feel like it makes sense to get hit on the other side if you're close, as realistically, you can get hit through a window.
---
// If ya'll can't find her either, pause at 9-11 seconds.
---
Since when? The survivor I did that to didn't know that either.
---
Dude can you fuck off with this shit
---
I know, these are so much better :‚Äôf
---
Was there a reason as to why they removed it?
---
featuring aids icons
---
I shall not rest till her nostrils are filled with cum, sir.
---
At least the survivors would know going in that they were going to go up against a high ranked killer. The killer has no idea what the survivors' ranks are until the end of the match. 
---
Also, once again, as I've said umpteen times before on this thread, it doesn't matter how many kills I get. It's the principle of the thing. A rank 4 survivors should never be going against a yellow rank killer in the first place. 
---
&gt;Dont ya think it would also be unfair if they would go against a rank 4 killer? Ofc not.
---
So it's not fine to not force low rank survivors to go up against high rank killers, but it's perfectly ok to force a low rank killer to go up against high rank survivors? Fuck no. That's biased thinking.
---
FOV slider is a terrible idea, there's a reason killers have base FOV
---
Wait, I know you there's no mistake you have commited crimes against skyrim and her people what say you in your defence?
---
There's gotta be several in the running for scyther
---
When you're finally going to hit or down a survivor on console and then Bloodlust activates and everything is ruined and immeasurable
---
That's enough internet for the... week.
---
Prison cannot hold me, Milk drinker. My pure will cannot be hindered by these bars.
---
Yes , and I also have proof from the killer, He sent me a message saying ‚Äúnot my fault you no wanna farm, that on you‚Äù

Since the end game collapse was introduced.
---
I dropped in a lobby as huntress with 2 gruesomes and a sealed envelope. Assumed they wanted BP then some sweaty P3 kept trying to rush the match. So I strung them up and face camped them while watching the other 3 leave. I had fun.
---
happens as survivor when you fake a window but the killer just holds W lol
---
You heard me comrade. Join the fight
---
That's just disgusting and i could be wrong but im pretty sure this is borderline harassment at this point
---
Not when you're super new at the game and get punished for not having the perks that everyone else has.
---
dumb
---
A tiny bit off topic, but today i bought a new mouse (SteelSeries 62433 Rival 310 Gaming Mouse), and it helps SO MUCH with this game lol. I can look behind during chases with so much more ease than before. And yea high sensitivity helps a lot especially if u want to 360
---
The plague and the spirit are what I consider next level when it comes to design/lore. In lore, they basically went through hell and they‚Äôre ready to kick ass, and their design shows it off
---
Nurse, her lore is so sad and horrifyingly realistic.
---
That's really rapey
---
Nah, just because "first missed skillcheck" is too vague.
---
No please... please don‚Äôt nerf my boi...
---
Heck i bought it back in April for 11 bucks on ps4.
---
Congratulations on the new mouse! I am terrible at 360ing even with high sensitivity XD
---
You should never _have_ to run a perk just to counter another perk. Like old Decisive and Enduring. It's bad design and shouldn't be encouraged.
---
But the beauty is that end game is a work-around for glitches like this. Instead of fixing bugs, they patch them ( Mickey Mouse jobs ) to keep everything ‚Äúworking as intended‚Äù. This is a good work-around for hostage situation/ this specific bug.
---
*As usual, I must apologize to anyone that I may have spoiled the SOS to. I understand the feeling of wanting to be surprised and I am sorry. I just wanted to make sure that people could get the heads up on what‚Äôs on the agenda.*
---
No I don't think I will.
---
He gets alerted when you look at him?
---
A harlot such as her is not capable of consent, but that is not the point. It is not personal gain or pleasure I derive from this goal, but fate itself that drives me. I am an agent of Will, it guides me.
---
I‚Äôm rank 10 and play like a rank 20
---
Why are you booing him? He is right!
---
I got it for free almost a year ago when it was one of the free games for PS Plus members :/
---
So you're a rapist?
---
No, I am The Schnoz Spunker
---
Ya but i dont have ps plus rn and can still play cause i bought it using ps plus. And still its worth the money.
---
I got DBD in a sale on PSN about 2 years ago for like ¬£13.
---
Still play it to this day, and own all the DLC's. Best ¬£13 i ever spent lol.
---
Hope you get banned you weird fuck. This is a sub about the game for people that play the game. Not disgusting dudes promoting and joking about sexual harassment
---
Just play civilization
---
Just how Unrelenting and Third Seal have their places.
---
But there's a difference between OP and toxic. Being toxic is going out of your way to bm someone or something like that. Example is tbagging, hitting the hooked survivor, excessive head nodding and stuff like that. Playing a killer and wanting to win is not toxic. Just like survivors using strong perks or items are not toxic. Its what you do with it that makes it toxic.
---
Cease your white knight faggotry and join the cause. TOGETHER, WE SHALL BATHE HER NASAL PASSAGE WAYS WITH CUM
---
Oh boy. Another one of these
---
Honestly I think it's like that cause the game is literally 80% survivors. Of course there's more salt from them cause there's more of them. That being said this is the only game where people actually message me post game to bitch and moan. Like seriously wtf is with this community? Since when did being a sore loser become fashionable?
---
not hostile,,,, all wholesome!!!!
---
It's like whenever I play a killer that has a few special effects and my ping just raises to 900 for looking at a survivor.
---
So, I've had quite a few games where I've been killer doing pretty well for a fng and having one or two of the survivors give up and we teabag and run around. I normally give the last one the hatch.
---
Anyway I've heard this is a bannable offense. 
---
Is it really or have i been misinformed?
---
I agree. I‚Äôve definitely seen it get used plenty when a killer is about to bloodlust or just catch up to a survivor right before they get to a pallet on a loop. The survivor dead Garda for the extra distance, and either the pallet is dropped on the killer or he fakes out the pallet, the killer swings and misses, and the loop continues some more. Big brain plays
---
I honestly hate scum like you. It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôll make sure you get reported. Cease your creepy ass fucking faggotry and go suck a fucking dick.
---
I seriously doubt this person expects to play DBD forever. Do you? What game lasts forever? Tattoos grow and change meanings with time along with you. A tattoo that you get as a teenager to mean a specific thing becomes a tattoo about that time in your life when you are older.
---
This. You can get rank 1 with a perkless freddy, people have done it before.
---
Imo it makes him a lot cooler but I see how you could think that
---
That's probably the coolest Saw tattoo I've seen. Nice.
---
Youre creepy as Hell and need to be banned
---
Its the worst. It always happens if I swing just as bloodlust pops. Everything will freeze for a sec then itll all come back and the survivor looks like they teleported just out of my range. Sometimes it happens when they have deadhard but usually I can see the end of the lung and it makes sense but other times...
---
Yes it is bm. But this post is specifically about T-bagging and not overall BM.
---
I mean... name checks out.
---
It's cheaper to buy a Chapter via DLC if you want both Survivor &amp; Killer ($7 for DLC Vs $10 using Cells)
---
Leatherface DLC gives the Black and Blue head cosmetic for Dwight iirc.
---
How‚Äôd you get off the shoulder right before you escape?
---
This is pretty hot.
---
Dude what the hell are you talking about nothing you say makes any sense
---
Yeah, but Ace in the hole was like two or three weeks ago
---
Not a person from the game, good sir. But a frequenter of this board. Bvbyscorpio666 is what she goes by, and she must repent for her virgin nostrils.
---
I actually just got the 4K trophy an hour ago; I used the Spirit with Hex: Devour Hope.   
---
All that's left is the hatch trophy, so I'll definitely add you as a friend on my PS account for the help. I'm ganymede425.
---
?
---
i‚Äôve made it to and held my place in red ranks as a doctor main
---
you can be good at any killer and still do work
---
Same here, except it's only been a year and a half for me. The reason it isn't bought in the picture is because it is my separate account :)
---
You misunderstand. There is no sexual excitement to my goal. Only pure will. It does not matter If I want to or not, I only now that fate wills me to do so.
---
Nea's lore is believable to me. Claudette's too. I feel bad for her, as I do for many of the other survivors. Nea, Claud, Meg, Kate, Jane, and Dwight have good designs and cosmetics imo. As for killers, I think Legion, Nurse, Plague, and Spirit are all visually interesting, have believable lore, and have decent cosmetics.
---
r/DBD mods: bans Glen0ck
---
Also r/DBD mods: Leave these topics going.
---
Nice
---
Cry hard. Snort my semen harder.
---
I was fully aware of this. Though I still chose to play this way. I dont know why.
---
Sometimes assholes need to be dealt with lol
---
I always have that. Best thing is: if I play killer it also lags for survivors. So I get accused of lagswitching on a daily basis
---
You are completely correct.
---
Glad to hear someone else gets this issue. Seems like it‚Äôs only when I play DBD too, it was so bad at one point that it was DC‚Äôing me from games. (This is coming from someone with a decently well equipped PC)
---
Sometimes assholes need to be felt with
---
So it's not enough to harass a redditor, but now you're now sexually harassing and stalking them on PS4. 
---
Enjoy sitting in jail. When the cops ask you what your problem is - just admit it: You're autistic and don't know any better.
---
You the dude that was banned for liking Pig so much?
---
It is, as rank doesn't necessarily equal rarity ie some perks are purple by tier 2 while others are still green by tier 3.
---
Tbh I don't even know how to use the glass bead.
---
¬´¬†outskilled¬†¬ª
---
The cold walls and bars of prison cannot hold my pure will and power. My destiny burns brighter and hotter than any iron that they try to trap me in.
---
Why don‚Äôt you try saying that to someone when it‚Äôs not over the internet?
---
This is about me. He literally won‚Äôt stop harassing me. I haven‚Äôt even replied to any of his messages hahaha.
---
A couple days ago I was in a swf where we were both in around the same range (I was rank 6, he was rank 9) and our teammates e ded up being rank 13 and rank 10. To make things worse, we no joke had a rank 20 killer. This matchmaking really sucks
---
Thank you.
---
I‚Äôm the opposite. I find her going through walls and such not very fun to go against
---
Cant deny that Jake‚Äôs pretty cute.
---
Just try and escape me harlot.
---
Bill is dead in l4d, Amanda and Tapp are dead in Saw, and Spirit was basically dead
---
No problem as survivor just killer queues are horrible.
---
Why is Ace in the hole back?! It was here like 2 weaks ago...
---
Hey bud, friend pulled your IP, been screen shotting these messages for the past couple hours, emailed local PD. Truly suggest you stop.
---
Common sense tells me that no-one would think pu is op, let alone say ‚Äùi dont use it quz its too op‚Äù, guess i was wrong
---
There it is, the lightning fast reply trying to deny and justify, as if that will somehow undo the trouble you have caused for yourself. I can pretty much smell the fear from here, lmao.
---
Guess you're unlucky, because BHVR changed that ages ago.
---
Thats not what they said. You cannot get banned because of this. HOWEVER, if you get banned and the game knows that you changed the game files then they wont unban you
---
RIGHT. I started leveling up legion today. Got Tinkerer 1,2,3 right after one another. üòû Like thanks entity, could‚Äôve given me BBQ or Ruin but thanks.
---
If so thank you and your friend you guys have done a great thing. Have a great day man.
---
The old method was (number of remaining survivors + 1) gens needed to be complete for the hatch to spawn. That meant 2 had to be done minimum for the last survivor to even have a hatch.
---
Since the egc patch, it will spawn and open for the last survivor regardless of gens, but the spawn rules are the same for multiple survivors, like if you want to use a key.
---
Where the fuck are the mods???
---
I don‚Äôt stand for shit like that, it‚Äôs disgusting and uncalled for.
---
Unsure if he can see you over gens like I can still leveling (him up cause I had three other killers left) I will say when I'm playing survivor I have not had the shitty problems with detecting him it's been very consistent I'm pretty good at spotting him before he spots me and revealing after wards. Very consistent. Mixed feelings about being able to reveal him behind certain objects but I've noticed there are objects he can stalk over that you cant reveal so it balances out a bit.
---
This speaks to me on a spiritual level.
---
Dude, I‚Äôve been in contact with my uncle at Microsoft and for the last hour have been watching you under 24 hour surveillance. I have a death laser pointer at ur house, I hope you reconsider
---
"Admit you overreacted"
---
*proceeds to say disgusting rapey shit and post pictures of nut on reddit, and borderline harass some stranger.*
---
Go jump off a microwave.
---
Your use of the words "Good boy points" shows that your ARE just some edgy shitposter from 4chan, and I recommend going back there.
---
Watching the grass move as they rug through it is the most accurate way to see where they are
---
Riiiggghhtt. I can email you or message you the actual screen shots bud.
---
I hate the term gen rusher so much lmao. How can you get mad at someone for doing the objective. Imagine you were playing league and someone called you a ‚ÄúNexus Rusher‚Äù
---
I'm going to share with you a sad story. A story about a 14 year old boy who thought he was being cool and edgy harassing people online. That is, until he harassed the wrong person, was found out, and then grilled by a Capitol Police detective for three hours. He was kicked out of his house and spent the next two years in a juvenile facility. Because of the nature of his delinquent behavior, he was denied internet access the entire time. He met other people like him and worse - people so devoid of humanity that there was no coming back for some of them. When he was released, he wanted to apologize to his victims but knew he never could, less he wanted to end up back in that facility. He finished high school, joined the marines, went overseas, and came back an honorable person now with a loving wife. 
---
That's the story of my brother. You may just see them as /u/bvbyscorpio, but that's a person. Keep it up and one day you're gonna harass the wrong person.
---
Cool.
---
Ok bud
---
Don't worry, next week on shrine will be dance with me and spirit fury, maybe even enduring.
---
We already do. It's up to the survivors to punish the killer for doing it during the match though, don't expect the game to do everything for you.
---
Honestly
---
*snorts cocaine furiously*
---
Yea i'm kinda surprised this kids shit isn't being instantly taken down by now
---
Wtf is this? This is plain disturbing I'm sure it's illegal in some part of the world. Just fuck off already with these posts
---
This has happened to me few times :/
---
Kinda a load of shit that some players may be banned by using a perk.
---
I'm guessing west coast with a 10:30 bed time
---
I appreciate your flair
---
Hey if you need anything let me know
---
Ikr. It‚Äôs the same thing with the legion blade addons some people don‚Äôt know.
---
Devs confirmed that's unintended, and that whoever starts first should win.
---
Inb4 shirty come back
---
No, it just uses a cooler animation
---
Can we get a Jane body pillow though? Asking for a friend here too.
---
I‚Äôve been running into so many killers that do this. It‚Äôs like, just end the flipping game already lol
---
Yea! I'm trying to adept the plague....but the entity keeps giving me everyone else's perks.
---
it doesn't matter how good the graphics and textures are unless the code is good. 
---
technically you can code a game with decent graphics to fit on a floppy disk so...
---
okay
---
Consoles did take over lol. PC is a niche market when compared to consoles, hence why no big publishers are PC focused anymore. Also PCs are only superior machines when you build one yourself with top of the line parts. Most PCs you‚Äôd buy in a store are either shit for gaming or ridiculously overpriced
---
That's why as soon as every match starts I'll either find the basement and do the closest gen, or find the middle gen and power through.
---
What's the point of even messaging them? Just move on lol
---
Yeah i agree, I just think it‚Äôs frustrating that, as a survivor, you‚Äôre meant to break him out of stealth, but doing so puts you kinda in danger. But I also understand that if ghostface didn‚Äôt know where survivors are looking at him from, his power would be too weak. It‚Äôs a tough situation
---
Literally bought the game 3 days ago at full price. Feels bad man
---
Okay so here is the situation I'm curious on the communities thoughts. So very early infinite tier three Meyers due to over altruism and lack of survivors able to handle ruin. So as we prolong the inevitable two survivors are running borrowed time. As Myers walks away from a hook to find other survivors do you wait for his inevitable return to hit the hooked with BT in Hope's to prolong a loop or go for immediate save? Recent situation me and my brother were in.
---
I wish I could see it, but I don't. Meg with her bob looks more reminiscent of Sid (Scream 2, Scream 3). It would be so much fun to reenact scenes in game :D
---
Gen rushing is definitely a real thing. 4 dwights all running leader with green toolboxes, on comms with eachother so they can just 3man a gen while the other one loops the killer. It's really only a thing in SWF I guess
---
Roulette Spirit is the most painful thing to play against imo. Worse than Mirror Myers, Tombstone Myers, Nurse, Billy, whatever. Roulette Spirit can go die.
---
I see. Thanks for the information, I usually flip flop between survivor and killer. Mostly to know what the other side is doing so I can counter it. Is it possible to do continual flashlight blinds back to back?
---
Yeah but that is a phone, who goes through that much effort just to trash talk someone?
---
they did not. big publisher are still pc exclusive and most console publishers optimize the games for pc. 
---
for instance, Dark Souls being transferred to pc might have trash menu but the gameplay fps and control wise is superior. 
---
the fact that more consoles were sold and they don't go away is because they cost like nothing. quantity over quality. all professional gaming is still on pc because it is and will always be more stable and powerful machine.
---
I already got my cells back the costumer support is amazing
---
Exactly lol. I get that he has to know from which angle he‚Äôs being seen so that he can hide, but it feels unfair that breaking ghostface out of stealth ALSO ruins your own stealth
---
I just got on Reddit and saw this I‚Äôm sorry I took care of it.
---
Do explain your logic
---
Was I the only one waiting for Myers to mori him?
---
i think ballerina Min looks stupid =\
---
Bunny Feng when???
---
Thank you Noah.
---
3 Gen isn't an issue unless you are bad. If there are 3 gens left then just work on them. If the killer chases you run to the other side of the map. Either killer follows and your team keeps working or he let's you run away and you get points towards the being chased emblem
---
I mean to be fair they are good perks, they just don't really fit into the more meta high rank aggressive playstyle.
---
What big publisher is still PC focused? Blizzard? Try again. Valve? Nadda. Every big company releases their games on consoles because they actually want it to sell. PC gaming isn‚Äôt mainstream and it won‚Äôt be for years until the high cost of entry is reduced.
---
I bet if you make custom portraits, all of them just like this, people will use them. These are pretty neat!
---
You should stop yourself. I know I can't.
---
I saw y‚Äôall had applications for more mods a while back. Did that ever happen? You‚Äôre the only one I see.
---
I'm the king of the swingers
---
yeah, imagine ranking system being applied to distinguish newer players from experienced ones making a casual game into competitive game? weird haha
---
yeah, not happening. this is literally same game as Deceit.
---
I avoided hooks, set you down by a generator, then set another survivor I downed near you. Qnd I'm repaid by bnp and firecrackers!?
---
Windows are a totally separate issue. From a latency perspective I try makes sense how your hurt box still hasnt cleared the window on the hosts game state even if it has on yours.
---
This was ridiculous not only due to the reach, but the fact that the lunge wind-up on the hag now has her teleport towards like she's on a fucking segway. Her lunge hits from way too far away.
---
I once very purposefully 3-gen'd the survivors as the Doctor in order to grind out the achievement requiring 500 shocks. I am positive those survivors absolutely hated it.
---
They are not the best but they are better than most
---
You have like a %1 to face that. And if you do don't do the totems so they can't grab, just die from devour ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
PsyDoc
---
Can I have that template please?
---
im still learning the game could you tell me how to make a aggressive build?
---
Urban: probably the worst of those 3 but still has its uses. Combos well with diversion and stake out to more easily farm the ability. Hard counters Hag. Strong for stealth builds which are integral to countering Nurse. 
---
Sprint burst: lmao. Overall probably the worst exhaustion perk imo, but that's like saying it's the ugliest pretty girl. 
---
Self Care: low quality bait.
---
&gt; He's going to be easier to reveal
---
As opposed to now where you can literally stand on top of survivors and stalk them without being broken out.
---
&gt;his stalk time add ons are being nerfed
---
Yeah because being able to stack two of them and borderline instantly stalk someone is bullshit. It basically gave him instant instant downs.
---
&gt;BuT iT's NoT a NeRf CoS kIlLeR iNsTiNcT aDd OnS aRe BeInG bUfFeD.
---
Careful your killer main is showing.
---
Balancing the killer and fixing the broken aspects about him are a nerf only in the technical aspect. As he is now hes busted, there are matches where he gets broken instantly and matches where despite being in the open he can't be broken at all.
---
So did he got uppercut to death to be sent flying like that?
---
Haha, that‚Äôs amazing
---
Feng Min Subway
---
Thank you
---
Or gen rush exists
---
It would look more like Balanced landing, Adrenaline, Hope, Borrowed time. You can change out Hope and BT for some other perks, but the perks OP mentioned are perfectly fine for when you're new and just learning the game. I used all 3 when I first started and I wouldn't advise someone else not to.
---
Its better to learn how to loop and stuff before worrying about the perfect build.
---
excuse me? Valve is literally Steam. they produce games for both pc and consoles. but you seem to ignore the fact consoles don't even have Bill lol.
---
anyway, big companies make games for both sides for exception of exclusives. it's money, they don't care for what is better. consoles sell better like cheap cars. doesn't mean no one buys expensive good cars, ya know.
---
Flashlight saving isn't toxic. Being a dick about it and t bagging/body blocking is. So no
---
Thanks
---
YEs that happens SOOO MUCH ma every single game in my 2k hours.. except not even once. The Term Gen Rush is used when the Killer is too dumb to do what he is supposed to do so he complains that he gave the survivors so much time they could do their objectiv quickly :)
---
Yes daddy tap but the other outfit with the brown leather jacket .
---
Nah ggs
---
My David is Level 25, dunno if i want to lvl him now, or if i shall just buy it and let david die in this lvl  xDD
---
thank you also im a solo player so is there any replacement for adrenaline?
---
Every fucking time I want to chainsaw as Billy, my PC is pure dogshit...
---
This is disgusting I‚Äôm sorry your getting dragged into it
---
Exchange billy with spirit I guess. I feel billy is super fun to play and play against. Hes strong but not too strong. Nurse is fine if there is no tripple blink, fast blink addon BS involved  and spirit is annoying and 99.999999% of the time played by cunts.
---
To be fair, when you‚Äôre playing as Hag you feel about a foot tall.
---
be sure i will play dirty if someone brought this offering.
---
But the hag isn‚Äôt even in the picture
---
For me they just automatically pop up when I launch the game
---
i start opening one gate and let it so when a killer checking it again it start searching after me close to that door.. if im lucky a had enough time to open the another.
---
Same for me but that doesn‚Äôt mean people will read it
---
Thanks, buddy.
---
I think he meant like... standing to the side?
---
 Because horsey bou
---
well i had a game with full swf where 3 people had Wake Up and 3 toolboxes with two bnps on them. and i had no ruin or anything for gens apart from Thrilling Tremors lol. very fun. loved it.
---
I saw someone post this and I tried it once and it worked but it really depends on how far apart they are. Your best chance if youre not already found is to chill at a gate until its safe then open the gate for about 4 seconds enough to get like 20% done but without a light turning on. Then stop and wait for the killer to return and leave again and finish it up as fast as you can. Like I said it really depends on how far apart they are if theyre too close you gonna die if they have wispers you gonna die. 
---
Another way to do it is if you know where the hatch is you can stand next to the gate and wait for the killer to find it and you can imediately start working on the gate with the above trick or maybe the whole thing if you have that time.
---
Stay on a door but do it to 20%. The red light won't show and when the killer doesn't notice the red light and turns around to check the other gate then finish it.
---
If the killer has Whispers, high mobility, or is a Trapper then it's unlikely you'll get out unless you have perfect RNG with the hatch spawning far away from a gate a killer checks the wrong gate first.
---
They're probably a part of the Entity now, and they will go if the Entity goes. Which may never happen if the Entity is anything like whatever upholds our physical universe. But this still doesn't mean they're ever dead or killed.
---
The scenario actually reminds me of the forever trapped "survivors" inside the A.I. of I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream.
---
Honestly I can never even Stalk a person fully lul. I just play him for fun.
---
Might as well just buy it, I only buy shrine teachables if my survivor or killer is level 1-10
---
Jane, then Myers My friend hopes.
---
cant we all just enjoy console and pc
---
Wait tf? I just started using wake up yesterday and I love it, I had no clue it was doing that.. if I get banned I swear
---
yeah, sure. i just don't get why people would get same quality for lower price *shrug*
---
Killer can't camp or tunnel you if you don't get caught. You also aren't entitled to more than one hook.
---
NOED is completely counterable. Before it ever even comes into play.
---
Ebony Moris are rare and like all Moris require conditions to be met before they can be used.
---
Killers aren't obligated to farm with you. Ever.
---
Are some these things unfortunate when they happen? Sometimes, very, yes. But survivors are not the power role.
---
If they stop releasing DLC's they will get so much hate. Because idk if you know but they get shit on for everything they do.
---
Eh, I never let survivors bleed out. I want my points and can wait out the DS timer if need be.
---
She's a bit on the flat side
---
I laughed at this harder than id ever wanna admit
---
That's an option too as it seems that sometimes it takes a while for someone to revive a teammate
---
Shame on u
---
Where‚Äôs Hags???
---
Just level up trapper. Never buy perks that are available by leveling.
---
Oh frank, you sly dog you
---
This looks so cool, dude. Also pet ur dog for me
---
Uhh I don't really know, back then I just have played Sims 2 on Playstation 2 and now Sims 4 on PC. I mainly play it because I like to set up the houses haha.
---
Go look at it, it‚Äôs free fam
---
Carl the Cashier was a character present in the Ghostface Trailer. For whatever reason, the community really liked him and wants him to be a playable character.
---
As for the bloodweb it'll go for an unclaimed perk first, after it runs out of options it'll then go for items furthest from the core first with rarity taking priority if there are multiple choices available.
---
Oh boy I haven't touched Smite in a while. Who did they break now? Last time I played was last year, and Mercury was just gone for what seemed like weeks.
---
Finishing the last gen to see the killer speed up a bit is a good indicator to whether they have noed or not.
---
E X T R A T H I C C
---
Last update, when jormandgandr was added, they broke one of my mains (xing tian) for over a month.
---
This time both merlin AND set (one of the two newest gods) are broken.
---
Yeah it's true but makes the grind alot easier so I can focus on killers like leatherface and the hag to get their perks.
---
What you have a problem with her power ignoring essential game mechanics? How dare you!
---
Most survivors I kill never message me, but I do get the occasional demand to kill myself for hooking someone O_O
---
You have to get creative to get his stalk off now that survivors have wisened up. Mt. Ormand Resort is a fantastic map for Ghostie because it has one central place with a second story and great view that survivors never seem to think to look at or go in.
---
It also works from surprisingly far away.
---
I don‚Äôt go for the injured one. Heck, I play Billy, the way I see it, *EVERYONE* is injured.
---
Lack of reliable counterplay. Recently I saw some killer main streamers complain about her as well, felt so good.
---
No. The poor man was troubled and should rest in peace, not be used as a cash grab while those who cared about him watch his animated version die repeatedly for gameplay.
---
These are awesome, gonna download in the morning!
---
Do you disagree?
---
Yeah, I turned of my messages a while back. I like to argue, and, well, I get baited easily into these nonsense back and forth shenanigans.
---
But yeah, before that, I got shit posts all the time.
---
*has Spirit flair*
---
You‚Äôre the boss üòÇ
---
I love trapper I never fail to get 3 to 4 kills with him and honestly i would love to see him get buffed
---
Pop is way better then Overcharge. 
---
Pop is amazing Run pop!
---
Hello I play on and off and am generally bad at the game. Did I miss an update or something. I normally play survivor but sometimes play as killer for change of pace and I feel like I am getting outrun by every survivor and it‚Äôs making playing this game unbearable. Like really takes the fun out of it. Also I‚Äôm playing against people who have pallet locations memorized which is the worst but I digress. Am I missing a new mechanic to increase killer speed that I should know about?
---
Also this is neither here nor there but I got my first pm after a game today which was nice but it was against griefers which wasn‚Äôt really fun to play.
---
Are upvotes like likes?
---
Was he a avid dbd player?
---
 It it is deserving of a nerf
---
You must be new, trust me leveling characters to 40 is not the hard part of the grind. Unless you have a bunch of shards which I doubt don't waste them.
---
I've been finding a LOT of toxic killers lately, too. The new hatch-shutting and endgame collapse has resulted in a LOT of killer toxicity. Like, A LOT. 
---
(And for anyone wondering - I don't play toxic as a survivor)
---
I am considering replacing blood warden with Pop for a Pop Overcharge combo. Thoughts?
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Wow. She's like a ghost just floating past....lol
---
Self care's easily outshined by the BASIC BROWN MEDKIT, I doubt once per game I ever need to self care more than once. And the time it takes to selfcare could be used towards repairing gens and just getting a quicker more efficient heal through adrenaline.
---
Is this about that crazy user who kept posting about doing something to another user?
---
Yeah. Lately it seems like all the NOED killers I'm running into are instadown killers... Like... WHY
---
I tell you, I was one Nea in a match of three immersed Claudettes. Only got found and downed once, and it was at the end. To notice her Urban-Evasioning her way opposite of the hooked Claud in front of her, though... Tsk tsk lol. At least we got a 4-man escape.
---
Wtf is wrong with him like seriously Wtf?
---
**YES**
---
I wish every person playing this game would read, and understand, that post.
---
Self care is like ruin it slows down the game for survivors yet it's not a killer perk, and is easily outshined by a brown medkit.
---
Sprint burst is the worst exhaustion perk you can't save it for real situations where you need it, and you have to walk around the map to save it.
---
Urban Evasion is undeniably garbage, you can crouch walk as fast as you can walk which is extremely useless. I've personally never needed to play stealthily though when I do I never have to move AND crouch walk quickly. In situations where you don't need to crouch running is better.
---
This weird shit happens sometimes where I'll click to hit or down a survivor, but literally nothing happens... happened with my old shitty mouse and my newer Steelseries mouse too.
---
How much do the lockers hide and how much they don't?
---
1. They shield you from BBQ and Chili.
---
2. They don't protect you from killer instinct (in case of legion or the perk Infectious Fright).
---
3. They used not protect you against Freddy's dreamworld aura reading but now apparently they do.
---
4. Do they conceal from survivor aura reading perks like bond and empathy? What about survivor items like keys?
---
5. Do they conceal you from killer addons like the one's gotten by Myers, Pig, Wraith?
---
6. And finally, how does Object of Obsession work in this scenario?
---
I would really like if you guys can correct and vet these assumptions.
---
Why do you think it's a good idea to add a character based on a real person in a purely fictional horror game?
---
Anything to detract from their own shitty gameplay.
---
Shadowborn gives you a greater field of view by 15 degrees. Lightborn makes flashlights take much longer to blind you and being blind has a much shorter duration.
---
Thats fair if you don‚Äôt think you need it. Another perk combo idea I had was Distressing and Infectious Fright for a literal Scream build, but Infectious Fright doesn‚Äôt do much for you unless those survivors are injured or marked.
---
That Wraith is well hidden.
---
Tbh I'm not sure why it was added specifically to The Spirit in the first place lmao. Amanda never had it, not Nurse, Plague, Hag, Huntress, or Julie/Susie.
---
Yeah true might delete this post then
---
What is the alternative
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really run overcharge at all. Overcharge is a mediocre perk. Depending on what rank you are in it could be good with people missing skill checks.
---
Yeah and then people killing themselves as a joke. I was never a fan and didn't even know what he did but come on the guy killed himselve don't make jokes about it.
---
Lightborn makes it harder to be blinded and reduced time you spend blinded. Shadowborn increases your field of view and therefore makes you easier to blind as it would take longer to get the flashlight out of your FOV
---
Face camping and tunneling never disappeared lol. Just depends who you‚Äôre playing with
---
...a literal Scream Build would be truly amazing.
---
And yeah Shadowborn ehh but Lightborn...perhaps I should do that. I always thought of running Franklin's Demise if people bring in flashlights but Lightborn seems way better.
---
Changed actions to L3, or left stick, so you can heal and do other actions at pallets/vaults without accidentally using them.
---
Hmm. I'll swap it for Pop for a little while and see how it goes. Thanks!
---
How is he still shit?
---
I got stalk off through an angle in corn once lmao.
---
Use a map offering if you don‚Äôt want Coldwind tho.
---
He should be in. Death is not an escape. Detective Tapp died and woke up in the Entity's realm.
---
Yeah, let's do this. Because DbD players are known for their patience and they are not prone to shittalk devs over 15 minutes delays on cosmetics release or event beginning. Right?
---
Change bloodhound to nurse calling. I dont think the highlighted blood is that helpfull. Nurse calling works pretty good on every killer with a tiny terrorradius and stealth abilitiy. When you lose a survivor in a chase you prob gonna be able to see him/her healing after that and manage to sneak up on them. Many survivors heal up in loops with high walls wich also can help you with mindgames. 
---
Also for every decend build i wouldnt choose blood warden. Dont get me wrong blood warden is actually a great perk and i love to see people useing it but i think its better not to use endgame perks. Most of the time bloodwarden wont help you. Survivors put gates on 99 % and only open when they have too or they are secure to get out.
---
You gotta be lucky to make it work.
---
For ghostface you might gonna take Surveillance instead.
---
Very helpfull for ghostface to locate survivors and sneak up to them
---
Shouldn't Cubone be Trapper, since his mask is made of bone?
---
You get that pretty much all the time on regular ps4. I hope that in the next patches they help with console frame issues
---
I really like the party starters. I didn‚Äôt ever play in any other events so i‚Äôve only used them in kill your friends previously, but i never even really use them bc i forget i have it on me i just think they are pretty. Right now i‚Äôve collected 125 for this event. Love them.
---
Yeah no problem I hope it goes well for you. 
---
Also I like thrilling tremors but don‚Äôt take my advice on that perk I may just be special.
---
The only acceptable form of this is to down a survivor when the gates are opened and see if they make it
---
Yeah dude also survivors should have gunz too so they can kill the killer.
---
I tried Surveillance and just couldn't understand the benefits of it. I would be willing to try Nurse's Calling instead of Blood Warden but I really like bloodhound and don't want to lose it :(
---
It's not the highlight that works for me is that I can get turned around easily so the red marks lasting longer are what works for me. I mean, don't get me wrong, the highlight is neat and all, but it's the longevity that does it for me.
---
But I see your point about nurse's calling. That said, if I use Ghostface's power, doesn't that mean he has no terror radius and thus not able to use Nurse's Calling? At least that's my understanding, am I wrong?
---
Lightborn is better for just dealing with flashlights, but Franklins counters every item.
---
I hope so, cause it really affects the chase and always seems to come at the wrong time.
---
Some'a times its'a 4k. Some'a times its'a complete shitshow of fucking up all the blinks, inpassable walls, and broken dreams.
---
You can play against me any time add me on PSN Ekopingviini and we'll see who's a shit killer :)
---
Haha, I got the [same design](https://imgur.com/a/ME7Nfa5), but without the blood and an added sheen to the knife.
---
I pretty much do the same. Good luck with the build though.
---
I believe current WoO is better and is more reliable then your remake since you have to hope they play a mori. Otherwise yeah I think the perk changes are interesting. I would keep my eye on boil over. Also the quick in and out locker trick might work with that perk.
---
I should not need to use a map offering for a killer to be viable.
---
Also yes I too got a stalk off once as Myers in corn, even though I never found who it was.
---
It is possible, you could keep them blinded as long until the flashlight runs out, but it would require the killer not to look away from it.
---
Yeah looking back at Kate and Laurie I should swap their hair colors around. Maybe make Kate's hair closer to Meg's.
---
I'm also starting to think I should change Meg's hair.
---
Did he actually post a pic of what you said?
---
If so what the actual fuck is wrong with him how can someone be this insane i thought he was just joking or trolling but Jesus Christ
---
Welcome to the entity realm!
---
Yeah, I could add an extra effect to WoO so it doesn't depend on the release of a new killer or a killer bringing in a mori.
---
I think the DWM effect could be paired with Lithe, but that's just me.
---
Boil over sounds too strong lol, I might adjust it.
---
There was a long period where i didnt have that and it was wonderful....
---
Seems to be back
---
...
---
Salty killers are always going to be salty
---
As a killer main, UH OH
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox sorry Chief, and even so how the fuck would we compare killers? Would we go into a match and see who gets more kills because that introduces hella variables like SWF, maps, killers, addons, survivor load out, hex totem spawns, ETC.
---
Yes, just need to work out a few of the things.
---
I was wondering why lunges suddenly seemed absurd!!
---
Lovely
---
&gt; Did he actually post a pic of what you said?
---
I'm not OP, I don't know
---
Update : the hammer and the toolbox with be about the same speed.
---
Oh, and if you want to go for another type of build that can put pressure on survivors in chase then use BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. This build I always use for Hillbilly and Myers due to their ability to one hit down survivors.
---
unfortunately it was on the shrine just a few cycles (2-4) ago so I have literally nothing to get from this shrine Q\_Q
---
Check my update, helped a bit
---
A lot of killers do this to me. I don't even play toxic :(((
---
That artist is talented as hell it's a beautiful piece.

On second thought I'd rather not know
---
Ok
---
I'm doing this from now on. Thank you kind Redditor.
---
Id still play. Comment on the killer. Wait for the next one.
---
Np
---
Nowadays, though, killers tunnel survivors with keys. Or if they see it in the pre-game lobby, they equip Franklin's just for the key.
---
I'd love for that to happen.
---
Some people here actually put together ideas for how he could function in game with unique perks and backstory for him
---
There‚Äôs also a straight up dbd copy
---
Did it once with a rank 5 friend, that friend died because of me. It was both hilarious and informative.
---
happens to me all the time on PS. that's why I stopped playing killer there. NEver gonna play killer there.
---
If they buff 3 survivor perks they have to buff 4 killer perks.
---
I thought about Enduring but definitely not ruin. It always makes me sad and angry when it gets cleansed despite playing survivor just as often as a killer (I know it doesn't make sense but ugh). Can't run ruin, I know myself too well.
---
Ay man i fucked up. I‚Äôm actually pretty new to the game so I genuinly thought that original comment was just a salty comment from a whinging survivor, nor think that was such an outrageous comment. I didn‚Äôt clock onto Michaels power being involved. 80 downvotes was definitely deserved though :)))) but people complain about noed being too good, which I do disagree with if the survivors are smart enough. Matters what the killer build is tbf
---
Then he‚Äôs wrong too
---
I mean that series is garbage but more killers means more variety, I just wouldn‚Äôt personally buy it.
---
I'm not talking about buffing anything. I just came up with some ideas that could change Kate's design.
---
Why 4 killer perks?
---
Meh
---
Whats worse than toxic killers are shitty survivors who do 0 objectives on the map....oh wait......thats 95 percent of the survivors.
---
well im killer main, so i dont want to spent useless points on him, and the perk isnt unlocked at 30 ? or it's unlocked but random one of the three perks ?
---
im nearly new to this game, 3 weeks maybee
---
Is this making a comeback? I had this happen to me in 2016 when I used my first ebony mori.
---
There is a reason they are called killers.
---
Thx
---
Personally I don‚Äôt like the game I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun, scary or interesting so hard pass. But if they did it‚Äôs better then nothing. Maybe a fun/good killer with good perks I hope. 
---
But yeah not a fan of FNAF I don‚Äôt quite understand what‚Äôs entertaining about it. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
This is 100 percent a true statement....
---
Killer. Survivor.
---
Youre all toxic
---
Unfortunately probably not.
---
Survivors be like "I got a quarter!"
---
Killers be like "I got a rock."
---
Big meme Killer perks. Beast of Prey and Shadowborn. Two of the worst perks in the game and they're both free lol.  
---
Survivor perks are slightly better. Dead Hard and Ace in The Hole. Good chest farming perk and David's best perk if you don't want WGLF.
---
I'd suggest grabbing Ace Hole and ignoring the rest of this Shrine. Saves you from grinding Ace up at least.
---
Do you think the base design of this one would fit in ? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/five-nights-at-freddys/images/0/0b/Extra_Springtrap_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20160503190243&amp;path-prefix=fr ?

Good for you you have WGLF too.

Ever thought of using Ghostface's perk then? Block off generators after downing and picking a survivor up for 16 seconds. I use it on Trapper alongside Ruin and Haunted Ground. Hell, if you feel the need, use Haunted Ground to get that early advantage at the start.
---
Any time there is any lag  at all and the survivors are bad you are gonna get called a lagswitcher.
---
On console. Yes. Sometimes my frames drop to single digits mid chase. Not fun.
---
I've thought about it, but that's way i'm looking for advice as I've thought of a lot of perks.
---
That said I don't want to use any one hit down perks. I feel like if I can't get that from ghostface's power then I have no right playing as him.
---
&gt;As opposed to now where you can literally stand on top of survivors 
---
and stalk them without being broken out.
---
As opposed to now, where anyone halfway across the map can break you out of stealth, and any map with a second storey building is an instant loss.
---
&gt;Yeah because being able to stack two of them and borderline instantly stalk someone is bullshit. It basically gave him instant instant downs.
---
While stacking add ons should be nerfed, his base time to stalk is egregious. Nobody would ever suggest Myers would be balanced if he required a full tier to stalk AND could be put on a 30 second cooldown just for being seen.
---
&gt;Careful your killer main is showing.
---
The devs literally tried to say it wasn't a nerf because some add ons were buffed. The add ons that do literally nothing unless you're being broken out of your power often, and only serve as a consolation prize of "you knew where someone was because you were stalking them, but hey, there's someone over there."
---
His play rates are already abysmal. His mechanics are entirely unfun to play. Nerfing him without buffing the parts of him that need work is just going to put him on Plague tier of maybe seeing him once a month.
---
LMFAO
---
&gt; Any reason no survivot does gens on ps4 and runs around like a moron doing absolutely nothing?
---
Probably searching for totems or chests *or* they're very altruistic and follow the currently chased survivor to take a hit or land a flashlight save.
---
apileoftrash is my steam id the actual name is trash mammal and I'll give you my discord via steam!
---
Yo operation health didn't work with siege. Theyre on their fourth year and its a fucking shit show, theres still game breaking glitches and their matchmaking is even more botched. Their hitreg is even worse.
---
it would need slight alteration, but it's quite close
---
They conceal you from all aura reading and I believe location reveal as well. Killer instinct is the only way of detecting someone in a locker aside from sound.  
---
1. Yes.
---
2. Yes.
---
3. Yes they do.
---
4. Yes to all three.
---
5. Yes.
---
6. I'm not sure about this last one, but I'd assume that you wouldn't be able to see the killer and they wouldn't be able to see you but the perk would still light up when looking in their direction.
---
Do you mind telling me what these are? I‚Äôm kinda new to DBD, around 3 weeks of time (rank 9 console)
---
Fair point. It is pointless for those who can one hit down and it does frustrate me when I see for example Myers or Hillbilly players using it. I have seen some people use Play With Your Food on Ghostface. Seeing him faster than normal and being exposed is quite terrifying.
---
Naw that‚Äôs just a bug
---
I am glad you don't have that problem, the fewer people have to deal with it the better.
---
It'd be really nice for those that do have it tho. They addressed motion sickess problem people were having in clown's gas, I guess changing the fov would be more impactful.
---
So I rented black ops 4 for a day. The ps4 can handle 12 players running around, shooting and picking up guns, projectiles everywhere, objectives, etc with no problem. 
---
Getting bloodlust in DBD: frame rate shits on my chest
---
Yes I know dedicated servers has a lot to do with this. I‚Äôve honestly had many games change because of that fucking frame rate drop
---
Just as I thought: trash.
---
I'm on console tho
---
Too risky to unhook (killer will just farm you or down the rescuer and you). 
---
Other times it can be that everyone else thinks that someone else is going for the save so they do something else.
---
Or they're stupid.
---
Dont see any of that happening buddy....
---
This game has the highest DC rate ive ever seen.
---
How about the legion?
---
I didn't even notice, Neat
---
It has a place when you go against a swf on voice comms who have brought trong toolboxes, bnp/instaheals.
---
However for random survivors just looking for a chill game with no items then yeah it‚Äôs Op as hell.
---
Thats why rank reset sucks man
---
Ok?So just buy Leatherface and get him to level 35.He's $5.00
---
The DLC rarely goes on sale so I wouldn't wait until it's cheaper.   
---
You should focus on getting a character to level 50 first with unlocking their 4 perk slots in the meantime. Upon hitting level 50 you can either choose to level another character or prestige the current character you have. If by "trophies" you mean goals I have a few for you below:  
---
1. Reach Prestige III level 50 on a character.
---
2. Get a Survivor to level 50
---
3. Get a Killer to level 50
---
4. Reach rank 15 or below (the game considers you a newbie until you reach this rank, once you reach it you can no longer go below it.)
---
5. Try using an "OP" killer build (Tombstone Myers, Iridescent+Infantry Huntress, Prayer Beads spirit, Omega Nurse)
---
6. Burn an Ebony Mori and kill all 4 survivors.
---
7. Escape after the hatch has been closed and you are the last survivor alive.
---
8. Bring Slippery Meat (perk) and burn luck addons with your friends and try to pull yourself off the hook.
---
9. Try using sabotage strategies (putting a hook at 99% sabo progress and breaking it when the killer is carrying a person)
---
10. Learn the timing for flashlight stunning a killer when they are picking someone up.
---
11. Bring an Adrenaline Shot (red addon for medkit) and heal someone to full right in front of a killer who downed them.
---
12. Try farming with survivors as killer (be friendly and do actions that give you bloodpoints)
---
13. Bring blood warden as Killer and trap survivors in the trial when the endgame timer has less than 1 minute left
---
14. Hold a chase with a killer without getting downed for 2 minutes.
---
15. Sacrifice a survivor by running out the endgame timer.
---
16. Play a Kill your friends match with a full lobby.
---
17. Burn a Shroud of binding with Prove Thyself (perk) and 3 friends with toolboxes to complete a gen near *instantly*.
---
18. Obtain 5 tokens for Hex: Devour Hope and Mori a survivor.
---
19. Escape through a closed hatch using a dull key or a skeleton key.
---
20. Kill 2 or more survivors at least once with every killer.
---
Legion is bad conceptually.
---
My view (only viewing as I haven't had a chance to play him) is that he can do well, but you have to play smart.
---
Definitely don't tunnel, your power is good if you can deep wounds everyone but if you hit a deep-wounded person it depletes the meter. The deep wound health bar also doesn't deplete if you're chasing them.
---
Also you have a small bit less of recovery if you swing right at the end of the power meter.
---
His discordance perk though, that's really good especially for finding gen rushers.
---
And that was stated in your post... where?
---
There is a website for posting perk builds:  [https://salty-tears.com/](https://salty-tears.com/)   
---
But if you wanna get advice then the DBD forums is the best place:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories)
---
Oh so you pussy out now? Ok. I meant you play against me and I'll show you I'm not shit. I played one match with the knives to see if they're bugged. One fucking match. It's not a big deal. Play against me with your SWF you pussy. Don't go around calling people shit if you're going to pussy out :D
---
I‚Äôve been saying this for a month now, and although a lot of people agree, they won‚Äôt because it won‚Äôt make money. They absolutely should since 6 perks right now are bugged/broken. Each patch is worst then the last tbh.
---
I mean you can't just assume that because I mention nurse that I'm automatically on pc
---
This, this is the best remedy for toxic SWFs.

It got called a "chapter" because now their year's plan that says 1 chapter every 3 months just got halved in the potential content they have to put work into.
---
Basically, keep saying your plans are the same but redefine the terms you're using so you don't have to actually release full "chapters" each season.
---
They are doing the objective. What else you want them to do.
---
:(
---
Super coordinated Squads usually want to play and beat the killer together - yes they want to win and do gens but they also focus on saving teammates from death and spend time with the killer instead of being gen jokeys. I have seen organoized suqads with BT, DS, UB,DH, ADRA and other perk variations like this, and yes some of them bring a toolbox while others have instaheals, flashlights etc. I have never seen a genrush strat because nobody has fun like that.
---
And her stealth doesn‚Äôt turn off when your looked at for more then 1.5 seconds.
---
Wait. So, they're just redefining a term to make it seem like we're getting the same amount of stuff? That's kinda malicious and fucked up. Just call it a Parahraph!
---
This girl has made lots of different customization packs for everything in the game &amp; in many different colours - https://twitter.com/faery__
---
her tits are burned tho
---
All these little kids camp though...and since you only have one health state there‚Äôs not much you can do about it
---
Same here. But when you start to pull a James Charles and make our elderly Bill out to be some twisted forced LGTB thing, I draw the line
---
There's the new vaulting mechanics where you get hit after vaulting anyway, then there's the many killer abilities add ons and perks that fuck over survivors so much that solo queue survivors only go for hatch, bloodweb takes forever only for you to get a useless perk most of the time while playing against stacked killers with 100s of hours, survivors make way too much noise when injured so you can't get away from chases, you can't do anything but use pallets cause of auto aim lunge and you can be hit through those.
---
Just played a game where there was no notice. I only realized because she had max stacks and there was no sound. Thought it was strange that she was running thrill of the hunt.
---
i really wanted see  a cute baby wraith with his tiny cute bell UwU
---
Make sure he doesn't July you
---
\&gt;_&lt; 
---
 An UwU has been identified! That makes 241 UwUs in the last 2 days! 
---
 ^(Blep. Blop. I am a bot!)
---
If you watch this video, it's insane. He's at the exit gates, goes back to save someone, who then uses deliverance in his face to deny an unhook, which then gets Tru3 killed. As he's in the basement next to an exit gate, he has DS ready for an escape. A person comes out of the locker above him and waits there, letting themselves get marked after 30 seconds or so in which they could have saved him and all escaped. Instead of doing this, they then all run away and escape while he dies. In the post game, the survivor calls him Tru3tunnel, basically admitting that they weren't going to save him because they accuse him of tunnelling in his killer matches.
---
These 'rules' are absurd. I've said it before, there's no such thing as gen rushing - it's an objective. If you're being camped, your team should easily win by doing gens. If you're being 'tunnelled', there are anti tunnel perks and improving your loops can buy your team a ridiculous amount of time to do gens. There are all sorts you can do to stop things like this happening.
---
Why does j care what you do so much?
---
I recall a Dev saying a while back something along the lines of using the term Chapter for everything now because it'll be less confusing to people that don't follow the game, or something like that.
---
No I enjoy fun thank you
---
Nope
---
Ph yes I hate it when people June me I hate that month
---
\&gt; Don't follow the game
---
That's kinda ridiculous. Why even cater to an audience that doesn't care about your game?
---
I'd be somewhat interested.
---
TIL: Being triggered is equivalent for calling out hypocrites/arseholes. 
---
Gotchu.
---
1.Sometimes its strategically dumb to rescue.
---
2. They farmed you or they hid in a locker all match.
---
3. Timer on EGC is nearly done and I need to go.
---
4. Sandbagged or just acted toxic towards teammates.
---
5. Killer is nearby.
---
Run deja vu
---
Agreed. As a nurse main shadowborn carries me.
---
Not everyone's goal is to be as efficient as possible. Some people like to collect things.
---
Specific perks enable this ability, namely Unbreakable (teachable perk from Bill Overbeck (PC) / non-teachable perk (PS4/XB1)) and No Mither (teachable perk from David King).
---
So we won't cry about no chapters released?
---
It's true that BHVR has different sections. Yeah, they have Cosmetics guys, Concept guys, Story guys, Coding guys...but the coding guys **are the only group of coding guys**. They don't have a team of rework coding guys that does solely reworks, a team of new content coding guys that does solely new content, and a team of bug fixing coding guys that only fix bugs.
---
Whatever the coding guys are doing, that's what's being done. As you said, the coding guys are underwhelming. They can't split that team.
---
That kinda says we're just stupid I guess.
---
You sound like so much fun to play against lol.
---
Its just too rewarding for people who pick claudette or characters with dark clothes and use that to camo into literally any map that isnt ormond. Imo these things make hiding from the killer too easy and thus it becomes a hidden OP (pun intended).
---
I think he's pulling a Mr. Homeless here, or just being an arse.
---
Maybe you haven‚Äôt heard but since the Directors a Child Predator The Creeper won‚Äôt be added sorry man.
---
Well thats pretty much an issue with the licensed killers. They didnt got the rights for any other charakter from the scream series. And here comes the problem. Ghostface its licensed they cant combine a random survivor in a ghostface dlc. Thats why "carl the cashier" from the trailer didnt came out cause that would mean they sell new scream content or at least advertise their own content with ghostface. Just no possible way to do that.
---
No the hate I see is that it‚Äôs a bad and useless perk, not that it‚Äôs OP.
---
Wait, what is it?
---
Am a console player, I've never had this happen.
---
Because I'm shit at playing killer but still
---
&gt; "BEATINGU" - The Creeper becomes obsessed with a survivor. The obsession is displayed longer by the Creeper's power, and upon killing them the Creeper gains a movement speed boost
---
Perks should work for every killer. How would this work on Wraith? Or Clown?
---
So you can hear him if hes close,every killer has it, either breathing,Ghostface has that whoosh sound, LF has the chainsaw
---
Wait, even on Xbox?
---
I dont see why the director would have anything to do with the character being added to the game. But hey, a man can dream
---
Oh awesome! Had no idea. Is it worth using? (Seems pretty useful? Or is it a one time use?)
---
DBD is incomparable to a franchise like COD both in terms of popularity (income) and resources like solid quality testing and optimization from the ground up (due to the high income). I don't like COD but it's an AAA franchise with the backing of a company the size of Activision and DBD (which don't get me wrong, I do love) is a B- at best with THE worst optimization I've seen in many years.
---
Yeah it was kinda cool but we both died due to endgame collapse. My friend ran over to the other gate with no results and I jumped off the map which landed me back in killer shack. Pretty cool going out of the map tbh
---
I mean most of those people will argue Sprint Burst is the worst out of all exhaustion even if you combo it with Urban.
---
Idk. Just a quick concept I thought of. I can go back and rework it later
---
The pallet was dropped on me and it just kinda kept me in the middle. I wasnt able to escape the entire game.
---
There are three perks which pick a player up from the downed state Adrenaline which recovers a health state once the gates are powered, unbreakable which allows you to fully recover from dying once per match, and no mither which permanently injures you but grants unlimited recoveries from dying. These perks are for Meg Thomas (adrenaline, teachable level 40) Bill Overbeck (Unbreakable teachable 40, unless you play on console then it is already unlocked) and David King (No mither, teachable level 40)
---
Wait, Carl the cashier is a Scream character? This wouldn't make sense if he was because then they could've done Scream content. Instead they did original lore and I don't think Carl is a Scream character. And Kate Denson was supposed to be a part of the Leatherface DLC but got cut for some reasons which downgraded him into a chapter.
---
Because the director made the character himself. Like Freddy Krueger is Wes cravens Character.
---
It has a bad reputation because a lot of the people who run it overuse it, when a lot of times they should just run, even if that means eating their sprint burst.
---
Also, it's great when you manage to convince a killer you've left a gen when you haven't, but if you try to use it and fail, the killer will be right on top of you. It seems like the more consistent strat is to sense when the killer is going to commit to chasing you, and start running away early and build up distance.
---
hag has tits?
---
I don't understand as well. I use Sprint Burst, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill and Bond (since I still don't have Self-Care). I don't see a problem using Urban Evasion, it is very useful for me especially against short killers.
---
I think the main problem is for people who can't manage well Sprint Burst, and are walk-crouching all game just waiting for the "right" moment to use Sprint Burst.
---
Survivor perk called "Unbroken." It's a general perk, not tied to any character.
---
Once per match, a survivor may heal past the "find help" block when recovering on the ground and pick themselves up. They also recover up to 25% faster.
---
Whoever said urban invasion is op is just bad in this game.
---
I guess so, in my opinion having an on command speed boost is pretty good, I like it a lot more than dead hard where once the killer knows you have it it can get countered and balanced landing where sometimes you‚Äôre just not in the right spot to activate.
---
doesn't mean they can't jiggle
---
also pretty sure they're just infected
---
Also vice versa with survivors
---
The reason I run it is because I usually get keys out of chests and when I don't since I'm running ace in the hole I get good add-ons on good items.
---
not more than spirit tho
---
Because it's often ran by useless immersed teamates that are afraid of their own shadow and spend 80% of the match crawling around and hiding.  These types of survivors ruin the match and since this perk is a staple of their kit and playstyle it too usually gets ripped on.
---
Lol that'd be pretty crazy if you spammed it you could make a wall of light for a short distance that blocked their vision
---
They should just add it to all the girls tbh
---
So would you say finding a proper balance between using Sprint Burst and saving it would redeem this perk?
---
It's not about how much time you spend crouching, it's about where you do this. A lot of UE users just crouch along the map walls doing nothing useful.

Actually same.
---
After this patch I keep getting ranks 17/16 teammates while I'm rank 8 :/
---
I did not know this!! Is it worth using? 
---
(I main Feng, and the only other person I‚Äôve got perks from is Claudette for self heal)
---
Not really, IMO but most of the time the killer will just pick you up and hook you so these perks almost never come into play. He also forgot adrenaline for meg which heals one health state even if you are downed
---
Could you not be healed?
---
How fucking cringe are you
---
The perfect selfie doesn't exi...
---
Yeah, I guess so actually. I've seen one of Monto's plunderers' builds which was entertaining. I don't think I'd ever use it tho. Just from past frustration
---
Looks fine tbh
---
Wouldn‚Äôt sole survivor be a better head perk? Isn‚Äôt it Laurie with 2 skulls
---
If they were using chest-looting build or luck offerings then not so insane
---
When I first started I didn‚Äôt realize there‚Äôs an auditory warning when you are going to get a skillcheck. Do you know about this?
---
Yeah its odd. I think they needa sprinkle some new maps in every once in awhile
---
I could be healed my friend was just in shock lol. However my dead hard was no longer functioning
---
Make his traps apply the Broken status for X amount of time, or at least give him an add on for that.
---
I could be healed my friend was just in shock lol. However my dead hard was no longer functioning. I‚Äôve had similar stuff happen where borrowed time just won‚Äôt work etc
---
I hear it sometimes, other times either my awful hearing or the other noise going on (Hooks, or just the generator chugging) overshadows it. I‚Äôve gotten better at hearing it, just not the button press, the mark moves faster than I expect (Happy cake day btw)
---
He deserved soooo many more tbags than you gave him.
---
Too bad you did not get this submitted in time! I love it!
---
It honestly depends on what kind of person is behind the killer you face, which, of course, you can't tell until you're in the match.
---
It's pretty 50/50 if the killer you face will just always pick you up immediately after you go down, or leave you and hunt other survivors. The perk is very good if the killer leaves you/is distracted by another survivor and then loses you in the grass, however killers can equip a perk that allows them to see downed survivors.
---
I recommend the perk much more if you are playing with friends, and are able to coordinate them distracting the killer while you pick yourself up. It is a perk that can easily come in clutch, but like I said, some games you may not even get the chance to use it. Though since you have teachable self-heal, it may be even better, allowing you to go from downed to fully healed without any help from others.
---

Holy shit, props to the dwvs for that sound design. That is one of the few times I've felt scared in this game
---
I thought all perks were available from leveling? Are there some you can only get from the shrine?
---
From what I'm reading, the studio does own the copyright. But either way, the Creeper itself is still a great character and it would honestly be worth it for them to throw it in. Sure, they may have to deal with that scum-sucking asshat to get the rights to add the character, but it would probably be a massive moneymaker for the studio. Is it definite? No. Possible? Yes, especially with the Creeper being one of the most requested characters. And besides, the Creeper needs something good after that shitty third movie and a shittier director. Here's to hoping he gets put in new, better hands
---
No source. Just anecdotally what I remember from the event.

Hell Mortal Kombat X gave him the Pretty Lady outfit for one of his variations. DBD could totally do that as well.

Grind David until his shirt cums off, then grind him a little more for good measure.
---
Your points were valid until urban. It is fantastic when you need to get a little dodge around a tree or that slight extra low profile after a popped genny. As long as you're not just crouch walking around the map it is a great perk
---
Sorry hope you get a better Killer next game.
---
Why Ash grunting in pain in fast forward sounds like Alvin and the Chimpunks porn

So why does it have to be there when you're playing as LF? It's harder to hear survivors noises, and it's a pain in the ass in the lobby.

I cant find anything about the devs saying that online. And I read somewhere that Jonathan Breck wasn't sure about a 4th movie, but apparently there was a full season already written for a JC TV show, so hey theres a little hope

Why not temporarily lock the perk before they fix it?

Heck, why not just fix it posthaste? It's probably a comma or a semicolon leftover somewhere. Banning people for the development team mistakes would be beyond ridiculous.

Fanf isn't a bad series at all at I think it just has a bad reputation because children are into it and people just join the bandwagon to hate on it. I think it could work in dbd since there are a lot of ideas from fanf that could be brought in to dbd and be unique, like the camera's or spring locks. I don't think a animatronic as a killer would work though, they said they want the killers to be humanoid so I think William Afton could fit well for the killer.
---
Yeah and IQ is too. DDOSing is bad again
---
*cow tree pallet* finally someone acknowledged this place of supreme power
---
how do you know
---
Survivors do this at the exit gate all the time I don‚Äôt see the problem?
---
If it‚Äôs not too strong then it‚Äôs severely weak. That‚Äôs how I see it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think rebuilding pallets should be a thing at all.
---
If everyone uses it it will take 3 minutes so I don't think it will be a high tier perk but it would be usefull.
---
I am starting to get envious of these group selfies.
---
When I kill peeps, nobody joins in :(
---
Oh that it? Sweet, just wanted to check
---
Closing the hatch in a dying survivors face or picking them up and making them crawl to the exit gate only to drag them to a hook or let the timer run out is like the killer version of t bagging at the exit. Just as toxic.
---
He did it for the entire endgame timer. I didn't play toxic I just played well. I didn't teabag him after any stuns.
---
indeed a shit post
---
Idk why you're defending the devs so hard. The entire community despises the devs and likes them ar the same time.
---
If all your gonna do is jack off the devs you're gonna have a rough time in this community.
---
They can be both good and fuck up *a lot* and get criticized for it
---
i was watching a stream (dont remember when) and a killer bmd the survivors because "wHen Im PlayINg NicE SUrvivOrs WILl rUin my DaY" when no one bmd him in any way
---
Noice! Good to hear if they send u a survey fill it out, it helps with future stuff
---
Is that ded ard?
---
I would buy it, but i don't want it personally.
---
The entity is an acient mistical beeing that pulls people from diferent dimentions to torture then and eat their hope and strong emotions like anger and sadness, it is known that a man named vigo managed to understand the entity's biological and magical proprietys and evem manipulate it, however he is missing, and probably has been captured, benedict also a survivor was pulled into the realm and made notes on everything, survivors, killers, generators, hatch etc, but since the hallowed blight even looks like he had the same fate as vigo
---
They are all available from leveling, I assume that they either mean that buy perks if a. you don't have the chapter/dlc unlocked or b. you get 150k/200k bps from reunlocking something
---
Ah gotcha. Makes sense! I ended up buying most of the DLCs between a sale last year and this year's summer sale so I don't feel so bad about spending shards on perks. I was worried for a sec there that there may be shrine only perks or something!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm thinking about doing it...
---
Use it if getting slugged is a common enough occurrence for you to get extremely annoyed. I use it and it makes for some epic and funny moments.
---
Because the stereotype is that jews are greedy.
---
I only explained the stereotype, I do not agree with it tho.
---
I love feng, she was my main survivor for quite a while
---
Ya nurse it's a nightmare on console tbh just cause of how much worse sticks are than mouse.
---
Get it now - I don't think you'll find it cheaper than $4 and sales are not common.
---
Is 86 the maximum amount of items you can have in a stack? thats such a weird number!
---
Oh, okay. Thanks!
---
Is it, like, common? Is it even possible? Or do people just get salty?
---
I just read up on what Prayer Beads Bracelet does. A bit embarassing, but I had no idea the phasing makes a sound to begin with... I always wondered how I didn't grab survivors off a gen for they'd let go at the last second.
---
When it happened to me i ran out and right back in and it worked after the 10th time crossing the line... my friend died to EGC lol.. we had a good laugh post game. The porting back to the middle of map/random spot also happens if you fall through the floor and desync in a locker.
---
Ok?So just buy everything and just level them, why even use shrine
---
You'd have to specify what part of killer has been speedrun
---
[This page](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Entity) is only like 9 paragraphs and pretty much tells you everything you want to know about it .
---
When they use enough pallets chase other survivors
---
PC master race
---
*Looks like Bing Bong isnt only my bell*
---
I hate it when it does that in chase and suddenly they're gone from sight :l
---
It's definitely possible, but not really common at all. More than likely if you're lagging, the killer just had a bad connection
---
Just like play with randos I guess? What kind of specification?
---
What tf did you expected? My 9yo sister plays Roblox, and almost every popular game is a ripoff of something else, there are even a lot of ripoffs of VR Chat like Wolves Life or sth like that
---
Cringe
---
When i get that addon i just spam spacebar till the map ends üòÖ
---
I love the pig, don't know if many like it but I sure do.
---
Spirit (for killer and perks), clown (for perks mostly, but some like him), Pig (Fun and Surveillance), Cannibal (For BBQ, but all his perks are decent), Hag (For the killer and Ruin) And Micheal (for the killer and STBFL).
---
These days when somebody calls me out for tunneling, usually I wholeheartedly agree with them and tell them of course I would do it in the given circumstance.
---
OMFG! All of them are so cute! Huntress probably had a juggling mishap. Or she threw it so hard it instantly went around the world and hit herself in the head
---
For sure, Dead hard doesn't always work (you'll always dash forward, but it's a 50/50 that you'll actually have immunity).
---
I think balanced landing doesn't give the proper speed boost/doesn't activate, but I don't use this perk so I'm unsure about this one
---
AFAIK mom, prove thyself, and wglf plus the 2 you named so I'm curious about the last one too
---
That‚Äôs Jason Voorhees from the movie series Friday The 13th but I absolutely loved this as a background.
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for GF to Mori me :(
---
My only problem with UE as a killer is that ppl tend to play too immersive and most games gets incredible boring and slow.
---
All defaults except for an Ace perk. Surely a coincidence.
---
Nurse is love, Nurse if life. Nurse is not having to slowly run around pallets for minutes like a headless AI chicken.
---
Really? Because the game was stuck in a creative dump until they ditched them. Keep your bias at the door.
---
Cause obviously Nurse spirit billy S tier is better than everybodyyyyy else, no debate really.  Wasn‚Äôt the question.  But I‚Äôd put clown in the next A tier after that, really short chases when you place your tonics well.  just doesn‚Äôt have that next level mobility like our s tiers.
---
If the game had better servers it would kick you for jumping to an exceedingly high ping which would make lagswitching less of an option for people. I can't imagine the kind of person who would lag switch in the first place
---
I like it on Mike. Maybe I‚Äôll try it on Ghosty
---
Quote unquote autoaim kicks in
---
twas a joke but thanks for the info
---
My quickest game was with nurse for sure. First hook after 30 sec. (Killt himself) downed the next one 20 sec after that. That one dc. The last 2 dc around 15 - 30 sec after that. #classicnursegame lol
---
June the killer and March right through the gates
---
Same here!
---
Honestly if they do this, they should announce it as loud as possible, or even tie it in with another DLC once they're finished, so they can limit the whining like "WhY iT bE sO lOnG SiNCe LaST DlC?!?" Being shouted at them from toxic entitled players.
---
there is a chance to escape through the hatch, or you can wair the killer in an exit gate to open it when he comes to you, and in every piece of media the game is hinted to be like the movies, that the killer has the advantage
---
I've had better luck with Pharmacy than Plunder's.
---
I use Botany and the green kit gets me 2 heals. If I happen to stumble across another chest I open it quick. I've gotten several keys and I love getting kits of any kind. If I get a yellow kit I can heal twice with it using.
---
Pharmacy doesn't light up chests for me to see, but I know what I am getting the first time and I'm getting it quick. Any other chests are bonuses.
---
David is the only one who knows what's acutally going on here !!
---
It's highly unlikely that this is going to happen as the costs to have a buggy game doesn't out weigh the potential revenue they could make
---
This is not a shitpost,not refines,not pure,this is just shit
---
ah okb
---
Restore your licenses

Game mechanics are just one way to grief. Also a quote:
---
# " Intentional  harassment  of  other  players  is  called  ‚Äúgriefing,‚Äù  which  utilizes  aspects  of  the game structure or physics in unintended ways to cause distress for other players."
---
**- IRIE International Review of Information Ethics Vol. 4 (12/2005) Dorothy E. Warner and Mike Raiter**  
---
Exit gates mechanic is that you power them and get out. If some of your teammate is in trouble you can wait for them and decide if you help or not. The idea was not to power the door, wait in the exit and lure the killer there to clicky clicky and run out just for fun.  
---
Two teammates had already left and the killer wasn't after the third one (4th is the one at exit gates)  so there was no need to lure the killer. Instead he used exit gate's "decide if help team mechanic" to just wait for killer to click on his face like he did for the whole game.  
---
In my opinion (survivor main since the launch) that is not how exit gates was intended and was griefing.  
---
Also flashlights' click sound is for "cosmetics" (I don't know the word but to make the game authentic) and also helps killer to locate a survivor (for example during lifting a downed survivor). The mechanic's idea was not to beat it like it owes you money just to annoy someone and to **show your dominant position.**   
---
In a slight way, I'd say that mechanics were abused in a way they was not originally intended, therefore griefing.

---
They didn‚Äôt get movie ghostface because they didn‚Äôt get licensing from the movie (similar to why they couldn‚Äôt get original freddy). They got the licensing to the mask, and therefore couldn‚Äôt use the copyrighted characters from the film. That‚Äôs a whole different discussion, though. You‚Äôre entitled to totally believe it was billy behind the mask in whatever scenes you want, but the knife and a few grunts aren‚Äôt really decisive evidence? Plus, even in the movie it‚Äôs never explicitly confirmed. Wes Craven doesn‚Äôt write subtle hints like John Carpenter does, not really his style. I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs the general consensus that Stu was often behind the mask, rather than Billy. There was never confirmation from the writers or Wes Craven, so it‚Äôs all speculation on our part. Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to try to act all ‚ÄúI‚Äôm smarter than you because I picked up on clues that aren‚Äôt actually there.‚Äù Lol
---
every single damn time when i see urban evasions in my games they‚Äôre just crouching in the middle of nowhere
---
they don‚Äôt go to gens
---
they don‚Äôt look around them
---
they make teammates wait for unhooks
---
they don‚Äôt know how to hide because they think stealth = crouch (i can see your arms!)
---
they‚Äôre generally known to be stereotypically the worst survivor players in the game
---
But like, crutches = strong perks right? If this player is newer and asking for strong perks, and maybe doesn‚Äôt have pace management skills yet, Ruin would help a lot :) 
---
Gen slowing is still necessary at red ranks or they pop in six minutes, but I wonder if that 80 second plague perk is better.
---
Lithe is also bugged it didn‚Äôt do anything 3 times yesterday I was quite upset
---
It happens every game for me dude
---
Reset ur game and restore licenses
---
I was waiting for him to let you crawl all the way to the end then pick you up and start giving you a few stabby stabs
---
That‚Äôs not true characters aren‚Äôt often disabled and if they are it‚Äôs normally fixed somewhat soon (except for xing due to needing a lot of work)
---
I played against a Billy not too long ago, I would lag terribly but only if he was chasing me. After downing me, he would stand there for a bit, like he was doing something else and I though maybe he's fiddling with that lag switch. I wonder... maybe it was just a coincidence.
---
I'm unsure if meant to say felt instead of dealt, but as it currently is, I couldn't agree more.
---
Those items help in the long run
---
Some games, I do nothing but loot all the chests and give high quality items to other survivors (only when I run my chest looting build)
---
Meg main = big brain
---
I personally hate tomphson's moonshine
---
Happens all the time on xbox. It freezes for a split second in the worst possible moments.
---
Ghostfaces are either fun Killers to play against, or hilarious memelords to play with. Win/win. Thank you for adding to the material of evidence, good sir.
---
(There's also those who camp in Nightshroud, but these aren't generalised under 'Ghostfaces', these are generalised under '12 year olds with an inferiority/domination complex', same as with all other campers.)
---
I had more plans for it but never really went through with it.
---
&lt;3
---
The Clown practically walked in.
---
It's funny to think of how tightly coupled their code must be in order to break so many perks at random.
---
That‚Äôs just funny
---
Dwight is the true killer
---
Feeling scammed? It‚Äôs always been cheaper and better to buy a full Chapter than to buy characters individually.. ü§î
---
Usually if you just swing your camera around, the lunge hitbox will just randomly decide to connect so you can still sometimes hit through these lol.
---
Either that or ghostface has a weird lunge hitbox (noticed on him)
---
Just end the game already eh? That same situation with the hatch a month ago would have resulted in a standoff that at the end of then day would have ended up with the killer screwing up or letting them go. The killer can do nothing, just wait or be forced to let their final kill go.
---
I'm not saying I'd do this, but I can understand why a frustrated kill would.
---
Why are your perks like that?
---
I always see these post and agree with them, then I remember nothing about coding or how hard it is to do it so I‚Äôm not going to get up the developers for the bugs and glitches.
---
Pretty much the same except as default except swapped L1 and x. Also square is my Dead hard and diversion button.
---
Can someone tell me how to use it on console? And how to use insta heals also üòÖ
---
It doesn't matter really. People in this sub don't care much for balance, they just want their favourite characters or perks to be pushed as far as possible in their favour, and will use exaggeration and memes to do this. Then they wonder why the devs find balancing and appeasing the community difficult.
---
I like playing against Ghostface it‚Äôs like playing against all the stealthy Killers well duh. But he‚Äôs more of a worry since he can get exposed fast. But that‚Äôs where I see him fail. His kit just doesn‚Äôt work for this game and is only good the first minute. 
---
Besides that stealth kit they gave him I think the whole while in stealth you have no tr and walk at normals speed is amazing.
---
Are you on console? I'm on PC and used it multiple times yesterday with no issues.
---
Play with your food doesn't lose stacks when you down the obsession, and people are pairing it with furtive chase so you can basically have a permanent 15% speed boost on certain killers.
---
That happens on PC too trust me. I can run WOW raids on ultra at 60 fps, but this shitty game can't run 60fps on the lowest settings ...
---
The ranks are broken sadly
---
No worrys :)
---
I think everyone asked the same question when legions add ons were bugged. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Oh we broke our game? Well let‚Äôs ban people for it!
---
I play rainbow six siege and they removed a whole character coz there was a game breaking bug if you used them. They removed broken utilities too. BHVR has no excuse other than laziness.
---
PC maybe it was just bad connection my internet wasn‚Äôt being nice at the time
---
LB on Xbox I believe, so on PS4 it will be the front-most bumper on the left side of the controller.
---
Don't know how I could be any clearer or how you can't understand this
---
Gamer momentüòé
---
Just tried out Lithe, and oh my it‚Äôs so useful! 
---
I don‚Äôt have any others currently, Kate is level 23 other than that the others are pretty low, don‚Äôt know who is worth levelling up for their perks currently! 
---
And I do abit of everything, prefer hiding from the killer but would like to be able to escape is being chased! I tend to help people if they are on hooks I won‚Äôt ignore them if I‚Äôm doing a gen :) (unless the gen is super close then I‚Äôll finish and go get them!)
---
Can anybody explain how the characters mechanics are meant to work and be balance-able?
---
I don't think ghostface is overpowered or anything. But I fail to understand the point of his power and reveal.. 
---
If he successfully stalks you, he gets a benefit. If he unsuccessfully stalks you, he gets a benefit. It kind of makes the stalking more pointless - he does just fine running around normally, chasing and waiting for people to reveal him so he can track them better.
---
nice idea would like to have it too
---
Killers stuck in the finishing hook animation while you're heading toward hatch, has to beat you to the hatch (while having to guess where it is), has to close it before you jump in (no hatch interrupts anymore), and beat you on the exit gate rush (likely if you overcommit to the hatch, but you dont have to if they're really right on top of it and then its just an immersed rush exit gates game which you usually have a solid 50/50 on), and if you have a key you really have a 100% winrate because you can just reopen the hatch.  You're right that its only like 80% without a key because you can get unlucky, but  80% is absurd compared to most winrates especially in solo que, and more importantly even if its only comparable winrate to trying normally (which it isnt, youre much more likely to win this way) its just bad design because as i said it encourages you to let your team die and just avoid the "primary" objective. reiterating that its not a flaw on this suggestion but the entire idea of a left behind perk. 
---
tl:dr its not truly autowin without a key, but its immensely higher winrate than playing normally
---
Legion top 3 ? What he has over Billy, Spirit and Nurse, the actual top 3 killers ?

I‚Äôm trying to keep it to first gen Pok√©mon for now since they are my original loves! Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking so far. Give me your input on what you think would be best!

Huntress-Cubone
---
Nurse- Venomoth or Gastly
---
Clown- Mr Mime or Koffing
---
Freddy-Hypno
---
Trapper-Ryhorn or Slowbro
---
Bubba-Electabuzz
---
Billy- Scyther or Kabutops
---
Hag- Bellsprout
---
Pig- Sandshrew
---
Spirit- Zubat or Ekans
---
Michael- Gengar 
---
Plague- Gloom
---
Legion- Mankey 
---
Ghostface- Beedrill 
---
Wraith- Geodude or Magmar
---
Doctor- Psyduck
---
You‚Äôre right, i don‚Äôt think people would do this every game, just when they are angry and have the chance
---
Nurse is OP
---
I dont think bhvr is allowed to make legacy skins for licensed killers
---
I like this very much.
---
&gt;When you drop and pick up, drop and pick up, you don't need to fill the wiggle meter; it will drop you earlier.
---
Yes, that was my point.
---
&gt;If the killer had just dropped him, he would of dropped him in the Injured state.
---
No, when the anti-dribble mechanic kicks in and auto-wiggles you out (like it did in the video) it happens when you drop the survivor, not when you pick them up. He picked OP up and immediately dropped him.
---
Ya know, sometimes I wish I had unbreakable and a key for people who do stuff like this
---
Nea having a out of body experience
---
Wait what is wrong with prove thyself now?
---
Camper cries about people calling him a camper &gt; gets upvoted by other campers on reddit. Another spectacular day in the life of a camping rank 12.

He s bad now, his rework kinda just nerfed his power :/ there's no reason for Legion to cause DCs but low rank survivors DC for all kinds of reasons

Huntress

---
Man I feel you, I recently got a pc and it does feel like a luxury compared to console but it‚Äôs the money that bites you in the ass.
---
Thats simple legion is freaking anoying thats why. I also hate going against him. Healing yourself from deep wound effect over and over again is just disgusting. The only killer thats even worst is the doctor. Well at least im not that type of player that dc straight away
---
This was probably staged in kill your friends. But also maybe not.
---
There's no such thing
---
The only jiggle physics in this game that matter is dat clown belly
---
I would grind because you get DH and WGLF. Also David is free and you can get him or his teachables anytime. I would save for a character you have to buy
---
It's a bit late but you could probably use a KVM with PCI-E passthrough.
---
Unfortunately, I don't know how to set them up. ;-;
---
Well, good, that means you get to stock up for the next Shrine. Or for cosmetics. Either way, it's a win.
---
It gets a bad rap because of some people who use it. I'm talking about these p3 claudettes who sit in the corner of the map in grass or corn, urban evading
---
I was waiting. Scrolled too far for this.
---
I would love to see more!

I enjoy playing as him, you just make healing unbearable so everyone just stays injured and loud,

It‚Äôs like when the pig broke deciding not to throw hatchets because they coded uncrouching and putting hatchets away with the same variables.
---
It still works. All the smoke plumes would be the aftermath of a super spicy postgame chat

Try and stick with the common and uncommon addons to start off with, tons of upsides with very little downsides when compared to the less common ones
---
Unfortunately this was all there was.

I was trying to record some Nurse gameplay, and mix that in with Spirit gameplay but I made the mistake of 1: I don't main nurse and 2: It was Rank 1 I decided to try this lol.  
---
I quit out of frustration.
---
When you get a 4man swf that trash talk you after
---
So you load in every hard hitting perks and a mori and brutalize the next team only to realize theyre all randoms that aren't the best
---
Thank you for such a detailed list!  I hope to be a decent enough player where I can do even two of these.
---
You don't think that t-bagging, which is basically blatantly taunting the killer isn't grieving?
---
Wtf man no just fucking don‚Äôt not even in a shitpost
---
Bitch I get my own money and  credit cards are for chumps like you and I bet your dad was mad as hell when the condom broke and had your disappointing ass
---
Say scream NOT smile
---
I can see it if you're getting camped by someone like Leatherface who'll just rev his chainsaw in front of you and instadown whoever goes for the save (unless they're using a perk to prevent it) but camping killers are pretty easy to bully. Several times before I've unhooked a survivor in front of the killer, took a hit then gave them the run around because most who feel they have to camp are genuinely bad several of times. Hell most of the time everyone will just do gens, save the hooked survivor before they die, then run for one of the two gates we've already opened because the killer wasted time camping one survivor
---
I really like it! Good editing, more effects would be cool :)
---
I don‚Äôt get 3 genned often, but when I do...
---
Yeah, I should have wrote "Playstation" in there but I see getting to level 50 and earning prestiges  are ultimate goals in the game.
---
Yea People who claim they get genrushed usually aren't really able to controll gens. They'd rather claim their enemies were a SWF than accepting the trurth. I've seen more Sabo Teams than 'genrush' teams lmao. But I am from EU maybe efficent play only happens in NA xddd
---
The fact that you have FPV while playing as Killer makes it more terryfying than playing as Survivor in TPV
---
Unless you bring add ons to increase its lifespan, a brown medkit is also single use at best. 
---
Self care also cuts you off from reliance on ur team in the event you get hit. Which for solo q players is rly good bc you want to be as self reliant as possible, considering you might not be playing with very smart people
---
Does whisper count hooked survivors?
---
Actually with Urban, your crouch speed is faster than your normal walk
---
Wow a juking montage
---
This never was made before
---
Wow
---
Thanks for that!  PSPrices states this is as cheap as Myers ever gets so I'll play the game some more tonight and see how I like it.

---
It‚Äôs fuckin June no ones in school dip shit have fun in your parents basement
---
NO
---
I MEAN HUSBAND
---
Get some buddies and stock up on DS's BT's and instaheals my dude. Those campers will give you braincancer, the least you can do is repay the favor.
---
This would fix the 360 loop exploit so much
---
How cool would it be if the game actually took photographs from the camera's pov and saved them as screenshots.
---
This is what I‚Äôm sayin !
---
Oh cool a counter argument, really appreciate it. Most people go just for an insult, but you seem like a good person to talk to.
---
Worst case the game would have taken 20 seconds longer, which isn't long when I remember the Mexican standoffs at the old hatchet..
---
Try to master looking behind you and look at tutorials
---
Have fun getting rejected by every girl in your state.
---
How was prom x
---
We have a group of three but my god I can only take so much brain cancer
---
Swear to god if I see more fnaf suggestions posts
---
You got your shitty game, now dtop ttying to connect it with horror games
---
If he wanted to win the game, he would have brought me straight to the hook, which was close to the hatch. He decided to be a cock, bring me to the hatch and close it in my face. He then proceeded to continue trying to be a cock.
---
Remove your head from your backside üëå
---
Thanks, David king specific tutorials?
---
Yep i still buy individually cause i rather give them more$ idk why
---
Lmao cosplaying legion with thunder thighs over here ^^ prom was three years ago and unlike you I actually gotta go.
---
I‚Äôd hide my face if I looked like you too
---
This is how updates for every game work.
---
Spirit, Pig, Hag. All for fun playability as well as their perks.
---
You CAN tunnel, however it's not the mosr effectice, at least to start out, because if you can get everyone injured right at the start you'll be in good territory
---
Against the rules to ‚Äòwitchhunt‚Äô
---
You finally get hooked, and you see two of them watching the third guy search basement chest. Then they all carefully take time to trade items around until you hit second hook stage.
---
You do you boo
---
That literally would make the perk even more useless....lol no this is a bad idea.
---
When you get hit by Sloppy Butcher on console, frames drop dead
---
Does it prevent the killer from doing anything else?  Nope.
---
Does it prevent the killer from moving on to another target? Nope.
---
Does it prevent the killer from getting any points? Nope.
---
But this. This not only prevent the survivor from doing anything, it also prevent them from moving on to their next game.
---
And that is considered holding the game hostage, which is bannable.
---
Thicc thighs save lives. 
---
Yeah have fun at primary school kiddo
---
I'm not telling people to do anything to him. I'm requesting clips of what he's done and hoping to raise awareness of a bigger issue in the current state of the game.
---
Bruh. I see you've never run the Tenacious, Unbreakable, Flip-Flop, Boil Over Build.
---
I like its current state.
---
As a new player who just wants to play the game farming is driving me mad. No I don‚Äôt want you to pick me up and drop me 500 times, please just kill me so I can join my dead friend and we can move on to another match, because we actually just play to have and enjoy the point of the game. Is there anyway to avoid players that want to do this?
---
Gotta love the survivor mains. Exploiting bbq‚Äôs visual bug is much worse than exploiting a game breaking bug that allows survivors to get out much easier.
---
He's fun but like ... his feral frenzy is so limited.
---
If a frenzied Legion stabs me, I know that I'm free to LITERALLY start mending right in front of him. Because he's forced to either A. Take the equivelant of a longer pallet stun to actually threaten me, or more likely, B. Just go find someone else to bother.
---
His power literally makes him less threatening as soon as he uses it.
---
Witch hunt is going after people for things they didn't do tho isnt it? Hes posting proof of the stuff
---
I reccomend to be altruistic as David and take hits for We're Gonna Live Forever. You can play aggresive if you bring Dead Hard, which allows you to take an extra hit.
---
No, I mean your time zone. What is your time zone. I need to know what time difference there is so I can calculate what time in my country is around midnight in your time
---
Smh I‚Äôm ashamed to be in the xbox community.
---
The only lore you need to know: 
---
Dwight hides in lockers. 
---
Meg is dumb. 
---
Ace is a meme. 
---
Quentin is hideous. 
---
Claudette is blending. 
---
Nea is crouching across the map. 
---
David is sexy man.
---
Kate is hot Meg. 
---
Nurse is a try hard.  
---
Billy run fast. 
---
Huntress is sexy tall lady. 
---
Spirit is sexy dead lady. 
---
Myers is sexy stabby man/God 
---
Leatherface is camping the basement with Insidious. 
---
Hag puts 10 traps around every hooked survivor. 
---
That sums up most of the lore you need to know.
---
I feel like they let you go anyway
---
That's the point
---
LOL, well i missed the first few seconds, for me it started where the chase started, well rewatched it, yeah he is a d\*ckhead..
---
Check the multiple responses to this train of thinking in the comment thread
---
Whoa there. No one said thicc trust me on that it‚Äôs more like a plastic bag of cottage cheese.  
---
And have fun in day care kIdDo
---
Not all survivors are good enough to do that though so even the dumbest of killers can catch them
---
No
---
You don‚Äôt even play

I play with george
---
George is a bitch
---
Go break another controller
---
Then I'm not going to dignify your comment with a proper response
---
You just described the dilemma of Ghostface perfectly. His kit would be great if the game was slower paced. I have to run like 3 gen stopper perks plus BBQ to make him work decently well at red ranks due to this.
---
Wait whose the problem here? Michael Myers or The Meg.
---
U/Cute_trash_  makes me feel the same way
---
I'd farm... if survivors played cakes or streamers. Either irs my one cake and 2+ escape cakes or my one cake and three petrified oaks.
---
You sound like a child.   Grow up.   You're salty about losing.
---
Not over this. I deleted this
---
Wow I don‚Äôt have to watch this know you‚Äôre a pain in the ass
---
If only there were in game cosmetics that you could buy with real money.
---
Guess what? Only you have pointed that out, meaning that factually you're a bellend
---
Not condoning that killers actions at all. But I recognize your gamer tag, I've played against you quite a bit. Funny your calling someone else toxic.
---
I tend not to use ebony mori offerings, and I have damn near 100+ on my nurse, but I'm sick of the four stack wake up + BNP groups smashing gens out in 30 seconds. I'll stop bringing mori's when they stop cheesing the game.
---
I recently had to reinstall the game and ever since then I have been getting the game to freeze sometimes when I do a lunge attack. It has fucked over so many hit that I should have gotten and even lost me games
---
Same here bud
---
There's no going back 'til you get bored of stomping, if you get to that level &amp; get bored of it. Playing other killers just doesn't cut it after mastering Nurse.
---
You're the reason Xbox isn't taken seriously shut the fuck incel
---
Hey mate , someone that has seen her naked many times, can confirm they are thicc thighs.
---
I‚Äôd like to see you make me ugly bitch
---
 Just to clarify I hate the Xbox community because of scum like u/YFGCAM
---
You're joking right?
---
No one cares what you think tho
---
People get offended because t-bagging is an insult. It makes the game really aggravating to play, and therefore unfun. When killers, especially new ones get emotional they tend to start playing like assholes. When I was first starting out as killer I was going up against what had to have been a swf and they were running around me, there was one person who kept on hitting me with a flashlight the second I would pick someone up, so you're damm right I camped him because he was making me so angry and making the game for me so unfun that I no longer cared about winning the game I just cared about killing him. That's what happens when you're new to killer and don't know how to play yet and you're only met with constant bullying. This isn't an excuse for tunneling and face-camping but don't act like t-bagging is just some silly thing that can't piss people off.
---
Why are you like this?  Are you just dumb or trolling?  Or are you really the type of person that thinks you sound funny and cool?
---
Name a time and place and I'll lnock your lights out mate
---
Duuuuudeee are you here shining knight that‚Äôs too lit

He's making a gatekeeping joke

Stockton California come thru bitch boiii

It's not a new thing he's been around for months.
---
Who said I was gonna spam, I posted 2 of my videos because I am proud of them and I feel like more people should see them
---
Nah just her bf who thinks harassing someone for calling you out for being a child and a salty dbd player is out of order
---
You husband now
---
I don‚Äôt kno why aren‚Äôt you minding your business
---
Welcome to coding.
---
Lol I'm a very defensive person. But I don't go out of my way to ruin the game for people.
---
K let me book a flight
---
Same to you dude
---
And you ain‚Äôt finna do anything about it
---
Thry shouldnt tho
---
Becaudr thr videos are shit and its spam when you post in less then 10 minutes
---
Me and the boys celebrating 3rd anniversary
---
How exactly does this relate to the post tho ?
---
That‚Äôs cool I never said anyone did ?
---
Wanna bet?
---
I'll be in south cali next month 
---
Square up punk ass bitch
---
Coders can only work on one thing at a time, and they have to work on implementing everything that the other departments come up with. So yeah it does have something to do with it. But still it isn't as simple as 'just fix it'. People in this thread clearly have no idea what coding is like.
---
You not booking a flight you can‚Äôt afford that
---
Wanna test that theory?
---
That‚Äôs fine
---
9 is a big minimum I usually do better unless I am hard tunneled
---
Like what‚Äôs wrong buddy? Do you need to talk because it clearly seems like you need a ego boost. Randomly talking shit when you don‚Äôt know me at all and this is my first post. If this is suck a big deal to you why don‚Äôt you keep scrolling, no one said you had to watch it.
---
Yeah dude I‚Äôll be waiting for your fat ass to come run outta breath after one swing
---
Go to settings and change your privacy or have them run through the request system
---
I'm rank 7 not sure yet how itll do at red
---
Because immersed Claudette players use it to crouch around the outskirts of the map doing nothing.
---
You not bout it so it don‚Äôt even matter
---
i have myers, but he gets looped hard and gen rushed even harder, so i was looking for killers with status effects and speed, like pig's reverse bear traps but she only has 4 and she is really slow, so i went for legion.
---
These are so fun! Because of Wraith's ghost-like ability, I feel like actually he should be Gengar or Haunter. I have no idea what you would do for Michael because nothing really fits him from generation 1 since dark-type wasn't introduced yet. 
---
Are you trying to stay with gen 1 for these?
---
No one said you had to post it

---
No worries, ever since i did it ive enjoyed killer so much more and just dbd in general
---
Good call, I do this, if I plan to play killer for a few hours I block all messages.
---
Sure mate, I run two miles every morning, but one punch will out me out of breathe, can't wait mate, I was over here visiting my aunt in OK but I'll spend a but of extra chasing and spend an extra day here just to see you cry
---
I agree the Emblem penalty for face-camping is stupid, it may as well not exist. Killers at high ranks don‚Äôt face-camp because they like to rank up. Killers at lower ranks don‚Äôt care about ranking so it makes no difference. 
---
I tested it a while back how much it penalises you. Was rank 10, played as Myers. Face-camped the first person I got. Same with the second. Third DC‚Äôd as I was chasing them and I managed to close the hatch and sacrifice the 4th. I still safety pipped as Ruin stopped them doing gens and the penalty for camping was only -29% proximity to hooked survivors. I got my stacks of BBQ so still got over 30K points too.
---
How dare you complain bout my boi billy. The original fast af boi zooming around the map. The goat of sexy haircuts with the most perfect style ever xp
---
my little pony songs
---
How about you learn to fucking spell correctly
---
Like you cry when you drop your ice cream
---
I've been a PC gamer since the damn 90s and I've always hated this argument. The game should be optimized on every platform it is released for. Miss me with this bushit.
---
No thanks I love it‚Äôs current state, shuts down tunnelling,
---
Nope. It's 25% of its maximum progression IE 50% drops to 25%,99% drops to 74%, and 33% drops to 8%.
---
Toxic Selfie
---
Haven't had ice cream in years child
---
Go for a walk.  Stop spitting venom on the internet because of whatever inadequacy you feel in real life. Making fun of someone's cosplay pics?  Calling everyone kiddo.  Honestly it's pathetic.  And you should course correct before you grow up bitter and despised.
---
The feng is enjoying nia dying so much
---
If I‚Äôm a child don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a bad idea to threaten to beat me up ü§î you about as smart as that dumb bitch you gotta protect
---
Use Bond perk pretty useful if you play solo like me all the time. You need to play as the killer for few games to understand their powers better, study their perks so you know how to counter some perks.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea!  Now I don‚Äôt have to use an extra perk slot on No Mither when I want to cripple myself all game /s
---
Wait until killer queues die once dedicated is released. It's already a big enough joke. Can easily 4k my way to purple with no perks.
---
Ask u/MrChibiterasu
---
I mean hey I dont mind hurting a child. 
---
Really couldn't care.
---
Some kids need a smack to put them in line.
---
Not as pathetic as your life and the only thing despised here is you by your parents
---
I find playing him really boring and he's really difficult to control. Maybe i'm just trash, but still.
---
noooo, hillbilly should be #1. who else drives around? so fun. just played a billy game now. lol@running into a pack of survivors healing a downed one and then driving away to give them time to regroup for the next hit and run. technically he shouldve been driving a lawnmower, considering how he moves
---
There we go.   You know what man.  I'm proud of you. Spitting 8th grade insults with the best of them.  Stay golden ponyboy
---
why would someone want this kind of a change to one of the best perk in the game...
---
Yeah go smack a actual child and then when youre getting man handled in jail by frank the tank tell me about how you don‚Äôt care
---
Idiots...
---
Hey I'm bi. I don't mind
---
I‚Äôm proud of how you just seem to think this has anything to do with you
---
It‚Äôs mostly just for if you get downed near a open exit gate you just ds and escape
---
I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt there bitch boii
---
They did. Casual gamers far outnumber us and consoles are more accessible to them. You're one of those unironic PCMR fuckboys, aren't you?
---
I don't,  I mean hey it's pride month after all.
---
Same. It was a Billy too. It was super fucking weird. The game would just start lagging but not randomly, only when he was close or when we were in a chase. It started lagging all the time after I was the last survivor alive though. Makes one wonder...
---
I don‚Äôt see what that has to do with you hitting children mr neck beard but okay
---
Right, but a smart survivor would pop that perk near a loop. A face camper secured a kill by staying there, there s a chance they don't to kill the exposed person so it's not worth the risk. Also I know another survivor ISN'T working on a gen trying to taunt me, rewarding my face camp
---
Ooof sure I'm neck beard mate, still pulled more girls than you, should say a lot about you
---
Smack My Bitch Up
---
shoutout to vibez! btw fuck that mrgolden dude. i always see him being leaving prick comments
---
By the way you type yea
---
But yea no point in arguing eith a salty perdon like you
---
the file of my game got corrupted and i cant play until i fix that and i dont know how to, when i play after a few minutes i got a strange message and the game close so i cant try thr killer
---
What does that do? I did play killers at start, really enjoyed nurse actually l. Was thinking about picking up ghost face too
---
I hate when the fuckers lag right through the exit gate's corner. Like I'm about to land the second hit, I'm gonna get this guy, he's running into the corner which means I can swing and it WILL absolutely hit him and I will be able to hook him. This bastard lags right through the corner, basically teleporting him inside the exit gate and leaving me with an empty hit at the corner.
---
Only girls in your life are thunder thigh Meg over there and your disappointed in you mom
---
I hate the term tunneling so much lmao. How can you get mad at someone doing the objective.
---
wtf no, it's not get-out-of-jail-free card anymore + in its current state is better than ever
---
Bond lets you see all survivors at a limited range. I believe at Tier 3 it was up to 36 meters.
---
I mean she's one of many, so XD
---
It's in the roadmap for year 4! They're fixing the game health all year
---
Yeah dude im sure she is üòâ
---
But, why would you not just take Monitor &amp; Abuse on Mike?? It's the best thing ever, considering it comes with free jumpscares due to smaller terror radius included
---
Shadowborn is pretty good on certain Killers I've been having a lot of fun running it on ghostface also good on nurse to help her with her tracking weaknesses
---
It really sucks when you chase a survivor and by the time you have them on a hook their three friends with tool boxes and perks that increase gen progression have completed 3 gens.
---
Your girlfriend is cool. Good catch.
---
if 3 people DC i will farm with the last person
---
smack me into pallets so i can break them while you get points until you find the hatch
---
I've never had someone do that
---
Good job, so tired of killers doing this. Such a jerk move. I have noticed that killers will teabag me but it‚Äôs to help me get points and I help them get points by letting them hook me and my friend joins in on it and we all help each other out. Everyone gets a win in this, the killer always lets us escape when we do this but then you get these guys... to who are literally toxic af.
---
It's the sound of the Koroks from Zelda Breath of the Wild
---
Which perks are bugged exactly? I read fairly recently that the devs have announced abusing wake up will get you banned but I can‚Äôt find that announcement on the forums. I run Prove Thyself fairly commonly and only just heard that it might somehow be bugged? I really don‚Äôt wanna get banned so I‚Äôd like to know as much as I can.
---
You had me until you said the word "Trash" Sorry dude. Maybe I'm just nitpicky but the word "Trash" always gets my goat.
---
Eh I was nice all game, got two hooks and immediately left them and even avoiding going after people just off the hook cuz I wasn't really playing too seriously. I wanted him to get a taste of his own medicine.
---
When you wanna get those uncloak hits with wraith or phase hits with spirit.
---
Freddy's auto aim on an awake survivor makes no sense
---
What's wrong with 360's?
---
I'd happily only get 3 DLC's over the course of a 4 month period rather than 3 months. Who knows? It might make the difference?
---
Okay but playing stealthily in of itself is extremely useless and self destructive, so running would always be better.
---
Oh shit my mind automatically thought it was claudette lmfaoo
---
A console is a computer. It's a 300 dollar computer
---
...nigga how?
---
Brown medkit &gt; selfcare. I hardly ever have to heal more than once a match without a teammate
---
For better playstyle: 
---
The gotta play more killer. Even if you enjoy survivor play more then killer. Playing as killer gives you a much better knowledge about the way the killers act in loops how they interact with windows, pallets, loops, how they hear notification. But most importantly how they see. There is a lot of Potential gor a survivor tp use their better sight against the killer. Also when playing killer you prob see other survivors doin jukes or loops you might never seen otherwise. 
---
For perks:
---
Go to level claudette to unlock selfcare for your charakters if yoz havent already. Its the most used survivor perk for a good reason. Meg will bring you a few very noice perks too if you looking for new perks. Balance landing and urban invasion are great perks so you should also level nea. 
---
In game:
---
First and most important thing. You got stuff to do, dont waist your time.
---
When you are in a match always look at your teammates healthstatus. You can see when someone is chased and you got time to do stuff. You prob notice what killer you go against if you dont know already. Be helpfull to your team and heal them if you can. Make sure the killer is not around when performing an unhook. Never instasave. Dont always tryhard to search for ruin. Learn to deal with hard skillchecks. When 2 of your teammembers are on the ground or hooked  stop whatever you are doin and go to help. Remind where you got pallets and potential hidingspots. Try to recognize the killers perk by watching their acting.
---
Red aura Dwaight is fucking scary tho
---
Are... Are you OK? Are you having a stroke? Do you need me to call someone? I understood none of that.
---
Pretty funny if you consider you are using 4 perks just to become a "nurse" :D
---
Exactly.
---
NOED has a downside but a small one. The fact that if survivors do totems its completely worthless. Also idk how not having a downside is a way to say its strong. I mean... 90% of perks have no downsides.
---
Swap Myers and doc and you have my list as well
---
Switch Hag and Freddy too for me. Hag is my worst killer by a LONG shot
---
Wow. I never thought I'd say this, but you are definitely from Reddit. Never thought I'd see someone who not only no lifes Reddit but also Twitch at the same time. I think I just threw up in my mouth a little from your text...
---
Killer: facecamping.
---
Survivor: Tbagging after a pallet stun.
---
It was staged in KYF. I can tell from the number of failed screenshots in our Discord server.
---
Survivor: DC on purpose, suiciding on hook, farming teammates
---
Is it toxic? Yes
---
Is it a deliberate attempt to taunt the killer? Yes
---
Is it an attempt to enrage and/or bully the killer? Yes
---
And for the record I agree that this killer is toxic, I never disagreed with that.  But knowing that survivors are trying to piss you off, that they're going out of there way to insult and annoy you along with any other bullshit they may try to pull can most certainly be grieving and annoying to the point where if you go through that enough it's just not fun to play killer. That's the point I'm trying to make.
---
Kate. Theres just something about her that do evil.
---
Well I just killed the last guy bc I was still toxic from the last match
---
Get used to it, learn to predict it. Aim down at the ground when blinking, that way you‚Äôll ne in the same spot then either hit or use second blonk to attack
---
nothing, I was mistaken..
---
credits to wasabi for grinding this pic
---
&gt; Survivor: Tbagging after a pallet stun.
---
Very strangely i don't actually mind it that much when i'm Killer. It actually reminds me of a boxing match where your opponent just hit you good and he says "Hey like that pussy?". Its all in good fun.
---
Killer: facecamping, hard-tunnelling, ebony moris.
---
Survivor: t-bagging, farming teammates, working with the Killer, sandbagging, *clickclickclickclickitttyclickclick*
---
He was toxic in general, not just t-bagging. T-bagging itself is harmless IF you dont get offended, wich you did, and lost the game.

No.
---
Delete this.
---
Isn't it just a minor tweak?
---
&gt; clickclickclickclickitttyclickclick
---
That's just a way to tell the Killer "CHASE ME PLEASE I NEED ATTENTION". I don't think its a big deal.
---
Power move: tbag him after a pallet stun.  *Ghostface intensifies*
---
Omg I just realized. That‚Äôs perfect. And now she needs a hug.
---
Tf, I get only one every 5 bloodwebs
---
Funny thing is i sometimes do Tbag after a pallet stun, but then i mess up and will get caught 10 seconds later. I always feel like an idiot when this happens xD
---
As a killer if you facecamp the farmer it's usually appreciated
---
Credits to Talysha for being a super smol bean.
---
Never seen scream, but I love the mechanic and the fun stuff h can pull off. Also my main now, when load times go down.
---
I feel so enlightened!
---
But mid-chase though? That shit's just annoying.
---
No it is not considered holding the game hostage.
---
For the love of God can people stop throwing that thing around.
---
Devs have gone on record multiple times stating that if there is a timer attached to it it is not holding the game hostage whilst you can make an argument for griefing you cannot call it holding the game hostage.
---
So let's run through the list a pig trapping you in an area with a reverse bear trap active and ticking down is not holding the game hostage.
---
Someone trapping you in a corner what's the endgame clock ticks down is not holding the game hostage.
---
Someone blocking a specific area to prevent a hook save until the person dies is not holding the game hostage.
---
As for teabagging 90% of the time it is done to be toxic it specifically done to get a rise out of the Killer. The same thing could be said for a killer unnecessarily smacking the last survivor on hook it doesn't affect the game play it's just unnecessarily toxic.
---
Even to a lesser extent closing the hatch on a slug survivor doesn't really affect the game play as the survivor would have practically been dead anyway it's just you being massively toxic.
---
However this killer was a massive asshole for the repeated dragging them back so I am happy the survivor in this situation managed to escape
---
Tbh the emblem system actually punish farming so i'm not sure why anyone would do it.
---
they say it is but they are guaranteed to mess it up due to them not knowing what minor is or there spaghetti code.
---
Hold on is BBQ bugged? I've had it constantly max at 3 stacks even though I have it tier 3. Is this the bug?
---
clickclickittyclickclickittyclickclick at every pallet they drop and the exit gate is when ir becomes toxic.
---
These ideas are great!
---
i wouldn't cause i'd earn money and bought a pc lol which i did. i don't envy or bitch about stuff i am able to change so...
---
For some reasons i can't explain i don't love facing him, but since i started using spine chill i'm doing a lot better against him. But i totally agree the balance is great :)
---
True lol

---
Yes, survivors on the hook activate whispers.
---
Da tool box with da new parts. Dang :P
---
they did not destroy the pc gaming. also literally said there consoles more but lack in quality for that reason. just like cheap and expensive cars. or any products at this point.
---
Load times have gotten a little better for me now, only about 5min wait.
---
super dang
---
Because ranks don‚Äôt matter right now
---
Well, I‚Äôm just not a good sport
---
Been a few days since I played killer, Saturday maybe? So would expect it to go down. Gonna really enjoy learning him. 
---
So far, 4k every game.
---
Nothing is toxic unless you are deliberately trying to be toxic.
---
While in game, the steam overlay chat yesterday took priority over the game when someone send me a message (causing me to die because I was currently button smashing on the hook), I haven't changed anything in steam or dbd's settings, anyone know how to fix it so it stays in the background like it should?
---
I think doing it at the exit gates is more toxic than during a chase.
---
Here is a boxing analogy. Clickclick during a chase is similar to trash talk and dropping your hands during the fight. I guess its somewhat toxic, but its kinda in good fun. But clickclick at exit gate is like making fun of your opponent AFTER you just KOed him, that's not nice at all.
---
Yea I never disagreed that he was toxic. And are you're going to act like t-baggers trying to be assholes are ok? Like trying to insult killers for whatever reason isn't toxic?  And that's something people shouldn't get offended by?
---
Do they didn't have to tune the lighting on every new map. Also. They were shitty and stupid.
---
What about the killer deliberately DC‚Äôing after being pallet stunned or blinded?
---
No he was going for the maximum amount of toxicity the only reason why he messed up was because he didn't realise there were no hooks around the area. 
---
If he knew that he definitely wouldn't have let the ass even open the exit game.
---
Once he realised his mistake there was not much you could do other than hope the ash would bleed out which was it going to work.
---
Honestly I was expecting him to mori the ash right by the exit point however I found it hilarious that his miscalculation led to him getting BM'ed himself
---
if you have it on steam, you can right click on the game in your library, open properties / local files and look for a button that says verify integrity. it'll go through your files and make sure everythings okay, and re-download the ones that are corrupted.
---
Cmon now how can you be so ignorant to not know what a ‚Ç¨ (yes it‚Äôs a euro) is and how much it‚Äôs worth.
---
I might be wrong, but it‚Äôs usually Americans that are so self-centered they know nothing outside of their own country.
---
And fps
---
BT is not a necessary perk at all buddy
---
Just do not unhook in killer terror radius, and tank a hit for the rescued if killer comes back too fast.
---
Has someone said Head On? I got Jane a couple days ago &amp; have been running it for about a week. Have yet to get a head on stun.
---
I didn't know until now ... you keep learning  ^^
---
 Can people really stop policing people's perks I don't care whether it's The Killers perks or the survivors perk.
---
It doesn't matter if the killer is running ( insert controversial perk) or if the survivors running (insert controversial perk) it's alright to be annoyed by it but don't try to police them
---
Hell the only time I will ever bring up someone's perk to them is if they actively try to get upon a high horse and criticize me for something I'm doing what's the running something equally as bad.
---
I want had a Min running decisive strike old MoM and Dead hard with an insta heal who then proceeded to criticize me for putting the jigsaw piece offering on. As it was an unfair advantage.
---
Plus there is no need to ¬´¬†manage¬†¬ª sprint burst, as you can just run without triggering SB
---
To all the noobs out there who don‚Äôt know how to do this: crouch, hold the run button while crouching, stand back up while holding the run button, and here you are, running with SB untriggered and available at any moment.
---
Fair enough. You also usually get a bonus outfit/cosmetic for buying it as a Chapter.
---
Yes because the teams working on DLC are the same ones fixing bugs.  And also, fixing bugs is as simple as hitting a "fix" button and doesn't take any time to figure out how to identify, solve, and fix reliably.
---
Jane has it.
---
I agree! To me it's a pointless perk. But I also understand that some people may use it and like it but to me it's just not for me
---
Hagtitty
---
Lololol yeah yesterday I was the obsession so I kept wondering what perk the killer had. At the end, found out he didn't have any, but all 3 other survivors were running DS.
---
Maps are literally the biggest factor when it comes to imbalance
---
yea i never do this nonsense as a killer.  i guess  people have some bad memories of being held hostage by survivors before the end game collapse.
---
or they're just assholes.
---
Wait for lobby
---
Gets in game
---
4 p3 Quintons
---
4 p3 quintons
---
Tunneling is not toxic at all imo.
---
Now i'm feeling even more scammed :,(
---
I guess no one saw that I said "in general". Nowhere did I say that all survivors were toxic. But in a community where filled with crybabies, I guess it's fair to assume that I meant something other than what I said.
---
Actually people think SB is bad for a false reason.
---
They think surv need not to run to preserve SB, but it‚Äôs actually false, you can run without activating SB.
---
My standard build is Balanced Landing, Iron Will, Self Care and We'll Make It. The last two I often change tho. 
---
I also like to run Bond, good for seeing who's getting chased or if you're being chased that you don't lead the killer to someone on a gen/healing, and if rank reset has occurred and I'm playing at green /yellow ranks, I'll switch We'll Make It for Borrowed Time.
---
If you wanna have fun and like to try and break chases, Diversion is awesome when it works, but needs a long time to charge. And Adrenaline is pretty good I guess, but I personally find it too situational.
---
If you don't like BL, Lithe and Dance With Me is an awesome Houdini combo to try and lose the killer.
---
i love you friend
---
you receive shards by leveling up. from lvl 1-50 you get less than 300 shards per level but from 50-99 you'll receive 300 shards per level.
---
if you‚Äôre really upset about possibly getting certain maps, bring a map offering every game. it really isnt that hard to play on certain maps. :/
---
Yep. Pretty much standard. Play a few blinks normally, see how the survivors react. If they run to you most of the time, just aim at the ground and you will stay in the same place. 
---
Just at don't try this on the basement shack, game map or anything else with an 'upstairs' section.
---
what makes spirit, Clown or doc fun to go against?
---
Not a fan of facing him, I can‚Äôt seem to knock him out when he corner leans,
---
but gen rushing is? lmao
---
It is when survivors are abusing broken perks (Cough) Wake Up.
---
just remember when a survivor clicks at you theyre wasting their battery and giving themselves less opportunity to blind you
---
Now we're talking
---
Here's where I turn your shitty logic against you: "if you're really upset about facing instasaw with ruin and noed and getting facecamoed by him just burn an offering for OP maps."
---
Like do you unironically expect the killer to care about your fun ESPECIALLY when you burn an offering for a map that is absolutely 0 fun to play as killer?
---
Credit to u/sopherium for the image
---
She bled out while in the jumping animation lol
---
If there are 3 ppl with no hooks and your chasing one person who already has 2. I mean it's a little toxic
---
That looks like a bug more than Claudette camo.
---
Wait so what chapters give more cosmetics?
---
Actually, I NEVER camp. I'm a Doctor main. I drag shit out as long as possible. I actually don't receive much hate mail cause I play the game honorably.
---
This post was more a reflection of a lot of posts I've seen - thus the *SHITPOST* flair.
---
But, while you're going on with those assumptions, go ahead - throw out something else you *think* you know all about.
---
I'll wait.
---
Does it stack with the others?
---
Has the 'event' finished now?
---
Probably because we don't need to know it.
---
Yes. The red color denotes that they are literally ‚Äúultra rare‚Äù. Its the kind of thing you find once in a bloodweb at P3 lvl 50, maybe two if you‚Äôre lucky, and they‚Äôll usually just be an add-on or a splinter if you don‚Äôt have all the DLC. And around that level, it costs around 50k bloodpoints to get a new bloodweb. I hope that was informative for you.
---
These are great
---
Oh shit!!! A vibez ;)
---
You‚Äôre betting a lot on police doing due diligence, which often doesn‚Äôt happen with serial Killers. Occasionally you do, but then again, Dahmer just got to take his naked victim home, from police custody. and Richard Ramirez was pulled over in a stolen car, the cop jokingly asked him if he was the killer than was so oblivious that Ramirez was able to just walk away.
---
Betting on them testing the shirt is a bit of a long shot.
---
I always get pulled out of Night Shroud easily. It‚Äôs just a matter of learning the detection zones. I‚Äôve had survivors hiding behind corners pull me out of it.
---
cant relate but you wanna play dead by daylight rn?
---
Yeah, but afaik it's only a visual bug.
---
I get the occasional compliment, yeah. My usual offering as of late is the Gal Gateau and I play Ghost Face with BBQ and Make your Choice so I don‚Äôt need to camp/tunnel to snowball.
---
Yup, even in the lore she was described as an specially beautiful girl.
---
Oh shit!!! A doety
---
I mean, considering there would have been 5 corpses in the building, and those two only had superficial stab wounds, as well as the fact that Prescott being the killer makes little sense, I think they'd have known
---
Every other post on Fortnite is "OG" this and "OG players" deserve this or that... it was a joke mang

---
He‚Äôs still viable on any map. Even Coldwind has those large Harvesters you can walk up on to get a view below you.
---
Sadly necessary if you don't want constant losses. Survivors talk about how little choices their are for them but don't realize how bad it is for killers
---
What?
---
12 ish is way too high hahaha.
---
Id say when you get to about rank 4 youre playing real games.
---
Up until then its idiot city.
---
Thats always fun, since they‚Äôve wasted time/distance trying to blind you from behind a pallet.
---
Don't you dare joking about Amanda!
---
Just spin in circles lol
---
I saw that match, he did fine during that match if I remember. I don't remember any instance of him getting revealed with him behind a wall, sure the survivors were hiding, but they took a long time to reveal him since he kept canceling said reveal.
---
He capitalized well with every single night shroud in some way, whether it was 99%ing survivors for easy insta downs, or his shroud breaking and turning his attention towards who broke it. He can complain all day about "powah roles" and it being difficult against 4-man SWF red ranks but he did fine that match
---
As i said, you‚Äôre a idiot for getting so worked up over a guy tryna annoy you in a game.
---
Wait, there is?
---
It isn‚Äôt? Thank god.
---
Just as an added note: Legion‚Äôs Blade addons are also bugged in the same way Wake Up is in that they slow down all action speeds.
---
i don't mind it either. it just makes them easier to catch because there's less distance between the two of us
---
I came to this thread specifically to post this lmao
---
...This is freaking me out
---
I love going against the bing bong boi
---
i hope they fix the wake up bug soon. its ruining quentin's rep :(
---
4th of july i think
---
This is not entirely accurate, you are forgetting about their quality assurance testers who are responsible for some small bugfixing elements and a portion of the diagnostics legwork.
---
Sadly, their QA sucks and would rather spend their days jerking off then doing a good job.
---
You want some extra salt with your eggs?
---
I'm an avid player (330 hours) and I'm at purple ranks consistently (survivor and killer) How can I play with my group of friends who
---
* Play for a week or two every time a chapter comes out
---
* Are around rank 20-13
---
* Aren't that skilful or experienced 
---
Without making them go against good killers or hard to counter (Spirit or Nurse)?
---
Should I just buy a new account?
---
They're really cute, thanks!
---
I don't understand
---
Okay, so play a new game? There's thousands of good games. Find one you like!
---
I'll admit the game is very buggy right now with a lack of games and a massive difference is rank matchups. But ranting on a reddit page will do very little to fix this. Play another game or push through, anything after that is your own fault.
---
You're welcome :)
---
You‚Äôre very salty about matchmaking
---
My problem with bbq, is the survivor equivalent WGLF, does not have any benefit other than the points. I always thought that WGLF should show you the killers aura for 5 seconds after a hook save.
---
https://youtu.be/FjamP4cHJAE?t=475
---
There are one or two more times it happens. And no, the point isn't about whether he did good or not or if you like TrueTalent, it was just an easily accessible example of the issue. If it's a problem that survivors CAN'T reveal him, it *should* also be a problem if he gets revealed with no line of sight.
---
&gt; Maybe i'm just trash
---
Then get gud
---
I love this game but it takes too long to find the game
---
It bothers me that it's even possible to run a killer for four generators just because map designs (and what counts as a "chase" for the Bloodlust mechanic, like how certain buildings cause the chase to end while you can still see the survivor) and pallet spawns (hooray double pallets still being a thing too) are still so horrible.
---
That one person is easier to take out, and you know you can best them in a chase.
---
Everybody wants to win. The most efficient way to do that with a killer is to take out the weakest link.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Yeah some people will be overly upset over it but i think overall game health trump a handful of people that would cry about it on reddit
---
Mathmaking is pretty eh atm because of the game pass release and stuff.
---
I‚Äôm rank 16 and got in a game with rank 5-8 survivors. 
---
Safe to say I got my ass whooped lol. 
---
Crazy the mindset of the low/high? Ranks. 
---
They progressed each generator equally so I didn‚Äôt know what one to keep an eye on. 
---
Had to GG them at the end, was smart af!
---
Squiggity squiggity squad-up, moneygrip.
---
Luck offerings actually don't do anything for loot, only increases your chances of jumping off of hook or for escaping from bear traps. The only thing that affects item rarity from chests is Plunderer's Instinct.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs why the first scary movie is the best and why I‚Äôm really sad they have the terrible second one on Netflix but not the first.
---
Oddly enough, I started using wake up very quickly after EGC was released. Now one of the most underrated perks for EGC is bugged and I feel scummy using it. 
---
If I was the last survivor, I would count on the killer knowing where the hatch was, and I would go to the furthest door from the hatch. I would get out about 80% of the time using wake up, and praying the killer checked the other door first.
---
Besides the fact that literally ***no one*** plays as Quentin, so when you see him in game it pretty obvious what the deal is.
---
Agree need another perk to slow down gen rush. HexRuin is great but you need to protect the totem. Some survivors are smart they don‚Äôt look for the totem they look for the killer and locate the totem. this still buy you enough time to down and hook foolish survivors who let their guards down and run like bats out of hell.
---
It lights up if you are within a certain range of a survivor and it is not directional. So if you are standing still and it lights up you have no idea which way they are. Though in the inverse if you see it trigger as you are moving most likely the survivor is in the direction you are moving, no guarantee of course.
---
Game balance reasons (Claudettes on Macmillan with New Moon Offering), and also it was taking too long to add more lighting to each map.
---
Because the type of people that run it usually make the game suck for everyone. The playstyle associated with running urban is boring for killers and counterproductive for survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs on sale on mine and it says it ends on 7/2
---
I mean, self care should just be a default at a trash level so we have more perk diversity. I run adrenaline anyway. At the current state of the game, you have a point with Urban, this game does not reward stealth, might as well not use it.
---
He needs it after all the salt
---
i have no problem with the bloodpoint generation. similar to htoth. give bp bonuses for when the totem is active.
---
Patrol gens.  Don't tunnel.  It's okay to let a survivor go after you get a hit.  I'd recommend pop goes the weasle / surveillance to help with monitoring gens - I really can't see any downsides to any level of surveillance considering it doesn't have a gen aura cap.  
---
Actively drive people away from gens, don't rely on ruin to delay it for you :/
---
Nice.
---
I can't really change your mind because you are right. Ruin is by far the perk with the highest impact on the game. When its somehow not found for the whole game, i need to get owned REALLY HARD to lose the game. But if its found instantly, then its the opposite... even with really good and quick chases it will be a close one lol
---
OEAUGHWAEEEEH!
---
thing is outside of just assuming that every killer has it, you don't really ever get told the killer absolutely has bbq until the very end. so if the killer doesn't end up running bbq at all (rare), you waste so much time trying to counter something that doesn't even exist lol
---
Does it really matter if the killer gets you on a hook or carries you far away so that the game kills you instead
---
"relaxing" in the sense that there's nothing that's annoying
---
I mean, personally I like Ruin, but with it being a Hex perk, it's risk/reward is built in and, with some of the shitty totem placement along with the fact that everyone expects Ruin at this point makes them search for it all the time and it's usually gone in minutes.
---
Basically this. I'm sure anyone who plays dbd long enough notices that the devs re-use lots of assets when creating new maps, perks, and powers. Looking at Ghost Face alone he re-uses Michael's stalking mechanic in terms of how to use and sound, though it's still fundamentally different. His thrilling tremors perk blocks gens with the same method as corrupt intervention. I also wouldn't be surprised that furtive chase is bugged right now due to it using copy/pasted code to DS, i.e. once the action is performed it just makes you the obsession much like DS does but it doesn't check for what the perk says it should in that you're performing the action on the obsession at the time.
---
It is also no coincidence that stack related perks are bugged right now at the number 3 the same time we are celebrating the 3rd year anniversary, they somehow tangled code between the 2 things.
---
This is why usually with every patch something seemingly unrelated breaks when new mechanics or perks are introduced.
---
I'm sure tons of people wouldn't mind if they took people off implementing a new chapter for a cycle of 3 months and dedicated the whole "chapter cycle" to redoing code.
---
A krabby patty? Who knew I guess
---
I've been playing since the 2016 beta and I'm pretty sure teachables were always in, just not available during the beta due to level caps :/
---
&gt; weird Nerf
---
what weird nerf? i used to use this too just cuz it's a cool way to track survs outside of scratch marks.
---
I would prefer getting hooked so I can die and get into another game rather than sit around and get bullied for 3 minutes
---
My opinion it's a waste of a perk spot for my type of playstyle.
---
I‚Äôm Tired of being slugged and brought to the treat door to have it closed in my face before the whole exit gate ‚Äúgame‚Äù you mentioned occurs. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how to fix that situation either, but what I do know is it sucks.
---
Ah, I see
---
i don't think people are using it solely as a bp generation tool
---
If you actually played in high ranks, you'd see the point I'm trying to make. If I don't use Billy Spirit or Nurse against an SWF at red rank. I have to use ruin or bbq to stand the smallest chance of not getting gen rushed
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure half the perks just don‚Äôt work atm.
---
Never had this happen to me....you might just be unlucky
---
But the issue is if that strong power is taken away, so will the bloodpoints.  Most people already claim they use it just for the bloodpoints; I say let them keep it and allow us to at least get rid of the fucken x Ray vision
---
That never happened to me, but tbh i'd welcome the free evader points.
---
Just chillin. Killin.
---
maybe it was the beta i was playing then. but yeah i think teachables are sort of a problem in terms of removing identity from characters.
---
This, really isn‚Äôt that hard when compared to trappers. Even in red ranks I can get this easily.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen quite a handful of times, so I‚Äôm glad it hasn‚Äôt happened to you haha
---
Precisely. I've had games where it was never found and it was a 4k game with MAYBE one gen done, and others where they spawn literally on Ruin and it's a 1k or 2k game.
---
A simple perk should not have that much effect on the game, nor should we be so dependent on a single perk like we are.
---
If you think you don't need one of the only meaningful pinpointing perks that can't just be moved around (like Whispers can be) or avoided without any effort (Spies from the Shadows) and at least makes survivors get off generators and hide in lockers and the only perk with a meaningful slow to generator completion (Thanatophobia and Huntress Lullaby are quite conditional, Overcharge and Pop Goes the Weasel have their own problems - one does nothing if you're good and the other doesn't take effect at the start of the game) so that all four survivors don't escape in three minutes...
---
Then do you even play killer?
---
Well fuck me for trying to bloodpoints and slow the gen rushers down I guess
---
They can hit you through windows and over fences, be careful out there in the fog.
---
I started using wake up when end game was released, and I survived multiple times by opening the door very quick after the hatch was closed. Originally i was confused why all my action speeds had a yellow progression bar after the latest patch XD. Now I feel scummy using it.
---
thats not what i said like at all, dont twist peoples words. i said: if u really dont want RNG to give u a certain map, bring a map offering every game. otherwise dont complain about maps. ill play any map, killer or survivor. dont get pissy over a map.
---
I absolutely Love this.
---
Thanks for the tips, will try!!
---
I am a high rank killer, eat shit.  I play the Plague and hag a fair amount, and I don't give much of a shit about winning but seem to fairly often do that anyway.  You don't need it.  It's your crutch.
---
Only when walking and running, they disabled it when crouching because it would look really odd.
---
This is wholesome
---
Not really funny just a little salt
---
Honestly if you play both sides equally, you may as well get the rest of the Licenced DLC. The ones that can be bought with shards you‚Äôll get over time. This game is a big grind so you‚Äôll invest that time wisely.
---
Nurse around rank 8 I find very fun to play against on console. But I can appreciate how rank 1 survivors on PC think she is bullshit with certain perks. I've watched some top ranked PC players stream, and there just doesn't seem to be much counter play at that rank, with such great mouse sensitivity.
---
She is difficult to use, more difficult on console. Best bet is sit down, watch YouTube during lobbys on how to learn her, play with her, get the memory of how your blinks work. Rinse and repeat you'll be able to hit more and more blinks. Oh and don't use any add ons, they will mess with your muscle memory. Use tracking perks and slowing down the game perks so you can practice blinks as long as you can. A couple hours later you'll be able to get kills more consistently
---
loooool!
---
I know what, it‚Äôs useless what damage are you gonna be able to do with that.
---
Yer welcome!  I forgot to mention, but hitting a survivor and letting them go if they're being a time sink is good because they'll usually spend time healing themselves / get someone else to heal them.  That takes 2 survivors off of gens.
---
They need to change the state of the game that requires BBQ&amp;C and Ruin to be an integral part of the Killer's kit then.
---
Make generators take longer (or give the killer a better way to regress them) and give them more inherent tracking and we can discuss builds without BBQ&amp;C/Ruin.
---
I‚Äôve been lucky too not run into more then 1 person running wake up in a game. I was trapper and found a streamer who used Wake Up and then peaced out once the game ended. Went too his stream and called him out for it, probably got banned from his stream but maybe you shouldn‚Äôt abuse broken bugs imo. They really need too make an in game announcement about this bug so the excuse ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt told‚Äù can be said.
---
Its now on a short cool down and the requirements for getting the notification to popup are weirder :( no more conga lines of disturbed crows
---
"It's easier with BBQ than without" is a line I always say. Can I do without it? Yes. Do I want to go without it so I purposely hinder myself? No.
---
On killers with shit movement (So not Nurse, Billy, and less so Spirit) you need BBQ so you can pick a next target and apply pressure. Because that equates to 1 on hook, 1 going for the save/now healing the unhooked survivor, 1 in a chase with you, 1 on gens. Which is the most valuable time for a killer to do work. If you don't have BBQ then you're most likely guessing unless a survivor has fucked up, which is the key thing, survivor fucking up, not you doing well, big difference.
---
BBQ really really helps the flow of a match for Killer and that passive is what is needed. Again, for most killers. Sure, its interactivity is trash, but unless you make all killers able to be as efficient without it as with it, it's going to be in nearly every game you play against a killer as survivor.
---
The same applies for interactivity with Ruin, except in my opinion only God Nurse's and maybe even God Billy's are the only ones who can *Maybe* deal without Ruin. It's a sad game as Killer.
---
Thx thought I missed it.
---
If they actually set out to improve the core Foundation of the game within a reasonable time say 3 months by devoting the majorty of there time to it to make a actual impact on the stabilty of the game as a whole i feel most would be happy with that. Sure if they stop content for aix months or a year then thats too much of a cost but i feel we can miss a chapter for the improvement of the game not to mention fixing of the foundation would make the implementation of future content easier
---
I mean both these things equally mine salt.
---
The difference is that in one case, it's 4v1.
---
Like ... it feels pretty bad to terribly as a survivor. But it feels SO MUCH WORSE to do badly as a killer. Especially cause they have the means to taunt you even after you give up, and they will. Every time.
---
FALSE. freddy should be darn tier
---
Mine take around 5 mins, EU rank 5 atm. Same for survivor
---
Imagine being a chick, and getting fingered by a dude and you look down and see fuckin' Michael Myers.
---
Then don‚Äôt use it. If your game is to slow down generator progress, there are other perks to use I‚Äôm sure. Yes, people expect Ruin now because of its usefulness. You could run Haunted Ground, but there‚Äôs a risk they‚Äôll bypass it all together.
---
Certain pallets can be almost guaranteed chase-escapes or delay the killer at more important moments.
---
Having the shack pallet intact and undropped when you're on death hook and someone is opening the gate is more important than when you're uninjured (or even injured) and haven't been hooked yet.
---
Some people like to drop pallets on me when I play killer, they'll drop every single pallet in a huge swath of the map and stun me 6 times (out of the 8 they drop) in like 90 seconds.
---
Every single other person I find that game is 100% screwed because there's no fucking pallets, including the person who dropped them when I next find them.
---
Just like they were going to ban anyone that did the prestige glitch right? Because me and all my p3 characters sure are banned. üôÑ
---
sick of seeing spirit fury in there..
---
well there should be multiple viable strategies right? so you can have a game where the killer hunts down the next surv right away, turning the game into a glorified game of tag vs. being the cat/mouse, hide and seek type of game it used to be prior to bbq; or you can have the camping killer who gets punished with a gen rush and ends up losing anyway. both strategies should be just as effective.
---
maybe uninteractive is a poor choice of words, but really what i'm trying to say is that i think it'd be cool if killers used a larger spread of perks versus the single same perkset with minor variability.
---
Siege‚Äôs matchmaking is fine. It‚Äôs not perfect but I can get into a game in 20 seconds when it takes 4+ minutes to get a killer hand. Operation health was necessary at the time, now there are still glitches and hackers and whatnot; but it‚Äôs a normal level. Every game has hackers, even this one
---
You literally said..... in your first post..... for me to "get better"
---
i mean the dead hard is there...
---
Wait isn‚Äôt this just a revert to the old pig? And if so, it doesn‚Äôt go well with endgame collapse sadly. And did you just imply a nerf for hangman‚Äôs trick? One of the absolute worst perks in the game?
---
well i dont run bbq cuz i'm not going to pay for any dlc lol i don't believe in any sort of pay to win type of mechanics, and it's a little disappointing that this one in particular is so rampant.
---
thanks OP
---
Here is the wonderful thing, you can run whatever perk you want.
---
I don't know, man, I loaded into a match as Doctor the other day, started to use Treatment mode, soon people started screaming and then seconds later three of them DC'd.
---
They're not meant to but, yeah. BHVR gonna Misbehave.
---
I'd say no add ons are better. You don't wanna mess with fatigue time too much cuz it will make the user go more blinky blinky lungey. They gotta feel the punishment so they won't mess up next time. But I'm not even sure what those two do anyways lol. Not good with her add on names yet.
---
That's the same for killers and survivors, they have to assume or guess about things like borrowed time, or D'S.
---
I break pallets.
---
I just love being forced to grab a max mist, freddy splinter and enduring 3 on my nurse bloodweb, literally killing my bp
---
Dead Hard has been on the shrine before, is available from a base character so I wouldn't waste shards on it, *and* it's the only non-shit perk in this entire shrine. It being there does not make this shrine good.
---
&gt; unless you make all killers able to be as efficient without it as with it
---
this right here i think is the root of the issue. perhaps the killers should be able to use teachables but only at a tier 1 level versus being able to use it as effectively as the killer it's meant for. that might help with balancing it a little and encourage people to use cannibal specifically for the bigger returns on bbq.
---
I run it so I don‚Äôt have to spend bp on high priced items
---
Jigsaw's Baptism wasn't changed in anyway because the way it's written above.
---
Also Hangman's Trick wasn't neft, but brought to the level that Saboteur is at since Saboteur increases the increases the repair time by a maximum of 30 seconds *(And If I had my choice, 1 minute)*.
---
Just look back at how they did things in the past. How long it took them to fix bugs (adding new and reintroducing old in the process), how obvious were the bugs that we saw in every new patch (internal testing? is that even a thing?).
---
You see... a lot more people would‚Äôve agreed with you if you left out BBQ.. or replaced it with NOED. I agree with you that ruin is annoying and not interactive but most killers use BBQ for the huge bloodpoint bonus it gives. It‚Äôs just that BBQ happens to be a perk that is also pretty strong.
---
I definitely like him too! I wouldn‚Äôt main him personally cuz I like killers with map pressure as well as given me more sped or range(so spirit, plague, and legion)
---
But it‚Äôs great you‚Äôre having fun with the new killer man! They seem rly fun imo. They just need to apply more map pressure beyond being sneaky sadly :(
---
I'm in midwest USA and I struggle finding lobbies on both sides. Survivor is better but it's still 10 minutes plus.
---
üòÇ my god
---
That's why the shrine of secrets exists
---
Also EU but it just refused to put me in any games.
---
If I don't find a lobby in 3 to 5 minutes I requeue.
---
Oh yes, look how much Wake Up is breaking the game. You 3 k'ed.
---
Look how OP Wake Up is compared to a Mori. 
---
Ironic.
---
I SEE THEY FIXED ALL THE PERKS NOW. WHERES SLL THE IDIOTS SAYING EVERYONE THAT USED WAKEUP WOULD GET BANNED?
---
OH SHIT!! A fathom!
---
I'd have to get back to you on that tbh, it's mostly just placeholder perks.  I carpetbomb high traffic areas with unpredictable traps and then lure people into them with chases for easy hits.  I know brutal strength is one since she's the killer everyone learned to loop :/
---
Do you know if it fixed any other things?
---
There‚Äôs been a lot of suspicious lag lately. Such as vaulting windows while the clown is still chasing you but somehow you get downed and teleported all the way back to window when he picks you up.
---
It‚Äôs great for me on PS4. The only frame issues i have any more is only when playing Doc lol
---
Those characters are still very new, so I wouldn't be expecting their perks to be showing up on the shrine anytime soon. There's a certain amount of time that has to pass before a newer DLC's perks can show up on the shrine.
---
Survivors just DC anyway. Doctor used to be the DC king, then it was legion and now it's just at its peak since survivors don't lose their items when they pull the plug
---
"NOT FUNNEH!!!" -~~Mick Jagger~~ Nea Karlsson, probably
---
sprint burst i think
---
I don't like it...I love it!!!
---
&gt; it'd be cool if killers used a larger spread of perks versus the single same perkset with minor variability
---
That would be awesome... it's just we don't have a lot of good perks. Same as survivors. As soon as you step away from "I play for fun/memes" mindset, your choice become very narrow.
---
i mean let's be honest, those people are cold-faced liars lol ofc they use it for xray vision. the bp bonus is a just that -- a bonus. there's zero downside to this perk and killers sacrifice/lose absolutely nothing from using it. it's maybe just too overloaded, that killers don't even need to think twice about taking it.
---
like if you take for example devour hope on hag. it's a great perk, but it has the downside of potentially being destroyed early in the match and essentially leaving you with 3 perks. the returns are high, the risk is high. for bbq, the returns are higher than probably all perks (dare i say), with no risk whatsoever.
---
W I G G L E
---
There‚Äôs an update so maybe restart game
---
This is that Self Healing bug. You can't wiggle, recover or exit the gates. You have to look for Hatch.
---
THE FIRST DBD MOBILE LIVESTREAM DIDN'T HAVE A BETA RELEASE DATE
---
What if ruin became a base kit thing. But the effect would change a bit so you can still progess the gen even though you failed a good skill check. Basically if you hit a good You'll be set back a couple seconds but not waste time to get back to where you were
---
Whether they're running BBQ or not, i always hop in a locker before someone gets hooked, just in case they are. It's the main reason why i run Quick and Quiet.
---
I'll try that now.
---
I've had games where I mess up as the killer and I had the survivors stand at the exit and t-bag for 5+ minutes. I know I did bad but I'm not DCing and I just want to move into another match.
---
With survivors, if someone's tunnelling at least it gives the other survivors a chance to get away and continue working on gens or whatever
---
It's not so much that I get worked up as it is I just don't want other players to be assholes. But what should I expect from someone like you who would try to make killers angry because it's apparently useful : )
---
100% agreed.
---
Most of the time I use it people just stand around and point at the light cuz they got no idea what it is
---
And it's too tight for people like me. I get headaches after just a few matches as killer due to the disgustingly low FOV. Besides, a survivor should never be able to hide just by crouching right in front of/to the side of the killer.

---
Aw I actually liked it. Eh I mean gotta do what most of the community wants
---
right i agree. i don't use any of those perks just out of spite. there's ways to win without them but people can't live without the crutch apparently.
---
With prestige 3 I get one at least every bw
---
I speak for all the Sleepy Boi mains here, they're not with us.
---
Thank the Lord! What was even the point of it?
---
Yeah should be quite cool, 
---
The removal of the stun effect on killers being pallet..ed? Should be interesting too.
---
I had that happen as Ghost Face too the other day. And I can say he could have simply tea-bagged his way out of it. At least that worked for me.
---
You‚Äôre saying some people are assholes, but whos gonna fix it? Theres always annoying people around, and you won‚Äôt help by crying about it because thats exactly what they want!
---
There is a new patch that fixed the bugged perks and adjusted Ghostface
---
There's a patch out, so you may just be not getting it yet
---
Aw, they removed that red flash thing? I thought that was interesting
---
"You have become the very thing you swore to destroy!"
---
Matchmaking is complete dog shit right now. Before the patch went live I was rank 10 and was put in with a bunch of rank 20's. I'm solo queueing right now. Playing killer can vary wildly or me right now. Survivors from rank 1 to rank 20.  Matchmaking is completely busted right now.
---
Their identity is in their power and addons. If anything, teachable give more variety because the killers can run whatever they want, rather than being confined to their 3 unique and the defaults.
---
IT REALLY IRRITATES ME WHEN KILLERS STILL USE NOED WHEN THEY HAVE EGC HELPING THEM
---
Don't have the slightest clue why they added it.
---
Defending a biug to make a point doesnt make you look too good, my dude. Most people agree Mori's are strong.
---
What bugged perks? For who and what did they do to derpface
---
right that's true as well. but i might argue borrowed time has sufficient ways to counter the perk. tunneling on the protected surv is a strat. just wait for the time to wear off and down em. or double hit them at all. leave the hook alone afterwards, and the perk is essentially useless. this is healthy counterplay that encourages the kller not to camp so that the survs have no use from the borrowed time perk.
---
bbq doesn't have anything that really encourages survs to do that's healthier. they are forced to play within the confines of bbq and "counterplay" it by getting into lockers or hiding behind inactive gens.
---
And I just said it didn't matter how many kills I got. Fuck off with that "stop crying" bullshit.
---
I can see how biased you are now. It's not fair for the survivors to go against higher ranked killers but somehow this is fair? You're insane. Just going to block you now.
---
BBQ isn't pay to win. It's super easy to counter if you know how, and survivors even have a perk that directly counters it.
---
i run both and am enjoying it.  the requirements to pip are whack though, can't wait until that whole system gets reworked.  escaping should guarantee you a pip since it's basically the entire point of the game.
---
Yes it took a ultra rare offering and me denying myself of a pip and bloodpoints to counter a team just using a bugged addon.
---
DOUBLE PAUSE
---
Yeah i mean take a game like overwatch or apex. games with heroes with abilities. imagine them being able to adopt other heroes abilities over time with extended play and experience. eventually the game would get stale, and people would find the "optimal/meta" build and just play that every game.
---
I hope audio issues are fixed and I can finally play survivor at least
---
If only killer queues went back to semi-fast :pepeHands:
---
I‚Äôve been seeing it a lot too. It‚Äôs not lag per se, it‚Äôs  a desync between the two games.
---
They're not even remotely equal lmao. This shit is a hundred times more toxic and obnoxious as fuck.
---
THIS SUB IS NOT MY ARMY SO I''M GOING TO CALL ALL OF YOU I HATE ALL OF YOU.
---
Full Patch Notes here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/549624/#Comment_549624
---
bbq is pay to win in the sense that you don't have access to it outside of purchasing the cannibal or hoping it shows up in the secrets shrine thing.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the Wake Up! perk to grant 5/10/15% increased action speed to all interactions at all times.
---
those are really inconsistent for me too, but the update didn't break that
---
Yeah they all camp while cloaked or tunnel the first survivor they find.
---
Hol up
---
quick and quiet is a dlc perk correct? sorry i'm not familiar with all the perks just yet.
---
thank goodness
---
What is more or less obnoxious is subjective. Your opinion is fine, but I think this is the closest equivalent.
---
I have no idea, Yet to try it out! 
---
I just assumed they reduced the stun effect so you can see what direction the survivor ran off more clearly. 
---
I liked the red flash though, we‚Äôll see anyway! 
---
They also lowered the head bobble with hits too, less juking for survivors. 
---
In a way, killers got a pretty big buff as to keeping track of their targets this patch!
---
Nope, that's one of Megs. Lets you fast vault silently once every 20 seconds.
---
Restricting perks to certain killers is definitely a bad idea.
---
Ghost face nerf? Fuck no, he got a fucking buff, twice the stalk in lean and no prox sound anymore! Fuck yeah BH, I love you for once
---
I would dig WGLF if the next time the killer hooks that survivor, their progress meter doesn't lower unless the killer is a certain distance away.
---
well you would think, but what ends up happening instead is someone combines a hag perk, a cannibal perk, a billy perk and another x perk on every killer. then it really doesn't matter what killer they use, they're going to run this perk set regardless. so maybe yeah it might add some variability *potential*, but it certainly doesn't shake out to add variability in reality at all.
---
You tried turning your Pip-Boy on and off?
---
I‚Äôm sorry..
---
Im glad they fixed huntress hatches, and removed that annoying visual effect of the stuns
---
IT IRRITATES ME WHEN KILLERS THAT HAVE A ONE SHOT ABILITY (LIKE BILLY OR LEATHERFACE) USE NOED
---
They fixed wake up, Sprint Burst, PWYF, BBQ,WGLF and that's all I know for perks but for Ghostface they removed the ability to refill the exposed effect and made him 8% easier to spot with some add on nerfs and 2 add-on buffs
---
there was lightning??????
---
THAT‚ÄôS EVEN WORSE TBH
---
I do. The aura reading is nice, but I want the BP. I feel for survivors. Their grind is even worse than killers.
---
\&gt;  I come across players who just sit on gens and when I found them they can‚Äôt loop for shit and I‚Äôm like how Tf are you in this rank! 
---
Is this a personal attack?
---
&gt; Removed the stun VFX when Killers entered stun state. 
---
Reduced the camera shake on successful hits. 
---
THANK YOU BASED BHVR
---
that's how anyone just picking up the game right now has to play anyway...take me for example. game just came on the xbox game pass. downloaded it and love the game, but i don't have all these teachables. so bad idea or not, it is a reality for some people, and either everyone should have that disadvantage or no one should have an advantage of any kind.
---
I'M ALREADY HAVING A VERY BAD DAY TODAY SO I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE PLAYED A DIFFERENT GAME TODAY, BUT I REALLY WANTED TO GET AS MANY GRUESOME GATAEUS AS I CAN BEFORE THE EVENT ENDS!!!
---
INSTEAD I PLAY DBD AND KEEP GETTING GAMES WHERE 2-3 PEOPLE DC BEFORE I CAN HOOK THEM!!
---
I JUST WANTED MY FRICKING BBQ STACKS!!!
---
Im a killer main and I‚Äôm so sick of full flashlight crews or people running flashlights in general that I just leav the lobby if I see someone using flashlights. I can‚Äôt handle them anymore
---
Depends on your playstyle, if it's just perks you want then legion has great perks, mad grit being my favourite. 
---
Spirit is also a very strong killer and has a lot of mind games.
---
Legion is also really good fun too, they may not be as strong but are fun as hell to play.
---
so basically either you have to play with Meg every game, or have played with her enough to have her teachable at this point. and if you recently prestiged and have only your exclusive perks on a character, you're screwed one way or the other.
---
see i don't think that's the right way to do that.
---
Ye I never fault a killer for switching lol. I totally get it. It's really no fun for anyone to steamroll on either side
---
I missed the stream while it was live. Any link to where I could watch it while my game updates?
---
Don't blame the killer, if anything blame the survivors for not doing stuff uncontested.

On topic good changes all around. Fixed cancerous bugs and unnecessary addons.
---
Dead by Daylight - Now playable.
---
I literally use Quentin and have since release because that's my actual name lol. Now all the sudden everyone loves him and people hate me for using him :(
---
It's a Jeff perk. I can't remember what it's called. You get tokens that shield you from BBQ.
---
Ghostface reminds both survivors and killers to stay hydrated in the fog.
---
Also certain actions do not give as many blood points as they should, like why is repairing one gen by yourself barely any points at all?
---
Exactly
---
Unrelenting is a learner's perk, and third seal rips through uncoordinated groups of survivors like the plague
---
Quintons no longer need to be dodged or moried. You just helped their population grow.
---
Yea, I feared legions power being more of a burden than a help. If u say he‚Äôs fun to play, I‚Äôll give him a try ; especially due to mad grit and discordance 4 basement builds :) 
---
I'm on xbox, have to wait a few minutes until it puts me into an empty lobby that immediately fills up.
---
* Fixed an issue that allowed Ghost Face to continue stalking already Marked Survivors.
---
That's pretty sad. I thought the ability to prolong the exposed duration was a feature, not a bug...
---
I never understood why people complain about gen rushing. The objective is to get the gens done so why would they not gen rush? I‚Äôm a killer main and still think it‚Äôs a sorry excuse for losing as killer
---
What audio issue?
---
This is partly due to the random nature of the game. One day I'm in discord with a buddy, and we're both playing killer. I hear him laugh on the other end. What's so funny? He tells me this survivor runs to one side of the map, and there are just 4 TL setups and no pallets. Sometimes it's nothing but TLs, other times you find yourself in a pallet factory.  
---
Some window setups are near infinites, others are completely useless. I think this is by design though. Sometimes you'll have hard games, and other times it gives you a break.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of playing plague or billy. How are they?
---
I did it yesterday to a Jeff that never came to heal his team mate. He let his mate bleed out while chilling in a locker next to them even when I searched the entire map. 
---
BM your team and I'll BM you
---
Same
---
whats that perk thing
---
I'm getting downvoted but FOV isn't locked for killers just to piss people off it's to make stealth fair and possible when playing against humans.
---
Yeah that's a buff in my book, and like one which wasn't needed but makes sense, so it's all good
---
[How y'all mfers look thinking Toastface was going to be nerfed when they said hotfix instead of nerf and even said they were going to buff him in the hotfix notes.](https://preview.redd.it/efj3xax3f1m21.png?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b57f54415557f0556600c69f37d204b678b0c9c)
---
Really glad they were quick to address the issues. Hell, on the console the FPS feels smoother again. 
---
**Thank you Behaviour.**
---
So Get in to the locker slowly instead...? Its not hard to counter bbq. Lol. I use Quick and Quiet so I can fast vault. Doesn't waste as much time.
---
get this shit up
---
Just because the entity gives survivors tools to give them a chance, doesn't mean it's on their side.
---
The killer does have an advantage time-wise, but only if the survivor team isn't pulling their full weight, or if someone is dead/ DCd
---
I noticed this, so leaning is still the beat but his addons will now just make his normal stalk build like his lean.
---
That‚Äôs good. Is there a link to see what they changed specifically?
---
Technically they didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just a lot smaller
---
So the dude deserves to wait 20 minutes for a match only to get stuck at the end because of a stupid glitch that should have been fixed years ago? Yea no fuck that. The point is to kill the people no matter what.
---
It was kinda bs, I‚Äôve had 3+ chases against GF and stay exposed the entire time,
---
What‚Äôs up with the glitch? I heard it got patched but what does it do?
---
He got a nerf to the BS "I'm just gonna walk behind you and get NOED and you can't stop me"
---
Does this happen to anyone else? 
---
When I'm playing Ghostface and the exit gates are open and I go into Night Shroud, the "reveal" sound effect plays immediately and never stops? I don't know the exact circumstances or what I was doing at the time but it has happened multiple times.
---
The highest quality shitposts on this sub.
---
Ruin isn't useless in low ranks, it just doesn't slow gens down as much, and survivors are usually better at finding totems at that rank.
---
I do use another perk, because it's not worth taking the, what, 40 seconds? to heal any time the killer has sloppy butcher. Taking the extra time to self-care is what killers want anyways- one person doing no gens for a period of time
---
I refuse to believe you‚Äôre even remotely trying to defend wake up. This must be ironic itself.
---
Yes I hate mathmaking, it is awful making math
---
They said it was completely removed
---
Wait I did the Quentin adept and a randomly generated build(it had wake up in it),will I be banned?
---
 Not crying about it, just trying explain things from a killers perspective. And since you flat out said that getting killers angry is useful and also that killers are idiots for getting angry at that you kind of come off as an asshole tbh.
---
I still consider it like nothing ever happened as they made him easier to spot and removed refilling the exposed status but removed him being loud in stealth and made leaning while stalking more important then being out in the open.
---
LOUD NOISES
---
they did. now it‚Äôs only his clothes that make subtle noise.
---
It's pinned
---
Honestly if you can't down a marked Survivor within 45 seconds then you really don't deserve to keep refilling the timer
---
It literally says they removed the sound in the patch notes
---
and jeff is dlc right? at least i don't believe i can play him at all unless he get's unlocked
---
No remember me making gates faster fix?
---

Nea is Ghostface confirmed.
---
Alright, I'll give you a smile and a soft chuckle.
---
I see prequel meme, I upvote
---
Well it just now got patch but it would allow 15% increased action speed on ALL actions not just opening the door as intended
---
Submit a Loss Of Progress Ticket to the devs on their website. They'll give it back to you.
---
He's still quite loud IMO...

Super low chase music.

I HATE WHEN PEOPLE THINK THE DEVS ARE IN IT FOR MONEY AND CANT FIX THEIR GAME DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW GAME DEVELOPMENT WORKS YOU NEED M ON E Y TO WORK ON IT YOU NEED MONEY TO FIX BUGS, BALANCE THINGS AND KEEP CONTINUING THE GAME. YOU NEED MONEY TO PAY FOR THR PEOPLE HELPING YOU MAKE IT. THAT IS WHY THEY MADE THE COSMETIC STORE, DLCS AND ECT. MAKING A GAME IS A PROCESS AND DOING CODING AND AS WELL AS INGAME MECHANICS WILL NOT ALWAYS BE 100% PERFECT. BE PATIENT FOR ONCE STOP HARASSING THE STAFF TEAM IN STREAMS AND ON THE FORUMS
---
Very easy: crouch, press and hold run, uncrouch, and here you go, you run and SB is not activate. With a bit of practice you can achieve it in less than a second, and to activate SB, just stop running and run again, so you can activate it at will almost immediately. So it‚Äôs better than BL and Lithe, because you can active it after a window or a fall, or whenever you think it is the most useful.
---
Actually SB with that is better than BL and Lithe, but only few people know it.
---
i mean youre right that the wake up abuse is toxic but gens get done in less than90 seconds solo anyways so
---
Im a killer main, first off. Secondly pissing off the killer and getting him to focus on you is useful because it distracts the killer and buys your team time to do gens or whatever. I am a asshole towards you because you didnt understand this.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
You waste a perk slot to find something rare and you still get browns.
---
This game....
---
There's some other juicy fixes in there as well, but that's the one everyone's looking for.
---
Yeah but survivors aren‚Äôt the problem. It‚Äôs the one sided balance.
---
There‚Äôs a 3 year anniversary sale on ps4. For ps plus users only, the game was free on ps plus too lol
---
Ah, I rarely play survivor but I too noticed it. Just thought they changed it.
---
U implied a nerf, also, jigsaws baptism was changed in the endgame collapse patch and you‚Äôre basically just asking to revert it. It was like that before.
---
i'm not saying bbq is difficult to counter. it's more a commentary on the fact that you are forced to play around it now since basically every killer uses it. sad part is when you encounter a killer that doesn't have it, and then learn at the end of the game that you wasted so much time getting in and out of lockers, and you could've been making better use of your time all game.
---
The chase music isn't fixed in this hotfix, but we're still looking into it. For the time being, some people are saying that disabling surround sound audio fixed the issue for them.
---
It was a feature. They already admitted it's a design they meant to remove but forgot.
---
I mean, if you don't want to buy the DLC, that's on you. I can't really get behind the mentality of players that are willing to play the game, but aren't willing to spend any money on post-release content they might want. Then they complain about the content being used against them.
---
-_- thanks man haha.
---
I've seen a bug where if the survivor is staring at you while they exit the exit gate the "survivor sees me" building up sound never stops playing.
---
and of course they didnt fix the very low music volume bug, guess i have to wait 3 months for that to be fixed
---
I think they said they meant to take it out when they increased the expose timer from like 20 to 45 seconds or whatever, but they didn't get the change in before the patch had to go live.
---
Ah it was posted as I was posting this post
---
its not
---
I know but we got fed up with these perks (dance with me, lightborn ..etc)

ok but the 2nd one really needed a change since it was annoying as hell when you looped him almost the entire exposed effect only to see he's going into stealth and mark you back again
---
Okay that must be it, thanks.

The survivors aren't the problem. The gens can be completed really fast, perhaps faster than they should be.

---
At the very least they removed the stupid sound he makes.
---
If you are playing with headphones, you can check if your sound settings are stereo or surround.   
---
The game is calibrated to work with a stereo settings. 
---
I know there is more than a few sound issues but this really helped a lot of players (specifically with chase music levels and double sound issues)
---
I'm not defending a bug, it will be fixed. But Moris will remain in the game and will not be touched. It's ironic to bitch about survivors having an advantage for 2 or 3 weeks while Moris that provide HALF a game remain untouched. It's ironic.
---
What constitutes tunneling? I try to keep it fair and avoid obnoxious moves, but if for example I hook someone, barely walk 5 ft away someone pulls off hook, it's practically a free kill if they won't wait a hot minute for me to cross the darn map so might as chop the liver that's there?
---
How I wrote Jigsaw's Baptism doesn't change what BHVR did to her because of Endgame.
---
&gt;I do use another perk, because it's not worth taking the, what, 40 seconds? to heal any time the killer has sloppy butcher. Taking the extra time to self-care is what killers want anyways- one person doing no gens for a period of time

yeah, sloppy butcher actually makes selfcare harmful and useless
---
&gt;Ruin isn't useless in low ranks, it just doesn't slow gens down as much, and survivors are usually better at finding totems at that rank.
---
yeah, and check back, i wrote *nearly* useless
---
I love the  blue ones. üòç
---
Thanks!
---
this was awesome!
---
It's 2 minutes.
---
Spain is Euro so I know it.
---
Most South America countries uses some kind of pesos, even though I admit I don‚Äôt know even half of them, and even less their value.
---
However, as any educated citizen, I know the 5 major currencies (Euro, Dollar, Yen, Yuan, and GBP) and their approximate value.
---
That‚Äôs just general knowledge and culture Not even knowing the GBP, Euro and dollar, and their respective value, is the sign of ignorance.
---
Whether I agree or disagree on this point, it's the cheek that they're calling something that was a feature a "bug" (during their first hotfix announcement) and now an "issue". They already admitted it was an oversight rather than either of these. Easier to justify a change when you pretend like it's a bug. =P
---
This is what I normally do and seems pretty fair to me
---
What's even worse is that I thought it was a tree trunk...
---
It‚Äôs her! It‚Äôs definitely her!!! Omg
---
As a survivor main I *thought* EGC was gonna be cool in some way, but now I have to face bullying if I'm unlucky enough to be the last survivor alive
---
Last day in Cancun currently heading to the airport to go home and I found this gem lol can‚Äôt wait to try out ghostface!
---
well so what should i do then? just stop playing? lol i don't think that's a good answer cuz then how do you break through the barrier of allowing new players into the game. i mean saying that you have to pay to win in the game is essentially making the game a "no boys allowed" type of club game where any new players are at an obvious disadvantage outside of the typical learning curve it takes to handle the base mechanics of the game.
---
Like me for example: i'm new to the game so i don't obviously have a ton of the perks, but i guess i'm good enough to get into higher ranks (like 5-8 with both surv and killer). and now i'm experiencing this whitewashing of perksets that doesn't really feel fun anymore. it's actually quite boring and as i said in the OP, stale.
---
To be honest I'm a bit impressed. The fixes to the things that broke happened pretty quick this time.
---
Do you, by any chance, play with headphones?
---
If yes, you might want to put your settings to stereo, it should fix the low music volume issue.   
---
Please tell me if it works!
---
right? i understand wanting to encourage players to be altruistic,  but repairing generators is the primary objective of the game
---
Yeah, people kept saying it was nerf, never understood this
---
Then that's even less that the survivors have to complain about. The wait for the EGC kill is the exact same amount of time as being on the hook for the full duration.
---
Oh hello, I didn‚Äôt know you visited reddit as well, for me I‚Äôve just been waking my headphones volume as loud as it‚Äôll go,
---
The best is when you start carrying them to the hatch only to drop them a foot away and hit e‚Äôm with a mori lmao
---
[SLEEPY BOIS BACK](/intensifies)
---
r/hydrohomies
---
It originally was when the mark duration was 20 seconds, although when it was intended to be removed when the duration was increased to 45 seconds.
---
&gt;Just because the entity gives survivors tools to give them a chance, doesn't mean it's on their side.
---
i didnt mean their side but it gives them a chance
---
&gt;The killer does have an advantage time-wise, but only if the survivor team isn't pulling their full weight, or if someone is dead/ DCd
---
the killer is always against the clock by survivors doing gens unless the team isnt doing anything so only in low ranks the killer has the advantage
---
Perfecly balance
---
If you fuck up as killer it's not just as easy as die, go back to lobby and get another game in like 30 seconds. It's Fuck up for about 10 minutes waiting 3 minutes for the survivors to stop butt dancing, get angry comments about no skill, or baby killer, and then wait 30 minutes to do it all over again
---
His robes are loud indeed
---
#otp
---
There is a lot of stuff less useful than that you know by heart (or I hope so at least)
---
And this is just basic knowledge of the world. Not knowing the main currencies and their values is a sign of general ignorance, financial illiteracy, and a self-centered mind.
---
That doesn't change the fact that it's still toxic. Also t-bagging to get the killers attention only works on inexperienced killers, you can tell when they're trying to bait you away. Hell it's blatantly obvious if they t-bag.
---
plague is fun if you hate survivors healing, billy is weird to control and play
---
Play more matches &amp; get an Iridescent Emblem every match
---
The earliest to get 9,000 shards is going from Level 1 to Level 46 and having 110 shards leftover (assuming you haven't spent any during the entire time)
---
Personally plague is pretty boring
---
When you are playing Killer seconds matter.
---
THEN JUST INGNORE THEM AND MOVE ON, THEYRE JUST WASTING THEIR TIME. Geez i cant take this anymore
---
GOD DAMN I CANT FIND QUICK MATCHES AS KILLER, I ALWAYS HAVE TO WAIT LIKE, 16 MINUTES TO GET INTO A GAME
---
I suppose I see your point.
---
how is that bm? you wanted him to trade himself for that teammate? bc odds are if he had healed that guy you would've rushed back and either he or his teammate would have gone down
---
Dang that‚Äôs op. And how exactly do you activate the wake up perk? Because it might‚Äôve been happening to me. People have been doing stuff too fast
---
I've settled into playing doctor and using overcharge to try and compensate because I haven't leveled the hag yet, but I probably should. It helps but only so much, survivors know to just run over and trigger the trap early.
---
so what? he still irrelevant in red ranks
---
Most of the time it's not because your fucking up it's because survivors are getting gens done in like a minute. most chases last 2 minutes. Thats 2 gens done to get one survivor. then survivors are like WhY ARe OnLy BiLlY anD NurSe used in every game. One does chases the other stops gens. Very other killer has to struggle in high ranks.
---
Dedicated servers couldn‚Äôt come soon enough, quitters are a blight on this game
---
3+ minutes and you haven't looked behind you ...
---
i dunno, since end game collapse i find wake up and hope useful lol.
---
Aww I play on PS4 :(
---
And? He still viable to play as in purple and less ranks. You won't see too much killers in red ranks until ruin isn't a "have or lose" perk
---
I strongly disagree with this image, for the sole reason that wake up is going to heaven 
---
It can burn in Hell
---
Hulk dab
---
As all things should be. Until they probably revert the leaning buff because people whined about it being too fast which will hopefully not happen.
---
Every fucking time
---
Operation health never really did much
---
I‚Äôll elaborate, he‚Äôs been broken out and regained his shroud multiple times during this chase, takes about 2 seconds of a learn stalk to rebuild the marked meter.
---
Get Hag for the Ruin Perk because it's pretty essential to killer builds, tho if you want to hope for the shrine, Spirit is the better and more fun killer, and her perks while not vital are good
---
When you go up against an obvious SWF where one guy is a TurboL00p3R-3000 and the other one is a Meg who sprint bursts into a wall every time she hears the terror radius, it's hard not to feel sympathy. We all started there at one point. There's no sport in killing a baby Meg. I don't know what it is, but I feel like the baby Megs and Dwights just look the most innocent and helpless.
---
Well seems more like you looking for an excuse to complain ,which is completly understandable, but maybe make your own post and dont try to hijack a simple shit post about lobby wait times because you subscribe to the awfull us vs them mentality
---
I would prefer it if when I‚Äôm the last person alive and I‚Äôm downed, just let the timer go normal speed so I don‚Äôt have to wait twice as long. 
---
In the meantime I try not to give them satisfaction by crawling and playing their game. 
---
You can generally tell if they are letting you escape or be a dick, and if that looks like the case then I‚Äôll go make a drink or something.
---
Let's hope not, also people already got full of GF, didn't saw any today yet, I saw a fucking doctor and a clown, but any GF
---
All you needed to do was put in on. It was bugged so it immediately provided 15% increased action speed to everything. You had to do absolutely nothing to activate it.
---
I've been seeing a lot of (possibly justified) disapproval of the dev's recent patches and rate of fixes, so I'm super happy to see that this update is being received well and looks good! Thanks guys!
---
You can just go into notepad and change a 0 to a 1, and boom! Game mode completesies. Same thing with zombo points and everything else
---
WHY DID PEOPLE GET BANNED FOR USING DOUBLE BLADE ADDONS BUT NOT FOR WAKE UP?
---
This, does put a tear in my face
---
Yeah this game made me set my messages to friends only lol
---
Yup lol
---
People complained it was to loud during chases and prevented them from hearing other things, personally I didn‚Äôt have this issue,
---
The issue I have now is the music is the same volume no matter what so I can no longer pinpoint killer proximity.
---
Still feels bad bc i tried on my p3 character lol
---
You're talking about me ... wtf?
---
I think it's all about the need to survive and gens is how I escape.   The games where I leave the gens alone and take the killer on a chase are always more fun but I keep thinking ... just. One. More. Gen.
---
yeah i feel you on that. i do think it's a little silly to verse say a pig for example that runs 4 teachables from other characters. why then would anyone play pig at all? and extrapolating that, maybe that's the reason you rarely see a pig in a match. her innate abilities don't give her enough reason to play her over someone like billy or nurse.
---
Where the hell are you finding these Quentin.
---
I don't know if it's just Xbox but I've only found two Quintens this year and I'm pretty sure it was the same person
---
Hope this helps:
---

---
It was very useful for me. When I ran Head-On I would get like 90+% of my attempts thanks to that video.
---
I'm the kind of Friendly Neighbourhood Horror Killer that will never be able to remember who'd be on their 2nd, and who'd be on their 3rd hook.
---
But I've not accidentally killed anyone yet. I usually don't get all 8 hooks in a friendly game because I'm not sure enough...
---
I noticed this too and it's a little strange. Unless it is correct and the art is just every bit of the cloak thingy flying up in the air.
---
Nah
---
&gt;either everyone should have that disadvantage or no one should have an advantage
---
Look, if you don‚Äôt want to buy dlc, don‚Äôt, just keep in mind you won‚Äôt get the perks and characters. Restricting perks to the killer it comes from is a *horrible* idea. You say sharing perks makes the game stale, but it‚Äôd be terrible for killers to not be able to make their own builds, and instead be stuck with the same three perks.
---
I havent even looked at the shrine
---
Yeah, played a match now and indeed almost nothing, but it's nice that GF still viable tho
---
Yeah I'm actually really interested now
---
Not worth running.
---
r/wholesomecomments
---
Calling it an issue doesn't mean it's a bug. It could also be used for an oversight which, like you said, it was.
---
That's weird cause usually her hatchets have the hitbox of a freight train with 180¬∞ Matrix abilities and curvature.....
---
I wouldn't count it as buffing him as they nerfed him also. He is kinda the same besides being a little weaker in the open.
---
&gt; the 3 best killers are all free
---
this should really be read as the 3 killers that can use a specific perk set most effectively.
---
and yeah you're right i just need to be patient. kind of feels bad to be at a disadvantage though in the meantime. basically just being punished for not paying money idk feels weird.
---
In that case we agree, but this was still hijacking a shit post with an axtual serious reply about gameplay
---
nah
---
I'm saying stop complaining, because the only person holding you back is you.
---
If you're new, I would say you have less of a leg to stand on in regards to complaining, because there are mechanics to this game that you have yet to understand.
---
remove the grind or remove the perk?
---
Distortion.
---
What's worse is when you're farming as killer and someone voluntarily kills themselves on the hook.
---
I'm all "Okay, the rest of you.....calm down. That *wasn't me*!"
---
&gt;lol the 3 best killers are all 
---
Two best killers are free.  Third is Spirit. She's not free.
---
They tend to take some "artistic freedoms" with these banners. They are never entirely accurate, and most of the time have details the actual cosmetics do not. (For example, I was disappointed when Clown's new cosmetic did not have hands anything close to what they were on the Disparate Arts banner.)
---
I only give them the hatch when their teammates were shit or they gave a fun game.
---
I've had a couple instances of Decisive Strike not working even though I nailed the skillcheck. 
---
Other people have mentioned this intermittently as well, so I'm fairly sure this one has been around a long time.
---
‚ÄúFixed an issue that caused a delayed reset on the users progress bar when failing a skill check.‚Äù Does this mean that you can keep working on gens after failing a skill check instead of getting off it for 2 seconds? Will the progress continue immediately after the skillcheck?
---
Ahahah true..
---
Maybe later today, they almost always drop on Wednesday‚Äôs
---
Dam! Haunted grounds was never on the shrine, it must be really good! Left behind and vigil were only on the shrine once, so theyre even better! Pop goes the weasel, surveillance and stake out must be really popular too!
---
Perks like hex:ruin though, are really bad perk. Because theyve been on the shrine so much.
---
Obvious correlation. Cant be anything else. Its OBVIOUSLY rigged

There's a difference between not needing to know something vs not wanting to know something. Ignorance would be me choosing to not want to learn things and ignoring it. I just don't need to know it because I'm not gonna be using that information any time soon or at all. Also not knowing a currency is most likely not a sign of a self centered mindset. 
---
&gt;There is a lot of stuff less useful than that you know by heart
---
Useful is subjective, therefore useful to you is not useful to me. Knowing euro or other world currency is pretty useless to me while knowing tricks in a game is more useful to me but not so much to you.
---
And what would you do with that extra 5 seconds you save?
---
They referred to it as a bug fix in a previous post, then in the same sentence noted it wasn't a bug. :S
---
Wait wait wait wait they didn't NEEF him? They compensated by giving him other buffs? MY FAITH IS RESTORED! AND THEY FIXED WAKE UP!
---
Can confirm, I've had this happen to me and was able to reliably reproduce it.
---
That sounds like a question for the Devs since they implemented an entire feature allowing you to select entire outfits. I'm just asking them to use it on base outfits.
---
This was glorious. Always love seeing your work.
---
Then don't dress as all default dwights you dinguses
---
Been happening to me too, ive just been giving up and letting myself die so i can get to a game that isnt bugged
---
then i guess take it as a commentary on how newer players feel trying to get into this game. i love the theme of the game, and the mechanics are extremely, *extremely* unique. i love that about this game. but trying to convince my friends who have never played to come join me in a really fun and thrilling game and having them get stomped to the point of uninstalling is not necessarily fun. and then they ask "how can i get better?" the answer, as most people have stated is "well you have to buy the right perks in order to counter the current meta perks that the killer or surv also had to buy"
---
you know what i'm saying? it's just...idk off.
---
Nothing specifically about the fucked audio where all you hear are sound effects. Awesome
---
It‚Äôs definitely a question for you, Mr. Time Management guy
---
I know, but I‚Äôm just telling you. You‚Äôre coming up with a concept and writing a lot that basically just says ‚Äúrevert the pig‚Äù and that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre wanting a change for her that‚Äôs literally the same as before but you‚Äôre claiming it as new as well as wanting a nerf on an already bad perk
---
I'm not trying to be rude but to you stated that you just picked up the game. Put in a couple hundred hours and then come back with an opinion on how you feel about it after that time. Balancing around new players opinions usually doesn't turn out too hot. Ask Freddy.
---
No not really. They‚Äôre good killers because they have insane map pressure/anti looping
---
You‚Äôre not being punished for not paying money. Ruin is a Hag perk, and she can be bought with shards, and BBQ is a Bubba perk, and he‚Äôs only like $4.80
---
What did they change?
---
Happened in a monto video. It was weird.
---
They just made the area of detection slightly bigger so that it doesn't feel as inconsistent as before. Plus they nerfed some stalking add-ons so you can potentially beat him to a detection
---
Christ's sake, it's not even a nerf. 8% larger detection circle just makes the reveal technology *work properly* so you can't "backrev" someone with it.
---
Poor Host Face.
---
Bitch I have an Xbox lmao, if you buy an Xbox I‚Äôll be glad to.  The fact you‚Äôre getting this worked up proves you‚Äôre a shit killer. I‚Äôm a killer main btw Billy/Huntress main.
---
MAYBE BECAUSE SOME OF US USED WAKE UP! BEFORE IT GOT BUGGED?
---
I think they once thought I was farming, while I wasnt. ended up killing them all on their first hook
---
Happened to me a couple times before the hotfix, restarting seemed to fix it, couldn‚Äôt see hooks either.
---
WHY DID YOU GET DROPPED NEAR THE BASEMENT? THEN PROCEED TO DC THE MOMENT YOU HIT THE GROUND FOR A SECOND TIME? WE JUST UNHOOKED YOU AND I HAD A NEEDLE WITH YOUR NAME ON IT! I THEN SPENT THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS DODGING AXES AND FUMBLING TO PICK MY MEDKIT BACK UP BC I SWAPPED IT WITH YOUR SHITTY  CORPSE TOOLBOX TRYING TO HEAL YOU!
---
#how could they fix this easily exploitable perk!!!!
---
HELLO! I AM A STEALTHY KILLER! YOU CANNOT HEAR ME
---
I mean... euro is the currency of most of Europe (makes sense), so if you ever plan to go to Europe, that‚Äôs something to know. If you never plan to go to Europe, it‚Äôs either because you financially can‚Äôt, and in this case I‚Äôm truly sorry, or because you are pretty USA-centered.
---
The 3 main currencies worldwide are basic common knowledge, and most middle-schooler where I live know them and their approximate value, even if this is never taught in school. Again, I am not asking to know the currency of some obscure country, but at least the most important one. And they are useful to everyone, as you have to know them and their approximate value to be financially literate, and understand better the global economic system and its tendencies. This knowledge is useful to absolutely everyone living in developed countries, to plan for retirement smartly and investments for example. But yeah continue not to know the basics of global economy, it makes my job much easier.
---
No, he just takes loads of proper gamesense to use it red ranks. **ALL** M1 Killers are viable in red ranks if you know the game. It's not a match of "Oh, I know how to use my hard-to-use power, so I win", it's a match of "Oh, I know Survivor pathing, chase mindgames, and pressure, so I win".
---
Is it easy? No. But that's the point. If you see a good Pig, Ghostface, or Wraith in red ranks, you'll respect every single kill that person gets: They fucking earned it.
---
Territorial Imperative on Shrine? That's new and fresh! Kappa

I play solo random and self care has saved me so many times on my way out the door.
---
If I played more SWF I'd totally go with something other than self care but I don't so there's that.
---
BVHR keeps getting better and better...in a roundabout way.
---
"Three of the top four"?
---
Wow. This post is amazingly positive.
---
*You sure you're in the right place?*
---
I kid. I kid. Good job!
---
They did
---
fair enough.
---
fwiw i recently played freddy at rank 5 and stomped (4k) with no perks (sliver); so there's that.
---
Just slow down the game by making generators take more time to make.
---
Perfect, ran into it more than a few times and it sucked so bad
---
I‚Äôm playing on Xbox they just put out a patch that fixes it
---
I spray it when I make a pellet, dodge a hit, etc, and when the killer leaves me. It's super toxic, but the killer doesn't know.
---
He's not the same. They nerfed his stalking ability out in the open in exchange for increasing his stealth.
---
I mean Ace is the lucky guy. What did you expect?
---
They exist, but now is a bad time because everyone is grinding
---
You mean camp?
---
Basically removed refilling the exposed meter, made him 8% easier to spot, removed him being loud but his clothes still make noise and  adjusted his Add-ons making it only effect stalking while not leaning instead of leaning.
---
bubba is not even considered to be a good killer. so really i wouldn't be paying 5 bucks for a new killer. I'd be paying 5 bucks for the one perk. sounds like highway robbery to me.
---
And everyone who abused Wake Up will get away Scott free. Thanks for listening too the community devs.
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused the Survivors' camera to shake when hit by the Killers. 
---
Y u do dis?
---
I thought that effect was cool as fuck.
---
Well, it's also worth noting the 2nd time BBQ ever appeared on the Shrine was after they made a highly controversial change (The Legion ~~gutting~~ "rework".) It might've been a stroke of pure luck, but let's be honest, it was probably just to calm people down a bit.
---
Maybe I missed it, but I don't see a fox for the exit gate bug or the blocked for healing/recovering/dead hard/wiggling bug I and others have been experiencing on ps4.
---
He is definitely the same though atleast the way I play him because I never stalked in the open or used it in chases and used it as a stealth ability.
---
An ulcer and spontaneous spurts of rage?
---
LOL, I knew I was not the only one seeing her in those cans!
---
Then it's not a nerf
---
are you not supposed to censor the names
---
Can confirm, this was me last night as Myers. Dude could've left through the exit gate because it was open. He decided to go back for his last team mate. Downed him, tried taking him to basement because there were no other hooks available but he got out. Literally made it to his hooked team mate but I was in EW III so I lunged around the wall and got him before that could happen.
---
In the end, I brought him to the basement but stopped at the last second and took him to hatch. He honestly deserved it for being a good survivor and a good team mate to that hooked dude.
---
This actually was scary at first and then turned so fucking hilarious. Well done.
---
It technically is though because he is 8% easier to spot and removed the ability to refill the Exposed y
---
The eldritch cabbage harvest looks bountiful this year.
---
No one talks about the devour hope bug and it didn't say they fixed it in this most recent patch...
---
Still no new cosmetics? OKAY I CAN WAIT
---
A looped a Huntress for 5 gens at the cow loop once WITHOUT using the pallet. When the gens got done, someone cleansed her NOED while she was still chasing me around it so she DC'd. It shocks me how bad some people are at this game.
---
That's kinda toxic. Just Mori them when you down them.
---
Yea my bad
---
Got to love BHVR and their spaghetti coding
---
WHY DO I HAVE TO WAIT 10 MINUTES AS KILLER JUST TO BE GIVEN A LOBBY TO THEN JUST WAIT IN THERE FOR SURVIVORS!
---
When are they going to fix the camera when picking up a trap?
---
yeah i mean in my opinion if you see a character using exactly zero of the perks that were actually designed for said character, that's a pretty glaring red flag that the initial design for the character is actually just lacking in comparison to other "newer models" per se.
---
If you think I didn‚Äôt get the point of this post then idk what to tell you. I‚Äôm just fucking with you at this point since it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre insecure insignificant. Like you‚Äôre the one talking about implementing a feature to save less than 5 seconds so who‚Äôs really nitpicky about time? Come on man learn to tell when someone is fucking with you and life will be easier. Get off reddit and go make some friends so you can tell when someone is busting your balls
---
That sounds like a fun little challenge to do for fun. Adds another another objective into games.
---
Tbh I‚Äôm not even living in the country try I was raised in so yeah travel is a part of life for me, (and I have been several time in the US, looking forward to have an opportunity to live there lol, really liked it) I have a hard time understand why people would not want to, but it‚Äôs true people are different and have different goals and motives.
---
Do what makes you happy, and if one day you want to travel, I hope you‚Äôll do it, because it has been life-changing for me.
---
Farewell bud
---
&gt;can‚Äôt camp or tunnel you if you don‚Äôt get caught
---
This isn‚Äôt a valid point. Survivors will get downed unless the killer is braindead or the survivor is really good.
---
There ya go, now your stupid ass suggestion post actually has some activity on it. You‚Äôre welcome
---
Everytime I get that daily, I get a stream of god-tier killers that stomps us at 5 gens, I swear it's cursed
---
It doesn‚Äôt and the sounds have been jacked since the 3.0.0. Patch and I‚Äôm using a $150 set of headphones. Before the patch I could hear a pin drop and now I‚Äôve had allot of jump scares, scratched mirror Michael can get the jump on me now and before I could get out of dodge before he was able to snag me off a gen.
---
So its based on map pressure. Got it.

---
He doesnt sound like hes rubbing his gimp suit against a mic anymore? FINALLY.
---
Yeah but everyone talking about how wake up desperately needed a change when imo pwyf was way worse. Movement speed in 10x more important than action speed.
---
I never really regret hooking anyone unless it is the second to last person and allows for someone to get the hatch. Tbh, I‚Äôm kind of glad that they don‚Äôt encourage the ‚Äúnice‚Äù killer. Aside from the fact that it would become even more common for people to use that as an excuse to basically farm, it would kind of ruin the game. I understand and appreciate when a killer does something meaning to be nice, but for me it kind of ruins the immersion of getting chased by Michael Myers or some other horror icon when they do something that entirely out of character. Plus I like to win because I earned it, not because someone let me. 
---
The only exception where I can‚Äôt help but root for the survivor is when they risked everything to pull off, or even just attempt, an epic, but also not dumb save. Gotta respect the ones who basically risk a certain win to pull off an almost impossible save lol
---
But the spirit doesn't really have map pressure, unless you're running recovery add-ons.
---
Theres also a bug with sprint burst as well. If you run after crouching you wont use sprint burst and will be able to save it for later. Falling and sprinting after walking will still use it.
---
Some people think survivors can‚Äôt lag switch but it‚Äôs definitely possible. Just report it.
---
My Minecraft crops are growing!
---
Look the fucking point I was trying to make was that t-bagging with the intention of taunting is toxic, and that I could understand how that could make killers angry. That was the only fucking point. And other than that one example I was talking in general not myself. I wasn't even going to comment because I had a feeling I would get this kind of reaction but fuck it, I'm done.
---
Yeah sometimes you 4k with no perks and sometimes you get 1 total hook with the best perks in the game. Every match is different.
---
This is my 2nd account just to answer.
---
Dude. Stop being such a fucking bitch. You block everyone in this subreddit who has a different opinion and call them biased for thinking something else everytime they dont agree with you. Youre honestly a fucking baby. Stop being a bitch. You honestly piss me off in this subreddit. You fucking hypocrite "oh, he doesnt agree with my killer sided opinions? He must be survivor biased because i can never be wrong" this is how you act im this entire subreddit.
---
Youre the biased guy here. Not me.
---
The only way to get them is to play. You get increasing numbers of shards as you level and eventually you‚Äôll get 300 shards for every player level.  Do your best to get iridescent or gold emblems and play a killer and survivor match everyday for the daily bonus and that will help but there is no quicker way.
---
Putting your headphones to stereo does not work! Before the 3.0.0. Patch everything sounded great, since then it‚Äôs been horrible. Running the Arca Steele series 7 headset, I could hear a pin drop and dodge a scratched mirror Michael before the 3.0.0. Patch
---
I guess since they removed the shroud noise they had to add something. Wraith and freddy have loudass footsteps too.
---
Yeah I closed it down and 3rd time was the charm, had to dip first two games kind of impossible to play with no gens showing
---
You just have to keep playing. Its basically "playtime money". More you play, more money you get.
---
Assuming you play every day for atleast 2 hours, it roughly translates to 10k shards. May differ depending on devotion level and play time. Hope this was helpful.
---
Ok thank chu friend
---
End game heals is really where self care totally owns Bond. So yes in some cases self heal will allow an escape, effectively giving you 1 more pip.
---
But then, bond just gives me so many more pip in the other categories.
---
Sorry OP, iridescent shards can only be rewarded through playing matches and leveling up your devotion at the end of the match. The amount you get per level up increases the higher level you are. Hope this helps
---
T-bagging is rude. Tunneling just makes the game boring. There's no skill involved on either side. It's not like the injured survivor who just got off the hook can do anything about it. It's just like ... ahh ... guess I'll sit here and continue to not play the game for another hook state. It's not exactly thrilling gameplay for the killer either. Guess I'll just walk up and m1 this guy.  
---
This is why the meta is borrowed time and DS. The fact that both anti-tunneling perks are meta at the same time should tell you something about the state of the game. Maybe they just need an anti T-bagging perk for killers. If a survivor crouches and un-crouches 3 times within 3 seconds they become exposed.
---
Good outlet to fill my violent tendecies.
---
it'd be super cool to vault through windows tbh
---
Killer audio busted now. BibleThump
---
OMG Buddy, I've been in the DbD Sub long enough to know that people love starting arguments. I literally just pointed that out and then you follow up with, "You don't know when someone is busting your balls" and "get some friends". 
---
You clearly are extremely simple because you haven't understand a single thing I've said so far. You can't keep up, fuck off.
---
I hate running ruin but I know I have to... Survivors should just have other objectices, Hallowed Blight prooved that
---
It does and try it sometime and I will burn a coin, sometimes I can get 2 green med kits with add ons

---
He'd get annihilated, it's a 5 second stalk timer and people could just wait until it's over and just quick peek him. That would mean more generator progress against a killer who's already weak at defending gens.
---
Not the devs job to baby sit our behaviour. The community is toxic because thats what comes with hiding behind a screen.
---
Think about it; grammatically, even. While a Survivor is still in the process of revealing him, he is not yet revealed.
---
Why wouldn't he be able to stalk when he's not even revealed yet?
---
I'd argue that emblem actually makes this whole "play your own way" not that viable anymore. before emblems, some players really like to be the "attention whore" and run the killer around, some other liked to gen rush, etc. With emblem system you kinda have to do a bit of all of these, you can't just focus on a single task anymore and ignore the other things.
---
Are you on xbox? Spark of madness is free.
---
It was only for a week, I could see if it was a month or longer like the Legion exploit. It didn‚Äôt impact the game that much, hell on PS4 I only seen 3 people out of the 100 plus games I played using it. Now on PC and Xbox I couldn‚Äôt tell you.
---
There‚Äôs no negative consequences to doing shitty things so people will continue to do shitty things, I‚Äôm not protesting or saying anything except that...?
---
Lol never said I enjoy or want to farm.  But your post is a who's who of the most rank 20 playstyle ever.  Camping, tunneling, noed and moris lol.  Because if you don't do that stuff it's farming? Lol.  Really stupid meme
---
I ran Bond for months and months and loved it. Recently though, I've wanted more out of the perk slots. The thing is, Bond doesn't actually increase the speed of anything, it just lets you see allies, which isn't THAT great when you think about it. Yes, you get to find allies to heal you, but you've still got to find them and run 'em to them, that's a few seconds added if not a bunch added. So, that's where people like to use self-care. 
---
Nonetheless, I decided to remove it for We'll Make It. Being able to get allies back into the action faster is more my playstyle. Plus, I love to act the healer in video games. 
---
An added bonus, I get to nullify people's Self Care xD
---
I always get Doctor on this map and my team is doing all the gens at the bottom of this map :) FeelsBadMan
---
Why dislike it as survivor?  It's easily one of the strongest survivor maps in the game.
---
That would be a funny perk
---
It would be called "Toxin"
---
I hate it as killer, due to all the balanced landing infinite‚Äôs, and I hate it as survivor because I can never find the damn totem.
---
&gt; the requirements to pip are whack though, can't wait until that whole system gets reworked. escaping should guarantee you a pip since it's basically the entire point of the game.
---
Oh you are more than right about this. Current system is complete bonkers. I used to not really know how it works and i would often safety pip after escaping even tho i actually did a really good job (did 3+ gens by myself). But since i didn't spend much time "helping others" or being around the killer it did not work.
---
But you can play in a totally silly useless way and be sure to pip up.
---
And as killer, i sometimes safety pip when i dominate the survivors too hard which is so stupid lol
---
There is no accident....only Zuel.
---
Ruin is disproportionately good against lower rank survivors. Newer players actually just can't win if there is a Ruin, but once you get to high rank many survivors will just ignore ruin and pop gens every 80 seconds anyways. The devs mentioned adding new objective stuff to do in the game, so maybe once they get around to doing that we will see some changes to Ruin.
---
&gt;  Yes, you get to find allies to heal you, but you've still got to find them and run 'em to them, that's a few seconds added if not a bunch added. So, that's where people like to use self-care.
---
On average the time it takes to find them isn't comparable to how long self care takes. And that isn't the only benefit of bond as stated in the OP :P
---
You don't need to be really good, you just need a good understanding of how the game works. There's multiple ways not to get caught, especially to not be the first one to get caught. There's even perks designed to help you lose the killer IN a chase.
---
With pleasure! SB is my favorite Exhaustion Perk thanks to it. Dunno if it‚Äôs a bug or an intended feature, but this is indeed very useful.
---
Thank you, I feel like it's considerd hatespeech in this subreddit to say that maybe just maybe teabagging isn't as bad as camping or genrushing isn't as bad as tunneling, but someone has to speak truth around here.
---
If you understood me we would still be talking. Go away.
---
The main problem with that is probably how the game has developed over time and how the "vision" the devs had for said killer doesn't match the game plays out (What else is new, right?). Like like for example Pig, she's a stealth killer who has let's be honest two kinda campy perks that lend into her stealthy ways: Make Your Choice and Surveillance (Disregarding the fact that Surveillance was fucking USELESS when it first was introduced).
---
Both of these require some form of camping/patrolling that she struggles with due to her not having movement abilities and her stealth to sneak up taking much longer to eventually get a hit. 
---
Make Your Choice requires you to get away from the hook and honestly wait until the survivor is unhooked and then go after the unhooker, but if we think about how this happens in a game, you're normally already in a chase with another because you've probably got BBQ!
---
Surveillance is now more useful but when we think of how we'd have to track it, we'd have to literally keep checking that gen for the aura change because you don't get a notification for when it changes like Discordance, which honestly removes a lot of your checking and spotting for survivors and is an overall hinderance especially on Pig because you can't get there fast enough to capitalise on it.
---
Thematically in relation to her lore and who she is, they're perfect, in game on her? Pretty useless in relation to other perks you'd use on her and how the game plays out as her. 
---
Just really kinda shitty to basically know the devs don't play the game properly tbh.
---
On PC some people get entire teams with it, and some games you‚Äôll get 0-1. I usually have 1-2 in most games. And this bug really screws over killers, even Nurse. And besides, a game breaking bug should of been announced and then you punish those who abuse it.
---
Lmao of course
---
it still called a shitpost don't know where you are getting at.
---
maybe try a hard reset which clears system cache
---
To bounce off of this- I tend to have gory intrusive thoughts and seek out gore when my moods drop. BdB offers an outlet that isn‚Äôt destructive and also gives me some yummy brain chemicals I lack in return. It‚Äôs made it so I can go about my days easier and happier. I‚Äôve been a lot more productive taking breaks to play between cleaning!
---
I love that map as a survivor...
---
You know what map sucks ?? Sheletered woods.. hands down worse map.. so many dead zones. 6 pallets..
---
Used to happen to me too, until I got a 7200 RPM HDD. Id look into that if freezes also happen in other games
---
You should also stop playing Clown because his tonic ability is bugged and will muffle the audio of survivors to the point they can't hear anything.
---
You should also stop running Dying Light because it currently affects every action speed and essentially makes survivors permanently slow vault and be unable to leave the game.
---
You should also stop running Devour Hope because the exposed status effect is bugged and won't show up for certain survivors, leaving them at an unfair disadvantage.
---
You should also stop playing Huntress because she won't lost bloodlust currently after throwing a hatchet and that provides her an unfair advantage.
---
Also, Ghostface IS bugged. There are some times where it is easy to break him out, but more often than not, you can staring dead center at him and nothing happens.
---
There is so much stuff bugged in this game currently, at what point do you really think you can just go off and tell people who have been using certain perks in certain builds before the update even came out "stop using that, you're a horrible person".
---
Spirit has map pressure, Trapper doesn't... ok chief
---
Thank you for the information
---
You really don‚Äôt get sarcasm do you? Or when someone is trolling you? I really didn‚Äôt wanna get this deep into it but damn man, you are low hanging fruit and this farmers hungry.
---
Holy shit, literally a millisecond left. Good shit my dude.
---
I dislike it because of how bullshit it is LOL
---
If you have balanced landing you can't lose. People burn an offering for it constantly and everyone has balanced landing. It's one of the strongest but I know how stressful it can be on Killer side so I hate it on survivor side just as much.
---
If a Killer ever ragequits for me, I notice a lot of the time it's on Haddonfield. I think that really says something.
---
really? DBD is barely gorey, imo. id rather use games like GTA for my violent thoughts
---
Go away.
---
*Releasing one of many already completed skins today*
---
BHVR: i sleep
---
*waiting an extra week for no goddamn reason*
---
BHVR: real shit
---
... this is the most important bug and they did not fix it oh man .. i have been getting a lot ...
---
It's a basic list of common things some survivors have complained about the past two weeks on the subreddit.  I'm sorry you didn't understand that by glimpsing the title.
---
Ask nicer
---
well camping and tunneling while facing a good team of survivors does punish the killer, even if they do end with a 1k or 2k in the end, chances are their chaser emblem is shit and they will get an awful amount of bloodpoints.
---
Not sure how looping is toxic, since that's primarily how the survivor well survives against a killer. While annoying bodyblocking is a form of teamwork in helping other survivors.
---
If 1 side is winning by a wide margin, the losing side will most likely not feel as good, after all this is a PvP game, so there will be winners and losers in a match. If you had 5 players who always got max bloodpoints and double pipped then there wouldn't be much point to playing to win is there?
---
Have you ever played Ghostface? And I don‚Äôt mean play him for 2 trials. Like actually give him an honest shot. Because it sounds like you have only played against him.
---
Your suggestion doesn‚Äôt make anything ‚Äúmore rounded‚Äù, it would be a monumental nerf to him. I kind of feel like a GF just killed you, for the reasons you listed, and you decided to make this post. My thoughts are this is a terrible suggestion and I feel like you should play him to see how shitty the mechanics actually are.
---
Hahah thats a nice lie. You only play killer and maybe 10% survivor. Look at your comment history lmao. Only killer sided shit.
---
As one of the first maps made for the game it's understandable why it sucks. It has the least amount of uniqueness to it too among most of the maps. All it has that's unique is that tree in the middle that you can still walk halfway up.
---
That map definitely needs a facelift.
---
What is HG?
---
Opinion noted... I did get killed by a GF but specifically stated that I don't think he's OP and it was a genuine question not a outcry for a nerf
---
I'm blocking you now.
---
&gt; just end the flipping game already
---
If I had a dime for every time the gates open and survivors hang out at the exit teabagging i'd be a fookin billionaire
---
Sony are responsible for wallet refunds, not BHVR
---
I can tell you‚Äôre new to the game... so please don‚Äôt complain about things when you aren‚Äôt even familiar with the perks in the game:)
---
Understood and upvoted lol.  That is a good response to why a survivor would hate that map.
---
Not at all you dont owe survivors anything, they just feel entitled to it
---
So you are right, but if you want any chances of devs reading your post you need to summarize this a bit. Let me do that:
---
Completing emblems properly usually also means not completing your real objective properly. A survivor that focus on doing his emblem objectives will often end up not playing optimally, effectively reducing the chances of his team escaping. Same thing can be said for the killer. This results in a silly play style for both sides which isn't really fun. Imo, here is how i would do it:
---
* No survivors escape the trial: Killer 2 pips, all survivors lose 2 pips.
---
* A single survivor escapes the trial: Killer 1 pips, all survivors lose 1 pip.
---
* 2 survivors escapes the trial: Everyone safety pips.
---
* 3 survivors escapes the trial: Killer depips, all survivors wins 1 pip (including the camped survivor ;)).
---
* 4 survivors escapes the trial: Killer loses 2 pips, all survivors wins 2 pips.
---
And then people just play the way they want to.
---
yes! red rank pigs make my heart skip a beat.  psychoscorpionz is the man. his pig is LETHAL.
---
Entitled enough to downvote me into oblivion.
---
The devs should make Killer and Survivors base cosmetics into selectable outfits now that the system is in place.
---
Pretty sure he saw you, believe it or not some killers just wanna have fun and aren't concerned with the fastest possible win.  I play killer and sometimes just torment survivor and chase them, purposely missing, never downing any of them all match, letting them get every point possible.  Just a way to have fun in a game that can get repetitious
---
only on ps4
---
It's almost as if they posted these changes over a week ago and people just jumped to conclusions for no reason **cough** Tru3talent **cough** Noob3 **cough**
---
Is any killer other than the nurse really in charge of the game? lol
---
I out that as the body just because I need to out something there.
---
Oh, didn't know that. Thanks!
---
Idk if it's just me, but on Xbox half of the time I get a skill check the game freezes for a short second and I cant actually hit LB in time.
---
He was being stupid and you got away. Its more him being dumb than toxic.
---
I love how the survivor main playerbase is 
---
&gt;killer does something i dont like
---
&gt;hes toxic
---
Just take your win and let him realize hes dumb
---
I've been getting this every so often, probably every 4 games or so. Haven't found a way to fix it, just letting you know you're not the only one with this problem
---
throwing stealth away is like a main thing to becoming a better player
---
Can anyone tell me what the fuck this even is?
---
If you only want that perk, wait for shrine, but knockout and Franklin‚Äôs demise are good too. And who knows? You could find bubba fun
---
This is nothing like play style.
---
THEN JUST TAKE IT OFF TEMPORARILY
---
Because you can't ban or punish people for being "toxic".
---
Toxic is a subjective term to start of with, what i find toxic another may find normal.
---
But another note is that at the end of the day people are just using intended game mechanics included in the game. Unless they go out of their way to abuse glitches like the Wake up or Legion bugs then theres really not much BHVR can do.
---
I can't remember the full exact name, but I think if you search 'colored galaxy dead by daylight perks' it should show up
---
I'm only green ranks and facing purple pretty regularly, but I can't fucking imagine red ranks. My heart's not healthy enough for red ranks. Not as my StalkyBoi
---
Reply to wrong person?
---
fair enough, dont know how ghostface will face against SWF with OoO
---
I adore horror, especially psychological, so it hit that sweet spot aesthetically speaking. It‚Äôs helped me be less hateful towards myself for enjoying the genre in general; I‚Äôve always felt bad for liking horror and blood and guts, but seeing everyone here enjoy it makes me realize it‚Äôs normal and okay, and I don‚Äôt need to beat myself up over it. DbD was sitting in my steam library for years until I stumbled on a reddit post and remembered it a few weeks ago, so I guess the community overall has been pretty cool even if everyone can get really riled. I don‚Äôt feel that sense of Kinship with GTA that helps me feel okay with it I guess?
---
It is a very bad idea. All of these fun builds you can make would be cancelled because perks are locked in
---
‚ÄúNot letting a dying survivor win makes you a toxic player‚Äù 
---
Hes the killer at that point hes won. He in no way should or or has to let that survivor escape
---
Mission accomplished, boys
---
He probably didn't have ruin either or it broke early. Depending on the killer you play it can be really problematic. If i play clown for example and don't bring ruin it's a miracle if the game lasts longer than 4 minutes.
---
It's tricky because on the one hand i want games to last longer, but on the other hand having to hold M1 for even longer would break my sanity. Survivor gameplay needs a major overhaul to get rid of this problem.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs no negative consequences to doing shitty things so people will continue to do shitty things,
---
What negative things would you propose then?
---
Camping / Tunneling often leads to decreased blood point gains and Survivors who taunt the killer (T-Bag, Flashlight spam etc..) often overstate their own skill and fail hard.
---
Unless you're trying to say the Devs should punish people for this which would be silly.
---
Not because the devs failed do design a good win condition for their game that it can't be done.
---
Lmao facts
---
If you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs OP then why would you suggest a nerf?
---
use Franklins Demise it has a special passive that Survivors that drop their flashlights have a 50% chance to dc on the spot
---
i'm really just saying i'd rather see more variance in my matches is all. i think i'm entitled to that much.
---
I play a lot and agree. But some casual players have a lot harder time with it.
---
The punishments aren‚Äôt really big enough to have any sort of risk. I hate the idea that these are strategies and are acceptable, even though they are. A genuinely good killer, and a genuinely good survivor, don‚Äôt need to do those things to win or have a good game. They‚Äôre cheap tactics that make the game less enjoyable, which is what games should be. Competitive should not equal toxic or mean, yknow? I dunno, that‚Äôs just how I feel. I think dbd would be much more fun if people weren‚Äôt... uh. Well, jerks? I guess? I dunno, wishful thinking, I know.
---
Oh this means they banned you. There was a ban wave for people that used wake up bug or had teammates that abused it.
---
Errrmmm... he could always stalk twice as fast when leaning.
---
what exactly are "all of these fun builds" you speak of? i see the same build every match lol
---
Well... I uh- i'm reporting you for reporting his post for reporting your post!
---
Okay good to know. Thanks!
---
I think lean stalking was always twice as fast, they just stated it again.
---
i've tried him and he seems pretty useless. ofc that was with no perks thanks to the splinter, but his kit seems pretty lacking compared to other options. i'd play pig or freddy over bubba.
---
The only legit form of toxic behaviour that they control really is the post game chat. Which only really effects pc. I which they‚Äôd implement what some other games do where common ‚Äútoxic‚Äù messages are replaced with something that fires back at the sender. Like ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù auto corrects itself to ‚ÄúI really enjoy playing with you‚Äù or something to that effect
---
Should‚Äôve tea bagged...
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that allowed Ghost Face to continue stalking already Marked Survivors.
---
Finally.
---
He's currently arguably a bit weaker than average, that would make him a joke.
---
A Meg that doesn't tbag after pallet????
---
I‚Äôm just saying it should be more than a bloodpoint loss. Because really, it‚Äôs evidently not enough to stop people from doing it. I don‚Äôt have the answers to everything nor can I propose anything, but what I do know is that it‚Äôs pretty fucked that we just have this ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù or ‚Äúget good‚Äù attitude against stuff that isn‚Äôt counterable. You can‚Äôt counter a camper or a tunneler, and god knows you can‚Äôt counter a toxic survivor. 
---
It‚Äôs just a shitty situation. That‚Äôs really all I‚Äôm saying w this.
---
do they ban it for using it in kyf?
---
Tunneling is when you go out of your way to go after a specific survivor, not when someone farms the person on the hook &amp; you strike them down.
---
&gt;I want my piggy skins ;-;
---
Speculations suggests piggy skins won't be here until the end of July.
---
 That sucks. Even teammates? Thank God I'm a killer main
---
*You son of a....*
---
Look here, Capt Reporty Reportington.
---
There's only room for so many reporters, and you ain't one buddy.
---
***REPORTED***
---
Yikes, being a lil' presumptuous there, aren't we.
---
I 50/50 survivor and killer, but points for trying to make the same point a bunch of people have, with about a quarter of the eloquence.
---
dunno
---
im gonna have a stroke if they do
---
Didn‚Äôt Overwatch do that? ^^ I agree. I just wish people were.... Better sports.
---
Sometimes the killer actually forgets that a aurvivor went to the hook twice already.
---
Probably will
---
I hate this as both killer and survivor as a survivor it makes the game incredibly unfun and beyond infuriating it feels like the killer equivalent of tea bagging after a pallet drop and just makes me wanna stop playing survivor for awhile. While as a killer if you do this it‚Äôs pointless you‚Äôve downed enough people at that point if it‚Äôs one survivor you‚Äôve got the blood points for hits and more than likely chases either kill them or let them escape you‚Äôre doing nothing but forcing two people or more to wait for three minutes where the only prize is a ‚Äúlol‚Äù and probably rage in post game chat
---
It‚Äôs so much convenient to blame someone else for their loss than accept the responsibility themselves. This goes for both killer and survivor.
---
Spirit Fury bugged on Hag. 
---
 **This bug I've replicated 4 times. I'm playing on PC. I was running Enduring/ Spirit Fury on Hag. When pallet that activates SF happens, Hag's camera remains at feet, camera doesn't automatically recenter like the camera does running these perks on other killers.**
---
I also 50/50 both sides. He was being stupid, take your win. You dont need to make another ‚ÄúLoOk At THiS tOxiC KiLLeR gUYs‚Äù post
---
No it does not, quite a few people are having this problem on Xbox. Don't make up rumors.
---
I‚Äôll rephrase it most survivor perks have a downside or conditions to make it work
---
This is a killer mains sub. They don't care about bugs that negatively effect survivors.
---
YOU ARE ALL POTATOES.  
---
I SAVED ALL THREE OF MY TEAMMATES LAST NIGHT AND THEN PROCEEDED TO GET ONE HOOKED DEAD (NOT BASEMENT) WHILE EVERYONE CROUCHED AROUND IN THE MIDDLE DISTANCE NOT POLISHING OFF THE LAST GEN OR UNHOOKING ME WHILE KILLER PROXIMITY CAMPED AT A DECENTLY RESPECTABLE DISTANCE.  FUCK THIS COMMUNITY AND FUCK YOU TOO.
---
I won‚Äôt even be able to play dbd at the end of July ;-;
---
And you didn't need to make a comment repeating what others have said, with about a quarter of the eloquence. 
---
Judging by the upvotes, I guess the difference is people actually liked what I uploaded ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
IMHO it **should** work that way. If you have all stacks of it you're done playing with your food, now it's killing time. And by downing the obsession, you are ending the chase with it, there's no denying that. You're ending the chase and use a stack by hitting. So you lose a stack by hitting and gain a stack by effectively ending the chase. IMO not much wrong with that.
---
Of course every killer would run that ‚Äúpassive‚Äù so you might as well suggest they remove great skill checks &amp; ruin as wellü§î
---
I play on PS4 and the chase music when I play killer seems super loud now. I liked it better low. I could track survivors better. Playing console Nurse I need all the help I can get.
---
It's actually one of the best maps IMO.
---
I guess i'm just burned out from all the flat land with little to no height difference (i also like the game map).
---
When i play killer it depends. As huntress i don't mind it at all, nurse, trapper and hag also have no problem,  legion and even clown have little problems.
---
The only ones with problems are billy and pure M1 killers IMO.
---
Just yesterday as a wraith I got looped at four windows all next to each other for about 5 minutes. It just sucks how broken it is.
---
Purposely terrorizing a girl streamer with scratched mirror Myers and watching the replay after.
---
I try not to tunnel but half the time I can‚Äôt help it. If i leave the hook, and still haven‚Äôt found anyone by the time they‚Äôre unhooked, ima go back. And I‚Äôll go for the first person I see. Which is often the one who got unhooked. I‚Äôll have a glance around and see if there‚Äôs anyone else but most of the time, the healthy unhooker is more careful than the one who actually should be
---
Are you gatekeeping fear?
---
All competitive games are toxic, so how about you grow a thick skin because no amount of censorship will protect you, eventually someone in the real world will get to your nerves. Besides its just a game, sometimes you do good, sometimes you do bad, so why dont you be a champ and take the lose.
---
Truly epic
---
‚ÄúYour opinion is invalid because you disagree with me and the people who upvoted my post‚Äù
---
Makes sense
---
GREAT SHIT! PIP\_ERROR HAS NOW A PROPER NAME AND DESCRIPTION! FUCKING GLAD I NOW CAN READ IN DETAIL THAT MY RANK COULDN'T BE UPDATED. AND BACK TO THE TITLE SCREEN IT IS!
---
Exactly that, idk if it‚Äôs international but we‚Äôre I live it‚Äôs ‚Äúcommon knowledge‚Äù that Jewish love money and don‚Äôt like to spend much but could do anything for money
---
Therefore I join a match itemless and always steal one
---
Yes, because teachables don't exist and every single Quentin player in the world runs wake up.
---
What an idiot lmao
---
No it does not, quite a few people are having this problem on Xbox. Don't make up rumors. Show the link that says that instead of pulling stuff out of thin air.
---
Quintons are much more likely to use their perk. Just like you expect david to dead hard or meg to have adrenaline, i expect quinton to use bugged wake up.
---
Is Nea‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlack Cat Side-Shave‚Äù bugged for anyone else? Her hair is no longer straight but curly.
---
Camping, tunneling, looping and bodyblocking are all part of the game. It‚Äôs not reportable, bannable, or even against the rules.
---
Really wish people would get over that already
---
You can still fill in evaders points with stealth, just gotta be close to the killer. I really like bond for this. While killer chase a teammate, i stay close to them from a distance. Not only does this give me a lot of evader point, but once the chased teammate is hooked, i am very close for a save for altruism emblems.
---
If you do something that is advantageous to you its not inherently toxic. The playerbase just seems to think that survivors are entitled to a ‚Äúfun game‚Äù and the killer shouldnt do what they need to do to win
---
yes I do everything 100%
---
Of course not! I think people should use whatever perks they want! Credit to the guy for using completely random perks! :)
---
hahahaha springfield is on the game?
---
Not really, no. Read again, and maybe you'll understand. Allow me to make it simple.
---
- You are complaining that my post is "HAHA TOXIC KILLER", because it is oversaturated on this subreddit.
---
- You are voicing this complaint in the comments of my post, which is oversaturated with similar complaints.
---
- I responded by telling you that my upload has many upvotes, meaning that people enjoyed it. Therefore, my upload has more of a right to exist than your poxy comment, which has been phrased by multiple other people, with far more eloquence.
---
Are you up to speed, or should I make it even more simple?
---
So we have Dead Hard and ass
---
We're still working on a fix for this one. We'll keep you posted as soon as we have more news to share.
---
Well after being pallet looped by a survivor I found out that they were a work colleague. I got them fired after I explained to the boss that they were a toxic survivor.
---
Scrappy Doo (Movie) would be a good Werewolf.
---
No, it shouldn‚Äôt be more then a bloodpoint loss.
---
Survivors that try their hardest to live isn‚Äôt their fault, just like killers who try their hardest to kill isn‚Äôt their fault.
---
I don't even know what a wake up bug is.
---
*whips out NOED*
---
Yes. If you don't mind.
---
Its a perk that was bugged. It would give +15% speed to everything.
---
Seems like you're just playing at low levels, if a killer EVER loses you in a chase due to self care they can't be past rank 15
---
Exactly this. I hate people that get salty when you don't give the last survivor the hatch. Like bitch, the point of the game is to kill everyone, idc if youre the last survivor
---
üëèGenüëèrushingüëèisn‚Äôtüëèrealüëè
---
Sometimes. Sometimes it‚Äôs faster to fall off the map into the center and run to the other exit. Sometimes it‚Äôs also faster to just walk back through the escape line to trigger it again. And finally, sometimes you literally can not escape and have to die to end game collapse. Pretty good job so far...
---
"Misc. audio fixes" might cover it.
---
So youre saying you want the survivor to run around open fields with no looping, and have some way to stop the killer from killing his targets.
---
Why bother even playing the game.
---
Just a little project I am doing. Making all original killers as members of the legion, this one is The Trapper.
---
It is lacking details, shadows and all that, this is kinda a preview to read comments and all that.
---
And finally, yes, the name was taken from Samination.
---
You can't blanket ban because it's possible people either didn't know, or assumed it was supposed to be that way. If you're going to punish people there needs to be a message in game, as there was with Legion.
---
Why tf is doc so low? He should be like top 3 for pressure
---
WHY THE FUCK IS THE INITIALIZATION ERROR STILL A FUCKING THING?! SERIOUSLY THIS ERROR SHOWED UP YEARS AGO AND IS STILL KEEPING PEOPLE FROM PLAYING THIS GAME. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. GET IT ALL TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN A BACKPACK. ALL YOUR SHIT, SO ITS TOGETHER, AND IF YOU GOTTA TAKE IT SOMEWHERE; TAKE IT SOMEWHERE YA KNOW? TAKE IT TO THE SHIT STORE AND SELL IT OR PUT IT IN A SHIT MUSEUM. I DON‚ÄôT CARE WHAT YOU DO. YOU JUST GOT TO GET IT TOGETHER. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER.

&gt;i responded by telling you that my upload has many more upvotes, meaning that people enjoyed it. Therefore, my upload gas more of a right to exist than your poxy comment, which has been phrased by multiple other people, with far more eloquence.

That is literally ‚Äúmy post of a differing opinion has more upvotes therefore your opinion is invalid‚Äù 
---
I understand other people said what i did, no reason i cant put it into my own words
---
Sorry i had a different opinion like many others but that does not mean im not aloud to voice it
---
Are you up to speed? Or should i make it even more simple?
---
They still haven't addressed the mettle of man perk being shit now. Include safe unhooks, behavior!
---
Stonks
---
well then. Also Ive heard if you fall off you die on next hook no matter what
---
clown has very little map pressure. trapper has eh map pressure.
---
Well, it takes 16 seconds to heal someone whilst there's two people in one place. 
---
Self Care enables it so that it only takes one person 32 seconds to heal, freeing up the 2nd person to work on a gen or do something else
---
Either way, it's the same amount of time. The only difference is the added time of having to run to the person with Bond whereas with Self-Care, you just gotta find a hiding spot. Self-Care is a lot safer in that regard because your allies may be in a chase or too far away, having to find them can be time-consuming.
---
As I said, I've played with Bond for months and I know it's benefits. I just don't rate them that important any more.
---
Finally wake up is fixed and I can use it again. Such an underrated perk that has saved my skin a ton at red ranks.
---
If you got past the initialization screen from the start menu, the update didn't affect you... Or "ban you" according to FoofyBoy. 
---
BTW don't play with exploits.
---
Yes punish people for using a perk which is in the game, its not the players problem the devs mucked the perk up.
---
Why does this have 3.2k upvotes when we've seen this posted numerous times? Am I missing something original here?
---
Are the colors representative of the usual yellow/green/purple colors?
---
I hate having to constantly repeat this but okay:
---
Just because the DBD team is making new chapter does NOT mean the team isn't fixing the game. The people who make the chapters aren't the people who fix the bugs or keep the state of the game in healthy working order. They're just artists, animators, level designers, and coders whose job is to make the new Killers, Survivors, perks, and Maps for us all to enjoy.
---
People seem to look at BHVR as one person and think just because they are releasing new content it must mean they aren't doing anything else. There are TONS of people who work on the game that we haven't even seen. And they all do their part.
---
They have been focusing on rewriting the game, they've updated it on us constantly. They are always making it better. The game is in the best state right now then it's been in in the past and it's only going to get better.
---
I do it if their rando teammates DC'd on them. but if they were an obvious SWC, fuck 'em. they knew who they allied with.
---
The person who played her is making the rounds in comic cons. You should get her to sign it.

Are they though? One takes a person out of the game completely but the other is not affecting the game in anyway? I‚Äôd rather have a tea-bagger then a dc

Lol some ppl actually calling you toxic if you actually do the objective! Aka gen rushing xD

Quentin has pills, Jane has coke.

If you do decide to learn Billy, definitely check out OhTofu's youtube guide on it. It's over an hour of everything you will ever need to know about playing as and against Billy.  
---
I'm not much of a Billy player myself, but everytime I've played against that madman's Legacy 3 Billy... &gt;.&lt;  
---
He knows his stuff, that's for sure.
---
Yeah it just shows three but will still get the fourth stack. It just won't update for you to know on the HUD. BBQ is not broken at all it's just the logic that controls the maximum amount of stacks visible is just capped at 3 even though the max is still at 4.
---
I feel sad for Trapper boi
---
Protect the baby Megs at all costs
---
I devour hope by closing the hatch in the last person's face but then I replenish it by letting them open the door for more points.
---
I only give it to non Claudette‚Äôs, but Meg‚Äôs are so appreciative.
---
I LOVE HOW THEY DO BUG FIXING UPDATES THAT BREAKS THE GAME EVEN MORE!!! THEY‚ÄôVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR!!!!
---
Times for gen completion without toolboxes or any perks:
---
1 person on a gen takes 80 seconds.
---
2 people on a gen takes 44.44 seconds.
---
3 people take 33.33 seconds.
---
4 people take 28.57 seconds.
---
If everyone does a gen by themselves, 4 gens are done in 80 seconds.
---
If 4 people work in groups of 2 on 2 gens, then do the same thing with 2 more gens, they can complete 4 gens in 88.88 seconds.
---
If 3 people do 2 gens while 1 person does 2 gens, the group of 3 will finish 2 gens in 66.66 seconds. The 4th person will finish in 160 seconds.
---
If 4 people work as a group for 4 gens, they will finish 4 gens in 114.28 seconds.
---
How about make it so that he starts with all of his traps, and he has no limit to how many he can carry. 
---
And picking up a trapped survivor should give you the trap back.
---
His traps function fine, he just shouldn't have to waste so much of his own time.
---
Shut off Xbox, unplugged power and internet. Plugged everything in, reset Xbox, I'm now in the game. 
---
Call that avoiding a ban or whatever rumor you were trying to start
---
Are you serious? One actively wastes someones time (which is the only thing relevant) whereas the other does jack shit.
---
How's that gonna help?
---
ah it's a Cannibal perk but we'll worth having in certain situations, hope it turns up on the shrine then that's how I got mine haha
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee how dare you have an opinion on whats fun
---
True, it‚Äôs sad too cause they always have really good promotion art for cosmetics but their body pillows look like screenshots of the characters with blank backgrounds
---
Lithe has always been problematic. The main issue being you have to be in a chase to utilize it. Sometimes during chases the chase will end abruptly before the game even cares to notify you yet. Usually not a big deal but for Lithe which is always checking if you're in a state of being in a chase it will cause the perk to sometimes cease to function properly.
---
On which map is is?
---
doctor fucker rights
---
LOL, you missed the entire point of this post.
---
It's okay. You'll get there.
---
Imaging getting banned for talking shit... We couldnt play any game
---
No ballerina feng min?sigh*
---
Whaaat?! This is hilarious! Hahah
---
They updated some hairstyles last week, including Nea's side-shaved hair.
---
Haddonfield rocks my socks off.
---
No way survivors dont like this map. Sound like you had some bad killer games.
---
That sucks. I've been getting matches faster then before.
---
When did I explicitly say talking shit was toxic behavior 
---
Wyd
---
Gen rushing is even more detrimental to killers that have any kind of setup time and therefore Ruin is just about mandatory. Sometimes you can get away with sloppy butcher.
---
Every time I play Ghostface, I get genrushed to fucking DEATH and I don't have ruin. But if I use ruin, survivors won't be distracted and sitting at a gen for me to sneak up on them; half of them will be running around the map looking for it and will probably blow my cover first.
---
So how the hell am I supposed to make a thoughtful approach on a survivor without them seeing me if I have this timer bearing down?
---
The idea of stealth is cool but it's unrealistic in the current state of the game. They should make ruin do something else and just do a overall nerf on generator progression or just make them harder or more complicated to complete.
---
I wonder what would happen to its effectiveness if Ruin was changed to disable the bonus on great skillchecks, and apply a flat % penalty to repair speed rather than a regression on good skill checks.  
---
I've had times where I've gotten maybe two or three skill checks total on a generator with Ruin, and it felt like the killer got completely robbed... and then there are times where I get 5 in a row as soon as I reach 90% lol.
---
A ochido lo banearon por que hizo una caza de brujas contra un jugador,mandando  su legion de fans para hostigar al muchacho en cuestion,ademas de los exploits del pantano
---
Nice edit after you posted your comment to try and make me look stupid.
---
Cries in 5 cakes in last 30 webs
---
I hate it because of how easy as a survivor it is to loop the Killer.
---
I've had many Killers just give up or rage quit because of this map. As a Killer main myself I understand why it's frustrating. Especially when people are constantly using map offerings to get this map because a majority of the killer cast can have a hard time on it without the proper perks and/or addons.
---
That's not fun. I can see the Killer isn't having fun. I'm the kind of guy who cares what people are thinking, even in a video game.
---
Be me, ace at lvl 47, lvl one ace in the hole and no plunders instinct
---
I joined a weird game against legion, he hit me once with his feral ferenzy and I couldn't move at all!! And couldn't mend either!
---
&gt;On the flip side, survivors being able to reveal him from behind cover should also be removed. If he can't stalk you, then you shouldn't be able to reveal him.
---
And on the flip side, there were cases where both of you can see each other and he can stalk you, but you can't reveal him.
---

https://clips.twitch.tv/ObliqueTenderKuduGivePLZ
---
It's inconsistent for both sides.
---
&gt; And don't get me started on Object of Depression. 
---
Yeah OoO counters stealth killers, that's been a case with Wraith, Pig and Myers before GF came out.
---
&gt;And no, Myers can't extend his exposed timer by stalking you but GF doesn't have add ons like Fragrant Tuft either. 
---
Ghostface's original exposed status duration was 20, along with the ability to extend the duration with stalk. That duration got bumped up to 45, at a cost of taking away the extension of stalking an already exposed target. You can read about it in the patch notes.
---
GF doesn't have to go through 2 tiers to get his exposed effect, including Myers' garbage tier 1.
---
His stalk is much faster, and is specific to the survivor stalked, meaning that you can't just wait it out if you're not in chase with him like you can with Myers.
---
Plus they are taking away the loud sound that he makes when he's close to you. Imo I see that hotfix as a buff.
---
I saw the Legion blade problem happen with just the purple one. I doubt they've fully even fixed it yet.
---
Emblems are still personal. And personally I count a win as an escape, so i use perks that help me escape, not maximize my emblems. but let's say you count a win as a pip then Bond is better as it helps your teams emblems.
---
I love running Nurses Calling on him. No terror radius or stain allows me to sneak up on them, either downing the person I already hit or expose the person who isnt.
---
Funny how you only see posts like this and not the other way around lol.
---
it was on kyf but okay sorry
---
it helped me cope with a lot of things
---
someone's in a mood.
---
Pig would be Angela
---
Should also apply to prestige outfits if it doesn't already
---
I think it's the house, actually, but it could be the fields, but it's towards a corner, you'd know it when you see it, it's a loop with a cow strung up on a tree, usually it has 2 windows or so and a pallet
---
not exactly I made the blue perks to represent levels 30 = blue and 35 for purple and red for levels 40
---
I waited for a long time for BBQ, then gave up and got Bubba, progressed him enough to get BBQ for all my killers. In this time span I've only seen BBQ in the shrine once.
---
what's great about Carl the cashier memes is, nobody would end up playing him because he's so big he'll be seen all the time.
---
the joke is that smug survivors taunting the killer are usually fragile enough to DC if they're losing
---
Claudettes and Neas are either stealthing around the map or insanely toxic and tries to bully the killer every chance they get. Ashes are pretty cool dudes and always try to save their teammates, Aces are pretty damn lucky and somehow find your damn totem in the first few minutes of the match and Kate's always drop the good pallets when the killer isn't even there and make dumb decisions. These are all from what I see as Killer as I don't play Survivor alot since the game has been buggy for them.
---
No if you own all bloody cosmetics it doesn't become an outfit. It differently should tough.
---
if they dont make his weapon a buyable dildo we RIOT
---
This post reminds me of how fucking stupid it is that English has words with random silent e's at the end  
---
Like actually why
---
I switched to playing killer when the plague came out and I will always remember the first time I got tasked to kill a SWF group. It was the biggest nightmare I‚Äôve experienced in this game to date. Cherry on top were the messages at the end. Mad respect to killer mains now.
---
What kind of fantasy world are you living in can I join
---
Can we take a second to realize how hot Billy looked in that outfit while standing there?
---
How is moving twice as fast acrossed the map NOT map pressure?
---
Or killing all 4 survivors
---
The ones I‚Äôm having a hard time putting my finger on are Kate, tapp, Jeff  and Quentin lol. I don‚Äôt see them very often.
---
So well put ‚Äúidiot‚Äù down as Kate‚Äôs üòÇ
---
McLean said on stream a while back that the official stance held by BHVR is that they can't officially condone it to EAC in case an exploit comes up, but that EAC presently won't ban you for it.
---
Nanana. Drop survivor far away from hatch and when they get there, close it and mori. (Only if it's a dark clothes claud or Ash without his cashier clothes)
---
The very idea that survivors doing their main fucking objective is somehow toxic is the stupidest shit I‚Äôve ever seen on this subreddit.
---
Plain and simple. Someone needs to git gud, for lack of a better term
---
PWYF was bugged and needed fixing. However, if the devs want people to use more gimicky perks, they would need some buffs. For example, removing a token when a survivor gets hit, rather than whenever a killer swings would be welcome.
---
I love to troll and mori those survivors with a YT or Twitch in their nicknames in case they are streaming
---
YES I have been wanting this for months
---
I‚ÄôLL MAKE IT MYSELF
---
Jeff's, Tapps and Quentin's are mostly chill in my opinion but you barely see any that I can't really make a judgement on those.
---
Is there a bug I don‚Äôt know about or is comment this calling me out for being trash?
---
The thing that gives him away for me is the dramatic whooshing noise his cloak makes. Lol
---
D:
---
Another thing, if you click on the "character info" when looking at their page in your killers/survivors, it will show you all of their perks,  
---
If you have the teachable unlocked, it will tell you.

If you do not have the teachable unlocked, it will tell you what level it is unlocked, and if it's currently available for unlock (either from bloodweb or shrine of secrets).  
---
But the teachables will always appear in the bloodweb from left to right.
---
Seriously. I'm as much of a killer main as anyone, but that shit was broken.
---
Killer is easy though. Only time the game is even a challenge is against swf
---
The very Idea that a killer is doing their main fucking objective is somehow toxic is the stupidest shit i've ever seen on this subreddit
---
Plain and simple. Someone needs to hide better and not unhook the survivor in front of the killer, for lack of a better term
---
We just need to get that chase music sorted and we're somewhat golden.
---
I really appreciate this post. It is good to see that the other side would actually get to know what a lot of killer mains go through.
---
I love to use firecrackers in the exit gate when the killer get a survivor to let them down of his shoulder
---
Yes exactly, my objective is to pip, i'm trying to reach rank 1.
---
Sounds like youre a bit afraid of getting hung on a hook. Its part of the game.  You can get hooked twice and still get a pip. You just need to realize youre not always going to get away.
---
Play the killer side and wall around the map finding noone and youll see how little fun you can have.
---
I think safe unhooks would be a fine balance for it.
---
Isn‚Äôt deathgarden like dead tho? Or did they do that re-launch thing?
---
In any given day, Id rather get tbagged and end game chat insults than being slugged or camped/tunneled.
---
Idk if you confused when i said urban helped me lose killers or if you were talking about the situation of killer getting a hit off and then losing me. If its the latter then you are mistaken. There are multiple occasions that you can be hurt in game such as trappers traps when using the addon to wound survivors that disarm the trap. I am currently at rank 8 i believe and just last night played a match against the spirit and do the exact thing i explained urban is clutch for so it isnt just low ranks you can pull some nice escapes against.
---
I hope. The only dlc I have is the pig and I love her. Planning on getting legion or plague
---
I get the rant, but really, DS. That shit became basically useless a while ago
---
DBD Coke Themed... ooof.
---
Oooo I think you may have just given me the perfect idea.
---
Especially because I'm all about finding the person who unhooked someone, they usually go heal. That would be perfect!
---
I believe so. 1 new set of stuff (usually multiple characters) released every week.
---
Yes but I believe we won't get cosmetics this week because of the event and next week we get them
---
If my "Ez" after destroying a squadette would get muted i'd be really fuckin pissed
---
they did re-launch and its way better but they have one major issue that is absolutely terrible.  That is, instant executions...they need to rework those ASAP
---
I mean yeah, but if you get pulled off the hook twice by other teammates, you‚Äôre a bit of a dick if you tunnel, but hey, you‚Äôre trying to win.
---
You‚Äôre comparing that scenario to survivors just doing the objectives, which is idiotic and a bad comparison
---
It also happened to me and it made me so confused.
---
&gt;Check the multiple responses
---
Literally no one has responded to me other than ‚Äúlol no‚Äù.
---
None of your arguments hold up at all.
---
Looks very GPU demanding. Aesthetically beautiful but I dislike it considering how long we sit on lobbies. Having a console or GPU running hotter and louder for literally no reason bothers me.
---
Unfortunately I am alone on this as the average user just press the "ON button" and gives zero fucks about how their system is running the apps (until it breaks).
---
The road goes both ways for Killers getting 4ks instead of giving last survivor hatch
---
It doesn't need a Chase to activate (anymore)
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
üíÅüíÅüíÅ
---
imagine caring about other peoples ranks
---
If I remember correctly, they‚Äôve that‚Äôll make it easier for them to differentiate who‚Äôs actually quitting compared to losing connection
---
What? No.
---
That has literally zero relevance. Not sure what you‚Äôre even saying. Killers deserve 4K‚Äôs, they don‚Äôt owe you hatch for shit.
---
It's a team sport. So in actuality, it's your time too. Those gens need to get done and have two people occupied instead of just one makes no sense. I run self care but I barely ever heal myself unless some shit is about to go down. That's why I usually run Iron Will now.
---
Got a 2 week ban on League for saying "Sy√∂ paskaa homo". Also saying KYS gets you instantly perma'd. Some companies take it too far man..
---
But Ghostface barely got nerfed they just adjusted him plus are really complaining about a perk that punishes tunneling and isn't that strong? Anyways have fun with DeathGarden dude
---
You crazy. Game is great
---
That would be a really nice change tbh
---
TBF, decisive strike still has a place in the game and isn‚Äôt the get out of jail free card it used to be
---
How is this not relevant? We were talking about how killers get mad when survivors do their objective (completing gens), and im saying survivors do the same when killers dont give the last survivor hatch
---
Ok.
---
Jesus I bet they were PISSED about that
---
this is so great lol
---
&gt; Given how the game is so heavily balanced in the killers favour to the pii t of almost game breaking, I think it is time that we go back to killers needing to be one metre away from the hook and be online with it to start it.
---
No offense but this is wrong. Unless the killer is the Nurse, its generally going to be survivor sided, especially with SWF.
---
Please elaborate.
---
??????????
---
lol if you say so
---
SWF is toxic? Lolwut
---
Completely agree, I‚Äôll take a hard nerf to ruin if it means they actually do something to the gens. As someone who‚Äôs been wanting to play clown but can‚Äôt get ruin with him despite being on my 75th bloodweeb it‚Äôs mind blowing how damn fast gens pop off in the higher ranks. People really don‚Äôt understand how easy it is to get gens when it‚Äôs one killer against 4 survivors, being in a chase means potentially 3 survivors are all working on gens and if 2 are working on the same gen they can easily finish it before you get the survivor to a hook. Ruin is a mandatory perk killers only have 3 perk slots in actuality.
---
Today a leatherface decided that the party trick of downing my teammate twice at 5 gens, making him and his friend leave, and the third guy to give up at first hook, was to be taken to the hatch to have it kicked down and slugged. Yeah..
---
You are actively punishing the survivors. One less person means one less person doing gens, One less person to take people off the hook, and one less person to distract the Killer. Killing is the main damn thing killers are meant to do so """""""Tunneling"""""""""" a survivor who made a shit decision. Stop living in a fantasy realm where gen rushing doesn't exist. what I'm trying to do is show you that you're arguments work both ways
---
"It's the main objective"
---
It was patched today.
---
They are always toxic 99% of the time
---
Ah ok, maybe im just use to controller. I bet huntress is easier but after that I imagine it would be worse for me personally. The only other thing is I'd rather press x then a key on a mechanical keyboard while struggling. How does wiggling as a survivor work? Do you drag the mouse around or press the arrow keys?
---
Glad to help out!
---
LoL.
---
Yup and it's shit. Dead by Roblox
---
I realise this, but I'm just saying they all need to collectively focus more on quality. I scroll through the reddit and only see videos and memes of glitches and bugs and that's a problem.
---
Ok what did starbreeze not allow dead by daylight to do?
---
And while your at it what did it restrict payday to do?
---
In all fairness though you gotta remember add ons that effect distance between hooks and so forth..
---
And reduced number in hooks could make this pretty busted due to the fact that if someone sabotages 1-3, with the distance between hooks, the killer may have a hard time hooking at all! 
---
There‚Äôs also perks that the killer has (iron grip?) that prolong the wiggling phase, which could be why you had/having such a hard time escaping? 
---
Then decisive strike which gives free escapes etc etc..
---
There‚Äôs a lot of factors that come into play for what seems like such a simple adjustment.
---
Ayyyy my 2 fav games keep em coming :D
---
"Always toxic 99% of the time" you memeing lolol
---
the tables turn
---
I KNOW ITS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU CAN LITERALLY ONE SHOT ME ANYWAYS WHY DO YOU NEED NOED
---
The pig cosmetics definitely aren't gonna be male, they are for Amanda.
---
I'd rather have more DLC than then spending an inordinate amount of time on bug fixes tbqh
---
Its true lol
---
Id let billy stab me
---
You are either a nurse player or above rank 10.
---
That‚Äôs a weird list!
---
Eh fair enough, I play plenty of survivor(Dwight main rise up) and I do admit that it can be frustrating
---
DG is slowly dying again. It won't be long before you can't find lobbies.
---
Well the people working on cosmetics can‚Äôt help fix a game when they work on cosmetics. They are working on fixing things, I wish the game did have less bugs and glitches but it‚Äôs really not that horrible most of the time
---
The problem is that so many survivors call out camping or tunneling when there's totally fair gameplay happening. Tunneling is pretty much just when you chase 1 survivor until they're sacrificed. hook them, they get unhooked, you chase them down and them specifically, ignoring any legitimate reasons to go off of them.  
---
There's a fine, but clear, line between tunneling and punishing bad survivor plays
---
this is why I love the corn fields, it's a direct path to the generators for Hillbilly
---
The killer isntict is a tad useless but it's a buff none the less! So did they make it so GF makes no sounds at all in night shroud?
---
Please fix issue of Trapper when picking up a trap keeps on looking down after trap is picked up.
---
That‚Äôs one of the reasons I made this post. I quit this game a few days ago and I want deathgarden to have a bigger player base than this shit
---
On console, but not on PC. Theres no evidence, its just made up things from confirmation bias.
---
yea it‚Äôs just that this costume is more masculine and some people automatically assumed it was gonna be a male pig
---
I call bull. Totally not true. Played 20 matches with my one friend today and we had one match where it was 4 escaped. 7 matches were 4Kills and the rest were a mix. So clearly the game isn't balanced. The game should never be balanced for swf as that penalises that rest of us that play it solo.
---
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKEEEEE UUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPP
---
Its toggling A,D. So the same as controller just side to side movement.
---
SALTY GHOSTFACE JUST CALLED ME AUTISTIC BECAUSE I GOT ADRENALINE SPEED BOOST MID CHASE AND OPEN HATCH RIGHT IN HIS FACE TO ESCAPE
---
LEAVING THIS POST IN HIS MEMORY BECAUSE MY BOI WAS SALTY AF
---
MY DELIVERANCE PERK DIDN‚ÄôT WORK YESTERDAY AND ALMOST COSTED ME THE MATCH
---
It's getting worse. Every time something new comes, it brings a bug. I'm ok if they work on cosmetics and new killers, I just don't want it released until the problems get fixed first.
---
This. I've been caught so many times because it sounds like the killer is far away from me and then surprise! he's right behind me! Not to mention the number of times I've been bodyblocked in a nook by a killer- thankfully none of them have used it in a scummy fashion, but still. If I could at least hear that the killer is so close he's sniffing my hair, I would be trying to hide in a nook and getting downed so much :c
---
No cause them I have to play the game to see if it‚Äôs worth anything
---
Ah right on, not bad at all
---
Gen repairs is what survivors are supposed to do. Period. It doesn‚Äôt affect anyone‚Äôs game, it‚Äôs just the objective. You can even run perks to counter repairs, there‚Äôs a whole slew of options.
---
But if you get saved stupidly, there‚Äôs nothing you can do, and you get punished for another survivor being stupid, and you have a bad game. I‚Äôve made it very clear, while you‚Äôve just parroted my arguments nonsensically. Gen rushing isn‚Äôt real and never will be. Tunneling is real and WHILE ITS UNDERSTANDABLE, you are kinda a dick for doing it.
---
In no way are you a dick for doing gens. You can‚Äôt seem to get this through, so peace dude. Enjoy not understanding this game at all and whining about stupid imaginary shit because people don‚Äôt like you when you‚Äôre an asshole.
---
Once again
---
GET. OUT. OF. YOUR. FANTASY. REALM
---
yea, I just wanted to clear some stuff up because I heard a few people say this pig cosmetic was going to be male
---
Gen rushing isn‚Äôt real.
---
Sorry buddy.
---
You‚Äôre bad.
---
It does, killers are totally allowed to get 4ks, giving hatch is just a really fun and nice. if a survivor complains about a 4k in of itself then that's dumb too.
---
&gt;That‚Äôs one of the reasons I made this post. I quit this game a few days ago and I want deathgarden to have a bigger player base than this shit
---
I watched streamers playing both versions (couldn't play it myself cuz no server for my region). The game gets boring very quickly. It is way more repetitive than DBD with less content to make up for it. 
---
After watching 5 or so matches, I couldn't handle anymore. At least DBD has pallet RNG, loadouts, a lot of maps in the poll, many different killers with unique powers. 
---
Hunters in DG seemed like just run and shoot. Runners was pretty much hide or die in this second iteration.
---
They re-launched the game but still carries the main issues of the previous version.
---
I mean one might be, but from what I saw they aren't, and that is one of Amanda's outfits up there.
---
Worst time this bug happened to me was agaisnt a freddy.
---
Im trying to survive
---
What rank are you? You can really speak of balance before red ranks. If you are a low rank the issue is probably just your skill level. At low ranks killers actually kinda are OP.
---
Lmfao
---
No problemo :)
---
And then you get Lerys with the basement in the middle room and its the same gen!
---
In my opinion, nothing is wrong with gen rushing because it is literally the only TRUE objective for survivors in the game other than keeping each-other alive. Although, if a survivor gen-rushes, and then gets hit in the face by NOED, they shouldn't complain.
---
This looks awesome!
---
I was playing survivor with a few friends, and it was against the pig. We were all having fun, no camping, tunneling, t-bagging, flashlights, or anything like that. 
---
She hooked my one friend, and began walking away. I was standing really close and hiding behind a wall. She crouched down and turned around to look at him again, so I crouched behind her and just sat there.
---
When she turned around, she froze for a second, before nodding at me, letting me get the rescue, letting us go, and the  playing normally again.
---
Now were friends and play together all the time
---
Most of Dead by Daylight players are on console, so no, no we cannot
---
Ha, you are like a little baby. I'm reporting you to devs, reddit mods AND police for cyberbullying. 
---
How do you like that?
---
But like- cosmetics don‚Äôt even come in patches- fixes come in patches. Like I said they‚Äôre different teams of people not the same. The people working on bug fixes and trying to figure out what went wrong do not work on cosmetics and people who work on cosmetics do not work on the game or at the very least they are a team dedicated to design. Cosmetics are usually there to support the creators of the game and their teams so that they can get more people. The people working on cosmetics are just doing their job and they have no control over what‚Äôs going on in the game. Cosmetics do not halt fixes or their work
---
That same thing happened to me in a previous match, before they nerfed DS.
---
Thank you. Didn't know this
---
Killing is just what the killer are supposed to do. It's just the onjective. You can even run counter perks like Borrowed time and DS,We'll make it, there's a whole slew of options.
---
Tunneling isn't real it's just a killer hitting a survivor like normal. Gen rushing is real and WHILE IT'S understandable, You are kinda a dick for doing it.
---
In no way are you a dick for killing a survivor. You just can't seem to get this through, so peace. Enjoy you're fantasy realm where gen rushing doesn't exist.
---
Yea happens with pallet saves too
---
Nice, the game owed you one :P
---
Currently rank 8 but I have been both a rank 1 survivor and killer
---
Parroting my arguments doesn‚Äôt make what you‚Äôre saying correct.
---
You literally just said you are a dick for doing gens.
---
How fucking dumb can you be
---
thats what i said brah
---
I scare easy, so most jumpscares get me and i love it. But In particular it would be my first encounter with a prayer bead spirit who grabbed me off the gen, making me scream my head off and run to the bathroom cause i quite literally almost pissed myself. Sadly i died on the hook for being afk, but my lord i will never forget that. Overall though i love the jumpscare killers for these moments
---
Wait does corrupted puke also one-down with the perk?
---
how was it different than Myers? I havent played Ghostface yet due to them announcing they'd nerf him before release.
---
No im saying you're a dick for gen rushing. Doing gens is fine I have no probelms with that. How fucking dumb can you be
---
Oh yeah?
---
Well I just reported you to **GOD**. 
---
*mic drop*
---
LMFAO WHAT
---
Dude. Just stop.
---
There is SWF groups on discord you could try that. Unfortunatly, the main downside to this advice is that the SWF system is really annoying to use (gotta recreate the group after every games, and that bugs half the time).
---
Was really hoping this was going to be lit today.
---
yeah i totally agree, it's legitimately fine to punish bad survivor plays.   
---
Don't. unhook. when. I'mLike3FeetAway
---
I agree with those saying the gens need to be slowed down as standard and Hex: Ruin needs to be reworked completely into something else. It's currently too good not to take for almost every killer, and you suffer greatly for not taking it, especially when facing good survivors.
---
True enough it is the only objective. Im just sick of having to wait 30 minutes for a game and then getting gen rushed and having the game end in like 3 minutes.
---
this is my favorite scary movie
---
Every single time buddy. What even IS bloodlust? Fucks my shit up.
---
Lauries are usually super altruistic and always the first one there to unhook, and/or heal.
---
Rotating once a month would give you enough time to check dude :| 
---
Besides there can always be two shrines.
---
Why is the same bitch that ranked nurse a D tier along side wraith talking about perks being balanced or not? Gtfo dumbass
---
Slugging build: knock out, sloppy butcher, deerstalker, and nurses 
---
You can‚Äôt loop me: brutal strength, enduring, spirit fury, and bamboozle
---
Jump Scare Myers: scratched mirror, with monitor, and three other perks 
---
Just to name three, there‚Äôs many more possibilities
---
Nice argument you really changed my mind with that
---
Same. Really bad in the match results screen too. It takes like a minute to let me spectate. And in today's patch I didn't see a fix mentioned.
---
but but only the survivors are toxic!! killers are just innocent victims!!
---
It‚Äôs a red add on for Ghostface that affects all killers.
---
I'm so damn happy about that.
---
Of course you‚Äôd play pig over Bubba, pig is loads of fun. Freddy on the other hand, might be better than bubba, but I‚Äôm still waiting for his rework
---
What do you mean SWF bullshit?
---
Because she has a cooldown. So, you either use her power in chase (which is the smarter thing to do so you can keep hooking) or you use it to pressure the map. You can't do both because of the cooldown (unless you have recovery add ons).
---
Well I hope you get it, but I warn you, after you reach rank 1 you start to realize how easy it is.
---
ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§üò©üò©üò©
---
Isnt dying light bugged too? Ive been told it currently doesnt need the killer to kill the obsession for the -25% speed penalty. I havent went against anyone running so i cant confirm it
---
I would never play solo if the pipping system was for escapes only
---
Imagine the amount of mental gymnastics required to convince yourself of this so adamantly.
---
Happens to me too, the worst is when you play against doctor and you can't snap out of it . So no gens,healing,dead hard,wiggle,snap out of it and no escaping. All the while screaming because of tier 3 insanity.
---
I play with headphones and this doesn't fix it. The only fix seems to be when you plug headphones into the pc directly, but any kind of wireless or bluetooth headphones still have this issue.
---
‚ÄúDo not argue with idiots. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience‚Äù
---
Sorry bud. You‚Äôre wrong. This thread will proves that. Anyway o look forward to your post tomorrow when you make another bad 2012 meme about some other imaginary thing survivors are doing
---
Wait I thought it did? Doesn‚Äôt it just count as a hit?
---
look how they massacred my boy
---
So that's what happens with my teammates every game?
---
Ghostface has Killer instinct but only when he gets spotted by someone.
---
Good woman!
---
Oh that might actually be me...
---
I MEAN DELIVERANCE WOULDN'T EVEN BE OP AT THAT POINT, SINCE YOU'RE FUCKING BROKEN.
---
this happened to a friend of mine during a swf, she had just gotten the game during the free weekend but her computer couldnt really handle the game so she kept on running into walls and lagged, but this one trapper gave her the hatch because he knew she was having a hard time. He was so nice, wish we had more killers like that
---
It sure is! But comparing that to gen rushing is stupid and sounds like he just wants a free win. He wants to be able to tunnel and kill without survivors trying to escape.
---
It‚Äôs moronic
---
i just wanted the new cosmetics so meh
---
ah okay thank you for clearing that up :)
---
 ‚ÄúDo not argue with idiots. They will drag you down to their level and beat you with experience‚Äù 
---
Sorry bud. You're wrong. The entirety of dead by daylight at high ranks proves that. Anyway look forward to you're next comment saying i'm wrong and failing completely. Enjoy being blind!
---
Can you make a toggle for those who want the super low chase music? I personally like it super low, i‚Äôm more aware of everything now.
---
ghost face is licensed. Unless you meant a ghost face skin for legion? Either way that could be a bit op. Considering the characters are already so much alike, that would be a HUGE advantage
---
Ran into a baby David today. I was chasing his teammate and the David heard my terror radius and blew the Gen in a panic. He started running and in the corner of my screen I saw him dead hard into a wall, I wasn't even chasing him lol. 
---
I ended up carrying him to the hatch in the end I felt so bad cause he was constantly panicking all game.
---
You‚Äôre literally basically screaming ‚Äúno u‚Äù lmao, grow the fuck up
---
how can you determine their initial design intent?
---
My brother got me into it and we bond over playing together. I got my ex into it, which lead to creating a group of friends to play with and through the group found my current bf.
---
does this ever stop
---
it would be worth going around the outside to have the chance, but fair
---
Agreed. These were the best to read this morning.
---
Wut happened to wake up?
---
There was an glitch that survivors exploited that allowed you to use wake up on all actions its been fixed in this patch
---
Agree to disagree friend.
---
I recommend getting Discordance. It is one of the best options, if not, arguably the best option to prevent survivors from cooperating. With Discordance, you know where the survivors are gen-rushing. That gives you some leverage over their plans.
---
You DO realize I'm stating the fact that Ruin is bad for the game from both sides of the aisle here, yes?  
---
If you don't understand why killers basically need Ruin in every build, then you obviously don't play much killer and your entire opinion is biased.  
---
The fact that there's a perk that one side needs to not get destroyed means the game itself is broken and needs to be fixed, not the perk itself.   
---
Understand?
---
Up to you dude. I‚Äôve been more then happy to dissect how you‚Äôve been wrong, but you just parrot me and sound like a dumbass in the process. Want to keep going and earn some more downvotes? Up to you.
---
You're literally basically screaming " I'm wrong so instead of talking like an adult i'm going to use slang to try and bring down my foes confidence" Lmao Rowl grow up
---
Kate will piss me off for no reason.
---
Jeff players are peaceful creatures.
---
totem either in the corner in the hedges, or in the fence corner next to the tree. 9/10.
---
Occasionally upstairs in the Myers house.
---
Do not abuse the News flair. Memes need to be flaired as Shitpost.
---
I know how to play her too. And like I said, unless you're running Amulet or Rusty Flute, you either use her power for chases or to pressure the map, you can't have both with her.
---
I agree that shit is annoying, but there's no way to preemptively know they're going to do that either. Unless you're just using a mori on all groups anyway lol
---
Meg = Braindead 75 percent of the time
---
That perk works so well for my anti ruin loadout. I call it Detective Gen Tapp
---
Where did they state it? I legitimately don't know. I'm newer so i didn't check out ghostface much
---
a gen rush is when everyone has a build meant to do gens and nothing else, often they use offerings to start next to eachother to achieve this. It is very effective and necessary at the higher ranks, but very... very... frustrating for a killer in any circumstance
---
I have an idea:
---
If you're the last survivor and the hatch has been closed, give the survivor the option to just give up. The Entity animation will play, the killer is granted the 'sacrifice' points as usual as if the timer ran out.
---
Yeah you can lol. Just because you cant spam a power doesn't mean there is no map pressure.
---
Today, I learned that Ghostface gets a directional notification when a survivor begins the process of spotting him.
---
Damn I would Tap Tapp
---
Dude I was wondering wtf was going on. Everything I did had the yellow progress bar at all times, but I was too dumb to attribute it to my Wake Up perk. Well, it was fun while it lasted lol.
---
or a perk dude, when a survivor is hooked, all survivor scratch marks are invisible for 10 seconds, or the killer sees fake scratch marks in places.
---
‚ÄúI was a killer main and I didnt understand why survivors complained about facecamping or NOED. After playing survivor, I still dont understand why baby survivors complain about NOED‚Äù. My first match I hid in a locker as the rest of my team distracted the killer, did all 5 gens and broke all 5 totems and was able to escape in the hatch. Just break all 5 totems lol.‚Äù
---
*3.5k upvotes, gilded 20 times, 400 comments from rank 15 killer mains trying to circlejerk about how NOED is balanced and that Adrenaline is overpowered*.
---
Then it would be too easy to get. Borrowed Time + MoM means you'd get nothing but camping Hillbillys, Leatherfaces and Ghostfaces.
---
Where are these killers?  Every match the hatch gets insta closed since ECG so they can walk between both gates and get their last kill for free.
---
Bro, there is a reason Billy, Hag, and Nurse have the best map pressure in the game. There is no *cooldown.*
---
I play as The Hag, and the perks I run are: Haunted Grounds, Thanatophobia, Discordance, and Ruin. My idea, is that the survivors cannot do anything without a punishment. Once they spawn in, they have to cleanse ruin or it will screw them over in the long run. But, there's a chamce they could accidently cleanse Haunted Grounds and suddenly the whole team has to run for their lives. I use Discordance to prevent survivors from cooperating on generators, as stated earlier. I use Thanatophobia as basically a "backup" perk if Ruin gets cleansed. I use Phantasm traps as a method of map control. I like to place these traps near generators and pallets so survivors are punished for even going NEAR these locations.
---
you did actually miss. Its INSANE, but from the slowmo it does look like it threaded the needle. Just bad luck man
---
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT DISCORDANCE DAMNIT
---
wow too kool dude let's also add assault rifles that shoots scratch marks to confuse killer and also a special ability called DJ where super louds rihanna music plays in the killer headphones to confuse him even more and also an ability called drug where the killed is transported to a different dimension where all he sees is a weird fortnite map.
---
Adams always have deliverence 
---
Davids and lauries anlways have dead hard
---
I never felt like he was very viable at red ranks but we‚Äôll see if intelligent builds come out in the future.
---
Self Care/Adrenaline builds are stale and uninteractive
---
If the killer is merciful, and you're the last one alive, you can run around and grab the hatch for sure. But that's solely dependent on the killer.
---
Are your headphones on backwards?
---
Agreed
---
Yeah I jumped off the map and it brought me back to killer shack
---
I mean we do have rocks for a similar purpose. Those distractions are fucking powerful
---
Gen rushing is generally code for you didn't control the gens (options for killers doing so aside). Tunneling is generally code for your team screwed up the rescue (camping aside).  If your teammates unhooks at a bad time, it's their misplay that you pay for (except they get penalized in benevolence). The frustrating thing about being hooked is you are relying on teammates, like it's a team game or something. Ds is how you can take it into your own hands, although in my xp, it hardly gets used. It's a perk I see sometimes but I'm not sure I'd call it meta.
---
He‚Äôs saltier than the bad side of the DBD community I bet.
---
Not currently as DCs aren't really bannable because they can't decide if you did it on purpose or you actually disconnected
---
It‚Äôs just rude to call an entire country ignorant and self centered because they don‚Äôt know a currency they have an almost nonexistent chance of ever using in their life.
---
No hatch cause there were two of us :(
---
Normally I play Billy and I run
---
B&amp;C,Ruin,enduring, and sprit fury
---
The survivors can't stop me from getting that hit. B&amp;C for finding cross map survivors, Ruin Because Ruin, Enduring So I can contest every pallet, and  fury to get that cheeky hit. Im thinking of changing it up a bit because of gen speeds. I love your perk bulid by the way might use it

I don't know anything about carpentry but if my table falls apart I kick off.

---
He's an 'OK' killer. Same tier as Myers. Pretty decent up until red ranks.
---
okay, yes, but like Sidney Prescott too
---
Oh? Did I say spirit was the best? No, I didn't. I just said it was good.
---
they're on the correct way, i just used the huntress as example. i've also had a few times where survivors walking behind me sound as if they're in front of me
---
You're a kind soul.
---
Thats because anything on this sub that is "Survivor positive" is praised really hard.
---
I think I'm in the opposite boat, I saw dbd YouTube videos and thought the chase mechanics were super fun! I think chases are more so a way to keep the killer busy so your other team mates can cleanse totems/repair gens.
---
I like your idea for Hillbilly. Glad you like my idea!
---
nice but what would you do faster after the wake up is activated? cleanse totems?
---
Man still has to activate Windows after everything? Damn
---
Hell as the survivor I can barely remember how many times I've been on the hook when farming.
---
If the killer kills me whatever I still get a shitload of bloodpoints and he hopefully won't depip due to it.
---
As I've said before, just set the controller down and make yourself a charcuterie platter. You get a snack while a toxic player wastes five minutes of his or her life with no payoff.
---
Somethings never change
---
It's all cool bud. I'll see if I can find it for you =]
---
As someone who took a year to finally get the "Four Moris in one match" trophy, please no.
---
Good god it's so tiring if you're farming as killer and you have identical clones, trying to remember which is which.
---
I really wish they'd had an icon on the bottom for the stage someone is going to be at if they got hooked again. Something like a regular hook if it will be their first, something like [pop goes the weasel's survivor portion](https://c-5uwzmx78pmca09x24oiumx78mlqix2ekczamklvx2ekwu.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3_c-5lmiljgligtqopb.oiumx78mlqi.kwu_/c-5UWZMXPMCA09x24pbbx78ax3ax2fx2foiumx78mlqi.kczamklv.kwux2flmiljgligtqopb_oiumx78mlqi_mvx2fkx2fk4x2fBmikpijtm_x78wx78OwmaBpmEmiamt.x78vox3fdmzaqwvx3dimk8082721m6lnnnn8j8n0501iik0ni2x26q98k.uizsx3dquiom_$/$/$/$/$) if it'll be their second/struggle phase, and just a small skull if it'll be death hook.
---
Depends on what platform you're on and what rank. High rank PC? Spirit. Low rank? Leatherface because he's similar to Billy
---
You are the problem
---
I only give it to a good surv if they had a bad team.
---
So this is the best reference source but I'll snip the relevant bits as well: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/69477/patch-notes-3-0-0-ghost-face
---
(Was edited later that day so not sure what's changed, but largely the same.)
---
*Marked Survivors may no longer be stalked. (Bug fix:¬†This was a planned change that was omitted in the 2nd PTB patch. We increased the Mark lasting time from 20 sec to 45 sec, but we wanted to remove his ability to keep Stalking a Mark Survivor to balance that change.)*
---
*The other hotfix changes were things that we had previously planned to do or bugs that were overlooked from the second PTB. Again, with the limited time that the PTB gives us to react, we had to choose our priorities. We were satisfied with the changes we made and have not reverted any of the changes on the live and hotfix patch.*
---
Both of these statements were made by Peanits. Ironically these both directly contradict what Peanits had stated days prior to the release of Ghostface explicitly stating that no changes were planned at that point. They're a bit of a PR mess if I'm honest. My few interactions with devs have generally left me feeling a tad condescended  and treated like a child (one dev, not naming names, refused to acknowledge that Legion was nerfed or even balanced, then stated that if you look at the numbers he was actually buffed) so I'm probably just bitter too ;P
---
Underrated post
---
Killer mains are the most vocal on this subreddit by far.
---
Then they broke it with 3.0
---
Yes. It‚Äôs in the patch notes.
---
so ? good for you. you are still a pleb -100h maybe or less. no one cares
---
fuck yes. Somebody DCs? ok i'll be nicer, but you fucks let somebody get 1 hooked when i'm patrolling across the map? nah, I'm going ham
---
As a PS4 player, I'm offended
---
In Friday the 13th you can talk to people but these two games are completely different in how they were intended to be played. Dead by daylight was never meant to have communication between the players where as Friday the 13th was mean to have you work together
---
&gt;How about Friday the 13? It‚Äôs a similar game.
---
F13th has built in coms, which is disliked by most people because kids would just play loud sounds or nonstop offend others. 
---
If they ever introduced coms to DBD, I would just disable it tbh.
---
Bagheera body in the second pic tho XD
---
Who the fuck camps and Tunnels as pig? She is literally designed to mit do those.
---
I personally am strongly in favor of implementing this, but the devs aren't and the majority of the community also is against it. Killers obviously enjoy having easier games, and survivors enjoy being the only ones to get this edge in discord.
---
why my pp hard üò°
---
Happen to me too, but only at the begining of the trial
---
It‚Äôs not all bad, sometimes you get some good ol lads and then you do a bit farming, let them leave but sometimes some willingly stay behind so you can hook them. But the majority is toxic unfortunately.
---
It‚Äôs a goddamn nerf stop pretending like it isn‚Äôt.  His most important addons got nerfed (in fact they just got nerfed more than the hotfix list so they don‚Äôt affect lean stalking), he can‚Äôt restalk marked survivors which was a useful tool for countering ridiculously long loops that lots of maps have, and now he can get detected even more easily than before where survivors can already third person detect you while you can‚Äôt stalk them.  His killer instinct changes hardly help him to kill survivors, other killers like doctor have madness to find survivors even more easily and can still keep their power afterwards.  It doesn‚Äôt matter.  The one actual buff was the removal of proximity sound while in shroud which can help him sneak up now which is nice but doesn‚Äôt make up for the nerfs.
---
Ok is it just me or is no one getting ANY sound out of their headphones when a match is over. They somehow fucked all the audio up even worse.
---
Have you tried the prayer beads and the firstborn ring or whatever?
---
A 2v8 mode could be interesting-5 gens but survivors repair at .75 speed and killers are a little faster
---
nurses, sloppy, ruin and any perk you‚Äôd like. (bbq, haunted grounds, devour, theres tons of perks that are fun on spirit)
---
Pp knows
---
Hell yeah
---
Omg I was in green ranks and Ruin had already been destroyed. This idiot goes to another lit totem and I run over and emote for them to stop. They don‚Äôt and of course it‚Äôs Haunted Ground. They got downed right after.
---
Maybe im sorry you struggle without add ons.
---
The buffs aren‚Äôt important to help him kill survivors.  Doctor is a testament to this because he has the best way to find survivors in the game and is still garbage.
---
Do you have any legal documents or anything of the sort to support this? I'm not trying to be a dick I'm just trying to figure out why my friends have received wallet refunds while I am getting rather rudely told to go to xbox. I wont even get into the issue I have with cosmetics being locked behind buying the same dlc from a different vendor or how I was never even informed there was another way to purchase the dlc. I just want information so I can be more knowledgeable about this subject.
---
this is the most beautiful thing i've ever seen
---
If she really wasnt catching up to you all game then she probably tried to use the hatchets too early wich means she was probably new so yes new people are going to be bad no need to be a dick about it tho
---
bitcoin miner monkaW
---
Damn, that's unfortunate. It sucks when devs aren't just forward with their consumers
---
I miss the time when u pressed the lobby button and u were immediately in =/
---
I noticed the 5 mins+ lobby creation, so I don't feel like to play DbD anymore, I hope they fix it, I hate to wait.
---
Yes except the survivor doesn't use the heartbeat sound to track you while in a chase. They either watch you, or watch your red stain, neither of which the perk actually helps with.
---
Indeed - I expected there would be some downsides to this...perhaps add some sort of condition so the survivor can't use it instantly. Not sure what that would be, and I expected there  are other situations I'm missing.
---
How dare you
---
A pretty standard practice these days, sadly. At least we can still enjoy their work =P
---
I am scared now
---
I don't think it's done yet. I think i saw it by mistake
---
Then they talk trash when escaping smh
---
She is pretty good with a hex build i use huntresses lullaby, haunted grounds, ruin(or noed I switch between them if I use a mori or not) and devour hope
---
SOME QUOTES FROM THE SALT CHANNEL IN MY FRIEND'S DISCORD, FORMATTED IN CAPS FOR THIS THREAD:
---
&gt;I REALLY DON'T WANT TO PLAY DEAD BY DAYLIGHT (PRE 3.0.1) BECAUSE EVERY KILLER MATCH IS AGAINST WAKE UP EXPLOITERS AND EVERY SURVIVOR MATCH IS AGAINST A BROKEFACE WHO I CAN'T REVEAL FROM ONE MILIMETER AWAY.
---
&gt;I REALLY WANT(ED) TO TRY GHOSTFACE PRE-HOTFIX BECAUSE HE LOOKS FUN BUT I TOLD MYSELF I WOULDN'T PLAY A GENUINELY BROKEN KILLER.
---
~
---
&gt;P3 CLAUDETTE INFECTED BY PLAGUE RUNS UP TO ME AND STANDS RIGHT BESIDE ME. LEADS THE KILLER TO ME WHEN I'M ON DEATH HOOK.
---
&gt;WHY DO PEOPLE MEME ABOUT CLAUDETTES BEING TOXIC IT'S A GODDAMN FUCKING MYSTERY.
---
&gt;DAVID KING BE LIKE *WE'RE GONNA LIVE FOREVER NOISES*
---
&gt;TWO DAVIDS, BOTH RUNNING WGLF
---
&gt;ONE WITH WGLF 1 TAKES HIS TIME TO GO TO THE HOOK STEALTHILY AND THEN HEALS ME AFTER UNHOOK
---
&gt;ONE WITH WGLF 3 SPRINTS TO THE HOOK AND THEN IMMEDIATELY LEAVES WHEN HE DOESN'T GET THE UNHOOK
---
&gt;WHAT ESPECIALLY PISSES ME OFF IS THAT WGLF 3 DAVID LEAD THE KILLER TO THE BASEMENT, AND I WOULD'VE BEEN FULLY HEALED IF HE HAD HEALED ME INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY BEFORE THE KILLER CAME
---
&gt;ALSO WGLF 3 DAVID SUICIDES ON FIRST HOOK AFTER BEING FOLLOWED AS HE SPRINTS INTO THE BASEMENT TO UNHOOK WGLF 1 DAVID
---
&gt;SWF ABUSING WAKE UP WHILE ONE OF THEM IS GIVING THEM 24/7 INFORMATION WITH OBJECT OF OBSESSION. CAN'T KILL OOO BECAUSE OF SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST.
---
&gt;GET A 3K AND STILL DON'T PIP BECAUSE LOL 3 GENS DONE IN 3 SECONDS BECAUSE OF WAKE UP EXPLOIT
---
&gt;CAN PLAYERS WHO SUICIDE ON FIRST HOOK/DOWN BEFORE A SINGLE GEN IS DONE BE INSTANTLY AND PERMANENTLY BANNED FROM THE GAME?
---
it doesnt.
---
Maybe a button that lets the survivor rapidly drain his bleed-out timer when downed? It lets the killer do honest hooks and moris as normal, but helps the survivor avoid game-extending dickery.
---
* Ruins: Best killer perk in game.
---
* BBQ and chili: Good choice if you want more bloodpoints. In term of pure strength there are better choices but for progression its amazing.
---
* Corrupt Intervention: Very good perk to slow down gen rushing.
---
* Hex: Haunted Ground: Imo this is decent in combination with ruins
---
* Pop Goes the Weasel: Decent gen slowing perk
---
* Save the Best for Last: Very good perk to improve chases
---
* Thrilling Tremors: Kinda better than BBQ, but whitout the bloodpoints.
---
So a build i like is: Ruins, CI, SBFL, Haunted
---
The only thing I DC aginst is insta hatchet and red button region
---
People don't know what tunneling is until they have played as the obsession against a killer with dying light.
---
who watch this loser anyway :)
---
Have you ever played as Freddy tho?
---
It is good to check for it if your teammates can't deal with it, but yeah the main point of ruin is to stall the game, if they can hit their skill checks it's a very effective counter
---
Sooooooo... the longer queue times are normal?
---
It's strange that it's not even adressed at all.
---
I usually run addons that increase their duration and speed of her ability so I really don‚Äôt know how the beads work
---
How am I being a dick? Not my fault she's shit. And she even had her NOED crutch at the end and tried to bloodlust me but still failed.
---
really, I have never encountered that.
---
I feel like Amanda is honestly the best one from the series for the Entity to lure in anyway. John actually wanted people to survive his traps and appreciate their lives, and Hoffman stayed a bit more true to that vision. Amanda rigged traps that made them impossible to get out of, she just wanted to kill.
---
Then neither is tunneling
---
Entity said, sorry my bad. Here you go. 
---
Also why you shake so much while running? lol
---
BHVR: HEY LETS LOAD UP A KILLER WITH LIKE 3 OR 4 POWERS FROM OTHER KILLERS WITH NONE OF THEIR WEAKNESSES 
---
KILLER MAINS: OH YEAH THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE AND BALANCED ANYONE COMPLAINING SHOULD GIT GUD 
---
ALSO BHVR: LETS MAKE A PERK THAT REWARDS DARING SURVIVORS AND THOSE WITH AGGRESSIVE PLAYSTYLES BY PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK FOR A FREE HIT DOWN THE LINE
---
KILLER MAINS: WOW GG DBD IS GOING DOWN THE SHITTER I JUST CANT PLAY ANYMORE WITH THE STATE THE GAME IS IN
---
Thank god for this hotfix. Finally I can actually run my Wake Up end game build without people calling me a piece of shit even though I was using the perk way before it was bugged.
---
Thank you BHVR
---
Dbd needs to be remade from the ground up.
---
There is a sound that plays when you're phase walking. It sounds like a vaccum. The beads get rid of that, so all you have to do is phase walk over to a gen that survivors are working on, and you can think tham off the gens.
---
You sound like a killer main who gets salty if they dont 4k.....try new strategies because the ones you're using arent working if you cant get anyone.
---
Or you could just get better and learn how to add pressure onto survivors instead of getting mad over them doing their only objective
---
just noticed that. I suppose the Spirit who took advantage of it the other night will be happy.
---
exactly, and thats why the game is balanced since all these things buy or make the killer or survivor lose time, finally we ended this jurney, thanks for making me use my brain and for you to not just get stupid and all sweary on this conversation.
---

I tried so hard
---
Lol no. In red ranks experienced survivors don't heal immediately. Better bring bond, you will have all the map awareness, see when people are going for saves, which gens are being done and you will be able to get heals. Or just bring a medkit and use adrenaline instead of self care.
---
they are fixing it once dedicated servers come
---
;)
---
I didn't realize he needed to become more potent, Ghost face is still doing well. The only thing you can argue about lowering his lethality was not being able to stalk exposed survivors anymore, which is fair, since you were able to theoretically have a survivor exposed indefinitely for an entire 1 or even 2+ minute chase until you 1-hit them.
---
I can get people, that‚Äôs not the problem. It‚Äôs just I find Haddonfield the most stressful map to play on.
---
I‚Äôve gotten plenty of 4k‚Äôs, 3k‚Äôs, etc. on the map it‚Äôs just I never really find it that fun.
---
I am
---
did they fix the legion bullshit as well?
---
wake up teachable basically doesnt exist, since it was a carppy perk until the bug came along so no one used it unless their Quentin wasnt leveled enough to have something else.
---
Bought Dead Hard since I haven't played David yet.  Good 2000 shards spent.
---
I for one would play doctor every day instead of spirit.Chases are so unfun with her.No counterplay whatsoever.
---
cool I can start using it cause I like it
---
You wish lmao There are a whole bunch of other bugs right now, mainly around Hag.
---
Barely
---
BIG MOOD.
---
There was actually a bunch of fanmade body pillows of like, ALL THE characters at the time (Bill included) and they all looked better than the official ones :( I can't find all of them atm but here's The Trapper [https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f5/a4/14/f5a41437573aa68f6b72f0891750e947.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/f5/a4/14/f5a41437573aa68f6b72f0891750e947.jpg)
---
So hows Billy in third tier? You literally hear his chainsaw from the opposite side of the map lol
---
I JUST HAD THE SAME THING A FEW HOURS AGO. PROXIMITY CAMPED BY A MYERS AFTER UNHOOKING THE REST OF MY DAMN TEAM ALL GAME, ONLY TO GET ONE HOOKED WHILE NO ONE MADE ANY EVEN VAGUE ATTEMPT AT SAVING ME. FUCK SURVIVORS, AND WHILE I'M HERE, FUCK KILLERS TOO. YOU ALL FUCKING SUCK.
---
Fix it and ban them. They knew they weren't supposed to abuse it.
---
Now *that* is what I would have really wanted to see as a video :O
---
I literally have not seen a SINGLE person say he needs a nerf. Why do people keep saying this?
---
BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE TOLD BY BHVR A FIX WAS IN THE WORKS AND ANYONE USING IT AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD BE BANNED AND PEOPLE STILL USED IT
---
I've not bought GF but how come you weren't revealed when they were looking at you the whole time, up until the chase started?
---
‚ÄúNot knowing anything about the game‚Äù 
---
*has barbecue, nurses, insidious and noed*
---
Excuse me? Pig's stun sound is so cute, and she ROARS
---
It's just a shit post it's not based on how they effect gameplay
---
I got no clue. I really didn‚Äôt even realize I did that till I started to record moments like this üòÇ Guess it‚Äôs just like a fidget type of thing.
---
My bad should have been in dinosaur tier
---
For a second i thought it was Bran the Broken at the end of got
---
Yep that's pretty much how it goes unfortunately. You can have the same perk show up multiple times and 1 perk like BBQ&amp;Chili show up only twice
---
Wraiths stun sound is hilarious to me for some reason
---
You want to play sometimes?
---
Its about 10 percent "perfect". Terrible community topped with horrible balancing and just the worst survivors i have ever seen. This game is actually quite garbage.
---
Ghostfaces sound is just a Dad that is disappointed that their son has a F in class which makes him S tier
---
HEY, KILLERS. HOW ABOUT YOU STOP FUCKING FACE CAMPING? I DON'T BM, I HAVE NEVER ONCE TEABAGGED A KILLER, I DON'T ACT TOXIC, DON'T TAKE YOUR IMPOTENT RAGE OUT ON ME.
---
SURVIVORS, MAYBE STOP TEABAGGING CONSTANTLY? I WRECK YOUR WHOLE FUCKING TEAM, OPEN THE GATE FOR YOU, AND CARRY YOU TO THE EXIT AND YOU FUCKING TEABAG ME? FUCK YOU, SHITBAG.  I HOPE YOU STEP ON A LEGO. 
---
ALSO, WHILE I'M HERE, TO THE GHOSTFACE WHO JUST MORIED MY ENTIRE TEAM ON BADHAM... NICE JOB. YOU EARNED THAT ONE. GOOD WORK.
---
Me too tbh, would actually make it and FC viable together, especially on killers that can instadown.
---
I dont play since long time and I got on a game where the killer added one of the survivors, he told us the killer is friendly and want to farm with us, so I used my cake and stuff, I got hook 3 times in a row and I uninstalled the game ( to reinstall later on ) fucking game triggers me
---
Now I can't play the game
---
Reporting to your imaginary friend?

Pathetic.

Um.......shit.

You got me there.

XD
---
To be fair I saw way more fellow survivors abusing Wake Up than I did killers abusing PWYF.
---
Or adrenaline because he game got you hype lol
---
yas gawd! this bear will be my main ;)
---
I got stuck in the roof of the pale rose after i left the locker as the killer swung, i died up there very slowly
---
Got you hooked, eh?
---
Reminds me of pubg
---
I think it‚Äôs supposed to insinuate high cheekbones
---
Thanks, I had nothing better to do.
---
Nope!!
---
Time for some ***KOBE ACTION!!!***
---
*Respect the 4%, biotch*
---
I know I was just joking xP
---
Gen rushing is when survivors focus on gens. Therefore, when survivors focus on gens... they are gen rushing. In normal games the survivors don‚Äôt strictly focus on gens. Therefore, there is a difference between survivors focusing on gens and not focusing on gens. So there is a difference between gen rushing and not gen rushing.
---
This is amazing
---
The survivor doesn't get the extra progress for the great skillcheck. So just denying the greats makes ruin better than every other game slowing perk. Add the regression on goods and it's far better than a flat speed reduction.
---
Please don't abuse this, it is a bug that will likely be fixed. Abusing it would be like legion using double blades a few patches ago, or like survivors using wake up before this latest patch today. It is an exploit that will make people view you as a scumbag for using it
---
You could just order one from a body pillow company that offers custom prints.
---
Ace gave you the demon eyes
---
**NO**^^^(ED)
---
I wish laurie's hair actually looked this good in game :c
---
No need to feel dumb. You just learned something! You're very welcome.
---
For the killer side specifically, this is normal. A lot of people are trying to play Ghost Face right now and there's simply not enough survivors to fill their lobbies. This should gradually return to normal over time.
---
he is
---
New player here but I haven't had a crash or graphical problem yet :o
---
At first glance it kinda looks like ash is carrying anna to the hook
---
It finished, for some reason it needed to be restarted but imagine it didn't? Lol
---
I‚Äôve never seen it happen as a killer, but every time I‚Äôve been a survivor and successfully Kobe‚Äôd I‚Äôve been immediately knocked down. So I would say, no not a lot of people respect the 4%
---
I love it when that one survivor just cautiously approaches you trying to discern if your gonna kill them too
---
What I hate is when people let a guy progress to stage two and then I accidentally kill that guy because why would I be keeping track of that in a farm game
---
I love Huntress just for her comforting hums.
---
You can only respect it, if they respect you. Otherwise, ...... end them.
---
Sir it seems you‚Äôve mistaken this post as your business. You should mind your own business next time
---
Yeah you are probably right. I just hit 9k so I might just buy hag so I can have ruin and devour hope. I hope deliverance comes on a shrine soon. I know it was on once this year already
---
puremagic22
---
Umm why?
---
Because Tbagging doesn't actually net any benefit and puts the dumbass at a disadvantage if they do it midchase.
---
Because genrushing isn't real. If you are not applying good gen pressure, then run Ruin.
---
Because tunnelling effectively means that a player doesn't even get the chance to play the game at all. They get to wait 30 minutes for a lobby to sit there and do nothing on the ground on hook. Yay.
---
Hey all I‚Äôm saying is; Mood
---
the ghostface update also broke spawn locations again. I regularly find it within 10-15 seconds of walking from my starting point if I'm survivor, and when I'm killer, I often find survivors on top of it right away when I run to it, or it even blows before I can get there.
---
I mean yeah, people are different. Glad you found a comfortable setup for yourself though.
---
I wanna play too... I‚Äôm on pc. Dm me (:
---
you forgot our newbie, Asthma Boi
---
LMAO how do I upvote twice?
---
&gt;No because it is usually never a 4%, either deliverance or salty lips
---
You can tell the difference between 4% and Deliverance.
---
Weird. I'm on PS4 and I did not have the low chase music thing, and wondered what the hell people are talking about. Until this update. Now it's low as hell.
---
cool
---
I can‚Äôt tell you why someone chooses to be a bitch only can inform you that the mods are a bunch of bitches
---
You are a trash human being
---
but they glow, how am I not supposed to touch it?
---
About to kill these cuties! #pig #killer #badhairday #dbd
---
The fucking hit to drop the pallet killed me
---
I'd be an angry terrorist too if I found out my fav killer was being discriminated against
---
Lmao, what happened man?
---
I had this happen too a survivor left in the middle of the sound and it kept playing for the rest of the game
---
def not, his add-ons are more awful than ever
---
That‚Äôs true but whenever I see someone pull themselves off a hook it‚Äôs almost always deliverance. If not, usually luck offerings or perks. Haven‚Äôt seen a legit 4% since I last did it as survivor a few months ago.
---
Maybe cuz their not broken and wake up was? Lol
---
i play kate and i can confirm im kind of an idiot. xD
---
Welcome to the fog
---
No he‚Äôs still amazing because every time I go against him he rips me a new one
---
Hey all I‚Äôm saying is Every mod for this sub smell like sewer water
---
&gt;Look at the patch notes (sort by Hot, not New).
---
The patch notes also pop in your face when you get to the main menu for the first time after updating DBD.
---
It‚Äôs working for me ? I‚Äôm playing right this second, well a match is loading
---
Same way as u could use other perks than Hex Ruin...
---
Definitely a joke lol
---
I did pretty much the same thing to a Dwight in a recent game. Went barrelling through the corn fields and the Dwight was repairing the gen in the fields, this was a solid 30s in to the game. Ran him the hell over and he dced before he hit the ground. Was amazing.
---
What they did was be some cunts
---
Oh i realize that might be too OP, so we could balance it by making survivors invisible to the killer while its cloaked. But you can still see scratch marks.
---
I already have doctor and I‚Äôm not a killer main so that‚Äôs good. I need bp so Legion might be good and spirit does seem like she needs time but very good. Thx
---
Accidentally? :^)
---
Same as Ruin then?
---
This must be some kind of bug because I literally can't play, this sucks dude.
---
"Dear Ash,
---
I wanted to send you this friendly little letter to inform you of your imminent demise. If you're curious about the frequency of which I've sent these letters, it is merely to instill as much fear as I can. As if basting a turkey. Which I will then proceed to have sex with. THAT'S RIGHT. I'M GOING TO FUCK THE FEAR TURKEY. Follow me on Twitter @GhostfaceKillr
---
Sincerely, Ghost Face
---
Or deadhard
---
You get the most bloodpoints playing killer and using the perk BBQ and Chili.
---
Please,,,search for it again friend,,,I need to see my waifus ;;
---
God damnit reddit, put in a [Noparse] tag or something so I can make my faces in peace
---
Who's shirtless David when we could have Jake with a bra? BHVR when pls?
---
Tbh I teabag a lot and when I do play killer (rare) I just laugh
---
Ahh its all Ghostface balances and bug fixes
---
That's incredibly TMI and incredibly amazing at the same time
---
I downvote posts and comments I don‚Äôt agree with. Which is the entire point of the system.
---
You assuming why I dislike a map like you know everything about me when you‚Äôre wrong is when I downvote you. I‚Äôve played this game since the beta and followed it through thick and thin, supporting the devs as much as I can since this is one of my favorite games of all time.
---
I‚Äôve experienced first hand all the changes and fixes this game as seen throughout its entire history. Looping was never a problem with me, the old pallet vacuum was a pain but that‚Äôs it.
---
Haddonfield was created when Dead by Daylight was still very new. And as a result I don‚Äôt agree with the gameplay direction of the map and I think it could use a few tweaks.
---
The ability to hit survivors over fence walls is annoying. 
---
The over abundance of balanced landing survivors who only repair the upper floor gens last to abuse the power of the perk on the map is annoying.
---
The amount of line-of-sight blockers that can completely deny stealth killers a creative approach is annoying. 
---
How easy it is to get gen locked on the map due to dumb teammates is also annoying.
---
There are a lot of reasons to dislike a map. I‚Äôm not salty because I‚Äôm getting looped. It‚Äôs gameplay at this point what else are survivors supposed to do, just die? No. That‚Äôs stupid and anybody who thinks looping should be removed is dumb. I just feel like they could take steps somehow to reduce loops on the map similar to how they‚Äôre adding more pallets and smaller loops to Badham.
---
That is it. Get your head out of your ass and don‚Äôt assume you know why I have the opinion that you do.
---
why is this marked news? there's always been salty nerds this isnt new
---
Have you seen her ass?  Of course she does!
---
Myers with a bra?
---
They owe you 64 cents
---
Just like it isn‚Äôt news your mom will never love you
---
Sir this is a wendy's
---
That's our way to jumpscare the killer
---
Definitely worth buying, the easiest way to get bloodpoints is by using a perk for survivors called we're gonna live forever and a perk for killer called Bbq and Chili. Both of these perks increase bloodpoint gain by percentages based on certain actions done in game, but be warned it will take a long time to get them, and by the time you are higher level you will care less for taking up a slot with them over using a better perk
---
Sloppy and thanta arent bugged. Wake up was bugged not buffed.
---
Sir this isn‚Äôt your business
---
I have an idea for a knight based on some old post back when Plauge wasn't released and everyone didn't know about her and was guessing on what the killer would be like.
---
Essentially the power would be something akin to Billy's power but with some differences.
---
Lung range is as good as hag to make up for Knights slower base movement speed.
---
Power name Knights Charge
---
Readying your shield you charge forth at faster speed damaging anyone in your way.
---
Differences with Billy's version
---
Slower movement speed
---
Better turning
---
Quieter but still somewhat noisy due to the clanking sound from the knights armor 
---
Has a power meteor that will stun knight after using it similar to nurse and legion.
---
Will only injury and not down survivors when hit.
---
Can break through pallets.
---
Will keep moving even after hitting survivors or pallets.
---
glad to see someone else who hates facing billy, nothing is more tilting then every 3 gens being a 3 gen and billy just sitting on your ass revving.
---
Yo how the FU
---
Playing any killer with Barbecue &amp; Chili (Cannibal's perk) is the easiest way to get bloodpoints. 
---
Balance wise it has never been this easy for killer, which is good for one part and not so much for the other, if you play survivor. Playing survivor still is the stronger role but definitely requires more skill than it used to.
---
Yeah I main killer and if I get "gen rushed" its cause I didn't protect the gens well enough. And ofc I'm going to go after the 1hook injured dwight over the flashlight clicking Claudette everytime.
---
Outstanding move
---
I'm having the same issue, I literally cannot get into the game.
---
Ok, thanks for your helpüôÇ
---
The most important part of his power (stalking and one shotting) was nerfed while the least important part of his power (killer instinct) was buffed.  He can be more easily taken out of his power and his stalk addons were all nerfed (in fact, they were nerfed more than originally since they now don‚Äôt affect lean stalking at all).
---
That too. But, since they were here.......
---
Too much to read. 
---
Being concise makes it easier for everyone.
---
The long short of it, youre a salty killer.
---
How to rebind steering?
---
That‚Äôs a pro gamer move if I‚Äôve ever seen one
---
You‚Äôre on timeout still
---
Woah, he's gonna fuck the fear turkey? No one's ever done that...
---
There are multiple reasons for this. The first being survivors‚Äô skill has increased over time.  Whether it be mechanic improvement or even map/environment memory, survivors have gotten much better. 
---
Rank system has also provided a larger gap in the quality of survivors.  While keeping previously higher ranked players into tiers below them and having only the very talented players reach high ranks, it creates much tougher games for killers.  
---
Also, don‚Äôt forget rank reset. You‚Äôre much more apt to have a tougher time after rank reset, so you might be only concentrating on the last week+. 
---
Finally, there has been updates in the game that you might not gave become acclimated to, yet. This will either take time, or might be something you can never hurdle. Either way, it does bring challenge. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs a combination of a multitude of factors that gave caused this game to feel more difficult for killers/you ‚Äúsucking‚Äù.
---
They accidentally swapped out the grass texture for the mobile version
---
Ok. So im gonna say im gonna say youre a whinny bitch.
---
based on this its very clear you havent played in anything higher than rank 17...
---
omg, cry some more you made it everyone's business by being a little bitch.
---
if they struggle to get free I hook them, otherwise I drop them by the hatch
---
You got a stutter or some shit ?
---
A game that I can play with friends. Most of my friends are into different games than me.
---
Ok...so youre a whinny bitch who cant read?
---
Looking forward to 200% bonus XP in 97 years
---
Happy Camper: While Hooked and the killer is within a 24m range, other survivors gain a 15% action speed boost to repair.
---
Yeah. You shouldn‚Äôt be letting him stalk you that long, twice.
---
Exactly... why do so many get triggered... considering there're 2 killers who can tbag.. I say get over it.
---
Okay....so you‚Äôre a whinny bitch who can‚Äôt mind his business?
---
By posting here you made it anyone who sees your post their business, moron. If you don‚Äôt want people ‚Äúin your business‚Äù keep your comments and opinions confined to private messages.
---
He thought you were on his team cause you had killer Jeff face!
---
Ok? What did they do to you? Lol.
---
Who was the killer playing as
---
Or or and hear me out you could mind your business and go back to your moms basement
---
You know what? If you explained why this isnt my business I shut up.
---
Fckn millenial.
---
Can we talk about the fact that ducking bitches didn‚Äôt ban him yet from here üòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
Especially since it takes some skill to get chased and find time to teabag like??? Congrats man
---
I didn't see people here complain about GF being OP. I don't think any high ranks thinks he was OP before.

I have a fondness for the 3rd one, but yeh, that second movie is pretty awful. 4 wasn‚Äôt great either, and I hear 5 is pure trash
---
Lmao nice copy of recently exploding reddit post on this subreddit
---
These are not even big buffs lol they are QoL changes and I‚Äôm kinda surprised the devs have not added them..as for the recovery I could take it or leave it..it just kinda bothers me that he‚Äôs really easy to break out now and it just takes so long to get it back without add ons
---
I played one round with it -- I was told to take a good toolbox, wake up, and Prove Thyself.
---
It was hilarious how fast gens were getting done.
---
I let the killer catch me and kill me, it was too unrealistic to expect even great killers to handle that kind of hilarity.
---
By commenting on this thread you‚Äôve made everyone who sees it kno that your incapable of minding your own business you can start by not being so worried about what I‚Äôn posting

This idea is good but i'd prefer if this activated only 10 seconds after being hooked or else its a bit strong.

Probably rule 4'd a post if anything.

Yay

When I say high ranks I mean like 11-20 lol I should have said that..I‚Äôve seen people complaining on the dbd forums and I‚Äôve seen 1-4 posts saying he‚Äôs to strong on here as well
---
‚ÄúGo back to your mom‚Äôs basement‚Äù
---
   - Sent from u/CaptainCakes3 moms basement.
---
Thanks, good feedback.
---
I COMPLETELY GOD-DAMN AGREE
---
Not arguing with someone who is salty about not getting kills because hes getting looped.
---
I am pleb. Quick summary of rule 4?
---
Me and the boys getting morried
---
I FUCKING HATE GODDAMN SWF GROUPS WITH 1.5K HOURS IN THIS GAME I HAVE 70 HOURS WHY AM I GETTING MATCHED WITH THESE AND WHEN THEY START  TO LOSE THEY DC I HATE THIS SWEATY SURVIVOR MAINS SO MUCH
---
I‚Äôd rank them as 1. First movie 2. Third movie 3. Fourth movie 4. Second movie
---
Dude you can‚Äôt just steal my joke it‚Äôs uncreative and kinda lazy do better
---
Woah This was a whiplash wtf like when I first got the game... so young and na√Øve.
---
I could be wrong but I believe its low effort posts. Like just putting a photo of anything and the title is "when killer spots you"
---
Lmao get a load of this guy.
---
kinda ruins the game doesnt it...
---
Reddit: Haha furrys are weird
---
Also reddit: this shit
---
Replace this with the "It goes down" meme template. She looks at them and they are normal with nothing. She looks back and they are P3 Clauds and Neas with flashlights
---
Ur funny:) nvm ur not ur unoriginal bitch who deserves to get morid every game bitch, I hope next game u get the most toxic killer ever that will be hook camping and tunneling u bitch go DIE
---
I just got freddy today since his DLC is on sale for 3.99...  hes fun to play as.. but that 7 second timer is a pain in the ass.. I put on that bluedress addon so they couldnt anap out so fast.. but they were snapping out so quickly. Does it even work? Lol
---
Go back? I never left pussy. you put it on a public forum are you retarded?  now I just want to talk shit on account of I think you need to toughen up. so what's the problem cry baby? did the mod tell you know and you can't handle it?
---
Oh. Alot of rule 4 breaking on this sub then lol.
---
I said mods not vestingboot if I wanted input I woulda asked for it I put this here for the mods to see and let them kno they some bitches
---
Yeah, some posts get past modes, others are sometimes taken down in an instant.
---
And I hope someday you stop being a disappointment to the human race
---
It isnt because killers want easier games... you forget this is a horror game, where you shouldnt be able to trust anyone and the fear of being alone and against all four other people here is a serious threat. Because when its you or them, they will not pick you
---
If you would even bother to read my post you'd see that that's not the case at all. You're just still continuing to assume why I don't like the map like an idiot.
---
You're a very silly kinda guy, you know. You can act like the reply doesn't exist, but anyone else who reads it is just going to laugh at you.
---
that was cool, but like, dont use pallets like that
---
Until you miss it :(
---
Okay, I see. So like add an addition 10/15/20% to the speedboost. I gotcha
---
This happened to me when I was playing against trapper at the very beginning of the round not too long ago. Trapper was stuck at very first pallet. I (a fellow killer main) didn't have the heart to let him suffer so I fast vaulted a couple times as he was released. He proceeded to 4k and thanked me after. Fun round.
---
I‚ÄôM A WOMAN OF MY WORD
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Kind of. Reply to the person you replied to
---
other people snap you out of the dream world..  
---
One of the big issues with Freddy is failed skill checks also take you out of the dream world.  
---
walk over to a gen, fail the skill-check and you are out... I have had a few people just sit on the gen during transition and just kept getting "lucky" with the checks and i could not get them to transition
---
‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù
---
A baby Dwight, literally.
---
A good nurse will destroy everyone... Also a LF can be "juked" by hugging objects and hoping he hits them. It's all opinion obviously but good nurses are absolutely garbage to go against because there is nothing you can do.
---
Anyone sensible knew it wasn‚Äôt an actual nerf. People just overreacted.
---
Been trying to get a selfie for a while but I have no friends on PS4 lmao
---
Nice to see my 3 mains are known as the giggle boys
---
Correct. We knew this was going to be an adjustment for the overall better. People pretended to call it a nerf because they overacted.
---
: ^ )
---
WAAAAAAHHHHHH
---
It really all depends on your perks too, like I said Gen rushing and looping is a problem for Wratih; but as you said you negated out the looping.
---
Survivors as killers mode when
---
Big brain plays
---
Did you close hatch?
---
Lucky Rush- when you unhook yourself you gain the endurance status effect and a speed boost for  10/13/16 seconds.
---
he should have magic which would be cool, How many killers are the developers planning because I hope we get a vampire and knight at some point
---
Hbu?
---
Was it fixed? :0 this was yesterday, i was showing my friend how broken wake up was in KYF and also he was teaching me how to do a 360 but i failed miserably.
---
Played some Survivor. Things sound better, just heartbeat is a bit muffled.
---
She is definitely not one of the easiest killers in the game, but she is pretty good. The gens will still get done really fast if she doesn't have prayer beads though.
---
I'll duck behind objects and still get exposed by people running away. Baffling.
---
Happened to me today too, similar situation, spirit got stuck in a pallet and teammates started teabagging and doing gens and so I slow vaulted and she grabbed me mid vault, she 3k‚Äôd that game and took me to the hatch.
---
‚ÄúA perk was fun when it didn‚Äôt work as intended, how could you fix it back to working order?‚Äù 
---
Dude what?
---
Dude there are litterly people complaining 24/7 abaut genrushing and T-baging.
---
I'm scared.
---
I have low quality because my pc can't run this game in higer qualities.
---
found the furry 
---
but seriously though: I‚Äôm 100% ok with furries uwu
---
Nobody wants nerfs that I've seen they just want QoL improvements. The area and range to break him out of Night Shroud is super inconsistent.
---
You need 1 more person to do so, It means less match progress for the survivors.
---
If you're the killer, making pressure on survivors, they won't have time for generators, so that means less progress for them too.
---
A good example: Tru3Talent, he uses ruin quite often, but he uses some builds without it too, focusing on anti-loop, so he can hook ppl faster, resulting less generators done.
---
It's all about a point of view.I gotta admit that everytime I run a build w/o ruin, I get gen rushed quickly, but sometimes It's the opposite, pressure on match = less generators done.
---
Yeah you can get out by slow vaulting and being grabbed by the killer too
---
Boi he silent now.
---
Only got one match against him, but he could be top tier now...
---
Saying ‚Äútypically Americans are self centered‚Äù then saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not calling all Americans self centered‚Äù is a bit odd.  Your original comment implied you believed all Americans are self centered.  Not saying it‚Äôs true, but the wording was implying it.
---
that‚Äôs some BS
---
That might be a little too *groovy*.
---
Even if all 4 people had MoM, there‚Äôs only 8 safe unhooks to go around. You would almost need BT just to ensure your idiot teammate stays up long enough to even get a stack.
---
Not sure what magic he could use.
---
Maybe something that increase action speed
---
Vengeance: If you get hooked for the third time, and nobody else in the trial got hooked, instantly switch place between yourself and the Killer -&gt; Killer becomes the hooked dead survivor, and you become the killer. (The killer will obviously probably lose a survivor pip).
---
This is what people are calling for. The detection is very inconsistent on both sides.
---
Worst list ever. How can you place pig anywhere but top tier. 
---
Downvoted.
---
What‚Äôs funny is it actually *benefits* the survivor if a killer camps a full hook. But a typical rank 12 whiny survivor can‚Äôt wrap their head around that.
---
I put addons that made it harder to get skill checks and it doesnt work.. It was a pain
---
Guessing you're a Badger fan...
---
The sounds of the throw up makes me sick
---
*palette~~*
---
Nobody said it was toxic, did they?  
---
OP pointed out the double standard and you're leaning right into it.
---
That is wild
---
The only perks that affect generators are Prove Thyself, Resiliance, This is not Happening, Stake Out and Spine Chill. Prove Thyself only removes the penalty (so it doesn't actually increase speed), Resiliance is 9% so it doesn't even remove the penalty, Spine Chill same, and Stake Out and TiNH are rarely used, especially the second one which is useless and should be combined with Resiliance.
---
Still hear no chase music or chainsaws/blinks etc
---
You missed the bug where you cant exit the level as a survivor. 
---
You fall off the edge of the map by the bonfire and telport back into the level.
---
Not too mention you get stuck crouching near trees and cant move.
---
Oh oh oh and another lovely bug where the survivor cant heal, drop pallets, basically 0 meters pop up. 
---
And my new favorite! Just got picked up by a killer for the first time and boom.....instant decisive strike. Man this game is so good.
---
Keep up the solid work guys. A mobile port was necessary!
---
Plenty of people have Calle fit toxic and it‚Äôs pretty fucking obvious OP is trying to compare ‚Äútoxic‚Äù things. Don‚Äôt be pedantic.

---
You're a dick
---
Pig low tier? Downvote.
---
Most people want to have fun. Going into every match just to latch on to a gen the whole time isn't the ideal match for everyone. People loot, people totem hunt, people save, people do gens, people run the killer etc. Everyone plays a different way and as long as they're having a good time it's worth it.
---
Each person only needs one.
---
Body-block while Killer's carrying (1 stack), heal up, unhook with Borrowed (2 stacks), take a hit and MoM is active.
---
I would say you should be banned, but then I noticed it's KYF lol That build would be fun in a 1v1.
---
Hate to break it to you, but noone cares what this conversation is about. You are on a dbd reddit. Laugh at me and downvote away.

Youre just upset and its ok.
---
I HAD A DAILY TO MORI WITH HUNTRESS SO I USED DEVOUR HOPE AND AN EBONY MORI TO MAKE SURE I COULD COMPLETE IT BECAUSE I HATE PLAYING AS HER. THE SURVIVORS WERE TERRIBLE AND I ENDED UP STOMPING THEM AND ONE CRYBABY ENDED UP REPORTING MY GAMERTAG AS OFFENSIVE TO XBOX AND THEY DELETED MY NAME. HOW SALTY DO YOU HAVE TO BE? RIP POOTIETAINT... YOU WILL BE MISSED :(
---
The rank 17 killers are out in full force today, who apparently don‚Äôt know Ruin, Plague, Doctor, Discordance, Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby, POP Goes The Weasel, Corrupt Intervention all exist...
---
I laughed like a teapot on a stove at this.
---
Gave me a genuine laugh.
---
Legion is a pipping machine
---
FUCK YOU TOO, BUDDY!
---
WHERE TF IS MY FENG MIN BALLERINA COSMETIC
---
Is it you're not your?
---
Then punish them for wasting perk slots? Or if you‚Äôre really worried, use any of the MYRIAD of perks, fuck even KILLERS, who specialize in slowing gens..... it‚Äôs not that hard.
---
Why though?
---
Oh thank fuck. I hope these actually fixed the audio bugs. That was the worst part. My hearing is already bad and the buggy audio really hurts at times cause I keep having to adjust my sound.
---
very true lol, even when you only get 1 kill you usually dont depip
---
IM ALSO ON XBOX, NOT GETTING CAMPED BUT TUNNELLED EVERY SINGLE GAME.
---
PS4 REPORTING IN. SAME PROBLEM. I'VE PLAYED AGAINST MAYBE THREE GFS THAT DIDN'T FACE CAMP SO TIGHT THEY SAW MOLARS.

I‚Äôll do this almost every game
---
Honestly, would've been ok with the Wake Up perk affecting action speed once the generators were powered or EGC was activated. Might actually be a useful perk at that point. Right now it just sits in the occasional late game build.
---
Look at the chat.
---
A Myers running NOED, that has to be rank 20
---
Plunderer's backpack: survivor can pick up and escape with one additional item.
---
You'd think, but he was Rank 6
---
It cures my boredom since it is quite a fun game even with its flaws.
---
What finally worked for me, after the nth-time of resetting and restarting, was turning off the Xbox and unplugging the power and internet for a few moments, plugging it all back in and starting up again. The game finally booted after that hard reset
---
Oh...
---
*killer picks up survivor In swf once*
---
‚ÄúSurvivors.....assemble.‚Äù *flashlight clicking*
---
Oh god it's a bubba main
---
Revealing rage: when within 10/15/24 meters of a generator, you can see if it‚Äôs being worked on when the aura turns blue. Damaged generators also regress 4/9/13 percent faster.
---
Prepare for the worst.
---
"This will hurt me more then you..."
---
You can determinate hook sabotage progress by the intensity of their aura. Once per trial when you are hooked on a hook with 90/80/70% sabotage progression the hook breaks freeing you and stunning the killer for 3/4/5 seconds.
---
(Keep in mind that it cannot be used on death hooked since you still count as hooked and in case of 3rd hook you die instantly)
---
DC'ing is better than staying in a bad game and getting high blood pressure.

I would've farmed at that point.

I see what you did there

Ok, keep using Wake Up, now that is fixed. Really, keep using it, you exploiter.

He has add ons that decrease his detection range.

Exactly! Like I said before I only seen 3 people using it playing random solo, not sure about SWF on PS4 and allot of people on console don‚Äôt come to this sub reddit. But it was only for a week, so it probably wasn‚Äôt that detrimental and was 15% that‚Äôs a fart in the wind. Yah I heard teams were going in on PC  it the cards have turned once again and it‚Äôs back to normal, now if it was leader that was broke like wake up wasI could see that being a huge mayor problem. But BhVR got on this and patched it and yes if they are gonna suspend or ban they need to put a in game message in the news so people know when they login.
---
I would always use urban evasion as a way to escape chases. Sprint burst away and if I can manage to break line of sight at some point UE around some obstacles and hopefully lose the killer. 
---
I can understand a lot of people tend to use it as a crutch however and play a more tentative game which means they aren‚Äôt pulling their weight. I‚Äôve also seen plenty of people that give no regard to stealth and just run around right in front of the killer and go down 2 minutes into match and dc on hook.....but hey UrBaN EvAsIoN MeAnS YoUr BaD.
---
But BPS are ever lasting. They were given the gift of eternal life. Once the event is over your precious gateaus will be no more...
---
I see boobs tho
---
Same here man. Can't wait for the dedicated servers.
---
A little context on the screenshot. Full team of new players. I ended up hooking them all twice before more than 1 gen was even touched. Felt bad after killing 2 of them and realized only 1 gen was tapped so I let the other two go. All of my games have turned out this way these past few days because I don't want to just bully new players.
---
It‚Äôs the first time I try to slug, anyway I‚Äôm rank 16 so I‚Äôm going to kill all survivors no matter what I use
---
No directional sound cue is huge, I've noticed I get a lot more initial stalk off now and catch more people off guard.
---
Make sure it doesnt stack with flip flop
---
"You know, I was trying to be a team player.  Trying to be a nice guy!"
---
"You killed _half_ of our friends!"
---
"I said _trying_!"
---
His stun is too short to do that frequently, and as I said, he lose his bloodlust, so in a lot of loops, the time he wastes shocking you, you can just go around the loop and use that pallet later, the only cases that doctor can make a loop useless is against bad survivors that pallet camp, other them that, Survivors almost never fall for a shock stun
---
Nah you cant just exploit and say dont mind it, your an ass dude
---
EST
---
When I accidentally kill a survivor I was farming with, I kill them all to make it look like it was on purpose and I knew exactly what I was doing
---
at the very least the dwight was memeing, notice his head being at a weird angle, he isn't looking directly at ghostface.
---
HEY I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY THAT I'M JUST BAD AND ALL BUT THE FACT IS THAT EVERY SINGLE GHOSTFACE HAS GOTTEN A 4K WITH THE CLOSEST ANYONE GOT TO ESCAPING BEING 4/5 GENS DONE IN EVERY GAME I'VE PLAYED SO FAR, REGARDLESS OF SURVIVOR LEVEL. MAYBE HE'S TOO STRONG?  I DON'T THINK EVERYONE IN THE WORLD SUDDENLY STARTED SUCKING THAT BAD ALL AT ONCE.
---
Me too, also on Xbox.
---
Yes, I noticed that too, still isn't enough to gen grab, but it's something at least
---
IS IT NORMAL FOR THE PARTY TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF LEVEL? ITS FRUSTRATING BEING A SURVIVOR, PAIRED WITH BRAND NEW PLAYERS, AND THE KILLER IS A HIGH LEVEL TWITCH STREAMER
---
Cabatsu cabatsu cabat su
---
Mechanics instinct- You search chests 40/60/80% faster and the first chest opened has a guaranteed toolbox (I thought since pharmacy exists why not have one for a toolbox too?)
---
pig gets her own category: Squeeeeeeeeaaaal (and RaWr x3)
---
I personally think they should increase the amount of gens that need fixing to 8 in the main game, 5 gens is too easy imo.
---
Once you kill one, you can't go back. Finish your job by killing em all
---
Welcome to the joke that is Dead By Daylight matchmaking
---
My favorite are vault hitboxes. Nothing like being 2 feet past the window and getting hit.
---
They have to wait 30 minutes for a lobby? it's more like 30 seconds to a minute
---
Not I. It‚Äôs taking a long time on my end. Coupled with me safety pipping (not a visual bug. Brutal killer, and had the slider reflect this), yet losing a pip post game, I think I‚Äôm going to switch to survivor for the night.
---
Really? What system are you on?
---
Too bad the things are stupidly inconsistent with how often they appear on bloodwebs.  I've leveled a Survivor into his 20's at this point from the event and don't think I've seen a single one pop up for him.  Then while leveling Legion I've been seeing one or two every so many bloodwebs and then will go through multiple levels seeing none.
---
It's a fair list; I think spots 3 and 4 are interchangeable, as they're both pretty bad.
---
What is the first thing you do when the round starts? Do you run to the middle and commit to the first chase for two minutes or do you patrol the gens?
---
Hell no, without changing repair speed, that would be so fucking broken. Just use ruin
---
Did this once and we all agreed in lobby to try and intimidate the killer into leaving us alone.
---
That was a fast game.
---
A fuck ton of drawing inspiration
---
Except the ninety I have saved
---
you kinda are. It is a good counter to noed, but dont let it overwealm you. Gens are more important, and while noed is common, it really isnt common enough to warrant it. But if you guys are in a good place, and you see one, dont feel afraid to cleanse it
---
Ask me if I care
---
Why does He.g look like she just had the most amazing orgasm of her life?
---
Xbox, I really hating this waiting room period, to enter a lobby, to wait for survivors, to wait a minute if none dip out. I feel like I‚Äôm at the doctors office.  I like some realism in video games, ones that harken real life emotions brought on by experiences. However, this is one I can do without.
---
The person who is usually getting tunneled in my games is usually the one who is arse at stealth. Speed vaulting over windows in close proximity. How am I supposed to just ignore them?
---
The survivors are a team bro. Kind of a dick move for expecting me to play like a moron just because survivors are making mistakes.
---
&gt; Added more logging to investigate the ranking issue.
---
Fucking finally. Hopefully they'll fix it soon so I'm not going up against/with players who aren't around my rank.
---
Dude, you just got outplayed. Stop blaming the game, idiot.
---
Rank 16?? Is that a P3 spirit (bloody head)? One of the scariest killers in the damn game.
---
I play red ranks solo queue. Lobby times either take 1 minute or forever. The lobby times are still longer for killer on average in my experience, but in general they just take too long period.
---
Doctor sure is far away from that bottom category...
---
I bet you are still running ruin on every killer.
---
Thank you so much
---
It's just something that comes with repetition. I try to keep track of the hook states every game (as I try to only kill people when everyone is on second hook). Nowadays I don't really have to think about it (untill I come across a team of identically clothed survivors, then I need to actively keep track of them)
---
What‚Äôs Your Favorite Scary Movie? ‚ÄúHard to pick with so many choices!‚Äù At the start of every trial(before game actually starts) pick one out of all the killers, if guessed correctly not only do you now know the killer but also gain a 4/6/8% repair boost for 60 seconds.
---
How do you even figure out if someone is looking to farm? Is there a test? As a killer I just want to kill.
---
Me when the cat comes to me of its own free will
---
https://i.imgur.com/9DEULdI.png
---
Then that'd be far too easy to get the tokens you need. In order to get that powerful ability, you should have to stick your neck out and play risky.
---
Wait so is this actually a change or a bug
---
I've looked behind me numerous times thinking it's the pig when it's a just meg or nea nearby lol.
---
There are different techniques to deal with this. If they are speeding through the gens I try to find the three close gens and let that be the last battle.
---
That Pig has hips and tiddies. People are trippin
---
*doctor giggles intensify*
---
Congrats man
---
TEN MINUTES? IN A FUCKING HOUR A PLAYED 1 TRASH MATCH WHERE I WAS GENRUSHED
---
Those healing sounds are questionable lol
---
always happens when I try to take a hit and I feel like an ass
---
This logic could easily go towards Legion's add-ons too, and every survivor and their mother was fussing about that. Not to mention said Legions could get banned for using those add-ons, too. The survivor bias is real.
---
what's wrong with devour hope?
---
Or even just like a colour. White, yellow, red. Boom.
---
Is there an option to disable it inside the game? or do you mean disabling it outside the game
---
it still takes just as long and you still need as much of his body visible to break his stalk. So I don't see how he's worse off. He can still one shot too.
---
Yeeess. I‚Äôve been going against some brutal Trappers lately so this is even more satisfying
---
Survivor perk: Limber- Allows you to never slow vaunt ( wondering how broken it could be or not be considering you would always give off a noise)
---
This. There's not really a point to *not* surprising survivors. Once a good survivor hears that noise, they'll run away from that window and Bamboozle is pretty much pointless.
---
It‚Äôs a KYF.
---
I‚Äôm so glad that‚Äôs a sarcastic shit post comment
---
It does no show on the UI on the survivor side.
---
[Used it before Ghostface came out and before it was bugged.](https://gyazo.com/3b02fc95f031b780a732783bf8d5162b)
---
[Still using it.](https://gyazo.com/5f7a77ee684b30167bd5deaecc6f6cdd)
---
It is almost if people love running certain builds and have been running them for a while before they become bugged! Such an astounding revelation I imagine!!
---
No idea if it's good, but I like to slow the game down with Ruin + Sloppy, obviously BBQ because BBQ and probably a chase perk (iirc I use enduring)
---
Git gud.
---
I already answeared or first point in another comment.
---
The clones don't show to often and usually are really bad yo tracking
---
One of the best? What? Anyone that you see making a killer rank will put Doctor in the worst tier, can you tell someone worst than him? Maybe wraith, but he is pathetic
---
His addons make his power a lot slower, making it almost useless in the firat cases that you stated.
---
Yea MYC was one of the few that came to mind. I still haven't gotten it in her bloodweb yet though
---
Just get noed and BBQ and you already got yourself a nice rank 10 badge.
---
The first two Scary Movies are the only MEMORABLE ones to begin with. Like, I've seen 3 but remember jack shit about it besides that it's a Grudge/Signs parody
---
Did that comment hurt your feelings ? üò¢
---
Thana is
---
You're not wrong.
---
Though I never get that flashlight save to go off
---
How so
---
Why is he pissed at the killer in this situation? Why not get pissed at the survivor for playing poorly? Oh yeah cause that would make too much sense. If survivors fuck up and make a poor play I guess you think it‚Äôs the killers job to make a poor play too. God forbid the killer play optimally, that would be toxic üòÉ
---
Yeah those edgy cloth straps. That's why it's better not to use his ability when chasing an injured surv cause he can hear it very well and know exactly where you are so mindgaming becomes pointless.
---
rank 12. xbox im waiting average 2 mins maybe 3. to get in a lobby then maybe about 1 min for fleshbags
---
35 is the level for Dead Hard i believe. We're Gonna Live Forever is a good bloodpoint perk for survivors. It's similar to BBQ &amp; Chili for killers. I'd recommend leveling David instead of spending the shards. Especially because he's free and not locked behind DLC
---
Left For Dead: 
---
When hooked for the first time and no survivor comes within 10/15/20m of you to rescue before you hit struggle phase, you are able to attempt escape while in struggle phase with a 10/15/20% chance of a successful escape. If successful, you will receive the borrowed time status effect for 4/8/12 seconds.
---
"This bitch really just left me to die." -Tilted survivors playing with randoms.
---
This is kinda just a little rant tbh.
---
The obsession IS supposed to switch I thought
---
Basically reverse wake up, dont even need to injure anyone. Also legion's blades too atm.
---
Where? Lol
---
My girlfriend loves when I play as/against the doctor because of the laugh.
---
Yeah, I'm stuck on rank 18 Survivor and rank 13 killer. Neither of my friends have this aswell. We are the unlucky ones, stay strong!

Try Red Paint Brush + Z-Block with a Lery's Offering and Monitor and Abuse for Mirror Myers 2.0 and a 3 second dream transition for a pulse pounding "I thought Freddy wasn't scary!" experience for survivors.
---
Wish they would add more event cakes to survivor webs

But when survivors play optimally it‚Äôs toxic because it‚Äôs gen rushing? lol whatever dude, keep crying and enjoy rank 16. You act like I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs completely against the rules. Jesus Christ, now fuck off

Any killer not named Pig: "Hah, take that Killer!"
---
Pig: ":( y tho"

Ah. But nothing about Thana I suppose? I'm speaking purely based on word of mouth btw so I could be incorrect but I did hear that Thana is fucked atm.

Yea, think this definitely needs a bit of a rework

YES and EXACTLY. I‚Äôm glad there are other intellectuals hereüò´üëå

I didnt notice anything with thana. Maybe its like a once in awhile kinda bug?
---
Oh who cares then
---
It was a buff for good players. Your power is no longer an effortless down but Legion itself is a lot deadlier now.
---
I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT THERE IS AN "R" IN "PRENN" IN THE "CROTUS PRENN ASYLUM" MAP AND I'M STILL SO TRIGGERED ABOUT IT. WHY CAN'T I JUST CALL IT "CROTUS PENN" LIKE A HEATHEN?WHY DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A FANCY EXTRA LETTER?!

Huge dick Hag over here.

You‚Äôre a finance worker, so it‚Äôs more basic seeming knowledge to know most currencies, and especially major ones like dollars, euros, yen, etc. I for one don‚Äôt work in finance, so I can‚Äôt relate.  I don‚Äôt travel outside America because Europe is around 3,000 miles away and I can‚Äôt really afford to take a luxury plane to Europe, so I don‚Äôt work with Euros, and I have not ever worked with anything other than dollars, because I‚Äôve never travelled out of North America.  So I have an almost 0% chance of needing to use Euros because no country I have travelled to uses Euros, and therefore I never had to learn about euros.  Yeah, it‚Äôs a bit dumb not to know about it, but it‚Äôs just not something I have found necessary to my everyday life, and if it‚Äôs not necessary, I‚Äôm not gonna bother keeping it in the front of my mind because I never use that information.  As a finance worker you do, but just depending on living circumstances, the average American will not use euros because they aren‚Äôt in Europe.  My living circumstances mean I don‚Äôt hold currencies dear to my heart, but other knowledge is more important to me.  I know ‚Ç¨ is Euro, and ¬• is Yen, but not every last country that uses it because it‚Äôs not necessary for me to understand it.  Hope you understand why I was annoyed by the comment on Americans being a bit more self centered than other countries (and yeah there are some of us like that...)

Try to verify the integrity of the game files in steam under the game properties and relaunch.

True but they normally get shut downed pretty fast with down votes. Plus it worked with this meme format.
---
Nurses is generally okay on all killers isnt it? You could also try coulraphobia instead of sloppy as a option and crap i forgot monitor on her is spicy
---
No u
---
Not at all lol, have you ever face camped? I Never do personally, but if they face camp they stay there
---
Strong ones, S Tier.
---
Bad side? I‚Äôm curious what you mean and what your mind used to be vs now
---
I‚Äôd add a requirement that no other survivors are within 24 meters, because swf could abuse that perk
---
isn't it mostly war of the worlds too? Idk but yea the first 2 are hilarious especially since they keep most of the same cast across the first 2, continuity be damned.

I'm not a pro killer, I just play OK.But I can assure u that ure wrong with my killer videos from youtube.I don't even care fore views and shit, I record my videos, So I can know where I messed up and get better.

my channel is just like my id here, check my doctor videos and see what I do with 75% distance addon, loops and everything else.

now i know why the cat she is running away LMAO
---
Jason Bateman

Some of the perks have also downsides
---
Happened to me yesterday, was awkward the stood there looking at me and I kept lookinh back and forth between them and the hook lol
---
I‚Äôm Rank 1 Killer. I never said gen rushing is toxic. It‚Äôs a core imbalance of the game (there‚Äôs a reason that Ruin is in 99% of high rank games), but it‚Äôs not toxic. I‚Äôm just wondering how you say survivors playing optimally and rushing through gens is okay but the killer playing optimally is somehow toxic. The game is 4v1. Not 1vs1. When I down a Survivor who got unhooked in front of my face, I‚Äôm not punishing a single survivor. I‚Äôm punishing the survivor team as a whole for making bad plays. Maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be on the killer to look the other way when survivors do dumb shit. Maybe it should be the survivors job to not unhook their team .3 seconds after they get hooked.
---
Too soon.
---
Hoooow did you even think that was lewd
---
I mean it's just as common for your swings to hit the window while they're still in the vault animation.
---
I mained survivor for 100 hours with a duo and 100 hours as solo. in that time I always tought that killers that use ruin are POS, that killers always have fun and is the only side that actually have fun, because it's easy and survivors require a lot to play while killers do less and still win.
---
Now I played killer for 30 hours and my statements are all the same above, but reverse. Killers deal with a lot of pressure and some tactics aren't toxic, they need to be done
---
*DISCONNECTS*
---
Escape Plan: When the trials starts for the next 60 seconds you have the ability to start powering the doors by 20/25/30%. When you start the "open exit gate action" you receive the exposed status effect for the next 90 seconds.
---
NOTE: Doors can only be opened to 30% before all generators are done. If someone has already opened it by 30% before all gens are done you cannot continue open it.
---
You think so?

---
Glittering Distraction- increases your chance to be obsession. When you‚Äôre the obsession and in a chase with the killer, all survivors within 12/16/20 meters of the killer will move 5/6/7% faster, but your aura will be revealed to the killer. If you‚Äôre not the obsession, getting a protection hit will automatically make you obsession.
---
I farm with them until I have everything maxed out then lure them into basement showing chest so they think I want them to have it and then I down and hook everyone in the basement best to do as bubba. :)))

The better question is: why not?üòé

Man why do so many people think a game company is just a group of people who do every task? Hey Art team, creative team, mobile team, and lore team... Get fixing these bugs? So many of you preteens are dumb as bricks.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. Jaws with robot legs
---
a 2 killer, 8-10 survivor, game mode with more generators (or a whole new objective) and some tweaks could seriously work if optimized and done properly.
---
Those that dont fall for a shock stun gets a hit, so doctor still getting a free hit for those that come close to him.

Oh that's okay then nvm

Monitor and abuse, nurse calling, sloppy butcher, bbq/ch.
---
I decided to look into if my antivirus software falsely detected this as a threat, and it did, so I unblocked it and that did the trick
---
It's like you get the blind but you where .5 seconds off so it doesn't count
---
Well. You're a car now.
---
Well they all have the same movement speed but sticking to the lore..: it was Dwight but then he received the pizza delivery skin so I guess it‚Äôs Jane since she sort of wears high heels
---
If anything you should be rewarded for managing to go the whole game without being seen and escaping, devs have no clue what they‚Äôre doing half of the time
---
I just don't farm. Idgaf about bloodpoints, I'm here to play the game so even if the other 3 are playing around with the killer I'll be sneaking and trying to pop gens alone I guess.
---
Stopped happening after the end game update for me...
---
Not every killer needs ruin; Billy, Nurse and Hag especially have way better perks to run instead of Ruin, and Trapper prefer Corrupt Intervention more IMO.

10 MINUTES IS JUST FOR IT TO OPEN A LOBBY THEN I WAIT 10-20 MINUTES TO FIND 4 SURVIVORS. I TO ONLY MANAGED TO FIND AND FINISH 1 MATCH WITHIN THE HOUR AND I ENDED UP FACING A 4 MAN SWF WHO WERE ALL WAY HIGHER RANK THEN ME. FUCK THIS GAME... I BET ITS BECAUSE THE EVENT OFFERING BEING MORE COMMON ON KILLER CAUSING THIS.
---
Gas cans.
---
All gens start with an even longer time period. There are two gas can spawns on the map. Survivors can carry one can at a time and drop and spill it if they run. Every gas can in a gen shortens the overall time of repair.
---
Gives survivors more to do while still letting them finish things quickly if the killer isn't playing, while also giving the player more ways to slow down gens if they choose to.
---
In exchange change it so that the length of time a survivor stays on the hook increases based on the killer's proximity.
---
I mean, making him easier to detect is literally a nerf lol
---
Female Legions stun noise is NOT boring
---
They changed vaulting for a reason. I think a perk that kind of helps with getting hit after vaulting would be good considering killer can hit survivors a pretty good distance through the window. Maybe like have a "dodge" after vaulting so the killers range is reduced. Or even like a dead hard maybe but for vaulting.
---
The Babadook
---
Ability: The babadook can change his form to mimic that of a random survivor in the trial. This lasts for 30 seconds or if he is stunned or blinded. If the babadook approaches the survivor he is currently mimicking from behind, he can possess them for 15 seconds and sees the aura of the nearest other survivor.
---
Might be too strong, idk
---
Self care is shit and often a detriment to a team
---
Bom, a julgar pelas suas builds (maior parte com noed) e muitos dos jogos voc√™ ou est√° nos ranks verdes ou est√° contra algu√©m de rank muito baixo, eu n√£o duvido dos 4k, afinal ao ver suas gameplay, voc√™ joga extremamente parecido com 90% dos bons doctor, a diferen√ßa √© a consist√™ncia, eu duvido ter bons jogos sempre
---
Or just frickin delete leave button wtf
---
until sometime next month because Freddy is becoming god
---
currently using monitor, ruin, and nurses. my hag is only level ~40 so i dont really have a good fourth perk. waiting for make your choice to appear though
---
A whole new objective would be amazing but very problematic, BHVR has backed themselves into a corner, a lot of perks rely on generators and chests, what would toolboxes be used for apart from sabboing hooks? tinkerer? fire up? corrupt intervention, ruin, discordance, the list could go on and on and on.
---
Oh god that‚Äôs horrible
---
I hate it so much
---
Use your eyes you damn beg, he says that he was pointing out to his friend how broke  Wake Up is, as proved by his build. Also the fact it was a KILL YOUR FRIENDS. A FUN MATCH WITH FRIENDS, NON-SERIOUS AND UNIMPORTANT. WHO ACTUALLY CARES WHAT HE DOES WITH HIS FRIENDS.
---
Thanks, this belongs there
---
I've been main killer for a while, I hardly let them live because of the kobe.
---
I usually let them go when someone DC or something like that.
---
The times they kobed, I was far, cause I don't camp, so I just knocked them down when I found them again.
---
To them, we are edgy teenagers with dirty knives wanting to kill them LOL
---
I think as you rank up there should be more gens to do before the gates open. Would extend the game as well as give more opportunity to earn BPs for both sides (should probably increase the cap too). With an increase BP cap and more opportunity to get BPs it would also actually incentivize ranking up. Would probably have to spawn more gens too though so the killer doesn‚Äôt just have to camp one.
---
The difference is the cat breaks the sound barrier after your first step towards it

I forgot about that, guess I‚Äôm just going to have to get used to long ass wait times.
---
I‚Äôm too evil, and in about every game I down the last 2 survivors before hooking them. That way they die more quickly
---
Tbh I'm like really tired and I'm not reading that lol
---
as killer mains said about the wake up bug "ban all the hag players!!"
---
I run up and hit the gens with my weapon. its the universal HEY, FINISH THIS. LETS FARM. sign I think.
---
The hatch was open with a key, the killer close the hatch but there are 2 survivors in the match, the other one dies so the hatch open again for the last survivor.
---
I do understand why you were annoyed, especially if you thought I was talking about all Americans (lol I love Americans usually, and I really hope to be able to establish myself there in the future)
---
I was just annoyed as well, not knowing what Euro is seems like a disrespect, yes European countries aren‚Äôt as big as the US, but we still are important countries worldwide (I‚Äôm from France, and it feels bad when people in the US, which are very close friend, historically, diplomatically and culturally, don‚Äôt even know what currency we use for example).
---
Plus planes are getting cheaper and cheaper, and I truly hope all Americans will experience what Europe is, because it is amazing (as much as is the US) to visit.
---
Later, moans were heard from a nearby house
---
u/GlenOck is this post oink worthy?
---
sarcasm isn't your thing is it?
---
Good post overall, but for huntress, i believe the only issue is the red addon that 1 hit kills on hatch throws. Remove that addon and she doesn't need any nerf.
---
Delightfully devilish Seymour
---
The sarcasm is strong with this one.
---
Waddles
---
Why not Bubbasaur?
---
Holy shit, calm down. I just wanted to get banned for playing KYF
---
Poised is instant. Distortion is instant but usually means the killer is running something to read auras. Dance with me is instant upon a rushed action (like jumping a window or pallet getting out of a locker in a burst) only lightweight isn't but it also makes them stay for less time so if the killer is slightly distracted you can get away
---
I‚Äôm trying to avoid the started Pok√©mon for now to add complexity ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
He's weird but hot sometimes... look like a daddy
---
Hell yeah brother , its the only resort left .
---
Disappointed that Play With Your Food was "fixed." Gaining one token by ending the chase via downing the obsession was a more than welcome buff for the perk in my opinion. Made it far more viable.
---
Myers and Huntress don't need nerfs.
---
Trapper would probably much more enjoy a rework.
---
Giving Wraith more addons in his base kit isn't really helping him, he could also do with a rework, or a much stronger buff.
---
Leatherface is quite literally, the last killer that needs any nerfs.
---
Passive aggression is not a mental illness, and if it were you would be suffering from it too judging by your post.
---
I became a killer main at the worse time, pallet looping, flashlights, BNP, DS, SB, then arguing with survivors in chat. Still i rose through the ranks having fun. Id rather be dealing with loopers than sitting waiting on lobbies
---
I like Julie and frank but they're soo basic and boring. They need to get skins because they look very similar and bland
---
As for Joey, I also don't know which is better, the neon one or the ghost mask(I'll say I prefer the ghost one a little bit more)
---
Cool thanks friend!
---
What is Roulette Spirit? Prayer Beads?
---
Cringe.
---
Nah m8 , i m directly agressive , when i have a problem i dont hide it with beautiful words , i just say it .
---
Relentless Charge: When a survivor enters a chase, a token is consumed. (2 tokens max) Consuming a token will prevent survivors from suffering certain debuffs for a limited time. Hindered and Deep Wound are not affected by Relentless Charge.
---
Cause "muh circlejerk"
---
Probably in a week because once people get good at countering him alot people will ditch him and switch back to nurse, Hillbilly,etc because they can't get easy 1 shots and just playing him too much and getting burnt out.
---
All survivors are exactly the same.
---
Their only difference is their appearance.
---
I am incandescent and likely to punch a wall
---
Can we please get some sort of fix for lobbies only filling with 3 survivors?
---
This is fucking cursed
---
That‚Äôs fucking brilliant
---
Yeah I think some seem slower to me because they're just bigger
---
Why isn't he on console? There's just three perks out there I can't touch? :(
---
Just gotta add that /s üòÇ
---
What else are survivors supposed to focus on? Do you consider a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù game to be one guy on gens, one guy on totems, one guy getting chased, &amp; one guy hiding in a corner? What do you expect survivors to do after they finish the gen they‚Äôre on?
---
It is a matter of choice. They might want to let you go but if you think it is bm you can try to wiggle out and run. You would most likely miss out on a free escape and they will eventually just kill you. Or you might be right and they are gonna bm so escaping is your best chance. Either way it depends on the person and what they want to do. I am just saying I want to carry people to hatch and if they don't let me then they die.
---
Ah, makes sense.  "SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING BAD ABOUT KEANU DOWNVOTE TIME"
---
...how do you know if 2 rank 20‚Äôs downvoted
---
Ah I see. Thank you.
---
LMAO did you see huntress Scott? i bet it will take -1000000000000000 downvote from the slaty people he faced.
---
I mean they farmed a lot too
---
Huntress skin
---
Looks like a female hillbilly lol
---
The internet may aswell be labelled Keunu Reeves' Bitch
---
No you're bad. 
---
You need an overtuned killer because you suck at the game and cannot win through hard work and talent.
---
Suck it.
---
Me and the boys at the Halloween party
---
Still taking just as long for me on pc too. Always greeted with an swf running syringes, best toolboxes and purple flashlights too and at least one is guarenteed to have object of obsession so they can update the rest on where you are at all times.
---
Lol @ the devs.
---
What are those things to the left?
---
Bruh, I‚Äôve seen it happen so many got dam times, I don‚Äôt even care anymore. I just them back on the hook. In the beginning, I respected but not anymore.
---
He never listens to them
---
He knows that they're the fools
---
They don't like him
---
The fool on the hill
---
I dont know what they‚Äôve done to Huntress but its impossible to tell where shes coming from now
---
Yeah it‚Äôs so cute üòä
---
Good feedback. I just figured it would be pretty balanced when not in a chase bc it basically forces you to not use a window bc he will see it.

---
Oh oh oh oh staying alive, staying alive
---
well, the survivors made all these bloodpoints offerings so they gain as many bloodpoints as possible and i brought a mori (they were a SWF) so if i would've used it, all of us would've got less bloodpoints so i just decided to be nice and not use it but they were so annoying since they were farming each other off the hook with BT and WGLF and they barely got a gen because of that
---
Pier to pier sounds cooler though.
---
Iirc it was brought up many times on here. That's how I even found out about it. Just no one made a big deal about it but I saw a shit ton of wake up memes. I don't want to fuel debate between survivors and killers but it's odd how little it was talked about considering how literally game breaking it was. I actually noticed a lot of my recent games (PS4) had tons of killers running the perk so I just assumed it was buffed and I was looping right or something. Really frustrating to play again but at least it's over now.
---
I dont actually  but they're not red nor purple rank for sure and even if they're then it means its one of those toxic ones .
---
But once you use them, then what? They‚Äôll be gone, reduced to atoms. You will use the gateaus to destroy the gateaus.
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
*record scratch*
---
*freeze frame*
---
Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.
---
i think it‚Äôs because survivors also get the party starters. I have like 50 of those things that I‚Äôll never use...
---
tell him "maybe id respect them more if you knew how to use them ;)"
---
I see no cause for concern

If I‚Äôm able then ask who tf is badger, am I an uncultured swine for this?

---
Seems like a normal day in Dead by daylight
---
This is extremely anecdotal, but in my four games today as GF, I‚Äôve found the spotting to be better. I can break lines of sight when being stared at, and I haven‚Äôt been getting BS stalks on.  I can also tell when a survivor is screwing up their line of sight and I get an open full stalk.  It feels more natural right now. We‚Äôll see, though.
---
why am I not surprised
---
Some things never change~
---
Shit, I'm now a survivor? RIP
---
You must not have played the ptb with dedicated servers, I know it's only a beta, but damn, they better spend about a million more on the servers for them to be usable
---
fucking GOTTEM
---
Well on that note, good luck in the fog!
---
Janes are also mostly in lockers
---
I am ok with the Ghost Face nerf because devs clearly don't want strong killers anymore. Spirit was probably the last one. She, Billy and Nurse will dominate red ranks, like they did before.
---
Urgency: Whenever the survivor fully completes an action, the next non-repair action they take will receive a 15%/30%/45% speed boost.  (Actions that trigger the perk to activate include; healing, searching chests, repairing, cleansing totems, sabotaging hooks, unhooking, opening an exit gate. Actions that are affected by the perk; All previously mentioned actions, waking up other survivors, searching jigsaw boxes, cleansing at a fountain, snapping out of it, mending.)
---
Survivors not getting skill checks benefits them vs Freddy
---
How the fuck playing against wraith is hard , use object of obsession and do gens when he comes anywhere near you sprint burst away to pallets till he uncloaks you will have a 313921321391232 meters gap between you and the wraith then start looping .
---
damn, i didn't know i'm that important for you to search that + what's so cringy about considering a killer annoying?
---
This 100%. I remember before the bloodhunt I kept getting my bbq stacks and then I only downed without hooking. If all of them were on the ground I let one wiggle off and save the others. In the end everyone has always escaped, and got a lot of points incouding me. The best thing is by doing this you only safety :)
---
No she‚Äôs the clone!
---
Trust me, I‚Äôve had similar experiences. But I‚Äôm only trying to help.
---
Your PS4 is going to fly in a few days.
---
You must queue into my games lol. I don‚Äôt give handouts for poor play.
---
Yes , because I care about people's opinion .
---
All of my other teammates were really bad. They died super quickly during chases and even when i ran the killer pretty long two other times, they didn‚Äôt do gens or want to save.
---
Head on and reliable on the same sentence is a funny joke.
---
It's a 2 way street. I started as killer and got more into survivor recently, there are some pretty shitty killers people have to face on a daily basis (not talking about the characters, but about the players). I'm just glad that when I'm killer, I can control my whole team, making sure no one on my team is a jerk. As survivor, I don't have this power.
---
She's easily top 5 killers if shes played well, right up there with billy and spirit.
---
Eh I mean yeah it makes tunneling easier but personally I avoid tunneling because it's a shit practice and actually tends to make me lose out on points. As long as no one is being a cunt I'll leave a wounded just unhooked survivor to run off and chase someone who I havent even hooked once.
---
saaame
---
toolboxes
---
then stop bitching for basically no reason
---
That would both not change anything (since alt-f4) and buff holding someone hostage.
---
People gonna be connecting controllers/K&amp;M to their phones and tablets. 100% either modded or not.
---
Or emulating it on PC.
---
*They are, then*
---
They actually only buffed the stealth besides the Add-ons everything was nerfs and the leaning stalk was actually written wrong
---
How the turns have tabled
---
it is a disorder and your opinion does not matter because it is a FACT . 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUv0eDPWffc
---
Reminds me of that image with the little girl and the burning house.
---
As the other guy said. I've had my knife bounce off while they are just beginning the animation. Hell I've had it bounce off their spine.
---
Legion is actually really fun with good players and builds...
---
The Intel on hit allows him to put alot of pressure on survivors...
---
However good survivors can still loop him round and they can mend far too easily and there's really no reason for mend to exist on him... simply injuring them wouldn't change him at all....so adding sloppy effects to mending and heal altering perks will give him the ability to be a heal stall killer.
---
You know, tunneling is probably the worst tactic, cuz the team is free to do gens while the killer's chasing that one person whole time
---
I‚Äôm at rank 2, at the moment.
---
That's when you either let em run off or slug em and let someone heal em. I just feel so bad after being on the receiving end of this shit.
---
I am very very upset that this garbage meme made in Paint while waiting in queue got about 200 times the attention that my statistical analysis of Hex: Ruin got. Reddit is garbage and fuck you all, no offense intended.
---
Nah, he can just zoom across the map in under than 10 seconds.
---
No That's camping. Tho both are pretty shit tactics
---
That was really cool. I want to see what the post game chat looked like
---
If you still dont get the ''reason'' I cant convert you my friend , go and play killer and i give you a challenge , become red rank with wraith . If you want to make it hell dont use ruin .
---
Still has to get you, boss.

I might have been mistaken (based on the last link) and thought that it was released everywhere, as opposed to just the PTB. However, since Chapter 12 was just released, that at least confirms that it‚Äôs in environmental testing. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to make clips on Twitch, otherwise I‚Äôd feature one of a Fog Whisperer confirming their release. Both him and his SWF group mention it on-stream frequently.

---
Narcoleptic: When entering a locker outside of the killers terror radius, Narcoleptic activates, upon activation, exhaustion is doubled up in speed, and you are silenced for 3/4/5 seconds. After the 3/4/5 seconds, you start snoring, making you hearable from 10/9/8 meters away, and can't perform a rushed exit.  
---
Quality of life stuff: When in the killers terror radius during the not-yet sleeping phase, the timer pauses until out of the terror radius. Falling asleep with a Freddy as a killer will put you into the dream state. When sleeping and a survivor opens the door, they instead slowly close it instead of you closing it.  
---
It would be nice if you could give me some constructive criticism on how the perk could be better.
---
Of course the Hag needs one...
---
She's dummy thicc
---
I agree definitely that nerfing a average killer is kinda dumb but Ghostfaces detection was kinda iffy and him refilling his expose meter was kinda broken and I feel the nerfs struck a balance to him challenging and rewarding
---
Sometimes I feel bad farming with killer, because they eventually let us all free or the survivors abuse the killer and run away when done farming. So I often ask the killer to hang me on the hook because I feel bad.
---
WHY ARE MY TOXIC TEAMMATES SUCH ASSHOLES TO ME POST GAME, SAYING I DID ‚ÄúNOTHING‚Äù BECAUSE YOU ALL RAN AROUND THE ENTIRE MATCH IN THE MOST OBVIOUS FASHION, AND I SURVIVED BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO CROUCH AND HIDE, BUT APPARENTLY 4 UNHOOKS AND 2 GENERATORS IS ME BEING A ‚ÄúDO NOTHING, HIDING PUSSY‚Äù ITS NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU CAN‚ÄôT KEEP YOUR COOL, AND YOU RUN AROUND LIKE A CHICKEN WITH THEIR HEAD CUT OFF.

This was a BIG mistake
---
Blows mind how people will say Plague is bad  because ‚Äújust don‚Äôt cleanse lul‚Äù but then those same people will say noed is OP. how is noed OP but the killer who has noed for the whole game is shit. 
---
Plague is a top tier killer change my mind.
---
Why did he not attempt to hit you until the very end? Lol
---
Pay 7000 Bloodpoints for an Ultra rare offering that removes your perks and add ons next game? Sounds like a good deal!

Dog. Upvotes to the left

Nice but the pig is a dude.
---
vaulting and selfcare or dropping a pallet are different buttons
---
"How do you do, fellow survivors?"
---
Eh, Billy still has good map pressure and he can punish survivors mistakes with 1 shot. Even in red ranks, survivors still make mistakes or are greedy with loops. As Tru3 said : Billy can find faster than any other killer the weaker survivors, down them quickly and snow ball because of them. But against 4 experienced survivors, he will probably gets destroyed tho.
---
Yeah, without specific perks like Iron Will, you can't do much against good Spirits or good Nurses. Especially Nurses with range add-ons and Spirits with charge time and speed add-ons, they are gonna down you very fast.
---
You gotta do what you gotta do to end the suffering, right?
---
I love playing Dead By Daylight, I'm mostly a survivor main that enjoys the adrenaline of being chased. 
---
Thought I'd focus more on playing as the killer especially since Ghost Face released recently.
---
Played as Ghost Face and received a flawless sacrifice. Didn't tunnel or face camped a survivor.
---
It's unfortunate how some people can't take a defeat and move on with it.

It wants you to buy a ps5 so it can fly to the airport

Achievement unlocked: Met your first salty bitch.

you start to get irritating. i never said Wraith, Clown or Plague are op or something, they are just fuckin' annoying.
---
I honestly don't know, but it's amazing lol
---
No witnesses
---
I think this usually happens when the killer is not walking with his base animation. I was Legion in frenzy and I got stuck half a second before entering in destroying animation and I could move again but the fear was real there.
---
*Those bastards lied to me.*

---
Another camping thread.
---
zZzZzZzZzZz
---
Its in as the shards
---
At rank 1 doesn‚Äôt mean playing against rank 1 unless you have an accurate statistics page to show me rather than some developer words with no context. Also, whats a ‚Äúwin rate‚Äù in this game? 
---
I have her mid tier, no lower. Billy, Spirit, and Nurse will always be better in every situation. 
---
You could make a case that she‚Äôs upper mid tier and better than Myers/GF, Huntress on a few maps, and hag on the most open maps.
---
I think it was the 3 year anniversary stream. Devs were asked why they don‚Äôt buff certain killers, and their answer was the communities perception of killers doesn‚Äôt always match the data, and that the plague has the highest win rate at rank 1 despite people thinking she needs buffs. Don‚Äôt have a timestamp or anything but it would be in the first hour or 2 of the stream since that‚Äôs all I watched. 
---
I mean, there‚Äôs probably a few reason for it. She probably has a high win rate than Nurse because everyone plays Nurse at Rank 1, while the only people playing plague are plague mains who know the killer inside-out. 
---
But still, it‚Äôs not hard to see why she‚Äôd have a high win rate. High rank survivors think that the best strategy to use is giving a killer noed for the entire game.
---
Looks like he's about to start handing out Death Notes
---
Well there is a lot of camping threads but it really is a problem for us survivor mains
---
No hate but man, it hurts seeing all those pallets being wasted
---
one of them dcd on loading because I brought a secret was worth
---
Tell me if you mori'ed them
---
Wh.... Where did you grab him?
---
Noed without the speedboost = I‚Äôd rather play wraith
---
Just have the team burn out 3-4 gens while you‚Äôre on hook.
---
To be honest the insidious one is brilliant, the devs should consider it someday
---
&gt;Well there is a lot of camping threads but it really is a problem for us survivor mains
---
Not really a problem, it just makes games boring.
---
Thats a bad idea really...it wouldn't really extend the game for the survivor side but would for the killer instead because the killer can tunnel and kill off a survivor fast in the match whereas the remaining survivors will still be doing gens in order to escape. So if thats the case, It would be much of an easier challenge for killers to get easy 3k or 4k every game which would be unfair.
---
finally a fellow doctor fucker
---
The first time I got stunned as Pig, I thought the survivor I was carrying made that cute squeak.
---
I watched that stream too and I don‚Äôt remember that
---
one dcd because of the secret offering :(
---
You can still stalk mid chase or play mind games with your ability ( now that they remove the directional sounds ). I woud accept the nerf if his cooldown  would get reduced, to be a M1 killer for 30 seconds is pretty harsh, especially when 30 seconds means so much in this game.
---
For a Lucky guy like me that always gets a useless team that wont work. Also this is Just my opinion on the topic.
---
Soon my brother
---
This man is right.
---
Only had the game since it came out on gamepass but I've been around gaming long enough to know this is fact. I've been saying it since I started playing. Every single person who is trying to fix the game just doesnt understand it is broken at its core.
---
That's not very nice you wasted a ebony just for them.
---
Exactly, this is ash on steroids
---
The Collector and Arkin DLC fuckin please BHVR!

Bitter murmur for those juicy stalks or spirit fury for those juicy chases

I feel you. After all the effort to make that vault, you still get smacked on the back.
---
That made me exhale forcefully though my nose, take my upvote
---
Stonks has been a meme for a while before Bagur's video.
---
When he was vaulting a pallet towards me
---
If he fell asleep from reading i guess he didn't do great at school
---
I was thinking about with Myers its a bit different cause his stalk buffs him. But they did also, or are at least planning, to increase the width of the basement stairs so they could walk by even if he was trying to body block. But it just seems weird with Ghost face that a survivor is allowed to literally go inside of you to avoid being stalked.
---
Groovy. üëå
---
Nurse is S tier. Billy Spirit Plague A tier with Plague being worst of the 4.
---
I rewatched the clip and had that song play in my head. Perfecto.

I'd say whispers cause it's really nice to know if someone is around

How to make insidious suck 101

*and as a result enforce the idea that other much more meta perks should always be run instead of giving something else a try*

Though I could just be an idiot who didn‚Äôt think about the long run.
---
Or trade items with a friend üëçüèª

Enduring or brutal strength in my opinion preferably enduring so if u hit someone they the pallet and they leave the loop u can recover quicker and lose the least amount distance as possible
---
Question
---
What‚Äôs a gruesome gateu
---
It was during a stream that happened recently, that‚Äôs all I can really remember. It might‚Äôve actually been the stream where they talked about buffing ghostface in the ptb.
---
I would keep the blood as a trophy
---
Which is boring and in that situation I would rather just play a real game instead of gen simulator because the killer is shit.
---
I‚Äôve found blood warden is pretty great with him
---
because big scary killer is coming to investigate big boom noise
---
Lmao ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I still remember my jackpot find of getting two green medkits, each with a needle. It was a good day that I decided to share with a fellow survivor who doubted my find
---
They did increase it, just making the comparison up until today‚Äôs game status. 
---
I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs done with GF seeing as how his power can be cancelled and his stalk progress on a survivor goes away if you hit them.
---
Making the games boring **is** a problem.
---
HAAAAAAAAAH is more of angry yell than a scream
---
Yea I get that but you're supposed to use it as a stealth ability and not in a Chase which is why they did that and I do agree 30 seconds is kinda harsh but if you use it to mindgame and you get stunned you messed up and the mistake is costly which punishes you for doing that which is why they made stuns take him out because you aren't supposed to use it in a Chase and use it out of stealth.
---
Huntress's Hum you will hear if you're close enough, regardless of orientation. You'll just hear it from further away if she's facing you.
---
Whispers, Play with your food (bugged version would have been top tier), maaaaaybe Thrill of the hunt for some extra points and sneaking up on people doing totems.
---
And huntress?
---
They are the cakes for the 3 year anniversary event, they give everyone 103% bp
---
we rise

If farming ud usually give myself to the killer cause no one else would OwO
---
Livestream. I dont remember which one,but i remember that they said that. I use custom icons since i got this game (about 2 years), also all of my friends use custom icons as well. We dont have any problems
---
Its ridiculous...it happened to me aswell before in Badham preschool map, I had a medkit with Gauze roll addon and Anti hemorrhagic syringe and everything you mentioned above occured.
---
Respect pallets?

---
"No Country for Old Men"  
---
Hey, can we get Anton Chigurh for a Killer?
---
Thanks guys !!
---
I've got about 600 hours in this game and I think I've had facecampers with Insidious all of three times.  Either I'm extremely lucky or it's just not a monumental problem.
---
And yet even back then DC'ing was a thing
---
No Russian
---
This was exactly it. Nevermind the fact that the killer could've chosen the hook on the other side of the shack instead of the one literally dangling right over the hatch.
---
It was a good play.
---
The accuracy! Literally the only reason I level up Ace. Then another Survivor got Plunderer‚Äôs Instinct at Rank 3 and, well... ol‚Äô Ace is gathering dust these days.
---
I'm a killer main but I've been playing with my friend as survivor and that's all we've gotten. When I play killer now I let most of them live if they aren't toxic. Been practicing Nurse while at it too. PS4.
---
My friend made me literally stop my car while driving home so she could try to pet a cat. She didn‚Äôt pet the cat.
---
Lol Haunted Grounds is one of the reasons I puss out when it comes to cleansing Hex Totems.   
---
If you cleanse it at the Wrong Time (ie Survivor is being chased down) its pretty much R.I.P.      
---
      
---
I was playing with a game with Randoms, and then all of a sudden, the ***EXPOSED*** Icon appeared - followed by 2 guys put in the dying state. The Killer ended up getting a 4k.       
---
Fast Foward to Post-Game Chat, where a couple of "love letters" went to the individual that cleansed it. I learned a few new insults in that chat. ü§£ü§£
---
Shelter woods is awesome. No incredibly safe building that can be reached from anywhere. I don't see how having one map that's better for killer is a bad thing.
---
Actually it just makes you play specific character that you haven't unlocked. I remember using Leatherface's offering on Huntress and I still had his perks.
---
Huntress is a 110 killer with no power on Haddonfield.
---
Are we still gonna be able to use the cake after the event if we have some left?
---
I've kinda had the opposite problem. I was farming with a group and the rule was everyone gets two hooks (they invited me to party chat). I put the random on her second hook and left her. Then, after doing some stuns and flashlight saves I noticed the random was still on the hook. The everyone in the group had assumed the other would go for save. So, then we were all collectively running to the hook going "shitshitshitshitshit". Sadly, it was too late. I felt really bad. Thankfully, random was cool about it; since she not only pipped but thought it was funny watching a Susie being chased by a bunch of Jane's.
---
Do gens
---
They meant Springwood. Badham.
---
But he unlocked the Freddy offering on Freddy.
---
Shit fam imma get tankedüò≥
---
Really? I could've sworn they removed the perks for the match. Was it changed at some point? I was on a break from the game for a few months so I could of missed that.
---
Not every video has to be *WOW SUPER COOL TOXIC 360 JUKE MONTAGE* to be worth a fuck.
---
Salty comments like these are common as hell now though, get used to it.
---
Shame it's PS4 though, if it was Steam they could comment on your profile and I consider salt on Steam profile to be of trophy value.
---
They were the discount coupons you can get from the ongoing steam summer sale
---
Sure but I only know it from two things: my service as a 343 mortar operator and Badger's video. Whether it was a meme before that or not is irrelevant since the most recent thing is his video.
---
You heard me. Jane. Is. The. Best. Girl.
---
That's the part I always fuck up.  Instead of just hiding and waiting for them to leave I run.
---
where do u get them exactly?
---
Seeing Unbreakable without Bill feels so weird
---
Losing to rng is stupid so no.
---
Expected this to be posted by Glen, honestly.
---
I want dedicated servers for dead by et stop this trash hitboxe
---
Go to Steam and click on the Summer Sale banner at the top of the store page and it'll take you to where you need to be and explain everything on that page.
---
More like... A good Perk got busted. Thats what really happened here.
---
thanks!
---
Neither is the Plague though (or Spirit I think).
---
You can't just give every killer a way to give exhaustion and mangled lmao
---
Well your fourth perk would be unbreakable for the increased recovery rate on the ground. But I would replace Boil over with D-strike. A good killer can actually use boil over to get to a hook faster. and with D strike if the slug you then you build up flip flop meter
---
That one made me chuckle
---
I love that map as survivor. Balanced landing ftw
---
Still applies if you used it whilst knowing it was bugged
---
The problem, imo, isnt that they are doing their main objective it's that they are given so many tools and ways to circumvent the balance of the game that it just makes playing killer so much more stressful. Killers should be setting the pace of the match. Killers should be the power role. Survivors should be legitimately afraid of the killer finding them. Instead survivors are given so many tools and crutches that killers are at a huge disadvantage 90% of games. Did you see that post a few days ago where they got a gen done in 8.06 seconds?  Sure yeah that's perfect world type of shit but cmon. You cant tell the system isnt broken.
---
And now everyone in the theater room screams ‚ÄúHE‚Äôs wOrThY??????‚Äù
---
You can look in the match details.
---
Well... I kind of was when he disappeared and exited that surprised me.
---
I've picked people up to let them wiggle out for points and they just....do nothing.
---
Tell me bout it man, he added a little extra salt with the tbag at the end.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if this is a shitpost or not
---
The shame of failing a skill check is enough to make me run away to find another gen to prevent embarrassing myself further in front of my team mates.
---
Unironically more inexperienced survivors are likely going to run to find another gen incase it attracts the killer to their location, just like /u/Dreaming_Dreams said.
---
True is not a good example because most players will never even come close to that skill or game knowledge. 
---
Even then, he acknowledges that the scales are tipped heavily in the survivor's favor without it.

In my opinion they should make the Ruin effect baseline and deactivate it after first down or something. This way it wouldn't over- or undershoot, like it usually does, and also open up a perk slot for more interesting builds.
---
Thats my house cat. Only time I get a chance to pet them is when THEY are the ones that decide they want to get pet

Is that the chick from konosuba?
---
This patch is by far the worse one with the bugs.
---
it end july 2nd
---
it would be cool if they just made Wraith fully invisible but they can't do that
---
i think that if they removed that speed boost you get when uncloaking and in exchange made him fully invisible, i think it wouldn't be too overpowered, he's still an M1 killer who gets stopped by pallets
---
Anniversary isn't over until July 2nd.
---
seriously shes hideous
---
You act like I‚Äôve said the worse thing in the world when I‚Äôm just stating fact üòÇ he‚Äôs not a viable killer in red ranks. All I see down here are Billy‚Äôs and spirits maybe some nurses but not many as I play on ps4 and when it‚Äôs a different killer most of the time They get rekt haha I‚Äôm not an asshole for speaking the obvious so maybe you should shut the fuck up and stop being a asshole?
---
Exactly this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen it work
---
That window vault at the begging triggers me
---
Is it bad I think it looks like an old Zubatlel
---
What sound cue is that?  The robe sound?
---
Many people value wins/strategy over points, though, regardless of courtesy.
---
One of the reasons why I try and get my killers to level 50 before even thinking about playing them lol
---
So it‚Äôs just a nerf? Because the other part of what makes Ruin so strong is that the regression along with pausing the timer. If you just have regression with no pausing, that‚Äôs a massive nerf because you‚Äôre not making the generations any harder to actually finish just artificially inflating the timer. I understand what you mean by trying to change Ruin, but this ain‚Äôt it, chief.
---
Doctor is free for Xbox...
---
You can hear "aaaaaaaaveeeeeeeeee maaaaaariiiiiiiiiIiiiiiiaaaaa" song on the background
---
Yeah I forgot that, I got the game a very long time ago, so just a lapse of memory there.
---
The problem with my cat is that they get scared when I crouch down, so I do the slow blink while towering over them, but at least it works
---
Wish this was for Xbox lol
---
Ghostface's stun sound is him already done with survivor's shit.
---
From day 1 he was already fed up.
---
Well. 2 of those perks can be completely shredded as long as you don‚Äôt rely exclusively on tunneling. Dead hard only works 50 percent of the time. And adrenaline never really bothers me when I play Killer, nor anybody I know. It‚Äôs just 2 more scoring events you can get. Same with insta heals. And regardless of this , using things the devs put in the game to win is someone immoral when a survivor does it, but you keep running your NOED, 5 blink Nurse, 1 tap hatchets etc, and saying that survivors complain too much
---
Is there anything they didn't break in this patch?
---
Damm can't believe they're scamming people like that
---
He got banned?!
---
The real worth, in my opinion, is that you get em for half the price.
---
Whoever is down voting me your moms a hoe
---
Basically how it worked was each time you hooked someone, that bar would fill a quarter. Each quarter was a point, so you can earn up to 4 points per survivor. You would earn 1 per hook, plus one when they died, so hooking was encouraged over slugging/moris. It was changed because when you throw DC's in, as well as Moris, it kind of messes with the system.
---
Agreed. The hitboxes are garbage on PS4.
---
I feel like we did a pretty good job so far.

But you find perks to make it easier, making it more boring and not skill, just perks, of there wasn‚Äôt perks it wouldn‚Äôt be boring. The deliverance makes it worse because they‚Äôll be like. ‚ÄúOh he has deliverance, he‚Äôs gonna go in the hatch‚Äù
---
Mine is wired in and I still have that happen way too often.
---
I think that ruin rn (or at least when i was playing more often) is such a garbage perk if youre going against higher skilled survivors. Whenever I see ruin come up it has no effect on me. I just keep working on the gen because its not like hitting greats is such a struggle. I think that ruin turned in from slowing down gens by altering skill checks to actually buying time by having people look for the totem.
---
r/meirl
---
Oink. (yes)
---
I will not be the bone dog Myers!
---
Someone watches Otzs
---
MAYBE THEY ARE ALL KILLERS WHO GOT TIRED WAITING TWENTY MINUTES IN QUEUE JUST TO GET LOW QUALITY SWF GAMES.
---
I didn't mean it as a nerf or change to ruin. I meant take ruin and slap it into the base kit, i made it weaker because it will no longer be a hex.
---
‚ÄúIve peaked at DBD‚Äù Fast Vaults a window straight into killer

She's fun to play so why not
