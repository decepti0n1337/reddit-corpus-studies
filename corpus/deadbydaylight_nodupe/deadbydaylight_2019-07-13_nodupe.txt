I wonder how she‚Äôs reacted to Amanda being in DbD. Did you ask her any questions about the game??
---
---
---
what in the gameboy looking ass
---
Or watching them loop the killer around the hook
---
Yea if you have Spot range reduction add-ons get a map that has lots of cover hope the survivors aren't aware and make sure there isn't a ton of pallets. He is only fun right now because he hasn't been out as long as the other killers meaning people aren't good against plus he needs RNG to be on his side for maps and pallet spawns plus the perks survivors are running. He is just bad and overrated in my opinion I still like him though
---
maybe ill like freddy more if this was a thing
---
If someones hacking it means their shit so
---
&gt; Traps slow by 15% for 3 seconds, Clown bottles alone only slow for 2 seconds 
---

---
you have more control over your bottles and you chose when to trigger them and they have much bigger radius making it easier to get value out of them compared to snares which have a really small radius ,you can actually walk around them , and survivals can trigger them without even being in a chase
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Fake pallets can complety end a loop because the survivors won't know its fake and waste time. 
---
survivals can only see fake pallets when they're in a dream state ,meaning if you didnt get a hit on them or they arent a sleep ,they wont do much for you ,on top of that a good survival can memorise the location of real pallets and predict most of the time if the pallet is really or not  ,i wont go into the mindgames that both the survival and the killer can do to either trigger the fake pallet or not
---
You or your teammates are not going to win every game. That's just a matter of fact. Rank literally means nothing in this game. Unless you count longer queue times, sweatier players, and top tier perks as a reward, there is nothing of value to gain. Realizing this and no longer being bothered when you lose and moving on to the next game is what will keep you sane. Best thing is to try to let it go and make the best of it 'cause otherwise the toxicity will get to you. 
---
As for tunneling and camping... they are douchey moves but it is a strategy. A dumbass strategy 'cause at most he can get maybe 1 or 2 kills while everyone finishes all the gens, but a strategy nonetheless. Just don't take the bait, let them suffer the consequences, and leave to the next match.
---
I've seen that before
---
Meg when she blows up a gen (as a Meg main can confirm)](https://i.imgflip.com/2tdna2.jpg)
---
Like I said, just say you don‚Äôt like NOED and go, no one is talking about it.
---
That was satisfying
---
Run through grass. as a killer main I HATE when this is used
---
&gt;trys to kill another jeff
---
‚ÄúCorrected mistake‚Äù
---
Okay, but survivors should have something at least a little viable for serious gameplay. MoM was strong, and when they changed it, they attached it to a function in game that doesn‚Äôt work, and this made it unusable. DS was also reworked in a way that makes it even easier for the killer to avoid. Jane‚Äôs perks are all jokes, Ash‚Äôs perks are now useless (MoM was the only viable one), Jeff‚Äôs perks (except MAYBE aftercare, but I still believe Bond or Empathy are stronger) are all weak, Adam‚Äôs perks are useless, Kate‚Äôs perks are useless, etc. Do you get the problem with that? The reason people still use things like self care,  adrenaline, bond, sprint burst, etc is because they‚Äôre stronger than newer perks. They allow you to actually play. These perks aren‚Äôt even overpowered, they‚Äôre just strong enough to give you an opportunity to play. I don‚Äôt advocate that survivor perks should be as strong as Killer perks. I do advocate that survivor perks should at least be viable and useful, and 98% of the newer perks aren‚Äôt. Meanwhile, on the killer side of things, Pop goes the Weasel is meta right now because of how strong it is/Bamboozle gets used often, Spirit fury/Haunted Grounds/Rancor see relatively regular gameplay, Corrupt Intervention has been popping up often, Discordance is insanely strong and sees regular gameplay/Iron Maiden is used pretty often/Mad Grit gets used relatively often, thrilling tremors is used a lot, etc etc etc. killers do have very strong perks, and the killer meta has been constantly changing. Additionally, Spirit is one of the strongest killers right now, and she‚Äôs still relatively new.
---
Nah I just share clips here on reddit. Could be fun to tho
---
Freddy will be reworked in two weeks lol
---
Putting a meter on her power doesnt mean she can't get a buff in other ways.
---
Additionally, not sure why this seems impossible to everyone, you can nerf her and Billy, and survivors at the same time. 
---
If nurse and Billy are the only viables, it makes more sense to nerf them, and balance killers as a whole, rather than buff 14 killers.
---
Also also, if base nurse is fine but add-ons are the problem, then nerf her and shell still be fine with add-ons.
---
Right, but if it remains untouched will it go back to 0?
---
Well for one you don't get as many evader emblem points
---
but in general it's just toxic to try and knock one survivor out of the game as fast as possible
---
if he kicks it again
---
Yes to all of these. 
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
There is no way that 5 blinks will ever be balanced and if it becomes balanced then base nurse would be so garbage.
---
who is he
---
I'd say it applies to lore because the reason Mike is so high is because of the aspects of his looks and music and ghostface has simlar appearance in the face
---
corn blindness is real sickness
---
side effects are:
---
\-small LOS
---
\-mistaking a survivor for a chest or totem
---
\- Scratch mark confusion
---
the best cure for corn blindness is maining doctor or wearing shadborn/M&amp;A
---
but these cures are only 25% effective
---
Wait did I already not say that... I mean it's not like that's the whole point of me comparing it in shitty design flaws. If you don't like noed threads, don't participate in noed threads. You haven't uncovered that I'm some noed lobbyist working for the fucking government lol
---
First Plague cosmetic I'm buying
---
Wicked *sick*
---
Wait isn't evader a survivor emblem?
---
So they waste time walking around them, thus messing up the loop in the first place. And no, Freddy traps have more control since you can be precise.
---
The entire point of the dream world is exactly what you said. That's the way they were built to work. Can you honestly tell me you will remember every pallet and if it was fake or not? Can you honestly say that? Because I doubt most players can. Especially when they haven't even used a pallet in the first place
---
Yeah I don't understand why someone would get banned for abusing glitches in the PTB. Everyone agrees that its a TEST server and has no consequence on the main game. If you discover a glitch, go ahead and report it. But imo what makes PTB games fun is that there's an opportunity to screw around and abuse glitches like that.
---
He needs 2 min trap capacity, insta pick up and faster set time
---
I don‚Äôt know how he has easy tracking when he loses the ability to see scratch marks in FF unless you mean his detection stuff. But he‚Äôs got good stall which sometimes leads to pressure, free hit, regular move speed.
---
I would've downvoted his comment and all of yours if they had 10,000 upvotes.  You(and him) added nothing of value to the conversation.
---
Besides the shadows, the right hand is clearly white anyway.
---
People like having a discussion/making jokes, not reading things like "UPVOTE THIS POST"
---
You can't tell them during a game

Idk about you man but when the killer shows up out of nowhere, that‚Äôs stuffs terrifying

So is tunneling and survivors complain. Sorry I didn't make it easy to win?
---
Thank you you summed it up perfectly

You can send people messages you know, its the 21st century
---
Isn‚Äôt the Friday megathread for this?
---
Im not having a go, i was asking a question! Dont come in here being negative
---
She was around 16 when they killed the cleaner, so I guess the entity ages people up a bit to make sure they hit the arbitrary age of 18.
---
But red makes her go fast
---
Then why do you feel Myers is OP, I apologize for my initial comment, but from what ive gathered most people agree that he is probably the most balanced character in the game, so explain to me.
---
maybe with some rbt timer changes from 2:30 to like 4 mins and higher chance to remove trap it would be cool
---
but you know EGC has 2 mins timer anyway
---
She was 21, IIRC.
---
Okay that's who it is, I couldn't seem to figure it out lmao. Thanks!
---
POV: you got hooked and The Legion has a mori
---
EGC has timer of 2 minutes
---
Reverse bear trap has timer of 2:30 minutes
---
so it isnt the problem
---
maybe with higher chance to remove trap it would make it
---
lmao happy trigger dude, soo pathetic, soo beautiful!
---
The game in general needs a serious health update. They keep going on about game health but literally do the bare minimum to fix anything. It‚Äôs always like a month minimum between patches. PS4 is some of the worst of it too. Absolutely HORRIBLE RNG that literally can decide a game in favor of the Survivors or Killer. Consistently spawning little to no pallets, spawning them all in one section of the map so that entire halves of the map have zero loop capability/safety, consistently spawning hatch directly next to Killer when only one survivor is remaining, consistently spawning both gate doors close together. I could sit here and go on all day about it. I firmly believe that they don‚Äôt give a damn about console players. They have been showing it for over a year or else PS4 would not be in the horrible state it is.
---
Proof that ranking is broken
---
Imagine facecamping and still losing oof
---
Does sole survivor affect BBQ? Prolly a dumb question but I've never thought of it outside of OoO
---
Why tho? You get less blood points for survivor.
---
no they will go to the pallet they know is really 
---
pretty much 90% of the time
---
it does
---
Ladies and gentlemen, entitlement at its finest.
---
Ok thanks appreciate your help
---
Gen rushing is real, but you cant blame the players, the Devs need to either somehow extend the gen Part or add another objective
---
They * smh
---
I tunnel anyone who runs a toxic tryhard build and let everyone else escape with their items after the game goes on for a while.
---
You want to play like an obnoxious sweaty you can enjoy raging while everyone else gets to have fun.
---
And haunted grounds smh
---

Yeah right dude, we all know that the DbD mobile port is the thing we are all looking forward too. /s

OP‚Äôs post is about Left Behind tho...

Streetwise is almost useless and Urban is only used by pro immersed gamers
---
I haven't seen that happen to my knowledge. If I'm in SWF and it says we lost connection to the Host, its all 4 of us so we figure rage quit
---
Really? Poor thing.
---
Joe mains everywhere just took an emotional crit
---
Doctor doesn‚Äôt need one
---
Bill, Meg, Dwight, Claude or Feng
---
Clown, Spirit, Nurse or Billy
---
DRAGON INTESIFIES
---
So while I'm the middle of the loop they just will suddenly leave it upon seeing a trap?
---
Nope not 90% of the time. I've seen it happen once or twice over 20 hours.
---
Again, no it does not. Control and size are not related. A smaller size is more precise
---
true, only terrifying things ingame are Hag Traps, Jumpscare Myers and Prayer Beads spirit
---
I love how everyone got a cold skin. But apparently just fuck Meg. Who actually thought that this skin was a good idea.
---
it's a joke guys, chill.
---
Imagine this as a limited game mode,would be awesome
---
Ghostface is a different person in every movie, in the first one its two teens who die at the end.
---
Maybe your teammates were playing together in a squad, or surprisingly they are all random people who were really nice to you! That's what I call teamwork.
---
I feel very exposed next to this lake
---
I believe in this revolution!
---
If any high mobility player manager to be have all the remaining gens regressed you‚Äôre pretty much screwed.
---
I was going to post the pics I took of the threats but didn't feel like exposing their names would be cool and didn't feel like crossing off names either
---
And my thread is relating to shitty game mechanics that punish you for doing your job, ie noed and partly your problem with the proposed left behind. Are you really this dense? Lol

I mean you literally typed that

Gotta get those 8k points.

What's the movie's name?

Ghostface‚Äôs? Scream.

No shirt to hold back your immense power

I like most of these

learn!
---
Do cooperative actions for 180 seconds. reward: 20k
---
Solo survivors without bond: FFS
---
with the doctor shock 4 survivors. reward: 30k
---
most of the killer rituals are about just using their power lol
---
*also survivor rituals:* hey! remember dwight? that survivor that you have level 10 on him and no perks for running away from killer like sprint burst or even no flashlight? your looping skills suck? Well... you must run away from killer like that for 3 minutes
---
To be fair, playing survivor inst just a matter of your skill, if your teammates are shitty, ur usually not gonna get out, but yeah, some people blame their teammates for them losing chases which is a pretty bull.  
---
but blaming the killer is fine, they did kill you, it's sorta their job to make you lose.
---
Happy Cake day! Hope you have another lovely year of Reddit
---
The first time it happened I went up against Ghostface in SWF and I got disconnected, however my friend said the match had still been going. Normally though when you've been disconnected from the host it does mean they quit, so I was rather confused. I think I had just got booted or something
---
How does discordance provide more information than surveillance?
---
Happy Cake day!
---
It's killer's fault for not putting enough pressure on gens.
---
Smh... no mither, self care, solidarity, MoM with a ranger medkit + styptic agent and Anti-haemorrhagic syringe with a survival offering is the true meta
---
Surprised this hasn‚Äôt been taken down yet
---
Yeah I don't think it would be worth it. If any of them are on here they'd recognize it
---
Literally

&gt;making them with the dream creatures

Again the snares pull you down to the earth to slow you so...

She sounds like she's in pain when she's in frenzy but that probably doesn't count.
---
You've triggered the Gen Snatch PTSD.
---
Will she also be doing survivors by any chance? Awesome way to rep the our mains
---
Dude, you suck. Get better at the game instead of complaining about a mid-tier at best perk.
---
[removed]
---
U right. They should be skulls, because all I see is a dead body on the ground.
---
Fuck yeah I love this video. I knew exactly what it was before I even opened it.
---
It's not about high ranks. It's about not excusing the majority who abuse SWF because "well some people don't, some people just want to have fun" and wanting to balance the game for the sake of casual players comfort. Not using casual as a slur there either. There's nothing wrong with casual play or just wanting to have fun. But again, it's not an excuse to let others run rampant.
---
I actually got accused of camping one game because they kept unhooking after I got 5 feet away from the hook. Like damn you really think I'm not gonna double back to catch one of you? They did that all game and the only time I actually camped was when two people were on hooks relatively near eachother so I patrolled the area to see if I could shock anyone (I'm a doctor main)
---
Oh look, it's the guy that unironically think Object of Obsession is an OP perk LUL
---
Na, you are just distracting from the issue here! You are saying: "hey this is broken so the other thing that is broken is ok now!"
---
You sound pretty pathetic OP.
---
Maps have no cardinal direction, so outside of saying "The Killer is near the Killer Shack" or "They're at the main structure" you cannot provide reliable direction in a game. You've invented a scenario where there's a team of 4 people, each with godlike abilities conveying GPS coordinates on the fly and at a whim. The fact is these types of groups are so far and few inbetween they may as well not exist.
---
I main Object and run it on essentially every game, and sometimes, it's even in a group of people (gasp). The only valuable information you can provide for a team over comms is who the killer is earlier than normal, and that's not a big enough problem to be upset about considering that as long as you're doing your job correctly, they're going to know who you are.
---
Also, burning a cake does not give proof of a SWF either, as people like to earn bloodpoints, so they may use whatever offerings they have. That logic makes as much sense as a survivor DCing if a killer burns party streamers because they might be working with another survivor to farm.
---
Possibly the best meme ive seen on this sub

Then there‚Äôs the occasional rare rip that like ‚Äúthe killer may use king crimson to delete any action you enact in the next 10 seconds following the channeling of the power.‚Äù

Killer can't lagswitch one person. Everyone else moves normally, so there's that.
---
Freddy has been "running" predator for a while now
---
This is just sad

You‚Äôre gonna get tryhard killers so long as sweaty survivors exist
---
Played a match as survivor ‚ÄúAfter playing as killer I can say for certain...‚Äù
---
That was a FeelsGoodMan
---
What does a killer trying to get 4 kills have to do with autism? And that's nothing like a hatch stand off. Hatch stand offs would last half an hour to an hour. A survivor in the dying state bleeds out in 240 seconds (4minutes). Can't be 5...
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank you that‚Äôs so nice :)
---
second part of it seems pretty serious lmao especially dince you used seriously

Good

"You have nothing to lose but your hooks"

I also wonder this..

I messaged him saying gg that‚Äôs tough. He replied with ‚Äúepic gamer win‚Äù good sport about it.

He probably meant you were working with the survivor. Nothing to worry about.

I run Dark Sense so if I pop a gen and there‚Äôs no aura there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôs a T1 Myers
---
Also I hooked the hatch dude twice and tunneled him an ungodly amount, does that look like helping them? Yeah that kid that reported is probably one f those kids you see on golden MODs that scream there lungs out at the slightest thing
---
Just because its "only" 4 minutes doesnt make an awful play-stile right! They changed the hatch stand-off because it was boring, a shity game-mechanic and stalled the game unnecessary not because it lastest XY minutes!  
---
same goes with killers who stall games unnecessary just to get a stupid number they have in mind!
---
This perk would get nerfed with a buff.
---
"My experience is everyone's experience!"
---
Well, it *is* a shitpost
---
Legion trailer has the wrong power associated with it too.
---
I think it‚Äôs too much of a sacrifice is my point. By using it, you‚Äôre guaranteeing a 50/50 chance of escaping at best, all depending on who finds the hatch
---
Yeah, I think that‚Äôs reasonable. I don‚Äôt like the idea of gaining speed while still having hatchets.
---
well, its not my fault either!
---
I'm not sure if I fully follow but is the only way for survivors to go in the upside down is by their own free will? And also what would be the point to that if so if it only has negative benefits
---
kbye
---
and then turns out the survivors cleansed all five totems.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it.  Boosting is when you purposefully work with others to gain higher scores or achieve something usually not capable of doing by yourself. The guy who messaged you was prolly just salty because you killed him. I‚Äôve never even heard of someone getting banned for boosting in dbd though. Usually only games like CoD or something where you can gain prestige or materials usually meant for hours of grinding. Considering every match limits you to a max of 32k bloodpoints it‚Äôs nigh impossible to boost effectively when the time it takes for you to get 32k points takes longer than playing 2 legit matches for 20k each back to back
---
He's slugging for the 4K? I see nothing toxic about it and I USED to do it back when we couldn't close the hatch. Hardly do it nowadays. 
---
I see it a bit sweaty ("Gotta make sure I get that 4th kill!") but nothing toxic in of itself, although being slugged isn't fun.
---
K thanks
---
yea i hate it
---
Boosting usually means someone much better at a game is using an account of someone bad to boost his rank.
---
Imagine a Rank 1 Pro Killer uses a Rank 20 Killer Account and plays with it until he reaches a high Rank. 1-5.
---
Some people expect money from it.
---
In this case,ignore it. You havent done anything wrong its a salty survivor
---
You actually missed her twice so...I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
I think salty is a understatement
---

---
# W H E R E  A R E  T H E  K N I V E S ? ? ?
---
Well I do it too sometimes but the thing I didnt make clear here was that the games I had the killer only hit the second last survivor once and then let him escape and checked the gens if the other guy was doing them so he could find him. He wasnt patrolling the gens cause they were still 2 or 3 to do. So there wasnt like:"Yeah he didnt want to chase that guy down because of the gens"
---
What is your ps4 username?
---
Killer queen has already touched the totem.
---
The Monster can place downed survivors on hooks that are only in the Upside Down. Survivors will be forced to enter the Upside Down once the Monster starts downing people.
---
I second this
---
E P I C
---
Goddamn it I've been exposed
---
It's time for the battle!
---
Hell nah, items can be picked back up way sooner than it takes to get another kill. I get the idea of the perk, so maybe "killer add-ons inactive for 60sec. 1/2/3 times per trial" also that'd take a lot of programming like how trapper traps would be darkened via add-on and then not? The add-on is literally a texture change.  Plus killers use add-ons and are supported by them moreso than survivor items as all the items basically just decrease progress bar time or show you things. A killer would be more punished for loosing add-ons than survivors loosing their items
---
Thought this was serious until I read the flair lol
---
Ah I misunderstood that part. Sounds interesting and hope the stranger things chapter leaks are true :)
---
But it's not unnecessary, the killers objective is to kill all survivors. It's not stalling either, the killer is looking for the last survivor. You could crawl around and look for the hatch, maybe you'll get lucky. And again, what does a killer going for a 4k have to do with autism. I work with autistic kids and I'm really trying to figure out how a 4k thirsty killer and autism have anything in common.
---
I dont think so. To be honest I never seen her draw any survivors.
---
Did you read the flair

He uploads more on his second channel

Nah, I happened to look at your profile and saw you also posted the thing on for honor and some battlefront stuff
---
"Holding the game hostage." 
---
Would you prefer there be a time limit? Waiting out the enemy is a perfectly viable tactic. Lucky he wasn't blasting Hell's Bells all throughout the map just to further get in your heads and make you break your patience.
---
I disagree, doing this to get the 4k seems reasonable for me. If its happening often to you as a survivor bring unbreakable or something. Try to get around the problem rather than complaining about something to the devs that isnt even a bug.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with slugging the 3rd person to go off and find the 4th? I do that all the time
---
Oh come on that wasn't even an "obnoxious" build.
---
I don't get why everyone says Doc gets so many DC's. When I play him I run Overcharge, Unnerving, Distressing, (4th perk, I use BBQ) double calm and a jigsaw piece and hardly get any DC's.
---
This post redefines the definition of low-effort.
---
In a good way.

No ofense but I highly doubt that what you are saying is true.  
---
Autism is a form of developmental disorder which characterizes in difficulties with social interaction and communication. So if you dont get what I was refering to here I cant help you.  
---
The games I was referring to the killer hit the second last survivor once and then stopped chasing him because he wanted to get the other survivor. He did that for over 10 minutes and I saw the injured survivor heal himself up for over 6 times or more. He could have just downed him or hooked him and be done with it but he didnt realise that he was playing with other people that also sit in front of a pc that dont find this sick strategy fun!  
---
It's unsportsmanslike imho. If you dont agree with me I'm ok with that. Not everyone has the same perspective!
---
Legion, the state that my boy is in rn is el nasty.
---
I have some ideas for him, one I got from a meme video, where he is able to 'interrogate' dying survivors, and doing so briefly reveals the aura of all survivors, like Caveira in Siege. But overall i want them to keep Frenzy, but make it do more.
---
First game of the day, picks survivor, The game, big oof, picks killer it might go better, Coldwind Farm, Big OOF,  starts using map offerings, monkaS
---
I never did say they were a race did I? They are a specific type of person, anyways for Wraith and Susie, they did commit murder. Susie wasn‚Äôt exactly forced into doing it, she was coaxed but no one was grabbing her hand and making her stab the janitor. For wraith, he willingly threw his boss into the crusher, even if you‚Äôre angry, you can still have rational thinking. Dwight isn‚Äôt going to kill people in the Fog right? Because he wants to survive
---
Me to sometimes! But do you search for the last 4th person for over 10 minutes? That's really sick imho.
---
Cause knife usually beats fists.
---
Explains the downvote
---
A scam
---
Probably a lag spike that knocked you off the "server"  if I survive with random and I see they DC its usually timed like when they are downed or being tunneled or just before death or of the killer hits them once (I heard aboyt some survivor challenge of trying to survive the game without being seen or touched and if you do you quit and try again. Sounds like  an excuse to me)
---
***Doing Gen's, you?***
---
Dont fall for this scam please
---
This is the 4th time this month they trying to scam people
---
I wasnt pro-hatch-change but they changed it even though it wasn't a bug either! Now that they changed it and I got used to it that killers can deny the hatch escape I find it very good that they changed it. Most people dont like change ;)
---
It's a 4v1 though just tackle the kid and take his knife. These survivors need to start using there brain
---
You can actually play him right now on the test server. I'm not a big fan of the new one myself, which makes me sad to lose my boy ) :
---
New Freddy losses full invis, needing to hit asleep people, gen slow, and aura reading. But he gains gen teleport, and one of two abilities: traps that slow, and fake pallets.

Hes a bit too generic for me now, and that's why I'm sad ) :
---

There's no way they're not a troll
---
Yeah it's a pretty classic build Zane I'm just using yellow add-ons and nurse calling is not useful with him so I don't get it. I downed each of them and they DCed right after. This toxic behavior needs to be banned, especially the first one who does DC.
---
There goes your karma. Heres a rule for Reddit: if you ain't git somethin nice to say, don't say nothin at all. Bunny Feng would be great.
---
As someone who sometimes suffers from pretty bad tunnel vision I hate Claudettes with a burning passion
---
Wait, you watched this for 10 minutes? As in, you were already dead, but you stuck around?
---
Na, either you didnt read my new edited version or you mis-interpreted it. It's not about slugging. The killer didnt down the second last survivor, he just hit him once and then let him escape! slugging is only 4minutes max so thats not that bad.
---
&gt; but he didnt realise that he was playing with other people that also sit in front of a pc that dont find this sick strategy fun!
---
It's not the killer's job to make the game fun for you. If the predator wants to play with his prey before killing it, so be it. 
---
And the killer gets to decide how many kills they want to go for, not you, no matter how much you complain.
---
Thats fair enough, but I still don‚Äôt see the problem with a killer searching for a 4k. Personally I was excited for the hatch change and I‚Äôd be happy to support a change to your problem if it were clearer.
---
That challenge does sound like an excuse- Also I believe it was a lag Spike as well, cause it did that glitch where I ran away and was suddenly teleported back and downed as if I had just been running into the wall. I was disconnected just as the dying animation was ending, and I didn't lose any of my points. I hope he got the sacrifice points for it though- I never tried messaging them to find out.
---
lol you ask a question then say "no shit sherlock" like it doesn't make you sound like a complete idiot
---

oof

i remember that username
---
that was the first 5 blink build xd
---
sorry for my shitty wifi i was not doing this with tought
---
sometimes its just bad lol
---
sorry for the broken game and good for you that you got through the hatch
---
Nothing to say they can't make a certain area around the lower steps  untrappable or add a limit to the basement.  Besides, trappers already trap the basement up just fine, noone is going to put one guy in the basement and then wander around collecting 5+ traps down there unless it's for the memes.  Last point, which I'm not 100% sure on, but isn't there a limit to how close you can place traps already?  If not, then that's also an easy fix for that issue.
---
Well, the "rules" do matter for players who want EVERYONE to have fun. When I'm killer, I avoid doing anything toxic or cheap because I want everyone to have fun, not just me. I'm not here to ruin people's games. 
---
I'm not trying to attack you - just providing a different perspective
---
The so called "bullshit" is easily fixed by the second mate doing Gens if the killer doesnt kill him...
---
If you really run around for 10 minutes without anything happening then blame your mates, its not the Killers fault.
---
We all know which one is most accurate
---
Meh. I see more Ghostface and Legion than Spirit.
---
She looks like she‚Äôs doing a mauri Hakka
---
yes
---
Being completely honest, I wouldn't have seen her.
---
Black and white vs. Olive drab and brown is a similar color scheme?  Also, the belt buckle is like a Texas belt buckle compared to a WWE championship belt.
---
For whst it's worth, I completely missed the shit post tag!  I'd blame mobile, but it displays it fine, I just never actually look at flairs :)
---
They could trap up both entrances and window to killer shack basement and move in and out freely while the survivors can't?  As someone that plays a great deal of Trapper that just doesn't sound balanced.  Just give the man a bag as part of base kit and he is good to go.
---
/r woosh

using the chainsaw when he has NOED hmmmmm makes you think

Wait you just ignored everything else I said and changed the subject? Very suspicious!

and asks bartender: do ya serve any lockers here?

bartender: im sorry iron maiden dosen't like locker dwights

ALL HAIL TO NON TOXIC SURVIVORS !!!!
---
Survivors once told me I was tunneling in a match where I 2 hooked everyone before killing anyone.. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure I did the opposite of tunneling..
---
I wanted to get a closer look at the rusted corrugated metal that looked like a survivor and it wasn't a piece of metal at all. :(
---
He'll just pull you off before gens pop
---
I think you have to actually be running straight at the window for a long enough time in order to get the fast vault. This was implemented to stop survivors from being able to get fast vaults while running into it while they were close to it.
---
Myers definitely. Ghostface and Myers I would say are your best choices. They‚Äôre the most fun to play and to go against in my opinion.
---
The trees are speaking Vietnamese
---
I dont blame here someone it's just my experience and I just want that the devs change the game design so killers get less points if they stall the game this way or make something else more attractive for them so they dont do it in the first place!
---
Spirit is a really great choice.
---
Fun to play, easy to learn but if played correctly she can actually kinda compete with Nurse
---
Myers is fun, but honestly since Ghost Face appeared he is simply the better sneaky and stalking killer.
---
Myers has some fun addons though.
---
I¬¥d go for Spirit or Ghostface
---
You‚Äôre a Claudette. Get over it
---
getting yoinked by Michael (or the Spirit) is literally the scariest thing in this game, hands down
---
I would actually use this for the chests alone. This, paired with Plunderer's Instinct, could help me find a key to open the hatch
---
Agitation is actually so underrated, ever downed a Dwight as he's trying to flashlight you while you have someone in your shoulder? Well with agitation your dreams are now reality
---
you are using cells? then buy only licenced characters with that, the other ones can be unlocked with the currency of the game
---
That and use your ears. Shape has some distinct, heavy ass breathing that can save you from getting grabbed if you don't have that immediate LOS on him.
---
Exposure kills, wrap up warm this winter.
---
It always feels good to pull this off as bubba. I‚Äôve had a few games where someone goes for a risky rescue and I just stand there next to them with my chainsaw out waiting for them to get the other person off the hook like ‚ÄúOk, you get the consequences of your decision now‚Äù
---
You do realize thats not really possible?
---
Would suck if something else gives more points than killing a survivor...
---
Look mate, put your salt somewhere else,especially with these "autistic" bullshit. 
---
Read up on that Illness before you go around screaming killers are autistic, and dont even pretend youre not salty.
---
So it's a yes on buying Myers and ghost face?  I really want to try them out
---
Suspicious is you going from 5 minutes of waiting, to finding out dying state bleeds out time is 4 minutes to waiting 10 minutes. And I still can'tt see how a killer getting a 4k aligns with your definition of autism.
---
and the guy that got soooo unfairly banned for simply asking if the dev's play their own game, surely in a polite manner as well. Either this is a god tier shitposter or a straight up dumbass.
---
Sorry this happened to you. I genuinely don't understand people who DC. It's so disrespectful to everyone involved.
---
I was really hoping someone will agree with me so i can make the choice more easily,  i think I'm going to buy those two then
---
Laurie should just be a picture of a very loud siren and Kate should be the one you had of Laurie
---
Those HORRIFY me
---
Yeah theres more alternatives out here. I only said shadowplay because I use it and can recommend it in good faith.
---
Everything is possible! ;)
---
Same. Even on the second watch, I missed her. Haha.
---
I still love the fact that instead of fixing the trapper bug (setting traps locks your camera downwards after you finish setting the trap, instead of making it snap back up as normal it only snaps up for a second, then snap back down again, then you have to pull it back up) They simply 'changed' it so you don't naturally look up anymore. The game is such a mess that you literally remove a small mechanic instead of fixing it.
---
Yeah and it happened a lot for the last few games. It's just the first one where I have 4 in the same game...
---
Detroit: Become Human in a nutshell
---
Going for spirit once i got the 9000 fragments but now Myers and ghost face thanks
---
At first that seems like another silly licensed killer suggestion, but that's actually perfect. Hunting people down is literally what the Predator does. His power could have something to do with his mimicking and invisibility abilities, like Wraith but his terror radius is replaced with survivor sounds, so you think it's a teammate coming.
---
Qyesoritos are good asf
---
yes please
---
At tier III, 3 Tokens = 3 more seconds, so killer would be stunned for 5 seconds.
---
I haven't played in a while, but I don't remember this being a big issue on PS4 when I mained killer.
---
I hope these problems will be fixed with the dedicated servers
---
Not really, since your left analog sticks still tracks where you're walking forward in-tune to the camera view, so it does indeed help.
---
I don‚Äôt like playing Killer unless I KNOW I have good Add-Ons/Perks. 
---
I‚Äôd rather play 2 average/normal games of Survivor than get absolutely bullied by 1-2 Killer Games, because at that point you basically get punished for not having Meta Add-Ons/Meta Perks for that specific Killer.
---
The difficulty rating is partially decided based on how a brand new player would approach the game and probably interact with the killer. 
---
Just imagine trying to explain the Doc to a brand spanking new player, little to no experience with the game itself
---
"Ok, so he has two modes that you can switch between. One keeps you at normal speed and you can actually hit survivors. The other mode causes you to move slower and generate a field of electricity. Now this field is as large as your terror radius. Oh? Yea, you're terror radius is 32m. How large is that? Uh...well, you'll get a feel for it, don't worry. Anyway, survivors will slowly go mad the longer they stay in your terror radius. Now they closer they are, the faster they gain madness. Now every time they go up a madness tier they will scream revealing their position. There are 3 tiers and they all do different things. Tier one just gives shaky skill checks ~33% of the time and that's about it. Tier 2 also has shaky skill checks and also can have additional effects depending on the add-ons the Doc is using. Don't worry, we'll get to those in a minute. Now, if a survivor reaches tier 3 then they will start randomly screaming until they pass a series of skill checks over ~12 seconds to go back down to Tier 2. Fail a skill check there and they'll scream and have to start over.  No, you can't go from Tier 1 to Tier 0 or Tier 2 to Tier 1.  Also while they're in Tier they can't do any actions except throw pallets, vault objects, and unhook survivors. This means they can't use items.  Anyway, where was I? Oh yea, also while in the Treatment mode (that's the mode where you move slower and generate electricity) you gain the ability to charge up for a short time and shoot out electricity. This greatly increases a survivor's madness level as well as preventing them from doing any actions for a short period. There are add-ons which increase the dinky range of the shock but they come with the downside of causing the charge up to take longer. Ok, got all that? Now let's get into his add-ons which change what can happen to a survivor...." &lt;insert another novel here&gt;
---
Now take the same scenario, but this time you're explaining Hillbilly:
---
"Ok, so this guy has a chainsaw and a hammer. The hammer is your basic attack that all killers have. The chainsaw takes a few seconds to rev up and once it's fully charged you'll start sprinting really fast. You can't turn as well during this and if you bump into an object you'll get stunned for a few seconds. However if you manage to hit a survivor with it they'll go down instantly. And that's about it, have fun!"
---
It definitely scared the shit out of me
---
"jUsT rUn pRemONiTion LOl"
---
This is what I'll miss the most
---
This is when you can't get upset. I legit try not to tunnel, but if I can't tell two people apart, I stop caring.
---
You are wise and you speak wise words.
---
Oh my God I love doing this as Freddy, Remember Me and dream world so the last survivor opens it really slowly but can usually still open it if they're fast enough and really want to escape. Gonna miss doing this when rework Freddy hits live.
---
Nodoby is perfect! Maybe you'll see it someday.
---
Man, I must be doing smn wrong. 60 seconds is always slightly not enough for me.
---

U really didn't got it ? I was defending the use of noed, not the opposite it haha FOR MORE PLEASURE !
---
Yes. Out of all the licensed Myers and Ghost Face are the best, im interested in picking up freddy too. You should look into his rework
---
Then man up and stop crying
---
I play shoalin and black prior evenly
---
Had a Lullaby and a Ruin hex in one of my games. Went and cleansed one, heard the giant "boom" and just assumed it was ruin since I didn't notice there was a Lullaby. When I saw the other hex totem I was like "Nice tr- oh, ruin is still up..."
---
Idk man, Hag is dressed very inappropriately.
---
you need to be a little far away from the window while pressing the vault button, if you are really close to the window, you're going to get a medium vault instead no matter from each angle you're trying to vault
---
The under shirt being lighter than the over shirt is what I was talking about. And a belt buckle is a belt buckle periodt!
---
Ooh, I read that wrong, I thought you gathered tokens, and each token was worth three seconds, and they would all activate on a pallet stun.
---
It seems too strong. (Isn't the monster genderless? Idk for sure, i don't watch the show)
---
I think the overall concept has some interesting aspects, but the monster sounds too powerful. Like, way too powerful.
---
i got my first one on nurse :)
---
i had BBQ, Nurse's, Thana and sloppy butcher
---
good job you :)
---
And Meg is Patrick with the 2x4 nailed to his forehead. Fits both appearance and behavior.
---
Imagine if after putting the mask on all three of the other members jumped in and just started kicking the shit out of David, then they all yelled "pranked" and ran off.
---
Kate needs a cowboy hat with a body cosmetic that has a guitar strapped to her back
---
I only see you crying here!
---
I've always wanted to hide in these lockers with Head On and Quick and Quiet
---
I'd bust out a hundo for these in-game, especially the Myers, Freddy looks like a thot.
---
lol 360's are WAY easier on consoles than on PC
---
here have an upvote
---
Spirit mains be like
---
Considering she has his sword I think you right. Dude is looonnngg dead
---
LOL when I say afraid I mean in terms of their ability levels. They wouldn't be able to pull off such a good-looking model. Also Hag is essentially a corpse, so her skin is mummified... Though now that I think about it, Spirit looks damn fine, so maybe they would be able to model that.
---
I was thinking the same thing.
---
No no, he meant appreciate it in memoriam because the are removing it from the game with the rework.
---
I assume she also killed her father fue to her possessing the sword.
---
Just toxic AF man.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily listen to this advice. I got DS from the shrine.

i mean she has high skill needed but she lets for some  god plays as well

what im telling is she has high skill celling as well high skill cap

At that rank, Doc is hard for survivors because they can't do skill checks well and are revealed easily. Rather than learn to do skill checks and loop, they DC and learn nothing.
---
Scratched mirror makes it 10x worse

So nurse, who ignores all defensive mechanics  (unless you break line of sight) and all structures doesn‚Äôt need a nerf? Lel
---
A killer playing like this is usually ether new and don't understand the benefits of blood point gathering, or they just don't care. I don't think people playing the game with free will that they paid money for is toxic. There is no punishment system, so just join another Q.

My vote is straight up troglodyte.
---
Mods please. Just ban him
---
Yes, but don't expect to have easy times at all in red ranks. Anyways, those 2 are really fun to play (specially GF in my opinion), and also as SirBread says, take a look to freddy's rework, it looks good

This is just a regular basis for me playing as Doc. BBQ, Distressing, Unnerving and Ruin. Two downs later, disconnects. This is in the red and purple ranks as well.
---
When do these skins come out? When the PTB moves to normals?
---
There‚Äôs toxic survivors is every match, so this argument doesn‚Äôt hold up. Killers are so busy worrying about what‚Äôs right or wrong based on what *survivors* are telling us. Don‚Äôt make demands of how others play. I bought this fucking game, and if y‚Äôall wanna be toxic, I won‚Äôt because I‚Äôm not a cunt. I try my best to stick to what makes both teams the most blood points and I try to spread downs on survivors. Being toxic in response to mass toxin just makes the pool more caustic. Y‚Äôall can shape up too, Most killers are already too honorable and nice as is.

Sometimes you have good games and you win, sometimes you don't. I had the high and low back to back

Please no.

Mmm, no.

The people who would be that high up would then quit the game until either rank reset or forever.
---
You're gonna lose something either way.
---
Personally, I feel for this person. I don't like how they "just wanted to try it", but I can sympathize if you're trying to depip from purple to green. Too much stress.

as someone who plays doctor this is common at purple ranks as well

Nah. I wish I would have, I just told her I am a fan and commented on how nice she is to fans.

sarcasm doesnt convey well when you type seriously and expect no one to take it seriously after making a "sarcastic" comment. This is not something you can blame on the stupidity of reddit.
---
You don't have fully teleport to the Gen to apply pressure. Just make the blood come out and survivors run away.
---
wait till survivor struggles off
---
The rework is neat, but doesn't really keep in theme with the perk. Maybe something like:
---
*You're determined to escape the beast..... no matter the odds.....* no matter the cost. You will both receive a stack-able repair speed bonus of 80/90/100% for every generator that needs to be completed, *and will receive a 80/90/100% bonus to exit gate opening speed* when you're the last survivor in the trial.
---
Exaxtly
---
woah hey look there‚Äôs mine üëåüò©

I'm not quite sure how that's cheating but okay nice talking to ya.

Well that‚Äôs when they‚Äôll start, but they only put one or two out per week
---
Is too much to ask for the killers have the power like every other horror game? If the alien in alien isolation was like the killers in this game that he would  be a joke but the alien have the power and you are scared of him you know like a terror game
---
That‚Äôs just how orcs work.
---
Rin and Lisa (Hag) are definitely victims turned Killer. Rin being essentially a restless avatar of wrath because of her own brutal murder at the hands of her father, and Lisa being a young woman kidnapped by swamp cannibals and basically picked up by the entity when she invoked any power that would help her escape her captors.
---
Though Bubba is too, if I‚Äôm being honest. Dude would probably be a normal, albeit developmentally disabled, adult had he not been raised by a family of violent cannibal butchers.

*prays for kate first week*
---
Looks like Feng is having a heated gaming moment. Must be leaving a comment on the Killer's profile page.
---
Ya know, iv played for awhile and have never really ran into any toxic chat. Usually pretty courteous and have a quick gg maybe a comment or two about something that happened and that's it. Wonder if I just have sweet luck, if my servers are in a nicer area, or if the level of toxicity is being blown out of proportion.
---
What happens most often is the killer leaves before anything gets said, maybe 1 or 2 ggs get in there.

&gt;7 Reasons Why White People Should Not Wear Black Hairstyles
---
&gt;It also means leaving something alone if you learn that it‚Äôs not possible to borrow it in a respectful way
---
&gt;So when someone takes a piece of what my Blackness means to me, and puts it on like my identity is a costume, I feel like that‚Äôs all I am to them.
---
&gt;In the US, people have a variety of reasons for straightening their hair, but for many Black women, it‚Äôs a matter of survival, not just preference.
---
Continues to go on about how black women copying a white woman's hair is survival and that if she does it she will receive less hate but thats a load of bullshit because racist people don't give a shit about your hairstyle they will hate you regardless because of your skin. Its all entitlement.
---
But continue to go off sis about how hairstyles really affect people when they dont.
---
Are you denying this happens? I've seen butthurt killer mains claim that 'excessive looping' is toxic. Yeah, fuck me for trying to stay alive right? I should just let the killer catch me.
---
Kindly get lost with your shit stirring.
---
Funny shit is, I‚Äôve had this happen to me against a Hag before lmao.
---
if there are 4 Survivor, the game Starts after 60 seconds, no matter what and you always see 4 survivors if there are 4 players

---
Poor Trapper :(
---
Thrill of the hunt: *am I a joke to you?*
---
How do you not have more upvotes on this? Thank you for doing this
---
I think it was 60 for an autograph and photo combo, just fyi. Cool that you're going, hope to see you there!
---
&gt;you are talking like anyone gives a shit about points
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I don't care about points, ... even if I get 1000 points and depip...
---
&gt;And as surv I don't care either, I want to have fun juking the killer, not doing boring gens and getting points
---
&gt;Also, I am rank 1 in both every season since the release of the game...
---
These are conflicting points of view. You can't say that you essentially don't try to win, just try to have fun, while saying that you're rank 1 every season (seasons are monthly), and therefore try to win and pip. Can't have your cake and eat it too my dude.
---
&gt;And as a killer I am going to camp if I see some motherfuckers playing swf wanting a free ride on the festival, because that will make them salty at the end of the game where they will run to the chat to insult. And that's what swf deserves.
---
If you simply want to be a salt mine against all p3 bloody Claudettes, then fine. But don't go saying all swf groups are people who play the game like they're in a tournament with $1M on the line. Some swf players are just looking to have fun.
---
&gt;The thing is, if you play both sides, it's terribly easy to see how unlabanced the game is. At low ranks, the killer is a monster playing with puppets. And at high ranks, the survs are just using the killer as a pinata to troll him and make fun of him.
---
While I agree that the game has balancing issues, and that at low ranks killer has the upper hand and the reverse is true at high ranks, to say that it's near impossible to win at rank 1 killer is a drastic exaggeration.
---
&gt;... won't also play swf cheating the game rules with voice and use broken perks.
---
Using voice chat as survivor isn't cheating by any stretch of the imagination. Sure, it gives you a decent advantage, but it's not breaking the game, otherwise the devs wouldn't allow it. What survivor perks are broken? Seriously, most 'great' survivor perks are simply counters to specific killer strats, like tunneling or slugging.
---

---
Jesus christ. Rip in dead her.
---
I'll possibly be juggling, so if someone's juggling red/blue/purple balls, that's the reddit guy
---
Well this is a blast from the past. The reason why I say that Discordance provides more useful information is because it not only tells you where survivors are, but it tells you precisely where it is most important to apply pressure, breaking up groups, discouraging cooperation and slowing down the game as a result. Additionally, Surveillance only functions on generators you have already interacted with, making it useless at the start of the game, the point at which Discordance is the strongest, since survivors often start together and will often be able to complete a gen before you are even able to get across the map.
---
So to answer your question: Discordance is stronger than Surveillance because Surveillance is a locational perk that tells you when survivors go someplace you have already been, while Discordance is a locational perk that also slows down the game in a similar way to Corrupt Intervention or Ruin, and tells you were survivors are anywhere on the map from the start of the game.
---
Hex ruin, sloppy butcher, bbq, nurses. But just depends on what works for you.
---
He‚Äôs fun at all ranks. He just plays really differently from the other characters.
---
Spirit can run no perks and still get a 4K you got this bro
---
Eh its shitty but honestly you're dead anyway as survivor so it's just a half second of oh hey hes nice before he slams it shut and you just think oh aight hes a cunt. Like that shit doesnt rage me out the way most survivor shit does. Tunneling will tilt me out of my fucking mind though. Camping I don't mind cus hehe fuck off you're leaving with 12k points and a derank.
---
Considering 2000 of those hours are waiting in lobbies, that's not too bad :)

Dont forget about the ivory mori

---
I love when it happens because it genuinely scares the hell out of me and I get a good laugh.
---
Send help ;-;
---
in the movies freddy absorbed the souls of his victims maybe that
---
He was quite dumbass too. Why he didn't hit the survivor during the first hook? Then she would have run away  to not put her ass in your place and he would have had the free hook. LoL
---
It's an ultra-rare add-on iirc that let's the hag teleport to whichever trap she set without it being set off, however it does give her a 15 second cooldown between teleports
---
Oh you know what I actually thought I‚Äôve seen it before but it was actually that same squidward picture for Jane alone, not the whole meme, My apologies
---
The scene in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre where Bubba anxiously paced around after killing one of the teens always interested me. He looked like was questioning if what he did was right because he was acting on his own without any guidance from the people he lived with.
---
Ah, no worries!
---
But if I‚Äôm remembering correctly, the Hag didn‚Äôt always teleport when it happened. The ‚Äúfake‚Äù Hag jumpscare would pop up but it would just melt back into the ground and no real Hag would appear. I have some clips saved from a while ago so I‚Äôll find them and check, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what happened in this case.
---
I love how all the comments on that Tweet are either "Demogorgon for DbD" and something that has happened already, being the ST-Fortnite crossover.
---
It's supposed to be the "soul" of the survivor, being dragged into the dream world. This is a reference to how Freddy pull people into a sleeping state in various movies (though only being confirmed that he actually HAS this power in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: Dream Master). 
---
The animation for the souls, matter of fact, appears to be taken directly from one of the last scenes from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, but in the movies they are the "dream demons", responsible for bringing Freddy "back to life" whenever he dies in the dream world, and also the ones who made him who he is after his death. These dream demons are seen flying out of Freddy as soon as he is killed by his daughter, apparently with no direction because their host is dead.
---
How could you know that they were toxic when you brought the ebony mori? ü§î
---
Then it might be range add-ons
---
REEEEEE
---
Yknow i would hope survivors who play against me would say im fair, difficult, and not a god damn troll. Its just so upsetting that people do this for no reason.
---
Yeah he wasn‚Äôt the smartest I think he just wanted me dead so bad lol
---
I would be happy with any of those feng ones but the third ones hair I need !
---
That sounds about right, thank you.
---
Just found out that on ps4 if you hold x and drag with the cursor you can rotate your character. Never seen this done before.
---
Laurie learnt some tricks from the Spirit
---
Pffft. Wraith with Windstorm and Ghost add-ons make him super sneaky when pulling people off. I've done that multiple times, poor bastards never knew. XD
---
I found it amusing and didn't want to say anything until I found out I wasn't the only one.
---
It's only toxic if your camping waiting for then to get unhooked. If I walk away to find more people and the guy who was hooked gets unhooked and runs into me I ain't letting him go. Same if someone runs in to unhook in my face before I get time to leave. I'll slug the guy who got unhooked and start the Chase with the guy who made the bad save but if the unhooked guy is still slugged by the time I down the person who saved them then sorry but I'll be coming to toss ya back on that hook. Take it up with your teammates for not healing you off the ground and the person who went for the save before blaming the killer for not following some made up rule
---

---
NEED
---
I've experienced a bug recently in which killer radius doesn't come sometimes.
---
Truly a masterpiece
---
Completely contradictory to how DBD is played. 
---
1. No Terror Radius, Red Stain,  or other telltale signs that alerts the Survivor to the Killer's approach. To make things worse, both Legion and David were running from something, meaning that there was another person in the trial with them. Only other *extremely* farfetched possibility was another Legion member was the Killer, which would mean that there were **two** Killers on the field at once. 
---
2. It doesn't show any reference to the Killer's powers, and, in fact, shows a completely incorrect power which appears to be imitation of some sorts, leading to David thinking Legion was one of the other Survivors.
---
3. It also shows a 1-hit instant death, which is for dramatic purposes of course, but still unrealistic to how DBD trials work out.
---
I saw some news about, but didn't know we're already able to play.
---
If it makes sense for them to tunnel you, then they will. The point is to give you a CHANCE to get away. If nobody else is near, of course the killer is going to go after you again.
---
Holy crap that cosmetic look really cool on Huntress
---
i looked it up in the app store it ain‚Äôt there. only a really shitty rip off
---
I have the seven free killers, and I refuse to play nurse or hag so using killers like the doctor and trapper in rank eight is unbelievably hard
---
Nobody respects each other nowadays in videogames
---
‚ÄúPay to win‚Äù is such a stupid thought. Like, because someone bought a certain killer? Two of the strongest killers in the game are free to play lol you could never spend a dime on the game aside from the initial purchase and be a god-tier killer, and you could spend the $70-$80 to buy every killer and still suck
---
Say your prayer beads.
---
Nobody's threatening the survival of the Killers.
---
Classic asian move ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I'd actually swap these. If Leatherface's chainsaw just worked more like Billy's he would be a lot stronger with being able to bait pallets and not slow down as much when revving. The Doctor on the other hand needs some more heavy handed adjustments. Not a full rework, but making his shock stun more consistent while also being more useable in chases would make him much stronger.
---
Is that an actual outfit for her? I always thought Meg was from the 1940‚Äôs and the entity could pull people in from different times. Guess not if she has wireless earbuds

Susie and the gang has the come down with a case of the Entity.
---
DS is a good way to buy time. It won't stop a killer who is 100% going to tunnel you regardless, but it will make them lose more time and pressure to continue.
---
Plus after you use DS, you can't use it again so you then become an easier target to kill.
---
Aren't her father's glasses an add-on?
---
I would interpret that as a trophy after the kill, so personally I think that maybe the entity let her have him
---
Yeah but his pizza is fucking vertical
---
Destroyed em
---
But is the Anna thicc?
---
Yesss! Me and my bf play as swf, only us two usually. Nea got hooked in the basement, I went to save her; caught in a bear trap outside the window. Same for the Adam except right in front of the door before I get fully hooked. Then finally the final mistake, bf came to save and stepped in one at the bottom of the stairs. I laughed my ass off on that one. Shit suckedüòÇ
---
Just use prayer beads and ez 4k (For real though they should remove that shit, it's absurd)
---
As i see from the killers name he's either brazilian or uses drugs, and neither of those play by the rules
---
What kind of logic is this? 
---
"Oh, I'm sorry sir, I didn't realize you've been caught twice within 60 second. Please excuse my rudeness and I'll leave you alone now."
---
I don‚Äôt play killer often, usually for a daily. I was playing the trapper one day though against three blendettes and it was funny but a little sad how they‚Äôd try to hide right in front of me up against a tree or something. I have to admit the commitment even tho I‚Äôm staring at them was really good lol. Several times they‚Äôd try to hide right in my face and it didn‚Äôt work. Almost wished it would have :‚Äô(
---
As much as I‚Äôd love that for the argument, it‚Äôs already confirmed from multiple flavor texts from items and addons that all items and addons are ‚Äúpoor replicas‚Äù of the real equivalent.
---
i was the killer xd
---
REmove Nurse's blink and replace it with nothing she's so OP plz I have 1000 hours in this game ebcause skill correlates directly to playtime rather than capping out for different people at different levels based on their willingness to learn and understanding of both sides of the play expereince
---
If they are doing gens and not being altruistic its still rushing
---
You are either brazilian or use drugs
---
Either way the rules of gaming does not apply to you
---
Take your damn upvote, that made me chuckle.
---
The killer must've been so confused
---
They should bring it back on kills. Freddy started absorbing the souls of anyone he killed starting in 3, after all, even if Reboot Freddy didn't do anything cool.
---
The xkcs of cartoons
---
Kinda fucked up your brackets there buddy
---
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
---
*Yes.* If you're a killer and you tunnel somebody, you get shit on. So most killers who are good at the game and don't need to tunnel, literally will avoid tunneling. 
---
As a killer I can often forget who I killed last, and DS is a friendly reminder that I am unintentionally tunneling someone. Personally I move on to the next survivor. But that's me.
---
Guys he's making fun of you, there is no way anyone is THAT entitled. Right?
---
She looks greek
---
Tunnelling is the most stressful accusation for me because I often have to choose between tunnelling and just ignoring a Survivor to go back to wandering around.
---
I'm just hitting people I see! I'm sorry you have one guy who's really bad at not being found! The last time I let one off the hook (so to speak) I got genrushed and only killed one with NOED, so it's not like there's any courtesy counterbalancing the demand for no tunnels.
---
Wait, how small is Mike's terror radius?

Im a whole ass bitch and get scared out of my mind every time i play against a half decent killer. Hell, i jump when a teammate appears out of nowhere.

It's not fine just because the devs want it. It has to actually lead to enjoyable gameplay.
---
Technically it should have slowed at the end (which might have let the others escape), but the devs break the EGC timer more and more every patch

If you want to get it early you can watch this https://youtu.be/JM4skqjAyEA

I'd take it as my dog meat!
---
Obviously you're supposed to pretend you can't see Survivors or hear any loud noise notifications and really just go for a hike while they rush gens and leave.
---
We are always here to kink shame anyone
---
Consider that the game shouldn't be designed in such a way that you need to memorize a code of ethics to play it without accidentally being an asshole.
---
In tier 1 with monitor and abuse, it's 0. :3

Slugging is also toxic, though.

Damn she didnt seem to age a little bit.
---
Imagine running Billy with noed... pathetic..
---
Why do they have to play by your rules and let you go? They found you, so they‚Äôll try to kill you. That‚Äôs the objective. 
---
If you want to let survivors go when they DS, that‚Äôs fine. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that all killers have to play that way.
---
I'm not sure how practical it would be to code, but the fast vaulting during an ambush is a really fascinating idea that I've never heard before and I think has some potential. There is a lot of funky things she'd be able to do with that assuming she doesn't bug out and fly up into the sky. Additionally I think that reducing the crouch duration to one second at base and turning Combat Straps into a series of add-ons that increases crouching movement speed, like Ghostface has, would be a strong change.
---
I'd only be up for this if survivors could see killer dc rates. too many killers dc during events when survivors bring 4xBPS
---
Seriously, you could have titled the post Injured Meg Mains: and it would be no different.
---
I‚Äôm a Meg main and love collecting her different outfits. But this... this shit is atrocious, why did they play her like this üòÖ Not because it‚Äôs cornrows, but because it‚Äôs MEG with cornrows, just don‚Äôt lol
---
Its just to buy time and maybe get away, but killers who tunnel will always tunnel no matter what. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs nonsense when people try to argue ‚Äúif survivors (generators) were slowed down and killers had more time, they wouldn‚Äôt tunnel or camp‚Äù. Bullshit lol. They would continue to play that way only be more successful with the extra time given. Just run DS and Borrowed Time every game. There‚Äôs a reason on the official forums DS is constantly complained about and killers want it nerfed again.

I don't argue that. I'm just saying that most of the people who play them have the worst internet connections and ruin the game for everyone else
---
Chances are that they won‚Äôt come into the basement unless it‚Äôs very close to one of the gates. If it is, then just go to a corner of the map.

I don't know what did he expect haha. These entitled survivors haha

Why does she look like she was in that episode of Friends where she got braids to tame her Barbados hair?
---
Ruin, haunted grounds, thrill of the hunt, devour hope. You need a pink add on for it to be at its highest (the one that makes you go fast I‚Äôm spirit walk but you can‚Äôt see scratch marks. Here‚Äôs a link to it being played. Pretty OP if you have the stuff for it. https://youtu.be/uXb4V6V7Kz8
---
Like groceries!
---
There are quite a few killers who's abilities I don't think even need to be changed, it's just their add-ons that need looked at.
---
The Nurse needs her Multi-Blink and Omega Blink add-ons either significantly nerfed or removed entirely. I don't think that she should ever be able to blink more than twice and she needs add-ons that reward hitting survivors after only blinking once.
---
Hillbilly needs to have Insta-Saw removed and Carburettor Tuning Guide should be a Very Rare add-on instead of Rare.
---
Spirit needs to have Prayer beads removed entirely and Yakuyoke Amulet should probably be an ultra-rare.
---
Huntress's Iridescent Head should not stack with Infantry Belt.
---
Myer's Tombstone add-ons should not exist.
---
The Pig needs most of not all her add-ons completely reworked. Fuck it, give her an add-on that brings back her end game potential.
---
Leatherface needs to have his Chilli add-ons actually do something for him.
---
Load out, perks, cosmetics (sometimes) whether they teabag or not, and a few other things I can‚Äôt describe. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just something you learn to see in survivors.

I made this before freddy dropped and we had Quintons PNG file. :)

Do you play killer?

I can't tell if im being whoosed here. Doesn't matter tho i forgot to flair im going to have to reupload this

No they don‚Äôt, you can check recent players when the match starts

Nurse she's seriously broken
---
I'd also like to know.
---
If you do decide to buy a killer make sure it‚Äôs legion first. One of the best DLC characters for sure. BBQ and Chili from leatherface ks a really good to perk to have as well.

Well, you and Pizza Dwight. Pizza Dwight is love. Pizza Dwight is life.
---
It'll be really early in the morning like 5 or 6am eastern. Not sure the exact time but I know it's around then
---
Oh, you should definitely unlock as many perks as possible (you‚Äôll end up unlocking knouckout if you unlock BBQ), but the ones listed are great starter perks to have on any killer, and are extremely meta.

If survivors dont have to get a double pip killers shouldn't have to either.

Do I have to unlock knockout before I can get BBQ?

So many opportunities to down the body blockers as well. He was tunneling you even when you were being carried.

I had none of the two, it must be higher on mobile. Might also be because the aspect ratio of my tablet is 16:10.

I‚Äôd tapp that

Yeah where did he get an Indonesian murder knife? Wasn't he in highschool?
---
Knockout is 30, and BBQ is 35. BBQ alone is worth it cause u can see where people are after u hook them - PLUS, you can get up to 100% more bloodpoints if u hook 4 survivors. You can get so many BP with it.

Dave (creative director, story lead) talked about this. He said that in his vision of it, the father was taken to a mental institution, and she was promised vengeance on her father, but her father has since snapped out of his madness, realizing what he has done, and she is in some way oblivious to the face she‚Äôll never get her revenge.

Busey would be too fucking loud! üòÇ
---
Yeah, unless you get lucky and have a nice killer that respects your 4% and let‚Äôs you live
---
It's how I play almost exclusively. It's great fun, though you realize soon how often object of obsession and no mither  pop up together very quickly.
---
The original trailer featuring the early characters is far superior to the current intro, IMO.
---
Legion should be reworked out of the game. Underpowered, overpowered, I dont care. Legion is incredibly boring to play against no matter what.
---
The killer would just stand there and down you again. If you were caught and the killee didnt give you the hatch youre dying.
---
How does this mindset not work well? Also what type of rabbit hole are you referring to? If you are getting cranky pants for having maybe one out of every five killer matches be face campers then maybe this isn't the game for you. Being killed as the survivor is also apart of playing the game. You don't always have to escape / make the most points to have fun moments.

Bing Bong players are *always* like that. They either lag switch, tunnel and/or camp.

&gt; Dead by Daylight Pins Collection, SDCC 2019 Pre-sale
---
&gt; Gecco is launching a pin collection from the asymmetrical multiplayer (One Killer vs Four Survivors) horror game, Dead by Daylight. The "Perks," which give abilities to the players, and the "Items" for Survivors to aid the matches are recreated as pins, just looking like as the game's icon design.
---
&gt; We'll offer some pins from the lineup for SDCC 2019 attendees ahead of the public release! 
---
&gt;Survivor Set (Sport Flashlight, Worn-Out Tools, First Aid Kit) $30.00
---
&gt;Killer Set (No One Escape Death, Thrill of the Hunt, &gt;Ruin) $30.00

Look, I know people are telling you to get knockout teachable in Cannibals web, but if you k ow you aren't going to use it ever, skip it.  If you buy the teachable, it'll make you less likely to get ones that you want.  For example it goes from 1/40 chance to 1/42 or 1/43, depending on how many perks you actually want from that character.  After leveling 5 killers, that's up to 1/55 for BBQ if you get all the teachables.  
---
  
---
If you decide you want knockout later, you can comeback to leatherface and get the teachable out of the web.  Until then, I don't think you should get it.
---
So THATS what ive been doing wrong the while time
---
The only solution is to never, ever, touch my totems,or you will feel the pain of losing everyone you love and watch me curb stomp the hatch in front of your eyes and mori you with my 5 stacks of devour hope.
---
Scratched Mirror Myers isn't that bad. At least when I play him even on Lery's I'm lucky if I can get a kill. Survivors piss their pants though and I find gen-grabs funny as hell. 
---
Now THE GAME on the other hand can be miserable. Especially if you hit escape, see the Jigsaw Piece at the bottom (Which means the killer used it), see Unnerving Presence appear and electricity form below your feet.
---
Noed and ruin are wrong
---
Thank you !
---
 Yeah but rather not:D
---
I‚Äôm just saying if it was me, I would have thrown the pebble at him just to rub that in a little
---
The killer has already won at that point. Why give an extra thing for survivors to complain at them for?
---
one didnt they decided to stay and heal and got killed by the entity

I‚Äôve been playing on ps4 for half a year, and haven‚Äôt played against a nurse once
---
That's why I think Legion is so freaking terrifying.   
---
They are buddies, they did goofy silly stuff all the time, even making friendship bracelets. They are real people. Hillbilly and Trapper are hard to buy, but the Legion? Kids with knives. Some who are forced to do this, and some who grew to be great at it. It's spooky
---
Damn thats fucked up
---
I never said it was ‚Äúok‚Äù but never do I read people bitching about it.   I also rarely see survivors derank (bc you can‚Äôt dcing) but see killer mains do it more. 
---
Let people have fun. If red ranks are brutal go derank to have a chill game. Isn‚Äôt that why killers lobby dodge??? To have a chill game.
---
Can i ask for that guys name or his friends?? So if i find him i can specifically tunnel and kill that guy or his friends?

&gt;Nothing was off-limits when they put their masks on

Ghostface can be terrifying... in theory
---
It's details like this that I love in games. I've always been a sucker for Mortal Kombat and the way they develop their characters, it's not so different than dbd when you think about it (esp with mori, etc). 
---
I'd love to see them continue to develop perks for old killers or tweaks that don't affect balance at all!, e.g for Legion an illusion of the other 3 members standing and watching over you while you're on the hook, it could be a perk or it could be just a cool visual to support the lore.
---
Never
---
I'm new on reddit, that's why I uploaded only one picture.
---
It's my first cosplay, but I have many other legion pictures, if you want to see it.
---
Maybe I'll do another cosplay in the future:)
---
Just looks like what he already wears with a few belts lol
---
Reminds me of my old SMITE days. Hopefully they'll rehash the old kit into a better OC killer. Might as well, since they made the whole "dream/wake" system.
---
Feng pc comes with a built-in mouse and keyboard! WHAAAAAAAT
---
Well, I get to do this once, since I'm sitting on the offering for it.
---
Can't wait to get genrushed and called a baby killer.
---
Ju-No it.
---
Wait, spine chill doesnt counter tier 1 michael?
---
Not everyone rage quits though. I often get kicked out of the match for no reason, so de-pip, and zero points. While my friends only see the DC icon above my name, even though I didn't DC, the game booted me.
---
Or the client crashes, this or the other.
---
It's totally random.
---
it's supposedly said that when you prestige a character, you get rare items more often, but that was proven to be not so true... So either way it's just totally random.
---
*gets facecamped for knowing where ruin is*
---
I think a punch would be cool but I think you should be slowed while having a wind up for 1 second then punching so you couldn‚Äôt just instantly put someone in tier 3
---
"sandman" would be a great oc killer
---
I knew I had seen this meme before

if i looked like quentin in game i would rather ignore it too

So what is the point of playing any video games ever? Let me guess, it's about the friends we made along the way.

The survivor buffs are greatly weaker than the killer buffs and the nerfs much stronger than the killer nerfs. A good killer will 4k most non swf lobbies anyway these days...

I always felt Meg was an angsty closet lesbian teen from the 90s whose parents sucked so she went running with her walkman/discman etc to chill out, then got murdered or nabbed by The Entity (or an agent of it,) but maybe I‚Äôm projecting my own actual life experience onto this entire thing. Easy to do when Meg‚Äôs entire story is about 2 or 3 paragraphs.

That game was fucking beautiful. Hoping for a sequel.
---
I play on mobile and this happens all the time
---
There is a counter to BBQ and Chili, just jump in a locker right before a hook and boom, you are unseeable. I do this every game in case the killer has BBQ and Chili. Get out after a few seconds and grab that Dweet off the hook
---
Exact situation happened, plague didn‚Äôt hit a single survivor much less vomit on them for 5 gens then was running the perk everyone knows... and I died an untimely demise. (Tried looking for totems btw, couldn‚Äôt find em and didn‚Äôt have much time)
---
Jesus could you cry a bit harder?
---
You don't need mouse and keyboard, killer on console is fine with the new engine.  Dude is just a master race PC pusher.
---
That would be awesome, you could easily come up with small, aesthetic changes that would really add to the lore and characters. The other members for Legion, a timer or ticking gear for Pig, lullabies for Huntress and Freddy, Flash photography sounds for Leatherface, regular shutter sounds for Ghostface, the bell for Wraith, the chainsaw for Hillbilly, Distant screaming for the Nurse, and "Here comes the Trapper" for the Trapper.
---
As if anyone can find anything on this map in the first place üòÇ

It‚Äôs not that deep.
---
https://youtu.be/DioxNMpQdzM
---
Nope I'm not toxic as far as I know. I don't teabag, I'm not a great looper, I just do what I can. Once the gates are open I leave once I know everyone is safe. I definitely did not have a facecamp coming.
---
But there's no survivors with killer-based cosmetics.
---
Everybody stops playing survivor because they keep getting nerfed and killers become stronger. Why do you think it takes 20 secs to find a game as survivor but 20 minutes to find a game as killer?
---
The thing is if you implement the token system you might as well have devour hope. It‚Äôs far more rewarding
---
You're right it is super funny. 
---
Thank you for stopping by!
---
Bravo, I suppose I did ask
---
I really hope so, and I only prestiged two characters so far. Can't imagine it for people who have been playing for years.
---
No such thing as an infinite anymore.  They've been gone for a long time now.  People that still think they exist create them with pisspoor play.
---
Is that your unfunny way of being funny?
---
You would be correct mate! [Here](https://youtu.be/7eKv4BEujFU)
---
I can't believe that was less than three minutes

Yeah I know what happened.  The game decided to pair you against a swf for running NOED on Billy lol.

that david got everyone killed lmao

Tried that. Got angry friend requests instead

That works but you can also just find survivor behind corn/objects who would be impossible to see otherwise.

That and the fact that this technique is much more trustworthy than my eyes.

And make it so we dont have to wait until the end of the match to talk, just keep the messages there and like u said just show a message that they've left

take MY downdoot
---
I‚Äôm a legion main and I can‚Äôt deny this because it‚Äôs so true
---
Honestly I think that the Pig would be in a fine place if she just had a bigger selection of useable add-ons. She is more in need of having her's looked at than any other killer. Most if not all of her add-ons should just be scrapped and completely reworked from the ground up.
---
Why are you getting ready for the purge now? It doesn‚Äôt happen for like another month dude...
---
Put a dot in the middle of your screen using tape/erasable marker. That will help with aiming.
---
When it comes to the super short loops, Huntress starts to crumble. I personally like Spirit Fury and Enduring on her so this problem is remedied. Some people can do just the right hatchet placements to hit people through the debris.
---
Bing Bong = Best Boy
---
it's indisputable
---
I play survivor and I genuinely only stick around to make sure everyone gets out, I don't like tea bagging and I hate the fact I have teammates who use it as a taunt. Like just take the win and leave dude.
---
If it does make you upset that they're doing that, the best things you can do is just face a wall and be completely disinterested in them, they normally try to get your attention so you'll come running. And then when they leave before EGC ends, just exit the match and take a minute to calm down. It's what I do when I have particularly crap games.
---
I was happy until you dropped that pallet
---
No one is going to recommend this, but put overcharge and pop goes the weasel on every killer. Trust me. Dew it.
---
*crys in Behemoth*
---
Thank you very much for this response
---
just sitting here watching the game, smoking some bud
---
why would you run enduring spirit fury on a spirit?
---
pop goes the weasel looks hella good, will probably play clown after cannibal
---
As others have said, if you're hooked as last survivor you're basically fucked. I guess if the hatch was still open and you had decisive strike you may have a small chance. 
---
I would rather the end game timer was increased for a last survivor. It's almost impossible to get a gate open now, and sometimes the gates are so close together the killer can almost just stand still between them. Your best chance is to get a light up on one gate and get away before the killer comes to that gate, then rush to the other gate and hope you can get that one open within the time limit while the killer wastes time searching at the other one. This is the only way I get out. But it's hard, and time is really tight. If the killer finds you you're basically dead in chase because of EGC timer. Even if you managed to lose the killer you've got no time or chance to open a door.
---
I‚Äôm just wondering why you decided to go with ‚ÄúBig Chungus‚Äù as a name...
---
Because why not? I‚Äôm bad at making names
---
You cant make killers with a power like an horror movie because this is a multiplayer game. If you make a killer too powerful the game will be only a survivor kill farming and in a couple of time nobody will play survivor anymore cause nobody wants to get just killed again and again, and the game will just die. Killers are obviously stronger than a single survivor but a team can win against a killer. A single survivor can't do 5 gen and escape obviously. In a single player game there are powerful killers because you can try a level again and again and if you are good enough you can pass the level. In a multiplayer game where the killer is a player it's a lot harder to balance everything. Think about an fps for example: you play the campaign and maybe you face 4793747292 enemies in a single level and you can pass it if you are good enough, now go play multiplayer and face the same amount of enemy alone, you will never win!! Imo dbd is one of the harder game to balance.
---
Yes its part of the game and yes its just survivors doing their objective but it doesnt mean that is not annoying and unfun to go against. Especially when playing a killer that cannot do anything about it no matter how much they try and can only win through survivors mistakes.
---
Dude looking for totems in that map is like finding a needle in a hay stack. Let alone hexs.
---
Yeah he's great for herding in pursuits and has pretty good perks all around. I run coulrophobia, unnerving presence, distressing, and sloppy butcher on my trapper. If I get nurse's calling it's a wrap.
---
how do i recreate this lol, i saw a bill doing something like this the entire map (he was couched the entire match
---
Maybe with the new Predator game they could do a cross promotion thing?
---
upvote for you sir

---
The perk/leveling system is drastically better imo. The bloodmarket is okay but I'd prefer to choose which killer I'd get addons for.
---
Idk if this is replicable this happened while the Billy was lagging really hard
---
Bad news, it‚Äôs 100% glitched and impossible currently since the ghost face update. If you check psn profiles you can see the last achiever was on jun18th and on the dbd forums theres various posts about it on all systems so it‚Äôs broken for everyone
---
I don‚Äôt get why people dc. You get bloodpoints for random shit and you didn‚Äôt get any bloodpoints because you were so close to hatch, but ghostface comes along and takes you out and closes it while he teabags you. You at least get some bloodpoints.
---
Most of the time hes just a regular m1 killer, getting some instadowns here and there.
---
my friend just got the game and i told him "don't unhook" and he says "wait why? I just unhook myself" I could never get him to stop trying to unhook after that.
---
An American werewolf in Lerys
---
Spirit fury/enduring on Huntress?  I mean...how do you not bring ruin/nurses/BBQ at minimum, and then something like Whispers. Those are the the best  Huntress perks. Whatever works for you, but I just wanted to point out to OP  that that combo is definitely against the grain.
---
I'm a rank 1 or 2 survivor on Playstation, looking for people to play with who are good but also chill, nice, easygoing, a bit older, don't get mad at their teammates, not Trump supporters (lol).
---
Literally the BEST map for totem placement and it‚Äôs just like,
---
‚ÄúNaaaaaaah. Imma put it right here. Pretty good job.‚Äù
---
Dont do gowon like this XD
---
People complaining about genrushing, body blocking, tunneling, and perks like ds and noed are all just mad that someone is using a legitimate strategy that worked against them. I play both sides and I get a fair amount of both. At the end of the day its just a game tho. GG GL HF
---
What‚Äôs the game called on mobile?
---
damn that sucks hope they will release a fix for this
---
We stan LOOŒ†Œî!
---
I love Rusty Shackles. People somehow get a lobotomy when you use them and then call you a sweaty, autistic tryhard even when you run an all hex meme built lmao.
---
I mean... there must be people out there who easily hit a ruin skill check. It doesn't mean that ruin is a bad perk. I find huntress's lullaby a good perk on certain killers like doctor and old Freddy. It takes a while til it takes its powerfull form, but it can be ok in general, but not as bad as you described it tbh
---
Because it makes the game unfun, both for them and you, plus it makes you lose points.
---
I sometimes hook survivors next to hatch and leave it open just in case they are lucky enough to cobe
---
Yea I just found this out too
---
Why not just put Shaggy in Dead by Daylight instead
---
Pretty sure when the Trailer was made, Legion had something very similar to Ghostface's current power.
---
...but then they got the License for Ghostface, so they moved that power to Ghosty for development. They had to release a new killer, since they'd already promised it, so they proceeded to make Legion as quickly as possible, resulting in a Trainwreck that needed to be basically removed from the game after a couple months.
---
Laurie is LOUD
---
I facecamped the last guy on hook
---
If I get beat and they do that I will stay at the gate and look down so my killer looks sad. You can't see them looking down either. I've had survivors take the Entity kill doing that lol.
---
I use stridor instead of sloppy.
---
I grabbed them all. Even No Mither.
---
Lol yeah that sounds like a good way to do things. But I'm fairly new only playing since a few weeks ago and just got into green ranks so I'm still not fully used to survivors having good strategies lol. So rn I'm just doing what I did to rank 20's
---
Decisive strike isn't anti tunnel is 1 minute of the survivor getting to do whatever they want or the killer eats the ds
---
I typo'd - the artist is hitthetower.tumblr.com :)
---
Not much different on Xbox. You get tunnelers and campers and sometimes face campers. Luckily we also have toxic survivors that can make the killer dc real fast.
---
i‚Äôm a rank 8 how many would i need to pip?
---
I have more then 10 days on this game(rank 1-5) and I‚Äôve escaped every single nurse I‚Äôve gone against except 1! And I looped that nurse the whole game and all my other teammates did gens and got to escape so nurse just isn‚Äôt good on console if you can loop her that long.
---
I had a game earlier this week where I let the last two out and they yelled at me in the post-game chat for being a "kill are friends" and "playing wrong".
---
You can't win with survivors!
---
But if they were all in a movie who do you think would die first?
---
Yeah true but go up in thread and read that don‚Äôt wanna copy and paste. Nurse is bad on console and everyone that doesn‚Äôt main her or get destroyed by her would agree.
---
Good hiding spot idea though, might use
---
My first few months on the game I never knew, just thought it was a beard stroke, but even after realizing I still see it as a beard stroke to this day
---
I think that was God screaming
---
Rank 5-3 so yes he‚Äôs not op, on some maps he just suck big entities tentacle
---
I just got this game because of this post. The survivors are all AI I think.
---
I had a challenge to open a gate with Feng the other day and I was more than 99% when the killer snatched me off of it. I thought I had it... I thought I had it!
---
Your not wrong
---
I legit only downloaded this app just to make a handful of DBD memes bc tbh I love this meme format
---
Its an honorary thing...so many survivors DC to protect their rare items, so leaving a rare item behind has become a tribute.
---
The killer doesn't get anything for it, its more of a 'spirit of the game' sort of thing.
---
I hope Carl "The Llama" is the next killer.
---
For Xbox?
---
Do gens and when the killer chases you try to distract them for as long as possible for teammates to do gens. Look up vids on looping tips and you‚Äôll get the gist and learn from playing. Also playing with friends and having communication will help you so so much so try and find a couple friends to play with and you‚Äôll be in your way to greatness :). Also some good perks: decisive strike, borrowed time, balanced landing, adrenaline, self care, dead hard. There‚Äôs a couple more but those are some I could think off the top of my head.
---
Gotta say that i only have seen this stuff when a killer is complaining about it on this subredit. So why don t you just play the game and ignore our laugh at the few stupid accusations you get.
---
How dare you abuse a woman
---
No. You just need to get better.
---
I‚Äôm not a particularly good survivor either but I was in your boat about a year ago! Played for a little, never improved past like rank 15. Now I‚Äôm around rank 4 (but rank 1 a few months ago but I do not recommend lol). Honestly, it just takes finding a perk load out that works the best with your play style. For me personally, I‚Äôve recently been running Iron Will, Resilience, some exhaustion perk (Lithe or Balanced Lansing), and Adrenaline. This is because I don‚Äôt want to get found, but I can‚Äôt trust my teammates to heal me and I can work faster this way, I‚Äôm not the best at looping so I give myself a sprint to attempt to get away, and adrenaline bc I‚Äôm tOxIc and like the benefits if you get to the end of the game. 
---
Additionally, watch some YouTube tutorials for the basics on survivor strategies. Don‚Äôt be overly altruistic (I am) as that can get yourself killed when you‚Äôre working on your skills. Try to notice how killers in general play to try and outwit them. 
---
It may give you a headache but this game does use a lot of strategy and trying to outsmart the killer. 
---
I think at first focus on keeping yourself alive. Run perks and take items that benefit solely you. Because if you can‚Äôt take care of yourself than at first, it hurts your other teammates and your own rank. 
---
This is just my personal opinion and how could be of no use or help to you, and others might have other advice hopefully. :)
---
Little do they know that I'm 5 blink nurse
---
More than you did at rank 9 since 8 is purple ranks
---
If you wanna play Jeff, play Jeff.  Discouraged of how loud he is? Put on iron will.  I main Jane and have iron will for that very reason lol.
---
You know you can see the traps on the ground right?
---
The intro of the original has a flashing camera sound. Pretty iconic.
---
But it comes far less from killers
---
Probably talking about the hag rework that came out last summer, the one that made her traps actually do something and that made her high tier
---
My bad :/
---
(you've never played tuber simulator?)
---
At that point they should bleed out immediately
---
I've had people be assholes for less. Unhooked a nea and then quick and quited into a nearby looker a few seconds after because someone was getting hooked by spirit across map and I knew she had bbq.  Nea spammed the locker trapping me there. Got me hooked and the entire team left me on the hook. After game chat she said I should have healed her and quit hiding in lockers. This was at rank 4. Just ignore the assholes lol.
---
Is pimpin easy?
---
Ugh, this hurt my feelings for you lol. 
---
Run whatever perks you want, that you enjoy and that helps you... Wear whatever the fuck you want.   
---
Shit, you ever see them just keep being nice to them and help them as much as you can. let them feel like shit... or leave them on hook too lmao. 
---
Good luck on your next games ‚ô°
---
Why?
---
What a godlike picture
---
I wish I had teammates like that.
---
Idc I‚Äôm swinging first homie
---
I‚Äôm simply responding to this person‚Äôs analysis.
---
Wanted to watch him die, as the other 3 spectated
---
My build that I can use 99% of the time to get to rank one is hex ruin BBQ nurses calling sloppy butcher with prayer beads and fathers glasses
---
So I'm using these 4 Perks, but since I'm relatively new, I don't know what is best for me. What perks would you recommend with what I own. If it helps, I am a person who is careful and secretly does gens.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure your looking for r/dbdlfg
---
That's why I bought shape over ghostface. The moment a killer comes out survivor mains automatically start bitching that the killer is too op. Then when they win they say Gg ez and this killer needs a buff.
---
Ashy Slashy as the new killer
---
gen rushing doesn't apply to situations where you are bad at applying pressure  
---
gen rushing is when the survivors coordinate an effort to get gens done and solely that  
---
4 engineers  
---
4 brand new parts  
---
4 prove thyself  
---
4 spine chill  
---
Etc etc
---
If you‚Äôre relatively knew then I assume you are at around rank 15-20? If so, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be getting too much use out of Small Game since you won‚Äôt be versing totem perks very often. Maybe swap it for we‚Äôll make it, if you ever go for unhooks. 
---
Overall, you seem to be using good perks considering what you have. A lot of the best perks are teachables, so I recommend leveling up different survivors to 40 to get them all.
---
Is this legit?
---
Urban evasion is good then. But put away premonition and Small game. Rather get Iron Will from Jake and maybe Prove Thyself from Dwight. Thats the best gen/evasive build i guess. Also if you get chased balanced landing isnt always the best. Maybe get Dead Hard from David or Lithe from Feng.
---
basement bubbas never leave the basement, the only winning move is not to play his game
---
I recommend playing killer a little to observe other surviver habits. Ive found alot of crafty hiding places that I would have never thought to use and  you start to see what perks are really effective for survivors
---
If you are new I guess you face a lot of campers. Or even if you don't use Kindred. Damn, it's a strong perk. Lightweight could be also good, if u have it on level 3. Killers might loose you when you cut the line of sight. We'll make it is decent for fast heals right of the hook. Hope might be good but for a little bit mote advanced people. I don't know how often your team manages to repair 5 gens to make Hope active :)))
---
Holy shit this meme died so long ago
---
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see a Kronk meme, I upvote.
---
I mean they weren‚Äôt really being that cocky.
---
DEEEEVS FIX PLS
---
r/dbdlfg bud
---
this is more likely to be a deathgarden hunter, or a stalker reskin like the terminator was a reskin for the poacher
---
I think balanced landing isn't for beginners. He should try lithe cause it's easier to use
---
humanoid* killers, because their model is easy to work with.
---
The monster has 2 arms and 2 legs I assume (I don't watch Stranger Things, but it sounds cool). So with that model it can work.
---
What is this format from lmao
---
Didnt have to facecamp them to do that.
---
Yes mama!
---
I'm in a bit of an annoying position since I'm rank 13 and a lot if killers are rank 10 or higher, so my team and I often make it to the end. And of course I face a lot of campers. So would you say that I have to swap premonition and small game for we'll make it and lightweight? Or maybe swap urban invasion?
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter lol, he was the last one alive and I just stared in his beautiful eyes
---
in awe of this absolute david-level Chad
---
Small Game is a really good perk. do use it for now to memorize most tot spawns and only then remove. cause honestly it helped big time, now i do all totems within 2-3 minutes of the game that is including not exactly looking for them but mostly going from gen to gen or checking the spawns in chase.
---
noed is a very frequent perk on green ranks and even on red lots of people use it so knowing where exactly totems are will save you and teammates a bunch of times, trust me.
---
Small Game is still a perk i use sometimes and i have near 3k hours. it's a bliss on Lery's. 
---
to other things, i'd unlock Self Care for start till more confident with a game, i used it up to 1k hours in a game because frankly on ranks lower than red it's better to play off safe than sorry. so switch Urban Immersion to Self Care. for when you're more confident, do unlock Decisive Strike and switch it with SC.
---
We‚Äôre not gooing to check out your stream Todd
---
Just seems odd theyd say "camping trash" if they were the only ones alive unless you were really camping all game.
---
Then i could say the same for gen rushing, it's unfun for the killer and he can't do nothing about it (a killer can't interrupts every gen if this is your answer, cuz as soon as you start running after one survivor, the other will just gen rush your ass)
---
I had the add on that lets me keep the key even if I die so I figured I may as well slap on my other add-ons, it was pretty useful
---
I have never not gotten a pip from a 4k.....
---
The only way to disarm them is to set them off, but if you do so when Freddy isn't near you, they should be fine. BUT, unlike hag and trapper's traps, Freddy's traps are VERY easy to see. So the counterplay is to avoid them in chases as opposed to "disarming" them.
---
This made my day thank you
---
Honestly I‚Äôd recommend finding 4 other people (I‚Äôd be willing to help but my PS4 broke down) and play a kill your friends game. Try making an account on the dbd forums to also find more people to play with. Because watching these YouTubers and streamers are one thing but once you get into the fog it‚Äôs a whole different experience!
---
You might as well use wake up
---
Nah. Spirit beads is broken though and phasing collision should probably be a rare addon.
---
How the fuck is that toxic? Hahahah it's actually really good idea. You have one less survivor rushing gens.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
there are multiple different layouts of maps. and every map has unique totem spawns. but you'll just feel them in a bit, you'll know the totems are there. every time new map comes out, i slap on Small Game and go totem hunting every time i get the map.
---
to get a teachable from a specific character you need to level their bloodweb to 30, 35 and 40. no point in playing them, just need bloodpoints.
---
also another hint, while you're a new player, do play more killer than survivor. first of it will give you better bloodpoints disregard you killing people and also will teach you what to do as a survivor observing other players on the map. watch closely to what confuses you as killer and how other survivors deal with loops. 
---
start with something simple like Wraith or Trapper.
---
Memorizing a code of ethics....  lmao it isn't very difficult to memorize this code of ethics.
---
There's even two options of how to memorize it.
---
A. Don't be an asshole
---
Or...
---
B. Treat others the way you want to be treated
---
Difficult right?
---
The hag has the right idea. Do what you want and ignore the haters. As long as you dont BM and have fun thsts all that matters.
---
Dude you don't need to spread downs on any of these toxic assholes. Play the killer to win your 4k no matter how you do it. The survivors have PLENTY of opportunity to win. If you rush a kill that's one less survivor on the map doing gens. Don't let the cry baby's tell you how to win.
---
Ah, okay, thank you!
---
More the fact that we don't believe you
---
They need to release a map that's completly dark and where the flashlight makes seeing easier but also be seen. The Killer has slightly better nightvison. That would be scarier
---
My favourite activity is gen grabbing Megs with him. No idea what it's about Megs specifically, but they never see me coming
---
The laugh when you get pulled into the dream is the best for me.
---
you're welcome. good luck in the fog and good hunting!
---
and don't let toxic players bring you down. just have to warn you community is extremely bitter and salty. my theory is it's because the game is in a very unstable place, you don't have enough control because of hitboxes, autoaim that fucks you over as killer, other people sandbagging you, stupid bugs and so on. so just... D: i don't know, i get upset a lot. so frankly not my place to give advice of how to not get upset in the game :c taking a break also doesn't always work whatever people say. 
---
talking out the frustration here and to my friends though helps.
---
Try restarting your game. I just got moved down to rank 10 in both.
---
Play how you want but that's not how a real homicidal maniac killer would act. I show no mercy. Ever.
---
Nah she hella dummy thicc bro
---
I mean sure if you're roleplaying... go for it.  I think a homicidal maniac killer would chase after the guy that tried unhooking someone right in front of you though instead of tunneling the guy that got unhooked.  Maybe that's just me.
---
So you just want the killer to ignore survivors gathering around the hook? Why are you so against camping? Camping only works in the killers favor if everyone is trying to save the hooked survivor
---
One more question though, sorry for asking a lot :D Do I need to stop leveling up my main and go level up different survivors, or do I just level up my main a bit more and then level up others? Also, if I need to level up other survivors, which one(s) do you recommend me going for first?
---
Damn.
---
Your so full of shit hahaha
---
Don't hit people on hook unless they've been toxic...
---
The match making has been total trash lately
---
Urban Evasion is strong but if you climb the ranks it gets annoying for your team and is countered by many killer powers and playstyles, plus there's just more effective perks.
---

Jumpscare pallet slams are all the proof I need to say that survivors are the real killers.
---
It's a pity her puke doesn't melt the faces of her victims, now that'd be some Mortal Kombat fatality stuff.
---
Yeah I remember I heard it from somewhere. Thnx vsauce
---
I guess not hitting people on hook equals sympathy now. 
---
Dude sounds like he feels real power after killing pixels. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs ‚Äúroleplaying‚Äù as a killer on Reddit. Let him go.
---
That just sounds like even more reason to play the newest killer tbh
---
need merciless Victory complete bullshit if you ask me
---
But think. Now you can do bubba‚Äôs basement
---
Your should have really let Faery upload these herself as she is in the process of making them. If you want to use these ones you've made for yourself that's fine but I would take them down
---
If they're so potato they don't realize how low the counter is I'd wager.  The same survivors that die when they stay to teabag the killer but don't know quite where to stand while doing it and end up getting picked up before they can crawl out.  That shit in particular always cracks me up on both sides.  If I see you do that as a survivor I just let him have you and dip lol.
---
not an outplay by any means, neither were they toxic.. stupid, but not toxic. just green ranks stuff
---
Adepts require getting a merciless victory while having 4 iri emblems in all categories *and* using the killers 3 personal perks
---
Trust me on this one, they still exist and are very well alive. It‚Äôs just up to you whether you commit to the chase and waste time or go patrol gens.
---
Personally I just do it when the killer played like filth and camped with gens up.  Save the BM for the dicks that deserve it I say.
---
Oh yeah. Her range game makes Huntress look like a chump who's not worth picking up and learning. Why deal with hatchets when you have corrupt purge?
---
It‚Äôs also a gen rush though if they have specific builds to do so, eg swf all with toolboxes+ addons  and certain perks (the Dwight one, I can‚Äôt remember)  which allow u to pop gens in seconds flat. U can‚Äôt blame survivors for doing it, but the devs, it is at times too easy to do this with set ups, if the killers an idiot that‚Äôs their fault
---
When dealing with Freddy, in ANY media, this is just solid advice
---
You used to be able to get up there with Nurse.
---
Hex: Ruin can be good, but‚Äôs it‚Äôs so inconsistent, which is the problem. I‚Äôd rather just use other anti-gen perks like Corrupt Intervention and Pop.
---
Imagine an adderall item lmao
---
I wasn‚Äôt insulting it, just making a statement I noticed on most Legion Masks Cosplays. I think if you fixed the thickness of the eyes/mouth and had the mask a little rounder as opposed to oval it would be good.
---
I did say I liked the Suzy Mask too.
---
It‚Äôs amazing, I wish I had that while I play DbD
---
Since the End Game Collapse update, came the mid-chapter after Plague.
---
No.  Infinites were removed from the game a long time ago.  The term is still misused to label a particularly strong loop area on a map.  It used to refer to broken map design that allowed survivors to continuously break chase during the loop creating a literal "infinite".    These were all edited and removed from game.  The term is no longer factually accurate in this game.  Every loop in game can be chased and downed at this point.  Obviously there are loops that are more trouble than they're worth and should be strategically avoided whenever possible but that still doesn't make them an infinite.
---
But she got the ‚Äûescaped‚Äú bloodpoints
---
Can't, people love to play with high brightness aka the mood killer for most games
---
*skill check misses and adrenaline pops as you‚Äôre being hooked*
---
We need a bottle of adderal as an add on to a medkit. Make it so that you'll be 25% harder to fall asleep. Sure it's useless on everyone but Freddy, but damnit I want it.
---
Hell just make Vigil work against every status effect in the game and give it the aforementioned effect.
---
Yes it is.
---
Honestly she's so underrated... shame she only has two mid tier perks with her.
---
This is so sadistic but so beautiful at the same time.
---
The director of the show is trying to make an evil dead 4 which takes place right after the show, but bruce Campbell doesn't want to return as ash.
---
Make a killer one
---
Next time they release a cool new "original killer", they should make nice little short film featuring it, a new survivor and 3 old ones with the same type of cgi that they have made the trailers with. Make that 15 or 20 minutes. Something mind blowing to really get even more players interested.
---
Theres justification if you wait 20-40 mins for a game. I remember watching tru3talent in the past and every month he would go through that. After the emblem changes around March it was almost impossible for him to get games at red ranks. The devs themselves said previously that this was due to survivors ranking up slower (why that still hasnt been fixed i dont know)
---
Deranking from red to green would be bad yes, however dropping a few ranks so that you can play the game you purchased without having to wait 20mins+ everytime.....yeah I can understand where they‚Äôre coming from. You say ‚Äújust play the game‚Äù, but thats literally what people want to do in cases like these but they cant due to queue times. Some people have busy lives too. They may have an hour to spare one day and they dont want to waste it in a lobby
---
I have no issues whatsoever hitting Lullaby skill checks (unless I'm reading something while playing). I land the majority of my great skill checks for Ruin, too, but even then miss more greats than I miss Lullaby checks.
---
Now Ruin plus Lullaby, that's good. In Theory, anyway - in practice, at least one of the two never lasts long enough for them to synergize effectively.
---
Im pretty sure they mentioned this in the patch notes a bit ago, or atleast they talked about it
---
Unfortunately the game does not support LAN play.
---
Now everyone is exposed
---
Her new skin turned me into a Huntress main.

That's for her "escaping" a chase, not the trial.

The issue isn't SWF, it's that using third party coms gains a rather unfair advantage, omegablink Nurse is making use of the mechanics already built in the game.

Lol fair but with getting put to sleep with getting hit by Freddy, I was having issues just figuring out how to loop him with the snares...
---
I was the only one left...
---
I‚Äôm brand new to the game, looking for people to rank up with and chill out. If you‚Äôre up for it add my psn CM_Plays
---
Happend to me when I was playing cannibal yesterday.
---
Its all fun and games until the hillbilly starts holding M2
---
as a jane main i can say that this is 100% accurate
---
You can't wake up someone if you are injured I think
---
 you should have people on hooks so no one can physically finish gens, but again you could just be a bad killer
---
\*Laughs in Slugging and NOED\*
---
Dark Devotion is too situational to get much use. Against experienced players that don't really care about the terror radius as much they'll just sit through it until they see the killer, and against newer players they normally don't run aura perks (except kindred, deja vu, dark sense) they only really run to non-SWF teammates if the killer is on them anyway.
---
Corrupt is super good at segmenting off areas to patrol and get a good few hooks in early for a snowball and prevents super genrushing, especially if paired with Discordance.
---
Infectious is also really strong on things that can do damage away from the killer, such as Deep Wound Legion against noobs, trapper, plague and huntress and also helps protect you from flashlight saves and also helps snowballs.
---
Did anyone disconnect or did y‚Äôall take y‚Äôalls L
---
why did i read that as "guitar strapped to her neck"
---
People are getting downvoted for being polite nowadays lmfaooo
---
But weren't you t-bagging the Feng?
---
Buying survivors is not a great idea in my opinion. They are all the same, so I just reached level 40 on all of them for the teachables and then P3 Jake (my main) and I unlock all perks on him and I only play him. I wait the shrine for perks that are not that useful (I only need 5) to unlock all of them.
---
When carrying Ash I hear ‚ÄúAAAAH YEAH‚Äù
---
I was not injured when i tried the last time.
---
Hillbilly did nothing wrong. He was just an ugly duckling.
---
Captions should be inverted
---
adiris probably saved a bunch of people then leaving the town when she had the plague
---
Yes 
---
It counters all auras
---
Nurses calling too
---
Or even scratch mirror myers
---
It's only frustating when you are trying to get the Blood on your face trophy and people keep disconnectingüò≠
---
This was beautiful until the teabag at the end which makes you as bad as them really.
---
There was this P3 and they t-bagged their teammate so I let the 3 escape.
---
Took about 15 minutes. Finding the images was the hardest part. And thanks
---
Lol another perk to use with OoO and sole survivor
---
When only survivors could tbag: Is only game, dont heff to be mad because a bit of banter and crouching, dont be a baby :DDD
---
Survivors with Introduction of Ghostface: WOW so toxic omg im so offended, fuck you you piece of shit
---
I recommend watching videos on playing, any information on improving is great and can improve your skill a lot. As i‚Äôm sure you know all killers have their own 3 teachable perks which are super useful. I recommend playing a little of every killer, seeing which ones you like the most or the ones that work best for you. I‚Äôm currently a ghost face main and my one tip is to use you‚Äôre insta down ability as much as possible. 99ing a survivor and then exposing them when you‚Äôre close enough to hit them is crazy effective.
---
You forgot about insta heal medkit :)
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs a joke chill.
---
And insta heal medkit
---
Nurse is free
---
bloodwarden has another effect that shows survivor that are inside the exit gate
---
I know but the auras are usually red
---
i‚Äôm on the grind to red ranks again since rank reset just happened. good luck man, tunneling sucks :(
---
Yes i play on consol
---
Are you saying the killer isn't slugging? That's good isn't it? He is potentially giving both survivors the chance to carry on playing and escape. He may want 4K but wants to get it 'fairly'. Alternatively he may just be determined to find a cowardly survivor who has been making absolutely no attempt to complete generators and is likely waiting to steal a hatch win at the expense of the other survivor who has been trying.
---
My personal opinion which I've expressed many times is that slugging one survivor and leaving them to bleed out while you scour the map trying to find survivor 4 with no idea where they are is shitty. Not slugging is not shitty.
---
I do not slug unless I know I where the other survivor is or have them in my sights. Also, if I find one particular survivor is clearly hiding and not trying to do generators while the other survivor is, I would do what this killer did, and once I've dealt with the coward I may well let the other survivor escape.
---
Billy and Nurse are better and they take less skill(though Billy also takes less skill than nurse so...). Both are free. Should we nerf all the payed for killers into the ground so there is no point to buying them?
---
You too.
---
Replace that with escapes and you got my games so far.
---
god i love this &lt;3 well done.
---
Someone on here before said she played dbd with her son after she found out Amanda was Added to the game shortly after she was released
---
DBD is the only multiplayer game I've ever played where I have to actively think about someone's feelings over trying to win. It's just bad game design
---
If they are injured you can‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre injured you can.
---
lmfao
---
pretty accurate
---
He was a giant scary wolf, back when MoM was broken
---
If they did it right I think they could be successful with a 5 minute one
---
Hammer of dawn from gears of war, raam confirmed for 13th killer
---
Try to run close to objects so they bounce off of them
---
The comment above. You can't if they are injured.
---
That makes sense in that case. Thanks.
---
It doesn't say that anywhere in the patchnotes afaik.
---
I'm cumming rn
---
Is this new? You used to be able to.
---
&gt;  whatever the hell that noise was
---
Scientific answer: That was just Alert's sound effect being repeatedly triggered. 
---
Real answer: Spooky ghosts appeared, and teleported you on to the roof.
---
I think it is, was waaaaay too long ago i played against prepatch Freddy. And it doesn't say anything about this in the patchnotes.
---
Billy better than Spirit? No, just no.
---
USING EBONY MORIS AFTER RANK RESET MAKES YOU A DICK
---
if you see a leatherface find the nearest window 
---
he is now a m1 killer (it's not that simple but leather does get hit pretty hard by windows)
---
Ah ok
---
You can if you just add them on Steam.
---
Yeah. At best they could make it have no bonus until all totems(no running hex perks, you won‚Äôt get your bonus) are annointed and give it a massive cooldown and make the totems not glow it would be close to Just Powerful and not Completely Broken. Imagine this with perks which speed you up or make it easier to get to the totems.
---
It's not nearly as bad on Reddit as it is the Steam forums. I have a specific name for players like that.
---
Loop tight around trees/tyres when LF activates his chainsaw. He will hit the tree/tyre stack and have to reset
---
I think this is one of the most unbalanced concepts i've ever seen
---
So you need scratch marks to track so you think Billy is better than spirit strictly because he‚Äôs easier. Well Trapper is easier to play than Nurse so he must be better, right?
---
I‚Äôll help you real quick. You can‚Äôt loop a spirit. You can‚Äôt outplay a good spirit player. They will just listen for your actions. If you have iron will, whatever, but if not, you will lose 95% of chases against a good spirit player. 
---
Billy can scream around the map but half decent survivors will make him M1 thus negating his instadown which wastes his time. What is good map pressure if you take twenty years to down somebody because you‚Äôre getting looped. 
---
I have three theories. You‚Äôre either new to the game and haven‚Äôt been in high ranks often. You‚Äôve barely played spirit because she‚Äôs ‚Äúhard‚Äù. Or you‚Äôre mimicking a certain streamers viewpoints rather than your own.
---
Every day I'm shuf-shuf-shuf-shufflin'
---
In addition to everything other people have said about why he's not op,  it takes sixty seconds to fall asleep, not thirty.
---
I like her performance in the Saw movies.
---
No ruin = 3 gens done in under 140 seconds - you are full of shit b, rank 3-1 killer here.
---
U spewing ‚Äúget gud‚Äù isnt going to help the long understanding that the game is too survivor oriented, I promise you, only YOU feel that u can survive in red ranks without running ruin or running nurse. Its not a healthy game without running ruin and pop goes
---
If they put it on after all the gens are done
---
I have barely played spirit because i hate the playstyle. I use scratch marks and blood to track survivors and then abuse them to find others. Funnily enough survivors tend to be in the same general area so i can abuse it to find more. If i played spirit and gave her a ton of effort maybe i could be good but it‚Äôs not the right playstyle for me. I don‚Äôt even play billy he is just an easier concept and a better fit towards my playstyle so i consider him easier. Same issue with Nurse, she doesn‚Äôt play how i usually play so i can‚Äôt use her, making her worse for me. Objectively, Spirit may be considered better than Billy, but in my point of view Billy is better because i can use him, compared to spirit who i can‚Äôt.
---
RIIIIISE UP!
---
RIIIIIIIIIISE UP, CHILDREN OF  THE EMPIRE!
---
RIIIIIIIISE UP, STORMCLOAKS!
---
RISE UP, STORMCLOAKS!
---
At some point you just gotta ignore them. It makes no sense to discuss with such people
---
She should have worn her brown pants today!
---
That is a fair response and I understand. Not everyone enjoys all killers or understands the best method for playing them. 
---
You may not know a killers full potential because you don‚Äôt enjoy playing them or they just don‚Äôt match how you play which makes them worse. 
---
I‚Äôm not too big on spirit either but I can‚Äôt deny her power.
---
WhAtS SaWcOn???
---
I‚Äôm gonna use this for the third one
---
Emm, dude, in r/fivenightsatfreddys many good people
---
Lullaby gets destroyed even faster than ruin to make you more tilted
---
So if you get tunneled by the killer it's your teammates' fault? Wtf is this logic.
---
Except BL, these perks are not meta and almost never run at high ranks.
---
B\*tch slap
---
The irony is insane. "Why did you nerf Freddy into the ground?" "Nerf him"
---
Honestly I never DC but games where people are farming off the hook I kill myself early. If you see your 3x teammates hiding and not contributing its a wash anyway. My logic was kill them off as well. Can't possibly be fun for a killer if survivors ignore all objectives just to hide all game.
---
Just saying a gold perk that you buy that somehow impacts the golden toolboxes would be cool
---
I wish there was an add on to play classic Freddy just for the memories
---
Yes but right now we're only talking about technically 2 in-game. The other two are just cosmetics and names. Right now the lore just talks about Frank for 90% of of it which is funny because he's the least popular and Julie a little bit.
---
Also it's weird that any negative opinions towards the Legion on the Reddit get downvoted to hell and back but endgame the legion still results and disconnects and anywhere else online they are universally hated as they should be.
---
As a killer main I could comfortably say the legion are the worst thing added to dead by daylight. Hands-down the most toxic killers I've played against because it seems like every week There's a new exploit for the legion.
---
Imo LF should be in top tier. It‚Äôs retrying as all hell to see someone killing others while they‚Äôre wearing their victims face.
---
Watch me.
---
I do regret putting him lower now tbh I‚Äôll just do it again but with him at the top.
---
Um. It is my understanding that Sole Survivor does not work on BBQ. Did BHVR change the interaction?
---
One day you‚Äôre gonna see and understand the shit black people go through on a day to day basis. Things you‚Äôve never even felt and will never understand bc of the privileges you have. And yea I get it , your life sucks bc you‚Äôre a worthless sack of shit. But that doesn‚Äôt mean black ppl don‚Äôt suffer. Black people wear cornrows knots and braids and get fired/written up at work. They can‚Äôt wear their natural hair styles at school without being harassed. So they wear weaves! And them asking for white people not to wear their hair styles bc they don‚Äôt and never will get the racism that black people feel from it is a very minuscule thing to ask for from a race that‚Äôs been treated like shit for centuries.  Black people aren‚Äôt in a position of power to take weaves and wear them in a offensive way bc guess what.... white people DONT feel racism.
---
You do realize that bigger maps are buffs to survivors? Mount Ormond, Mother's Dwelling, Yamaoka etc are bad maps for killers mostly because they are huge.
---
How much have you played legion?
---
People will disagree with you on this.  
---
As do I.
---
As an example:
---
Let's say there are as much killers as survivors, just hypothetically.  
---
And let's even say that there are as much toxic killers as there are toxic survivors (Even though I would disagree here too and say there are more toxic survivors).  
---
This would mean that if 1 out of 8 killers/survivors is a toxic shithead, you would encounter 1 toxic guy that is trying to ruin your game every second match as killer facing survivors.  
---
While as survivor you would face 7 nice killers until you face 1 toxic killer.
---
&gt; Point is, killers can be toxic too. 
---
Of course. Everyone can be toxic. A killer can insult you same as a survivor could in the post game chat.
---
But usually the toxicity starts within the game. And within the game survivors have a stronger toxic toolkit than killers.  
---
If you go out of your way to t-bag/flashlight flicker after every pallet you aren't losing much.  
---
But if you decide to moonwalk and nod over every downed survivor and hit them 2-3 more times while they are on the hook, you basically lost the time duo to 3 guys doing gens.
---
Decisive strike isn‚Äôt wiggling out of the killers grasp though???
---
So like fast vaulting a window or fast entering/exiting a locker to reveal a survivor's location to the killer? Already we have shit like that in game and will always be, so at least give me the option to push the bastard out of my face.
---
You still don;t have many perks but from you have: Premonition for kindred, urban evasion for We'll make it.
---
My experience playing solo survivor, getting matched with the worst players imaginable. There‚Äôs no saving these poor fools.
---
I just think there should be some more anti tunneling perks in the game, just to make it where it‚Äôs still a viable tactic, but there‚Äôs something survivors can do about it. Because currently, if a killer wants one specific survivor dead, they‚Äôre chances of survival are extremely low.
---
Hey devs I'm so sorry ~~but I'm really not~~
---
Basically talking to a broken record player
---
BHVR needs to figure out a punishment for that.
---
Like a 30 minute ban, you lose all your bloodpoints and a dunce cap appears on all your characters til you finish a match.
---
Oh so if the survivor/s are being pricks not playing the game properly u can just do that.
---
No, he lost to his poor decision not to keep an eye on the guy who was on his first hook. 
---
With all his teammates dead, there is basically a 100% chance he would try to unhook himself.
---
This killer ignored that chance and paid the price.
---
RNG is not the factor here.
---
I got the spirit with shards so no she‚Äôs not pay to win
---
You know its BS that Legion is weaker than Bubba?
---
Also you dont need to have an F Tier, buddy
---
He's still right though.  
---
Seen lots of this on this reddit.
---
I believe so. Decisive is coded as "succeed a skill check to automatically fill the wiggle bar," but they may have changed it when they reworked it.
---
I love how the other killers have normal eyes or some sort of glow/reflection on them, but Clown's are just pure black normally.
---
In my experience and also most responses here show the issue is as follows:  
---
Most killers patrol the hooks and if they dont see a survivor in particular that unhooks they automatically assume this survivor isnt doing much when in reality he is the one looking for the hex totem and the only one doing gens where everyone else is sneaking near the hook and waiting for a window to unhook.
---
Also most survivors are very small minded. Whenever they get hooked they see someone in a locker and start assuming this guy is not doing anything when in reality those just know how to counter BBQ and were just doing a gen or hex totem.  
---
Just because there are many greedy farm-boys out there that will unhook no matter the situation doesnt mean there isnt people out there that play more sneaky and smart.  
---
For instance I won A LOT of games with an easy 4k just because one idiot was running, while being chased by me, right towards the hook and got downed right in the proximity there. Like he wasnt even going to unhook or something he was just too stupid to not run somewhere else and give the guy on the hook a chance to be unhooked.
---
How bad of a killer are you?
---
More than likely those are new players or people who haven't quite gotten used to the game and you're over here running near-meta builds against them.
---
This is one of the reasons people call this community toxic. Chances are you ruined the game for someone and they'll never play again.
---
But hey, good for you.
---
Played killer yesterday and the day before and gave the last dude the hatch, for both games. Played Survivor yesterday and the Spirit was kind enough to drag my ass out of the locker and drop me on the hatch.
---
These are the kind people I live for.
---
U should go pro man, every game 4k with freddy no ruin or anti gen perks, u truly are better than tru3 I cant believe ive never heard of the wise amazing panda from reddit
---
I guess so. I have 8/10 currently and I know I havent wiggled out at all
---
Holy fuck yeah-
---
That scene was great-
---
I did get a message after saying "that luck omg"
---
I think it's map based. They are opposites, but Spirit has more viable maps than Billy. Lery's with Billy? Might as well quit. Lery's with Spirit? Pretty good. Corn maps are good for Billy but can be a hassle for Spirit, while maps like The Game or Badham are death sentences for Billy, they are great for Spirit. But definitely neck and neck on strength, imo.
---
I always the original looked too bland but you are right about it being special though.
---
and you can force your bloodwarden
---
When all the gens are done, ALL players lose gen pressure.
---
Yeah, it's a small detail that goes to show the thoughtfulness put into some of the character designs.
---
I think Coldwind Farm maps except Rotten Fields even aren't that good for Billy, because you can loop him pretty hard on these maps and they even aren't as open as Rotten Fields ( which is probably the best map for Billy ).

If you can get through it the saw series is really fun to watch just cause of how much weird conspiracy ass shot happens throughout it. And saws 1-4 are genuinely really good movies
---
Im still pretty new as well, what does ranking up do for me though?
---
Can't wait to loose all my blood points due to poor connection
---
This is inaccurate, we can see Claudette in this one
---
Yeah, I think the only problematic Coldwind map is the Slaughterhouse one. Thompson house is fairly open, and Torment Creek has a lot of clear lines for map traversal. Rotten Fields is god though.
---
&gt;it's toxic to try and win
---
Please go outside and step in front of a bus.
---
Cheers mate
---
The tassels are literally tin foil.
---
I love this.
---
Sabojake builds eat hooks
---
Of course! Survivors don‚Äôt have the market cornered on being whiners. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had killer‚Äôs complain to me yet though, even though I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre out there.
---
Billy‚Äôs with ruin: immediately chainsaw it to the other side of the map where there is no generator, have a look around the area then sheepishly leave 
---
Billy‚Äôs with ruin when their totem is cleansed after giving away its location to survivors: üòÆ
---
Outplayed
---
I said Whoever DC's in the PTB, Your Mom's a Ho!
---
No because Nurse is stronger, but yes Spirit is really stupid.
---
And noed :))
---
You were no better tbf.
---
No
---
Same here buddy. Just reached rank 5. Got no clue how the hell i'm gonna get to rank 4 and be content with reaching red ranks.
---
Tbh all you have to do is go on the official discord, there‚Äôs a lot of anti-survivor circle jerking on there at times.,
---
&gt;corn maps are good for Billy
---
Nah, only Rotten Fields is decent, besides that only Nurse is good in any Coldwind map, Billy's best maps are autohaven and macmillan by far.
---
Spirit doesn't have bad maps though.
---
just the thought of red ranks scare me. I‚Äôm kind of relieved the rank reset happened today
---
Fucking 9volt and Big Chungus beat the shit out of this poor Freedy! I calling the Wario police.
---
&gt; (the Dwight one, I can‚Äôt remember)  
---
"Prove Thyself", right?
---
wait. it did???
---
Just use a fiddler and cheat yourself a million shards. FYI a million shards isn't even enough to get all current cosmetics let alone the fucking shrine perks. Keep in mind though they're gonna ban soon enough for those cheats, so unless you hate DbD like I do and want your final ban, don't do it. Also in case you're curious it would take more than 5000 hours of playtime to get 1 million shards. That's how much "content" they've released within a year. I am not evening counting AC-only cosmetics or buying characters, those add up to 500+ bucks.
---
Also gotta love the mods who shadow-ban all the time, eh?
---
This seriously happens all the time as killer and you know they are mad when they add you to a message. 
---
Couple days ago i was being a killer i completely suck with (freddy), i killed everyone and there was this complete noob who i kept finding and i felt bad for him and id pretend like i lost him and when it was him last alive on his last hook i let him escape and then i got a message from one of the survivors i killed saying that i had no right to pick and choose who escapes and that im an asshole. 
---
Excuse me for trying to let a noob have fun jesus.
---
yeah i‚Äôm pretty sure you get knocked down 8 or so ranks
---
FUCK. I was so happy to be rank 5 too. :(

Good to hear that they weren't salty!

you‚Äôll get back there &amp; then some. i believe in you

it‚Äôs jeff not jane smh
---
there's no reason to assume that dedicated servers change anything about this issue
---
Thank you. There's only one thing to do now.
---
Get Adept Myers (and possibly Adept Pig) achievements.
---
It's natural to pity the weak
---
gotta do it while you‚Äôre facing the noobs lol
---
Aside from bragging rights, it will impact who you‚Äôre matched up with. The more you rank up, the better the survivors/killer you play against will be, making the game more strategic/competitive. Note that you can de-rank as well if you have a not-so-great game.
---
Spirit doesn't have true counterplay because it can all be made up for by just becoming better at Spirit, whilst with Billy you can actually play around his chainsaw and make it impossible for him to be able to use it in chase.
---
All of Spirit's "counters" are just ways to make it slightly harder for her.
---
So basically: Billy is basically a Wraith with windstorm, if not even worse because of his turning restriction vs survs who know how to play around the chainsaw.
---
Well actually yes most of the times these problems are caused by connection and load on the host. With dedicated servers, so better connection and lighter load on the client, performance should be improved
---
Honestly, yea. i somehow managed to pull off the 4 Tombstone kills when i was fucking around as P2 Myers, so now i might as well go for the other one to be a true Myers main.
---
Wrong, actually most double window building are still infinites. Red ranks surv knows that, they don‚Äôt even try to loop at classic loops, because red ranks killer are too good at mindgames there. They just go immediately for the infinite.
---
the hag is a perv and was waiting to watch you use that bathroom
---
SWF P3 Claudettes/Megs tbagging at every pallet:  *Allowed, I dont see a problem*
---
Killer finally catches one of them and tbaggs with satisfaction: oMg So tOxIc FuCkInG kIlLeR BaBy rEpOrT fUcKiNg CaMpEr
---
And is messaging me saying "gg ez" called him trash, "says the one who only did one gen and got killed". Literally couldnt move the entire game. I'd rather be facecamped, atleast I didnt waste a ton of time.at that point.
---
some ppl may not realize the greatness of nurse vision perk
---
i wish i could be bothered by that
---
*Gasp* My Brother!
---
Because of his bald assertion that killer‚Äôs are generally the toxic ones, which might lead you to believe that he is in fact one of the obnoxious survivors described in my meme who would claim that the killer is being unfair if they don‚Äôt follow some stupid unwritten rules. Either that or people are just disagreeing with him (myself included) when he says killers are toxic more often.
---
How rude
---
Full Hex is very good : Ruin, Devour Hope, TotH, Haunted Grounds.
---
Also, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, BBQ&amp;Chili, Make Your Choice is extremely strong (the idea is to hook one person, then when he is unhooked, go for the rescuer, hook him, and find the rescued very fast thanks to sloppy and Nurse‚Äôs
---
Yeah it's called using crutches and it's pretty easy to make fun of noobkillers who rely on them and then wanna talk shit, I know a hard pill to swallow for most boosted killermains on this sub, nonetheless if you use ebony mori you're a joke.
---
wait i need iri on ALL 4 emblems? ive gotten merciless victories and have gotten 3 emblems iridescent and the 4th emblem as gold or silver.
---
I play ps4 so that may be why i get less of thos messages. But all i am trying to say is that not every survivor or killer is an asshole
---
repost, enough said
---
Erection strike
---
You got earth water air and fire min
---
Yes because the trophy popped for me after I used DS. So it counts.
---
I get similar players at every rank reset :c
---
Yea you‚Äôre right, I forgot they change it. But it‚Äôs more like 32% than 33%, because the survivors have to wiggle a bit before they reach 100%.
---
What's the source? I like the song.
---
I wanted to fix the word placement so here you [go](https://imgur.com/yz74ONj)
---
Of course, I‚Äôm not trying to say that everyone that plays this game‚Äôs toxic either. I think generally people that play this game are pretty great, and the fact that we rip on whiners so hard is proof of that. Your first comment just seemed to suggest that this post was exaggerating the fact that people do this at all and we should just keep quiet about it.
---
Ouch, that's a big ol' oof.
---
It's also funny to get reported for "Hacks" because people hid in lockers and don't realize that Feral Frenzies Killer instinct is not blocked by lockers.
---
Well there is an Add-on that adds range to the traps...
---
And the instaheal, ouch
---
There are so many perks to prevent gen rushing, survivors only have DS.
---
Not a bad move but while Pig is doing that chances are the survivor gets it off in his first if not second box anyway so why bother?
---
It‚Äôs fresh, it‚Äôs new, I love it
---
michael myers require L A S A G N A for his new extra dummy thicc cosmetic in order to make survivor feel too attracted by him so he can kill them in ultimate way thanks to his stand "di giorno bongiorno" but ended up making the entity too much pleased and proceed to get forcefully get a hole in his scrotrum so he removes his L A S A G N A vest summoning a new killer called "THICCFIELD" so everyone freaking runs but THICCFIELD's decisive's wrath stole everyone's heart and making everyone hungry so THICCFIELD turn into a fucking launchbox and feeding everyone up like the good boy it his but ending up mind control them now theres only the entity and thiccfield and his army, but the entity made thiccfield feel his almighty wrath ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora ora
---
&gt;I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm sensitive.
---
I‚Äôm going to leave this argument here because you seem unstable.
---
Idk in my experience it‚Äôs very rare they get it off on the first. But regardless I think it‚Äôd silence pig mains for a buff. It‚Äôs a good middle ground
---
Eyebrows
---
How could this happen to me...
---
yep, for a Second we thought we made the greatest escape in the DbD history xD
---
I‚Äôm unstable bc im calling you out on your bullshit? Haha okay. Make sure to take your anti psychotics before you get on the Internet shootin hateful shit around like inbred hillbilly
---
I can play with you when I get home from work if you're still interested it will take 15-20 minutes from me posting this comment.
---
Hag players are always cancer.
---
Yeah, you was that close man, you had it in the first half. Fr though, the first time that timer came on I wasn't fully aware that it was there and died mid opening the door and was like "ok" XD
---
No, because you‚Äôre harassing me
---
Maybe don't play an online game with bad internet.
---
No. Noed is already active when you have ability to open gates.
---
You‚Äôre harassing black people! Lmao!
---
Think for that scenario the timer should be cut in half but the chance to remove it gets doubled. Would add back the panic of having the trap at the end, your teammates should wait to pop the last gen so the timer doesn't fast-forward and still gives the survivor a really good chance to make it out regardless.
---
You mean the three main builds I plan on using when the Switch version comes out?
---
He burned them
---
Nurse is still 100% the best on console and there‚Äôs no counterplay to her if she‚Äôs really experienced.
---
Congrats this is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve seen so far today
---
Poor objectified Mikey boi...
---
Well, that or fake spider webs.
---
You get an achievement, but other than that just for bragging rights i guess
---
yes achievement, but can't you just download something to get all the achievements for that game? Worked in csgo I believe.
---
They details on it are amazing!
---
imagine the actor who played Quentin finds out hes in the game, excitedly buys it and opens it up to see that monstrosity
---
If you are willing to put the time into her then yes she is the best killer in the game on both sides. I also think she has a bit lower threshold on console for the reason so few people play her that a lot of console players have no practice how to counter her. They will make really basic mistakes and a mediocre nurse can have good success.
---
You probably can, but at the risk of getting vac banned
---
Killers are the most oppressed minority.
---
Dont forget that some add-ons (i'll have to take a look again and see if they're worth) can apply debuffs if someome is in the dream world
---
I have never seen so much broken English in my life from the person that posted this. The spirit is fine.
---
Spirit or Hillbilly. Though I really think Freddy could give them a run for their money when his rework goes live
---
No way dwight could be a shaggy.
---
I love that metallic color in the mask!
---
I do the same, depending on if they‚Äôre toxic or not.
---
Survivor spin better with joysticks? So you think you have better control in a game with a finger than with an hand? O.o
---
I know. My point was that getting an achievement isn't really anything, imo.
---
yeah aight
---
it really should counter mories
---
If it's based on map presence why is "I have my clones tell me exactly where people are" Doctor hard while "I spend half the game setting up" Trapper is easy?
---
There was a tweet saying that Stranger Things and Bhvr are working on something together. I'm not sure if there is anything more to it like a leak or something but that's why people are talking about it
---
I'm down. I burnt out the tv in my living room so I have to buy a new one and hang it before I can play so maybe a few days. I sit in green ranks with just under 1500 hours in as a survivor main to give you an idea of how I play. If you are red ranks I dont think competitive will work, it will be so easy for you lol.
---
Bruh, as a cocky survivor main, these people are cocky survivors
---
You mean playing DbD in general
---
(Why the fuck are you commenting on a post from 3 months ago.)
---
The joke is that a Meg would sprint away whenever she heard the heart beat giving me a perfect line of scratches to follow. She then called me a wall hacker for knowing where she ran.
---
Doctor is also up there with most evil. He was super privileged and smart and he ended up going from interrogating people to brutally torturing them.
---
\*long cough, "pills" scream in the distance, bill voice, earthshater, volcanos erupts

---
Literally lol, I just played a game with a friend who hasn‚Äôt played in a long time. Got tunnelled by the killer and the other survivors were crouching in corners. now my friend won‚Äôt play at :,(
---
Yes that‚Äôs the one
---
Love him
---
Myers or hag are scary yes but i dont want jump scares I want true horror and yes power is part of the horror in the moment you have more power than the killer the horror is dead is for that reason than the last greats games of horror are alien isolation, amnesia and outlast you are a guy with little or no power who knows that if he fuck up one time he is fucking dead.
---
You are a survivor main for that reason you say that stupid things after the nerf bloodloust is usselles you dont note when its active and the doctor is one of the weakest killers
---
haven‚Äôt played it yet (i‚Äôm on ps4) but it looks fun as hell
---
new state of Mexico, or state of New Mexico?
---
Even if I‚Äôm crouching?
---
[Rank reset chart](https://i.imgur.com/C7LHXQP.jpg)
---
Yes but i dont want the killers to have more power I want the survs to reduce his power of scape in 4 minutes, the killers are fine the survs are op
---
I love this. Its cause it's so true
---
Are you fucking serious dude? What's even the point of the ability when there's a -500000% chance of them escaping? You might as well make the ability "all survivors instantly escape". It should atleast be -740217802790% chance, then it might actually be useful
---
Correct

Can confirm, a toxic David just fucked me so hard that I just disconnected. Got no time for that shit and soon wouldn't have a will to exist either if I kept at it
---
Theres also a couple more, but this is the main one I read.
---
"Hi, i'm Renata Bliss, and i'm your freestyle dance teacher"
---
Probably have all the reworks in there as well
---
Someone needs to make a png of this.
---
Console killer here, I have little interest in diving into this debate. All I will say is I don't run ruin at ranks 1-3 and no amount of skill stops those first two gens going. It relies entirely on the survivors messing up. It's a mathematics game. Finding a survivor, removing two health states and hooking, followed by approaching your next target will take at least 80 seconds. I don't often see matches where I win with 4 or 5 generators left.
---
Everyone has their own experience with the game, however if you start going into the realms of telling people about your success with Freddy you're coming across as more of a meme than an actual person.
---
Good for you for doing so well, though. Means there's hope for the rest of us I suppose.
---
Lose*
---
Wait so you‚Äôre telling me killers don‚Äôt want to get teabagged and flashlight clicked?
---
I‚Äôve been playing this game for two years now and am still amazed at how many survivors whine when you play well as killer. The only time I get ‚Äúgg‚Äù in the post chat is if I played like shit.
---
Yeah, try and get yourself to green ranks at least. You still come across campers down at those ranks but a lot less
---
"more to come"
---
Please don't bother posting every single one of them. These posts are annoying and pointless since there is literally no difference from each other on top of not even being that hard to get.
---
Not really, they were waiting to make sure the Meg got out. The meg was a little cocky
---
Thanks friend, appreciate it!
---
You mean when feng was in the exit gate and she was trying to get healed by the other two in there? 
---
Please. She didn‚Äôt know ghost face could even see her, so she probably wasn‚Äôt tbagging him. Crouching up and down around other survivors is literally a common thing. Y‚Äôall gotta chill with this tbagging stuff lol.
---
Thanks
---
Ur mom
---
wait DBD mobile is out already? What?
---
What more can I say? Take it off. You're wasting a slot. Ruin is even more useless than ever at top ranks. I'd rather waste two slots on Devour Hope and Thrill of the Hunt than waste one slot on Ruin. 
---
If you are good enough to get to rank 1 with Freddy every month then you are good enough to play without Ruin. Try and find out. 
---
And I'll repeat myself again. I also play survivor to red ranks as well and find plenty of successful killers NOT using Ruin. This is a fact. Not bullshit. Again, if you played survivor to this level you will also know it to be true.
---
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs only happened for me with spirit twice I was using bqq and nurses and the blood tracking add-on for the first accusation one and it was apparently wall hacks and also the map was the game so he was pretty much close to me all the time and I play console too witch I don‚Äôt know how to hack anyways
---
Myers t1 has a 6m terror radius, t2 is 16 mts, t3 is 32 mts
---
Wasn't she too far away for a normal attack to land?
---
True. Meg was a little toxic the other guys just tried their best to be NOT toxic and leave early
---
Never gonna happen. Just happy I got my first.
---
Yes. And Monitor and Abuse reduces terror radius by 8. I was wondering if there was a limit to how small a terror radius could be but I guess not
---
I already did try playing without ruin or pop at high ranks, you‚Äôre totally full of it.
---
And as survivor I‚Äôm surprised when they don‚Äôt have ruin and consider it an easy win.
---
Hey no problem.  I try to give people some benefit of the doubt even though, historically, most folks who "got banned for no reason" later turn out to have 60 trillion bps, 255 of every item, and legacy on every character despite having gotten the game in the last year. :p 
---
I did see another comment below where someone mentioned EAC did an update that apparently banned a whole bunch of people on accident.  Glad you got it resolved, we're honest, and can continue playing this hot mess we all love (and hate)!
---
Unnerving is really bad, id maybe throw on haunted grounds and focus on trapping my totems, if they get thrill or hg it was a waste of their time. And if you are good at protecting them you will get free hooks. The downside is that if they know what you have they will focus hard on breqking every totem then you are perkless trapper, but like i said if you trap them and focus on protecting them should be a good build. I personally I dont think there is a definitive best build for killers. Just perks that can be used to better efficiency on certain killers.
---
Going against spirit is a battle of wit. If you can't escape it usually means they are smarter
---
‚ÄúMore to come‚Äù is of course figurative. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt care about every quad-iri. I wouldn‚Äôt either. Not posting all of them. That‚Äôd be a waste of everyone‚Äôs time
---
But afaik not all killers can open.
---
haddonfield is a nightmare to be the spirit on so yes she has bad maps
---
You can also try the DBD discord server in the swf chats! Hope this helps
---
I'm 3 days away from traveling to my parents hometown and the connection there is literal trash . the lowest ping you can get is 300, it averages around 500. and i felt guilty for playing killer there. but now people know their ping before playing and that makes me feel better
---
My steam name used to be El Ray-Cyst. Would get post game salt like "Of course the racist would go ultra try-hard" despite being a Trapper main before he got his buffs last year. People will call you anything to justify their salt towards you even if it has nothing to do with how you played the game lol

i was only reading from wiki
---
i do not have sole survivor so i cant confirm
---
You‚Äôre joking right? Most people use ebony Moris for fun, you‚Äôre taking this game so seriously if you don‚Äôt like it, get good or quit, and don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs not that easy because it really is
---
I got told "I'm happy we nuked you after Pearl Harbor you fucking ching chong" once when I played spirit. I have a Jap gamer tag my friend made for me (it's my name) I wasn't really sure how to respond.
---
I adjusted the mask to my friend's face so it probably became oval but it doesn't matter anymore.
---
Thanks for the compliment regarding the Susie mask.
---
Yeah, looks like OP just clicked their mouse instead of holding it on the first one, so they did a short lunge instead of a long lunge.
---
New Players should honestly just shut the fuck up until they have their first 50 hours of playtime.
---
Don‚Äôt argue when you don‚Äôt know the game lol
---
no i say doctor is A tier
---
...Why?
---
I‚Äôll have to wait for shrine to have it.
---
Well I usually set traps and darken them, if possible,  so they can protect my totems.
---
And depending on the items, the traps can either give me bonus points or down the survivor.
---
I've been getting a lot of survivors who try and rat me out to the killer if I'm in a locker. Even if it's for 4 seconds to avoid the BBQ proc.
---
You actually fucked up by downing David, luckily for you, the EGC timer is bugged.
---
Meg must be Daphne because of her red hair.
---
But if we're going personality wise, Kate or Jane should be Daphne, Claudette should be Velma, Dwight Fred (due to being the team leader now) and idk who'd be Shaggy. Most guy characters in this game are the lone wolf who can and will fight you 24/7 type.
---
because its one of the many things that never got explained anywhere. i just learned from your comment
---
It's such an issue. Last night a killer disconnected on me after their devour hope got cleansed. So naturally because it's like 2 minutes in I depip. Makes perfect sense.
---
The extra 3% is because it's the 3 year anniversary
---
And I love it just the same :)
---
3 year anniversary.
---
Wait the game is already out for 3 years?! That went by fast!
---
I can‚Äôt really think of any more tiers to put in I think in some ways all the killers can be scary some less than others.
---
i think its a mix of different things. you can be good at a non-top tier killer but still get bullied. i think the main problem is lack of presence. the reason why Spirit, Nurse and Billy are top tier is because they get around the map quickly, thus creating presence. so even though you might be really good at non-top tier killers, you still have a lack of presence, which forces people to use Ruin but in high ranks, everyone can work through Ruin anyway
---
Did you really camp though? I know it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù strategy, but did you?
---
Whoops, transcription error! I never said it was hard.
---
Also, the whole point of my comment was that "don't be an asshole" isn't universal. Some people will call you an asshole for downing them more than once, ever. Others will call you an asshole for keeping line of sight on them. More will call you an asshole for playing Killer.
---
I'd sure like to be allowed to grab an item and leave each game, but that's not how the game works. Not that the game works much at all, because this behaviour you object to is so easy to do people keep doing it without thinking.
---
And here I was hoping my terror radius would turn in to a radius of joy.
---
The ranks reset?
---
I'm pretty sure the reason the end-game RBT timers are no longer activated is because it was almost impossible to escape with an RBT on your head at that point. The Pig would be prowling the Jigsaw boxes and/or the hatch, and there'd be pretty much nothing the survivor could do except die.
---
Hmmm, then I have no idea. Did someone send you a message and  you used profanity? That's an automatic ban.Which is why I have my messages set to "friends only"
---
I also think its a pretty stupid process that should be removed.
---
Do you see chess.com "reseting the elo of everyone" every months? no.
---
I think so, but with a key it seems less noticeable that she changes her animation.

 What the F why do red ranks reset so far back.. I just grinned for 5 hours yesterday and Ik that‚Äôs my fault doing it a day before rank reset, but I got to rank 4 for the first time and I never imagined the reset would go so far back..
---
Yup, it came out in June 2016
---
i was playing Freddy yesterday and wanted to let the last living survivor out, but the EGC had already started.... and he was in dream state whilst opening the gate. at first he tried to heal himself to break out of it, but he realized it would be a better idea to open the gate and hope he had enough time. in the end, he only managed to get out in time because he had Dead Hard. shit was scary
---
Its subjective but i think i'd be a lot more scared of Billy the Hag.
---
The only thing rank 1 gets you is fighting extremely good killers. If you want to stress with long games every match because the killer‚Äôs know how to effectively put pressure on survivors and slow the game dramatically, then go ahead to rank 1.
---
How would they even ban for that on console ? Console doesn‚Äôt have end game chat, and the private messaging service is handled by Microsoft, sounds like a mistake.
---
As someone who plays both sides, i get way more salt from survivors than i do from killers. Generally salty Killers just... insta quit the chat lol
---
If you curse someone out in an Xbox message and they report you you‚Äôre banned. Tried and tested by me with an alt account.
---
I can‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt have him, the Jason I‚Äôm Freddy Vs Jason is owned by someone else.
---
This cosmetic reminds me of dishonored, looks cool
---
I don't need to 'make myself look good' on a Reddit sub twat. I'm an old fucking man.
---
Someone said Ruin was essential to win as a killer and I identified that this was not true at all. All the rest has extended from that. If you can't handle the simple facts and truths that I have identified, that's your problem 'pal'. All you have done is jump on in defence of the 'Crybaby Killer Main Lobby' in this sub to down vote and call me a liar and bullshitter in every one of your posts, because I said red rank killers do not have to use Ruin, and I am an example of a red rank killer who does not use Ruin.
---
You are a complete and utter cunt.
---
Yeah. It was so boring just standing and stalking when you could‚Äôve hit them countless times. And you have to risk salty survivors dc‚Äôing.
---
Interesting. I honestly have never heard that she was considered top tier. Thanks for the info.
---
Literally every killer can open the gates. It can only be done when all gens are finished though.
---
Additionally, the hatch shows up when there is one survivor left, killer can't grab you when you jump in anymore, but the killer can close it up. A key will still open the hatch even if killer closes it.
---
I would say legion is pretty terrifying if idk about you about a gang of people wearing creepy masks with knives running at you is pretty scary
---
I didn‚Äôt even see the title, to busy looking at the post.
---
Give him a rework so he‚Äôs less frustrated.
---
No, but in all seriousness you want to put more emphasis on the eyes and brows to have more sharpness to them if you want to truly make him angry.

Yea, i'm on Xbox and oh boy the mind games you can pull seems like it's gonna be a lot of fun. Hope BHVR doesn't nerf it.
---
As rank 1 killer. Camping for a game item is a dick move. Flashlights aren't strong if you don't pick up like an idiot either look to see if a surv around or look at a wall. Camping only hurts your own bp and emblems
---
Yes. Killers somehow search for a lobby to make which is... Strange.
---
Owo much sp√∂√∂k
---
Well that doesn't explain much though.  
---
I would consider him mid tier, and people disagree with me.  
---
All those killer main streamers with thousands of hours consider him even low tier.
---
yea its win but less bp's xD
---
Don‚Äôt forget Speedo Dwight
---
&gt;My 7 YO can help you suck.
---
That's a really bad statement, no matter how you look at it.
---
I agree with this post.
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs such obvious elitist crap.
---
Never even mentioned what to run over Ruin, only that he‚Äôs too good for it.
---
Cry me a river if that person is so bad that they can't loop you then so be it.
---
No, everyone has to die
---
I got the adept trophy same way with 1 dc after I hooked twice
---
Make this a dbd copypasta.
---
No, a real killer just kills the first person they catch, leaving no opportunity for rescue. They are *killers*, not *hoarders*.
---
How is that possible? How wouzld behaviour have access to my xbox messages?
---
i do this with like one other person but its still pretty fun
---
Well technically it can be both. Your job is to make the killer waste his time by looping him as long as possible. While your teammates rush gens. If any of you don't do those then you die and can't escape. It's part of the game man get used to it.
---
Okay, thank you for the answer! The spirit seems interesting, maybe I'll buy her and ghostface. Maybe Even Plague too!
---
its a tiny faced huntress xD
---
There's no way skill checks are dependent on a round trip to the host, otherwise it would be impossible to hit greats on laggy games etc.  They're also obviously locally rendered.
---
That's good, killers should be a threat other than "slightly faster than survivors"
---
Literally all my P3 Claudette friend says when it‚Äôs Ghost Face now is ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way he could‚Äôve seen me‚Äù kinda gets annoying after awhile, because he doesn‚Äôt understand aura perks/Ghost Faces ability.
---

---
r/imsorrymichaeljonstar
---
gg
---
ez baby killer
---
When the play icon has the spider legs around it?  That means the player is the obsession. It does different things for that survivor and the killer depending on their perks.
---
that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm afraid of
---
It means, that whoever got those ‚Äúclaws‚Äù around them, are the killers obsession
---
It‚Äôs a communication ban by the online service you use, not BHVR. In game reports of toxic communication likely don‚Äôt have any impact but Xbox Live or PSN reports do.
---
Fuck you asshole, I bet you don't get shit like this when your playing swf at rank 5.
---
They‚Äôre not bad but a sweaty team can be super toxic and annoying with them, ultimately they just waste time and that‚Äôs what they were doing

True but I think the guy that wrote the first film claims ALL the Jason‚Äôs :/ I‚Äôd love for it to happen though! Then we would have the majority of the iconic 80s/90s killers! I would also love if they got Norman Bates into the game lmao and have the motel and house as a map!

True but he would immediately come to get me so the killer had time to come back quickly.
---
I need this template
---
Everyone is in the same boat. You'll still technically be playing against red rank players, the colour and number are just different.
---
Thank God for haunted ground. Cunts wanna get my ruin go for it
---
Literally a few minutes ago I got a kid screaming at me for tunnel camping cause really they were performing one big distraction so all I did was just counter it with tunnel camping
---
That was the kid who DC‚Äôd

Leave my girl Jane alone ;-;

At least they were nice about it
---
I‚Äôll take the other gate.
---
Now that weapon is worth 400 cells. Wow.
---
I don‚Äôt think so.
---
Yup!
---
And the Doc‚Äôs daily would be 40,000 BP while the survivor‚Äôs is 10,000 lol
---
Lol ahhhhhh one of those players.  After all them sweet sweet 12K Bloodpoint 4K depip games I see lol.   Learn how to apply map pressure and chase and you too can join the rest of us and actually play the game.  I promise you it's a fun game if you're willing to learn it.
---
Good on most killers  
---
Worst possible option on Freddy/Clown
---
Haha, guilty as charged. Kinda. I bought the denim jacket for Julie and use the bloody knife so, now I just have her mask.
---
Also, a small error but Susie‚Äôs purple hoodie doesn‚Äôt have pink hair.
---
I played lf and hid in the basement with insidious all game did nothing acted like I was afk. Then one player came down after the exit gates were open to get an item from the box was scared to death to do it but as soon as he did I cut him down. In chat he said he fucking knew he shouldn't have been so greedy.
---
*slams hand on the table* NOT on my watch! NOT ON MY WATCH
---
Corvo Atanno? Why are you here?
---
Then you get looped forever cause he's a shit killer and they t bag you and flashlight spam you.
---
Everyone except Legion,Ghostface and maybe Pig would be terrifying AF.
---
too many killers with knifes already they won't do it
---
hang yourself downvoting fags
---
That‚Äôs a she my good sir...
---
duh because friday the 13th are in serious shit
---
Sounds like the last person was just waiting for hatch then which is kinda lame.
---
Yeah I assume he didnt get enough love at home so im trying to level with him to make him feel good
---
you know what really lowers your chances of getting the trophy?dcing cuz a gen pops too fast. dumb noob
---
It does exist and all these crying baby survivors are getting mad when you run certain perks and play certain killers
---
Did you down any survivors? Put traps on them or hook them?
---
Wish my boi ghostface had a  survivor
---
I love Hope at it's top tier. Speed increase for 120 seconds? Hell yeah. Great for getting my butt outta the trial.
---
Don‚Äôt know why it didn‚Äôt unlock then
---
Man , when u go pro dont forget us
---
In 30 seconds at the start of the match? As pig?
---
Gf is the king üëë of horror
---
What is there to explain? 
---
I have not used/'mained' Ruin on any killer since the very first few months I started playing this game, apart from The Hag whose perks are adept +1. 
---
I've held the opinion for a long long time that Ruin is not that good of a perk hence I have never made a point of equipping it. 
---
As a survivor, unless I am playing with a complete bunch of fuckwits, Ruin has rarely been an issue. Either I (and most decent survivors) can work through it because hitting great skill checks is not a great challenge to us, or alternatively we can clear out all 5 totems including Hex:Ruin in the first 3-5 minutes of a match. As a killer I found the above to be true.
---
You and some other responders/down-voters don't seem to be able to handle this simple reality for some reason. That is not my problem. 
---
I played this game for months as killer without any real interest in the perks I was using. I got to rank 1 this way month after month and played at that level with various killers successfully, all without Ruin. 
---
I never said I don't use slowdown perks. I said I don't use Ruin, nor PGTW. I did say I played successfully to and in red ranks with Freddy without slowdown perks which is true.
---
‚ÄúGame Over!‚Äù
---
So your telling me a invisible 7 foot tall monster wouldn't terrify you ?
---
Imagine disconnecting because one gen gets completed üòç
---
Letting them escape the trial? no who cares kill them if you can.
---
But there is some benefit to letting a survivor who is injured or just got hit with Borrowed Time escape, if the survivor isn't actively on a gen, then they are not being useful to the teams progress to winning, stalling them to heal or go for unhooks on each other is helpful to the killer for game slowdown with the killer himself wasting time babysitting a hook or constantly chasing said only injured survivor.
---
There's a difference between not letting the survivor who just got to the strongest loop in the map with Dead Hard or Balanced Landing escape, and breaking the chase to go for someone more vulnerable. Finally downing the survivor after 5+ minutes and 4 gens are complete isn't a win to the killer.
---
I'm not talking about the fake rules that literally no normal person cares if you follow or not, but the killers focus should never be JUST the first survivor they find, they have 3 other survivors, gens, and if applicable their hex totems to keep in mind when playing the game. So many times have I seen killers see 3 people on a gen and just instantly chase the 1 running for the loop, ignoring the other 2 on a gen that's about to finish in 15 seconds only to get looped by the only 1 who started preemptively running away or other similar scenarios.
---
Daddy Strike
---
Love how wraith is just standing there
---
Ofc i was gonna dc cuz think about it, one gen done in 30 seconds, no ruin, aside from surveillance no gen protecting perks. It's pretty much a loss. And I think they knew I was gonna dc cuz one of them literally ran through me.
---
That would be a shame, the bloodweb makes it harder to get items and perks, it is a much more interesting mechanic.
---
If you go for the closest hook, they generally will need at least to take 2 hits to stop you, which is actually worth it.
---
Platform: Xbox One 
---
I think the perk Alert is broken because it doesn‚Äôt do the bing sound effect when a killer kicks something so half the time I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs working
---
If it‚Äôs a survive with friends or the exit gate is open, yea it‚Äôs kinda normal.
---
Your best bet is to pretend you‚Äôre picking up the body, then turn around and see if anybody‚Äôs there. There are also perks to help prevent body blocking(see Mad Grit) if you‚Äôre running into it a lot.
---
If you‚Äôre close to the hook you can also just drop the body and chase/scare off somebody
---
It‚Äôs possible if the survivors are incredibly bad. 
---
Sounds like he didn‚Äôt even find anybody before the first gen popped.
---
Yea , if you patrol 
---
 around the basement building it is camping ....
---
Do you play killer AND survivor?
---
Gen rushing doesnt exist the same way camping and tunneling is allowed. If a gen gets done fast, it's called the survivors playing correctly. So what, it takes two games to get the adept. Dont ruin the survivors game just because they knew what they were doing. 
---
Adepts arent supposed to be easy, and they're supposed to take a few tries(Though it doesnt always take a few tries, especially on your main). If you DC just because the survivors played the game, then you didnt deserve the Adept that game anyways
---
I feel like people aren't getting his point in the comments here. His point isn't even so much that Doc or other lower-tier killers get bullied and then complain about higher-tier picks. It's that people *playing* these lower-tier killers in an attempt to search for some viable build/strategy get discouraged from playing as them when people fuck around like toxic epileptic fireflies. People are going to keep playing what they know works because they have 0 reason to even bother experimenting with worse killers when it leads to a less fun game experience.
---
Susie....*r34 intensifies*
---
Thank you for understanding
---
Good meme but its the opposite haha
---
And this is whats wrong with the game. You decide to camp and it grants you 3 kills because assumingly the other 3 were too focused on trying to be toxic to do gens.
---
If I was a solo in that game I‚Äôd be salty as hell.
---
Prople complain about camping and it does suck I agree, but sometimes it wins games because survivors play like idiots.
---
As someone who is learning the game and frequently want to check the killer's perks to see if they have certain perks, e.g. BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurse's Calling, this would be very helpful. Having to choose between staying an extra five to ten minutes just to see if my prediction was correct or using that time to play a new game is really annoying.
---
I don't think I'd have ever needed Mad Grit in my last 20 games... i really don't think its a good perk.
---
Again, this wasn‚Äôt even in red ranks. This wasn‚Äôt even close to red or purple ranks. This was also on console.  I play at red ranks on console as survivor and we find games very quickly. There are a lot of people on console at all ranks. You can find a survivor match almost instantly. A few weeks ago when ghostface came out it was harder because everyone was trying to play him, but it‚Äôs been normal matchmaking for the last like two weeks. This person is just being an asshole. Also, you can still derank and play the match. You don‚Äôt have to queue in and kill yourself immediately before any gens have been touched, ruining your fellow survivors chance of getting anything done. Even besides that, this person has apparently done this enough to get from red to yellow ranks, which takes a long time. That‚Äôs a lot of games wasted for someone who ‚Äújust wants to play the game.‚Äù
---
Honestly. Oh look, the adept wasnt handed to you? Guess it's time to DC, ruin the game, and waste the survivors offerings and the brand new part
---
I.... I don‚Äôt know
---
*yoinked off the bridge *
---
Genrushing = survivors focus only on gens ignoring any other kind of actions.
---
just because all 4 survivors spawned together near a gen without Ruin and they had toolboxes, that doesn't mean they genrushed you since they had no other reason to do something else beside a gen
---
Shh, don‚Äôt you know everything survivors do is considered cocky or better yet toxic!
---
Oh I don‚Äôt either at all. But if you‚Äôre getting bodyblocked every game and it‚Äôs stopping you from making it to the hook, then it‚Äôs probably worth using.
---
I‚Äôd make the nose bridge shorter 
---
And instead of giving him eyebrows do that half circle  thing you‚Äôd put at the end of furrowed brows to show his face is in a grimace. 
---
I‚Äôd avoid putting brows on him as he burned alive and having hair on his face would be weird
---
Your drawing is very cute, btw
---
If this is real, tag it as a spoiler before the mods delete it
---
Oh nah! I just didn‚Äôt know the common practices with this game, they‚Äôre already really good when it comes to breaking ankles and what not, I just didn‚Äôt know if that was frowned in the community haha.
---
Shhhh he's talking about you in the Vid
---
Except killers literally only do it to be toxic and ‚Äúget back at all the big bad survivors who were toxic.‚Äù Even though they probably hardly ever see those same survivors.
---
I like to charge the pallet with my hatched so they a( drop the pallet and get the M1 or b( don‚Äôt drop the pallet and get the axe
---
Lol i see it now
---
Yes it‚Äôs fitting he‚Äôs going to slice off Ghostfaces balls
---
Legion it's kinda scary, like the trailer you are running with your friend and suddenly BAM a knife through your heart being pushed slowly while you watch his mask. 
---
"But why..." You die.
---
I understand that they played correctly, and I don't really blame them for it, but think about it. If a gen gets done in less than 30 seconds without ruin then I think that devs need to look into that.
---
And that was like my 5th try for the pigs adept.
---
This is my new favorite thing.
---
much facepalm over the 3P's
---
Your experiences aren‚Äôt universal, dude. It was probably someone trying to do a daily. I play nurse, and no one ever escapes. A lot of console nurses play extremely well. You CANT loop a nurse because of her blinks, so if you looped that person, you were playing against someone just doing a ritual or just trying her out. People like you don‚Äôt need to make ignorant posts when you don‚Äôt even know how the character works, and definitely not when you have hardly any experience playing this game lmao come back when you have 400 hours. Rank isn‚Äôt even a total indicator of your skill, either, and doesn‚Äôt give credence to your dumb argument at all.
---
They were as soon as they got into the exit zone.
---
Ding ding ding
---
They‚Äôre a complete brainlet lmao
---
To a lot of people on this reddit, everything survivors do is bad. For some reason anytime survivors get caught in the end by blood warden/EGC, they deserve to get BMed. Also apparently it‚Äôs not toxic for a ghostface to t-bag, because survivors have been able too for so long.  ü§î
---
No he's right. Sure the survivors who click and teabag all the time are usually the ones who derank from reds to not only get spirit billy and nurse, but thats not his point. His point is, killer gets bullied, killer doesnt like getting bullied so they play top teir killers, and then everyone loses because its really no fun to play against those only. Because of the bullying all survivors lose. Thats what hes saying.
---
I play killer and survivor regularly. I‚Äôm currently at rank 12-10 on both. Tbagging and flashlight clicking or definitely still common for me lol
---
If I find it, I close it then open the door if the survivor hasn't been a jerk.
---
He already stated flashlight were not the problem, the t bag and of course toxic behavior that we everyone sees. Was the issue, but thanks for the mini rant about the flashlights
---
I did it rank 1
---
Alert being spammed.
---
Yea good point, maybe it wasn't a genrush, but the situation was literally uncounterable.
---
You titled this thread the toxicity needs to go down.  You participated in being toxic.  Take your own advice.  Why did you respond?  Let the toxicity go down by ignoring it.
---
Show a clip of me tbagging and flashlight clicking, my memory must be really bad.
---
Nurse just scary? A floating corpse, teleporting through walls while screeching would be terrifying.
---
Tbf, SWF with OoO is about everyone's nemesis.
---
You learn where one guy is but they ALL know where you are always.
---
I was playing Billy and literally darted across the map as soon as i hooked someone. Also yes they did the lose points when near survivor thing
---
The wait only gets worse though.
---
Toxicity is not the reason for those killers to be played. 
---
Look how trapper is popular despite being underwhelming. 
---
Killers who want "revenge" play facecamping leatherface in my experience. (Or do that many times) 
---
Viable killers are gonna be popular without toxicity. 
---
His example the doctor is one of the most complained about killers. Even high ranks just hate him, he is annoying without being powerful (though there are a few nice spots where is shock is useful)
---
"Teen killer with a cool mask" is so overdone that compared to all the other killers Legion wouldn't scare me at all.
---
The optimal place to be is like rank 10. Thats all i want to get to. Rank 16 is pure hell of boring waiting and unskilled survivors that dc on first down
---
The game used to base killer pips on kill-count. now there are several categories you have to score in to pip.
---
And when it didn't go your way this time, you dced? We definitely need more entitled players in this game/s.
---
Looks like duct tape or that relieve material on construction vests.
---
Okay, I have an outlandish theory. Have you bought any Plague cosmetics, at all?
---
Who the hell knows, man
---
Gotcha. I guess to each their own? I feel both sides have the their fair share of bullshit, but I‚Äôve beaten plenty of spirits and nurses (not saying it‚Äôs easy) I‚Äôve also lost games as spirit and nurse.
---
Funny how most comments here are wrong because they can‚Äôt read.
---
It has to be a mistake, you can‚Äôt get banned for ingame chat when there is none.
---
Don‚Äôt rely too heavily on windows. If your timing isn‚Äôt absolutely perfect, both LF and Billy can chainsaw you through them (though it‚Äôs much easier to do this as Billy IMO since he‚Äôs not swinging his saw around). Use LFs wild swinging to your advantage. He‚Äôs hard to control when he does that, so if you stay near walls/trees/random junk and hug them (survivors are much smaller and can hug these way closer than killers can) you increase his chance of hitting those. Against a hillbilly, you actually want a decent amount of distance between him and you. Once he gets close to you, he can backrev, and it‚Äôs very hard to dodge him then. It‚Äôs also important to remember both of these killers loop very easily. At a loop, their ability is useless (except for breaking a pallet) and they‚Äôre just regular M1 killers who can be looped for days. Also also, hillbilly‚Äôs turn is deceiving. An experienced hillbilly can make pretty sharp turns and get you around a corner if you‚Äôre not far enough away.
---
Same
---
Love the shading, but the eye overlapping the hair is really offputting to me.
---
Nothing surprises me anymore. The past few days, I've been seeing posts about killers dcing if they see haddonfield, object of obsession, and now doing the first gen quickly.
---
Normally I dislike Shirtless Myers memes because they're beating a dead horse for me.
---
But this... does put a smile on my face.
---
He‚Äòs not banned on the online service but in the game itself which shouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
The whole time I was thinking ‚Äút bag them please t bag them‚Äù
---
Virgin strike
---
There is nothing wrong with what the killer did. He is not holding the game hostage because you‚Äôll eventually bleed out on the ground if he decides not to hook you. 
---
If it really annoys you THAT much, bring a perk to counter it like Unbreakable and stop trying to dictate how other people play.
---
It just drives me insane because they‚Äôre a professional company and they just don‚Äôt check things. I graduated college with an English major so I‚Äôm a bit more picky about that but they constantly release grammatical and punctuational errors in text in the game, in the store they have one of Jake Parks shirts labeled as ‚ÄúJake Parker,‚Äù and now this... it just looks so unprofessional and like they don‚Äôt care.
---
Object of Erection
---
If you are at rank 16 like you say you are then a 4k is at least a gold emblem and an iridescent one if you get max amount of hooks. That alone gets you 3-4 of the 10 points you need to pip. Assuming you only get 3 then you will only need 2 silver and 1 gold emblem, which should be very easy to get assuming you actually went around the map and didn't camp.
---
How in the actual fuck are you killing that many survivors per game at rank 16 and still not pipping?  You almost get a pip for loading in the game at that rank.  It sounds like you camped and/or tunneled hard.
---
Also a new player who has never played killer. 
---
Nowadays I‚Äôve started recognizing the reason for why the killer got me. ‚ÄúWhere tf did you come from???... ohhh wait he‚Äôs probably running monitor. Well that‚Äôs on me then‚Äù
---
I find playing killer more has made me a better survivor.
---
Yeah some Survs get really creative with their bullshit excuses.
---
It may, in fact, be a Gigi's Incredulous Trip reference
---
&gt; You almost get a pip for loading in the game at that rank
---
No, they "fixed" that ages ago and completely ruined the pip system for killers, making it very hard to pip. And even then at rank 5 ish i got a pip, even a double pip sometime. Now i literally cant get a pip, i always get a couple silvers, bronzes, and maybe a gold. Im playing the same as i was before. Idfk whats happening
---
I mean.. Killer queues are much longer than survivors...
---
Tunneling doesnt reduce points....
---
No problem. Thanks man!
---
I‚Äôm guessing if it is possible it has to be exact but honestly I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs damn near impossible now
---
I know that, and i used to do well. Now i cant do shit playing the same as before

Rank rewards will be introduced somewhere in the first half of 2020. Till then, just like everyone else you have about 6-10 more months of not caring about ranks.
---
It‚Äôs technically possible, but will probably never happen, you won‚Äôt do a gen before the killer find the hatch.
---
Ever tried your own medicine?  
---
No offense but you also try to dictate how I feel about a broken game design.  
---
Anyway, I corrected the original post. He was not letting someone bleed out he just injured him once and then let him escape. I saw him hitting that person more than 6 times over a time of more than 10 minutes just to find the other 4th person. That my friend is very obviously holding the game hostage.
---
I can't even play PTB Freddy without an hour wait time
---
How am I doublepipping off the same amount of kills at rank 5?  Something doesn't add up man.
---
I think that anyone that has gone through schooling has learned the importance of quality assurance and especially a big company will need to figure that out really quickly. Release a subpar product, receive less than stellar customer involvement, pikachuface.jpg.
---
I don't know who the hell this company hires to manage their projects but they need to be fired.
---
The only reason i dc'd was that I was doing an adept. How am I gonna get a double pip and a 4k when the 1st gen gets done this fast?
---
That's thanks to the way the devs designed the game. If you can't be literally everywhere at once (or have a global slowdown perk) you're going to lose.
---
Same. If the last person alive is only alive because they used an insta, they're not getting the hatch. I'll forgive flashlights and clicking, because I'm not entirely sure how that's toxic. Instas are nasty though, and one of the reasons I love my killer.
---
r/wooosh is when a joke so obvious isn't understanded by someone else. Mr Otz, played with no perks/add ons, and so, to be sarcastic, I commented what I commented. Obviously there's no need to explain a build that doesn't contain anything. He didn't get the joke, so, it "is" an r/wooosh, depending on how you look at it.
---
Yep. Kill survivors is now a bannable offense. So is running perks and moving, so be sure you dont do that

I'm not supposed to be the one who entertains the survivors who can have fun for the cost of my fun. I'd bet you'd be pissed too if the 1st gen gets done that fast

---
As a killer main I do believe that me having the choice to go 3 hooks over to hang someone without having Agitation or Iron Grasp is a bit to much. Killers should go for the closest hook they can spot and make it with let's say 2-3s. to spare if they don't bump into anything 'cause of the wiggle.

### Left For Dead

---
it always being Nurse Spirit and Billy isn't because of toxicity. That's an entirely different issue in itself, stop pretending that if the survivors weren't toxic people would magically start playing a non-camping leatherface, Wraith, Trapper, Doctor, etc. without Ruin, or SF + Enduring.
---
You said it was your 5th try.
---
Nurse doesn‚Äôt have a insta and her blinks count as m1 you get more points for m1ing then going for the insta for some reason

most people use that so thier noed doesn't get destroyed

I‚Äôll keep that in mind

Yeah, it is. But still, I see where they are coming from

**I'm a Rank 18 Survivor, Killer main**
---
Ah thanks

So half of your perks are for having and protecting noed, an endgame perk, on a killer with intrinsic *instadown?* Hdhehshahcjakq
---
They‚Äôre all pretty intimidating, I‚Äôd shit myself if I saw any of these
---
Sorry for bad wording. Yes they were all after the todays rank reset
---
Uh, getting frustrated and dcing like a pussu are 2 different things. Now this is about survivors doing the objective at the cost of your "fun"?
---
By all means keep dcing. Hopefully you'll get banned.
---
Nah, the problem is BVHR changing the requirements for an Adept from a 4K to a double pip, which is something near impossible given how gimped you are with 3 perks, some of which (like on huntress) are absolute dogshit.
---
Because of the emblem changes we can't brute force a 4K with Mori's or OP addons like Iri Heads to ease the pain. I've been trying one adept for 3 weeks now (Myers) and still haven't been able to do it so I just gave up.
---
Still doesn't excuse DCing tho.
---
I don't like playing the girls. They beat 20 times louder than Joey or Frank.
---
lol but then when people are trying to play with their friends and aren‚Äôt gods, TOXIC SWF BULLY FAIL?
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt know what we can do to make the company care. They have so many events where they basically give the game away that it‚Äôs not like we can do something to force them to change their practices.

I was playing for fun, i mixed some perks to try something different
---
Dying Light is trash tier.

I'm going to assume you camped your obsession. It's a valid tactic I guess, but don't be surprised when you get salt.
---
What‚Äôs an endgame build without bloodwarden and remember me?
---
I admit even though i dont like tru3 for reasons and opinions of my own he is not wrong. That being said i dont consider myself toxic or "not self aware" for massively disliking facing against billy. Everytime i just wanna bleed my eyes out when i hear that wreched chainsaw. Tho i play killer 95% of the time and dont know how to play survivor against billy that much.
---
And ive seen many killers complain in the endgame chat as well its not just survivors. Thinking its just the otherside is hypocritical. Both sides have bad games and both sides try to somehow push the blame on something else rather than accept their own mistakes. We have all done it and there no denying it. Its quite human and happens in any game not just dbd.
---
Survivors hate higher tier killers each for their own reasons. Doesnt take a toxic person to dislike something. Killers hate certain kind of survivors as well. Whining about it wont do anything tho because it wont end. Because as long as youre opponent is human they can and will play in their own way. It may not be the "right way" to play in your opinion but they have the freedom to choose however they play.

Idk, it was my first game since 3 months
---
I pip fine wonder whats going on here? Insodious leatherface?
---
Oh, thx for context. Getting back in is tough, I‚Äôve had to deal with it before
---
Yup don't wiggle survivors it increases the chance that our hearts will grow 3 sizes that day and give you the hatch.

Yeah, I wanted to kill my obsession first, that's why he reported me : " camping and tunneling"
---
It's the game you love to hate!
---
That discourages people are angry toxic try hard and just want to enjoy the only run from killers game out there. I‚Äôm a killer main and this is a terrible idea.
---
It's wow, it's pow, and how.
---
I've been AFK as Pig until 2 gens left then killed everyone and double pipped. Stop Disconnecting and play the match out. Once the ball starts rolling it keeps on rolling. Sometimes it starts straight away. Sometimes not until 3 gens are done.
---
It's.. Like, I know spaghetti code is a thing, but this is on a whole other level.
---
I have an idea with Rework Freddy.  Hook someone near a generator, and use Make Your Choice and a few dream snares to teleport back to the hook and therefore never be a ‚Äútoxic bb killer tunneler‚Äù
---
How would that work tho? I feel like high brightness would make the darkness a different color but not actually able to see through it
---
Pleeeeaaaase make a character portrait pack! This is awesome
---
Orson Scott Card also has a cool essay about the different types of fear in one of his short story collections.

Did you message someone through the Xbox live at all in the past week about Dead by Daylight?
---
Lol
---
Terrifying knowing you can't hide form him
---
Meh, looks more like Feng to me.
---
Should just bring a tombstone piece and tombstoned him. Then enjoy the hacking accusations as you mori them while they're standing.
---
My guess is a receding hairline, but hey, I say he should rock it!
---
The healthiest sexual advice i‚Äôve ever received and it‚Äôs from a virgin!
---
Jane was the last one alive so it opened again. You closed it right before the game registered that there was only one survivor left
---
Was that before or after this game was resurrected from the dead about a year ago? It would certainly go a long way in pleasing its loyal fan base, especially the ones who spend money as well time on the game. BE has done a decent job of listening to its player base as of late. I'd expect this request to certainly be doable. I'm a big believer in refining the product you already have instead of pushing out new content for a game that could still use a lot of work at its core.
---
Are you on ps4?

LOL

Oh apologies that was more of a knock on YouTube mb
---
The on site snipers won't be able to see those Claudettes.
---
I'm really hoping I'm wrong, but I didn't do anything differently other than change cosmetics.. So what other conclusion can I draw from that?
---
It‚Äôs another hat!
---
Best thing to do is just go in as the killer you want to play and practice. You might get smacked around, but you'll get better. I'm trying out Plague right now and she plays different from other killers I've used and I'm getting dunked on hard but I'm figuring it out and it's still fun.
---
Wraith is always standing there. He is the true stalker.
---
Never heard him assume that. He literally just said in his stream "not all survivor mains are annoyin/egotistical. Some of them are alright". She's ass to verse with rare addons yeah, but guess what, she's available for you to use too.
---
This has absolutely none of the context it requires
---
Boy I hit the wrong number on my keyboard typing to fast. Totally a noob and not a typing mistake lmfao
---
It s good for wasting survivors' time. They might think u have devour hope and they might try cleansing all the totems.
---
What are the issues with his add-ons?
---
thats why i  put Silhouette in title :P .. ill post a video render soon :P
---
Learned to love it or entity just messed with her
---
Leatherface is by far my most favorite killer and my most leveled up it's just he's so fucking garbage. There is no point in playing him when you can just play Hillbilly. Their abilities are almost identical except Billy can Sprint and apply map pressure while bubba walks around and bumps into shit and does a 30 second tantrum which usually is a chase ender as it's almost impossible to catch back up. Anybody above rank 10 knows how to play against him and he just doesn't have the ability to apply pressure like a Wraith, Billy, Spirit, or Hag
---
Oh duh lol. I really want to see the deetz bro!

I have never depiped with a 4k ever. And I cant tell you how many pips I got just camping trash survivors like you and your friends because you can't grasp the basic concept of rushing gens instead of gathering around the hooked survivor like a bunch of seagulls for a french fry. Learn to counter camping.

I don't think the game was ever dead. It was losing players due to lack of updates in the months before Year 3 started but not to the extent of Deathgarden. Regardless, wouldn't really matter because they've added so many skins since then and therefore increasing the workload if they choose to do so. They're already pumping out plenty of skins that people are clearly buying so they likely don't have the time to make a bloody variant of every single cosmetic or even half of them. Perhaps if they charged money then they would but I'd say more people would prefer to spend money on a brand new outfit than an already existing one with blood. And they are refining their product. They're about to release the Freddy and Preschool map rework, and have plans to release dedicated servers as well as other game health related fixes. Bloody variants of cosmetics would be an extremely low priority and that's something that the cosmetic team handles separately from the other teams that work on the actual game.
---
Lol the only trash is the pathetic noob that can only get a kill by staring at the hook.  I destroy campers personally I never said word one about not being able to counter your babykiller asses.  I know to genrush when others are facecamped and I play personally to make your infant lives miserable by looping you as long as humanly possible along with decisive and dead hard to make your camp attempt on me personally as painful as possible.  You must be rank 16 or some dogshit because camping at top ranks absolutely results in depips.
---
His acceleration add-ons don‚Äôt work and have been broken since release.
---
That's weird. I thought the achievements were the same across platforms. Maybe it is an achievement related to Bill, as consoles did not have him included.
---
It will be much harder now with EGC as the killer can close the hatch, which I presume voids your chances of trophy. Then if you do manage to pop the generator you have revealed your location, which was always an issue but with a 3 minute timer to get out when you have to hide from the killer first really shortens your chances.
---
The only way I usually manage to escape through the exit gate as the last survivor now with the countdown, is by waiting for the killer to check an exit, getting the first light up on it, then sprinting away to the other exit before the killer comes back and without them seeing me. Hopefully the killer spends long enough searching at the other exit he thinks I must be hiding near that I have enough time to get the second door open. I would use something to help me open gates quicker. I think it is called Wake Up.
---
As for the first part of the challenge, you'll just have to wait for that opportunity. Which will happen. 
---
Take the Pebble Perk in with you. When there's two of you left and you both working on a gen, at 75% walk away and throw your pebble back at them. Let them get chased, get it to 99% and wait for your opportunity üòÇ
---
Rank reset is seriously unhealthy for this game and the sooner it's gone the sooner everyone has a better experience.
---
It's an utterly pointless mechanic that only frustrates everyone from high rank to low rank killers or survivors - it's not fun and it's designed to artificially make you feel like the progression in this game means anything.
---
DS because usually people likes too much going for saves because free points
---
Yeah those are good points. The majority of players only play one side. So they don‚Äôt know about the difficulties that the other side faces. Which is to be expected. Many people in this game are toxic but I think that if they play a little on the other side, this behavior can be reduced some. Hard to imagine tbh, but one can dream.
---
And it does feel horrible to wreck new players. It feels worse to see toxic people deranking on purpose to do it. But I blame that on a flawed matchmaking system that allows this to happen in the first place.
---
You‚Äôre right. The idea of us vs them is pretty much unavoidable. But it still sucks nonetheless. The notion of playing this game for fun is almost nonexistent nowadays. The last few months did it for me. The game is balanced today compared to what it was before. I‚Äôve always tried playing it for fun above all else. But it has become such a chore both as survivor and as killer. It has made me lose the motivation to play it anymore honestly. It‚Äôs a shame since I love this game but it‚Äôs leaving me no choice.
---
Feng Max Levels Reached
---
She is hard to use well but she is really powerfull. She is my main killer and I am extremly consisten at winning with her. The only match that she struggles with are 2+ flashlights games, if the flashlight users are good (many times flashlight users against hag are free down thanks to some really dumb plays they often make).
---
She is not considered high tier by many people becouse a lot of killers try to play her as a mouse 1 killer or as a camping machine, giving her really bad reputation. 
---
By playing all killers I think that her and spirit are the killers that require you to think the most to play well, since going on auto-pilot is an istant defeat
---
Skillchecks are clientside so I don't imagine dedicated servers would change anything in that regard.
---
stop
---
I'll beat a horse anyday as long as it's Myers c-
---
Epic meme, but autohaven has pretty low amounts of pallets compared to most other maps, it‚Äôs just hated by killers because of the multiple strong window loops.
---
He created an Instagram account and said he was going to post a lot of gym related stuff, including shirtless pictures. Just letting you know. ü§≠
---
God pls no
---
I like going against high tier killers anyway cause every other killer is only used to abuse some unfair build they seent on YT.

Unhooking in the second stage is a very bad idea.
---
In general being able to unhook oneself is already a strong tool
---
But i do like the idea of a different type of "skill check" where you have to press certain buttons in a certain amount of time.
---
maybe it could be reworked to something like increasing the struggle time
---
We must sacrifice every survivor to protect our killers.
---
Were the people you invited to a party people you know or random people that you met through the game  you wanted to talk to about the them? I know as long as your not abusive, you wouldn't get a week ban for no reason.
---
I really don‚Äôt get to mad at t baggers and other things people see as toxic, but it‚Äôs agrovstingg seeing it a couple games straight. When that happens, then I can agree it‚Äôs a problem. Also this keeps up, This game will be just like for honor, dead because of toxicity

The Top Killers already have the highest amount of picks, and btw you kinda forgot Spirit she rewards players even more than billy.
---
You can be good with almost every Killers,yes there are good and bad killers.
---
There are enough Streamers out there that can proof that you can do well with alot of Killers
---
My example would be Truetalent, just regarding his skill, he does pretty well on most killers.
---
How is clown not high tier, he's basically a creepy uncle on meth
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you notice, but hair is extremely thin and you can still see past bangs if you have them. I think that is the representation of this eye style that her vision is not impacted by her hair. It‚Äôs an intentional technique.

Ayyy nice.
---
It's pretty bad. If you're rank 1 you go to rank 15?  Why?  Only way I see that makes sense if they want to keep it is if you're a red rank, you go to purple. If you're purple, go to green, and so on.

Well in the Case of Wraith and my 1,2k hours of experience maining him, you can play him pretty douchy and effective if you try REALLY hard. Problem is, the amount of effort to be even close as effective and consistently winning like you do with Nurse is exponentially higher. You can see it when you play against a good wraith. And sadly one of the most effective things wraith can do is camp open spaces with invisibility and intercept people passing by to delay the whole team or change the game in his favor with a perk-based instadown.
---

Has someone else posted this or something?

I Would also put doctors jumpscare illusion up there, But only the first, maybe first couple times you play against him.

0 terror outside a chase, 8 in a chase. If you bring dead rabbit and three stacks of ghostface new perk, tier 2 will have 4 meter out of chase and 0 in a chase

You, Nea Karlsson -NEA KARLSSON - was number third in the voting poll? I could not believe it. So out of all 17 survivors, how did you manage that?

Nope, Rank 1 Trapper main. Sorry buddy.

I double pipped so I‚Äôm confused why I didn‚Äôt get the trophy

I came here to report the same bug. Been happening all day. I can see people on generators and on the Jigsaw boxes!
---
Take the skillcheck away - the unhook is too fast for that to make sense.
---
Up the "unhook yourself" to 100%. Someone still did the unhook afterall.
---
You don't hear her phasing in her terror radious either.
---
Anecdotal evidence =/= Facts
---
Try doing it at red ranks, where survivors are more than happy to screw you over by jumping into lockers to avoid the mori
---
All good, dude
---
Yes but the reason you kill you efficiently more often than not is heavy tunneling which I specifically asked about.  All I'm saying is I'm much higher rank and have zero issue pipping even on less kills.  I believe their playstyle is what is hurting their pips not the system itself.
---
It‚Äôs another Jasmine quote!
---
I believe top tier spirit is dealier than top tier billy, can depend on the map tho.
---
I mean trying to run any achievement build at red ranks is suicide
---
The entire reason that basement exists is to have somewhere you can trap all four survivors at once. If they are dumb enough to keep coming near my basement, I'm gonna snatch them all up.
---
Randoms. I still dont think behaviour has access to xbox messages
---
I feel like I can outjuke Billy all day but keep getting stomped by Leatherface. Please teach me how to not lose every time I play against him. I try and get him to swing at me with the saw near objects but it feels like that doesn‚Äôt stop him and I go down half the time or more.
---
David King is definitely either Krieg or Brick.
---
good luck! &lt;3
---
Yeah agree so hard to wriggle free even with Dance with me
---
They changed the matchmaking a little bit. It‚Äôs basically the same as before, except it won‚Äôt actually create the lobby until it matches you with a survivor. ‚ÄúSearching for match‚Äù just means it hasn‚Äôt found a Survivor uet
---
Killer camping and tunneling: "he's just doing his objective to kill the survivors wow let him do his job it's not toxic"
---
Survivors trying to rescue their friends: "toxic SWF screw them, glad you tbagged them at the end"
---
It‚Äôs because they screwed with survivor sounds so much. Chase music is quite heart beat is loud in chase but quiet the rest of the time. It‚Äôs all messed up.
---
It didnt dawn on me until later, but i think someone accused me of camping the other day bc they had no idea how spirit works. I was like lmao w h e n?? Poor guy
---
Good argument, you've giving me alot to think of and kudos to the concise bullet-points. I wish more feedback was as descriptive but lets be honest your setting the bar quite high.
---
*clenches teeth, tries to resist*
---
**fails**
---
Saruman.
---
SWF should, in fact, not be nerfed. You can't be upset because you, as a killer, got a group of people who prioritize teamwork and roles. I agree that SWF are often cocky and toxic, and no one should ever t-bag or flashlight spam cuz the killer could just be having a bad day or maybe he/she is learning the ropes.
---
Since when did not using Ruin become elitist? Seriously, tell me. Direct me to these discussions. It's not just not a good perk. It's a shit perk! I thought most intelligent and seasoned players knew this. 
---
I guess you're both just a pair of clueless dicks who are not as good at the game as you like to think you are. Maybe I should go pro. I always underestimate how many sad cunts like you two would waste there lives watching me play a simple game.
---
you literally asked two questions in your response. if you're not asking a question, don't put questions marks at the end of your sentences. fun fact: question marks denote that you are asking a question

Kinda reminds me of the art style of Invader Zim but more detailed.

Why is this video toxic?
---
No no, Bikini huntress sounds fair
---
sorta sounded like "just don't mess up skill checks"
---
Nah. He was 1 of 2 who got away. The spamming stopped when the ticker was close. I automatically assume people just want to be that way. I'm far past given the benefit of the doubt with this community anymore. Sorry.
---
Thank God finally
---
Right? It's brilliant.
---
I go stretches without playing and have my rank reset to 16.  Players at that level will DC, try to wiggle and/or die on their first hook even if you‚Äôre on the other side of the map.  4king with 5 gens left with out a pip happens.
---
I personally go for max hooks and 28k+ BP and usually play ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù killer.
---
Agree with both, just need someway to stop people from trying to unhook while the killers nearby. A way to to make survivors take a second before the unhook to make sure its safe is all I'm after, tired of getting unhooked and steamrolled in 1.5 seconds.
---
I do like the debuff idea though, if it happens enough yea some people will stop unhooking people but most will make sure its safe first.
---
Worth.
---
in the event they have noed at least you got points instead of sacrificing yourself to the bubba
---
It wouldn't, because people would turn it off for better methods of communication like Discord.  I mean that would be great for solo survivors maybe, but most SWFs would still use a 3rd party app.
---
Lol this.

When I want revenge, I play nurse with no add ons and destroy them, I‚Äôm a wraith main but he‚Äôs frustrating to play because he can‚Äôt deal with good survivors, nurse and spirit can deal with good survivors which makes it fun for me because I can actually do something other than follow a survivor around a pallet 3 times then they drop it and go to another pallet and try to mind game them when the pallet doesn‚Äôt allow mind games.
---
I'm a killer main and only getting safety pip after a 4K does happen to me. Here is a few things that makes it happen:
---
* Someone DCed or suicided on hook.
---
* Even tho you 4Ked, survivors did manage to gen rush you to some extent and your lightbringer score was low.
---
* The game simply was very short because of total domination, which gave you low chase points. Happened to me with Huntress with red addon lol
---
\&gt;Bill
---
*US Air Force tremble in fear*
---
I'm not upset at all.  I'm literally just giving a solution to what Tru3 said.  We can continue the Billy, Nurse, Spirit trend in red ranks, but if they want other killers to be viable they need to do something about SWF groups against non top tier killers.
---
They should introduce placement matches or something akin to that, and have rank reset occur once every two months or something. They should also give rank based rewards, shards perhaps.
---
***EXCUSE ME*** BUT
---
Clown and Doctor having "terrible power"? *Are you fucking insane?*
---
They both are gods at making people DC in irritation after Nurse with ebony mori and Legion. 
---
Clown SLOWS people down with his power and fucks their screen up which makes for an easy hit, while Doctor can shock you to oblivion and if timed right can stop a vault/pallet drop. Oh, and yeah, Doc has excellent tracking in case you forgot.
---
While Michael, while being lame at the start, forces survivors to pay attention to their surroundings. Especially if survivors don't know that it's Michael, it's really easy to get into the game. Just saying but Michael, unlike Trapper and Hag, has a power that involves survivors directly. 
---
And btw, I think to play well on Trapper and Hag, one needs to know their pathing. How does one combine gen pressure and putting traps in loops? A good player should know it.
---
Pig and Wraith are actually decent killers if your hands don't grow out of your ass. While Pig's traps aren't particularly useful (besides forcing people to waste time on getting those traps off and killing off those who aren't favored by Lady Luck blessRNG), her dash can easily counter certain loops. While Wraith's power depends on your playstyle - are you using it to get around the map faster (windstorm addon), track injured ones since first hit is pretty much free if you have brains (hound addon) or to spook survivors like Myers with scratched mirror on Lerys does (don't remember the name of the addons)? 
---
And huntress!? *ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME*? She is one of the most strong killers in the game. Her speed, is, like, 5% less, it isn't such a big deal as you think it is, ESPECIALLY if you can aim your goddamn hatchets. Some godlike huntresses can easily snipe you from afar.
---
Not gonna say anything about Leatherface, Ghostface, Plague, Legion or Freddy because: I haven't played Ghostface and Plague, and I don't consider Leatherface, Legion really good killers. As for Freddy, I have no idea what are you exactly talking about. What invulnerability for 7 secs are you ranting about?
---
Naturally DC's and suicides regrettably will destroy your pip.  One of the things they need to change when they begin punishing disconnects.  But he just listed the amount of kills he's getting in games played in the post so I have to imagine he'd have lead with that if that's the case.  I play the same way.  Max hooks on each kill which is why I pip effortlessly.
---
**H E X**
---
I think that's what might have got you on a week ban. Random will report even if you message them one wrong thing or your on your mic saying one bad word.
---
You haven't played around 1.9.4 have you?
---
sort of reminds me of panty and stocking if im remembering the name right
---
Not like spirit is the hardest killer in the world
---
in my own opinion, worst time to get adept's done if just before reset or during the same week as reset
---
As people are more likely to use their iridescent builds and  SWF medkit and ds builds 
---
unless you run into a killer looking to de rank just before reset then your good \^\_\^
---
Just explode in a mist of blood xD
---
Dude just play the game they burnt their toolbox early you can still win... its a game 
---
Some games survivors melt me sometimes i do.
---
The first gens are harder to stop too many choices.its the last that are easier for killer
---
Hell I‚Äôm getting that at purple ranks rn. I‚Äôve stopped playing survivor this past week because of it.
---
I'm new at the damn game and all I want is 4 perk slots so I can do cool things like everybody else.
---
But you go into a match and you've got a SWF going on that runs around being a bunch of asshats to the killer, and all I want it to see the perks the killer has but I spectate and the survivor is tbagging and playing with a flashlight over a hatch for like 4 minutes because they found it already.
---
You don't have to play killer to realize survivors are waaaaaaaaay too toxic.  Just entering a game and having your team dc because it's Billy and they hate facing Billy and I'd just like to have a game where I'm not the only one in it.
---
"Well, you don‚Äôt lose pips from DCing anymore."
---
????
---
"Literally no one ever said they were purple or green."
---
Did I say that they were purple or green?
---
"There‚Äôs no reason to depip from ‚Äútoo much stress.‚Äù"
---
Oh really? High rank Survivors genrush like crazy, you can't play any other killer other than Spirit, Billy or Nurse. Ruin is also mandatory.
---
"Also, you posted this comment three times. Please don‚Äôt spam."

I once got called a stream sniper by a group of SWF because I found the last person near a door they'd started (so the light was on) after shutting the hatch and hearing them move in the grass.
---
Was fun.

Thats Not_queen. Not Jane.

Me after playing against ghost face 5 games in a row.
---
You play on ps4? üòÅ
---
I'm just gonna add here that I don't normally dc. In fact, I very very rarely dc on purpose.
---
And I've started to regret that. I mean, the first time today that I've tried to get this Pig adept, one P3  Ash ruined it today, and I was pretty pissed, cuz I calculated that I could've gotten it if he didn't DC.
---
Well, a few attempts later that game happened where the first gen got done in less than 30 seconds. I was super frustated and decided to Dc, and like I said, I regret it, because they were trying to win, and lost their items/offering, and maybe just... Play the game.. 
---
But what I haven't changed my mind with is that gens can be done way too fast unless the killer has Ruin or is putting alot of pressure (Which you can't do in the first 30 seconds of the match unless you are Nurse, Billy or Spirit) . What is not OK is that the first gen can be done in less than 30 seconds with 4 toolboxes and ONE Brand New Part before the killer even gets there. What is not OK is that Adept achievement are in control of the survivors, and not you.

We got the cosplayer, gamer, princess, and the normal girl who wonders why tf she gets paired with these people.

Sorry, no. Just the Xbox 1. üòï
---
You mispeller PTB Kate.
---
Yeah but thats obviously flawed, because your goals as survivor and killer are different, and the killer trying to kill you after you unhooked is simply them playing the game correctly, even if you wouldn't want to be treated like that, they are the killer and are not there to make the game fun for you.
---
As a Wraith main, I understand this point completely. I played three games yesterday where I got t-bagged and flashlight clicked all game. It's honestly the most disheartening stuff to deal with when you just play for fun. At red ranks I HAVE to play better killers after a few games of Wraith cause I get tired of getting destroyed and BM'ed. Thank god I'm on PS4 at the moment so I rarely get messages that make me feel even crappier.
---
I might get the headpiece and weapon from this, I like her default dress color swaps too much to change that tho.
---
You said something about quitting the game, I thought you meant a DC. 
---
You said something about purple to green gameplay being a valid reason to want to depip. Purple and green had nothing to do with this, so I‚Äôm not sure why you brought it up. 
---
This is a survivor, not a killer, and you‚Äôre bringing up points about killer gameplay. This person is playing survivor, so ‚Äúgenrush‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt cause them stress, as they‚Äôd benefit from it. This is also on console, so there‚Äôs more variety with what killers you go against, and ruin isn‚Äôt always present. 
---
Overall, your statements don‚Äôt have anything to do with the context of this post. You‚Äôre bringing up irrelevant things, as I‚Äôve already stated multiple times this is a completely different situation than any of the points you‚Äôre bringing up, yet you‚Äôre persisting.

My
---
Fucking
---
Sides
---
Spirit is pretty good but is usually pretty add on dependent, but that ain't a big deal. She can be great but she isn't Nurse or Billy of course.
---
Ghostface is actually pretty good as long as you are sneaky while using his power. Depending how good you are, he can be a better Myers due to how much faster he exposes people.
---
Plague is pretty forgettable and in my opinion is the worst of the projectile/ranged killers. She isn't bad but is very meh.
---
Legion. Personally I think they're also meh. Hard to use, but without as much reward as Spirit, Hillbilly, or any other difficult killer.
---
Actually, it is a reportable, and therefore bannable, offense.
---
Bugged how?
---
i don't think SWF is the issue, someone else pointed it out, nurse, billy, spirit, (and new freddy) have something almost every other non viable killer doesn't have. MAP PRESENCE, they move fast and get around quicker, they have mobility. this should also mean hag is top tier but her teleport is limited to where her traps are placed so she only has pressure in specific locations while, the nurse can always teleport, billy can always drift, and spirit can always do her phase shift
---
Classy
---
I know that but killing nobody still results in a loss along with the fact that killing people helps with getting pips.
---
**HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MORE?**
---
You got bodied lmao, I agree with you though, call it nurse‚Äôs calling please
---
And hat is OoO?
---
Straight tucked to bed. Geez.
---
My friend, y‚Äôknow, he‚Äôs getting close to red ranks, right? Yeah. He only does this. He puts them on a hook, and goes nowhere. He stares them dead in the face, letting them know that they‚Äôre in Bubba‚Äôs basement and they‚Äôre never getting out. He has BBQ on but he doesn‚Äôt use it. He lets gens get done because he hates it when survivors unhook. He will only allow 4 hooks max per game or else he has a tantrum. Great stuff.
---
I did not know that! Thanks
---
I mean SWFs have map presence by stating where the killer is, where they are, where hex totems are, where the hatch spawned, who is going to get the unhook and who is doing gens though.
---
Ok I did not know that the killer can't grab you anymore lol. 
---
But the hatch does not only spawn when the last survivor lives. This is a urban legend. The hatch spawns whenever it wants but it can be found when more then one is alive (it is closed then obviously)
---
I never read the names of players in the lobby because I tab out and also not many killers believe you or care about it. It's easier to do it if you don't say anything
---
This is nice, very nice.
---
vrOOm
---
See? No one expects to have those 2 perks in your build.:))))
---
You can message on steam but they have to add you first
---
In PTB there isn‚Äôt enough players to have a proper matchmaking system
---
This is great!
---
Where do you even read did fanfiction? Most of the stuff I found up until now was Trapper or Myers x reader porn
---
Well I mean it‚Äôs his third game
---
This perk may take a lot of time, maybe, if we increase the amount of series and reduce the response time to 1.0 second (for the three button serie) can make it more difficult to use.
---
Don't forget: if you fail only one button you will be sacrifice.
---
I can't really help you with how to play Doctor, cos I don't have him. But as a survivor and as to how to counter killers, it helps to know their kit. With Nurse, she starts with 2 blinks, there is a small window in order to do the second one(else she'll go into the cooldown stun). It helps to change direction because she can't cancel her blink (unless she is on the lowest level and blinks at the ground). If she attempts a swing after her blink, she'll have a longer stun than if she just ends her blink. Her stun makes the screen dark around the edges and she looks at her feet. In a chase, stunning her with a pallett will be difficult to do, so don't try palletts. Use her stun to gain distance. And when she's blinking watch her to see where she's heading, and then go the opposit way. The chain blink covers a shorter distance than the primary blink, so changing direction makes it harder to hit you

Was that really necessary tho?

Yeah noed working who would of thought ?

looks like shit

Yes
---
Nope, my reading comprehension that early in my mornings is shiiiiiu. Sorry.
---
SwF iS oP. PlZ nErF
---
Haha you get an upvote from me.
---
Run around objects really, really closely, he'll have to keep more distance to the object, so takes longer to get around it and if he wants to hit you he'll risk bumping into it and tantruming, thus giving you the chance to create distance. Also just try to get to cluttered areas while he's revving, he'll either end up stopping the chainsaw or going into tantrum when he misses you.
---
At least that's what works against me when I play him, though I'm still relatively new to him compared to Hillbilly, Hag and Myers, hope it helps :)
---
Combi with deliverance and decisive. Would be horrid.
---
When a survivor is downed or on the hook, the timer slows down x2 (the bar turns grey) but after the last patch this doesn't always occur (but is should) and as you can see, that's what happened when he downed David and put him on the hook. If it worked properly, the bloodwarden would've ended before the timer ended, allowing others to escape. So in normal circumstances the correct play is not to down anyone.
---
My first ever killer game was with Doctor, and I got nothing but a pallet-headache, some teabags, and a friend screaming in my ear how dumb I am because I kept losing survivors. Second game was with Wraith, and I did get one sacrifice, then a bunch of teabags and more screaming at the exit gate. Same thing happens when I try to play survivor; I die early because I don‚Äôt know how to loop or hide and have my eardrums blown out.
---
I have already given up playing DBD. Can‚Äôt have fun if no one lets you.
---
This is so fucking mood. Even playing as a survivor it annoys me when I see people acting like that in-chat.
---
I've had something like that happen to me with a survivor (feng). I had her level 50 and when I went to buy Kate, I couldn't select feng anymore cos it said I didn't own her. But it still said she was level 50. I just restarted my game and it went back to normal. I think it's just an occassional glitch

---
Also they could just have good game sense, if you miss skills checks or perform rushed actions the killer geta a notification. One strat killers do sometimes is patrol the remaining gens to find survivors.
---
Good tips thx. I think Wraith could be hard to play as a beginner though, since you can¬¥t attack while cloaked. You need to uncloak yourself by ringing your bell which gives away your position and gives them a chance to run away. The Wraith has to ring it for like 4-5 seconds i think.
---
wdym? Tru3 play every killer in rotation, with random perks or even perkless at red ranks and wins most of the times, if there are solid players he is one of them
---
Billy‚Äôs pretty easy to turn into an M1 killer. Just loop around pallets and don‚Äôt throw them down. Make him hit you, make his power useless.
---
*Confused huntress main noises*
---
Also have had killers get stuck in pallets during a pallet stun causing them to not move for the rest of the game
---
**"excitedly sits on top of them"**
---
Object of Obsession, allows a survivor to become the obsession so they can see the aura of the killer at all times and the killer can see the aura of the survivor when the survivor is looking at the killer.
---
ok
---
you have to have completed one more gen than people alive for it to spawn :)
---
I called killers by their respective names after reading ALL LORE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. My friends got really confused and had to keep asking who Rin, Sally, Evan, or Max. They got really confused when I started calling the Legion by their name depending on who‚Äôs body cosmetic it was.

Thanks I made it myself

This^^^^  had this happen to me the other day where I couldn't find this Nea all game. It came down to her and this p3 kate. I wanted to let one of them live but I wanted to let the kate live because I saw her do a little bit of everything (hex totem, hook saves and gens)  I didn't want to go to ECG with Nea and end it that way because I was playing pig and shes too slow to go to door to door. So for awhile I did not down the kate, hit her once, gave her some self heal points and searched for the Nea. Finally slugged kate after 5 min of searching, banking on her to heal up the kate. Nea finally came out of the entity's butt to come help Kate and I downed and hooked her. Kate was near by bleeding out.Nea killed herself on her first hook and I picked up kate and let her wiggle off.  I followed Kate until she found the hatch and nodded to her like yes little one you earned this, you won "The Game" lol
---
That sounds like a terrible experience for everyone on the Survivor side
---
His point is not that the complaints about Billy / Nurse / Spirit are unwarranted, but that people are massive hypocrites when they bully any Killer that isn't Billy / Nurse / Spirit and then act surprised when no one wants to play those Killers.
---
Tier 3 perks at rank 14, playing with other similar ranks, and still blames the "game balance". üòÇ. Such a great community.

Me when I tried learning Huntress. Played about 5 matches where I was shit, got called shit in every match I played, stopped playing Huntress and went back to Nurse with an Ebony Mori equipped.

he was tunneling him before he even existed at this point

Uh....ok?

It is
---
People don't care they prefer to see everything for some reason
---
&gt;bloodwarden the hatch appears only if you have done 1 gen more than players remaining, so if all 4 are alive it will only appear when you have done 5 gens, if there's 3 players remaining when you have done 4 gens, 2 players= 3 gens done, only 1 player remaining= it will appear no matter how many gens are done
---
I'm pretty sure he was out of bottles when he initiated the chase.
---
If you want to progress a different character besides your main,then farm them with the man and dump them all on the other one
---
Why is it that you don't know how to read?
---
this pleases the n u t
---
excuse me what the fuck
---
God I hope not
---
I played a game as a survivor (bougie Ace gang) and I was the only one who did a gen and my entire team got slaughtered by a spirit (who closed the hatch) and forced me to open a whole exit gate and leave (and I didn‚Äôt even get a pip)
---
dunno, i see friendly Ghostface's teabagging all the time
---
seriously, since gf came out ive seen so many potato killers that cry about how the game favors survivors
---
Actually, Nea's the Entity
---
Playerlevel 2, Survivor Rank 20. I just started and made the Tutorial which gave me a couple Blood points.
---
Clown should be top. I mean..people do have a real fear of clowns in real life so he can be fucking scary.
---
As a fellow Wraith main (who also has a Jane Romero flare. Weird) the most satisfying shit is proving high ranked Survivors wrong when I dominate them as Wraith. But with that being said past rank 4 or so I don't even bother. The only way to get Killers with inherently worse Killers is when the Survivors do inherently worse because "lol ez (non meta pick) time to bully some rank 20s." While there are definetly toxic players at high ranks the vast majority of them know how the fuck to play and will curb stomp you for playing off-meta.
---
You win at mid-high ranks by playing against people who think their gods. You win at high ranks by playing gods against gods.
---
Ugh, he‚Äôs doing his own theme music? Big, dumb and tone-deaf. I am *so glad* I was unconscious for all this.
---
You can't combine this perk with deliverance because deliverance is a luck based perk. Simply will not work.
---
yeah with an item she doesnt anymore so... oof
---
The thing is, Legion could be anybody, that was the entire theme behind them
---
Kinky
---
True, but in the whole game session we actually only busted 2 skill checks.
---
Likely he had good game sense, but i guess it¬¥s because he¬¥s an experienced player familiar with the Nurse.
---
Because Rank 1 sucks and i purposefully dont play enough to not rank up enough
---
Myers*
---
Lmao
---
No... just no... jokes dead

I just cant seem to find another game I enjoy... I use to play gta 5 and I got bored.

I'm gonna make HEX:Erection now, and you can't stop me.

How often do survivors get outplayed by killers addons? All seeing wraith, Myers, piggy... instadown ghostface,myers,billy, plague blah blah blah
---
I love this picture
---
Mickey myers, it's a good one
---
The mask is really cool though.
---
What is it rebelling from? It's making the rules
---
since they ignore basically all Game Mechanics with their blink
---
I don't like the leveling system especially for survivors I don't want to relevel all my characters again so I'm not gonna play mobile until they add cross progression if they plan to
---
Is this confirmed? I‚Äôll buy it
---
I started playing over a year ago and always saved 1.000.000 before spending. 
---
I prefer doing this way because I can manipulate every bloodweb at will without being afraid of running out of bloodpoints and grabbing everything I want or choosing the most optimal paths to spend as little as possible. 
---
I tried doing the other way, play one match and spend whatever you get but then in the next match, I would forget which node I was going for and where the entity was moving from.
---
If keys bother you that much just pay damm attention to if a survivor had them or not and bring franklin‚Äôs. Good lord
---
Ghostface down, Wraith up
---
Okay, so I don‚Äôt know how much you know about Bruce and Ash but it was extremely hard on his body. Bruce always gave 110% when he become Ash and he‚Äôs getting quite old to play the part and doesn‚Äôt want to half ass it.
---
He said he would retire from physically playing Ash like in film and such but would continue to voice when and wherever he can.
---
You're really that bad that you couldnt even hit the claudette? Wooooow
---
I mastered Nurse, luckily on Console. 9/10 games I manage to win, I end chases very quickly, less than 20 seconds, sometimes maybe 30 if I mess up. But it's rare, now. Nurse is easily still the best killer. Just because Controller is a thing, doesn't mean her power makes it low. 
---
Her power is strong, not by how people play her. Nurses Power is the strongest.
---
You also need to double pip, that‚Äôs about 9 hooks.
---
Nice response and yea it sucks. That's why on pc end chat I always say ggwp cause maybe if I'm nice they won't be toxic, I know it's different since you have to message on console, but it works sometimes.
---
The game is telling you "Don't play LF and you will pip"
---
RehhhhHUUHHHruHHHHHH
---
I feel like if you disagree with the way the base mechanics of the game work, perhaps you'd have more fun playing something else? I understand that you don't like when killers will focus on one person at a time, but that's a tactic just like everything survivors can team up and do to thwart the hunter. It's not designed to be fair, that's why it's a 1v4.
---
Hag is better than Billy and Spirit is better than Hag, Billy still gets looped...
---
Is that how it looks like in game
---
Sprint burst and ds.
---
The meme says it is boring, nothing special happens.
---
Come on guys, use the brain
---
Ya its really stupid. Only benefits is it can be "fun" for high ranks to get easy games on the 13 but its mostly a waste of time for all parties involved.
---
Holy shit, that looks worse than mobile!
---
getting downvoted for using franklin's?
---
Spirit: good perks, strong killer.
---
Clown:  2 great perks, mediocre at best.
---
Pig: 2 great perks, mediocre as well.
---
Leatherface, 1 great perk and 2 decent ones, awful killer.
---
Are you going for perks or just the killer
---
What you're saying makes zero sense: LOL isnt DBD, and in DBD, as far as I know, your teammates, sometimes, will be totally useless, therefore if I'm being useful and I'm able to survive until everybody else dies, I deserve at least a CHANCE to escape.
---
Not to burst your bubble but to get this person banned on PS4 is like a 4% chance. 
---
And all I‚Äôm saying is leave it alone.  They weren‚Äôt rude to you. They just explained why they are, and wanted to.  Stop getting upset over people doing little shit. They‚Äôre gonna derank and then not play w/ you anymore cus you‚Äôre a different rank than them. Problem solved.  People need to stop running to ‚Äúthey ruined the game for me for 5 minutes, let‚Äôs get them banned for a lifetime!!!‚Äù 
---
I see more people talking about banning people on this game more than any game. Just how people get salty at fucking *everything* god relax
---
a map that is dogshit for every killer by default doesnt count. Also Spirit is a lot better in it than most killers.
---
That‚Äôs fair! No ones ever been banned before if it makes you feel better :)
---
If you spawn in with a killer, DC. This is supposed to be gen repair simulator, not Dead by Daylight.
---
Also: I don't lose a game if I'm being useful and doing the objectives
---
After performing a Safe Hook Rescue on another Survivor, the Perk activates.
---
You now have a¬†100¬†%¬†chance to unhook yourself during the escape attempt.
---
How is it a luck perk?
---
Thank lord this is a shitpost lol.
---
yeah -148% resolution
---
Hurts just a little bit
---
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I've never had this happen before but can you close the hatch again in situations like this or no?
---
The game knows the difference between network DC‚Äôs and leaving.
---
I mean yeah for ghostfaces standard it is but it is just a shiny mask nothing really special while the devil face has horns. Ghostface really can't have uniqueness in his masks so it's kinda going to get really boring after awhile still looks like a cool cosmetic set though.
---
You can if you are quick enough and not locked in a animation. Assuming the survivor has not already started jumping in
---
Why would a server know why you DC-d? If you lose connection, it'll be none the wiser on why it happened. It's no different from the p2p host system. You just lose connection to the host.
---
The only benefit would be is you could have more lenient connections, so the server is able to keep you in game if you drop out for a moment (lost packet, etc). But I'm pretty sure this is implemented in the p2p as well.
---
Decisive strike, it‚Äôs literally it‚Äôs purpose.
---
When you're against Myers and a teammate dies without going down and it takes a moment to process what just happened.
---
You‚Äôre right. Survivors are the power role in this game.
---
Bit of a hostile original comment when the post applies to survivors and killer perspectives lol
---
I definitely don't agree , maybe at lower ranks sure as they still learning but from my experience from ranks 10-1 the nurses I come across are all fairly competent definitely at rank 5 and above nurses are very very good and it can be near impossible to 4 man escape 90% of the time (this of course is from my experiences at these ranks with friends)
---
I tried doctor yesterday. I lost. I had fun losing though. I feel like the electrode addons shouldn't increase his charge time.
---
I'd pay 40 for the Myers one
---
I just say "Oh. It's a Bubba." 
---
Or the dreaded "Is it a fucking Insidious Bubba."
---
aight just keep doubling down lol
---
It's actually quite easy. If someone gets downed and picked up bodyblock and once they get hooked unhook them then take a hit then once someone gets picked up again then get hit boom you have MoM. Don't feel like they will lower it because then it'll be really easy they just need to fix protection hits in general.
---
I have a DeviantArt, but I only take point comms
---
That guide absolutely sucks and should definitely NOT be shared or used by anyone since 99% of it is false information and it causes problems.
---
Instead just tell whoever wants to change their limit to edit GameUserSettings.ini and change the line FrameRateLimit= 
---
You do not need to disable vsync for this to work but you can.
---
Save file, play game. 
---
Do not set read-only.
---
Do not edit the other ini's.
---
Do not do anything else this stupid guide written by a moron suggests.
---
Change your costume Nea, Change it AROUND
---
Alright, Will do
---
Yeah, that was my main inspiration
---
Normal day for me loljkjk
---
Undo everything that guide says.
---
As a rank1 killer this pleases me and is so true. The only way to learn someone new is to derank and it sucks for people who are actually rank 10
---
I prefer "boosted perk and survivors who run it generally can't last more than 5 seconds in chases"
---
Power roles* theres 4. The thing is survivors only have to care about if they escape individually. As a killer you have to get 2kills at least to hope to safety pip.
---
What do u mean? The other two Claudette's on the Gen clearly failed the skill check at the same time as you.
---
Yeah looking at it, they do look a bit long, very nice flair btw
---
I don‚Äôt know what that means? But I‚Äôll take it as a compliment.
---
Curve billy is completely about skill.
---
Ah thank you
---
Yeah but I won‚Äôt get caught if I never get chased
---
Because it‚Äôs not just my game they ruin. They did this enough times to get from red rank to yellow ranks. Do you know how many games that is? And it is a problem with this game, because one person deciding to be a little pussy about a game ruins the game for not just the other survivors, but the killer too. Someone killing themself at the beginning because they ‚Äúwant to derank‚Äù (the matchmaking thing is bullshit, it doesn‚Äôt take that long to find a game on PS4 at all they‚Äôre just a bitch) makes it so the other three survivors have no chance of completing all 5 gens, and also takes away their opportunities to get altruism points. The devs need to put more focus on console because shit like this happens all the time and it‚Äôs not fair to people actually trying to play the game.
---
Oh shoot I didn‚Äôt even see them, good eye.
---
Mm, I see where you‚Äôre coming from and I have been using anime as a crutch, with the next one I‚Äôll try to focus more on my own style
---
the perk would still be meta if safe rescues counted but the fact that even flashlight/pallet saves don't give you a stack it's what makes the perk complete horse shit
---
Oh, you're right. I forgot about that
---
Lmao see this guy gets it
---
I mean... we could always mix it up with the Brandon james mask.. unlikely but could always be a possibility!
---
I like some of the harsh angles on the face. It‚Äôs different, and appreciated
---
She has like, no normal set of hair lmao
---
With the positive feedback I will be doing more, if not all the survivors. Any requests specifically?
---
^ Include killers! (Or just Amanda, oink oink).
---
Maybe, but the only way is like playing a bad mayers. The idea of being sneaky and all of this doesnt work at this rank. Is too much frustation for me
---
I would just assume press where the skill check would appear while healing, Not sure though. On console you just have to hit your action button, on mobile it doesn‚Äôt appear until a skill check.
---
Beautiful, wonderful and gorgeous.
---
Most of my teammates are just idiots at mid ranks, haven't really tried mettle at red ranks
---
Yeah, agreed. Maybe a sneaky Jake or Jeff may have something to worry about, but Kate, David, or Laurie are just waiting to run your ass.
---
Also, damn lol here I was thinking we were pals. Ah well good convo
---
True.
---
To be fair, I got into two games in a row with the killer lag-switching and tunnelling. The second one, I DC'd. Not getting any BPs from me...
---
Hey I don't want to be a grammar Nazi, but it took my fiance 2 years to teach me this and now I must further the wisdom.
---
You put an when there's a vowel starting off the next word
---
This art looks great, hopefully, more will be on the way!
---
Happened at almost every pallet. He let us escape but I let the entity kill men in case he'd depip
---
Oh I‚Äôm on the gen until the pussy pops, then I creep away and around so the killer does t see me, then he leaves and I finish.
---
What the heck is a vowel
---
Yep! I cut the hair shorter, sprayed it black, and then cut out the fake mouth.
---
Aeiou and sometimes y
---
Nice, was thinking about getting one
---
I got this when emblems weren‚Äôt involved :)
---
Didn't pay attention in English classes
---
Just don't bother with the game for a week. It's not fun
---
Oh shit, so my name is wrong too?
---
OMG you play killer with 4 perks ! WhAt A tOxIc PlAyEr !
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è there are but how tf am I supposed to know who the killer is. üòê unless they include a feature that shows you who the killer is playing than that‚Äôs a bad argument. You can‚Äôt run perks or items every game for a certain killer IF YOU DONT KNOW WHO THEY ARE
---
I've had issues getting the merciless, you will find people become super alturistic when your down to the last couple of gens. So if anything prolong the game giving the survivors a sense of superiority then finish em all when they make stupid mistakes
---
"yeah not cool that you stop me from surviving"
---
That doesn't prevent you from activating his power
---
Also the nerfs weren't that bad just git gud
---
And then when you do well "fucking camper retard, you suck"
---
Why are you trying to convince this sub to participate in the event?
---
Just keep playing, man. There's nothing else you can do about it. Sometimes it takes waaaay to long but you will get it eventually. You can also use SAM to unlock the achievement you're struggling with but I wouldn't recommend doing that.
---
I recommend it. I also bought their 'Halloween 2' Michael Myers mask. Both masks needed a bit of modification, but I'm a bit of a stickler.
---
Platform:PS4 
---
Type of bug: in game

Description: entity doesn‚Äôt block windows after 3 vaults allowing for essential infinite‚Äôs

Claudette would probably cleanse the totem
---
One thing I think about a lot about this game‚Äôs community is a lot of people cannot win with dignity nor can they lose with grace. No matter what side they‚Äôre on, people are just unsportsmanlike and also have no self awareness when it comes to their own behavior. 
---
And it‚Äôs those people who fuel that cycle of BM and annoying attitudes I wish we could move away from.
---
But then you play a 'low tier killer' and bully the shit out of them.
---
you spilled Quentin wrong
---
https://youtu.be/9WcMxkAWwX0

If this doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.

Peter: Do atheists go to hell?
---
God: No.
---
Peter: What about people who use the word "brah" on the internet?
---
God: Straight to hell. To the bottom of hell. To the boiler room of hell. Sometimes I like to take em out, let em think that everything's gonna be ok, but nope, I put em right back.
---
Peter: Good, that makes me happy.
---
Rank reset is rough. If you're new to killer I would advise doing survivor for at least a few days unless you're ok with accepting that you might lose some of your games pretty badly.
---
I was doing killer dailies and got a probably red rank group of survivors for my first game and ended up with a hard fought 2k. My second game I had 3 hooked and could have downed the last one to end the game SUPER fast. They put on streamers though and I don't like giving obviously newer players a bad time so I let them farm.
---
I got called a 'proxy camper' for patrolling the generators...
---
Omg i call it scaredy cat too
---
I meant getting the 4 mori's with his ultra rare addons.
---
of course she would!! ruin the game for the rest of the survivors ugh..
---
Yea they‚Äôre coming out with a 1978 mask soon, it looks amazing
---
Wait, THEY ARE?!
---
Will do.
---
So you know how to counter facecampers. Then why are you bitching about it? And yes high rank killers do not camp often because survivors will usually continue to gen rush. But every once in a while they don't and it's an ez 4k.
---
As i said, i'll rather dodge a key than waste a perk slot.
---
alright
---
If you pronounce the u like in USB you use a though. The an before vowel sounds is to make it flow better, basically. That's the ELI5 explanation anyways.
---
She said "I wish they called me" when someone asked about it in the Q&amp;A
---
Teabagging is a trap, albeit a really stupid one. If a killer sees a hunter teabagging and decides to waist their time chasing the teabagger when its obviously bait it's their own fault. If I'm wasting my time guarding a basement and everyone else rushes gens, that's an easy escape. Their will always be a way to counter a tactic. Except for party chat. No countering that.
---
And? Your point? This has nothing to do with killer add ons.
---
Mommy is an acceptable substitute
---
God, new decisive strike sucks.
---
I made a few Jason masks so it's not outside of my ability to paint it. I just dont want to drop 40 for something I need to paint. Same with h2018 mask every picks them up and paints them.
---
I mean, removing watermarks is really rude. You can‚Äôt blame people for calling you out if you do it.
---
Don't worry, I get it. I somehow made it to yellow ranks despite being a clueless potato as survivor and I'm so happy rank reset happened lmao. I am looking forward to playing at lower ranks again that actually match my skill level :P I hope you can rise in ranks!
---
I swear Reddit is more useful then school
---
I once got called "pay to play" when I was playing as Wraith, but it might have been because I was using the new cosmetics.
---
The bukkake killer
---
I don't have anything against anyone who plays it. I played once and found it distracting and as a killer have only faced obnoxious groups. I know not all are like that but that's my luck. I'm 15 killer and get purples in mine. Def unfair.
---
Her hitbox broken
---
Wraith should be higher in my opinion
---
Higher quality, but the charm is all gone.  Those waves and curls looked great.
---
I haven't heard anyone getting that kind of a cheat yet. It is possible to get it in like a minute and a half if every survivor is basically letting him stare at them. Can't say for sure without any footage though.
---
I completely understand. I'm sorry if I sounded like I was being condescending. Not my intention at all.
---
Is there a source for that?
---
Deadhard needs another nerf apparently..
---
I just wish it wouldn‚Äôt inform you until the third stack. Or they need to lower the stacks required to hit Max.
---
If he has tombstone and tuft of hair don't expect EW3 until at least 3 gens are done, and that's not "gen rushing" that's including pressure
---
You are a genius ! Every time you see someone teabagging and clicking the flashlight ever in a match just know that they are not BMing , it‚Äôs a trap !  Camping leatherface nodding his head ?Trap ! Start a a YouTube channel so I can learn these Traps!
---
I'm sorry, I just finished cooking breakfast. Dude what the fuck are you talking about? If you are clearly better than me, you get my respect. It's that simple. If you're not, then get shit on kid. Ggs as always, no genuine salt or anger, but I'm entitled to a little show boating. Please define how this concept is pathetic, while that other guy's logic about disrespect hasn't even warranted your attention. At least not enough to go out of your way and comment about it. I don't know where you're from, but that's the universal law of respect. It isn't given, it's earned. If you think that is pathetic, then you aren't any kind of man at all.
---
Lmao yes
---
I swing through pallets so often, it's a wonder how I haven't gotten stuck even once yet.
---
Claudette is the nerdy lesbian
---
gG nOoB kIlLeR eZ!?!??!???!!!
---
No. They weren‚Äôt cheating. Someone just fed him stalk.
---
It's certainly possible if the survivors don't make an effort hiding from Myers.
---
Good point if That's what the games going for your spot on I can't remember any examples. Only argument is back then the black person was always quick to die (scary movie made a lot of jokes about it) but that doesn't stop the P3 Claudette meta.
---
you get less points for tunneling. if you really want to rank up you are supposed to make the game go on as long as possible with as many hits and hooks
---
The punishment should be bloodpoints given to your team and taken from you for leaving them if you have a stable connection
---
Survivors mains I am tired of play againts the same killer
---
Also survivors mains freddy is to op nerf him
---
I tried nurse and failed horribly lol, I cant seem to time my blink correctly.
---
Tell her I P3d pig
---
Someone must have fed him pretty hard early game.
---
It really is like this. I always liked to play as other Killers but it's just a bad experience everytime. Even with good Killers I still struggle, tt's sad that at the higher ranks it becomes like that.
---
I can't believe this was real! Are you serious? No wonder this game is so fucked and toxic. It's bad enough now. But clearly nothing compared to the big pile of toxic filth it was born as.
---
Idk. But nea, feng and ace rage quit ALOT.
---
Adiris, my ‚ô•Ô∏è

Great art OP, Fantastic!
---
None of these "this comment needs more upvotes!!!!" comments are ever liked on Reddit. It's a weird, pointless thing for people to say, and since Reddit is one of the only platforms where people can 'dislike' something...
---
Uh....
---
How was that possible?
---
AFAIK, if you don't disable vsync your frames will stay capped at whatever refresh rate your monitor works. 
---
I honestly don't know what you are talking about because I've always played DBD after doing the steps showed in that guide and never had any problems.
---
Scooter is dwight
---
love your signature \^\^
---
YO, this is really good. I hope to see more from you.
---
Oh ok I see..  I was like wtf is going on. I never get that lucky as survivor
---
Ash also modified his Oldsmobile to fight hordes of skeletons and Deadites, when he traveled in time to the Middle Ages in Army of Darkness. I really wish we could just hear Space Truckin' while he starts chasing killers with his modified arm.
---
See theres the problem idk.. I use to play crash and spiro, gex, metal gear solid. When I was a kid/teenager..  but I'm not sure as an adult if those are my thing anymore.
---
I agree that fun is the most important part if games 100%, but a lot of that fun for a lot of people is the win. So suggesting that they play in a way that they are less likely to win is, in a way, like telling them to have less fun.
---
This isn't everyone, however. Personally, I love toying with my prey. Not sure how fun it is for them, but if I have the advantage as the killer, I'm gonna do my best to scare them, or make then think they are safe and trick them into a trap. Going straight for the win is fun occasionally, but I prefer to try to act like a real killer.
---
Damn exploiter, glitching to inaccessible areas
---
Yeah. Not sure what his gripe was.
---
I do the same the keys are shit
---
Game mode where Ash and Bill hunt down 4 killers
---
A perk I hope Myers and Frank are running
---
If they patch it camping kit and flashlight will be wry
---
That's a problem with the game inherent to the design of the killers and survivors. The entire game needs a rework to deal with this problem. But do you think you should just be able to bully low ranks just 'cause you want to use different killers?
---

I see no god up here.

Because you're scared little kid that dodges keys... but survivors endure all those stupid addons killer have.
---
Not that comment i screen shotted. He was saying he would dc if he was chased for 3 min and no gens were done.
---
Prove that you're a god then
---
Deactivate vsync, that should help! Here's a video that explains how to do it https://youtu.be/sjKllKJrdBE

Why do you need a swf, just play solo.

Is this all hand-crafted?

Hey boyfriend. I just upvoted your girlfriend bro. You jealous?
---
Pimp my chainsaw
---
usually i dislike stereotypes but i can say most of the time 
---
Laurie, Quentin, Kate and Ash are either those unbelievable toxic mf assholes, either nice teammates and decent survivors to face, nothing in-between. 
---
95% of Jeff, Adam, Jane and Meg, i swear to god, they are incredibly stupid, making the most dumb plays ever.
---
... and Tapp, this man is like too pure for this game.
---
dunno what to say about the others.
---
All of the 5 members online will see it
---
Not run at an angle. You have to be sprinting full at the window. It's made like this to prevent 90 degree turns into face vaults.
---
I guess it's because for the most part survivors just become "skins" because they don't have abilities like killers do. Saws, bear traps, blinks etc. That being said Quentins perks aren't exactly meta either lol
---
Love it, great job!
---
Someone is very upset
---
Same. On console. Lol. Suck at huntress too.
---
I'm a red rank survivor and after the rank reset I did 2 match:
---
First one: got chased by a nurse for something like 10 minutes and a Dwight was crouched behind a tree for all the time. Then the nurse hooked me and I got farmed and downed again. I used ds and I did other 5 min of chase around the killer shack and the Dwight was again behind a tree, (I could see him because I use bond). Then I decided to bing the killer to him, he didn't even try to run away cause the killer wanted just me. So I got downed again and 1 gen and an half was done.
---
Second one: chased by a trapper, hooked after some chase, immediately farmed and moried.
---
Now I know that quit the match ruins the game to both team mates and killer but I really ask myself why should I care anymore at this point. Team mates who do nothing and farm me, killer who doesn't even care and just keep tunneling and hit behind the hook even if I just got farmed in his face. 
---
Atm I have much more fun when I play killer. At least when I lose its just my fault and when I win it's thanks to me. And I can have a revenge on every survivor that I see farming someone else.
---
This is so true it hurts.
---
Thank you!
---
His whole point is that anything except the top 3 are discouraged due to toxic behaviour. Then people complain about tbe same 3 killers.
---
All I'm saying is people trying to get on your nerves and bait you into chasing is no different than the killer hanging a body in the basement and keeping tabs on it to lure more down there. Camping, setting a trap, call it what you will, it was put in the game for that exact reason.
---
A lot of killers(real ones) have severe narcissistic personality disorder...  Also not sure how the fuck you came up with hoarders, literally makes zero sense given the situation.  A real killer would feel insulted that the survivor thinks he can rescue someone right in front of the killer.
---
My signature is better
---
(Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Honestly? Avoid them. Or set them off when he isn't near you. They're big red pools of blood so they aren't hard to see, and if you're awake they can't even affect you at all.
---
Spirit is not difficult at all
---
"Ah... the good ol bondage outfit" -My friend when he sees this
---
I have 36 days played.
---
Not particularly attached to any single survivor per se but I think the killers in this art style would be awesome. 
---
I would love to see this style animated in some way though and I think you should pursue a gig with maybe an anime studio or something for like maybe a weekly comic strip in a newspaper or magazine. Really cool style.

Maybe you don't, I do not go into a game without reading every person's name whether I'm survivor or killer.

"Thanks for stabbing that dude, guys, but there are three more of these... Or leave me to do it, that's fine too."
---
As a killer main this makes me afraid
---
Survivors will have an open palm when not holding an item. If they ball their first, KEY.
---
I‚Äôm sure someone just fed for a couple reasons. Number one you said you were fairly new to the game so your playing with other low ranking people so they possibly don‚Äôt know how Michael works. That means they would easily end up feeding without realizing what they‚Äôre doing. Two rank reset was legitimately today so it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to imagine a decent Michael with progress on his bloodweb would be up against lower ranks.

Insted of buying add-ons and perks on a blood web its going to be something called blood-market. 
---
You can pick any of the add-ons and offerings from the market however not perks.
---
You can only unclock perks by leveling up your survivors or killers
---
wait what if survivors had hex perks that instead of giving debuffs until they're popped they give buffs once they are.

11 and chekaflex

You, me, Behaviour, everybody on this planet. We all know that p3 Claudette has Urban Evasion.

Also, we weren't a group in SWF party. We're all randoms.
---
Im a killer main. Ill say hi if I see you lol. I won't be a dick or anything, literally just say hi.
---
gloves(5) and leather coat (3) are not mine
---
Getting protection hits is easy. Just use Empathy and wait til someone gets downed, then take a smack while the killer is carrying them. Ez.
---
toxic survivors gonna be toxic
---
Prestige chainsaw skin?
---
What does BHVR mean
---
Claudette = Thinks they're a bush or tree or they're so bright you see them from across the map. Probably a DCer
---
Dwight = Shitty players who think they're good or really good players who think they can get away with everything, causing them to become shitty
---
Nea = Most are wannabe Noob3s. probably a DCer
---
Jake = sabo fuckers. All they do is sabo hooks
---
Meg = They all think they're  fast as fuck
---
Bill = BT, BT, BT. All they do is BT save. Adam without Deliverance basically
---
David King = Dead hard wasters
---
Laurie = They're usually toxic. Probably a DCer. 
---
Feng, David Tapp, Jeff = ??
---
Ash = They only play him because of what he came from 
---
Jane = Only played because people like fat people
---
Adam = hook farmers, like Bills. They'll bring BT and Deliverance 
---
Kate = They vault windows so much they a  build to loop longer
---
Quentin = Read Ash
---
Ace = They play him because he looks cool. They rarely run any of his perks unless they have a chest build
---
So nerf every killer except pig and bubba. Okay.
---
Dc‚Äôing gives the killer points tho. And they already got points for finding you, chasing you, hitting and downing and hooking you.
---
Wrong killer. You tried though.
---
I mean if you play Bill and dont run unbreakable i dont know what you are doing.
---
David without Dead Hard is pretty uncommon too.
---
It's a joke, because lower ranks are full of face campers

Ah, I see. Keep up to good work. :)
---
He‚Äôs definitely right, I tried to play some huntress instead of my normal spirit at rank 4 and well people were toxic as shit and said ggez
---
if it's too easy to BM then you're not risking getting cought. or even BMing at the gate won't use that much of survivors time
---
All of those 7 people compared to over 1000
---
If they can bring back the waviness that‚Äôs good enough.
---
Oh yeah I feel you on that
---
Nah man. I didnt take it that way at all. I was just trying to say I have taken on a few projects before I'm just nervous painting the latex idk if I will like the outcome (I've had a few failed projects too.)
---
Rules are rules

Does it affect you in any way, shape or form?
---
We, menmenist, need to fight back against objectification of men. All men are beautiful.
---
I like how you downvoted me for that. Stay classy.
---
that'd be genuinely interesting
---
Speaking of Jane making dumb plays, I had one hide in a locker then DC because she didn't fast vault out in time to hit her Head On. I also had Megs when I'm survivor always farm me off in front of the killer.
---
Adams with their Deliverance while i find them first and they either dc, either suicide on hook.
---
I love when people with no costuming talent assume a cosplay is terrible and one is pandering simply for appreciating good art that looks like the subject matter
---
Yeah, I don‚Äôt want this sub to be filled with ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm looking for team pls‚Äù. It‚Äôs not what it‚Äôs about. That‚Äôs why there are posting rules.
---
Yeah, I've been there. I was terrified the first time I repainted a latex mask. Always worry that I'll have to buy another one when I mess up.
---
Doesn‚Äôt even run insidious at least?
---
For now run either kindred or lightweight instead of premonition
---
Have you grown up yet? This sub is not for finding a group
---
Hoarding as in hanging them to let them die slowly and keep them around. And most killers don't have any way to insult them. They don't have social cues and don't bother with their feelings. They just kill both people. No one said they have to give up one prey in favor of another.
---
You've seen 2 posts about it which u could've  easily scrolled past yet you decided to waste your time whining about them
---
http://imgur.com/a/M1iUVLF
---
I think that part also has to do with the fact that we're dealing with an unknowable spider-god thing (the Entity). It feeds off of emotions, specifically hope a lot of the time, and I don't think it would get much from Claudette, Tapp, and Adam if they always died first. I think this makes the Entity the first of its type in horror media (I may be wrong, though). 
---
But I also think that this is why people have such a hard time grasping the idea of solo play, in regards to my earlier example. People just don't like losing in general, and don't like it when their teammates screw up. But this game is built around such uncertainty: can you trust your teammates to do the gens? To heal you? To unhook you? Or will they be like those selfish people in horror movies and only save their own skin? Will they be like the cowards in those movies and try to hide all the time? Will they be able to comprehend what is the most important task in any given moment and perform it, or not? Will they know what you want them to do if you want them to cooperate specifically with you, even though there's no in-game communication? That's the risk this game presents. 
---
However, people dislike the uncertainty, risk, and challenge that comes with that. That is part of why SWF is such a damn problem with this game. There's no uncertainty, the survivors know they can absolutely trust their teammates without a shadow of a doubt, and they can do things with far more efficiency than they were ever meant to be able to. SWF can also talk directly with each other, making any miscommunication pretty much impossible. If SWF was in a horror movie, there'd be very few kills, if any.
---
If you DC fast enough, they only get the finding and chasing points. :P
---
But for real, I'm just waiting until rank reset is sort of over so that I won't have dozens of lag switchers, campers and tunnelers. It's just too frustrating. I've DCd twice in my whole DBD-career, this being the second time.
---
I have the most fun with Leather.  I used to run that wretched insidious build but find it more fun just chasing and trying to use very little M1.  It‚Äôs quite effective at higher ranks.
---
With the Jason ones they are like 2.99 for the actual mask that's identical to the movie. I've had to heat those up and bend them to the right shape then sand and paint them. They turned out great though so maybe latex will be easier for me to work with I'm hopeful atleast.
---
So are survivors just getting out played by moris?
---
I guess dodging those is justified
---
Thx man great tips I'll try this now
---
There were some things I left out that I should've added too :(
---
How do you get those glowing skins
---
It keeps going all the way to Red rankd
---
Removed - Support posts. Use r/dbdLFG or the weekly Campfire Meetings LFG Thread.

First and last warning.
---
I know leatherface needs a buff, but making his chainsaw inescapable would be a little much. I was thinking about it, what if he could turn off his chainsaw to have zero tremor and noise for sneak saws.

Yeah let me just take one of my perks out for empathy and go out of my way and take a distraction hit that probably won't stop the hook. Mettle just isn't a viable perk as it was before
---
Why have u responded to me to tell me the same thing 2 days in a row, I think it's pretty obvious that I do not care about whatever u have to say. Now please go away, and if u ever see any of my posts again, please scroll past them.
---
Wtf please explain.
---
Of course they can. Why wouldn't all killers be able to open it?
---
Camping is only there as a result of the game mechanic . They didn‚Äôt ‚Äúintentionally‚Äù put camping in the game . They have made several efforts to promote killers not to camp through perks .  The devs clearly don‚Äôt want killers camping .
---
What about Ghostface and Legion? Two basic M1 killers with little going for them in terms of chase ending potential.
---
It isn't "inescapable".
---
This is the same rev speed as Billy.
---
I mean look at the flair
---
I think he did it's just that is hard to use ghostface stalk
---
Your friend just got a final warning
---
I have no idea what happened honestly
---
I always feel bad for those new survivors when I get matched against them.
---
They could rework him to have his shotgun to temporarily stun/ remove the killer from the game for a while
---
This.
---
Also it'll start the collapse, so you can pressure the survivors with it. You can't open one if the collapse is already started.
---
Also points.
---
You can dodge billys, cannibal has long arcing swings that speed him up during the animation.
---
I assume this way more with default skin survivors than custom skins. My reasoning is that the Blue Hair Feng with a custom outfit is probably level 50 and has all the perks unlocked. The default Jake though is either a baby or just doing a daily and probably have more limited perks to select from so theyll be more likely to make a build around the teachable.
---
...that‚Äôs what I said lmao

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ccukti/adept_nurse_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Maybe I should up my mouse sensitivity a bit?

Legion needs a full rework. His power has no potential outside of being cancer.

Ghostface needs a lower base CD on his power.

Watch the guide that ohTofu did. It's an hour long and it teaches about everything you would need to know.

Why do feel the need to patrol reddit, looking for people breaking the rules so u can report them
---
Have seen some non meta killers at high ranks do really well, but they‚Äôre few and far between. Usually make a point to message them and say thanks for the refreshing change even if they stomp me. Every second game is Omegablink Nurse or Beads Spirit.
---
Claudette- needs no money for skins to hide well.
---
I can't read üòÇüòÇ
---
Which it has been. I haven't been playing since like April of 2018.
---
You still can you can just edit the post right?
---
Ah, cool. Do you sell them or are they just personal projects?
---
Devs said that Nurse, Cannibal and Doctor are their priorities right now, so I wouldn't expect changes for other killers too soon.
---
I might be wrong, but devs seems to be happy with just 2-3 red rank viable killers.
---
Party suit Ashley.
---
obviously its up to your own discretion. when people play multiplayer games they are all kinda agreeing that the other person is going to prioritize their fun over yours. But, since the ranked system is based around play that is fun for the other team, playing in a way that makes you rank up slower and is less fun for the other players is lame in my opinion. 
---
the playstyle you described is most likely very fun for survivors. as long as you arent tunneling or camping you are good imo
---
Yet they still have a basement with one way in or out, with four hooks all set up to hang four survivors up at once. If they didnt want people using it, they'd take it out or change it. I'm not arguing for sitting on the basement the whole game, but using it strategically to lure other survivors to you is a good way to kill all four pretty quickly.
---
Like remove the ability to pounce *over* obstacles and loops. Yes, I agree, that is a good tweak/rework. A complete removal of that blatantly overpowered mechanic. Not to mention getting 125% speed on a "crouch" with no mention of cooldown or channel. Let's "rework" that by just not adding that in. Not to mention the blurred vision in the Upside Down. "Rework" that out of the kit. And the audio cue when entering the Upside Down. "Tweaked" out of the kit.
---
Lord Farquad?

True, thought the same. Thank you so much \^\^

&gt; Why do feel the need to patrol reddit, looking for people breaking the rules so u can report them

Because you broke the rules cowboy, you‚Äôve yeed your last haa. also the janitors do that also.
---
Unrelated &amp; moot point. I'm not talking about killer add ons/offerings.

Are you connecting through an extender?  There may be interference.  Have you tried or are you connected to your router via a cable?

A Nea accused me of hacking because I could see her with BBQ. Told her that and she said she knew she was within range, but I told her I saw her, so clearly she wasn't. She kept arguing about it and I just left lol.
---
Ur childish
---
Aight, well you can keep talking to yourself :P Keys got nothing to do with killer add ons.
---
Hex: Erectile Dysfunction
---
Lol survivors are just bitches man. Just wait until you get good and the DCs start to come in. They're toxic in victory and defeat.
---
Tbh, this could be a disaster for the survivors as you can ignore the obsession, Mori two people and come back for them, while only needing to worry about the last survivor. You might even get lucky with the second tombstone piece activation.
---
Ur mom gay
---
Oh yeah I forgot to mention, I tried hardwiring straight to the router and it still happened.
---
Where‚Äôs the chainsaw
---
Its pretty much impossible to nerf SWF without nerfing solo survivor. Which I think should be avoided at all costs, because I had more fun playing shitty killers at rank 1 than I ever did playing solo survivor. Solo survivor is easily the least fun thing in the game and any nerfs are unnecessary.
---
I dont sell them. I just made my own because the guys making and selling them want to charge 80 for something I can make for 10.
---
It's still easier to do a daily if you just do it without the killer knowing about it
---
Result: Entity Pleased
---
there are many ways to work around loops as the killer to not end up in a 5 gen chase
---
Ash: "When I said I like "hooking up", this isn't what I meant."
---
That was funny wasnt it
---
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm getting me wallet‚Äù
---
I forgot I could edit a post and not just comments. Thank you
---
You are very welcome
---
Yeah we can add this in and then you‚Äôll realize that the next match you play, the gens still got done really fast because they werent a SWF and maybe its your skill that needs improving. Crying about 1-2% of the population is hilarious.
---
Unfortunately out of shot. This was done via selfie since my tripod is busted.
---
*P3 Claudettes all over the shop... You'll be one of them, sooner or later...*
---
My main issue with his ability atm is that it's ineffective outside of being toxic. I'd prefer him to get a rework since he's such a well know character rather than have such a negative stigma.
---
Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.
---
I was playing a game as hag and was trying to protect my totem from all 4 survivors cycling on it. Start chasing a David, he gets his FIRST pallet stun on me after I dodged like 4 of them, and he t bags.
---
End of game, they are all rank 5+ and I'm rank 11. 
---
This happens constantly. Flashlight clicking, t bagging, chasing me around when I choose to ignore that player. Its frustrating, so I stop feeling sad about doing whatever I need to so that I can win. I tried going into this game with the mentality of "I'll just run sloppy butcher and overcharge to make it difficult but not impossible." It didnt work.
---
Its not ALL survivors. But I cant differentiate who is that shit headed until they do it, and then I get called bad for tunneling or face camping.
---
There is nothing funny about your mother‚Äôs lifestyle, it‚Äôs natural and perfectly normal.
---
I adapt to the people I'm playing against, for sure. If they're trolling me I might play a little more rough and tunnel one if I can. That makes sense though, that the rank system should encourage a more fun style of play. 
---
I do wish more teams I played against cared about how the game is meant to be played, rather than just trying to chase the killer with a flashlight lol. They make it so easy sometimes.
---
Either he found a key or he actually did do a gate without you noticing.
---
Which is why I think the best way to buff Wraith is to make Green Windstorm permanent
---
There's tons of stuff to do with him. Give it a cracked, decaying look. Give it an earthy look with vegetation growing off of it, like it was sitting in the dirt for years. You can give him a bedazzled one, for goodness sake. Just requires a bit of imagination.
---
If you want to move around the map with it use Q and E after binding them to turn left and right, much more control than with a mouse. If you are trying to hit someone with it get within m1 range of a quick attack, not a lunge attack, and depending on rank you can probably just rev it and it will aim itself.
---
Nah its totally comparable. There are game mechanics that can change the game greatly in your favor
---
Mori's are so much more powerful than keys are anyway.
---
You're a hypocrite if you think 1 is okay and not the other
---
Np
---
That was also funny
---
Solo survivor was bad enough for me to quit a few months ago. At all ranks it was an utter shit show 9/10 games. Even at rank 1 the killer at least got a 3k almost every game.
---
idc what killer I go against or what perks they use. I just want to find a game haha. I imagine it‚Äôs worse on pc since there is postgame chat but at the same time Tru tends to complain about very specific things that happen to him as a streamer and generalizes players in a pretty negative way, he has for some time and it encourages toxicity rather and productive discussion
---
Mettle was too easy to get before. You basically got it for free. Empathy‚Äôs a great perk, it gives you a ton of information and can help you make saves or, in the case of MoM, get protection hits during a chase or after. Its completely worth a perk slot.
---
Mettle can be still be useful. Its just not free.
---
if you dodge them you'll never develop a counterplay against them.... same goes to people that dodge swf groups
---
 Could have found a key it does not show up at endgame menus. Are you 100% sure they didn't open a door when you went between them it has happened
---
Amen.  Be grateful if the killer wants to screw around for 20 minutes so you can get 12k points.  Be understanding if he just wants to finish so everyone can go on to a hopefully not screwed up match.
---
Why should rank reset exist if the matchmaking is still broken? Rank means nothing these days.
---
It took one friendly Ghostface, 10 whole minutes of searching to find this fucking hatch lol
---
Using flashlights isn't toxic, and camping isn't toxic. Do what you have to do to win. Survivors just mad they got stomped on. You'll get used to it.
---
You can‚Äôt go lower than 15 once you hit 15. So this isn‚Äôt even possible.
---
I've had killers pretend to be AFK the entire match then down 3-4 people with NOED when the gens are done. What a fun way to play.
---
I mean I'm not detracting from your statement that rank reset is bad, however onto your other complaint. Why is it do you think you only see 3 killers at anything at 8 and below? Could it be their is some sort of aesthetic that draws those players too them? Perhaps its because their friends recommended them to them. Oh wait I remember now, its because they're the only killers who can reliably complete with a competent swf team :_) . Sarcasm aside if you want more than 3 killers to face at high ranks the solution is evident, buff the other killers.
---
You kinda look like Zuckerberg.
---
I believe you need like 2 and a half people to fully stalk to get him into that state with those add ons or something like that, if 3 people were sitting on a gen and not looking around he could have easily gotten it in 25 seconds.
---
yeah generators getting done at the start is normal and that's how the game flows... neither killers and survivors are entitled to win every match, just get good
---
Come to report it too, same map.
---
Youre luck doesnt decrease it stays the same. Using deliverance once doesnt mean youre out of luck. It means youve escaped before the second stage that isnt luck based. Your perk doesnt work.
---
Heres a small hint, stop breaking rules of a subreddit and you‚Äôll stop getting called out
---
That's how he was when they buffed him but it apparently was "too powerful"
---
They should just get rid of rank reset. I don't know how its still in the game, its pretty much been universally hated for as long as I can remember.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say so. Tru tends to complain about very specific things that happen to him as a streamer and generalizes players in a pretty negative way, he has for some time and it encourages toxicity rather and productive discussion
---
I could care less what killer I go against or what perks they use. I just want to find a game haha. I imagine it‚Äôs worse on pc since there is postgame chat but creating a negative idea of a whole group of people is never productive
---
I don‚Äôt think the devs would put that much effort into this,
---
üßÇ probably
---
Hex:Erection, hard countered by Small Game.
---
People always get surprised at how well a good pair of headphones will help in DBD
---
Well when it comes to doc in particular there will be so many times where you clearly shocked someone but they still get the pallet down or make the vault. If they could just fix that he'd be more a lot more tolerable.
---
You can just remember to not pick that guy up immediately if you just hooked him. Hell, the timer for Make Your Choice counters it on its own if you don‚Äôt even  want to think about it.
---
This, thanks
---
Imagine if Raven was a survivor lol.
---
tbh you can complete a gen in that time even with ruin lmao
---
I run spine chill as a way to chase the killer. Granted it's not as good as Obj. Or Dark sense to go looking for the killer but it's still enjoyable. There's always exceptions to the people that run those builds.
---
Why are you taking anything tru3 says as facts? He is the most well-known salty killer main.
---
His argument here is very flawed, the same survivors who tbag and such arent the same survivors that complain about only going against spirit, nurse, and billy.
---
First thing I think of is Huntress in heat lmao
---
/*shrugs* "–•–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –≤—ã –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–∞–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç–µ."
---
man you need to learn how to apply pressure without ruin
---
Nobody likes to lose, nobody likes to see three generators popping during your first chasenobody likes survivors bming during the match and the exit gates, and that is enough deterrent to play a low tier killer.
---
Why do you think is rare to see low tier killers at red ranks?

&gt;if it's too easy to BM then you're not risking getting cought.
---
Blame that on the devs. I'm sure most survivors just go along with the win anyway. If they twerk at the gate just hit them and they'll leave.
---
Yeah, from the description, someone fed him.  That kind of hacking hasn't been possible in a long time.  During free weekends you may see an occasional billy/LF who teleports to Survivors and instadown, but EW build up isnt modifiable anymore, I don't think.
---
Behaviour Studios (the company that made Dbd)
---
You seem like a very funny person.
---
80? Dang.
---
It's so minor and you've made it your personal job to go out of your way to report it, how pathetic.
---
&gt; You're a hypocrite if you think 1 is okay and not the other
---
If you take your head out of your arse you'll see that i never once compared them or say my opinion on XYZ killer add ons/offerings.
---
Damn that's some strong ruin where can I get this please ? Haha
---
This is not a good thing.
---
If there are only 2-3 red rank viable killers, then the rest of the roster had may as well not exist.
---
Well I cant bully anybody because I am a potato but i understand your point, in that case the devs have to stop nerf week killers and buff them to be viable
---
I like to run whispers, bbq, make your choice, and pop goes the weasel.
---
Damn I really like this art style
---
Yeah. It's crazy. I'm thinking about maybe leaning into making custom masks I see those sell decently too. Custom myers masks and vorhees ones are super unique.
---
Oh no, but we only have one speedo.
---
I guess the only option is for them to wrestle for it.
---
Would u like to explain why u have also got salty over me asking for teammates?
---
I feel this at a deep level.
---
I WANT to main Huntress. But hitting axes on survivors who aren't potatoes is impossible, so her ability is useless. And because she's ranged she doesn't have a super large speed boost. And her perks don't give her the presence she needs.
---
Between ranks 20 and 14 I had fun as her. She didn't feel overpowered and it took some effort to get perfect games.
---
Now that im rank 9? I *have* to play Ghostface, Hag, or Trapper to have ANY fun. But even then, I still get bullied semi frequently as hag and trapper. And I know its mostly on me for refusing to use ruin, NOED, or bbq but I just feel those perks are too cheesy.
---
And then I get the flashlight Nea infinite looping me, flashlighting me when I break pallet, and then when I decide to go after someone else, she chases and flashlight clicks, and I go "alright fuck this."
---
Ghostface with the dumb perks I dont like using, and perfect game before they get 2 gens done. Only to get "using OP killers with those perks. Gg baby killer"
---
&gt; if you dodge them you'll never develop a counterplay against them
---
Yeah, the counterplay is use franklin's or tunnel the guy with the key and make sure no one else picks it up. I'd rather not when i can dodge it.
---
is that cocaine on the jacket?

---
Will do! I just wish people stopped replying with stupid unrelated shit when all i'm talking about is keys.
---
Skyrim. Check mate.
---
Ruin &amp; BBQ but they‚Äôre good on every killer.
---
Nurses Calling, Make Your Choice, Shadowborn, Play With Your Food, Discordance, all good perks for Ghosty.
---
You don‚Äôt always need to use your power to stalk and expose, Ghost Face has a lot of strength just being able to approach survivors without alerting them.
---
I was playing killer as Freddy and loaded into a 3-man.  I ended up letting everyone go after passionately kissing Jake.  No homo tho.
---
Directly insulting somebody and calling their mum gay is breaking the rules of this page yet you still did it. A little bit hypocritical isnt it?
---
How? I couldn't even get to the gen they were working on.
---
Nah, it's much *cooler* for me to go *^whaaaaa* like a drooling idiot.
---
You can play any game without considering that your opponent is trying to have fun. It just makes you an asshole.
---
Football teams that win games 89-0 are pretty universally considered assholes. People who just randomly camp are also considered assholes.
---
Ok
---
Pretty good job
---
Yeah. I've seen some guys who have people send them masks (like ToTs), they modify the masks for them (after receiving payment) and then send them back. But then again, that could cost an arm and a leg too.
---
Upvoted for the username.
---
Ah, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.
---
Read my reply below - buffing the other killers is a bandaid at best, it just makes killer overall better which it doesnt really need. Game needs a rework from the ground up if you wanted every single killer to be viable.
---
Idk breaking the rules twice, then being explained the rules twice. then saying you don‚Äôt care, then getting your ass handed by the admins. Why don‚Äôt you and your friend learn
---
thank you! :D
---
This is the problem.
---
I play Huntress. I miss all my axes because of good survivors, get gen rushed due to no presence. All survivors are t bagging at the gate and clicking.
---
I switch to nurse with toxic build because I'm fed up with losing. Proceed to wreck shop.
---
Survivors tired of seeing nurse with the whole getup, run the "good" perks, get cocky and are toxic when they win.
---
Its a vicious cycle that wont change becauss of how the game is.
---
yeah it seems your playstyle is pretty similar to mine. if only everyone played like us :p
---
Lmao keep crying
---
Jokes on you, I always get found first and am constantly bad at loops and mindgames. Now that's not to say that my life is useless, I will always trade hooks for the most valuable teammates, which is generally anyone that is not me, so bodyblocks, risky Borrowed Time plays, We're gonna make it and Prove Thyself with some Small Game is usually what I run.
---
They literally said : " We don't want to make strong killers anymore, just fun killers who bring new play styles". After Huntress release ( which btw was indirectly nerfed with every new map added and every old map change ) they make 1 strong killer, Spirit. The others were mediocre at best.
---
More bugs
---
Great reply!
---
Yes, because more bugs isn't applicable to every single thing added to Dead By Daylight. If there's one thing BHVR has shown, it's that they know how to add simple recolors as cosmetics
---
I‚Äôm not getting salty, i‚Äôm just explaining that if you break the rules of a subreddit, you shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if people call you out for doing so. 
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand this simple, basic fact
---
That's not an immersed build, but you seemingly understand that aggressive play is better than immersed, which instantly makes you more valuable of an asset to the team than 90% of the people I see play this game :)
---
I believe it's referred to as "bullshit".
---
I like Jane with her jeans and striped shirt cosmetic but I like meaty haunches on a girl.
---
Devs are already aware of it
---
Bet, thx bro
---
&gt;Most survivors don't even bother mending since it literally has no use lmao
---
If the don‚Äôt mend they die. How can they not mend?
---
If you intentionally don't target the last person you hooked, and actually leave the hook after you hook somebody, Not only will you, the killer get a ton of points, but all the survivors are given a fair chance, and cannot claim you camped or tunneled them, and they will likely also get a decent amount of points. 
---
It's actually a completely valid way to play the nets you about as many points as possible as killer, and using it I pretty much got a 4k every game. There, you never need to listen to survivors again.
---
That's like knockout but way better
---
Who‚Äôs the artist?
---
Someone said I should play Quinten because I look like him today XD but I can see fat Zuckerberg too lol!
---
I recommend watching a streamer called gamma lunatic he is one of the best nurse‚Äôs in the world so If you chose to get good as her he is your guide
---
Meg Thomas soul
---
Is it really true changing CONTROLLER SENSITIVITY still affects the chainsaw "oversteer" at the start of the sprint, even on a mouse and KB? 
---
He mentioned that and I'm almost sure that has to be a bug.
---
It‚Äôs literally just a low quality meme i made for my friends
---
I mean survivor has a dead silent perk lol its called iron will and its amazing.
---
Nah, he likes Trapper. He was also the one who said Wraith has a low cap.
---
I do like how Doctor looks, though I don‚Äôt see Hag much. I‚Äôll have to check her out. Thanks, man.
---
I love rank reset for this reason only
---
What‚Äôs the issue? I think it‚Äôs fine. The way it is allows that you don‚Äôt have to do THAT well to black pip/single pip, but you‚Äôre gonna have to be pretty damn good at evasion/looping to get a perfect game.
---
Wholesome
---
ADD JAWS TO DBD
---
Im not sure adding comms makes everyone as good as an SWF - SWFs are usually friends and usually organized. Think about every other MP game that has comms. How many of them just use it to troll, talk shit or dont use it period? 
---
It's not a sure fire thing. It's a better idea than most but it still has problems.

You can vault a window or drop a pallet to dodge Bubba.
---
It's dangerous in close quarters, and that's the point.

All he's got is brute force, so he needs a lot of it.

This guy gets it
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a feature
---
Lmao good choice. Huntress is bae.
---
wow, are you a professional artist?
---
this made me laugh really hard
---
I once had rank 4-5 survivors against my 20 huntress. Too bad I didn't ss it, I was fresh to the game and couldn't quite understand what is going on. At least they were polite enough to acknowledge their unfair advantage in the postgame chat.
---
You see 4 times as many survivors as killers. So naturally you see 1/4 as many toxic killers in chat. They're there, trust me.
---
Yes. This artwork was 3 months in the making
---
He gets the quick destroy pallet like Hillbilly.
---
üëçüòÇ
---
leaked claudette skin
---
Okay cool I was nervous your art got stolen üòÉ I saw this on tumblr a while ago I like your art a lot &lt;3
---
You get a lot more points targeting somebody else, and that person on the hook has more fun. Its a win win.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you weren‚Äôt playing a couple months ago when a brain dead person could play him blindfolded so they had to nerf him
---
And, same as Hillbilly, if you time the drop correctly you'll stun him out of it.
---
Even if you miss that, you'll stop the saw and probably buy enough time to get to the next window.
---
look, I wasn‚Äôt real interested in the raid, but now they have shirtless Myers, I NEED to go
---
Gotcha
---
You look so happy! Happyface Leatherface, great job on the cosplay!
---
Well this was a first time for me in my almost 700 hours of playtime so I was just shocked.
---
Did rank reset happen already? I gotta get on
---
I was but now they've nerfed him too shit soo... they gotta give him a lil buff again.
---
Entity really out here tposing to assert dominance
---
It‚Äôs not impossible to hit experienced high rank survivors with hatchets but it takes a lot of sweat and tears to do so. Huntress arguably has the highest skill ceiling after all. You need to play not 5, 10 or even 20 games with her. You have to play Huntress for several dozen games to have a feel for her hatchets, then several dozen games on top of that to master other things like timing, knowing how survivors react to them, mindgaming, zoning, etc. It‚Äôs tough. It really is. That‚Äôs what discourages many from using Huntress in the first place. But if you have the patience and determination, you can do it. I guarantee it. 
---
Source - Red Rank PS4 Huntress main, have used her for about 900 hours since late 2017.
---
This is why killers respect pallets
---
A helmet? Deus vult head wear?
---
d'aww thank you so much! it means the world to me &lt;3
---
And if youre killer and chase a survivor for 4 gens because you cant catch him then cry about gen rushs on reddit and if a survivor uses the crouch button or pallets and stuns you then you must camp him :) we all know its toxic to try to escape the killer
---
Good for you :) I wish I could afford a proper computer.
---
Really good, was wondering if I should buy her next but I'm not sure?
---
Holy shit how long did this take you to make?
---
great video but where's noed?
---
because i could open it with my killers i play regularly but i couldnt open with plague when i played for quest
---
I would use D-strike if it worked exactly like this so that I could choke them harder~
---
yeah its gotten pretty big lately
---
You are avoiding a powerful survivor item. Survivors have no way of avoiding similarly powerful killer addons. It's a double standard.
---
the new "improved" totems' placements
---
new killer that needs to stay 500 feet away from me
---
Jeff that beard is godly
---
Oh no doubt about the skill needed. Easily the hardest killer to master.
---
But when you get curb stomped multiple games in a row in higher ranks it makes you not want to waste your time
---
He was always inconsistent with his power deactivation and still has bullshit going both ways (i.e. deactivating while behind a wall or not deactivating while fully around a wall) and as far as i recall they never needed his base recharge time
---
You did nothing to attack his argument, all you did was attack him, which basically proves his point.

RIP
---
Bubba's great because he has some of the better teachables. The quicker you get BBQ the better.
---
I'd recommend billy if you're just starting out. Being able to dash across the map gives you great map pressure.
---
It only happens at endgame. No one has opened a door yet.
---
But spirit can be bought without money. It takes quite some grinding but you can still get her without having to pay the 5 dollars
---
This is cool
---
Welcome to the silent minority club.
---
Only if he has a perk called ‚ÄúSmashmouth - Grab Survivor by the neck and punch them directly in the pie hole‚Äù
---
I don't really see this as a problem. Something I actually see as a problem is the way evader points are handled overall. In the description it says it's about your ability to stay hidden from the killer but when you actually play stealthy and the killer doesn't see you all game you only get like silver.
---
Looks great, but I think the combination of of the eye overlapping the hair, and especially the thick eye outline with the spiky corners kind of makes it look like shes wearing glasses. 
---
I actually did like a quick 5 minute edit of the picture in MS and I personally like not spiky eyes and eye behind the hair. But do what you like and makes you enjoy your art most. the eye change is just my person aoppinion
---
His title specifies it's directed to _those types_ of survivors. Quit nitpicking.
---
The brown electrode should be in his base kit and there shouldn't be any charge penalty, I agree
---
If you're just after teachables, leatherface. If you're after a killer to farm bloodpoints with, pick one you like. Take a look at their best addons and go from there.
---
I'm impressed. That looks terrifying and awesome!
---
Should it be impossible to lose pip in evader?
---
And the ban hammer drops in...................
---
you should know what I mean
---
Shut ur fucking mouth
---
That would be before the exhaustion Nerf but now that they nerfed exhaustion so that it won't recover while running, you can only use this once per chase making it about as balanced as dead hard, balanced landing, lithe, etc.
---
tombstone does not have an immediate effect. It needs to be charged throughout the game. your logic is flawed.
---

I always do and since rank reset was today everyone throws it down instantly or waits till I get close lol

read the flair
---
How many attempts was Evil Incarnate?
---
It does. It makes you talk slower and move slower at the beginning of the game.
---
Hello again, for the third time

&gt;No bug reports, technical support posts, ban appeals or LFG posts. If you wish to report a bug or get technical help, please use the appropriate weekly threads or report them in the official Dead by Daylight forum. ***Use /r/dbdLFG for 'looking for group' posts***.
---
I think for me it's how bold the outline the eyes are, almost looks like she's wearing glasses
---
You're a bitch
---
Learning how to use Whispers properly on high mobility can speed up the beginning of the game usually pretty well. From there, you just have to hope you can hook someone before that first person gets unhooked and just chain hook until everyone is dead. Survivors typically stay off gens when there is altruism points up for grabs.
---
There is no counter play to keys are you  mental? You literally just have to camp/tunnel the person with a key.
---
Enjoy the ban
---
God, too many to count. I believe it was seven attempts today, but I probably gave it a good 20-30 shots before reset.
---
It‚Äôs not gay if you don‚Äôt look him in the eyes
---
I don't dodge them, I just tunnel the person that brought the key out of the game.
---
I might try him again once I get a hang of how the chainsaw works, but I like the look of the Trapper so I‚Äôll probably give him a couple of tries. Otz, the streamer I watch a lot, is a Trapper main so I should be able to pick up some useful things from him.
---
wow do you take literally everything so literally? I brought up noed as a way of saying "lol sweaty killers also use noed, i'm surprised you didn't include it" and you take it as "well obviously it's because of a game mechanic" chill tf out dude. it was a joke.
---
Also, I'm sure that OP was not thinking about whether the perks/addons they were including in this video were active in the beginning of a game or not. they're trying to be funny, something you seem to have trouble recognizing
---
I‚Äôm gonna wait a little while before trying Nurse, but I‚Äôll definitely look her up when I think I‚Äôm ready. Thanks for the pointer!
---
Because the official one is bad right?
---
Very cool. The animation style reminds me of a cartoon but I can't put my finger on it for some reason.
---
Personally I think hex perks should be separated, like you get 4 perk slots and one hex spot, it‚Äôs mandatory at this point to have ruin.
---
Nope. Not even Insidious.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, what is this Area 51 meme?
---
That's my brother and he wore his handmade knight helmet, he didn't make it of course but he bought it for like $50
---
Business Billy with a suit and tie lol
---
But I don't see 1/4 as many, every time I play killer at least one survivor is salty in post game whether they won or lost whereas as survivor I've probably been flamed by the killer less than 5 times.
---
&gt; tombstone does not have an immediate effect
---
&gt;you take it as "well obviously it's because of a game mechanic"
---
&gt;they're trying to be funny, something you seem to have trouble 
---
Recognising
---
&gt;your logic is flawed
---
Ok buddy
---
Let's talk about this for a moment.
---
I don't think the concept is inherently flawed; the reason being that annointed totems are still cleansable.
---
Assuming a perfect game the killer annoints each totem on cooldown, upon which survivors are killed at 2 minutes and 30 seconds in the game. Survivors receive a global warning by the way of the tier 2 map-wide terror radius to start cleansing totems at 60 seconds and again at 90 seconds by receiving the exposed status effect. At 2 minutes all generators are blocked to further emphasize the point that for the love of god y'all need to cleanse.
---
Getting even one totem cleansed during this time prevents tier 5 from **ever** coming into fruition.
---
During this entire time the killer is likely applying little to no pressure on the survivors, initiating a chase would slow the process down and give the other 3 survivors more free reign. 
---
I will cede that tier 1 is probably too strong and will necessitate her being a 110% ms killer to compensate or that tier 1 and 2 should be flipped to give survivors more time to cleanse by way of advanced warning.
---
Many other aspects are definitely overpowered and broken, but I don't think killing all survivors will be something that happens in a vast majority of games if the survivors are even remotely competent.
---
People all over the internet are planning on storming/attacking Area 51 on September 20th
---
glad you agree! &lt;3 ;)
---
We were all actually wired in through powerline adapters, a pain in the ass to setup but great for gaming.
---
Anytime
---
Of course not, that‚Äôs what below bronze is for. If you look at the entire pip bar, somewhere around bronze to silver evader lines up with around black pip.
---
Thanks I hate it. It's really good like scary good...nightmares
---
Hmm, don't know what to tell you, if you didn't do anything wrong, I would at least try to find out why. BHVR don't ban or suspend for no reason.
---
Isn‚Äôt hag free? I‚Äôve always had her (I‚Äôm on Xbox btw).
---
Still waiting on that Scooby Doo chapter. :(
---
I'm coming here to find out How to find out why. I have no idea how to even go about finding that out, or appealing it, or what.
---
What are you talking about? They did nerf DS and they also nerfed mettle of man and nerfed self care and so on.
---
He thinks survivor perks never get nerfed as well so I‚Äôm sorta confused by him
---
Feng is gamer lesbian
---
[Mathiue Cote (a dev) said "just play civilization" to a player who was stressed over playing the game. Since then it's beem a meme on here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/82x5vt/why_do_people_of_this_subreddit_say_to_play_civ/)
---
I gotta say, what the man says it tru3.
---
Speak for yourself. I get plenty of points "tunneling" so you're telling me when one of these stupid survivors pulls someone off the hook near me and I have a choice to either instantly down a already injured survivor that has 2 hooks already and this will be his last one taking him off the map and buying more time for me to end the game with a 4k because it's one less on a gen or injuring a healthy survivor with possibly all his escape perks up and plenty of chances to get away, I should go for the latter? You can't be serious lol. I don't care about other survivors fun wtf? Its a competitive game. They want to win as much as you. I don't see survivors not looping like the killer like a clown all game? You act like killers are busted af or something.  They are underpowered as hell in high rank
---
Oooh, ha ha. Well alright then, thank you for the meme \^\^
---
yeah but u might still end up against good players. i usually end up around rank 13 and i dont play much after rank reset which means ill inevitably face killers that arent at my skill level
---
Haha
---
No blink nurse I guess
---
And then the mori kicks in
---
It is really boring though it's just a screaming expression and if they make cosmetics for him it's just going to be a recolor basically.
---
Would you care to give an example? I never got the vibe from him that he is encouraging toxic behavior.
---
If it's female killer you just say Harder Mommy
---
Wasn't it 6 days ago?
---
This looks worse than mobile does
---
Nah you also get alot of points when 4k too. Good luck 4king when toyr running around hitting individual survivors all game XF XD XD
---
Ppl are just dicks
---
Headphones are toxic ;)
---
BBQ is basically an amazing perk on any killer, it‚Äôs effect is pretty good but the bonus bloodpoints are what make it perfect on anyone. Really helps with the grind, especially if points offerings like bloody party streamers get stacked
---
Fair enough
---
what if im Both?
---
&gt; There are a limited amount of spaces to create lobbies.
---
The game is peer to peer, so far anyway.  So that doesn't make sense.
---
The correct answer is that there's too many people who want to play killer, and not enough survivors to satisfy that demand.
---
Send in a ticket to contact support and they will reply back via email: :https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/360000085466-Customer-Support
---
Yeah but i mean as soon as the killer catches up to you and see you are a Laurie he will start do that bug so you cant get DS on him.
---
If you go through my comment history most of my downvoted comments are all true statements made about survivor, then I get called a killer main. The survivor mentality is strong on reddit and they have zero self-awareness about it.
---
Doc's going to be nuts given the zap stopping vaults at these types of pallets.
---
no you have to pay for her.
---
I wonder what Claudette will be...
---
Looks great! I especially love the lighting in the background, it really stands out to me.
---
Yeah they probably do, I didn't even know there was a DS bug.
---
You just have to find the right spot. I kick his power off super fast.
---
Why does he look like Dwight
---
its okaaay
---
Oh! Majestic! A tunneler is a tunnler even at rank 1!
---
Yup that's about right

---
You can. Dont play for two months. If your rank 15 you'll get plopped to 18. Right on the cusp of rank 20's so then its welcome  to the thunderdome time.
---
They made it so it only works when you get off the hook and only for a min so as long as you don‚Äôt tunnel you prob won‚Äôt run into it
---
Interesting, I guess the DS changes and MoM nerf never happened then. Time to get Ash.
---
He got banned after making threats of violence to other users and basically playing a game of chicken either the mods.
---
Itd be alot of fun.
---
I'm Polish and This was The First thing they thought me in school. I allways thought this is obvious. (I Don't meen to be mean)
---
Oh that‚Äôs great lmao
---
Would make some bad killers like Cannibal better since he can do good defensively
---
Some killer combos could be a bit broken Though like have Billy paired with Cannibal and have the latter camp while Billy defends the gens or hunt other survivors
---
I used to call Hex totems ruin everytime
---
Enduring is longer than it should be, devs confirmed that is a bug and it should be fixed when Freddy rework goes live.

Damn. What perks were you running?

That's going to be a loud af game lol

The salt from both him and his friend was hilarious. Wanna see it?

 They should make a bot take control of the survivor so the killer can't lose devour hope, BBQ etc.
---
I would *love* to
---
Thanks. That's alright.
---
Surveillance is in the shrine right now. it will help a lot.
---
Tru3 crying about survivors??? THAT CANT BE TRUE
---
\*misses skill check and sprint bursts away\*
---
Attempt to hook the survivors, even if they wiggle free. It's a part of the game to give survivors a chance in a scenario like this. If they wiggle free you can continue to hunt them and get more blood points too.
---
Pick em up not that you have to and when they wiggle free down them again then just hook them. Remember they always fall behind you so I try to back them up so can‚Äôt run away easy or do it in open spaces it‚Äôs so easy to find them again then
---
Oh no, cosmetics, the humanity! How dare you spend money on something that offers absolutely no affect on gameplay, you pay to win scum /s
---
Jokes aside, that‚Äôs both really funny and really sad that someone can be that dumb lol
---
Neat concept, dude. I have a suggestion for Mute Murder though, since it seems kinda odd in it's current form.
---
&gt;Mute Murder: After downing a survivor, gain a token, up to a max of 3 tokens. Each token reduces your terror radius by 3.
---
Something like that. Maybe hooking a survivor removes all tokens? A cool concept for sure.
---
Are you actually watching his streams or just listening to another streamer just spout ignorant drivel about him? Because although I do think he can be pretty stubborn with his opinions, I have pretty positive debates with him without it getting negative.
---
How could you smurf can't you only have 1 account on the game and even if you did how would he know
---
The fucking hub cap part has me dying rn.
---
That looks like the player model when your scarified from the basement and the weird ghost goes up the sky
---
I could totally see both sides snowballing insanely well though.
---
So he couldn‚Äôt pick you up either?
---
You only see the same three killers because they are the only ones capable of consistently 4K‚Äôing - nothing to do with t bags
---
If every survivor was a perfect gentleman and you get 0 kills, you‚Äôre still going straight back to prayer beads spirit
---
His perks are meant to be very gimmicky so personally I think they are ok and I think Ace in the whole is especially fine considering it is pretty decent
---
Sorry, I didn't necessarily mean an actual smurf account. I was referring to them implying I'd been at a high rank and then had my rank reset. I thought smurf was implying that, should've clarified.

There's a few different kinds of disconnects (lost packets, ip drops off the face of the earth, pinging doesn't work). Some of them are clearly unintentional and they can work around that. Sometimes even the host player will lose connection to you on accident by refusing your packets for whatever reason. Servers are more consistent. They won't suffer from network congestion, so disconnects on the host side won't occur-- less disconnects from the host. Even if they do, the server should allow you to join back quickly in since it'll be leaving your husk behind. That's one way in which I can see servers being able to identify if you were disconnected on accident or on purpose.
---
My friends and I were talking about that earlier! If the killers and survivors just got one more open perk slot
---
Rank resets happens to everyone every once in a while no matter what so what's he mad about?
---
Hex: haunted swamp

I used Autodesk Sketchbook it‚Äôs completely free

Surprised Claudette or Meg isn't toxic waste
---
Oh yeah this guy was real fun trust me
---
How? Billy's chainsaw doesn't have a good paintjob at all and looks nothing like The Saw is Family chainsaw.
---
Honestly hard disagree. I've seen BHVR have more communication with the community and take more of our suggestions than any other company who's games I play on a regular basis. People who think they don't listen have never seen any triple A company ever.
---
Honestly, when 90% of my matches have Hex Ruin in them, I just kinda /get it/ at this point. Haha
---
They‚Äôre the three Myers achievements. The third one, Evil Incarnate requires you to kill all four survivors with Evil Within III. That means using an Ultra-Rare add-on that makes you super slow and it takes incredibly long to get to tier three. And if any survivors catch that you‚Äôre going for the achievement, they can jump into a locker and prevent you from getting it. It‚Äôs a super difficult and frustrating achievement to get.
---
Ah thanks bro. Never knew this shit. Anyway the thing is killer ain't fun anymore. Idk what the devs can do about it. It's just full of gen rushing, looping and then flashlights.
---
I can confirm neither gates were open.
---
Oh
---
I'd have some cancers to if I got fucking eaten alive
---
i call spine chill scardey cat too, he aint special
---
100% sure no open door  
---
They could have found a key but I can't confirm they did or didn't.
---
Yeah but still, there are many hex totems which you can easily distinguish, which is why when I hear him ‚Äúhex‚Äù it drives me crazy.
---
Reply to them "gg ez". Remember don't follow their rules, you are the killer you kill however you want. 
---
If you felt someone was gona get off from you, leave them there. You already have the game won ( 4k ) only apply this  if its not begining otherwise you are not gona make that many points.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me what to do
---
They did, even teabagged in front of it before jumping in as I moved in.
---
I perform well with her at red ranks; however, this is just what works for me. I have success running Ruin, Than, BBQ, and the 4th is between switched between pop goes the weasel and monitor. 
---
The saying is "don't  clense" and I belive this build helps punish and push the game in your favor for those who don't clense. They'll be broken, loud, and just at a higher risk throughout the game. If they do clense make sure to use the corruption, its so good. 
---
Also, some other good add on, the vile purge charge speed. It's nice to have it quickly charge and spew, paired with an effectiveness add on, you make for a surprise. 
---
I hoped that helps even in the slightest.
---
Open Handed is actually pretty good with any aura perks meaning kindred is even more helpful with it and Bond making teammates way easier to find. His perks work with others well put by themselves they're useless
---
while tru whines about stupid things alot (he makes arguments that dead hard is too powerful), but yeah, agreed, im called toxic cause i dont go after the one unhooking that is healed and go for the unhooked that is injured, like am i supposed to give you an advantage?
---
At least he knows what a hex is..my friends call anything that pops up on their screen a hex? Sloppy butcher? Hex. Add on symbol? Hex. Exhaustion? Hex 
---
Etc
---
I see a cat that's scared. Scaredy Cat just makes sense to me.
---
Here's the issue if you discourage swf, then people solo more, solo survivors lose to killers on average, in the same way killers lose to swf on average, nerfing swf, would make playing survivor unbearably annoying and killer stupidly easy, they need to buff killers to the level of swf and give dbd in gane voice chat, at least as an experiment in the ptb.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the Killer would want to Pop something else
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ALBh0W9
---
It‚Äôs just the better thing to do
---
Perk wise I'd rush to unlock BBQ from Leatherface for bloodpoint farming (and utility) and Ruin from Hag.  Keep in mind you don't necessarily have to play them to unlock, just need to pump your bloodpoints into them.
---
Now from a newbie friendly low skillcap killer to start with Wraith is great.  Very simple to use, and easy to find survivors.  Also as a new player they will just be effective in general at the ranks you'll play at.  As for Trapper while he is basic it does require map knowledge to learn what spots should be trapped on each individual map so I'd recommend watching some streamers play him on YouTube or twitch and learn some of that before figuring out for yourself.  Billy is also good simply for his mobility.  Even if you suck with Landing his chainsaws you can simply use his ability to zoom from gen to gen applying pressure and M1 with him until you get good with his saws.
---
Someone is #madonline
---
Why not?
---
Freddy is (at this point, at least) designed more for the end of the match than anything else. He has nothing for early game save for the fact that his power can latch on to survivors even if he doesn't see them. He has nothing for mid-game except for some easily removed stall and aura-reading. 
---
The proposed rework concepts will give Freddy something for early and mid-game, but now he has absolutely nothing for end-game. In fact, one of his abilities gets weaker and weaker the longer the match goes on and the more survivors die. But Freddy's perks are all still meant for end-game. At this point, I'm fully convinced the devs have no idea what the fuck they want to do with Freddy.
---
Ah, a repost.
---
A wobbly cock?
---
Nice dead hard
---
Exactly. Fucking disgusting company. Just like how on their forums you'll notice that everyone sporting a "user banned" avatar tend to be the people who give any kind of negative feedback on the game.
---
I mean yeah the game was full of disconnects and it really needed to stop....those people that disconnect because they got looped for 5 gens and were too tunnel visioned to chase someone else, or those who tbag, make a mistake at a loop and then disconnect out of baby rage when they go down. but sometimes I can't help but feel some of the disconnect were due to problems with the game which the devs show no sign of fixing. Ya know someone who say just bought Myers because they like the character, they have no perks because it takes like 2000 hours to level up all killers, and they go against a toxic swf abusing the ranking system with all their instaheals. Like perhaps there's a balance issue there? or maybe people playing solo just wanting a chill game and they go against a 4 blink nurse with ruin, noed and an ebony. Maybe certain parts of the game contribute to the salt.
---
Not to mention all the fucking lag and bugs so far. I haven't been banned yet but not going to lie I've disconnected a fair bit in the past. Getting stuck in trees constantly at one point, had that bug a few times recently where you can't heal or heal others, laggy killers that teleport you around because they're from some unhead of Russian village with poor quality internet....like what do the devs expect people to do lmao.
---
ngl I was expecting overcharge to show up
---
sporty lesbian xD im dead xDD
---
Honestly I still have fun as Killer, especially with Legion. The only quarrel I have with Legion is that about 80% of the add-ons are just straight up useless.
---
I remember I downed a tbaggin pizza Dwight swf, on the game map. The Hatemail was refreshing lol. Didn't even get to complete a gen lol
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
Like I said, these add ones do not reduce the speed at which you open gates, which was the original concern with Remember Me.
---
Bro if you think this is someone who is mad then I do what to tell you
---
What are point comms my dude?

I haven't been on DA in eons

They can't fix him. I really don't think they can get the reveal mechanic to work correctly.
---
Actually looks pretty nice for a ripoff.
---
Same. I think ‚ÄúUp The Ante‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnte Up‚Äù whatever it‚Äôs called is the only one that needs a buff
---
Doc is a low tier killer? Imo he is one of the most annoying and I dislike him because he‚Äôs too easy to kill with, I want challenge not ‚Äúoh yeah just walk around until someone screams‚Äù
---
Ash is a tough boy, he can handle it ;)
---
Ever heard of a rank reset?
---
agree
---
you cant change killers to only having to get a 4k, it awards camping and tunneling to guarantee kills, and rn the adept survivor trophies award overly immersed and useless survivors.
---
I‚Äôm a Survivor main for the whole course of the game like legit never played killer one time. One day I just felt like I should play some killer. It amazes me the amount of noise a survivor makes even when they weren‚Äôt even injured. All the killers I play against just don‚Äôt play with sound or are like listening to music or something because the shit they miss is kinda ridiculous.
---
Oh geez. My bad, I don‚Äôt often pay attention to usernamesü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
EVERYONE is OP.  We should just split up the killers and the survivors entirely and just let the survivors repair gens and escape, while the killers kill stationary targets.  That way everyone wins!
---
Toxic killers too!

My boyfriend's are as follows:

Uh what? Bhvr has been constantly listening to the community. Just because they dont add every mechanic *you* want doesn't mean they don't listen.
---
Don't you mean bond?

I did this In a game yesterday.
---
Generators done killer is distracted by picking up a survivor to bring to hook, 3 people left because one disconnected and me and the other survivor were at the gate, I was opening and let the dying survivor get hooked and left the door at 50% the survivor waiting at door with me took over and I rushed the hooked survivor, I then booked it to the door. By then the door was open.
---
So if you have someone to take over opening then let them take over
---
Nah, I‚Äôm a selfish survivor who would leave sooner than going for an end game hook.
---
Even if they did blacklist it and programs similar they would have no method to check to see if it was running outside of directly pulling a list of all processes running on your computer, which it in itself ranges from massively shady to outright illegal in certain countries. Even if they were to do ALL of that people could just use the phone version of discord so yea the point is pretty moot. An interesting idea just practically impossible to enforce.
---
I love it, I love the character design concept also
---
Pro tip for all you PlayStation survivors/killerinos. Sony is pretty strict about toxic behavior and if a survivor or killer starts flaming you report them without replying
---
You're annoying thank you next
---
Thanks man :)

If you did PayPal Id be right on it but I have no idea how DA works

Yo if anyone wants to play I'm a legacy survivor and have 1000+ hours my steam account is https://steamcommunity.com/id/Branflakeslol/ if you add me send me a message on steam and we can play sometime
---
Good for you man! Wish i woukd still enjoy it. Well if you can't beat them then join them. Guess ill become a sweaty nea with a toxic purple flashlight.
---
thanks for being the one person willing to discuss   this positively unfortunately i‚Äôm not going to be able to respond, I‚Äôd love to respond all these comments but as you can see, any dissenting opinions even if respectful tends to mass downvoted. to avoid that i‚Äôll just thank you again for being the one person discussing things like a normal human being
---
Holy shit is this 2013 or something
---
I figure if they give a flat buff to Open Handed and rework the luck system to also affect chests and potentially spawn location Ace would be a solid character.
---
2012 called, they want their doge memes back.
---
Well you don‚Äôt play often because it happens all the time I remember I had a hag no no me because I pretended to make a mistake so my friend could get a head on save
---
Just a small correction, the survivor can only see the killers aura when looking in his direction, not at all times.
---
On console dbd comes with doctor and hag
---
No, those act normally. What would that indicate?
---
Adam is perfect
---
Have you seen what they did to Claudette's waves? They look like greasy beach hairsssss
---
Some perks and Myers' addons, the perks are devour hope and rancor
---
idk if you know this but /r/dogelore is pretty alive and well
---
This is like super delayed but the movies and tv series are completely separate
---
Maybe the add-on could be something like
---
-iri
---
-increase range
---
-a charges faster
---
-stops when you hit a survivor
---
-you slow down a LITTLE while swinging the chainsaw (since its charges faster you ll could just get closer and hit someone easier)
---
-changes the chainsaw model
---
Doing essentially nothing. Just actually running around and trying to evade the Killer semi-compitently.
---
The trouble is that because of how hard the community is divided, it‚Äôs hard to make changes that don‚Äôt fuel aggression is the flame war between Killer Mains and Survivor Mains.
---
I friended the survivors I got matched with. This'll make a pretty toxic swf lmao. I found out the killer in the match I was in was new to the game. So I gave him some tips for trapper.
---
Miss Piggy, classic.
---
I'm buying her with shards when I get enough, I don't want to play her a bunch because puking is a tiny bit gross but I want to play her just so I can signal out a survivor and puke on them all game just for the fun of it.
---
You can use Hex: Devour Hope which is a Hag perk. You can use an offering like you just mentioned. You can use the Tombstone addon for Myers. You can use a spirit perk called Rancor. That‚Äôs all I can remember off the top of my head. All of those have requirements you have to meet, but they‚Äôre all pretty straight forward.
---
I never see it any more, which is good
---
If I'm in a game and exits are powered I'm opening that door.
---
How the flying fuck do I know what the hell your swf are doing at the end game? You could be being the most toxic anuses this side of Christmas for all I know and I don't want a part of that. You could be lost/unsure of where exits are/hiding/evading the killer - buying time until the doors are open etc.
---
I'm gonna open one. Cos that way the team know there's at least one open exit. At least one person is safe to leave. If the other three are hanging around a 99% door then you now know I've opened the other one and we're all safe to leave. 
---
Egc was introduced to make the end game more risky. More fun. So yeah open door... Leave. Simples really. Getting Salty that someone started a timer (that slows down when a surv is downed or hooked) and your swf bud or you died in that time is purely no one's fault but your own. This entire game is about choice. You obvs made a bad one, got Salty about it and came here to tell others how to play.
---
How is you game so bright and clear?
---
Noice. üëçüèª

Theres no an official responce to the "Deliverance and luck topic", the devs  turn a deaf ear when someone talk about it as a Bug. It's a [steam comunity theory](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1733213724903304520/?fbclid=IwAR1jmulSKo9Cm7oilsVaY7tTjRG3CrZnoTibsaLxDmCfvO3Qpg2yQ2d-ky4), but when you  "attempt to escape" a luck  clover  is  is shown in  HUD.
---
Whatever, it is always possible to add in the perk description "Your chances to unhook yourself in the first phase of sacrifice will be reduced to 0%".
---
You have to be consistent with her vomit, contaminating everything the survivors come in contact with. The wiki says that environmental objects stay infected for 35 seconds so you can use little vomit when infecting gens, totems,, etc. The key is to get them to a point where they have to cleanse. And when they finally do cleanse to immediately re infect them so they can cleanse again. I usually get to a point where all the pools are used up and corrupt purge is automatically ingested. Try to make sure that the amount of vomit spewed on to survivors is large so it speeds up the infection. If you deal with survivors who don‚Äôt cleanse, work on active listening skills because the groaning and moaning of infected survivors give their position away.
---
Get spine chill and walk or crouch away and hide before the killer gets to you. Always look out for the nearest pallet when youre doing objectives so you have a loop to go to if the killer finds you.

Unless people just fed him
