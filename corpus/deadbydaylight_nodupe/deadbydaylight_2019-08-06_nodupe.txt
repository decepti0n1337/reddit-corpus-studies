This was my first one but I would like to start my Wraith and Nea cosplay soon. Sadly I can‚Äôt since I won‚Äôt be home for 4 months later this month. But after that I will most likely do Wraith
---
Ayo I haven't played in a while due to a couple bugs ruining the experience, have been into Minecraft and R6 Siege again. Fuck man the break has been worth it and those games are so fun when you haven't played them in a while. I'd come on some time just hit me up with a friend request. My PSN is TheManiac021.
---

---
*hello there*
---
Y tho?
---
I had an SWF of 3 people, all three of them named after a survivor in DBD (no naming and shaming). It was quite sad to say the least.
---
I do use ruin can never get totem to last more than 20 seconds tops. I get tons of 5 to 6 min games (rank 1-2) almost always black pip because I keep getting such short ass games. I do gen kicks but not constantly sometimes it's better to end a chase rather than going to kick a gen I apply loads of pressure as to get iri chaser u need constant downs and wins to get it iri which implies if you have iri chaser then gens should last at least 8 to 10 mins but nope I get tons of 5 to 6 min games.
---
Well do you have discord or something because I would love to keep in contact with you and see more of your cosplays when you do get to them

Well done! Looks like ur floating

To be fair, Bubba in the original film managed to come across as a genuine threat while still seeming doofy and bumbling. It kind of feels thematically correct that in a lineup of Killers in the Entity's realm, he'd be the least capable, considering he's mentally handicapped and behaves like an uncoordinated toddler with a chainsaw and mallet. He's also kind of sympathetic in the first film, so everyone in DBD thinking he's an adorable non-threat is fitting.
---
u stop and respect them; then stare as they t-bag and feed you evil within
---
Nerf Freddy? What you talking about? Since he came out reworked they were hot and heavy the first 2 days on PS4, every game or every other game it was a Freddy and for the last week I haven‚Äôt played against any! Just the normal, spirits, pigs, Billy‚Äôs and a wacky nurse here and there, few Myers after dark...
---
That's *Queen* Amanda
---
Here's one; me being taken to hook, I see a teammate crouching around the corner from said hook.  The killer hooks me, my 1st hook, and as they turn to go to gen that busted the team8 runs and gets me off hook.
---
The killer, who was only 10 meters away, 180s and tunnels me, who doesn't have endurance from borrowed time.  My 2nd hook, the same team8 tries again with same timing, but luckily; for me; they're pulled off me before they get the "save."
---
At the end of match I see that no one in the game  was running 'We're gonna live forever' or 'borrowed time.'
---
Why?
---
Congratulations
---
"Oh shit, I'm sorry"
---
"Sorry for what?"
---
I'm only rank 5 so that's probably why I feel differently too you if your against top tier survivors I'm not surprised your having a rougher time but in the lower ranks it seems fairly well balanced just my opinion on it has to be an accessible atmosphere for pros and casual players even at rank 5 people can't repair through ruin haha
---
That's awesome that you have to queue with a rank 20 to win games. It gets too hard playing against good killers huh?
---
Good work, bruv!
---
They‚Äôre good ideas
---
Fuck
---
u know what, i agree with u. i was kinda just jumping on the bandwagon of taking the piss out of how non-threatening he is to go against, like good survivors won't die to him but in the movies he's a pretty savage and ruthless killer

Stop being a toxic killer ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Uh...source?
---
Yes megamind nice
---
The game has a shit design. It is basically a farming simulator, where you have to make sure to do a decent amount of everything and get points in every category.
---
Never mind that you wipe out all four survivors without a single gen done. Never mind that you've achieved your job incredibly efficiently as a killer, it's not good enough. Because you didn't chase everyone for a few minutes each.
---
It's the same with survivor. You can escape killer all match. Entire team never gets hooked, plays the best they could possibly be, and all four escape. Oh, that's a depip, because we didn't rescue anyone off hooks.
---
The game's levelling system is a fucking joke.
---
Remake LF is more imposing than 74 LF., Not to say he's better, per se. In the 74 movie he was kind of sympathetic because he was just a mentally handicapped person following orders. The remake tried to make him gritty and tough looking. So to answer your question, there's less of a contrast, I suppose.
---
Honestly mate, the game was giving me trouble about a month ago. I took a break and came back last week, man oh man I wasn't expecting the devs response of "play a different game if you aren't having fun" would have worked. I got to enjoy so many games I literally haven't play in months - years cause dbd had taken me from the start of playing it, it was only when the repetiveness starting to overcome me, and the whole thought of losing the fun of a game because I played it too much started to become apparent. Splitting between multiple games fixed the problem, enjoying a different game when I got frustrated made be feel a lot better. And now dbd feels a little new to me, since I gotta get my bearings and work out what's happening again. If you are having problems with the game consistently, I'd suggest taking a short break from the game or switching between a different game you haven't played in a while. It's a lot of fun.
---
no pip, 4 man
---
I usually don't have this happen bc with kindred, the ghostface looks like a dumbass, and when my teammate had borrowed time, he can reveal him, unhook, and then the Ghostface dc's
---
That‚Äôs fine! My DBD insta is @urbannea :)
---
Wasn't your daily mate. Was your reward for participating in the vanilla experiment.
---
Thanks for the support brotha. Am proud of myself for accomplishing something it‚Äôs taken me a long time to get to.

Thats a cool pic of your nurse Cosplay!
---
i ended chases in 3 seconds, 3 gens left. what else do you want me to do.
---
I‚Äôm so confused
---
true\^
---
Do you use Urban Evasion by chance?
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main (been playing for 2 years) and I never really gave Killer a serious chance. Well a few days ago, I got the itch to try it for real and between my choices were Legion, Spirit, Freddy, Huntress and the Plague. 
---
Opted for the Plague because I think her power is cool and she‚Äôs pretty awesome looking. Plus I haven‚Äôt seen a Plague in what seems forever (I‚Äôm on Xbox One, last time that I faced against one was maybe 3 months ago). 
---
And yeah, been playing her for three days now. I‚Äôve had some really bad matches, along side some really good matches. So I‚Äôm kinda happy about this.
---
No sir. Don‚Äôt know what that is.
---
OP means overpowered, any decent player can make these killers to powerful to be fair in comparison to weaker killers
---
A quick chase doesnt mean its a good one. Longer chases that you win are better. Same with gens - you can kill everyone with 5 gens left fast but it wont guarantee a pip. You need to regress those gens too! Its the same for survivors - they can escape and not pip. They have to do saves/heals and do gens and be chased. BHVR is trying to give both sides a chance to play. Not for one side to destroy the other.
---
Seems like a good film, bet the plots amazing.

A little bit after GhostFace came out, I decided to finally buy all of the movie killers. Freddy is the one that I have the most fun playing, and playing against him is just as challenging as playing him.

r/subithoughtifellfor
---
You're making us look bad
---
I've had moments using and facing against it where I/random survivor got unhooked, downed right after, left on the floor, got picked up, killer chased someone else, downed and hooked them, found the previous hooked surivor, downed them from healthy, picked them up, and had their decisive skill check proc and get off their shoulder. People say that it's not as powerful as it used to be but I've experienced and witnessed those situations many times and it's arguably just as if not more powerful since everyone can use it regardless of being the obsession or not. It's  great also to essentially punish tunnelers, but it can just be a good time waster against the killer regardless of how they play.
---
How does the stored progress for certain actions like hook sabotage and Ghostface stalk progress work. Do they regress over time or an I just an idiot that's mis-remembering making progress at all?
---
I swear I've had progress disappear without completing the actions and can't find any information explaining why it would regress at all for GF's power, and the wiki only says that sabotaged hooks are repaired with no mention of the progress bar.
---
so he's allowed to insult me but i can't reply and insult him back? okay cool double standard. 
---
i don't care to argue semantics about what this dude in the picture is or that trans isn't a sexuality. you knew what i meant.
---
It's funnier when your teammates rage over the fact that you  got them all killed by cleansing HG
---
Glamazone is a bit too op imo
---
Agreed.
---
And most survivors should run Iron will, what with all the locker tactics and sneaking up for a save while injured. 
---
After getting rank 1 good, do whatever, but please run adren.
---
i don't care about the semantics of a topic or movement that doesn't even exist where i live. its not important for me to know about it and it never will be.

people trying to body block hooks when it's not endgame
---
Well if u think about all the Killer mains complaining about looping (the only effective way to survive) u say we should give up because they cant handle a bit of workout
---
keep concern trolling and pretending not to care about a topic you hopped on an alt to defend. never seen such stupidity before but i guess i should expect that since you people never hop out of that bubble/safe space you're in.
---
If you don't fully stalk a survivor with GFace and then you hit them without them being exposed by your power, you will lose that stalk progress on them, individually
---
Maybe this person IS Nurse
---
y‚Äôall talking about his bulge but he has a fucking **BUTT HARNESS**
---
Who needs 34 years gamers when we have 5
---
Yes, but you will keep BT on survivors that already have them (if you have any), but you will only have BT lvl 1 in a survivor that is not bill, if you want to have BT at lvl 3 on that surv, you will need to get that teachable on bill to do it
---
While screaming "Everything you say doesn't matter when the camera's aren't rolling!"
---
Jesus when did people get so sensitive? People don‚Äôt even complain this much about getting corpse camped in WoW. It‚Äôs like flipping someone the bird - big deal
---
Well, ignorance is bliss as they say. Have fun on the Internet, kid :)
---
Educate me
---
will do. you as well.
---
Lol nea crouching to avoid getting hit . All the killer mains : deserved u t-beagging trash
---
It‚Äôs just gameplay, it‚Äôs not even a formatted guide. Don‚Äôt waste our time
---
The daily was dor Billy but you played bubba? Wut
---
We can all agree that we only bought bubba for barbecue. Killers complain that movie killers are on a complete different spectrum compared to their dbd selves. Have you guys forgotten Ash, who literally eats demons for breakfast? Or what about Bill? Yeah, definitely didn‚Äôt catch him murdering hordes of flesh eaters and literal moving tanks. Oh but Mettle of Man? Yeah, ItS nErF oR nOtHiNg. Oh and let‚Äôs not forget David, who got stabbed by the legion and died. Even though he took hits like that on the daily. OH BUT THE KILLER MOVIES, so if we bring in the character who survived, or even killed the killer, or in bubbas case getting his arm cut off, can that be allowed?
---
Remember it's a 4v1, so is the killer getting 4ks everygame you play?
---
Is there an issue with Ghostface? No matter how many matches I play as survivor, I have played one match at most against a Ghostface, despite him being one of the newest. Is there a reason people are avoiding playing him?
---
Clearly your not that good if a single gen doesn't get done haha
---
say sike right now
---
holy shit, is it chosen by rng? how does agitation have 12 and several have 0?
---
My favorite was when my friend asked me where the killer was relative to the killer's shack and without missing a hint of sarcasm I just said "North." lol It's a running joke with us now and I love it.
---
I don‚Äôt get it when people say baby Dwight. Can someone explain why they call them this?  I get a lot of messages because Dwight is my favorite to play
---
lol no problem dude everyone is a dumbass once in a while
---
That's what I also think, but we got bored of the same 3 killers in the top, didn't we? I think it's time to make everyone more viable
---
How about it shows both you and the unhooked survivor the killers aura for 5s? So the unhooked survivor knows where to run
---
I'm a survivor main. I disagree with this entirely. the game favors both sides, it depends on who plays better. both sides have meta perks, and good strategies. killers are not overpowered. neither are survivors. there are however some very overpowered things, IE noed, Insta heals etc, that don't make the game fun for the other side. if you are a "good player" then you should be escaping, or at the very least getting a few gens done. it seems you just need to get better
---
SWF counters killers

This is not how nice works

Thanks for the petty comment to prove my point! üçª

Me today when I tried it against a Ghostface. I swear I could hear the player laugh at me.

I‚Äôve never felt so dumb lol

Yeah bill just came out for the ps4 version so I‚Äôm hoping one comes soon
---
I hate killers with a mcdonalds connection
---
Lets you place traps without being detected.
---
Lets you do sneak attacks to jumpscare people into your traps or easy first hits.
---
Increases the range of infectious fright by 8 meters.
---
I agree. Just shows you how powerful the corrupt purge is. Still dont understand why more ppl dont play Plague (tho I still havent bought her dlc lol)
---
I always say GG WP, and ignore the salt, but if it's all four of them? And I legitimately did nothing wrong? Hell yeah, mine for that salt.
---
Maybe just randomly spawning special meat hooks like in the events that take longer to pull people off of or debuff the person who saves them
---
I'm curious about your rank tbh
---
Well what I said is a fair point your saying your good when your clearly not it's you who's needs a buff not the killers that need a nerf get on a gen and finish it
---
I‚Äôm surprised you ran that fast with fat nuts
---
This was made with memeatic, that alone signifies all killers. Thank you for confirming this.

What about that Rebecca Maxwell name? Maybe she‚Äôs the next survivor?

A bulge would've been awesome.
---
A while ago they made it so traps placed after the last gen is completed don't kill you if you leave with them on.
---
More recently they made it so her dash doesn't apply on hit effects.
---
You can stun a cloaked wraith too
---
w33d
---
oh thanks
---
Watch a few videos from people who have played a long time and try to copy how they play. As a survivor always be doing a hen unless you being chased. If you are being chased try and loop the killer around pallets for as long as possible before using the pallet. As killer you need to learn when to give up on a chase and learn how to red glow mind game
---
Typical Nea. Good shit.
---
A optimal group of survivors should always beat the killer unless you play nurse then it‚Äôs almost even but probably still in the survivors favour
---
People who dc are trash and should get punished tbh
---
Why didn't I think of this lol
---
What should I do against clowns? After droping the pallet he can just walk around the loop and that's the end
---
His sensitivity during that rev up is insanely high, you might not notice that you move the mouse very slightly while revving.
---
You thought pallets were meant for survivors? FOR SHAME, If killers can‚Äôt hit you through them the game is imbalanced.
---
Perfect

What‚Äôs wrong with the big gay?
---
JenDenise I assume? Yeah, shes toxic as fuck. Intentionally downranks so she and her SWF buddies can bully lower ranked killers, shit talking how bad they are all game then tea-bagging at the exit gates. It's pretty insane that BHVR still allows her to be a Fog Whisperer with what she does.
---
Thats like saying WAR IS BAD, PEOPLE DIE, WE NEED PEACE NOW. üòÇ
---
Looks like Rebecca Caldwall to me
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúgay‚Äù
---
Why isn‚Äôt this real
---
I read somewhere that if you are playing killer just go into a survivor lobby, close chat and then leave. Should carry over to your killer lobby at the end screen.
---
He‚Äôs fun as fuck and I run him super effectively around rank 6, not the best killer ever and you‚Äôll need some classic m1 killer perk builds but he‚Äôs sweet, if you get him the number one tip I can give you is don‚Äôt rely on stalking like you would with Mike, the Night Shroud disables red stain and terror radius which can give you the easiest mind games and sneak attacks, but that‚Äôs not to say stalking is a bad idea, remember to lean, you‚Äôll get bullied a few times but he‚Äôs good fun
---
Me on comms running bond seeing teammate bringing killer to my gen: NOT THIS WAY NOT THIS WAY NOT THIS WAY
---
Yup that's how dead by daylight is right now
---
yea.. almost way you can do a game from the start with just 3
---
What is sandbagging?
---
How about when protection hits don‚Äôt register?
---
The game is horribly optimized, even for PCs. I just build a new one myself and barely get 60 something FPS at Ultra.
---
I've always said a lot of toxicity comes from streamers like that. It normalizes and makes toxicity seem funny and ok.
---
Can confirm, went from PS4 to PC, highly recommend the change.

Maybe the closer you get to the locker the killer is in, the louder the heartbeat and music, so survivors would think oh no killer's getting too close, better get in here and HA! Killer dwight strikes again.

I got all dlc killers, but my favourite is leatherface somehow even swf has no chance against me

What did I just read
---
We have so few players as it is. Who would wanna be apart of a community that is essentially promoting bullying. And we can see there are 2 parties in the community rn. True is trying to get rid of the toxicity. While others promote it for views. The devs don't even acknowledge how bad it is. They don't care. True has been sniped for 13 days straight. Not a single thing done and imagine for our new players
---
If you change what's in  %localappdata%\\DeadByDaylight\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor\\Engine.ini  
---
 you can't get banned for that. when you used to be able to change the save files (Somebody told me about it) tht's what you could get banned for. You were allowed to change the max FPS  but not the save files. The chance of getting banned for changing  toggle for post game chat is small.
---
Ok, i didn‚Äôt know if it was worth running. I‚Äôll try it out
---
You're just toggling the post-game chat. You can't get banned for that.

I know imma get hate for this but dont worry just play the game. As long as you're not cheating your good.
---
I don‚Äôt mind them honestly talking shit in there own twitch as long as there not typing mean shit in the end game chat to the killer
---
Its so sad too. I moved from pc to console and I have to say its less bad but you can see the imitators still sometimes being toxic
---
Well I'm going to just disgusted that such people are even allowed to play video games online.
---
Games have been ruined by these garbage human beings who play games with others yet they themselves are that far up their own assholes that they believe they are exempt from responsibility for their mistakes.
---
I can admit that I suck at survivor and am a average oddball killer but when I have a good game I shouldn't have these assholes getting in my dm's trying to act like I'm in the wrong.
---
When I get too high rank I try meme builds until I'm back where I feel comfortable
---
Would you be referring to kittychipz by any chance? I popped in a little while ago and caught one of her games vs a Pig, shit was hilarious though.
---
But you are all the same rank basically. If you play killer alot you'll run into this bs constantly
---
Hell they still have not fixed that god aim with the saw yet when you are on the other side of the corner yet that shit still hits lol. I don‚Äôt think they will ever fix that stuff
---
They did say they got fucked
---
Most people in high ranks may be running Borrowed Time, you may find it actually be the logically decision to go after the guy who rescued the person.

But I mean if that's not the case for you, then do whatever

New to PC but veteran Xbox player. Is there an easy way to constantly look behind whilst running on M&amp;K or is it just a get used to it kind of thing?
---
Spirit, nurse, Billy, go zoooOOOooom.
---
It‚Äôs ok. I was bored. But learn other words because while I‚Äôm not offended you could actually make someone sad using that. No one deserves that. Hope your games get better
---
Or just let us slide bruh
---
Honestly rarely happens. But enough to complain about it. It more of a matter of actually getting the chance to get a stack.
---
Go to the Jigsaw stations highlighted in white, if there are 4 of them, there is a 25% chance each one will have the "key" to take it off.
---
It's also worth noting that the trap timer doesn't activate until the next gen turns on. So if all gens are done and she puts one on you, just leave. But if it is activated it'll kill you if you try to leave
---
Where's the chainsaw?
---
I don‚Äôt think that ghostface is too much like Myers. Saying that they have different kinds of stalks, I‚Äôm fine with killers that stalk. Your concept would make him literally garbage with no chase ability.

just search "dead by daylight discord"

You just need to get used to M&amp;K, maybe you can practice in the tutorial mode

Bingo, but do you think that was at all fun for amanda? Doubt it. She still got upset about getting face camped. Lmao bruh moris were made for people like that. Its still promoting disgusting behaviour no matter how you slice it. In fact I bet she thinks of the imaginary survival rules when she gets hooked after spamming her flash light the entire game

Before I bought Freddy by the end of a season I was a solid rank 8 killer, would see 7 then depip. Now with Freddy I just got to rank 4 after about 3 weeks and have only had  1 or 2 depip games. (One week I was on vacation.) He has strong map pressure, snares let you know where survivors are, and multiple times now Blood Warden has turned a 2K game into a 4K game. 
---
And only a few times even with 0K games have I not had fun (Thanks toxic SWF, and God tier 360 spinners, no more lunge strikes now.) 
---
He has been my favorite killer since the rework and I would recommend anyone to purchase him and have some fun sacrificing 4 strangers.
---
I handle 'stuff' just fine I don't need someone trying to censor me when I'm not sitting here telling to read this shit if you have nothing constructive then scroll dude instead of giving me basic schoolyard crap.

Honeslty I feel you its best to just ignore those people I think it mught only be on PC I play on console and people never message me when play killer but as survivor yes I was playing earlier today and a guy was complaining becuase I used a key to escape through the hatch I'm the only one that got out and he was saying how hard it is get play huntress in red ranks and how keys are broken I litteraly only had one and wsnted to try and use it I wanted to get out with my team cause my mate was hooked next to the hatch but she wouldnt lesve the hook i trued to get him cause I thought she was leaving but she was still near she hit me and I dipped I was dead on hook and didn't want to die

That Pig was teabagging over her when she was downed before she even did anything though?! Let‚Äôs not pretend that was some saint. That was a toxic killer who got one-upped.  She wasn‚Äôt upset, she was laughing at being face camped, she doesn‚Äôt take that stuff seriously. Hell if I‚Äôm not mistaken the killer even had ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in their name.
---
Ranking will forever be broken, my friend.
---
Absorb it and replace the plague
---
tfw ‚Äúahegao-is-erotic‚Äù unironically talks shit about the meme template source someone uses
---
Good idea üëç
---
To be fair all the lag is sickening when u join a match as a europe swf host and u get some McDonald's kid is annoying af cause laggy killer allways have the advantege
---
So true that the butthurt community downvotes our comments. Gotta love downvotes for speaking the truth.
---
Thank you!
---
Oh god that title was a bit of a mess, however, I recommend using Recovery and Activation on Spirit, and since you are level 30, I'd recommend just choosing aura or expose perks.
---
I don't give a fuck if you believe it or not. It's not a scam. It's something I found and thought DBD fans would like. It's not hard to Google GRUBL wallpaper and read the reviews. But you know what. I'll try to film it and post it working on my phone. You try to let the community know about something cool as fuck and get shit on. Gonna be all Ebony's tonight.
---
Ok thank
---
I‚Äôve just let myself get wrecked at level 20. Figured the beat practice would be in game.

"stop unhooking survivors you are suppose to do gens while your friend die on the hook" 
---
"stop gen rushing you are suppose to stand there doing nothing"
---
"stop blinding me with the flashlight you are suppose to use that as an accesory"
---
"stop complaining about camping just accept that I am trash and decided to put you  in a position that you are completely helpess and let your friend die so you can have a unbalanced team"
---
Yikes buddy I was just kidding, I don‚Äôt even have an Android so I can‚Äôt take advantage of this regardless
---
For spirit? Prayer beads to silence your faze walk. Grandmothers(daughters?) ring to increase your faze walk range. Learn the distance of your TR and stop outside that distance from the gens your sure someone is on. Grabs for days my dude.
---
I genuinely experienced this exact build today. Broke my Dwights little heart
---
Speaking of Leatherface...I just got he's BBQ and Chili as A Teachable Perk.
---
Ok
---
Huh alright. It should have some extra points maybe in survival
---
Jake for iron will, feng for alert (you get to know what pallets are gone), laurie for DStrike, Dwight for bond
---
It's all shits and giggles till the prayer beads spirit enters the lobby
---
I like when survivors do that because then I can do the power move of face camping the survivor I catch first
---
Cant stalk my girl if I dont have a girl
---
We are going a bit too far now lmao
---
And her weapon is a back hand
---
I agree that killers should have at guaranteed  2k potential on every map with skill, maybe even 3k. But 4K is too much.
---
It‚Äôs just the way the attack animation and  damage trigger work in that weird cone and timing it has, kinda makes it more fun in my opinion
---
It's r/deadbydaylight though lol
---
I would say nice but ur rank is a big oof
---
I just want every killer not to be helpless like all except 4 are
---
It‚Äôs still the only Killer that makes me yelp out loud whenever those traps go off. I feel your pain homie
---
Hehe sorry about that I should put a warring lol. But id love to draw feng!
---
I want that too. However I just found disagreement (is that the right word?) in your statement about 4K potential.
---
If you manage to get the blind off you still need to get out of the way. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve been blinded and still get the hit because the survivor just stands there/runs in a straight line.
---
We‚Äôre still able to move and attack just fine, he just can‚Äôt see fucking anything
---
Not sure if you've gotten flashed as a killer before, but it's not instant and takes a couple seconds of build up to fully trigger (that's why you see people talk about fully kitted-out purple flashlights). The killer can still move and hit you during that time, they can also turn away or down to avoid the buildup.
---
As killer i wont doubt it but everybody forgets the survivor side and that getting hit through a pallet that is on the ground sucks
---
Lol i mean it‚Äôs still a achievement on my end. Especially after only having played for three days as killer. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You clearly mixed up your post read it over again
---
Thank you :)
---
This, folks, is your stereotypical ‚Äúkiller main‚Äù. They‚Äôre quite gross and you should stay as far away from them as possible.
---
And i am just saying that it needs No Skill to get a double pip on rank 17 and i should know it as a rank 4 legion
---
Feng or Jeff. Feng has alert and lithe two of the most underrated perks in the game. Jeff has distortion with is an easy way to tell if the killer has BBQ or bitter murmur
---
See, if I live, I get 5000 BP. If I rescue you and die, I get, like, 1500.
---
I am sure this would fit in r/dbdgonewild
---
Nothing I said even implied I own the game lmao
---
Are you trying to suggest that he didn‚Äôt hit you? He countered your 360 by spinning get over it
---
Laurie Bill and Addam
---
Your toxicity implies you do
---
Nothing you can do about people killing themselves on the first hook, if they wanna take the L at least they pulled the trigger instead of the cord. There‚Äôs no way of punishing someone for dying on first hook.
---
DC have been a big issue lately and until dedicated servers come online we are fucked with this mess until then. Then the punishments can be handed out. But on PS4 they have had a big problem with the game just randomly kicking people out the game all the way to the main menu saying no network connection or some other bs like error 8084 I think it is. I get booted 2-4 times a night while playing and it piss‚Äôs me off! My internet connection is wired 100mb up and down and anything else game wise I play works perfect all the time! Many other people have reported the same issues and I was just in a game Saturday night playing scratch mirror Myers and got the boot right as I was fixing to get my last victim, pissed me off and I lost everything and was running a grat cake and BPS!
---
Tbh that's a pretty bad build for Huntress perks wise.
---
What? Lmaooo you‚Äôre thinking too much. It‚Äôs just me joking around I don‚Äôt care if he hits me.
---
The cool thing about the Spirit's add-ons, leaving out her purple ones, her passive phasing ones, is that all of them are almost the same in terms of strength and mostly just are up to personal preference, although the duration ones are a bit weaker. I personally like activation charge time and post-phasing speed.
---
Yes. I repeat. Isn‚Äôt it weird how I made fun of your name out of the blue with no inciting action whatsoever?
---
(See, I‚Äôm hinting at the fact that you randomly made fun of OP‚Äôs meme template source, which was both an absurdly specific thing to make fun of but also sorta unwarranted since he wasn‚Äôt really insulting anyone himself)
---
I‚Äôm not sure tbh. Probably could find it under fantasy villain art keyword search if I had to guess
---
I liked his uniqueness before as well. He's a more viable killer now for sure but even though I hated playing against the old Freddy I thought he was cool
---
Good luck, the higher I get in rank playing solo survivor on PS4 the worse it gets with potato teammates who act like they have never played a single game before but are rank 2-4 and have all the good perks... I can‚Äôt wrap my brain around it and keep thinking these people are paying someone to get them ranked up
---
she prefers to die than leave you alone dont be rude :(
---
If it was network issues they can tell. If you weren‚Äôt actually cheating you won‚Äôt be banned, don‚Äôt worry.
---
"lmao, youre so shit, noooob"

Toxicity in general seems to be a big problem with this game. I just played a game with a swf group. It was my first time trying out Legion (I play the game off and on, currently back on and trying to play more competitively). Literally all they did was teabag. Sit in front of a palette and teabag. They'd run to one of their friends teabag and go in separate directions. Sit at the gate and teabag. And it doesn't particularly bother me especially since it was my first time playing Legion so I'm bound to suck. But that toxicity can turn away a lot of new players and it can most definitely turn people away from wanting to play as killer. It's just obnoxious and childish.
---
Name checks out
---
Who nea? Other side of what?
---
He dced...
---
He's really bad.
---
Windows doesn‚Äôt counter dream pallets that I know of
---
I‚Äôve had a couple killers bring in a mori and they killed me after my second hook because they figured it was too early in the game. God bless
---
Were you the one who made it? This comment wasn‚Äôt directed towards you. Also, it‚Äôs pretty universal that memeatic is a low blow for ‚Äúmeme creators‚Äù. Lastly, I didn‚Äôt make fun of the creator as a person but the platform they used. You, however; vulgarly made fun of my name did you not? I have a feeling you don‚Äôt know what inciting means but oh well, last point wasn‚Äôt too bad though. He didn‚Äôt insult anyone himself, just every single survivor. I will say though that I stated this defines killers, using bad platforms to create memes.
---
At the 16 second mark, was that just a cedit or did she lag over there???
---
If you feel like stalking my profile and siftig through old posts, do you.
---
I wouldn't worry about it. Sony probably gets tons of reports for DBD and I doubt they even look at them. With the game being P2P lag happens.
---
In fact they may get banned themselves for the language lol.
---
1. Watch otzdarva play trapper (he‚Äôs good and explains everything he does)
---
2. Stay away from the standard spots, like the window in killer shack. Instead put a trap in the grass in between the window and one of the doors. 
---
3. Don‚Äôt put a trap in the center of a pallet because they can cover the trap with a pallet, place it on either side 
---
4 Double trapping areas works well. One gets trapped, someone runs up to help and steps in second
---
3,4 beg for more

I use Stridor because there are a lot of iron will users. As far as the headset I don't know. I use 30 dollar PS4 headset and it works fine.
---
Not anymore
---
Do you use any settings about sounds ingame ?
---
PS4 doesn't really have too many settings. I have sounds turned up to full but that's all we can do.
---
Wraith is easy. Just take a picture of an empty room and just say your cloaked.
---
Toxic players don‚Äôt bother me at all but when I see people being toxic when I‚Äôm the killer I have no problem camping at hooks, watching them die then reading their salt in game chat after.
---
The problem is that she uses he platform and popularity to promote toxicity to thousands of daily viewers. And she's also paid to bully killers so... of course, she also is just giving people what they want. People tune into her specifically because they enjoy her and her swf made of adult children.
---
Solo: bond + kindred + (any exhaust) + spine chill
---
Team: adrenaline + iron will + DS + Borrowed Time
---
10/10 did blow air out of my nose with force.
---
I just posted a picture (that has since been removed due to salty post-game chat) of someone accusing me of cheating because of the servers being off. I guess we just have to wait for dedicates servers, which BHVR said would come by the end of summer
---
Lmao so much yikes. Using ‚Äúmeme creators‚Äù like it‚Äôs a official title, immediate contradicting yourself‚Äî by your logic, I didn‚Äôt insult you as a person, I insulted your username‚Äî assuming the BS ‚Äòsurvivor rules‚Äô are agreed on by all of us instead of whiny toxic players like you, that whole thing was a mess. I hope your day gets better
---
It sucks from a survivor point of view but you're not wrong. I'm a survivor main who has dabbled in killer for the adept trophies and dailies but sometimes it makes sense to go for the injured person. But generally I try to go for the rescuer and make the game a little longer/more blood points for everyone
---
Don‚Äôt want to come off as a dick but just take it as a lost people suck. If you report nothing will happen that‚Äôs the sad truth of DBD next time just pull the plug or shut your WiFi off. It happens
---
No
---
We're you playing on Xbox? My brother and I had a Bubba that wiped us all out in under three minutes. Not even kidding, it was stunning to watch.
---
No I play PS4.
---
I rugby it‚Äôs fine how it is
---
compare america to europe.
---
Everyone should be able to see that guns are the Problem lol
---
What you aren't thinking about is that some people actually do enjoy playing the high tier killers (although nurse doesn't seem that appealing) and they want to have as much of a chance as swf squds. You'll almost never see someone play leatherface very well against a 4 man swf group at red ranks because it's difficult to even pull off with how weak he is. Even if people do enjoy other killers more, they really don't like dealing with toxic survivors that they can't do anything against with a bad killer. If you want to see other killers, you're gonna have to drop your rank because asking people to play bad killers at high ranks is like asking people to not do gens because it's "boring"
---
Why do they remove screenshots from salty post-game chats? They should punish people for being salty with a chat ban lmao.
---
Rng is fine yea
---
F
---
People are trying to look for a scape goat and not accepting reality ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's not a power move, that's just a tactical fuck up
---
Whiney toxic survivors? It said survivors for starters, so can I make some stupid template meme and assume all killers are bs campers and expect every killer to be ok with that? I never used ‚ÄúMeme Creator‚Äù as an official title, kinda like your ‚ÄúWhiney Toxic Survivor‚Äù title you got going there. And I emphasized multiple times that you insulted my Username, do thanks for agreeing.
---
Ok but why do all these perks actually seem really decent? Only You Better Work seems op
---
doing this is my favorite because you can only imagine what the survivor who saw you leave them for dead is thinking
---
Noo

I may not know what ‚Äúinciting‚Äù means but golly oh gosh can I identify projection
---
Wait you changed the color of the ‚Äúmade with mematic so people would know you used mematic?
---
I would say glamazon is a bad idea, it‚Äôs not that original and it would make iron grasp necessary for every killer, 20% is too much make it like 10% max. The extra stun time is also unnecessary imo. There‚Äôs also other perks that already affect wiggling in a less powerful way aka boil over, flip flop. The first perk is an amazing idea though. The third perk is also very unique, doesn‚Äôt seem that useful but is pretty good nonetheless.
---
I was confused at first, I would love a theatre mode if that what youre implying, infinite uses for me trying to edit vids for my 30 subs lol

That was a good response, godspeed you... Person.

BBQ ruin nurses calling are highly recommended

Power: Lord of the Locker
---
Allows Dwight he ability to enter lockers. When in a loxker, the red stain and terror radius are removed. Survivors who enter dwights locker are put into the dying state. Dwight can activate a surprise attack to quickly exit the locker and damage any survivor I'm his path.
---
Allows for the ability to curse lockers. Cursed lockers that contain survivor emit an aura when within the kilelrs radius. Dwight can activate lord of the Locker to lock all cursed lockers, preventing survivors from entering/exiting for a limited time with a cool down between uses.
---
Perks:
---
- Socially Invisible
---
You have developed the ability to remain unseen when in eyeshot
---
When a survivor is looking at you, they cannot perceive the red stain, and they hear the terror radius as though it were 15/25/35% smaller
---
"I was in work on Thursday, one of the guys can vouch for me. Guys?" - Dwight
---
- Hatchet Head
---
The countless hours youve spent in lockers, polishing the huntresses hatchets have paid off, they are so shiny they act as mirrors
---
Hear an audio cue when a survivor is standing directly behind you and not behind cover when within 8/10/12 metres
---
"You finished cleaning my tools" - huntress 
---
- Fight Back
---
Youve a thing or two about how to deal with bullies
---
Windows and undropped pallets are temporarily blocked off by the entity when a survivor stands within 4/6/8 metres to them for 12/10/8 seconds
---
"I'm telling the entity you're looping" - Dwight
---
Guns are a part of it yes...but not the reason, it is also the person behind it. And it‚Äôs not just a ‚ÄòEurope‚Äô thing...it‚Äôs a cultural thing and America alone has a pretty aggressive culture, I mean if you really want to compare other countries then sure at least Asians have the decency to kill themselves in a forest isolated from society not scarring any passerby‚Äôs on their way to work.
---
The conversation starts at the table with friends and family about not just guns but what we contribute as a society to each other.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that (I‚Äôm not long on this reddit, after DbD got in the game pass). But they still should taking actions against salty people.
---
Jeez that‚Äôs lit
---
.......why does this turn me on?
---
what about my main man trapper?!!?!?!
---
Maybe there's a reason why they changed it.
---
No actually I was searching through controversial posts
---
Yeah sure. Because being blown up, burned to death, thrown off roofs, stabbed, run over or aircraft are all great alternatives right. Right?
---
It doesn't matter where you go in the world or what someone uses. If they want to kill you or kill a bunch of people they're going to find a way to do it and they will do it. The cause of the problem isn't the tool they choose to use. The cause of the problem is the person themselves. But sure, blame the tool if it helps you feel better.
---
Yeah, Europe just uses trucks and knives
---
&gt;When I play killer I have to try to win and when I play survivor I have to try to win
---
So your complaint is that the other team is playing the game instead of letting you win?
---
Come and find me survivors. I'm going to kill you all.
---
I would‚Äôve laughed. On one hand, if he‚Äôs not being serious, you get a good laugh out of it. On the other hand, those are the bests insults the guy could come up with, and warrants a laugh as well.
---
Quite often they don't repair or rescue, they just stand there waiting for the kilelr to leave. If they repair is convinces killers to not camp.(also why you shoulnt quit game) and there's no way to unhook camping leatherface
---
No... ITS A TRAP AND AN ASSET PART OF THE GAME
---
oh whoops sorry
---
All good
---
r/dbdgonegay you mean?
---
Getting better is not mutually exclusive with getting frustrated. 
---
You can get a group with no intention of even doing generators. While packing flashlights and taking turns helping each other repeatedly running a long loop. At some point it's just not worth it.
---
for cheating and it was a joke obviously
---
Dwight be an absolute unit
---
He is the worst killer in the game. The only thing good about his ability is it makes him the best camper as he can insta down all three survivors making the rescue
---
You protect your friends to your own detriment. Gain a stackable 25% bloodpoint bonus for every safe unhook up to a maximum of 100% awarded post trial. A survivor successfully escaping the killer and mending causes the broken status effect on the rescuer for 40/30/20 seconds. Pretty balanced I‚Äôd say.
---
It's called GRUBL. You get 3 keys for the paid ones but a bunch are free. You can get the nurse free with a key. Scroll to the bottom of the 4d ones to find it.
---
That's why I leave the second last survivor unhooked, it forces the hatch camper to come out of hiding
---
Well, you could only use it once per match, but for those gates are open sort of hook rescues it could be really infuriating.
---
There are only 6 Exhaustion perks, 4 team based aura reading perks, 5 stealth perks, 5 hook-based rescue perks, and Self-care.
---
This totals to exactly 16 perks that could be ran instead of Iron Will.
---
Exhaustion: Sprint Burst, Lithe, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Head On, Adrenaline. Of these 6, Head On and Sprint Burst are unusable by most players. This leaves 4 perks from the Exhaustion category.
---
Team-based aura reading: Bond, Empathy, Aftercare,  and Wake Up. No one runs Wake Up unless it's bugged, Aftercare and Empathy are almost never ran, leaving Bond as the defacto aura perk. This leaves 1, *maybe* 2 aura reading perks.
---
Stealth: Urban Evasion, Spine Chill, Quick and Quiet, Distortion. Urban Evasion and Spine Chill have a niche spot locked in with immersed players and people who hate Ghostface. Distortion and Quick and Quiet are usually only ran in gimmick builds. This leaves 2 stealth perks.
---
Hook-rescue: BT, We'll Make It, DS, Deliverance, and WGLF. BT and DS are reserved for campers/tunnelers, so they're in every game. We'll Make It is a medic perk so it's only ran for memes, unfortunately. Deliverance is ran by diehard solo survivors, and WGLF is a farm perk with no real benefit. This means that only 2 perks are ran in the hook-rescue category.
---
Self-care is pretty much always ran until you get to higher ranks where people have teammates who are actually helpful.
---
4 Exhaustion perks, 2 aura perks, 2 stealth perks, 2 hook-rescue perks, and Self-care. That's 11 perks other than Iron Will. Maximum. Please run it and stop saying there are better perks while crying over Spirit being op. Unless you are facing Ghostface without Spine Chill, you won't be sacrificing anything too special.

Did anyone have a map?  The add-on that lets everyone see the aura of the map might have been used by another survivor. The color is brighter orange than the generators and hooks so they stand out a bit more.
---
I always figure if people have lights then theyll use them on pallets or wherever. I dont get salty at people for things i know i would do if i was them. I actually went up against a party of three claudettes with very rare flashlights and we all had a laugh after cuz they beat the snot out of me

This is really good! How long did it take? I love all the details. Also the facial expression is perfect!
---
Spirit should not be this cute!
---
Lmao you'd say yes if it was only in survivors favor
---
At what point does doing gens turn into gen rushing
---
I say this as someone who plays both sides, killer &amp; survivor, take off NOED. Not only is it a cheap and unfun perk for the survivors, but it also robs you from properly learning how to play the killer. It's a crutch and you'll just become reliant on it to win. I recommend using basically any other perk beside NOED. Use a perk that'll help you win before getting to endgame, not a crutch that gives you a cheap victory if the match gets to endgame. 
---
For Wraith Play with Your Food, Sloppy Butcher, A Nurse's Calling, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Make Your Choice are all solid perks for him.
---
I play mostly killer. But thanks for trying.
---
Katya's perk: you get the bp for escaping if you die and vice versa lmao
---
Need one called "Sing for your life" and another called "Don't fuck it up!"
---
How you actually "ACTUALLY" communicate: 
---
"Ok killer is &lt;X&gt;"
---
"He's chasing me"
---
"He is/isn't camping me"
---
"They're running X,Y,Z perk/add-on"
---
Simple statements that give your team an advantage yet for whatever reasons SWF groups constantly downplay this.
---
You already won, SWF is a permanent feature of DbD and isn't going anywhere. It wouldn't be half as infuriating though if the people who use it just owned up to the advantages it gives.
---
This isn't very common from what I've seen.

It's just that DbD is my most played game ever, I spent so much time with it and it was all worth it - I guess it holds a special place in my heart. I miss the fun I had with it not too long ago, but these days it's become kinda stale.
---
I often try to meme around a bit with the survivors or killers just to lighten the mood, but some trials aren't really meant to be fun, I guess.
---
You're right about the break, I should probably leave DbD be for a longer period of time than just a few days. I'm just a bit addicted to it and I love new content, so it requires some mental strength lol

Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty shit argument. No one with a knife is going to kill 22 people, or injure over 500 like the shooting in Vegas.

Dude has been getting sniped for 2+ weeks by some toxic pair of survivors who try to sandbag him or bring counter builds. 
---
E.g Iron will if he plays spirit,Flashlight if hag,etc.
---
All while t-bagging and saying stuff like "Why are you sniping me tru3? Its ruining my game and thats reportable"
---
It'd ruin my mood too.
---
well I only had 2 offerings that boosted my bps but holy crap 190k is a lot
---
Bugged. I‚Äôve had matches as killer where I couldn‚Äôt see the auras of generators so good job behavior. I love your game and you did a pretty good job so far but damn it‚Äôs buggy sometimes.
---
old Prestige rewards
---
Brake and break are two different words.  Common misspelling.
---
would be shocking if europe could even afford food, let alone guns lol
---
So, no longer available?
---
Thank you! üëª
---
last one is broken lol
---
ye, busy having free Health care, free University and no big racism gap in our society
---
Yeah. The match I had was a survivor pudding,BBQ, and a couple streamers.
---
best spend it now, after a rank reset any points like this get reset back to zero as an anti-cheat method. spend it quick!
---
busy not eating either
---
Aha her sad and vulnerable look may be cute, but her in game noises are just another level of weird üòÇ
---
yup
---
I mean even as killer I try not to tunnel but yeah some survivors exaggerate what is tunneling I‚Äôve done it myself if I‚Äôm honest
---
no no, eating the right amount to not have severely obese children.
---
But it must look like starving from your perspective
---
rule 8
---
Camping no but I guess if you teleport and see both there and you decide to go for the one who just got off the hook then I guess it‚Äôs tunneling but if you don‚Äôt see the other guy there really is not much you can do
---
That first paragraph is just relating what (s)he said but longer just saying...
---
Thank you!! I wanted the sad/vulnerable side rather than angry/vengeful. I think this took about 6-7 hours? I streamed it on twitch doing small streams across three days.
---
Oops
---
is that what you call being anorexic and dying on the street like the zombies from 28 days later
---
I thought my 60k was a lot
---
We should just have an event where all the killers participate in RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race.
---
Meta: Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Balanced Landing, Decisive Strike.
---
Non-Meta: Balanced Landing, Bond, Kindred, Open Handed.
---
Tbh as crutch as it can be I think what NOED needs is just the removal of the speed buff.  
---
Really cool concept though I like it. Probably would be fitting seeing as how they castrated so many good survivor perks.
---
It's the app GRUBL if anyone wants it.
---
He's the same kind of person who sends the angry harassing messages postgame but tells anybody disawoing it to "Just ignore it" "stop bitching" "get thicker skin" "Just deal with it" "You just suck, git gud", anytime you point out survivors being toxic on this subreddit you're gonna get guys like him who cant take criticism thats not even directed at them
---
honestly surprised what you're talking about, in a country where no one has to be homeless, unless by choice
---
Man calling out the survivor stuff wasn‚Äôt bad but when you started with the camping stuff that‚Äôs why you got downvoted. Most of the ‚Äúcampers‚Äù you see are just staying because you‚Äôre team won‚Äôt wait till the killer leaves to go for the save, I play both sides btw. There are campers like the ones you‚Äôre complaining about but majority of players don‚Äôt do that.
---
I sort of bought the pig as my fun-but-meh killer, and while I don't disagree with you, I don't have enough money at the moment to buy all the DLCs, so I'm picking up the ones with strong killers or perks first.
---
Not that I want to boost rank, necessarily. Anything above 15 seems so dreadfully toxic, lol.
---
Sometimes when other survivors flashlight hag traps to disable them, they illuminate for everyone and they all light up too. I thought they fixed that a while back but who knows at this point.
---
When they try so hard to be like them and fail it always results in post game harassment, hell even if they barely make it out alive with a hatch escape they'll try to gloat about it
---
Legion is fun and fair now...just get some good perks on him, discordance is his only main perk I use buuuut he's alright
---
Killer perks are naturally meant to be stronger than survivor perks. Considering it's going to be 4 perks versus 16 perks. 
---
Killers also have a higher cost of entry per match, because very few feel solid to play with no add-ons so each one essentially has a 'ticket' of 3k+ BP to play with. And while not so much an issue anymore thanks to the EGC, the Killer has to stay for the entire round. 
---
Survivors meanwhile can go into a trial empty-handed and walk out with items effectively netting bonus BP. They also get quicker queues times (mostly) and get to move onto a new game quicker if they die.
---
Killers earn more BP per match, but survivors earn more BP per minute. 
---
I'm okay with BHVR tweaking scoring events to make stuff like Survival more easy to obtain, but there's no need to buff WGLF when it does what it's supposed to and does it well.
---
she lookin kinda fresh doe üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
that is so awesome. I played a huntress once where we could see each other but we were SUPER far apart and I was going in for the rescue and they NAILED me lol. I messaged the killer after and was like NICE SHOT! and then they were my killer again later too, they were great. I love killers like that, totally fun.
---
Spirit is zero from borderlands 2
---
For real? That's harsh, fair (because you are breaking a very touchy rule) but harsh, is it a permanent ban?
---
I don't think most survivor mains understand exactly how much the killer uses sound clues and that survivor groans are directional.
---
If they did I suspect the perk would get more use.
---
This is both amazing and terrifying

Yes, you will absolutely want to rebind killer turning to Q &amp; E. You can still encounter the issue if you move your mouse during that brief window of sensitivity, but once you start using your keyboard to turn  during his chainsaw you'll find it happens almost never.
---
Well I hope you learnt the lesson bro -- don't get triggered. üòÇ
---
Truth be told i was in a discord call with a friend of mine, we sometimes take turns playing killer and share our screen.
---
If i was by myself i probably would‚Äôve screamed in disbelief.
---
I feel you bro
---
Removed - Uncivil behaviour
---
I mean sure, you get to max out on points from chasing and maybe hitting, but you probably won't get anything else other than that. 
---
At least until they get bored from trolling you. You can't even end the game because they won't do generators.

When is Punk Kate coming? I have a NEED

Not sure why, but i tend to play better with yellow mori than green. Something about enjoying the last kill. I main wraith for it and im only lvl 21 no prestige
---
Congrats! I'm a pip or two away from rank 4.
---
*mushroom cloud intensifies*
---
I just use their power to get from Gen to Gen. If I see someone on the way I'll stab them but mainly for pressure now that they chase normal speed.
---
third seal (for slugging reasons), ruin, infectious fright (way easier to find survivors in tier III as ur tr is massive) and discordance for the early game stalk
---
Not if you have insidious
---
In the 2nd scenario did they both end up getting caught? Lol
---
sadly my hag is level 1
---
Bbq for bloodpoints and ruin because at red ranks you literally will not win without it, unless you're nurse, spirit, billy, or the survivors are absolute dogshit. *Adrenaline, dead hard, decisive, and borrowed, now you're just like every survivor ever*. C'mon dude.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.

I don't get it?
---
Dealt with way too many DCs while playing as the nurse on console
---
Most of the community agrees with you. Devs said they‚Äôre working on this issue for when dedicated servers come out, but who knows when that‚Äôll be
---
I really don't like this common idea of "toxic swf every game - 0 kills every game with a lower tier killer". That's not true! How many toxic swf's are there really? Not that many! How many professional, "god-like" survivors are there? Not that many! Hell, I'm in red ranks and I'm an average player, I'm sure I'm not the only one! I've seen other killers than the top 3 dominate the game - it's rare but it happens and those are the fun games! Because they usually last longer, the chases are engaging and watching a lower tier killer use their power effectively is super awesome, I gladly die to that! And they mostly play VERY fair, even if that means they might not get too many kills. But you can tell, they have fun! And then you go against a Spirit who tries as hard as they can to ruin everyones game and dominate completely, just to put you in your place 'cause SOMEDAY a "toxic swf" wrecked them and now EVERYONE has to pay for that.
---
That's the mentality I get from that.
---
It's like an endless circle: killer gets bullied by toxic people - plays top tier killer next and wrecks normal survivors - normal survivors are upset and "gen-rush" next game - killer gets upset and plays top tier killer - ...... and so on.
---
Why can't people just keep calm? You had a bad game, it was frustrating, yes, but why is merciless revenge the only answer? Why not move on and improve your skills with a low tier killer? Why not be satisfied with the fact that you did all you could and you did good, even though everyone escaped? Why is complete dominance "the only real success"?
---
I'm really upset about this common mindset, but it roots so deep in the game, the ranking system, the overall balance - I guess it'll never really change.
---
then level her up, she has 3 really good perks and ruin is almost a must have. also really fun to play and a strong killer
---
* Common image repost.
---
Yeah I saw that but like I'm honestly tempted to stop playing survivor until dedicated severs come out because of this.
---
I'm pretty sure you need to double pip in order to get adepts.
---
While 90% of this is survivors doing it, there are some annoying entitled killers who do the same thing postgame
---
I get obsessed with one side for a couple weeks then switch.  That said, about 50-50 overall.  
---
  
---
~~seriously though fuck that ghostface daily its the only one I struggle with~~
---
üëèüèªüëèüèª Love it. A friend of mine joking said you should be able to open the hatch even if the killer closes it, BUT you get a super hard skill check. I like yours a lot more.
---
Man getting a drag queen would be so fucking cool. Imagine all the outfits you can come up with.
---
No bbq? And NOED on insta-down huntress?
---
So, ¬´¬†as a rank 4 Legion¬†¬ª, you are now a reference? 
---
It‚Äôs just a game: no need to take it so seriously.
---
I understand why Ghostface didn't get a survivor.  
---
We've had Dewey all along! ~~seriously though give me Randy BHVR &gt;:(~~
---
Oh yeah, trashcan perk for her (at least with iri's and mori), NOED isn't super necessary either. I'd probably run overcharge and pop slow the game to a grind.
---
Just play killer for a month and grind BP.  Dedicateds should be out by september.
---
Yknow for all this games challenges, external and internal, can we give the devs some love for taking on such a large a difficult task? Evolve crumbled under the weight of 1v4, this game has gone strong for SO long. I love it, and im sure you all do too! Thank you DbD team!
---
Reminds me of the Batman 90's animated TV style. Nice.

lightning strike, so i guess it would've made more sense to say when a hex totem gets cleansed

Imagine Rupaul as a killer! I would love to hear his laugh when hitting a survivor.
---
On xbox it tells me that the cap is one million
---
nah this is pretty accurate tbh.  just suprised me haha
---
Are you plating on pc or ps4
---
I'm on PS4 bro
---
It says the same on pc.
---
If the killer is super boosted sometimes this is more fun than anything.
---
Then I have no idea how to help, sorry.
---
Distressing+unnerving presence+bbq+pop= the most evil 3 Gen huntress build.
---
NGL after a while you'll grow to despise the red ranks, but love it at the same time...
---
I dont have bbq for huntress, time to farm
---
On Xbox specifically, your reports work on an average of players met/reports earned.
---
Meaning if you play mainly DbD you meet roughly 4 players every 20ish minutes an if 1 of them an hour reports you, that end estimate is strongly biased. 
---
Plus DbD being one of those games where people report you for winning...
---
It's really easy to get a ban or restricted matchmaking.
---
To offset this, play a game like Apex or Fortnite, any game where there's a shitload of players per match, an in a handful of games you'll fix your "reputation" real fast. 
---
You don't even have to play, just land an wander about til you die.
---
This won't happen so much for your communication ban as that's a per case basis an if they screenshot you using a single curse word they have all they need to slap that ban on you. 
---
My advice for this circumstance is to either ignore them or learn to insult people without using "inappropriate" language. 
---
Call people hun or sweetheart, something like that. Kill them with kindness or trolling kindness. Something you can't get reported for, however, don't keep msging them casue then you fall into the "harassment" portion of the report system.
---
Good luck in the future
---
I know that some people would say enduring instead of brutal, but I agree with you as enduring isn't as useful imo without spririt fury. Brutal is pretty much a simpler spirit fury + enduring imo.
---
Awesome work, I love it! I think your colors are spot on. Would love to see one of her doing her mad face/stance!
---
There's PS buttons on screen so...
---
I don't know how blinding will work when he already has light coming out of his face part of the helmet.
---
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs really strong against low rank survivors, but doctor exists. And legion. And Myers. And Freddy. And Plague.
---
Plus she‚Äôs not very strong against low rank survivors.
---
There‚Äôs literally no reason to nerf her.
---
Ao he suffered from freddd syndrome too...
---
Damn...
---
How does a Killer that thrives at high rank get shit on by low rank survivors...I'd say correct it so she doesnt struggle in either unless you cant play her.
---
The only version on PS4 is the special edition
---
IIRC, they were tested on the PBE a bit ago, but because of general lack of increase in performance, they decided to hold on before releasing them for real
---
Agreed. I see LF's do fine. Aoe Chainsaw isn't that bad.
---
Probably Nintendo Ds
---
Its a bug with animations. If a killer is already stunned/disabled by something, you can't re-stun them. In this scenario, the Nurse was still in her fatigue animation (albeit right at the end of it)
---
r/suicidebywords
---
As I‚Äôve said, my issue was I wanted the game *to end*. I didn‚Äôt want to have to pull the plug just for that.
---
The real counterpoint to that is just *yikes*. There's no point in arguing with someone so delusional
---
Get a group. Playing with randoms is like playing russian roulette.
---
Wraith mains being targeted with the anxiety of a lack of bing-bonging. I feel targeted
---
I recommend trying to 99 survivors first. Then when you go for the down sneak up beside them and tap stalk to expose. They can't escape and it's a free hit
---
ohhh okay thank you
---
makes sense ty!!
---
I would say some of it has to do with why you didn't show your build
---
Well I've already had plenty of those unfortunately, even in a relatively short while of playing (and playing pig and wraith, lol).
---
Yeah, that's what I was going to try to do, but they kept breaking me out before I even saw them.  I've always been good at stealth things too, so I guess spine chill has just been screwing me over :/
---
Billy's not an easy killer to play, but he hes good and the survivors arent running like full gen rush sets he will win... hell billy already gets a 4k on cornfield any other map he struggles... if you dont want maps to be a deciding factor in matches than play a different game cause that's just the way it is.
---
I would gladly get down on my knees for Trapper. Maybe he‚Äôll even let me live.
---
This game for some reason appeals to LGBT+ people. Just like horror in general.
---
Don‚Äôt forget your size 20 shoes on the way out. ü§°
---
Survivors hate pig too, haha, but that doesnt stop me, she's my favorite franchise of the killers available, so she will be P3 one day!
---
Thank you! I'm glad someone appreciates this post.
---
Do gens with team mates. Team work as well as being altruistic is your best way.
---
You‚Äôre not the jerk for doing it, I think most survivors are just annoyed that for some reason, the person they unhook runs away instead of crouch walking away.
---
That‚Äôs not how it should be but that‚Äôs how it is. I‚Äôm just saying when this game gets it shit together, all killers should have ~ same potential for 2k-3k on any map against survivors of near or equal skill.
---
Drag is a myriad of things but not what you‚Äôre thinking. I suggest opening up your views on people and actually reading up on what you‚Äôre hating instead of spewing ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.
---
"think" ?
---
third perk could pair well with dying light
---
jeff could blast you with waves of pure righteous metal
---
Infectious Fright + M&amp;A + BBQ + Iron Maiden.
---
Feral frenzy attacks slow the team down as they need to heal, when you hit someone in frenzy you can see other players in the area, used properly he is a good killer and a pain in the backside to go against. 
---
Saying that I don't play him much.
---
didnt mean to leave it out, its nurses calling, bitter murmur, blood warden, whispers... dont have bbq or ruin yet
---
Yeah but it's a scam
---
nope
---
This game will probably never be scary unless they make the killers actually op, which would be stupid. Yes killers are supposed to kill and they should have ways to prevent surviving to an extent. 4ks should only happen if the killer is obviously more skilled than the survivors. Never should they passively get 4ks just cause they got lucky with map choice.
---
I ran it for a while until i got the adept achievement. It's not a bad perk, but usually there are better choices.
---
I generally hate playing against hag because of this and I know the feel because I play alot do killer as well. my general rule as hag is don't tunnel the unhooked survivor. my trap allows me to hit the guy that unhooked just as easily as I could tunnel. but tunneling isn't fun for anyone so I avoid doing it. the person on hook shouldn't be killed because their teammate doesn't know how to crouch
---
yeeees :)
---
At ur rank Ruin is almost mandatory, if you don't you're just asking to get gen rushed. Replace shadowborn
---
It's not a scam lol. It's free with no ads or pop-ups. I also posted what it looks like on another post.
---
If survivor queues would be better I would 100% be a survivor main. I like survivor better but si‚Äôm sometimes forced to play killer because at least I get to play and not simulate a lobby
---
Unfortimatly the one without a chainsaw. I did have the sledge and the very often overlooked bracelet tho
---
But they do, and there not possible way to prevent map rng...  so accept it.
---
Escape should be borderline sweat difficult for survivors, and I mean sweat... if they escape they've barely escaped... they've had to make choices between team mate lives and their own... unfortunately survivors practically waltz out if anyone dare play an off meta killer...
---
Ah, unlucky then. Like others have said, the lore of the game means that you have to do more than just kill. On both sides too, like there's usually no way to pip as survivor if the killer doesn't get hooks or plays really badly. This is why I've never understood the us vs them mentality in the DBD community because both sides need the other to have fun and play the game how it's intended to be played. It's all about emblems, just try and do what each category wants you to do and you should pip, at least until red ranks then it's just a total disaster
---
That would be it in an ideal world...
---
That's EXACTLY the reaction you get when you just wanna talk about fun and fair gameplay on both sides!
---
It's always about dominance and destroying your opponent, not about an engaging trial that everyone benefits from!
---
Should get removed right along with insta heals
---
For Beacon of Hope, what I meant is at tier 1, you have a minimum range of 4 meters and a maximum of 12, at tier 2 the minimum is 8 and maximum is 24, and at tier 3 the minimum is 12 and maximum 36.
---
Reddit won't let me edit that last part, and as such, I'm writing it here.
---
People downvoting you but is not uncommon. Csn confirm as a yellow rank killer.
---
Ghostface is weaker than Myers.
---
Ambitious idea ill give you that
---
Legion is a solid mid-tier killer. They're good at slowing the game down with their power Feral Frenzy by keeping everyone injuried and thus healing, and it's also good for gathering intel as it tells you about where other nearby survivors are when you stab someone. Sloppy Butcher, Save the Best for Last, A Nurse's Calling, and Thanatophobia are solid perks for Legion.
---
There's zero harm in DC'ing
---
More like rank 10 killer, it goes right in the middle, I hate people who do this on purpose so they get lower ranks killers
---
To be fair, most people i talk to only use moris for dailies or when they see a toxic swf. And in higher ranks, a single heal with insta can extend the game time a ton, making it much harder to end a chase, and if you aren't tryharding and playing Nurse, Spirit, or Billy, not ending a chase as quickly as one should end is really rough to come back from. Not to mention popular perks like borrowed time can stop you from getting downed again and morid, and survivors already have so many perks that can extend a chase, like Dead Hard, Lithe, Sprint Burst, and Balanced Landing. The game would be much better off without ebony and insta.
---
ok
---
always the David with borrowed time
---
You're so cool.
---
Mass murders happen because guns are too easy to attain in America. Yes the individual is ultimately the one to blame but you can't deny that taking away the guns will help the situation.
---
Well, then it seems like NOED doesn't need a rework, I'm glad I could open your eyes.
---
I'm not saying this specifically to disagree with you (I do on some things, then agree on others), but you don't decide for others what is fun.
---
*You* (and a lot of others, absolutely) think a killer only caring about kills and not meme-ing is "sweaty" and not fun. There are a lot of people who just want to play the game. Like, do you call people tryhard or sweats or unfun when they aim as good as they can and kill everyone they can in a shooter? Probably not. 
---
Not everyone finds meme-ing around or playing "bad on purpose" (I'm not sure how to describe it, but I don't mean this as an insult, nor do I mean throwing/deranking) fun or entertaining.
---
Get weird every night my dude. This is a gift
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been said if it‚Äôs been done by RNG. If it is, then technically any teachable could have a chance to never be shown, unless they make it so that each perk which hasn‚Äôt been shown has a higher chance of showing (which I doubt).
---
I always play as Pizza Dwight
---
Why the fuck are u being down voted bc if you‚Äôre opinions it does suck that bc people are shit at the game and u killed them fast that u don‚Äôt pip idk why anyone who killed all four players regardless of how fast wouldn‚Äôt pip this is why I hate reddit little ass kids that get mad bc they don‚Äôt agree with u downvote everything u post just so U can‚Äôt post lol this will probs get downvoted to ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
But in the end I agree u should pip for 4ks and survivors should at least always stay neutral if they escape they a door bc I‚Äôve done gems and then all 4 teammates escape thru the door but bc I wasn‚Äôt getting chased the whole game I de pip or stay neutral depending on what rank u are
---
We at McDonald's like
---
I never take them in my bloodweb unless I have to. It‚Äôs just not fun. I‚Äôll just play a fair game and get 30k + bonusses

Upvote for originality, effort, and no legion cosplays.

i do that so i can work on gens and  hit skillchecks while using one hand and browse my phone with the other, most ppl probs wont think thats what im doing tho, especially against shirtless david
---
It looks like actual effort went into this, and you didn't just copy every 13 year old on tik tok and run with legion.  Take my well deserved upvote.
---
I use BBQ, Ruin, M&amp;A and Infectious Fright.
---
Unfortunately, their fix is to just punish DC's rather than focusing on the 4 other people in that game that are effected by the DC's. Killer DC'ing is even worse; if it's early in the game, then everyone loses a pip
---
Ooh nice, never thought it would have use (with other killers rather than myers I mean)
---
God the cringe at all of you...
---
Nah, I'm willing to acknowledge that. The top items for killer and survivor are OP. I don't play killer btw so I take their word for it
---
They aren't scary, just annoying.
---
Is that a giant ass mushroom?
---
It is a lot yes. You‚Äôll get even (way) more in double bo events because there‚Äôs standard 2xBP + people will bring more BPS
---
It's not exactly OP- just moves the goalposts so far that it should be a different game mode
---
For a sec i thinked its real

Feels good man. I‚Äôve been playing for 6 months and i‚Äôve only made it to rank either 5 or 4. To be fair though, i never really played video games before this and only got into it bc of a friend.
---
It's like people have conveniently forgotten that the original LF got looped for 5 straight minutes by a girl. A screaming, flailing girl at that.
---
What chance does he have against stronger personalities like Meg and Nea?
---
Nah, his portrayal in the game is accurate.
---
Imo Legion is just a bad Plague
---
My dude, when did I shame people for playing properly? You misunderstood completely!
---
4k-ing isn't toxic, playing optimal isn't toxic, "gen-rushing", playing in an swf, meta perks, looping, not going with the memes ... not toxic! Tea-bags, flashlight clicking, post game chat mocking, obvious off-hook tunneling at the start of the game without a good reason other than to get you out of the game immediately, face camping, sandbagging, holding the game hostage - toxic!
---
Also, when I talk about memes, I mean some occassional fun banter with your fellow players, like crouching in a circle with other survivors and nodding at each other for a while, pointing and staring at someone if they missed a skill check, crouching close in front the killer and staring at them if some weird hitbox shit happened or something like that, sitting down at the fireplace in Ormond when the killer comes and maybe they'll join for some seconds - I did all that and they either went along or not! Both perfectly fine! You wanna play without memes? That's fine! You wanna slug the second last person to get the last one and 4k? That's fine! You wanna use the strongest add-ons or items? That's fine!
---
All I ask is to at least consider the fun of other people in your playstyle! Don't be an egoistic dick and ruin people's games on purpose!
---
If you're just a really good player, I acknowledge that and I applaud you - I gladly die to someone like that!
---
But it's not fun to go against someone who just goes into trials to fuck you and your day up with whatever they have at hands! Just for the sake of it!
---
I hope this makes my opinion clear, so it doesn't get twisted like that again!
---
Ngl, this really upset me!
---
Lol they love to blame everything but the real problem for violence. Even worse is that Donald Trump blames video games as the issue too recently.
---
I'm trying to believe that it was bug but the killer wasn't really doing good that game so they could've done it out of spite but I'm not really sure tbh.
---
Loving it thus far
---
This game still has hardcore clipping, wonky hair physics, unspecific hand gestures for actions, and the characters have the most aloof faces when hanging impaled by a hook.
---
Even if this did exist the quality wouldn't be that much different from how it looks now.
---
Really? What rank are you
---
And?
---
Offtopic, but I never understood why they kept the idea of flashlights being a counter to The Wraith. It's not like flashlights aren't any popular and he's not the worst killer already or anything..
---

---
I think instaheals and Moris should be allowed. You rarely  see both used a lot unless you're unlucky. It's not like you'll play against both multiple games in a row unless you have TTV in your name or your an obvious 4man
---
This image is creepy dude.
---
That's awesome! Just to let you know about rank 10 is when it gets challenging.
---
Not really comparable. The best toolbox increases repair speed by 25% while moris decrease #of downs needed by 33%, and #of hooks needed by 66%
---
God I can‚Äôt wait for DC punishments, I don‚Äôt know why they haven‚Äôt been implemented already even without dedicated servers.
---
Survivor DC? Makes the game extremely difficult for other survivors and shorts the killer on bloodpoints (even worse If they DC while being carried to last hook, why even do that what‚Äôs wrong with you asshole)
---
Killer DC? Ruins the game for literally everyone in the lobby
---
Darn so... are all my iridescent badges gonna go away?
---
True the first kill from Bubba was more of a Jumpscare for Bubba, then a chase :D
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is is that it‚Äôs bad if Killers have fun and do good? I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say
---
No.
---
Yeah, a killer can deal with 1 person at a time, maybe 2 if he's lucky. There are 4 survivors, you do the math.
---
Ps4
---
I agree. I just think if killers are going to constantly whine that survivors get a free hit, then it needs to go both ways. But nah, they're cool with all their instant downing moves and items, and ebony moris, but can't stand it when survivors do the same.
---
It‚Äôs 50/50 for me, if the hooked one trips it, I hit them without even noticing, but I rarely re hook em, I just leave em there
---
Yeah, a team of survivors can deal with one Gen at a time, two if they're lucky. There are five generators, you do the math.
---
See I can spout irrelevant shit as well
---
Darn. Xbox. Wish there was cross-play, none of my friends, Xbox or irl play this game
---
Even worse when they try to bodyblock killer when there's like 5 hooks right in front of them. All they are doing is making themselves injured and not helping the team mate that killer is carrying, because they are inevitably hooked 2 seconds later. It's like ... fucking why?
---
Damn that sucks, cross-platform would make this game so much better considering waiting to find a match for half an hour lol
---
I think my Xbox shut off due to lack of activity once due to waiting for a lobby
---
AAAAAAAAAAAA I FEEL YOUR PAIN!!!
---
That's what distressing is for - to expand her terror radius. She already has the lullaby, there's no reason not to expand her terror radius so those perks can be effective.
---
It's brutally effective, though it tends to turn 10 minute games into 10 hour games, and everyone hates you.
---
It's not camping but I honestly hate going against hags because they put like a thousand traps around the hook and your teammates have to crouch all the way to you and you might be in second state by then,but you can play how you want. When one of the traps by the hook pops I always go for the unhooker since I don't like tunneling and their usually the closest to me.
---
Clown is pretty fun killer. You can just chill out with survivors, smoking weed (Somehow he always have infinite weed in his bottles)
---
Use to main survivor, but recently bought Myers, so I‚Äôm playing a lot more killer.
---
Lol never heard of that before, it was nice chatting with you its getting late (2:05 AM)
---
Why is this reddit obsessed with mental disorders
---
Congrats I also am at rank 10 on killer!
---
Brother in arms :D
---
4:06am i needa sleep too lol. Thanks for the chat and advice
---
Legion is probably one of the weakest killers in the game if not the weakest. 
---
But he is still an M1 killer and Frenzy does a good job of forcing survivors to be injured and makes them waste time mending or healing which plays into your advantage. Especially if you use perks such as Sloppy to keep survivors injured. 
---
Hes kind of like a worse plague. His ability to keep survivors injured requries more effort and is does not last indefinitely but on the other hand survivors may heal against the Legion which wastes their time since Legion has an easy time reinjuring survivors. 
---
His frenzy can also allow to take advantage of perks that gain tokens from hitting survivors such as Remember Me or Save The Best For Last.
---
If anything Discordance is a great tracking perk as it can tell you where half the survivor team is.
---
Eh, those are built into the killers' power and you should expect to be punished for letting them achieve it.
---
Ebony Mori is survivors getting punished because the killer decided to take a certain offering, the one that by far has the most impact on gameplay.
---
Got a team that tbaged me at the exit gates when I was playing pig today. saw them in the next lobby and you already know what went down.
---
Spirit with prayer beads and a green Mori, killed one of them in 2 minutes ended up with a 4k.
---
Revenge is sweet.
---
Anytime. Gn
---
Yeah ebony moris are garbage to go against and should be changed. It doesn‚Äôt help that they appear in bloodwebs pretty frequently and things like double BP events or the gateaux make them even more common. I have tons of them on pretty much every killer, I just don‚Äôt use them since I‚Äôd rather actually play a normal match.
---
N
---
Haven't seen that fake in ages
---
Hands down the best back story for killer concept. The Zealot most join the killer ranks.
---
I was rank 3 with rank 20 killer with one perk
---
I play spirit and I never used the prayer beads because I thought they would be pointless. 
---
This subreddit made me try them out for at least one time. Was probably my all time best game.
---
Cool and all but it would fuck your battery up time
---
My take on this is hit red ranks so that you can counter SWF generally and know when to assume they actually have comms and use that against them, if they're saving each other ASAP and doing gens optimally, it's probably safe to be an asshole back. Unfortunately the only way to best them is identify its ok to be an asshole early, so as you climb ranks you'll have to look for telltale signs early and just strategise as best you can if you suspect they're on comms and hope you can can out-maneuver them. 
---
 
---
Hence the shitty billy/nurse/spirit meta at top tier, they literally did it to themselves, so play like a dickbag if need be, but monitor how they react as you go to figure if you need to try-hard or not. 
---
Alternatively, just try hard all the time and never have fun, everyone loves those players! :D
---
*sprint bursts away*
---
Their isn't a double standard both sides bitch about everything and then the other side counter-bitches. If people complain Nurse is OP then killer mains come out the wood work to defend her and if people complain about infinites then survivor mains come out of lurking to bash these complaints. People need to just play both sides so they get both perspectives, not only does this mean people will make informed comments on the structure of the game but also it may cut back on a bit of the bitching.
---
Okay, doesn‚Äôt mean dead by daylight has theatre mode, just has a mediocre editing app
---
The ranking system sucks to be honest you pretty much depip for doing your job as killer.
---
I play killer to get more BP for my survivers but I'd say 50/50
---
If NOED is gonna get a rework then adrenaline needs one too, people usually use one to counter the other
---
well there still coming but I wouldnt have high Hope's for them as far as them working properly
---
The last one is head on killer edition sksk
---
I thought this was r/sabaton ... *I need to sleep.*
---
/r/gaybears
---
well yea, youre trying to put on a show for a godlike being that enjoys fear, chases, all the other emotions and whatever it feeds on. So the killers are just as much its victims as they also have to perform to please the entity by feeding it. if you kill em too quick or do something else that the entity doesnt like (like moriing) its gonna let u know
---
As survivor being slapped by thicc boi myers isn't that bad
---
I want Bianca Del Rio and one of her perks should be called ‚ÄúILLITERATE‚Äù
---
Good job bud! All downhill from here!
---
I'm probally gonna get downvoted for this but honestly I hope u guys are trolling do u all really safety pip after actually getting more than 2 kills
---
Nope, 2 years ago
---
I play survivor on occasion but keep finding myself drawn to being killer. Internal rage I guess `\(.-.)/'
---
If WGLF is gonna have an extra effect, it needs to be in the same vibe as the perk, something altruistic or supportive that encourages saving team mates, some ideas I had are
---
- stackable heal speed (only applies to the target you unhook for ___ seconds) 1 unhook is 35%, two is 70%, 3 is 100%, and at 4+ you can instantly heal the survivor you unhook 
---
- a less interesting one would be seeing the aura of the survivor you unhook for 30 seconds
---
- any damage applied to the survivor for 15 seconds after being unhooked applies to you instead (potentially would pair great with borrowed time?)
---
-WGLF lets you see the aura of the killer for 4 seconds after unhook (basically it‚Äôs just bbq for survivors now)
---
- for every unhook you gain plus 10% healing speed for the rest of the match, stacks up to 50%
---
Otzdarva has some great videos on this
---
Freezy isn't wrong. If your a killer against a team all with toolboxes, potentially add-ons on them to make them even better, your generators will get rinsed. You still have to find, chase, down and hook a survivor. In that time if the survivors are optimal they can destroy gens. I had it yesterday on a farm map were I downed my first person and 2 gens went, the chase hadn't even been that long, by the time I found another person and downed them 2 more gens popped. They were either very optimal or more likely SWF with the way they played, sadly they were pretty toxic too.   
---
I think ebony's have their place in the game I just think it should change so that you can kill someone after they have reached struggle phase, so in theory they need to be hooked twice. It is frustrating when your tunnelled on first hook and thats game over but sometimes I just think the killer had a bad game, after that farm game I played my next match with a mori.   
---
I see in another comment you said you don't play killer I advise you try it so you fully understand what it can be like and why killers may do things like slug or tunnel during a gen rush or use an ebony. You just don't get the full perspective only playing survivor.
---
We don‚Äôt like your kind
---
/s
---
Nice flair dude
---
that's how I always feel on reddit when you speak up and tell people play how u literally want to people dont like that idea when it comes to its never play how u want to enjoy your game its always let us (survivors) tell you how to play
---
Could you link that video?
---
My daily broke and after i tried to deleted to get a new one i got scammed :))
---
I removed the tag 9 hours ago after it was pointed out to me I'd used it wrong.

You also will not be able to unlock it if you prestige.

You must be me then

You like playing against a spirit?
---
You can post it on r/dbdgonegay a blessed sub

ye
---
I'm playing on Europe servers btw
---
Great halloween decorate.
---
?
---
Ya I get it every now and then the way I deal with it is I just leave it for maybe 5 or 10 minutes and come back and then it works
---
I hate going against spirit because there is no solid counterplay to her power expect hoping she is bad.
---
Alright fair enough, nerf toolboxes too then if they make the game unfun for killer. Imo there are just a lot of cheap items, perks, add-ons that are drastically better than others making the rest obsolete. 
---
Imagine if there was a survivor add-on that let you get hooked one more time before being sacrificed. It would be a complete shit show, and that isn't even as powerful as ebony
---
there is. stop running messing with scratch marks
---
Ok thanks ! I thought I got banned or something ahah
---
Until they implement rank rewards I‚Äôm more than happy to depip every once in a while
---
Honestly I‚Äôd feel bad and give him the hatch
---
*"..fuck."*
---
You can combo OoO with SS to have it one way.
---
yeap making legion a bit worster between the 2
---
He's pretty mediocre. His power is to get everyone injured, vs good survs he's an effective tier 3 myers permanently, and bad survs waste a lot of time healing.
---
Thank you!! I really appreciate the praise here. I don‚Äôt think this is a final draft, and there‚Äôs always room for improvement, but I am stoked that you find it awesome :) That‚Äôs the whole point!
---
They also mentioned this in the AmA they did recently
---
B8
---
Shadowborn is dogshit, work on getting Enduring instead.
---
Not arguing but lore wise a mori means the entity allows the killer to do it themselves so shouldn't it be happy in that case? ü§î
---
Hey that's pretty awesome thank you!
---
Every bitchy survivor post gets downvoted into oblivion. Only these posts survive
---
I'm basically seeing to be mega first then dwight's lol for there perks
---
I enjoyed the concept so much thank you for sharing creativity.
---
I'm a survivor main as well actually but I also play a fair amount of killer, and I also feel like moris are unfair when you are playing solo/duo, but if I'm playing in a 4man swf, I can't really blame the killer for bringing a mori. We have voice comms, good teamwork, but less chances, so thats fair.
---
Hey thanks I'll try her next
---
The fact you pallet stunned an invisible nurse. Unless on her screen you were invisible too
---
Youre most welcome :-)
---
Gotcha! I'm just a big fan of the evil dead franchise and when I saw him I didn't think twice lol
---
This guy is thiccer irl then bubba
---
But that‚Äôs the same thing?
---
Dam thanks dude that's awesome. What does mettle of man do? What did it do before it got nerfed?
---
Uhh.... People are arguing for BANNING guns when Europe mostly just has restricted guns... It's not the guns it's the education system and mental care system combined with incompetent parents who raised their kids like shit
---
I have played killer at red ranks :) Survivor too. People are less toxic at red ranks than at purple tbh. And killer mains despise survivors because they are bitter and grumpy and should probably main survivor for a change so you can get a taste of both sides.
---
valid point
---
Yeah but at the cost of  Letting your teammates die
---
Im still dissagreeing. Starting off the sentence with "My favourite..." is indicating that you are adding a following comment to the latter sentence. If you were indending to adress what your favourite of something is, you have to add what subject you're now talking about. What is it? Is hiding your favourite playstyle? Would the following sentence also be a correct way of formulating what youre trying to say?   &gt;Personally I like to juke. My favorite playstyle however, is hiding in plain sight before or during a chase.
---
I hope you weren't trying to hurt my feelings...
---
All these comments are so incredible, thank you so much!!
---
I buy them every now and then just because of the "mori someone as X" dailies. Even then when I do bring an ebony/ivory mori I try to wait to use it on someone whose been hooked twice already so they're dead anyways.
---
Thank you! Any other Killers you'd like to see painted?
---
Hahaha thank you!
---
You're going to get hit eventually, no matter how good you are. Unless the killer has instadowns or you mess up, you're going to be injured for half the chase, and once you're injured they're going to track you by sound. Running the killer around for a couple pallets, getting injured, and then being able to just disengage and vanish into the fog is great.
---
Iron Will means you can still do stuff when you're injured, too. Otherwise you're taking your life into your hands when you decided to rush a gen instead of healing.
---
The perks are pretty questionable, but I love the killer power. That would make for a very fun and unique killer.
---
I've gotten so many salt msgs over the past 4 days that it took me to get Bubba to 40. I'm new just started going for teachables
---
no need to know which streamer, what counts is the wrong message he's spreading.
---
YES PLEASE
---
I've ranted about them enough. If I use Ebony moris, I tend for the most to not Mori someone unless I've already hooked them twice already. It feels like cheating to me. 
---
I used to think they should have a condition similar to Devour Hope, that you need to get so many hooks before you can start Mori killing, but in hindsight that kind of makes Devour Hope almost pointless. 
---
I have new solution though! I would like your opinions.
---
The total number of Mori kills you can perform increases as the match progresses. 
---
The total number of Mori kills available equals number of generators completed minus 1.
---
Therefore when the 2nd generator is completed the killer can perform 1 Mori. 3rd gen, 2 Mori's. 4th gen, 3 Mori's. 5th gen, 4 Mori's.
---
The same conditions apply that a survivor must be hooked at least once before they can be Mori killed, except the last standing survivor who can be Mori killed regardless of whether they have been hooked or not. 
---
Obviously, closing the hatch automatically complete generators and therefore meet the conditions to Mori the last survivor.
---
I think this could be considered a little more 'fair'. At least a step in the right direction IMO. 
---
It just gives survivors a bit more of a chance to progress through the match, complete some gens, score some points, before they inevitably die anyway. 
---
Killers will still get their easy wins if that's what they want from them, but may have to pace out the game a little more when they are in control if they want to Mori everyone.
---
"If a survivor loops"???? What, are they supposed to let you catch them or what? Looping isnt toxic, like?? That's like saying a Killer using his power is toxic. It's part of the game.
---
Killer, but good fuck the queue times make me want to go survivor.
---
thats why i browse reddit while queuing
---
The joke was it ran terrible at 24fps alla theatre
---
What video if you don‚Äôt mind sharing.
---
For Clown, you basically have to use pallets more than you think. He's still a M1 killer with no real catch-up mechanic. His power just reduces the amount of time you can loop for.
---
Plague, don't cleanse and pray your teammates don't cleanse. Never use a pallet if you aren't broken yet. Never let her puke directly on you, always try to be looping around something.
---
Well if it's an unsafe pallet there's nothing you can do anyways (against any killer).
---
If it's a safe pallet, you just need to get better at timing your pallet vaults.
---
You're playing Killer, the Survivors hate you anyway.
---
isnt it like in the real game?
---
If someone photobombs my ghostface mori they get to run away and I‚Äôll go target another survivor instead for the time being
---
It was my first Freddy movie but it was kind of boring. Pretty gorey, but not very scary. I'd give it like a 4/10
---
God ikr? Rank 3 survivor and rank 4 killer but It takes ages to find a killer game and not that long for a survivor one. Thank god reset is coming soon.
---
I feel like if I get facecamped I may have lost the fight but I won the battle lol
---
Yah the PS4 que times have gone back to being insanely stupid since bill finally came out last Tuesday, was waiting 20-30mins for a game. I played allot of killer last night and they all had a bad time. That KNWP clan got obliterated by Shirtless Myers!!! Only time I bring out the Mori but I make sure they all get double hooked first!
---
Same here I can have 120k in 2 games playing killer! If I play survivor maybe 25k
---
It's totally random. Just like on PC. You May not get ruin in 50+ games
---
Pretty much. Flap your hands and fight until the end.
---
I really wish we could apply the bloody effect to any outfit if we had that piece prestiged, BHVR would make so much more money off people who prefer to be bloody for the flex.
---
Weird
---
If I‚Äôm with friends I‚Äôm like alright guys go get them gens done I got the killer taken care of hahaha
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cmp405/found_a_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
 I couldn't care less about survivors tea bagging, killers camping hooks, slugging etc do what you want its a game but when people turn into key board warriors and get all salty because they died on hook sending abusive messages :/ just grow up !
---
It‚Äôs pretty good for Plague and Legion too. Very underrated perk
---
Well, thrill of the hunt is for totems. This perk would be for traps and armor, anything that the killer utilizes. Still narrow, but still useful.
---
Brooo hahahahah
---
/u/gematria666 /u/dixychicken797
---
Just go with this mindset: Nurse is incredibly hard to learn properly so just get in the game and expect to lose. If the survivors trash talk you, they are pathetic and just ignore it and move on. Use the games you play to get used to her blinks (Only use 2, not more). Don‚Äôt use range add-ons if you‚Äôre still learning. Levelling her up to get better perks can help, but main thing is learning her blinks, shadowborn really helps me.
---
Thanks! I know the perks are super well thought out, but I'm also not super knowledgeable about the meta of the game and perk interaction.  
---
Any suggestions?
---
That's the entity saying you are doing it wrong
---
This happened to me and my friends in a kyf. Please devs don't remove this bug I really wanna keep yeeting the killers away with my pallets ;-;
---
"I'm in the house hehehe."
---
"Do you know where I am? Hehehehe. I could be anywhere, I'm like the wind baby"
---
\*Changes locker\*
---
"Now you know where I am? Hehe, you don't."
---
If you happen to be too good for a group (1 hook kills with little to no chases), or you use shortcuts (mori), you may blackpip with 4k.
---
There is not enough content on reddit for one killer queue.
---
And Im still waiting for BBQ on my P3 level 50 Ghostface after about 1 Million bloodpoints of trying
---
That's what it is. There is a section that says 4d and that's where the Nurse is.
---
&gt;You also need to remember that most people on this subreddit are survivors who lose most 
---
You mean killers? Most of posts here are from killer mains
---
Can you breath in this thing? xD
---
Are you facing a Bubba with instasaw add-ons or Play with your Food? Those conditions would make it very difficult to dodge getting downed, since you'll get virtually no warning that he's about to drop you.
---
Hugging corners isn't hugely effective - windows are the real key. Bubba can saw in a loop if he has to, and he can saw through a pallet vault, but he can't saw through a window. When you find a good window loop, milk it for all its worth - they force Bubba to decide between being a regular M1 killer, or using his saw. The extra hit makes all the difference, doubly so if he's running Play with your Food.
---
It depends on which system you‚Äôre playing the game... PC? nurse. I play Xbox now &amp; I love Plague.
---
Damn-
---
It would make sense...darn it
---
not enough frames for console to do it dont bother
---
I just run Franklin's all the time
---
Thx
---
kinda new still to dbd and noticed this as I leveled him up. I got him to 40, but he's still giving me the most BP per game, so I keep playing him. managed to hit rank 13, and now I only get gen rushed by rank 8's. Play With Your Food seems like it would give me the move speed I feel I'm missing, but I don't have Michael.
---
No, that‚Äôs literally how hag is supposed to be played. Her biggest strength is the map pressure she can put on survivors, including by trapping hooked survivors to pressure potential rescues
---
Haha sure
---
It would be neat to get a futuristic Plague costume with a sparking electric incense burner
---
Uhh I play both. Killer takes a lot more patience and skill. 
---
Survivor is such a walk in the park
---
Ghost Face could have been that. But I don‚Äôt see him moving up to S Tier unless they change him a bit
---
Put the sensitive to the max and hit some sick 360s for extra style points.
---
Obviously I‚Äôm talking to a brick wall because you‚Äôre as thick as one

Yay, thanks for the info. Sorry for the complaint. But I‚Äôve just got done from a 60 hour week I just wanna play with people my own level  not ya know...

Honestly, I honestly don't know what you're honestly talking about. Aren't they honestly exactly the opposite thing?
---
More like saving time. If he hit him he would‚Äôve been able to run off and he would have to go hit him again
---
No it‚Äôs good to complain. But they‚Äôre working on it as we speak. So we should wait and just hope that there will be actual changes.
---
Man I wish they had proximity chat though....
---
Someone datamined something about push to talk so we might be getting something :D
---
Maybe it's like a permission slip. The entity isn't necessarily happy about it but the killer earned it fair and square so they have to honour the deal.
---
Just imagine you doin a sneak and a wild survivor yells 
---
*YO ITS A FUCKIN GHOSTFACE*
---
Billy oneshots. If you see 4 people on the hook at the same time there's something wrong going on.
---
I would say ‚Äúfuturists‚Äù instead of ‚Äútuturists‚Äù and it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe realities of bioterrorism‚Äù

Enduring, nurse calling (nurse). franklin (bubba ala the cannibal and brutal (the trapper) is pretty good teachables if you play m1 killers.
---
Jake, shut up.

No really, the killer is around the corner so stop complaining about your bleeding ass.
---
Ur a pedo
---
Legion's fifth member, slightly handicapped.
---
Because im a bug sadness
---
Its gonna be another clown
---
This is gonna sound obvious but to me it was kind of an eye opener. Survivors main defense against nurse is breaking line of sight. To facilitate this they love to take corners and then immediately double back. When a survivor turns a corner like for instance the killer shack, don‚Äôt blink to where they should be. Blink to the edge of the corner and use the second blink to get within hitting distance or more often than not just smack them as they run right up to you. 
---
Try to get a feel for survivors that like to double back when they have no where to hide. If they‚Äôre staring behind them a lot it‚Äôs usually a good indicator that they expect you to overshoot them. 
---
Also I‚Äôm All Ears is pretty awesome on her I find.
---
No , another clown is confirmed
---
Also spine chill
---
Wh
---
This build is dumb as hell lol 
---
Pop (they love to stack gens), Infectious Fright (to see who‚Äôs waiting nearby), Bloodwarden (they will 100% come back for teammates), BBQ (awareness)
---
And insta down hatchets
---
I used to be a killer main but I don't have the time to wait 15 minutes for a lobby each time I wanna play.
---
I know one thing for sure tho, wish I had the potatoes I get in my games as survivor in my killer games. xd
---
It would be really cool if you could call a holy smite  after 3 or something like that armors get sabotaged. It would inflict dying on the survivor you use it on. Overall a really cool consept
---
That's funny.
---
But on a side note this disconnect culture within this games playerbase is killing the game.
---
"Ohh no I left scratches to the basement and made noise got found first better D/C to make sure I insta win and help my whole team" /s
---
Between the constant ever changing bugs and this bullshit it's amazing this game still has a playerbase.
---
Love the game but the desire to play gets lower all the time.
---
Three Eyed Raven mode
---
I did bump my sensitivity all the way so that helps
---
All killers can now hook themselves.  Until a recent update, only Freddy could do this to end games faster.
---
I was thinkin about im all ears it sounded really good. Ill give what you said a shot ty :)
---
When BBQ shows no aura and I know they‚Äôre all RIGHT THERE I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs camping to run around the hook looking for them.
---
I like, but needs to look more like a crusader
---
Just FYI it‚Äôs useless before tier 3. Sixty seconds is a long ass time
---
If the guy didn't have put his channel in his username he wouldn't have gotten mori'd
---
You should yeah, max sensitivity is lower than pc though
---
Yeah i figured. I have it tier 1 atm
---
[Her mori ](https://youtu.be/qbI4CH2zXnw)
---
So the game is failing on many levels
---
Yeah but itll have to do lol n thanks for the advice :)
---
These cheesy issues are part of what endears me to the game TBH
---
Parry this you fucking C L A U D E T T E
---
Let me introduce you to my friend ebony mori
---
Had an endless t3 Myers game. Got my power only in the end of the game with something like 2 hooks on two survs (they used Lerry's offering, and stalking didn't go so well), so basically had to use it to camp last survivor after all gens done. I even opened the gate to send a message. Ended up with 3k with one guy dying to endgame collapse. Hooks was too far away from each other and I had to drop 3rd kill because he kept struggling. Closed hatch right in front of last survivor included (not my fault it spawned right on their way =\_=). Postgame chat was a shitshow. I even felts a little guilty even though everything that happened was completely accidental.
---
&gt;If the guy didn't put his channel in his username he wouldn't have gotten mori'd
---
Damn right! Screw him for trying to put his name out. Disrespectful advertisers!11!!1 
---
Keep up the amazing job. One TTV at a time. 
---
^/s
---
She sounds like waluigi but he snorted too much of quentins cocaine
---
Not the mori itself is scary.
---
The threat of a mori should be.
---
You shouldn't be in a position as a survivor where you feel safe being caught x times. That's not a horror survival game.
---
Why are you people obsessed with calling gay people mentally disabled?

Had the same a couple of times yesterday. I think it might happen if you want to destroy a trap with a flaslight, but don't actually destroy it, the aura stays visible. I think something else might trigger it as well, since I've seen a trap aura from a distance on a map as well while I was the only one with a flaslight.
---
Masterpiece
---
Can you get banned for using them?
---
thank you yes! And now that we are at it please give trapper 2 traps or just 2 trap slots by default
---
Nice!!!! All you to do is scream a lot
---
&gt; I watched a video on YT by Zubatlel and immediately felt sub-par.
---
You're holding yourself to an unrealistic standard, there. Don't be Zubat, be you - and be the best you.
---
It's an older guide, but [Scott Jund's Huntress video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRDijaX5Io) is a great place to start if you're looking to improve your game. You'll learn about the finer points of hatchet use, including "steering" survivors.
---
Huntress is slower than the average killer, so you really need to guarantee that you're not wasting time in a dead area, and that's why there's such a focus on tracking perks like Whispers, Barbecue &amp; Chilli, and A Nurse's Calling. Ruin is there because tracking *always* takes time, and Ruin will buy you it.
---
Remember that Whispers needs to be *max rank*, otherwise it's not doing much other than telling you that there's a person somewhere on the 1/4 of the map you're in. Higher rank, smaller radius, makes it a lot easier to get that first chase and down.
---
After the first hook, BBQ will tell you where to go next - and Whispers will tell you if anyone is still around once you get there. Again, there's no wasted time - if Whispers goes dark then you'll either have a good indication of where they went to, or a justification for going back to your hook.
---
Nurse's is great because hatchets mean injuries, and injuries are very dangerous against Huntress on *most* maps. Nurse's also raises the possibility of getting a 2-for-1 on survivors - either by downing the healee or by snowballing the injuries if it hits the healer. Yet again, no wasted time - Nurse's will *always* point you *directly* to a target, with full situational awareness (the area they're in, where they're looking) so that you can decide whether it's safer to go for a hatchet down or a chase-and-M1. Finally, Nurse's allows you to safely follow a strategy of injuring one survivor and then switching to another healthy one - significantly slowing the overall progress of survivors.
---
If you have Iridescent Head then drop Nurse's for Monitor &amp; Abuse and enjoy instadowns/instaDCs from well outside detectable range.
---
In short, the overall plan is to find survivors as soon as possible, slow them with injuries, and snowball them when they start to heal.
---
Happend sometimes when a lobby crashes. Restarting the game should fix it
---
lol "thinked" no offense
---
So weird that it differs so from region to region and console to console. Seems like ps4 is the only console without insta survivor queues
---
Ah thanks! Then again, hearing my terror radius, they'd probably assume I'm coming over anyways. But interesting approach. Will try that later.
---
I didn't feel hostile/like a dick. I just 1. wondered how they're the same thing since they sort of do the opposite (take away sound VS add terror radius from a further distance) and 2. stumbled upon your double use of "honestly", which made it funny to read. I'm sorry if I attacked you personally, didn't mean to.
---
Ooh I got downvoted too. Love this website
---
I see da cat i do the upvat
---
The amount of times it goes within 30 seconds is just unreal and I‚Äôd rather have a more permanent perk instead.
---
Yeah and smoke a few packs of cigarettes a day
---
No, it is so lame people say this. If I happen to hit the person that got unhooked I will just leave them and go after the person that saved. I have hopefully found another player by that time anyway.
---
I remember seeing one with a sledgehammer.
---
Great and valid points! Couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself
---
Were you doing SWF with a rank 20 survivor
---
Took me a minute to understand what you did there...
---
I never knew that other people did this. I do it all the time!
---
Deus Vult should have something to do with vaulting as well. Then again, that may just be my love of puns.
---
In my defense, I did save her once she got hooked, then I got downed near the same spot and wiggled out because he had no hooks to put me on.
---
Then I kinda forgot how this map was laid out and got chased right in front of the basement. Things got pretty bad from there on out
---
Kinda stupid imho
---
you literally ruin other peoples gameplay by DCing, survivors have to do 3v1 or maybe 2v1 even because of some asshole that didnt like getting downed first. killers dcing also ruins the gameplay of the survivors if its like mid game or early game, its just an shitty thing to do. its very fair if bhvr bans people for it.
---
There's no universal understanding, but personally i only go arms full up flailing when its safe, and repeatedly tap smaller motions when it's not
---
I never actually saw the original Black Christmas, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs better? 
---
Pinhead gets the #1 spot to start
---
Chubby Dwight and Pig Leatherface.
---
Of course the rank system works amazingly. Didn‚Äôt show the right side cause he got a 4k right? That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs being placed against purple ranks
---
I am the killer
---
thats actaully super useful with freddy if he has thrill of the hunt. just tp to the gen everytime you get a notification. well cooldowns are a problem i guess.
---
I‚Äôm dumb.
---
When TF was the last time a Nurse actually got burned? Wraith is vulnerable whenever he is in stealth mode, while Nurse probably is only vulnerable during her blink.
---
Honestly, I honestly have no idea how they could have honestly gotten that honest opinion of hostility, honest.
---
Freddy was reworked and pushed him unto high B rank, maybe low A rank. People want to play him. Also a lot of payer see Ghostface as weak. He isn't weak hut his play style is difficult to master. Ghostface excels at taking down survivors one by one. Now this isn't to say if you can mark multiple survivors at once that you shouldn't but you should realize it is very hard to do so and not likely to be successful. With him you have to remember every survivor is an extra set of eyes that can knock you out of your power.
---
Not nice
---
With the right build can he slow down the game just a liiiiiittttttllllleeeeeeee bit
---
we cant cancel attempting escape on a hook on mobile and it sucks bruh.
---
While it's poor sportsmanship, it really isn't against license agreement to leave the game when you are presented with that option. And they'd shoot themselves in the foot by doing that. Your personal hatred for people who might have something better to do won't change that.
---
i mean, she is also unable to blink if a flashlight is being pointed at her, this can be useful if another teammate is getting chased and you just point the flashlight at her from behind.
---
I know it's the demogorgon coming next, but I'd love to see It, maybe Hannibal? But most of all a xenomorph from Alien. That would be horrifying.
---
Killer because i like making people happy. I'm letting everyone escape but i'm getting bloodpoints anyway, so i'm happy too :D
---
I *want* to play killer more, but spending 10+ minutes every game waiting for a lobby when I could get a lobby near instantly as a survivor leads to me playing about 3-times as many survivor matches as killer matches.
---
Does my character look like Freddy to you?
---
Constant waving: I am being camped.
---
Still: It's safe, come get me.
---
One single wave: I'm still here, come get me.
---
It‚Äôs so much better than the 2006 piece of shit.
---
Pretty good job so far?
---
 I've written it in my direct reply already, maybe you didn't see it.
---
It was just trying to point out the grammar-typo (the double use of honestly in one sentence) in a funny way. No need to feel attacked, even though I have apologized for making them feel that way, since I didn't intend that.
---
I thought if you had custom offering icons your game crashes on the offering page before loading
---
Killer. I'm good at it and every time I try survivor I get screamed at by my teammates even when they hook swarm and all die and I manage to solo gens.
---
*#1 Rule*: REPAIRING GENERATORS IS YOUR #1 PRIORITY. If people are going down quickly, then your best bet is I to cleanse that Dull Totem or to Self-Care for half a minute. I see people, even at high rank loose just because they wasted lots of valuable to sitting around and not repairing.
---
Accurate but replace the 4 P3‚Äôd Claudette SWF with solo queue baby David, ace, and jammies Dwight
---
If you want to play an effective killer then Spirit.
---
If you want a great P3 cosmetic then Spirit.
---
You should focus on unlocked perks first. BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury are probably the first 4 you should unlock. The killers you'll need to level for all 4 perks are Leatherface, Hag, Hilbilly, and Spirit respectively.
---
Nope, neither of those regress passively, you're definitely imagining things or you're just forgetful.
---
Technically, yes. EAC has an insanely miniscule chance of detecting you changing files and therefore banning you. I've never heard of this happening and I've been using custom icons for pretty much everything for 4+ months. BHVR won't help you if you get banned although I'm sure that EAC could help you if by some curse you get banned.
---
Cool, thx a lot  :D
---
Everywhere I go mods say I have a chance to get banned and there is no way to get back. I dont understand why they just dont unban. How would you contact EAC for an unban?
---
I want to main killer more because solo survivor is the fucking worst, but wait times are attrocious and once I get to high ranks it's a pain to pip, since Behavior doesn't actually understand how to determine if a killer does well or not.
---
I call myself a "dailies main" for now.
---
I bought this perks in the shop xD
---
Why all the hate on their viewer count? People got to start somewhere.
---
Yup das a wierd bug.
---
It would actually make a horrifying killer.... But we already have a Pig.
---
I propose we give The Pig another head customisation just like the one in this picture. Just imagine doing a gen, hearing breathing and turning around to see that face leering at you.
---
At first, survivor. If I'm honest, I was a douchey survivor main for the longest time. Entitled and the whole lot. Now out of boredom I'm more split between survivor and killer. Killer is far more gratifying, and fun as long as you don't take it too seriously and remember it's just a game.
---
I tend to play around with Wraith a lot between ranks 20 and 10, and move to Hillbilly/Clown/Myers as my big three between rank 10 and 1.
---
woaw, this I have to try! cya later moried survivers!
---
You could, like,  go make a sandwich every other match or something. Maybe I just have a sandwich making problem.
---
He was clearly making fun of the dude's grammar by spamming "honestly"
---
Yeah but... what is it?
---
Very smart!
---
Well all it does is prevent looping, maybe the numbers could be tweaked but I think one hit per gen looped is fair enough
---
More like "ugh, those 2 guys entered the lobby kinda together! They must be a toxic SWF group! I better leave!!"
---
Oh yeah me too that‚Äôs always the worst üòÇ
---
It's because the killer has to chase 4 survivors, which is the hardest, most stressful part. While in comparison, each individual survivor will spend significantly less time being chased
---
After 3 games I started as the trapper (who I e ne de played before) and got 4k by second match, looks like I got a new main
---
When survivors focus on the primary objective of completing gens.  Oftentimes they use toolboxes to repair generators.
---
That person is a complete idiot. I feel bad for people that use controllers and can't set up macros to just hold down a button.
---
I actually ducked a lobby yesterday with 3, P3 Claudettes. I was playing survivor!
---
I don't blame you
---
If this was in the game, the killer would just wait in front of you so even if you somehow unhooked yourself, you would go down instantly.
---
And the killer wouldn‚Äôt even pick you up probably because of the possibility of decisive strike to a hatch escape.
---
Just a waste of everyones time...
---
Survivors that run straight to infinites are just as fun to play against as a face camping killer. Like someone else mentioned, both sides have their annoying players. All you can do is roll your eyes
---
My advice is give up the chase and go bash someone on a gen.
---
i got a 4k from devour and i depipped with 23k points lol
---
My mate was rank 10
---
Ignore all these noobs, you get claudette for self-care, you get nea for balanced landing, you get Bill for borrowed time (you'll understand why soon enough) and then whoever, if you're new I'd probably suggest windows of oppertunity on Kate Denson, it reveals all the pallets and windows on the map so it really helps you memorize those.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Seriously lithe is 10x worse than balanced landing, these guys giving you advice are noobs.
---
I hate when people try to heal while exposed... someone kept trying to heal against a Myers that had us tier 3d most of the game, and I had dead hard which definitely makes being injured better at that point.
---
I'm open to being corrected on the numbers, but if I recall correctly - 
---
* **Kicking** and breaking a pallet takes **2.7s** overall (0.1+2.6).
---
* **Saw** charge time is 2.5s basic, saw-breaks are 1s, for **3.5s** overall.
---
* **Brutal Strength** takes 20% off the break, *2.18s* overall.
---
* **Instasaw** is going to be either 36% faster (18%+18%) for **2.6s** total or "18% faster on 18% faster" for **2.7s**\* 
---
So ***from a standing start,*** **Brutal Strength &gt; Instasaw &gt; Kick &gt; any other Saw**.
---
**If you're in a chase and running towards a pallet** then it's worth noting that Bubba is *significantly slowed* by revving - you may be risking a near-certain "regular" hit for a far more risky instadown, and if the pallet isn't already dropped then you may well end up eating a stun instead.
---
Billy is not nearly as slowed during revving, so it's just a matter of gauging the chance of landing the saw vs eating a stun - if the pallet is already dropped then there's generally no drawback to powering on through.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
\* u/Peanits - are percentages calculated from the starting figure, or are they adjusted in sequence according to a hierarchy?
---
Deliverance is so trash stop thinking it's good, guaranteed you're rank 15.
---
So basically barely anyone is facing any kind of temp ban.
---
There already is a punishment in place - 0 bp and rank decrease (which isn't really a punishment, but it's presented as such)
---
Of course, it seems like you wouldn't be satisfied until the disconectee would be perma-banned, their family killed and their house burned down, but luckily that's not your call to make. 
---
Any game would probably nosedive if it were :)
---
*Chase OP plays*
---
Hello Amanda, you don't know me but I know you, I want to play a game.
---
So avoidable. Just go sit in queue for another 10 minutes and hope you don't get another SWF when 80% of lobbies are SWF.
---
Pennywise (A fear inducing killer. Able to feed on Surviviors fear with his deadlights to become more powerful the more afraid they are. His perks, *Taste their fear*, *Illusion*, and *Isolation* give him the ability to constantly confuse and separate Surviviors, lowering their chances of survival.)
---
They can't take jokes cause they're spending more time baiting straight dudes so they can take dick instead of finding someone that's also into dudes. Then they sit around and wonder why they become suicidal. "Boo hoo no one wants me." When no one is any straight man.
---
Don't worry about him
---
*depression*
---
This is the real reason.
---
So that all the noobkillers don't uninstall.
---
Yeah but this thread got 40% upvoted so clearly ur the silent majority and you could even be lying.
---
Real shit this kid died in a gas explosion. This is literally us watching him fucking die
---
How do I switch from having an add-on to not having any? I don‚Äôt want to keep accidentally wasting them.
---
omg this is unfair af
---
The reason bitter murmur is less optimal is that if you as a killer have a choice between chasing a survivor off a generator and beginning a chase with not someone currently on a generator, it is always a better use of your time to go for somebody who is currently on a generator. By definition the people you get the notification from with bitter murmur have not started working on a new gen yet so starting a chase on them is less optimal than finding someone on a generator
---
This makes sense. Im not saying being a killer is easier. But pipping is.
---
The face looks so manly wtf 
---
Other than that, good job!
---
i personally have been playing doc and its been a lot of fun, also makes it much easier to get a 4k vs a 3k and an escape thru hatch or a door after hatch is closed
---
I third that, Wraith would look amazing
---
He never really specified if his job was only to kill did he?
---
I hope things get better for you
---
#Is a trap now shut
---
You're salty over something with literally no impact on the game, are you ok?
---
There's enough gay shit on this sub already. No one needs more. Y'all are already sexually glorifying a fictional serial killer. Stick with that shit and be happy since it's the biggest forced meme on this sub for over a year now.
---
I'd avoid the Iridescent Heads until you're very comfortable with Huntress - you'll not learn as much if you're always instadowning.
---
&gt;  Never considered using whisper because I didn‚Äôt have a decent headset 
---
Whispers will light up at the same time it's providing the audio cue, but be aware that Whispers is *binary* - it's either on, or off. That said, a decent headset is a *must* for DBD since so much of the game involves listening for things.
---
&gt; I just don‚Äôt know the maps well enough
---
The random nature of map generation means that steering is mostly about looking a few feet ahead and setting up an easy window or pallet hatchet, or preventing the survivor from breaking line of sight or approaching something you don't want to deal with. 
---
Remember that with Nurse's you can land a hatchet and then *do something else* - or *pretend* to do something else, which may lure the injured survivor (and ideally their friends) into thinking it's safe to heal.
---
It's dissapointing that survivors have gotten worse over the years instead of better, are you salty that I'm calling you a noob for waving your arms around like an ADDkid who's mom told him to sit still for 30 secs?
---
Yes finally a really good quality cosplay that isn't another attention-seeking Susie (the easiest of all IMO)

Bravo OP it looks phenomenal !

Why do lf's camp the chest sometimes I don't get it

I wonder when they will change the Legion's FF hits to match Miss Piggy. If her dash ability doesn't count as a basic hit, then why does Legion's?
---
Made with little to no effort
---
I die 9/10 matches anymore. Once you stop treating the game like its e-sports or something, it becomes not only more enjoyable to play, but less frustrating to lose, even if you lose more often
---
This sold me on getting your pack! 
---
Is it possible to have a variant like this for the perks as well? I know your perks are like a blue/pink pastel, but it be cool to have variants like this if possible!

Keep up the good work! Can‚Äôt wait to see the killer icons!

Lmfao bruh you literally cant even troll. 5 year old cant handle looking like an idiot.

Holy shit you‚Äôre more annoying than said cancers. You really think you‚Äôre helping anything here???
---
Pennywise, Nea, Pinhead
---
That shit is the Persuer from Dark Souls 2 and you can't change my mind.
---
Love it, made me think of Reynauld from Darkest Dungeon. It would be cool if he could steal items from the chest or items that survivors dropped.
---
and this is why I rock Iron Will
---
There shouldn't be a matchmaking it should just be random matches sometimes you'll run into high rank of the time to run the low rank would make the game fun for everyone
---
Go on about how ‚Äúthis games toxic, let me explain my situation in a post exactly the same to thousands of others and then get angry when people don‚Äôt wanna hear it‚Äù is constructive

Oh no! Gay people exist! And are making things! How dare we? How dare we exist and make stuff for each other since y‚Äôall don‚Äôt?
---
Never start a game without it
---
You sir are legend
---
It's not inherently toxic, but as a killer I always have at least one toxic survivor every second game, who takes these mechanics and exploits to the full
---
Hahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaa stay triggered buddy.
---
Bullying twitch streamers is the way to go brother
---
Is there a wraith one by any chance?

Shame it notifies the survivors when you tier up though.  Other wise this would actually work.

That and you can see Micheal stare.

I'm update 2.7.0, BHVR was forced to only have *active* Reverse Bear Traps kill Survivors who attempt to escape through an Exit Gate because of the additional of the End Game Collapse. This means any Reverse Bear Traps put on Survivors after all generators were repaired won't kill the Survivor. They made this change with the End Game Collapse because being fixed to remove your Reverse Bear Traps before escaping, with the End Game Collapse Death Timer still decreasing, it was just to powerful.
---
2) AMBUSH ATTACK PERK NERF
---
In the latest major update, BHVR added extra logging to track what is considered a basic attack. This means Chainsaw attacks, Hunting Hatchet attacks, Feral Frenzy attacks, *Ambush attacks*, etc; are all different attacks from your basic attack. Also a shadow change they did with this update is they changed Franklin's Demise, Save The Best For Last, and other perks to only trigger and gain Tokens on basic attacks. This (I'm assuming) was changed so that you couldn't get infinite Save The Best For Last Tokens when preforming successful Feral Frenzy attacks or drop your Item when hit by Chainsaw or Hunting Hatchet attacks. Unfortunately since The Pig's Ambush attack also isn't considered a basic attack, she was unfortunately roped into this and now several perks don't trigger or grant Tokens to you when successfully preforming Ambush attacks.

Are they cheating or what causes them to get them done so fast? I thought brand new parts dont fully repair the gens anymore.

im doing it for my game so when im done i can send you a folder with resized and renamed ones that will work in game
---
What?
---
They don't need to disable SWF. If they would just allow Killers to opt out of SWF, the issue would fix itself quickly.
---
Moris are for dailies and baby killers.
---
AMEN! Now let the music play!
---
It actually does cause survivors to ‚Äúlose‚Äù when the killer closes their application, shuts off console, or pulls their Ethernet. I‚Äôve been in plenty of PS4 matches where when they do that, it doesn‚Äôt count it as an official DC so we don‚Äôt get our points for playing or survival, we get nothing for BP or experience. It‚Äôs as if the match never happened. And that‚Äôs frustrating after spending time playing the game.
---
Insidious kills your TR after standing still for a time.

I think you're thinking of unnerving presence.
---
I'm new to the sub so I have no comment on that. As far as my post, I'm just more concerned about how toxicity can turn newer players away. Toxicity is always going to frowned upon in any game, as it should be. I'm not saying there should be outrage over it because let's keep it real, toxic players will always exist. Some people just have inflated egos. But I don't think there's anything wrong with the community stepping forward and trying to police itself by telling people to knock it off.

I am fully aware. I don't even use moris. I think they are bad gameplay design and they punish you for using them.
---
As a Wraith main, here are some tips:
---
Put yourself in a position where when you uncloak, you can lunge for a hit. When you uncloak you get a speed boost, pair that with the extra speed of a lunge for crazy distance. 
---
When patrolling gens, if you hear someone there uncloak behind a wall, try to stay hidden while going to the gen, unless you can get a bodyblock on them while they‚Äôre on the gen
---
Cloak during chases if the survivor pallet stuns you,  lithes away, DSes away, etc so you can gain that distance back
---
Play with your Food is your friend man. 
---
I recommend Ruin, PwyF
---
And good luck because Wraith is a mid tier killer
---
It‚Äôs probably people stepping away while waiting to find a lobby because of how long it can take
---
But really things would be a lot faster and smoother if everybody readied up and was paying attention
---
I'm sorry reading is hard for you.
---
From my experience on the ps4 version, I think because it's slow to find survivor games sometimes people ready up and walk away while it searches which is why they don't ready. Or theres the ones who just don't pay attention lol.
---
Killer main, wraith. I play on xbox with either instant matchmaking or about 10-15 minute waits
---
Guy on Reddit thinks SWF is balanced fine and fun to play against.
---
I main not playing the game
---
No there's a good chance the killer is boosted and uses ebony mori's to compensate so I'll try for a while, if I realize it's one of those 2000+ hour killers who still use ebony mori because they have mental problems I'll usually just look for keys in a chest and hope to mine some rare ebony mori killer who couldn't 4k-salt.
---
Would you look at that, from a defenseful "queen" to hateful racist in a matter of seconds. It seems like i hit the right spot on your special snowflake ass when you got so triggered that you had to bring race into this matter, hope my comment above didnt hit too close to home :) . Its actually quite funny to see that you had to stalk my profile and then try to personally attack me with the info you found simply because you have no valid argument against what i said earlier because you know my statement is true, it's pathetic and also a great example of the logic that lies behind your messed up attention-seeking agenda.
---
I recently had the joy to experiment the ''wait forever to get teamed up and being disconnected as we spawn into the map because 'someone left during the loading screen'''
---
umm no we want myers
---
everyone does it
---
Thanks I guess?
---
Assuming there's no antagonism involved, they're generally doing it in order to guarantee their emblems and/or kills. That's what the game "trains" them to do.
---
Survivors get taught how to loop and how to hit skillchecks, killers get taught how to get kills. Camping gets kills, at the cost of whatever gen progression can be achieved for the duration of the hook.
---
Hahaha you guys are cracking me up.
---
ded mim.
---
This happened to me twice earlier as Pizza Dwight, a Legion and Hillbilly. Both disconnected when I crouched before them
---
What are you talking about? Nobody downvoted you, you fucking weirdo. At least not at this point. Someone simply responded to you with the word 'constructive' because your post had no reason. Just the bit about Russians. You clearly edited it after posting.
---
Anyway, I don't think it's a 'dumbass' idea but thanks for your opinion.
---
in real life.
---
I guess most people complaining about the current Mori don't even remember or didn't play back then when Mori was instakill without hooks.
---
Wow. The fact you can say that without a sense of irony is pretty funny. 
---
I suggest you just quit the game. You cleary dont have the emotional maturity to handle it and we'd all be better off without you.
---
Pyramid Head would be ridiculously awesome
---
thank you &lt;3
---
The only way killers are going to go for a nerf to Ebony mori is if it provides a buff in some other way. Its already been nerfed once after all. That being said your idea for a need isn't a bad one, I would offer something like "The cooldowns of your powers deceases and your vaulting speed increases as the gens are completed - 5% each gen"
---
Or perhaps at 3 gens survivors have blindness, 4 they have mangled and at 5 they have the one that stops them from dropping pallets - think its called hindered. The effect only lasts one minute after each gen is popped.
---
I do both since ei am new to game and suck as both but I like doing basement bubba as killer or generator jock as detective tapp
---
1. my hexes get destroyed before the match starts.
---
2. i havent leveled up hag any bit because im not interested in her or her perks.
---
3. i think that people who run ruin cant apply presure in other ways, like hooking and other stuff.
---
4. btw on ps4 huntress is one of the most rare killers to see so survivors dont know how to counter her.
---
Yeah except you're the one who said they're playing less, you're the one going apeshit over someone using a mori and now you're going apeshit over me saying it's really developers who allowed him to use the mori in the first place, time to take your medication.
---
i‚Äôm sure if you go to their website there will be something there but i‚Äôm not sure if EAC will lift the ban either.
---
Dats weird.
---
You have to pay for standard killers on mobile? I was gonna download but forget about it.
---
A Yeah they did
---
B I never said they did I said I didn't downvote your post even though I thought it was dumbass
---
C Russians are dicks.
---
Weird never happenend to me, I just sometimes hit them and then get stunned but that's caused by hitboxes not spirit
---
Someone went to the bathroom, went to get a drink, etc. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any deeper than that usually.
---
Because his power isn‚Äôt as good as other killers. Easily looped.
---
As killer while waiting i'm usually spending bloodpoints and sometimes i am not done when the game is found.
---
I remember I was playing against a really good spirt on the meat plant and my friend was about to complete the last gen. Right after I got hit rancor activated allowing me to get on last really good chase in while I let my friends open the door. I ran to closest pallet spawn stuned her and just crouched. She stared at me for a few seconds  then downed and moried me. It turns out he was a really cool person and were friends now : )
---
In terms on scoring. I know some people don't care, but it's something to consider. Personally i'd be ok if moris were limited to certain perks i.e Rancor, devour. I feel like the killer should earn their off hook kills. I digress.
---
This looks familiar ü§î
---
Hmm I feel like killermains would just dodge 100% of the time, I mean look at the responses I'm getting here, people actually agree with this kid that SWF should be removed from the game lmao, I dont think people realize the levels of dumbfuckery that most killermains posess. Extra bloodpoints sounds fun but it basically boils down to "more ebony mori's" which no, actually no.
---
Idk what everyone has been smoking lately, but Huntress, Nurse, and Billy make great use of this perk, especially huntress. Ask any Russian player. 
---
Yes, it's not a game changer all the time, but it's not supposed to be. If you need ruin to combat your opponent, then run ruin. If you can do just fine without 20 seconds of Gen protection, then do literally anything else, including off meta perks like BM.
---
It's a fun perk, and some killers can really take advantage of its power. Just because it doesn't crutch lesser killer players, doesn't mean you can't use it. I believe in you, and you could probably do yourself a lot of good to try out what works for you, instead of listening to mostly salty survivor babies on this sub.
---
One of my proudest faps.
---
Me a David main with an infinitely complex brain: Bow to no mither coward
---
I like knowing where the survivors are at all times and he and he can get your madness up while he‚Äôs being looped
---
At least you enjoyed the BPS and the guy had DH which is still bugged
---
Oh nice, only respect for huntress mains from me.
---
I‚Äôll settle for them getting a cooldown timer that increases with the frequency of dcs (wait 5 minutes to find a new match, then 10, 20, etc.)
---
I wish I got 4ks in my worst games.
---
Killers who can easily locate survivors are some of the worst, mostly because they suffer in chases.
---
I guess somebody was salty about it?
---
It's truly looks like screenshot from the game dude! This is amazing. Have my upvote :D
---
Can we get a Candyman in the game?

---
Somehow saying bad game when you got nearly 30k bps and a 4k is probably not true. While they invested a bunch to counter you seems like in the end you still really did well. Did you pip?
---
? 
---
You got a 4k and got 28k bloodpoint. Couldn‚Äôt have been that bad
---
Being shocked and screaming slightly slows down the survivors

It's really single white female

Or you could do something useful like find noed first or get a gate open or something more productive.

Swinging around on the hook is a signal of the killer camping.

We have done this since the day the game came out, when I got it first. And back then, it was universally understood

The keeper is actually a fucking awesome idea! The Evil Within wasn‚Äôt anything special, but the keeper really resonated with me. Such a cool killer/monster enemy.

I feel like it‚Äôs supposed to play around the fact that in the Entity‚Äôs realm it takes stuff from the real world but all of it is just a bit off. So words and whatnot don‚Äôt look exactly right.

But then I'd have no excuse when I run the killer towards you.

1. They got booted from the game. I‚Äôve been suffering a lot of random disconnects lately that I can‚Äôt help because it‚Äôs the game crashing or freaking out.

2. They thought your secret offering was a mori and quit during loading so they didn‚Äôt have to play against it.
---
Jokes on you, you just cleansed haunted grounds.
---
Nope
---
They helped me put it up.  We all play.  And it is in the suburbs of Charlotte, NC.   The biggest problem is the wife, but I have a second hook that hangs on the back of the real one so it sort of looks like a plant hanging thing.

Props for using a different shot for that meme
---
&gt; I just dislike about BBQ that the killer can see where everyone is, too many times have I been minding my own business and then a teammate gets hooked so I get a billy zipping over to my side of the map. Not to mention, if the killer is smart and notices that only 1 aura shows up when there are 3 alive then he would know that 2 are close. I dislike perks that allow anyone to see auras of anyone but their teammates as I feel like they are kinda cheap
---
But you have plenty of time to hide, get to a pallet, or you could even hide in a locker just before he hooks somebody. Plenty of counter play.
---
&gt; My main annoyance with BBQ though is that its basically a guarantee that someone is running it, like there's no variance of perks basically ever and it kinds sucks :(
---
That's a good point. Probably would be better if they removed the blood points gain from it, and instead gave it automatically to every killers, to see more variety.
---
I take it back, DH was just patched
---
Wait what is the app called for the Apple store?
---
I do both in cycles, right now ive been playing a ton of survivor and reached Rank 4, but I have been wanting to do a lot of killer so I expect for the next month will be mostly killer
---
Sounds like a survivor
---
Good perks don't automatically make you good. Also some Killers like me enjoy being low rank and purposely try to stay there. For example, one policy of mine is to always let the last survivor go after i 4K them.
---
I really like the concept for this killer, but I feel like there are a few things about his power that either need to be tweaked or specified to keep him from being too strong. As I've interpreted from the description, all you need to do to win most any game is set up your suits of armor on generators and run a perk that lets you know which generators are being worked on like surveillance, discordance, or thrilling tremors. You wont stop every single generator from getting done, but getting the last 3 generators done will be a lot more difficult with this killer. 
---
First thing I'd suggest is movement speed. You didnt define it in the post, but I'd say probably 110, but its arguable that he could be 115. Killers with incredible map pressure shouldnt have 115 movement, but Billy would be a decent counter example, and this killer doesnt gave nurse level pressure, so 115 maybe be passable. 
---
Lower the default number of suits of armor. With 5 suits of armor, all you have to do to play the most optimally is set up 3 suits of armor at the 3 most unsafe generators on the map for late game, set up a suit at one of the safe loops like killer shack or an infinite, and then play in your suit as normal. This allows you to play with very minimal skill and still do well, something a lot of people bash on nurse for. I would lower the suits of armor from 5 to 3. This would force you to choose how to divy up your suits of armor. You can still protect the last 3 gens fairly well, but you will have to run strong loops like most other killers, or better run loops but loose the gen protection you would have. You could then have addons that add the amount of suits of armor you have, or even an addon that lowers it from 3 to 2 but also takes away from the ability cool down. 
---
This brings me to my next suggestion, cooldown. 10 seconds seems a little bit much, I'd probably raise it to 15 to 20 seconds. 10 seconds is more than enough time, to push a survivor off of a gen, maybe get a hit, hit the gen, and when all of that is done, teleport to another suit if armor stationed at another gen. Having an increased cooldown time will force you to commit to one suit of armor more meaningfully, making you really choose which suit you want to be in and forcing you to make the decision more tactically. This could also allow for addons that decrease the cooldown, with maybe a UR addon that allows little to no cooldown.
---
Last thing I'd add is a teleport speed/animation. You didnt talk about this in the post, but I want to imagine it was implied. The gist is that you dont want to be able to immediately hop from one suit of armor to another in an instant by default. It would almost guarentee a free hit, or with well positioned armor, a grab. Having even a 3 second animation for the transition would allow survivors some prep time, but not enough to gain a massive lead on you, and would also force them to pay attention to your empty armor when nearby. This could also potentially make for an addon that either makes teleporting instant, or removes the animation, but at the cost of greatly adding to the cooldown timer. 
---
Small aside, I think armor collision might be a bit of a hassle. Having no collision seems dumb and unrealistic, but normal killer collision would make it impossible to get out of the basement or even get in on some maps. Would make for a very fun basement build though. 
---
Love the idea, would love to see it added in game or something similar.
---
Yup, and it really helps agaisnt the doctor to not be found (and other killers)
---

Really cool design! I thought of something like that (not the theme but the thingo with the teleport to static objects) for a long time. I really like what you did there, incredible backstory, cool power and interesting perks! Needs a survivor to go with it tho, you got anything in mind? I mean I really like this concept, I might be able to come up with something that goes along with it if you don't mind (minus the art, I'm bad at that). ;D
---
Like I said, I researched it more and I thought It lasted a lot longer than 4 seconds so that makes my life a whole lot easier :)
---
I‚Äôm down too
---
Thx for your detailed explanation
---
Hindered is slow down iirc, don't think there is one that prevents pallet drops except Carter's Spark.
---
If I use an Ebony, I generally only Mori after I have hooked the survivor twice. 
---
However, waiting till after second hook means the survivor would have been dead on next hook anyway so I gain no real benefit from activating the Mori kill. Just the opportunity to see the animation. 
---
As the game is designed around giving players benefits from perks, items, addons, offerings, I accept that in keeping with this the Mori still needs to give an advantage to playing without it.
---
I think my idea gives a very clear benefit to survivors compared to how it currently  stands. Right now, a killer can hook everyone once and kill them. My idea puts conditions on that. I don't understand how you can see that as making it WORSE for survivors?
---
It does not make late game any worse than it already is with an Ebony Mori in play. On the contrary it increases the chances for survivors to actually get to end game with an Ebony Mori in play. 
---
It also forces a killer to continue to play 'normally' and hook survivors for a second and even third time IF not enough gens are completed.
---
I think it is fairly generous to the survivor without taking too much away from the killer.
---
It‚Äôs the game crashing. First time the game would just not load and showed that I DCd. Another game I was playing and my console turned off immediately without warning.
---
&gt;wait out NOED

That‚Äôs... not how that works

Turn off your music when you play DbD. You'll miss out on audio cues that'll save your ass. i.e. Myers' breathing.
---
Yes but that means you need to get past the early game of the killer seeing you and let your team die. I don‚Äôt see how this requires a nerf.
---
Why is this a gif!
---
Wow I never knew that. Now I wish I got that screen more often lol

Losing points for survivors healing is truly baffling to me. Am I wrong that when a survivor bodyblocks you when carrying another survivor and you hit them, you both lose emblem points for wounds healed AND "chase lost"?
---
If there was a Stranger Things chapter, this would be perfect for it
---
Please dont fucking do this, i lost 12k of blood points because of a salty ass huntress who dced in the last minute before me and my team could reach the gate. You killer mains complain so much about toxic survivors, but you forget that the oposite exists too.

I'd rather just put myself on the hook than deal with this
---
During a 3v1, just have one person loop while the 2 others pound the last 2 gens together. The repair speed is way faster with teammates (:
---
Bond + kindred is kinda abligatory to me, kindred so I don't get first hook as the 3 others are doing gens hoping "someone is already going" and bons because I kill my team mates too much during chases where I lead the killer to them
---
I suppose that makes sense, just never seen it before
---
I bet she could tear a hole through the time/space continuum with that scream.
---
You destroyed them, and they were lower rank then you. Idk what the issue is, and where they countered your perks.
---
If they all had botany knowledge, cleansed your totem, and someone ran Ooo while spying on you, then maybe they countered you.
---
Overall, you had a good match with a lot of tension and required a lot of pressure, but that's how it's supposed to be. Anything else is a stomp for 1 side.
---
Idk shes incredibly unfun to play against imo. If you don‚Äôt have ironwill and are injured you‚Äôre pretty much screwed if the spirit is half decent.
---

No and I'm glad I didn't. I also read that BNP's insta-completed generators which is equally ridiculous.

But changing things for the better is always a good thing, and some things need changing more than once before you find they're in the right place.

DEMOGORGON KILLER CONFIRMED
---
I‚Äôm a surv main. But if I‚Äôm bloodpoints hunting.  Killer is the way to go.
---
I think it's on spotify
---
Why are you so salty? Who actually cares it's for one game????
---
Thing is - totems, traps and other "items" all fall under the "Killer's possessions" category, so this wouldn't make much sense.
---
Also, it feels a bit too tailored for the Zealot himself.
---
I believe perks should be equally applicable to any killer and their powers, while this would have no effect whatsoever on most, symptom of bad design.
---
On a positive note though, big fan of the power üòÅ I can see it working, even tho new Freddy teleporting ability is kinda the same thing
---
I would do that if I found games quicker
---
‚Äúwait out noed‚Äù ?
---
If they ever have a hotline miami crossover this should be used for the trailer
---
Actually he was really popular playing Mortal Kombay before DBD, DBD just made gain some decent amount but he was by no means struggling
---
It is the point, however, it makes the game go "too fast" for Killers, so it is frowned upon.  If you pop 3 gens in the first 2 minutes before anyone is hooked it is a crime against humanity. Lol. I understand the frustration because I play killer at times and seeing gens pop off can be intimidating, but I live by the killer motto of I don't give a shit.  If I can't get them before they start all the gens then I'm just not good enough yet.  At least they had fun and survived.
---
PTB kate‚Äôs voice was good, just the scream was over the top...

Imagine writing an essay over a game.

Right. Those toxic survivors, trying to win games.

If you are able to buy and level up Jeff, he has a perk called Distortion that blocks your aura from being shown up to 3 times during the round. So it is great if you want to play stealthy and counter BBQ. Also gives your some valuable information (knowing if the killer is running BBQ, Nurses Calling, Bitter Murmur, etc).

Yeah I don't know, it's a really hard thing to balance I don't even try to think about it.
---
Lol deleted.
---
Its empty as hell lol it had carrots in it this morning
---
Max out that deviousness
---
Sounds pretty great, thanks for letting me know! Just now gotta figure out which perk I'd drop for it, I quite like my current setup...
---
Because you are using a secret offering and assume it's a mori.
---
But dude, don't use shroud of separation, it sucks, it helps survivors more than it helps you
---
If your friend JUST got this tattoo, why have I seen this picture on Instagram years ago?

I gotta give credit to the guys at /r/memetemplatesofficial. They have a stickied post with all the Endgame memes in HD with the correct shots. I didn't realize the normal template was the wrong line.
---
i want the myers mask when it still looked like william shatner
---
Check your PM
---
Honestly I play with me friend from time to time and he is rank 16, (I‚Äôm usually rank 8-4)it‚Äôs not just to rank up, we just like to play together and Ive been playing for years and he just isn‚Äôt very good lol. 
---
But I will say we go against some rank 10 that destroy us still.
---
theres a difference between stalking and just standing when he stands still?
---
Thanks for the feedback. For survivor perks, I really didn't know what to do, since in the movie, Hallie doesn't do anything special, she just cries when a friend of her dies and avoids Slenderman just by sheer luck. The only other survivor I could have thinked of was one of the girls from the Slenderman stabbing in Wisconsin back in 2014, but they were too young. And there isn't anyone else that stands out in Slenderman's lore.
---
Roses are red, blueberries are blue, you are lying.
---
That‚Äôd be absolutely amazing. Jacket as a killer that sees the world in bright neon colors besides survivors being russians in bright white suits. Manny Pardo as a survivor because he is innocent, shoot the killer in the foot and run away, survive one hit thanks to your thick skin.
---
I know what you mean. For the first few months after I started, all I cared about was reaching rank 1. Now I tend to hover in purple or green ranks just because I dont try to hard. 
---
And seeing that depip does always suck, but in my mind I'm good as long as I dont derank too far back. And the only reason for that is that I want the game to be fair, and putting technically a purple ranked survivor up against yellow ranks isnt what I want to do
---
Ah yes, you are one of them. Move on dickhead.
---
I‚Äôve been practicing that but there‚Äôs a pause in my movement as I transition between A &amp; S. Should I go around using W&amp;S like I‚Äôd spin a thumb stick?
---
I mean... you can use... just not against me and apparently there are more people with the same mindset. Moris are extremely unfun for everyone involved (except for the killer) and very rarely the killers don't play like cunts by proxy camping and immediately removing you from the game.
---
Yes,  you lot notice his very mild head tilt when he‚Äôs staring.
---
They would have to widen the matchmaking with regards to rank/location. Or provide more incentive for people to play survivor. I‚Äôd personally prefer the extra incentive or widening rank mm but the latter probably wouldn‚Äôt be fun for lower ranks.
---
Yes, you not notice his head tilt when he‚Äôs stalking?
---
You got level 65 in a month? How many hours a day you play? Xp is earned by match time
---
How?
---
that was obviously her friend posting the picture of his new tattoo! /s
---
Oh my God you guys! I reposted this!
---
With the title being "which one of you did this?"
---
He's so fun though and easy to counter but some baby ass niggas always wanna complain
---
Whose a good doctor? Whose a good doctor? You are! You are!
---
This newspaper has always been on the Haddonfield map since is inception. As a matter of fact, there are a few 'easter eggs' like this in the game. You just have to stop and look instead of playing as intended
---
You shouldn't judge, they just have terrible hemorrhoids they're trying to itch.
---
It should be working now. At least mine is
---
Bruh if you play Legion you the big dumb
---
Exactly! Who reads titles anyways.
---
If you're pausing then you are killing momentum, the best way I can say to prevent is to practice switching between the needed movement keys to keep a good running line
---
You made a small mistake. The Instructions add-on improves your Toolbox' repair efficiency by 20%, not 15%. ^[[1]](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Instructions)
---
Thank you papa
---
No problem op but do remember not every killer needs a survivor since we‚Äôve gotten a chapter in the past which was just a killer (Ghostface chapter) and if he‚Äôs not a chapter he could just be a ‚Äúparagraph‚Äù since that‚Äôs what the devs call characters released mid chapter and have no survivor or map.
---
If you have a phone, install something like solitaire on it. Keeps me entertained.
---
Steve buscemi lookin ass cat
---
It's a counter to Borrowed Time, and also makes defending hooks easier, since you can "fake" a chase and return for some easy downs.
---
If you were going to meme it out though, you could combine it with Remember Me in order to get full stacks from the first hook (hit Obsession, down Obsession, let the save happen, repeat, you are now max). That second hook would give you a total of -8 to your Terror Radius *during a chase*.
---
That -8 would cancel out the increase from Monitor &amp; Abuse, if you were running it, but even if you're not you're still talking about being able to fake a chase and make survivors think you're further away than you actually are. 
---
Now let's say you're running No One Escapes Death - congratulations, you're moving faster, you have instadown, there's a whole world of mindgames during the chase because your Terror Radius is tiny, and opening the gate will take 36 seconds. Plenty of time to handle any loose ends.
---
Top tier? Not really. Should be fun on a meme build, though.
---
Lightweight is OP
---
"Survive friends with" haha guys I so funn knee I say that because he misspelled it haha! Me funny! Very funny guy haha!
---
Still not for me
---
DC * 4
---
This newspaper has always been around way before these new maps. This can not be true. There are many Easter eggs in this game like the hidden toolboxes on the map or the warning sign on the game map. 
---
Oh and just throwing it out there for anyone interested.... anyone ever consider that the flickering lights on haddonfield weren't morse code?
---
The mori's are to punish you, not be fair
---
That's good!! At least you were able to find a new main, right?
---
No mither tho
---
Some people even DC to give the last guy hatch.
---
That's the Survivor logic though you as a killer better play as their rules or you are not going to get to play.
---
2 kills 1 dc and last one escapes from hatch? De-pipped
---
Nurse counters SWF
---
Noed should be base, and always active when gates are powered or open. Make the game harder, why not?
---
The fact that it can NOT be in the killers build sometimes, or countered at other times, seems to have made people think it needs nerfs/buffs, when it should just be base. Same for adrenaline.
---
Many perks should have been straight buffs to the game, but they were made into perks, like buckle up, bamboozle, mattle of man (current), new Kindred, beast of prey, overcharge, etc.
---
/s btw
---
Don't really care but okay.
---
Bubba needs it more
---
When you assume everyone is swf but really you‚Äôre just garbage at the game

"Game over"
---
Lithe, quick +Quiet, and Dance With Me form the ultimate stealth build.
---
Lovingly refered to as "The Houdini Build", you break line of site and vanish without a trace.
---
This is what a guilty person who ran out if arguments looks like
---
Problem is you're caring too much about your rank which is why everybody get so upset when they lose. I get caught up in this myself but if it's a mix up it will make it funner for everyone, also there is no true reward for being high rank which is why I stopped caring about that.

The 2 most important tips I can give you are:
---
1. Learn the maps. Knowing where really strong loops and infinites are and trapping them is very essential when playing trapper. You always want to trap things like the killer shack, the cow tree, infinite windows like the Ironworks of misery one etc.
---
2. Don't place traps in the pallet itself but rather on the loop. Good survivors will check and disarm your traps if you place them in obvious spots like in the pallet itself. You want to place traps in the grass of the loop to keep it hidden and undetected. Even Good survivors don't expect this and fall for it

What a timeless comment, u/blindniggababy

Daring today aren't we
---
It takes way longer taking a screenshot like this than just pressing print screen and copy pasting it.
---
This is kind of a wonky build but what I like to do is run Furtive Chase, Make Your Choice, Dying Light And Devour Hope. Like a normal dying light game, I run my obsession down early and hook them but after the first rescue, Furtive and MYC go off and my new obsession is now the major threat. 
---
 By the time I rotate my obsession and Devour Hope goes off, everyone is in a tighter spot because with my obsession on the hook, there‚Äôs a constant threat level to save them because of Dying Light but also no one wants to save them because of Devour Hope.
---
True.
---
The majority of SWF aren't a problem, they're just a bunch of Bros who want to play the game together.
---
Most of the time you run into SWF, you don't realize it without looking
---
They're on the right path by making some positive changes to increasing survivor bp gain, like increasing bp for staying alive longer and for totem cleanses. Widening rank mm would probably further deter survivors from playing, as they would be annoyed playing against far better killers.
---
A meme...

Sounds like a killler. Gen rushing is just doing the gens.

If you use Mother-Daughter Ring you can love as fast as Billy‚Äôs chainsaw with total control over it
---
Wraith is pretty fun for me to play with and against as long as he isn't running scummy add ons.
---
That‚Äôs my conundrum. Someone was trying to get me to switch out Self Care for Adrenaline. But I don‚Äôt enjoy making so much noise through out a game when avoiding a killer with the hopes Adrenaline will save me at the end of the match. Adrenaline is great when you can use it, but feels like a wasted slot when the killer hears my groans and gets me through out the match.
---
Is there another thing they can work on to help them win? Or do they change it somehow to make it unfair?
---
I think my favorite Freddy movie is dream warriors or Freddy vs Jason but there was this one nightmare on the elm street where it was mainly just the protagonist and her daughter. That one was really good to but I can‚Äôt remember the name.

I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt see ur giant iron ball sac

This is why iron will is great. Or take a medkit/have a teammate heal you.
---
His power depends on survivors, and we know how other killers fare when their power depend on survivors.
---
This is not happening should be connected with resiliance
---
Real fucking original. With people putting effort and continuing with the argument even after he gets downvoted, how dare you post such a pathetic reply? Have you no shame?

But I wouldn't be able to decide what to give up for it. Lullaby maybe? I've gotten it to five stacks maybe a handful of times anyway. Or maybe a direct upgrade to distressing?

I don't necessarily agree that the game is a dying community, there's been a steady increase in average players for awhile. Incase you didn't already know, there is an official [Dead by Daylight discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/deadbydaylight) where people can discuss the game and find people to join SWF lobbies in their language/location.
---
You'll definitely have to get used to Ruin and BBQ until the devs change some things. In high rank games, survivors are smart and do gens while the killet is distracted, resulting in 2 or 3 gens popping for one person on hook. Ruin is mandatory on slow/weak killers to counter this.
---
BBQ is the answer to a really shitty grind mechanic. It takes millions of BP to max 1 killer. Like actually millions, no exaggeration. BBQ doubles the BP a killer gets. So until the grind becomes easier, people will always run it.
---
And as for always seeing Wraith, Billy, Doc, and Bubba, most of those killers become less popular at higher ranks due to their weaker powers and poor performance in chases. Pretty much only Billy will remain in your games if you climb and you'll see a lot of Spirit. Hag and Huntress have pretty obvious flaws and weaknesses that make them less popular, but they'll be ran more than Doc and Wraith for sure the higher you climb. Again, you'll see * a lot of Spirit* at higher ranks. She's the 2nd best killer under Nurse and a bit easier for most players.
---
But most killers have the same issue with survivor perk builds. Almost always see Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike in every game. Lack of perk viability is a serious issue this game has. Most survivor/killer perks are useless.
---
Urban with spine "pussy" chill pepelaugh. Im not surprise
---
No, they are not "often" toxic. Unless your definition of toxic is killing survivors.
---
I might be crazy but I feel like they changed it up to where it‚Äôs not as noticeable. Was trying to play mind games with a face camping Myers and all the while I was fake grabbing the hook he was just stalking. Don‚Äôt worry I called myself dumb. Lol
---
Yeah, they could of just had the voice actor re-do the screams, as she works at BHVR like most of the voice actors, not re-do the whole voice with another BHVR employee.
---
Unless I‚Äôm in SWF, I don‚Äôt like to rely on a teammate to heal. I saw your comment on Iron Will and I might use it now to see how it goes.
---
It means the charges in the toolbox will deplete slower. Like 1 charge of the toolbox will repair more of the gen with efficiancy than without. It makes your toolbox last longer
---
We need another saw movie. With the original actress playing Amanda.

Survivor but I love playing as spirit sadly I'm rank 15 and I feel bad when I decimate survivors that are queuing at those ranks. But then I get the random rank 2 that wrecks my whole ass and I don't feel so bad. But those queue times.....

I love you, Doctor! I‚Äôm a doctor main and you‚Äôre my favorite DBD character!!!!!!

When you can last longer vs the killer than you can in bed
---
I never said he hosted? Wtf is your problem dude lmao.
---
I ‚Äúhost‚Äùcause I have the best internet, pull your head out of your ass.
---
Besides it doesn‚Äôt matter who ‚Äúhosts‚Äù a SWF it goes upon the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of the ranks. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why people like you have to lie and make shit up to prove that they are right.
---
The simple fact here is you are being an asshole, just cause people play together doesn‚Äôt make them assholes, it makes them friends. 
---
And you are gatekeeping by telling people how to play a game ‚Äúyour way‚Äù so get out of here with that toxic shit lol.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt work with swf either though. Too much of a waste of time.
---
Is that a personal attack or something?
---
While not ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù, my go to legion build is centered around slowing down the game as much as I can.
---
Thanataphobia: with each injured survivor, survivor repair speed is slower. Feral frenzy will make it easy to injure many survivors at once
---
Sloppy Butcher: Thanataphobia will make survivors wanna heal more than they already do, double their healing time only to make them injured again easily with feral frenzy
---
Ruin: staple perk for slowing down the early game and making gen rushing a bit harder
---
Pop Goes the Weasel: 25% gen regression always feels good.
---
This comes with two scenarios, survivors either heal themselves whenever they can and slow the game down to a crawl, or they leave themselves injured, making it easier to down them.
---
Addons I run are:
---
Cold Dirt / Joeys Mix Tape: less stun time makes it easier to catch survivors
---
Stolen Sketch Book / Mural Sketch: Longer Feral Frenzy Duration makes injuring multiple survivors easier
---
Love to join! Post or dm me a link.

Tbh I go through my phone and I hear the noise when I find a lobby and I‚Äôll completely forget I was playing the game lol
---
I was making a joke and people took me seriously. In retrospect, probably should have said "Blood Warden"
---
BHVR PLEASE
---
When Noob3 was being chased by The Pig for 20 minutes while Claudette did only one gen
---
Maybe he was just stalking before you got there? And that‚Äôs why it seemed that way? 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know. I haven‚Äôt come across a Myers in quite a while now that I think about it. 
---
That would be a nice buff if he kept his head still whilst stalking though.
---
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaa*
---
I‚Äôll send it over as soon as I can (I need to re-copy it and it‚Äôs being buggy)
---
Happens so often when I'll be running a killer around, eventually get hooked. One gen done (if lucky) and for some reason they are crouched around the outside of the map. Like...guess I'll die?
---
My GF plays casually, but never plays killer (except to puke on people with Plague, lol),
---
So, when her dailies get flooded with killer quests, I step in and do them for her.
---
Every once in a while I start to feel like the survivors are working too well together, and none of them are afraid, so I go from derping around like the rank 15 she is, to full red ranks hardcore beast mode. 
---
Last time it was a 3man swf and a random, but they were all at about 2-3k hours and 2 were rank 2.
---
It felt good to stop them. They shouldn't be down there being bullies to low rank killers that just want some fun and excitement.
---
No one besides the people at BHVR have any idea when cosmetics are coming out sadly.
---
What‚Äôs supposed to be happening
---
Are you brazilian?
---
Big brain here probably running no mither + self care the only good build
---
Those stats are so shit. I would've loved if they did them by rank. I'm sure a rank 20 sfw isn't as skilled as a rank 1 swf. And if you add up every ranks sfw you end up with that shit.
---
I feel like people like this who only play survivor lack the understanding that Killer and survivor are both working against a time crunch. Survivors time to do objectives vs killers. When you play killer enough, you quickly realize that you need to work fast to get everyone before gens are finished, then you understand how important it is to get things done ASAP as survivor. Survivor mains just don't see the time crunch and blame the killer or teammates for having a bad game.
---
So true survivors are so useless in this game it's mind boggling. People act like they can't destroy totems like ruin. Survivors don't care about the actual game or their teammates. Just points and themselves but they don't destroy totems???
---
No. Doing gens is the main objective. If they want more blood points they can stop to break a lit or unlit totem. Or open a chest. ‚ÄúGen rushing‚Äù is bullshit.
---
when full healed you don't have more speed?
---
Doc said Michael Myers!
---
This is Michael Myers!
---
Yep, and [Rebecca Caldwell](https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_Caldwell) seems to be a character from Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Dead Zone.‚Äô She‚Äôs a psychiatrist who becomes romantically involved with the protagonist, Johnny Smith, who is afflicted with disturbing visions and who eventually predicts a nuclear disaster in Washington D.C. (thus the mushroom cloud?).
---
Also, if i recall correctly, Nurse wasn't amongst the most lethal killers, if they did it by rank. I'm pretty sure she would be number 1 on red ranks.
---
I was a rank 19 or 20 killer and everyone was between ranks 6-12
---
I'm still climbing ranks and don't yet trust my team to hit skill checks
---
Killer can be overwhelming when you first get into it but you just have to not give a fuck about kills or not just think ‚Äúhooks‚Äù and ‚Äúdowning survivors‚Äù and if survivors are being particularly persistent about getting a hex totem you can kind of monkey guard it for free hits. It‚Äôs gets a lot simpler when you get some experience and you start thinking smarter not harder. Usually you can tell who is a smart killer when they‚Äôre not camping as a crutch because honestly there are so many things you can camp besides a hooked survivor.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been having this issue too often lately. Sucks too if you‚Äôre doing SWF and someone has to leave but then you have this issue with the other friend you‚Äôre playing with so you have to stop playing.
---
Pig and wraith don't actively gain advantage by camping, and myers is easy to spot and has a terror radius. Ghostface is the only one that can almost completely avoid being spotted *and* gain one shot power from that specifically.
---
Obvs camping all game is bad, but I've seen occasional camping used on ghostface to great effect, which is what I am pointing out.
---
I had played it before like a year ago but barely. I was like level 15 when I quit.
---
I don't think so, it kinda looks like it cause ya limping when injured but it probably not the case.
---
You found me out
---
*nice*
---
Will you make Pastel Perks?
---
It's so unfair to new players and even players who might be sensitive. They don't consider these are real people they're deliberately trying to upset. Speaking from experience I've had days where I've been badly depressed and used gaming as a means to take the edge off only to be harassed by a SWF group and then flamed in the post-game chat, told I don't deserve to be a gamer and similar things. If anyone doesn't deserve to be a gamer it's people who misuse online gaming as a means of bullying, and of people they don't know anything about. Where's the decency? I've had a few Killers who got down that they did badly in matches but said it's nothing to worry about and they'll get better and run into people of similar skill to them. Honestly, I can't stand the toxic side of online gaming where trashing strangers is supposedly fun. On the plus side it's not all bad as I've actually made some good friends through Dead By Daylight matches where either Killers or Survivors added me on Steam and got talking. That's really what gaming should contribute to, people making friends and having fun not being made to feel crap about themselves.

I really like the idea of Penny in DbD. It always pissed me off to hear people ask for him in MK.
---
I mean, there is always the possibility of it being Devour Hope, and it can allow for some ridiculous snowballs if it sticks around. If we are facing a Spirit tho, it's 99% gonna be HG, so anybody who cleanses deserves a colonoscopy by the Doctor.
---
Yeah I see what you mean, it makes me sad that people are using the stealthiest killer in the game to camp when that‚Äôs probably the thing he excels the least at.

I think it‚Äôs because ghostfaces vary wildly from one another, his skill floor is pretty average but he has a really high skill ceiling, on one hand you can get a camper POS like that/ one tries to play Myers as GF and is constantly being pulled out of his ability, and on the other hand you could get a God ghostface that uses Claudette‚Äôs power to blend into the shadow realm and is everywhere at once.
---
I don't care how bad you are of a survivor or a killer, if you unplug your internet just quit the game
---
Nice dude!
---
I prefer
---
Commodious + Wire Spool + Instructions.
---
Not the fastest, but it lasts for something like 3 gens. 4 if you use Streetwise.
---
Thank you, /u/BobRossGod
---
It's already averaged and no killer should have to endure a disadvantage (of playing with a higher rank) just because you want to play with your friends.
---
They still haven't fixed the bug for when you can't leave the trial
---
Yup I got reported after I downed a tbagger near shed. Once I started moonwalking to the shed with his body as Bubba he Dc'd  and sent me rage , red rank to üòÇ
---
Then bring a Med-kit. It heals at the very least twice as fast as Self-care. Keep in mind how much time Self-care wastes - at minimum 32 seconds, and with Sloppy Butcher more than 40 seconds. That's _half_ of an entire generator. It's an insane amount of wasted time that even a Toolbox can't make up. It's seriously a much better idea to bring a med-kit or Bond to find a teammate to heal you.
---
Oh yes instead of cleansing that devour hope I will go around the whole map making sure that it's the only lit totem, wasting more time than risking haunted grounds, instead of just cleansing it and doing gens.
---
Laurie always reminds me of angry ape when you take away its food.
---
It's funny to come back into this game after a while and seeing people like playing killer now. When I left the game literally no one played killer and killer queues were almost instant, that was the reason why I left. Playing killer was extremely unfun.
---
Yeah. Ok.
---
*ahem*
---
You cheated, rank 15s aren't this good, you're purposely dropping your rank to bully new survivors, did you use wall hacks, what a sweaty perk build, wow using a green add-on at rank 15 what a try hard, using ruin and thrill oh so I guess that's how shitty killers get 4ks, Plague shouldn't use corruption even though we all washed our dirty faces in your pools 0.2 seconds about being hit with puke, you shouldn't check lockers when you're rank 15 or lower lol noob
---
*5 minutes post game, they add you on Steam and say mean things about your sexuality and your mother*
---
Yeet beat banana feet
---
i recently got to rank 3 killer after like 340 hours and its so cancer that you have to check survivors accounts to see if there an swf because they're basically impossible at red ranks
---
Very awesome concept, but deus vult is broken
---
It's a meme.
---
Survive with friends, a group playing together with comms
---
Killer, because teammates are braindead.
---
Bloodlust may deny a loop, so it 6 seconds earlier seems pretty good. But maybe do 2 seconds for each generator completed might be a good idea
---
I don't care if you are calling me out!
---
Every killer has the same lunge. Freddy and Pig are small and both have short weapons, which makes hits look awkward sometimes.
---
Yeah I made it darker and the shadows more dramatic. And of course added the light on my hand. But besides that it‚Äôs all the lights! :D
---
If you've considered this ever than go play overwatch because they need more reasons to leave
---
Nah I'm sure they did those just to add a bit more content. Several survivors are taken by the Entity are sacrificing themselves in their world and die or nearly die. Since Bill in canon in L4D, it makes the most sense why Bill is chosen.

Not only that, but when I‚Äôm playing with unknowns and it gets disconnected you lose the items you had. It‚Äôs total bullshit.
---
No problem! The game is really fun though I definitely would advise against prestiging characters because all it gives is a bloody outfit piece. Besides, better cosmetics exist in the shop. 
---
And I saw that you mentioned you don't play much killer, and I think you're missing out. You learn a lot about what good survivors do by facing them as a killer, and that'll help you as a survivor. It also helps you understand killers and how they work, what their weaknesses are by playing them. It also helps you establish a more fair mindset about what's strong and what's weak. It's not fair or honest to say something is weak/strong if you only play *versus* it and never play *as* it. And killers are just as guilty of it as survivors.
---
These guys weren‚Äôt playing toxic. They were just really altruistic. I understand this is annoying, but that is how you are supposed to use a flashlight.
---
Honestly, the one thing that drew me to DbD early in was several misunderstandings.
---
First, I thought there was no communication or group-forming, so it had a Dark Souls kind of feel to it, which I loved. I thought SWF was some kind of LAN-only thing.
---
Second, I kept playing survivor and running into killers who let people farm. Then I'd play and sometimes win, sometimes lose (admittedly at low ranks) and I post-game chat was strangely polite.
---
So I thought, wow, just a fun game where people run around, can't communicate much anyway, but they try their best. And since it's asymmetrical it's not meant to be competitive, and people know that, so there's more of a laid back atmosphere.
---
Good God I was wrong, but those initial games were amazing.
---
If it glows it goes
---
That was my first achievement. I was a very lucky baby dwit
---
Some people think BNP is actually worse than certain toolbox combos because of how charges are not contributed while BNP is active. You aren't contributing charges while using BNP.
---
I think there was more but I can't remember what it was...
---
He didn‚Äôt body block or actually trap them, the only way for them to get up is risk getting hit by the chainsaw, he‚Äôs not doing anything wrong and it isn‚Äôt bannable.

U dont get so you ? Nice is used in combo with 69

scope?
---
Bond.  The easiest way to sand bag your fellow survivors.
---
Cant shake that M+A Myers?  Dump him on your unsuspecting allies doing gens!
---
God damn and I thought the ghostface skins were too bright already
---
"It's already averaged" (3+3+4+9)/4=8? Haha nice joke.
---
(3+3+4+9)=4.75, not 8... That's how averages work.
---
Pretty much. :/ I ran into a group with two 20's and two purples the other day. Now I've never EVER intentionally de-ranked but I let my friend play on my account so I'm up in the 15's again (barf). I dont go hard unless I can tell you came in to bully. It's funny when you play a rank 15 against purple/red ranks how they change their toxic tune when they dont get to flashlight blind, loop, and teabag me the entire game while running 3 DS, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, 2 instaheals, a key and a purple flashlight. 
---
Like fuck you. You came here to be a piece of shit and you know it.
---
Imagine being so trash at the game the only way you can win is by making it literally impossible for your opponents to play.
---
i got reported for downing people swarming the hook as if thats a valid method of play, they kept going for the unhook  0.3 seconds after i left the hook and already downed another survivor
---
I ran him a fair bit to get the adept achievement, and he isn't a bad killer. First of all, regarding trap placement, there are multiple popular locations to place them, and they are popular because THEY WORK. You know, stuff like the Killer Shack window, the basement, this kind of area. The survivor might often expect a trap there, but during a chase, there is not much he can do besides just hoping there isn't one. Sure, sometimes traps might be disarmed, and SWF groups might get to bully you hard, but don't be afraid to place a couple of traps in popular locations.
---
You should also try and trap less common locations. Random windows a survivor might vault through at some point in the game, patches of grass within potential loops, etc. Always try and place them within tall grass, they are usually not that hard to spot otherwise, especially once the survivors realise they are up against a Trapper and start double-checking the ground.
---
Trapper is extremely strong if you can 3-gen survivors in an easily defensible location. He is also ridiculously strong if you can play around the basement. Generally if the last 3 gens are near the Shack, and the basement is within it, odds are you've won. Have a few traps around the basement and shack, and a few more next to pallets and loops near it, and any non-SWF team will probably crumble. 
---
If you aren't running the add-on that insta-downs whoever steps on a trap, then just hit them once to make sure they are downed, and don't be afraid to slug them for a bit while you are looking for the rest of them. Also, don't be afraid to re-trap locations where a trap has been disarmed, provided nobody can see you. There will be many occasions where someone within the SWF group will announce that they disarmed a trap somewhere, and the rest of the group will automatically assume that the area is now safe to run through without even bothering to look. On the match where i got my Adept, i literally trapped all 4 of them at least once each with the same trap on the shack window, because they all assumed i wouldn't be placing a trap again at the same spot.
---
Last but not least, try to never engage in a chase without carrying any traps. If someone tries to loop you, you can just pretend to place one down, and they'll usually just abandon said loop immediately. You can use this to completely break popular loops and funnel them into areas where you've already got other traps set and waiting for them.
---
Overall, Trapper needs a lot of gamesense to play correctly. Know where survivors will usually go and which routes they will take, place some traps in these routes, and try to force a 3-gen or a basement strat. If you play your cards right, Trapper can snowball immensely well, when you've got 1 or 2 guys hooked and the rest trapped.
---
He body blocked them and held the game hostage.
---
City slicker clothing with the bloody default mask? Op is a man of culture!
---
How come? I said survivors that are potato are better on a hook, not survivors that actually know how to be useful.....
---
Because without self care I never would escape any trials. Always get idiot team mates trying to heal you right next to the hook they saved you on...
---
Amazing. Props to you
---
I meant to reply to the thread above me, where you said 3-4 man squads are toxic no matter what. 
---
I‚Äôm on console and I play every day, if I‚Äôm feeling particularly cheated by what appears to be a SWF I will check. Most people screen cap videos of DBD and it‚Äôs easy to see who they are playing with. 5/10 it‚Äôs not a SWF, it‚Äôs just a group of solo players who worked really well together. (Surprisingly cause every time I get in a match as a solo survivor my team mates leave me on the hook until stage two and then just run away instead of healing me. I‚Äôm rank 4 &amp; you‚Äôd really think the survivors would be more altruistic at that rank but noooo) that‚Äôs why I enjoy playing SWF though because I know my team will help me.
---
20 is actually not bad at all.
---
Of course, even a good veteran player makes mistakes and messes up DH. But I was refering to potatos that actually play very bad even on high rank. What use do you have of someone just sneaking around and not doing gens, not keeping the killer in a chase and not unhooking you?
---
Dude, he's literally blocking the only exit. That's a fucking doorway at the top of the stairs, survivors can't get past him period.
---
I was called a cunt, to "blow it (my gg) our my ass", and sweaty, among other things.
---
The best part was when they started fighting with each other and I left the lobby open for a few minutes to let them. Lol
---
It‚Äôs chainsaw time
---
From another thread, it was mentioned that there will be an update where you can leave the match with them no matter what. So I‚Äôm guessing another nerf is coming.
---
If they run, they don't get heals. I got gens to do. If they want heals after running, they can follow me to the gen.
---
How do you have more fps than 62?
---
I figured it was an obvious /s but here we are
---
I have no idea why I keep commenting instead of replying. This is the second time, I need to get it together LOL
---
Oh no shit, Sherlock. Average isn't taken literally genius, the system will simply put it somewhere in between their levels.
---
Why would you enjoy losing?
---
With number 5 I think you mean don‚Äôt attempt escape.
---
I'm rank 1 killer and rank 16 surv, soooo...
---
You gotta put that /s on there, because there are people this fucking stupid on here.
---
I just checked my Steam and there's a 52.9 MB patch downloading. Probably just some bug fixes.
---
There is definitely the stealth advantage of bloody clothing. Bill, Jake, and Claudette have the most stealthy prestiged clothing. 
---
Be warned though, P3 Claudette is seen as toxic by 90% of the entire playerbase. 
---
Survivors hate her for being an absolute coward. Hiding from the killer and never doing gens. Using Self-care, which wastes a *massive* amount of time instead of being helpful or just getting healed by a teammate. 
---
Killers hate her because it's impossible to see her. Like actually impossible. They need to turn up the brightness on their game by a massive margin to have a chance.
---
i maintain a level 10 but anytime i start going purple rank i get bombarded with red rank swf and lose my pips regardless of how well i did
---
I feel good if I can just escape the killer. :)
---
I guess it comes down to the interpretation of "potato". In my mind it means trying to do things and doing them poorly. What you're talking about just sounds like a lack of teamwork and willingness to help.
---
Are.. are you insulting yourself?
---
I know the feeling. I discovered how fun billy was 5 months ago, and ohhhhhhh it‚Äôs great
---
Yup. I think City Slicker looks the closest to the original Ghostface outfit. Also the ribbon's on the default, as cool as they are can give you away.
---
I love shitting on people with my aggressive Bubba build, so satisfying when the end chat is filled with salt from survivors who thought they were going to bully a killer. Rank 10 btw lol
---
Xbox got it to but it‚Äôs 1.5 GB. Probably bug fixes
---
Bug fixes to Sprint Burst, Dead Hard and Fred.
---
No, it‚Äôs what hag excels at. Put on make your choice for extra salt points
---
Nice, well digging this.
---
Go to Achievements, Dead by Daylight and than stats.
---
No. I mean people that say your /s and actually mean it.
---
Thanks a ton
---
That's the struggle. üò¨
---
People don't understand, and I can't get why because it feels so obvious, that this is 100% a game of time management. I count my killer early games in the ratio of hooks before first gen or gen progress by first hook. Every second counts, as survivor and killer, if your opponent is skilled.
---
Unless your whole team goes full Metal Gear, the more time you spend Urban Evasioning around the map jacking off looking for totems and items you don't need, the more of your most precious time resources (hooks and pallets) you lose to people being picked off.
---
Yeah I agree with both of those points, I just hit prestige 2 on ghosty and while it‚Äôs cool, the default outfit is just too... grey? Something about it is off, it just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me.
---
A victory to me is pipping, not so much escaping.
---
EAC will not reverse.  That's why they warn you.
---
They have many games to monitor and many cases.  Its fiscally unreasonable to expect them to go through each case, also it's very hard to catch cheaters.
---
It's a risk you have to be willing to take.  That said I've been given no reason to think these will fail, you'll never know what updates can bring.
---
To me it's not worth it.  Losing DbD isn't terrible but I would not want the mark of the beast on my steam profile.
---
Yeah I can hear it in my nightmares
---
''no-toxicity policy'' 
---
LMAO good luck
---
Just guard the generators on the street and in the middle house. They will eventually 3 gen themselves.
---
Was playing Wraith on the swamp. Got a co-ordinated team of SWF who were all red ranks (I was rank 6). They had 4 tool-boxes. They finished 2 generators within couple of minutes with ruin still up. I played extremely fair (no camping, tunneling) but sweaty (slugging when I had to). By the time exit gates were powered I had 2 hooked everyone. I kill one before the gates were open. A David tried to bully me by running the shack in front of the exit gate. I smack him once, he thought he could t-bag me before exiting but I had 8 stacks for STBFL so I smacked him again instantly. Sacrificed him as well. One of the best games I played. Really had fun even though I black pipped (just missed the pip). Got a message later from the David on PS4 saying I am a sweaty killer and some choice words for me. I was having fun but was annoyed after that. Such is DBD.
---
Yet still a rank average of 4.75 shouldn't be match with an 8. That's the problem here. Because if you matched with the highest player and let's say it was 3 rank 4s and 1 rank 10, then it would've matched with a lvl 8 killer.
---
What? Struggle is where you‚Äôre fighting the entity‚Äôs spider leg things away. If your advice is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt struggle‚Äù then I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to say other than don‚Äôt listen to that advice. Like a survivor main saying ‚Äúhey killers, don‚Äôt use your power, thanks!‚Äù
---
Not in Mobile which this thread is about. :)
---
Its pretty nasty with NOED, otherwise i mostly see Huntress' use it for those long range snipes.
---
I think he‚Äôs salty but serious. I would recommend watching survivor streamers or YouTube‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt get mad tho, not everyone on this sub are experienced so people should really be less aggressive towards others.
---
The only time I will accept something like this, ‚Äúbasement time with insidious Bubba!‚Äù
---
Can survivors save them?
---
Ooh okey thanks! Hmm i wounder how I should proceed now... I'll have to lean on luck I guesa
---
My point is pretty clear. Never said the game is a lie at any point. Please go back and re-read.
---
Lol, just got wrecked by a nurse as I stood there twice. Should‚Äôve read this before that round
---
some good tips for newer survivors. 8 is the main one that people of all rank need to put more emphasis on. and try not to use pallets at full health. as stated 5 I think you meant don't attempt to kobe, cause they definitely should struggle if in struggle phase. I would also add, don't d/c just because you were hooked 5 seconds in or if the toxic killer decides to face camp, you double pip down and you hurt your team tremendously.
---
Oh shit and then assholes like me dc when I see its certain killers.  I always think about the fact that I‚Äôm fucking over my teammates but I don‚Äôt really consider the fact that I‚Äôm also ducking over the killer who may have waited a long time to get a game.  I‚Äôll consider that next time and weigh it against my desire to quit.
---
Well he isn‚Äôt really sneaky anyway when all your hear is an orchestra Blairing a note down your ear lol
---
lool
---
Well, I'm glad to hear it's not just me.  I've been having it happen in general, but when I try to run it sometimes starts going so slow that I feel like I'm walking.
---
It's really been messing me up during chases.
---
I didnt know that! :D that'll be awesome.
---
Honestly, the +30% makes hitting great skill checks a walk in the park. They should definitely not widen it even further.  
---
Instead, what they should do is increase the chance of a skill check triggering, or make it so great skill checks award an additional 2-3% progress while TINH is active.
---
Doesn‚Äôt a hit count as a won chase?
---
Here are the patch notes (last post in the thread): https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/77031/patch-notes-3-1-0-mid-chapter#latest
---
Yeah... I've only played survivor in the tutorial and once out of it. That's why I said take it with a grain of salt, cuz I really don't know much from the survivors perspective.
---
Awesome! Can‚Äôt wait!!
---
&gt;Because if you matched with the highest player and let's say it was 3 rank 4s and 1 rank 10, then it would've matched with a lvl 8 killer.
---
What? If you matched with the highest rank player in this situation it would've been a rank 4.
---
The biggest problem come when you have a red rank, a rank 19-20 and, say, 2 green ranks. If you average them out, you'll get a green rank killer, which basically is being punished because **you** wanted to play with your low level friends.
---
In the last paragraph of the initial post is a glossary of all the important terms to know. It‚Äôs really helpful having that up when going through this subreddit.
---
I main killer, first thing I saw but I do occasionally use survivor but it's rare
---
‚ÄúRush me from the shadows‚Äù LOL I feel that. I played against a group the other night where the Nea kept trying to blind me at every single pallet/window, I‚Äôm almost positive she never touched a gen. When I would start another chase she would immediately be right behind me flashlight spamming to get my attention like....I‚Äôm not dumb. Go away and do something productive. What‚Äôs even funnier is I was running Iron Maiden and they continuously hid in lockers.
---
Did they fix the medic trophy yet?
---
do you mind sharing the reason as to why survivors require more memorization? do you mean pallets spawns, etc?
---
&gt; but it doesn't happen THAT often
---
Someone collected a lot of metric data recently, and one of the conclusions was that ~25% of matches have one or more DCs. More in lower ranks, and less in higher ranks.
---
25% of games being ruined is a *lot*. And it's proof enough that the current punishment is ineffective.
---
Do you also duck lobbies (while playing survivor) with TTV players?
---
Honestly most of them just hook farm or don't do generators, or both, and they're toxic little shits.
---
Not all of them, but I really hate playing *with* most streamers.
---
It's on everything afaik
---
hopefully fixes the newest bug where you cant struggle/heal/recover
---
Nah, she's done with looking for that. Now, she's gonna *make* the sad backstory.
---
You got BHVR'd
---
Stealth orchestra is a real tactic. You're looking for killers not bands.
---
You probably made them stop wanting to play because of that ebony
---
My argument is that not all SWF are toxic, I play with my friends cause we like to play games together, have for years.
---
You on the other hand call people assholes for simply using a feature in the game, you‚Äôre a cry baby. 
---
You made up the fact that my friend hosts because you assumed that he hosts cause he is a lower level. That just shows what type of person and what mentality you have, it‚Äôs not healthy. 
---
I‚Äôm not being defensive, I was laughing at the fact that you are so blind and ignorant to someone providing facts that go against what you believe that you fabricated something and wrote a whole comment only referencing the fabricated detail you made. 
---
It was an lmao moment. 
---
And this isn‚Äôt even a ‚ÄúI know you are but what am I‚Äù cause; 
---
I know you‚Äôre toxic, and I am just a SWF that doesn‚Äôt use lower ranks ‚Äújust to stay in the red ranks‚Äù.
---
Is it? It seems op but nobody rocks it
---
Why can't the devs just say the % instead of words like slight, tremendously, ect.
---
Im glad
---
And then it doesn't matter still. You can't 3 Gen 4 people very effectively especially since you'll never get a down.
---
Obviously a joke
---
Originally I thought of it like "if you project your obsession from 5 hits, in the next 15/20/25 seconds you can instaheal him for one health state" but I thought that would be too op
---
I actually went back and checked, yes, the hit counts as a won chase, only survivors lose points for lost chases. The wound healing one still makes no sense. Killers like when survivors are healing, it means they aren't doing gens, doubly so if one survivor is healing another instead of self caring.
---
You mean the video where the Claudette says "doing gens, you?" ?
---
SAW
---
And that's why it works so well.  If you can make the killer an emotional blubbering mess by squatting at them you've already won.
---
Funny watching a psyched out killer whiffing.
---
Well that‚Äôs awful. Basically forces you to prestige if you get shitty luck.
---
I tried running bond but had to take it off after a while because 80% of the time all it did was make me angry seeing the other 3 survivors being absolute potatoes.
---
When playing with a group, nothing gets my dick harder, or a bigger collective reaction from us than when the killers do this. Hitting a pallet stun that makes them pull the plug should be an achievement IMO
---
Which achievement exactly?
---
Feng when she falls from a ledge
---
no it sucks ass I'm currently rank 3 killer and playing amongst those rank of people isnt fun but any time your rank 8 and lower the ranking system give you a random assortment of a few so its understandable
---
points are more important than the potential of getting hooked
---
The Hex:Ruin totem is in the corner near the gen lol
---
Win? xD if you unplug nobody wins
---
At first I thought it was a dbd meme then I saw the picture and had to check is it‚Äôs on r/ForHonor
---
Honestly, I have no idea. I think it's to give a general idea of how good things are, and to try and keep the worse items at least somewhat attractive, but that's purely speculation, and I would still prefer it if the game would just give us the exact values.
---
This exactly where I'm at too, I want both just want to know which one to get first
---
Add-On Ideas, I'm super bored at work:
---
**Common**
---
Bronze Boots: Slightly increases movement speed for 3 seconds after possessing (2% increased speed). 
---
Moldy Wooden Cross: Slightly increases the recovery rate of Unholy Possession (2 second reduction).
---
Dagger: After possessing, survivors hit within 10 seconds suffer the Hemorrhage status effect for 30 seconds.
---
**Uncommon**
---
Iron Boots: Moderately increases movement speed for 3 seconds after possessing (3% increased speed). 
---
Wet Stone: After possessing, survivors hit within 10 seconds suffer the Mangled status effect for 30 seconds.
---
Metal Cross: Moderately increases the recovery rate of Unholy Possession (3 second reduction).
---
**Rare**
---
Polished Boots: Considerably increases movement speed for 3 seconds after possessing (4% increased speed). 
---
Poison Coating: After possessing, survivors hit within 10 seconds suffer the Exhausted status effect for 30 seconds.
---
Rosary: When using Unholy Possession, all suits of armor will glow and appear to become active for 5 seconds, before returning to their inactive state.
---
**Very Rare**
---
Sheath: After possessing, for 30 seconds, recovery rate of successful attacks is reduced by 30%. 
---

---
**Ultra Rare**
---
Blade Mail: Survivors who break armor are injured and revealed for 5 seconds.
---
Holy Book: When any suit of armor is within 8 meters of a survivor, its aura will change to yellow for 10 seconds.
---
Oh man I sure hope head on is in the shrine
---
He's lvl 8 so I only had 1, and Ive gotten the daily 3 days in a row now, haha.  Ive just been tbagging until someone gives me the free stalk lmao
---
No idea why someone downvoted you, you're bang on.
---
Nope, Iron will eliminates grunting entirely. Stridor makes only breathing louder if someone has Iron Will.
---
Not just winning, but even doing the game objectives is considered a toxic gen rush. Using items like flashlights or insta heals - toxic. Took a hit for someone else on the way out? You toxic fuck.
---
Iron will on Feng is sometimes bugged for some reason
---
that was sarcasm, devs seems to never give people what they want, it's called reverse psychology
---
I completely agree with the part of me being a cunt, but people on rank 8 cant be new or practicing.
---
You have to learn each potential variation of a loop, and how to run it depending on the direction you are coming from, as well as potential spawns for pallets, totems (Very important here.  Knowing the exact spots a totem can spawn helps you massively cut down on time spent looking for a dangerous hex, and help you find ones that may be perfectly LoS blocked as to be nearly invisible.  Good example is the totem that spawns behind a fire-barrel in an L-wall as part of a tileset.  I've seen survivors do the gen right next to it and not even see the hex ruin 2 feet away from them.), and on indoor maps, generators.
---
It isn't like you spend time quizzing yourself over it, but you just do it more and more often.
---
Really not sure how to feel about camping as a strat. If a billy hooks two people close to each other at the beginning of the game, there's literally no reason to leave, but there's also no chance for survivors. The 2 min hook time is only time for 3 gens at the very most, and at the beginning of the game that's not enough even with no slowdown perks.
---
Point is, part of me thinks camping can be part of a balanced strat, and part of me thinks it's the dev's fault for building strength around it.
---
Halloween. I‚Äôd say buy both, but if you have just enough for one, get Mike.
---
awesome, probably me then,well regardless i hope you had an awesome time there, if you're going to twitchcon im doing dwight, ghostface (ptb shiny one) and burger king myers, (just myers with one of those burger king crowns on) and my dad's doing jacksonville ash for one of those days. hope to see ya there my dude.
---
That's why I hoped for head on
---
Don't remember saying that.
---
I see...
---
DCing is obviously a ragequit so we dont need to discuss that.
---
A match isnt lost because you make one tiny mistake. Killer still needs to hit you at least 3 times to kill you.
---
So 3 mistakes in a row are very hard to pull except your are a total potato and have very little skill in this game.
---
Of course you have to put it into perspective but I guess its pretty obvious that most matches are lost because stupid survivors fell for a camping killer and tried to unhook someone where should be doing gens instead.
---
I'm rank 8 and the person I'm playing with is rank 17, but we get a rank 14-16 killer no matter which of us hosts.
---
I think "rank abuse" only works for 4-man SWFs, otherwise it does seem to try and average it out?
---
If you have a problem with it, then articulate what you don't like.
---
But if you're gonna spew some vague overdramatic whining about this being "the absolute worst fucking idea ever", then I ask you the same question that you have for the OP: Why are you posting this?
---
I do the same, it;s very effective, they have absolutely no chance to even react.
---
Maybe your right
---
I do solo survivor on console, and I typically run Spine Chill, Self Care, Empathy, and We‚Äôre Going to Live Forever.
---
Easape Artist.
---
You use your camera
---
He has to be close enough, at the center of your screen, with big enough portion of his body visible to you
---
But even when i try not to my teammates still do it
---
Huh, yeah what is it good for?
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
Looooool omfg I am dying over here
---
The best thing is the TTV streamers are usually absolutely shit at the game, so it‚Äôs fun watching them play poorly lol
---
Yesssss!
---
Actually people bring Ebony Mori because survivors get at least three chances (one before each hook) before dying, more if they have stuff like Borrowed Time/Mettle of Man/Adrenaline/Decisive Strike/Instant heals.
---
And it takes two minutes for a survivor to die after all of that, even though two minutes is four generators popping at least.
---
For question of the day I mainly play survivor, but then I also mainly play with friends.
---
Do you start the lobby or your lower rank friends? Swf matches ive had tend to have either someone exactly my level or a 1-2 rank difference, and then all their drastically different friends
---
It's true, on the other hand, all that absolute horseshit that has happened in my many many killer games I can use in my survivor games, so, make the best I guess
---
Because people can't understand how percentages work (just look at any discussion about Enduring)
---
Haha yes please
---
Pull the cord if this happens in the future, and you'll keep all your rewards and progress. This glitch happens whenever an animation is happening that delays the entity claiming the survivor until after the timer is completely over.
---
What about pebble? Huh
---
Needs engravings
---
Probably lag I'd guess
---
OoO is only bad against Nurse and Spirit ;) Against any other killer it's OP, especially in SWF teams
---
best thing about playing on ps4 can just bait people into swearing at you then report them and get their account suspended e.g. 'nice tunnelling trash' 'awww baby cry' then the fun really starts
---
Gen grabber Spirit counters genrushing
---
I recommend maining Billy. He is the easiest competitive killer.
---
What‚Äôs the best place to learn about the different perks and items, and what is/isn‚Äôt strong?
---
If it's a calculated move, and there are no hard feelings after you kill that survivor, then sure, clever to distract the killer so your team mates, who cant loop well, can do gens. But if I think about my games, and the amount of times tbagers rage in after game chat, because they got the attention they wanted and got killed, Id say most of the time ppl are just toxic and cant handle the same behaviour if its directed at them. In addition to that, tbaging would be considered toxic/nonprofessional in esports, which DBD isnt so who gives a shit.
---
Thanks Ill try to remember that next time im versus him
---
i had the same thing happen just a second ago, besides the flashlight i also would catch somebody unhooking, go after the person doing the hook save &amp; somehow get Decisive striked without a DS icon even appearing
---
You know full well what he meant
---
No, that a regular-sized mushroom. The newspaper is informing us that, because of the unusually humid weather this summer, there's been an outbreak of tiny Wraiths. That's what we should be anxious anxious about.
---
Remember to tuck your pants into your socks when walking in the woods. Don't walk through tall grass without shining a flashlight at it first.
---
my friends just started playing but only really plays survivor with me, says killer is too much stress. had a go on his game playing as a rank 20 billy and some survivors are suspiciously good. they dont expect a billy running only enduring to one shot them all
---
hey, don't worry, I will do each and every killer and survivor eventually (for free lmao) but I'm kinda busy rn so it might take a while, but they will come!
---
I'm not close to good enough yet to sell my art lmao
---
Nah, Feng's Sonar still in my ears...
---
it's kinda dumb they give you anyone +-5 ranks from you. as a rank 13 getting rank 8s all the time, theres a lot of losing and a lot of learning for me *sigh*
---
Yeah I‚Äôve heard him and nurse are the best once mastered! What are the best perks to run on him? The only unlockable I have for killer atm is BBQ
---
If you ever get to endgame and need noed w/ those add ons, i have bad news for you...
---
I'll admit, im a bit more focused on running in terror lol
---
Anytime she's charging her blink. I believe intercepting her during the blink movement also stops her cold and immediately stuns her, though I haven't seen that happen outside of KYF.
---
A ‚ÄúPrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr‚Äù And ‚ÄúHurrr Duurrr it‚Äôs latency guys, reee.‚Äù
---
Real answer. Broken as fuck hit boxes. Swing at stationary survivor 2 inches away? Miss. This? HIT!
---
Should've t-bagged
---
Wow I didnt know that I was going off my experience with my swf and we're the same so thats why I was curious. Thanks for that insight though
---
wtf build is that for Iri head huntress? Aside from Ruin, the other 3 perks are pointless to run, since Franklin's doesn't affect hatchets and NOED and Haunted are redundant since you already have insta downs on you.
---
*Looks at you*
---
"Dew it"
---
Another example of psychotic killer main. I swear some of them need to check themselves to a doctor for anger issues. Not to mention scummy play.
---
As a killer you screw over 4 people, as a survivor you screw over 3 people
---
I agree that their are a lot of add-ons, items and offerings on both sides that can really swing the balance. I am not sure how they tackle that because it is very difficult to balance this game, heck the killers alone are so different from a good Spirit finding it a lot easier to complete a match than say a Leatherface. 
---
I will reiterate that I think you need to play killer as some statements you make are a little off. The big one here is that you think giving an ability that allows survivors to have an extra hook would not be as powerful as an ebony. I am sorry but that is ridiculous as this would be a 100 times more powerful than an ebony. It is hard enough to hook 1 survivor 3 times but then you have to do it to 4 survivors so in total 12 hooks. If you added an extra one then your suddenly looking at 16 hooks you potentially need in a game to win. This would not only encourage camping and tunneling so a killer can just kill someone before the game ends but very few killers would be able to achieve anything more than a 1k because the gens can be done so quickly. Like I said I think it would be fine if they make it so you have to get someone on death hook before you can kill them, this way people have time to play and if not well you probably have not played very well. I really think its key you try playing killer because your opinions are shadowed in bias and I was the same for ages. I play survivor more than killer but once I finally branched out I understood killer tactics, how they don't always have the power role, how frustrating it is going against toxic survivors and most importantly why killers may run certain builds and how to then counter them.
---
Shockingly it wasn't well received
---
*Insert earrape femur breaker here*
---
I agree, they should make other killers just as good as Freddy
---
it shouldn‚Äôt cover the repair bar progress, but since it‚Äôs a png it‚Äôs going to take the whole picture. that‚Äôs normal. but that shouldn‚Äôt get you banned.
---
I usually try to refrain from petty or toxic antics when playing online, but boy is it satisfying to absolutely stomp an irritating SWF.
---
I mean if they did rush some killers like micheal Myers or trapper they would be Pretty fucked
---
Not really a thing when they only focus on gens. You start chasing one, two others complete that gen. Kicking gens is almost useless without pop goes the weasel
---
I agree their can be truth to what they say but my point was that OP had made out like survivors complain freely when killers can't and don't. This is false as both sides are as bad as each other and the only way you learn the negatives to playing killer or survivor is to play both. Often once people play both they then understand why a killer might slug when 1 gen is left or why survivors find the spirit with beads difficult.
---
I would imagine that he‚Äôs fine with most of the community. If he got both the pallets and the snares then he might be a little overturned. The extra stuff is just a secondary power. 
---
but goddamn that lullaby while in dream state messes with me sometimes.
---
Unless they run away from the pallet when you crouch or the loop is too long, I get it 100% of the time, even at red ranks. If they run away when you crouch, use that as an advantage to get them off loops
---
It really depends on how many traps, it can definitely be pretty cheesy to stick like five traps down.
---
Most of my experience with Hags is that they use the addon that gives them a MASSIVE trigger range on their traps and they stick them in every direction and the Hag camps like 25 meters away. It basically forces the survivor to enter the second stage on their first hook with how long it takes to crouch over without activating a trap.
---
And then that same survivor has to spend forever crouching back over each trap after the unhook even though the Hag is only 25 meters away, and they either get caught by sprinting through the traps or because they're still in the trap minefield when the Hag returns because of the unhook notification.
---
It makes it next-to-impossible to get a save against a Hag without them teleporting back because you ran or getting to engage on your crouching butt if you didn't, and it's not different than Insidious Leatherface in actual function.
---
So *yes*, it can be camping/tunneling.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
I mean the 4-3 SWF i dont really care 2 SWF, also being in the red ranks taking advantage of the bad matchmaking because a lot of people in SWF have at least one survivor with low ranks so they face against low rank killers for example in the game i am refering in the post the survivors' ranks were 12, 4, 3, 4 so i was playing mostly with very experienced survivors with when i dont even had a decent build because i havent got enough habilities
---
Every ten seconds, sure, but sabotaging them is an option too,
---
I mean you‚Äôre making fun of people saying this, but the devs have literally said this is the issue. But I guess the people who made this game have no idea what they‚Äôre talking about and we should listen to the Reddit clowns.
---
It's just the way it is bro, Almost every Killer faces this shit. 
---
My advice would be to git gud with 2 killers that you know you can rekt them and pick em up when you think(guess) if the match its gona be hard or SWF.
---
Gen rushing is *only* doing the gens. Yes, that's the main objective, but I'm not over here trying to secure every kill by camping
---
Just as good, yes. But maybe a little more...unique? Current Freddy just feels like multiple killers in one and it is kinda "eh". I am just glad he is viable I guess.

---
BHVR tries to maintain some balance betrween the number of killers and the number of survivors. Adding the entire L4D(2) cast would have created WAY too many survivors for them to keep up.
---
Ace didn't get a Nick skin because they usually only do that sort of thing with the original Survivors. (Another example would be the Leatherface Masks based off of the Survivors. Only the originals got to be masks.)
---
Lastly, I don't think there's any proof that Left 4 Dead is 'done'. I'm not holding my breath for a 3, personally, but that doesn't mean that Valve won't do it somewhere down the line.
---
**Don't want him nerfed.** Haha, I am just always kinda weird about recycling old stuff.
---
This was basically my rank 15ish killer experience.  I kept constantly getting people who were in purple and red ranks with one survivor around my rank. And they would obviously play how they're used to, the fact that I was 10 ranks lower didn't matter.
---
he does feel like he has a lot going for him.   i personally love the whole  invisibility he's got going.  or even the whole in-n-out phasing that he does at the 16-32.  fantastic for mind games.
---
Idk dude something to do with balancing EndGame Collapse but i think it's dumb too
---
They can keep this. Love it.
---
Well, five is still a lot. Especially since at lower gen numbers, you could potentially sit them on the gens and gates and just cycle through them. But that can be fixed with a longer cool down.
---
You also have to consider only 5 survivors are good at fighting and only 2 have dealt with insane stuff like Bill dealing with zombies and Laurie dealing Micheal so even if they were to rush them they would probably still die even if it was a weaker killer.
---
I'm a little saddened by the exclusivity of it. 
---
Then I remember there is no cross-platform progress tracking.
---
God speed to all ya'll who roll up a new account on the Switch, if you're giving up hundreds/thousands of hours of BP farmed then I suppose the least BHVR can do is give you something special.
---
I‚Äôm not going to accuse you of wanting a nerf. I know those people exist but I doubt you‚Äôre one. 
---
I feel they had to recycle old stuff. Would Freddy be that great if his entire power was a teleport to non-completed gens? I‚Äôd rather them come up with original concepts but there‚Äôs only so much you can do with an old killer.
---
That's a really nice assumption from you, to bad you don't have anything to back it up, so you just come out as child for accusing me of such thing. That or you're just projecting.
---
I honestly don't care if I get put against a rank 20 as a rank 1 killer, for me it's whatever, I'll just play the game and move on. The other way around (low rank killer Vs high rank survivor) is the obvious bad one because, after all the killer had no choice on the matter, which the survivors all did. If you're a low level playing with a high level friend, you know what you signed up for.
---
Well, you can teleport to all of them. But the survivors can sabotage the inactive armor sets so they are unable to be teleported into for a little and don‚Äôt act as terrain.
---
I disagree in the killers perspective but agree with survivors.
---
Never played any of DS 2.
---
Deliverance is the best perk for this
---
My bad forgot to put for the removed ambush Compensate by making her crouching speed similar to Ghostface but make where she only attacks when fully standing and keep the Insidious when crouched; Cause honestly I'm pretty good at getting stealth Gen grabs.
---
Does that mean that the next match would have it refreshed/full? Like if I used 75% of a toolbox and escape, It will regain that 75% so it would be like if I‚Äôm using a new toolbox? 
---
As a follow up question, is this why people like using Ace‚Äôs perks when running that Plunderers perk because you keep the add ons to, and you can farm for items and addons well then?
---
You are absolutely right. It just became a thing to joke about him from his point of view lol. How he views himself as this deliverer of justice and that only he can save us from the depravity of the world such as the Miami Killer.
---
You get notified when ppl report you?  What even happens if you get reported?  Anything?
---
I like this concept a lot. There could be a lot of fun addons playing with terror radious. Like giving all suits have a 20 meter radious or so, making those perks nobody uses actually useful since you  could blanket a lot of the map in terror. Conversely you could have them where for a brief period of time after him teleporting there would be no radious or stain, letting him get the drop on people.
---
Do finding items and sabotaging hooks help them win or is there another purpose for those?
---
With someone on her back she could move from one side of the map to the other faster than any other killer or using blink.
---
Yeah but still
---
Ohhh and are you aware of it means anything on PSN?  That‚Äôs where I play.
---
A guy who used to upvote his own posts/comments with alts and downvoted those he didn't agree with to get the karma train going
---
There's an infamous conversation where he was arguing that a raven is not a crow or something like that where the other guy got massively downvoted because of his alts starting the karma train
---
Just to clarify something I'm unsure of, *does increased repair speed use the same amount of charges but at a faster rate?* Of course it repairs faster, but does it have a concistent rate of like X% repaired = X amount of charges used no matter the speed?
---
Oh god a P3 red rank nurse on PS4. The horror....those poor bastards.
---
I can see what you‚Äôre saying. It really wasn‚Äôt more than a few hours of consideration, and It‚Äôs more a brain exercise than anything that would be permanent anyway.
---
I still appreciate the feedback :) all good things to take into account.
---
Finding items can help them repair gens if it's a tool box. Sabo-ing hooks ensures that they don't go on hooks near them if the killer catches them. So yeah, it helps a decent amount.
---
PC, Ingame: me and at least 2 other survivors became unable to move after attempting to heal another player. heal didn't progress and i continued to get skill checks despite being hooked
---
Xbox.
---
If you want me to talk all decadent and sophisticated, then here we go. 
---
Your constant need and want and usage of ‚Äúanalyzing‚Äù is very bleak and an attempt at boasting knowledge that you do not have to make yourself seem superior to me. This alone shows that in your life, you‚Äôve been very, very often been a lower-person, a social outcast or otherwise. It‚Äôs a superiority complex you‚Äôve developed because on the internet you can open your mouth as much as you want to without repercussion because in real life you‚Äôre as silent as a dry wall. 
---
You bring up terms like ‚Äòspecial snow flake‚Äô and ‚Äòtriggered‚Äô, alongside homophobic remarks that very obviously show your politically right-leaning mindset that has been garnered through life-built hatred. Your leniency to very frequent right-wing arguments makes it obvious that you are Caucasian while your post history suggests you‚Äôre around your teens.
---
Your logic isn‚Äôt logic, it‚Äôs trying to rile up and anger people so that you feel superior. That alone leaves me with no want or need to argue with you because i know for a fact that you are only here to argue and try to incite anger. Your arguments also hold no solid ground and are nothing but insults, so i have no need to argue them. 
---
It‚Äôs just like how you tried to say that me very easily connecting the dots and calling you an angsty teeny white boy is racist. Irony being that you are trying to make it seem like i‚Äôve become so weak and fallen to your prodding. 
---
You‚Äôre emotionally frail and have to make yourself feel better by feeling like you‚Äôre superior to others, when in fact the methods you use to make yourself feel superior only make you a lower and lower human in real life as more and more of you becomes dedicated to hatred. 
---
tl;dr: You‚Äôre as dry and frail as the piece of white bread that you are
---
If the entity would let them fight, I feel the zealot would win as he can‚Äôt get sick XD
---
Uhhh, why would you think a demogorgon is coming next? There is a confirmed collab with behavior but that could be on any number of things behavior has done. Although, I would love to see a demogorgon in game
---
Dead Hard is back!
---
Aren‚Äôt we all. The next killer should be an original killer so they‚Äôll have more room to play with.
---
Where's always gonna be losers who think they are the shit by bullying people in a video game they spend 1000 hours on. They are sad sad people, probably getting bullied in school or at home and spend their time bullying people online.
---
I‚Äôm a complete bitch but what I would have done is closed the app from the QuickStart menu, no one including the survivors would have gotten their bp. Then they can go waste someone else‚Äôs time :)
---
But how long does searching take because if it takes too long wouldnt it be better to just stay on a gen from a time perspective? Also, what is the chance of getting a toolbox?
---
I thought saboing wasnt as good because of the abundance of hooks nowadays? I read somewhere there were less hooks so saboing helped people escape.
---
This is why I play Billy against SWFs now
---
New Head On demoted to 3rd best exhaustion perk behind BL and fixed DH
---
I agree 100%. It just feels like they couldn't think of a way to get his old kit to be balanced so they just threw 9 abilities on him and called it a day. But the real question is: *does OP want Freddy to get nerfed?*
---
There is a sabotage option  that I included, that would do essentially everything you mention, and also not allow the Zealot to inhabit the suit for a time, giving the survivors a chance to prevent themselves from getting trapped.
---
If I could move my progression over I would buy it, but I really dont want to start over.
---
I didn‚Äôt want to give them the satisfaction and me be penalised by losing my BP. üòÇ 
---
I have sent an official report to the devs about their gameplay though, doubt anything will happen but therapeutic lmao
---
Wtf is your gt lmao how do you pronounce that
---
It was the only option after being dishonored like that
---
It‚Äôs not P3, it‚Äôs a skin I bought ;) Not really planning on prestiging her soon
---
I mentioned in an edit that the expanded terror radius is only temporary for a short time, like 10 seconds.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really strange, it completely changed
---
oh-vuks
---
Definitely both are wrong, I just laughed seeing a killer do it, because I tend to lol @ shit killers.. but seeing a DC or few most matches is disheartening as hell tbh.
---
UUUNNNNLLLIIIIMMMIIITTTEEEDDDD NUT!
---
thats fucking stupid i hope they dont implement it
---
No lol Xbox nor PS4 will ban you because some little bitch from a game is spamming reports as long as you have a history of being chill
---
I‚Äôve been sitting on the concept for a few weeks, but I sat down and came up with the details over a few hours.
---
I‚Äôm honored you‚Äôd Area 51 the HQ for my idea though :) I‚Äôm glad you like it!!
---
There are like 5 variations of the map and I never get them enough to learn, lmao. They fuck me up ahaha. My navigation of maps wasn‚Äôt the best anyway!
---
Lmao Lol lmao lol lol lmao, you keep repeating the same things with those inbetween like it'll replace your lack of an argument. NO YOURE BULLYING US YOU ASSHOLE CRY BABY LMAO LOL XD, dude just give it up
---
That's such a boring excuse. Never caused me problems. Just take Iron will and get shit done for the team. Easy.
---
Your opinion on how you sound is honestly biased. Like, if I were to say that I'm pretty popular, I'd be biased, because *I* like me. The same way *you* think that *you* aren't offensive. That doesn't mean shit. Literally everyone else sees that as offensive. If I go around being a sexist, it doesn't matter if *I'm* ok with my own sexist jokes. There's going to be a fuckton of people who're offended by me.
---
Also, if your intention was to be funny, you're bad at it. Like no one thinks being mocked or being told they don't know what they're talking about is funny. No one wants to be made fun of. That's kind of *How to Socialize 101*. If you can't realize that, maybe the internet, a place *for socializing*, isn't for you.
---
Killer.
---
Use it on your brown toolboxes.
---
In your opinion, is it acceptable to report killers who face camp or do other trolly things which ruin a survivor‚Äôs experience?
---
It is the hitboxes too, but if it makes you feel better it‚Äôs bullshit both ways.
---
No, only if I think they‚Äôre lag-switching (happened only once could‚Äôve been shit internet but better safe than sorry). BHVR won‚Äôt do anything against face camping or tunneling even though it‚Äôs a dick move but not bannable. I also report AFKers and people I know are smurfing but that‚Äôs it
---
I appreciate you
---
Mad grit is the perk responsible for that. 
---
Mad grit will also be changed to remove this part soon.
---
You're breathtaking
---
Why is this being shown to me?
---
Shouldn't this be NSFW?
---
I'd rather run Spine Chill since that gives me a better chance if a killer tries to mind game since I'll know about it.
---
And even after all that, I'd rather run Kindred as my aura perk.
---
I would love to join as well!
---
It only consumes when you turn a good skill check into a great aka not hitting a great.
---
Hitboxes are the real killers.
---
Is there a better perk/killer combo (if used properly) than Hag &amp; Make Your Choice?? Good lord.
---
I definitely don't think Head On is better than Sprint Burst and Lithe.
---
You can clearly see where you said some shit talk first, above in the chat. Next time you want to paint a fake ass picture use better paint. Fuck survivors
---
Do you know how to read? I said I don't care about playing with people lower than me, which never happens, not that I'm ok. I much rather that than playing against red ranks as a low level. Both are still wrong, but that's a problem created by SWF, which wasn't initially supposed to be in the game and now is causing a load of problems on balancing. If both situations are unavoidable, the first one (high rank killer Vs low rank survivor) is the most fair out of the two because the survivor chose to play like that.
---
In no moment I said everyone likes to play against low rank survivors, I said that **I** honestly couldn't care less. I'm not a god-like killer myself and I'm playing Nurse on console of all the things. If one of the two situations is to happen, match them according to the highest rank survivor. If you don't like playing against low rank survivors (which you're not obligated to like), that's on you, but at least that way it's fair for both sides.
---
I got you bae
---
Well, I mean there's a few of them in the game already, but none of these are breaking, at least I think so.  
---
Also, I wouldn't put a lot of stock into them. I came up with them over a few hours and I'm not all that skilled at creation of perks, so even if on some long-shot I'd get this even looked at by dev's, there's no way they'd be staying in their current iteration.
---
Ahhh and now you have resorted to ‚Äújust give up‚Äù when you haven‚Äôt actually put any good points into this conversation. Lol.
---
But you still assume you‚Äôve won? I wonder what makes you believe that? 
---
You make it seem as if one of us can actually be wrong in an opinionated debate and that I should give up. Lmao.
---
I just think your post was shit, you are crying about it when you did fine, you just jumped on the ‚Äúwow this ranking sucks swf makes this game so terrible‚Äù train, and you decided to post on here.
---
So I decided to tell you my opinions, if you don‚Äôt like that don‚Äôt post on a sub lol
---
At this point I‚Äôve been adding the lols because it seems to bother you on some emotional level. But you‚Äôll probably just keep on about how you are right and I‚Äôm wrong and neglect that you changed your stance and fabricated a detail that didn‚Äôt exist. 
---
Kinda sounds like trump lol. You say something then later say ‚ÄúI never said that‚Äù maybe you have a lot in common, that would be interesting. Your sentence structure is very similar so I can see it.
---
Eh, I just kinda threw things I felt worked here, but could work for other killers as well. It's not the strongest, but everything can't be super strong either, else it would be an unbalanced game.
---
oh no this is a bug that's literally been happening for years you have to fall off the edge of the map and it will reput you back in the game but you have to rerun to the gate it not fair but what is fair in this game as a survivor anyway
---
When would they come towards you?
---
I play both, but I see myself more as a killer
---
&gt;Mad grit will also be changed to remove this part soon.
---
Source? I feel like you just made that up.
---
If it's after a hook, then it's BBQ and chilli. You don't even need a perk to counter this, just hide in a locker when the killer picks a downed survivor up and stay in there for 4 seconds after he's been hooked before leaving. 
---
you can also get Distortion, a Jeff Johansen (DLC character) teachable which lets you avoid the effect 3 times.
---
Yeah! Someone suggested making the tiers give higher limits on how many tokens (gens completed) the killer could get. Something like  3/4/5 tokens, with a 2 second reduction per token.
---
I could not agree more, the preschool and the michael Meyers maps are the worst for killers  way too many hiding spots.
---
I want a 2x bps so bad
---
Thanks so much that's really helpful!
---
Thanks so much that's really helpful
---
Rip your teammates
---
It‚Äôs the most Survivor favored map in the game. Balanced Landing makes it nearly impossible to win against decent Survivors there. It‚Äôs the only map that still has infinites. Not even Bloodlust can save you. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if the map got temporarily disabled until the devs fix it.
---
r/LeakedbyDaylight
---
Whole chat log or didn‚Äôt happen
---
This subreddit is probably the best for discussion specifically. The wiki has a list of literally everything  (all perks, items, and add-ons in the game).
---
While there‚Äôs no discussion, there‚Äôs an openly voted tier list of all killers and perks on dennisreep.nl/dbd/ but I wouldn‚Äôt take it as end all since literally anyone can put whatever they want for a rating.
---
If you wanna know the specific strength of a perk or item, I can answer that for you.
---
Honestly tho, the worst map for killers I would have to say are the buildings.
---
Thank you for the praise! I love that the idea that's kicking around my head inspired so many people to respond and weigh in positively! I was honestly expecting a lot of "Shit killer, GGEZ" comments.  
---
I totally agree with the cooldown and animations. That's for sure making it into the next iteration. I'm not sure about 3, however. With a slightly reduced movement speed, you'd still have to really work to move five individual bodies into anything resembling a broken setup, all while chasing survivors and trying to keep them off of gens. Especially if they take the sabotage/knock over seriously and start limiting your reach.  
---
Deus Vult was absolutely meant to be temporary. I was just a derp and forgot to put that in. It would only boost for 10/20/30 seconds, and the scream would only happen once before all tokens are spent. It makes it harder to achieve in the end game as you hook and kill players. I also prevents tunneling as you need a wide spread of hits to activate it consistently, as well as Mori'ing since you can't get hits on a dead player.  
---
These are all great add-ons! I'll have to add these with the next iteration! Thank you so much for a great review and suggestions!
---
I've been playing DbD for 2 years and that shit you're talking about only happened to me like 3 or 4 times. I think devs have mechanics to actually detect if someone is doing something illegal but we never know...
---
Real question is if this guy is ok ü§£
---
Ya but Decisive Strike truggers a longer stun and don't cause you to become Exhausted.
---
YES I CAN USE DEAD HARD AGAIN
---
it's a combo of the 2 best killer perks in the game: BBQ, and Nurse-vision. the latter is especially awesome. ppl often don't expect me to know they're right around a corner and i come in swinging and hit them
---
I mean *shrug* you played yoself by stream sniping anyway
---
Wtf
---
That is not the real question at all
---
Yes! Because if you think about it 20% on how many games you play per day is what it‚Äôs based off of from what the devs have told us, so if you play 15 games a day, then you would have to DC 3 times in order to meet that DC threshold they set at 20% and I bet if you did it back to back it will, but if they are stretched out I think it won‚Äôt do anything to you. 
---
But I can play 30-40 rounds a day or more and I get booted all the time for no reason and sent to the main menu screen with a error message or that bs no internet connection message when my internet is fine. I‚Äôm on PS4 and allot of people have said the same thing, not sure how it is on pc or Xbox. But if they per say changed it to a stricter DC policy we all would be fucked and they have said they have no way of knowing if I pulled my internet cord or closed the app out or the game bugged and booted me, but when they get dedicated servers up and running they will be able to know then and the ban hammer is coming down on the people who abuse the DC!
---
No problem, always nice to see more people willing to try and learn the less meta killers, constantly playing against nothing but Billy/Nurse/Spirit gets boring really fast, and Trapper is a welcome change of pace.
---
Spirit has a pretty long katana. Pig has a hand blade. They have the same lunge. What do you What them to do? For design it would look stupid if they were the same size. So there has to be an animation difference. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs such a problem
---
All of these are awesome :&gt; I'll have a lot to consider with Zealot 2.0 :&gt;
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Sprint Burst not to trigger when the conditions were met.
---
I hope its fully fixed thats annoying
---
Same, I‚Äôve been doing surprisingly good recently so a double xp would be very beneficial &gt;:)
---
Maybe it's your scratchmarks? I don't know if you've ever tried Killer, but when Survivors run the Killer can see the general area where they've run by.
---
There are some perks that can help counter this, but the best way is usually just to try and walk and avoid the Killer's LOS.
---
If you're Injured it could be your blood trails or the complaining sounds Injured Survivors make. There is a perk to reduce those complaining sounds called Iron Will, but the best thing is to be near a loop or pallet so you can avoid going down if the Killer finds you.
---
Finally there are some Killer powers, perks, and add-ons that reveal your aura or your location to them. To better understand these I'd recommend playing Killer or waiting until the game ends to see what perks and add-ons the Killer you were facing used and how you can counter them in the future.
---
If you have any more specific questions just ask and I'll try my best to answer.
---
I hope this helps somehow and I hope you have fun playing DbD!
---
Yes, I do know that. but how the hell is that going to help me if I'm still injured? I still need self care.
---
Well he's the second killer I ever played, and I've had a lot of fun with him! (Pig was my first ~~and now I main Nurse lol~~)
---
Healing right next to the hook is the most time efficient thing if the killer isn't there. Healing in the middle of the open is the most time efficient thing if the killer isn't there. Time is your most important resource whether you're killer or survivor.
---
yeah and one other way is when survivors get hooked survivors run one direction for a few seconds then run opposite way to throw killer off and no prob
---
I'd personally be in favor of pipping or depipping as a team based on how many escapes, but most people are against it so its not happening.
---
One sent a message when I closed the hatch and then he dc‚Äôd calling me a salty kid to play with my mama
---
I tried doing this build before and i popped off the first time but i got stuck the whole time then i tried it again and popped it AGAIN.... then my internet went out the 3rd game i did it and got the 4k gotta say i wasnt happy that it took 3 attemps just to do this
---
Wait ,are you the guy who has been in like 90% of his games for the past 2 weeks?
---
More often than not they'll follow you to finish the heal somewhere safer. Or take a med kit.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
That's false. Most valuable resource is staying off the hook. Which means not being a dumb ass and healing next to a hook or in the open.
---
Why do I have a feeling that he wants to nerf Freddy?
---
I'm confused. How does you using a mori proves you stream sniped?
---
Yes, inactive suits have a hitbox and can block. However, they can also be knocked over/sabotaged to remove that hitbox and prevent the Zealot from possessing it for a time. Inactive suits can't be stunned by pallets, and after a lot of feedback saying the same thing, there would be an animation showing possession is about to happen on the suit.  
---
Thanks! I'd love to have any ability to work something like this into the game, but I know it's just an idea, with the Dev's already having their own plans.
---
Yes, it is a reskinned terror radius
---
I main claudette and pretty much always have either spine chill or premonition (or both).  
---
Every time I leave someone while we're working on a gen, I always think to myself, "wonder how long it'll be before that dwight goes down?"
---
Because I've already vanished into the shadows.
---
I sometimes wonder why the randoms I play with never take the hint.
---
Yep. It does work.
---
I'd make it much smaller, but those aren't a bad ideas! I'll have to keep them in mind as I make version 2.0!
---
Dedicated servers could not come out sooner
---
It's definitely a deserved ban. Stream sniping is cheap and lame. Congratulations on your ban!
---
While you let your team die ofc and get one shot anyway
---
Yeah, so...? At no point I said that any of this was a fact. The only fact here is: if you're going to have a difference between the ranks of the killer and the survivors, on the context of SWF being a thing, there's objectively a more fair way of doing it, by making the people who had a choice play against a killer on pair with their highest level, and there's objectively a more unfair way of doing it, by averaging it and making the killer go against higher ranked survivors for no good reason.
---
Good.
---
Also Rank 20: Oh? You're approaching me? Instead of running away, you're coming right to me?"¬†
---
Ok so i wrote the command and got this
---
Nightbot: Mad Grit is getting updated in the Mid Chapter patch! The miss cooldown while carrying a survivor will be entirely removed, as seen in the PTB, but for the live release the speed boost for swinging will also be removed (when running Mad Grit). https://www.twitch.tv/lmclean_bhvr/clip/FlirtyAbrasivePheasantDoubleRainbow
---
That clip is from before mid chapter patch, its an old clip. We are already on mid chapter.
---
CURRENT mad grit is working as intended and it wont get changed.
---
You dont get any speed bost by swinging, if the killer goes faster its because AGITATION, not mad grit.
---
Is dead hard worth using again?
---
Play who you enjoy playing. Wraith isn't the strongest Killer, but that doesn't mean he sucks either. 
---
No matter what Killer you play you'll have good and bad games, so just play the Killer you enjoy playing and don't worry about winning or being 'the best'. Have fun.
---
Goooooot it! I understand now :D
---
Its not broken, its working as intended. Its an useless perk, it doesnt make you go any faster.
---
Its a meme-tier perk
---
Oh man, I had an idea for a map that was essentially a razed and ruined Arabic city. I'll have to add that in with the next version.
---
Nah ofcourse not i got banned for stream sniping as i said in my title , i dont want sympathy , their is so many people that stream snipe on this game its just a warning for others really.
---
russian guys never understand English apparently !
---
One time use tho
---
No I have one monitor , I would get into his games sometimes on purpose. He just gets outplayed and dies.

You do realize it doesn't matter how fast you do gens if you are an idiot and can't stay away from the killer? You could do gens 95% of the game and still lose easily. Time is not all that matters. Efficient execution does.
---
Please stop
---
This may sound really silly, but my first few games were as a survivor, and I didn't realize that running left the red marks.
---
I kept wondering how the killer was finding me before I tried my first game as a killer and realized lol.
---
It also has Franklin‚Äôs Demise but Idk I think Leatherface is kinda boring so his perks are cool but I don‚Äôt think the same for the killer (please don‚Äôt yell at me it‚Äôs my opinion)
---
Tier 1 Myers, and some others are IMMUNE to spine chill. I think killers have an equivalent to spine chill, maybe its Whispers idk. 
---
I love spine chill for killers with no heartbeat and for clutch moments. However many will say it is a crutch perk.
---
My favorite is when someone DCs while the match is still loading and I lose my offering for no reason.  /s
---
OP seems like an asshole but i'm a bit worried if banning for stream sniping is legit. How do you even prove it happened? I had people wrongly accuse me of it before.
---
Love these things. Keep up the A+++ work
---
Yea a coordinated red rank team will fuck up any killer though
---
I legit don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs a team game, why can‚Äôt we just play like a team??? People can be so weird.
---
Unfortunately, hitboxes are still fucked on maps where the basement has a narrow entrance.
---
Oh thank you mate. I will be sure to add that in *salute*
---
Theres a line between streamsniping and harassing, and you clearly crossed it.
---
Your name should be u/ harassingisbannable
---
Would be funny. I‚Äôm just worried about a bunch of 12 year olds just ruining the concept :D
---
That exit gate glitch still isn‚Äôt fixed? Yet we all know if it was survivors not being hooked/sacrificed properly they would‚Äôve had it fixed ASAP.
---
so harderdaddy. good, glad yer banned
---
Check out Space Coconut on Youtube if you haven't already. He has a lot of videos on Hag, and you can pick up a bunch of tips to help you improve by watching him. 
---
I don't own Pig myself, but i really like her. She is IMO one of the most balanced killers in the game. Good enough to be able to 4k at the hands of a competant player, while not blatantly broken/unfun to play against like Shitbilly or Spirit. Her addons definitely are underwhelming though. I wanna pick her up because MYC is amazing on Hag, but i'm kinda waiting for the Saw chapter to go on sale (probably when she receives some love from the devs soon enough) in order to pick it up.
---
Tru3 has already said he has tried to talk to the devs about it and they won't do a thing.  Even against this guy who snipes him every day. I have a hard time believing that you got banned from just 2 games. 
---
I watch dbd streams while i wait for these looong killer Qs and im sure a lot of others do as well. It doesnt really prove anything just because you watch his stream and get him in your lobby..
---
I just dont understand why streamers dont use a different scene and mutes the sound while they Q up. It would make it a lot harder to snipe.
---
My friends are just bad at the game :( we love it, but my friends (two rank 12‚Äôs) and I (rank 5) try our best to be fair! It sucks people derank though. How can I make this fair when I play with them? They are my best friends and the only two people I play with.
---
Thanks , and you cant technically :) so be wary when you face someone with [T.TV](https://T.TV) if you ruin their experience thats what gets you banned.
---
Safe for work
---
True but it's already very rare and frankly rare to Head On stun the Killer so it might-as-well be a one time use perk. I agree that it should have a cooldown, but I think more people would use Head On if they felt like they could make a build out of it.
---
It‚Äôs not the survivors fault really. What is there to do other than gens. Killers have more effective strategies of doing the main objective, such as not camping. Survivors don‚Äôt have any way to do gens faster than just sit on them and do them as fast as possible.
---
Working as intended and he‚Äôs wasting 2 perk slots on them at skill
---
Not only that, there is a long L fence layout that leads to a window which is pretty much an infinite without bamboozle. You can‚Äôt mind game or catch them with BL 3 so your only option is to leave them and find another survivor
---
Ok then can you clarify the line?
---
Can you tell me what is harrasing that is different to stream sniping? 
---
So for example I played him twice today. No bm or anything in game that is bad except making the killer De-pip. please explain.
---
Seriously everyone need to play both survs and killer, and understand both sides gameplay bcs the flashlight blind is a mechanic in the game.  Did the killer missed her/his hatchets and probably dced bcs she's/he's done playing huntress ?
---
Empathy tho.
---
Had a guy on my team rage message me earlier today because I was using lockers..
---
The killer was leather face with bbq.  I was only in the locker right before and during the hook...
---
Odd because the devs claimed it [wasn't bannable](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9fkejw/the_final_word_these_are_not_reportable/)
---
Were you maybe banned for something else?
---
New Brand New Part doesn't consume the toolbox when you use it. You just lose the addon.
---
Yes, you're correct. It has a set number of charges, it just uses them quicker.
---
Or if it was 60k BP or more.
---
I was gonna say, half the time killer wins, all survivors talk trash about tunneling , camping, lag switch, etc. when survivors win the killer talks about SWF, DS, toxic flashlight saves, etc. 
---
GET OVER THE TOXIC PLAYERS AND JUST ENJOY THE GAME OR LEAVE FFS 
---
that is all
---
You keep calling me a cry baby but your replies reek of salty tears &amp; the need to prove yourself the better person, if actually you learned how to read you'd see the very first reply on my post is me saying it was close match &amp; i hooked everybody at least once. People calling out swf being unbalanced makes you feel bad cause its all you play
---
Adrenaline is kinda
---
it was me that has sniped him not every day for around 5 days now? maybe some prior. 
---
But he says its every game and every day , which is false he provided a screenshot of this and their was a couple of aces. " I dont even own the ace character".
---
It's basically because every time I faced him he lost , but sometimes he did tunnel me/ bring a mori and I would lose which is fine play
---
I know Bond is just better, but I prefer Empathy because I like being able to find my injured teammates. I often run it with Botany. And you can tell where the killer is whenever a survivor gets injured, which I don't see enough people talking about.
---
Thanks for putting this together. As a note for the future: the blue color you chose for the word "repair" is far too dark to be easily legible agains the dark gray background you chose. Consider using something brighter next time, or [consulting an accessibility checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)!
---
agreed maybe there a few other that I m not thinking about hut definitely that one
---
Arent you the guy who has been sniping him for weeks?
---
You cant get banned for only 2 matches, youve been doing for weeks havent you? Thats harassing.
---
Thrill Of The Hunt, Beast of Prey, and Distressing don't award more BP. They just make you reach the in-game cap faster. The in-game cap is 8000 for the 4 emblem categories. So Distressing doubles your in-game points, meaning that instead of getting 100 points towards the maximum 8000 in one category, you would get 200 points towards the in-game 8000. Basically you stop getting points twice as fast. 
---
Only BBQ awards extra BP after the match. Meaning, with BBQ and 5 Gateaus, and a double BP event, you could earn a maximum of 260,800 BP. 
---
That is a stark contrast from your 461,440 BP. It's an honest mistake I guess, but you wouldn't be the first person to make this mistake and come next Double BP event, you won't be the last.
---
Nope 100% for stream sniping , well they classed it as griefing, but banned me for communication abuse? Funny right.
---
There is a massive grey line between it they say its fine do it , then ban you for doing it. their is no clarification on it.
---
I guess that's the point, thank you very much!
---
I've died on first hook because no one would save me, and every time someone tried to (only after I get to stage 2), they get downed on the way. I really want to unlock Kindred on my main survivor.
---
Why do Megs get so much hate :(
---
I've met a few people who will do this purposefully to make sure none of the survivors get the escape points. It's quite sad
---
Myers is a really fun killer, so I'd definitely do him first.
---
It goes together so damn well, by far the best 80s remix I've heard
---
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a pretty common opinion. He‚Äôs def one of the worst killers in the game at high level play, but his teachable perks make it so he‚Äôs valuable if you play killer.
---
Anytime :) My friends and I are game developers who are obsessed with this game, so we always have fun with posts like this that suggest new ideas.
---
See you on front page
---
Ruin nurse lol
---
You‚Äôre an idiot, glad you‚Äôre banned
---
Doesn't prestiging make the rarer stuff show up more often?
---
Look at it as if ANYBODY survives, you win. Your contribution made it so someone else wins, so you win. As a killer, if you kill one person without camping or tunneling, you win. This one *strategic thinking pattern* has helped me enjoy the game 10x more and even when I‚Äôm tunneled or camped as a survivor, if I survive its much more satisfying, if I die, that‚Äôs just how the killer needs to play to feel good about themselves, so let them enjoy it and move on to the next one :) 
---
It‚Äôs all about making a game inside the game. How many boxes can I loot and how rare can I get with ace in the hole and plunderers? How long can I loop for this game vs the last? How many flashlight saves and hook rescues can I get this time? Can I cleanse all the totems while bringing small game and urban evasion? I like to throw on super random perks sometimes that have zero chemistry and see how far I get. Honestly it helps me to find use in some seemingly useless perks
---
So I wanted to do 
---
my wraith daily today 3minutes chasing. I don't really play wraith and he's only level 10 so the trial starts and I find this baby survivor which I chase for whole 3 minutes
---
FF end of the game I got my adept wraith
---
So there's that
---
Yeah, but you cant maximise the bonuses as well with his box.
---
People don‚Äôt like to discuss things here they just like to hate so that‚Äôll explain your downvotes. I can almost swear on the fact that this subreddit is made of at least 90% children because the unnecessary hate and amount of people that are assholes here is almost unbelievable.
---
&gt;Plus we already have a clown. And a better looking one at that.
---
Oh nah lmaooo
---
What a clown
---
lol dj Jeff would want you to get up and dance buddy.
---
Good way to sum up autohaven wreckers
---
Stealth perks keep you alive and doing gens, if you build nothing but loop perks, you should be happy others are running stealth. That‚Äôs how a good team is balanced.
---
I doubt the downvoters have and will even read it, they just see the title and instantly dislike. Entity forbid we have an intellectual debate on this subreddit.
---
Micheal was shot multiple times fell from a balcony stabbed and still managed to get back up has the strength to pick up a teen and put a whole kitchen knife through a torso to a door
---
Jackdaw actually
---
Indeed , I'm back playing though!
---
Nice indeed
---
My point exactly. It is very possible you could have been banned for something else. 
---
EDIT: Maybe Griefing under "Targeting a player repeatedly to ruin their game experience" if you were dodging lobbies just to get paired up with him but that's one of those hard-to-prove things and to be blunt I'm sure MANY people are guilty of bringing a Mori or Iri Heads if they got a toxic player they recognize. Once I got a guy 3 lobbies in a row.
---
I thought Stream Sniping is explicitly when you're watching a streamer's stream to get an advantage. That isn't bannable but going out of your way to get into his lobby might be classified as "target him across multiple matches to ruin his experience" although when I think of that phrase I imagine a killer facecamping a certain player because a Survivor can't really "target" a killer.
---
thanks , I'm back to playing though!
---
Hahaha, amazing! did you burn luck that round?
---
Is anyone else getting an "Initialization Error" on Xbox?
---
Why n o t?
---
not that long , couple of days a couple of matches here and there
---
Having the same problem. Restarted my Xbox and game still no dice -.-
---
I'm getting it on Xbox also.
---
*if all 4 bring BNP you‚Äôll complete a gen fully in 5 seconds* 
---
I can just imagine being the killer and a shroud is used, then after I move a tiny bit a gen gets popped. I‚Äôd just stop and think about that for a minute like, excuse me wtf? Lmao
---
Yeah
---
Idk, I guess they must have? I mean I'm rank 3 and I suck. Lol
---
My girlfriend too
---
It's still gonna have to be The Shape for me.
---
Me too on Xbox , does it have anything to do with the new update?
---
Good, killers need to be punished for using trash noed. Sad they get rewarded for getting destroyed the whole game.
---
Using literally all of your energy to produce enough force to stun the killer. Totally not exhausting. Makes sense said no one ever.
---
What's the glitch
---
Yeah, that's my feels exactly! Right now I'm just praying the killer doesn't find me first. It's so embarrassing not really knowing what either Freddy or the new sneakyface actually does.
---
Distressing perk for blood point farming? Does the 100% more bloodpoints in the deviousness catagory go past the 8000 max in game? Or does it just help you get to the 8000 max
---
I cant stress this enough, but everyone need to play both as survivors and killers. It will broaden not only your game sense, muscle memory etc, but also your perspective on both sides. I also believe that this will lessen the toxicity and make the community so much better :D
---
Yeah youre bullshiting us lmao, new reddit account why I even bother
---
Yup. On Xbox after hotfix.. hope it doesn't last
---
Grog
---
I play both, literally no excuse ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It's not. But this sub has the lowest collective intelligence out of any sub on reddit, so it doesn't surprise me that this is how people think it works.
---
Congrats :)
---
Oh thank goddd I thought it was just me.
---
But that trapper girth ?
---
I agree with you 100% on that
---
When you hit rank 5 then it's time to go full on toxic, its the only way to beat em
---
Why would i bullshit about being banned?
---
Yeah i meant people who dc and grief their teammates
---
I don‚Äôt know if you literally ever play Killer, but I‚Äôm in purple ranks rn, and I constantly face a SWF with 3 people at rank 1-3 and 1 person at rank 12. and let me tell you, that rank 12 is definitely supposed to be a red rank, but they sandbag so that they can face lower rank killers and get easy wins, and they do it for their friends too
---
Thanks Dwight
---
I remembered why I stopped playing Identity V, extremely shit controls, 500+ ping EVERY MATCH, literally 80% of killers facecamps, exactly what you said
---
Well some killers like pig it might work, but most killers are large and brutal AND powered by the entity.  All the killers were "blessed" by the entity, a normal human couldn't survive multiple pallets dropped on their heads, not the way killers can.
---
Besides that it's a handful of survivors against a brutal killer with weapons ranging from knives to crude cleavers.  Any killers that aren't large and imposing have some special property like the ability to warp through solid objects.
---
It wouldn't be impossible, but anyone that's not ghost face, maybe pig, clown, or legion would be almost impossible to defeat
---
That‚Äôs so horrible of them. 
---

I have just been a rank 14 killer aganst SWF Ranks 12, 10, 5 &amp; 5. I got absolutely destroyed and a little bullied with the flashlights, but I know a fair game when I play one. The sad soul crawled out of the exit and it was bugged so I carried them to the other exit, still bugged. So I carried them to try find the hatch, we got to the hatch and they d/c. I was literally giving it to them because they should have got it! 
---
I don‚Äôt understand... üòü
---
Nope. Yes the targeting a player was the one. But in dead by daylight what is classed as ruining somebodys experience.
---
Regardless someone will win and someone will lose that ruins the others experience. If he loses the game and de-pips just because I / others played better than him is that a bannable offence now?
---
I mostly played survivor so it was him that could ruin my experience my mori which he did often etc. just a massive grey area.
---
Doesn't work that way. Stealth players mainly ruin the game for those people who dont care if they're spotted, cause they continue to stealth well into late game and still haven't been chased while everyone else is on death hook. That isn't very team oriented. In the PC community I do not know of one survivor that stealths and is deemed "Good" by the majority.
---
Alert is good for that reason cause you can actually see the killers aura and can tell if they‚Äôre headed your way after a chase. Wait. Ima run alert, bond, empathy, kindred. Ultimate knowledge
---
I *AM*the token low rank, along with the rest of my friends since we all suck
---
But then you can't see scratch marks
---
A licensed one with real money, the rest with shards
---
It took me 230 hours in this game to get to purple ranks, people learn stuff in different time, I still struggle to loop some killers and in some maps, yet I managed to get to rank 7
---
I can see where reddit gets its bad rep from. You are literally jerking off right now.
---
Guess I should avoid idiots that pretend to be smart, I'm only gonna get dragged down to your level.
---
Yep same here and on Xbox as well..
---
As a survivor main i usually play spirit, hag or Michael if i ever play killer.
---
They are fun, can give jump-scares and yeah. I'd go for one of them!
---
I keep getting Initiaization Errors, and can't play the game on Xbox One.
---
You literally said you sniped him. You made a username saying sniping is bannable. Now you say that you weren't sniping, you were just in a game, and got banned for simply playing better than he did.
---
That's what you're saying. That you got banned for being better than someone who was streaming. Think long and hard, my dude. Cuz that would be a pretty serious accusation, saying that you did nothing wrong, just played better, and got banned for it.
---
Especially since you admitted to sniping him lol.
---
This is so true.... it‚Äôs what they deserve
---
Came to this page just to ask the same question
---
Got the same issue as well
---
Supposedly one of the devs said the addons ARE in fact working but the effect on "Acceleration" is barely noticeable and not what most players are looking for.
---
I remember people would get into arguments about this. There was a video somewhere comparing Leatherface's chainsaw charge with different addon combos and the Chili addons didn't seem to make ANY difference. It's weird because if it DOES make you hit top speed faster, you should technically cover more distance since you're at top speed sooner and thus should cover more distance for the entire duration, but it doesn't seem to work that way?
---
One idea I saw posted somewhere was to change the addons so it increases the duration of the sprint, like you get a few extra chainsaw swipes with Chili, and MUCH more with Award Winning Chili. That seems like a better concept.
---
I'm close in rank to you as a Killer as I tend to jump between ranks 11 and 14, being rank 12 - 13 most of the time. SWF groups often do end up causing you to end up again Survivors out of your league. I swear I recently had a whole group and because of the Survivors was rank 15 I ended up again three people ranging from ranks 1 to 4. Just way too good for my abilities. Pallet loop gods who really know how to work a god tier flashlights that they know exactly when to use. Sure, they can maximise their skills but there's no need to rub it in. It doesn't make them look good ganging up weaker Killers.
---
I mean, not "deserve" but it does get a cackle out of me
---
I would disagree. Even with the fact that it can be destroyed almost instantly, it is still the best killer perk in the game imo. Think of any 4 perk build without Ruin and I guarantee you will have more success by replacing one of your perks with Ruin.
---
He also survived a explosion multiple times and has been ran over too
---
They day I can report 4 man swf gen rushers who win within 5 minutes you can report face campers lmfao
---
Status Effect names aren't meant to be taken 100% literally. If they were taken 100% literally than Survivors would be (By the actual definition) Exhausted all the time from all the running they do. 
---
All Exhaustion specifically actually does as a Status Effect, is prevent specific perks from triggering, especially perks that grant 150% Haste. The purpose of Exhaustion is to not allow the Survivor to gain multiple speed bonus during a single chase.
---
Head On is the only perk that causes Exhaustion without also granting somekinda speed bonus or even actually heal the Survivor in I chase. Head On should definitely have a *cooldown*, but Exhaustion from a balance stand one just doesn't make sense on Head On.
---
Nothing at all. Quite odd.
---
Yh this shit happens far more often than it should, last time it happened to me was on the last double bloodpoints and it lasted for an entire fucking day. PGJSF
---
Dude exact same boat. I posted the lobby hours ago. 
---
Huntress is probably just prone to bullying
---
I think people often confuse survivors being toxic wirh survivors being good
---
Same as me, on Xbox as well
---
*inhales* F E C K
---
Your connection to the host might be bad
---
"Sucking at something is the first step to being kinda' good at something." -Jake the dog
---
But the facts here are:
---
You stated that ‚ÄúSWF 3/4 = you‚Äôre an asshole‚Äù so I simply remarked that not all SWF are assholes and aren‚Äôt just trying to rank up from using lower ranks. This comes from me playing as a 4 man SWF that isn‚Äôt toxic and just enjoys the game.
---
Then you stated that I ‚Äúlet the level 16 host and yet I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm not being toxic‚Äù. That was a fabricated lie you pulled out to push the debate in your way.
---
I then called you out on that and you began to ignore the fact that you did make up that detail. That‚Äôs harsh denial.
---
You then proceeded to lie again and say that you ‚Äúnever said all SWF are big meanies‚Äù (or something along those lines) when you clearly did say that anyone who plays as a 3/4 man SWF is an asshole.
---
All my argument here is that not all SWF are toxic assholes, and this is a true statement. And to further my point, if you call people an asshole for using a part of the game, (like NOED, SWF, Ruin) you yourself are the one being an asshole. 
---
You on the other hand keep focusing on other elements of the conversation like how I nit pick at your mental capacity and call you a cry baby. I don‚Äôt care that you admit that it was a close game, fact is you still came on here to cry about it, that means, you‚Äôre being a cry baby. And it doesn‚Äôt make me ‚Äúfeel bad‚Äù and I don‚Äôt just play SWF, I also run solo and Killer, I‚Äôve played for 3 years, it‚Äôs a game I‚Äôve enjoyed for years and I‚Äôm very happy my friends now have it and play with me.
---
Too bad there‚Äôs so many toxic assholes like you tho lol.
---
Would you care to keep going?
---
Sniper billy incoming
---
I was the guy hes had for a while Harder Daddy, Also if u watched any of the games can you tell me how i was a asshole?
---
In this Topic, OP targets a popular streamer to purposely try to stream snipe him repeatedly to harass him, then comes on reddit to act like he was unfairly banned solely for stream sniping.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
In this case "crutch perks" are whatever each side claims they are. Lol. So even trivial shit can be a "crutch" these days.
---
Yes it happens from time to time from people with a few screws loose.
---
I did snipe him , i literally said that. I got banned for griefing by stream sniping and it was under communication abuse. It literally makes 0 sense , I'm back to playing its fine just warning other people :) if you see someone with [T.TV](https://T.TV) in their name or not best avoid
---
I'm a loyal bih.
---
What platform? Both consoles have no problems I've heard
---
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been mentioned here before but you should really get the offerings back
---
BBQ, MYC, Pop, Agi. I couldn't justify giving any of them up for Ruin and I do just fine without it, so I disagree with your guarantee. Brutal Strength, Bamboozle, Enduring, Spirit Fury, I'd use all of those over Ruin and do, and have more success with those perks than Ruin.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cmw7qo/a_weird_glitch_i_found/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Unfortunately this is completely unavoidable even in a SWF as most petty killers won't dare to stray far from the hook. Basically,  if the killer wants to do it it will happen. Your only hope for this really is that you're saved with BT and you also have DS and force it on the killer to prolong the chase. But I agree it does suck balls that you get punished for the killer being a dick. They get punished to however, although it's a lot less than they should. I've experienced this at every rank btw.
---
Ditto on Xbox onex
---
As a Pig main, I'm biased. But as an avid John Carpenter fan, I'm inclined to say Michael. 
---
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
---
Why is soft tunneling, or defensive camping bad?
---
Got the same issue
---
Nice wall of text, keep crying while calling me a crybaby it'll totally start to work eventually
---
I mean, as a survivor, i've had multiple games where the rest of my team just made bad decision after bad decision, and there is only so much one person can do to influence the outcome. I can't repair all 5 gens by myself because someone managed to get hooked at the basement within the first minute with the killer camping him, and then the rest of my team died trying to rescue him. At least with the hatch, i have the chance to not lose my items and scrounge up 5k bloodpoints for escaping without being dragged down by idiots. 
---
Besides, there is a very real possibility the killer is gonna find the hatch before me, so even then, it's still not a guaranteed escape.
---
I can hear him saying it &gt;.&gt;
---
Healing yourself in 32 seconds or a survivor healing you in 16 seconds it's the same. The time wasted in both is the same (16 both, 32 alone)
---
Dude. I wrote an apology *eight* hours ago. I apologized *multiple* times. I edited my original comment to include my sincere apology in it. And yet, you keep coming back to it and paraphrasing me in the most hostile way you could think of, telling me "I can't realize that" (which I did, and **because I realized it, I apologized**, including my original intend and apologizing for the way I delivered it, again saying that I didn't intend to hurt/belittle anyone).
---
Another part of *How to Socialize 101* is **knowing** when you are wrong, **accept** it and when a person has accepted it, **leave it at that** instead of continuing to prove a point, which has **already been proven**. 
---
If you can't leave it at that, maybe the Internet, a place *for socializing*, isn't for you\*\*\*\*\*  
---
\*\*\*\*\* the last part was a sarcastic answer, in response to your overly harsh criticism, making me out to be an emotionless mess who does nothing but hurt people, as if I'd run around telling people "you're fat", "you suck", "go die". Keep it real, mate.
---
Dude this is the only fucking game where a hotfix makes the game not to initialize. Their incompetence is fucking unbelievable and I'm sick and tired of this ridiculous shit.
---
This has been my ringtone for months. I love it
---
This is some Monto-esque shit right here. Doing a weird challenge and accompanying a name with it.
---
I mean it‚Äôs no longer the best survivor perk in the game, not even in the top 4 imo. But I think people calling the perk bad are crazy. No mither and left behind are bad perks. Self care is not bad at all.
---
How would death work? Lile set traps and stuff?
---
Ive had this as my ringtone for months. I LOVE IT!
---
my guy, i struggle to get past purple ranks every time, even though i'm 500 hours in. i don't no-life this game, i play to have fun, so yeah, i kinda suck, but that's okay. attitudes like this are really toxic.
---
&gt; I was fine when it was 2 generators or whatever before it opened
---
No it wasn't. Not so often (thankfully) the last survivor at 4 gens would get salty and troll the killer by holding the game hostage for as long as he could or the killer DCed.
---
Hatch spawning no matter what is meant for the killer to be able to force the game to end, not to give the last survivor a escape. What do you want devs to do? Just reveal the aura of the last survivor at 4 or 5 gens with no hatch so you can claim your free kill?
---
Hitting a great skill check yourself does not consume a token, only when hitting good skill checks tokens are consumed. This also applies to hitting a good skill check when Ruin is active.
---
Well if it‚Äôs not then that‚Äôs really dumb. If I‚Äôm playing a game about slasher villains then I expect killing to be the objective.
---
I'm more of a Survivor but def would like to go with both once I unlock a new Killer after today's Shrine of Secrets refresh.
---
Where did you get that first paragraph from?
---
When the entity tries to put its own version of fidget spinnners in a trial
---
I forgot where I read it from but with dedicated servers, if a killer disconnects early in the match then the survivors will keep their offerings
---
&gt; Nobody said 3 survivors with stealth perks doing gens 
---
My point is that in a hypothetical scenario where you've effectively got 3 loopers in the form of one and 3 regular stealth teammates to be on gens, the team of *just* loops will get gens done quicker.
---
I'm implying stealth survivors are orders of magnitude more useless than survivors who can loop. It's not a matter of fulfilling a role or a niche or facet- having a stealth build isn't like being a support class in a game like overwatch or something. It's basically a gradual, persistent soft throw, and the skill level needed for stealth is so low and caps out so soon anyone who plays this game more than 100 hours quickly tries to adapt looping/ running chases efficiently and well.
---
Myers is better
---
I don‚Äôt like self-care because the prompts are all jacked up on console and I keep self-caring at pallets instead of dropping then on killers.
---
Because then players would realize 90% of the perks/addons in the game are worthless
---
Mangled is only 20% healing speed reduction LULW
---
Difference being you still get a rescue or some gen repair off during the time.
---
Seriously, stop relying on Self Care and your games will go smoother, I promise that.
---
I‚Äôll definitely switch up an offering when this happens. Not necessarily a Mori, because that would be petty, but something that‚Äôll hinder survivors... just a bit.
---
It is. I run self care and another perk that helps me do things faster when I‚Äôm injured. I only heal when I feel like I really need to.
---
Yeah, you could find another survivor to heal you, but it's not always an option, and in some cases, searching for another survivor, and then getting to a fairly safe location to heal might take more than the 16 seconds you would shave off of Self Care. So while in theory, you are right, it's not always the case in practise.
---
Hotline Miami DLC when
---
Stakeout is a pretty fun perk to run for tapp
---
The Dev , or CM that I was talking too.
---
I got a response when I put in a ticket. They just said known issue and currently working but no idea when it will be done -_-
---
You are amazing what a great idea
---
Hitbox trailing behind you
---
The second four perks I listed aren't a build, just other perks I wouldn't switch out for Ruin.
---
Agi is as underrated as Ruin is overrated IMO. Faster actions mean more time chasing, and transporting is one of the slowest killer actions, one that you can have to do a dozen times. It allows you to apply immense pressure.
---
Not only that, but choosing your hook rather than just going to the closest one means a targeted BBQ read on somewhat nearby survivors, avoiding body blockers and saboteurs by outspeeding them, and faster movement speed can mean chasing down survivors while you're carrying. Agi is a multi purpose perk where Ruin serves one purpose and is finite. I'll take faster actions over temporarily slower gens, I get a lot more value out of Agi than Ruin. Action animations are the real killers.
---
It sounds like you didnt even read my post, I said I love the changes with endgame so games don't go on indefinitely, I just think there should be a little harder requirements to escape then "be the last on alive and find this thing before the killer". Im just saying maybe instead of the hatch auto opening the survivor has to do a skill check on it, or survive for like an extra 30 seconds, or start atleast 1 generator or something.
---
No where near the same amount of upvotes as the killer version looooooool
---
It‚Äôs a legit strategy yes, but it‚Äôs triggering as a survivor sometimes especially if they‚Äôre bad at looping or escaping a chase. Bad survivors don‚Äôt know how to deal with that, so they complain instead cause it‚Äôs easier than just getting good. I‚Äôm a survivor main and see it all the time. I‚Äôll use BT and even take a hit for them and they‚Äôll still get rekt.
---
This is such a good idea, really hope Behaviour sees this and get inspired
---
I 100% agree with you. Its silly to have the Killer depip just because a survivor was lucky and had the Hatch spawn next to him after he he couldn't even complete 1 gen.
---
But personally i stopped caring. I now even let the last survivor escape on purpose and enjoy abusing bad survivors at low ranks.
---
But my suggestion to you is to always slug the last 2 survivors to avoid this from happening.
---
You admitted to purposely seeking him out and stream sniping him on multiple occassions.
---
If you can't grasp how that's harrassment, you're delusional.
---
This wasn't a one off. This was you purposely trying to fuck with him.
---
THAT's why you were banned. Stop playing the innocent victim or acting like it was the stream sniping alone that got you banned.
---
.....
---
Difficult choice lmao
---
Joey and Frank ain't get any love with this though lol
---
I'm glad someone caught the reference.  Hexadecimal was my favorite character from the show.
---
They updated again tonight and broke their own game. Again.
---
It would still work the same if the killer finds the hatch he would be able to lock it shut and start the timer, its just a way so the survivor cant insta-escape, gives killer a few more seconds at least. Im not actually trying to push for any one of these suggestions specifically, I just think the hatch needs changed somehow, it is feels really at odds with how the rest of the game is.
---
I thought the movie was great. They need a little exposition for people who haven't seen the first one, and I thought the climax and ending was great cuz it isn't confirmed that MM is dead. His body is never shown and you can hear him breathing in the credits.
---
Idk, that's just my opinion.
---
I love when hotfixes for trivial issues make it so I can't play the game at all.
---
Spine Chill has a bigger radius than the Terror Radius, *and* works even against killers with no terror radius.
---
It's fine. Just thought I'd explain.
---
I do pretty good as Myers but stopping to stalk as Ghostface just doesn‚Äôt suit my play style. 
---
In the beginning of the game as myself I like to yoink survivors off the generators and take them by surprise. You have to crouch and go slower to do that as ghostface. Plus I find it hard to mark survivors as Ghostface without them seeing me and running away. 
---
I may get into him eventually but Myers is my preference for now.
---
How would you depip if you killed 3? Unless they gave up and you only got 3 hooks you shouldn't depip, you should at least get 1 pip. I think this is a great move and alongside with the emblem system, they don't get a pip easily if they did nothing. They gotta repair, heal, escape and being chased to rank up. But if only one of the four factors is met but the other 3 aren't, you're gonna 100% depip.
---
yeah there's a reason why most high rank killers (at least that I've played) don't run ruin, myself included. at that point you need to rely more on your player skill and less on perk rng and hoping that the survivors are bad enough to not know how to play around it. also why most red ranks play spirit lmao
---
Heading straight to pallet town.
---
Can you please use the word, "sweaty" in a sentence?
---
Someone just sent me a message calling me sweaty and I'm sure that was meant as an insult...but like, what the fuck kind of insult? What does it even mean?!
---
He followed up by saying I should go outside more. Is he made I got a 4k? I'm rank 11 lmao literally not good. 
---
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE DBD SALTMINES.
---
&gt;ruin nurse
---
You're lucky. Never had a game hostage before.
---
My guess is it's gonna be the next reworked map.
---
This is a weird point, NOED is completely different lol. for one it uses a skill slot, totems are easy to break, and its not a core mechanic that can appear in any game. It does reward you in a way for not doing great, but its a perk you have to equip which gives you less room for other stuff, the hatch is inate.
---
I use it as the complete opposite to say hey the killer is gone come get me
---
It's not great, but it's still better than any other perk that slows the game down. Pop is the only other one even worth running.
---
they didnt tunnel tho? You see someone else get hit, and then they lose them. The dc was rude, but we've all had bad days, its hard to want to stick it out when you feel like you are playing like garbage. Not trying to blame the survivors for trying to survive tho.
---
Bruh I get like 3-5 head on's a match if you play it right, combine it with quick and quiet and it can make tiles with no pallet a get out of jail free card :D
---
This is easily the best chapter concept I‚Äôve seen. I can tell you put a lot of thought into this
---
So let's say we take away Self Care, now what happens in those scenarios?
---
You seem to be under the impression that suddenly these players would transform and become all-star MVPS for your team. Where more likely they'll probably just hide and crawl along walls/terrain hoping to bump into someone else. 
---
And then we're back at this discussion with another perk like Iron Will or Urban Evasion because they're too good at allowing people to hide instead of doing generators.
---
Oh that's happened to me before, it really sucked since I risked my life going back to save and I tried to escape but it wouldn't let me and I ended up dead.
---
Because Claudette‚Äôs need someone to scapegoat
---
I once had a killer yell gen rush at me and when I said we also did totems and gen rush is not a thing the killer yelled more saying ever heard of totem rushing lol
---
I always find it funny when you open a locker as killer and you see the survivors scared face but with no sound.
---
The thing is, the temporarily slower gens can be the thing that starts your snowball and wins you the game. While it‚Äôs active, ruin applies 10x more pressure than agitation could ever hope to. It‚Äôs also pretty much the only thing that slows the game down passively. You don‚Äôt need to kick gens like pop, get downs like agi, etc. Ruin slows the game down just by existing. Even once it‚Äôs destroyed, as long as you managed to get at least 1-2 hooks in then the effects of Ruin will be felt for the entire game. Having only 1 gen pop after your first few chases compared to 2 or 3 is massive pressure applied to the survivors. 
---
To me agitation seems more like quality of life than anything. Sure it saves some time when transporting to hooks and might even let you get a basement hook when you normally wouldn‚Äôt be able to, but that time saved is nothing compared to the time ruin gives you. 
---
And you can say that good survivors wont even look for ruin and just power through it, but I‚Äôd have 2 counterpoints to that. First, even at rank 1 you will rarely run into 4 legitimate god tier survivors who can power through ruin and loop the killer no problem. Second, even if you do happen to run into 4 survivors that are just that good at the game, you‚Äôre gonna get shit on regardless of your perk choice unless you pick spirit or nurse. I still hold by my stance that pretty much any 4 perk loadout without ruin would be immediately improved by using ruin.
---
So will I, but I'm not so delusion to release it's a bad thing to do, I'm well aware of that
---
That's a massive lie. Unless you're playing at literally white rank, than that never happens.
---
I've I my seen a few Head On stuns as Survivor and I've only been stunned by Head On like 2 or 3 times.
---
What I want to know is what happened before. Was Kate being a dick, or did the killer just get their ass kicked and then just sorta get pissed and stop caring about making a good game? Not advocating for the face camp either way, still would want more context
---
not at all actually. I very much prefer new legion, especially with his increased base movement speed. legion before was just not fun. people always used shit tactics that made the survivors what to commit end game
---
Dead Hard isn't a crutch perk, usually because it only stops a person from going down for about 20 seconds at best.
---
BT is necessary to stop campers.
---
I can't think of any other crutch perk.
---
I can think of a few for killer though, most notably, Rancor.
---
"Oh you did well the whole game? Well congrats, now the killer knows where you are, and can one shot down you and then Mori you!"
---
Same here. I uninstalled and am currently reinstalling, I'll let y'all know if that works for me. If not next step is submitting a trouble ticket.
---
Thanks for the help and i will check out whisper.
---
I just always had the thought that the killer can see you doing it as well and could camp around the corner or something while you signal it‚Äôs safe
---
ruin is un~~ruin~~reliable and when you tell killers that, they take it personally and disagree without even reading what you wrote. Ruin is not a bad perk, it is just overrated tbh. Also letting ruin apply pressure for you is a bad habit that many killers tend to do
---
How could they do this to my boy otz I‚Äôm shaking and crying
---
Dev's did say they would eventually look at Leatherface. 
---
Leatherface's addons are a complete joke right now. They transplanted Hillbilly's addons over, renamed a few for lore reasons (Thompson's Mix became The Grease, Death and Doom engravings became Knife Scratches and The Beast's Marks), and replaced the Steering Addons since Leatherface doesn't have a steering mechanic with the nearly pointless acceleration addons. (Spiked Boots became Chili, and Thompson's Moonshine became Award-Winning Chili. They didn't even remove the extra bump penalty from Thompson's Moonshine when they turned it into Award Winning Chili.)
---
I don't know if Bubba needs only the chili addons reworked, but I would have preferred if he got WAY more unique addons like an "Unstoppable Chainsaw" one where bumping into walls and pallets just makes you skid or break the pallet while not aborting the charge, or an Ultra-Rare one which gives you zero terror radius when not revving your saw for serious jumpscares. [Inspired by Kirk's death in the first TCM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QSsVgPbmeU) You'd be sneaky as fuck. Either as part of the addon, or as a different addon, revving would make your terror radius the entire map like Legion. Everyone be like "Shit where is Bubba?" and once you spin up the saw EVERYONE freaks out wondering if you're coming for them or who's about to get chainsawed.
---
Other addons I can think of could be a built-in Franklin's Demise for chainsaw hits.
---
Maybe a (Very likely OP, but Ultra Rare) addon similar to Tombstone for Myers. Your chainsaw would take MUCH longer to rev up, have a shorter attack duration, slower speed, MUCH longer cooldown if you miss, etc. basically requiring you to get creative with how you land chainsaws (Mindgames? Bodyblocking people in a corner?) but you do, the survivor gets knocked down and Leatherface's Mori animation starts (No hammer hit, but the "Slice them in half" part of the animation onwards) and the survivor simply fuckin' dies. 
---
Like there's a ton of cool ideas one can come up with for LF addons but the devs simply copy-pasted Billy's over and MANY of them are useless like chainsaw noise reduction since unlike Billy, Leatherface only chainsaws at close range directly in a chase, so reducing the "Stereo hearing range" for the chainsaw is pointless.
---
Gen rush is a thing tho. But a LOT of people dont know what it is. A shitty killer not pressuring gens and getting punished for it did not get gen rushed. But a squad with just gen overclock builds that use offerings to spawn together, and then just brute force gens as fast as they can, ignoring everything is, is gen rushing
---
This is dope and would make the matches be extremely unsettling. It‚Äôd put a horror element back into the game.
---
it‚Äôs unfun for the killer, sure you feel like a big bad killer at rank 20 but anything beyond rank 10 makes you feel like you‚Äôre the survivor vs four killers
---
I really don't know why they "fixed" it. Why is it so needlessly specific?
---
Omg I can relate so much to this post. I had a match literally a couple of days ago where I've been told I didn't help my teammates. Yea sorry I was busy doing 4 gens on my own when you were just farming each other under the hook, with the killer right next to you. Honestly it makes me feel a little better to see that I'm not the only one dealing with shit like this...
---
You probably haven't witnessed actually bullying, just effective teammates / looping.
---
Actually bullying is when they're not doing gens and all 4 just looping the killer and tbagging to stale the game because they know they have control.
---
Doing the objectives while keeping the killer distracted = good
---
Purposefully harassing the killer while stalling / not doing the objectives = rude

Yeah NEVER stalk without leaning, those addons are useless

I just played M1 plague to get the achievement. She's a really badly designed killer.

Yes, an alt is necessary for... thoses... Subreddits.

Everyone: **WELL CLEARLY THERE IS MORE TO THE STORY HERE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU THIS CANT BE UNPREVOKED**

I've made so many Streamers flip their shit live with Basement Bubba, it's hilarious.

Hell i expected the same and i was that way for a long but the emblem system changed things.

Purple perk for left behind is a cursed image

You right you right

Facts are facts
---
Was going to say that those 2 were probably together and the 20 brought the 1 down to him.
---
I believe it was mentioned briefly in one of the streams that they'd like to rework this perk, but no specifics. Throwing an idea of mine out there, but the perk could reveal the location of the hatch when everyone is dead.
---
Hello, I had this issue a few months back myself, you can see my post on the DBD fourms about it here  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/66393/xbox-an-error-has-occurred-and-the-game-was-unable-to-save-your-profile-please-restart-your-game#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/66393/xbox-an-error-has-occurred-and-the-game-was-unable-to-save-your-profile-please-restart-your-game#latest) 
---
Everyone in that fourm discussion had the same issue as me, and as a result we all had to contact support to get our save wiped and all our BPs restored. Although this looks like a different bug to what we had at the time so that might not be necessary. You're best course of action is to open a ticket at  [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)  and report the bug to see what they have to say. You may not have the same issue as I had, but this type of bug has been in the game since its been out, and usually results in you having to contact support and getting your account wiped  and them giving all your BPs back. Upon a wipe you keep your devotion and shards, but are set back to all level 1s with a rank of rank 20. I had the issue and was reimbursed all my BPs i ever earned, and lets say levelling everyone back to P3 for the next 6-8 hours was not fun.
---
Really? I didn't know, sorry.
---
It's wonderful!
---
No clue. I just think it would be an interesting killer
---
No Mither has a place in a gen jockey build, though.
---
Depends on the rank. The vast majority of my games at rank 4 are against swf.
---
You've got all the basics, as long as you don't have a toxic altitude you should be good!üëç
---
Lolicon pls go.
---
Ahh now you‚Äôve just given up fully, that‚Äôs amusing, seems when stated with the facts you can‚Äôt handle it. 
---
Have a good one bud!
---
Because the devs might look in this thread, I experienced the exit gates escape bug yesterday. Luckily the killer was nice enough to help me find the hatch before time ran out.
---
It is an in game perk so it helps getting you to 8000, if it says post game then it adds past 8000
---
Naruto run is probably as fast as legion in frenzy
---
Lol hatch is killer sided now and you still want it to be easier. That‚Äôs sad. You move faster than survs so it‚Äôs easier to find plus you could always slug. But then again if started slugging you‚Äôd probably complain about unbreakable being ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù.
---
You‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre one of the many god nurses on ps4, I see. Now I know why I see so my nurses at rank 1, because there‚Äôs loads of them /s
---
If ur on Xbox the same thing is happening to me but with everything, problem with Xbox itself just wait it out I guess
---
Nice lol
---
So Nurse doesn‚Äôt need Ruin, but Billy does in your opinion? Interesting
---
Nice thanks man
---
Never feel bad about destroying Noed.
---
Thanks
---
That sound pretty OP
---
Lol! I‚Äôve never seen this before!! Epic!!!
---
As a killer i‚Äôm finding a ton more people msging me gg than before, which is surprising considering what I‚Äôve heard about the community.
---
It did not.
---
This.

I'm a rank 1 killer, have been for as long as DbD has been on console. So, I have tried, and I see how wrong you are.
---
Yea but I never really has that happen before so I always do without hesitation unless it's a stealth killer
---
That's good then because that's not what I was experiencing at all
---
same and it's getting me angry dude
---
I need to see what all the fuss is about with Dead 'Ard and Adrenaline.  I've yet to use either perk, but I've heard so much bitching about them. Lol. That and Sprint Burst.  I'm I missing the party?
---
It‚Äôs also good if you want to know if a killer is gonna go back to the hooked survivor, depending on if you know which way they went.
---
This post was made by a rank 1 killer and survivor.
---
CWS or even standard stalkers probably think it's a no-brainer that anyone would be as obsessed as they are too, but to people on the outside it's just laughably pathetic tbh.
---
pretty good repost.
---
I'd be up for this
---
if i'm injured i'm going to heal myself before getting you off the hook unless your struggling then i would get you off the hook first.
---
If people would bring medkits instead of toolboxes or flashlights this wouldn‚Äôt be that big of an issue. 
---
Medkits with charge + speed addons &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Naw. Dead Hard takes practice to use efficiently, and Sprint Burst makes you walk everywhere.
---
Adrenaline is an odd perk.
---
You might not benefit from it, and there's a chance it could even screw you over.
---
But when it DOES help you, it helps alot.
---
Dude on Xbox, what I play on, I get messages from survivors almost every damn match lol
---
She literally facecamped the hook at range mindlessly throwing hatchets at Laurie, then when Laurie got unhooked went after her across the map missing literally all her hatchets, then when she finally got the down and got DSed instantly ragequit.
---
I would imagine Feng tried taking the aggro of her but the tunnel vision was real and she kept going for Laurie across the whole map.
---
This is the killer equivalent of survivors DCing on their first down, the Huntress was a salty DCer who got mad she was losing, nothing more.
---
Since I don't play a lot of survivor I don't know how frustrating it is playing against NOED, I don't run it but maybe it is problematic, idk. Back to the hatch, I'm fine with it being an easier escape for a good player if their team gets wiped, but right now I dont think it functions well as that. It isnt just a small chance of escaping, its probably around 40%, and its a dumb luck random race. I just think there should be some other small requirement or task that should be fulfilled so it doesnt come down to pure frustrating chance.
---
Whatever helps a narcissist feel better about themselves
---
People do pointless stuff all the time. I don't know why you're lying about it. Guess you're just bored.
---
doesnt work on my Galaxy s7
---
I disagree on stealth personally but thx for the tip on tracking blood. What perks do you use on the survivor looping build?
---
So then he didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôd ruin was there until after his friends told him about it I assume and then they found it and got rid of it and didn‚Äôt tell him? Some bad teammates right there.
---
Gotcha lol thanks man. Just sucks I bought ash and cant use him hahahaha
---
Maybe it could make the hatch louder and only reveal it if the killer is within a certain proximity to it
---
how about small game, but for the hatch and doors
---
Then your head exists in the sand.
---
A moment of silence for our beloved locker boi.

The Doc in the picture must run a No Shock build...

Hi, thanks for the speedy comment ! Could you explain to me what you see when you‚Äôre trying to use the app ? :) thanks for trying to check it out though !
---
Great post and couldnt agree more with all your points, especially with confusion at them priorotising the doctor for a addon rework who has a nice varied toolkit from multiple viable addons instead of leatherface with his addons being uninspired and largely useless.
---
only reason I can think for the lack of love for leatherface is that everyone already has to buy his dlc to get bbq perk so no reason to also put time into making him more appealing to buy to play as him
---
You don't believe brand new accounts? That's like saying you don't trust babies.
---
Still blaming it on bhvr ;p
---
Bad troll is bad.
---
As long as Ash and Bill are in that group of 4 they'd be okay
---
Swamp, specifically Grim Pantry sucks major ass IMO. Also Mother's Dwelling is pretty aids as well. The general rule of thumb is that any map with a big ass building sprinkled in somewhere is going to spell trouble for any killer not named Nurse.
---
It's also worth noting that unless you play Mirror Myers or Worldwide Skillcheck Doc, there are actually no killer-favored maps unless you happen to be Billy on Rotten Fields/Shelter Woods.
---
not really
---
damn. saw it in a horror page I follow on Instagram and thought of DBD lol
---
Actually those pallets are pretty light. I work with them. The only reason they do stun the killer is because that's how the game works.

Killers are cry babies too sometimes it‚Äôs a two way street. It doesn‚Äôt ruin the game for me it‚Äôs how I choose to play.
---
They could honestly just do, when some one dc they get a 9 percent increases repair and vault speed for survivor. For the lone survivor who plays without swf.
---
We are not the sharpest tools in the shed, so *floor box* draws us around regardless of desire to hide

---
For some reason I cannot paste, would you know a way to fix that?
---
Do we all break two pallets in advance?
---
What platform are you on?
---
I agree, I‚Äôve always tried to convince people that Ruin should be swapped out with other perks at high ranks. There are several other Perks to ‚ÄúSlow Things Down A Little Bit‚Äù (sorry Monto). Dying light gives a 25% Penalty to Gens AND Heals, plus they‚Äôre down one player already. I‚Äôve gone against good killers who have moried their obsession, then used the rest of the game to toy with the survivors and make up the lost bloodpoints. That really makes sure that YOU are in control rather than praying to RNGesus for a good game. Thanat is also a good one on the right killer, with a minimum of 4% and a max of 16% penalty on all actions, it can slow down the game just enough for you get those pips. Pairing Thanat with the right killer can be deadly as well. I personally put mine on Plague because it puts them in a hard situation, either work through the Thanat and give me all the time I could dream of, or Cleanse and give me that sweet sweet Corrupt Purge. It‚Äôs a win/win either way IMO
---
Xbox live is down, not just DBD.

What is NOED?

Ughhh taking way too long
---
That would be sick. You could have El or Will be the survivor. Will could have some weird connection to the Flayer, or El could use some type of force field to stop the Flayer.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm having the same issue. Reaaaaaaaaal fucking annoying
---
Dope tune but honestly I feel like it wouldn't fit the gritty mood of DBD.

Don't tunnel Lauries. Simple.

I lowkey lean into my monitor when I do a lunge attack sometimes hoping to gain more range but then miss miserably

So I've been having fun with Dead by Daylight for about a month now, but no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to wrap my head around hillbilly. I don't know what it is with him, but whenever I play him all my skill just seems to melt away. I get destroyed whenever I play him, whereas with other, "worse" killers like wraith and trapper I can get 3Ks and 4Ks just fine. Is there something I'm missing with people calling him one of the stronger killers? Or is he just not for me?
---
Thank you üòÇ
---
Why be such an asshole?  My post has nothing to do with the build I use, but about how I was unlucky at the beginning of the game.  Think a little about how toxic you are coming to criticize the post simply because I was using a build that you don't like.  I am rank 1 and I play more stealth yes but when I need I get the killer, I go to the hook.  But it still doesn't matter because it's not the focus of the post.  Honestly, what is the purpose of you coming here to criticize something that has nothing to do with the post?  Be a little more mature and less toxic
---
If I'm near another survivor and we're both injured against legion, I usually heal just one of us. A lot of legions run m&amp;a and could potentially down us both. Distracting him with the healthy guy usually ensures that he uses his power
---
XBL is down. It's not a DBD problem.
---
Ugh nooo I was planning to play later on PS4 I feel like this always happens when there's an update
---
Thanks. Now drop ruin :D
---
Its xbox live, not dbd
---
I don't think so?? But I was stuck in rank 20 after not playing for like 6 months for about a week, and then I got back to rank 11 in like a week by making a small algorithm for getting a pip. It does seem kinda stupidly hard though, especially in elo hell with default dwights who hide in lockers 24/7
---
She may be having a different issue, but for OP he‚Äôs on Xbox (which is messing up right now) and can‚Äôt fix this issue so it‚Äôs definitely not because of dbd. If you‚Äôre talking about randomly getting taken off when searching or doing something, I‚Äôve got the same issue
---
Lots of those things you listed almost never happen.
---
Flashlight saves, pallet stun saves, sabotage. Those are very rare to see almost ever happen, let alone work.
---
DS and bodyblocking are pretty common, but for the most part are easily avoided. Also, calling someone bad for using one of their countless moris is hardly fair since I seem to recall plenty of people abusing old MoM and old DS without feeling bad about it. Meanwhile, killers stack up moris since they don't want to wait 10 minutes just for 4 DC's because they wanted to use one.
---
He's not taking a chance because noed will secure more kills
---
That's also totally fine
---
Xbox live is down
---
I remember one time in a match I had done two gens and eventually it was just me and one other survivor so I made the choice to let them die and take the hatch and he blazed at me in the endgame chat saying I just hid until everyone died and didn't do anything
---
Well most people I play against keep their items even if they lose so I don't feel the least bit bad.
---
Yea right now when I click the game it says it‚Äôs a service outage
---
Don't use toxic instaheals then. I dced when this nea used an instaheals then vauled a window to an infinite

there was no link ya dingus. otherwise I would've. if you had reading comprehension skills you'd see that I saw it on a horror Instagram. no tags except #halloweentattoo

I don‚Äôt know, maybe a different perk can help secure more kills and or slow the game down

XBox is down period rn. None of our games are working atm.

And why bring franklins when only 2 of them start with an item. They didnt even  have medkits or toolboxes...

Misusing the report system aint cool, funny or epic, unless someone is sending harassing messages dont fuckin just spam report them
---
Bill and Ash because I like both of the series their from and Ghostface because I like his ability and cosmetics plus Harry Warden isnt in the game yet so I'm stuck with him until one faithful day he comes to DBD
---
An issue with ruin (other than the hex-based nature of it) is that it is way stronger versus worse survivors and completely stomps new players. (And great players, where you need it most, hardly notice the impact)
---
If you consistently hit great skillchecks ruin effectively gives a 0.08*80*0.02=12.8% speed debuff. (Slightly less if you can't get skillchecks in consecutive seconds, which I need to check)
---
If you consistently hit good skillchecks you lose 0.08*80*0.05=32% speed but the gen also stops gaining progress for 3 sec as if you failed a skillcheck. When solo without a toolbox this costs up to another 24% base speed (slightly less because these instances can overlap), it's even more punishing when grouped up or using toolboxes.
---
All in all, ruin has more than 4 times the effect on bad survivors, which I think needs looking at. 
---
One possible option would be removing the progress blocking on 'fail', possibly accompanied by a buff somewhere else. This would make ruin less punishing for less skillcheck-able players, especially when they stack on generators.
---
None of this will fix the volatile hex nature of the perk, but that's another issue
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD I DID THIS LATE NIGHT
---
Claudette.. not because she can self heal, although that's a bonus.. (I promise this isn't racist) but this is a dark game.. and her skin blends in very well with walls and trees -.-
---
Your reddit profile is just one big joke, just stop
---
it lol. 95% of players on this subreddit seem to disagree with you, let‚Äôs see that spicy nurse gameplay of yours, shall we?
---
Yeah, totally meant it as a solo option with no tools required, so thank you for pointing it out! I‚Äôll work on it more with some idea that have been presented here. :)
---
A new chapter, where it shows all the characters we haven‚Äôt seen but have heard of in the perks and tutorial papers, I think that would work.

---
both equally
---
Don't you love when you're dying and you're stage 1 but everyone is self healing while the killer chases the only healthy survivor far away from where you are?
---
I had a killer get salty for twerking on a pallet after hitting them. Some people take gaming too seriously, and get angry about anything under the sun.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why ppl get so mad. Only way I‚Äôd get mad is if I‚Äôm crawling on the ground and the survivor shows the killer my location
---
bruh lmfao i had an adam tbag me at a pallet he dropped for deadass 15 minutes bc i was so done w his team. i just let it happen
---
2K or 3K against teabagging toxic SWF feels amazing. I love when they actually start playing after realizing they might lose.
---
It ain't racist because it's the truth because her being black is just a natural advantage compared to others like Bill and Kate(one has white hair and one just doesn't have good stealth as she is white)
---
## bruh üôåüí™üëåüòÇüò´

I play on the PS4 and I give everyone thumbs up, it just feels like the right thing to do.  Even those who disconnected, at least they got me out of the lobby.
---
Nice!
---
I am
---
i always laugh when people compare teabagging to being toxic, it doesn't even do anything gameplay wise lmao
---
I'm talking about that hex perk- as a survivor I'd wish every killer would run it
---
Spine chill also increases actions speeds.  This means you vault slightly faster while the killer is looking at you.  Yes this does in fact stack with resilience
---
Lol I ain't gonna lie I just started playing survivor and I slick be wanting to double crouch at times
---
Lmao I had a huntress player with 2400+ hours camp camp me on first hook for insta healing my friend. Wasn‚Äôt even mad about it, was more amused and laughed at the fact somebody could be so upset over it. Some people‚Äôs kids man, yikes üòÇ..
---
Why do you say that?
---
I just patrol the same three generators and casually take swipes at survivors.  Unless I'm near the basement, then I want that sweet basement trophy, but once I get that, I'll go back to being super casual.  I do my killer dailies and almost none of them actually require hooking (thankfully!) so I get what I came for.
---
Not a bad call tbh
---
How is looping bad, isn't the objective to lose the killer? I'm not just going to run in a straight line.
---
Just had a game where 3 of my t eammates died in the basement. I unhooked two of them, did a generator by myself, killed his hex totem, looped the killer, and I actually LOST a pip this game. LOL. Something seems way wrong.
---
Feng Min because when I started playing this game I thought Technician was really strong against all the Doctor's and Freddy's in the low ranks. Also I preferred Lithe over the other exhaustion perks because I felt like I could control it better. Plus, back before the cosmetics store, nobody played her on PS4.
---
Lisa because she was the first killer I mastered back before her buff when she was considered one of the weakest. I really liked her strategical gameplay and her traps were the only thing in the game that actually scared me.

It's almost impossible to get iridescent gatekeeper unless the survivors make a lot of mistakes and expose themselves to you. Having Ruin makes little difference in that regard.

Leatherface is half price atm too (Europe psn store atleast), and although he‚Äôs not the best killer, he‚Äôs one of the most fun, and it‚Äôs still very possible to get high ranks with him.
---
Oh boy.. that‚Äôs to far
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be rude but does anyone even read the in game descriptions anymore? Calm Spirit, which is Jakes own perk, stops Survivors screaming when getting hit, hooked or when affected by a Killers power/perk that would make them scream. It even says it in the perk description.

Haven't a clue, killer justified tunneling me because I pallet then squatted the other side and went off to genie.

I had a survivor get salty that I safely rescue them twice but they were awful with evade or loop tricks. Another and I were the only two that escaped and salty survivor sent me a message that I was horrible teammate
---
I don't even derank and I get that matchmaking is borked
---
Damn I feel bad for those people imagine??
---
NOED is No one escapes death. One hit knockdowns and speed for the killer after all gens are done. It's a hex totem. To throw a pebble you have to let it charge by being in the killers terror radius. Then stop moving and hit the action button.
---
100%
---
These are both perks.
---
N.O.E.D is an acronym for [Hex: No One Escapes Death](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death). Once the exit gates are powered, if there is a dull totem remaining on the map, NOED is applied to it and the totem becomes a hex totem. While active, Survivors have the Exposed status effect, meaning they can be downed in 1 hit. (the Killer's momevemet speed is also increased).
---
[Diversion](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Diversion) is a perk unique to Adam Francis. While not in a chase for 45 seconds, within the killer's terror radius, and while crouched and motionless, you can throw a pebble to create a noise notification for the killer.
---
You don't have to hold the gen for the full duration to get the value. You get 15% progress over 5 seconds, plus an additional 5% per skill check hit (for an extra 10%, or 25% total.) After the 5 seconds you can let go of the gen and the progress will still be there. If you hit both the skill checks you'll have spent 5 seconds to do what usually takes 20, effectively being 4 times faster for that bit.
---
NOED: No One Escapes Death, it's a controversial perk that lets the killer one hit you. To deactivate it, you have to find the totem of that perk and cleanse it.  
---
In order to throw pebbles in the game you need the perk "Diversion", if you have it, a simple M2 will do.
---
I don't think that the huntress was upset with you more of the fact that you had to go because you were helping your team. That's a good strategy to get rid of the strongest link
---
Oh good I thought I fucked up my game somehow lol
---
If you know they are going to try it I usually walk backward a little before I swing. That seems to work. Also don't lunge. Use the fast hit.
---
*shrugs*
---
Michael and monitor and nurses calling.
---
Is it? I've not had any problems.
---
My personal build is huntresses Lullaby, corrupt intervention (don't have ruin yet), brutal strength, and rancor (my poor man's bbq)
---
I like the hatch how it is but keys are dumb. Being able to just abruptly skip the last third of the game just lets SWFs bully and dip out once the killer gets any sort of pressure up. If I could only change one thing in this game it would be so a key only let one person through
---
Even less if they cleansed some totems beforehand. If you cleanse 3 of them, it's a 50/50 shot.
---
So this is what those teammates are doing when I'm hooked.
---
I did that to a guy once, he dced once i started taking him to the basement
---
Had something similar happen to me yesterday, and the killer DCed as soon as it broke.
---
Clamps aren't that bad. It can make hitting Greats easier to help deal with Ruin, and against Huntress' Lullaby the bigger skill checks can be easier to hit. They also do make sabotage skill checks bigger, speaking from experience.
---
With that being said they are the least useful "generalist" addons. I'd much rather have Socket Swivels to actually do the gen at a decent speed, or some Wire to make my toolbox last a little longer. I still consider Hacksaws and Cutting Wires far more "useless" (since who the fuck sabos in current year?) and only take clamps and grip wrenches on brown toolboxes when I don't care about losing them.
---
Any addon helps, but these ones really don't help much.
---
Lol don‚Äôt gatekeep me bud.
---
Also applicable. Well played.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/ GT_Legend2
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
gt_legend2 has not said the N-word yet.
---
I know right? God forbid the devs try to experiment with any kind of bold or creative design decisions!
---
Lets just play the same choreographed gameplay repeatedly for another 4k hours because killer players are so fucking terrifed that survivors doing anything other then running in a straight line is OP. 
---
For real tho, your post makes absolutely no sense and i have no idea what you're actually trying to say. I just assumed its "hurr durr survivor bad killer good".
---
how about no?
---
Self care lets you top yourself off when the killer interrupts you mid heal. If you heal right after getting unhooked you don't have to commit to the heal if you have self care, you can just disperse and finish it yourself. You should almost never fully self care yourself back up unless it's a pig, ghostface or wraith and you can get surprise downed by leaving yourself injured.

Why do people think its long i have gotten in gane in 1 or 2 mins 7 times in a row and my internet sucks and im sad because then theres not enough time to wathc reddit
---
NOED is No one escapes death. It is a general killer perk, meaning all killers can learn it. What it does is at the end of the game if there is still a dull totem it will become hex totem giving all survivors the exposed status and allowing the killer to down them in one hit until the hex is cleansed.
---
Pebbles are for a unique perk for Adam. You have to spend a certain amount of time in the killer's terror radius to use it. Then it is just a secondary action
---
I'm relaxed while I play Trapper...but everybody else makes lean in.

Take my damn upvote

#Who would win?
---
A cop, a professional rugby player, a star runner and basketball player who won a scholarship for athletic prowess, and someone who spent most of their adult life killing demons with a chainsaw
---
**OR**
---
One 16 year old girl with pink hair who can *r u n n f a s s t* and poke people with a broken ruler
---
when you hit both of them and then your generator gets hit by pop goes the weasel ):
---
&gt;only 2 have dealt with insane stuff
---
Ash Williams would like to know your location
---
If you have more than one of the same add on, and you just finished a game, will the add ons in your inventory automatically fill the add on slot?
---
Sweaty is synonymous with tryhard. ie, you are trying so hard to win that you're working up a sweat.
---
Thank yo thank you
---
4 shirtless davids vs susie
---
its so good
---
But then you lose any future sped up progression by foregoing another addon. 
---
And heavens forbid if a killer has Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Does Ghost Face‚Äôs Drop-leg Knife Sheath (the one that considerably increase crouch movement speed) make him move faster than base movement speed?
---
Weird... if you had two safe unhooks, a chase, a hex totem and a gen, you really should not have lost a pip. Something is wrong indeed.
---
Decisive strike? Never happening? One of the most common perks to see at high ranks? Countering that by itself makes Moris the best offering by far. Flashlight saves and sabotage are rare, but you can't deny it's one of many reasons moris are so powerful. 
---
It is absolutely fair to call someone using Moris a bad player. Anyone that knows how to exploit it can end the game extremely quickly. No other offering has as much of an impact as an early mori does.
---
If you want to show some kindness to the killer, its a good idea to rapidly crouch after you pallet stun them. Its like saying, "I appreciate you killer. Thank you for the friendly match." You can also do this at the edge of the exit gate, as a sort of friendly goodbye.
---
Look at their Twitter.
---
Other games working fine
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Right?! I feel like I‚Äôm constantly on the go, no matter which killer I‚Äôm playing as. Patrol the gens, smack and hook survivors, (re)set traps, mindgame loopers, etc. on top of all the individual tasks that come with each killer power.
---
Just needs more blood
---
Nah
---
Ive tried using the fast hit and i see them but it still doesnt always connect, havent tried movin backwards tho :)
---
Just because it was fast for you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fast for everyone else. For a lot of people, it takes a long time to find a match as killer
---
It‚Äôs bang bang entity has no brain now cuz it got shot in the head
