Anyone else have this glitch happen on ps4? It makes sprinting impossible. Hi devs how are ya
---
---
---
WHAT DID THE HERO OF TIME EVER DO TO YOU?
---
I’m laughing so hard
---
Why read when you can say “broken logic”  
---

---
I said that if you want to make a smart choice around perk design, you don’t implement both of these changes.
---
Survivors:
---
Teabagging or pointing at Killer on other side of pallet, at Hatch, or at exits
---
Spamming Noise Notifications (FUCK THIS) 
---
Waiting at the hatch to jump in last moment 
---
Intentionally Sandbagging Teammates 
---
Basically anything that involves taunting the killer or rubbing in the fact that they didn't manage to get you. 
---
Killer: 
---
Wasting a Survivor's time by letting them *almost* bleed out before hooking them
---
Hitting hooked Survivors more than twice unless they're the final sacrifice 
---
Both sides:
---
**Verbal Abuse or Harassment of ANY kind postgame.**
---
honestly it needs to be base kit, we need to drop this whole design philosophy in regards to fixing killers with their addons and perks instead of fixing the base kits. Honestly Behaviour has this big problem with make a problem, 'sell' the solution.
---
All it does is drive new players away from killer because, 'oh this killer is fun once you grind 500 000 bloodpoint into it, but you gotta slog through that first since the base kit is trash'.
---
I died when I seen this
---
With the update it will open for the last survivor regardless of the amount of generators completed
---
Most killer mains should stop complaining about how if something goes wrong it's a SWF and unfair match
---
Most survivor mains should stop complaining about if a killer plays a killer he doesnt like or perks that he finds OP that the killer is trash at the game
---
(Facepalm)
---
Lol I like that. It's petty
---
Agreed.
---
Wut how is it cringe, it’s relatable
---
My computer sucks ass and this game is poorly optimized so I also use low. Looks like a fucking atari game but at least I get decent FPS.
---
Aw yes, the chainsaw revving. rurururururururururururururu.
---
Sooo Annoying. Thanks devs for the amazing game. Lol
---
They just barely tap the LT (or whatever button your respective platform is on) and it’s an infinite ruru
---
They're just contrarian and looking for attention
---
Should I be reminded of the L4D campaign here?
---
That and it's basically killer's way of T bagging.
---
Entity wants Daddy Ace to shake that butt.
---
Im a hag main so the altruistic teams are ez for me, they use to die all together in the basement and calling me camper for using my power u know
---
Low-key "Bring back legacy" thread?
---
And I repeat, you claim you don’t need to tunnel survivors but also want the ability to do so.
---
i was sucking hard yesterday in the institute and a billy let me pop my last gens, open an exit door, let 2 others escape, and let me farm with some pallets before leading me to a hatch T_T
---
They're in some of the houses. More on Haddonfield, though, I think
---
No. I want a balanced perk. 
---
I went through your comment section and found out you’re an absolute weirdo. So since you don’t seem to understand what d strike is, I’m gonna leave this conversation now. 
---
Have a good day, boss.
---
Spirit fury without enduring is ehh. 
---
Whispers is the only clear answer.
---
If you went through my comments, you’ll find I’ve got a knack for calling people on their bullshit. 
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Little harsh, but we've all been there.
---
I do this mostly after sniping someone across the map. Yes it's bm, but I'm going to celebrate getting you. Sometimes I chainsaw rev as a nice thing. When a survivor is good I'll abandon the chase and give a little rururu as I leave.
---
Had that. Its stupid and ruins the whole game
---
I play on max settings and I sometimes have trouble tracking. I think it depends on the person as opposed to the graphics.
---
They don’t need to punish the DCer, just reward the people who didn’t DC. If someone DCs, complete a generator or give a boost to action speeds or something. And specifically more important that a survivor DCing, stop punishing survivors when the killer DCs. It’s ridiculous that I waste my offering and depip because the killers a bitch.
---
"I'm in charge!"....yea yea of course you are!
---
&gt;"I am inevitable"
---
\-Herman, probably
---
Ok thanks
---
I'm not sure why you would describe Freddy as having a good endgame, yeah his perks are made for it but anyone can use them. In fact Freddy has one of the worst endgames, because he can't do a damn thing about not in the dream world unhooking, and it takes a minimum of 7 seconds for him to start swatting someone away if they're healing a slug so he can pick them up.
---
BRB
---
[removed]
---
Cheater?
---
&gt; I'm a killer main
---
(X) Doubt
---
then they say I am not camping I am just placing traps lol
---
I wasn't really asking about how to farm during a match, just a build/playstyle that maximises BP gain while playing normally
---
That's not what I meant at all lol. What I did mean is that if you are having to facecamp your first kill with doors open, you didn't do very well that match. But sure, "it's my kill toxic survivor mains blah blah blah"
---
But the nurse doesn't need a Mori.

Get rid of shimmer is a good one.
---
As a modified version of random survivors falling asleep maybe they just have to pass a skill check periodically to stay awake. And make them more frequent as match continues--i.e. you are getting more tired. Maybe not insta-sleep but if you fail the skill check two or three times now you are asleep. Would give survivors something to do against Freddy as well as buff him.
---
I guess the biggest problem would be like getting those skill checks when you're doing something else as well.
---
How do you report bugs? Just now in a game I was self-healing with a medkit and had to stop mid heal because the killer came close to me. After they left I went to continue healing and I started the self-heal animation but neither the progress bar was rising nor was the durability of my medkit dropping. I even got a perfect skill check during this and nothing happened progress wise.
---
NOED is easily countered if you just have a small amount of braincells active while playing. It's the survivors own fault if it gets to activate before the last gen gets popped (survivor main)
---
Agreed!
---
Food of the gods 2
---
But doc isn't even the best at spooking :( M&amp;A Myers takes that cake. You don't even know an M&amp;A Tier 1 Myers is there until he cuts you.
---
I don't think you need to tell someone that only got one kill that they didn't do well.
---
*sigh* 
---
I DO mainly play killer, but that's beside the point by now. You're currently the least hostil person in this thread, so I'll try and have an actual discussion on it with you. 
---
Personally, I don't like using TotT unless I'm doing a totem build, which I find underwhelming anyway. The point I'm making is that IF it goes off, which it tends to do when you solo queue like I do when you play survivor, it can ruin the end game balance. The speed boost plus the insta-down is kinda nutty. It shuts down a lot of loops and makes hook saves require more people to be successful. I don't really use NOED because I tend to do well without it, but as survivor it just feels like I'm being overpowered instead of outplayed. Outplayed I'd be fine with. Getting one hit by billies chainsaw is totally ok with me bc it's actually a lot more difficult to land consistently than people think. But with NOED it just feels...I dunno, cheesy? Not really the word I'm looking for, but it takes away from the satisfaction of the game.
---
A man can try
---
Lmfaooooo the moonwalk to 360 was glorious.
---
Exert from the chat of the game against a Hag with max teleport range traps who was running Devour Hope and Make Your Choice who camped the shit out of everyone she hooked:
---
&gt;Me: Hey I think Bass and Pro has a sale on camping equipment.
---
&gt;Me: Just throught you'd like to know.
---
&gt;Me: You seem to be the outdoorsy type.
---
&gt;Hag: f[slur] yooooooooooou f[slur] c[slur] n[slur]
---
&gt;Hag: I don't give a s[sluuuuuuuuuuuuur] you g[slur] c[slur]
---
&gt;Hag: You can go shove your head right up you a[slur] you n[slur] I bet you don't even play Killer
---
&gt;Hag: I give absolutely zero f[slur]s about your g[slur]-a[slur] poor man complaints
---
&gt;Me: You also give absolutely zero pips or Bloodpoints
---
&gt;Me: Because camping ain't worth shit
---
Not particularly strong
---
Your really gonna say that to one of the strongest killers in game second only to Nurse?
---
Plus, allows the killer to trigger BBQ etc
---
Which I get, but when you can't communicate with your team and everyone's trying to clense totems, I've found it's easy to overestimate how many totems your team has taken care if. Especially if the killer is doing a really good job confusing and juggling the survivors. I'm not saying stopping it from going off is hard, I'm saying the fact that it's this broken makes people clense every totem every game without knowing they have NOED, simply because it'll end every survivor left in the game if the gens get done.
---
"It's called soft patrolling, honey. Look it up."
---
That's true I love me some mirror matches but I like the asthetic n vibe of the doc.
---
It takes sixty seconds to complete a generator. It takes about twelve seconds to search a jigsaw box. It takes twenty seconds to open a door. Those scales are quite different. 
---
I sincerely hope they didn’t just nerf Legion due to DCs. That would be just viciously incompetent.
---
They did, among a few other minor tweaks
---
I  mostly agree with you. I haven't played both sides equally and have only played for 6 months. I am a survivor main. I am usually a super nice person irl but this game was making me toxic. It was really a combo of the killers and survivors. I started playing with a group early on that taught me bad habits.  I started sending salty af messages and dcing a lot. I realized just how shitty of a person I was being in this community (really my hubby said I was being an Asshole) and changed my ways. Anytime I run in to a good Killer or even one that struggles and they don't camp or tunnel i send them a gg and thank them for a good match.  I try to spread the positivity in hopes it will catch on.
---
I agree with the last one a lot. Like some of the stuff you see it and you're like "meeeh, whatever" but if its post game and I give a GG, and the other peeps are like "wow you suck, just uninstall" or "gg ez baby killer" its way worse than any of the other stuff.
---
A shitpost it is lol.
---
You should always go for the perks first.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Other than that its not really important, if you are new I would go for bloodpoints offerings, so you can get progres faster.
---
If you kill like 500 of the same survivor you get their mask, so EG you kill 500 claudette you get their face mask(Since in the movies his thing is making masks out of his victims)

Anyone else find it interesting that there's a campfire right outside the trial? The lore always makes it seem like it's buried in the woods and the fog, and then it's just right there, so close that the trial isn't even hidden in the fog.

Pretty sure that’s lag.

Or from self-care, or from medkits.

I mean, you're on Xbox so..............

1. Huntress is slow for a reason, she doesnt need a buff

2. Agreed

3. I would prefer reload speed

4. The devs almost did this fun fact, but they decided against it thank god

5. Let's just make the hitboxes line up with teh animation

6. No

8. Double nope

Trapper just needs to hold two baseline and be able to rea rm them them on the ground

1.Why?

2. Its back to broken, fuck that

3. So it gives deep wounds and still ignores the 3rd hit?

4. Seems uncesseary

1. Calm down there satan

Thank you, someone who actually understood what I wrote. I dunno, I've just seen a lot of games I've played for long periods of time die out because if poor balancing, so I guess I'm getting a little jaded. I started playing DBD right before clowns release, and back then I was also really into For Honor, which I left for the same poor balance issues. Ilots of things that make the game a lot less skill oriented for one side or the other. Mettle giving you essentially an extra life, and NOED taking the end game for you. And the downvotes don't bother me lmao, some nerd online telling me I'm wrong has the same impact as someone threatening me over a text. I'm pretty new to Reddit and I don't really even know how karma works so I've just ignored it so far.
---
Talk about lucky! It's scary how things could have been different just from one totem.
---
Keyboard didnt work correctly
---
You know what i mean. I have to play on pc too, i mean no one shows us love there.
---
If you're running a totem build and theres only 1 dull players are definitely going to cleanse the dull because the majority of the time that means you have NOED. You barely feel the speed boost as killer and you can't tell if killer has the speed boost as survivor, so the speed boost isn't that big compared to adrenaline. NOED is meant to be a last resort during end game and/or to counter gen rushing just as ruin is a way to keep gens from being completed so fast. Hook saves during end of the game already require all 3 to get it off. If one player leaves or is dead and the hooked isn't right  at the gate or a player doesnt have BT,  someones definitely going to die getting to the gate trying to body block for the injured player
---
I agree NOED is a little overpowered if you’re a solo player like I am, just because my teammates can’t necessarily communicate with me about totems and stuff. I try to cleanse them when I see them but I obviously can’t get all of them myself so I just kinda hope my team gets the rest. It’s not that big of a deal though, usually I can tell how competent my team is right from the start so if I know they suck I just kinda scout for totems while they do gens.
---
It looks like she was trying to jump into the tv, i'm gonna assume drugs were involved here
---
how are you aware of r/SubsIFellFor but not r/instantkarma
---
I just noticed it’s TikTok and I need no further explanation.
---
For me it's the "Shazam!" part with Green Lantern trying to use all his willpower to stop Black Adam
---
If he cant talk (Ash doesn't talk, he just says annoying voicelines) I think iy would hurt him
---
I’m sure if he was implemented he’d talk
---
I don't understand the downvotes here, though I do need to point out that I've never had issues getting games on console
---
Who do you think was the male actor in the VHS Porn add-on? Ron Jeremy?
---
Maybe a random perk combo? I do those sometimes too and you often get ones that don't synergize well.
---
Michael : Yeah, sure buddy. Whatever helps you die at night.
---
I tend to clense the ones I see if I'm not doing anything else, but I don't go hunting for them unless I have to. I just hope that my team does the same, which they don't always do.
---
NO
---
Tunnel your least favorite students
---
It's the way matchmaking works. if you solo queue it'll stick you wherever you fit, often with other randoms. if you play killer the game has to fill 4 slots at the same time which means you're gonna get a lot of 4 man swf teams who tend to be more coordinated than randoms.
---
&gt;I’m cool with this. Do you know how many survivors dc on third hook to deprive me of my kills.
---
wtf this is so backwards.
---
everyone knows you dc before your first hook to deny potential BBQ stacks smh...
---
No, this is different, this wasn't in the files when the trapple, ruler, and detention were discovered.
---
All is takes is the add on that removes the phasing sound for her power.
---
Maybe that’s what they are running to when the survivors escape
---
Keep going.
---
That's what I said in the title, so I'm thinking they may be reusing the concept of a school
---
I ..said it's an offering...it just wasn't in the files back when the teachers perk and powers werw
---
I do it because I think most people fund it funny.
---
It's in the offerings menu though, the tutorial illustrations have their own ui folder
---
You mean the hatch bit doesn't happen on Xbox either? For me it's just a joke about the Xbox being bad. Kinda like the apple vs droid schtick. I don't take it seriously.
---
I’d go against Billy over a Legion 10:10 times
---
Yeah, but the score screen show's them sprinting through fog and corn. So if it's right there why do they keep running? I'm obviously over analyzing it but I wonder if it could be explained by the lore
---
*JARL
---
Thats true. I like the change even more now
---
The Pig "nerf" only puniches Pig players who can't properly defend generators. While I do think it's shitty that RBT's do nothing once the Exit Gates are powered, it doesn't change how I play Pig since once the Exit Gates are powered *(If it corms to that at all.)* I never have any RBT's left anyways.
---
It’s not I know when it’s lag like I posted earlier he admits he was cheating. I have the screenshots but don’t know how to add them to an existing post. Kinda new to reddit
---
Nah killers arent big on it.
---
I think that would make for a good add-on. Probably not a part of his base power though .
---
Kind of unrelated but how can you tell if the myers has tombstone in tier 3? Their hand will be open or closed?
---
Playing Legion
---
I wouldn’t do that, but I’ve been saying that completing generators should award everyone blood points. Especially now that the hatch isn’t tied to generator progress. Let’s say 1500 survival points for the first three generators and another 1500 for the last two. Behavior would probably want to reduce the escape award to 3000 but you would still be getting out ahead, and personally I wouldn’t balk at giving survivors max survival points for a successful escape. 
---
You’re right that people with quitter mentality would just shift to loser mentality. However, people with loser mentality still try to maximize their points while giving as little effort as possible.
---
Only rank 20's say stuff like this.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
10/10 &lt;3
---
thanks for ur opinions!
---
Yeah, I just wanted to have a funny bruh moment
---
Thank you :)
---
I mean...you could just cleanse dull totems. It slows the game down a bit, which if you don't have Ruin is *desperately* needed, and it's something you (collectively) can take care of yourselves.
---
You say the perk needs to get changed because the survivors want to just rush generators, but I feel like it would be better if the community behavior shifted. If you hate NOED, cleanse totems. Game lasts long enough for people to enjoy it and nobody gets hooked through adrenaline. If you don't have a problem avoiding hits then gen rush like normal and prove you're really that good.
---
I think it's not that NOED is problematic, it's the community behavior that's a problem.
---
Weird way to spell Freddy
---
NP, I like some of what you said while some others I disagree with
---
I think if they just made it longer to die from the hook if ur too close it would help
---
"The stun hurts him"
---
It would get as boring as Ash if he just said the same things over and over again
---
We’ve all been there
---
Pretty average save tbh
---
Quality
---
I mean, why would you though? Assuming all players are similarly skilled, you are just slowing your own progress down.  
---
  
---
This might be different depending on the killer, since some can find survivors more easily than others.
---
She was on like, 1/10th of a second for her bleedout timer, which meant she bleed out when you downed her.
---
I mean would you rather get looped for 5 gens or go after someone else whats the more logic sense here . Like you won’t know whos skilled or not because you are continuing to chase one person. In my
---
Opinion that’s not smart i play killer and survivor equally 🤷🏼‍♀️.
---
I like the idea, or maybe just pick up his traps faster or even replenish them in locker.
---
The world is a strange place.
---
Against a good Spirit that's using any add ons there isn't much you can do in a chase.
---
Prayer beads and lunge/cooldown add ons are pretty annoying.
---
Stand still "mindgame" isn't really a mindgame for how much in her favour it is.
---
Passive phasing/her not having a vaulting animation shouldn't be a thing.
---
Let's start with him not being hindered by his own power. It's a pointless mechanic and should be removed from the game.
---
Holy shit that's cool
---
You'd need to add them to a comment, as you can't edit subbmitted videos
---
11/10 &lt;333
---
I mean, you also don't know, maybe the next person you chase will be equally skilled or better. Are you going to give up all chases midway? Then the game is over and you didn't even catch one person.  
---
That's also assuming you don't have a bunch of immersed claudettes with their cloak engaged, then you will have trouble finding your next chase.
---
thats okay
---
that was exacly what i said on one post that i made today and everyone was yelling at me that it would be OP
---
I mean then get looped the whole game and never know about the others and cry about it later like idk what you want me to tell you. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Killers:
---
Camping at the start or mid match
---
Hitting hooked survivors
---
T-bagging after every pallet and at the exit gate
---
Clicking flashlight at the killer over and over again
---
Staying at the exit gate all together just to t-bag the killer and click their flashlights when they can just leave.
---
I'll be honest, I hate it when that happens. Either that or you get the chainsaw hit animation but it doesn't connect.
---
ew instagram stuff
---
But it’s worth insta stuff
---
Commenting for no reason
---
That's actually a solid strategy. Who are you to think that killers have to follow *your* rules?
---
Fair enough
---
Damn. Like I get it, more BP and greater pips but it just seems like a fun/nice thing to do.
---
And the rest were reasonably pissed off.
---
It’s always the females survivors too, David and Dwight’s are the true nightmares
---
25 times not 500 lol
---
Yup. "I just wanted to love you!"
---
Less than 3
---
The Pig’s traps aren’t about “endgame kills.” It’s about providing clutch potential to a Killer who has no endgame pressure. The Pig has nothing that helps her in a chase or provides her with mobility. Even at endgame the traps are meant to jump buy more time. Without those traps there is very little she can actually do to stop survivors from escaping. They are taking away an advantage from a Killer and creating an advantage for survivors because of it. This isn’t balance: they are deliberately pushing down one side of the scale. There are better solutions and they are simply too lazy to implement them.
---
Pjsalt?
---
If it’s a Claudette, all I can think is “Congratulations, you played yourself.”
---
There is alot of thing to look into
---
1. PTB
---
2. Iridescent hatchets
---
3. 3 survs died not to a hook(different skull image), and there is no more, so they all bled out.
---
4. You are waiting to see surv die to the entity, but then Huntress downs a surv, and he dies, and ENTITY IS DISPLEASED means (spoiler) probably 0 hooks for entire game(yes).
---
Just enjoy the culmination of the toxic/autistic game brought to you by the killer
---
At the start of the games lifetime I'd say yes, but now with the ammount of perks we have we should only have one base perk that grants the ultimate desired ability.
---
Except literally the reason people play.
---
Nobody cares about progression after the 4th perk slot. Progresdion systems only allow more experienced players stomp noobs harder.
---
On twitch TV it’s an emote you can type into chat to make a salt shaker
---
Removed for salty after game salt
---
When can we start punishing killers for dodging matches with average ping?
---
Never said they did bud. And it is a solid strategy, just like face camping.
---
F
---
M O R A L L Y G R E Y btw
---
I see a lot of Ruin, but if you want to run a HEX perk, I recommend Devour Hope, you can usually et a mori or two per game and it alows down gens a lot once survivors find out you have it because you smacked one down
---
Finally I would get bloodpoints for all this hang time.
---
Maybe for the a e s t h e t i c
---
Perks first, as stated already.  Then blood point offerings.  The pretty colored add-ons are nice, but cost more.. once you hit ten and the slots are slowly eaten away, I typically choose the cheaper slots if I'm just trying to level as quickly as possible.
---
I have said that on literally every post for punishing dcers. The only good idea I have seen is rewarding people for staying in games. If they come for the dcers the next big complaint will be people suiciding on hook which as of right now is a fair in game mechanic that anyone can use even if it fucks over other survivors.
---
I mean I did make a ticket to them I just wanted to share it with others.
---
Never prestige, also go for the higher tier perks 1st to get them out of the way
---
Okay
---
They should be slower, and they’ll be stalking for a long, long time
---
It’s the game. It happens all of the time to my friends. But they’re still in the party chat.  And when it kicks them it shows the killers perks and stuff.
---
I’ve had the wiggle but not repair on PS4 really annoying
---
Ok good talk.
---
My god.
---
For one other survivors should be mildly compensated for DCs just like the killer is. I think a big reason multiple DCs happen is simply because who wants to play a 3v1 or even a 2v1 with 5 gens up and literally no hope of winning outside of pity from the killer?
---
On a sort of related note, it makes no sense to me that quitter bonus rewards Brutality for the killer, it makes more sense to give those points in the Sacrifice category.
---
While constant DCing should be punished, survivors should still feel like they have a chance after 1 or 2 of their teammates decides to just ragequit. I personally think Gens should get autocompleted to # of survivors alive/dead/escaped +1. i.e. make it to how it would've started with just those survivors. Like say you have 5 gens left and 2 DC, then 2 gens(I will say those that are closest to already being complete) will be completed and the other 2 will then need to do 3 gens, and so on just so it doesn't feel AS hopeless. Maybe even give the survivors a quitter bonus too should they make it to the end of the match, not even as much as the killer's 625, but like 500 survival points would be nice.
---
Survivor rewards are already pitiful compared to even a mediocre killer's rewards, incentivizing them and rewarding them in more ways can always help curb constant DCing.
---
i only act like an asshole after a survivor does the same. If someone intentionally is annoying and does things like t bag at a pallet then i will tunnel them with no remorse. Same on survivor. If the killer plays in an annoying way such as tunneling or camping then ill genrush my heart out.
---
There will be no knifing each other, everyone knows who is in charge...

He's got stealth on his side for one thing. The main things he has going for him are that, the instadown (which is not that labor intensive, is ridiculously easy to hit given an extended lunge, and can be activated on a whim), and the fact that he has some of the best and most varied add-ons of any killer, without a single bad one except Vanity Mirror. 
---
TLDR: Varied Playstyle, massive perk flexibility, an instadown, Stealth, and good add-ons. A-Tier Killer for sure.
---
He has to wait a few seconds before he does it again and you can juke him
---
I'm grown and I'm not triggered by survivors spamming the crouch button...
---
So, what nerf to Pig?
---
Looks like he didn’t understand you
---
And more than half are garbage.. you argument is not valid here..
---
One makes a match not happen, the other makes the match happen and then ruins it. Hence why no one cares about survivors dodging, either.
---
What does that do for anyone?
---
Thing of beauty right here.
---
&gt; I think incentives for actually ranking up and maintaining your rank are necessary.
---
I don't want this at all, because BHVR is clearly not going to attempt to balance the game to make this more palatable. Moris and instaheals every single game.
---
I mean shit I know I've been getting bad matches but my last 5 games I've depipped from people noy working together. The best is when they unhook someone right next to me heing carried by the killer on my third hook. That really took the cake. Lets try our hand back down at rank 15
---
Quite possibly, but find a gf is a new insult for me and instantly reminded me of runescape "buying gf"
---
Never came back for me.
---
Oh Idont have an issue with the saw, its instarev that can make that idea  useless
---
Do survivors still keep items when they dc?
---
Good talk
---
Choose bloodhound over insidious...
---
yeah im *pretty* sure she just wanted you to keep healing her. i dont think she didn't intentionally blocked you from the killer lol
---
I don't blame them for assuming you were trying to be an ass, though. People rarely send messages to say nice things.
---
ohhh sorry
---
Honestly the only thing I think he needs to be that much stronger is for Logwood Dye to be baseline.
---
The big problem with Trapper isn't setting up, it's having his traps disabled. Making them darker (and harder to spot) default would make it where Survivors have to actually pay attention where they are walking instead of looking for the bright white traps just sitting around.
---
You were playing with one hand behind your back get ready to dominate
---
It's called a joke, bud. Look em up, they're pretty fun.
---
Michael Myers from the horror franchise Halloween

welp, always there is an excepcion, but i dont know why u must laught at someone doing extreme parkour
---
Endgame spoilers
---
Those killer mains are desperate for the 4k.. it's rather sad... I don't slug or hatch stand off. 3k is good enough.. 
---
But if you're having that much bad luck with sluggers throw on unbreakable...
---
This is one of the first places I check for a totem on that map.
---
Big oof. Survivors and killers agreeing that this was fucking stupid made him delete his account.
---
Maybe another deleted account will be able to undelete this one.
---
funny.
---
Lately I;ve been seeing a lot of male survivors DC. Particularly Davids
---
Never seen this bug before
---
THEN PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD!
---
NOED has a counter, MoM doesn't. Check mate.
---
source
---
I try to play as fair as possible until the surivior(s) gives me a reason not to.
---
?
---
Not to mention they put thicker mist offerings in KILLER bloodwebs, how useless. It only benefits Pig and maybe Wraith.
---
I had a random teammate message me today about how I was “fucking stupid” for running no mither lol! We went against the plague and I was already broken and she pukes on me. I went around banging gens out while puking the whole time lol and never hit a cleanse pool, 2 of us walked out of there because of me. On PS4
---
People who camp are dumb... especially with the hag... hag players are such campers and tunnelers.  Its pathetic. It's a waste of her power.
---
"Only punishes Amanda mains who can't properly defend generators" 
---
Yea.. the pig is awful at downing people. You can't tell me the survivors have no chance at repairing generators against her, she travels the map as slow as every other m1 killer and has no ranged abilities. Honestly they have to be really shitty survivors to not be able to power all the gens at a normal basis. Every now and then I'll have a trap left when the last generator is powered and there is nothing I could really do about it, and that's just what happens when you're playing in an unfavored map, against enough really smart survivors, or against an actual good set. When I down people trying to escape I want to be able to put a trap on their head so I can ignore them and go after the other altruistic players trying to help him. People complaining that the pig can just put the mask on them and tunnel them to death making their chance of survival are honestly idiots, because the alternative to making a survivor 100% dead is called facecamping so who cares??? If the player wants to use a scummy tactic to kill them then it already exists, so what's the big deal?
---
That actually seems like a ping issue, it took you forever to start the vault animation.
---
Oh yeah
---
First perk spot is noed I can do is laugh.. must of been a bad nurse .
---
Yeah, you’ll get t-baggers all the time. You got them back, though, by downing every other one. They just salty cause they got caught. GG.
---
When you got hit "I must be dreaming" 🤣
---
but this "pointless mechanic" can easily end chases and get free hooks if you're good at planning pre-chase
---
It's not really.  I do it after a good mind game play to hype myself up. Not like I've got anything better to do in the blade wipe animation.
---
Dead by daylight meme
---
Add pop goes the weasel to gens.. that perk makes me real upset when I'm playing survivor.
---
Looked fair to me
---
Minus noed.. that perk is crutch and not good for people who are trying to learn and get good.
---
Think if was worried about the 2 killer bug getting hom banned
---
i mean the real problem would be when people actually get disconnected from games because of bad connection
---
As long as Adrenaline is in the game, NOED is A-OK. No discussion needed.
---
You must either not have been playing for long or only play at the lower ranks, because even in green ranks, my totem almost never lasts longer than 1 chase / hook event, if that. Unless it spawns in one of the few "good" locations. 
---
And 7/10 times, the kills I get from it are on people who should have just left the game ASAP once generators are finished. 
---
To speak your language, they don't "deserve" to escape.
---
why are all of your comments getting downvote bombed
---
Oh man! Thanks for pointing that out!
---
I have honestly no idea why people make posts like this. What is your intention? 
---
You talk about toxicity breeding toxicity while reigniting this dumb argument over who's more toxic which will probably never end. 
---
The truly toxic players don't care if you call them out in a post like this while the majority of players need to think about whether them using a tactic to win could be considered toxic in the arbitrary and everchanging ruleset presented by the community. 
---
Generalizing a huge group just to share your honestly completely subjective opinion of who's more toxic in an attempt to gain what? Internet points? Your reddit street cred?
---
Look, just because your humor is as dry as an English muffin doesn't mean the rest of us don't enjoy humor.
---
As survivor, If there more than one Meg, I dodge the lobby

Tunnellers complaining about borrowed time, yikes.
---
Watching the pipe go up and down is like watching a metronome
---
Apparently. Though I think even 3000 bloodpoints is better than 0 plus -2 pips
---
Guys are the ones that farm you, P3 Claudettes and Neas will make sure you don’t die.
---
Do you even play this game anymore frank
---
I love that on the front menu, you can see her booty. Definitely most likely killer to fuck. Plague is right behind her
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Nurse’s Calling, Play With Your Food, Hex: Ruin

M&amp;A + Nurse’s is godlike on Myers because most people stop healing once they’re within terror radius.
---
Fuck you dumb bitch bet I could loop your bitchass all day
---
I had about 5 games today at rank 4 where I'd get a 4k and safety pip. So a win for me I guess.
---
One pip forward, two pips backwards.
---
I wasn't meaning that I agreed with it, just it went with what he was saying.
---
Idk which ones you’re playing with then but I don’t get those
---
As a Killer who doesn't run NOED, you're benefiting from all the ones that do. Survivors in your matches are wasting time cleansing totems, unsure if you're running it or not.
---
Moris make it harder to rank up, though. It would give less of a reason to use them
---
Never before seen on PS4
---
"Ma'am you gotta be at least this tall to ride, please get yourself off of the hook immediately"
---
Camping / soft patrolling only works if you let it. 
---
t. soft patroller
---
That being said if you’re running BBQ and no one shows up when you hook someone, there’s literally no reason to run across the map when you know everyone is nearby.
---
It's a lot more cringe to go into things you don't like and complain about them.
---
Tunneling off the hook is a survivor behavior problem.... and their problem in general. Just like you don't go around and 99% every gen, worried that you're rushing your opponent out of the match, it's really entitled of you to expect the same.
---
The ability to also cut down chases with the chainsaw also is a handy addition.
---
Rbt timer is 2:30 and egc is 3:00
---
You can literally waste all the time, remove it last second and still have 30 seconds to escape
---
Damn dude you're really going full hog on making your flair checking out.
---
I shake my head sometimes at the last survivor to try and tell them to not crawl away, since I wanna take them to hatch.
---
"Now I'm playing with power!"
---
I mean, don't you think, as I assume you're a Huntress main, that if hatchets were to act like boomerangs that could potentially fly back and smack you in the face for a stun, that would make *any sense*?
---
This has been proven to be an insignificant change.
---
Nurse: I don't get it
---
T-bagging, emote spam, and facecamping.
---
 I understand looping and shit, but when you start randomly t-bagging we have a problem
---
I will respectfully disagree but for a different reason. I'm all for having more traps at base, in fact hell yeah. But I honestly think that to have him carry all of them at the start of the match would devalue the Bags and the Iridescent Stone.
---
Those are my mains as well
---
I think I'll go ahead and mention that the idea that any killer should be hindered by his own power is also pointless. So let's pull that too.
---
Yupper allot of face camping going on tonight! I’ve been counting and I’ve played 18 games so far and 14 of them the killer camped from the beginning. The up close and personal face camp, then if you did somehow manage to get off the hook they proceeded to tunnel that person to the next hook and finish the face camp until death. On PS4 playing solo survivor and every Sunday for some reason is like this.
---
i dunno how you lived that should probably have hit you?
---
Aaaaand you got downvoted. Great job reddit.
---
Splinter Cell Myers strikes again...
---
As a killer I love when survivors teabag a mori, and not ONLY because it leaves them as an easier kill.
---
That was actually a fair hit. Your hitbox expands rather considerably if you fast vault over a pallet.
---
A guy learned how to do it mid-game and when I was hooked, he made me watch him moonwalk before he took me off.
---
It doesn't, but nor will most changes to dcing. The quitter bonus is shit though, points in brutality amount to 0 if you still hit other survivors, gens and pallets enough. Why not put them in the sacrifice category that we're now guaranteed not to cap.
---
The Trapper needs to not only set up faster, but be able to relocate more effectively. He spends so much more time running around collecting his traps than he can actually afford. He can have a decently strong defense if he can get the last three generators close to each other, but after they manage to get that last one, he doesn't have enough time to do anything with his traps before the survivors have to the gate open and are standing by the exit. I think they should do something with the Trapper similar to what they did with the Hag.
---
Agreed. Pig is also boring af  to play so couldn't care less about her nerf.
---
Youre right, moriing on second hook is fine for points usually but it isn't as big of a deal - you're dead on hook anyway, what annoys people is slapping an ebony and sweating to get everyone moried. 
---
There def needs to be something worse than "consumes the addon/medkit)" for survivors
---
Sweet. Someone's gotta do it while I'm inevitably tunneled by the Killer.
---
its true, survivors in this case are the scum of the earth, ive never seen so much toxicity in my life
---
That sucks, hope you were still able to enjoy the movie. I heard there were spoilers going around two weeks ago so I stayed off social media and only used popular subreddits. Social media is a bitch a lot of times.
---
lerrys is pretty good for some Killers. and everyone who DCs should get banned...
---
I leave like half the games I play lol, never been punished?
---
There are a lot of syntax and syllable issues with this, but I appreciate the devotion.
---
wasn't a question here if you see. i be also a high rank killer. i don't play Billy or Nurse and i don't do meta builds on my beloved killers. cause getting 4k fast is not as fun as trying out different builds, running around, thinking of strategies, mindgaming, etc. 
---
i hate how people think they have to get kills and are *forced* to use meta builds as both sides. uuuuugh. no, you're not.
---
I disagree, but I appreciate your points. Truthfully without NOED I’ve scored a 4K after 1-3 gens complete.  Sometimes no gens have been done.. probably a bad group, but when I play a SWF I am thankful for NOED. I am at a huge disadvantage. All perks aside- a SWF will trample even some of the best killers if communication is on point.  No disrespect- I appreciate your insight truly.
---
Yeah it was ok the r6 Reddit. Just a simple 5 word spoiler. And yeah half way through the movie I forgot about it. Damn fine movie. Whoever thought of this meme deserves a high five.
---
It's better than it used to be. Old NOED's counterplay was "run or die" at the end of the match. Until that totem counter comes, people need to either run small game or rush to escape instead of bitching on Reddit and clogging the posts with salty BS. I personally don't run NOED, and I'm pretty sure most other killers at my rank don't run it either. It just isn't worth a perk slot these days. Especially when you get survivors that actually break totems.
---
I'll be your mori friend
---
The scariest thing about this is the grammar.
---
I mean, there are a lot of monsters that would be great as killers from silent hill 2. I just thought of the mannequin spider, because it was one of the creepiest looking monsters I could think of. the only problem with the mannequin spider is that it wouldn't make sense on how it would pick up the survivors and put them on the hooks.
---
you can opt out. just uninstall. i’m sick of people complaining about teamwork 🙄
---
I've never put the connection between players who dont give a s*** about me and swf groups
---
Dead meme
---
this brings great insult to me how dare they disrespect my baby boy(doesn't insult me chill)
---
&gt;lerrys is pretty good for some Killers. and everyone who DCs should get banned...
---
Except closing the app before the match starts is not the same as DCing. Killers don't lose their add-ons and survivors don't lose their items. Same for ranks (if you care about that).
---
BBQ, Enduring, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin, and NOED are all great perks that have great synergies but don’t need them to be effective.
---
Blink is so damn glitchy that they can't really do anything about her pallet interactions until they iron it out. I remember when they fucked her up completely by forcing her to fatigue into a weapon wipe after every successful hit. Nurse rebalancing is going to require a very very delicate touch. Something BVHR isn't exactly capable of.
---
*"Git gud, noob"*
---
While there is no peril in the task, there can be no glory in its accomplishment.
---
Honestly in game chat should just implemented. As killer I never really see a difference, SWF is literally an option in the game so I’m confused as to why you’d want to opt out of receiving matches like that anyways. With matchmaking how it is, you’d never find games anyways. If you seriously have an issue and think it’s unbalanced, look at this game in general and realize it can never really be balanced.
---
Somehow I doubt that these dedicated servers that have taken a millennium for y'all to acquire for this community will actually have an impact on the persistent crashes every other game, lobbies hanging, and the random disconnects. This game is clearly built on some fucking noodle code and it's mind-blowing that nearly three years later it's still as awful as it ever was.
---
This looks so real.
---
I really wanna try Ps4 lol
---
U are just 5% faster then a survivor and its super easy to loop a tier 1 micheal
---
I love her but if ure going to play red ranks forget about it
---
Honestly forgot about that flair. That was a joke about a meme a while back and I never messed with it since. Guess I am a pigeon.
---
What kind of community would we be if we just told people who have an issue to “uninstall”?
---
DCing in the Loading screen crashes the game and you do lose Offerings....
---
whatcha saying? i play Fred, Spirit, Trapper, Clown, Bubba, Doctor, Pig, Plague with no meta. i play survivor with altruistic perks. with current pipping i'm a rank 2 survivor and a rank 6 killer(cause didn't play much killer(though i consider myself a killer main) after Plague chapter due to yet again fucked sounds). you absolutely don't need meta builds on high ranks. and that's such a lame kindergarten excuse "boo hoo i do that cause they do that". disgusting. get the fuck outta here, kid. of course it's slightly harder without meta but at least it's fun for both sides.
---
MFW its current year and OP still expects r/deadbydaylight to not consist entirely of degenerates.
---
As survivor
---
No looping
---
No tea bag
---
No stalling game
---
Don't care if I get tunneled or camped
---
Be as stealthy as possible
---
Only support team if they are still useful
---
Once gate is opened GTFO Asap
---
If I suspect teammate is being camped or tunneled do gens and leave teammates
---
Try to get valuable items take from dead teammate or when they drop it from fd if I need to.
---
When the departed corpse looks better than you
---
Just because it’s a feature in the game doesn’t mean it’s fair. Look at how many features have been fixed or eliminated by the developers. And it’s not just annoying for killers. I hate joining a match just to see my team is complied with three other swf. They get to talk and communicate with one another while I’m left in the dark. And even when they do invite me to join their chat, I choose to reject because I wanted to play solo along with other solo individuals. If i wanted to play with a gang I’d do swf. If it were made an option, then everyone would be happy.
---
No, you were also a victim. As part of the dedicated servers prep they can track who was doing swf with who and use that to figure out which killer was not supposed to be there. unless you intentionally invaded another killer's game then you're fine
---
I cleanse any sneaky ones I find and leave the super visible ones. That way I waste less time if they don't and can find it pretty quickly if they do
---
yep. as killer you used to have a zero ping since you're the host. therefore unless your internet or computer/console lags you were good. survivors could suffer from your side or from their side. you could get weird survivor teleportation thingie too as killer and sometimes it was in favor.
---
what i've tested was disgusting. played on different pings and anything even slightly above green is laggy af. disgusting and unplayable. as killer i've missed a shitton of hits or got hits where they shouldn't and i was 100% i swinged prematurely on very early yellow ping(it happened maybe couple times with my good pc and 300mbps internet with p2p).
---
as survivor it was disgusting too, especially Billy's and Hag's hits. insane range. game is laggier than ever.
---
Its ok...not meta anymore but nice on certain killers.
---
I see at least 2 dull totems in passing every game I play as a survivor. I'll go out on a limb and say other solo survivors see totems too as they move around the map. Yeah, I get hit by NOED when I've cleansed 3 totems myself. It sucks. Teammates not doing things is part of playing a co-op mode. The totems don't spawn randomly. 4 experienced survivors should never be hit by NOED unless they've chosen to ignore the dull totems, which is the whole point of the perk.
---
Oh ok. I have another question if you don’t mind, are they nerfing legion? I though he was one of the worst killers.
---
Sorry, forgot to mention the OTHER term of farming. So imagine this scenario: you have just been hooked and the killer is just leaving. He has moved four feet, when a survivor runs up to you and unhooks you, not caring about your life, but they have a perk like Were Gonna Live Forever, or just want more bloodpoints. The killer turns around and smacks and re-hooks you. The survivor has farmed XP, at the expense of you being instantly put into the second phase or being killed. 
---
***Bonus In-Game Term***
---
Sandbagging is when you fuck over your teammates directly while they are being chased by the killer. Throwing pallets in their face, body blocking pathways so they can't get through and end up being smacked, etc.
---
So... she grabbed the beads from the dresser drawer?
---
Max settings now. Before my upgrade it was medium with effects level 1, post processing 1, and everything else on 3.
---
it's not even a good perk on anyone but Nurse and Huntress. helpful - yes. giving huge advantage - no unless Nurse and Huntress. 
---
and a newbie recommended perk doesn't mean meta. also - weird suggestion since any newbie survivor will run away as far as possible to heal, they tend to waste time on these kind of things.
---
It only wrecks people who don't know how to play around it. If you're playing against some real pros then they might not even heal all game. They'll also notice when you beeline for them while healing and not heal in your terror radius next time. "he has nurses" is something you'll hear on a decent swf discord group
---
*He's right you know.*
---
LOVE all the killer mains saying they're fine, because of course.
---
Ok
---
At the same time, if it was an option, so many killers would opt out it wouldn’t be fair for survivors.
---
I actually had to disconnect this game, after she was unhooked, she not only became invulnerable, but the trap never triggered, even after I let the others escape.
---
i don't know where you play as Spirit, on my high ranks people 80% of time are not complete fools and assume Nurses on killer like Spirit so there's little to no use of it, i better run Enduring or/and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Yeah it is never good unless you are trying to get better at catching good survivors, just take your loss and be happy you are improving by going against that.
---
I mean, getting 15 free seconds on a generator + toolbox progression isn't a small deal. I hardly ever see them now, but you can't deny it'd be unhealthy if instas+bnps were present every game.
---
Make this a shared Google Doc and I’m sure we would all love to contribute to it.
---
SWF. Makes the devs more money so it will never go away.
---
What's up my fellow *looks at book* gamers.
---
I play in purple ranks and I get pretty good use out of it multiple times per match. But I also run it with sloppy butcher so heals take a lot longer too. 
---
I like Pop goes the weasel but I've only got it at tier 1 atm so I hardly use it on her.
---
This is a bad way to look at it. For one, the Plague can absolutely hold her own in higher level games. Secondly, you can make any killer work at any level if you're good enough with them, some are just more difficult or less consistent than others.
---
He doesn't want Trapper to be able to be able to step in his own traps.
---
Yeah, problem with “really good spots” is they become memorable and I always check them. 
---
I figure if ruin isn’t found by the time the first couple of gens are done it’s probably in this location. Or up top of the warehouse
---
I like the ideas for most of these, I want saboteur to be good again ;(
---
i guess you're blessed with stupid survivors cause i find it somehow useless on red ranks on Spirit.
---
I havent yet and wouldnt care if i did, survivor is way easier than killer especially in a SWF and just being toxic on top of that is not needed at all, so they wanna be toxic for no reason, i'll be toxic in response.
---
I just started playing a few weeks ago and immediately realized you need superhuman hearing in order to be a high rank killer lol
---
survivor isn't as bad though
---
anyone who says this cant run lerys/has never played vs a decent survivor on the map.
---
sure thing buddy. anyone who claims that never played against a decend Killer on that map
---
Yes, when you lose a match you can no longer continue playing in it, whether you lost it at the hook as a survivor or at the exit gate as a killer. A five minute game lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it,  kills or gens doesn't matter. The only difference is our level of empathy for each side's objective; trying hard to survive just *sounds better than trying hard to kill, doesn't it?
---
Yeah but the pantry is soooo safe for survivors so I’d rather they get that gen early tbh
---
unfortunately for me I have both shitty sight and shitty hearing :( i'll likely never be high ranked. game's still fun thoguh
---
What makes it more annoying is when SWF get cocky and teabag the killer like they’re so skilled when in reality they just have a huge advantage at being able to communicate and talk to each other. It’s one thing when you work together as team without being able to speak to each other through a mic, but it’s a whole different situation when you’re literally talking to your mates and letting them know your and the killer’s every move!
---
Yeah, I agree. I think it would be fair to give him two as default though, at least.
---
Tier 3 myers with judiths tombstone and tier 3 monitor and abuse
---
"WHATS GOOD NIUUUGGGAAAA"
---
Agreed man, I play exactly the same way. What goes around comes around.
---
For basically all killer the most you can just do it search for them by checking corners, going around the edge of the map, or a good one is finding a place that has palettes still cause they might try to seek refuge there.
---
But truly if your not the Doc running around with static then it’s just up to hide and seek.
---
I think it depends on the map. I swear that Gideon Meat Plant has only the ones you bring in + 2 or three if you're lucky, then you play on coldwind and you find like 15 in one tiny part of the map and none in a spot that makes them easy to relocate and use
---
You've already outlined the two most effective methods - running whispers and slugging the 3rd survivor.
---
Whispers has many uses outside of finding the last survivor. It helps you find the first survivor so you can start applying pressure without wasting time at the beginning of the match, and it's also useful during the match to find other survivors. Not only does whispers tell you where survivors are, but it also tells you where survivors aren't, which is extremely useful, since it'll help you avoid wasting time trying to find survivors and consequently increase the pressure you apply on survivors. Whispers is easily the most powerful tracking perk in the game.
---
If you're not running whispers there's really no reliable way to find the last survivor and yes, it's very frustrating when the survivor is crouching around the map trying to find hatch since it can waste alot of time, but there isn't much you can do about that.
---
That’s very true and very possible. However, we’re not omnipotent beings and we can’t predict whether or not this will actually happen. The easy thing to do to make everyone happy is just make it an option. If not to appease the killers then to appease the rest of the survivor mains who don’t want to be forced into a match with a group of friends.
---
and then they all DC and you wasted a mori
---
I was okay with it once the EGC went to 2 minutes. The terror radius one had me confused
---
Explains camping hate pretty well.
---
Correction: Both are problems. Connection won’t fix hitboxes. Server speeds/rework on survivors hitboxes or range on killers weapons will.
---
I don’t take it too personally. This subreddit is pretty fickle, moreso than others.
---
I made this on Snapchat man I couldn’t make the actual meme bigger :P. Didn’t want the survivor label to cover up drake’s hand so moved it around, I probably could’ve put it somewhere else though lmao. Thanks for the advice man!
---
Just toxic. Didn't mean to generalize every survivor
---
oh yeah. awesome, my favorite too. i savour it every time. ain't nothing like a good bm after Trapper/Hag/Spirit match on fukin Rotten Fields against 2 Blendettes on gens and cocky Nea and Meg doing 360 in corn or abusing Coldwind jungle gym walls.
---
Why would they dodge? They'll just want to kill you more right?
---
Well I main hag and spirit (also play billi) and I suffer when I play something else. Ive being playing plague since day 1 in ptb and she is too far away from the top. You can still make it? Well, one of my favourite killers is also Freddy, so yea I know you can, but it doesnt mean ita viable (in a consistent way). I love the plague and shes the only killer Ive prestiged... But Im afraid this game its not balanced arround high level game... So we have _billi_hag_spirit and maybe huntress being viable, nuerse being op, and then a lot of awesome characters beinf bullied at high rank... Its sad but its the truth. And we have to talk about it and no just saying "yea well all killers are viable". The devs have to know about it, and stop balancing the game arround a bunch of 15 years old salty kids with 15 hours into the game
---
I think the best way to deal with DCing is to just make their in game character go afk. No one but the person who DC's will lose anything in this case
---
how tf is plague next. literally walking aids lmao
---
Slug another survivor (generally one of the two when there's two left standing) and go search for the other. The other will either be forced to go and save their friend (giving you a head's up as to where both survivors are), or you'll have two minutes' worth of uninterrupted time to search without having to worry about the last survivor getting the hatch.
---
It’s alright, toxic survivors ruin the fun for killers and typically other survivors. I tried to talk to the other reply of the person who responded to you but I just got downvoted, nothing you can do about toxicity for now. I hope you get lobbies full of nontoxic survivors, have a nice night
---
I love this game, played since beta. It’s a sad end of the line if there are no Aussie servers (I’m NZ).
---
I hope they have the foresight to AT LEAST let us continue to use p2p as an option, so those areas far from the servers can still play.

I'd argue that the Plague is around the same level as the Hag and Myers. Maybe slightly below. So if I had to give a list it would go: Nurse &gt; Billy &gt; Spirit &gt; Huntress &gt;/= Hag &gt; Myers &gt;/= Plague.

As killer: If someone uses BPS while I'm using my main killer (meaning I usually demolish them) I hook them all twice as fast as possible and then farm with them and let them go. If they're better than me then I do the best I can without killing anyone. I absolutely hate playing survivor and getting BPS because the killer always gets all sweaty and every survivor finishes with less than 10k points and killer only gets like 15k. They don't seem to realize that that is an exceptionally low amount with BPS
---
As a survivor main, holy cow survivors are really toxic. I sometimes get into postgame to tell some survivor to chill out on bull against the killer.
---
I'm at green ranks. Like 13-8 I guess or something. And people are pretty chill. Not touch salt in postgame usually except from some numbskull who died just before the end of the game. Otherwise it has been a good crowd really. Killers are fun to talk with and be all "dude you did sick that round" or them telling me they were impressed by my run in a chase.
---
Hope we get more of that "good luck in your next game" kind of thing.
---
Acute or obtuse?
---
should have used default Dwight on the left. default Dwights are most adorable creatures on this planet
---
From a survivors point of view, thank you. People who bait others out make me livid and it just shows that they have no skills to be able to take on a killer.
---
oh but like... it makes sense? like sure it can annoying but what else is supposed happen? he just walks on top of it like it's not there?
---
No problem! This kate was the worst lol
---
Dead by Daylight has a bunch of ups and downs for both killers and survivors but it’s just how they have made it.
---
It’s never going to be balance but yes some of the buffs and nerfs have been very bad or at least unbalanced from a stand point, Fact.
---
It’s just a game when if you can stand it being distasteful at times just to enjoy some good matches that go okay in your favor then keep playing.
---
If the game makes me play toxic and salty/mad brah in each and every match I’ll stop playing it for good. So far I’m still going to keep on.
---
What can a killer even do thats toxic? His goal is to kill people. Sorry if you dont enjoy being killed? 
---
I get that camping makes it unfun for both sides, but sometimes there are legitimate reasons to camp, if I'm getting destroyed and the exit gates are open and I got 1-2 people hooked, you better fucking believe I'm camping and getting what I can. 4k just isn't realistic anymore, so I'll take the 1-2k. 
---
Sometimes you also occasionally run into the baby killer who just started playing and doesnt know any better than to camp. Is that toxic? If he doesn't know any better? I don't think so.
---
That happened to me. My first match playing as Clown. 3 survivors left. One gen left. We were all in a cluster of 3 generators. It was tense, but I managed to 4 man
---
Lmao I mean I love going against the meta, way more fun for me. But what the fuck was that? Just makes you seem like a dick.
---
acute, because dwight is A CUTE survivor ;D
---
Would have ended badly if they stayed committed though, they were just barely halfway and the time it took for the spirit to get there was ~5 seconds and they still had around 8 left on the heal
---
I understand that but I can go ahead and guarantee that if it was swf as an option would die out because you’re basically discouraging playing with your friends anyways. Also, the few killers who would play against swf are the same that being Ebony’s every time they see a swf. I personally think the whole bias against swf isn’t fair to people who just want to play with their friends.
---
Have you seen the shit that map can spawn? The door-window algorithm is currently either bugged, or they changed it to be that fucked, but there are so many god-windows that can be ran as long as the main-building loops with 0 counterplay.
---
Don't think of  that third situation as the other survivor bleeding out making it slower. That's two minutes of uninterrupted time you have to search without having to worry about the last survivor being able to get the hatch.
---
Haven’t played in a while. I load in as David with three other Claudettes and I’m already thinking, here comes trouble. But the killer actually wanted to do their daily as Spirit. We help them out for a bit, do some hooks and whatnot, and we go out merry ways.
---
I message the killer and they asked why I put down my item in front of them. Aside from prestiging my David soon, I like to give friendly killer my items as thanks for the game.
---
Cookie for you!
---
You could just learn how to play killer properly lol
---
I started playing when the game went free for a weekend a couple weeks back (I think like 3-4 weeks ago?), so I'm still pretty bad but starting to know the ropes. I recently got a game where I got mostly shit on but since I was running NOED I managed to get a kill at the end. I then notice that the survivors are all rank 9 and less (I'm rank 15, and only because rank 15 is the first rank where you can actually start losing pips so I'm literally just going back and forth between 14 and 15). Survivors proceed to tell me I'm trash and need to go back to fornite. Like okay, congratulations on shitting on someone who's several ranks worse than you?
---
Don't get me wrong, you shouldn't let the survivor have a 'Free Escape' or anything just for being hooked. But a Survivor also shouldn't have to be cucked over to the point of 'I lost one chase and now I'm being tunneled because it's an easy kill.' Especially when you generally had to have been saved by someone else to get off the hook. Someone who probably doesn't know where the broken pallets are, and doesn't know what you're running if it's not SWF. You shouldn't hit someone as soon as their off hook every time when you can go after a healthy survivor as well, or you can be doing a better use of your time by going amd starting another chase on people who are actually getting gens done. Afterall, one person on hook is one person who needs to be saved and healed, which means they have at least one man down for a solid chunk of time, so they won't be working on their gens for a while.
---
The only time I can see this being the exception is if you're running Dying Light and you're the Obsession. But even then, it's a pretty scummy thing to do, especially since most Survivor Obsession perks aren't really that good these days... (Mettle of Man is good and all, but I don't think it'll ever be as good as DS was.)
---
I'll admit to being a survivor main, but I've got a fair amount of time on killer. Even while playing them, I've never seen the point of tunnelling someone off hook when you can be putting more pressure on everyone else.
---
Ruin, bbq, spirit fury and enduring
---
OR
---
Ruin, bbq, nurses calling and monitor and abuse
---
that would still be better because the killer would still get a good amount of blood points for a successful sacrifice rather than just the quitter bonus
---
I like it better this way.
---
Nurse is good enough to not be trolled so she will more likely take pity on Survivors and farm with them. Trapper is another mid/low tier Killer and is more likely to get revenge when possible by burning a Mori.
---
Happens to me all the time as killer too, has nothing to do with the killer disconnecting.
---
Oh, you just described my whole life.  
---
It's always something like: Play a really good match against a really good killer - Black Pip/Pip  
---
Now you're going to get fucked over by a camper killer and depip.  
---
Rinse and repeat for 2 hours.  
---
I am currently stuck at rank 9 + 1 pip and god I miss purple rank

Rest in piece remember me, you will be remembered

Yep, matchmaking is screwed. If you stick with it though you'll improve and start ranking up. NOED is an annoyance and you're gonna catch a lot of flak for it but I think it's ok when you're new/ playing a new killer for the first couple times. One thing you'll notice is that there's some survivors you simply can't win with, if you shit on them then they get all pissy and call you a sweaty tryhard, don't absolutely destroy them and suddenly you suck and should uninstall, try to just have fun with a game and you are an "EZ Baby Kilr". Just remember that they must be pretty big losers if that's what brings them joy in life
---
You did God's work
---
A failed skill check regresses a generator by 10%+ 3 sec where no progress can be made (according to the wiki), while overcharge regresses by 5% and lullaby by 6%, making a failed check do 21% regression and stop work for 3 seconds (working out to 19.8 seconds lost). I assume this would take the place of addons that reduce skill check in the dream world for gen pressure.
---
A couple of those sound like they'd be map noises like the sounds from the coal tower. the rest seem a little sci fi, not too sure on who they'd pick
---
That's fair, but I like to come back to the bleeding survivor before they completely die out so I at least get my sacrifice, so I'm not comfortable with searching the entire map. I will however generally search a fairly large radius around it. Should I just completely let him bleed out and not care? I feel like I'm just wasting a kill at that point.
---
So...... Which one of them do you main? Just curious
---
That's not what I said. I was answering your question. That's how discussions work. What I said was that I tend to favor doing a gen over doing a totem. If there's a dull totem, sure I'll go and clense it, but only if there's nothing else to do. I can't garuntee that the killer has noed, and totems are secondary objectives. Randomly clensing a dull totem instead of doing a generator can be wasteful on time. I shouldn't have to be so worried about a killer MAYBE having a perk that I stop doing what I'm supposed to do just to clense a totem. You're not so worried about bamboozle that you don't loop killer shack, are you? Why is NOED that much better than all the other perks to deserve that kind of respect?
---
Yeah...  I wish whenever i get rite of ruin i dont have to go in with basically 3 perks
---
Lovely.
---
But not for legion right? I mean I guess this is the way to go since now it won't hurt her mid-game as much but I think removing her late game entirely is a bad move still.
---
I always enjoyed Bloodhound more than Nurse's anyways in regards to tracking injured people.
---
Had a long, intense game as the Trapper today in the swamp. I think I hooked everyone twice, but eventually fell behind and they got the best of me. The survivors had to fight for every single gen, and I was proud of my game even though everyone escaped.
---
After the game I got a really nice message from one of the survivors saying good game, and that they hadn't had that much fun in ages. If I played against you and you're reading this, thank you again!
---
You know, I hate the Game just as much as anyone. That being said it has some really nasty safe pallet loops. You can loop a killer for several gens at least if you're capable enough.
---
Weird, from what I see it rarely happens on PC but happens all the time on xbox. Probably a regional difference
---
As a survivor main (I suck as killer, believe me) my rules are simply not being an asshole.  
---
For the other survivors: I don't sandbag them (unless I didn't know they were in the loop I just got into), I heal everyone when they ask for it, and I'll always try to save people from hooks unless someone is already going or the killer is face camping. I also don't hatch camp, and will never farm hooks. If the killer is camping and someone (or even if I do) removes you from the hook, I will tank the first hit always  
---
For the killers: I won't be a toxic asshole. No teabagging, no flashlights, and I will not try to interrupt your hook. Also when I'm last man standing and the killer finds me, I'll allow him to get me. (Unless trapdoor is inside my line of sight). If a survivor is being an asshole to the killer, I will always point out where they are.  
---
And most importantly: I don't DC. Ever.
---
lol. so i am kind of on the same page as you cause after Clown chapter it's waaay easier to play killer which, tbh, should not have been such a chore from start. survivors in fact were too op.
---
but at the same time i don't get what you're mumbling here.
---
the other day i got full swf with 3 MoMs and 3 Dead Hards. playing Spirit with nothing meta or op(no ruin, no noed, no Beads). never camped, never tunneled, not my style cause it's boring. got only 2k and two who escaped were on third hooks too. it was harsh and disgusting. i got real tired there. it was worse of a time waste with MoM than old ds where i at least could counter it and to make it work team either had to sabo or body block - therefore NOT ON GENS.
---
to other things. they buffed flashlight angle save if you didn't notice. last week on Game some Claudette got VERY questionable saves where both times i was facing the wall literally one small step away from it. it's as gross as instablinds. 
---
your information is outdated. it'd do be like as you say before engine change(that fucked up sounds) and certain new perks/changes. 
---
only survivors to still really play selfishly are Claudettes. it was this way, it stays this way. with current pipping system tbh people are actually more interested in saving than ever.
---
and don't forget two new maps. the piece of shit Ormond with invisible scratch marks and no auras and a fukin Temple map with amount of pallets impossible to eat. 
---
i'd hands down agree with you before engine change though. after Clown chapter i stopped using meta builds and noed completely. i still don't but feeling like using them lately tbh cause game got real survivor sided again. gens are popping much faster too. they buffed toolboxes and new Prove Thyself is ridiculous. i get in a game and two survivors with Prove Thyself pop the gen before i can get to this gen to check it aka around 30 seconds. that's insane, i'm sorry.
---
He likes to watch first
---
He does
---
I'm glad you're respectful, it's refreshing. Noed IS really helpful against SWF, for sure, but that just shows the brutal strength that good communication brings to this game. Personally, SWF is something that is inherently unbalanced, but as it stands, the devs don't seem to even consider fixing what a SWF, meta perk build, all flashlight, instaheal, and/or brand new part+engineers toolbox can do to sway the game in the survivors favor. I've played against some really high skill SWF groups that escaped in a matter of what felt like a minute or two because of genrushing and/or a key. While NOED can be good for that, I don't see any reason that it would ever be neccisary for a skilled killer to use, let alone lean on. But you definitely do have a point there.
---
Wish I had a pc to buy it on&lt;/3
---
you understand that looking forward while moving backwards is the exact same thing right? its just a different perspective
---
Okay, that's fine, but why would you want a perk on Feddy that gives the survivor guaranteed skill checks that instantly breaks them out of the dream world? Not only does it make it so you can't attack them, but it also breaks the dream world penalty which already slows their generator progression.
---
you're having fun going against meta? and what makes me seem like a dick?
---
drew, nobody owns you anything... be respectful..
---
Thx horsepower99, I never thought u'd update this audio thread xD
---
Learn hatch spawn behaviors.  I don’t think they spawn in exact locations, but as a survivor I’ve learned about 4-5 spots on each map that I check before going spelunking.  You might not see them right away, but it would at least give you a general area where you can watch for movement.
---
Also, if you’re getting exasperated and feel like the survivor is holding you hostage there are a few real cheesy spots that they can “hide” with no intention of searching for the hatch (got held hostage by a Kate for forty minutes, I could hear her but couldn’t see her and finally in desperation looked directly into the sky and of course she was levitating a solid five feet off of the edge of one of the haddonfield roofs teabagging like a ninny) not sure if these spots are well known enough to be online and/or discussed openly.. but I guess the moral of my tale is when you’ve exhausted every possible corner try looking at things from a different previously thought impossible angle.  Where there is a will, there is a way.
---
To me, a kill's a kill, no matter how it's done. 
---
If I think the other survivor will save them, I'll stick closer. But if I think they won't, I'll leave them alone. It's different with other killers, but this is easiest with Freddy.
---
NECRO POLICE OPEN UP!
---
I like how the guy above got upvotes, then someone says agree and he is downvoted O O F
---
Go commit oof
---
That’s fine tbh. It could even be a smaller immediate incentive like games at higher ranks have a BP multiplier or consecutive completed matches without a DC give a stacking BP bonus
---
They'll prob just dodge so they dont risk losing social credit score for playing with you
---
social credit score is a thing in china btw
---
&gt; Kinda ok offerings, but not very useful
---
Ever seen a P3 Claudette with a black Left 4 Dead t-shirt with a New Moon Bouquet?
---
NOED is kind of a joke honestly, unless the survivors are idiots it will mean a max of 1 kill and the killer is forced to play with only 3 perks for most of the game. The only way to get more than a single kill with NOED is to have a group of survivors who stupidly rush the hook instead of just leaving. NOED is basically the original endgame collapse, not a significant threat to decent players but encourages people to leave quickly rather than wait and BM the killer.
---
I just played a mirror Myers on PS4 about the time you posted this. Were you the guy who put in the Lerys, mirror, memo, monitor, AND had noed?
---
yeah and its literally a freddy perk...
---
SCS isn't a thing until 2020 I thought
---
It's almost as surprising as a facecamping Nurse (on purple/green ranks).
---
It's not, really.
---
if they facecamp, it sucks but there's a low chance teammates can  help
---

Good luck trying to fake rescure in open location or basement.

You’re 100% correct. I don’t claim to be an elite killer. I’ve been rank 1, but I don’t let that define my skill level. It’s not hard to be a rank 1 killer/survivor in my own opinion. I just run NOED, because of the lack of respect for the perk. Honestly if DBD got rid of the ability to SWF I would be all for a nerf to NOED, but even with NOED an above average killer can easily have all 4 escape sadly. Now of course that’s extremely situational but usually with NOED 2-3 can still easily escape if they are coordinated.  I wish another game mode would come out where two killers could play vs 6 survivors or so- and I think that would help (somewhat) sort skill from luck.  Have I had a 4K of skill? Of course.  Have I been lucky and didn’t deserve it from NOED or my play-style? You bet.  Strong points coming across.  I’m sorry there has been some extremely negative responses and some shade thrown, but to get to the root of the actual problem more tests need to be ran to make this game last for a few years before the second installment launches.  Thank you for the kind words and the insight once again.
---
It will not "  end every survivor left in the game if the gens get done." That only happens near rank 15. Any decent players will ensure that NOED secures a single kill at most, and they typically find the totem and save the survivor anyway, making it a 0 kill perk.

Yep I saw noob3 earlier get smacked through a pallet drop, looks like they just said they were gonna do something but never really did anything, looks like the same lol
---
i feel ya. what i did is got a buddy to back me up on purple ranks and now when i'm on red again games go much smoother and i freely solo. just avoid obvious Claudette mains, that actually helps.
---
True, didn't think about that.
---
"Killer main"? You haven't said a single thing in this entire thread that doesn't sound exactly like what every single excessive survivor main says.  [https://imgflip.com/i/2fd4tz](https://imgflip.com/i/2fd4tz)  perfectly sums this up
---
I just wish that they put the old pip system back in so that way even when I get matched with morons that are just crouch walking I can still win the game and feel good
---
I don't think you understand that survivor perks are intentionally diluted since there's 4 times as many of them in the game. The ones that mirror each other (Like adrenaline and NOED) are intentionally stronger for the killer because there's 4 possible instances of it on the survivor's team.

Repost reeeeee

Oh no another survivor main crying what a surprise
---
Jesus Christ, this dude is the most bullshit "Killer main" I've seen yet. Reminds me of this meme:  [https://imgflip.com/i/2fd4tz](https://imgflip.com/i/2fd4tz)
---
Maybe. Just wanted to give you some shit. Have a good day, then.
---
If I realize I’ve taken a wrong turn or accidentally blow up a fellow survivor’s hiding spot I go into full on distract mode and try to lead the Killer away.  Its less of nicety and more that I can’t fucking stand it when a survivor tries to lose the killer by training him on me.
---
I don’t sabo hooks next to gens that are being done.
---
I never realized how bad the pig's prestige blade is until now.
---
hey man, i understand we all have our opinions but some people really like legion (myself included) so please try to be a little more considerate of others. ty, sorry for replying late at night and i hope you enjoy dbd and life in general &lt;3
---
So, genrushing is fine because that's the survivors objective but killing them isn't? Yeah, you're supposed to manage it before gens are done but there's a reason survivors don't automatically win once the last gen is popped. Also, there's a mechanic in game to help survivors who failed their objective. Are you now gonna say that leaving through hatch is toxic because you failed your objective?
---
I feel like they’re gonna make Ghostface more of a “concept” than one particular person. What I mean is, they’re probably going to make it just a *being* of some sort, like a combination of all of the Ghostfaces but they’re technically no one under the mask.
---
You could argue that losing 20 seconds on any gen they touch provides more benefit than the dream world debuff at high ranks as they already (most likely) have self care.
---
But it doesn't seem like the optimal build either way, especially with how many pallets he eats and his overall difficulty with seconds hits.
---
Darth Vader is Luke's dad.
---
amen. the old pipping system would also solve dc problem since most people dc to avoid losing pips cause it's stupidly hard and farmy to pip, losing one to camping/tunneling killer or even the afk Insidious/no terror killer. ugh. 
---
Reddit folk for some reason say red ranks are sweaty and all but i have been there for over a year ok and i don't know better place. much less toxic in endgame chat, much more survivors and killers who actually know what to do(therefore you don't get chased for 5 minutes and no gens being popped cause of ruin and killers don't camp as much cause they know how to control the map better). i solely enjoy playing both sides on red ranks.
---
By the Nine!  Appreciate the correction.
---
Yeah, it's a cycle. The killer plays survivor and is never given hatch, thinks "Why would I give other hatch?" and then it repeats itself with a new batch of people. Then a different player is given hatch, thinks "wow, that was nice. I'm gonna pay it forward." And gives people hatch, then cycle repeats
---
You fool! Now people will poop themselves in terror!
---
Maybe when dedicated servers come out on live and are stable enough we can play bro
---
You can use at your own risk since some ppl may report you for using it. But, imo, just use green one is fine, the purple one still slightly broken on it owns.
---
It honestly sounds like pretty standard sci fi effects, I wouldn't be surprised to find it to be a hoax. This is amplified by the near-total lack of buzz around it and the steadily increasing evidence of ghostface being next
---

doubt that. American and Canadian servers won't give me from EU region a good ping either.

I agree with the window bit but there is a lot of bs hits in this game that don't all belong to latency. But yeah, it annoys me when streamers call bullshit on being hit through a window. Like, no shit you got tagged halfway through a hole in a wall, not exactly fort knoxx.

Sometimes it's better to leave the slugged survivor for a little bit and head back as soon as they're up. If you have nurses calling it'll help find where theyre healing.

I mean that is the standard Scratched Mirror build so could still have been someone else

Genrushing already makes it harder to pip. NOED gives a reason to not gen rush at all because the possibility of a killer having it makes some players cleanse dulls, which gives time for the killer to actually get kills and for survivors to get in a chase. That’s what the game wants. Not running MoM hurts the team because if you can’t loop there’s no way for you to stay in a chase long enough for a single gen to go off. Survivor perks like MoM only effect 1 survivor because there’s no reason for it to effect multiple survivors. Killer perks effect all survivors becauss it’s a 4v1. If they didn’t it would be pretty survivor sided. I’ve said this before in replies to other posts snd comments and I’ll say it again. The survivors MAIN objective is to escape. The killers MAIN objective is to kill.
---
So, wait, you agreed that adrenaline is bad, then you said noed is better, but you're defending noed but not adrenaline? I'm confused what you're arguing tbh. Not trying to disagree, I just think you stated your point oddly or I misunderstood.
---
Ok buddy
---
I do play killer more frequently than I play survivor, yes. Just because j have a problem with NOED doesn't automatically make me a survivor main in disguise, detective. In fact, I pretty frequently argue that survivors have it way easier than killer, almost to the point of survivor being a little braindead at times. That being said, there are definitely perks on both sides of the board that need looked at. Mettle and NOED are two of them.
---
If you fail to do your objective as killer which is to patrol gens and hook any survivors before they pop (Which is what the game is supposed to be) then you don't deserve the kills. Hatch is there for asurvivor who were good enough to stay alive and successfully escape, there's a reason why the hatch randomly spawns and isn't given to the survivor immediately. If hatch didn't exist then the survivor would hold the game hostage, and it's realistically impossible to do gens by yourself to open the exit gates. Noed is completely shitty and a crutch. It's unrealistic to expect solo survivors to do the totems because there is no reason except for certain totems that are lit, and the fact that it's an attempt to slow the game down or else survivors get punished cause noed is completely shitty game design. There's only so much time in a match before one side snowballs, either you do gens, or you and your team dies. That's the sole. Center. Objective as survivor. Totems offer little except preventing a perk that probably isn't being used which is hard to go off of because there is no way of knowing how many totems that are left or any notification of other survivors that did totems.
---
I don't care who you are if your gonna get moried I'm holing my ass off the generator to you and you better believe I'm gonna Tbag you, it's just common courtesy.
---
no like mid chase i will be chasing one they crouch behind one thing and disappear, quite often lose them in an open field too....
---
Everyone around rank 15 rarely look for NOED or cleanse dulls. They just immediately escape and/or try to unhook while it is active, which if it ends in a kill, they cry about it being OP.  Any other rank makes it a 1 or 0 kill
---
I can't get past rank 7 as a solo survivor. I managed to get to 6 once, but immediately depipped because you don't know what you'll get for team mates when you roll solo. It's all a roll of the dice!
---
That comment was mostly made out of spite (this is a salt post after all) but my general point still stands: Killers get undeserved kills from this perk. Kills they didn't have the skill to achieve so they took this perk instead.
---
Ah that scene was amazing too! And the slow motion part with the flash running up to save him then the explosion
---
Damn so many good scenes in that trailer lol
---
Hey, it's okay... Listen, I enjoy playing legion too. Just don't tell anyone okay? I'll be in huge trouble
---
Why tho?
---
Respectable
---
Of course, playing him helped me understand him immensely.
---
Same unless they dc on death hook
---
I do the same but my friends thinks it's dumb when I do this
---
Are you saying that the Hag is too high or that Myers is too high? Because the Hag especially is definitely not too high. Cross map mobility, the best map pressure in the game, can shut down loops harder than any killer other than the Nurse, and she doesn't even need to chase people. Even if your traps never go off once in a game, it's still slowing it down by forcing the survivors to crouch everywhere. The Hag is definitely an A tier killer and if you don't think so than you are fucking high.
---
You're good bud, I knew you weren't serious.
---
God forbid it's a hag with mint rag, she'll just teleport away from chase lol
---
Disgusting
---
Hi I'm a real Killer Main, Doctor. Here's my say, lots of killers have bullshkt tactics but so do survivors, theirs mainly being SWF. If you assume they are going to have NOED, get off your lazy ass and pop those totems. If you get a gate open leave so you're not effected. Now if you're in the middle of it and gates arnt open, look for it. If you're stuck on a hook and survivors are lining up to be hooked by bring over altruistic and stupid, it's a loss. They should have gotten the totem first. It's just pure laziness about not wanting to hunt for totems when you suspect NOED. I imagine that meme of you riding a bike, sticking a stick in your spokes and saying "damn noed". When I swf we callout totem counts and if I play solo I just leave. 
---
As a killer I refuse to use it because I dont want your gens to be touched. It's a hindrance to my playstyle as I'd have to sacrifice one perk that could be viable entire game for a perk that happens at the last couple minutes. 
---
Distressing, Unnerving, and Overcharge is all I need. I choose to not run no ed because I dont get the chance to use it when I play. Is it a bullshit trophy perk that gives killers the advantage? No, it's not only a hindrance in my eyes but also easily dealt with. Stop being lazy. Can survivors still save? Yea BT and good tactics. Stop bitching and look how to deal with it.
---
Which I somewhat agree with and I see your point. I just find NOED to be a little too strong. I'm not calling for the Great Removal of NOED the Terrible or anything (despite it maybe seeming like that). I just think it does a little too much as of right now, and could use a little bit of a rework to help it not be so potant and almost overly effective.
---
You misunderstood. I never said that adrenaline is bad, I was pointing out that your argument that adrenaline isn't as strong as NOED is pointless because it's supposed to be weaker. I think you got me mixed up with u/Angry__German
---
I don't think so, but Tru3 sure had. Won't shut up about it.
---
this was enjoyable content.
---
I was more surprised when the mountain snapped cerseis neck at the start of the episode like wtf what are the next 3 even about?
---
Radical
---
It's a SWF group most likely. Not all that uncommon
---
Yes, you get a temporary speedboost of 150%. Since it's meta it's quite likely that all 4 survivors have it meaning that your side gets a temporary burst of speed that is faster than a killer with NOED. You seem to be unable to understand that to be balanced survivor perks need to be weaker than killer perks because there are 4 times as many of them in each game.
---
I messaged them. It wasn’t a SWF. (I’m the rank 8 btw)
---
That's not bad at all. The worst I've had was being paired with rank 1s and 2s while rank 8. 
---
They probably just take whichever survivors are available with a certain closeness to the killer's rank, then slowly expand the variance the longer the wait. At least that's how I'd design it.
---
it would be nice if they did something like this when you prestige
---
Yes please.

---
I don't think hatch should be removed entirely, in fact I really like the rework they gave it in Engame Collapse. I also don't believe noed should be removed. Simply reworked like that hatch was so that it can't give people free kills. Honestly, I think you and I are agreeing that both hatch and noed arent great mechanics for the game as of right now. The only reason I'm focusing on NOED is because this post..is...well...about NOED. Not the hatch. I don't really know how else to say that.
---
Try swapping the two perks in your previous comment and seeing how it sounds though:
---
"And I think \[NOED\] is in a pretty decent spot. It doesn't always go off. Sometimes it's super helpful. Sometimes it's super not. Sometimes it literally wastes a perk slot. My issue is purely with \[adrenaline\] requiring almost no skill to use effectively. 
---
Notice how it works both ways? They were designed to be natural counters to each other but NOED needs to be stronger because there's a maximum of 4 adrenaline's in the game and a maximum of 1 NOED. The only real difference is that to compensate how powerful NOED can be it has a built in kill switch that can literally prevent it from ever existing. NOED has a counter, NOED counters adrenaline, seems fairly balanced.
---
Toolbox for gens, BT + MoM + DS + Deliverance. Pump out gens and get saves when you can, don't make high risk plays, if you think you've done enough to pip, leave, don't stay for teammates.

I love everybody in this thread it's so perfect.
---
I'm not trying to focus on the hatch and I'm not saying that either of them is a bad mechanic. I'm just pointing out that you're complaining about something that's fairly balanced and refusing to see how weak it really is with how many different things either counter it or give survivors an equal advantage.
---
Maybe I'll get lucky and all of those  will go into shop cause I dont have the money to just spend
---
Yeah I'm not sure about other players but whenever someone tries to taunt me by teabagging or repeatedly doing loud actions, I just ignore them. They obviously want me to aggro them, so why would I? If they're busy taunting me, then they're not doing gens. Odds are they're running a bunch of defensive perks anyway.
---
FUCKING THANK YOU
---
I want white claudette back
---
oh, he's not great, but is just annoying as hell &amp; is a salt creating monster that can have wallhacks, AKA, true beauty
---
sac claudy 25 times and gg you get it.
---
A hag?  The killer you encounter once every 80 games?  That'd be unfortunate.
---
Man it’s been a long time coming, glad her passive invisibility wasn’t nerfed
---
Lol
---
More traps as base and more traps in total on each level.
---
Funnily enough, I recently had a killer down all 4 of us in a corner of the map, and he hooked all 3 of my friends in the nearby area, so I intentionally crawled right there to the far corner so he couldnt possibly bring me to a hook before I had time to wiggle out. That was pretty funny.
---
For the record we weren't doing anything toxic, it kinda just happened, between us trying to save/heal each other we didn't really have time to split up.
---
I had a killer tunnel and kill me because i was running DS.. which I don't and will never use, he had Rancour on and i was the obs. I pointed this out in post game lobby and the 3 friends i was with had a good laugh and he was salty, could be that or the fact they ran his ass round for 25 minutes.
---
Its time to drop the weighted clothing and get serious!
---
How about that op *shuffles to page 69* feral frenzy *looks at cliff notes* amirite?
---
Trapper, Wraith and Myers are the simplest ones.
---
Doctor and Billy are easy to pick up, but both have a high skillcap
---
Hag is harder to pick up but you get used to her fast, though still a high skillcap
---
Huntress just depends on the player I think, I had a super hard time picking her up and still suck as her, but some people are good at her from the start.
---
Nurse is pretty tilting to learn but once you do it's very chill.
---
Leaked footage.
---
It’s not that they’re fickle. 40 other people also agreed, they pushed the upvote button instead. Imagine if they all commented ‘Agreed.’
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag and Huntress don't need addons btw, so you can use them consistently, also Myers and Pig are playable without them, just not good.
---
They know.
---
\*Shudders\*
---
..White Claudette doesn't exist..
---
Don't bring back those memories..
---
Currently no, but that's a good idea.
---
A lot of bigger streamers who are VERY competent at both sides complain about busted ass sound all the time.
---
Fine, I'm fascinated. I'm still skeptical, but I'll have to try it after I get my computer fixed.
---
The bug happens with just 1 blade but with the green one it takes so long to stack up that it doesn't really make a difference
---
He's annoying if someone is running a skill check Doctor. That's where they purposefully expand their terror radius as far as possible and use Unnerving Presence to increase skill check possibility and also reduce their sizes. 
---
Couple that with the fact that if you get madness, which is inevitable, the skill check starts jumping around the screen, along with potentially having to clear madness 3 and just otherwise avoiding Doctor...it gets pretty annoying. 
---
It's especially horrendous/gleefully evil (depending on if you are Doctor or survivor facing) on smaller maps where it's harder to even stay out of the radius in general.
---
Solo queue on PC is SO hit or miss. I can't level up as competency is all over the place. Claudette's are still crouching around the edge at level 10.  Spend so many games just running back and fourth unhooking people. The big issue is pipping SUCKS now. Get punished for staying hidden from the killer, pumping out gens and escaping quickly.
---
This really cool.
---
Their net will shut down OMEGALUL
---
Goodbye, see you tomorrow!
---
From a Killer's perspective, I don't see the downside. The Killer will get more points for all the free sacrifices, and over-time those who frequently DC will be banned from this game.
---
It's good on Billy but outclassed these days
---
It was S-tier on Doc pre-nerf, it helped so much with applying pressure
---
Doesn't get smacked by pallets &amp; doesn't rely on addons? ooooh... I'd probably say Slappy girl(The Hag) or Zappy boi(The Doctor).
---
Hag does require a bit of skill to use properly, but after a few game you should get the hang of it as she can shut down loops by placing a single trap.
---
Doc is pretty simple &amp; just need you to learn his shock therapy timing. He does need addons more than most killers, but can work with brown &amp; yellow ones. He does eat pallets like a mofo, but will rarely get hit by them.
---
you sick bastard
---
Game starts, I see a deep wound bar, franks mixtape. And so two survivor dcs. Thanks Legion for having pity on us and letting us finish all gens
---
I got out of a game where I did 4 gens solo, started working on the 5th one as my two Claudettes gulped down vommy mommy's stew, I got them both off the hook but they ran together and got killed, went through the hatch and just scratched my head at the nonsense.
---
yup. You DC on PC - you'll lose 2 pips. Play competently nowadays and you're lucky if it's stalemate (don't gain or lose a pip) Frustrating as hell and makes it easier for people to not care and DC.
---
To be fair, nurse is quite possibly the single least add-on dependent killer, since add-ons just fuck with your muscle memory and learning thereof
---
she however needs, so much time invested to even be ok with her
---
Billy is the 2nd best killer and also really easy to pick up since he has great map pressure and a permanent instadown via his chainsaw.
---
I have a few hundred hours on killer, there's two options:
---
1. You wait at the hatch, they'll come to you.
---
2. You don't wait at the hatch and they escape.

You can't say that you're not lazy for not preventing the perk and then complain about how upset the perk makes you. NOED is there because survivors can get to endgame ridiculously quick, the threat of NOED will either slow them down by making them do totems or give the killer the ability to do something drastic in the final phase of the game. It's balanced where it is and it's not the devs problem that you refuse to take advantage of the perk's built in counter.
---
Yeah so they shall do that then, WAY better than dc imo

Better to just write GG than to actually say other things
---
What about Ruin? NOED is basically an optional ruin: the survivors can ignore it and get punished during endgame or respect it and take a little longer to get to endgame. You can literally remove it from the game before it ever activates very easily, therefore it's only fair that it punishes those who didn't do so. Without NOED a lot of survivors are getting undeserved escapes. escapes they didn't have the skill to achieve
---
Its not like they have a WHOLE community of different point of views to consider
---
There are numerous pictures like this of concept art and most, if not all, can be found in the DbD Artbook from the Deluxe Edition (or you can find a YouTube video showcasing it all)
---
This guy gets it. If it takes all game to achieve just one hook you have already lost and shouldn’t be a dick about it. You can usually tell when the killer is going to camp hooks when they haven’t gotten a hook and the survivors have gotten through a few gens. Most time if someone gets hooked early the killer plays fair.
---
To be fair, it’s usually the other survivors that are meant to be on my team that piss me off.
---
I actually like the game map as survivor. Sure totems can suck, but the loops are good, Balanced is amazing on the map and the doors can never spawn 5 metres apart from each other. And you know the hatch is always on the bottom
---
if one of them is my 2nd main? do i have half friend?
---
i meant Doctor is low mid tier not the perk on him. on him the perk was awesome
---
Wraith
---
his power allows him to; HIT SURVIVORS... multiple survivors, multiple times... but they GET AWAY...
---
oh you don't lose anything including items if you dc by killing the game in task manager or unplugging your Ethernet cable, that's what i do if it's death hook and i know for sure i lose a pip cause killer tunneled
---
Not really a specific spot, just aiming in the general direction should do the trick. Survivors are VERY vulnerable when doing a mid vault, even if the animation looks finished you can still hit them through the window. This is also the case when it's a window with a drop, you can hit them even when they're already mid-air on their screen. 
---
Try to aim for the survivor's back would be the best advice I could give you here.
---
The Name, he &amp; Michael can fuse to create, The Person
---
Turn you sensitivity up. 
---
When looping, hug as tight to the corners as you can. Survivors have smaller hitboxes than Killers, so this somewhat negates the difference in movement speed.
---
in my case i can lately not play a single game that is not toxic, maybe like 1-2 out of 10 games is an actual gg by both parties. and i find it funny that when i get facecamped and some saves me the killer tunnels me and when i teabag or whatever im the toxic one even when he's the one that started to be toxic lol
---
apple should have been more shiny smh lol
---
truth be told i was just looking for a title but thanks
---
If you have DLC, Pig will suit you. She's stealthy like Wraith, but her traps can slow the game down.
---
i was  about to say that its a **P3 CLAUDETTE** but you dont have bloody pants so you can pass
---
Well lag, Shitty teammates and camper is all fair
---
For me he is fun, cuz I like being chased and most doctors mind game themselves trying to zap me.
---
So... why are they slugged in the first place?
---
I agree with everything except:
---
"Sabotage is not toxic, nor is dropping the hook at the last moment. It is stalling."
---
Because it's never just one hook. You'll bring someone to a hook, it'll go, you take them to the next nearest hook, there Jake is, pulling that one down, and you don't make it to the third hook.
---
Sure, it's wasting their time too. But it is actually very toxic, imo. As a killer that plays fair 95% of the time, nothing makes me want to quit a match on the spot faster. I never do, but I want to.
---
Footsteps are too quiet. Most noticeable for Survivors, as Killer  *used* to stomp around like elephants.
---
Survivors' breathing and grunts of pain are almost inaudible.
---
Chase music is WAY too loud.
---
I disagree exceptionally. It was only a very niche situation where it might be a problem. Some people say "what if they just crouch follow you" Yeah... what if... they did that right now? It'd still work until the thing pops. It just means late game pig sucks utter ass now, and its not worth running at all. Its not really guarenteed death unless she tunnels you, and that in itself is already automatic death.
---
Oh yeah , I'm a survivor , i only have 20 more pallets to loop , if that fails i have deadhard , if that fails i have instaheal , if that fails i'll have adrenaline , if that also fails my mates with borrowed time will save me then i'll sprint burst to the exit gate , its so hard buffsurvivor .
---
Always pick a perk on the bloodweb, even if you aren't a fan of the one/two available. This way you will at least remove it from circulation.
---
What?
---
Confused. 
---
Oh, hi Mark!
---
Billy.  I wouldn't say he's the easiest killer. Bi he's so fucking satisfying to learn properly.
---
I find that every time I alt tab during the loading screen to open some survivors twitch stream page to stream snipe &amp; mori them that 1/2 their orbiting defense force fails to load.
---
Even though this game puts me into rage mode on the regular I still think it's relatively well balanced considering all the different components that have to be taken into consideration. I don't know if it's even possible to get a game like this perfectly balanced but as far as balanced gameplay goes for this game in particular, it's at least decent,
---
Here's the thing though
---
Just hear me out
---
Just once
---
no
---
how do you know they do tho?
---
So long as you keep having fun, that is what is important
---
i'd head back to your original file (pst whatever), and change 20 to 1.
---
Its expected from a 20.
---
Ever since they changed that map in öegion update, that map has turned one of the more survivor sided maps
---
Omg his hair is thinning haha... he might be getting a bald cosmetic soon!
---
*Cleanse noed while asleep*
---
Yep... the latter i managed to fix by binding the attack button to a random button on my keyboard and then rebinding said button to my mouse again trough ahk.
---
Clicking the flashlight at me when running away or to get my attention 
---
What I usually do is say fuck that clicky bitch and kill the 3 other survivors then I have no distractions going for the last person
---
Honestly most of the hits are not that bullshit if you learn the universal hitbox. However a slightest bit of lag can push it a bit too far
---
What did they change?
---
Sounds good although I didn't play when sabatur was good but I can just think that it will spawn Jake's that will destroy all my hooks
---
Gems should be specific perks and addons
---
Thats what happened so thats why i thought i was toxic
---
I'd suggest installing MLGA and block him, if you don't like going against the same guy. MLGA is not bannable, which has been confirmed by EAC numerous times. It will also allow you to see ping more accurate.
---
people asking that they implement punishments for DC'ing meanwhile they play as toxic as possible tunneling and camping everyone they see ruining the fun for everyone else but yourself. Yeh why not we can still kill ourselfs lol
---
The amount of safe pallets went from 2 to 200. 
---
(This might be an exaggeration)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnwdPlx9yR4
---
Oh shit, so there really is an unmasked Nurse, Trapper and Huntress out there? Really really cool.
---
If they greatly reward ranking up the game would turn to shit over night.
---
The only killers you would see would be Billys/Nurse and every survivor would run 4 meta perks with SWF.
---
Lets be honest, the game can't handle people tryharding.
---
No MoM, No Noed. 
---
Basically try and make the game fun within reason. I figure if people aren’t having fun then they won’t keep playing and since my region isn’t super populated (especially weeknights) I don’t want to be a reason for someone to quit.
---
So not tbagging, thats just unnecessary. Try and save my teammates and try to take the aggro if the killer comes back to the hook. I generally will try and save over camping the hatch, but at the same time if my team just let me hit second stage on my first hook then I’ll be less altruistic. 
---
As killer, obviously you try not to camp and tunnel. However if I come back to a hook and only see the injured survivor I’m not gonna ignore them. Depending on how the game is going I’ll often slug them so that they’re not just getting repeatedly hooked, but i have them and whoever gets them up not doing gens for a bit. If I destroy the survivors too early, I’ll let them get some gens done and often let some of them go. At the same time I’ve played toxic against survivors who asked for it. If you run up all clicky clicky then you should expect what’s coming to you. 
---
At the end of the day its a game and I play to have fun. Sure fun is subjective, but some things can certainly be unfun and aren’t really needed to enjoy the game.
---
I love this meme so much
---
Dead hard is easy to counter never have I seen anyone 100% get away with it 
---
Killer tiers exist for a reason and top 2 are free 
---
Adrenaline is situational same with borrowed time you wanna counter these perks fucking play nurse and win 90% of all the games wraith is low tier to the solid reason he has weak map pressure and his ability does not help him in chases the only element wraith has is surprise attacks 
---
You said you stopped chasing a claud bc someone went for a rescue but before that you also said someone had borrowed time you real just let the perk activate bc you though a free hit was worth it 
---
Pallet looping yea it's going to happen you're play wraith for fuck sake but you said nothing about mind gaming so I can't think that your skill celling with chases is high (if you did mind game the claud and it failed disregard what I said bc that would mean I am clearly wrong) 
---
Something to add again idk how you play but personally when I play M1 killers I do no respect a single pallet or back peddle sometimes I do try a mind game or 2 but usually it is just better trying to get her away from the pallet 
---
Also idk what rank this is and also you get poor games so what this game has always been unbalanced bc guess what dbd is incredibly hard to balance just get to the next game stop giving such a big shit and play to wanting to play games not for the ranks 
---
In the end it's a bit opinion based bc some perks are better then others and sure it can be p2w at times but if I can manage to hit rank 7 without dlc I think there isn't a huge problem bc this game isn't a competitive game on the same lvl as idk csgo, Dota, overwatch, LoL and so on
---
darn if only they had some people who were really good at the game they could consult
---
oh well, better nerf pig
---
Why Blame my skill when i can Blame the game right m8?
---
No please dear God no
---
Low
---
End Game collapse comes out.
---
Survivors: End Game collapse OP please nerf.
---
Killers: Ima just sit in the basement with insidious and see if anyone wants to leave the exits and t-bag me now LOL.
---
Your hit needs to start autoaiming before they've completed the vault, that's all I know.
---
I have had to close my game at the loading screens bc when it takes unusually long it's either 3 man's or less and I'd rather not waste my add-ons or theirs
---
You mean DC? Already in the game though.
---
How is this a discussion
---
Honestly killers are considerably weaker without decent addons. I recommend running BBQ whenever possible, if you're good enough to get atleast 20k points per game (before BBQ bonus) you should have enough BP to stock any killer you want.
---
"we're not DCing, we're leaving the match with style".
---
It’s about their feelings in the moment, not their kill count.
---
In KYF ds never rly wants to work idk why it's weird
---
“Did-did you just throw a pebble at me?”
---
It's more dangerous but the pay out is 2x altruism through the fucking roof
---
The only time I ever dislike a survivor due to what they pick is if it's a p3 Claudette other than that I don't judge based off character character choice
---
Somehow the OP’s flair makes the whole thing even worse and it’s brilliant
---
Go tell them then, if its such a good idea. It might happen
---
Problem would be how do you make a system that knows ur face camping I'm not a programmer or anything but I think there are too many "what if" moments for it to work properly but also face camping is a "strat" a shit strat but none the less it just is
---
I've honestly done this but not for the reason to annoy the killer but to just get better at flashlights since I haven't ever done a successful flashlight save yet. If they camp me for it tho I will 100% accept it
---
Yeah no, the real reason was because he doesn't have a $9,000 Gaming Chair.
---
Well sometimes you just get fucked hard
---
Mettle of man and / or DS
---
Whatever works I guess lol
---
That be aids for new players
---
pretty sure s/he found and slugged him first and wanted to find the other one so that survivor can't take the hatch, and let Dwight have it instead. it happens to me a lot where i always let the altruistic one or the one that's really good at juking to have the hatch and when i get the other survivor, i can't find them at all
---
My bad. Check out his other huntress or billy videos.
---
Hm, must be an automod thing with external links. [Last try](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bimbav/i_like_a_little_bit_of_liquid_courage_when_i_play/em1rb0q)!
---
Imagine replying to everything with a 1 y/o footage to make a point. In case you didnt notice yet. This game has changed a lot. I suggest going back to steam forums
---
in general, i always use BBQ + Ruin, and sometimes Nurse's with M&amp;A, either Enduring with Spirit Fury
---
NOED has many counters.
---
1 - Borrowed Time
---
2 - Mettle of Man
---
3 - Decisive Strike
---
4 - Small Game
---
5 - A well coordinated SWF
---
6 - Every Survivor in your lobby running all of perks listed above.
---
7 - (Most importantly) Don’t be a lazy ass and cleanse the god damn totems when you see them.
---
it's actually a Freddy
---
Rest in DCs
---
&gt;Hates playing with babies  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Eatskids
---
Yeah....yeah that checks out.
---
*Laughs in Iron Maiden*
---
Honestly though, a 4 man SWF are still immensely overpowered.
---
I standby trapper and billy. Both are very solid killers, and both are decent to start on but continue getting better as you learn more techniques with them.   
---
As trapper you can defend areas or set up traps in areas you want surivors to go, and herd them into that area, cutting off their escape routes and cutting the time you waste chasing them down significantly  
---
As billy you can get across the map incredibly quickly, and instantly down anyone who slips up for even a second. This combines to create a killer who is good early game, mid game, and late game. Which is very rare and makes him an all around great and easy to use killer
---
Honestly I think the game is the most balanced it’s ever been.
---
The millisecond you hear the terror radius stop healing.
---
No, but honestly if I bring an ebony Mori into a game and suddenly four Bloody Party Streamers flip around, I ain't using it.
---
Well, except for that one time, but what do you expect when your in game name is "Mori Me Harder, Daddy".....
---
idk about pig and Wraith. As a pig main I agree the pig is not as bad as a lot of people say she is, but there is quite a bit of a learning curve. With her the game really can be a resource management game, and with her recent changes most guides on how to use her effectively will no longer be accurate.   
---
wraith can be good, but so easy to counter if you don't know what you are doing. If hes looking for an out of the box killer, he can be meh. And he will never win a game at the higher ranks with him
---
Spirit wraith child 😂
---
They did actually do something against legion, and you guys are like: "omg I want my baby back" smh
---
moreso than billy and trapper? I love the wraith's concept and think he has a pretty solid execution, but he really is weak...
---
Excuse me, you are in the entitled killers support group subreddit, this goes against the group think
---
Yeah but OP did say he doesn't mind that people escape. Pig has to put some thought into her gameplay, but that's decision making rather than chasegame, unlike say Doc who needs to (or rather can) put timing-skill into his chases, Pig is basically an M1nner during chase.
---

---
ah interesting
---
I know that's not how it's supposed to be said but I can't unread it as

One time this toxic Claudette was doing all of her toxic shit. Waving a flashlight, tbagging, etc etc. She wasn't very good... So when she was on her last hook, and I downed her again, I put a reverse bear trap on her head and she became my bait. Every time she "escaped me" it was because she was toxic, and I knew shed lead me to her teammates in an attempt to get herself safe. Killed all of her teammates this way, then when I downed her for the last time, I picked her up, and started carrying her to the hatch, which we had both seen earlier in our many chases. At this point shes not struggling because she thinks Im going to drop her on it, but instead I keep walking. I jump down those glorious red stairs and hook her in basement, which spawned pretty dam close to hatch. If you are gonna be toxic, Im going to make you and your whole team pay for it. Don't be an ass hole, its not that hard
---
Lmfao that would be a funny start to an episode.
---
To be fair, one of their “fog whisperers” is that jendenise cunt
---
This is an entitled killer support group, you have gone against the group think.
---
Also no more dead ends
---
I had this happen to me a few weeks ago when I was repairing a gen. My idea was to lead him away after I was done so the killer would be distracted. This person squats nexts to me repeatedly for about 30 seconds before going to the locker right next to me and sprinting as he ran inside and out repeatedly. 
---
We lost that game.
---
Why not? I'm sorry but there is no reason why the killer should leave the hooked person after exit gates are open, unless they have end game perks like Bloodwarden. The other survivors will either wait till you leave the hooked person to rescue them and you will lose your kill or they are waiting at the exit gate and escape when you come near them. If you stay with the hooked person you have one guaranteed kill and might potentially get more kills if people decide to try to save them anyway.
---
Actually, I'd say it's pretty well balanced between Killer and Survivor currently.
---
The imbalance lies mostly between Killers (There's a huge gap between Nurse and Freddy) and Perks.
---
My god a ton of perks are worthless.
---
Fucking thank you. Omg. Finally someone who thinks the same as me.
---
Probably an immersed Claudette with spine chill and urban evasion that will farm you off the hook and blame her teammets for not bodyblocking the killer so she can escape
---
This subreddit is definitely way more toxic then most others.
---
Boobs to die in horrifying pain for
---
That sounds like griefing, not butt exercises xD How unfortunate
---
Fair enough.
---
I just don't want to advice people to use her until we really see how bad this nerf is gonna hit her
---
thanks for the psa
---
Yeah lol it was kinda funny but at the time I wanted to strangle them
---
Imagine writing this comment and thinking you are funny😂
---
Han Solo dies
---
For all those confused if you take a closer look you will see Jeff’s scalp through his hair in the picture. OP is saying Jeff is growing his hair long to hide the balding.
---
The Fog Whisperers are just meant to be a "thanks for advertising the game" thing. But yeah, if they were gonna listen to top players, they'd probably listen to her too, which is a fuckin travesty.
---
You'd have to be pretty sure all four survivors were toxic...
---
(Assuming exit gates are opened)Defending only goes so far. A killer shouldn't be dumb enough to chase off after a healthy survivor allowing someone else to sneak in for the save. Its predictable, they know your gunna do it. 
---
Ive saved people from facecamping without 2nd chance perks and perfectly willing to take their place and die for them. Especially if it was the only time they hooked someone. If I want to pip or safety then the trade is worth it. I already got gens so escaping alone doesnt help my pip our bloodpoints. 
---
Juicy juicy wglf stacks. - I mean.. Im a hero who just wants my teeeeeam to liiiiiive!
---
However, facecamping the first person you hooked early game just sucks. Its bad for everyone and makes me regret offering bloodyparty streamers, somehow they know who used it and will ensure you get less bp then the offering is worth.
---
I think freddy is a good killer. I enjoy playing him a lot but not as much as Myers tho
---
Thank you 3000 ;)
---
Yeah, he might not actually have been as OP as nurse, but he was not fun to play against. Now he is fun to play against, and people are now ALSO complaining. The BHVR team is actually fixing stuff, they just haven't fixed everything yet. You can't fix 1 million things at the same time. Plus, I actually kinda like having something in a game that's just a bit more op than everything else. It spices things up a little, and makes you get on your toes.
---
Link? My friend wants to know.
---
MLGA's been around for years now, no excuses.
---
It's either that or you don't get a game at all
---
Okay thanks I will lol.
---
The entity saw the words feral frenzy and then forgot to read the terms and conditions
---
This is me and NO ONE ELSE . THIS. IS . ME . GET 👏OVER👏 IT 👏.
---
With no add-ons, Freddy is basically a tier 2 Myers that has to wait 8 seconds before he can hit people. With add-ons he’s better but still a fairly weak killer compared to other M1 killers (Clown, Myers and even Pig are a lot better then him)     
---
He is fun, that’s why I play him but he’s not a good killer, I’m actually really excited to see his rework tho
---
Ah yes, the third party program that triggers Reddit like crazy and considers it cheating. I guess there is just no right move.
---
Lmao ok thank you
---
There is no need to be upset.
---
How can anybody hit a baby dwight I just don’t understand
---
Awesome. It's rare to see posts of actual skilled survivors. Usually it's just someone running for 5 minutes, throwing every pallet and never looking behind them.
---
Technically more than that, but for the sake of memes let it only be 50%
---
I wouldn’t say shes impossible on console. She is much harder to learn but shes still top tier if you can.
---
Looks like a combo of wraith and spirit
---
Your comment made me happy.
---
I know this might slung cruel but no matter what happens, no mercy to survivors are shown and if I get the chance I will kill them
---
where to download? :)
---
Happened to me on xbox I was facing a clown and playing Nea only had balanced on it was just there for no reason couldn’t run in a straight line then turn to the left or right without it saying I was wiggling
---
Noooooooooooooooo
---
From the 2.7.0 PTB patch notes, “Fixed an issue that could cause the Wiggle prompts to be active from the start of the match.”
---
Just wait for the mid-chapter, basically.
---
Once brought 4 bps. Turns out we played against a p3 ebony omega nurse build. Some killers just never change.
---
If you wanna add me up we can totally play sometime, GT is same as username here. 
---
I usually only play on weekends or really early in the morning (I work night shift 50 hours a week). I'm not toxic, I'm cool with a talking a little snack, but I'm not down with that toxic BS, I play for fun.
---
Ive got hundreds of hours in the game an no problem giving tips or whatever an I promise I'll never leave you on a hook to die ;)
---
See you out there in the fog mate
---
I feel attacked and I don’t like it
---

---
Ah days that i played dota 2 6400 hours and i stopped because fuck your mid or feed

It’s a glitch, not an edit.
---
Killer: Never bring NOED, no hatch stand-off enforcing, no camping, going for the farmer instead of the unhooked. I have a sweet spot for baby Megs, they always get the hatch. No mories if not necessary. 
---
Survivor: No tbag, flashlight click only near survivors, swap places on a hook if it's a camper, try to take a hit/aggro if I fail a skill check or sth. like that.
---
But there are exceptions of course.
---

This is a reddit post of a screen capture of an Instagram post of a Tiktok video. This cancer has soo many layers.

Yea it does man one of my friends is a killer main and he confirmed when he closes app while loading up it keeps everyone else there waiting an extra 5 minutes
---
Yes ;_;
---
Didn't even get the nobody escaped alive bonus cause my deviousness was full
---
Take two is similar to Technician... Only difference is that it applies to other actions other then repairing... So it's basically no go on that one..
---
I like his honest sounds of joy.
---
Whenever he hits someone with the chainsaw or simply merrily runs across the map swinging.
---
It's like childrens laughter.
---

Your welcome
---
(Jokez. Good job, man!)
---
Killers also DC in the load up screen so everyone else is forced to sit there and wait for the lobby to close or shut down there app and reset. That’s some real pathetic loser shit, killers can be more toxic if anything because they have the power over the lobby and they’ve done this to me plenty and plenty of times
---
He is tho ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
On a serious note, how many times is your girlfriend asking you to wear that in bed?
---
Ah DOTA. I still miss you and how you literally made me want to tie a plastic bag around my head.
---
That’s part of the game bruh, do you think sitting on a hook and being slugged laying on the ground until you bleed out is fun lmao
---
It takes a lot less than a snap of your fingers for 100% to disconnect

I think scientifically speaking it's akin to bugger all, nowt, diddly squat, zilch, sod all, or jack shit. You know, to get technical.

Thanks for the charts though, I think you're the first person who's taken the time to chronicle it officially!
---
David uses Dead Hard and kills Thanos.
---
Then the killer is a Doctor
---
No, just do it with what I said. Ofcourse you can replace, but for some reason this build works great. You dont want to actively guard your totems, just drag everyone into the dream world and kill them. The game will be super long but its quite fun. Good luck.
---
Im reporting you for spoiling Endgame
---
That's the base skin
---
Sorry but your wrong, this has been happening for a Hell of a long time, you especially notice it when someone puts up a good offering the killer will purposely DC so he wastes it and the people’s time so don’t blame it on the game it’s very well the killer it’s been a problem on PS4 for a while now even dodging is terrible there’s some killers who legit wait for a full lobby to join then keep leaving so you have to wait for another lobby like they don’t even want to play the game. Killers are toxic even before the game begins with this shit and if you don’t believe me hop on PS4 and enjoy the experience
---
Your really rude
---
Imagine if your boyfriend comes into the bedroom dressed like this, pushes you onto the bed, and then you hear you boyfriend shout “I’m home!” from downstairs.
---
The majority of killers don’t even want to stay near the hooks anyway but a lot of the time the survivors are giving them a reason too 
---
Yes I can see you David don’t expect me to just walk away
---
**yuor**
---
Took long enough XD
---
Me pointing out that you are insulting people that answer your question (which makes you rude) makes me rude? 
---
Don't be an asshole to people if you don't want to get called out.

Your being really rude right now and if you don't shut up then I will report you

Oh well...you're screwed :))

Everyone plays with their own rules in mind. You are not forced to follow anyone else expectations. I do go easy on survivors if there is a dc but it's my choice to do it or not. I played against a leather face that plays only to face camp every hook and he literally would not move an inch until that survivor is fully sacrificed. I asked why does he play like that he said "To each their own i guess but a bonus is the messages i get afterwards. I have thick skin so its entertainment "
---
I'm rude for pointing out you are being an asshole to people?
---
&gt;if you don't shut up then I will report you

I have a free right to comment on this post, if you want to report me go ahead, all I did is point out you are being an asshole.

This must be the elusive plunderers nerf no one wanted
---
Lord knows why people dont play her more often. If you are smart about trap placement shes incredibly lethal
---
Soylent Green is people.
---
the fact that you’re feeding the troll this much and couldn’t comprehend that the original post was meant to be a joke about bubba being an attractive thicc boi is fucking hysterical SKSKDJSN
---
I like your flair
---
Did you have sex with the costume on? 😅
---
The Claud cause she can crouch
---
Most likely playing on a big tv at a distance with no headset. I refuse to play killer that way because I will always loose survivors easily and can’t hear the groans of pain when they get downed. Survivor is very doable though as you don’t have to be as attentive to as many things as a killer does.

Jon Snow leads Bruce Wayne to the Northern Air Temple and betrays him by having Boba Fett jump him there
---
MGLA? whats that?
---
Cause you were next to the hooked person so he probably didn’t think those noises were from you. That was a smart idea.
---
That actually happened in the first movie!
---
👏👏👏👏
---
What? Just say 4.6 m/s. A lot of killers are 115.
---
whats MGLA
---
*Meanwhile the R20 Killer stepped in his own Trap*
---
I enjoy playing Bubba, but he’s definitely got some ridiculous weaknesses in comparison to other killers:
---
He has no way to mask his terror radius but also has one of the largest. On top of that, he has no mobility to make up for any of this. He’s tall and easy too see over loops.
---
Then his chainsaw mechanic is just fucking stupid. I’ve been cucked out of countless downs because the shit will be at 99% then reset back to 0. Easily one of the most frustrating mechanics.
---
Then there’s the temper tantrum he has when he bumps into anything. The hit boxes on environmental objects make this extremely frustrating.
---
Add ons that don’t work.
---
In short, he’s a scuffed billy. That’s exactly what it feels like playing Bubba.
---
He doesn’t even need a rework. Just reduce his terror radius a little bit and fix the stupid chainsaw shit and he’ll be good to go.
---
I'm surprised that they didn't t-bag during the mori
---
*Excuse me what*

Funnily enough, there's a picture of her from the day before, in her Meg cosplay, wearing the suit 😂

One question, I don't frequently see jendenise but I thought she was nice like Scott (her bf). Why's she a cunt?
---
Good deal. This game is literally just cat-and-mouse hide-and-seek with a horror coat of paint. People getting salty or butthurt over "losing" need to gain the perspective that blood point acquisition is your goal more than anything so you can keep getting items and perks and leveling characters.
---
If I get caught it may be that I didn't play things well or the killer just predicted what I did. And fair play to them when they get me. It's my job to be a sneaky sneak and avoid being seen altogether, more than being able to run away.
---
uncultured sWINE
---
Can confirm, had 2 DC's last night playing Doctor
---
She’s toxic as fuck towards nearly any killer she faces.
---
I believe changing icons holds no risk, its just messing with the actual "ini" files that could get you banned
---
&gt; when half of the issue is survivors are just sore losers in a game they haven't even lost yet
---
stuntman is ridiculous, take two is technician on steroids, and never was there is so niche itll rarely ever see use

---
FIt's dumb that it has to come to this but this is indirectly solve a bunch of problems for people who've come to rely too heavily on MLGA.
---
"I can't find any games as survivor, these queues are awful!"
---
"Wait, don't you use MLGA to block killers?"
---
"No, I just use it to check ping! Well...that and I block any Legions I come across. And Doctors, I hate playing against Doctor. Oh and sweaty Spirits get blocked as well. And Nurses that use Ruin and/or NOED. And Billys that run Spirit Fury/Enduring. And Clowns, I hate them because they dare to throw bottles at me and it sucks. And any killer that may have a hiccup of lag is obviously lag switching.  And if they can't read my mind and play by the invisible rules I set for them they get blocked as well. But that means nothing! Why can't I find games?!?!?shift1"
---
"Well maybe it's because-"
---
"SHUT UP, I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE FUN, IT'S A GAME AND I DESERVE TO HAVE FUN AT ALL TIMES! ONLY MY FUN MATTERS, THE OTHER 4 PEOPLE IN THE GAME EXIST ONLY TO SERVE ME."
---
I think so
---
Hmm I've gotten 2 salty messages as a killer... I usually just give them advice on what not to do in future matches. 
---
But mostly I get gg or thanks for not camping and and tunneling.  Just play fair and you wont get any salt lol... or play unfair and swim in the salt lmaooo
---
Essentially you would block a killer you hated/didn't like for whatever reason. If you joined a lobby and saw "blocked" you would dodge immediately.
---
I either see it there, in the middle of the road or off in the corner past the playground equipment
---
Because it extends queue times and forces people to reset their router in order to avoid this shit. If you play nurse/billy its almost an instant MLGA block.
---
Pretty much! Or even someone allowing themselves to get downed because they absolutely MUST finish their gen. I have a soft spot for gen jockeys, too, I guess. :P
---
Oh, and if I figure out that I'm playing with a rank 20 or something, I'll let them live just to give them a fuzzy introduction to the game.
---
only if you play like an ass.
---
More like "How Legion ruined the perks and mechanics for every other killer."
---
Thanks, Legion, for screwing with Borrowed Time, Thanatophobia, and Nurse's Calling on the Doctor.
---
People put random stuff in their names all the time, I don't think it's a good indication of whether or not someone is trolling.
---
Throwaway reddit accounts are pretty common.
---
The thing about nurses is that there are very few people that are just God’s, but it requires a different play style to juke a nurse.
---
Ok, next time I will play without perks, good with it?
---
The problem is survivor's rules are completely arbitrary.
---
You didn't give X person hatch. You didn't let people do all the gens because X fuckwit decided to DC after being found first or being hit first. It's utter nonsense. If you want to DC and let your team suffer because you can't handle a specific killer, fine. I still don't think MLGA should have EVER been endorsed because it just harbors a toxic mindset.
---
Survivors can power through Ruin, is not too hard and Fire Up is still garbage. All Myers I saw had Ruin and anti loop perks, but they still got gen rushed and looped.
---
Yeah I didn't say it was. Did you read this whole thread?
---
For some reason I feel like i've seen this post before...
---
Some of the pro doctor videos I've seen actually don't recommend Monitor and Abuse on him, oddly enough considering it's his perk, because you want him to have a larger terror radius to inflict madness.
---
Just wow people always assuming the awful
---
I wouldn't call it a nice side-effect.
---
Some people would prefer to block people that target them every game (which happens a lot) or spam stuff that is awful to play against (like frank's mixtape Legion or Basement insidious LF).
---
not really, if anything it can prevent toxicity because i don’t wanna get tunneled/camped/slugged/used op addons on every time i go against a certain player lmao. trust me, nobody blocks JUST because you didn’t give hatch.
---
This.
---
Sounds like this girl I was playing competitive Gears with. "OMG you guys dont cover me when I rush you are all trash." meanwhile at the 4/5 spot on the team..
---
On stream people were sniping umbra and they brought 3 strode keys and she brought a Macmillan. They went to Macmillan and for lack of a better term they got fucked
---
So many salty skinny bitches in the comments jealous that they ain't thicc like Bubba 💀💀😂😂
---
Just act like you're gonna give it to them, walk up to it, shake your head no then throw them onto the nearest hook ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Want a Twinkie?
---
I understand then, if you’re slugging though, people really aren’t gonna assume you’re letting them live. They’ll go off alone in a corner and die for petty revenge :(
---
Hold up. Daddy Myers bony? Let him bone me? YES!
---
Bubba is big boned tho :)
---
I rarely find people like you on this sub. Most other people just think NOED is a problem even if the easiest way to counter it is cleansing dulls.
---
Waluigi dies and Shrek kills Thanos.
---
Really? I always thought they did but then again I never really go for both.
---
Wait a minute
---
Oh
---
Thank you. This guy gets it.
---
You must take a hit and get protection points, or rescue someone from a hook.
---
Saves dont contribute.
---
waiting
---
Yeah, it catches a lot of flak despite being pretty easily countered. If you don't want to cleanse dulls then run hope instead of adrenaline, chances are that you won't get hit anyway.
---
Are you sure? It used 100% used to give. Unless they removed it or its bugged. 
---
Getting people out of bear traps also gives stacks.
---
I'm actually not, surprisingly. I'm a lil disappointed haha. I've only gotten two request actually. It's good tho.
---
Haha thanks
---
Ikr x'D 
---
I just had a round as hag and hatch standoff and I got more cause I hate playing her x'D and this David did the last gen I ran with bird over to him and well I dunno how he did it but he turned into a P3 Claudette and disappeared x'D
---
hex: fingerblast
---
Fun fact: Being alive increases your chances of dying!
---
The Doctor would like to know your location.
---
Marty almost did it with his mom
---
I've been away from the game for like two years, but then I came back last week and discovered damn near every build seemed to include BBQ, so I just spent two days leveling up leather face so I could make it teachable.  
---
And now I have to do this for like ten other killers lol.  So I have quite a grind ahead of me.
---
actually it does since you can close the hatch now although it activates the exit gate it seems like the exit gates spawn pretty close to each other so i think thats a pretty fair trade off although sometimes the exit gates spawn pretty far away from each other which is a problem for slow killers but not for top tier
---
Hell yeah, use a year old video to try to argue about the current situation. That's gonna work!
---
Nice to see my post come to reddit! Lol.
---
BBQ is nice but infectious fright is pretty nice.
---
Yes you can close the hatch that’s the one good thing but also guess what else THE HATCH SPAWNS NOT MATTET HOW MANY GENS ARE FUCKING LEFT
---
I'm 90% sure that this guy either got the game last week or is trolling. There's no way he can be serious about this stuff, "I'm not lazy for not doing something super easy that will save me a headache later on. OH MY GOD HE BROUGHT NOED NERF NERF NERF NERF NERF OP OP OP OP OP OP OP!!!1!1!!" like, come on man.
---
That's a good point actually
---
I read somewhere in the upcoming mid chapter patch notes that it was fixed so once it goes live there shouldn't be any issues
---
Aren't gonna hear anything with the sound of that damn sacrifice and person on hook screaming
---
Noooo dwight, a tier one myers is coming look behind you! Oh god he cant hear us he's in a locker oh god, oh no!
---
i would agree but the importance of her power is mindgames and rng sounds like a good solution for this
---
Or luck out and get it for 2k shards on shrine (like I did).
---
I find these games incredibly boring and uneventful when people play a killer just for a daily to not even attempt to try.
---
So you're telling me...we technically could get shirtless cosmetics for everyone...this is good news.
---
Exactly what I did :)
---
Rank 5 survivor vs Rank 17 Killer. “gg 2 ez” “baby killer” “git gud”
---
I love the shrine, it spared me so much grinding.
---
We were all slugged. The game lasted for 5 mins I got 2k bloodpoints. Im not asking her to farm, but when shes slugging/tunneling in a 400% bps shes toxic.
---
I have a few documentaries for you. "Moody 15 year olds" have killed a lot of people.
---
I mean it's still bugged with one blade, it's just less effective since it takes longer to stack it.
---
Indeed I am.
---
Dead Hard? Do you realize that countering Dead Hard means just swinging two seconds later? I can’t believe people complain about such an easily countered perk.
---
Ok, I will consider this. Thank you!
---
I remember that one Time the game started with 4 Survivors and one immediate DC. I played really forgiving. I ate every Pallet, no Mind Games, always went for the unhooking healthy survivor, never protected the hook. Because 3 Survivor are no challenge otherwise.
---
So everyone escaped with a 2 Hook count. Got T-bagged and called sweaty baby killer. 
---
Never again.
---
Hold up 3k is considered a bad game? I feel like you're the type to rant because the last survivor got the hatch.
---
Honestly I’d prefer to play killer mute rather than survivor mute
---
Funniest shit when you pretend to look away long enough for them to be relieved only to double back behind them and smack them from behind 
---
Ninja Wraith’s got a couple of DCs that way, from rage or fright most likely
---
I'd hope so 😂
---
yeah i can see that she probably shapeshifted into a plane
---
Insta-heal has a huge impact on the situation it's used in. It doesn't matter that it's a one time use.
---
Every online game ever has had punishments for leaving. If you're playing CS: GO competitive and you leave? You lose rating. Disconnect during For Honor? Punishment. Rage quit during a MK match because you're getting rinsed like a bitch? Quitality. Yes, people paid money for this game. And the people *besides you* would also like a complete experience, since they paid too. Life happens, and some people have bad internet. Those people don't deserve to be punished. But if you're rage quitting because you got downed first or survivors "gen rushed" you, then your ego is too fragile for multiplayer games.
---
Get over yourself and stop conflating rage quits with some kind of consumer right. Because you're utterly wrong and selfish as fuck.
---
Best feeling when Papa Bubba gazes at you lovingly 
---
Almost enough to make me ignore the sting of a hook through my shoulder..
---
Actually, it's a great cosplay!
---
I someone with a knife forced me to give a negative point, I would say the knife... It's not a kitchen Knife.
---
Anyway, really an excellent cosplay
---
well if they screw up and get gen rushed yeah i can see that happening.
---
I knew a girl who told me she would sometimes have her ex wear a Myer's mask in bed 😂

Yep, but they do it to "make a point" I guess.

So I'm confused... do you or don't you think killers will camp in the endgame? And since the Pig no longer has RBTs activate in the collapse, don't you think she'll now camp more often?
---
Real talk those these frozen burgers are fucking good
---
100% positive saves dont do it.
---
***wait I was just trying to educate***
---
They can’t really people should try to get better at managing their anger
---
Oh my God this burger is delicious! What's it made of?
---
With fast vault it's just about swinging early enough that you get them while they are still "in" the window frame. Once they've passed the frame they won't get hit unless they are laggy.
---
Medium vaults are a bit buggy, you will hit them if they are at the start of the animation or are completely done with the vault animation. If you lunge at them when they are mid-animation they won't have a hitbox and you will smack the frame :c 
---
[Example of what I'm talking about.](https://youtu.be/CWZKutJeV1E?t=556)
---
Grabs are fine tho, just click m1 instead of lunging if you are close enough.
---
Mostly salt
---
Its sick as fuck what do you mean???
---
Also, don't think I made that post under the impression that I'm some good ass player lol. I'm just someone who really enjoys this game &amp; want to play with people my age, if you dislike it that's fine lol. If I had a reddit account previous to posting the page i would've posted in here instead. thanks to anyone who'd consider playing with me tho.
---
DBD has that punishment too. You lose two pips every time you disconnect.
---
Yeah I couldn't read that without laughing either.
---
My point is this; no amount of punishment is going to stop me from closing a videogame when I want to close a video game. I don't care if it's because I'm losing, my pizza arrived, a girl is laying wide legged on my bed or the fucking world is ending. It is MY time and MY time alone that I'm sitting here wasting if I'm not enjoying myself. You, or anyone else in the game with me are not entitled to me investing my time in your entertainment.
---
And if you're actually saying that it is not my right, as a consumer or otherwise, to decide for myself when I want to stop playing a game, then fuck you and everything you stand for. You had better think very hard about the consequences of that standpoint, buddy.
---
This is why we got tickets for the 2nd day of release. Looked at Reddit the day of and there were Endgame threads popping up everywhere.
---
It always thinks I want to throw down the damn pallet
---
My eyes would be a little more south.
---
your GF is great Myers ^^
---
Oh no I meant that as compared to pc, nurses have it rough here on ps4. It takes a more significant amount of practice.
---
Do you know where I could find David's naked model? For educational purposes, that goes without saying.
---
Lmao how 😂
---
Eh it happens. Thus the reason I put it under salt/rant lol.
---
You right combine it with my other killer farm perks BP floods me at the end of a game
---
Oh I get that, but he legit bitches and moans about it every game. Not in a constructive way either.
---
They could make it to where DC'ing has more of a punishment than not having one at all like taking away bloodpoints from what they have saved
---
Yeah but they usually do so in a constructive way. His bitching is just that, bitching.
---
they do, it's just a bug that happens. i got a flashlight save and it gave me a token, but when i got another one, i didn't get any token.
---
It really doesn't fit the lore, because not only does nobody speak actual words in this game besides Ash and Plague, you're forgetting about distance. Voice comms allows you to talk to other survivors regardless of where you are on the map; the survivors don't have telepathy and can't do that unless they shout, which would alert the killer to their location.
---
The punishment is already fairly severe just people don’t care
---
I'd be staring at his tits.
---
What is the punishment?
---
Killer: If you're the final survivor and I down you, you get the hatch if you don't wiggle.
---
Survivor: I don't bring insta heals.
---
The drop rank progress, killer gets a bonus and kill, they don’t get bloodpoints, and they don’t keep anything
---
Well as I said, these are from my experiences and it’s my tier list
---
Um yes they do, the score event usually triggers a couple seconds after the save though
---
Thats true, I can’t decide how they play. However, it doesn’t change the fact that it was a selfish toxic killer move. I hope she will realise that one day.
---
People aren't mad at SWF just because it's people playing with their friends. You're just trying to twist the issue into something you can actually defend, because you know the real reason (voice comms) is indefensible.
---
This is a weird bug that has happened to me. I've stared at my ruin before for like 3 seconds and nobodies on it. I look away and suddenly it breaks. What the hell.
---
I honestly wouldnt call that severe, you can easily regain those items via bloodweb, they dont really care bout what the killer gets and not to many people care about their rank
---
It was kind of long.
---
They DO
---
Laurie has an ass 
---
THIS 
---
IS 
---
NOT
---
CANON
---
So survivors should take priority over the killer?
---
And it doesn't matter about people playing with their friends, people don't have an issue with that. It's the voice comms people have an issue with. 
---
"Like it's hard to go against SWF?" Voice comms give you a level of coordination you're simply not meant to have in this game. That isn't fair.
---
Yea, I forgot the sheet lel
---
Poor bob
---
Teamwork? Voice comms gives you a level of coordination you're not meant to have in this game. Period.
---
Yeah that's better though
---
Why was it selfish? They're there to kill you. If you all played into a slug strategy that means they played well and you all screwed up.
---
Learn from the experience, dont blame the killer. Otherwise you're just going to keep making the same mistakes and keep making the same gripes. 
---
From a killer to an apparent survivor main: 
---
you are not entitled to survive or complete objectives. I will not begrudge you your escape if you make it that's on me and I'll learn better for next time. It's not your fault, its mine. But that goes both ways. If the game wraps in 5 minutes, ya'll. done. goofed.
---
Personally as a console player, I can’t have an opinion on this till I’ve played it myself,
---
I know I know I was just messin. And yeah man it’s SUPER rough. Hopefully with the new “controller input” changes we can look around more easily
---
I wish it did, It'd be a sweet perk for him after the rework
---
Huntress is hard but the most fun
---
I agree QoL changes for Trapper would be great. For resetting traps automatically I think that should be a passive effect but for now Hangman’s Trick is handy for it, if you think it’s worth a perk slot
---
Yeah like I hope when I go against killers that they do this but it is in no a way rule. I've seen some survivors complain about not getting it and such. That's why I always try to play nice, just in case the killer wants to be a nice boi.
---
but they wont say that next game when you bring insta down hatchets and a mori
---
One of you must have made a mistake then because there are 5 totems.
---
Was it a doctor?
---
Ah, well it's still more BP, i don't personally care about rank as long as i'm not stomping noobs :P
---
If you have trouble finding survivors, Doctor and Wraith. 
---
If you have trouble getting looped, clown and doctor. 
---
Myers is also pretty easy and fun. Hes a basic m1 killer but can get instadowns fairly quickly. It's also fun to jump scare people.
---
well that was entirely his fault for walking into it
---
Oh god that is GLORIOUS!
---
Lmao I want him to give me his barbecue doe 😳😍
---
Claudette taught chests some tricks
---
I did 2, he did 3. I guess the killer was hacking.
---
He was unusually douchbaggy as he hooked me with all the spinning in place, and moonwalking he did
---
Oh? Source? I read through the DbD wiki but couldn't find anything about that
---
play doc that will get you to a whopping 70k a game
---
500 player limit per server.
---
Moris too. This is also a luck game. You can be unlucky and playing in a game with a mori or not
---
Well you messin has triggered me sir TRIGGERED!!!!!!!!!!! Did they say what they are changing with the input changes?
---
how what? lol.
---
Either you or your friend lied about how many totems were done
---
just because he's bad doesn't mean he isn't fun to play \ (•◡•) /
---
Luck? You just run in and apply the insta-heal to an injured/downed survivor or even yourself.
---
Maybe he had rancor or haunted ground. He probably wasnt hacking.
---
They still camp at rank 15 that's the rank I'm at may not be face camping but they still camp it's just not fun when the exit gates are open of course protect your kill
---
Your girlfriend forgot to bring D-strike?
---
Not that I know of. Just vaguely said “controller input changes” I’m pretty sure. Maybe there is more but I’m lazy and at work but I’m pretty sure they didn’t specify much.
---
Hes not awful and theres nothing more straight forward than cloak find survivor down survivor cloak again rinse and repeat
---
I mean even if the exit gates at open i feel like it’s scummy to camp so i never do
---
—.— you right but he’s still trash
---
"200 hours, old player" I've played 650 hours since december lmao
---
Even with all of the Hex perks on there are still 5 totems. They will just all be lit up.
---
I’m always looking for people to play with on Xbox, gamer tag is “A Shiny Lopunny”
---
you are correct, but getting things to rhyme to haddonfield is quite difficult and i broke the pattern for some good chuckles.
---
You must realize how entitled you seem by writing that
---
Kinky
---
entitled? am i not allowed to block people that ruin every game they get into with me?
---
I like it. I have a feeling, if he was added, his weapon would be those giant comical hammers, and his power would involve sandworms somehow.
---
Shes selfish because that could’ve been a game where everyone could’ve had more bloodpoints, but she chose to make it as short and horrible as possible. Thats just one of the game she will play in that day. She would’ve never depiped with that tryhard build anyways. Survivors can also play as toxic as possible, sandbagging, flashlight spamming and tbagging , like you said its their rights. However im pretty sure no killers wants to go against that bullshit, its hella toxic.
---
I thought that was a blunt on Ace's hand
---
It was the pig
---
Survivors with old sprint burst and vacuum pallets, and no exhaustion mechanic 
---
And no flashlight nerf, etc. Fun for both sides /s
---
I've only seen a pig on console once or twice and I've played her a handful of times. Her lunge is annoying at 30fps. Not unbearable but it's just more fun to use everyone else :p
---
People need to realise you can’t and won’t win every game
---
Hey, thanks man! I don't know why it's doing that though my cake day was almost a month ago. XD
---
Not that rank matters at all but i am rank 1. Character is just super easy to play around.
---
She brought a knitting needle that she stabbed me in the neck with during the performance 😂
---
Thank you for the constructive criticism and compliment! I'm planning on buying a replacement ASAP
---
Just because you got no obligations to do something, doesn’t mean you’re not selfish. You won a chocolate when everyone helped? Sure eat it in their face its your right. However, screw you.
---
What level does mom become shareable?
---
rank progress isn't an incentive or punishment. it literally means nothing. de-ranking just means they get easier games until they rise out of the easy ranks again, then they just D/C some more.
---
yeah but most of the time the killer finds the hatch first well for me
---
Didn't even know my post was on here till someone who added me told me haha.
---
I use it right now but that's because I only have 1 or 2 of the meta perks. If you don't have adrenaline then I would recommend it but around mid to high levels it's abandoned for perks like adrenaline, ds, dead hard, etc.
---
Yeah, one of you miscounted. He wasn't "hacking". You can deny you miscounted all day. I watched OhmWrecker this morning, a Trapper had Ruin active and all gens were completed and he had NOED. Ohm destroyed a lit totem, both symbols stayed up. He only had those 2 hexes at the end. Game aint perfect, probably bugged.
---
I run small game. I dislike NOED.
---
Was the killer Michael
---
oh queen i get it
---
Ha! Oh the salt of them.
---
It's a decision that confused the fuck out of me. Why would anyone ever want to play this game on the switch
---
lmao why? if they work it out better they could make something wayyyy cooler. Legacy was ruined from the devs lack of care for it, a big chunk of legacy players are fakers and way to many legacy players lost it due to account resets. If they are smart they can make cosmetics that are way more elusive then legacy
---
anytime i see insidious on leatherface i know theyre being a cunt, so piss off cunt
---
let's take a second to talk about selfish entitlement. 
---
You are saying that b/c a survive with friends burns 4 things that the killer should run a longer running farm game instead of playing the game they were intending to play the way they want. 
---
No matter how much you want something, and how much effort you put into convincing someone to give you something... that person always has the right to say no.
---
In this case, the killer had the absolute right to play the game as if no BPS were offered, and people who complain about losing them are out of touch. You *still* get your +400% BPs in this scenario, and the killer got the game they queued up to play. 
---
If you were an actual survivor in this game mentioned. Dude, I'm sorry. That sucks. 
---
But ya goofed.
---
Only if we can get black Meg too.
---
Calling someone Nea is just abusive.
---
This looks good, just gotta tweal it a little bit.
---
"baby killer ezpz" *Flashlight clicking and tbag noises through phone*
---
Ok thank you
---
Wow, that is goddamn ridiculous. Idk if it's a billy-thing, but I've never had this occur to me *ever* as Huntress/Spirit/Nurse/Myers. Haven't played Billy since the vaulting changes a few months ago.
---
idk about that. the rate of me entering lobbies where the killer then backs out has stayed the same - from when i had 0 hours to now when i have 1k. honestly i just assume most killers tab out until the game starts. unless they're really tryharding, of course
---
well its there choice to camp it and heavily depends on how good the killer is and how good the survs are slash how hard the killer gets genrushed theres a lot of variables for whether a killer is going to camp
---
Nobody is being an asshole...they’re confirming that there were 5 totems and that it’s possible one of you miscounted. Is that really a big deal?
---
He did a basement build and your calling him a cunt because of it?
---
Dwight is top tier
---
Really? Triggered because someone has a meme build
---
This really does sum up BM survivors 😂😂
---
Tell your fellow super supportive survivors to stop sending toxic messages to killers and we will all benefit
---
1) You can't/don't need to heal vs Legion or Plague
---
2) After healing time got increased and sloppy butcher got buffed, you can easily go ahead and do a gen in the time it'd take you to selfcare
---
3) Run bond and find others to give them points for their emblems
---
4) Run Adrenaline and rush gens.
---
I remember that guy, he asked a guy who was connected to the Scream movies if Ghostface was going to be in Dbd. They guy replied saying fhat he could reveal the secret on May 28th or a date around then. You don't need to follow him.
---
No.
---
I don't care if he is 'legit' or not, he is probably just follower fishing it really shouldn't be encouraged.
---
If he really wanted to release something he would he wouldn't beg for people to follow him before he did it.
---
It is a evil god givin with a appearance of a massive spider so mortals can comprehend it, and a gassy clown
---
10/10
---
No, because right now everybody connects to the Killer's PC which means the survivors all has his IP address and he has theirs. MLGA works by flagging IP addresses as blocked/loved.
---
With dedicated servers, you'll only be connected to the DbD server and you won't (directly) interact with anybody else's network so you have no way of knowing who the killer is until the match launches.
---
It's faster than one person, but there's a slight penalty for two people, so it's less than 200%, so it's slower than normal _for two people_.
---
tbf hiding in a locker is a legit strat against a tombstone myers
---
Never said survivors deserved a free escape but getting a 3k isn't even close to a lost
---
So, because we confirmed it's 5 totems and not 6, you refuse to believe ONE of you could have been mistaken and the guy MUST be hacking?
---
Great logic bro. Also, wow, we're as shitty as the KKK? Niiiice. Glad your parents raised you well.
---
Fortunately, the major draw of dedicated servers is that they can start keeping track of who DCs and punish them accordingly.
---
If you bring in botany knowledge along with it to speed up healing it's still useful, imo.

---
When did they make that a thing
---
While she was standing in a bad spot it looks like an innocent mistake rather than them trying to block you.
---
Love the pig with the survivors
---
Im rank 7 for both killer and survivor and also on ps4. Survivor games with 3/4 swf takes about 5 mins to find a game. Killer is almost instant. 
---
Might have to do with internet, whether servers are down or location
---
Good luck tho!
---
see
---
why nurse dead last for console to me it seems the same
---
what about "Not playing because the game runs like shit because it's starting to become hot outside and my computer doesn't like that"
---
though i feel like that's only a problem on my end
---
I had an Ace yesterday smack me as Hunter with every pallet on the map. Like 10 or 12 pallets right to my face. He stepped in 1 trap. A sneaky sneaky trap. He instantly DCs. I count that as a win, I let everyone else farm and leave :p
---
1 survivor is 100% individual speed. Two is 90%, then 80 and 70.
---
So overall it's 100%, 180%, 240%, and 280% when you add everyone up. Four people is nearly three people if there were no penalty.
---
Repost
---
Well like I said, I don't really play survivor except for a daily, so I just assume its rank 15-20 killers that see my Steam profile and panic.
---
But myers is not a manlet
---
a play style that does not exist in this game. Too bad.
---
I'm literally the one who made it
---
I've only been playing dailies for two months now. Still waiting on them fixing the pip system. It's stupid that the pip system is based on their idea of an "ideal" game progression, rather than merit based on outcomes and not individual game events like a certain number of hooks or chasing for a certain period of time.
---
Saw somthing exactly like this earlier
---
Maybe Myers because of lunge speeds, vault speeds, general feel is close for some builds.  they both kinda stalk their prey. They both have a knife :p
---
Got removed because I forgot to flair it
---
I just saw that my autocorrect turned noed into more and bird x'D 
---
Feelsbadman x'D
---
Oh in that case carry on good sir
---
Steve gets blown up by a creeper
---
Enduring and Nurse's Calling are actually very nice perks.

i personally have never had that problem with playing killer but every once in awhile i get a salty entitled survivor who hates on me just because i killed him/her but overall its fun
---
The insecurity is palpable
---
Because it is a clear indication he is not legitimate. 
---
What he is doing is the equivilent of me saying "I know 100% who the next killer is, no joke, no lie, i have insider information on who the next killer is, their perks, power etc. However i will only hand over the information if you give me money.
---
But i really really want to show you oh god i am so excited to tell you but i can't without a donation D: WHAT EVER WILL I DO!?!?"
---
Relationship goals
---
Ah ok, I get where you are coming from. Fucking Sernandoes of the world
---
Those are good perks expect no mither
---
Definitely deserved a babykiller comment or two but the death shit is way too much.  Being terrible in game and having to insidious camp into Moris still doesn't justify those types of comments.
---
I would rather had said foolish
---
Goals!
---
I mainly watch people for tips on how to play the game. They don't even necessarily have to be outright telling me the tips, I just watch and pick up some moves or some perk combos that I didn't think of before. Of course, being interesting and/or funny helps.
---
Those are super generic terms though.
---
When you say you don't camp, obviously you're not maintaining eye contact with the hooked person, but does that mean you go to the other side of the map? Do you patrol ~32 meters out? If you spot someone running towards the hook, do you move to intercept them? If so, do you let them unhook first or try to kill them before they get there? Do you move towards a hook (from whatever distance) once you get the notification or will you look for someone completely fresh?
---
For tunneling, do you refuse to hook anyone a second time before you've hooked everyone once? Same idea, but just don't death hook until everybody has been hooked at least once? At least twice? What if you hook survivor A and they're rescued by B. So you chase B for a while and eventually hook them. They're rescued by A again. Do you chain alternating hooks until A and B are both dead but you haven't even seen D and C is still on first hook?
---
How do you play it if the freshly unhooked person runs right into you? Assuming you let them go and try to find the unhooker instead, what do you do if you can't find them? What if the injured/unhooked person runs into you AGAIN 45 seconds later? Where is your threshold for when it's okay to hit that person again? Do you just leave the area entirely if you can't find the unhooker and hope there's somebody else on the other side of the map? What if there isn't but the other 3 survivors are super immersed and it's just that 1 person who wants to play tag?
---
Obviously that's a lot and I don't really expect you to answer all of those questions, but surely you get that "camp" and "tunnel" are pretty vague terms that mean wildly different things to different people. Maybe give a general idea of what they mean to you?
---
What's your channel? I'd love to check it out. And I normally watch the more popular channels just because I trust them more with their update info and stuff. But game play I like all channels
---
Timeless classic
---
I've played for 2 years and have fought 3 Insidious Bubbas in the last 4 days.  You are so full of shit with that number lol.
---
The 13th of every month
---
Can you elaborate OP? Getting hooked? Do you mean on dead hook or on Hook 1-2?
---
Less pallet head trauma buy easy to play? Probably Billy or Leatherface then. It's easy to be an ok Billy but hard to be a great Billy. Hag is really good and fun, but she takes a bit of map knowledge to really master. I always have fun teleporting around the map with Hag.
---
Enduring is literlaly one of the best killer perks and Nurse's is literally the best tracking perk in the game wtf.
---
no mither is good, it boosts your testosterone levels by a solid 100%
---
Got a bunch of 4ks followed by "gg! :)" multiple times this weekend.
---
Nice to not get a bunch of hate messages for being decent killer.
---
Also kudos the the players who directed me to the toxic survivor in their match, and once they were taken care of we proceeded to have a fun time :)
---
Its just a reference to a meme from last month. Was not trying to mention a specific match. Would work for any amount of hooks though.
---
Literally everyone is talking about the pig nerf.
---
I really like your idea. I highly doubt that Behaviour would be so generous, though.
---
billy is really good you cant really blame em
---
Depends on if you interpret the self-imposed longer waits as some sort of fault with the game itself.
---
WGLF could also get a buff. BBQ and chili has a gameplay function beyond the BP, WGLF should too.
---
From what I understand, they keep track of *reports* of disconnecting. And you don't get punished unless you DC in an insanely high % of your games. Like 80%+ They can definitely be more rigorous than that without punishing somebody who go stuck on the corner of the map with no gens nearby and no hope of being found anytime soon.
---
The reverse is also true. By DCing to prevent a hook you're saving 10 seconds, but you're also denying BBQ stacks, bloodpoints, and any other hook-related perks. To save 10 seconds. 
---
DCing for any reason other than a crash or game-breaking bug is a massively dick move and absolutely deserves to be punished. If you want to suicide on hook, be my guest. At least you're not circumventing a bunch of game mechanics when that happens.
---
I hate that iron will (my favorite perk rn) doesn’t apply to downed people. Like common son!
---
*laughs in drift king billy
---
They are probably just surprised you visit this sub.
---
I love how that’s the only question OP skipped.
---
If only survivors had a perk that would allow you to recover from the dying state.
---
Here's a few tips that are general and 1 tip that is specifically for you.
---
General -
---
- Everything you make is going to suck for a while, and that's okay, ive been making content online and offline for a long time i know the struggle and it's okay to not be great, i'm reworking my content and im aware my new stuff isn't going to be great for a little while.
---
- Screaming isn't funny.
---
- If a video gets a lot of dislikes it's a good indication you should evaluate what happened and try something else.
---
Advice for your channel - 
---
I took a look at your Ash DBD video your newest DBD video and here is 2 things that stood out to me.
---
- 1. get a better microphone. for real a cheap microphone and pop filter will set you back about £50 (60$ or so) you will probably not grow with a bad microphone because there is a lot of people making the same content with better quality.
---
- 2. Fix your game sound, i literally could not hear anything in that video, if you would like some software advice - i use Shadowplay to record general footage and Dxtory for audio, Jacksfrags made a pretty good setup video on that but i can give you a more detailed explanation of my setup if you would like that.
---
- 3. This is the most important **Edit your videos.** For real, or get someone who knows how, i know this sounds very mean but i skipped to different sections of your ash video a few times and more often than not i would be greeted by silence, no audio, no speaking nothing.
---
Rewatch your content before you upload it and make sure you cut out anything that isn't entertaining.
---
a good rule of thumb is - If you wouldn't watch your content why should other people?
---
People realized the mindgame potential probably
---
Same. Some dude actually spoiled Endgame to me in DM here on Reddit, all the while I never cared about watching it anyway so I could only think "uh okay, thanks?".
---
Almost made me laugh as much as the Tom/clown post but still top notch stuff, OP!
---
i dont think the graphics are that bad at least for me and i play on ps4
---
It's likely that players started to learn how to play Spirit &amp; found her to be incredibly useful if you know how to track with her. 
---
Similar to how people thought Hag was awful until players started to learn how to play traps properly which really improved peoples opinion of Hag. 
---
People started using her for mind-games due to not being able to hear her phase while in her terror radius meaning just standing still can force the player to guess if she is phasing at all. 
---
Once a player fully understands how to track with her, she is terrifying as shes incredibly fast &amp; can surprise players.
---
I remember there was a thing about how they buffed her by removing the sound of her breathing while phasing or something. It meant that during phasing, survivors couldn't tell if she was close to them or not.
---
Played a game with a baby Dwight, rank 18 and only had 2 perks. The plague couldn’t seem to kill us and ended tunneling the poor thing... I pallet saved and flashlight blinded but it was no use :( (Of course I t-bagged for him at the exit gates though ;))
---
The only thing that would have made this better, is if you two had switched which character you were cosplaying.
---
Okay thanks for advice. I’m currently waiting to get me a new mic and laptop so I can improve my editing and overhaul video quality. I know I get quite at some points and that’s something I’m slowly getting the hang of. I usually get more likes than dislikes but I will definitely take your advice.
---
wtf i personally havent had that problem although to be fair i am under 18 and most of the people i play with i think are under 18
---
Don't worry, we're working on it ;)
---
For people asking "since when"
---
The penalty has always been here, it just didn't make the bar red before
---
as /u/LeChatTerrible said, one person works at 100% speed, two people work at 180% speed, three people work at 240% speed, four people work at and 280%  speed.
---
Prove Thyself counters that penalty
---
It's probably for the best ;)
---
You get the caps,emotes and linkage, welcome to the tru3 community
---
sounds great lol
---
ok i love the idea but..... how do they fuck
---
3/4 perks are A or S tier
---
"Those are shit" \~OP
---
But there base game, most people want dlc killer perks
---
Stroke/outline works better than a drop shadow for showing white text on a white background, mah home boy
---
Like, no disrespect to the young ones It's just I personally don't want to deal with that stuff. I always have bad experiences.
---
This is way too OP. Please delete this and allow my eyes to rest. How can the Devs even let you run No Mither and Self-Care?
---
flashlight saves give tokens, but it usually takes like 5 seconds for the game to realise it and then it gives the token.
---
What about t-bagging and not leaving the match after exit gates are open and holding the game hostage?
---
logical ones.
---
i’ll take whatever this guy’s smoking

Bond &gt; self-care

Self-care 
---
positives: infinite heals

Bond

positives: can get teammates to help you

good for not leading the killer to gens being worked on 
---
negatives: zero
---
I didn't say that I think it's a fault of the game.
---
But he was targeted so I would say that’s a fair response
---
i would like this
---
I dislike the big guys because theyre kind of annoying. And most of them do the same thing. I dont hate them I just wont watch them.
---
Truetallent: his sub greet is annoying and hearing it constantly drove me away.
---
Angrypug: was mean to the killer post match and BM'd when it was a Wraith who didnt even tunnel or camp. Like thats the last killer you should be an asshole to.
---
Noob3: deranked and 360'd a rank 20 killer for the 86th video in a row.
---
It just gets so tiresome.
---
I do like farmer John and painkillers though.
---
ashely j williams lvl 40
---
Yes, I also 'member the endgame build, remember me+noed+blood warden. It was also really strong on the pig but rip pig as well
---
It's cool man, I get that it was a joke! It made us both laugh 😂
---
I had a game where I saw the last guy go to the already open exit gates and figured he would leave so stopped moving. He didn’t and was t-bagging outside the door, so I hit him once, and he moved forward, close enough to fall across the safety zone, but as he was t-bagging the entity said nope and he fell sideways 😂😂 hooked
---
&gt;Cosmetic tickets
---
Yeah, not happening. BHVR makes most of their money from people buying cosmetics, not the base game. If it was even easier to get them than it already is, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.
---
His green legion's pin allows use to inflict broken for a minute. You're welcome. Will you play him now?
---
She looks like that girl from RE7.
---
Sadly yes..
---
i missed that bit
---
She cute lol
---
the negative for using bond is that if the killer comes then it him/her the perfect opportunity to start slugging
---
Should have put a candle on his head.
---
Oh wow. I’m kinda glad he’s gone then because I hate people that go out their way to ruin people’s fun
---
Can you link me the patch notes of healing nerfed.
---
I'm messing around mate :p
---
Explain because I’m confused?
---
Thats...not how statistics work. As the posted above mentioned, if there is a 25% chance of the key being in any box (which, if there was a key placed in a random box of the 4, there would be), and if there is no outside influence on the placement of the key (such as having the key location based on the proximity of the survivor), then large quantities of trials would have the percentage of finding the key in each box come out to exactly 25%, regardless of human inconsistencies. It's similar to picking marbles out of a bag: there could be inconsistencies in the size of the hand of the person, the size of the bag, or whatever other human factors you could come up with, but at the end of the day, if you pick one marble out of 4 a bunch of times, you'll still end up with a 25% chance for each
---
...why are you waiting until the last minute to equip things?
---
You guys can say what you want but spoiling a movie is never right no matter how toxic they are.
---
Not toxic? Yeah.
---
Not fun to go against? Yeah.
---
I'd rather not play on Haddonfield against people with balanced landing, mettle of men, instaheals. 
---
I'd rather not play against tunneling exhaustion + bleach clown, omegablink/multiple blinks nurse, instasaw billy, prayer beads spirit, moris, etc.
---
Those things are part of the game so they don't make you toxic for using them, even tho they are overtuned/unbalanced. They just make people enjoy the match with you less. Whether or not you are ok with that is up to you.
---
Some people want everyone to have fun in the match, some want to make other people hate their guts in the game. Both are fine, it's a videogame. One is just less likely to make people like you.
---
If only Michael's played differently than constantly slugging making the survivor change their load out for a possibility of that killer.
---
Also she's the only one with a mask that actually looks scary
---
Thank you kindly.
---
Yeah some people voices just make me not want to watch them. I get what you’re saying about noob3 as well I just watch him for the edits.
---
Well that's just stupid.
---
Look him up, he's one of the biggest DbD players, or at least was for survivors. You can learn some things like what to do in your vids and what to avoid :)
---
it gives the killer the perfectly opportunity to knock down multiple people at once and create map pressure
---
happened to me once too and i was playing with a friend and gave him call outs. its stupid funny though
---
Thanks and I do mostly dbd with some MortalKombat, cod, madden sprinkled in but I’m looking to expand past those games
---
Yeah I know what slugging is but what does bond have to do with it?
---
Cleanse totems, hug walls, stay hidden you dont need to run away all the time.
---
Okay man I will do. But if you would like you could check out my channel it’s called Thetype2show
---
The healing speed nerf hit it really hard, plus sloppy butcher is a really popular perk and only makes self-care worse.
---
You often waste too much time doing it when you could be getting progress on a gen &amp; getting healed by a teammate later. I've won a ton of Spirit games by tagging people with sloppy butcher, hooking someone and then seeing 1/2 people self caring in the corners of the map via BBQ.
---
Looks about right ;)
---
She's low-key op. I'm a spirit min and there is nothing you can do if she's good. All you have to do at loops is wait to see what the survivor does then get them.
---
It's a bug
---
I gave you a sub and watched your Ash video. I think you're off to a good start and have potential but I agree with the other person who said you should work on the editing and get a better mic. Both of these things will really help the quality of your content. :)
---
I watch the smaller streamers more because they aren’t assholes yet. Most big streamers are dicks and toxic to the games they play and make me not even want to play the game.
---
Thanks man and I’m working on the mic and edit currently
---
Haha, well what you were trying to go for worked, and I sent a friend request
---
For true casuals!
---
Here's comes the mori!
---
You don't need to hang around your team all the time when running bond, you can just use it to find them when you need to know where they are.
---
Outside of that if the killer finds you two healing together then it's as if you weren't using Bond at all.
---
At least the visuals aren't THAT much worse
---
Let me sandbag you in a corner until the killer arrives because you took my chest.
---
It will take some time for MoM to be on shrine, from what I understand the newest DLC perks don't appear on shrine.
---
You gotta wait till new DLC comes out if you want to get the perk off shrine.
---
Yeah I would hate to play against noob3 and his friends. It’s already bad enough I’m console player it sucks more when you get toxic swf players
---
Yupp, I used to always saw if the survivors are good you want spirit. If they are brain dead you want Billy. Against good survivors she's the 2nd best killer.
---
Haha, thank you thank you. :)
---
still a daddy
---
sorry but what means snowball potential?
---
Haha I hope so! Only really play survivor though unless I have a daily. Is the difference that huge with survivors too? I've never been able to rank higher than like 10...
---
I was playing solo , so I don't think it matters.
---
The difference is that both Nurse and Billy aren't OP but perks like Ruin and NOED are as a direct result of how fast gens can be done. The game is entirely about being aggressive for both sides but killers can't be the same level aggressive that survivors can be. I would argue that if you aren't Nurse and Billy that you NEED to run one or the other to stand a chance of getting even 2 hooks in a game consistently, 3 and up on average. And even if you are Nurse or Billy they should also run it given that it will make life 1000% easier. 
---
Legion was never strong even in the area they excelled which was crowd control because unlike Doctor it isn't a recurring thing where you are constantly pressuring with your power but instead your power exists solely to get a first hit where you then walk after the guy you hit. And I do mean walk as that is more efficient than multiple stabs anyways given that they obviously want you to use FF to get that first hit but not chain hits after, and debatably use it to get in close before canceling early and stabbing normally. If anything I would argue they are like a uncloaked wraith which just feels awful to play without the benefit of losing your Terror radius leading into the hit. 
---
You can't make FF fun to play against like how you can't make perks like Ruin or NOED omnipresent at green+ ranks without substantially changing the formula. Nurse and Billy just have the best kits in the game and the only way you can safely nerf them would be to start basing gen speed off of the killer and their mobility.
---
No it doesnt. 
---
It's exactly the same as if you were to look for people to get a heal without Bond.
---
[type2show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUS_jmoHoO2MkNf07xkTSYw)
---
Honestly I have never found sandbagging or t-bagging to be toxic. It’s just a game don’t let other people get to you. And at the end of the day you just need to get gud lol.
---
Shit you know you're bad at Reddit when somebody has to answer questions on your post for you. Thanks, Borcastic
---
Yes, more like this please
---
Monitor and abuse + nurses calling: zero heartbeat 3 point longshot downs.
---
But there definitely is a trend and you can see it whenever anything is brought up. Pig, Legion are two huge examples of that with Ruin being one that has been consistent since it launched.
---
Its still toxic, its the equivalent of flipping someone off, i personally dont get offended nor care but still its disrespectful
---
Yea it’s too big of a TR for not having any sort of mobility or way to mask it.
---
The face I see, when I close my eyes and ejaculate.
---
Bell ghost!
---
HO HO HO
---
Takes waaaaaaaayyyy too long when you could be doing gems or something else that’s useful.
---
Yeah they both do

He's really gonna keep us guessing...

I predict there's something red in there

If I was playing as killer and saw that, I’d be afraid to play at night
---
bruh.. what am I looking at
---
Just do the hook glitch to run through a survivor on a hook quickly grab them and then let them go and run through their bodies ez rescue
---
She does have a very overly attached girlfriend look about her.
---
You give some very nice and detailed feedback. Could you analyze my videos/channel and tell me what could be improved? Thanks fam. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sH1jKgV3vxw
---
It looks amazing, guys! Thank you for sharing, I love when couples cosplay together.
---
Just derank like the rest of us. No point in being at rank one right now save for the achievement.
---
And that's not counting for toolboxes or perks
---
delet this
---
And for getting some time in chaces (Q&amp;Q)
---
Thank you! We're planning a bunch more DBD cosplays too! (By the way, your art is amazing! Just wanted to say that!)
---
Golden hearted eh?
---
Like I said, theres a majority
---
Killing a Dwight is like hitting your kids to death... very sad
---
Absolutely! You will be able to hear grass rustling, injured survivors, small sounds like the Spirit's whooshing sound, the huntress's humming, and it'll all be directional too! So you can tell where they're coming from. 
---
True immersion.
---
I know this is an old bug, but it's even better on Freddy since you literally can't see anything he's doing.
---
Please do! I love fan content so much 👀
---
(My goodness, thank you! I haven't drawn anything in so long too, I should get back into it.)
---
É so vc n matar a pessoa ou violar o túmulo dela q aparentemente vc ta ok de acordo com a lei (mas eu duvido q os puliça vão deixar vc sair deboas kkkkk)
---
That mask is fucking amazing.
---
Omg, I think I saw you yesterday!! Your cosplays were amazing! 😊
---
Cringe
---
Played about 4-5 games with daddy and only missed out on the 4K once. Daddy is my new main (until I can master the Hag)
---
I think I'd probably not enjoy Doctor and Nurse. You're screaming and missing skill checks all the time and she's wiping up the mess.
---
But Joey has the best weapon
---
The crapper
---
Tiananmen Square Massacre it is then
---
Every day, but I know it cant be helped. Content creators usually move on
---
I feel so bad about it, it's happening during my finals.
---
It starts tomorrow, and so does my first exam ;w;
---
Not Claudette but I've got my Adam in an nice all-black outfit. I was playing against a trapper in the skiing resort map on Saturday and was just crouching in the doorways of the main building (there are some almost black, shadowy corners) and he was just strolling right past me everytime.
---
f13 models had to be redone because they didn't do this at first.
---
Just make them blind let the hooked survived escape after a certain time.
---
Next in Survivors DBD: I play so i deserve to win: remove weapons from killers.  
---
You know, it kinda gets boring now - kinda glad devs wont add it
---
I checked out a video, not bad man. Like others have said, the mic would be the biggest thing I noticed. I would definitely stick to going for entertainment and being funny like you are doing as opposed to a serious channel with info/tips...personally I find those channels boring. This might be an unpopular opinion around here, but I think a certain degree of toxicity can be entertaining too, as long as you don’t go too overboard with it. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with like making fun of teammates or the killer if you keep things humorous.  I’d recommend checking out Morf_UK on twitch. I think he has the best commentary of any streamer I’ve watched, very funny! I think he’s a a good example of what to shoot for.
---
Killer: No camping, no tunneling right off the hook, if survivors want to farm gens, chases, and hits so that everyone (survivors and killer) gets good BP let them do so (and if playing as the Shape have a dance party with them at the exit gates), no hatch-camping, give the last survivor the hatch if the trial was fun, always say gg at the end screen.
---
Survivor: No teabagging, no flashlight-clicking as a taunt (catching the killer's attention if they're on another survivor is fine), no sandbagging, take a hit for fellow survivors in a chase or after a hook rescue if possible (especially if they've been a good teammate), don't DC, if the other three survivors DC I'll refuse to give up so that the killer at least has a chance for some chase/hit points, always say gg at the end screen.
---
I would have added 'no dribbling pre-DS nerf' and 'no leading the killer to friends', buuuut I've done both; dribbled a flashlight-clicking, teabagging P3 Claudette, and led a Wraith to a Meg during a five-minute long chase when I was on my last hook, because she hadn't been hooked yet, only did one gen all game, and was just sitting in a corner waiting for me and the other two to die.
---
You’ve got good intentions with this, but this is the kinda thing where I’d need to play test it to properly get an opinion of it. As it stands, it’s “leave the hook or you’ll be severely punished.” 
---
Which, in itself isn’t a bad thing, but will severely screw you over in the endgame when camping is the most logical thing to do as you’ve got no other objectives to defend 
---
(you could argue doors but guarding doors only hurts you if someone is hooked, especially if it’s not in close proximity to a door) 
---
The only other issue I can see is that If someone is hiding in the area, and I know they are in the area I don’t have much time to try and find them 
---
But like I said, with something like this, I’d need to play test it a bit to see how i feel about it
---
Number 3 almost sounds like square dance music...lol wrong turn killer maybe??? The last 3 sound hellraiser-ish
---
Thank you! I'm kind of lucky because it came looking like that, and it fits pretty snug! The only issues are that the neck flares out so I have to tuck it, and the hair sometimes gets messed by the wind.
---
just DC and report her. There is nothing you can do about this.
---
I actually feel bad because back in January, a Meg decided to be toxic and lead me to where her teammate was hiding in a locker. I downed the Meg, then grabbed and hooked the teammate. Should've just hooked the Meg, I'm sorry random dude on PS4!
---
Behaviour say peer to peer when they mean listen server, aka undedicated, aka player host. It triggers me greatly.
---
Behaviour claim a dedicated server will identify disconnections better, without explaining why, especially considering they already collect match data.
---
e.g. how it could be done in the future and how it could be done now with no functional difference
---
* dedicated server: player disconnects, log if manual disconnect or connection loss for anyone in database
---
* current setup: match ends, every player tells data collection if anyone disconnected and in what manner "I lost connection to the killer", "X lost connection but I didn't", "Y clicked disconnect", log conclusions in database, if the player's internet died they tell the database their side of the story when they next open the game with an internet connection
---
Hell yeah! It's always awesome to see people from cons on here!
---
Wait dribbling back then was toxic? Why tho
---
Okay thanks for checking it and the advice. I’m working on the mic now but I’ll definitely check out Morf_UK. I found talking shit hilarious if it’s done right.  A small amount of toxic isn’t all that bad as long as you not making the game horrible for the other player.
---
Not gonna lie i'm guilty of doing this XD
---
a basement build without iron grasp? lmao im not buying that shit
---
Yeah for some reason people don't think dribbling was toxic. Like, you're effectively rendering a perk completely worthless, and the survivor can't to a darn thing about it. How is dribbling *not* toxic?
---
If you know you’re getting good points and are stubborn like me, wait it out. Go get food or read a book. Otherwise just DC and report.
---
How is he irritating? He is so bad, I am usually super happy I see it's Doctor. He's worse than Freddy, literally the worst killer in the game.  
---
Nurse is the most irritating to go against.
---
Definitely.
---
I don't think the last thing changes anything, they already track every disconnection you do.
---
Everyone else already stays connected when a survivor disconnects, when the killer disconnects on Dedicated servers then the game will be over too.
---
4 games, 9 DCS and then 4 games WITH NO DCS!!!! WOO HOO!
---
Sad but true
---
That's the thing with ranks reset someone could be rank 1 then after two seasons of not playing much they are down at 15 but haven't lost much skill.
---
Hey do you think his meme builds still apply or has the new meta rendered them obsolete?
---
Here comes the crapper
---
What is BM?
---
The Nurse gets destroyed by Dwight!
---
When it’s way bigger than you thought it was gonna be.
---
New wallpaper
---
Not that it’s morally wrong, it’s just shitty
---
Tbh I have a hard time telling the difference. I thought a Listen server is pretty similar to peer to peer. I.E. one specific player is acting as the host, and other players are connected to the host. 
---
I think it could help identify disconnects. Sometimes there can be a hitch in the connection between one specific survivor and the killer, and not anybody else, etc. 
---
Heck I've already had cases where my buddy in a SWF team was somehow disconnected from the killer, not me. (he didn't quit, was randomly just booted out) For him, the game thought the killer disconnected, and showed the killer's perks and addons. 
---
I think dedicated servers might help in the long run.
---
Ok.
---
I just finished watching the video here are my thoughts.
---
Overall a pretty good start of a video but it has a little ways to go.
---
I recommend you look at the servery bullying twitch streamers series he has some pretty good editing.
---
- add an end screen or something along those lines the fade to black is nice and all but it left me thinking "Ok is that it?" End screens are not hard to make either [Take mine for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpkXt8fSyzk) (uploaded on my old channel unlisted) 
---
- Some music wouldn't hurt.
---
Overall you did  ~~a pretty good job so far~~ a good video i think you should keep at it and constantly try to improve you're content and you'll do fine in the long run.
---
Best of luck! :)
---
r/biggerthanyouthought
---
And a survivor whacker in his hand
---
Same deja vu
---
I completely agree on this. The perks Ruin and NOED are overpowered, and nurse and Billy are overpowered. The problem is, like you said, it's hard to nerf in such a way that it does not become underpowered. DS was nerfed really fairly I would say, and I am hoping they can do the same for other perks and killers. But you are correct, Ruin is one of the best perks in the game, because it just slows it down. I can't think of a way to nerf Ruin so it doesn't do what it does, but is still good. This is btw, also the reason I like Prove Thyself, so gens can be done faster, and better counter Ruin. But I still don't know how to fix the balancing issues.
---
It's just a logical change.
---
what about susie
---
If only someone could Photoshop that 😂
---
I don't get all the "Legion causes tons of DC's meme".
---
I actually picked up legion a few days ago with shards and took him for a spin. I've had a few disconnects (maybe more than when I play doc) but they were like maybe one DC every 8 games or so. I'm at medium/high ranks (12-10ish) so IDK if survivors around there just put up with it (hell I'm lucky if I can even sacrifice someone) or what. 
---
I was under the impression I'd just have to inflict deep wound once, and I'd instantly win match after match from survivor's DCing and reach rank 1 as one reddit comment said via disconencts alone.
---
Technically hebephilia.
---
Technicality: Is her lore saying she is underage in the game? Or just real life mythology ? (Either way we shouldn’t sexualize women it’s disrespectful!!!)
---
I was watching Hexy stream DbD the other day and Not Queen was in chat. Someone asked her this question and she just replied " people have been asking for that for a long time 😪' so I guess it's a no unfortunately
---
Hey, what is your psn? So i know which one you were that added me. Can message it to me if you don't want it public.
---
nurse isnt overpowered she just requires non-traditional methods to counter her which is stealth
---
Bad manners. It's when a player in a game is disrespecting other players in a game by either breaking unspoken rules or in DBD in particular, tunneling survivors. Bad manners can range from anything as simple as t-bagging in a FPS to spamming emotes (in games that have them).
---
Shes close to that age as well, at least, from what we know.
---
I watched that shit at 1AM the night it released. I was so tired but I knew I was going to be immune from that point forward.
---
&gt;It's the same % for everyone, if you play a ton of games then yes your minimum number will go up,
---
Which is flawed concept considering all it does is enable even the average player to "bank" d/cs if they have a 6-8 DbD session. We may not know the exact numbers/thresholds but even the average player is able disconnect freely whenever they want currently. There needs to be some realistic threat of punishment or we end up in the situation we're currently in. 
---
&gt;You risk punishing a ton of innocent players by punishing every disconnection, the game is nowhere near stable enough to allow that. All for a very minor effect.
---
And once Dedicated Servers are in place and they are tweaked this shouldn't be an issue anymore. With the killer no longer being the host, stability will increase. So the hollow cry of "think of the innocent players" won't even matter anymore. 
---
No one is asking for every single d/c to be punished. But when someone leaves a game, they're the ones ruining it, not the killer for using perks/ add ons they don't like or survivors for sending everyone to a map that they might detest. 
---
If you want to play a game where you can quit at any time with no repercussion, stick to single player games.  If you want reap the fun playing with and against other people brings, then you have to be willing to at least commit the time and effort into playing a full match. If you can't find fun because you're having a rough time against a killer, might I suggest Civilization V? I've been told it's a legitimate suggestion and if you take umbridge with it that makes you a whiny entitled piss baby so I'm only trying to pass along good advice.
---
True true
---
From the lore, yes shes about that age. Thats about when her father murdered her
---
Looks like laurie is about to use DS
---
I always kinda saw using ruin and/or NOED as slapping folks in the face with the fact that you're bad at the game
---
You think "tunneling" is written in the killer's guide to DBD? No, it's Reddit's rule on how to play killer and what shouldn't be expected.
---
I was about to say that lol
---
I've never even gotten one out of a bloodweb. It's a meme for my friends now.
---
another benefit of selfcare is being able to get out of dream state from freddy
---
No no,  its not pedeophillia, its necrophillia!
---
I also played with a baby Dwight like 2 days ago. That nurse was so bad she couldn't get anyone else. I BT'ed Dwight, toke a hit for him and then did a gen literally at the center of the loop they were running around while injured but the nurse was still going after Dwight. I kept making notifications when we got the gate open. I personally think all camping/tunneling killers deserve to be BM'ed.
---
I'm glad those are the two survivor perks because I just bought them for the bp
---
That’s a little knife. 🔪
---
8 for both
---
Loss really brings the worst out of some people wow.
---
Some of us don't have to compensate ;)
---
Nah, in all seriousness, I'm definitely hoping to invest in a more accurate prop, just waiting for it to be put up for sale
---
Both 😷😰😂
---
Bruh that's gayer than gey
---
That's actually exactly what happened! As part of the performance, she stabbed me in the neck with a knitting needle prop!
---
Middle one is definitely a Nea.
---
Can’t wait to see, you two should get a photo shoot happening. Would love to see some edited professional photos.
---
Against basement bubba if he manages to down someone instantly, the game will last 3 min the game is over in no time and the survivors who escape get 10k bp, plus when you get to high ranks you'll see basement bubba less % times than the chances of kobe, and gen protector doc gets easier the better at the game you get
---
It'd be pretty fun! Unfortunately we were rushed for time, but we'll probably try for more professional photos next time!
---
Hey now that's not an accepting attitude is it? Now brush yourself off and have some fun with the game and learn
---
Can't tell if you're joking or not
---
Bloodhunt doesn't start until May 2nd my dude.

---
She doesn't have reliable counterplay, many situations are more or less a coinflip, some are basically impossible to counter (injured without Iron Will so she can hear you, has specific add-ons, there's no safe-enough window/pallet), and on top of that she has good mobility. Since she does have more counterplay, and since her ability can also work against herself, she is not an overpowered design like Nurse, or broken like Legion, but she is definitely up there.
---
She was a very different character in the PTB, and after release also received a variety of buffs. Some of her add-ons need rebalancing, and in-phase collision needs to be removed.
---
Just earlier I felt like screwing around so i ran around and started throwing pallets down everywhere and the killer kept looking for me and eventually gave up lol I laughed pretty hard
---
Remember it is stated all characters are 18,at least.
---
I ain't. Just saying don't take the game super seriously and do your best to enjoy it despite whatever anyone else tries to do to stop you.
---
How nice he's taking a selfie
---
Better watch out for his...
---
ENOUGH!
---
So just being toxic
---
How dare you?! You’re comparing a minor event to one that actually happens on a daily basis, you’re disgusting and I hope you never get close to a Dwight in your life.
---
I'd use this modpack.
---
Not sure whats going on is there no way around?
---
I would love to! I'll Che k it out later :)
---
They Point at you and say “Camper”
---
I’ve had this before said about me and it’s only been once, since I run a clean game and don’t camp, I like to catch these guys and pull them off of gens with my Shirtless Myers. Told them whatever and how was I camping since I was running hex devour hope and got my 5 stacks with a good totem placement and your all pissed because 3 of you got moried from it and then the last guy almost got the hatch but I grabbed him at the window.
---
Relax, im not shitting on the game, i've been enjoying it for the past couple months. I do usually move on after a match, but when everything that i listed happens to me, i dont learn much
---
sprwaith
---
Thanks and let me know how you like it
---
The bish has toilet paper wrapped around her ass and tits. What did you expect?
---
I think that was meant for survivors. But please show me where, cause then i wouldn't dread parts of the community anymore 😂😁
---
And people said that meme quality has gone down 🤦‍♂️
---
Then you remember your cheating on him
---
I play on ps4, my brother always asks me "how the fuck can't this game run on 60fps? This looks like minecraft with a few extra steps!"
---
He doesn't actually say that but he says something among the lines
---
Anyone who tells someone else to kill themselves over a video game should practice what they preach.
---
😂😂😂😂😂 i mean, yeah but still come on peeps, she's underage
---
Only thing you need to know:
---
Fookin Dead 'Ard!
---
Who gives a shit? OP doesn't need your approval to play what they want.
---
Entity calls the shots, not the devs
---
Basically.
---
Every game succs at matchmaking....
---
I remember the devs saying that everyone in the entity realm is 18+, if rin is actually 15 then hell, it's not just pedophilia it's also necrophilia
---
She's also dead, so necrophilia overrides it. No worries, safe to hit it.
---
I think all of the legion members are 18
---
I just wish you'd consistently get tokens for taking hits. 
---
I'm curious as to what the game considers taking a hit, when both survivors are being chased and the protector is healthy and the other injured?
---
There is obviously a very specific set of rules because just popping in front of a killer to take a hit doesn't give me points or tokens, more often than not.
---
In a dev stream I believe. Plus think about this, if they are not all 18 it would be an AO game and could not be on Steam.
---
Nurse and Billy are debatably the most balanced killers in the game from a kit perspective as they can apply a lot of pressure fairly with a high skillcap with errors costing them pretty hard.  The issue is that both Nurse and Billy are basically the only ones with that power with only say Spirit being similar on that level.  We can argue though that some of their add-ons are busted or at least busted when stacked but the perks for both are kinda bad with the exception of Enduring if you eat pallets \[Why would you, you can kinda just stop early to avoid getting stunned\] or Nurse's Calling \[Which is both bad and good based on luck\] with just their base power being mostly fair.
---
Ruin and NOED are busted though but they are basically the only actual leverage shit killers have on survivors.  Trapper is dead in the water if you aren't running bags and at least one of those perks because your chances of a 4K are so much lower without one of those two.
---
Obama seems fitting
---
&gt; Those are super generic terms though. 
---
Well, yes. I like to keep it short when I talk to people on Reddit, most of the time people never reads a wall of text. But, I have to give it to you for putting all that time and effort to ask me for details.
---
Before I start, I am a killer who gives everyone a fair chance, but Im also a killer who doesnt waste time walking to the other side of the map to a place where nobody is just to let people go and be super safe so I can lose a gen every hook i get. 
---
&gt; When you say you don't camp, obviously you're not maintaining eye contact with the hooked person, but does that mean you go to the other side of the map? Do you patrol \~32 meters out? If you spot someone running towards the hook, do you move to intercept them? If so, do you let them unhook first or try to kill them before they get there? Do you move towards a hook (from whatever distance) once you get the notification or will you look for someone completely fresh? 
---
I will put up a scenario to illustrate: Let's say I face 4 survivors who plays the game like a normal person, do the objective and help your teammates to the best of their ability without being a total dick. A fair match. 
---
Ok, so I down survivor 1, I pick him up and hooks him. I check my BBQ to see where people are  and base my next from move that. If I see 1 survivor doing a gen and the others 2 is too close, i will head to the one I saw  from BBQ. If I dont see anyone I will just go for a gen patrol to see if I can find anyone. If someone unhooks survivor 1 and Im not in a chase, I will head back and try to find the survivor who went for the save. I will also note that I will never give anyone a free unhook, if they cannot wait for me to leave the hook and they have to run in asap, i will intercept it but I wont wait for a grab, i will simple M1 him once and one more time if he goes for the save. People has to be punished for making bad decisions so they can learn from it. Just as it is for killers making bad choices and loses the game. 
---
&gt; For tunneling, do you refuse to hook anyone a second time before you've hooked everyone once? Same idea, but just don't death hook until everybody has been hooked at least once? At least twice? What if you hook survivor A and they're rescued by B. So you chase B for a while and eventually hook them. They're rescued by A again. Do you chain alternating hooks until A and B are both dead but you haven't even seen D and C is still on first hook? 
---
I dont mind hooking a survivor 2 times in a row, but I rather not do it if its early in the game. The only time I will do it in a fair match is if he made a poor choice. Like going right to the gen next to the hook he just hung on or something. But I might also just run by him because I simply cant bother with 5 gens up. As the game progresses I have no problem death hooking people once the game starts coming to an end. My first main goal in every game is to get my 4 stack BBQ without getting someone twice, but immersive players can make this difficult and boring to say the least. 
---
&gt; How do you play it if the freshly unhooked person runs right into you? Assuming you let them go and try to find the unhooker instead, what do you do if you can't find them? What if the injured/unhooked person runs into you AGAIN 45 seconds later? Where is your threshold for when it's okay to hit that person again? Do you just leave the area entirely if you can't find the unhooker and hope there's somebody else on the other side of the map? What if there isn't but the other 3 survivors are super immersed and it's just that 1 person who wants to play tag? 
---
As for this, if he runs into me again 45 seconds later I might just M1 him again. At that point I feel like its more his fault than me being a tunneler. Giving people a new chance after another just ends up me losing the game.
---
Most of my games is very situational though. For example, sometimes due to the great matchmaking of DBD I end up with low ranked survivors and I can easily tell that they arent very good. These games I Just hook everyone once and just m1 slaps them here and there and giving them some short chases. Then I let them all go.
---
Another example which happens way too often is 2 people being swf and sandbagging / farming the other two. These games I just kill the two people ruining the game and letting the other two escape.
---
I hope i answered your questions and it wasnt too hard to understand, as my English is not that great.
---
***Those were my beans.***
---
[THOSE WERE MY FUCKING BEANS !](/intensifies)
---
I really wish, I remember when I was just starting to play killer. I watched all his dbd casefile videos and they were soo helpful and entertaining. Wish he'd make ones for spirit, legion and plague but oh well
---
Wait no, stop thats not how that works 😰😂
---
My frust game was against a rank 1 trapper on Haddonfield, I dropped the game for about 1 month
---
"AO"? Whats that mean? Okie dokie. I'll see if i can find it though.
---
That would be possible with dedicated servers and it's something we would like to do down the line, although it's not something that's in this first test.
---
Yeah, no joke. But, ill see if i can find that 😁
---
well im pretty close to her age so i dont count
---
Jesus fucking Christ 
---
p.s. could you do Amanda? Or is there  nothing underneath her mask?
---
Because of how slow it is. It’s useless against the two most recent killers and Sloppy Butcher with Thanat seems to be the meta atm. Pharmacy is overall better if you want to use a perk for self healing.
---
You currently depip if you DC, right? Am I mistaken?
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/496/Overly_attached_GF.jpg
---
What is "pretty close"? 😂😂😂
---
When I was much more active (haven't played in 2 years but started back up recently) I'd always let people like you escape because there's just no fun in killing one to two people in a setup like that. With three I'd still play normally but be more forgiving, like not hooking a third time unless they are super toxic.
---
The game is supposed to be fun and I don't see the point in being a tryhard or super salty.
---
Lol why else someone literally hook someone and just stand there in front of them?
---
Camping and facecamping are 2 different things. But ok buddy
---
I actually had it happen to me last week, which surprised me because I swore they fixed it.
---
Someone else already did here: https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7uux9p/amanda_face_reveal_rendered_in_blender/

Means "Adults Only" which for a game like this, to have minors in it, would most likely be rated as such. Steam doesn't allow AO games, not to mention the fact that the devs did say (as was mentioned many times already) that all characters are at least 18. I do call bullshit on this though, and think the devs just claim it to keep their game at its present rating.
---
It's true they're at it's mercy
---
Thank you. Good to know she has an actual face. Poor Mikey
---
This sub is great at using memes incorrectly
---
Dunno where you're getting that age, but according to her backstory on the store page and wiki she went to a university, which makes her, like, at least 18-19 if I'm not mistaken. Unless it says somewhere else she's 15, but she doesn't really look that age either. 🤷
---
Adults Only.
---
I keep trying to post the recipe but my comments keep getting removed.
---
===The Recipe===
---
• 2 oz (60ml) tequila blanco
---
• .50 oz (15ml) raspberry simple syrup
---
• .50 oz (15ml) Cointreau
---
• .50 oz (15ml) lime juice
---
Add all ingredients to a shaker filled with ice. Shake thoroughly to chill. Garnish with some raspberries. Strain into your chilled vessel. Serve!
---
I watch monto, farmer John, hybridpanda and Scottjund. Monto is really entertaining and very good at killer and survivor. I learned a lot from him and really enjoy his content, farmer John is really funny and although he does not have many videos, they are really cool. Hybridpanda is very good for people who are getting into dead by daylight and is the perfect example of how the community should be. He's super nice, not toxic and just all around wholesome. Scott is really informative and I like his objective look at the game
---
Because after the 5 gens are done there is no reason not to leave the hooked person, unless you use end game perks like Bloodwarden or if you know exactly where the other survivors are and can get to them before they escape. But usually they are waiting until you leave the hooked person behind to save them or are waiting at the exit gate to t-bag. Not really good reasons to leave the hooked person behind huh buddy?
---
Stop?! Too late :l Spirits' above all else &lt;3 I keep her as my killer just to see dem cheeks every time I load in ;)
---
Mate if it is bleeding...you have great lube.
---
Yeah so he can t bag if he wants to too.
---
Wasn't she studying in Takamatsu University though?
---
No what's worse? When you get back to back 3 o'clock ruin skill checks 5 times in a row.
---
Peer to peer winds up used interchangeably at times but it's supposed to be when there is no host; you are just among peers. Essentially in vidya garmez it's just "Okay everyone told me these are the facts, I'll line them up with my facts and decide what the facts are now", which adds overhead of synchronising the facts, e.g. the Doctor says he hit Meg during her window vault, Meg says she was already through the window, you need to decide who to believe. Hosted games, be it listen (play + host) or dedicated (just host, no play) would decide on their end.
---
The most obvious indicator for DBD that it's hosted by one player, is that the chat disconnects when the killer DCs, not when any survivor does. That and survivors rubber band due to poor connection, killers don't.
---
If you just wait for the players to hand in their connection information for the match, you'd come up with the same result, killer says survivor 1 dropped their connection, survivors 2-4 say the same, survivor 1 says killer dropped their connection, there'd not be much more to know if the same happened with the server.
---
Dedicated servers will hopefully help with hit detection, or at least I'll be able to get through a window *on my end* and not be stabbed more than once in a blue moon, I'm just waiting to see if they meant
---
&gt;Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give a better environment and tools to manage disconnections and to improve hit registrations. A multidisciplinary team is working on both features, but they will not be ready for the launch.
---
launch of the test servers or launch launch, since the servers don't seem to be doing thaaat great right now.
---
How about ‘Not Playing because you are a big scaredy cat and can’t handle getting frightened by pixels’
---
Ahhh okay
---
We will always have people who "take revenge on toxic players" while they are just tilted themselfs and think that the otherside is toxic.
---
So to "get revenge" they spoil the movie to innocent players.
---
I think I'm going to have to bring the pope himself to cast some exorcism on you
---
Dude you and your girlfriend dress up and go to cosplay events. You really can't call anyone else a joke.
---
by at least 2 years
---
Okay, thats not bad lol carry on
---
Except you act like face camping only happens when 5 gens are done and when the gates are opened, when that obviously isn’t true. In fact that rarely happens.
---
Clearly in that scenario it makes sense.
---
Pretty impossible
---
Oh my gosh 😂😂😂
---
I mean, I do it because I enjoy it, and apparently, I'm pretty good at it.
---
Hey, could be worse, I could go on the internet and try to bring others down without precedent.
---
Have you even tried lol?
---
What did generators ever do to you?
---
I swear i read it in her lore, but ill go back and check
---
It’s a lot less frustrating in comparison
---
You have to get it on one of their bloodwebs and unlock it there first.
---
Bond lets you know where people are, it doesn't make you stay near them or anything like that.
---
Who gives af? It's a video game character
---
So if I got the perk for Dwight on his bloodweb I would have to wait for it to pop up on let’s say Megs
---
I actually did that, some weird ass looking jake kept trying to waste my time, I did manage to kill him and get my 4 stacks of BBQ (gotta get dem bloodpoints), but 2 other survivors escaped, he was talkin trash so I spoiled it by saying (spoiler ahead) &gt;!Iron man, black widow and Thanos die in Endgame!&lt; and boi he got MAD.
---
Great song choice. Also, I really need to get gud with doing 360's on ps4. You make it look easy.
---
bond has many more upsides
---
it lets you know where exactly the killer is when you see someone freshly injured running around through the wall.
---
it lets you know if someone's going for the save already so you're wasting much less time
---
you actually can go on and on about why bond is so good
---
Some people might kill me for this.... But I honestly think that honing stone should be baseline. I can't tell you how many times I trap someone across the map and he just gets out first try as if nothing happened. I run honing stone a lot purely because of that. He should at least start with all of his traps, or pick up traps from lockers like huntress or something. Anything to buff trappy boi
---
playing basement bubba at high ranks will derank you, his play style works against what the pip requirements are so If the survivors are competent the killer will depip
---
And if you don't like playing against this and that and want to play 70% of the game then It will not be for you once the dedicated servers come, just find a game that you are willing to play
---
I subbed man, you are off to a great start and I can't wait to see more!
---
Yes
---
Someone did this to me for GoT on PS4 cuz i have a GoT House Crest as my avatar (PSN gave em out along with a Dragon Theme for the premiere)
---
I have never seen an episode of GoT in my life and i feel bad that i made him salty and made him type out a paragraph on a controller only for me to not care
---
So he needs every perk to do a build? And he couldn’t improvise why?
---
Christ, someone's pissy.
---
It's not really an opinion to try to say "Haha ur short" especially when it's evidently not true.
---
It takes me a couple of seconds to respond to comments, it's hardly insecurity to wonder why someone would act like such a plonker without reason.
---
I see you can use Google. The Merriam Webster Dictionary, which is widely accepted, also states that "precedent" can mean "something done or said that may serve as an example or rule to authorize or justify a subsequent act of the same or an analogous kind"
---
I was referring to the original commenter when I referred to there being no precedent, but I guess if the shoe fits, wear it.
---
Considering nobody else here has decided to act like a prat, I don't think your last statement really applies, and if you actually read the rest of the comments on the post, you'd see that criticism is fine by me so long as it's constructive.
---
o  o  f
---
What if I want to slap her instead ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Looks like he already snapped,I rarely get games where someone doesn’t dc.
---
Obviously you do since you took the time out of your day to go and leave a comment on the post :)
---
Oof RIP
---
Then you don’t have to go as far for the slappin
---
And then you get disconnected.
---
I actually really like it, gives a genuine atmosphere of dread and hopelessness
---
Perhaps, as it actually means that other players have to be worried. It still doesn't make him very good.
---
We are the Legion with a frenzy attack
---
We just want friends please love us back :,(
---
All I want is for them to rework her character model. She looks hideous
---
Probably because Ash is loud AS FUCK, reminds me of Kate 1.0 PTB, so there\`s no way the killer could hear you. And, well, he also couldn't see you because of the camo.
---
she was in college studying teaching she could not under any circumstance be 15
---
You know what's more painful? Getting everything Max but not Brutality (I was literally 100 points away)
---
**too bad**
---
how am i meant to know it’s a joke lmao i don’t watch tru3
---
I flail my arms as a way to say get me now. Right now. Thats what everyone does that I play with. Im on ps4. If that changes anything.
---
I main Myers
---
Omfg really? 😁 Laurie's specialty
---
Thankfully the tip was foam! 😅
---
alright stop calling me out
---
Ion like claudettes
---
Do you have any tips for Trapper? I wanna play Trapper but since people tell me he's trash, I wanna play correctly
---
well to be fair,, no one really knows what he looks like under the mask
---
Happens to me way too often. It sucks cause it means you got 11 hooks instead of the max of 12, because the survivors allowed one of their teammates to go into struggle.
---
I guess I shouldn't be greedy.
---
you absolutely don't have to play her or even survivor at all to get the teachable
---
Thanks for the feedback. You pointed out the biggest flaws I had with the videos myself. Im actually not sure how to make the transitions between songs work between each clip which is why I didnt put any. Could you take a look at my second video? I tried to make an outro but it still feels very mediocre. I will take a look at those two videos you mentioned and try to apply it to my own videos. Thanks again!
---
This seems a bit extreme, but I wouldn’t mind a survivor perk that slows down entity progression by like 50% or something if a killer remains within a certain radius of the hook
---
Lol!
---
Spotted the Killer Main.
---
They pop. A lot.
---
I looked it up. It is actually 92%. I'd like 100% for it then.
---
Yes.
---
-"Insult someone"  -"insulted person respond back" - D:
---
HAhaa it was just a joke that I called you a fat ass btw
---
Well when it's shit opinions that doesn't contribute at all like yours might as well keep it to yourself
---
fuck I’m a dumbass. i was thinking about how we never hear him talk, because he never does.
---
I think just having more options, like right now you can get thier bloodweb to that level to get it. Keep that but add more options, like playing this character for x amount of times or something.
---
Ah, yes, the cultured man's tactic.
---
he doesn't need every perk to do a build. but when you switch out insidious for iron grasp, your build goes from "hook in basement" to "down one person and camp them in the basement"
---
if you deny this im sorry but you are delusional. insidious is literally a camping perk. it doesn't even activate if youre not camping
---
no he doesn't, just like i don't need your approval to call him a cunt for being a cunt
---
It makes it take a lot longer for survivors to heal, making perks like self-care borderline unusable.
---
It also has synergy with other perks like Nurse's Calling and Bloodhound (although who uses bloodhound anymore, especially with the Legion changes coming?)
---
Lmao I love it
---
You have helped me more than you think. I will put the advice to good use. Thanks again!
---
enduring and bamboozle
---
I had a game today got to the last survivor alive after a 15 min game, "I'm not the best killer" and soon as I hooked them they DC, why lose out on the blood points after 15-20 min in a game, it's a grind as it is!!
---
Only if you exit the game. If you plug pull, you'll at least safety pip, keep the bloodpoints you've earned, and if you have an item, keep it, even if you're on the hook.
---
but she is like 25 naturally, so its not pedophile at all
---
Monitor and Abuse
---
Well they obviously didnt give much of a shit considering the fact that it took them 5 fucking months to do it.
---
Bruh you confuzed mask with shirt
---
Not entirely sure how deleting it would work, since it's literally only been posted once lmao.
---
I mean, I'm pointing it out because I personally find it pathetic, just as you believe my hobby to be pathetic. I don't really understand what makes you think I'm ashamed of anything, and I'd love for you to find anywhere where I've insulted anyone, beyond pointing out how insecure someone must be to try to hurl pointless insults on the internet.
---
For the last time, I have no issue with anyone disagreeing with me. What I find pathetic is talking shit for no reason. Calling someone a manlet literally provides nothing to the conversation. You claim I've attacked everyone, yet I only seem to have to deal with you, and the guy who called me a manlet. 
---
You seem to have far too much personal investment in this conversation, bud. I looked at your comment history out of pure curiosity, especially since you seem far too comfortable insulting others, it's hardly my fault what ends up in your history. I really think you're overestimating how much effort it takes to look at comment history. Either that, or you're willfully ignorant.
---
I'm gonna drop this debate since it's getting boring, and I'd rather do something more fun. I'd love to say that this has been a fun debate, but it seems all that you can do is regurgitate the same arguments and set up straw man points whenever that fails. Take care, bud.
---
i really wanna see the most underused perk and the most perk used by survivors who end up escaping
---
It irritates me that the first perks goes from 10 to 15 to 25 instead of 15 to 20 to 25. Other than that it seems good.
---
I would love to see some of the more specific, nitty gritty stuff: the success or failure rate for RBT's, win rates at what ranks for what killers, if certain survivors have a higher rate of DC's or wins, number of pallets destroyed by x versus y, etc. Stuff that would help for practical gameplay.
---
Sloppy Butcher has synergy with Nurse's Calling, because it takes survivors longer to heal, making it easier for you to interrupt them, and it has synergy with Bloodhound because Sloppy causes them to bleed more and Bloodhound makes the blood more visible. Synergistic perks are ones that have bonuses that make the bonuses of other perks better, like Spirit Fury and Enduring.
---
The real challenge is connecting to a game
---
Haha nice, enjoy seeing your posts man :)
---
C'mon man. Cant we go one day without shitting on Legion when there's a humble and funny post?
---
I am glad to be of service.
---
Its overrated on most killers if you are versing good survivors. 
---
 Good survivors wont bother to heal if you have it, they'll just do gens and heal with Adrenaline. Best killers to run it are Nurse, Freddy, Hag and Wraith, but put it on any killer if you come across a Squadette, they will self care through it anyway.
---
Bad Post OP
---
Make your choice. I love this perk for multiple reasons:
---
\-It has counter play
---
\-It rewards me for not tunneling and/or camping
---
\-Biggest Saw fan her
---
\-It is from Pig so it is good.
---
My two friends and I all had it happen over the last two weeks. It was hilarious. We let the one who did see the killer on the hook. Was fun xD
---
No. You cant move around the killer. If they hit you, then their collision is temporarily removed and you can run through them. But if the killer just stands there you cant move past.
---
Freddy rework leaked?!
---
First one is good, seems like something the devs would add themselves
---
The second perk, if it was ever added, would get a LOT of hate. You are basically hindering yourself (and consequently your team) for a selfish reason (Bloodpoints). I think its a great idea personally (mainly bc I main killer and only play survivor in a squad), but would hate to get a squad of fragiles when queing solo.
---
Third perk is another nice idea, although I would probably hate playing against it as killer since I hate immersion.
---
I'm not so sure it could be tracked but I wish there was a way to know what % of players cannot hit overcharge skillchecks.
---
Graham's number &lt; Rayo's number &lt; DbDTeabag number
---
So wonderful.
---
We have very different definitions of Misery. I think It'd be fun to be in the realm of the entity, At least for a short while. IIRC they don't actually die, they just wake up by the campfire again right?
---
myers is over 18 tho 👀
---
I was playing kyf with one of my frends playing tombstone michael and one of my other frends was saying lets make a deal while standing their staring at the michael.
---
Each killer has their own variation of the classic theme, it’s not much different except that it sounds more “screechy” and high pitched.
---
What data you want to see this is for, not for suggestions devs will thankfully ignore
---
curtain call had the best music imo
---
A while ago, but I just saw it today. It's coming out Fall 2019 I guess.
---
mrs myers, hello
---
What am I missing?
---
Can you link the normal main menu theme, the one in between chapters? I would love to hear it.
---
Legitimately if he set down "traps" that slow survivors he could actually be good
---
It really depends for me. I kind of let the items influence my style of play most times. If I find a toolbox and there's no other chests or survivors around, I do gens. If I find a flashlight, I'll do gens but I'll intervene in a nearby chase. If I find a map, I scout and hand it off or keep it. If I find a health kit, I use it, OR I'll give it to someone so they can self heal while I work on a gen. If I find a key, I hand on to that. If I find multiple keys, I hand them out.   
---
Then I find multiples, I hand out the item I'm least likely to use and keep the favored item, usually the key.
---
I found the model here: https://www.models-resource.com/pc_computer/deadbydaylight/model/18845/
---
Just a warning, I'm not sure if it's just the person who uploaded the file or if it's just how DBD's models are made, but this model is freaking *enormous* and is also rotated to face downwards when you import it into blender.
---
She does 😏
---
A lot of DBD survivors and killers with noed are 12 years old, so at least 50% of players are safe.
---
I mean the other way. I dont think I have seen a dead end before.
---
thanks so much. i will look at it when i get home
---
Freddy is a terrible idea with sloppy, gives bonus chances to get a skillcheck.
---
What if there was a killer in which when you hook someone, the survivor controls you for some time, and if they don't down anyone through you then they get moried
---
My playtime with killers and survivors
---
Shes standing at the only exit. Its like a little hidding spot. They are on jungle gyms in coldwind.
---
I read all of these comments and you’re dead set on you know you did 2 and your friend did 3.  Do you know how many times we all counted totems and we thought we countered NOED?  
---
Someone miss counted. It HAPPENS. One could have been on a totem, killer came, you got off but thought you broke it. 
---
Also, I read you went against clown. He has an add on if he hits you directly with his bottle you’re a one shot. 
---
It wasn’t cheating so why are you being so closed minded?
---
She laughing... lol
---
After 2 minutes, you lose 2 perks ( Ruin and Corrupt Intervention ) and Discordance and Overcharge barely make a difference at rank 1.
---
It used to be meta, but people learnes that once you can tell the killer has it just don't heal in the terror radius and it's useless
---
Id say claud.
---
I thought you already tested that, oh wait you made the data up instead
---
Lol, that is hilarious
---
Excited laughter 😏
---
Speaking from experience, I always remove mine at the 4th one
---
I never thought people would actually sexualize her(of course I underestimated the internet). I mean she's scary and creepy looking. Im bisexual and never thought of her that way but I do think huntress is hot lol.
---
Yes they do, and while they dream, the blood webs appear in their dreams, and when they wake up, they have the things they drempt about :) I wouldn't mind a night or two with the entity but I'm not really looking to start a serious commitment, like all of eternity :/
---
Devour hope. If you get a good spot, the game can be over with only 9 downs instead of 12.
---
Don't tell me how I "should" play a game I paid 30e for. If I wanna play a noed, insidious nurse hiding behind the exit gate, I'll play that shit regardless of how unfun it might be.
---
&gt;back
---
Honestly they need to be removed. Its a little box that the hex can spawn in, the idea is if you risk going for it and the killer sees you they basically get a guaranteed down on you. Its a good idea, but I've seen players accidentally body block each other in there more times than you'd expect, and it really doesn't add anything to the game or make sense
---
How about personal records for our accounts? Like, hours played in total, hours as Survivor/Killer, and then make them all public so we can scrutinize people who try to make Survivor vs Killer balance arguments.
---
Considering all you have to do to counter DS is slug and camp the downed Survivior, it's not a good anti tunnel perk

Hey wana see a magic trick?*searching through ai*
---
They may want to stay at their rank. 
---
I've come to recognize a few people who will DC at the end of the match, even if gates are opened, so they don't rank up and I've started dodging them because of it. 
---
It sucks when you're the last two, you're on hook and they DC to avoid pipping.
---
I think the second one would need a little adjusting, at least with the timer. Like testing to find a balance, but other then that I like the perks and they seems balanced.
---
legion dies in endgame
---
I thought getting hit through pallet drops was just a normal thing since the vacuum removal. Not an aspect of dedicated servers.
---
Makes sense dude lol
---
This actually is true
---
I still only understood half of it. XD
---
Bbq was just in the shrine last week and it’s only ever been in the shrine twice so your best bet is to level up leatherface and buy nurses this week
---
Still better than Legion

The life and times of Megan
---
If you as a killer get looped for 5 gens you don't deserve any kills at all so...
---
I really hope that it gets hammered into shape so everyone can have stable gameplay.
---
Something I would like to see is how common certain perks are on blood webs early on for both killer and survivor. 
---
I guess its going to depend on what DLC/teachables you have but would still be interesting to know.
---
But it only counters it by adding 10% for each person. 
---
So the figures change to 100%, 200%, 270%, 320%
---
Well, he's your basic M1 killer, with a twist of being able to anti-loop somewhat using traps, and he's able to guard totems and gens quite well if needed.
---
Ruin is excellent on him, as he can generally trap the totem and give enough time to get momentum.
---
Think like a survivor when you place traps is probably the best advice - place traps where you know survivors tend to look behind them, or where they tend to move when they hear your terror radius, but places that are generally not expected.  Survivors expect choke points to be trapped - pallets, windows, jungle gyms, shack.  But placing on corners in deep grass around shack, a couple steps from corner, or a few steps back from a generator behind cover, these are good places to trap that will catch many off guard.
---
The other key play component to trapper is generator placement and keeping strategic gens safe - barring excellent starting momentum, you will eventually get down to three gens.  If you use traps and pressure to force them to 3-gen themselves, then in many cases you can cover 2 of the gens with a couple traps, making it nearly impossible for them to stay on them, and ultimately winning you the match.
---
I get gen jumped. One pops so I run to it then another behind me goes boom. Then another and another. These gens hang around on the streets waiting for killers like me to walk pass.
---
Fucking killer mains camping the exit gate. Why play so scummy? /s
---
Someone already did that with 500 traps. The post highly hinted that every box has a 50% chance to free you, except the last which has 100%. Yea, every single box is a coinflip and that is stupid
---
I don't know their punishment policy on DCs.
---
If LF is facecamping you could send that data too since the game already records if you're too close for the chase emblem is it?
---
Ok but the crapper's power should be real.
---
I say yes to the first and third, no to fragile.
---
I want this version of Iron Will lol
---
I understood that reference.
---
Good luck when the killers start to Dc before you :)
---
That's a lot to take in but I appreciate it, sadly I don't have Ruin. Considering it's a pay to win perk
---
Yeah, I don't get that mindset. If I brought a mori and the survivors happened to burn bps I'd still try to max points as much as possible, but would hope they understand I'd like to at least mori one of them... I mean, they'd still get a lot of points despite that and I mainly bring moris for the animation. It's fun every 50 games or so.
---
Maybe the entity is a dominant in this relationship idk
---
I can hear this
---
I had this happen to me the other day so I just tried to Kobe and I hit it lol
---
I didn’t get selfcare on my David until after 108 bloodwebs ;-;
---
Ruin is not pay to win.  You can acquire most of the killers through free blood shards rewarded for leveling up (9000 each), or if you don't want to acquire Hag, you can get it through the weekly shrine for 2000 blood shards.
---
It's funny though when I play spirit I get far more dcs before the game even loads. And I dont use moris. I play a top tier killer but I try to play as fair and fun as possible. I dont use ruin or noed. It's almost like when you play reasonably fair people stay in your game.
---
Just yesterday I had a daily to chainsaw 3 people as Billy, so I slapped on the thing that doesn't down but gives bonus bloodpoints and just kind of waited.
---
Last guy to join's name was "I want some Mori" or something like that, so I took off the bloodpoint thing, took off the bonus Devious offering, and slapped on the green Mori offering.
---
Ended up getting him 2 minutes in and spent the rest of the game dragging people I'd downed to hooks and just dropping them off on the floor. They thought I had a Mori daily.
---
i never get tired of these lol
---
Could you do one for the overly attached gf, as well as the "he's thinking about other girls?"
---
Is that shadowborn or lightborn?
---
Honestly, fuck people like this spirit. Toxic ass players that make the whole playerbase hate each other. As a killer main myself, when I see killers do stuff like this it's sad. Anyone who hold the game hostage truly has nothing better to do other than sit in their room all day.
---
The survivor you protect needs to be injured and the chase triggered on them first
---
If anyone is concerned about Bond's short radius, they should try Empathy instead (which I find better as I don't care to know a full health team mates location, I care to see where they are if they are hurtin and comin my way). 
---
I also think Empathy is better as I see a lot of Plagues and Legions where people don't bother healing so you can see them at all times.
---
You can't assign selfishness like that.
---
If I play three games, with one of them having someone not load in and so I'm kind enough to farm with the survivors, and a second one where two guys DC (Because I somehow pull a dude off a generator as the Trapper) and am kind enough to farm again.....
---
Yeah, that third game it could be 10 BPS and I'm still going hardball so I can have an actual game for the night. Sorry, not sorry.
---
He doesn't have TotH in his build.
---
i would honestly like to see the % of Nurses compared to other killers at red ranks. because i think this stat alone make a pretty damn good argument on why she needs a rework. if there's a killer who completely obliterates everyone whereas others don't, that's a sign shes completely over powered and unbalanced. on my end it feels like way over 90% of the games are nurses..
---
I watch Frip Frop, and Ussilys a lot
---
killer rank that is killer specific. I'm great at Spirit and Hag but that doesn't mean i'm great at Billy or Clown. I think killers should be ranked separately
---
I can honestly not tell if your being sarcastic or not
---
So it’s a bad thing that we wait for you guys at the gate now? There’s 2 gates. If the killer is it at one of them, go to the other. Hell every time the killer comes just hide and wait for them to go away. Thought survivors weren’t this winey anymore
---
Anything that decreases wind up time, it gives survivors less time to react.
---
she isnt tho
---
How hitboxes are going to be fixed
---
what a friendly looking man

If you want to be toxic af there’s only one setup that I could recommend irredesant head and military belt

whats wrong with it? just getting back in after a long break

---
Michael, I've come to bargain
---
Can’t agree more
---
&gt; This will make less people DC because they want to keep their rank
---
Actually with the way DC's currently work you actually keep your rank if you dc. If people have a bad game and they die early they just dc to avoid ranking down.
---
People doesn't play survivors.
---
*their
---
How did the game end (If it did, and you stayed to see)
---
why is this so fucking relatable
---
haha get it because shes invisible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

? you don’t deserve to pip with 8k lmao

Every time you teabag at a pallet a puppy is euthenized by peta

---
What's so bad about the Pig nerf? Literally, the only people it truly affects are people who try and play for the endgame Pig where the survivor has no counterplay.
---
In my eyes, if you as a Pig only get a trap on a person at the end of the game then you did not deserve the kill. How do you manage to play any other killer? Pig is 115 like the majority of the roster and her dash ability can be really useful on unsafe spots, this makes her even better to catch people sometimes.
---
The traps are really useful for slowing the game down, just trap early? She's one of the few killers I don't feel the need of using Ruin on because of her ability.
---
How would you count wins as killer? Is it just every time you kill all 4 survivors?
---
That’s why you add rank rewards
---
Would [this guy](https://imgur.com/KaLL9M9) ever do you wrong?
---
put on whispers and when it lights up just vomit wildly in a circle aiming up surely you'll hit something right? lol as for real tips idk don't focus one guy and try to infect as many as you can before choosing someone to chase. they will all either be broken by the time you come for them or they will give you your corrupt purge for free while you chase someone else
---
Most? Currently I've been on for an hr now and literally every game but 3 or 4 of them, somebody crashed in the loading screen. Survs have to put up with so many 3v1 games from the start that I'm sure it only infuriates them more causing even more rage quits. 
---
Game is so broken right now on every single level. Lmao I just crashed in the loading screen... JUST NOW. 
---
Due to frustration surrounding playing surv I tried playing more killer and I swear more than half my games only 3 people or less load in. Game is unplayable!! I'd love a casual mode and ranked mode without the OP add ons and such. But everyone thinks there aren't enough players to split up. (I completely disagree.)
---
That's 18K my guy lol
---
[https://twitter.com/vega\_mao](https://twitter.com/vega_mao) this is the cosplayer
---
Really? 20 mins of afk killer and only 1 gen is done? What kind of an immersed squadette are you playing with
---
Have you never heard of Basement Bubba? People run 2 version believe it or not first (the more common one) is to just hook them in the basement the 2nd (yes it’s real) is to hook someone then camp them in the basement and so what if he did the second? Still counts as basement Bubba to me
---
oh, the blur and reflection makes it look like 8k
---
anyway, i’ve gotten like 27k and safety pipped before yikes
---
lol justice was served
---
yea, thanks for pointing that out, never worked on a gen with more than one other person to really test it out
---
With the new patch you’ll be able to hear all the killer themes depending on who you play as!
---
Agitation, unnerving, surveillance/TOTH with Ruin, Overcharge
---
Yeeeere
---
How did the gate get blocked without blood warden?
---
Use monitor&amp;abuse to be able to get really close to the survivors and then puke on them, if you use the right add-ons they'll be broken almost instantly. Don't hold your puke cause you'll become really slow (hence easy to loop), basically like a huntress with charged hatchets.
---
Waterlogged shoe hag: *cries*
---
Good to see you back!
---
Yeah? After 1000 hours and so many bad games I don´t care anymore. It´s a great game but I don´t wanna be their toy
---
Wow, they gave Freddy the old Wraith re-work.
---
daddy myers
---
Should be the other way around tbh
---
I get you. Let´s hope it gets better in the future
---
Thanks man I really appreciate it
---
fucking ninja clown
---
I never watched them but I’ll check them out
---
Yeah, I've learned to resist my urges to not punish survivors and farm
---
You know what else is a crutch? Adrenaline. Mettle of Man. Decisive Strike. When Survivors stop being given 48758475 ways to win even after the killer very clearly should've won, by your own logic, I'll agree with you.
---
And btw, the game isn't 'already over' when NOED procs. For you to pretend the game is over and you've won as soon as 5 gens are done is stupid and immature. Stay salty.
---
you know what feels bad is when you level her up to get the perk and you see the shrine next week and it has the perk you leveled her up for
---
I make a post over the weekend where I recorded disconnects over 50 games and it was very close to every other game.  I’m planning to do the same thing with my next 50 one I get them in.
---
They're pretty small but they both make good content. Frip Frop doesn't upload as often though.
---
I watched monto a couple times but I never watched any of the other but I’ll check them out
---
&gt;I SWEAR TO GOD I'M A GOOD KILLER ITS JUST THE SURVIVORS ARE BROKEN MUH 3 MINUTES
---
A good and fair change to NOED would be to let the survivors know the killer have NOED before he hits somebody, so survivors can try to find the totem as soon is possible.
---
The kills:games ratios at red ranks for low tier killers.
---
That actually sounds kind of fun though lmao
---
Wait a minute, this guy’s on to something
---
I am not ashamed to say that I once used pig to corner someone with an active trap on them
---
Ruin, Surveillance, Unnerving, and Distressing.
---
Can take Ruin off for Overcharge or Discordance if you want to be spicy.
---
It is fun for a few laughs, but gets old really fast
---
- After this next patch, if anyone leaves pre-game, the match is canceled and items, add-ons, and offerings will be refunded.
---
- Consoles have screenshot functionality built-in.
---
Although hag is a GREAT killer, especially if you like trapping.
---
Okay that makes me feel good that their not some huge channels and give me hope I can grow
---
This image has been reposted more times than Freddy has sacrifices.
---
And it becomes truer and truer with each successive posting.
---
Since she was in college the time she died, Rin is anywhere from 18-22 years of age.
---
This is actually a really good one. Items and stuff as well. I want to confirm that BPS are as rare as I feel like they are.
---
Same. I work a full time job and I don't have time to not have fun when I am not working, no regrets.
---
Adrenaline in both cases probably lol.
---
Either bug or intended, this is not the case anymore.  It says -2 on the end game screen, but you still retain your pips when you check the rank icon in the corner back in main menu.
---
You know I looked at this and thought what if Michael was Russian? New killer Mikhail confirmed?
---
Damn I look good
---
Barf on all the things!!!  Spew your juice on hooked people, gens, your hex totem(s), windows/palettes before you get in a chase etc. 
---
She has some great add-ons too so be on the lookout for those in the blood web instead of aimlessly clicking thru it. 
---
Don't walk with charged barf either; charge up and projectile it out asap!
---
Also, I see a lot of good plagues do a spraying motion with their barf instead of trying to do it in a straight line (but this is probably a super obvious suggestion).
---
Disconnect rates of survivors after getting hit by a insta down(insta hatchet or pinky finger) or Frank's.
---
Do killers like to get called camper or something?
---
Activate windows.
---
Good fucking job! That was really satisfying
---
You see, LauЯie, in Soviet Russia, survivor stab you!
---
It's 18k, sorry for the s**tty quality
---
It's RACHEL
---
Is the rework out for console by now, or is it still being tested in the PTB?
---
When adrenaline pops mid lunge 👌
---
No, I mistyped. He did 3, I did 2
---
yes i love michael myers from the hit video game dead by daylight.
---
believe it or not it actually doesn't matter what stupid meme build youre going for, being camped is still annoying as piss and not enjoyable.
---
A dead one
---
Cyka Blyat Mikhail
---
Or you forget to look behind you and Myers snags you off the generator thus resulting in you shitting yourself.
---
Ah yes, released with his female sibling, Lore Strudel
---
Well when you double check and all five is accounted for... And it's not necessarily the sub, just most the playerbase
---
Tommorow or next week Tuesday I think.
---
To be honest, I don't care much for other player stats, I want to see my stats.
---
Stuff like sacrifices, kills, 4 kills, pallets broken, power stats, bp spent, etc for each of my killers.
---
Ohh that's a nice touch
---
Wait a minute...
---
We were originally planning on using a D Strike prop, like a glass shard, but the needle worked better logistically!
---
Opinions aside he's got a beautiful voice.
---
Love,

Bubba Main.
---
See? So immersed I’m not even sure if they’re alive.
---
Needs to be balanced around timers of poised and dance with me
---
Yeah that's pretty bad. Although at least you get to save those 2k shards.
---
I’d like to see the escape rate for survivors per each map. On average what would end up being the most difficult map?
---
And this is exactly why I set my steam profile to private and instantly quit the post match.
---
I'm ready to commit to the entity. As long as I get my huntress waifu, The entity can do whatever.
---
Your friend sounds like the typical survivor main.
---
Hey I am the guy. I wanted to see their stats.
---
No I did not. I would like to see their stats. Since they have WAY more stats and games to test from.
---
Gate isn't blocked for the survivors. This is just what shows up for the killer when they get near the exit
---
Devour Hope, I think. It's heartbreaking when it gets... well, broken, but if not, it feels so good to get those stacks up.
---
I'll have to give verifying the files a try and if it finds nothing I'll try a clean reinstall. Update pending.
---
I use bloodhound because I’m a bad killer and it’s the best way not to lose someone c:
---
Disco dance
---
That’s awesome. Cause that match was a shit show.
---
*sees rank 13* 
---
Welp, guess we gotta listen to this guy. Obviously he knows what he’s talking about.
---
Ruin/Huntresses Lullaby, Overcharge(combos well with HL), Pop goes the Weasel, and Surveillance.
---
I was joking around being sarcastic. the "/s" means it was sarcasm.
---
Fuckin ew. Filthy blade.
---
Espectator mode is broken
---
Then they have enduring...
---
Funny.
---
Special perk icon when you've unlocked Adrenaline on all owned Survivors... *if only*.
---
Honestly yeah. As much as a joke this was to make fun of killer nerfs, I tried to throw a few realistic changes for the sake of authenticity. It falls in line with how they’re trying to make make tier  1 match the core part of tier 3.
---
I actually like discordance but yeah, smarter survivors generally know its better to split up anyway, so you don’t always get very much use from it.
---
Yeah, especially considering each BPS gives you a +25% chance of getting an infinite loading screen. Or a killer DC.
---
Makes sense. Well have a good day.
---
Kind words. What do you mean more content to show? Longer videos or more interesting clips?
---
How old is Susie Joe Frank and julie
---
Would love to see:
---
* Number of people of click on "Leave Match" till date
---
* Total number of DC's till date
---
So he's confirmed? Sweet
---
And if you want to truly devour their hope, nurse.
---
Cool people dont watch this nerd shit
---
All at least 18
---
more clips
---
I'd love to see this. Every time I prestige a surv (I've got all but 2 not p3 yet) and I swear I get d strike in the first few webs every single time.
---
Accurate
---
Bit too bright IMO but it does look good
---
Either that or perma exposed yeah
---
Lol, on the ptb I decided to have some fun with the Legion and Insidious. Got like three perps at different times. Much fun.
---
Just an fyi, the app is great for jotting down builds and stays up to date
---
Oh...I thought they were teens
---
Definitely been there my guy
---
It feels like they got a cheap shot on me!
---
In the past month and a half, I have been stunned exactly 1 time by Head-On.  I was chasing after someone and when they rounded a corner suddenly they disappeared.  I looked around confused for a little while, and after a few seconds I was like “Wait, did they just jump in the-”  BAM!  Took a door straight to the face as I was doubling back on the locker to check it.  I was so fucking shocked by that trick actually working that I had to send that survivor a message post-game to congratulate them on the 900iq bamboozle.
---
(Mr Quick &amp; Quiet/Head On did end up dying, but it was entirely the fault of their shitty teammates.)
---
For playstyle when using the plague, you want to vomit on as many survivors as possible to ensure they all become broken &amp; encourage them to use the fountains.
---
When you start the match, find a survivor &amp; vomit on them until their broken. Once they are broken you M1 them &amp; hook them. This is the best way to play plague when chasing as vomiting on them prevents their speed boost &amp; if you down them without using your vomit, you cannot break them which prevents them from spreading their illness to other survivors.
---
Rinse &amp; repeat this tactic with vomiting on until broken then downing them. If you spot a group of survivors, try to vomit on all of them then chase one survivor down. Try to ensure all survivors are sick throughout the match. 
---
Use the time your chasing a survivor to practice vomiting. The vomiting has a specific trajectory that you will have to get use to &amp; can be easy to use when you get used to it.
---
If a survivor uses a fountain, don't run to drink it unless its closeby. Running far away to drink from it takes time &amp; can be used against you if its far from an exit gate as survivors may run to cleanse from it during the end-game.
---
The Corrupt is really powerful. You can use it to end chases really quickly by vomiting &amp; then wiggling it around to cover a large area. YOu can only hit a survivor once per vomit meaning don't fully charge it if you can quickly spray a survivor. 
---
Try not to get pallet looped with corrupt. If you get stunned you immediately lose Corrupt so try to avoid getting stunned unless you have spirit fury + enduring or the corrupt is almost finished. 
---
Perk Loadout;
---
- Ruin or Corrupt are both good on the plague. With corrupt make sure to vomit on all the gens that are close to you. Allows you to know when a survivor is working on a gen &amp; provides early vomit pressure
---
- M &amp; A is great for getting close with your vomit to groups of survivors &amp; works wonders for catching survivors off guard with your corrupt vomit. Good perk all around for plague
---
- BBQ for situational awareness &amp; extra BP. Perhaps its more of a preference to me due to the extra bp. You might find discordance a more useful perk, especially with Corrupt.
---
- Pop for extra gen pressure &amp; to control what gens you want to defend. The plague is really good at defending gens due to her ability to vomit on them &amp; corrupt providing her with the ability to hit multiple survivors at once. You could also go with Enduring as being looped around pallets is your biggest weakness.
---
Brutal is another alternative to Enduring. Not as effective for time-saving when being pallet looped but due to the corrupt being something that might force survivors to throw pallets down early, you could use it to break the pallets faster.
---
I think Plague's menu theme is the worst character-specific menu theme they've made since The Clown's.
---
Nah fam this is how the game should be balanced, by me
---
https://youtu.be/rMPIeWhKydA

Toss me a link to a good picture and I can add them to the list. ;D
---
Don’t forget a game map offering.
---
Well, well we meet again haha. 
---
It is I Alfie the other Myers lmao.
---
Good seeing you pop up on here!
---
Lol thank you for explaining, unfortunately i posted this and went to bed so i couldn't clarify it before the downvote fest
---
They can't be due to ratings.
---
You're my favorite costumer!
---
Its garbage right now
---
Best way to play her in my opinion is like so.
---
Match starts, you wander around and find your first survivor, that survivor is in one of two positions; either in a dead zone or by a loop. If they are in a dead zone, meaning there are no pallets/vaults for a good while, do a quick puke, get them infected, then just chase like a regular M1 Killer. Don't bother wasting time trying to get them Broken by constantly puking on them, it isn't worth the time spent. If they are near loops, don't bother puking, just start chasing. Once you get them down, hook them then just puke on the hook and infect them. If survivors start cleansing, don't go out of your way to get Corrupt Purge, you waste to much time going to a Pool of Devotion that's out of the way. If a Pool is by an area your patrolling or along the way you need to go, THEN Corrupt.
---
Her best perk load out is the usual M1 Killer load out, BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, Spirit Fury.
---
Ah, I see you also like COD Zombies, and cosplayed Jack Torrance. It's great to see you on here also!
---
Freddy has like, his own tier list. It’s like: 
---
High Tier- Freddy Krueger 
---
Mid Tier- Scary Terry 
---
Low Tier- Sharp Hand Joe
---
Get better friends. Three survivors with OP meta perks can successfully rush hook much of the time.
---
I'd put my money on Left Behind
---
I don't like that caption.
---
Before infinity war the only character the only main superhero character that died was quicksilver.
---
After the update? No way, 100% escape rare 10/10 would sandbag again
---
Yeah he wanted to give up me since im the most experienced on dbd. I still escaped
---
Wait. I'm kinda new to Reddit, tbh, but isn't this post like, a day old? Yeah, yesterday I got a little tee hee tipsy, watched GoT and threw some salt around on the internet and it was low-key kinda funny. But that was yesterday. It's now Monday. Like MID AFTERNOON Monday. Don't you have something else to do? Like a job? Or a family to hang out with? Instead of repeating the same thing everyone else here...already...kinda said? I'm not trying to judge you or whatever, it just seems a little...I dunno...wasteful? I mean, do you, but I'm gonna stop commenting after this because, frankly, this isn't really important enough for me to put any amount of time aside to talk about some made up perk in a made up world where your made up killer might have a made up advantage over my made up survivor. So...yeah...I'm gonna go finish mh work, but I'll leave the posts here for posterity. It's a nice day where I'm at. I dunno about you but maybe go outside, I guess? Have a nice day, whatever you decide to do.
---
*Notices ur knife*
---
OwO
---
And here I am trying to be tricky with Tinkerer and Monitor/abuse.
---
Have pulled one person off a genny so far.
---
Next Tuesday
---
If the only argument you've got left is to revert to being extremely salty and trying to say that I have no friends to play with (of which I have plenty, by the way), you've lost the argument.
---
Yup
---
I literally had a game last night where i flashlight saved and gained another token. Quit your bullshit.
---
Go on Reddit after third kill. Not worth searching for the last person.
---
Good ole daddy long legs
---
How about amount of sacrifices/moris/non sacrifice deaths?
---
My man
---
Maybe just stats on kills per match on average.
---
From her bio:
---
"She studied Education at Takamatsu, a private university, which weighed heavily on her family's shaky finances."
---
I don't know many 15 year olds that are able to study at private universities. And if they are, they're probably smart enough to be accepted with a full ride.
---
It's the truth from what I've seen, actually. If you're caught in the killer's range, you'd think they wouldn't be able to hit you after completing a vault, and yet...
---
I mean, Reddit doesn't do posts chronologically. I've gotten comments on posts 3+ days after I've posted them. But if you're gonna pretend like I'm the one at fault for replying to a post on my feed, sure.
---
My avg. kills as killer
---
My avg. scape as a survivor  
---
also if this is public so i can check if the Killer is pro or noob after the game
---
Rework still not released for any platforms. Not sure if the PTB is still up but I believe people have stopped playing on it now.
---
What, as in Sabotaged Traps? Those do respawn automatically. Hangman's just reduces that timer by 60 seconds.
---
All about that No Mither.
---
Like Monto and his Dorito pants
---
*Claudette has joined the game*
---
OH DAMN.....that Myers build is trash
---
*UH OH*
---
Thanks.
---
To be fair most rank 1 on PS have adrenaline and self care. The other 2 can be different depending on how they are trying to play.
---
that is shadowborn, my dude
---
You get to hear it when you select Legion in the ptb.
---
It's an add-on. By default he can't see them, but with the add-on the illusion has a huge yellow aura you can see across the map. 
---
As an added benefit, the illusion will also face towards you when it spawns. It's one of his better add-ons imo.
---
bruh
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
Against the doc? That two minutes isn't free lmao
---
maybe play nurse instead of Freddy if youre having trouble against people using the best there is
---
Replace Surveillance with Huntress Lullaby - get that extra regression. I've legit seen a team revert an almost done gen to a dead gen.
---
a LOT.
---
**Paramedic** - Niche utility that looks balanced and useful. 25 seconds at max is maybe a bit long and I agree with most people that for the sake of numbers as well as balance it should be 20 seconds at max.
---
**Fragile** - But I only have one hook phase anyways when playing solo. :^) Jokes aside it's an interesting concept but you always have to be careful when assigning action speed increases. Put bluntly if you run this perk along with No Mither, Resilience, Prove Thyself, and something to keep yourself alive (maybe an Exhaustion perk maybe Spine Chill IDK) and run a good toolbox you can gen rush to shit with a permanent 10% faster action speed. I know "doooiiii 10% faster action speed OP kappa" and also you'll be permanently injured and killed in two hooks but still. Even if you're just playing normally Fragile's permanent speed boost when compared to Resilience's requirement to be permanently injured is pretty severe. If you run Deliverance the 80 seconds on hook becomes a huge asset and in a SWF setting you can grab Adred to gen rush and then be a really tough kill in the end game. Basically what I'm saying is that it's dangerous to tie increased action speed to anything because gens are already done too fast, but the core concept of the perk is interesting.
---
**Slow-breathing** - I *really* like this perk as a concept but probably the biggest issue is that its effectiveness varies wildly based on Killer. The most obvious thing to mention is that for a Killer like Doctor or a map like The Game this perk cucks the Killer to an ungodly degree. Excluding the ideal scenario the effectiveness of the perk would really be tied to the speed of the healing while in the Killer's TR. I think if the perk let you heal to full (and would simply heal you at 30/40/50 (Self Care)% speed based on level) it would have niche use as a sort of reverse Coulrophobia (and would perhaps increase the amount of people using Coulrophobia?) I have to ask if having permanent passive Self Care while in the Killer's Terror Radius is too strong (as well as potentially having regular healing speed while in the Killer's Terror Radius with the use of Self Care, not even mentioning healing speed with a Medkit) but at the end of the day the requirement to stand still and just the general fact that it's tied to the Terror Radius and there are so many Killers with reduced Terror Radiuses does make it balanced overall. Yes there is a logical extreme of going up against a Doctor while you have Iron Will and Calm Spirit, but then that leaves you heavily exposed to playing against a Wraith. I love perks that play with the Terror Radius (Stakeout is one of my favorite perks and I'd use Diversion a lot more if the charge time wasn't godawful) and I think having more perks that give a downside to the Terror Radius would be a good way to indirectly buff stealth play and Killers with smaller terror radius, while also inversely nerf perks like Whispers and Killers like Doctor who focus on staying around with a Survivor in your Terror Radius.
---
Overall if we use Trump's Custom Hearthstone Card ratings:
---
* **Paramedic** - 5 Star Design, 5 Star Balance
---
* **Fragile** - 5 Star Design, 3 Star Balance (Only issue is action speed but the thing is that action speed is such a big issue and I don't know if the downside of "can only be hooked once" is enough of a tradeoff.)
---
* **Slow-breathing** - 5 Star Design, 4 Star Balance (Could be OP; needs testing)
---
LMFAO i actually cackled
---
You gonna get one of the TOT Studios knives?
---
I mean, there's also the argument that the devs don't do anything with feedback from the test servers. This also includes not fixing bugs that people found on it until several weeks/months later lol
---
It's 20% of the time 1st try, or 80% of time last one. It is never 2nd or 3rd box. I think where is a bug and no one knows it exists. It's just from my personal experience, I could be wrong.
---
do not forget the camp and tunnel ones lol
---
But if it's Perma Exposed it's basically just No Mither by another name. Which side note: No Mither is generally viewed as "fine" (but immensely garbage) by the general community since it's run so rarely.
---
When you have to play the best killer in the game to have a chance against the other side something is wrong.
---
When is the next double BP?
---
As long as you have a tracking perk or, in this case, be the doctor it's ok. Because you're guaranteed to find somebody and initiate the chase before those 2 minutes are up.
---
Did your girlfriend dress up as myers? (Sorry for the bad joke)
---
We only know that she's younger than Frank, who is 19
---
Ooo this seems fun? Whats the name of the app?
---
Insulting someone =\= a joke. Stfu
---
That's the plan! The 1978 knife has piqued my interest
---
oh ok i see so you just want to compare survivors using the best there is to trash tier killers so you can whine. have fun with that
---
show us!
---
It's far from the worst joke, don't worry!
---
Thank you, next.
---
&gt;DR Rates against all Killers at all ranks. Or possibly the perks that cause the most disconnects, if my previous suggestion was already made.
---
"killer gods with noed"
---
If a killer was actually good at the game, they wouldn't use noed.
---
It’s a joke build
---
OLD MAN MYERS AND SURVIVALIST LAURIE PLEASE DEVS
---
Wait, why does Bill have the toxic flashlight and not Claudette?
---
too bad it isnt funny
---
This coming weekend, starting Thursday
---
My favorite shit
---
Let's see... UAV recon online, Oxy Clean Removes all Red Stains, Be Afraid. Be Very Afraid, and Bloons Totem Defense.
---
Survivors using the best there is would be full insta heal squad with a Haddonfield offering. I just said a SWF with meta perks.
---
Wtf I can't hear the windy sounds I thought they only play when shes not in terror radius
---
yells \*UNLIMITED POWER\*
---
You just said against a good Swf team and meta perks, well yeah you want to play the best killer..
---
At the moment, the game dont have the ability to see the perks, items and offerings of other players, in this case of what it happens that many players take similar perks which would only be enough 1 on team. Such as Borrow Time, Plunderer's Instinct, Ace In The Hole, Detective's Hunch, etc.
---
This is cursed.
---
yes please
---
This literally happened to me two days ago against the Hag
---
Unpopular opinion I guess, but I'm not sure if the problem is so much unbalancing, as punishing people that DC as soon as they get hit or hooked. And would love more blood events or something to break the monotony of the game up, change it up for a short time.
---
get ready for easy hooks cause of over-altruistic survivors
---
Even more unfun than iri head tbh. At least you can technically juke that, there’s zero counter play against a prayer bead spirit.
---
maybe they will change items in the game)
---
Quick, use the iridescent shards to unlock *everything*!
---
Bruh adrenaline is fine the way it is, it doesn’t need a change..
---
Y'know, I wish I'd arrived sooner. You guys are stealing everything I had to say for the better lol
---
The amount of time survivors have been tunnelled or camped.
---
I got a 4k as hillbilly and 50k BP (bcuz BBQ) and depiped
---
oh that was meant to be you Passively break totems 10% faster, Sorry for the confusion
---
“Find the Bubba”
---
The Burning Rage
---
Calm yourself, Satan.
---
thank you soo much for this well thought feedback!
---
I'll make a future version with everything updated and probably with fragile completely reworked
---
maybe gives a faster wiggle time, and have 2 phases shorter then normal? well I'll have to think better later, but thanks for the feedback
---
When you don't make the hex skill check *stop interacting*. There's no point in working on the gen in the window where it pauses. You don't get anything good out of it, and can still trigger skillchecks in that window.
---
Overcharge
---
Unnerving Presence
---
Distressing
---
4th is up to how you will play IMO.  Hex are great until the pop them (Ruin or Lullaby), Overwhelming Presence is nice and safe.  But Surveillance is the tricky way to go :)
---
Sounds like a really cool idea, but in practice, turns out pretty terribly.
---
- The killer ends up not actually playing for a portion of the game (which could be a lot), totally counts on how long it lasts, too. Too short and the killer gets free kills, since survivors either have to run to get downed to save their teammate, or the survivor on the hook dies, otherwise the killer ends up not playing for half the game cos of the generous timer.
---
- Survivor players sign up to play survivor, not Killer. Imagine if there was a perk survivors could use to forcefully steal the killer's role and force them to play survivor.
---
- What would happen if the survivor got unhooked? Would they instantly lose control? Would they be punished? If yes, that TOTALLY sucks for the survivor, if no, that TOTALLY sucks for the killer since the survivor could just run the killer across the map.
---
I dc, so i couldn't see what happend. Dunno if Nea made it. That Spirit alredy wasted much of my time , so i didn't want to stay around anymore. I reported her, of course.
---
Buff Survivor's perks, make that we return to the SWF lobby after leaving a match and add new game modes (like 2 Vs 8).
---
and a lobby with all survivors using WGLF
---
Pebble. And pebble cosmetics.
---
I think it was on a dbd livestream saying they have shirtless cosmetics with underwear for all characters excluding spirit. The main part about Ace was a Paulie Esther tweet and one of the devs replied saying something like "There are many things about ace we dont know we haven't asked him" or some bare bones answer like that.
---
The real reason is indefensible? What? A coordinated team of people going, “OH THE KILLER IS (insert killer)!” Oh my god it must be so hard to put up with,“OH THE KILLER HAS RUIN!” I personally feel like they’ve made it harder to know what killers are running since you can’t see their perks until the game has ended. Only you can make it blatantly obvious if you’re running a perk now.

Dude this actually looks amazing! Well done!
---
I mean, I main survivor, but judging hop the legion's theme is one of the few good things about him, I can't say no to that change!
---
I believe it’s pretty fair. As killer and survivor, it seems pretty balanced. The whole game is about team work half the time ffs.
---
I remember seeing somebody say that Frank is 19, and Susy’s cosmetic items mention college.
---
If 2 survs die/2 escape its a tie, 3 survs die the killer wins. If all 4 die its total victory. Reverse is true too if course.
---
&gt;People are more likely to use them during double bp events so you’ll be getting 3-4 hundred percent extra plus killers are more likely to farm. Rather than just double and getting a killer that kills you with 300 points
---
If you burn the offerings today you will get the same amount of bloodpoints that you would during double BP...
---
Say if I use my Escape Cake today, it will give me +20k. If I use it during the event it will give me the same +20k.
---
The amount of bloodpoints you get for your offering is the same.
---
I'm sick of the auto aim.  I run and look behind me mostly and I swear I get hit when the killer swings at the air and not me its bullshit.
---
The thing is is that you shouldn't have to play the best killer against a SWF using meta perks.
---
Well yeah man you're playing Nea, don't you know the Entity sees through the killer's eyes?
---
Self care being outdated is false BS perpetuated by killer mains. The time you spend healing other survivors could have been spent on generators or breaking totems.
---
I like the idea of that combo with Trapper, Hag and to an extent Myers. I hate how long they take to set up while gens are popping
---
I've had this happen too. I'm on ps4
---
That’s true but I just don’t get why if one thing gets fixed(killers perks etc in the post game results being hidden from now on) people find something new to complain about.
---
If you think that's the only thing a coordinated team says over voice comms, you're crazy. Stealth killers and their powers are made moot as soon as someone spots them, you can coordinate saves much better than solo, know where hex totems are as soon as one person spots them, instantly find out where people are for a quick heal, and completely negate several killer perks while making obsolete several survivor ones. You sound like you're trying to downplay the extreme benefits voice comms give survivors, and (quite frankly) failing at it. 
---
And no shit they made it harder for people to know what the killer is running, but that's only part of why SWF is a problem.
---
It's bad enough they're faster then they get bloodlust.. its bs..
---
Somebody give this person an award
---
This certainly isn't new. People have been talking about this issue for a long time now.
---
I play on ps4, so we have no chat to coordinate BPS. It's a semi known thing that spooky medkit=BPS. But it's also known that spooky medkit=franklins and a mori :(
---
Lmao
---
After playing the Nurse (I'm a survivor main who typically plays Leatherface or The Plague when I play killer) I will NEVER complain about someone playing her. Shes super hard to play. I didn't sacrifice one survivor when I tried her out. Shes so hard to play on the ps4!
---
I usually use 2 blink Nurse, but since I have so many addons stacked from levelling I might as well use them. This is rank 4 so I’m not going to not use addons to prove a point.
---
Thanks, I don’t think so either - the Claudette thinks I tunnelled her because I went for her at the basement, but I invested time to get her there so I think it was justified.
---
See the 3 silver emblams? One of those has to be red otherwise I think they all need to be gold together. Entity insist you do ANYTHING other than down and kill them right away. Let them get unhook while you protect the gens.
---
Nobody expects a no terror radius doctor
---
"Hey BHVR, what's my level?"   
---
"Yes."
---
Vigo stuff
---
Okay. You can bitch about whatever you want in this killer sided subreddit. If you seriously think it’s a problem, you might just be crazy as well. I do better solo queuing as survivor. Any time I play swf I lose more than I do playing solo. Unless you’re unnaturally sweaty at this game then swf shouldn’t be an issue.
---
Yep.
---
I get the issue but the game is just so unbalanced it’s hard to make a solution that wouldn’t unbalance it more.
---
106 has breached containment!
---
People are too offended by innocuous shit, I find this stuff hilarious when it happens to me.
---
"Killer-sided subreddit", lol. You're either very thick or trying to pass off this very real problem as nothing. Go be ignorant somewhere else.
---
Oooh I see, that makes a lot more sense, thank you!!
---
Just juke the Nurse, it's simple. You just have to play differently, like become immune to hits, or hope she's running garbage perks/addons. You just refuse to adapt, so it's obviously your fault when the Omega Blink Nurse, with the best meta perks, gets a 4k.
---
Once I get my better computer, I'm buying Hag anyways so
---
Call me ignorant xD. This subreddit is very killer sided. Try not being a hermit and actually play both sides dumbass.
---
oh ok. use hillbilly then
---
It should be switched
---
And I've seen this sub have a lot of survivors on it, as well. And when you resort to personally attacking the other side of the argument, you've lost the argument.
---
You can’t hear Bubba’s for the sound of his saw. I can never end a play session with bubba selected because that chainsaw is so annoying
---
Daddy Myers looking as SHARP as ever
---
I can feel this memes energy.
---
You're too kind, Kiwi &lt;3
---
Remember that when you lose something it is spelled with one O. 
---
The word loose is used to refer to your mums vag
---
I ended up sending them a request lmao
---
I think both perks are ok. Situational as MOM only works on about half the killers (probably less) and Adrenaline doesn’t work unless 5 gems are done, meaning survivors go 90% of the match with a perk slot doing nothing. 
---
But I do see it being annoying if they have both those perks and they loop the killer for 3-5 gens without getting them down.
---
Samination &gt; Jesus of Nazareth
---
Not a killer main, but I haven’t seen a YouTuber/streamer use it in months unless it’s for a build
---
It is tho. Unless you’re playing SWF there’s no reason not to use it. Looking for a person to heal you could take longer than just healing sometimes.
---
If they allowed you to go above the cap, it would be awesome. But it just lets you get what you can already easily get a little faster.
---
Honestly not giving up valuable perk slots for.
---
I hear some rumours that you're the next killer, have any comments for us?
---
They seem fine, 25 is way long though, but asides from that, one of the few times someone has come up with perks that aren't blatantly OP for one side, but also aren't completely pointless.
---
Pixels are scary though
---
I usually just bring a medkit even if it’s brown so I can still have another perk slot
---
Yeah I prestiged claudette, meg and nea. Cant beat a bit of sprint burst, urban evasion, balanced landing, Adrenaline and self care lol
---
[Fine, you want something more recent?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/amqlqk/1000_games_stats_killer_and_survivor_perks?sort=top)
---
Why the Entity takes people like Rin or the Legion... people who have never killed or killed very few as opposed to more people like the Clown, Freddy, Trapper, etc.
---
I beg to differ, but believe what you want to
---
I agree for with most fo this. I still feel that the time for Paramedic is too long. I’d argue that 3/6/9 seconds would be more fair. It’s a little more time than Poised or Dance With Me, I think? I don’t have those perks, so I don’t know, Honestly. 
---
I agree wholeheartedly with your thoughts on Fragile. 
---
I agree with your thoughts on Slow Breathing. I do, however, wish the name was cooler XD
---
He kinda sounds like an idiot.
---
I hope so. Things have been boring here since they replaced me with that wannabe for the TV show.
---
Oh, I'm sure you do.
---
That post didn't make any sense with how the devs have openly stated jigsaw boxes works, and further more somehow tested 500 traps in 50 games.
---
Lol, when I see you in a swf, I won’t forget the mori 😉
---
I actually really like them. Most survivor perk ideas are disgusting OP, but these are very interesting.
---
I like IG because of the nice QoL factor it gives, and it somehow has become a lot larger of a crutch for me than NOED could ever be.
---
I like to solo survivor to rank one and would love to know how man others do the same. I would also like  Dc percentage so I  can laugh. How many NOED  Kills. Def want to know times DS was used.
---
**Paramedic** IS a cool idea, but I agree with some of the others that 25 is unnecessarily long. 15 at most really should do the trick, especially since it works for both survivors.  
---
I personally can't see myself using **Fragile**. Too much risk involved for a precious slot on my survivor, and if you get hooked first and die, you're very much hurting your team. Getting hooked early and dying means you still get 100% extra points, but if you didn't do much.... not worth it. I'd prefer a perk instead that makes it so in the second phase, I don't struggle (which means losing struggle points) but I'd be able to try and free myself from the hook still.   
---
**Slow-Breathing** is interesting for sure. We have so few self regenerative passive abilities. But can't it heal you to full? If I heal myself half way and then the killer comes, why can't his TR heal my other 50%? Also, this would be HELL against Nurses Calling, forcing you to move because standing still means you're healing. Also, what if you're in a locker? You are standing still after all.   
---
just some thoughts. I like 1 and 3, not so much on 2.
---
I don't get it.
---
I don't WANT to get it.
---
I just want the OLD school one, the one with the really calm matching theme for survivor lobbies
---
Lmao I was just talking to someone about this yesterday. They said that dbd (on PS4) looked like Final Fantasy 7 and I died lmao.
---
That’s where I’m at too. Honestly wish the BP bonuses were base for all killers/survivors. I’m really sick of using BBQ.
---
Turn the menu music off then.
---
I expect two hundred comments about shirtless Myers, within the hour
---
*When you 4K a safety or depip game against rank 14 potatoes with your Insidious Noed Bubba (title edited for accuracy)
---
If the devs say the RBT stats guy is wrong, I want them to provide those stats.
---
Not a video explaining how they're *supposed* to work, the hard numbers on how things are *actually* going.
---
Surprised it's cosplay since it looks really good
---
mr poop lmao
---
Letting someone bleed out loses you some points in the "Devout" category. Killing them too quickly loses you some points in the "Malicious" category, and not chasing them enough (and by extension, killing them too quickly) also loses you points in Chaser. It's just an unfortunate reality that a game not lasting long enough will just not let you rank up. In a way it's also a good thing balance-wise, because that gets rid of a lot of outliers too.
---
he's playing hag
---
LOL, dude get a grip - who tf cares? It’s a video. Of a game. Is this what you do in your spare time?
---
Pretty sure that's the hag
---
F this game I swear lmao
---
Shirtless Myers
---
oh yeah i know, but you said survivors are using the second best instead of the best. so do that
---
That was amazing
---
I responded to your part of the post around the “cry to the devs...” part.  Then told you the basic information of all video posting. If you can’t handle criticism, don’t post it. 
---
Stop getting offended or playing victim. If you upload something most of the community doesn’t like, you’ll receive backlash. 
---
This is a fairly simple concept. Good day, boss.
---
nope
---
P H A R M A C Y
---
This is the best thing ever when it happens
---
 Nah I’ll take my title instead, thank you for trying tho
---
Overpowered...no. Slightly annoying...yes.
---
If you power through you'll probably get gens done quicker than if you ran around looking for the totem plus someone is bound to find it sooner or later.
---
My great/hex checks have improved since not bothering about finding the hex totem.
---
But with the pig that's an actual thing you can do. That trap will eventually pop so it isnt holding the game hostage. And if the guy would be your third kill or you managed to get 2 trapped with active traps that is their bad and they will die.
---
Plus the timer is like 2 minutes or more so if there is more than 1 survivor out working on gens it's almost never worth it.
---
Thats always been a thing with Plague.
---
&gt; The time you spend healing other survivors could have been spent on generators or breaking totems.
---
i dunno how well this holds up in the newer sloppy butcher meta. it especially wouldn't if more people used we'll make it
---
He went afk?
---
If I'm looking at the picture correctly and what map you're in...couldn't you not just go back up the stairs and finish off the last gens?
---
