Gotta love this community, down voting a harmless question into oblivion.
---

---
To answer your question, the only discord I'm aware of is the official DBD one. Lots of people there you could get in touch with to play, but pay no mind to the lemmings that run the place. They operate it like their own private kingdom, belittling people who don't kiss their feet, and BHVR allow it.
---
Your other option is Steam discussions, but again steer clear of the circle jerking killer mains over there. Come to think of it, those types are probably the same ones who down voted your question here. Too insecure to comprehend that SWF exists.
---
At any rate good luck, and I apologise for this community's behaviour towards you.
---
---
---
*buys smurfs*
---
Yeah! Im excited too!
---
If The Plague vomits on a survivor would the Demogorgon still eat him even knowing the survivor is sick?
---
Hag if you don‚Äôt have ruin or devour. She‚Äôs fun to play as and placing traps in unpredictable places are fun.   
---
Though I prefer Spirit. Ruin is an amazing perk (contrary to those who hate when its cleansed early) but it doesn‚Äôt happen *every* game and even for those few seconds it works.  
---
If you haven‚Äôt gotten it, bbq is in the shrine!  I would honestly use your shards to get that, play like crazy with that perk and get your shards and bloodpoints up. Get both characters quicker and leveling faster.
---
People who were banned recently (myself included):
---
I love how BBQ is gold tinted because it‚Äôs a top tier perk
---
When Bubba camps with chainsaw revved....there is no teabag üò≤
---
I was more scared you weren't gonna pick up the mori
---
I GET INTO A LOBBY WITH 3 RANK 8 (IM RANK 15) KILL ONE OF THEM WITH NOED AND GET CALLED TOXIC SHIT ON STEAM
---
I thought I was the only one
---
Truetalent is skilled.
---
And like I have said.
---
He checks profiles of people he is suspicious of. If he sees somebody multiple times in a row he may assume they are a sniper depending on how they act. There are three or four sniper is that he has to deal with several times a day. They do everything they can to fuck with him. He gets sniped so much that he should be suspicious.
---
Either way you lost the argument the moment you had to resort to name-calling every single time you have replied.
---
SWF can really help you put a lot of pressure on regardless of a 4K and that‚Äôs never a bad thing.  Sure they can say ‚Äúhey they put a trap in front of me‚Äù so instead place them in other spots near them. Make Your Choice will help snowball everything.  
---
Don‚Äôt place a trap directly infront of ruin either. Maybe one. But again, other places.   Maybe get haunted grounds on her too! Since they‚Äôll want to cleanse totems and think you have devour!
---
Thantaphobia and sloppy butcher Legion, are we back in 2018? I gotta farm some more of those winter gift boxes during the solstice blood hunt week!
---
Il see both of you on a hooküòò, Killer main btw.
---
Yes
---
You're a fucking moron.
---
Most times people stand in the exit to heal and let you hit them, or to mad boldness on your tr. Not everyone is toxic
---
Same level of slowdown when charging the saw that billy has to he can mindgame pallets
---
Very popular, eery horror movie in the 80s it makes sense.  Actually, come to think of it, if you read the Stranger Things trivia you‚Äôll see they add a lot of Easter eggs in the show when it comes to early horror movies.
---
Ash doesn‚Äôt have his boomstick either so I don‚Äôt think so. They could have the backpack though.
---
A small sacrifice for salvation.
---
Lol you sound like a queer
---
The best advice for playing hag is: just play spirit. No skill required, ez win, unless you are deaf.
---
Would make adrenaline plays a little less useful, but still keep it a good perk.
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs definitely an area control character.
---
swf
---
I don't get this
---
Good to know
---
Great concept! Just seeing this makes me appreciate all the effort that went into this.
---
It's all good man I could have done some more research before asking but I was being lazy. Thanks tho
---
Oh I was talking about just buying the perk again for the 150 k
---
Seriously I flawed for my meta perks and now they are just being handed out like handjobs in the alley behind quiznos
---
The fact that you have to harp on the "name calling" (i said manchild, which you are) is pathetic.  Grow a sack. You lost the argument the second you turned a meme into 1.  Little boy.
---
Fun idea especially if they had a random game spectate section sort of like Csgo / LoL but aside from that it‚Äôd be pretty meh after the first while because people would just want to watch the action
---
I absolutely think im better than teabaggers
---
If a killer uses thrilling tremors, the plagues gen perk, and the new one, it would be nearly impossible to get a gen done. Not to mention ruin or dying light.
---
You got the job!
---
He gets sniped 24/7
---
Tell them to suck a fat one that's what I do
---
Nice one! We need more concepts and less memes in this cursed land.
---
Perfect that you got BBQ. That‚Äôll snowball all of your other killers/survivors with bloodpoints. 
---
I suggest Hag for ruin, Billy for enduring, pig for make your choice and surveillance. Spirit for Haunted Grounds and Spirit fury.  Eventually getting all perks is the real grind so you can do any build you want but the ones I mentioned are the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù and can never hurt to have.
---
Fyi just because YOUR SITUATIONAL EXAMPLE might be try doesnt mean MINE isnt.
---
A big problem with that is survive with friends, but with a delay it may work. Still may have some problems though.
---
&gt;No, not really... It has too many mechanics for it to be a party game, it has lots of depth to it, and a high level entry point
---
About as much depth as Mario party and only tryhards take it competitively. Party game for sure
---
&gt;It sounds like you don't know what you're talking about and like you'd be rank 16-20
---
The fact that you think there's a high entry point for this game is more telling of a rank 20
---
No.
---
Haha, yes, that is part of the reason my flair is Iron Will. Ironically I main Spirit.
---
It's like putting hot sauce on your burrito, just improves taste but destroys your bowels.
---
Those are not infinites. I don't think you know what an infinite in this game is. Just break the pallets. And there are not many double pallets on this game anymore.
---
Didnt say he doesnt get sniped.  But he jumps to that a lot of the time.
---
How
---
What do you call the survivors?
---
That tense feeling when you get +4 bold out of nowhere but don't see the killer or hear a heartbeat.
---
Theres actually no reason to have filler anything when backed by good game design.
---
Good luck!
---
Happens on PC too.
---
I can understand that, if you're looking for BP, camping isn't normally the way to go. But getting comfy and relaxing in front of a hook while you and the survivor share life stories as his timer runs out is nice. And when overly altruistic teams just kill themselves on you and you get a 4K for no reason.
---
I'm not saying he's the best, just a good killer main. 
---
I'm sure there are better, but I've stopped watching as many DBD streams lately.
---
new format who dis
---
The funny thing is in the Scream Franchise they actually make parodies off of the actual killings and name it Stab
---
It‚Äôs actually kind of cute. Would be good for people‚Äôs avatars
---
Salty? Haha, sure man. 
---
My bad, I once again forgot people have zero ability to hear tone in text.
---
It‚Äôs almost like that was that I was referencing, isn‚Äôt it?
---
because there‚Äôs no undead/undertaker killer yet
---
It's just my personality bro
---
Oh well then I'm a dumb dumb sorry lol.
---
They still haven‚Äôt fixed this??! Dude...
---
No need to worry about rank if you're still a yellow. 
---
One of the best perks for her in my opinion are Make Your Choice and Save The Best For Last. STBFL makes you recover faster from your attacks and thus you can teleport to your triggered traps faster after hitting a survivor.  Make Your Choice is great if survivors going for a safe are dumb and trigger your traps around hooked survivor. It also synergies with STBFL, if survivor succesfully rescues a survivor and you down the rescuer, you are back in game more quickly and you get potential for some serious snowballing.
---
Don't overtrap generators, if you run Ruin, its not that important. Trap hooks to down potential rescuers, trap places that gives you advantage in chases like dropped pallets so survivors can't loop around them.
---
Over time, you develop your own strategies, your own builds and thats what makes the game most fun in my opinion.
---
Same, I don't remember who made the post but I saw that too. I'm pretty sure they called the perk Nancy Drew or something.
---
......keep going...
---
As in your the killer still, correct?  
---
I think her base movement speed is a little slower, like spirits.  You‚Äôre still going to chase people, that‚Äôs a given.   So enduring/spirit fury will be good when you‚Äôre just an M1 killer.   But okay listen... 
---
Survivor is running you around a pallet, jungle gym, etc ... place a trap during that chase. If they‚Äôre not paying attention, you can shut it down fast if they run over it. **if they run away** like most would you should have traps placed already so they trigger it and get them. If they go from one pallet to another, you should already have a trap set up and ready.  That‚Äôs what I mean by unpredictable spots. 
---
Keep hitting people!!  Even if you‚Äôre mid chase and someone triggers close enough to teleport go smack them.  Keep pressure on them so they‚Äôre not doing gens! Thanataphobia is a good perk if you take my advice doing that.
---
It's a pipe dream but I hope the demogorgon doesn't hook people somehow
---
He can be in more than one game.  Freddy, Bubba and Jason have all been in Mortal Komabt

This didn't deserve downvotes

I can see while they would call you toxic but if the exit gates are open I totally understand why you would have to tunnel

That'd be great. Wraith gets their names wrong every time.

"Ding Ding. Oh, it's... Fred."
---
"Frank."
---
"Sure, Fred. Sooooo I see you brought Jamie, Josh and Samantha. Maybe consult us before you bring your friends, next time?"
---
Alright, thank you. I don‚Äôt have Myers so hopefully STBFL will come to the shrine soon
---
Bro what movie were you watching. Nancy stands around being a cardboard cut out for the majority of the film while the other three are actually doing anything, and then the writers remembered she was supposed to be Nancy at the end of the film and had her kill Freddy.
---
I love that Nea outfit sooo much! I need that shirt x3
---
I'm in the green ranks and I spend time looking for Ruin because I feel confident with my map knowledge but most importantly my teammates just don't seem to be able to ever power through it. 
---
Some games, yeah. But I constantly see people still working on it after hitting a good skill check. I see people doubling up on a gen and all hitting good skill checks.
---
And the real kicker today. Someone was working on a gen in killer shack. Ruin was up. Guess where I find the damn Ruin totem at??
---
Lol wow, the whiney little bitch resorts to calling someone queer on the internet.

You're just mad because you got called out for being the piece of shit you know you are

The idea that you can own an intangible concept is becoming sillier every day in the Information Age, especially considering stupid shit like this can happen. You should own the rights to a creative work you produce, but not the intangible Concept of Jason Voorhes

Absolutely!  Any other questions feel free to message me anytime!
---
Lord it is ridiculous when you find people like that. Clueless to their surroundings. Its super easy to hit great skill checks as well, so the fact that a lot of purple and reds can‚Äôt consistently hit them is ridiculous. I am red rank and I havent even gotten past player level 100 yet but I rarely miss hex skill checks. It baffles me that people with 2-3x my playime don‚Äôt have enough practice to be competent yet
---
Yes but you don‚Äôt have to a bunch of BP into a killer you might never use to get it.
---
No idea, but the mori would be seeing her face and literally dying of fear/horror
---
I‚Äôll do that. Thanks!
---
I was being ironic because some main killers say that
---
Not new but looking for some PS4 players myself for the odd SWF or Kill Your Friends, C-T-C-C is the PSN if anyone wants to add too, I don‚Äôt mind helping either!
---
Meanwhile last night I could have sworn the ghostface was farming but it ends up he wasnt at all and I ended up looking like an idiot letting him hook me
---
Would love to see one for the plague
---
Dont tunnel the last 3 gens?
---
Thanks :) I worked pretty hard on it
---
Why are you booing him? He‚Äôs right?!
---
I cant stop you. But I will warn you again. Dont.
---
Spark of madness is probably the best for beginners as fengs min gives you a stamina perk, a way to see the killer if he breaks a gene or a pallet, and a way to quietly do genes with a 50% chance of blocking an explosion if you mess up a skill check. the doctor is a good killer for farming as well and an easy way to find survivors with his madness ability. plus it helps that feng is adorable.
---
Yeah, I used to feel the same way. But I realized that if I never tell anybody, nobody will know.   
---
If it's not for you, it's not for you.

This shrine will last until 8/27/19, right? They lay for a week I think.
---
There have been a LOT of suggestions for hiding survivors when they're unhooked.
---
You were still talking to this clown? You're a better person than me.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to average it but the developers have admitted that matchmaking is broken right now. 
---
Sorry it‚Äôs leading to a less fun experience. They say they‚Äôre working on it and it‚Äôll be fixed in a few weeks when they launch dedicated servers. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 otherwise I‚Äôd invite you to play with me to make it a bit fairer. Good luck and have fun!
---
Hell Yeah! i've been waiting so long for wake up too man.
---
I exclusively play survivor so I think I know what I‚Äôm talking about
---
ye....think again
---
Nurse and Billy aren't that different but somehow people bitch more about spirit than Billy.. okay
---
Unpopular opinion but he became kind of a monster in the later games so if he was in dbd he wouldn't be a survivor.
---
Depends on the platform (PC PS4 or XB1) for available DLC options. 
---
I will say this, they randomly do go on sale so if you can wait it might be worth waiting for. 
---
While we don‚Äôt know about stranger things yet, the developers are gonna hold a live stream in 20 hours showing off perks and abilities so I would definitely wait till tomorrow to see if you like the play style
---
I was going to say exactly what this poster said. Listen to them.
---
I was about to say that. I think this only happens when there's only 1 perk left.
---
Lol thank you Antcat.
---
BBQ and Chili/We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever would be similarly easy to add a 4th tier to. Just let people get an extra token per match (and make BBQ and Chili count hooks not survivors so this is possible).
---
I can understand blocking someone for like two seconds as a joke or something but, why this?
---
Eh I doubt it‚Äôs an issue as the Ash we have is from the tv show which is set in modern time. Aka he‚Äôd know of Halloween, Saw, all the other licensed characters too.

The other thing to do is to chase them towards your web of traps. This is why scattering them is important.  If you have traps spread out, you simply need to chase them towards it. And you get an easy hit.
---
We all deal with the matchmaker being terrible cross platform. Happens all the time.

I'm purple rank so I get both red and green. I think he was green. Someone who knows hope to play and why they play a certain way.
---
I just want my boy Steve to have that Scoops Ahoy outfit. That'd be the best thing in the world.
---
That "teachable" perk will randomly show up in the bloodwebs of your unlocked killers.

Also KYF doesn't award blood points.

He's a rugby dude and works out a lot. I don't think he smokes lol

I'd do the same, but I don't have Netflix. I'm usually "too busy" playing games to justify paying monthly (I still haven't beaten one path Fire Emblem Three Houses, and I bought it at launch two weeks ago).
---
I feel like Susie should have been a survivor. Like, if she had chosen not to kill, then the other three turned against her. It would have taken it from just teenagers who murdered in a panic to monsters willing to kill their friend. Plus I kind of like the idea of some of the survivors being linked to their respective killers.
---
I literally leveled up Bubba like three weeks ago and I'm super mixed. On one hand I saved the shards but on the other hand I coulda leveled someone else for their perks.

Learn the big loops on maps, ones where you don‚Äôt have to use pallets and you can waste a good 30-40 seconds without getting hit. They are on a few maps like the Factory on Macmillan, Around the school on Badham, The cow shed thing can‚Äôt remember map name. Learn them and try to be more optimal. A perk that could help you is windows of opportunity, it allows you to see pallets and windows through walls. This will help you learn the maps
---
Not a whole lot is known about her becoming the pig. I'm just saying that some elaboration on her story between Kramer's death to her being taken by the entity.
---
In this game it‚Äôs kinda weird. It‚Äôs easy to get frustrated playing as a killer, and when survivors are taunting you on top of it, it feels like you‚Äôre being ganged up on, and being the killer you don‚Äôt have anyone to have your back for you when survivors complain or are rude. It can all pile up over time.
---
I miss them from time to time (I swear sometimes on PS4 skill checks don't feel smooth), but I know to stop repairing when I do. I'll lowball and say I average about a 50/50 when it comes to hitting greats. Not great by any means but if we're being honest you can go soooo long without even getting a check it's basically a non-issue.
---
Not to mention toolboxes exists, so it's not that Ruin itself is even that much of a problem. The pressure and other perks a killer runs makes it great at times.
---
My dead by daylight friends dont watch stranger things, and my stranger things friends dont play dead by daylight. So many good memes, nobody to share them with :(

Dammit I love Mathieu. Actually, scratch that. I love all the devs.
---
I am too a big Robert England fan, but our Freddy is not the iconic iteration, he is the weird half assed scatterbrained reboot Freddy. As such I always image his voice being that of a C-list actor trying to imitate Robert England while being as edgy/ melodramatic as possible.
---
I see this happening everytime the Dead by Daylight twitter posts literally anything.
---
Yeah, but if you don't have a lot of time to grind, then BBQ &amp; Chili is literally the best perk in the game for you because it doubles your blood point gain (before considering survivor puddings). If you sink roughly 1 million BP into getting Bubba to 35 (800k-ish with the rest leftover to actually acquire the perk on another killer), that means every 1 million BP after that effectively gives you a bonus 1 million. Granted, it's not going to be quite x2 when you factor in offerings, but BBQ is the best perk in the game by far for getting BP efficiently if you play killer a lot. And it's an effective perk performance wise as well.
---
Short-term loss, long-term gain. Considering you can easily make a million BP in 10 hrs (?) if you're super conservative, that loss doesn't last long. Granted it doesn't matter now that I assume you've bought it from shrine, but you shot yourself in the foot by not buying Bubba before now if the money wasn't a concern for you.
---
*Cough* Billy and Leatherface *Cough*
---
So, I know someone personally who was not too happy about the influx of new players because of the problems right now with the lobby system. He's a rank 1 and worried about getting matched up with new players, which is a valid worry bc that system is a little broken right now. But I have definitely seen people be straight up assholes about it for no reason.
---
But is it a DANCING CLOWN??????

Ofc the nea has a flash light

THEY DIDN'T GET A SINGLE FUCKING GEN DONE AND THERE WAS 2 OF THEM ON A GEN BY THE TIME I GOT HOOKED, MEAN WHILE I HAD TO SOLO A GEN WHILE THIS GOD DAMN VAUDEVILLE ACT WAS GOING ON DOWNSTAIRS. YOU'RE NOT FUCKING ENTITLED TO WIN, GET OVER IT.

No it's not. That perk is almost useless and only has synergy with tombstone myers.

Oh got it
---
I feel like a movie about the Legion or the Clown would be cool.
---
To be honest, Bill isn't really that altruistic. He only has one perk that's altruistic in nature.
---
Adam has two, Claudette has two, Dwight has two, but not Bill. Which seems really odd, tbh.
---
Generally speaking, if you play killer BBQ (Leatherface) is the best perk in the game for you to get as a new player, followed by Ruin (Hag). BBQ is useful perk during play because it shows you survivor auras after you hook a survivor for 4 seconds, but more importantly, it nearly doubles your BP gain while playing killer. You'll spend about 800k BP getting Leatherface to 35, and every BP after that is essentially doubled (around that).
---
So if you played nothing but killer, by the time you had two characters leveled, you could have had three with BBQ. By the time you had four characters, you could have had seven. Seven, Thirteen. Etc. It doesn't work out to exactly that when you factor in offerings, both yours and other peoples, but it's definitely a huge boost in your BP gain.
---

I don't understand why killers still go try hard sweaty when TWO party streamers get dropped. Like dude let's just enjoy some points. You can kill me thats fine but christ let's all get s few BP before it's over.

God I love ST but I would‚Äôve much rather had Hopper as a survivor, he‚Äôs such a badass.

Newbie here, I just started playing yesterday and got enough points to get BBQ and chili. Do I now just keep leveling a killer until it appears on the web, and is there a certain level it should appear by or is it totally RNG?

I don‚Äôt bother trying to get to red rank anymore because there simply no reason to. There‚Äôs no benefit or reward aside from bragging rights and yes it can be difficult. But it is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to reach red rank as a killer than it is as a survivor.

I want the survivors to get real perks. Why the hell is it fair for killers to get bomb ass powers, and perks with basically every single DLC but just fuck survivors. The last survivor that got good perks that are STILL good, was Jeff. And no one even uses them! MoM was a little too OP, but after Jeff was the only thing worth a damn to use that was new. And now it‚Äôs COMPLETELY useless because not only is it insanely hard to get those protection hit stacks, it‚Äôs also virtually impossible when they don‚Äôt render right because the game doesn‚Äôt count them sometimes. 
---
Janes perks are WORTHLESS. Solidarity isn‚Äôt worth a shit because of healing being so stupidly time wasting in general, Poised is too situational and only really helpful at mid to low rank, and Head On still almost never fucking works. (Surprised, and exhaustion perk that doesn‚Äôt work at least half the time that‚Äôs ignored or bandaided by BHVR cough DEAD HARD cough) 
---
Adam has only two semi decent perks, one literally basically begs for the killer to just tunnel and the other is also insanely situational and inconsistent. And autodidact is freaking worthless. 
---
I‚Äôm sick of this mentality everyone on this reddit has. This game is so unbalanced, so poorly taken care of, it‚Äôs astounding it even works at all. The console ports have it the worst. It‚Äôs hilarious that they think this game in its current state of health, where they literally ignore and even BAN people for pointing out and proving bugs exist, is able to be ported to more platforms.
---
Are you sure the rank 4 wasnt part of a swf?  But yeah, matchmaking is borked.
---
Admittedly, while solo queuing as survivor Ive been matched with a killer up to 12 ranks lower then me,so this is entirely possible.
---
ok so I shouldn't have clicked, I was at episode 6 :(
---
rip Bob
---
Okay I'm tired of repeating myself. First things first OP never mentioned how long they were held there and no one can tell from a screenshot. IF they were held there for a long period of time they can be banned.
---
I found this explanation of bannable body blocking from community manager Peanits on a post from the offical forums asking about bannable body blocking.
---
"Bodyblocking is bannable when it is used to hold the game hostage or grief, such as blocking a survivor in a corner and sitting there for a long period of time just so they can't play. Or sandbagging, where you intentionally jump in from of someone and block their path so the killer hits them."
---
Even if it's not under the category of taking the game hostage it is STILL bannable under griefing. With that said I'll say it again for the people in the back. No one but OP and those in that game know how long they were held there for. If it wasnt long then no it's not.
---
You can use addons.
---
Civilization, a series of strategy games where you build your own empire.
---
I actually am going to do this so I can get more bloodpoints for the whole ST dlc.
---
The Legion. Probably the worst one by far. The best thing they have is Discordance, but even then you still would struggle lmao
---
Ive only heard of games like that in low ranks there bud, wait till you get with players that are actually good.
---
Anyone can do gens and stay hidden against a bad killer, flip the switch where someone skilled and puts lots of map pressure, good luck staying hidden while being useful while doing gens... Also ofc you can just do gens, but your team will die, going for alutristic plays really brings out difficulty as well as Chases. Even if a teamate leads the killer to you, pallets and clever loops keep you alive... That's why they are there. To me it sounds like you sneak around a lot, and that's good but would die easily in a Chase. If you come into a game with 4 gens done by genrushing, isn't that an example of depth and strategy of survivors for getting geared up? 
---
Don't forget hard perks to use like dead hard or difficult killers to use like the nurse.
---
Examples like that and the one you gave of genrushing do in fact show this game was intended to be taken seriously... I think you've contradicted yourself...
---
? I know.
---
I just didnt
---
I'm equal parts pissed and happy that worked. I don't understand
---
I kinda understand that response though.
---
Not saying it was the right response but I mean c‚Äômon... the devs *obviously* care about the game and its community but it must be so fucking hard to please everyone and for 3 years they have been doing their best to do exactly that. 
---
Lets cut them some slack for that comment, it was wrong but the amount of good they do outweighs the bad... in my opinion.
---
not after their release. You didnt even have to Kill 2 People to get their Adept lol. It was stupidly easy to Max out all categories and pip
---
This subreddit is more than cursed, it is meme infected. Shitpost Saturday has become Shitpost Century
---
That was my point. There are several British accents as well. But when I say ‚ÄúAmerican accent‚Äù or ‚ÄúAfrican accent‚Äù you can obviously tell what I‚Äôm referring to even though there are several variations.
---
Just a placeholder date, the devs confirmed Sep 30th isn't the release date.
---
I don't think you'll get banned, unless someone (multiple people more likely) submits a ticket about it you should be fine
---
PS4? PS4 has been doing this to me for over a week. I stopped playing Killer after the Freddy change. (I actually liked him and was really good with him. Can‚Äôt stand him now.) Even when I got back up to rank 9 I was getting rank 17s and such. I asked a few and they were most of the time solo ques, not even in a swf. I felt horrible.
---
&gt;Ive only heard of games like that in low ranks there bud, wait till you get with players that are actually good.
---
Lmao sure newbie. You haven't been around long enough.
---
i literally was asking questions but alright
---
I really like both seasons, hope you enjoy it as well.
---
THEY DO ITS CALLED KILL YOUR FRIENDS, BUT WISH THEY WOULD ADD THIS TO HAVE A FUCK AROUJD MODE WHERE YOU COULD MESS AROUND WITH BUILDS AND JUST TO FUCK AROUND WITH RANDOMS! ALSO MAKE THAT THE MODE WHERE ALL THE KILLERS CAN TUNNEL AND FACE CAMP TILL THEIR HEARTS ARE CONTENT!
---
Dude I'm not going to spend actual real life money on a DLC I'll never use just to get a perk. Besides we weren't crying and bitching that BBQ specifically wasn't there, it was that all the perks in the shrine were garbage
---
I think the best experience I‚Äôve had with the community is being hooked in the basement with the gate open and all 3 survivors rushed to get me out of the basement and body blocked the killer til I got to the gate.
---
Well when people are sending them comments like ‚Äúfix your stupid fucking game bitch‚Äù..........
---
But I have it. People neeed to know
---
Why would you get banned? You can easily prestige in a day if you put your mind to it.
---
Plus, Developers don't give af about steam achievements, no one does really. They have more important things to focus on then measuring a Players achievements. Your friend is wrong, you have nothing to worry about.
---
Thank you , for your answer.
---
It's not. To punish someone you have to prove they've done wrong. You're assuming the worst case scenario that they've been up there all game. The game can be ended so it's not holding the game hostage.
---
I got shit from someone because i killed them off real fast and they were complaining that if i didn‚Äôt kill them off instantly I could‚Äôve gotten more points but my point wasn‚Äôt bloodpoints it was to slow the game down and it work after she died not a single gen complete and a 4k
---
BUT IT DOSNT DO JACK SHIT IF ONE OF YOUR TEAMMATES IN 5 FEET AWAY TRYING FOR THAT HOOK SAVE THAT WILL NEVER COME AND THEN IT DOSNT AFFECT THE KILLER!
---
Yeah they also mentioned Michael and the thing
---
No killer will ever be as good as the Nurse. But so far I'm liking how the Demogorgon is gonna be. I like the idea of being able to teleport through holes in the ground anytime and almost anywhere. But of course once he's released to the PTB we can determine if he's good or bad. But so far, from the looks of things, I'd say he sounds like he's very good and maybe even top tier.
---
Well i use spirit fury, enduring, pop goes the weasel and ruin but yeah you can always play whatever you want and what makes you have fun, gl in your games.
---
what are you talking about?
---
I don't think ps4 has an active enough playerbase for good matchmaking unfortunately.
---
I've gone through six levels so far and nothing. Kill me.
---
No licensed killer has ever been above mid tier, he's probably just saying that to drive up hype.
---
Freddy was considered terrible for two years, Ghostface is just a worse Myers, Leatherface is a worse Hillbilly, Pig is very meh and mid tier, Myers is mid tier and wastes too much time. Too many people get blinded by tier 3 hype to realize how much they waste...
---
&gt;! From the leaked Steam screanshots we see the demogorgon climbing out of a portal-hole thing so I'd guess his power is a nurse-freddy-hag hybrid. meh.
---
\*licks lips at the sound of ghosty toasty leather squeaks\*
---
‚ÄúGet a load of this guy.‚Äù
---
I'm not trying to be rude but I definitely stated TWICE above that we can't tell how long they have been up there and it applies only if they have been up there for a while.
---
I love when I get boldness points while in a locker
---
T Cruise and I get to party?
---
Yeah my bad lol
---
unless you are a good surv
---
Probably because they just want to play the game and don't care about points?
---
You dont play tombstone and tuft of hair if you want to get pips or bloodpoints. It will never give you anything other than a fun game
---
Trapper or Wraith. A bit basic but they get the job done.
---
That's the issue, it's random. It could be that the frogs are messing with the shrine, but chances are it's just very, very bad luck. That's why the shrine should've been adjusted and perks who appeared already should have a lesser chance of reappearing. If there's 100 perks the chance for one to be on the shrine should be 1%. If it was on the shrine in the past 3 months the chance should become lower, maybe only 0.5 and if it appears again some-fucking-how it should be dropped even further for an extended period of time. Or you know.. just not have the shrine and/or expand it? You barely get any shards and the game's bloated with perks.
---
Exactly, we don't know so we have to assume the shortest time period. It's not bannable.
---
BEING OBSESSION WITH NO OBSESSION PERKS FROM EITHER YOU OR THE KILLER MEANS SOMEONE HAS DS
---
If that's the case, not sure.
---
Wraith is gonna be bonging the bell refing the trials
---
WHY THE FUCK AM I CONSTANTLY PLAYING ON COLDWIND FARM AS FREDDY. THE MAP IS FUCKING HUGE AND THE SURVIVORS SPREAD OUT ACROSS IT LIKE A PARASITE AND GEN RUSH MY ASS. IT‚ÄôS BEEN 5 TIMES IN A ROW; GIVE ME ANY OTHER MAP PLEASE
---
She hot?
---
No we don't HAVE to assume anything. Since there is lack of time frame I was giving information in the event that the time frame was for an extended period of time. NOT SAYING THAT IT WAS. AGAIN ONLY OP, THE OTHER PLAYERS IN THAT GAME, ANDTHE KILLER know for sure how long this had actually happened.
---
Its gonna happen.
---
because how dare someone have a negative opinion about a video game they play lol absolute blasphemy
---
This is your fault, I had a game at purple ranks today where we got ruined by nurse, I got 1 and a half gens done, got a save or two and had a chase. Game was short due to a dc. But I managed to get +1 pip. This was with a terrible team. You can‚Äôt blame your team for you not pipping at green ranks. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your team is bad all you have to do is have an alright chase and do 1-2 gems and make a save. Then you‚Äôll easily pip at green ranks. If you‚Äôre on PC add me and I‚Äôll see how good you are because you need to get out of the mindset where it‚Äôs your teams fault not yours. If you‚Äôre so good run the killer round for 5 gens and then escape
---
Imagine saying that while we have leatherface and billy.
---
I really don‚Äôt get ‚Äúthe joy of teabagging‚Äù - Bich I did my job,  sucked at it, I‚Äôm getting out cause I had fun
---
&gt;Go ahead it is all yours  
---
You can save it if you want to
---
&gt;!please get the !&lt;[reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eKv4BEujFU)
---
From what it seems so far, there needs to be a portal there for it to be able to do that, so... Just not do a gen right next to a portal or... Just destroy it beforehand
---
I'm pretty sure you can get contact high from being that close to Quinton. Whatever he's on will fuck the rest of your game up
---
I unlocked B&amp;C levelling up Bubba last week..fml
---
Maybe it‚Äôs your mask
---
Looks like Chucky is about to get looped by Nea
---
they are the same killer 4head
---
Nice.
---
How does sniping give someone an opportunity? As far as opportunity goes they can see where his totems are and break them in a minute or less and they know where he is at all times. Aside from that they are just annoying, does he complain a little too much? For sure, but that doesn't excuse the people sniping him.
---
I recommend Doctor. He can be a bit difficult to use effectively at high ranks, but his entire ability is built around tracking/finding survivors.  This was the hardest for me when I started playing.  He'll help you get into chases more feequently which equals more practice downing survivors, learning mind games, and breaking loops.
---
How come no one can cosplay Nea in her default costume?
---
You're a camper and tunneler as long as you stay in the same match as the survivors. You are supposed to hit each of them once and then disconnect after they heal. Only way to avoid camping and tunneling
---
Hit F to pay respect
---
And it's not bannable. What is happening in this picture is perfectly within the rules.
---
Well tier 3 has a huge lunge length so I never respect pallets because you‚Äôll get a lot of downs you otherwise wouldn‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt swing through. But then again, if you‚Äôd rather chase while respecting pallets you should just play how you wanna play. I don‚Äôt respect pallets on any killer so that‚Äôs how I like to play. Just play how you play, just know that his lunge is very difficult to predict from a survivor standpoint so swing away.
---
Fair enough. I'm not going to lie, I only saw the first 2 saw movies, and wasn't reading the pigs bio when I wrote the post. I always thought she was only a side character in the movies, and I didnt realize in her bio it wrapped it up neatly. I still do think that they could do something for ghostface, since they only got the rights for his mask.
---
I'm not sure about any other licensed killers though. I just mentioned the pig because I didnt think she had much of a backstory.
---
_I really really really like this image_
---
That's actually brilliant. So basically each legion is better at something but less at something else or equal but less at something different right?
---
It's a Doc with Sloppy Butcher and Third Seal while OP has used an exhaustion perk. All we needed is a Deliverance or No Mither and all the statuses would be complete (except Hindered but then Madness wouldn't be a thing because no perks cause Hindered).
---
Yeah I feel like people complain about tru3 a lot more than they watch his stuff lol. Most videos I've seen where Ruin goes down quickly he'll just say "that was a bad spawn" or "they got lucky finding it". The only time he accuses people of sniping is when he *knows* their snipers
---
There‚Äôs isn‚Äôt really a trademark pig outfit. John had his cloak, but the Pig is Amanda, and she wore lots of different outfits. I honestly love that it‚Äôs Amanda and I would hate for it to be any other character. She has such a sad and interesting story, and it makes the most since for it to be her, as she was the only accomplice to not give the victims a chance. She killed
---
sorry but what is "respecting a pallet"? I get its terminology for playing around something but what do you mean by it.
---
Until u get tunneled n die
---
I wasn't even playing and that made my fucking earwax crawl.
---
No there‚Äôs only one legion character on the roster and without any add ons Is the legion we know and hate playing against as survivors but there are common add ons (common because they improve something and nerf something else) like one will have you run really really fast but make it so you can‚Äôt hit survivors or you go out of the power without damaging them and that stage when you just got out of the power is a lot longer so it effectively makes legion a M1 killer that power can get around very easy
---
I responded to his tweet and he said because there was a musical part mid episode (he's talking about the last episode of S3)
---
Yeah. A lot of people who hate on him tend to be toxic or scummy players. For example the guy who is just hurling insults at me every time I make a point and calling me stupid while not presenting any points of his own that aren't easily disproven.
---
I only ever see him call somebody a sniper when he checks their profile and verifies that it's the same person he keeps seeing. Usually they make it known to him as well by wearing the tru3ta1ent shirt in game
---
What research am I meant to do for the complaint ‚ÄúI am now sitting on a worthless mound of Iridescent Shards and Bloodpoints because this licensed chapter will obvious cost real money, meaning that I can‚Äôt spend my shards to get any new content until at least November and I refuse to buy any money costing chapters until they go on sale, meaning that I‚Äôll have no new content until at least mid-October meaning that I‚Äôve gotten no new content for months and will continue to have no new content for at least 2 more months?‚Äù
---
i thought its universally accepted that saying is very wrong? Maybe back in the 50's when psychology wasn't as advanced that could be something someone said but now a days? Get your head out of your ass you doughnut.
---
Jane is fat not 'thicc'
---
The best advice I got while learning hag is to always trap the middle of the killers shack. This so that you are guaranteed a hit regardless of whether they go to the pallet or window.
---
But Plague is DLC
---
That makes much more sense thank you, does vault speed affect pallet breaking speed? So is my Evil Within going to break pallets faster as time goes on or just vault faster.
---
I likey. Here's My attempt.
---
Nurse
---
Tier 4 Stridor: Regular Breathing and Injured is 50% louder.
---
Tier 4 Thanataphobia: A 5% action speed penalty per injured Survivor
---
Tier 4 Nurse's Calling: It reveals healing survivor's auras within 36 meters
---
Nea
---
Tier 4 Balanced Landing: A 30 second exhaustion period.
---
Tier 4 Urban Evasion: 110% Crouch movement speed.
---
Tier 4 Streetwise: 35% Reduced item consumption to you and allies within 12 meters. Persists 20 seconds after leaving the radius.
---
I‚Äôm saving for a killer I‚Äôm pretty close too
---
It‚Äôs a niche perk like half of the other perks
---
Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt turn into a tunnel fest like it did with GhostFace and everyone ended up running DS for a week and the games just sucked and killed the feeling for a new killer that everyone wanted and was tarnished by toxic assholes. PS4 was hell for a week...
---
Personally I have never cared much for stranger things and I dislike the series. However I'm always up for new content and especially content that brings more players. I'm glad stranger things is going to bring a ton of new players to dead by daylight. Always good to see more people enjoying the game.
---
The new killer has potential and opens up a bunch of more possibilities. Fictional horror movie villains are fine I guess but not humanoid monsters according to some of the fan base. I find the demogorgon more believable than Freddy Krueger
---
Until we actually find out what is going to be in the chapter, people‚Äôs complaints are really Not valid because they don‚Äôt know what it will actually entail. 
---
However, you do not need to have watched any of the Saw movies or Friday the Thirteenth movies to criticize the way Amanda or Freddy played. You did not need to know Freddy lore to know he needed changed. In the same way, you don‚Äôt have to have watched stranger things to be able to criticize the new killer or any of the new perks from the Stranger Things DLC (once we know what they actually are.
---
what the fuck
---
What was that? You're clearly a high rank survivor... solid play, no denying that. But what the heck are you doing so low rank that you can get away with that?
---
Skill checks on PS4 are a gamble on whether or not they‚Äôll be smooth that game
---
They are coming, they said PC will have the first roll out then console to be rolled out after if all goes well, and this PTB coming Tuesday they said another test is happening, so fingers crossed!
---
Yeah people have been wanting a monstrous killer for awhile now.
---
Yeah sometimes it feels like you're better off playing with raccoons.
---
Extremely dead raccoons
---
Or when someone dc before game starts :‚Äô)
---
The build requests would be cool to if he analyzed them and paid attention to why he was given them. I understand that there are a handful of people giving him stupid/bad builds on purpose just for laughs, but I've seen genuinely unique builds given to him both on survivor and killer side and he just misuses it and labels it a "bad build" because it doesn't have Ruin or doesn't have Dead Hard, etc., and he plays the builds thinking he has perks like that.
---
I remember seeing one build that was meant to be played around stealth, and he just immediately ran from the killer, tried Dead Harding (he didn't have it) and instantly went down and said the build sucked.
---
oh my fuckin god how
---
And that's ok im not judging your opinion
---
Some say 4k or nothing others will say a 3k or even a 2k is "good".
---
Personally I don't care how many kills I get. I look for 2 things. Did I have fun and did I get 25k or more bloodpoints (before bbq or offerings)
---
Civ is normie tier lmao you can‚Äôt be serious
---
Dude survivors are the real killers in this game. The other day I saw a Nea pulling down all the pallets. She wasn‚Äôt being chased or anything. She just saw the pallets and pulled them down. I‚Äôm pretty sure she was new to the game but I got very angry
---
I think pig. Freddy and maybe billy can help you with starting.try normal speed killers then move to hag and huntress maybe.
---
If dont feel like freddy try trapper, and if not up for luck with pig try doc.
---
I got paired with my friend(killer) 10times in a row coz we were playing at 3am lol just farmed with them streamers til I had none left
---
Sorry, we already have Jeff.
---
Should‚Äôve went 5blinks nurse uwu
---
I'm sorry I guess I don't get where the other members of legion killers would come into play.
---
u should just be able to make a separate account
---
Yep. Basically this.
---
I honestly believe BHVR needs some sort of IQ test before you start. The IQ can be the ranking system or something 
---
There are SO MANY stupid moronic survivors playing that its unreal
---
Nea and Claudette are the best survivors for new players. Self-care and urban evasion help you evade the killer and kill yourself when you don't have many medkits or other supplies you can bring with you. Leatherface has barbecue and chili which is one of the best killer perks in the game. He's worth getting for a couple of dollars just so you can get that teachable early on if you can't get it from the shrine this week
---
The community calls itself toxic mostly for the meme. Sure you have asshole Survivors bullying killers and vice versa. Along with idiots in the post-game chat but on Reddit the community is gray and there's a lot of good memes and cosplay.
---
The Stranger Things DLC seems to be huge for the community because it's a large audience that wasn't previously aware of the game. Stranger things fans who finally get to play as their favorite characters coming to dead by daylight in large numbers.
---
Also camping tunneling and slugging are totally valid ways of playing the game. They are just usually looked down on. Camping implies staying by the hook while a Survivor is on it. Tunneling is ignoring other survivors and just bullying one. Slugging is Downing all of the survivors before hooking anyone. Typically it's done to slow the game down and it is a very valid strategy.
---
Im in this post and I don't like it
---
Tf2 Gang rise
---
He doesn't eat then. He just sucks on those fingers then store them for appreciation.
---
I heard they ban perma banned players again If they ever join the game in another steam account. Idk If It‚Äôs true or not.
---
Baveuse. I love it and use it all the time. Lol
---
Do gens.
---
I‚Äôve been gone for a while and came back to this face camping billy who killed the other 2 teammates just by standing next to their bodies smh... he deserved this
---
Also yes the developers take part in community stuff quite a lot and are very active when it comes to responding to questions and they host regular live streams and Q&amp;As
---
They have events where they take user designed outfits and add them as official cosmetics. They are planning on supporting the game very long-term. And best of all day actually play the game. They also have zero intentions of adding loot boxes.
---
Either way I hope those answers were somewhat helpful and welcome you to the community. Some people are hostile because they don't like stranger things or aren't a fan of non-human Killers for example. But ignore that stuff. It's hard at first but once you get the hang of it I hope you truly enjoy the game.
---
He kinda of was lol
---
Magnum Condoms are there on the addons.
---
Yeah. Everyone can have their own opinions. That's the best part of Being Human. I'm just glad more people have found the game I enjoy so much and I hope they enjoy it as much as I do
---
The amount of pips/blood points/kills, it depends on how you look at it
---
What about it?
---
Well, that‚Äôs the death garden mask, a mask not everyone was able to get. there is a certain stereotype applied to people who use it, and it‚Äôs not a good one haha maybe they thought you were one of those types of people
---
It's really accurate. Meme or not. I mostly play survivor because it's more stressful playing as killer.
---
Make a mistake, survivors thinks its completely fine to be toxic, t bag, clickety click.
---
Make a mistake as a survivor. Wahhhh. Waaaaahhhh, you have to let me live otherwise ur a garbage killer.
---
I'll always think that survivors in this game are the biggest babies I've ever come across.
---
I know it's a game but the anonymity of the internet gives the survivors more leeway to act like a poor sport, something I would guess toxic survivors wouldn't do in real life otherwise.
---
WHY DOES EVERY KILLER IN THE GAME HOVER THEIR HOOKS??!? AND WHY DOES EVERY SURVIVOR I GROUP WITH DECIDE TO UNHOOK ME RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KILLER AND THEN WHY DOES THE KILLER PROCEED TO TUNNEL ME?!
---
EVERY. FUCKING. GAME.
---
One would be slower but can hit survivors that are have deep wound to decrease their timer.
---
One would be slightly faster then normal but vaults slower
---
Bruh fuck the campers good shit
---
You can still get it, I got Deathgarden literally a month or two ago and I still got it
---
try it out, i‚Äôm not sure if they would be able to know it was u
---
This has absolutely nothing to do with the game.
---
this isnt a spoiler, but nice over reaction
---
It's just a simple grammar mistake, literally everyone makes mistakes.
---
Finally someone that loves him as much as I do lol
---
Matchmaking is basically in a death spiral currently. I get the feeling BHVR is currently putting in the bare minimum work to keep it functioning, but they've firmly set their sights on the Dedicated Servers. Once those are firmly implemented things will get better. 
---
But for now it's just an absolute shitshow.
---
The Cannibal*
---
Fuck now I want some fingies
---
Removed please do not show names thank you
---
Whichever one feels the coolest, everyone is all concerned about the ‚Äútier‚Äù of the killer and whatnot, but honestly you can be ‚ÄúS tier‚Äù with any killer as long as you practice and try hard enough
---
fuck the people who shit on the devs. you guys are trying your hardest to bring us a game we all enjoy. i'm so excited for all the changes next month especially the new archives
---
You still have to pay for it and it‚Äôs not really worth it since, IIRC, the playerbase is basically nonexistent and it‚Äôs not really a fun game to play. they probably thought you were flexing and that you were a toxic player, since toxic megs always have that mask.
---
I‚Äôm not an idiot. I know Evil Dead was super popular. I just thought it was funny to think about some survivors are even fictional characters to other survivors.
---
Ochido is a pedophile who thinks loud noises are funny and asks his underage fan girls for nudes so they can play with him on dead by daylight. There's a reason he's been banned on every platform and has to sneak on the game. The developers hates him and the community mostly hates him.
---
Id recommend
---
TydeTyme
---
Tru3Ta1ent
---
Ardetha
---
HybridPanda
---
And Otzdarva
---
Then the survivors will pretty much get a free win. Worst killer offering by far

Oh of course I know it wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near it I wasn‚Äôt being fully serious, what you said is pretty much exactly what I meant and I unluckily got hit with the mob mentality. But that‚Äôs just how Reddit works, whatcha gonna do

Ha I just watched this part like 10min ago
---
Yeah, but if one becomes meta, every sweatlord would just start using the character the perk comes from and it would make for less variety in survivor picks.
---
I got it ages ago but don't play killer much so I still haven't actually got it on anyone yet, feels bad
---
I agree, I always play solo and I will hit red for the first time this season. Having great teammates is great, but a necessity.
---
I dunno about you, but I want biker Kate.
---
I only spend shards on 2700 perks because they give more bloodpoints per shard.
---
Susie would make way more sense as a Survivor, yeah.
---
Come to think of it, it's weird that no Survivors have anything to do with their Killers, isn't it? Not that I'd be cheering for Rin's dad, but maybe she had a best friend...
---
No its just that the moon is directly shining on him, There are what is on the steam page so they are fully real
---
Yes the shinning
---
Mankini clown
---
If they moved the bloodpoints to a different perk, I'd use that other perk in a heartbeat.
---
Honestly just make everyone shirtless
---
I would love to see either Huntress's or legion's story put into movie
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs only vault speed. To break pallets faster you need brutal strength. It‚Äôs a trapper lvl 35 perk unlock that breaks pallets 20% faster at tier 3 (Brutal strength tier 3, not MM).
---
I would have rathered chief hopper
---
100% scoops ahoy is going to be a cosmetic if not already an alternate outfit

Agreed but not at the same time
---
Nah, I can juke the killer the entire match and my team would escape and leave me to die on my first hook.
---
That's my reality. I hate it.
---
There's some weird assumptions going around here. Like you said, if ruin goes down in under a minute I usually hear him saying the person probably spawned right near it which is most likely fact anyway.
---
To me that wouldn‚Äôt be a loss, but it‚Äôs always super irritating
---
I'd say double bloodpoints is the solid part, the fact that it has a decent effect is icing.
---
Tunnel bad but that‚Äôs understandable
---
Why fortnite tho
---
Made with mematic
---
Ah
---
Think it‚Äôs supposed to be patrol
---
yes.
---
Yeah they probably have the same opinion when it comes to killers because of people like you
---
Bubba doesn't have a grill tho, he can't have a cookout
---
It looks like Onryo would straight-up cause natural disasters, but have been adapted into a J-horror device, in which case we're comparing Rin to Kayako from The Grudge.
---
In that case, vengeful spirits absolutely just murder everyone who intrudes on their haunting place, although their first kill tends to be their own murderers. Their motives never made sense IMO, but aside from the technicality where she should only be able to play on the Family Estate (or at least only be able to go against Survivors who have been there) for authenticity, her general inclination to murder makes sense, if not to hook without confirmation the Entity has given her revenge.
---
You know I do but the pun D:
---
Kenny‚Äôs a badass
---
I know I know, but if I hook you, you get unhooked, and then your rescuer uses the Invisibility Cloak from Harry Potter and disappears, you're the only one there and so I have no other target available.
---
Jacket would have a power like Legion I‚Äôd imagine.
---
Agreed lmao
---
r/cursedimages
---
Here
---
The average rank is 10.25, which is exactly where you are.  I know not everything‚Äôs black and white, but this might be necessary for faster waiting times. 
---
Also,  I‚Äôd be more pissed if I was the rank 4. Rank 13s are a bit dodgy at surviving and they can certainly make matches terrible for adequate survivors.
---
Thank
---
Dunno why this is leak flaired, it's from rhe public steam page for the dlc
---
To be totally honest, with the amount of perks we have and very different playstyles even though there's a meta, I think that's a very unlikely scenario.Claudette P3 is basically the best survivor model to run and you still see variety in survivors.  I will however acknowledge that possibility.
---
r/trashy
---
For the second perk, shouldn‚Äôt the distance go down as you level the perk up?
---
Wow, you're so good for going to the exit, running away and coming back just before the time expires.......
---
"allows them to fix bugs" good joke 10/10.
---
‚ÄúNo killer will ever be as good as the Nurse‚Äù don‚Äôt give them ideas...
---
Well, that‚Äôs what it does in theory. In practice, not so much lol
---
i like the groaning sound from under his mask when he gets stunned too
---
When I play at lower ranks on ps4 I feel like I'm playing against three to four killers at once. Half the time I die first hook because they decide gens before friends or a camping killer. I've been getting killers that aren't as toxic the higher up I go in rank but I do want a PC to play just because it's so much better and I think the community on PC isn't as toxic as console
---
I just yelled woah because im genuinely impressed
---
I work third shift and get off at 6AM EST. I sleep as soon as I get home, so I'll be waking up right at the start of the stream. WHY IS MY WORK SO SLOW SUDDENLY AGGH
---
You clearly don't understand. Did I say he should be punished? No. That's not my job nor yours. No one is calling for punishment.
---
... Killers can open doors?
---
Myers small anti-loop thing is his faster vaulting speeds, tier two vaults a window in 1.5 seconds while tier 3 vaults in 1.3 seconds while tier one and all other killers vault in 1.7 seconds. Plus tier 3 has the extended lunge which can trip survivors up. While I love Myers a lot, I do think he‚Äôs just a mid tier killer
---
I‚Äôd say Myers. I know it sounds crazy because how not shit he is. However, his perks are awful together and have zero synergy. Also, they don‚Äôt slow the game in anyway, which he needs to be able to activate his ability. 
---
All of that sprinkled in with the emblem system is total hell. Gens are going rather quickly, fucking you over on Gatekeeper.  Then, his one shot ability is going to net you a much lower chase emblem.  By the time you kill everyone, you‚Äôll most likely one or two hook survivors due to the snowball, and that‚Äôll fuck over your Devout emblem. No bueno.
---
The Carson one is a necessity that i didn‚Äôt know i needed
---
I mean its the only appropriate flair and need to pick a flair
---
People complain about NOED but no one complains when the killer comes around with a Spas-12.
---
Is this real?
---
He... created Jason Voorhees, though.
---
Thicc ends when the belly surpasses bobs. She's thicc.
---
Yeah that's what I mean. I used to play on Ps4, and I recently switched to pc. I don't want to sound like a pc master race, but the difference really is night and day. Even now, my game on ps4 still drops frames when I swing (it's not as bad as before, but it still makes it hard to enjoy the game).
---
IM GUILTY
---
To be fair, I have not, but it was added to my watch list about 6 minutes ago
---
*On the second hook and the survivor keeps struggling*
---
This is where you get sacrificed
---
Yes... and? What right ought people have to intangible concepts? Intellectual property is the biggest meme
---
It‚Äôs really bad. I‚Äôve honestly just lost hope for PS4. It‚Äôs hilarious that they think they can make good mobile and Nintendo ports when they can‚Äôt even take care of the two they already have.
---
Lol I think you need to go back and reread a little bit cause I don't think any of what I said was understood. I stated the circumstances under which it WAS bannable. The time being the unknown which pretty much decides that again ONLY OP, THE KILLER, AND OTHER SURVIVORS know that.
---
This is fantastic! I wonder if we can find props that are on the ground and standing up so we can get measurements in two directions.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
wraith might be the best killer of all in my opinion. especially if you have the addons that make him move faster while cloaked, it makes him more fun to use as well as lethal. zooooooooom
---
Honestly wait times for me as killer have been pretty damn good lately. My lobbies are near instant tonight.
---
‚ÄúNoooooooooooooooooo‚Äù - Bill
---
*Thunder Strikes*
---
You could just ask them directly via their support page
---
I highly, highly recommend it. It‚Äôs actually on my list of ‚Äúhorror films to write a paper on.‚Äù It‚Äôs unique, but it‚Äôs very culty/campy (so probably not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea). It can be cheesy at times, but it‚Äôs tons of fun to watch, and there‚Äôs not really anything like it (even Phantom of the Opera).
---
Damn what kind of black magic you got and can I get some?? LOL. I‚Äôve sat in queue time for 20+mins just to get a lobby with one person who left after 5 mins.
---
yes
---
That's why I said Get the fuck out of dodge as Unbreakable and Left behind are used to get himself out of trials should he be the last person standing and or left to die by his teamates BT yeah is used to help other get away from the killer should they camp whoever's on the hook.
---
I hate the demigorgon now
---
I kinda feel the same except I‚Äôm on vacation in Hawaii so the timezone works out that when I wake up at 7:30 to get ready for the day the stream starts half an hour later and this day can‚Äôt go by quick enough!
---
It will be [here.](https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight) It hasn't happened yet.
---
You want it so you have to be closer to the survivor-obsession with each upgrade?
---
Yeah man fuk em lol
---
I just get on my phone and do stuff until it loads in. Goes a lot faster when you don't pay attention to it
---
Don't worry. These tier 4 perks would only have small buffs that shouldn't be too noticeable. The main objective here is to be a start for survivors not be considered purely as skins.
---
You think this is funny?
---
Me: \*levels up Bubba after 2 months waiting for bbq in shrine\*  
---
Game: \*wait for me to unlock bbq on my main to put it in shrine\*  
---
True story. I'm sad.
---
Thank you and take your updoot
---
Ain't no Valley low enough
---
Wait, so you don't kill anyone? I don't follow. Why don't you kill anyone?
---
when people were decent enough to not instantly die, but not so good you end up not killing anyone. That's the most fun.
---
So... at least 2k 2 escaped, and if you manage to kill all 4, they better fix at least 4 gens
---
Entity: "Trapper and Wraith... deadliest of enemies, but slaves under my power"
---
Don't play wraith but when you uncloak try to body block the survivor as much as you espicially block windows and pallets while you uncloak
---
nothing will keep you away from him, not even physics
---
Imagine if the mori is the default dance but lethal
---
I think this could potentially go on forever, time to watch mk again
---
In low ranks wraith will stomp survivors because most low ranks don‚Äôt understand looping and rely on hiding more. So if you just get right up on them and uncloak they take off but go down because they just don‚Äôt understand. In high ranks once the survivors here your bell they will be looking for your shimmer and take off to a pallet before you even get a chance to uncloak and once your being looped your screwed because wraith has no way of breaking a loop. With his speed buff after uncloaking you can get some cheeky uncloak around a wall and sprint around the corner and get a smack but once they make it to a pallet or t wall just cloak and go find some one else. You will have to rely on catching some one off guard and out of reach of a pallet. Also I‚Äôm pretty sure you can still body clock while cloaked and can trap people while un cloaking for a free hit. It‚Äôs been a long while since I‚Äôve played wraith and this was back when I played console before spirit dropped and I went to her for her sick mind game potential.
---
How does being able to see your own scratch marks help at all?
---
ü§£
---
True, but it depends what gen it is that's being duo'd.
---
Hopeing
---
I got a sick bodyblock on a selfcare Claud today. That felt good
---
you realize that they were all in it together and there were no BM involved? not everyone is toxic
---
Nah, I said "hello friends" in the pre game chat and they started cussing at me, they knew I wasn't toxic
---
I ship it.
---
Hey, I grew up on 80s horror, 80s scifi (especially the full moon stuff), and used to go to Rocky horror fairly often... Camp is no stranger to me.
---
Should just play on Xbox/PS4 where no one gets banned for anything on any game
---
you can do many things in KYF, but I haven't seen killer being displayed with the survivors like that before so I assumed they did it the most reliable way
---
it‚Äôs so good honestly. a lot of people seem turned off by it, but it is so fun to watch, and I love the aesthetics in old films like that (and the way the film itself looks from the different type of cameras they used to record)
---
I‚Äôve seen it plenty of times on PS4. Maybe it‚Äôs not as common on pc for whatever reason, but it‚Äôs definitely not unheard of. That‚Äôs how DBD be: sometimes, it‚Äôs just the game.
---
Report his messages. He will get communication ban for it.
---
Thanks
---
THE FUNNY THING IS YOUR STORY ALSO IS THE FATAL FLAW IN THE ARGUMENT OF "IT'S TAKING 32 SECONDS OF SURVIVOR TIME REGARDLESS THIS LETS THAT OTHER SURVIVOR DO SOMETHING ELSE." IF SHE HAD BEEN HEALED IN 16 SECONDS SHE GETS AN EXTRA HIT, BUT NO, SHE HAD TO TAKE LONGER AND STILL TAKE UP SOMEONE ELSE'S TIME AND GETS HERSELF DOWNED FOR BEING A DUMBASS.
---
STOP RUNNING SELF CARE YOU SELFISH DOOFUSES. UNLESS YOU'RE IN MY KILLER LOBBY THEN PLEASE DO.
---
Whats wrong with a survivor bodyblocking a killer?
---
But but but this literally caused a week of anxiety for me!!!
---
He can be like a mix of Freddy and the doctor.
---
Quentin really need some outfit, like a paper bag to cover his face
---
Quentin really need some outfits, like a paper bag to cover his face
---
Nothing, and hes not complaining that the survivor was bodyblocking
---
I consider this cyber bullying, he obviously doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.
---
I retract my statement and now I‚Äôm annoyed that, if they‚Äôre free, why do you have to go out of your way to download them when with hag and doctor they‚Äôre just there? Been forever since I bought all available killers on Xbox and I just got the game on ps4 so I just assumed I had to pay for her, I‚Äôm a fucking idiot lol
---
I've finally realized why I hate this "meme format" so much. It's because Lisa is probably one of the most unlikable characters in the whole show and she's pretentious as fuck. I associate people who make these memes with Lisa being pretentious.
---
In my Dwight Schrute voice: *false*.
---
Survivor rule #8000000: if you play like the remorseless killer you're meant to be your mom should be insulted.
---
Why didn't you leave?
---
Yup
---
Hmm, alright lol
---
Nah my required perks are thanatophobia enduring brutal strength and bamboozle/spirit fury
---
If a survivor is awake against Freddy, he can just wait at a gen.
---
The killer can your footsteps
---
PogChamp! Welcome to the dark side! :D
---
Have you not seen the horrible matchmaking lately?
---
I feel like going up against a good nurse is the intention of the game. I feel you on this one.
---
A character is nothing more than an idea, though. A concept.
---
I had a game once, looped the killer for ages. "Why the fuck aren't gens being done?" I say to myself, the fourth pallet crashing down on the killer, but he downs me anyway.
---
Turns out they were all working alone on separate gen. In the space of 5 seconds, the last three gens pop.
---
Best feeling ever.
---
Yes. Once all the gens are done, killers can open a door and force the EGC to start.
---
What did people complain about exactly? This was not made clear in your OP.
---
Exactly what I thought, would be a much easier way to find the hatch, spot traps if its a trapper or a hag and to find totems as well as used/unused pallets.
---
Its not holding the game hostage because the game will end eventually it is sweaty and would be annoying but its not holding it hostage since the collapse has started. The other survivors are free to leave and the last one WILL die when time runs out.
---
Since the demogorgon is released, this sub becomes stranger and stranger.
---
Hook camping already has a solution, its called not rushing into save in an unsafe situation, and instead doing gens.

---
Cool?
---
The time for the entity to appear sh OJ ukdnt start if the killer is within a large radius of the hook.  Solves is really fast
---
I can think that too.
---
If he can crouch, I‚Äôm going to piss my pants every time lmao
---
I only find it fun because it doesn't happen often on console. Usually everyone gets demolished or 1 guy gets the hatch, but it's still a different experience. I also love stunning them mid blink even though it usually doesnt stop them.
---
i love this concept so much!!! it can reward you for playing your fav survivor :,)
---
Killer itself is intresting. Perk 1 is useless, Perk 2 could be ok but is it them picking themself up or when someone else does it or both? and perk 3 is op.
---
Hook camping is not an easy way to rank up, it's a guaranteed loss if you're going up against rank 1 - 10. Anything above, the bar is set so low to rank up that one bad hook camp won't discourage someone to stop playing the game.
---
Lol I just got out of a game where I was a rank 12 with rank 16-20s with a rank 20 doctor who just shocked us all match.  -_-
---
Hook camping isnt an issue the killer gets less rank if they do it due to being in hook proximity and it allows you to rush gens.  It's a horrible strat bad killers use but not a real issue.
---
Meg, Quinten and Nea. God awful
---
You're making it sound like you're miles ahead in rank, OP
---
by your logic, nothing should be owned ever, because everything that ever was, is or will be was just an idea.
---
I'm just going to assume I'm getting hard wooshed here and missing a meme. Have a nice day.
---
I hope you are fucking kidding but in the case not
---
Fuck You
---
Exactly, so why not punish the killers for doing it and reward the survivors to focus on gens? Makes perfect sense to me. I also like the suggestion above to make the time for entity appear a lot slower for every second they're in the vicinity.
---
I mean hey! At least there was no devour hope... right?
---
There are very few killers it seems, and it's currently dead hours.
---
Honestly with how hard survivors dab on killers or get rump ravaged when they lose, I can't blame them.
---
To win you have to know what you are doing and to win is to have fun.
---
Haven't played dead by daylight in a while but When I played Friday the 13th I thought it was much more fun
---
I may be going out on a limb here but I think it's safe to say that the majority of DBD players aren't in the rank 1-10 range....
---
Its fun but I absolutely suck at it because every nurse Ive played against was either god or garbage so i dont know how to play against them properly besides double back
---
For the first perk, i thought itd be an interest choice if people were doing a Hex build with Ruin, Huntress L, Devour, ect. And for perk 2, it can be both. It reveals the one who is picked up or picked themselves up. And i could always adjest the time on the 3rd perk. I was just imagining a reverse Borrowed Time
---
I thought the rework was making it to where everything costs less BP?
---
Don't fall for the bait... Don't fall for the bait... Don't fall for the bait... Don't fall for the bait... Don't fall for the bait...
---
First time fortnite has made me smile
---
For Survivor I usually have the fastest matches in the afternoon, usually like Noon through four. Generally as the evening goes on matches take longer and longer and I switch to killer. These are Eastern times btw.
---
The problem is actually having the time to game in the afternoon.
---
God dammit.
---
I'm taking the piss, but he doesn't seem to know the general layout of that middle building, there was 2 instances he could've jumped off the walk way up top between the broken railings when you went for the top window jump and met you at the bottom. Well played nonetheless.
---
This guy is for sure living under a bridge
---
P3 Meg here: I try to not exit until I know the remaining survivors have a good chance of getting out.
---
But booty poppin‚Äô on the LINE of escaping is childish. Just leave. Or step out of the gate and twerk for a more fair shot to the killer. Lol.
---
He works incredibly well with chili and pop
---
Dream pallets is my favorite but snares work really well if you know what you're doing.
---
Dream pallets do not really change anything, you're an m1 killer... try not to give away that you are looking a fake pallet.
---
Snares are interesting. Hold most of them until chases, put the rest in front of common vault spots so they force a medium vault instead of letting them get a fast one. The rest of your traps put on loops as you're chasing a survivor, then bloodlust on pallets. As long as it isn't completely safe, should be easy. This is why snare freddy is any good.
---
Fake teleport when running to a gen if A. You're in a chase and cant apply pressure but know there are survivors (discordance, fcked skill check, surv, etc...) B. They're running towards a gen and you can perhaps cut them off (this ones actually a real report and not faking lol). C. They have LoS of the gen and can see you teleporting, creating a mind game that you can use to your advantage. 
---
The addons that decrease action speed are incredibly strong, forcing survivors to wake up or to take the debuff both slow down the game dramatically.
---
Focus on your gens, freddy has a similar playstyle to other gen control killers. He doesnt end chases fast but his ability to protect gens is the best out of the cast imo.
---
My build is: ruin, pop, bbq, save the best for last. 
---
Situationally i swap stbfl for franklins or enduring, depending on how I'm feeling.
---
Red ranks freddy main.
---
I only dislike self care for the fact that it fucks up dropping pallets. Also I like to run meme builds so yknow
---
You're ADORABLE!
---
We had almost all the Princes duking it out while we were in a magical mansion watching it on TV, and on e Demagorgon was the last one standing with lowered HP we kicked his ass.  
---
Make the Princes angry at each other and watch the bitch slaps commence.
---
He should talk to Cartman then.  Heard his Tenorman chili was fire.
---
Are you talking like a legions killer instinct type effect or maybe a built in bloodhound? Or something else entirely? Would make for an interesting mix up either way.
---
&gt;I came in just before they introduced the rank system...
---
You mean the levels. Rank has always been in dbd.
---
Regardless you're still too new to know what I'm talking about
---
I'll give her a shot. Is doctor very good? Why do you use him to farm?
---
Perhaps preemptive ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù?
---
Eh, im the type of guy who likes to fully prestige and get max perks on every killer(Already have all perks on my main ace so dont see the point)
---
So far i have nearly 2k hours and have 7 killers max prestige with 3 with all perks
---
So yeah i can say its a long and tiresome grind
---
You are nitpicking and biased, bye bye, I win!
---
You could definitely throw off iron grasp and unrelenting for perks to help wmyou with chase/detection. I'd take off iron grasp in favor of iron maiden and unrelenting off for nurses calling or hex: ruin.
---
Not really relevant to the topic
---
Agreed. And easy to do. Make some of the better addons part of the base power. Just like they added old windstorm to Wraith. Just better ones.
---
If this DLC does well, stranger things might give a nod or two to DbD in season 4, I don't think it'll go that deep, but I'm sure there'll be an Easter egg
---
Do you main Jane by any chance?
---
Agitation is better than Iron Grasp in my opinion. Also you might want to consider Sloppy Butcher instead of Unrelenting as it'll keep Thanataphobia lasting longer.
---
Freddy and huntresses would still use it. I would hope that removing the bloodpoint gain would shake the meta up a bit.
---
Just logged on, gonna play killer to help.
---
https://newfastuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wW426yD.png
---
I think the power has to do with teleporting across the map based on some info we got like how he could go through the upside down and burrow through anywhere in Hawking's that's what I think his ability will be
---
I would laugh my ass off if they made a bipedal Scooby to run around as, with Shaggy as his wingman of course.
---
too add on to this good comment.
---
i play pig with Enduring, bbq, whispers and Monitor&amp;abuse and doing pretty well. the addons i use are combat straps and video tape since i believe its the best addons for her. the best tips is to crouch at loops and use the ambush attack to go around the loop to catch the survivor of guard. if the survivor is smart they will leave the loop if you crouch so if you hear them leave go for standing up again to hopefully get a hit.
---
I just hate when i play killer i never respect pallets and i got idiots that teabag cause they stunned me but i end up downing them soon after anyways
---
See I'm looking to determine everyones heights, and a bunch of other dumb shit, in addition to getting a feel for it to play better.
---
Damn the furthest I've ever made it from 1M is to lvl 36 but I enjoy the grind so it's not a chore for me. Inb4 everything costs less but the web is made bigger equaling to the same amount of bp input.
---
Wait
---
I mean, I just like seeing those limping icons on the bottom left.
---
and spirit is like the second best killer in the game far above billy but still far below nurse so. she needs a change to be less braindead for the killerplayer. she has a skill floor that comes with general knowledge but once you pass that she is fucking busted as shit and easy as shit to play.
---
Don‚Äôt forget deep wound from BT
---
Survive with friends. Group teams
---
which ghostface does DBD use though? any of those, or just a different ghostface
---
"It's when you vomit on people?!?!!?"
---
I think somewhere in Montreal.
---
They use their own original character, since BHVR got the rights to the Ghostface mask from Fun World, and not the rights to the Scream movie series.
---
Back when I didn‚Äôt u sweat and the teachable system I stupidly made all three of the hutresses perks teachable now they get in the way of the perks I really want
---
So are you going to link it? 
---
Because I can pull up a developer stream of not_Queen and M.Cote explicitly saying body blocking is no longer a reportable offence, and of you're just talking out your ass than I won't bother.
---
Lmaoo
---
How is he going to voice a Demagorgon
---
Oh snap, you're right
---
It's not so much that it gets to me every time. But I do see it enough that I felt like saying something. As you said though it's just a game.
---
Not wanting to be an asshole but
---
I think you meant A Nightmare on Elmstreet :)
---
That's what, nearly 60 seconds of doing near on nothing? You're going to feel that when you climb those ranks. It may well piss you off into falling for the tunnel bait if someone uses deliverance in your face as well, then when you catch them they hit you with that DS and waste even more time, in short, you're giving away gens.
---
I suspect this is a troll I've fallen for here, but in case not \^

What?  I didn‚Äôt downvote you. I don‚Äôt care that much to downvote people.  All I had to do was say what I had to say. 
---
But I said what I said. And YOU came here with that comment that didn‚Äôt contribute or have a solution or explain much.  You could have said what you‚Äôre saying now in a separate thread now ‚Äúyou act like your miles‚Äù lmfaooo boy if you don‚Äôt go somewhere with your smartass comments lmao
---
You put on scratched mirror with an addon to increase stalking rate? (Generally confused)‡≤†_‡≤†

If you know how the bloodweb works then you can maximize the amount pretty well

Lol

And looking, you‚Äôre the one downvoting me lmao thankfully I don‚Äôt care if some nuisance downvoted me
---
IF HE‚ÄôS ON PLAYSTATION (AND MAYBE XBOX AND STEAM I REALLY DON‚ÄôT KNOW) YOU CAN GAMESHARE KILLERS. EVERY KILLER/SURVIVOR MY FRIEND BUYS MY OTHER FRIEND GETS THEM TOO. OP IS STILL KIND.
---
It was just a glitch encountered when I had my perks opened and my friend switched to the killer. I could see whatever he switched to.
---
Really wasn't anything bad.
---
HEY! Quentin is very ... helpful with finding emergency med kits. I love him but they fucked his model up so bad. He looks like a crack addict
---
Nea is that you?
---
*sad Michael noise*
---
I checked out some of your comments, to see what type of person you are on reddit and 1. You‚Äôre rude and an asshole to pretty much everyone. 2. You bring up people downvoting you a lot and why they do and it‚Äôs like some big deal to you. And i was just at your comment section for a few seconds... I wonder how many times you‚Äôve said that lol. 
---
Oh and a lot of deleted messages from you after getting downvoted into oblivion.
---
The point is that people that don't play SWF are in for an unfun experience. 
---
Imagine getting chased and as you're about to vault a window your random teammate pops the gen and you get hit, and that's when playing solo survivor is **already** a miserable experience as it is.
---
You wont find stranger things elsewhere
---
that's John Rafael though

[Stops moving with malicious intent]
---
I actually believe that the American they have is papa from season 1
---
Its Demogorgon, not Demi-Gorgon. Also its because kids are kids, they dont really know or care for that matter. Its a scary monster, hence they compare it to their scariest encounter in D&amp;D.
---
Also, they never sad only humans, but only humanoids, theres a difference. Their model needs to be walking on 2 legs and have 2 arms.
---
I'm only just now watching the series because of the dlc coming out, and right now Steve's still a dick. I know he gets a redemption arc, but I'm going to kick his ass for all his past sins and NOBODY can stop me

he‚Äôs probably the worst killer in the game right now. his instadown isn‚Äôt really usable against competent survivors unless you have double charge time addons and/or play with your food. he absolutely needs buffs
---
So he watched literally the entire show
---
Including the part where a 18 years old guy cuts and puts his hand inside a girls leg to take off a slug made of meat and bones and then she tells him to stop so then she can do It herself
---
And he says it's too childish because there is a 2 minutes scene of singing in the last episode? (That was purely for comedic effect and in my opnion it worked pretty well) 
---
I dare say ST has more Gross and terrifying moments than the entire Halloween franchise (most of the kills are pretty much Just stabing and suffocating) 
---
This guy is Just wrong
---
Disclaimer: I'm not saying halloween is bad or childish, i love the franchise and i'm only using It as an example
---
I'm on this new kick where I'm relentlessly positive.
---
I think it's helping.
---
well then everything people have said about "ghostface dying" is thrown the hell out the window, now then.
---
cheesus, can you remove your manlet face outta here. i ignored the pic with Nea but now that, idgaf for -karma, why are you karmawhoring with your mug here? you are not even cosplaying ffs.
---
Not according to the DBD lore. Nobody ever found his body.  
---
The thing about the Entity is that it can't actually use dead people. If it could, it would just go grave-robbing every now and then and its job would be way easier.
---
I love Steve so much and Nancy is lit but I would honestly take Hopper over both of them. Love that man
---
Trapper confirmed to be Donald Trump
---
Oh yeah I forgot its only T3, ur right. But its not just iri king, u can use obedience as well
---
i‚Äôm sorry i‚Äôm quite new to the slang- what‚Äôs a bubba??
---
In case you didn't see before I can neither run Ruin, Pop, STBFL, nor Discordance. I'm new-ish.
---
Leatherface
---
"Your game sucks" wow that got personal quick
---
OH YEAH thank u
---
I just wanted to share my awesome day with a lot of cosplayers and mathieu cote. Why do u feel to bitch about that?
---
Eh, there are stranger things.
---
I mean, the first perk is there for killers who use Ruin and such. Like if a team of survivors started looking for totem, they wont know which ones real and would wind up wasting time on totems. The second perk works both ways. Third perk is like a form of opposite Borrowed Time to help prevent farming n such. I could adject the time and/or radius
---
On the flipside, it's an unfun experience for the killer to have their perk essentially taken out of the game because of SWF communicating with each other. The issues go both ways.
---
I could see this leading to a fair few rage quits tbh, can also see most people quitting out vs this new killer if the map is lerys.
---
I brought streamers as Bubba the other night, was gonna just goof and farm some points, but the survivors were toxic idiots who flashlighted me if I came within 20 feet of them. Like, God, Bubba just wanted to hang out
---
Stop being an ass, theres nothing wrong with them posting.
---
To be honest I didnt read it fully. Well I guess brute force, good for ending chases quickly. Monitor and abuse is a classic.
---
Boy I'm glad you don't balance games. You may as well just add "every unhooked person is affected by Borrowed Time.
---
thank you!!
---
The rule was actually "No non-humanoids", no "No non-humans"
---
The rule is not lore-based or aesthetic-based. The rule was tech-based. All animations are tied to a humanoid skeleton.
---
I'm not just on about you I'm on about the circle jerk on this post
---
Where did you see it tho, they said they‚Äôll release info on him Thursday not today
---
Uh huh and what about the survivor rules of not bringing items, not having self care, not having borrowed time, not having any exhaustion perks, not playing in a SWF group, not 'gen rushing', not bodyblocking at the exits, etc etc. I could go on but you see that it does in fact work both ways- oh wait silly me doing any of these things does make you toxic!
---
I was going to post something similar. I always let the first token go to work out for definite if they have BBQ then I play smart with the rest for endgame. So many times I have been able to complete the final gen unmolested because Distortion hides me from BBQ and I don't have to get in a locker.  
---
It also hides your scratch marks so great if you run to a save and it triggers. Sometimes I think people only focus on 1 aspect of a perk and miss a lot of other things you can do with it or the information it provides.
---
Ohhh you hyping me up dude! Will do
---
r/perkbydaylight is for custom icons, not killer ideas
---
Woah, you're actually insane. I'm not even going to continue this further, because you're the type of person that contributes to the toxicity of this community. You're one of those people...wow 
---
You seriously have mental instability issues, and I'm not going to try to have a civil conversation with you. You really need to relax and realize that people can have different opinions on subjects, that doesn't mean they're attacking you or making fun of you. 
---
God bless and I hope you see a professional sometime soon, you really need to.
---
so that's why most of them are worn-out!
---
My bad.  Their reasons are their own.  I personally like him
---
I may have an explanation 
---
 When playing on consoles you have to buy the ‚Äúspecial edition ‚Äù of the game 
---
This might include the hag,doctor and nurse‚Äôs chapters while the huntresses is still her own free thing for some reason.
---
Funny how you call the devs "shitty killer mains" when you can literally watch a stream of a dev getting steamrolled and bullied by a group of survivors from about a year ago. Killer mains, indeed.
---
As I was playing Bubba on the X box One, a guy said he would beat me up if he ever see me in public. I reported him and hopefully he got an big ban. This was an year ago
---
Btw, they have to pay netflix money, not the other way around.
---
Am I the only one who thinks Jane is an obese wale with cow thighs?
---
No problem
---
 I‚Äôm not entirely sure if that was sarcastic or not
---
someone posted some leaks earlier 
---
we know that steve will have some support perks that let him unhook people and then have them not leave scratch marks
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
while nancy has some more aggresive perks like one that gives her boosts if she repairs a specific generator on the map
---
I mean come on! how can you  not have watched it :D !?
---
go there, press "create post" and check flairs.
---
This sub was actually made before "custom icons" were a thing people made. It was originally made for custom perks, characters and chapters
---
What the actual fuck
---
cause i have a migraine rn that lasts two days in a row and i hate your face with that ugly sharpie of a beard. cause you karmawhoring with your mug that has nothing to do with dbd content or is pretty. cause you're a "Nea main" and i hate survivor mains. cause there's some truck outside or whatever machine working and driving me crazy with that loud ass sound. cause i hate it that you got to go that event and i couldn't cause it's fuck kilometers away from me and i have to get visa that I'd have to do for money with no guarantee that i will even get it cause US decided it's good to put sanctions on Russia and make literally whole world hate my country with bullshit insane propaganda. especially with gays as we don't have gay, bi, trans people, gay bars and as if someone fukin stones gays to death on streets like they do in Muslim countries.
---
yeah, i hate you for all of that cause of your smug manlet face and karmawhoring with nothing to pictures but some cool people that actually do something.

I genuinely worried for epileptic killers back when the flashlight was still a blinding white screen.
---
My point exactly. They fell for the simplest mind games, and are bad at their own game. Hence why they cater to them.

there is nothing wrong with me being mad about karmawhoring
---
I KNOW RIGHT I WANT A NON RANKED ONLINE KILL YOUR FRIENDS...WITHOUT FRIENDS
---
Dream pallets. Literally all you need. üôÑ
---
In that case run remember me. You can‚Äôt rely on a totem. Always tell yourself that. A totem leaves potential for you to lose a perk entirely. Not running noed just makes you a better killer. I promise.
---
Huntress pretty because she  H U S B A N D
---
I love the fact my shitpost I made in 2 seconds is starting arguements over how thicc Jane is.
---
I'm hesitant to use them as I like the slow the dream snares put. Do dream pallets notify me when someone slides over them similar to how dream snares work?
---
I‚Äôll surely watch it , the plot seems really dark and interesting !
---
Except my point is that they aren't killer mains. If anything, they *might* be survivor mains.
---
Even so the demo is the least humanoid of them all. It has double jointed legs like a kangaroo and elongated arms like a great ape.  If it is still in the humanoid spectrum it is really pushing it.

---
Just be glad it‚Äôs this sub and not r/dbdgonewild.
---
It just takes no skill. That's plain and simple. And you cant continue to run it, but when you climb up those ranks, and survivors cleanse your totem, well it becomes a wasted perk slot.
---
It all makes sense now
---
They said they would never do a clown
---
They probably made a deal where in exchange for rights they get a % of profits. Either way Behaviour is profiting off of netflix in one way or another. If not absolutely directly then bipartisanly via the franchise
---
hahhah, my husband is German and we're literally waiting for fukin cunts in this government to let me move. last year they refused my visa cause apparently i lied to them when they called mid day when i was busy and asked bullshit questions where i mixed up dates of events i was about to attend. i had to do some voodoo shit through Italian embassy to actually go visit my beloved.
---
Hiding those rank 20s off to the side
---
Lol ironic that you said you didn't want to get in on the argument but your the one turning it into an argument. 2 people had a discussion and reading it neither was condescending they both just made valid points.   
---
Distortion isn't must have and their are other perks like Spine Chill that can be just as useful. However you are wasting a lot of time if you run to a locker every down or you want to heal but don't in a killers aura when you don't know if they have Nurses. Kurokabau just made one mistake mentioning discordance and you then jumped on them and continued it even after Kurokabau held their hands up that they made a mistake.
---
I think I can understand why people like you dont get in our country üòÇ
---
No DCs + 4 BBQ stacks + gen grab (if playing Pig) is usually enough for me to say the game was good
---
and yeah funny how your government doesn't want me there with my master's degree in philosophy and many useful skills when even a man who pays taxes waits for me there but yet wants the dirty immigrants who can only steal and rape cause they don't know better :D I'm like amazed
---
It's about as close to horror as Stranger Things.
---
Hardest part would be how to get Scooby in and what would be the killer.
---
Yeah that's still not free sweetie
---
I believe that was metaphor.
---
When I first started playing bubba some guy got mad at me for playing a killer who could one-shot people.
---

---
I know we‚Äôre in the minority but I‚Äôm in the same boat with you. I want peak Babysitter Steve, complete with yellow rubber gloves and sunglasses &lt;3
---
That‚Äôs DBD for you
---
I already have BBQ
---
I did consider that so I get that aspect. But it‚Äôs astounding how long it takes for even a small patch to be implemented. I‚Äôve reported so many bugs and issues with video and everything only to be told the same copy paste answer and then never see a fix. Like there‚Äôs literally a section of map on the new Badham maps where Hag traps can be triggered from under them. Garage house with the red truck. If you but traps in the basement below the garage and side path to the backyard, you can trigger them from inside the basement. Reported it, gave video, didn‚Äôt even get a response. 
---
It‚Äôs just ridiculous that bugs from YEAR ONE still exist and have never even been attempted to be patched. And several also go ignored and not even acknowledged.
---
I stink as Killer. 8/10 times.
---
I mean you lay off when you've got the game in your hands. If you ram them into the floor you'll black/ safety pip if you kill em too fast.
---
Playing with them gets you more bp (whole point of killer lately since there's like no challenge) and emblem progress if you're looking for that
---
Could also be something like 37.5% so it's 150% total. Having the extra token or having it count hooks instead might entice slugging or tunneling more, but who knows. I still think it would be a good incentive to get Bubba more attention
---
Good job behavior, implement a perk that literally tells everyone to NOT DO THE MAIN OBJECTIVE AT ALL. Disgusting.
---
At least you aren‚Äôt exposed...!
---
Yeah, maybe put them in an Upside Down cocoon.
---
IT IS 2000.
---
Well, those toolboxes aren't cheap
---
It is if you just work for then but sure go off ig
---
Yea, he feeds them with his comments about them so they are empowered to continue. Can't blame him for reacting honestly it just hurts to see, if he had a laugh about it they would probably get bored of harassing and go shoot themselves or whatever.
---
Hmm. That could work except it would change the perk by modifying percentages.
---
RUN TUNING GUIDE + BEAST MARKS AND BUBBA WILL BE FUN.
---
Scooby obv
---
Its just one Level you have to skip tho.
---
As an Ace (and Ash ) main, it would be nice to have something like a guaranteed Very rare or ultra rare instead of very rare or lower plus an 100% chance for second add on. The other two peeks would take some work though.
---
If you aren‚Äôt playing Dead by Roblox are you even a real g4m3r?
---
Or in that case, may I suggest Clock Tower?
---
I HAVE 350 HOURS TOTAL AND 90% OF THAT IS ON SURVIVOR, AND THAN I'M MATCHED AGAINST SURVIVORS WHO HAVE 2000-3000 HOURS AND ARE WAY HIGHER RANK THAN ME WHAT THE FUCK
---
Saaaaame. I got the game a few weeks ago. Dumped most of my BP into Bubba and Ghostface to get Tremors and Chili because I was reading they were rare to the shrine. RIP.
---
Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.

He has a cool design, but I feel that he wouldn't translate very well to the game, since in CT2 he's a mostly invulnerable slow character.
---
With Bobby/Dan Barrows, we have his insane teleporting habilities, also that he can move faster.
---
How's that advertising ? I just wanna know if its normal to get a hit like that, its not a highlight etc. or am I saying once go to my twitch subscribe look at me etc. no ?
---
Do...Do you know what a 4k is?
---
The idea behind it is interesting, but also doesn‚Äôt make sense because survivors are being punished for doing what they‚Äôre meant to do, generators. This perk makes it so you WANT Survivors to complete gens.
---
 The way around the perk is just 99% gens to avoid potentially screwing a teammate over.
---
 I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna stay 30secs, that‚Äôs seems a bit too much, maybe 15 seconds ? Idk
---
Always get this Trump kid and the kid from Brightburn mixed up lol
---
I like this idea, it encourages maining a survivor for their perks and not just everyone running claudette because she's sneaky.
---
her veins also pop out and it's kinda scary
---
I've always thought the basement chest should have an extra rare item, or an item with an add-on.
---
A really cool feature would be if it was an item that a survivor dropped in the killer's last match
---
Jimmy Barnes should actually be a DLC survivor! Who's with me?
---
Nonono, it's the David King experience featuring Jason.
---
You can never be sure that the killer isn't suddenly going to start sacrificing everyone. It's a dangerous game.
---
Nea's is next week, Kate's is the week after.
---
How would they buff iron will.
---
No you didn't.
---
Old wraith in stealth kind of tracking maybe? Mr pretty good job so far has said this killer is going to be super strong so who knows.
---
They look cool
---
Animals DO have emotions tho. They aren't as smart as humans, but they can feel. That's why there were elephants that made an actual funeral, and (possibly) why cats sometimes torture mice.
---
Considering Demogorgon was shown to be pretty smart he most likely has some emotions.
---
Still don‚Äôt know how people forget or even forgive he‚Äôs a pedophile but y‚Äôknow, gamer culture i suppose.
---
Ye same, they are just a cheap win and they are the most expensive thing in the bloodweb
---
wait w h a t
---
I've thought about this a bunch.
---
However, I feel it would work better as its own assymetrical gane about catching the killer rather than escaping.
---
Could you NOT spoil the show? Darn it. After 2 episodes and I liked her.
---
I think its about the Karma the surv got after tbagging
---
Gotta love when people t-bag too far away from the exit, always satisfying to see.
---
Idk what he was thinking but it at least sounds to me like helpful training wheels for learning  to visualize what your scratch marks look like to the killer.
---
Honestly, If you make it to lose 1 or 2 tokens when you hit your obsession, JTEINS would be a pretty good perk. YJMIN would be too OP, making you get to stage two 18 seconds faster at T3. Depraved seems like more of an ability then a perk. Like some killer who rigs traps (inb4 not bear traps) to be sprung around the map, in chests or lockers or totems.
---
That‚Äôs a great pin
---
Plague gets the highest amount of 4k‚Äôs at red ranks according to the devs. 
---
She‚Äôs top tier for me with the correct perks imo, always use surveillance especially with her.

---
Please, I don't think I could handle near guaranteed keys in chests, I'm not strong enough.
---
I think it should be considerably slowed down if the killer is within a certain radius. But it would have to be balanced so survivors can't abuse that so if another survivor is also in that radius then the entity progresses as normal etc

Haha fort game bad
---
It‚Äôs only after killer breaks a gen does it become active I think
---
Being toxic creates more toxicity.
---
Are you kidding? It was a blast!
---
I would love to see DbD funkos. Its an insta buy from me.
---
You should have done a default dance lol
---
I'm only toxic when they're toxic
---
What
---
Nope. They will just go back to circling the edge of the map and doing laps all game.

I've heard of masochists, but damn son.

Ya boy is missing his nose lol

"By your powers combined, I am Toxic Doctor!"
---
That seems pretty fair to me
---
"Close scape"  
---
After you needlessly ran out of the exit? Sure, Jan.
---
*Sad bubba noise*
---
Not necessarily. You can get it sometimes 3 times in a row at level 50, that's 3 full bloodwebs. All for that juicy territorial imperative 3. Multiply that by all the shit perks in the game, which is more than half.
---
I do the same thing, if they play scummy they deserve it
---
Why does it look like Mathieu met you?
---
I'm sry for all ppl seeing my stream, next time i'm gonna look after the link so you only see the clip :)
---
I think this would be a great addition, and quite easy to enable/disable by using the checkmarks at the Perks in the  character info.
---
There is definitely something wrong with you calling someone a manlet.
---
I've heard worse and had people unironically argue worse on this subreddit. People complain about the dumbest shit
---
Should've worn the grey and neon pink sweatpants with that
---
I mean, he kickstarted DBD's toxicity, so fuck him
---
On the gun should be haunted grounds
---
*Teabags with malicious intent*
---
how and why is this in fortnite lmfao
---
Addons I am fine with but hopefully not the base kit
---
Who knows if these are even the real perks. We will find out tomorrow. Either way I'm stoked
---
Oke this is actually a pretty smart joke. Well done
---
All I see is you being antagonistic POS like most Dwights tend to be then got yourself into shitty situation.
---
If you get a 4k it should be automatically a merciless imo
---
Saaaame!
---
I‚Äôd say it depends. If it‚Äôs a 1 hook mori on all 4 I don‚Äôt think it deserves a double pip
---
TBH FREDDY CAN MAKE COLDWIND WORK BECAUSE OF HIS GEN TELEPORT, HE'LL HAVE A WAY EASIER TIME ON THE MAP THAN SOMEONE LIKE HAG OR HUNTRESS. BUT YEAH, ITS A SHIT MAP, WHENEVER I PLAY KILLER THERE I CAN'T FUCKIN SEE ANYONE IN THE CORN, AND WHENEVER I PLAY SURVIVOR, THE KILLER SOMEHOW ALWAYS MANAGES TO KEEP TRACK OF ME WHEN I'M RUNNING IN THE CORNROWS.
---
I'VE OWNED BUBBA FOR AWHILE AND JUST RECENTLY DECIDED TO FOCUS ON HIM FOR BBQ SINCE I KEEP JUMPING KILLERS FOR RITES AND PERSONAL AMUSEMENT.  I WAS ABOUT 5 LEVELS AWAY FROM UNLOCKING IT BEFORE THIS SHRINE HIT.  OH WELL, AT LEAST NOW I CAN LEVEL HIM FOR THE OTHER PERKS HE HAS SINCE I'VE COME THIS FAR.
---
No, but if you dominated the survivors you shouldn't be actively punished. What other multiplayer game PUNISHES you for doing well?
---
I mean yeah, but Its really hard to leave new players on the hook, as camping ends their match, and their chances of keeping playing
---
Then this new perk is the killers version of crutch of man (when it was a crutch)
---
What no why
---
What are chili perks
---
NOW MAKE "DECOY" HAPPEN!!! =D
---
I really thought it was a Samination artwork. The style is similar.
---
How to play killer 101:
---
1. Start game
---
2. Go sit in a corner and think about your life choices
---
3. ???
---
4. Get yelled at in endgame chat anyway
---
I did the same thing with the Halloween movies. I'd already seen some of them anyway but I watched through all of them (except 3) before Myers released. Started to do the same with Nightmare On Elm Street but I think I only watched 4 or 5 of those.
---
Fortnite bad Minecraft good please give me reddit good and silver
---
No. You can level up with blood points.
---
Once you hit level 30 unprestieged you get the first one.
---
Once you hit level 35 you get the second
---
Once you hit 40 you get the third.
---
Once you hit 50, you can prestige if you choose.
---
You do not have to prestige to get unlockables. 
---
When you prestige, you just get a nice outfit.
---
As a ghost face main i really can't stop reading these survivor mains complaining about his power being op when it really isn't LUL
---
PGTW? C'MON DUDE, I GET THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT RUIN, IT'S ANNOYING AND IT CRUSHES MY SOUL WHEN I SEE IT EVERY FUCKING GAME, BUT PGTW ACTUALLY DOES REQUIRE SOME ACTUAL EFFORT FROM THE KILLER TO SLOW THE GAME DOWN, AND IT'S A DEAD PERK IF THEY CAN'T HOOK ANYONE.
---
Aight üÖ±
---
Ohhhhh
---
ON THE OTHER HAND, I LOVE SLUGGING TOXIC SCHMUCKS AND LETTING THEM BLEED OUT.  HAD SOMEONE DO THAT TO ME AS HUNTRESS FORGETTING THAT I HAVE HATCHETS AND CAN HIT THEM THROUGH WINDOWS.
---
One time a Myers let me escape when I was playing David because "your outfit was hot" and honestly? Fuck yeah it was!
---
Obviously this was staged after they trashtalked the killer
---
MYERS PERK PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD MAKES YOU BECOME SPEEEEEEEEEEEED
---
is this not truth?
---
Oh this game was so cool! OP has good taste
---
Yeah I sure would love to see Negan in the game but... it's not because the human thing, I just think he would not fit in the ¬´style¬ª of the game
---
Exact same build as me but i dont use franklins cuz i dont have it but sometimes i use endurinh
---
How so?
---
Not that i think about it no killer shows his face fully when he is just human. Wraith is the closest to human from all killers who show their face, I think?
---
Jut run pop goes to weasel 4Head
---
Freddy
---
Hatch has an opening delay unless someone dcs.
---
i spends shards on bloodpoints if i really need to, like i did it on monday as i‚Äôm currently away until dlc drops
---
I just think it'd be so sweet. His whistle as a a lullaby? Yes please!
---
Ah my bad, didnt notice he went all the way up to healthy.
---
You could have also easily walked out the gate apparently
---
same
---
Just a quick double teabag works great as a hello.
---
Still don‚Äôt really see him fitting since all the killer are either serial killers or some demonic entity
---
No but it is a belly jiggling one
---
Didn't the Legion only kill like... One dude?
---
Do not insult thiccy briccky
---
Except we're not happy, because out of the 5 status effects, only 2 have timers so Vigil will only affect those two.
---
when you say you are fine
---
Wat
---
Legion is the only exception I still don‚Äôt like legion because of it being more then one person
---
I used to play killer all the time, but then the survivors  started bring real dicks taking all of the fun out of it. Now with the queue being as long as it is for survivor I feel like I am forced to play as a killer. So my to choices are wait forever to play a survivor  and enjoy an exciting  game or go be a killer and deal with dick weeds for a while. It's  frustrating  because  I bought most of the dlcs. And used to play every  day but lately  it's  just not worth the frustration.
---
Rip all the yellow ranks that will only fight bbq‚Äôs now though
---
Well Negan has atleast killed 20 people.
---
I wouldnt get devour hope, very niche perk.
---
Check out damnnohtml's video on how to run common loops as killer. I'll link it below.
---
Yeah i know i just noticed that it is that way for some reason.
---
That‚Äôs fine with me if so. Because they split second the survivor needs to check my shards is all I need to clap them cheeks with a sick phase fake.
---
Well so it takes the survivors not doing gens until the chase is over??? Looks great to me
---
&gt;AngryPug
---
This opinion is false
---
Yeah I noticed it aswell when I was making the meme lol
---
I normally run Hex:Ruin,BBQ&amp;Chili,Pop Goes The Weasel and Discordance. I put dream snares where survivors have to travel, especially at loops,windows and pallets.Putting snares around gens isn't an effective tactic
---
well i seems my wish came true
---
Does it matter? You decided to camp hatch until it opened. Just take the gate out like the others did. If you die on/near hatch because you want points that‚Äôs on you. You shouldn‚Äôt blame others because you‚Äôre selfish.
---
Just don't go upp there 4Head
---
He's the kind of person who you would tell a cool story to, then he'd immediately tell you how he's done the same thing - but just a tiny bit better.
---
He wouldn‚Äôt really be interesting enough
---
Yeah with a mori i understand. But if i manage to end the game quickly without one shouldnt i atleast get awarded lmao.
---
Yeah, I'm happy when i just get safety pip sometimes. I don't want to reach higher ranks because I'd have to tryhard and have less fun.
---
Not an outfit, just a piece to it.
---
Struggle is real
---
I had double bloodpoints for survival on, the hatch was right beside the gate, I was waiting for people to leave so I could get the extra points, nothing selfish about it dafty, I gambled and lost but it wasn't selfish in any way
---
I disagree. He has a personality that rivals Ash and could be the one to bring in the "Zombie Infection" playstyle that people want, I'd imagine it's work like a combination of Plauge and Pig, where if you don't cure yourself in time  you die. Or they could just give him a Gun, some people want that
---
You can't stun her if she is in the fatigue animation
---
tell me when exactly you were trying to stun her (during/after blink, or when she's just passing by?)
---
stunning the nurse when she's blinking doesn't always work, as she's immune to them sometimes
---
I'd take Hopper over both Nany and Steve.
---
Survivor player, agreed but maybe for 1 gen for if your team are absolute bots.
---
I'm still not a fan of how they balance the game. Rather then address problems head on, they use statistical balances instead to fix most of the problems (Such as DS to stop camping.).
---
I think Ghostface and Freddy are both in fair good places outside of a few small issues (Such as not being able to spot ghostface to turn off his power when you're looking directly at him.).
---
The best games are around 10-5 imo. I just kinda set myself a goal to reach rank 1 again this season just to see if i can still make it.
---
Thank you mematic, very cool.
---
You know when they make sandwiches or burgers with 100 layers, and in a cartoon their mouth just stretches big enough to fit around it.
---
It's like that but the survivors can't stretch their mouth far enough so he helps.
---
Especially since he gets stronger over time by stalking the survivors. It would probably have a great build up right to the end.
---
You still wanted hatch for more points. If you camp hatch for points that‚Äôs being selfish. Hell if I see someone camping hatch I deny them it because they can take the gate out like everyone else did unless the killer gave them hatch by dropping them near it. You even said ‚ÄúI had double surivval BP on so I waited for the others to leave for the edtra points.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt give bloodpoint greedy survivors hatch if they aren‚Äôt friends witht that person.
---
Most Dwights are toxic POS.  I'll kill them all!!
---
As a killer you can get it in 4 games. You‚Äôre right on the money it‚Äôs never worth it.
---
I agree with that, but that was the type of game that they set out to make right off the bat, and it's taken until now for them to be able to swap gears and try to fix the issues the game is having. For instance; instead of just increasing BP gain which wouldn't do anything when we get 10 more chapters with 20 more characters and 60 more perks, they're doing something about the system from the ground up (if it's good or not, we don't know).
---
Are you sure the Ghostface isn't running add-ons that make it where you have to be in humping distance to reveal him? He's got two.
---
Welcome to the game! At least 60% of the community are nice, I only started playing about 3 months ago, when ghostface was released, so I understand the confusion. :).         
---
            
---
1. If you want to play killer without buying any dlcs yet, one of the first 3, personally wouldn‚Äôt recommend trapper as you need to learn the maps first to play well. Wraith is eh but easy to understand. Hillbilly is a simple and effective choice. If you are willing to spend money, leatherface (the cannibal) he‚Äôs easy to understand, while shit to play :(, he‚Äôs not too bad for low ranks + beginners. Survivor, for me I‚Äôd say meg, her perks are good, and survivors are basically just skins of each other, it‚Äôs the individual progression which is different. Meg out the free characters has (personally) the best perks for beginners. However if you want extra help, watch ‚ÄòNot otzdarva‚Äô on YouTube, he did a video explaining what to play for both killer and survivor.        
---

https://youtu.be/C49wygOeZ5I          
---
           
---
2. Nah but when you reach rank 1-10 you may receive stupid messages from either toxic or cocky players. I find it funny personally, but if not just ignore it. Most players say nothing, and some will even compliment you, play how you want to play though.            
---
             
---
3. Tunnelling- *continuously following the same survivor no matter the situation for, hopefully, a guaranteed kill.* personally I find this survivor excuse pathetic as the point of the killer is to kill, and sometimes they use it as a scapegoat instead of admitting defeat. However I would genuinely try and avoid tunnelling when u can. Especially early game.            
---
Slugging- * to leave a survivor crawling instead of hooking/ finishing them off*. This is definitely not toxic, and fair, so If someone has a go at you, personally it‚Äôs gg, they‚Äôve been given some form of a chance of surviving ...        
---
Camping- * to wait/ stay around a hooked survivor, usually to guarantee one kill*. I‚Äôd say avoid this and I can understand survivors complaints about this when it‚Äôs blatant camping. Obviously play how you want to play, but think about the waste of time the other players wasting when you‚Äôre just being a dick really. Avoid it when possible, you won‚Äôt get better at the game by standing round all the time. -Ik you didn‚Äôt ask for this but I thought it was necessary         
---
4. God no! Even better!          
---
              
---
5. Some people argue halloween was bigger, I‚Äôd disagree but oh well. This is going to be huge! ST is current, popular and will please both fan bases.        
---
6. For me-         
---
‚Ä¢Not otzdavra- for tips and help.        
---
‚Ä¢Monto- for gameplay and some tips.       
---
‚Ä¢Samination- for the culture :).        
---
‚Ä¢ Maybe ‚Äònoob3‚Äô but I don‚Äôt think he amazing for new players.             
---
          
---
7. Killer tbh, not really a survivor, so maybe I‚Äôm biased :). I‚Äôm a Freddy,clown and soon to be demogorgon main. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend clown, he‚Äôs frustrating to play. I started playing huntress, and do think it was a good decision for me, also played a good amount of ghostface and doctor too.         
---
         
---
8. Play what you prefer :).       
---
9. Survivors realistically are just skin so it‚Äôs hard to judge, some technically, like Jane, are louder, but it‚Äôs not game breaking. Perk wise during early levels I‚Äôd argue Bill or Quentin. I‚Äôm no expert on them though.         
---
For killers- Nurse, but once you get good she‚Äôs the best in the game.         
---
-Spirit- (I think) once again very good but hard to learn.           
---
-To play effectively- Trapper, Clown, Wraith and Doctor (at times).          
---
-Avoid high rank cannibal he‚Äôs useless.        
---
10. I personally love the devs, atm pretty much everyone‚Äôs very grateful for the ST chapter. But any fan base is nit-picky and toxic at times, complaining when they don‚Äôt get what they want. Seriously they‚Äôre good though.        
---
Hope you enjoy the game :) You improve with time and ignore other players. Have fun in the realm of the entity...
---
Only if Negan says some of his best lines when he hits/downs/mori's someone.
---
That was before the lawsuit though.
---
*Entity displeased*
---
I mean the only thing Bubba is good for is BBQ and ocassionally Franklin's
---
I have yet to actually see anyone say that. It's like people are defending an issue that doesn't exist.
---
&gt;'cause most of the killers will camp only after all gens are completed so they can secure the kill or when everyone's lurking around the hooked survivor
---
LOL what fantasy world are you living in? jesus christ
---
I'm assuming you're actually just trolling now for the sake of sanity.
---
WHY IS IT WHENEVER I RUN DELIVERANCE I'M ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE FOUND? OR MY TEAMMATES RUN THE KILLER STRAIGHT TO ME?
---
Dang it, Bobby!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctv6zi/rake_me_daddy/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not as easy as survivor
---
Yesterday i had a game of "for fuck sake how can i be the only one doing gens in this fucking thing"
---
I run BBQ, Nurses' Calling, Ruin and a flex slot depending on how I feel. Devour Hope as a fun perk, or something like IRon Maiden/Surveilance
---
Had 200% more BP for everyone active (randoms), and got an Ebony Mori Hag. Wasn't fun, but salvaged as much BP as I could before getting killed after first hook. 
---
Still yikes when I think about all the possible BP if there wasn't a mori and a Hag. I hate Hag.
---
feelsgoodman
---
i said most of them, just because your rank 15 ass got unlucky and had a basement insidious Bubba that doesn't mean you should punish all the killers for that
---
I main Spirit, but I have to say she's definitely way easier than Nurse and Billy ;) Billy ain't that easy, Nurse isn't easy at all. 
---
I mean, you can always say that "once you learn her she's ez pz", but that's kinda dumb. I learnt japanese so it;s easy for me, does it mean japanese is easy? 
---
I'm not saying Nurse is omega hard or anything but there's not so much skill involved in this game.
---
Well at least if you're in console there's a 50/50 chance you'll have fun or he/she will have 4 blinks
---
:((
---
DS helps you
---
BT helps others
---
Do you want to help others or yourself more?
---
I run neither of them, as I personally don't like second chances.
---
It's not about being human. It's about looking different from survivors.
---
This 100% needs to be implemented alongside the suggestion. This along with the radius give more options for balancing. In its current state it‚Äôs overpowered to some killers and not for others.
---
It wasn‚Äôt not necessary.
---
She gets Boni is = Tokens, but we don't know for what.
---
I feel you man, I have over 100 instadown hatchets but like 30 belts on my huntress
---
Because it's hard to read a tone just through text and emoji are a no-go, people on reddit use "/s" after a message that's supposed to be sarcastic/not too serious. 
---
As to why that's the case for your message, spirit is only a free win against bad survivors. (In most cases. OP addons win you the game with any character). But if you have ears, you counter spirit. Even with prayer beads you can still hear her footsteps, or for example see/hear the corn moving on coldwind. Yes she is pretty strong, but it's not a free win by any means unless the survivors don't know what they're doing
---
If it glows, it goes.
---
He just doesn't suit the style of the game. As much as I love the guy and as cool as he could be in the game, I can't see it.
---
I cringe whenever someone teabaggs. The game is 18+ yet we have kids like you in the community.
---
Also, when I kill a "Teabagger", they tend to cry over every little thing after the game. That's what kind of players they are
---
*Ba Dum Tss*
---
*sad hockey mask noises*
---
What the fuck is an Ochido?
---
"No exceptions"
---
I hate t-bagging. It just feeds the toxicity for everyone
---
I know, I was joking. It‚Äôs toxic as shit.
---
Maybe change your pw to one you never use usually and give your acc to a friend you can really trust. Also w 2 factor authentication anyone cant really steal your acc so its not that much about trust as well
---
No way the demogorgon from dead by daylight was so popular they made it in real life
---
Thats the best, she wasnt in fatigue
---
I dont think its a glitch. He has enough speed to clear the gap to make it to the other side.
---
most killers are above rank 20
---
Even Shirtless hag
---
Thing is I hate Rancor as I'm not only always the obsession, but I could play near perfectly, and still get a phat mori at endgame because the entity just hates me
---
Well she‚Äôs kinda already shirtless??
---
If you‚Äôre unhooking against an insidious Bubba or Billy  (BT or no BT) that‚Äôs your fault. BT only has a few counters and you can farm other players off hook and still have them take a hit if they bodyblock to save you.
---
then you weren't struggling correctly OR it didn't read your clicks. PC or Console?
---
;(
---
I'll be playing WoW Classic in 5 days and forget this game exists forever. CAN'T WAIT!!!
---
I love it
---
both gate and the hatch give 5k to survival
---
hatch gives bonus 2k in objective
---
NOT.
---
YET.
---
Oh well. The killers are supposed to be stronger than survivors. It's not supposed to be a One V one. Once survive with friends gets a Nerf we can talk about a spirit Nerf.
---
I only play solo Survivor and get dragged down by bad teams constantly. At least Spirit matches are quick. I'll take her over a Trapper or doctor any day
---
I'm not punishing anyone the OP's topic is nothing to do with me.  
---
Just laughing at the claim camping killers are so rare then watching them clutch their pearls when someone who's game experience doesn't match their rhetoric.
---
Now I need to find this in Gif form. Urgh. I don't want to look for Fortnite stuff.
---
AKCHUALLY
---
Imagine if the Kate outfit is auric cells only
---
Wheres the clown jiggle physics. Now that's hot
---
A prequel meme on r/deadbydaylight ?  
---
My lord, is that legal?
---
Bill is just aggresively choking the killer.
---
Yes in SWF maybe but alone it takes every person to drop into the basement and save you before every one knows they are camping with insidious and then you‚Äôre dead.
---
What‚Äôs going on in that?
---
How tf is killer easier to rank up than survivor? As survivor you don't even need to escape to pip or even double pip at purple&gt; ranks. As killer there are times where you kill 3 survivors and even then get a black pip. And if you dominate them all and end the game fast, you won't pip too.
---
&gt;kind a hard to choke the killer holdintg the back of his neck lol
---
Why not? I do it and you can cleanse all the totems so it‚Äôs on the survivors. I cleanse ever totem I see when playing as survivor and I rarely have to deal with noed
---
Well most indoor maps were pretty bad so far.
---
My gym teachers always looked more like The Clown. Had a female one in Middle School who especially did lol.
---
Just drink some milk
---
I genuinely really like the game and I think it's one of my favorite Maps. So I have high hopes for this one. Lery's is garbage though so it's a 50/50.
---
He tried don‚Äôt bully D;
---
That feature will come with dedicated servers.
---
I always get It to work on nurses just have paciente after blinks panic head ons wont do anything
---
Because movie adaptions of games are garbage due to the fact that game characters have hours and hours and hours for you to grow attached to them or learn about them while movies are constrained to about 90 minutes on average. I would kill for a Huntress movie but name a good video game movie adaption
---
Are you a rank one plague?
---
You look around the corners when going into the basement. If you see the killer you don‚Äôt unhook. I‚Äôve never had a problem with campers if my teammates do gens against one. Also if someone spams m1 I never go for the save unless I know someone is in a chase
---
Because they didn‚Äôt get chase or boldness
---
Most likely because of framerate drops but idk
---
Agreed!
---
Nope
---
Demogordon. That made me laugh harder than I'd like to admit
---
Haha that‚Äôs Xbox for ya

Lmfao, if they added negan id just quit taking this game serious. Terrible idea

Toxci

True true. Been playing a lot more killer because of that
---
I think map offerings should never be secret. That way you know exactly what kind of assholes you're going against on either side. Then again I think map offerings shouldn't even be a thing. My biggest complaint about the game hands down

Ok here's a

I remember watching tru3 back when for honor first came out, every single one of his videos were similar to "WORLD'S BEST OROCHI LOSSES TO MY WARDEN???" but then the rest of the video is him complaining about mechanics after he barely beats another player with the same mechanics he claims BS. I found Dbd and he continued the complaining.

It is very possible to make interesting commentary about a situation without sounding like you're whining. Tru3 has never done that well.

Borrowed Time is good if you have some incentive to save people &gt; the usual incentive. I usually run this with the 100% heal after hook with the +25%xp per successful hook/protection.
---
A good game as the Killer is getting 9 hooks and slowing the generators to at least 7 minutes.
---
According to the entity at least.
---
According to me it's a game where the survivors know what they're doing but don't tea bag at every pallet or shit talk to you in the post game chat. Or abuse survive with friends with a low rank friend hosting so they can bully Noob/lower rank killers.
---
Just a fun, quick and respectful match where everyone has fun and either side can win is my ideal match.
---
I play mostly solo as survivor unless people that I sometimes SWF with are online. BT is not exploitable at all. Either way there is communication you can use with randoms that is mostly known by the community. 
---
 
---
Some common examples of communication in DBD is:
---
Spamming M1 on hook: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm being camped‚Äù or ‚ÄúDO NOT UNHOOK ME‚Äù but new survivors don‚Äôt understand this as much. They understand it when they have some playtime.
---
Pointing: ‚ÄúThe killer is in that direction‚Äù
---
Tbag: ‚ÄúHello‚Äù ‚ÄúHeal me‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù
---
You should learn about nonverbal communication in a game you‚Äôre playing before you say something like ‚ÄúYou need text to communicate.‚Äù You only need text or VC to communicate if you don‚Äôt know how to use the methods of communicating we have already. If you get against so many campers that it‚Äôs a problem and everyone runs in to unhook without checking for killers you should probably run Kindred and Decisive. 
---
You can‚Äôt just down the non-BTd survivor. You don‚Äôt know if someone has or doesn‚Äôt have BT. It‚Äôs the same as saying don‚Äôt tunnel the player with Decisive. You don‚Äôt know who has or doesn‚Äôt have Decisive because the obsession isn‚Äôt always the person with DS.
---
I read this in the Samination trapper voice
---
They threw the lore out the window with new chapter. Pretty sure he will fit
---
Don't try and suggest anything cool to dead by daylight fans.  
---
They're creatures of habit and want 1 gamemode for all eternity.
---
I really hope we don't get a Terminator killer. It would be a waste of the killer machine idea. But I would seriously love a robot killer. Battle droid or I uninstall haha
---
Your problem is your at rank 1
---
but killers are dumb they not gonna predict that
---
Yeah it‚Äôs funny lol. It‚Äôs funny because it‚Äôs stupid lol
---
I know there's not so much skill unvolved in this game so my point persist. I main spirit too and learning Japanese as well and I think spirit is not much different than Billy, takes a little bit of practice and there you go, one hit most of the time.
---
Plus how you learn a language is way different, depends on your native language too for example. For English speakers Japanese is way harder than who has as native language that have similar, if not identical sounds and rules, like in my case, while in DbD i don't remember a game similar to it from where you can have an edge
---
It just take time to learn, I don't play with headphones for example and still do well with spirit just by prediction. Thanks to that I'm learning Nurse on console and it's getting easier and easier and way more rewarding than all the time spent with Spirit. I don't even count Billy since it's so easy to get a grasp in two games and do so well that makes me feel ashamed to use it, there's no challenge involved
---
I still see your points but I disagree that Billy isn't easy when you have an insta down if the survivors do a mistake or they end up in a dead zone. Without counting the map pressure, no CD and a standard 115% speed which makes him very strong and easy to play. I can get it the argument with Nurse but I think she's way more rewarding and less drawbacks, like Billy NoCD, be able to see people while using her power and more map pressure
---
Don't get me wrong, Spirit is one of the strongest killers imo but she's way weaker than Nurse and maybe on pair with Billy in certain maps but the focus you have to put to play Spirit isn't comparable to the one with Billy
---
This has happened to me as well buttttt it's usually on my ps4 so I think it's lag or something. Not a bug.
---
If the Demogorgon really looks like this...
---
Holy fuck is that bad
---
It was his daily. I play a trapper like that too sometimes.
---
Do you have any evidence for that? Or do you only spread some bad rumors to damage his reputation because you do not like him? I call that a witchhunt.
---
Sadly, licensed characters cost money or you have to buy auric cells for them. D; For all we know this deal could be different compared to other deals with licensed characters and we could get one that can be bought with shards instead of all 3 are paid.
---
I require a Dart skin for the demogorgon. Dart must live on in our memories, chowing down on nougat.
---
To be fair, that makes sense. Maybe my initial reasons for changing BT are poor, but I do think that a radius will be great for balancing and with a cooldown as another commenter noted. Adding a cooldown would be a nice needed nerf, and further balancing can adjust the radius.
---
Also this is super interesting to me because most people I've played with see spamming M1 on a hook as "Quick, he's gone, help me". Which is immediately a big misunderstanding! Pointing for me has always been "Go do that gen / Go that way" Which again is the opposite of what you said!
---
I personally like indoor maps, so I think it will be great
---
You teabag precisely \*because\* it's annoying and obnoxious. There's no reason to do it other than to annoy the killer.
---
I don't care about teabagging either (I'm not saying I'm advanced or anything, I'm just quite capable of getting tilted all on my own), but it doesn't make sense to do something specifically to annoy someone, and then act surprised then they get annoyed.
---
Yeah. Especially when ruin ends up being a waste of a perk slot most of the time due to totems being way too easy to destroy and having guaranteed spawns. They are also very large and loud and stick out. I think totems should have a complete overhaul tbh.
---
Upvoting for Maradona Lol
---
Yep. Most expensive while also usually making your game give you less BP.
---
Ugh. One of those little snot survivors must have snuck in and changed it.
---
Yeah totally. I would argue though that it isn't the fact they are indoor, and more the fact that they are pretty much square maps. If Lery's was more of a rectangular map then it wouldn't be so risky to basically do any gen other than the perimeter gens.
---
Demogorgon: *screeches wildly*
---
People use pointing as both. Also depending on the platform or rank it probably means something else. Ranks 15-20 on PC I see don‚Äôt know how to correctly use the universal communication. In other ranks people mean business from what I‚Äôve seen. If somebody is spamming m1 on hook they either don‚Äôt go to unhook or are cautious when going to unhook. 
---
BT would be a weak perk if it got changed to having a cooldown. I play more survivor right now as I‚Äôm prestiging killer and I used to play exclusively killer and I‚Äôm fine with BT as it is right now. It‚Äôs only OP when it‚Äôs a 4man using it the coordinating to all take hits. It would make sense if it was a 10-15 second cooldown. 30 would be high, 60 seconds would be WAY too high. I‚Äôve had the fair share of a 4man using it to farm everyone off basement hook then get away because they all took bodyblocks for eachother when I didn‚Äôt try to tunnel. Too high a cooldown would remove the point of Borrowed Time if they did want to add a BT cooldown.
---
no
---
Good for who ? For killers ? For survivors ? For both ? Usually, indoor maps are a lot of "fun" for Billy and Huntress, even Nurse. Probably this map will be good for Scratched Mirror Myers tho.
---
Thats not what i meant lmao , i have 1600 ac so if Kates outfit is ac only ill get one survivor and the outfit if i can buy It with shards and get both survs with ac

sorry i just can't take anything related to fortnite seriously

I would like to know the backstory of this image
---
Because killer is one person they need to have strong perks because there are only one of them if survivors have strong perks then all 4 can run those strong perks that‚Äôs what got mom nerfed as it was fucking stupid any killer who could only m1
---
I hope so.

Ghost face has to actually try to be sneaky. When I play sneaky ghost face, i expose the survivor and they still have no clue where I am. Then I just pop outta nowhere and instakill them.

---
Ghostface/Monitor and Abuse Myers gang
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they said it‚Äôs hard to change an achievement, but I don‚Äôt remember when or what platform they were talking about.
---
The main issue is that aside from the stain he‚Äôd look too much like a survivor without a distinguishing trait to notice at a distance. The Human Killers have their hoods and masks, making it easier to tell when you just see them from far away who they are. That‚Äôs why so many of them have more noticeable masks. Think about Legion, unmasked, hood down, and a good distance away from you. You can see them, but there‚Äôs no heartbeat yet.  If they weren‚Äôt in a chase, they‚Äôll look like a survivor with cosmetics which given some hair cosmetics is easy to misjudge at a distance.  Negan just doesn‚Äôt have something that wouldn‚Äôt make him look like a survivor if viewed from afar.
---
a killer tied to totems sounds quite fun
---
I've never really got that argument either. Like you know what survivors your playing with and I'm pretty sure you'd notice the baseball bat
---
I dont really know because because i havent played anything else but i remember playing cs go once in the summer and it was so laggy that i really couldnt play it
---
Your gym teacher stalks kids? Don‚Äôt worry, most of mine did as well.

---
Cry of fear just doesn‚Äôt have a good killer who would have a good ability. What, you want Book Simon to just shoot you in the face? The most stressful enemies to fight were the chainsaw ones, and between Bubba and the Hillbilly, we got our Chainsaw Killer quota. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing you mean Purnell? But again, he just has a gun. 
---
Most bosses either have a chainsaw or a gun, or are too directly symbolic to have a way to work as a Killer. Though, as a survivor, I‚Äôd rather have Sophie honestly. It‚Äôd work better than Simon who‚Äôd have a few troubles when stairs come into play. 
---
White Shining, again what power would they give? Though I‚Äôm not turning my nose up at this one. Has potential.
---
As for Hotline Miami, Jacket might be an interesting killer idea - just again we have to wonder about the fact he‚Äôs closely associated with a Gun, which doesn‚Äôt seem very balanced especially given it‚Äôs a point and click weapon in Hotline.
---
Those are just my thoughts.
---
Harass them??? What. Anyone reading this. Don't do that! You'll get your account banned for listening to OP.
---
OP IF HE IS cheating, then report the person directly. Stop trying to get a bunch of players to yo harass someone without giving any context to the situation
---
Yeah, uh, Michael isn‚Äôt that human. Sure he is HUMAN, but at the same time he isn‚Äôt just a murderer like Ghostface or Legion- he‚Äôs evil personified, he‚Äôs a force of nature.
---
That‚Äôs why I wait until rank reset whenever I want to do an adept. I can‚Äôt double pip against the survivors in my usual killer rank because they‚Äôre better than rank 15s and don‚Äôt make nearly as many mistakes.

That's why he's the first one. Cause he's the least human Of all the most human

I mean, there are much harder achievements to complain about. Like left for dead

Dude, it's pretty standard knowledge that playing killer with more than 2 perks is toxic. And they can't be BBQ or Ruin
---
Again, pig MASK. You can see the mask.

Man, sitting through all the Freddy movies would be some dedicated. You would be wading in trash for hours.
---
You can still 2pip at any rank as any killer tho, it's just much easier on lower ones
---
Its paused. Not cancelled.
---
Theyre looking for a way to make it happen
---
This is probBably the 23th time this got reposted. LOL
---
That‚Äôs way harder if you‚Äôre in purple or red ranks. You can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúmaximize your points‚Äù because if you try to do that you‚Äôll most likely not be able to pressure gens enough and not get enough kills unless you play killer enough to be good at any killer.
---
There‚Äôs a hook upstairs?
---
I consistently rank 1 on both survivor and on killer, and when I started my achievement grind earlier this week I managed to get all of the survivor achievements within two days. Killer on the other hand.. in red/purple ranks is just extremely painful. I had already gotten adept trapper and wraith and a few other low tier killers back when I was newer to the game, but even playing as billy in red ranks trying to go for the achievement is extremely difficult. 
---
I‚Äôm not disputing that it shouldn‚Äôt be hard to achieve the achievements, but I AM saying that in the current patch &amp; current state of the game, unless you‚Äôre a low rank it‚Äôs ridiculously hard to obtain merciless with a killers base kit.
---
I can hear this image
---
I still haven‚Äôt brought myself to rewatch Saw. Like I can handle gore and twisted situations but it‚Äôs just so unappealing for some reason.
---
Ah yes! I must run only distressing in order to give survivors a chance, as killer is too OP!
---
Technically correct, but functionally incorrect- It‚Äôs human*oid* meaning they can still use the preexisting skeleton for animations. That was the reason they said no non-human killers, probably forgetting that some monsters are humanoid and could bypass that restriction.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctw59j/things_to_do_when_facecamping_a_survivor/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
if BBQ was split into two perks, one for aura, one for bloodpoints, it would still be used
---
The bloodpoitns one.
---
The aura one would only be used by Nurses, Freddies and Billies
---
Who's Janet?
---
The reason is simple. Make it easy to tell at a glance friend or foe. Distinguishable traits like the face are a good way to show this. If you can see the face? You‚Äôre likely dealing with a friend. See the stripes and burns? Get away.
---
Then you should wait until you have a good enough PC or a Console. I have a GTS 450 and I get frame lag on 30 FPS and my ping is jumpy on some maps.
---
Survivors stand in a sort of slouching stance, Negan often stands cocky and tall to appear more intimidating. Plus you'd probably see the baseball bat assuming he isn't behind something
---
Why does the show need to fully explain everything, don't you think knowing everything would kinda ruin it?
---
oops... I just mafe it myself...I didn't see this meme with this format befor. Sorry.

Because money

I know I wasnt saying it was easier tbf, I was just saying that you dont always have to get a 4k

I can't wait for the wave of noobs lol

If we get the dedicated servers and this DLC at the same time, the player numbers will probably jump quite quickly
---
No guarantee he isn't
---
Oh man, a scissorman would be so good!

yeah hahahaha

I think it'll reach a new all time peak, probably a lot higher than it's ever been. I am super keen for DBD to be more popular.

This is gonna be the Mori and the survivor dabs to a bass boosted Despacito and explodes immediately afterwards.

I know that people can have opinions on how specific perks work or have personal feelings towards a mechanic or perk. But at no point should you sit there as a grown man and go "AW IF I FUCKIN HAD RUIN I WOULD STILL BE AT 5 GENS" or some salty shit like that. A lot of his complaining comes from hindsight, no matter what happens he usually has a whining take on why it could have been countered.
---
Again, everyone is entitled to an opinion about anything on any game. Though you shouldn't be projecting your anger out because a situation would be different if you chose to use a perfect meta build. This is why I personally prefer people like puppers over tru3, puppers might get ruin popped early and go "damn, they got that quick", but he doesn't bitch about it for the next 3 mins. He moves on and makes the game interesting.
---
yes its a bit sloppy and paragraphing would be nice
---
Her whole shtick is being like a positivity guru. It might be a bit unrealistic but her perk lines are all things like:
---
 *"Showing up when things get rough, listening to people's problems, and supporting those in need; that's how you become stronger, that's how you grow." ‚Äî Jane Romero*   
---
or  
---
Poised -  *"Ok, stay calm. Don't overthink it and just keep moving forward: you got this." ‚Äî Jane Romero* 
---
so yeah I could see calm being her baseline much more than most other survivors
---
Yes. I hate when killers teleport to pallets and stun survivors.
---
Good thing this was meant to be a joke! The fortnite hate band wagoners are far more pathetic than any regular person who enjoys the game will ever be ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It is difficult to double pip without ruin but you just have to play and eventually you'll get it. Other games have reaaaaaaaally difficult achievements.
---
Double pip as killer is a lot easier than survivor.
---
You can't tell me Spirit isn't thiccc tho
---
bolding a few key words would also go a long way

no i mean hook vacuums, locker vacuums etc

Jeffrey Dahmer did some really fucked up shit with a pretty high body count, interesting character but wouldn't fit the game either
---
Tolkien never fukin ruined anything even though whole lore was out there fully explained. if the plot is shit, explanation surely will ruin it
---
Spirit still, because sound is limited you get visual indicator for survivors breathing/moaning etc

it looked pretty fair he hit u at the end his animation

You clicked on them, so it seems you are the curious one.

It‚Äôs probably because they‚Äôd have to make it very noticible that he was a killer, which is difficult with someone without a mask, they‚Äôd have to have him have his bat up at all times or slmething

 Survivors get chased for an entire game and leave without a scratch, then depip, this game is rough in all the right places imo. It forces certain levels of skill, like you need to be like an actual killer and continue to take away their hope and if you‚Äôre good enough, you will. Otherwise, you can‚Äôt be surprised your deity doesn‚Äôt like it when you end the game so fast.
---
It's a... like a.... something like a... ***meme***
---
The pip system for killer is a complete joke.
---
Fortnite is garbage.
---
Does this mean that dbd and fortnite are part of a shared universe?
---
I was thinking they could have him resting it on his shoulder
---
The moment that a survivor gets a single flashlight save, it saves more time than you wasted. Triple. Plus more if you get to a good loop, or bodyblock, or anything else. Wasting the killers time is the entire point of being a survivor. Make him focus elsewhere so that the other players get shit done. Then passing him around like the blunt at a party. Until time is up, and or you're free. That's how this game is play.

Yeah but it's actually effective in getting kills unlike bk myers or smoker nurse
---
Devs butchered the lore many times. Just think about Ash talking (when they said survivors will never talk) and now demogorgon (when they said there will never be an alien/monster killer).
---
Its ok, especially if you need the item slot and your team is playing "immersed"
---
I mean league is so much more toxic than dbd. Haven't even played it in ages because it takes the will to live out of me.
---
you are clearly mad about "fortnite" is guess your life is about this game which is KINDA PATHETIC. you better behave or ill tell mommy about this... and guess what's going to happen... NO V-BUCKS !!
---
&gt; whenever tru is talking his opinions are always "matter of fact" and that everyone who disagrees with him is wrong.
---
he's always ranting about logic like a fucking neckbeard. it's a goddamn video game for fuck's sake not a dissertation on spinoza
---
I won‚Äôt say so. In rank 1‚Äôs, Nurse, is, unfortunately, the only competent killer
---
Again NONE OF IT IS LEGITIMATELY CONFIRMED FOR FUCKS SAKE wait literally a few more hours to BITCH about something that's ACTUALLY confirmed instead of flipping shit because you think everything on the internet is true
---
My friend made a dbd mode in Fortnite... I think we need to go into it as stranger Squad now.
---
Stop, I can only get so erect
---
Yeah, I commented earlier that I could have worded my title better. What I meant was that in the show the Demogorgon attacks and eats indiscriminately, while the killers in DbD hook their prey first before killing (and sometimes eating) them. I think it would be funny to see a colossal monster, like a trained animal, hooking survivors.
---
I don't think it would be pleasant for 2v8. Maybe...Maybe, survivors have their own teams and go perkless with voice chat and items. Killers get full access to perks and addons. Voice chat is a pretty powerful thing to have.
---
Lol that is fair.
---
everyone who plays DBD at red ranks on PC play against the same survivors over and over
---
That's the mind flayer.
---
Lol no, what I‚Äôm annoyed about is losers who have to put down a game they don‚Äôt even play. Like why do you need to give your shit opinion? You don‚Äôt. No one needs to know how you think fortnite is cringe or whatever the internet told you how to think.
---
It‚Äôd be such a missed opportunity if they didn‚Äôt. There‚Äôs even a heartbeat like sound in the theme. You can hear it in the show whenever it says what chapter it is and it zooms in through the words.
---
How did people get Michael Mires, I can't even make purchases??
---
I would say Halloween is. Maybe Saw as well, but yeah the other movies haven‚Äôt seen a film in almost 10 years
---
What would his power be? Something to do with Lucile?
---
This could be really good for the game we just have to be careful not to scare them away by trolling for at least like three...two days seems long enough
---
People in this game need to stop acting so privileged
---
&gt; but they focus more on survivor gameplay.
---
the only person you mentioned who focuses on survivor more is noob
---
LMAO, you clearly started attacking when my comment could not hurt/annoy anyone. I simply don't like fortnite. so are you simply going to force me to like it?
---
Walking dead is shit
---
Most likely, I've spit balled a few ideas but nobody seems very fond of them :/
---
I would give anything to not be exposed to a fucking fortnite dance for one week.
---
Sorry. I taught 4th grade last year. It was every. Single. Day.
---
And your game is literally dead. What‚Äôs your point?
---
Banana Man as next killer confirmed
---
Lol, yeah pretty much this!
---
The point of the post isn't anything related to expecting to get pips. The post is just showing how playing really well costs you points and pips, hence the "suffering from success".
---
Not sure if you knew that or if you got r/woosh 'd
---
After season 5 fuck yeah it is. Negan is really the only good part about it
---
Nice
---
Atleast he has good perks
---
Well I've never seen Stranger Things, my girlfriend loves it though so I hear alot about it
---
The legue of legions
---
Calm under pressure and Narrow escape are great!
---
Devoted commander seens too abusable though. Maybe it gives you some other buff?
---
Claudette gang represent
---
&gt;Killer addons are more powerful than any survivor item
---
insta heals, purple lighters, bnp and everything √ó4...
---
Save the Best for Last is the best perk for him. Sloppy+Thanathophobia combo is also good.
---
My friend said it‚Äôs gonna be bad coz if the killer has bad ping then Ure still gonna get hit when it looks like u shouldn‚Äôt
---
hitboxes are good... If the connection is bad it will look like it's the games fault but it's not. Also if you play as a small female character you will have the same hitbox as a big male character (David) so it will always look a bit weird, same goes for weapons, Freddy's hand has the same hitbox as the Trappers big machete.
---
k dude
---
What was that?
---
We‚Äôll just have to hold out and see I guess
---
*de-pips with a 4k because of 2 dcs who don't realize pallet looping a huntress gets you smacced by a hatchet*
---
Is the blood points worth it if you already have it?  Don't want to waste shards for the blood points if it's not worth it. Thanks all.
---
I‚Äôll never forget the Hag who hard camped me during an event with 3 BPS.  I got around 2K from the initial chase and that was my game.
---
No it‚Äôs more that you aren‚Äôt going to find people who are going to heal you as consistently as you will be able to yourself, I‚Äôve ran with no self care and more often than not those randoms are too busy in lockers, urbaning across the map, or going down in 30 seconds against the killer. It‚Äôs not advised for new players to depend that much on their team to heal them when their team might not heal them a single time that entire match. You can say being healed by a teammate shortens your injured time in half but it also takes another person off a gen so in the long run it doesn‚Äôt matter if they healed you or you healed yourself. It‚Äôs better than solely depending on your teammates to not be injured and with 4 perk slots there‚Äôs really no reason not to run it over bond. 
---
And again without self care he‚Äôs fucked in any match that either A. their teams bad or B. The killers really good  I‚Äôd rather be capable of healing myself and making saves and not be a liability for my team by being injured and not being able to hook save because I‚Äôm one shot. Times where you‚Äôll need to heal and can‚Äôt make bond useless. Only players who are confident in being injured should run bond or players who are in a SWF can depend on each other for heals but frankly new players are going to be placed with other new or not so great players and while it is a team game sometimes your team falls apart like soft bread and the best case scenario is going to be a 1 or 2 man escape and as the match goes on the less likely it is you‚Äôll find someone to heal you that isn‚Äôt busy.
---
Making woman run for their lives without a proper sports-bra, the REAL way the entity tortures his victims.
---
We will never know
---
This is a repost
---
yea the hitboxes are fair i know, i‚Äôm just salty cos of how the hitboxes are and how the seem like bs, also it‚Äôs annoying when the killer is on top of you, or you are above the killer, and even against the trapper it still hits you if it doesn‚Äôt seem like it will.
---
On the rare occasions that I bring an ebony that‚Äôs how I use it. So much more balanced where killing off first hook is kinda broken
---
Ah I misread it as having to be AWAY from the obsession
---
New Nurse skin looks sick
---
Lol sorry, didn't read that far.
---
I'd prefer they make the survivor achievements harder.\
---
As it is it makes them much more achievements, rather than participation awards.
---
Oh yea 100% agree with that
---
This reminds me of the time Monto was playing with Noob3 and Co, and he found like 3 ultra rare keys... No one should be that lucky.
---
you know in real life people can swing a weapon above their head right? It's normal... And yes the animation maybe looks a bit weird but they can't make an animation for every possible swing to make it look good.
---

This subreddit is either has a high percentage of women vs men, or this community has a high concentration of gay men.
---
I feel like every other post is posted by some thirsty teenager.
---
Who made this argument? What does being too human even mean? Plus he‚Äôd be better off as a survivor since he doesn‚Äôt exactly have any translatable power outside of ‚Äúdude with a bat is also kind of a dick sometimes‚Äù and that just screams survivor.
---
Got hooked by Leather face..... This is my life now.
---
Why doesn't he just IP block them back? I've heard of a lot of survivors using some program so they cannot be matched with any player they don't like and apparently BHVR has never forbidden the program, so why doesn't he use it like they are?
---
Fuck guy who typed "gg ez"
---
Tag yourself I‚Äôm his eyes
---
the crossover of the crossover... THE ULTIMATE CROSSOVER
---
Ah, gotcha!! And yea I agree, that would be hilarious
---
My Jake has a ridiculous amount of instaheals, keys, purple torches etc and most of my killers are well stocked up on ultra rares. Like,should I -really- bring plague's black incense to this round? I only have 17 of them
---
At least he wasn‚Äôt using Lullaby... the stupid static-y effect the Doctor makes already lags my skillchecks so hard that they might as well all be overcharges, even at 60fps. It would‚Äôve been like Ruin ++
---
Fortnite is the upside down
---
It's funny cause survivors can't even manage to follow the one rule the supposedly have lol
---
"Gg ez"
---
prob cunt brought instaheal
---
you mean, his lookers?
---
Negan is just *too* human imo. He is just too charismatic and likable, despite how many people he has executed. He's not necessarily evil evil, but more of a Lawful evil kind of guy. He geuniunely wants what will help his people, the Saviours, but the ways he goes about it are what makes him an evil kind of guy.
---
Pardon me i do indeed mean:
---
LOOKERS
---
Why are you mad if you've never played the game? Also, of course Fortnite didn't invent the dance, but where else are you going to see a demogorgan dancing?
---
Ye All we have to do it wait lmao plus we‚Äôre in Australia which is gonna be worseeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
There‚Äôs a reason for that ü•µ
---
Man I was just about to check out corrupt intervention tf
---
If more killers where viable then yes I would be all for that
---
its mainly the animation that annoys me, like they are stood on me and they get me, maybe they would be able to make an animation for every possible swing to make it look not like bs, if the game wasn‚Äôt so broken buggy, and unbalanced, sometimes i wonder why i play this dumpster fire.
---
In my head I heard the end screen music at the last panel wtf is wrong with me
---
If he gives way, they all go down too
---
***Laughs in Jumpscare Myers***
---
*Mad Grit intensifies*
---
In my head I heard the post game music at the last panel what the fuck is wrong with me
---
He also views people as a resource, so just indiscriminately killing wouldn't fit him because he only kills to make an example. He wants people under him to work, not to die.
---
I got called a tunneler last night even though 2 other people got hooked before the first one did again. Basically Jane got hooked, found Jeff downed and hooked him. David saves Jane, I‚Äôm still in the area. Down David, hook David. Go back on patrol Jane is right there. Down Jane, hook Jane. Jane suicides on hook and calls me a tunneler. My brain couldn‚Äôt even process how.
---
That was my point it sucks lol
---
Yes, the more downvotes we get the better
---
You just reminded me of pallet baccumes and infinite windows...
---
Hook vacuum should be removed, the amount of times it's screwed me out of the last percent is annoying

Banana hammock clown

That's a big ol yikes from me dog.

I'll say it right now. 12 chapters in a row with human Killers and now that's out the window cause popular series make monies

Oof

NO, IT MEANS THAT THE OBSESSION STATUS IS TO BE TRANSFERRED. OTHERWISE IT DOES ABSOLUTELY JACK SHIT IF YOU'RE THE OBSESSION

It‚Äôll be on twitch

How bout just nude clown, we all want it

He used to play fighting games.
---
Yep nice meme of people not liking facts.
---
Imagine taking a game so seriously that someone tapping crouch upsets you to the point you think it reflects poorly on their personality. 
---
I'm slowly coming to the realisation this community isn't as toxic as people make it out to be - but rather, it's one of the most superficial sensitive communities out there.
---
You need the website "Can You Run It"
---
https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri
---
I've used this website for years. It can tell you if your computer can run a game. But I'll tell you, my PC is fairly beefy and I have to run dbd on low settings. But I'm hoping dedicated servers will help with that.
---
I find survivor matches within a few seconds, its the killer that takes forever, im in Argentina by the way
---
I NEEED IIIITTTTT
---
Only instaheals and keys are OP, but they're also stronger than anything outside of Omegablink Nurse so
---
Thematically doesn't make sense either. Whole game was centered around slasher films style, now it's anything spooky and human**oid** as long as it makes money. Really bums me out.
---
What‚Äôs gonna be the perks tho? That‚Äôs the real question
---
I'm dying rn x'D
---
Basically you want to type &gt; ! ... ! &lt; without the spaces. The dots are what you want to put and you don't want a space between the first and second exclamation point.
---
I think he's just an idiot
---
finally someone who understands
---
I knew I wasn't alone
---
He's literally playing something else
---
STOP FUCKING DISCONNECTING THE SECOND YOU GET HOOKED. I GET THAT YOU MAY GET FRUSTRATED BUT YOURE HURTING YOUR TEAMMATES MORE THAN YOURE HURTING THE KILLER. 
---
ALSO STOP BEING OVERLY ALTRUISTIC. I WAS IN A GAME WHERE I WAS BEING TUNNELED BY THE KILLER THE WHOLE GAME ONLY FOR HIM TO HAVE NOED AND PUT ME IN THE BASEMENT. I WOULD UNDERSTAND GOING FOR THE SAVE ONCE YOU FOUND NOED BUT DONT STUPIDLY RISK YOUR LOVES TO GET ME WHEN THE KILLER IS CAMPING ME. I WOULD MUCH RATHER EVERYONE ELSE ESCAPE.
---
Im not even a teacher, but everytime I saw a kid that looked under 13 they did a fortnite dance. Didn't matter where I was. I could see them at a store, basketball game, or just walking on the street on my way to work. Always a fortnite dance. Were we this bad?
---
Otz's problem is he just doesn't have the experience at the moment. He's been playing for a while but he still makes a ton of mistakes. 
---
Not an issue if you aren't interested in skilful gameplay, that said.
---
HOT TIP: **SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST** IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD ON FREDDY.

*raises hand*
---
"Yes Billy?"
---
*Projectile vomit all over teacher and classmates*
---
"Now you guys go wash it off and I'll drink it up. Do I get an A now?"
---
Devs only said that a non-humanoid killer is very unlikely because of technical limitations and once they mentioned that it would look awkward, when established killers woudl run around a spaceship. But never said truelly no to a monster.
---
Maybe you have a leather kink/fetish ? Not that I would blame you üòè
---
Many things about GF are somehow sexually appealing. His menu breathing, the outfit, leather sounds, his *sigh* when is stunned, the way he drops down over you when he is mori-ing you. Yes, I main him :))
---
That reply makes me think you don't play the game
---
It wasn't much of a nerf. He was trash before and now more stable but slightly less powerful trash.
---
there‚Äôs more pallet loops then window loops 9\10 times they will be at a pallet
---
Interesting, I had no idea. I wonder why that is.
---
Missing the Michael right behind Adam.
---
Totally agree. As much as I like thrilling tremors it just isn‚Äôt as good as BBQ. And without a point bonus...not good.
---
*Rustling of clothes intensifies*
---
Did you draw?
---
Well if people are just going to not let you use your power and demote you to a M1 Killer then... yeah may as well slow the game down.
---
Not original. This old af
---
It was translated from german so sorry for grammar
---
I agree that most killers should be buffed, but there needs to be some sort of counterplay. Spirit and Nurse have next to no counterplay if they are running their broken addons and the guy in control has at least 2 braincells to rub together. At least Billy can be looped and mindgamed, Nurse and Spirit just say a big ol NOPE to both. Only counterplay is playing super immersed, which is completely unfun and boring.
---
No, we were all ashamed to be seen in public in any circumstance. Also, we had terrible clothes and hair to embarrass us, we didn't have to go out of our way to be cringey in public.
---
In a lot of ways, good! Kids today feel more comfortable expressing themselves and being silly. I just hate that they all do it exactly the same annoying way.
---
I stopped reading this rant when OP went off about killers not having map control while specifically listing the trapper.
---
Just more baby killer raging disguised as achievement hunting.
---
Would have to be Deliverance, I don‚Äôt think you can be mangled with No Mither
---
Yes! I've done a couple of these meme/art posts so far.
---
Pretty sure they use proxies because I'm pretty sure he uses MGLA or whatever it's called because he already knows in lobby who they are even with blocked profiles and constantly changing names.
---
Reminds me of a game earlier. The killer brought a BPS, but the game only lasted for like three minutes since two survivors killed themselves and I didn't manage to escape the hook. I got like 5k BP that round. I felt sorry that the Huntress pretty much had to waste one like that.
---
It's very good! Keep up the hard work!
---
Its announced and will not be cancelled. So it doesnt matter. The whole "human vs (at least a tiny bit) human" is gone already
---
Why? Dude that's hilarious, it's not true but it doesn't stop it from being funny as hell.
---
Thank you very much!
---
Why is that the Jurassic park font
---
@Otz
---
You deserve it!
---
The Vietcong soldiers are the only thing that could beat Claudette at her own game.
---
I agree. He‚Äôs evil and intense, but he dosnt have that horror vibe. They could make it work, but I don‚Äôt think he would be as scary as the other killers.
---
No, because if I use 99% of a toolbox and then escape, I can take that toolbox into another game and it has a full charge again.
---
Windows defender often does that with completely safe files or you pirated the game
---
They 3rd remove killer pick up vacuum awhile ago come to think of it which was also a bit cheap
---
He crushed a team clearly outside of his skill level and he wants to be put in the proper skill bracket for it? No dignity.
---
Let the add ons expire then.
---
It's taken from a German interview thats why

DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
I didn‚Äôt even pallet camp, I looped him for almost the whole game. He was really bad, losing sight several times and missing M1‚Äòs at every window. It just bothers me that such a inexperienced player starts to talk shit even though he was very bad.
---
Just wait till the battle pass
---
Hopper would‚Äôve been neat, but as I see it, we got two survivors that‚Äôre both awesome characters in the show, so I see this as an absolute win.
---
I looped him at every pallet.
---
Jane's Nephew
---
I only give hatch if they don‚Äôt wiggle
---
It‚Äôs the same for survivors. Gen rushing or playing immersed the whole game will give you 1pip at max. 
---
You‚Äôre supposed to actually play in the way it‚Äôs fun for both sides instead of bitching on the Internet.
---
There‚Äôs nothing else worse than someone bringing a mori into the game. The game is Literally pointless
---
Tolkien wasn't righting horror though was he? 
---
An aura of mystery is important to a horror villain, or else you end up like the Alien, where every single possible detail is out there and it is no longer even close to being scary. 
---
You don't have to start spouting bullshit to justify not liking a shoe, of you didn't like it then that's fine, but please stop talking out your ass.
---
I didn't play well, the survivors messed up. They need to depip, I shouldn't be ranked against better opponents because all I did was get lucky.
---
Wait... why do you have a Claudette that look like me and the other Claudette which looks like my brother‚Äôs one.
---
Lmaooo omg I cant even!!!!!! 1!1!1!1! Im dying please send help üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

"So how did the plague spread? Yes, Timmy?" 
---
-This lady comes and projectile vomits on the people, the generators, the pallets, the windows, everything, and then the people become broken and start spreading it themselves.
---
"...I need to speak to you after class."
---
All of the killers have an air of mystery and anonymity. Their masks and clothes help dehumanize them, and allows you to empathize better with the survivors.
---
Negan is just some asshole with a bat.
---
It bums me out that BHVR is selling out and everyone is such a fan that instead of see it for that, they gobble it up because they like both anyway. This is a sharp left turn from the famous slashers to appeal to something new and trendy.
---
The Spirit fits. She has a motive - revenge for what her father did. The plague fits, she has a motive - revenge against her God for not saving her from the corruption.
---
The 'slasher theme' is a killer with a purpose. Unless the demogorgon was a human corrupted by a plant and has some meaningful reason for killing - its out of place and yes, it bums me out.
---
I did that last night on purpose.  I only had a few seconds left and the trapper dropped traps on both exits so I figure I just make him laugh.
---
Some of the older ones arent even human?
---
Hey you did good what are you complaining about?
---
Do you want to improve? Then Play with better players, matchmaking doesnt mean shit anyways
---
Name a single killer who isn't human.
---
there are plenty of loops that rely on windows or vaults, there are TL and Z walls, some of the bigger loops ONLY have windows and there's the case of where the pallet is already used in a loop and all that's left is the window, or you just happen to be by the window instead of the pallet during a loop since again, you have no control or way of avoiding this perk at all during a chase.
---
Thank you :)
---
Why not?
---
The mindflayer could give access to the entity, so the demogorgon could be controlled by the entity or be given intellect.
---
Combine this with Aftercare and you've got a perfect mother build for Steve
---
This guy gets it.  The Emblem system is the way it is for a reason.  It's the same way for Survivors.  If it was just about winning, you'd get max points for just gen rushing and escaping the match.  It's about the chase.  The whole act of everything.  Unhooking.  Baiting.  The real goal is not escaping or a 4K.  It's about a balanced match encompassing everything.  That's why that nets you the most BP.  You're playing for The Entity.  His entertainment.  Not yours.
---
4k isn't winning. It's just the counter for how many people are killed. You can clearly see in every end game lobby that you're not graded on kills, you're graded on how much you toyed with them, and controlled the game BEFORE killing them.
---
The categories are: Gatekeeper, Brutality, hunting, AND Sacrifice.
---
If you focus purely on that last emblem only, you're going to get a low score. You don't even get an Iri Sacrifice emblem unless you get 9 hooks. Even if you kill everyone.
---
TL;DR Killers objective isn't only to kill survivors. It's to run them around like scared sheep, and THEN kill them.
---
I hoard in pretty much every game I play, it is one of the most things I can't stop doing and always have done ever since I started playing games. In dbd however I just started telling myself "well if I don't use them, then when will I? They'll just be useless" and thus I started using my stuff more often
---
Yes, and he was average at best and had much fewer viewers.
---
Hahaha, well done.
---
Oh no not the clock man anything but the clock man
---
just gotta hope it doesn't drop just as rank reset hits.
---
Easy Anti-Cheat is a part of Epic Games that is probably the reason why it is there
---
It's the Firewall. Windows is telling you that the game has to access the internet for it to work, and gives you the option to allow or forbid it. This happens with literally every internet-connected application.
---
I assume this is an "Anti-tunneling" or self-sacrifice perk. Hide the guy you unhooked while lighting yourself up as the target.
---
It can't be that because that causes exhaustion permanently while in Madness 3. The exhaustion here is temporary and they're in Madness 1
---
Cool concept and all, but what the fuck is a "monster truck"
---
Yes. Myers is also called the Shape, and he's in his first state, evil within 1.
---
I mean Myers is quite durable for human, he loved being shot in the face with shotgun
---
Idk what platform you're using, but if you are on ps4 I'm down with playing with your account and getting 2k shards
---
"Just take a map next game"
---
I'm tired of all the complaining about camping and tunneling and shit. Yes, it sucks, but it happens get over it. There are annoying things on both sides
---
I'm fucking dying I love this format
---
I've been playing for like 13 days total and got it at rank 13 against a rank 11 killer. 
---
We are going to have to sit down and talk about what impossible means.
---
I have heard that too but I have also seen many people just make new accounts. A lot of youtubers have done this, one that comes to mind is Noob3. I think he was banned twice but just kept making new accounts.
---
inb4 it's just teleporting and crouch/crawling
---
Well there's an informed opinion. /s
---
Thank you so much, i prefer comments like this or even dumb, or even just some comments istead of upvotes
---
I don‚Äôt think he uses the reddit lol
---
It‚Äôs just a popular legion build because it‚Äôs what works well. I‚Äôd also recommend using the add on that makes them broken on a 2nd frenzy stab, and duration increase
---
As long as the teleport and crawling is good I'd be okay with it
---
You'll also get the super fun thing caused by people with a large rank desparity playing together, where you end up against a rank 20, a rank 1, a rank 12 and a rank 16.
---
Also nice cosplay. You look like you're ready to throw some iridescent hatchets at meg
---
I just started praying
---
Ok I just thought It was otz because of the build he recommended, but thanks for the addon reccomendation
---
To be fair, in the complete mess of a timeline that is Halloween, in the cult of thorn storyline Michael is blessed with superhuman abilities (strength, healing etc.)
---
r/totallynotrobots
---
Yeah, heres hoping it's not another F tier that gets nerfed pre-launch
---
Ty i met some nice survivors with the hatchet
---
I honestly thought nobody played legion because of how unfun he is against survivors
---
Freddie is literally a demon. 
---
Nurse and Spirit are undead.
---
Hag is BHVR's take on a Wendigo.
---
They are not human in the game.
---
Ghostface no pants
---
It‚Äôs funny taxidermy
---
why would i care on the first place? anything announced on events will be known in a little. all cosplayers tag their cosplay, if i wanted to see them, I'd go on Instagram or Twitter or wherever else they post it. i'd much rather do that than being shoved an ugly mug into my eyes.
---
Yep, they did really good with freddy not instantly nerfing him, so I have my Hope's up
---
Likely intentional simply to forge a connection to the original ghostface. They didnt have access to the original, but the spirit is certainly there, the same basic idea.
---
Isn't there a word for people like that?
---
I had a killer last night who AFKd for the first 4 gens and then when he inevitably lost, blamed us on SFW....
---
but we weren't, we all loaded in separately :(
---
Make him default dance
---
He kinda needs a mask though to make him terrifying
---
Need context. Did you actually camp and tunnel?
---
Add me for survivor team up "Miss. Timing" on steam. Tell me you're from this post and I'll put you in my discord.

There was a sale on for the last few weeks, all DLC except charity case and Ghostface was on sale, must‚Äôve just ended because it was a few weeks ago I picked up Halloween for like ¬£3
---
the entity gets it's power from fear. It lives for the chase, it lives to crush hope. It doesn't want to see people die early, it wants to see them writhe in pain and slowly give up hope. Killing them just makes extra steps
---
Newbie question here - why are these memes always about Meg sprinting away? I've checked her perks and I wasn't able to find anything related to sensing the killer so why always Meg?
---
2pm stream? wot, is there one today?
---
I just wanted to play a game, not have slurs and personal attacks shouted at me
---
Yep. Jason has been and is in legal hell for a long while. F13 the game is pretty much a bugged shithole because of it, if Jason ever were to come to DBD it won't be for a long time.
---
Look at the window
---
Yep, it reveals the demogorgon's power, perks, as well as steve and Nancy's perks
---
This was the first thing i assumed when the teaser came out. My first thought was- demogorgon would be the greatest killer, but they also said they'd only make humanoids... So my theory was they'd make some kind of mind flayer army killer or Billy as a killer, which obviously wouldn't be as good, but I thought they'd stick to their rule.
---
I'm glad they broke that rule!
---
it should also affect players that disconnect since they disconnected because of the fact they fear death
---
This was posted yesterday in a not a low effort post  by the people who actually did the interview but whatever
---
boy. it's not about "not being explained" even. it's about a fact that we in dbd have *L O R E*. you can't just put in a killer without lore or explanation of what our main concept is looking in for in this killer. 
---
as far as i know after reading few articles, this monster has nothing to suggest the Entity and vice versa.
---
But what if I want all of those things?
---
A tad bit late there, buddy. I've already gotten all of my Adepts. But yeah, after the first few frustrating attempts I just depipped myself to yellow ranks by intentionally slugging and making misplays so that the new emblem system wouldn't hinder me as much because of the diffetence between 14 to 16 at yellow and below versus 15-16 at green ranks and higher. I also developped strategies for each killer. For instance, plague was near impossible to get chaser points for due to her ability. I got my Adept there by being a classic M1 killer and optimizing my hooking/actively avoiding tunneling and patrolling like my life depended on it.
---
you sound like an ass hole :/
---
Not all of the killers ingame have legit reasons for wanting to kill people besides the fact that they're just crazy. Ghost face for instance is just a psychopath, LF doesn't understand right and wrong, it's in Michael's nature to kill similar to how the demogorgon acts on instinct as well.
---
Are you kidding?
---
Freddy was a human, he had a whole movie explaining how he was bullied on the map he came with and why he died. He's human.
---
Nurse is a WW2 "angel of death" compelled to end the suffering of her patients by killing them. She's a human.
---
Spirit was a girl murdered by her father after he was fired from his job and had no way to provide for his family. Her dying wish was a rage fueled plea to get revenge. She's human.
---
Hag also has a backstory and is a cannibal. The rune she uses to teleport has significant meaning to her pre-entity state. She's also a human.
---
Nobody is human in the trials of you use that logic. Everyone is dead. They're still God damn humans.
---
Demogorgon? Alien plant with munchies, I guess.
---
Legion mains rise up
---
One of her teachable perks is 'sprint burst'. It allows her to run 150% faster normal running speed when she runs for a short time.
---
I love this so much
---
STOP BULLYING MY BABYüò≠
---
Probably wishful thinking but I so want them to give us an early PTB afterwards as a surprise.
---
Meg has sprint burst
---
That would be awesome, but probably won't happen
---
Tbh for this game...any shirtless outfits are going to sell
---
I'd call someone else talented, dude's average at the game
---
"You better knock it off right now buster!"
---
For about a year BBQ wasn't in the shrine. Solid 11-13 months iirc. At that point, most people gave up and bought bubba.
---
this is just nice for newer players/people who are just wanting to try out killer.
---
I see. I'm still a baby Meg apparently. D:
---
Not really. The skeleton wouldn‚Äôt be any different, just elongated in certain areas. And the posture isn‚Äôt related to the skeleton, it‚Äôs more to do with the animations, I think. Basically, so long as the killer is distinctly humanoid, it can still use the same skeleton.
---
Ruin, infectious freight, monitor and abuse, discordance.
---
You say that like we don't have 100+ posts a day talking about that...
---
K i l l  y o u r s e l f
---
Maybe I'll actually be able to get kills as killer now.
---
They WERE human.
---
They are NOLONGER human. That's what I'm saying. They are now completely different beings with humanoid figures. They're unnatural creatures. So getting butthurt over the whole "human" thing doesn't make sense unless you get upset over most of the other killers available.
---
Yo that's a crisp pencil
---
Feel free to add me. My psn tag is Arkham_Knight813. Im new to playing survivor
---
Dayyyyym.
---
What are you? One of the baby killers that thinks nurse is balanced and the other killers are unplayable?
---
Thks for the warning lad im at school with a whole lotta ppl around lol F to you tho :p
---
Keep at it, as you learn you'll improve out of baby status :)
---
Ohhhh shitttttttt
---
The demogorgans are controlled by the Mind Flayer. 
---
Maybe the entity made a deal with the Mind Flayer? The mind Flayer has been shown to be capable of communication and reasoning. 
---
There's your lore, now if you could promptly put all your toys back in the pram...
---
Harder mommy huntress
---
Camping and tunneling is cancer ngl. Only exception is doing it if the survivors are cancer.
---
Rip
---
Omg I forgot aboit Monitor and Abuse. Ive been using it on her some and it hella works good on her
---
NO DONT, any shred of innocence left in your body will be ripped out faster than you can say shirtless david
---
Oh god, I remember that series.
---
Just like every other rank 1 killer, he is nothing special

"He's just standing there, menacingly" Myers

I used on kyf and my friends were so confused it was funny af.
---
Okay yeah but all the human killers are corrupted or driven insane. Negan is just kinda normal. Even in the show hes not a bad guy. To the people in his community hes the protagonist. It's only in our view of the show is he portrayed as the villan
---
Why do you dislike tje series?
---
*look away, look away*

but Janet  is a female name

---
So can someone help my confusion, is the ghost face from the game the same ghost face from scream like billy or stu, it is ghostface bhvrs own take on the killer?
---
https://youtu.be/5vRlJrkxsqo
---
I want moreeeeee licensed stuff
---
Literally of them have a reason. Ghostface does it for sport, he enjoys fucking with people and having fun before actually getting to the kill. He doesn't take it seriously. They're all psychopaths, they're mass murderers.
---
LF?
---
Meyer's instinct is constantly referred to both with his power name and with the movies. A dark evil builds within him, stalking his prey with eerie confidence from afar.
---
Demogorgon, again, is just a hungry alien plant. I understand Myers might not be super fleshed out himself, but what the fuck lore does the Demogorgon have? I genuinely don't know.
---
[ye](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1163828121633787904)
---
Everytime I read cunt I say it how Noob3 says it now, curse him!
---
Meyers has a human body but is possessed by an "ancient evil:  
---
huntress is a woman who spent her entire life hunting in the woods, making her a powerful savage.  
---
Ghost face is just human, who is insane and stalks his prey for months.  
---
The clown drugs people and then cuts off their limbs  
---
The legion... is really shitty and I agree with that one  
---
Amanda may be a person but she has switch blades, complicated mechanical traps, and just general blood lust.  
---
Negan is a guy with a fucking bat. Great...  
---
  
---
(im ignoring the fact that each person gets mutated some way when they are brought into the realm of the entity)
---
Neat :)
---
I made a Payday 2 chapter and I think that would've been cool
---
Dead by Daylight does not advertise itself as a slasher multiplayer game. It plainly says that it is a horror multiplayer game. Collaborating with Stranger Things is not a sharp left turn for the company, it is still in keeping with its horror theme. The slasher genre is simply a subgenre of horror. 
---
The crux of your argument, that dbd is a slasher theme game, is simply not factual.
---
If we can‚Äôt even get a new Jason in HIS OWN GAME than I doubt we will get Jason in Dbd. Btw we still need Chucky
---
Ive been running Nurse's, Ruin, BBQ, and NOED on him and do pretty decent til I start hittinf the upper ranks
---
I say it naturally as I'm an Aussie.
---
You're right. I have no idea why people care so much about teabagging. Just ignore it.
---
Summon zombies by blasting an air horn, slow zombies fill a section of the map and can grab survivors making them struggle like caught in a bear trap, they can also make moving around that area a nightmare
---
Uno reversal
---
If you like bloodpoints, another fun combo would be BBQ, Distressing, thanatophobia and either sloppy butcher or Nurse's calling.
---
Yes but they can improve this on both sides by BHVR. Just because we have chosen to put up with it doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be improved.
---
Alien and Predator are both Disney, who has always maintained a pretty open stance on licensing for games, despite what most people think.
---
Examples: Marvel vs Capcom, Thanos and the Avengers In Fortnite, Wreck It Ralph being in a Sonic racing game, Kingdom Hearts, etc.
---
IIRC most of their properties have a packet they give the dev that basically serve as rules. If they agree, they can work something out. The rules are usually just ‚ÄúStick to the tone of the character, make sure the lore is right, don‚Äôt have Donald Duck saying fuck and shooting people.‚Äù
---
They probably wouldn‚Äôt object to vicious killer aliens being in a game like Dead By Daylight.
---
I play them at rank resets sometimes, they‚Äôre fun against lower ranks, but you get bullied at high ranks most the time
---
Even if that were the case, the killers can always smack you with Franklin's Demise.  You can't keep an item you can't hold on to.  I'd even argue that if the game operated how you suggest then Franklin's Demise should be buffed to cause items that have zero charges to completely disappear,  instant heals should cause med kits to vanish, and brand new parts should cause tool boxes to vanish.
---
If you want charges to last longer, just equip Street Wise.  Use add-ons that increase charges or improve speed and/or efficiency.  In the case of med kits, use Botany Knowledge and/or Self Heal.
---
I'll reiterate this again.  As someone who plays both sides, I firmly believe no one should have infinite items/add-ons.
---
Ace main big brain
---
Then nobody is human, not eve the survivors because everyone is dead. What do you want? The Demogorgon was never human. Never had motives, never had a life, has no backstory besides existing. It's absolutely boring and a stark contrast to how the other chapters exist.
---
The entity corrupted them, yes, but it did so in a way that was manifested by their previous life. With the Demogorgon, the entity just teleported him to the trials I guess. No corruption, no alteration, just ctrl c and ctrl v.
---
I'm butthurt because it's fucking boring and a cash grab and nobody is calling it out because they're riding the hype train so hard. Stop getting defensive just because you like the show. I don't care one way or the other about the show, I care about my Killers having som God damn juicy lore.
---
So want to see Chucky carrying David King 2 inches off the ground.
---
I have fucked on many an enemy in my adventures. A champion of the gods, my Paladin has rained divine justice down on immortals and mortals alike, but that thing, it terrifies me.
---
See like the thing is that I'm afraid of trying to play like bubba or freddy because I dont know how either works
---
You can add me of you want. :) psn: Amoresaur
---
sweeeet, 2pm what time zone though? and where did they even say that there will be a stream?
---
I disagree.
---
So the Demogorgon doesn‚Äôt work because it doesn‚Äôt have a good motive? It‚Äôs a monster, a predatory one at that. It‚Äôs motivation is to kill and devour. It‚Äôs not going to think ‚Äúhmmm yes, today I feel like enacting unnecessary revenge on this random person I‚Äôve never seen before!‚Äù The demogorgon kills for food, which yeah, might seem a wee bit out of place when it goes around hooking people, but they could always make an explanation
---
What time is the livestream?
---
What is the perk I con for noed
---
This is... too real
---
I just wanna reach it for the cheevo so I can 100% this game.
---
Furthest I‚Äôve gotren so far is like rank 9. It‚Äôs gets brutally hard
---
EST, I think on Twitter and the forums
---
Yeah it's good. Too much stigma around it. One of my favorite cursed.
---
she's really good, throw on the apples or if you have them, use her UR add-ons and having survivors not cleanse is an EZ 4k. Then if you face survivors who do cleanse, EZ 4k because you have corrupt purge.
---
I will still never see why so many people consider her low tier because survivors don't cleanse, she has anti-stealth and good tracking and has the choice of either always having insta-downs(not cleansing), or having a super strong ranged down.
---
yo, to all of you freaking out about how the Demogorgon eats people
---
I have to remind you that the Hag exists, and she's literally a cannibal who rips out your internal organs to snack on
---
It feeds off their hope, rather than fear.
---
If you dont need skill to get a 4k then you should get to higher ranks.
---
You say that. And then he tiers up to 3 and everyone gets exposed. That new exposed shit is fucking annoying and spooky
---
Perhaps you haven't seen other rank 1 killers streamers or you haven't been in red ranks..you would know Tru3 isn't that big of a deal
---
So he slowed you down, but just a little bitüòã
---
Hopefully chapter 13 is received well enough that maybe we could get the xenomorph and ripely.
---
Sydney Prescott as a survivor &gt; Nancy as a survivor
---
Bit rude, was just trying to share an idea
---
Hmmm this might get me blasted with downvoted or something but I honestly don't think negan would be a great killer in the game. Whilst there are people in the game they all seem to be deranged in some shape or form, don't get me wrong Negan is deranged but it's just the fact that he still acts like a human, if not a bad one but he still talks to people and seems more like an average f'ed up person rather than a killer type person
---
sure buddy next time ill give you my keyboard to comment for me. since you are obviously figured everything out. teenagers nowadays. it is just a phase. now ape, I'm not interested to have a further conversation with you everything you will send will be ignored.
---
I dont see the point in doing that though. If I can kill them in a blink, I will.
---
Try to avoid making posts like these, as there are already dedicated threads for this exact purpose. The next round for that one should be tomorrow. Aside from that, my PSN is AtomicQuares. Feel free to add me.
---
PTB always come out on Tuesdays, so likely not.
---
we know Entity as a vampire feeding on feelings and emotions. parry this, casual. what can Mind Flayer or demogorgon give her?
---
I've been downvoted for defending Negan as a killer lol. You'll be fine
---
Why is the quality so potato.
---
Should be in 4 hours if i'm not mistaken
---
It's literally been posted 100 times around the sub
---
Discordance, surveillance, Franklin's demise, and unrelenting right now- watch what items survivors  load into the game with cause when I see 2 or 3 toolboxes.... automatically switch franklins demise on. I just love Franklin's demise cause ive literally turned heads out of disbelief when they drop that shit during my feral frenzy attack.
---
In 4 hours.
---
I heard the devs made them purposefully powerful to attract new players to buy the DLC. I fear however that after the sale is complete, the nerf bomb is gonna break everyone's legs.
---
I'm blind af!
---
Hope not, lol
---
That sounds really fun I'm going to try that one out once I get everything in check
---
So in order to be something, it has to advertise as it? Fallout 4 advertises as an RPG and you can ask around, it's really hard to believe.
---
The collaboration is for no other reason than popularity and monetization potential. Myers is a slasher, Freddy is a slasher, leather face, Ghostface, ect. Why wait until now to make a nonhuman, purely 'horror' chapter? Why not a xenomorph or some thing not so obviously trendy. Surely there are horror characters from around the same period they've pulled Myers and Freddy from. Why jump ahead?
---
The only conclusion I can reach is for easy popularity and game sales. My argument is my opinion from what I observe. Show me evidence to the contrary and by all means I'll change my tune.
---
Perhaps you may just have a different opinion and that's cool?
---
Im not trying to be mean but how tha fuck dosent watch Stranger
---
                            Things
---
Yes. There's no fatigue in this game.
---
Literally every single post you are making right now has already been on the frontpage. Just stop.
---
I'm probably not big brain enough for that tbh.
---
I played my first game of Dbd today and literally got killed in the first 10 seconds I was like what‚Äôs that noise and everyone started running and the doctor just wrecked me I was shook and laughing.
---
The Girl could be the survivor (can't remember her name) and the "dark" Simon could be the killer
---
Count Olaf Killer when?????
---
Alright thanks
---
(Casual? Jesus man, go outside, talk to a girl)
---
It's still a creature. In season 2 we clearly see a Demogorgan develop an attachment and even a love for the character of Dustin. So they obviously feel things.
---
Did you actually do research like you claim? You couldn't of read much cause this is all off of the top of my head.
---
I usually just use this site [https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/dead-by-daylight/13375](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/dead-by-daylight/13375)
---
B A R B
---
I'm not being defensive because I "like the show" (which I never said I did) I'm just pointing out the fallacy in that argument. It's okay not to be a fan of the new chapter because you don't care for the new characters/killer but don't be a party pooper for everyone else who's excited.
---
BHVR is trying something new, and for that I support them. You don't have to, that's on you. I think it's cool they're adding in an actual preditorial animalistic killer who's only instinct is to kill. I think that fits in with their whole horror theme even if it's not capable of having a juicy backstory to read during thosd agonizing lobby que times.
---
F I N G E R G U N Z
---
Lmao, so everything that have emotions is human? How do you know that the Demogorgon doesn't have emotions? Ghosts, dream demons and a wendigo aren't humans.
---
Oof, he complains. I remember when I downed him as Billy and he called bullshit and gave up.
---
Lmao this is perfect
---
Bruh, every BHVR original survivor is alive.
---
i read the lore article. and as said, only seen first season. i did not know that, it wasn't in the article
---
(i'm a married woman, mate, i only go out to gym and for groceries, not going to talk to girls)
---
Add me on PSN: AtomicQuares mention Reddit so I know how you found me. XD
---
Agreed. Also, sometimes you must area camp at end game. Depends on the scenario. But in general, yes it‚Äôs a terrible way to play.
---
same goes for both survivors/killer who will try to ruin baby incoming new experience :/. yes, Russians players I'm speaking to you.
---
In my opinion Myers is barely human from what we see in movies.
---
It‚Äôs the fact that cosplayers dressed as Myers actually uhhhhhhh show things. 
---
The Suzie cosplay is nice though.
---
Coming to Gamescom tomorrow! 
---
See you in the Fog! :D
---
Fake, this 'Monto' is not wearing legacy pants.
---
Season 2 is a bit more dull but you definitely have to push through it to get to season 3, it doesn't disappoint!
---
This, they don‚Äôt care.
---
you‚Äôre being booed because you‚Äôre afraid
---
Every killer until Demogorgon has a motive and backstory you can read through their biography in-game. Some even have movies compiling a much larger narrative. I've never seen stranger things but I've yet been told if the Demogorgon has any lore beyond alien plant monster.
---
The Killers aren't monsters. They're corrupted humans with reasons. Maybe not good reasons, maybe poorly written even, but every fucking one of them is better than *"predatory monster noises"*
---
This isn't Evolve. It isn't 4 hunters against a mindless monster. It's 4 characters trying to survive a psychopathic killer. Even the word killer implies more than 'monster' or 'predator'.. The Demogorgon is generic in comparison to even the worst written killer and fans of the series refuse to see that because they like the show so much. It really blows for people like me who don't really care for the show and just want quality characters and content.
---
Herman Carter [DBD] and Hans Volter [KF2]

Change my mind.
---
Afraid of what XD

---
You were arguing that behavior deviated from the slasher theme game when they were never a slasher themed game in the first place. Its all horror. 
---
It is only your misconception that they should adhere to slasher killers to be in keeping with the theme of the game.
---
The demogorgon fits right in the horror genre, dead by daylight never deviated from the theme thay they set in the game, which is horror.
---
Bruh why is the neck playing CS? It's gotta be there for the stream today! It needs to be getting ready!
---
Right. For all we know, the teleporting can be crap and near useless.
---
I will reiterate that slasher is simply a subgenre of horror. 
---
Dead by Daylight, on their steam page and on the wiki, clearly and plainly describes it as a horror multiplayer game. 
---
Yes it has slasher killers and that is because it is a horror game. Now, the fact that they announced an upcoming killer that isn't a slasher does not mean that they are already sell outs because of the clear fact that they never restricted themselves to slasher killers in the first place. 
---
Is Dead by Daylight a horror game? Yes
---
Does it have slasher killers? Yes
---
Is slasher theme a subgenre of horror? Yes
---
Is the Demogorgon categorized as horror? Yes
---
Ergo they never deviated from their main theme which is horror. 
---
You're pushing the argument that Dead by Daylight is a slasher game when clearly they have never restricted themselves to that subgenre.
---
It's got excellent timing in the cut between the movie and game. Quite well done!
---
It wasnt actually a very good killer at all? it was wildly imbalanced, and kind of a hodgepodge of ideas that already exist.
---
But then they'd be writing lore into Stranger Things unless the whole chapter is this isolated "totally not Canon but it's here" thing they did with Bill. I'm eager to read the demogorgon bio but I hope I won't be as disappointed as I expect.
---
Nah she‚Äôs one of the best
---
The 2nd survivor is still on hook so just a few more seconds then it will open
---
We know, Adam
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a humanoid not not human
---
I like the way you word it, because there are times when camping is the right move. It's just sad because new players don't even realize they're hurting not only others, but themselves as well.
---
No one cares that Camping is a dick move.
---
People shouldn't camp because it's horribly inefficient gameplay and will lose you more than it will gain you.
---
DON'T LET THEM GET YOU DOWN. FREDDY IS FUN, PLAY HIM! YOU'LL PLAY AGAINST MORE NICE PEOPLE THAN BULLIES LIKE THAT!
---
All those heavy pallets too. Entity has so much wood for the Survivors.
---
Yea
---
Dead by Disconnect
---
Can it be considered hoarding add-ons when 95% of them are useless on my pig? Because I have over 100 of everything on my pig. I've also got a few survivors that I use a lot that are approaching the same amount of items and well over that if you combine them since all survivors are basically the same anyways. 
---
I never bring anything into a match as a survivor because the majority of people who play killer are so fuckin petty it's unreal.
---
Oh no he brought one of 200 brown toolboxes, better get Franklin's in my loadout. It's honestly gotten to the point that I bring shit into a match just to drop it and get rid of it.
---
There's no way to use all of this stuff and I can't even believe there's another post in here sayin they want to keep the items forever without it being consumed when you used 100% of the charges for the item. What is even the point when you can't get rid of the shit you have now. Bruh what?
---
Pscht
---
What I want to see is a Resident Evil chapter with Leon as the survivor and Mr.X as the killer.
---
Camping is already discouraged. You get no bloodpoints and derank unless all of the survivors get themselves killed going for saves, then you black pip.
---
Literally every killer was once human. And if they mean humane, thats b.s because negan makes people into ground Glenn.
---
Oh OK, I will make sure to keep that in mind next time! Thank you! :)
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs going to be the same thing as Freddy and Micheal
---
Killers can slash over low objects though?
---
It‚Äôs Hag, but you can teleport whenever, but they can interrupt it somehow.
---
Or, I don't let him see where my teammates are at.
---
I still have nightmares about old d strike
---
When you don't make a caption
---
Is this a hope or is it actually happening?
---
I see where you're coming from. Did BHVR confirm their games theme was slasher? If so then taking this step away from that is a bold and risky move and I would understand the backlash from doing that. If it's not an actual pledge then it's understandable that when an opportunity like this happens, even if the Demogorgon isn't essentially a slasher killer, that they would take this chance to add something new to the game.
---
No worries! I could see how I would come off as a try hard fan. It's okay not to agree with their choice but I hope you test out the new chapter first before having a solid stance, that's what I'm waiting to do.
---
WILL DO, THANKS FOR THE REVENGE PLAN
---
You are 100% free to do that, as you've seen. But if you don't want to follow the point system as they have laid it before you, you don't get to complain about how the ranking system works. It follows a system, and you don't want to be a part of that.
---
Want to meet? üòÇ
---
nah its confirmed demodaddy is getting cosmetics [here](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/roadmap) "Each Chapter introduces a new fantasy in the Dead by Daylight universe, bringing new characters with their own backstory, unique gameplay mechanics, progression, and set of cosmetics"
---
WHAT? HOW DOES THAT WORK.
---
I hope it all comes together too
---
They still have a perk for camping, Insidious. It is a game mechanic. 
---
As of now, the best way for them to learn is for you to get gens done when they camp. They are giving up the game and not doing anything. It takes time and confidence to be able to find and down others. 
---
A better solution would be giving killers BBQ as their base kit, and Kindred in survivor Base Kit (with WGLF).  Then, the tutorial can actually show the killer and survivors the effects of camping because all camping (in the immediate area) will be visible. BBQ will also get the killer off the hook because they know where to go.
---
Comic con? Where are you now?
---
Man I thought that was Lin-Manuel Miranda and thinking "What does he have to do with DbD?"
---
Well, Thank you üòÇü•≥
---
Had a game where a swf made fun of my rank while their swf was the same rank as me..
---
because the mindless drones on reddit feel they all have to shitpost about every little thing if they announced a new skin ahead of time people would spam garbage meme's and their opinion about it like its a thing to do. doesn't make it hype.
---
In mid to high ranks yea, but newer players don't know that, they don't realize they're hurting themselves by camping, they think it's a good strategy to camp since nothing ingame tells them this
---
Yeah, its his power the devs sead that he Will be abol to teleport/go thro his tunol thing, and he is going to be a killer that slows the game down.
---
Still better than Iri Hatchet.
---
You can say subgenre a million times, my statements stay exactly the same. The subgenre is a specific part of the overall generic horror. There is significant difference between subgenre horror and general horror.
---
I don't care how it's advertised. I dont care what they call it for marketing purposes. It doesn't prove one way or the other what the game actually is. I used the fallout example for a reason, refer back to it as needed.
---
The game until now has fit specifically in the subgenre of slasher themed horror. Only now, because of this killer, is it being pulled out to general horror. They skipped xenomorphs and other wildly popular, predatory Killers for a reason. Unless they double back and start throwing them in, they were aiming for specifics.
---
Your argument can be boiled down to
---
"is crash bandicoot a video game character? Is dead by daylight a video game? No deviation whatsoever."
---
Me or the nea? üòÇ
---
They never threw the lore away because there was never a statement about no beasts/monsters in the entities realm. If you‚Äôre talking about the no non-humanoids thing the devs said, that was because they don‚Äôt want to rig up a new skeleton for a killer. Doesn‚Äôt even matter because the Demogorgon is a humanoid. If you‚Äôre complaining about it because you think it doesn‚Äôt make sense lore wise, don‚Äôt try to think of your personal headcanon as confirmed.
---
look at the window
---
Insidious needs a full rework
---
What is broken about it? Please tell me what is broken and unbalanced about this game.
---
WHY DO I NEVER HIT MY DECISIVE STRIKE? I USE BRAND NEW PARTS ALL THE TIME AND HIT THEM WITH EASE BUT FOR SOME GODDAMN REASON IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO 'SKIP' OVER THE DECISIVE SKILL CHECK FFSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
They all most likely died before being taken by the Entity.
---
Ya boy Adam was in a derailed train and got hit by a metal door flying at incredible hihg speed. 
---
Give as soon as he was hit, he woke up in the Entity's realm, it's pretty fair to say he was killed on impact and immediately abducted.
---
and since it's explicitly stated this is also what happened to Quentin, Bill, Tapp (and even Amanda), it's likely dying is key to being taken
---
Yas! :3
---
will be there on saturday aswell üòÇ
---
Downvoted to keep you on 69
---
There should be a ~10% haste buff for survivors being chased for 60 seconds after being hooked. It could be balanced by applying a progression/skill check penalty to anyone under the effects. So if you're getting chased you can't use the haste buff to   sneak gen progress in. 
---
Only have the haste buff/penalty be applied if the killer is in range and has LoS. So you can work on gens if it's a safe escape while not also being an overpowered zoomer. 
---
This alone would discourage tunneling without providing too much of a benefit to survivors.
---
I think I just missed it üò≠
---
I will never get tired of this no matter how many times it gets reposted
---
sorry for the repost, I couldnt figure out how to embed a video. i am 2 IQ. Anyways feel free to flame me now.
---
Not if it's on a public event
---
Possibly early Demogorgon concept designs. It's also possible that Netflix drew up some designs specifically for this.
---
This so much. Pathetic how the second best killer in the entire game it's so easy to play as.
---
That whole thing about emotions just doesnt fit when killer is a mindless beast *shrugs*
---
1) it's a horror game dude, check the sub reddit description. Yes but for example a wearwolf would have been far better as a non human killer, at least coming out of ghost face.
---
2) as a fan of the show and the game I can sorta guess the main abilities of the killer. Also theres holes and such in the pictures posted. Perhaps a tunnelling system? Regardless a sort of hag map control ability.  For the demegorgon.
---
you can reply yourself one more time, gonna make your argument better :D
---
Not impressed, I watched it at least 5 times.
---
I think it would actually be better if it activated quicker. Then it could be used for fake outs in chases, especially for teleporting or fast killers.
---
Are you suggesting that both killers and survivors are paid actors?
---
I'm here since wednesday so tomorrow will be my last day. Do you know the gamescom camp?
---
I like this
---
Now bout *no*
---
Yep, this would be cool
---
How bout *no*
---
One piece Bikini. Borat style. Duh.
---
Killers are just tools to get emotions out of the survivors. The Demogorgon, which was literally controlled by a telepathic entity in a season of the show, fits perfectly into the lore.
---
But why is it too hard to just not use the last 1%?
---
All bets are off once the gates are open, lol.  If I'm getting bullied by a SWF and finally manage to hook one during collapse, I'm just gonna wait.
---
She's definitely not the easiest killer to play, but it's much less skill required than nurse.
---
Any chance you've come because of the Stranger Things thing?
---
Ah so you admit then that you disregard what Dead by Daylight chooses to define itself by in favor of what you define it by? You dictate what Dead by Daylight should be and call them out when they perform actions which does not adhere to what you think they should be doing then?
---
You only have " I think this is what Dead by Daylight should be and I dont care what it calls it because this is what I think it is, facts be damned."
---
Well I suppose there's no arguing with that mindset.
---
You forgot to add pig to that list, if you seen the saw films you would know that she is pretty hot
---
How tall are you? Asking for a friend...
---
Negan is human, he is sane, he doesn't just want to murder people. He has reservations. None of the other killers exhibit those things. Negan would really break the immersion for me and a lot of others
---
That's my sleep paralysis demon right there.
---
So in what way will he be OP?
---
We were all babies once, only way to grow is to keep going :)
---
I'm saying it's more like someone else said here and it's like Cabin in the Woods.  Both the Survivors and Killers are there for The Entity's amusement and pleasure.  It's pretty much said so lore wise.  You finish too quick, not as happy as a long, thrilling back and forth game.
---
I already hate this perk with passion
---
Yeah. Or maybe the perk causes your red stain and terror radius to move forward while you stand still instead of just disappear. That would really allow for fake outs in jungle gyms or around the shack.
---
That was actually a really smart joke
---
Dont worry about the downvotes, speaks for itself what type of people are downvoting you.
---
Good choice! ace is... f i n e

Finally, someone said it.
---
You waited till the last second to escape didnt you?
---
This doesn't stop that as it's easy to be careful with an item, just needlessly tedious.
---
I take an apple with increased duration corruption+infectious. That's how you down the entire team in one go
---
Playing Jake is the new meta
---
Banana hammock Demogorgon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shirtless Myers
---
No confirmation, I assume to give them room for claims like I'm making, but looking at the game it's really hard to ignore the slasher themes.
---
Fixing generators to escape a psychopathic murderer hunting down defenseless survivors. A chase always breaks out, the killer never finishes them off immediately but instead hooks them for some unknown reason giving a chance for escape. Even when everyone else is dead, the tension remains as the last survivor desperately searches for a way out (that doesn't make a ton of sense because why wouldn't everyone just do it from the start) through the special hatch.
---
It seems like the entity is the "slasher movie magic" in the sense that it's an explanation for what we'd see in a slasher movie. Everything about this game screams slasher but it seems hard to convince people.
---
Ill take a look at the new chapter but I'll be honest, I'm looking forward to whatever the next one is. I'm sure I'll want the demogorgon perks or something but I don't know. Game play wise it's a crapshoot, design wise I'm not super thrilled. Either way, appreciate the discussion. Hope it turns out good.

I see. A circus simulator.

Me:ses that the vid has 4,800 dis likes 
---
Me to 4,800 People:way are you gay
---
He's not wrong
---
Oh i see
---
Its gamescom. I think its in Germany
---
I just don't get it. When I explained there were 2 hooks in between, the story changed to well "you only caught me cus your internet is trash and you lagged into me". No I only caught her cus she went maybe 20m away into the corn and tried to hide with an injured Jane and I have ears.
---
He just spins David on his finger like a basketball
---
*laughs in spinechill*
---
If you're playing at rank 10
---
This is excusable
---
Pig was definitely difficult as her perks aren‚Äôt terribly intuitive to helping. But as of late, Trapper, Freddy, or Huntress all gave me a time.
---
It's Michael tho
---
both this sub and osrs sub are the only ones that post quality stuff like this üòÇ
---
i nearly missed the myers and honestly only noticed because of a comment pointing it out lmao.
---
why would i be arsed to look up the lore i'm not interested in for more than one article and one season where nothing is explained? i cared for dbd lore, the one i like and prefer to not be changed for just a chapter.
---
Well, if The Clown is in the match, yes.  More like The Entity really really likes horror movies.
---
oh you sweet innocent child, Rank reset can make new players quit, the number of bugs is a high number, nurse &amp; spirit vs the cannibal, people aren‚Äôt punished enough for dc-ing, camping, tunnelling, toxic survivors &amp; killers, swf is really good imo (which is unbalanced because it‚Äôll make the game much harder for the killer) hag vs coldwind, infinite loops, all the scummy and toxic builds that make it a nightmare for the other team etc.
---
i could go on all day but i doubt you would even listen, so i‚Äôm gonna stop
---
Is this confirmed?
---
^(mettle of man flashes)
---
It feeds off emotion.
---
Everything that grants bloodpoints is emotion.
---
Yeah now the perk is uterlly useless
---
We shouldn't waste time FINDING and cleaning the totems just to counter a shitty wheelchair perk that the killer may or may not have.
---
Three pink and a purple I think. Not to mention the fact that throughout the stream he kept finding multiple keys per match. Plunderer‚Äôs is pretty much a guaranteed key
---
That would mean medkits never die out and toolboxes give a permanent bonus to gen speeds for the entire game. Not to mention green key addons giving you aura perks for as long as you want.
---
Devs already stated this will never happen
---
Yes it's gamescom
---
Idk, there was its own charm in man vs man thing (and thus my favourite killers are the most human ones) and Im pretty sure killer's emotions would count too. I struggle to imagine the fight for contol of this creature between dbd entitty and the show's entity. But duh, gotta wait for ptb to look at.
---
Not at all, my friend plays it, she kept annoying me every day until I bought the game, haha. Now I have tremendous fun, she has a group of friends so we're just messing around in a group of 5 and they're teaching me the basics so I can rank up as well. :D
---
Thank you for the conversation. I hope BHVR manages to pull off this chapter so that they have room to make similar moves in the future. Hopefully something about it changes your mind, but if not then that's perfectly okay too. I just want you to continue enjoying the game. Goodluck in any future trials!
---
Maybe but all I'm excited for is demogorgon
---
So if Call if Duty called itself a simulator and if Battlefield called itself a role playing game, you'd just go with it no questions asked? Sorry, I seperate marketing bullshit from the actual game. Steam doesn't have a slasher tag and BHVR doesn't want to paint themselves into a corner with it.
---
I think? No, I see and explain why I have my opinion and you've thus far disregarded every point to throw up logical fallacies. Tell me why my points are invalid and aren't actually indicitive of the slasher subgenre. Don't just move on and attack what you feel like. Address my points or stop replying.
---
Well you can't bitch about the lore if you haven't even properly researched it. 
---
Guess what, if you know fuck all about the lore, then you don't know if it fits as not do you so quit moaning about stuff you know nothing about.
---
You thick fucking bitch.
---
Isn't this the wrong way to use this format? The drunk dude is meant to be saying something stupid or crazy
---
Deathgarden
---
Then you face iron will Jake and have to play 7th dimensional chess to guess/mind game your way to actually hitting them. I main spirit now and this memes fairly accurate I‚Äôd argue the hardest part of learning spirit is learning how to properly apply pressure and when to fake phase to mind game. She‚Äôs definitely slightly harder to use than Hillbilly at least IMO.
---
Me too broski
---
Even pig requires more skill than spirit. Spirit is easy af, your ears plays for you pretty much.
---
Devs have literally stated totems are an objective. If anything expect more future perks that force you to cleanse
---
It was actually Shirtless David lol
---
Thank you guys for the name drops! I'll be sure to add you guys after work!!
---
Devs said they won't because the (director I think or the guy who played him) is a rapist.
---
Aw man
---
I dont know what are you guys mad about - the killer has clearly made a poor play and the survivor capitalized on that, the tbag is just a normal emote at this point and survivor doing that gains little to no distance instead of running away 
---
Jane is the loudest survivor of them all when hurt so the trapper can easily follow her
---
Relax and realize its only a game, taunting is a psychological mindgame after all in real life sports too, if you can't deal with it, dont go do competetive activities
---
Sincerely 
---
A killer makn
---
i think this was assassins creed 3. good game
---
did they give a consent though? did they know you're taking this picture and asked them if they're fine with it?
---
looking at these pictures, if i were caught on something like that, i'd really prefer my face blurred out cause that's just nasty what you provided there.
---
Now I have seen everything. It‚Äôs a circus simulator with a gore fetish.
---
ONLY FLASHLIGHT WHEN THE KILLER CAN'T LOOK AWAY, SUCH AS WHEN BREAKING A PALLET, OR VAULTING A WINDOW.  IF YOU ARE TRYING TO BLIND US WHILE WE CAN MOVE OUR GAZE AROUND, WE JUST WILL LOOK AWAY, THEN HIT YOU.

ONCE YOU GET USED TO THAT TIMING, YOU CAN TRY FOR BLINDS IN THE OPEN.
---

The problem is how you view it, and the fact that you take that anger on someone else.
---
Oh dang. Well we can hope and pray. I still would love to see him in game
---
Have you met *Iron Will*
---
I disagree, it‚Äôs not necessarily the strongest, but it still can be useful, especially among solo que players who can‚Äôt rely on their team. It‚Äôs easy to counter for killers if they choose to not tunnel, but that generally doesn‚Äôt always happen. It‚Äôs still a better perk than the 50% of ultra shitty ones.
---
Monto, brightening up your day just a little bit.
---
Noed is completely unnecesarry, i find stridor to be much better since it negates iron will 3
---
I snorted when he told Jason to go away. So perfect for this sub holyshit.

And someone breakes a Haunted Grounds, just to add the exposed

So we back in the mine

Yeah like "Nerf NOED"

They just need a visual indicator showing that they're losing emblem points to let them know "camping bad"/
---
&gt;You thick fucking bitch. 
---
i laughed, thank you:3 
---
well i can moan about anything. and you should appreciate too cause i bet its only moaning you'll hear in your life from an actual fukin female that is not in porn.
---
that name LOL
---
Cool! It's a game that's best played with friends imo :)
---
Side to side
---
I had an entire team DC on me yesterday because I had 2 on the hook, one downed, and then as soon as I downed and picked up the 4th person they all DC at once.
---
Then one of them messages me and says something to the effect of " Haha 0 kills for you sweaty tryhard you lose." 
---
It was pretty annoying because I only got a safety pip but I just messaged him back "yeah and 35k blood points how many did you get?" Then blocked him lol 
---
I just don't understand how you can be so toxic. An entire team willing to lose 2 pips and sacrifice all their BP that match (it's not like the game ended really quick I think they had like 3 or 4 gens done and many had been hooked multiple times) just to try and punish me for what? Winning? And the effect was minimal anyway. I missed out on a couple thousand BP for the hooks/kills I would've got, and missed my 1-2 pips I earned. And to them that was worth all 4 of them sacrificing the entire match.
---
I ESCAPED THROUGH THE HATCH AND AT THE END I HAD THE KILLER BEING SALTY SAYING I DID NOT RESCUE MY MATES BUT I ALSO HAD ONE OF THE OTHER SURVIVORS COMPLAINING THAT I FARMED THE OTHER SURVIVORS RATHER THAN WORKING ON GENS. LITERALLY I CANNOT WIN.
---
Si-side to side
---
Got it
---
I‚Äôm so wanna be in Germany right now!
---
yesterday after a few weeks of not playing DBD i thought aight lets play again (i play dbd with a friend , and since we currently don't have any other game i thought why not) , so i bring a GREEN key with NO addons with me and the killer in the After lobby just says something like : "Nice Premate's and key."  all i wrote was Jebaited i think then he noticed it was a green key xD
---
This task a grueling one
---
As I said, I'm really enjoying it. I'm enjoying the solo play as well but with friends I don't get flamed for being bad. :D
---
Also I love your huntress cosplay! So lovely
---
Ohhhhh I forgot about that!
---
ConSUME
---
I didnt specify so its not your fault
---
I don't need a consent if it's on a public event
---
Indeed
---
I'm gay so hopefully haha
---
So nah, I know most guys give you a pass for saying stupid shit with nothing to back it up,but not me. 
---
So have another laugh on me, you stupid fuckin thick bitch.
---
That's hot
---
She‚Äôs The Huntress so like 7ft obv /s
---
Maybe just different tinted skin
---
I am using pc ,but thank you ,I guess I just have to wait until the next time or spend some money for big boy
---
Clearly you should‚Äôve hooked the fourth survivor before ever even attacking the Jane again /s
---
It's not hard, that's why it's pointless. Should just be changed.
---
What? They would still hit 0% but instead of vanishing from your hand you'd be able to escape with it and have it refill just like if it had any other percentage left.
---
1st things first, if you want me to actually make you feel stupid I can give you my YouTube name so you can see me at red ranks loop a Billy for 5 gens...so you calling me a noob complaining or whatever you were going on about is irrelevant. Rank reset just happened so when I get face camped for playing well, It takes me a bit longer to hit red rank then if I was in a party with swf telling all my buddies to do gens or it's safe to come unhook. I realize a majority of you are small children so I'm trying to cut back on just shitting all over you. But if my point needs even more evidence, in said 5 gen billy loop at RANK 1, I GET FACECAMPED! AT RED RANK! So go ahead and say, "Well gates were powered, so what's he supposed to do just let you go"? Being a salty face camping bitch is the same with 2 gens to go or all gens done.
---
&gt;, I was waiting for people to leave so I could get the extra points,
---
That's literally selfish. That's the point. Going for "more" at a cost is a selfish action. You wasted time in hopes of getting more. Your selfishness costed you. 
---
It's a simple concept. Learning to reflect is important for growth.
---
10/10 meme
---
Who cares about piping? When you are the killer the only thing piping does to you is making the game harder and harder, and possibly less fun. At least with surv you are getting better team mates.
---
False, theres always that 1 percent that keeps you from getting the iridescent emblem
---
Well, I didn't realized that you were going to go apeshit
---
We hold this game together
---
If its myers or ghost face thats explainable.
---
Key bindings won't make you play better lol
---
I moved hook struggle to F for ultimate respect and I think I didn't change anything else
---
Honestly, I can't play without spine chill. I have such shitty sight I miss the killer until they're humping my back, so it's a godsend.

I Guess It is , however its not like Killers cant taunt or bm survivors and i dont see them complaining about nodding or tbagging as much as killers
---
I mean, there is going to be perks that are just not good enough to consider once you get to the point where DbD is currently. Some less powerful, but still decent enough perks to pad out the perk lists is a good thing for new Survivors. Perks like Deja Vu, Premonition, Dark Sense, etc. They are good for new players who might not have experience playing the game, and they might help them get more comfortable while playing.
---
As they get more experienced, they'll find that they don't need these new player perks, and at that point they just become "filler bad perks." No one at higher ranks is going to be running those perks unless they're memeing. Not every perk can be designed to be a top tier meta perk, and designing for only the top however much % of players is not good game design in a multiplayer only game with a learning curve like DbD.

Some people need to realize that they should look before they speak.
---
theoretically they've been tweaking the skeleton. I believe Clown and Spirit function completely differently from the base skeleton due to Clown's size and how Spirit is all contorted and phases.
---
Demogorgon will most likely still break pallets similarly to anyone else and carry survivors/hook them like any other killer by carrying them over his shoulder. I believe that is the biggest reason why killers are still restricted to a humanoid is simply the base mechanics of the game. To have a killer that's like a beast, or is super small(Chucky for example, a commonly requested killer) you would need to reinvent the base mechanics of the game to accomodate for said killer.
---
Everyone still uses the basic skeleton of a model that can interact with pallets, vaults, hooks, and downed survivors all largely in similar ways.
---
Then you see the skull on the left

That's what I was thinking. Probably some accessories too, like upside down tendrils and what-not.

Not, it's a good mechanic. If you don't watch out it's gone and that's good. If you really want to keep it just don't be a complaining cunt and fucking look at it god damn. People really can't find anything else so they take something this stupid to complain about.

ah, because you look like shit all the time, i see. okay, fair enough i guess
---
To me the ONLY reason why Negan doesn't feel like a good fit for the game is that he isn't a slasher villain killer. It would legitimately make more sense to me to bring Negan in as a survivor vs. a killer, because in the show, and especially in the comics, Negan is just a mentally fucked up guy, but he isn't a serial killer like Mike Myers, Freddy, etc.   
---
I think it could also be interesting to bring in someone villainous as a survivor too, like maybe give him a perk that rewards him for sandbagging a teammate or something. (Bill has something like this technically with 'Left Behind' so it wouldn't be that hard to imagine if you think about it)
---
I disagree because then youll see ebonys in every single game.  Need to balance it a little bit.
---
This would be awesome.  No heartbeat, just the sound of the shears snapping over and over.  Would be friggin' terrifying and amazing!

No it is: When u see the Claudette that was sitting in a bush the hole game steps in a trap ( when u did 5 gens)

Christmas lights wrapped around it

Did I stutter?

karma pal.

Ah yes how could I forget the only other two balanced and playable characters? All of the other killers are just so woefully undertuned.

Because Plague is often reduced to an m1 killer without a power (if everyone is infected and not cleansing), I like to run some combination of bamboozle/enduring/spirit fury on her in addition to ruin and M+A. It's important to shorten those chases imo.
---
A mindgame gives both players information that allows either side to predict the other. All you explained here is they either get hit, get hit or get hit.
---
im talking about the maps. maps are rng based, and some maps like the game makes u loose like 4 minutes each totm lol.
---
I've been having a really good time with: Ruin, BBQ, Save the best for last, thanatophobia. If you use that combo though, don't be afraid to hit a non-obsession twice. It will come with a downside but it will ensure that you can down your obsession quickly later when you end up needing to.
---
Imagine thinking self heal takes 32 seconds
---
Stop please no.
---
Decisive strike does that too, but again you just have to be smart and not pick up survivors you think have decisive. As a killer I‚Äôll run knockout just for this. You can slug a little bit and THAT slows down survivors. Using franklins demise, ruin, pop goes the weasel, etc. killers have means of slowing people down too, it goes both ways
---
Dart cosmetic!
---
I just prefer it, more comfortable to hold down. I initially did this due to me breaking my left arm completely and I couldnt reach control in my cast
---
The problem with noed is the fact that adrenaline exists
---
Not every killer can 4k before all gens are done, i have played 1k hours killer only and despite not using noed i still find myself struggling to slow down the gens on certain killers like wraith or clown
---
Noed is such a niche perk that rewards not being able to stop the gens being done, but at the same time adrenaline can reward a survivor that hasn't touched a gen the entire game
---
But the difference between these 2 perks is that one actually has a counterplay - noed can be cleansed by doing 5 totems which do not give an indication of being done unless its a Hex totem which you actually dont have to do since noed wont take its place
---
Adrenaline has no counterplay for the killer unless he already wins the game 
---
And just to be clear i dont want adrenaline to be nerfed, its just the fact that both killer and survivor have second chance perks when all gens are being done and that's where the balance comes in place 
---
The ammount of killers taking noed increased due to the increase of survivors running adrenaline and you can't possibly blame anyone here , i wouldnt mind a rebalance on both perks like adrenaline requires you to do 1.5 full gens to work and noed requires 4 unique survivors hooked or something
---
The balance is fragile tho
---
I saw a tru3 stream where he faced a wraith doing that. The results were impressive
---
Its definitely smart for the killer to do this
---
Daisy flower
---
I think it‚Äôs a fine perk. 99ing the gens sounds bad but when you realize that a killer with pop or overcharge can take advantage of it or even just regress them normally it gives the killer a lot of pressure options. And for people saying it‚Äôs decentivizing survs from doing the objectives, plenty of perks do stuff like that already, like devour and MYC
---
This strategy will maybe work until you hit rank 8.
---
It will also make it so you‚Äôre trash at ending chases
---
"I think we've done a pretty good job so far"
---
It‚Äôs a hit and miss, on good killers, they will simply wait 60 seconds hitting altruistic survivors.
---
i think they realized that everyone hates playing against legion 
---
even though legion is the only killer i can even play at a mediocre level. send help tbh
---
I'd like to introduce my friend Stridor to the table
---
What tab do I go to to check this?
---
Teabagging demogorgon is funny but what about a humping one
---
the chad herman would never associate with the incel clown
---
Freddy.
---
When you blink unless you have high sensitivity predict where there going to go and swing in that direction because you won‚Äôt have time to turn otherwise
---
Fort bad mine good
---
only if the increase her to 110% ms
---
U could use teamviewer to acess from ur mobile.But u need someone to accept it there.
---
when in doubt, pinky out
---
there's one totem in each corner. each tile has exactly one totem spot. the last totem is either near a wall or near the center of the map. you basicly don't even have to look for them. you start the game knowing where they all are
---
That's not what we agreed on! The only thing I'll be laughing at is your idea that nurse, spirit, and billy, aren't the only viable killers. Play killer more often. It will provide more information so that you may form a slightly less silly sounding opinion.
---
You‚Äôre a good lad
---
Blooming onion headgear, easy

Someones gotta be the sacrificial lamb for the lucky SOB who found that key

Probably your button or a glitch

*Myers running around with one of the Doctor's stolen bats, screaming "BONK" on each hit*
---
Played a game a few days ago where I down a nea. She gets unhooked and I look for who unhooked her. Nea ends up running into me so I down and hook her. Then as I hook her she gets pulled off hook immediately, I downed the teammate and her but wasn‚Äôt going to hook her. They both dced, and I got called a camper.
---
Same, retired at 1000 hours to play dark souls but good Lord y'all be making the funny punny
---
As a doctor main 3-gen is my primary strategy. I don't outright 3-gen from the start, but I do look for the best 3-gen and protect it more to ensure if it comes down to there being 1 generator remaining I'll get the 3-gen I wanted.
---
Yeah I don't get it either. I'm never really scared when I play against Billy or Freddy. Freddy never scares me really. He's the killer on which I've experimented the most.
---
It‚Äôs true. As a Dwight main, I often fantasize about the inside of lockers.
---
People should care that it‚Äôs a dick move, because you‚Äôre playing with other people and camping ruins the game for the person on the hook (assuming they didn‚Äôt deserve it).
---
Myers mind: do you wanna die scrub?
---
well i guess hes wife knows best then
---
Billy
---
I mean Lery‚Äôs is the bane of my existence but I do like the game so this could be ok
---
I have you know that clown was a absolute Chad in his prime, and he is a absolute Unit now considering his weight while being able as fast as Trapper or Ghostface
---
bro. that map is so fucked that its impossible to know where u are... now, what about the game.
---
he‚Äôs an incel and you know it 
---
you saw how he was looking at kate in his trailer
---
It is mostly uncontested that The Nurse is the strongest killer in DBD. I'm not saying that she should be nerfed, but there needs to be a change to affect the Multi-Blink Nurse, or a Nurse with 3 or more blinks. As the author of this post, I believe that a cooldown timer, or power gauge, should dictate how many current blinks she can use. Her movement speed is not the issue, it's her power.
---
because when someone is injured her power basicly reads "down this person", as she can just hear where they are and even when they run iron will, Spirits started using Stridor to hear them anyway
---
True, the individual Legion members should be physically weak, and could probably be taken down by some of our more capable survivors.
---
But you know what they have that we don't? 
---
A knife.
---
I gotcha, mask looks pretty good right now, hope you post completed version
---
A streamer guy.
---
she's too easy to play for how strong she is. see survivor. chase survivor. phase until you bump into them. get hit. survivor runs to pallet. eat pallet , stand still, react accordingly. repeat. congrats you win
---
Someone taking reddit comments seriously. How much for your buttplug, sir?  I want super anal about everything as much as you are.
---
If it's something you commit to the entire match, it's very easy to lose control and suddenly throw away the whole game. High risk, High reward 
---
In this scenario you probably aren't going to get many, if any hooks before the last gen is being focused on. The survivors are coming into it with all the resources of a fresh game and they only need to commit ~80 seconds of holding M1 to ruin your plan. 
---
Not all maps will spawn a formation that's conducive to a 3 gen strat. Sometimes it looks like it via the auras but then the terrain and such make it cumbersome to patrol. 
---
It's not an unbeatable strategy, and it's one of my favorite to use since I love wars of attrition but the odds are against you. The moment they split up and go 1-1-2 or 2-2 on the remaining gens you're screwed. 
---
The only way I'd say it becomes in your favor is if you can get a kill before there is 1 gen left. Just taking 1 survivor out of the equation dramatically slows down what they can accomplish. 
---
When it's a situation where the time it takes to pick up a survivor and hook them is the difference between keeping stable control and losing completely it's suddenly a lot closer than people imagine
---
Here are survivors options:  
---
Spirit chasing you without phasing  
---
-run
---
Spirit staying still at a pallet, potentially phasing:  
---
-call her bluff and run away, thus beating her  
---
-think shes actually phasing and come towards her, getting hit and losing the mindgame 
---
By mixing up standing still and actually phasing, survivors wont know which you're going to do. If you play her and never stay still survivors will know that and play around you not using your ability to the fullest. 
---
It's much like Game theory, in the situation where theres $100, 2 people have 2 choices, take all or split the money, if both choose to split they both get $50, if both choose steal they both get none and if they they chose opposite whoever chose steal gets all $100, while it's a guessing game in part, it also relies on knowing your opponent and assuming which they would pick, making it a mind game.
---
Nah he didn't think about wishing he had a GF he just wants them fingers for his collection because as any man he just wanted some finger lickin good food.
---
Tendrils are meant for impaling in most horror that I see, hence not being tentacles.
---
Meanwhile in Dead Space the final boss just kinda slaps Isaac with a tendril if he‚Äôs trash at dodging... tbh that‚Äôs not bad bad as that thing‚Äôs execution where Isaac fails to shoot its weak spots in time, gets brought into its mouth, ripped out losing both arms screaming in exited stock screaming sounds as the monstrosity makes chewing noises, then it pulls him back in just barely enough to rip him in half by it‚Äôs teeth as he screams in agony yet again. It tosses his lower half after.
---
But Nurse -&gt; Billy -&gt; Spirit are the only viable killers in this game?  OP even perhaps?  Dunno.  It's early, leave me alone. lol
---
If only I had a mouse with side buttons haha I'd likely set up something very similar. Like I said in my post I have m2 set up for skill checks. I seem to hit great skill checks much more often too. Least that's what it seems like
---
A few weeks ago I made some suggestions to fix all the bad survivor perks, these were the other two of Quentin's: 
---
Wake Up - Exit gates are always revealed to you instead of within a range. Anyone opening the gates is revealed to you. You are revealed to everyone when opening gates. You still open gates 5/10/15 % faster.
---
Pharmacy - The perk is based on Quentin finding adrenaline to keep everyone awake in the NOES movie, so the perk should have this ability added: when you leave an item in a chest (swap your item for it, or just open it and not take it), the chest's aura is revealed to survivors when they are within 12 meters.
---
I figured that out as nurse
---
They should and give her normal walk speed
---
&gt;Accuse someone of taking things seriously
---
&gt;Go in depth about how painful a video of people enjoying themselves is to watch
---
Choose one.
---
Probably should have stopped after you made yourself look a tit by presuming this wasn't at a convention.
---
What am i supposed to be looking at here?
---
As a spirit main, I can confirm. Just get some nice headsets and you‚Äôll be 4k-ing in no time.
---
Yeah, with the drop of Hawkins I immediately thought "yikes, rip huntress"
---
Amaizing, 10 out of 10
---
Alteenatively if you want i can arrange a kyf lobby for you and your friends against the pig
---
It's more than most killers do except maybe Nurse with her blinks and pig with her lunge
---
Well you can't keep on 69 forever!
---
Is that what causes this?  I've seen them so often in various videos but never made that connection.
---
 What kind of cooldown? Like a spirit cooldown or a clown/huntress cooldown (such as reload). 
---
If she does get a cooldown then she would need to be at regular killer movement speed. Then this would result in the same problem we encountered when nurse first came out. She would be used as an m1 killer and people would only use her ability when they are getting looped. Hence, the reason why she was nerfed.
---
Why little one? They are not kids
---
Do we need to mend after it?
---
I heard the DLC is tied to a game called Dead by daylight.
---
might be other causes but yeah, that's one of the things ive seen cause it
---
Ability: can crouch and teleport around the map
---
Perks: When survivors sabotage a hook, they suffer Hemorrhage for 30/60/90 seconds.
---
Survivor Perk: Searching chests reveals your aura to all survivors. You suffer the exposed effect when you search a chest.
---
Honestly, if I didn't have side buttons I probably would as well.  I just like having secondary actions as M2, feels more symmetrical. Ironically I have a $10 mouse from Amazon that I love more than my old Razer without side buttons.
---
I can agree that omega blink is stronger than multi blink, but the problem for me is how fast she can get back into a chase to fix her first chain blink error. Instead of increasing the fatigue time, I would implement a slight delay or downtime on her second and rest of her blinks. As a not so bad Nurse player and decent survivor, it just pisses me off a little to see a nurse teleport around nonstop without much of a delay on her blinks.
---
Probably not, I think this buff removes mending and just instadowns, kinda crazy
---
New to the game huh?
---
As long as you are nice to others throught these 1k hours, its an achievement
---
nothing? the wrong thing is having them locked behind a pay wall
---
US Eastern
---
Never used stridor, does it make enough of a difference to actually use?
---
Too weak, we already have huntress with hatchets
---
Did he survive tho?
---
Lol I know you think you're the one who is knowledgeable here, but you're not. Youre the one everyone makes fun of in this community, crying "NeRf BiLly !HeS tOo Op!" And no. Only a dumbass thinks that a survivor that's trying to win is toxic. Just like survivors that think a killer trying to win is toxic. And I'm no baby killer. Try playing against really good survivors. The fact that you say killers other than those 3 are viable say to me that you lose to them rather frequently, which means you clearly arent a very good player here, and sure as shit aren't the hotshot you seem to think you are, calling people more experienced than you baby killer.
---
Whoa watch out, someone is going to call you toxic or a cheater for wanting to coordinate with your team.
---
I barely started watching the show, but I believe the two characters are still alive in the show
---
Edit: Please no spoilers!
---
I got called a camper because after I put 1 guy in basement two more of them ran in before I even left so I downed them and put them in basement. After I used barbecue to find last survivor and I didn't even put him in basement yet after the game he was the one to call me camper.
---
Just hold the game hostage at that point since that's what the killer is doing. 
---
Don't be at the area he's protecting his gens and after 50 minutes he might finally dc out of boredom or actually start playing the game and chasing people.
---
classic incel behavior
---
Ebony Mori literally cuts your work as a killer in half. It is the most consistent OP thing in the game. I‚Äôm glad the survivor found the hatch.
---
I was agreeing with you calling him rude but then i saw your user flair
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a joke. I don‚Äôt actually do what the flair says
---
20.00 CET
---
He probably found the hatch
---
A flower with green body, yellow head (aka a Dandelion)
---
I like the idea but sadly, they'll just have to learn the same way we all did. Everyone load up kn your borrowed time
---
Chomper skin from Darkwood.
---
A flower
---
But it also changes the visuals of the map similar to pyro vision from tf2
---
I mean, last I checked Quentin didn't drag Freddy into the Fog, Ash didn't mess up the return spell (well, that one, anyway), and Myers was locked up until he was 60ish
---
I band together with the killer so i can farm. Easy levels biiiiiijh
---
If you stick around long enough in this sub, you'll see plenty of reposts (sometimes, they aren't even a month old).
---
Beat me to it but I said it anyway
---
Stridor doesn't just make it easier to soundwhore, it also completely negates Iron Will. You're no longer silent if the killer has Stridor even if you have Iron Will 3.
---
Piranha Plant*
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
Remind everyone NOT to use insidious if they a Christmas lights skin
---
It makes a huge difference. Iron will is now at 50% injured sounds instead of 0%.
---
I'm a tank 12 killer and I always get paired with rank 5 swf squads üò°
---
Only 2 hours now, the hype is unbearable.
---
If survivors get to keep their insta heals i want to keep my anal beads
---
As someone who stopped just before Legion actually released but was on the PTB, I actually think the biggest issue for me jumping back in now is that I have to unlock all four perk slots.  
---
Like, I have prestiged characters to max and I'm still having to unlock basic elements of playing a killer?  It makes it feel like I'm punished for not having a chunk of bloodpoints sitting around to just get a couple killers to level 15.
---
Obvious spoiler:
---
&gt;!They are alive!&lt;
---
Oh well then, fuck that other guy i guess.
---
That's actually a pretty cool idea. If a survivor with an item dies in the basement, then in some next game the basement item becomes that.
---
I dunno. Some haven‚Äôt though so why not toss this out? Actually, how long as the trailer been out? It‚Äôs 11:58 am for me in NJ.
---
Spirit mains torture animals irl. That's a well known fact.
---
You shouldn't even be giving these puppy beaters your precious time to argue with them.
---
When did it come out? It‚Äôs 11:59am here in NJ
---
Isn't she grabbed at the end of episode 2?
---
where they streaming twitch?
---
Ohh *shows Iron Will to the exit*
---
Doesn't work against Tier 1 Myers tho as I learn time and time again.
---
PC users in the US can also get in on this, just use the rewards points to buy Walmart gift cards, then buy Steam gift cards with the Walmart ones.
---
But how is that not survivor having to do a guessing game? You can try to make it sound fancy or like the og comment said ''7th dimensional chess''
---
The chaser emblem tells shows that you‚Äôre losing emblem points by staying too close to the hooks. Also, camping is the most efficient strategy against beginners, as it‚Äôs empowered by the survivors making mistakes. There‚Äôs no real reason not to camp if all you want to do is kill stuff.
---
3, halfway to 4 :)
---
I‚Äôve never understood DCing. I‚Äôd rather face failure with honor and get my BPs instead of losing my addons/offering and winning nothing, not to mention letting your team down. It‚Äôs a lose-lose scenario for everyone.
---
Headon is mandatory on all Steve loadouts.
---
Ask if I was being sent as a killer or survivor.
---
The entities realm is beyond time, multidimensional. There is no past present or future because it can grab people from any time or universe at any time. Super odd to think about.
---
It IS a guessing game. The whole trial is a guessing game. Where's the killer? Who's the killer? Is this totem Devour or is it Haunted? I'm not making it sound fancy. I'm saying that the guessing IS the mindgame and is why the game is even slightly competitive.
---
YouTube algorithm never told me, just kept trying to shove a perfume down my throat every fucking time I try to watch a video (yes YouTube, keep fucking irritating me with this song that‚Äôs ok once in a while but not every fucking minute, and use a shitty perfume to go along with it where you just show a guy standing there for a second before suddenly driving away near the fucking ocean... wtf does this have to do with your shitty perfume?)
---
Thank you for your contributions to this 150 iq conversation.
---
Yea I kind of figured that it was his daily, still nice of him to give us a free win
---
Maybe kinda random but your artwork is really good, I'm already followed you on Twitter&lt;3
---
Oh totally, happens a fair bit. In that case, it‚Äôs not camping. Survivors need to at least TRY not to be seen when they go for an unhook. If they run in front of the killer then it would be silly not to hit them.
---
Did you type this after or before my edit? I hope you typed it before because I already explained myself.
---
I think it came out 2 days ago
---
Hag swipes to match on Tinder.
---
What‚Äôs the stream gonna be on?
---
Nothing is more suspicious in solos or even playing with 1 random than no items and no offering. Everyone has at least a shitty brown offering to give.
---
Others say it was Monday.
---
Short answer she's overpowered
---
Long answer: Because she's overpowered and doesn't in fact require that much skill as opposed to huntress or nurse.
---
Her power is forcing survivors into a 60-40 coinflip in the favor of the killer every 7 seconds, if you don't have iron will losing this coinflip means you go down in the next 15 seconds, if you do have iron will you can coinflip some more.
---
She has the easiest time in the world camping/tunneling people off hook, again if you're injured without iron will you're braindead easy to down again. DS which is supposed to counter tunneling is also pretty much just a useless 20 sec chase-extender for this very reason.
---
The people who pl.ay her think they're good, usually justify picking overpowered characters by saying "they're the only viable killer" but they just want easymode 4Ks, think needing a perk to even stand a chance vs 1 out of 18 killers is "balanced" and just in general killermains are fucking braindead. She's so strong I'd think I have a better chance facing any other killer using ebony mori except Nurse.
---
Her prayer beads are about as overpowered as any ultra-rare addon ever was but almost every killer has these superoverpowered gamebreaking addons so it doesn't really matter.  Better nerf some more survivorperks and items though.
---
Sure, and the killer should have a perk that reveals the auras of survivors within 16 meters at all times, sounds legit.
---
those goddamn formats are so fucking lazy and overused
---
new players usually play survivor
---
Killers queues will finally get some love
---
Burgerking Myers
---
I'm sorry for my ignorance, but what is PTB?
---
I just want a damn childs play chapter
---
I've got some survivors who would just sit there from a window or a hill watching at you near the hook. Sometimes I would just stand there watching at them too lol
---
Agreed. Toxicity only breeds more toxicity.
---
I retired at 1000 hours of DS3 to play dbd.
---
Your seriously acting like that would be op in the slightest? The fact that you‚Äôd compare it to a killer perk like that is just absurd.
---
Hey! Glad you like my art. Just so you know, I don't have/use Twitter. Could you show me which account you're following?
---
Blursed?
---
You aren‚Äôt aware that killers can taunt and nod their heads and some can tbag while face camping you as a survivor and that‚Äôs completely okay. Most killer mains will tell you to grow up, it‚Äôs not toxic, and get over it or stop playing (I have posts that basically showed that) but anytime a survivor tbags it‚Äôs soooo toxic.
---
Not that big of a deal.
---
Now you have an excuse to blow the shards on high priced cosmetics.
---
It works out.
---
*Survivor bias intensifies*
---
Are you sure it's when she's phasing and not when she's just standing still? Because the devs specifically made it so you can't tell.
---
SURE GLAD I BURNED THOSE PARTY STREAMERS ONLY TO GET TUNNELED BY A HUNTRESS! SOMEONE ELSE BURNED ONE TOO! I BET IT WOULD'VE BEEN A NICE BP GAIN HAD THE KILLER NOT BEEN A TALENTLESS, CHEATING LITTLE PENCILDICK SCUMBAG! IT'S SURE GREAT THAT THE DEVELOPERS AREN'T INCOMPETENT SHITHEADS WHO IGNORE THE PROBLEMS WITH KILLERS TUNNELING AND CAMPING AND SWF GROUPS RUINING SOLO PLAYERS' GOOD TIMES! 
---
HEY, EVERYONE READY FOR THE STRANGER THINGS CHAPTER, WHERE A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW BLOOD WILL COME INTO THE GAME, PLAY ONE ROUND, GET A BUNCH OF FACEFUCKING MUPPETS AS THEIR TEAMMATES OR GET HOOK CAMPED BY SOME CUNT WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER AND IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALL THE GAME SINCE BHVR ADAMANTLY REFUSES TO OPERATE ON THE CANCERS KILLING THEIR PRODUCT?! HERE, HAVE MORE MEG COSMETICS IN PLACE OF ACTUAL CONTENT OR PROBLEM-SOLVING! DID YOU KNOW SHE LIKES TO RUN?!
---
This comment section is a shitshow lmao. ''The whole trial is a guessing game''. Just no.
---
Like Will Smith‚Äôs?
---
i played against a streamer last night who called me a tunneler, i‚Äôm a new killer and i try not to tunnel so i went and watched the VOD to see if i really tunneled. 
---
man literally put his controller down mid game while he was getting healed so when i came over he was the last to start running away therefore the closest to me by far. don‚Äôt complain about me ‚Äútunneling‚Äù if the only reason i run into you is because you literally weren‚Äôt playing the game ahaha
---
Im always maxing out my bp and only spend 100k so that i can always have a mil before a chapter releases
---
That was so crushing to watch
---
Those kind of people dont care or mean anything about what they say. They just want to get under your skin.
---
I've been trying to break the claudette stereotype by generally being a medic, I tell my friend to get on the gens, and I run botany, self care, the hook healing, and empathy, bring a med-kit with some charges and just lurk around healing people when I can
---
It's been an interesting mix up for me, especially since I'm usually the gen jockey
---
Or screenshot right after using exhaustion perks.
---
May this game last that long lol
---
when i did it i just had to search Dead by Daylight and it came up as the first result
---
this [video](https://youtu.be/JM4skqjAyEA) is pretty similar to how i did it.
---
He grind isn't too bad, the stupid amount of people who seem to Smurf and derank will be bad though.
---
Guess when you can't handle the ranks you get boosted to you have you o derank to play against new players.
---
You can easily play around pigs lunge. You can try to read nurse but as soon as she reads you it's over.

ah yes my favorite survivor Janet

I can 95% garuantee you won't be able to run it on an integrated gpu, I'd just wait for dbd on switch since you said you have one.
---
It‚Äôs on their plans to fix match making very soon
---
C O N S U M E
---
The trailer was the dev stream, I thought?
---
Literally the whole stream was the 45 second trailer and then nothing
---
Awesome! Are you thinking about getting all achievements for the game? I've been playing for a while and recently started trying to get 100 percent.
---
Is that a bug?
---
Is the killer legion?
---
#Nerf
---
Depends on your side. I always see things through Survivor-side, but if I got matchmade against a toxic genrushing SWF, I'm not giving them the satisfaction of finishing.
---
this is rly cool
---
their own killer huts maybe.
---
wait, why?
---
how is it possible?
---
i never noticed so thx for the tip
---
I don't have any dailies saved up but I do have 1mil BP plus 2k shards to get some more after I'm done with the 1mil.
---
Actually no I did not. The endgame was about halfway when I tried to escape.  Spent the remaining time falling off the edge of the map.
---
Ah you missed it guys. You could have made the same picture with that huntress chick later but ya missed her... just a little bit. But no joke I wanted to show up there too with my clown cosplay. Lucky
---
I UNHOOKED EVERYONE IN A MATCH AND DID 3 GENS ON MY OWN, I GO DOWN AND MY RANDOM SELF HEALS NEAR ME WITH SLOPPY AND THANA, I DIE ON HOOK AND SO DO MY OTHER TEAMMATES, BUT THE SELF HEALER GETS HATCH
---
y does it matter, just finish ur rituals and then get more
---
No, you have to change your country store danish and get it from the app store directly. Really easy there are tutorials on youtube.
---
Being honest
---
Noed and adrenaline are at max OK perks the way they are right now
---
But people think they deserve a win no mather what, and sometimes use excuses to why they should get it, even if it means:
---
"Lol, youre using X, youre such a toxic killer/survivor, go kys you son of a bitch. Hope you mother/daughter get raped !!!"

All of these need so much skill, am i right?  (come on, DS is just a skill check, thats not a very skillful thing, and BT lets you do unsafe hooks without caring too much about it)
---
&gt;adrenaline requires you to do 1.5 full gens to work and noed requires 4 unique survivors hooked or something
---
I would just change adrenaline so it cant pop when hooked or being carried
---
As of noed, the hook seems a good idea. But still being a totem, would make it a lot more risky to use.
---
Hook all survivors, but there no totem. Too bad
---
Theres a totem, but you hooked only 3, since the last one was in a locker the whole match while you were chasing the others. Too bad
---
But maybe this would be "fair", idk
---
Wait, which is it? Are Killers supposed to all be monsters now, compared to never, as before?
---
its a filthy swf
---
if you‚Äôve ever played killer you‚Äôll see they‚Äôll watch the survs at the campfire whilst readying themselves for a hunt
---
everyone saying look at the window but am i the only one who thinks its a door?!
---
Wraith is really fun and legit underrated in terms of powerlevel but sadly he only has one add on slot :(
---
(because you need windstorm to make him viable against any team that knows what they're doing)
---
Ahh, smart!
---
Next survivor confirmed Tony Hawk.
---
That's a super good nea cosplay
---
yeah just ignore people like that. there are many dumb ppl around, that have problems with seeing reality. i had survivors that were flashlight clicking, fast vault spamming for the noise notification and chasing me all game long. sometimes those ppl flamed me, for tunnelling. like... really? literally everything they did was trying to taunt me and when i gave them the attention they wanted, they suddenly whine.
---
Funny meme and I hope his Mori is eating someone that would be cool
---
Okay, well now my builds are about to be: BBQ&amp;C, Corrupt intervention, Sloppy Butcher, and Pop goes the weasel
---
&gt;	continue in a course of action even in the face of difficulty or with little or no prospect of success.
---
I googled it
---
You know, it'd be neat if Killers could collect what their opponents drop. Either to give to Survivors or for a "bait" option universal for Killers.
---
Could also just give baby Dweets some toxic player's UR gear.
---
*Wooooosh*
---
look at the door
---
Wouldn't be surprised if the killers eventually all know each other. Though I don't know what they would do with the demongorgon
---
i have a lot of wood for some of the survivors, too.
---
i am entity confirmed
---
Monto
---
Sounds like a gru-some match
---
or how everyone says window
---
Most of the perks dont require skill to use, that wasnt my point
---
My point is that adrenaline is so closely related to noed that nerfing one without the other will result in a adrenalinepocalypse where everyone would run IT because it would have no counterplay
---
If you desperately want changes - sure include them
---
But do it in a well thought, smart way
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt even that strong tbh. Also while I don‚Äôt think those killers need any major nerfs or buffs, they could definitely use some fine tuning, especially on addons, billy with insta saw, iri head combat belt huntress, or prayer bead spirit all are kind of overturned or could use some kind of change to make it strong but not completely soul crushing for survivors.
---
Well you got me there, Robot Jones.
---
isn't on the right
---
Just a little bit
---
I think Negan would be a good fit for a Killer on paper, but his motivations as someone who commits murder is different from the usual Killers. Most of them are psychotic, or believe what they're doing is just. Negan, on the other hand, typically only kills in retribution for what he views as someone committing a wrong against him or his people. When we see Negan in TWD, the only time he ever kills people is when he feels he's justified in doing so. Negan never really came off to me as someone who wholly enjoyed killing people, but more that he enjoyed the vengeance aspect to it.
---
On the other hand, the Killers in DBD generally have a good reason to want to kill, or simply enjoy killing.
---
Still, if they can put Negan in fuckin' Tekken of all things, they can probably put him in DBD too.
---
The perfect thread.
---
Yeaaaah, I actually just started playing for the first time the other day and it‚Äôs... pretty rough at times. I don‚Äôt mind the grind in *theory*, and part of me also likes how chaotic the range of killers is. Keeps me damn paranoid.
---
...But also, my two-skill-slot, no-swf self keeps getting dunked into games where everyone has maxed perks.
---
I‚Äôve read guides and tried to memorise basic strats/killer behaviour/important perks, and I‚Äôm definitely getting better at juking people, but it‚Äôs so hard to learn when not recognising a mechanic gets you Hooked in thirty seconds flat. (And it makes me feel bad for my teammates, too.)
---
Not at the moment. Currently trying to get every perk on every killer, so far got doctor, michael, mostly freddy. Then every perk on my baby dwight. Already got all the teachables in the game. Michael/Nurse is my favorite killer though.
---
No. They will be slightly toxic and may ragequit at first, but will soon learn to adapt and become better. That‚Äôs how it works.
---
He is gonna nerf the devs.

Don‚Äôt worry. When I mean ‚Äúbutcher‚Äù, I mean ‚Äúbest fair and square‚Äù.
---
It is VERY map and killer dependent. If you are playing a killer with no instadown or in a map where the gens are close to safe strucktures like haddonfield or asylum, you can basically prolong the game to last like half an hour but in the end the survivors will just run off after a hit, heal and return to gens.
---
It is not all that great of a strat if you wanna win consistently and holy fuck is it boring for everyone involved
---

---
Do it. I‚Äôll bring Leatherface.

---
"Why is that christmas tree growling at me?"
---
I feel like this is what happens when people ignore the lore. Your job is to feed the entity with despair and hope. If you‚Äôre too damn efficient at what you do then it‚Äôs just over and you didn‚Äôt do your job. If you‚Äôre going against stupid baby survivors just slug them a bit and tease them with more chases
---
It‚Äôs nothing new.. tbagging has been around forever and is not exclusive to DbD, so idk why people get so offended over it. It doesn‚Äôt change the outcome of the game so whatever. If you can‚Äôt handle immature jerks tbagging then maybe find another game. Not promoting tbagging, but it is astonishing how offended people are over someone else rapidly crouching. Bring on the downvotes
---
Otz is super chill too, always nice to other players even if they're salty
---
12 perks? 1 new killer and 2 new survivors makes 9 perks no?
---
Oh is it no one escapes death
---
Yeah, that might just be the only exception for DCing. Toxic people don‚Äôt deserve rewards, even if they played well.
---
depends if it's the survivors doing shit or you being extremely active and good
---
* listens to PLAGUE by Crystal Castles *
---
I tbagged the man because he facecamped my buddy. He was toxic so I returned with my own toxicity. Quit crying on my post and find something else to do.

Why is it so useful

Ouch... a bit too hard there pally. But dont worry, atleast WE still love ya
---
I just finished P3ing every killer besides Ghostface(I have 14 event cakes, 7 survivor puddings and 8 BPS) but the only one I have all the perks on are Myers and Billy...but I've also spent a decent amount of points on survivor so who knows how complete killers I could've had... I think my favorite Killer is probably Huntress and Myers.
---
I'll give him the Silver for you then :P
---
Even if he turns out to be middle tier, there will be people calling it too OP or too Weak just by looking at it.
---
I cant wait to have fun reading theses :)
---
They don't do that anymore. They release the killer in a mediocre state and that's it.
---
Isn‚Äôt this a repost from like 11 months ago? I still have it saved on my phone from then
---

---
Because she has "mind games" that basically amounts to "I win because you didnt guess right" and the totally original strategy of repeatedly baiting the unhook and phasing back to tunnel the recused. Other killers have to work for their mindgames, she doesnt. 
---
In a vaccuum shes fine with the exception of prayer beads and phasing collison. The problem is she attracts a bunch of lazy, sweaty killer players that just want to win with as little effort as possible.
---
I personally don't think I like the sound of that as a killer, it seems a bit gimmicky for me
---
I mean, as someone who's pretty non toxic, he's not strong.
---
Giving you gold in spirit.
---
Cool that you met monto, but i must say your cosplay looks really great as well! Good job on that :)

cuz he already has 1Mil BP(i assume)
---
I dont get your point but I laughed at the comment. Upvote.
---
I'm done with you. Feel free to keep talking to yourself tho.
---
Probably already has max BP saved up. Spend the BP already saved up, and then claim the dailies for more BP.
---
...
---
Brb gonna block ya for being a rude fellow
---
Huntress
---
fellow comrades, *we* need more shirtless characters.
---
Tier I Myers is immune to every detection perk I think, it's how they balance out his slow speed at that tier. He's slow as shit but you can't find him unless you hear his footsteps or it's too late. That's why people run Monitor on him, he has a 8 meter terror radius in tier I, and Level III Monitor reduces your terror radius by 8 feet outside a chase.
---
They go on reddit Kappa
---
they meet in the basement ;)
---
Lmao btfo of your own thread after getting exposed as an ez baby killer. 
---
What a pathetic meme.
---
Spirit
---
I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs a point where if I‚Äôve chased them long enough without breaking off, I eventually start just throwing the game to an extent to catch them out of spite. I don‚Äôt face camp though, cuz at that point they outplayed me so hard and I don‚Äôt deserve the kill. Plus face camping is boring
---
Fails skill check.
---
Laurie explodes.
---
1. I'm kind of recent ( a bit before the drop of the Stranger Things, but I would say the best to level initially is definitely some of the base characters, they offer the widest array of stuff that can generally be extremely useful for most parts of the game. To start off, probably Meg Thomas, she's built around running and survivng. In terms of Killer, Hag ( Ruin and Devour ), Bubba ( BBQ and Chili which is really good for farming currency ), and imo Doctor ( doctor is best man ) 
---
2. The community is extremely entitled, and belives that the other group of players shouldn't use the most optimal strategy, but should instead use the strategy that makes it easier for them
---
3. Tunneling is tricky, but it boils down to when playing a killer you focus down a survivor against ALL costs, this can even throw the game in most cases and is generally a bad idea. Slugging is when a killer doesn't hook the survivors but instead lets them crawl around like slugs, also generally a bad idea unless there are two survivors and one person can find the hatch and escape ( the hatch doesn't open until one person is left alive, so if someone gets hooked they will usually kill themselves to allow the other to escape ) 
---
4. No, and ***never let anyone tell you otherwise*** welcome to the community and I hope you enjoy your stay in the fog!
---
5. I'm not entirely sure, but I would say that ST being brought to a game like DBD is amazing for terms of bringing in more players
---
6. Noob3 I find to be very funny, and Pain relievers does a wonderful job for tutorial style videos
---
7. Doctor 100% to avoid overloading you with info, he was once a super intelligent doctor and now hes insane and shocks people which causes some pretty nasty inflictions on them. For survivor I'll probably be playing Bill for the time being because he's a badass, but in terms of survivors it depends on who you like to look at for the most part. Their perks start off unique to them, but as you progress and level them you can eventually unlock the unique perks for everyone to be able to find and level
---
8. It's perfectly fine, again ***never*** let anyone tell you how you want to play, I love playing killer, but play survivor a lot with my buddy
---
9. Hardest comes down to personal play, for killers I would say hardest to acheive a fair game with is Leather face, he doesn't have much going for him aside from his chainsaw being able to hit multiple people ( and most will stay far away from him if they hear it ). In terms of actual power, I would say the hardest is Trapper, or maybe Legion because of getting used to playing entirely around their power. Legion is also not enjoyed by the community, but I think a good legion player with add-ons is extremely terrifying
---
10. SO far the devs look to be pretty chill guys, if you have any more questions I'll do my best to answer them, but until then, stay safe in the fog
---
I admittedly don't typically use headphones when playing spirit but i recently brought a headset and oh man Spirit when you rely heavily on sound is broken.
---
I will definetly try.
---
Be an interesting mix up for normal moris, that'd be cool environmental executions, every killer uses the pallet shards differently to kill after breaking it either on their head or beforehand (whichever is more fair I guess)
---
Myers cuz he has a power that can actually help get downs but isn't something insane like nurse or spirit
---
You still 22k blood points.  The thing is, killers only care about 4k'ing, when you get more BP for playing a piss poor match than a survivor playing his best.
---
That being said, yes the ranking system sucks, but you didn't get destroyed, you hooked, and chased at a decent level. You gained good BP. Winning isn't about 4k'ing all the time. You  rank up by pip.
---
Oh yeah i forgot the double standards
---
I mean yes but no
---
I have everything I want. I rather have as much BP for the new killer so I can maybe get somewhat decent perks for my first games.
---
I always run idk. I very rarely walk or crouch. Like I‚Äôm much more likely to avoid the killer by running and getting around the map quickly than by crouching around. Also didn‚Äôt mean no offense by the comment haha
---
I guess
---
Why would I search for something I didn‚Äôt know exists and didnt think exist? First thing I did today was open YouTube, saw the trailer, instantly posted on DBD without seeing ANY OTHER POSTS ABOUF IT AT THE TIME.
---
Billy. I used to think that that was Huntress, but the only balanced aspect of Huntress is that half the maps fuck her over.
---
I mean it's a bit of a crutch perk, I don't run it but you might enjoy using it.
---
Legion should've been the pile of diapers. If you unmask legion in something like blender its literally a human without any kind of decay
---
that actually sounds like an improvement
---
They said they're streaming at 2pm ET or in around 1 hour
---
I HAD THE SAME HAPPEN TO ME TRYING TO LEARN NURSE, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I DC'D IN MY LIFE.
---
Clown or wraith
---
Good survivors wont let a killer get a 3 gen. Period. Its basic fundamentals. 
---
If the killer gets a particularly strong 3 gen set up, its not too difficult for the survivors to hard focus one of those gens early. Its fairly easy as SWF, but another example of how potato solos can tank the match for their whole team.
---
Do the tutorial, that really helped me out. Just to let you know, when you start real games, players are really toxic. Just push through and you‚Äôll do fine!
---
Edit: OP, if you want more help, just send me a message.
---
What the actual fuck just happened?
---
I dont really need BPs for any of my main killers atm so I rather wait for the new killer.
---
It is a door! People assumed it was a window and stuck with it I guess.
---
The only thing that keeps me playing is that they always are coming out with new killers and survivors but I do hope if they add dedicated servers that it will improve the overall health of the game on ps4
---
Yeah I play pig and I‚Äôve also played spirit and she‚Äôs hard af, too much big-braining you gotta do
---
Spirit is so much fun to play once you learn her.
---
Wow! nice one.
---
No offense but I don't think he facecamped, survivors think someone is camping even if he is not, if iam wrong than sry
---
https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight in 1 hour.
---
In about an hour I believe?
---
You happy now?
---
When you take a mori for a daily, but you encounter a double OoO group, and you just lost a pig/wraith game to the same combination. Glad I had no green mories.
---
That was actually sick
---
yeah, an asshole
---
If he sits directly in your face while you‚Äôre hooked what would u call it a kiss?
---
One time i couldnt mend vs a legion and i bled out and got sacrificed.
---
Yeah she got grabbed but that's all I know, she may be alive (or not apparently).
---
For the longest time I thought monto was a high functioning autistic gamer because of the way he screeches and the motions he does when he plays lol. That guy's skill is the real deal. I wish I was half as good as him because then I'd be 100 times better at the game lol
---
Fallout 76 would rather dump $10-$20 cosmetics in us rather fix their game also. At least it felt that way till the last patch. Hopefully BHVR gets these ironed out also.
---
PS4
---
As someone who has been dumping points into survivors trying to get all of them to 40, it was kinda nice to get this perk. Its helpful to have playing catchup. Grinding all the perks takes a looooong time if you havent been doing it the entire time
---
They ended up farming after feeling bad for me. If they all get out Id probably have full 8k in deviousness and chase and little to no bp in brutality and sacrifice. And you do win by killing all 4 survivors. It's literally the killers Job. Pipping isnt winning
---
Even if you didnt saw the video when it came out, theres a huge amount of posts talking about it already.
---
If someone just scroll a little on this sub they'll find this information
---
yeah, thank god its here
---
I mean dedicated servers for pc have been out for almost a year I think maybe a year. And console still doesn't have them yet.
---
It‚Äôs non canon to their respective show and only canon to DBD. 
---
Laurie, Quentin and Ash were also all still alive when they got added as well.
---
Do you really think I don't play spirit? 
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/lighted-v/screenshot/12840407
---
Im gonna repeat: EASY AS FUCK
---
Ive got 115. I know basic loops and mindgames for killer but they had around 500+ each
---
Everyone hating on you is acting like their idealized version of a game that boils down to a skinned version of hide and seek is somehow morally superior to your fleeting ideas for what could be cool.
---
Big braining? Just use your ears bro.
---
Should be a couple more weeks lol
---
Repeat *** and you can literally hit rank 1 survivor or killer easily ... it‚Äôs not a challenging feat
---
Yeah, sure... But can you do a kickflip?
---
No. 
---
This is a party game. The overly sweaty players are what ruins it.
---
It is better for the game! I just wanted to spend my ire shards on something lol
---
If survivors actually do something impressive then its kind of understandable, but all they did was stun him. Theres no need to tbag because you played the game the way its supposed to be played
---
Devs said that 4 months ago lmao
---
I assume it will be like Lery's where there's a small outside area where the Exit Gates are located.
---
Aye, ty, is there a premier or smthn
---
Yeah but it fucks you up when you‚Äôre phasing. Survivors sound much closer than they actually are
---
"Soon"
---
Typo, I fixed even before your comment, smartass. Point proven. Spirit = Wheelchair for braindead killers. Thank you.
---
THANK YOU! I ALREADY CALLED THEM AND THEIR ANSWER WAS BASICALLY: 'WE DON‚ÄôT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THIS, JUST WAIT‚Äô. I‚ÄôLL GRADUATE NEXT MONTH, ALTHOUGH I‚ÄôM WORRIED IT‚ÄôS GONNA BE TOO LATE TO SIGN UP FOR MASTERS RECRUITMENT AND I‚ÄôLL BE FORCED TO TAKE A YEAR OFF.

I'd make spirit not hear shit when she's using her power tho
---
Killer = easy for anybody with a set of headphones really
---
Same here, gave up rolling for shitty attempts at 360s.
---
Yes hes hot and she even hotter and there are so perfect together
---
Bloodpoints that you can get EASILY looping the killer. Congrats.

---
I'm US central time zone. psn: amoresaur
---
Weakest killers = balanced?
---
Except, this map is specifically underground
---
Ty so much
---
I mean spirit is easier to play if you got good hearing but even then you kinda have to do Mind games and all that stuff
---
Spend them on cool cosmetics, or in my case, bloodpoints through buying teachables I already own
---
Spirit 100% super viable killer and super viable perks.

Love the new cosmetic, but not sure I can justify buying something I can't see except for a few moments at the start and end of each trial. Hopefully I run in to some Nurses running the new outfit!

Lmao I was until I accidently hit a instead of b and claimed them all XD
---
Not if you are used to it
---
Spirit and Freddy. They both allow you some breathing room against survivors and the mind games are in their favor but still can be worked around.
---
It's 4v1, mindgames should ALWAYS be in the killers favor.
---
Walking Dead is trash and if they did anyone it would have to be Clementine as a survivor.

---
Telling people to stfu because they like something you don't like - good
---
Telling people to stfu in endgame chat because they beat you in a game - bad.
---
Reddit is just full of hypocrites today isn't it?
---
Yes, good and bad though. It doesn't negate Iron Will on every map for every survivor. Kate on Lery's for example will still be silent unless you are basically colliding. Stridor makes the Autohaven maps and the corn rows all sorts of fucky. Bill's normal audio will echo really badly with Stridor on Autohaven. Sounds bounce off the corn with Stridor. It's a net positive though. I consider it necessary for red rank Spirit play because most SWF are anti-Spirit death squads at that rank.
---
Tooooo young

Rewatched bill‚Äôs trailer. He‚Äôs down for the count before the Fog got to him. That twitching in the trailer was just him going from his corpse in reality to the Fog.

Still holding out for another member of the legion to appear. Wraith would probably think some random survivor wandered in the killer meeting again. ((Probably Susie out of all of them. Joey he would probably believe as a killer based on his mask and probably would just think Julie is frank as a girl.)
---
welp good thing youre not in our friend group... were not to toxic at all towards random killers but holy fuck we will let you know you suck if it's just friends...

I fail to see the issue.  Plenty of actual horror games have kids

It all depends on your play style. Do you prefer to be stealthy, avoid chases and do gens? Do you prefer to get the killers attention? Maybe you‚Äôre more of the altruistic type?

There are perks that help all of these play styles, depending on what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish.

Theres nothing karma whore-y about it. Someone is posting about people they met from our community. Not only did you come in and insult them but you also went out of your way to try and get them in trouble, which from what I can see backfired on you lol.

---
Thanks for the reccomendation dude
---
I'm not mad, I think fortnite dances are hilarious.
---
When the fuck did I say I was the pro? Can you even read, mate? Actually you proved my point, lol. Even a "level 84" can get rank 1 using Spirit.
---
Also, that screenshot was a while ago. I returned to play not even 2 months ago. I even have screenshots of when I played back then, lol 
---
Try again.
---
You really don't until you've played both. 
---
I play better as survivor after I have played as killer since I know how their powers and add-ons work. I'm also a better killer because I play as survivor and know how they think and where they hide. 
---
And I definitely understand why killers run meta perks like Ruin (some killers have  naturally bad gen defense without ruin) and NOED (it's great for countering bodyblocking, Adrenaline and  teabagging survivors at the gate) or BBQ (the double blood points is worth it even if it didn't have aura reading)
---
Lunge OP lol
---
Dedicated servers haven't been on pc other than a ptb so as soon as you guys get dedicated servers so will we
---
I didn't recommend the perk, I just answered your question, but enjoy.
---
Fortnite good, Minecraft good
---
Micheal in the back lol
---
You are be able to open gates with every killer.
---
If you close the hatch first though, you cant
---
And who said that the rank has anything to do with the skill?
---
Yes sir
---
Clown does for sure
---
This isn't the government, you have no rights here. If you can't prove to be a useful respectful part of the community you get removed like a diseased body part.
---
Amazing trickshot. Definitely going into the montage.
---
Iam just saying that most of survivors are not telling the truth that's all
---
&gt;I had good intentions with this post and get treated like trash for it
---
People are kinda fed up with posts about it
---
Some used the hype of the new chapter just to farm some karma and kept spaming about it
---
This doesnt excuse people treating someone loke trash though, but since its DbD sub, its expected that it'll happen

&gt;should I respond with the same treatment to others on this subreddit? 
---
Going down the level of these people will do no good for you, or any other person. Just ignore and move on, they get what they deserve one way or another in their lives
---
&gt;I certainly didn‚Äôt see anything when I was posting it, so I guess I was just unlucky
---
Probably. But if you want to avoid something like this, just look a little on the sub and do some research.
---
Otherwise, you're free to post whatever you want, as long it doesnt break any rules
---
What we REALLY want.
---
Good concept, but those are the worst perk ideas I have ever seen
---
Playful trash talk to some extent sure, but when you're dropping N-bombs and going on racial tirades and just being a shitstain there's no reason for you to exist in the community. People work to put this place together, and nobody is entitled to stick around.
---
Hmm. I didnt know that. Intentional or?

I don‚Äôt get it

I really enjoyed dark wood,  havent been able to play it dor awhile since I no longer have a PC.
---
Idrc lol. Enjoy the clip or just get out if y‚Äôall have nothing nice to say. Why waste the time. I tbagged and I had my reason for doing so.
---
The entity has an minimum age limit and nancy and stever are of the minimum age
---
With the Stranger Things chapter.
---
It came with the EndGame update
---
It‚Äôs just a cough
---
The results:
---
Anyone with a brain because it's a ranked system and actually takes a bit of skill to get to red ranks as killer (Since you can't party with low ranks to boost you and don't get a pip while losing, and you'll obviously face stacked red ranks swf), at least of course, you are playing spirit.
---
Usually I find myself running the killer for 3 to 4 gens.  I‚Äôve gotten pretty decent at running the killer so I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm more of a ‚Äúgetting attention‚Äù player. I try to do gens and be altruistic when I can but I always end up in the jungle gyms haha
---
You god damn legend
---
This would break deliverance.
---
Are they gonna punish rage quitters when they add dedicated servers
---
Will you make it into his Vlog?
---
Same I will slug them all if they flashlight, tbag, and just all around a-holes about it. At that point wont even care about points. Im in it for the salt. I will watch them all bleed out and laugh.üòàüòàüòàüòà
---
what
---
When is the live stream ? Isn't it supposed to be today ?
---
Alternatively you don't hear injured survivors well enough to pinpoint because the game (especially chase music, generators popping, noise notifications) is far too loud to leave turned up enough to hear all survivors from 15-20 meters away.
---
I have to pass within 5\~ or so to get a clue.
---
backfired? get in trouble? nah, mate, i was just bitching. after my 10/10 migraine strike pulled off a bit, i came to see i should not have get triggered cause now i'm upset cause his face and karmawhoring is legit ugly and disgusting and next year if i see him on this event i'll laugh in his manlet face near my tall af former boxer husband. cause, you know, I'm a cunt. with or without a migraine. 
---
but you have a nice one, though, you seem chill.
---
This just made me think about that. I havent watched much of the show so I dont know what it does, but will the demogorgon hit with his hand like the hag or will it bite? Does it have any other way of fighting?
---
He wasn't vlogin at gamescom he was just havin a great time ... I guess
---
Boil over being useless as always
---
Necromorphs plz
---
This idea is actually really cool, I would love this change, giving the original survivors a tiny edge for their gameplay .
---
Oof, it is on switch now.
---
it is today that they reveal survivor/killer perks?
---
Especially since there's definately going to be a dlc. During there crowd funding they reached a goal for a dlx
---
I mean it is 1000 blood points ez ez and you have to check for NOED ya feel.
---
I've totally been there before. XD
---
It was a joke
---
You should learn to understand humour.
---
True
---
She wasn't the survivor that was unhooked.
---
I got called a tunneler for constantly running into a neon jacket Claudette when the other three wore dark clothes on Macmillan. Then, when I didn't deathhook her but instead slugged her for bait I was apparently a camper, going by the stream I watched after.
---
At least they weren't toxic in game, they just complained during the stream itself, which I don't mind.
---
Oh shit I didn't know about this
---
Wait what new chapter
---
The Terrifier would be so awesome and Jeepers Creepers would also be really dope. The vampire would be p cool but i would much rather the other 2 before him.
---
So many upvotes! I'm crying üò≠üíô
---
Definitely not harder than Billy. You literally just need a headset. Stand still at loops sometimes and you'll win. Spirit is trash and needs a nerf.
---
Exactly.
---
Yup, but it's been 2 years and all we've heard is that they're working on something.
---
That suzie is on point
---
It's ironic because this post is using a meme format to tell other people how to use their meme formats.
---
Also while not exactly toxic, it's extremely annoying to see *yet another* violation of Rule 8.
---
same man I love killer and survivor but I am survivor main just because survivor queue is max 2 min en killer is at least 10 min for me
---
Claudette, meg, dwight and the others did not die. Most of the killers didnt die either.
---
Yea it came out during the release of season 3 of stranger things
---
I‚Äôd pay some good money for this shiet
---
Too bad he‚Äôs a horrible person
---
Try being on your first hook and if everyone's not aimlessly walking in circles they're all cleansing dull totems until you reach the struggle stage and are still at it until you die.
---
Stranger things has a gigantic community, so tgis was the best decision they ever made publicitywise
---
*Proceeds to eat legion*
---
All he needs is a Mask tbh then he's just legion.
---
Best part was I was running a fail-check doctor build. So those gens weren't even going to get done.
---
He's a talker. Everything you like about his character comes from his speeches and interactions with the other characters. On Dead by Daylight he'd just be a husk
---
Yup.  I feel bad every time.
---
What?! No he isn't. He was very nice to everyone
---
I'm told higher rank killer queue is faster. All I want to do is play some pig. *Sad oink*
---
Basically every time! I've given up on doing it unless people sit under the hook and point, since I'll trust them to count their own better than I can. This is made worse since I don't ever go into matches planning to be nice, but instead start playing nice once I've slugged the whole group at once, which means a lot of people can get hooked before I switch over to farming.
---
"then nobody is human, not even survivors because they are dead"
---
I heard dcing also fucks over the opposing player whether they be killer or survivor.
---
I got it the first time, but I was trying to remember the circumstances of it the other day. Wasn't something happening at the time that the community wasn't happy about, so everyone thought BHVR was giving us BBQ in the shrine to placate us?
---
does anyone know exactly what it will do? they werent specific
---
Can someone tell me who the guy is?
---
The new map is a bathroom? That's shitty. Especially if it's a North American bathroom. The killer will be able to see you through the cracks between the stall doors.
---
A bold and original opinion.
---
I was told you can‚Äôt so many times by so many people, I have to look into it. Is there a setting you‚Äôre aware of? Not by my pc at the moment

Wraith. His lunge is his trump card in most chases,  invisibility let's him roam, and add on wise, fancy

Someone please reply so I can save this forever

YouTube guy
---
Only time I camp is when a survivor tbags on first and/or second pallet stun and I catch them after that. Very specific scenario but it's happened a few times and for some reason it always rustles my jimmies.
---
If they loop me the entire game, then that's my fault for not breaking chase so I won't camp them at all if I end up catching them.
---
If I end up chasing after an unhooked survivor, I just knock them down and leave them to be healed.
---
i feellike Q&amp;Q should be paired with head on, i really want to do that lol

Hearing injured people is bullshit tho. and don't tell me about Ironwill, because she still hears them if she runs Stridor

This game is obviously going to die in a few months and the only people playing the game will be the toxic fanboys. And these idiots will still keep wondering why the game died hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
---
He's called Art and he's from a film called Terrifier. Bad acting for the most part but solid gore.
---
lol this is so wrong on so many levels. I had so many killers/survs who suck at rank 1. It has nothing to do with skill because its pretty easy to get 2 pips. Also everyone could rank to 1, and take a screen with another killer. ‚ÄûOh yeah im such a great trapper, let me take a screen of it with rank 1 which I got by playing freddy‚Äú.
---
yes once when i was patient I did all day killer how higher I came now faster it was but then reset occurred and I had my long queues again so for me it's not worth (I dont have much time to play in that case i cant keep my rank high enough for reasonable queue times)
---
Well I guess you'll just have to watch the whole season to see.
---
I guess i just don't consider that toxic, just annoying really.
---
According to le article, the Demo will have a perk that blocks all vault locations when a gen is completed.
---
Adrenalin, ds, dead hard, and self care. With purple flashlight and boldness offering/s
---
So the usual for online games.
---
When your 4-man uses BPs and the killer slugs at 5 gens
---
I hope it gets better because it's one of the main games I play along with apex until it pisses me off and dont starve
---
I love this idea!
---
Remember kids, ACTUAL tunnelling and camping is a dick move. All it proves is that you not only have no skill at the game, but you‚Äôre such a vile person inside that you need to ruin the game for other people to feel a smidge of excitement in your miserable lonely existence. Only people with serious insecurities tunnel and camp, then insult the people when they get mad after the match. You aren‚Äôt cool, you aren‚Äôt a badass, you‚Äôre everything wrong with the community and should be ashamed. But your small man syndrome is too strong to see the error of your ways. 
---
A person is not a pussy or a baby because they‚Äôre upset that the game was ruined for them. The people who call them a pussy are the same people who swear at their mom when she stops paying for their xbox live subscription. 
---
That being said, survivors too often call something camping or tunnelling and are just salty they are trash or went against a good killer. And they are the true pussies. 
---
Thus ends my rant. Thanks for tuning in
---
Hook rescue is 1000+ BP
---
That sounds like it would work really well in game. That time spent not socialising really paid off
---
Nope, I'm on PC, blind as a bat. The perks make sure I survived at the same rate as perkless kobing
---
So something like the recycle option from Deathgarden?
---
Really should not have clicked that
---
That doesn't make it a mindgame. They either stood their and you phased and hit, they jump and you grab them or they leave the pallet and you hit them. It's literally one of the most mindless things in the game, it has no risk with a heavy reward.
---
Ok good because I hate it when an swf tries to be toxic and they get downed in 15 seconds and dc

I don't care how I look like in their eyes; those are just pixels on my screen (same for them). What I care is a most efficient way to win and rank up, I can't do 12 hooks, and fortunately, I don't need to, so I reduce this number to 8, for now, it works.

Depends on what you mean by "Free"

Free as in immediately available without any cost:  Hillbilly

Free as in you can obtain them with 9000 Shards: Spirit

No link? Thanks

That doesn't make sense either though because you will have games where players dc right away.  Should you get a 2 pip for that?  You aren't considering all cases including edge cases in your "make this change devs!"

That's cool

Read the flair nerd

.
---
Not a bad idea. I would maybe suggest this option to be available when survivors would die anyway AKA last hook. I believe this "brutalize" option would make them go back to injured state instead of still being in the dying state.
---
No
---
Why would you instantly post something without checking to see if someone else already posted it?
---
You did nothing wrong. They were already upset and would've taken anything you said negatively.
---
Personally, I find it's less likely that you'll upset people if you say a bit more, though. I say "GG, thanks for the fun match!" in every game, and people generally seem to recognize that I'm genuinely being nice. The only people who've gotten upset about it are those who end up begging me to stop being so nice so they can feel justified about being mad.

Congrats. I find Mori dailies a pain and typically use Rancor (Obsession is Moriable once all gens are done) to get them accomplished without fear of wasting a mori.
---
Im noy blaiming anyone lol, i even had a game vs a legion who gave me a madness scream.
---
A bit of the power has been leaked, all I care about now is if the flavor is good. I want some upside down visuals while teleporting and fleshy portals tearing open. And i definitely want the upside down theme playing somewhere in there.
---
And yet the game matches you against high rank players even when you are rank 20 and not in swf.....
---
I don't. That sounds horrible. I legit would not keep leveling characters if that was the case.
---
inb4 new Survivor and Killer emote
---
every game has a character thats good AND easy, she doesnt need a nerf, not every killer can be S tier, you gotta accept that. shes the best killer for casuals, and you cant exclude the biggest part of your playerbase, atleast not with giving them something easy and strong.
---
Hell. It's about damn time!
---
Yup. That's what I said the idea was based on. After playing Deathgarden, it got me thinking that DBD could learn a few things.
---
As frustrating as NOED is, I agree. It's the only tool to punish rushers when you're playing a low tier killer. More often than not I face survs that rush all 5 gens when they see I'm outplaying them in chases and most pallets are broken. NOED is the tool to punish that behaviour, and it's extremely fair.
---
Bad killer not deserving kills? Then use the extra time the pallets remaining can buy you to break the totems before powering all the gens. Good killer? Then it's not that undeserved that he's been playing all game with 3 perks (2 after Ruin is broken) and gets a kill in the endgame if he's been rushed.
---
1300hrs on surv, by the way.
---
No it doesnt, at all
---
100 percent.  But the four perk slots should be open for all characters of a given type (Killer or Survivor) as you unlock them for your account.

Shit! Thanks for the reminder bud. üëçüèº

---
Yes it is.
---
I think it's around 40-45. 
---
As for a tunnel bait - those folks are ready to die obviously, I don't think they expect a killer to let them go. When I'm playing a survivor and hit killer with pallet 2+ times I know how this will end, and I'm not salty, that's the only option for killer if they don't want to chase you for another 3 minutes).
---
I HATE THAT I CAN FIND A GAME AS SURVIVOR IN LESS THAN 30 SECONDS BUT I HAVE TO WAIT 5+ MINUTES TO PLAY KILLER!
---
You really believe that SoS is random? WAKE UP SHEEPLE
---
He‚Äôs not TERRIBLE, you‚Äôre just going to have a hard time with Survivors who know Window/Loop spots by heart.
---
He works a lot better with Enduring/Brutal Strength, since by the time 1-2 Gens are left, you have created a huge Dead-Zone that you can defend easily since there are no more pallets.
---
is this man a living meme
---
Riip
---
Tbh its just a little annoying to play against and thats about it.
---
No, it's a strategy. Your husk stays still when you phase so survivors can't know if you are actually phasing or just faking.
---
I've honestly thought that this should be the case. They're the ones with the knowledge of how it's done and the other ones are "students".
---
I love that freakin lunge
---
Then it's Insidious Bubba
---
Oh yeah, the intent is definitely for them to be picked up after. Either to injured or healthy.
---
Although I prefer  the idea of having the option early for a greater risk and greater reward. Do I brutalize them immediately, for a debuff in the match longer, but risk losing momentum? Or do I wait until I'm sure I'm ahead before doing it?
---
I wasnt downed at all that game from mending.
---
So ground portals+lunge? That's a decent moveset
---
If you are on iOS just create a new Apple ID choosing a country that is in the beta program.
---
If you are on Android you have two choices: 1)Download and install an APP called TapTap (a chinese play store, but it Is fully translated in english) and Simply install DBD mobile.
---
2)Create a Google account choosing a country that is in the beta program and then use a VPN to download the app.
---
You don't always have phasing available, plus survivors might reveal themselves to your husk while phasing, which is useful if you lost track of them.

1.8m is above average height though?

---
Oh shit, the German leak actually was real, I was so sure it was fake. There are some pretty strong perks all around then!
---
I wish we had the option to mercy-unhook a survivor. Seems borderline useless but I've had cases where a survivor died on first hook because nobody rescued him and I (the killer) got pissed because I was on the other side of the map and the other 3 just let him die for no reason. Could also have been a STBFL obsession for example too.
---
Woah, that only happened to me once. That was at the very end of the match
---
It really was.
---
Well with the upcoming bloodweb change that'll hopefully make it less grindy it's nice to see the devs try to make the grind more fair and balanced for players and how we went from a super grindy bloodweb with expensive prices and a ridiculous level requirement for perk slots to what we have now.

I block ALL messages in post-game chat. I'm tired of the toxicity, I prefer my performance in game to speak for me at this point.

---
If this also triggers "Regression Over Time" as if you kicked the generator, and works with Overcharge 3-gen Doctor just got 10x more irritating.
---
Did you check the Shrine section at the right?
---
Doctor mains who torment people on Gideons will love this.
---
Ill give it the 2nd week of the ptb till it gets nerfed
---
I really want them to add Pinhead from Hellraiser tbh
---
Its a licensed killer, they cant just create some crazy ability.
---
So... you?
---
I‚Äôd replace Q&amp;Q with dance with me
---
Do you have iOS or Android?
---
It's a decent enough mixup and I still pull it off vs red ranks but it's situational. If you are doing it at a loop, you  want it to be a low loop that you can see over, and you want to stand in a position that gives you good vision of the survivor, this way you can adjust and choose to actually phase if need be.
---
The other place it works is right after you hook someone. When you get a hook and turn around to go do something else, it sometimes is worth a standstill if you are going against a team that unhooks really quickly. When they see your (fake) "husk", some survivors will peek and move immediately over to the hook so they can try and secure the unhook during your power's cooldown. Hooking someone and standing still for 3-4 seconds will *occasionally* let u see this survivor and pressure them off the unhook for very little work on your part.
---
Both of these are situational and won't work against every survivor everytime. But standstill spirit makes them second guess where you really are and that's a powerful thing on Spirit because she 100% relies on winning mindgame situations. Of course, all of this loses to having good headphones and listening to her footsteps but there's ways around that too.
---
I‚Äôve done it now. Thanks anyway!
---
I can see that, though I'd argue that the game shouldn't be balanced around players that quit as soon as they start losing.
---
The trick for newer players will be to make sure the debuff isn't too oppressive. The point of brutalizing wouldn't be to make killers stronger and swing the game in your favor. It would be to add a gameplay element to the idea that the devs want you to extend the match, doing so with a (minor) reward instead of a punishment unseen until after the match.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôve got it now
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Yep. The key is if you use Overcharge, will the generators also be overcharged ontop of normal regression?
---
I‚Äôve done it now
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
It's a licensed killer, they have to stay within the parameters of that character. I think you're reading too deeply into a non issue
---
Ok cool
---
Because it‚Äôs licensed I think they have to adhere to the character as it is. I‚Äôm sure if they were able to come up with something more original they would have. But honestly, I have no problem with him being a nurse/hag hybrid, we‚Äôll just have to see how it plays out.
---
If we ever solo queue a hag together we're fucked cause I'm the same way. Why walk/crouch when you can sprint?
---
apparently
---
Inner strength looks amazing, I love it
---
flower face. he's halfway there already.
---
Spirit has gold inside her?
---
Monto: *Heavy breathing.*
---
Casuals
---
Inner Strength might be one of the best perks ever.
---
It's gonna get nerfed hard.
---
Dwight mains, rise up.
---
They definitely get hit in one situation, potentially in the other, and not at all in the third. I didn‚Äôt say they get hit at the 3rd option....
---
I did. If I wanted to be called a bitch constantly I‚Äôd go back to my call centre job HIYO
---
Slow the conversation down *Just a little bit*
---
I‚Äôll definitely try that TAT
---
Really disappointed.  Baby sitter is worthless compared to borrowed time.  If a killer is camping, camaraderie won't do much and if the killer isn't camping it's useless as whoever is in the radius can just save.  Second wind seems decent but it is very situational.  Also it will give the killer a great notification to tunnel the person off hook. Compared to the killer perks these are awful.
---
Not talking about Second Wind, with Babysitter you can get a safe hook rescue easier allowing Deliverance to activate
---
No, they showed all three.
---
No they didn‚Äôt.
---
Better Together, Fixated, Inner Strength. That‚Äôs three perks.
---
i have been wanting something like Fixated for a long time now! ill never let another spirit phase on my ass in chase again
---
No they showed all three
---
Theres 3
---
Inner strength is gonna be a noob trap lol. For like a month after DLC release you're gonna get a free hook from checking lockers EVERY TIME someone cleanses a totem.
---
Welp killer main here I come
---
there were three, see https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu1mie/nancy_wheelers_teachables/
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/B1Oijor](https://imgur.com/a/B1Oijor)
---
I can see fixated and inner strength getting nerfed because of salty killer mains in a week.
---
That's my wet dream demon.
---
They showed all three
---
I was in a game against a Freddy after a few minutes of trying to get a single gen done one of my teamates got hooked after I was then DCed the other 2 ran around for a bit before they DCed and now with 5 gens still needed to be done I kinda wanted to let the killer have a 4k seeing as I. had a slim chance of escaping as none of my teamates healed me after my hook. After about 30 second after my teamates DC the Freddy found the hatch and closed it after it went into the endgame I ran to one of the gates as it wasn't to far away and managed to escape.
---
Which pro?
---
With fixated now a real perk. People are going to now understand how strong Lightweight is.
---
Username checks out
---
They did do all 3: the one that reveals the generator you are working on, the one that let's you see your scratch marks, and the one that heals you in a locker.
---
No they showed all three.
---
First one is the gen perk aura perk if you are on a gen with someone else (and you can see the aura of others when someone near you is downed), second is you see your own scratch marks, third is if you cleanse a totem then hide in a locker for 8 seconds, you are fully healed.
---
Wow, okay.
---
The generator aura perk
---
The scratchmark perk
---
The totem cleanse locker heal
---
I used to main Michael, now I main Nurse with devour hope
---
Downvote me, I dare you.
---
Yeah but if you just wait out the 60 seconds of broken, won‚Äôt it just fully heal you after that?
---
I feel like every nurse will run mindbreaker to eliminate their only chase counter - dead hard.
---
‚Ä¢Inner Strength (Heal oneself after cleansing a totem and hiding in a locker after 8 seconds)
---
‚Ä¢Better Together (Survivors see you working on generators in a 32 meter range)
---
‚Ä¢Fixated (You see your own scratch marks and walk 20% faster)
---
good shit man
---
fast on those screen shots
---
Good catch lmao
---
They'll wait until after the chapter is out and people bought the Demogorgon before they nerf it. No refunds.
---
Initially I dislike how Mindbreaker and Cruel Confinement punishes survivors for doing gens. Now we gotta wait for PTB to see how these perks actually play out. Might not be that bad, might be worse than anyone could expect. 
---
As for Surge, yet another gen slowing perk, as if there weren't enough already. Not very fond of this one in the slightest.
---
his hair doesn't look that bad wtf.
---
This perks are strong as fuuuuuuuuuc\* boi. Being exhausted is huge for the majority of players and 35 second of not vaulting is basically a free down if you are in a chase. This is going to be interesting.
---
With only 5 totems on the map, it won't trigger often. Even then, Iron Maiden actually gets buffed because people will run it.
---
I don't think I worded the perk right, but in order for devoted commander's stun to be up you need all four tokens and then pop them.
---
Each license will allow the devs to do different things with the characters.
---
I really think these are the best perks that have been release in a while!
---
I feel like I'm about to become a Nancy main
---
I didn't even think of that lol
---
Agreed

wanna 'splain yourself there bud
---
God the surge perk will be a nightmare if you get in a three gen at the end of the game
---
Lol. Awesome.
---
Mmmmm that‚Äôs some good shit right there.
---
I cant be the only one that thinks that because in one rank you feel like preschoolers trying to fight the rock, and then in rank 13 you have people that feel like they're Brady in the playoffs
---
I think Mind breaker is the only really solid perk here. I still don't expect to see it run much though.

Probably going to change so you cant get a stack before you're injured. Spawn next to a dull totem=free 8 second heal later in the game is a little strong. But hey I'm all for strong survivor perks. And it has counters, with Iron Maiden.
---
Surge: Too situational and only works on basic attacks
---
Mindbreaker: Literally only counters a single perk and it's the worst exhaustion one, Spint Burst
---
Cruel Confinement: Also too situational and a bad bandaid for infinites, yet again. 
---
Guess it was about time we got a killer without a single decent perk.
---
Wow mindbreaker is a terrible perk
---
Sloppy butcher works good too
---
Definitely the best perks released in a while! Good job BHVR &lt;3
---
BT &gt;
---
When you see the killer coming just stop for 3 seconds.
---
I got bored of the series after Amanda‚Äôs death
---
maybe if survivors that have like hemorrhage could be found with killers instinct every so often it would be cool. but we can always hope the future - it doesnt mean that wont bring something like that to the table later.
---
Ok i will be playing Nancy first to get those perk but still going to main Steve after that
---
Idk, Steve‚Äôs self heal looks wayyyy stronger. Finding a dull is hard enough than you cleanse it, hide in a locker for 10 seconds and then you‚Äôre healed. Doesn‚Äôt seem any better than just getting a teammate to heal you
---
I haven‚Äôt played as much as most people in this sub, but all of these perks seem good, Steve‚Äôs too.
---
Surge + overcharge + PGTW + ruin. The ultimate "fuck gens" build.
---
I classify tunneling as ignoring everyone else and going after the unhooked survivor. If I'm survivor and I just happen to run back into the killer after an unhook? Thats not tunneling thats me being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
---
If the killer is camping it waste an extra 14 seconds for the team to do gens.
---
yeah, that's how it should work:
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/470813433?t=00h42m45s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/470813433?t=00h42m45s)
---
I think Camaraderie is designed to help with situations where nobody comes to save you right away until you're seconds away from dying, only to die right as they go to unhook.
---
I've had that happen more times than I can count, (Sometimes even on first hook because overly-immersed teammates) but FAR more often on first hook and I hit stage 2.
---
I mean Nurse is crazy but even she shouldn't be able get two hits within three seconds.
---
NOICE
---
I‚Äôve been using Small Game, Prove Thyself, Stake Out, Distortion to rush gens and do all of the totems
---
Sometimes I do a build to just save and heal and that‚Äôs Botany Knowledge, We‚Äôll Make It, Autodidact, Empathy
---
My meme build to hook farm for laughs is Borrowed Time, Empathy, Iron Will, Diversion
---
And if I wanna be a dick to the killer I use something like Adrenaline, D-Strike, Balanced Landing, Deliverance. Although sometimes I‚Äôll swap deliverance for something like Unbreakable or Borrowed Time
---
Everyone got at least one really strong (possibly meta defining) perk. I'd say that's a good thing, shake it up for a bit :) 
---
Head on/Second chance sounds like quite the wombo combo lol, I'm excited.
---
yeah, these look really useless. The killer's are definitely strong, but I liked Nancy's
---
LIGHTWEIGHT
---
FIXATED
---
URBAN ~~EVASION~~ IMMERSION
---
WHATEVER I GODDAMN WANT
---
We horror movie now boys
---
Surge on small maps could be very good and might make Surveillence less of a meme. Mindbreaker sounds annoying for survivors and mostly just counters Sprint Burst. Cruel Confinement will be very good on killers with one shots and very mediocre on everyone else. I dont think people realize how long it takes to hit a survivor twice if they just run in a straight line without a single pallet or window.
---
I think babysitter on its own isnt great, but if you pair it with borrowed time its pretty great. Most of these perks seem like supplements for a niche build rather than standalone god tier meta perks like adrenaline/dead hard and so on.
---
Yes, definitely. Definitely.
---
This really isn't that bad at all! Meg's literally run away the moment a faint heart beat is heard, which gives them approximately a 4 minute head start on the chase
---
inner strength will definitely be nerfed to fuck
---
but i wonder how long is it activated for and if you have to be injured whilst cleansing the totem so you can‚Äôt just have it ready for later on
---
This is a little strong lol
---
Better Together is so good for solo play and kinda meh for SWF lol
---
Second Wind seems like a shit perk. What if the unhook survivor has botany or We‚Äôll make it?
---
Fixated has the potential to be a new meta perk for stealth players.
---
Any word on Steve‚Äôs perks?
---
Megs will go down even faster now
---
edit: In case they actually had the balls to do a gen
---
It's only 32 metres. For some maps it'll be more of an issue than others, but most of the maps are large enough you're not going to affect more than a couple gens. It'll also encourage survivors not to lead the chase through gens that your teammates are working on.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu1mvt/all_three_of_demogorgons_perks/
---
Self heal besides a med kit isn‚Äôt worth using anymore imo. Takes too long to heal especially with sloppy butcher
---
Also, please don't buy this DLC and then get mad when they nerf the Demogorgon and/or all the perks.
---
And? If a dumbass survivor isn‚Äôt anywhere near gens, then they‚Äôre being stupid and aren‚Äôt playing the game right. A perk isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work optimally everytime, that‚Äôs a ridiculous expectation.
---
How about you see how the play out in game before calling for nerfs. That‚Äôs what the PTB is for.
---
Im sure it wont synergize with pgtw or overcharge. And you cant kick the gen with pgtw the second time unless it was touched.
---
I think Babysitter might need a slight buff plus it's hard countered by MYC which is a fairly common perk.
---
Inner Strength + Small Game is the new Anti Hex meta.
---
It doesnt counter dead hard.
---
yep
---
Oh okay, like the pig ambush... by the way, do you know the movespeed of this killer?
---
With the spirit game, at least, it could have been that something suddenly came up in real life for the dude.  That could explain why he was just standing there before he DC'd.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇur trolling right
---
Spotted the killer main. Maybe goes outside a bit more instead of complaining about every single thing a survivor has. Jesus.
---
yeah it probably does sound like alot but its not like they only work against one killer. and all the game i see in purple ranks (console) are spirit and hillbilly.
---
I didn‚Äôt know it stacked. Yeah this perk‚Äôs gonna be great
---
IW is also a strong perk by itself. You can run it as a generalist perk.
---
No no they are not. Literally Inner Strength and Fixated are the only somewhat decent perks.
---
It's much sweatier I assume
---
Can‚Äôt wait to see this reposted with Nancy.
---
What else did you expect?
---
Yeah I'm well aware this is just how people are on the internet. But I've literally never seen a reveal of a dlc or content update with this much negativity.
---
BHVR really said üëè fuck üëè self-care üëè
---
Better together is going to pair great with Prove Thyself. 
---
Fixated idk, I don't think I would get a ton of use out of it but pairing it with Sprint Burst would actually be pretty good. 
---
Inner strength seems really good but it also feels like it should make self care obsolete for all except noob3 types who are healing at a loop to force the killer to make a move besides just waiting for bloodlust.
---
Really interesting stuff, I'm excited to see them in action!
---
Lmao killer literally gets 3 amazing perks and survivors get "ok" perks and you think it's op.
---
Longer second phase timer won‚Äôt be an issue if you just stay away from the hooked survivor, only see it being fully useful in endgame 
---
There‚Äôs only 5 totems too? They‚Äôd waste time looking for it, would be cool midchase, but overall just don‚Äôt bring noed lol
---
They technically are but only in very specific circumstances IIRC like Haddonfield with Balanced landing, or certain loops or combinations of tiles with a 110% speed killer, etc.
---
Not really. Iron Maiden would counter it hard, and that‚Äôs besides the fact it‚Äôs not truly that strong. There‚Äôs only 5 totems, and four people cleansing. And it can only contain a single heal at a time.
---
But thinking that i was 14 when bf3 was released. I can say all i had was time. And 4000 hours in 21000 is just 5 hours a day approx.
---
Finally a good gen control perk that isn't ruin
---
Ah yes because as a survivor you always went to run towards Generators while being chased, I forgot.
---
If you post something... post the whole thing pls
---
Imma be a Steve main fr fr
---
I was just thinking this! But also it's going to make perks like Coulrophobia even more worthless than they were previously assuming the 10 second timer isn't affected.
---
Yeah I'm gonna have to keep doing that now. It genuinely pissed me off that people are just ignoring all the work thats put into these kinds of things.
---
I... am... DWIGHT!
---
This is why they didnt do the school. Lockers everywhere. Dwight's running in and out of them.
---
&gt;this game is obviously going to die in a few months  
---
&gt;Stranger Things chapter drops in September  
---
uh huh.
---
Fixated works while injured or uninjured? Also, why the restriction?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu1mie/nancy_wheelers_teachables/
---
Killer gets a single good perk and 2 with incredibly specific uses
---
What if all totems get cleansed, oof for you but oof for no ed
---
Yeah, but then you're running a trash perk like Stridor.
---
i know right! the perk icons look really good
---
Better Together + Prove thyself oooh yeah.

Surge is actually pretty good if you have a low terror radius since it works in a 32 meter radius. And this perk will make 3 gen situations very hard to get out of the dead lock. 
---
Cruel Confinement is not good. It won't work consistently enough unless you're a high mobility killer like Billy or Nurse, and even then Windows near a gen aren't that big of a deal. It might work decent with Tinkerer, but that's about it.
---
Mindbreaker is really bad. It only works on 50% or less, Only lasts for 3 seconds after they leave the gen. All it counters is immediate Sprint Bursts and Lithe, and that's it. The best part of the perk is the exhaustion CD pause, but you might as well just sit it out then start working on the gen. The exhaustion needs to last like 10 seconds for it to be useable.
---
A younger David King
---
You can use calm spirit
---
You realize your literally on a subreddit to talk about this game right?
---
I don't suck at catching survivors but going up against 4 man swf's or even red ranks it's almost impossible to not get gen rushed in the early game before you even get your first few downs
---
if you play against survivors who try to outrun you, they're not very good survivors
---
But will survivors actually attempt to do totems?
---
But can you do it with overcharge tier 3 + unnerving presence?  Those are *tiny*
---
This is the only repost I'll always upvote.
---
We already know what the perks do
---
I love that they're really making lockers into a useful part of the game lately. When I first started playing they were literally useless.
---
Iron Maiden will see more usage if Inner Strenght becomes meta.
---
Henderson !!!
---
I think I understand what you're trying to say but you worded it extremely poorly, when you use up an item it should simply be out of charges and unusable and still exist instead of breaking, because people just 99 items anyways.
---
Yeah but then u sacrifice another meta perk, but you know thats why we have variery which usually doesnt happen all we see is adrenaline ds dead hard borrowed and if someone is running iron will as a killer i dont mind it
---
Alrighty, thank you!
---
I mean, people will get bored of any game evetually
---
Meanwhile killer can cause exhaustion by just the survivor's main objective.
---
Meanwhile killer can break multiple generators, the main and only objective by just smacking someone down.
---
Meanwhile killer can shut off windows for a minute by just having the survivor do their main objective.
---
But let's pretend the live longer on the hook and healing in a locker from a totem cleanse is way too strong.
---
Only effects walking, so running is normal speed.
---
Mistake - Fixated - walking speed is increased while UNinjured. 
---
Plus, isn't better together supposed to allow everyone to see everyone else's auras?
---
Adrenaline still needs a nerf then.
---
Will be your peepaw
---
And yet we havent seem them in action, nor in their final state.
---
Inner strength is lowkey a nerf for NOED. Previously survivors didn't do dull totems, now everyone who runs this perk will be looking for one right off the bat.
---
Bruh. Steve requieres you to be outside heartbeat. It‚Äôs like self caring but without being useless.
---
Nancy‚Äôs 8 have limited uses, literally strong countered by Iron Maiden and Thrill of the Hunt, and just how many times are you going to be able to get inside of a locker without the killer instantly noticing you in a chase?
---
This Tracer from overwatch thingy you said, I've been telling people for months now that I would do this to Nurse, and I still believe this is the perfect way to balance her, but people disagree with it for some reason, and I don't really understand why. Might be just Nurse mains downvoting LULW
---
Like i said to the other guy I've never seen a community react this way to an update before. It was a ridiculous amount of toxicity and negativity to something that they havent even tried yet but somehow think they have enough of a grasp on it that its garbage and their opinion is 100% right and irrefutable.
---
it should have verticality, able to go from a 1st floor to a 2nd, or thru windows if u angle it properly
---
I will buy it. Im also sure that 3/9 perks will get nerfed within 6 months
---
...And you're why killers think survivors are all toxic swfs.
---
Ah shit here we go again. 
---
Killers whine about semi-strong survivor perks until they‚Äôre nerfed into obscurity.
---
Killers are gonna start having haunted ground üòÇ
---
That would be a really nice idea
---
The Demogorgon can place down portals to the upside down wherever it wants and then traverse the map quickly through them. And then he can pounce and hit survivors from a distance for chases.
---
I wonder if killers will start running Iron Maiden because you know Inner Strength is gonna be a popular perk
---
No, once you‚Äôre exhausted you always have at least a 40 second timer until you recover. I think they added that extra bit about the three seconds in case someone decided to 99% their exhaustion, then hop on a gen to work around the perk. I think they would hav explicitly said ‚ÄúAn exhaustion that lasts three seconds if what you were saying was true. I could be wrong, but if I am this perk is actually garbage and it seems like Behavior has gone all out on these Demagorgon powers.
---
Which is OP on the Spirit because she can hear injured sounds when using her power
---
Neither, don't waste your shards on these perks.
---
You cant kick regressing gen.
---
IW is literally a top rated perk and solidly belongs in the meta.
---
Am I the only one who just sort of guessed where my scratchmarks are already? I think it's actually more effective as a combo with sprint burst, you don't suffer as much walking around the map and then you can sprintburst at any time the killer comes near.
---
Thats to say the addons will be good
---
There are 32 days of summer left
---
Maybe use the perks before making a judgement then.
---
No mother self care, then the two new healing perks is the new meta
---
They outsmarted themselves.
---
Are you fucking serious. Inner strenght too good? There's 5 totems on the map. You're probably not gonna even find all of them and you probably won't even get injured and if you do im pretty sure you'll run into your friends and they'll heal you up.
---
If a killer runs this, i guarantee an experienced survivor will ignore this debuff and just do the gen. Working 40 secs on a gen is a lot better since thats about half of a gen. And most of the time survs arent even exhausted while working on a gen
---
Because they are using base cosmetics and 80% of players look like that
---
Spine Chill
---
Lucky for you it hides scratch marks too! So you can at least get away from the person.
---
one of the demigorgons perks has killed sprint burst and other exhaustion perks unfortunately so im pretty sure sprint burst is on the way out as a meta perk because it becoming useless just by doing your objective is way to pig an risk
---
When I do this as a killer cause their toxic it feels bad
---
Mettle of Man was uncounterable for M1 killers. These perks aren‚Äôt as good as old mom but still need a change
---
Is this real or are these fan made?
---
Yeah and people shouldn‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs not entertaining it‚Äôs sad. How can people enjoy someone being a dick and ruining people‚Äôs games. The lack of empathy is so incredible
---
That‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs worded on the actual perk, it‚Äôs worded as ‚Äòany existing exhaustion timers are paused while the Survivor is repairing the gen and this effect persists for 1/2/3 second after leaving the gen‚Äô. 
---
To me it sounds like your exhaustion won‚Äôt go down while on the gen and the 1/2/3 second pause is to prevent people gen tapping to get their exhaustion back and work around this perk.
---
Killer brutalizing ideas:
---
Doctor: Maybe lifts them and gives a shock directly to their forehead. For the rest of the match, that survivor has a new madness effect (similar to the effect of the iridescent king). Just one effect.
---
Myers: A couple ideas. Maybe doesn't harm them at all, but lets them get away while he watches. Increases that survivor's "evil" pool. Letting Myers stalk them more. Maybe an obsession mechanic letting him  mori his obsession in the endgame if he brutalizes them multiple times.
---
Freddy: Maybe makes them fall asleep faster or take longer to wake up for the rest of the game.
---
Demigorgan: Maybe implants something in the survivor. Every minute or so after this, the Demigorgan sees the survivor's aura for 5 seconds.
---
Did I say you'd be doing those things at the same time? I swear to god people on this sub are some of the dumbest people alive and can't interpret shit like a normal person.
---
Good lord that‚Äôs amazing
---
Right.
---
100% is default survivor sprint speed
---
All I can imagine is a survivor rag dolling with all their limbs missing like a Fallout 4 player after taking a Mini-nuke to the face.
---
Hey, they didn't confirm *or* deny that they got the actors for voices, so it's still possible.
---
Yea, her perks are intense. I finally feel like both the killer and survivors perks are on point for this DLC.
---
The important thing is that they try their best.
---
That doesn‚Äôt work because it doesn‚Äôt help when getting in lockers
---
A worse thing is how so few people wanna be in the higher ranks, so there's just a bunch of smurfs, trolls, facecampers (since they derank from it), Ochido-wannabes and such infesting the lower ranks.. where the newbies would come in.
---
I /Need/ those killer perks.  Holy crap.
---
I had a Ghostface yesterday call my team trash because we didn't use pallets enough...
---
Is it possible for multiple generators to be within 32 meters? I think at very least the range of surge should be 40 meters.
---
&gt; We don't know what freedoms they had to play around with
---
I highly doubt the stranger things creators said "you must give the demogorgon a teleport ability!"
---
Man y'all say that about every killer that isn't Nurse tier
---
My first tought lol
---
This almost looks rendered, what did you use to make it?
---
Well that's just your opinion, not a fact. Stop treating it like one. And while you're at it, stop acting like a petulant child every time your opinion get challenged/criticized.
---
but what about when you try your best bUT YOU DONT SUCCEEEEEEEEEDD
---
It is 8% normally, so I would assume it‚Äôs 20%
---
It activates any time you break a totem.
---
Loving inner strength, babysitter, surge and fixated!
---
However ... does fixated work with urban evasion? Does babysitter work with distortion? That'd make them pretty OP.
---
No but if you stun the killer then they have no clue were you went
---
Nope.
---
Crouching and walking speeds are two different things.
---
I‚Äôd have to disagree with Mindbreaker tbh. A lot of people depend on exhaustion perks in this game, and most of us usually let the timer dwindle while we‚Äôre working on gens, killing two birds with one stone, you could say. That means if you wanna use your dead hard, sprint burst, head on, etc. in a chase you have to actively avoid working on gens or avoid interacting with the killer in the middle of the exhaustion timer.
---
Its anti-camp, it's great, if you can't get someone off a hook just walk by them, then go do generators. You'll have them all done before the hooked person dies
---
Urban Ninja increases your crouching speed, not walking. So, doesn't stack.
---
Thats your opinion and you should keep it for yourself
---
I think they made a mistake going with the demogorgon vs the rat sludge monster from s3. Its power could have been something cool and actually good, like killing a survivor turns them to goop and boosts your speed or something
---
Billy main?
---
Fixated requires walking. You are not walking while using Urban Evasion. Therefore, they are completely unrelated.
---
Yup, I feel like mindbreaker will really mess up my usual gameplay as survivor. I'm both scared and excited
---
It pauses the exhaustion timer when they get on it.
---
I love them all! Definitely gonna run some of these perks
---
I mean fixated is a faster urban evasion except your more visible. And the totem heal is pretty good, but is it better than self-care? I think it‚Äôs only faster than self care if you happen to find a totem really close to you, otherwise the time it takes to go and find a totem combined with the cleansing and waiting in locker would only make it equal or a bit shorter than just self caring.
---
This comment aged like a fine wine
---
Let's not forget that during the stream they said the Demogorgon had outfits. Which means survivors might too. Gimme Scoops Ahoy
---
Bruh moment x2. Use your power to gen control. Ruin is not mandatory as long as you can keep these filthy survivors off your gens. If you play defensive, you may injure them a lot and not down them. However, the gens are not being completed. Time it right, and it‚Äôs a hook with no gens done. Easier said than done but possible. Don‚Äôt like it? Many perks are entering the ‚Äúdo not complete gens‚Äù area. Ruin being one of them. I like pop goes the weasel because I don‚Äôt relay in totem spawns. Also, you can always yeet  Nancy by running haunted grounds.
---
You havent even tried them or played against them. Its not like Mettle of Man where you can obviously tell its broken before playing with it. These perks are all good and really unique which is great. Please stop immediately thinking of nerfs when survivors/killers get a decent DLC perk for once. Or do you want everyone to run the same 6-8 perks for the rest of this games life cycle?
---
Real
---
Yeah the demo is very underwhelming, I'll wait to watch what better killers than me can do with him but so far he doesn't seem very impressive
---
you didn't explain shit, you just asked OP if she even watches his content. üôÑ
---
We've finally reached the end of the self care meta
---
I know I‚Äôm just memeing we will see how he plays out. Looks like a strong mid tier, not too strong not too weak.
---
Gens are the only thing that really matters. If they choose not to do a Gen for 30 or so seconds that's incredible.
---
Can you use it multiple times?
---
Surge is really damn good, I like it stick it on Doctor.
---
Cruel Confinement is very situational but on a map like Lery's it has good potential.
---
Mindbreaker I think is good, mainly because it causes Exhaustion to not go down while on gens so now we have Exhaustion that doesn't go away while sprinting or doing gens which is mainly what survivors do.
---
As long as BHVR properly utilizes the PTB and makes adjustments from the feedback they get there shouldn't be a major need to nerf anything too harshly after launch.
---
They said during stream it was already in progress before they even saw season 3
---
Mother of God
---
u mean buffed? when they are healed no dead hard and a waste of perk slot.
---
Yo. Nancy is dope as shit. I'm going to have so much fun with her perks. :D
---
Hehe I see what you did there
---
Exactly. Like most of the cast I don't think he has a lot to fight really coordinated teams, but he won't be a pushover by any means. He could be Freddy-adjacent because his teleport is less reliable but works for the whole game. Both of their chase powers just end it a little bit faster.
---
I think time is the most valuable currency. Paired with the right perks the Demo could have plenty of time.
---
Those people have no idea how this game works then.
---
Let's take the "worst" scenario: a Doc, with unnerving presence, distressing, overcharge, and brutal strength, and 2 calm or a calm and order addons. 
---
He sees 3 generators close to eachother, so from the very beginning of the game he does not give a rat's ass about the other 4 generators. So the survivors do those 4 generators, and now they have to do only one. There's 4 of them, should be easy, right? Well, if they can conistently hit the 1mm unnerving overcharge skillcheck that appears on a random part of the screen. 
---
It stalls the game. Gens are not being done, and the killer doesn't want to kill, but defend the last 3 generators with his world/galaxywide skillcheck-drugging terror radius. 
---
It wastes everyone's time for no real goal for either side.
---
are you sure? all i saw was that he said he couldnt comment on it
---
Fixated is gonna be so nice for stealthy players and vs Nurse
---
It will have the smallest impact on dead hard which is still the strongest exhaustion perk (except on Haddonfield)
---
He clearly isn‚Äôt a nice/ good person if he goes out of his way to be an asshole in game to get clout
---
I'm a little confused by what you mean here tbh
---
Ah man I love him to bits hes my highest killer so gar
---
Only complaint is I wish camaraderies numbers were a tad higher but mostly solid perks. Even more Excited to play Nancy now. Demo looks super cool in game. I hope he isn‚Äôt weak.
---
mind breaker seems OP but i like the other ones
---
Well that perk incentives to use it.
---
A couple of them seem like they need it. Like fixated and inner strength are gonna be complained about. And you know it
---
Okay so you‚Äôre okay with supporting asshole behaviour. Quality person.
---
Why should people even care, if they really wanted to they could pick and choose which characters they wanted to buy if they only wanted one or two of them.
---
Yes, but there are only 5 totems. (And for a while everyone is going to be doing them for this perk.)
---
5 hours a day every day is quite a lot, did you have school or something?
---
It really depends on the second ability, and mabey how many portal things he can place down at once
---
Based on the perk text, it doesn't have to be a Hex totem, it can be a dull totem too. So most of the time you won't even know they've cleansed a totem and gotten in a locker.
---
Survivors run at 4.0m/s or 100%. The slower killers run at 4.4m/s or 110%. Faster killers 4.6m/s or 115%. Nurse is the only exception with a movement speed of 3.85m/s or 96.25%.
---
&gt;Okay but isn‚Äôt it like next month... lol you get a daily a day
---
While this is true, you can use your 2 daily attempts during this month to get a Mori daily and save it, since its worth 60k.
---
Is that it? MoM, DS, old BT, Self-Care, general healing times, gen-times, flashlight save timing, etc.
---
Yes, but that could also be a problem. What if someone takes hits or something and then wastes all the totems? If there is no totems hooray for no no ed but what good is no ed if you‚Äôre injured? You‚Äôre obviously just gonna get tunneled end game.
---
I agree though I am curious what addons will be beneficial with the demo but I'm sure it will be something that increases the pounce distance but it roars longer similar to the nurse.
---
i think so yeah
---
Nancy requires you to find a totem (the time this takes increases as more or destroyed... you could have someone looking when all five are gone). Destroy it (over 10 seconds, much more with TOTH). And then go in a locker (8 seconds). Steve‚Äôs perk requires you to FULLY heal someone (16 seconds). Then GET HOOKED, then be outside the radius (20 seconds). All while being unable to heal with any other method, ruining We‚Äôll Make It, and stopping insta heals!
---
No, these do not need nerfs.
---
Also keep in mind Steve‚Äôs perk is still effected by broken from other perks, and Nancy is COMPLETELY DESTROYED by Iron Maiden
---
They dont synergize well. You use urban to crouch at walking speed while reducing your profile. If you had fixated you wouldnt be using Urban Evasion.
---
So self care instead?
---
I don't know what killer you're playing as but especially if you're new the killer you play as really starts to matter.After like rank 7 and up you better play high-top tier killers or be sure you'll get wrecked except if you're a god at killer,honestly I can't pip at all at 5+ if I use something else than spirit,plague or huntress.
---
I would be so hype if I met Monto, the most genuine DBD personality, I‚Äôm sure he was hecka nice
---
Thank you !
---
Can you explain why? I genuinely don't see the point of this perk. You're broken, noone can heal you, you have to be outside of the terror radius to heal.
---
Usually if the killer is away, you just heal under the hook, and if the killer is close, you couldn't heal anyway, and the perk won't heal either because of the terror radius.
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
That's true, well I will hold out hope then :)
---
The only thing "fixing" the hook vacuums is gonna do is increase the amount of time to get to a hook by a milisecond. You will continue to complain about getting hooked at 99 percent struggle even after that. It is literally so irrelevant and doesnt effect shit.
---
I see literally none of these perks being used over meta perks. Surge and Second Wind are the only even potentially good ones.
---
I doubt that. They probably wanted some kind of selfcare/adre alternative and limit it somehow. Totems are a nice alternative for that.
---
Yeah I think it‚Äôs about 23 seconds being 15 for the totem cleansing and 8 at tier 3 for healing so it doesn‚Äôt seem worth it if progressed in a straight line.
---
If you do use two perk slots it may be better to bring self care and botany knowledge as I believe if both are tier 3 it may be a bit faster than the 23 seconds required at tier 3 but it doesn‚Äôt remove an objective. So I think it‚Äôs just how people like to play which determines which combo is better.
---
The additions to regression from lullaby and popgoes are additive so I'm not sure why this wouldn't be.
---
Why didn't people just cleanse back then?
---
Didn't they say that the pounce mode activates killer's instinct?
---
The goal of the game isnt destroy the enemy, is to make a good show, a good horror movie.
---
And I dislike that. Not because of the idea, but its execution, the game lack perks or tricks that can make it FUN to make a good horror movie instead of a good Genocide.
---
The Demogorgon, with this stuff about "Cant hear terror radius while cleansing portals" make me realize about the potential for Real Horror Situations, I mean, it would be stresfull, you know he knows youre there, but you dont know when he's coming.
---
You're comparing a pounce attack to a teleport? You're honestly just complaining to complain at this point. Get over it. Like I said the killer isnt everything if it really matters that much to you.
---
Keep in mind, it can‚Äôt turn during this lunge
---
Credit to u/idealmori for the original artwork.
---
Nah, the one that regresses gens it's the only good one, other two are mediocre at best
---
The real question is, can second wind heal no mither?
---
Doctor mains exist?
---
Usually a decent player will see that they're the obsession and afflicted by DL and will just play super immersed
---
no. the map will get it's own hook. as he said hooks arent tied to killer anymore
---
Fixated, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, and Lightweight
---
Bout to play tag in this bitch
---
I tried watching his content, and couldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt like supporting toxic behaviour. My original comment was too aggressive he isn‚Äôt a bad person I think his gaming style is. Also i don‚Äôt think ‚Äútoxic but not that toxic‚Äù is a valid argument. I do appreciate you also putting out a nice response. I‚Äôm just sick of toxic behaviour and ruining the game for other people being a way to get clout in basically every game
---
Aunt Josephine's House as a map. BHVR pls
---
We‚Äôll have to wait until TS to see. Even if that‚Äôs the case, you‚Äôd have to be going against a pretty awful killer to keep it infinite
---
i guess she was the size of the entire circus
---
Please remove this post. This is my artwork and you even cropped out my signature.
---
The idea of the perk is being time efficient. Activate the perk, get unhooked and escape, then after escaping do gens. You won't waste time healing up and will get full health while doing gens.
---
So many amazing perks
---
I agree on Nancy.
---
Steve's still seems like it should be nerfed.
---
Fully healing a teammate is the same action you did before, which you would probably do even without the perk. 
---
And now we come to the part where its time to get hooked. What a killer thinks when he hooks a survivor? Hey, they'll waste time rescuing and then healing him, and only then go back to gens.
---
This time they go straight to gens and strongly lower the map pressure killer has built with hooking.
---
Yea, now you have even more reasons to do so, not just defend from noed, they even increased the cleanse bonus bloodpoints to like a 1k? Definitely not bad strategy
---
His power is exactly Nurse's 2nd teleport. Even the "stun" at the end of it is the same. You're sucking BHVR's balls for the sake of it at this point
---
There's a lot of misconceptions here so let's go through them. 
---
1. Rank 15-1 means very little for skill, or as some people prefer, knowledge. Both on the survivor and killer side. Two reasons for this: Firstly, the pipping system is just too generous. You genuinely have to go out of your way to avoid a safety pip. Secondly, both sides have busted items, addons, offerings, and exploitable game mechanics. Instaheals, moris, it's all busted. And when I say exploitable mechanics, I mean survivors can queue up in a SWF with rank 20s for the actual newbie killers at ranks 20-15 and killers can lobby dodge any items, swf, number of hours, whatever until they see a favorable match. None of this is conducive to a competitive environment where rank means anything. If you want to get to red ranks, you will get there.
---
2. Rank has almost everything to do with how much time you put in during that particular season and the only thing rank does is dictate matchmaking. There are no rewards or incentives for ranking up. All you get are longer queue times with the same players playing the same killers and survivors; and perhaps you also achieve some intrinsic notion of accomplishment. 
---
3. Rank reset exists. Even the players that play a lot and play normally (ie not deranking or ranking up slowly) will go back to green ranks. It makes it so there is a barren wasteland of survivors that play a lot during that month... or that are attempting rank 1 for the first time. That's where this meme of finding more potatoes the further you rank up comes from. BHVR's own system screws red rank matchmaking more than anything and encourages smurfing.
---
So long as these issues exist, you'll find people deranking or purposely ranking up slowly on both sides.
---
Babysitter will also be decent with Distortion, at least i plan to try them together. That would mean neither of you would leave scratch marks for a while and you will block the killer from seeing your aura.
---
This is when shaking your head as killer is acceptable haha
---
DG sounds alright. Having map mobility takes it up to B tier at a minimum. Can't really judge pounce yet, we'll see how it handles on PTB. Regardless, he'll need some setup time at game start,  so ruin or corrupt is mandatory.
---
Surge is bad.  Might be OK if it triggers overcharge, but it'll make it straight up impossible to apply pop goes the weasel to any nearby gens since they're regressing.
---
Confinement is situationally awesome. Turns a lot of safe spots into death traps, but it's situational and obvious. Unfortunately, if the gen isn't near windows you're using, the perk does nothing. 
---
Mind breaker counters SB. Ok on stealth killers like Wraith or Pig. If the exhaustion is normal exhaustion,  the perk is decent. If it's a flat duration it's kinda meh.
---
Babysitter is really cool. Not super strong,  but damn cool and fits Steve perfectly. 
---
Camaraderie is super situational, but is great at low ranks.
---
Second wind is cool,  but honestly just run Inner  Strength. 
---
Better together is mediocre. 
---
Fixated is awesome. Maybe survivors will now understand how  broken scratch marks are. 
---
Inner Strength is A tier, easily the strongest perk of the patch. Combo with Quick and Quiet, and hiding in chase will give you a heal. The combo with DS is brutal, since the killer is punished regardless of whether they pull you out or not. It's  incredible for recovering for a basement play.
---
Can confirm. If this works with Overcharge I'm going to use Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving, and Surge.
---
That perk kinda hard counters survivor meta of ‚Äúrushing gens‚Äù. You can afford to stay on a gen even while injured because of perks like Dead Hard. If a killer breaks chase with someone because its lasting too long, that survivor immediately hops on a generator and knows that their exhaustion will come back before he comes back. But with that perk it would only start to cooldown after 50%.
---
Probably not worth running but exhaustion add ons have proven to be really obnoxious. This is like an exhaustion add on effect for every killer.
---
No Mither, Resilience, Fixated combo for the win.
---
THAT WOULD BE SO FUCKING COOOOL
---
If you look really close Kate also has jiggle physics too (or at least her default styled outfits do), but as far as I can tell most of the other female survivors don't. 
---
This kind of just implies to me that Default Kate isn't wearing a bra and Jane's just a heavier set woman so those things are definitely gonna go nuts if she's running, both are pretty realistic in comparison to Clown's stomach jiggle physics which seem to have a epileptic seizure as soon as he starts walking.
---
This picture is true of almost every survivor honestly
---
Hey I'm a killer main and I think they're fine :( we don't all whine man
---
Me too im thinking I‚Äôll try to play more survivor while leveling up my demogorgon
---
I think That the ability to basically teleport to other locker could be considered a secondary power
---
They have added credit in another comment.
---
OH
---
I cant wait for the blair witch to come to game pass
---
The question Is "is it better than the options we have?" I personally don't think so. It seems like another of those perks that's really good on Nurse, but nobody else can really fit it into their build. Much like Terrifying Presence or I'm All Ears.
---
At least Leatherface gets an insta-down. When Billy does the same thing, with less drawbacks, he gets an insta-down too. Though, I wonder if this would allow the Demogorgon to hop over obstacles?
---
That's how it reads to me, basically break a totem, go in locker get a heal.   
---
Perk is then deactivated.
---
Ohh so when I find an exception to your rule, it suddenly just doesn't count.
---
i wouldn‚Äôt mind an el survivor, but she‚Äôs not much of a *survivor*
---
Otz makes dbd videos on his second channel if you didnt know already
---
As opposed to a free escape anytime, yeah no. Killers can still counter new DS by slugging and 55% wiggle wasn‚Äôt hard if someone took a hit at hook. Dribble also wasted tons of time and could be bypassed with a 4‚Äôo‚Äôclock skill check.
---
‚ÄúSurvivors shouldn‚Äôt get perks this strong while killer perks are still weak‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm done with this discussion, it‚Äôs clear you have no logic relating to balance in a video game.
---
the real problem is they designed the perk without any thought to how it would affect the game's balance. it never should have existed in the first place; free invinciblity as a reward for being hit 3 times? that's a massive reward for 3 failures. and it punished only the weakest killers, simply for playing the game correctly, whether or not they were facecampers or otherwise assholes.
---
It could be pretty neat to combo with Lullaby.
---
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I love indoor maps and I'm super excited for this.
---
&gt;Immersed
---
&gt;Doctor
---
Pick one. I've ran Dying Light as part of the 3-gen build and finding the obsession usually isn't that hard, (I try to check which survivor they are, and listen for the scream) it's getting them dead that's the hard part although a Mori speeds up the process.
---
EDIT: Once the obsession is dead, the end-game 3-gen is nigh impossible as they are both down a man + have Dying Light active.
---
They‚Äôre not completely useless... Realistically there‚Äôs 2 survivor perks that are decent enough to make it into high rank builds. All three killer perks are good enough to be worked into high rank builds... 3 vs 2 isnt a bad ratio
---
Not to be a dick man, but that‚Äôs what happens when you post stuff on the internet. To be fair, he did give you credit. Nice artwork though
---
Laughs in NOED*
---
if they dont have the perk u just endangered urself and wasted a shit ton of time?
---
I mean it kinda does counter lithe and dead hard you see if they are already exhausted when they get on the gen their timer stops, making them not get it back
---
I agree with your point but honestly you're being an asshat about it too. I didnt like any of Steve's perks. Demi is just hag 2.0 with lunge etc. But I think the thing that you're missing is that it fits in line with the characters. Have you seen the show? The demi doesnt teleport around. Everything freddy does in game he could do in the movies as well if he wanted. The way you brought it up is also snarky and unnecessary.
---
Throw on Inner strength and Head On to get the full Dwight Locker experience!
---
Aaaaaaaaaand I was about to watch season 3
---
Cruel confinement... this is going to be fun
---
I'll probably remain as Dwight, but I'll 100% level nancy for Inner strength. I can do up to 4 totems most rounds
---
Cool
---
So hyped. New map looks completely different from all the other ones. I was kind of worried they'd smash Lery's and Gideon together and call it a day but well done devs
---
It would be pretty nuts without the restriction. With the restriction its still a very good perk, especially for sprint burst gamers. But being able to walk fast and see your scratch marks, ‚Äúbreak chase and hide 4head‚Äù might actually be possible.
---
why is nobody talking about Better Together? That shits gold for a gen slut like myself
---

---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works. Once someone comes within 16 meters, hook timer pauses for 14 seconds, then finishes. It‚Äôs not going to keep activating over and over. All it‚Äôs doing is adding a flat 14 seconds and that‚Äôs the extent of the perk. It sounds garbage.
---
A lot of these look incredible. Inner strength and second wind are perks that finally look like they can take down those than run self care to uselessly sit in a corner, dragging out the match. This chapter really is looking to be amazing.
---
More maps to possibly use scratched mirror Myers is always welcome in my book
---
Fixated + Sprint Burst + Vigil (Yes, really) + a 4th perk
---
I hope ptb players will tell to change the restriction. I will.
---
Cant control gens when chasing a competent survivor.
---
Pgtw wont force survivors to  stop doing gens and look for totem though but its still nice. Shame I dont have clown myself.
---
I can always yeet anyone with HG, you know. But other person changed my mind on Nancy.
---
didn‚Äôt mean it like that, it‚Äôs just that she kills demogorgon‚Äòs and people. if piggy runs up on her she‚Äôll just snap his neck and suffer from the nosebleed effect.
---
What the fuck? The exhaustion only last 3 seconds when you leave the gen, that means that when you hear the terror radious, you stop working on the gen and when the killer finds you, you will most likely be no longer exhausted... the vaul blocks are in a short range within the repaired gen and it last literally nothing. The one that regresses gens MIGHT be good if it had more than 32 meter radius, while the survivors got 6 perks and all have its uses...
---
Nah mate its so good for trapper and doc, just anyone who wants to 3 gen
---
About Camaraderie:
---
There isnt any Cooldown mentioned, so it could work in three ways.
---
You get a maximum of extra 14 seconds, trash perk
---
You get extra 14 Seconds for EACH Survivor that shows up, maybe usable, well have to see
---
As long as someone visits you every 14 seconds you CANT die in Struggle, Really Good Anti-Camp Perk BUT ONLY IN A SWF, since most Solo Survivors wont play around it, since being honest seems boring.
---
Out of all the perks ill bet Inner Strength and Surge get a lot of use in the meta while Second Wind and Babysitter receive the honor of being used in very specific builds but will be seen pretty rarely. 
---
I wish Demo's power was a little cooler but all in all i think he'll be a solid killer just for setting the mood given how badass it looks. 
---
The map will be the underrated star of this chapter I bet. From what we saw it'll be the first indoor map that will be a fun map for survivors (imo Lery's is a drag and everyone knows how much the Game sucks)
---
Oh you're a _doctor_ main. Okay carry on lol
---
It would be a mindgame if you could actually hear her wooshing in her terror radius and be able to know to make some kind of play to avoid her (you know an actual mindgame). But currently as a spirit player you can just remove your hand from the keyboard and be gifted free downs.
---
Distortion is way better than Wake Up. Distortion is great for solo que in it lets you know what if any aura perks the killer is running
---
Not to bad. Replace Distressing with Ruin and Unnerving with Tinkerer and i'd have called you a parasitic fuck
---
Tuesday is most likely but no, not confirmed yet
---
Thanks, but I don‚Äôt like it when people re-post my art and that‚Äôs that on that. It‚Äôs disrespectful to just disregard that artist when they spend hours making art.. He could have just made that comment on my original post.
---
Imagine the mind games you could do with iron will + Fixated. I hope they make it so it works injured like Urban Evasion.
---
It doesnt.
---
Will this make Iron Maiden useful?
---
Oh shit. U right
---
This made me sad and I'm not even apart of it
---
Oh no Steve and Nancy will meet dbdgonewild too aren't they...
---
NOOOOOOOooooooOooooooOooooooo
---
BRUH, that‚Äôs the point! Don‚Äôt chase them! They‚Äôre just going to waste your time!
---
I think they'd have mentioned if you could hop over stuff. This seems like a charge that has a wider hitbox. Maybe good for closing the gap in straight aways (not that you're in those often) we'll have to see how telegraphed it is and how long it goes. The outlook seems bleak though.
---
Not completely nice, but still pretty nice.
---
thats not a big enough time saver to warrant bringing the perk, It would be best if you could heal while in chase, its not that big of a deal bc you can only use it 2 times
---
I completely understand. In fact, most of us don‚Äôt whine at all. It‚Äôs just a very vocal minority in the community.
---
I just wish this community would play both sides more to understand each other. I have by playing killer a lot this past 2 months and it‚Äôs opened up an entire new perspective. The community could learn a lot by playing both.
---
Its not his lunge, its a power
---
Its not like that but the last time i checked freddy was able to manipulate anyones dreams into almost anything he wanted now i havent seen every episode of stranger things just yet but judging by what ive seen the demogorgon cant do anything it wants it has restrictions
---
Yep. I'm one of them. I'd argue most of them might be a tiny bit sociopathic since Doc's not the strongest killer in the game, nor is he the weakest, but he is definitely without a doubt the most annoying to face.
---
Better together is a strong end game solo survivor perk. it allow you to team up with other survivor to finish the last gen instead of splitting up.
---
But in a sense, i wonder if Bond isn't just better since if you don't see an other survivor in your area it means he's in the other side of the map so you kinda know here survivors are too.
---
Better together + Prove Thy Self= Profit
---
Lmao okay but you fucking scared me
---
Fourth if you count blinks as teleportation
---
Better together is one I will run all the time as someone who loves prove thyself and is in solo cues 99% of the time but obviously it's useless in SWF groups.
---
Distortion needs more tokens I‚Äôd be interested in using it alongside Babysitter
---
&gt; the rat sludge monster from s3
---
it's fucking Cthulhu dude...
---
I rarely get messages. Even as killer. PS4
---
Has it been tested?
---
I disagree. If I'm running a 3-gen build Ruin is of questionable benefit and even if I'm not Ruin often gets cleansed a minute into the game so fucking often I gave up on it,
---
Tinkerer does give an early warning when a gen is about to pop, which makes it decent, but I typically play so defensively the last 3 gens shouldn't be getting anywhere near tinkerer threshold. Tinkerer also kills your terror radius for a bit and with Doctor that's the last thing you want, as this means no passive insanity AOE and no Unnerving Presence.
---
You can't buy them with shards tho. I am not complaining and I am gonna buy it idc how expensive it is but why would you pay 5 bucks for 1 character?
---
Pressure them on a side of the map that has less loops. That way you can still have map pressure.
---
Are Inner Strength and Second Wind one time use only?
---
And how will Surge interact with Pop Goes the Weasel?
---
pretty disappointed with the perks this time around. 3 top tier killer perks and 6 situational or memey survivor perks. dont wanna say i called it but...fuckin called it
---
Feng.
---
The map looks pretty damn epic.
---
These survivor perks are cool, I'm thinking Better together would be a good replacement for Leader, in that others will know which gens to coordinate on
---
Nancy has perks that suit my playstyle more! So Nancy!!
---
Thank you for this post!
---
Ummmmmm
---
Imagine calling someone a dick for asking a repost of there art to be taken down, are you really that dumb to think a credit in the comments do anything?
---
I play both sides but it's like a 70 - 30 deal with survivor and killer for me but, I still know by what I've seen of the perks so far there is no reason to cry over them as a killer because the "OP" perks are situational and I have no issue with that plus killers are getting three good perks too so it's fair in my eyes, and I'm excited to see the survivor meta change
---
I ended up blocking all messages as well as friend requests because I would get requests with salty insults üôÑ. A friend of mine has had some nice people message him but sadly I haven't had the same experience.
---
Actually, demogorgon might be very scary to go against, even by good players.
---
To begin with, if you don‚Äôt cleanse her tunnels, it will have total control/pressure over the map ‚Äî freddy tp but better (very low CD+ not only limited to the generators).
---
If you do, you are 99% will be jumpscared, getting that one juicy first hit. Hearing no terror radius + Demogorgon having M&amp;obuse to disallow other survivors in team to locate it well ‚Äî and you get a killer with true sight of the survivor, and them unable to do anything to see you coming. A jumps-care Myers, but better. 
---
Also, destroying the tunnels creates an alternative objective for survivors, again, making the game last longer, which is in killer‚Äôs favor. 
---
No, that they are injured, you can mindgame them well (remember, still no terror radius and you have their aura revealed). To top it on, you can just the pounce to jump over pallets, windows and down them for good. You might thing that the roar is bad, as it stuns you for a sec or two. But if you land it on the injured survivor (which you will get into the injured state by ambushing with no terror radius), it will be a full down, and that roar will not affect you much, as they are down anyway.
---
I see this as a good killer. Maybe not Nurse, but a solid Myers+ killer. Is it B or A tier is the question, let‚Äôs see how the game goes. My bet is that people will be more likely to run detection perks to counter Demogorgon, and that leads to an opportunity cost of one perk slot. 
---
As for me, having this pressure onto the survivors gameplay and build makes it an A tier killer.
---
P.S. Her power is similar to tinkerer perk, but works when her tunnel is destroyed, and also gives their aura revealed, which is a win on itself. 
---
They can try not cleanse the tunnels, but then the map pressure will by of Hag‚Äôs tier, at least.
---
Well, he wouldnt be destinctable enough from the surviors
---
you do realize TOTH doesn't give you any sound notification if they're cleansing dull totems, right?
---
is he cosplaying as claudette??
---
Ah true true.

Hag, Freddy, Nurse and who else?
---
How tall are you? We must know Monti's height.
---
You have to down people. First thing a person does against a 3 Gen is run as far as possible away from it. And it only works on basic attacks so it's not good for trapper in that situation.
---
Maybe it's a rank thing.  I'm only rank 16 in both killer and survivor.  Though I play on xbox.
---
BbQ distortion corrupt intervention and something else
---
It's a mechanic of the game it's random but some perks will help sway it to pick you or others. Certain perks like it when your obsession.
---
When someone brings decisive. Anyone in the game has equal chance of being the obsession
---
Weird, I always see people mentioning this but I rarely get a message post game weather survivor or killer, win or lose.
---
I can only imagine they had their frail ego hurt on some level due to your play, or they are just a negative miserable person who wants you to join them on their island of conflict and strife.
---
Ooof
---
So you said all of that, to say what I said anyway which is people are going to rank and dis rank regardless, which is unhealthy for the game. If you play the game with the intent of winning each game, you'll end up in the rank you need to be in
---
I got one yesterday on PS4 saying I face camped....like sorry the Lori ran up to you while I was chasing her...
---
Thank you.
---
Absolutely! If these perks remain untouched before the final build, I‚Äôm 110% sure that the killer and/or survivor meta will change. Thursday couldn‚Äôt come any sooner!
---
I literally become a Spirit main today
---
original Freddy was nerfed right after release, Ghostface was announced to have an upcoming nerf a few hours before he was released, and Legion was nerfed after release so hard that he's basically deleted. they even nerfed random things about him that had nothing to do with the complaints survivors had.
---
But Freddy is the most concerning one: he was originally released days before an event that caused a massive influx of new players on Steam. this caused all the new players, who tend to be unreasonably whiny noobs, to constantly go up against Freddy, because existing players were all spamming their new toy. the noobs bitched so hard that they review bombed the game, causing BHVR to give arbitrary nerfs to an already mediocre killer, making him trash.
---
This Stranger Things DLC is almost certainly going to cause a big influx of new players to try the game, while existing players will be using their new killer, as usual. so when the noobs lose their first few games, as expected, they'll be losing to the Demogorgon. so they'll blame the killer for being too strong, throw tantrums, and increase the risk of BHVR nerfing their new killer unnecessarily.
---
You didn't count the time to cleanse a totem, did you?
---
I'm just repeating what otzdarva said when he saw it
---
Art is stolen. Artist requested it be taken down regardless of your credit to them. Take it down. Meme sucks anyway.
---
Distortion if you want to go for stealth. Wake up isnt worth it.
---
Thought the same thing. Might help legion too?
---
I love when i see post like this and then think back to how everyone cried about MOM as soon as it came out
---
Killers without inherent large scale mobility are some of the weakest ones. Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Freddy. They all have great mobility which translates to map pressure. A cool power doesn‚Äôt mean much if you have to walk from one end of red forest to the other to do anything.

Demogorgon

Only get salty if the survivor is taking the piss
---
Quite possibly not, but the Demigorgon emerging through portals is likely something that resonates with the viewers of the show.
---
&gt; call her bluff and run away, thus beating her
---
You mean the second they see you run away they enter phase, follow your scratch marks and sounds, and down you on any structure that isn't a high wall where you can break LoS from her lmao
---
If you want it to be an actual mind game why not make it to where you know when she's phasing while in her terror radius and it allows for both sides to make actual skill based plays as opposed to I stand still and wait for you to commit to a direction. Bonus this allows the devs to rework prayer to make her old spirit.
---
decisive strike.
---
True. But that doesn't change how Steve's perk saves survivors a lot of time. I think that increasing the vulnerability window will be fair.
---
Because this community is unbelievably toxic
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like sprint burst that much
---
I've played for like \~1k hours now and didn't know this could happen. Thanks for explaining, buddy! &lt;3
---
There is a slight chance that you could be the obsession when someone has DS. People seem to think it guarantees that person as the obsession, but it happens.
---
I know I am likely going to main Steve but now I want to level Nancy for her perks. Seriously this is looking like an amazing DLC. I can't wait for the PTB to see how some of the perks will interact with established perks. For example will surge trigger surveillance and/or overcharge. Will botany knowledge effect either of the self heal perks. I plan on getting it day one
---
I think Wake Up is the last perk. You probably didn't want it anyways.
---
You forgot the /s in the end
---
Not going to lie, those are some amazing perks.
---
This killer might be the most balanced killer ever. He has map presure and can end chases faster, but both with skill based counterplay. And thats only without addons. Holly crap as a hag main I got my second main right there.
---
Np.
---
I can piece together so many builds with the addition of some of these perks. Quick and Stealthy, The Alliance, and round out my Protector build.
---
it's a mechanic that devs introduced so the killer won't know who has DS and who doesn't so usually non DS users get to be the obsession so the DS users can be protected somehow and not end up getting slugged instead (you can get a benefit as well since some killers won't tunnel you down if they see that you're the obsession and don't have DS)
---
Xbox is almost as toxic as PC iirc
---
at first I wondered why someone downvoted you. then I noticed that you made up those perks entirely.
---
All 3 killer perks are most certainly not top tier.
---
Oh my, I did not.
---
Here I thought I was some kind of big brain, turns out I‚Äôm a full potato.
---
At least it‚Äôll slow down the totem breaking.
---
Oh ok, its fine.
---
It all depends on how many portals the Demogorgon can place. All you have to do is avoid the portals or intentionally draw the killer away from their portals so someone else can destroy them.
---
I was thinking Bond too actually and it's range is actually bigger than Better Together, but I can see the benefits of each. Overall though, I'd rather have Bond to use during chases, while looking for someone to heal me, while looking for other people who are already doing gens, etc. Rather than Better Together, which only works while you are on a gen and doesn't provide you any benefit besides obviously seeing all survivors when someone gets downed but again a very niche situation requires that.
---
killers can't repair generators
---
I wonder what the demogorgons addons will be
---
You're right!
---
Otz just said he has interest in doing another
---
His power is survivors dc'ing
---
PSA: He can attack while he‚Äôs carrying someone
---
I'm really hyped man lol, I'd also like to point out for any killer complaining locker heal and Steve's passive heal are "OP" first the locker heal makes you vulnerable since the killer can pull you out if they find you and if you hop out you'll just get smacked anyhow and Steve's can be countered by just being found lol. These are balanced perks imo
---
Oh, yeeees.
---
Yeah, matchmaking isnt at its best right now. Doesnt help that swf can get u really high rank survivors
---
I kind of assume that as well which is why I ignore the message and don't respond to any of them.  I'm just curious if there is a reason or if the community is just that miserable.
---
*Oof*
---
How the hell is mindbreaker OP?
---
Except you actually give the unhooked a chance
---
None of these survivor perks make me go "wow that's strong" like old Mettle of Man did. These will likely see no nerfs.
---
Yeah, but that means there must be a solution to this in another place. Not just releasing killers that have high mobility and can get around map fast enough.
---
I want some uniqueness.
---
NOED stands for No One Escapes Dbdgonewild.
---
Ah right. I thought you meant one we already have.
---
Idk about op but it will definitely be strong and I‚Äôm happy for it as a killer cause I know a lot of solo qing survs have issues with cleansing totems or finding people to heal them so now you can be happy to do both
---
I... am... Iron Maiden
---
Wtf is that pinky on monto?
---
Nice stolen meme :)

---
That's not him that's Notzdarva
---
Because DS for whatever stupid reason makes someone else the obsession. I assume it's to "Disguise" who's running DS, but in reality what it really means is even though you're not running an Obsession perk, you get to experience the "joys" of being tombstoned for Dying Light a minute into the match, or Rancor'd right at the exit gate.
---
This is amazing. Plain and simple.
---
I rarely get messages on xbox, as killer or survivor. Most of the ones I get are positive though. Perhaps people are taking offense to your play style? (Not saying there's anything wrong with that you're doing, but some people get upset at certain things)
---
I really hope the two healing perks don't get nerfed
---
I agree.
---
Can someone tell me if surge works with PGTW in the ptb?
---
I know. The lunge of his pounce is pretty good.
---
Hab heute auf der Gamescom aber noch Monto getroffen üòÇü•≥üëç
---
Some content creators have a history of over valuing perks. Some people still think thrilling tremors is a strong perk.
---
Plus it takes a perk slot that could be something like I don't know, self care?
---
RIP bamboozle?
---
For survivor perks, I'm guessing second wind + deliverance could be interesting.  
---
Also, hiding in lockers to heal in 8 seconds?  Wow...and seeing your own scratch marks is kinda interesting.
---
Edit:  the demogorgon perks all seem potentially good.  
---
I wonder if the bonus walking speed for fixated also works with urban evasion.
---
Wait you can only place two? I somehow missed that
---
Hes talking about the survivors that complain every game as if losing is never their fault and say camping tunneler and slugger every game. Basically the cucks
---
On stream they said it's single use only
---
Grown up Dart skin tho
---
The devs keep it a surprise in the PTB. It‚Äôs almost like these newcomers don‚Äôt understand DbD customs yet? It‚Äôs a shame really.
---
considering some survivors try to gen rush so hard they don't even heal themselves yeah. Its gonna be painful for a lot of survivor who follow the ‚Äúonly do gens‚Äù way of thinking to do something besides fondle gens. Even if it prevents a killer from literally bursting out of the ground on top of them.
---
Sorry if I am being dense but can the demogorgon have more than two portals on the map at any given time? The wording makes it sound like it is the case though all the videos only seemed to show 2 portals on a map at a time. If it is more than two spots how many are we seeing on the PTB and will they work like Hag or Freddy where the last one vanishes if you go to create another one beyond your limit?
---
All 3 killer perks are aids lol
---
Ok DAS ist cool
---
Adrenaline ignores exhaustion either way, no?
---
Survivors look great. Killer looks really underwhelming (to me at least)
---
Well DS is a second-chance perk yes.. You don't get hooked, but still ignore a hit, therefore it does in fact apply to that definition IMO.
---
sTaY iN yOuR sURVivOR bUbBlE. Yeah, FYI I play a shitton of killer as well, and get my killer rank to red ranks every single season, so I think I kinda know what I'm talking about.
---
By uncomfortable I mean you instantly get grabbed and hooked, and not only that, your moaning inside of that locker can be heard from miles away.
---
Anyways, you're right, I wish there was a perk that would counter inner strength, I would imagine that perk like this, I hope BHVR will add it! :)
---
 You open [Lockers](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lockers) üì∑ **30**/**40**/**50**¬†% faster.
---
Survivors who exit Lockers suffer from the [***Exposed***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Exposed) ***üì∑*** **Status Effect** for **15 seconds** and their location is revealed for **3 seconds**.
---
Would be a cool addition to the game, don't you think?
---
sTaY iN yOUR KilLEr mAiN bUbbLE friend :)
---
5 mins? Lol that‚Äôs way too generous
---
Wraith with the blood symbol add on.
---
He can place more than 2 portals but okay
---
sksksk and i oop and i oop
---
iron maiden also just got buffed.
---
And this Negan guy is supposed to have a baseball bat.
---
Calling your opponents kid makes me automatically assume you're the asshole.
---
You right 0-0
---
Same..
---
I wonder if it works with overcharge, I'm asking for a friend of course.
---
Sony fixing the community, one person at a time.  Attaboy.  
---
Also props to actually reforming.  Most people just do the same shit again.
---
It should be able to break pallets with that lunge
---
Steve‚Äôs is the one that confuses me the most. He‚Äôs in the broken state so getting the passive heal to work is a risk/reward situation. Seems pretty balanced to me
---
Well then it's absolute trash. 14 extra seconds in tier 2 is not worth an entire perk slot. I'd rather run adrenaline.
---
He would be Freddy 1.0
---
Yea... yeaaaa.
---
This is news to me
---
Dude, I am fucking H Y P E D for the scratch mark perk. Second wind and inner strength seem pretty nice too.
---
Ja er war richtig nett und gechillt drauf ü•≥
---
Definitely is but, in the end I hope the survivors keep these perks and I really really hope they don't nerf the Demogorgon cause I saw people saying it was too OP already
---
I dont care ... i want a Sleepaway camp dlc !
---
if this perk becomes particularly meta, iron maiden, which already wasnt really that bad of a perk, it was just so niche, is suddenly going to see a lot more play
---
Is it just me, or do most of these perks seem incredibly OP?
---
And your crouching speed is same as walking speed(level 3 urban evasion).
---
Welp, now is a good time for me to redownload and farm some BP. Interested to see killer gameplay.
---
Thats not a shitpost its a Rant.
---
It's another anti-camping perk. I think it works well especially in end game when the killer is camping the hooked survivor and the rest have more time to unhook him
---
To anyone saying Demogorgon seems bad: they did say that they will be changing things over time, since the ptb is coming and the DLC won't be out for a while yet.  Hopefully they'll make it quite nice for release, I quite like it's brand of teleportation.
---
It seems worse than Self Care especially if the game is long.
---
Did they confirm they will be doing cosmetics for them?
---
High quality
---
Indubitably
---
That would be a good tweak
---
But it's CROUCHING. A different mechanic, animation, button... Why is it so hard to understand
---
Yes and they also said Netflix gave them ideas for the demigorgan
---
all three of the demogorgon perks are at the very least okay, surge, and his exhaustion perk are both crazy good.
---
If you are near the gens they can‚Äôt heal anyway.
---
Thanks!
---
Nice:)
---
It seems decent, though it does take painfully long.
---
Though i'd say maybe the portals create "hubs" to the upside down (akin to how they said cleansing it hides the killer terror radius), these hubs creative a visual effect and sound effect (obviously like the upside down) and hide the terror radius, can extend the range and effects with addons.
---
Cruel Confinement is A- B+, Surge is B+ or B- depending on whether it works with pop, and Mindbreaker is a memey C+ tier perk imo
---
Cameraderie is a double edged sword. Maybe if the killer is paying attention he could see the progression stops before struggle and can tell when a survivor is near by, say the survivor is hooked in the basement and that gives the killer enough time to skadoot over there.
---
That's two whole perk slots for a slightly safer unhook. Doesn't seem ideal honestly.
---
Wait for PTB instead of making assumptions.
---
Spirit is better than Billy with add-ons. And a good spirit player is very frustrating to play against.
---
No, because the upside-down is a different dimension, it's not a surv who's sleeping. It would have been cool if another surv should have gone in the upside to save his mate
---
It says it goes 100% walking speed, so if you increase walking speed will it still be 100% walking speed?
---
they did a good job on both of them
---
I can totally see it in an altruistic distractor build. Heal or unhook+heal someone, distract killer, lose chase eventually, get rescued and run off to gen. Heal while working on it, go distract again.
---
Im not sure about the "never happening" escaping the chase, I often see higher ranking killers drop the chase if it takes them to jungle gym or away from the place they want to be.
---
Great thanks for your input I guess
---
Yes...that's the joke. People joke around about how like when Freddy was released he was garbage, so some will make up new perks that are unrealistically bad as a joke. 
---
If anyone honestly thinks that this is real then holy fuck they are dumb.
---
EDIT: I deleted it now. Someone actually read "when you sabotage a hook you get hemorrage" and thought that was real. My god, how dumb are people....
---
Yes, they‚Äôve been saying it‚Äôs too strong when  it‚Äôs literally a single self heal per match that you could‚Äôve just got from a teammate. It‚Äôs pretty fucking useless in SwF but is a good perk for solo q, which is shit. Solo q has it much worse then killer or SwF so they should suck it up honestly
---
I'm surprised you didnt get morried!
---
*And you just equipped Deliverance
---
You're my hero. Toying around with these things fixed it. After 500+ hours of DBD, we're finally unchained.
---
*Insert Freddy 1.0  D A R N  here*
---
True also. But those people usually aren‚Äôt injured when a chase is dropped.
---
It‚Äôs honestly stupid with how if you think about it, survivors can kill themselves on first hook and you‚Äôll DERANK?! Because the emblem malicious requires multiple hook actions, which for some reason doesn‚Äôt count hook stages when the survivor has been on the hook the whole time, it‚Äôs really stupid
---
It's a nice park but I would definitely be careful when The Killers running something like make your choice the last thing you probably won't is a beacon telling them who and where you are
---
Omg can‚Äôt wait to abuse Fixated
---
More than likely.
---
When there are SIX new perks for survivors that's actually a pretty bad ratio.
---
EDIT: And realistically the only new survivor perk I can see making it into high rank meta is Camaraderie and MAYBE Fixated, but that's a hard maybe.
---
All of these perks are incredible without being too OP or UP. Gg devs.
---
Or just say nothing since you don't even have a lobby chat.
---
Now I wonder what the bloodweb changes are with this chapter, since they introduced 9 perks.
---
Jojo?
---
Depends on how will they implement those 20 seconds. If it gets reset when killer comes close, thats maybe a too big drawback but can still be okay. If it only gets paused, I want more.
---
self care is slow and I don't play Claud so I stopped leveling her at 35 for botany knowledge and empathy. It's just so slow I'd rather stay injured until I found another way to heal.
---
This is the real reason why they needed dedicated servers tbh.
---
Very true, but I rack da internet points soü§ëü§ë
---
You made a meme, it's gonna be used. As an artist this shouldn't be surprising.
---
thats not enough though
---
Steve is **perfectly** like his actor, or as close as you can get.
---
Nancy is a teeny bit off, but is really close
---
Uhhhhhhhhhh Bill
---
So its basically hag with mince rag and you have to stand on a portal to teleport. I still like him though, it looks so epic and its roar is so cool. Im good with hag so i might be good with that one too CANT WAIT
---
I think Surge is slightly better than Cruel Confinement depending on the situation.
---
&gt; Levels 40-49: Three perks appear, up to two can be purchased. 
---
&gt; Level 50: Four perks appear, up to two can be purchased. 
---
HELL YA
---
Best perk description I've read in like forever.
---
Thank you very much, happy you like them!! And yes it was, he is a very cool guy and he hung around for quite some time with our group of cosplayers
---
He could have the survivor on their knees, and whack them.
---
Nurse or billy with iron maiden
---
Honestly, Inner Strength is pretty garbo. You often get healed by others or heal yourself with a medkit in the same amount of time or even less. I find Second Wind much better, as you can be doing a gen while healing, but yeah, no Wow-material.
---
Both those killer perks make an obsession regardless of if any survivors had obsession perks on anyway
---
Yep, I'm the op, made it in like 10 seconds in Gmod. I think this was made around the time that Legion first came out, and were weak as fuck.
---
Crybaby killer mains:
---
OP killer perks: I sleep
---
An decent survivor perk: REAL SHIT!?!
---
Her perks sound fine, the Demogorgon perks can disrupt entire AREAS of the map, they are gonna heavily benefit players who attempt the 3 gen strat... They are insane, but yeah, complain about a perk that encourages popping totems. Makes sense...
---
Goodbye hex perks. Was nice knowing you (haunted grounds could be more useful though). Killers should be happy they are getting more amazing perks that allow them disrupt and extend the game without it being a hex (that has a chance of being destroyed instantly). Having a survivor perk that rewards popping totems is a fair trade for that imo.
---
Well maybe the entity trained him with cookies
---
Head on just got buffed or at least fixed. MOM was giving people free hits for free, decisive was giving people free escapes for nothing, double pallets were horrendous, and exhaustion was the least unbalanced I dont even get why they changed it but still. You cant objectively say that some of the early survivor tools were balanced at all.
---
&gt;instead of just climbing over the obstacles?
---
It is the Entity's realm. It decides what is possible to do and what not :)
---
Kinda late to the party
---
Oh and don't get me started on how survivors have complained LOUDLY as hell about Nurse the best killer in the game since her inception and she's just now about to get looked at 3 years later.
---
She survived the onslaught of her village.
---
Checkmate. ü§£
---
lmao the salt from survivor and smartass players this thread.
---
What perks are worth nerfing?
---
None of them seem meta changing like old Mettle of Man did.
---
It's actually five times at most. I read that it's tied to totem cleanses
---
Steve. His perks are a little more my style. Plus, the hair. The hair my dude.
---
Didnt even notice lmao
---
Not all killers became killers willingly. They've stated that many times before.
---
The obsession is picked at random but some perks invrese the chance or make you the obsession on use
---
Jake mains shouldn‚Äôt be dickheads like this. Change your flair to Nea or P3 Claudette buddy
---
Wait how's that bullying? Not implying bullying doesn't happen but in this instance they were just trying to use the mechanic of the game? Granted they dc'd but that's probably because they were mad the pallet drop didn't work. And also not justifying him quitting.
---
Ahaha, sure, unfair enough.
---
I would say that asking an actor to do a voiceover is much more difficult (and costly), rather than just getting the rights to model a face without actors' direct involvment.
---
This perk isnt even good
---
I can't tell you how many times I pop 4 totems and still get killed by NOED at the end of a match, all because my 3 teammates couldn't pop ONE totem.
---
Having better non-hex killer perks and a perk that rewards doing totems is good. We need more shit like this. Killers shouldn't be relying on NOED or Ruin to win/extend the match, but they do. New perks that disrupt and extend the game that aren't hex totems is great. A perk that rewards popping totems is a good trade off for that.
---
Killers are really gonna REALLY feel the risk of using hex perks now, which is good. No more will I see fellow survivors stupidly run past dull totems thinking they are not a threat.
---
I thought it fed off of all emotions, fear and hope
---
I think the game is just too basic at a fundamental level to go that far. Killers have all of five actions they perform. Walk, kick, vault, swing and lunge. Strong power with low mobility makes a Leatherface. Strong power with strong mobility makes Spirit. Killers like Doctor Wraith and Amanda walk that line but ultimately are hindered in chases where they don‚Äôt have a tool to assist in a chase without being bloated in their kit. 
---
Idk man. It‚Äôs hard.
---
Well it only works if the survivors have the Perk right ?
---
1.His base is more than 2 portals, I saw 2 light up while standing on a portal.
---
2.It does take way too long
---
3.It doesn‚Äôt need a flashlight but it does take time and (maybe) skillchecks (Nancy kept jumping back while on the portal and kept pulsing with light maybe signifying skill check fail) but the Hud was off. Ontop of that they said the portals notify you when Survivors are near by.
---
I think portals are fine (minus the teleport speed) what needs to be tweaked it the lunge. You cant steer it.
---
I guess? Doesnt seem like a huge issue.
---
+ hag. Billy probably looked the same
---
This will go down as one of the best things this community has ever created.
---
*Oink*
---
Truly take a good look at the current meta, and think if these perks are literally stronger than them. If anything, they might REACH the meta, but no way they‚Äôre exceeding it.
---
Wat.
---
I expect $15. Will be shocked if it's $10 or $20.
---
These look totally awesome. The perks tie in pretty well (especially the Demogorgons). Im 
---
still amazed they secured such a hot license, Stranger Things is pretty much a pop culture phenomenon so hopefully this brings in a, ahem, Surge of new players.
---
I liked the power :(
---
That is why self care needs a nerf for perk like these can gain more play
---
A two way portal that can be destroyed and a chargeable lunge? Seems like a shittier Freddy x Pig
---
Iron Will is a counter for BOTH Spirit and Nurse
---
AND, in an appropiated map, Fixated ALSO counters Nurse.
---
Being honest, that, and maaaaaybe Dead Hard, is everything you need.  
---
Right now you can make this with Urban Evasion instead of Fixated, and being honest, it just works.  
---
The  truth is, any other killer, you dont need Perks, you actually dont, you just loop them. And with two perks you counter the God Tier Killers, and being honest thats enough for Low Ranks, everything else is optional
---
Do *you* even watch his content?
---
Her face looks like it was made in ms paint
---
Hillbilly or doctor
---
Voices are included in a characters likeness IIRC. If you get full likeness you get voices, whether they be pre recorded (from the TV show) or them recording custom lines
---
I could be wrong but this is what I recall researching when Ash got announced
---
If even one survivor has the perk it‚Äôs enough. I mean, 5 free heals just for me : )
---
I used to run a lot of premonition. Try that. It definitely has limitations tho. Requires you to cycle your view like if you were scanning for a Michael but when it goes off you know which way they're coming from.
---
Inner strength will become popular. Almost a better self care
---
...shit, that makes sense.
---
Missing the point.
---
Nipple rings
---
And you do realise if you put these opinions into a text only post it goes nowhere and won‚Äôt spark any discussion at all aswell as get a point across so that‚Äôs why I do that in posts
---
No one really know yet. I sure we will find out soon.
---
You have the option to see survivors when they:
---
* Heal
---
* Work on Gens
---
* Finish a Gen
---
* Hook a survivor
---
* Within a certain radius
---
Not to mention they've nerfed Decisive Strike and decreased stun times in certain areas and most importantly you can kill us. The only major complaint from survivors is tunneling and camping with the former seeming to be addressed. So stop whining.
---
Why would it negate overcharge. Two mediocre perks which could be fun to play? Pop or Lullaby are a better pairing with Overcharge anyways.
---
They said one that it feeds out of hope but in a dev vid they said that it feeds off all emotions.
---
1. Yes, I think the devs mentioned it being a kind of tug of war
---
2. Looks like about 5-10 seconds
---
3. Not seen
---
4. Takes about 5 seconds to burrow in then moves at Nurse blink speed towards the exit
---
Return the Slaaaaaaab!
---
Watching the stream it seems like it has a longer hitbox then the animation would imply. But yeah I totally agree the devs are way too obsessed with making killers clunky and slow for no reason. Freddy's rework power doesn't slow him down when he casts it and guess what... It didn't break the game. Hes still just a solid midtier.
---
Nah Surge kinda sucks.
---
Makes you unable to apply Pop to any of the gens near you.
---
You'd need to apply the explosion to 2-3 gens to make it worth missing out on Pop.
---
I'm just putting out a number but survivors bitch more than killers 100 percent. Sprint burst, adrenaline, lithe, balanced, urban, dead hard, decisive, unbreakable, borrowed, bond/empathy, self care, quick and quiet, and I can even put on we'll make it. Killers got ruin, bbq, enduring, spirit fury, brutal, haunted, and pop.
---
I'm not following. What are they going to do?
---
Not gonna lie here, but Quentin‚Äôs actor is kind of a good looking guy. I know they didn‚Äôt get his likeness, but it makes it all the more funny that what we got looks like a cross between Gollum and Quasimodo.
---
Steve's hair: When being chased, the killer becomes blinded whenever your hair is on screen. When being picked up by the killer, the entity is angered, and instantly completes 3/4/5 generators
---
Same.  I dont know why people are hyped for these perks. They dont look that good to me.
---
Hooooooly fuck these perks are awesome.
---
That actually does seem too powerful. But we will see because you aren‚Äôt going to get more than 1 use out of it unless you‚Äôre lucky. People will cleanse totems much more now and won‚Äôt leave you any. And you can waste time looking for totems for a heal instead of a teammate. Still I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be nearly as good as people are making it out to be
---
Hand drawn with Paint Tool SAI. Honoured that you'd think it looks close to rendered!
---
I know but Im tired of seeing low effort posts like that
---
A young Billy though would be nice and a pic of the room they kept him in
---
OTP
---
My precious...
---
Missing the point, read it again please.
---
Also, no need to defend it, I'm only pointing out a serious flaw IMO. Like it or not, it doesn't make sense mate.
---
I mean, when you think about it yeah. Pretty spot on comparison. Which is fine by me because Reksai is dope.
---
How is this horror movie
---
No, surge regresses gens and gens cannot be be kicked while regressing.
---
But how will I make a +15 weapon without a Slab?
---
I'll run Bitter Murmur+Cruel Confinement+Tinkerer just to scare the shit out of people.
---
spirit
---
Kill em with the hammer, Bubba. They die better that way.
---
Billy will look similar. His parents locked him away for being deformed. So that's why he became a killer.
---
32 meters isn't that bad
---
I want to play Michael but the higher I get in ranks the harder it is. And I'm not new to him, even though I came back few weeks ago after a little pause, I played Michael as my main killer since his release until I left DbD for a while. I'm back to purple ranks, but I struggle to get even 2k against full SWF stack with him.
---
Was this a spoiler of monto making another huntress video?, nice cosplay tho
---
Well it‚Äôs not like people are gonna change any time soon and take the time to read something like that and until that happens these posts will always pop up so there‚Äôs no point in getting angry at the inevitable
---
I feel dumb but cheated tbh, if I don‚Äôt run iron will it‚Äôs a rigged coin toss

"The old way, with a sledge! It's better, they die better that way."
---
Actually I am. I was one of the original Save the World founders before BR was a thought stain on the floor.  Because I have kids older than you and back a PVE game because they thought about a BR game, I'm suppose to be some screaming child because a reddit i am a part of?
---
I think Unbreakable would work better instead of Adren.
---
You can't understand how sad am I to annoy you. I'm literally crying. Now, seriously, dude get a life, it's just a way of saying and there's no reason to get so upset.
---
How come you can‚Äôt access it
---
u/Tymerc you were right!
---
Happy to help!
---
Tunneling, camping, slugging, bamboozle, noed, ruin, putting traps at doors, downing survivors when some dumbass runs in for the save the minute someone's hooked even though that's their fault, nurse, billy, spirit, legion, windstorm wraith, myers with tuft, any form of mori, and taking advantage of a three gen situation have all been complained about to me personally. Need I say fucking more. Killers dont want tbagging, clicking, and infinites.
---
Wait, it isn't a 1 time use ?
---
Use demon or twinkling titanite?
---
Gotta love people urban evasioning over to you from across the map and stopping every 5 seconds to carefully examine every single pixel when the killer is already in another chase.
---
Maybe he will be like ghostface where he is  underwhelming during the PTB but is better at launch
---
That was a bad attempt at trolling unless you‚Äôre a yellow rank killer lol
---
Poor bb killer. Hope you didnt teabag her
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
u know what a fact means? opinions are not facts, and if they were, people who put clown on high tier on their tier list means that is a fact because thats his opinion?
---
Without being as good as borrowed time *
---
There isn‚Äôt really a point in using baby sitter over borrowed time, plus borrowed time should be annoying to punish tunneling like it‚Äôs intended to
---
Self Care makes you waste a lot of time. The time Inner Strength saves you will benefit you more in the long run.
---
Creating tedious game mechanics just for the sake of it is bad game design. 
---
Same reason I‚Äôve macro‚Äôed wiggle and struggle.
---
Which character uses it cause same, ill use it
---
Did they say how many holes we can put down with the demogorgon?
---
Close your application, you can‚Äôt prevent it but you can stop it when it does happen
---
What are u saying. I'm rank 5 killer and rank 4 survivor and these are the perks I see the most you clown.
---
That‚Äôs bs, that‚Äôs a pretty good render of her. Still have her puppy dog eyes which is one of her most notable features
---
"dEcIsIvE oP"  
---
   
---
-people who think they don't tunnel but they really are tunneling.
---
i disagree. personally i think there is only 1 killer one worth using and 5 survivor ones i would try
---
So if undetectable gives the smokey screen (like Cloaked Wraith I think, Insidious, Crouched Pig, etc.) will this mean Insidious will also be given Undetectable's other effects like no aura, etc?
---
If it does, it's a flat-out buff to insidious facecamping, because now Kindred will no longer work.
---
but thats the opposit of cold they are all way too hot
---
Nancy simply because I like maining females but since I started watching the series her character has grown on me
---
I‚Äôll have to try to get bond for sure.  Thanks!
---
Sure thing! But I wouldn't be surprised if they skipped over this critical fact all together -- how would you piece it together to make sense? I'm curious.
---
Not a fan of the thought that a survivor could use decisive strike and inner strength. When Survivors have decisive strike active, they basically have godmode which leads to them making really dumb plays. The fact that the killer will get punished for leaving or opening the locker is a bit worrying to me.
---
None of the killer's perks are worth a perk slot either. Ruin is a must and will continue to be so in the upcoming patch, BBQ because bloodpoints, Enduring + Spirit Fury for M1 killers, replace Spirit Fury with PGTW for mobile killers.
---
I'm just saying streamers and youtubers aren't the be all end all on what's good in a game.
---
Is he literally crying about a fucking meme? Grown up, kid.
---
And there's the NOED complaint. You people aren't going to stop until that perk gets deleted. I'm glad you aren't developing the game, and I don't even use it. Complaining about the power rule being powerful is why people make fun of this community.
---
‚ÄúJust in case...‚Äù
---
The luck! Wow!
---
RIP Mews ;(
---
most people didn't notice
---
God I wish it was the pigs lunge. Then it would only be bad and not awful.
---
Right? It's honestly not that bad.
---
In walks the 3 new Demogorgon perks...
---
I AM YOUR GOD NOW!!! 
---
Honestly, having killers not rely on hex perks and giving us a perk that encourages totem popping. This is all amazing. The meta is shifting, hex totems will be FAR riskier but there will be new non hex perks that can apply pressure and disrupt the game to compensate for that.
---
I honestly think this is good. Hex totems should be a risk to use, and now killers are really gonna feel the risk because survivors are gonna be going totem hunting. RIP NOED.
---
Some pea brain stayed behind to taunt me a messed up and got killed then messaged me on Xbox that I sucked and point out that I was rank 20 (just got game on game pass)
---
Dude killer mains have the biggest brain farts sometimes
---
Yeah idk about iron maiden countering it. You need to be right there to use it. Inner strength definitely isn't OP, but it's a good perk. Killer don't have a super great way to counter it though.
---
A few at least seem usable and fun instead of being troll perks like Head on.
---
Surge + Ruin
---
Longest matches ever
---
If said totem counter is tied to a perk, yes. As a general UI addition? No. Survivors get enough information as it is.
---
As it was said, we had hooks tied to killers before. And it was removed. Because element of surprise is important for killers, especially stealth ones and Myers.
---
Me first: you talking about legion?
---
After reading the comments me: Oh...
---
lol sure you are. Checked your post history you just cry about survivors day in day out, we‚Äôre done here. Just git gud
---
More conditional self care with a max number of uses per game (i.e.: multiple people running it makes it worse for everyone) and it's ultimately slower than a medkit. No thanks.
---
I'm frankly shocked they scored the license. Stranger Things is a genuine pop culture phenomenon and a total cash cow for Netflix. I'm think the Duffer Brothers might personally be fans of the game.
---
Nurse's "blinks" are technically dashes for all means and purposes
---
Pop goes the weasel, surge, ruin, overcharge.
---
Empathy? OP? The fuck?!
---
*Piano music intensifies*
---
Not only me but the status effect tho is right
---
XD hahaha , okay I will leave
---
Darn survivors and their OP perks like quick and quiet and bond !! Stupid devs only catering to survivor mains /s
---
Dark Souls arguments in the DbD subreddit ? Tf is happening
---
Oh lmao what‚Äôs up mate. Do we report or just downvote?
---
Hahahaha. Had a really rough day, so thank you kind stranger for giving me a much needed laugh.
---
Is the smoky screen effect going to obscure the killer‚Äôs vision?  Because I really don‚Äôt think most stealth killers need a nerf.
---
Crouch jump attack right
---
The entity controls them. Your "point" is completely refuted by literally everything the devs have said about lore regarding the entity.
---
Here we have a guy named ‚ÄòNintendoLover‚Äô, who‚Äôs pointing out things that are normie Tier. Ironic.
---
No, you are right. It's a one time use per match.
---
Witch hunting isn't cool.
---
But I gotta say this gotta be the first time I've seen someone complain about Quick and Quiet of all things.
---
I think map coverage is going to become a lot more popular in future designs. Most of the bad killers are bad because they can't pressure gens quickly... Look at the top three killers. All of them can cover ground quickly. The devs are clearly aware of this issue. Freddy and now Demogorgan have something that lets them traverse the map. 
---
I think we will see a lot more kits like this, some power that helps in chase and another side power that helps travel the map.
---
Probably because it helps you see EXACTLY where your scratch marks are going, making more natural Mind Games in Breaking CHase Points; these usually dont work because of two things:
---
‚ÄîSometimes you run a milisecond more than you should of, and Scratch Marks are in such a way that reveals your intents in a very obvious manner. You can now watch for that and take the better choice
---
‚ÄîYou cant get away fast enough to actually trick the killer, the closest thing you can do is to use Urban Evasion, since yeah, its the same as Walking Speed at Tier 3, but the objective (That means, you) can crouch trough some low "walls" like the trash outside the Asylum in such a way that it confuses the killer
---
This perks fix both thingsI want to try this:Iron WillFixatedUrban Evasion (For when Im injured and Fixated doesnt give extra speed)And then a rotation of: Spine Chill (So I can escape early on and know where they are looking at while behind a wall), Self-Care (Not really a good idea, but sometimes I want to heal myself, probably the lest one used on the rotation), Adrenaline (For the Endgame), ~~Second Wind (Self-Care without wasting time)~~ and Sprint Burst (So you can run when the Mind game doesnt work)
---
Edit: I realized Second Wind didnt work as I thought it worked, so dont mind me
---
A good compliment to your teammate‚Äôs borrowed time. If the killer has a small or deactivated terror radius, second wind will kick in. If not, borrowed time may activate. It doesn‚Äôt cover all scenarios (like the terror radius being introduced shortly after unhooking) but it is nice
---
Yeah but I don't think his point is invalid. His issue isn't that NOED exists or that cleansing totems is hard, it's that you have no way of knowing if you've actually gotten rid of NOED. 
---
Every player cleansing every totem they come across doesn't guarantee that they'll come across every totem. And that's his point. This perk doesn't make it easier to tell how many totems are remaining, which is always the big issue. For as often as people complain about NOED, I feel like more of the complaints are targeted toward knowing whether the killer has it or not and less that you have to be "inconvenienced" by searching for the totem.
---
I don't know if I'm on board with this DLC. 
---
Perks are one of the biggest things about dbd in terms of gameplay and variety. If I don't buy this DLC I feel like I'm missing out. I'm not sure if I wanna support it...
---
Who the hell are you
---
I get it, they're at least trying something for the bloodweb. But unfortunately I look at this and see the following:
---
"We can't solve this problem now, let's delay worrying about it. It's a problem for future BHVR".
---
I'll agree, it will cut down the current grind. It accomplishes that very well. But it just means in another few years down the line we'll be back in this situation. I guess they could technically just keep adding more and more perks available per bloodweb but it just seems like an inelegant long term solution.
---
It's definitely the backgrounds, they have a mesh-looking quality to them
---
Mindbreaker seems a bit op imo, but idk we will have to see I guess
---
They showed in today‚Äôs stream the killer having 3 down at once so idk where OP‚Äôs getting the idea you can only put 2 down from
---
You're a fucking moron if you think these perks are bad. And anything that changes up the meta (by adding iron maiden) is a good thing. Or do yo uh like BBQ/Ruin/Nurse's every game?
---
Nah, it's alright, as long as more people get to see the absolute beauty that is Legion holding a rocket launcher i'm cool.
---
It looks to me like he'll be a bit weak, mostly since you cant teleport without standing on another portal. so that will drain too much of his time and pressure since he'll have to detour to use his power, which already required him to set at least two portals at distant areas of the level to begin with. Now, if he was able to teleport to a portal he set without that, it would work. but as is, yeah he looks mid tier at best. I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it. 
---
The lunge power looks cool, but probably decent survivors will dodge it since it telegraphs too easily. kind of like Pig's dash, sure you could use it in a chase, but so rarely that it never happens. 
---
His perks look good though. so that at least solves the Ghostface problem.
---
Not really a teleport
---
(We did a pretty good job so far)^-1
---
Really? I feel like Mindbreaker is the weakest of the 3
---
The Entity controls them??? What, like mind control?
---
They‚Äôre gonna be Rank 20 with the rest of the noobies so it won‚Äôt be as bad as you‚Äôre saying. But we absolutely need a new megathread for killer and survivor gameplay tips though. Getting past brown ranks is when the real fuckery starts.
---
DBD-&gt;Courage the Cowardly Dog-&gt;Dark Souls....
---
We're all mad here in this subreddit lol
---
Why not Both? Fixated doesnt work while injured :3
---
But you're pretty safe inside of a locker. Especially good vs Doctor and Nurse's calling.
---
Buying it day one as a DBD and a ST fan.
---
This post makes me sad that Robin isn't in it instead of Nancy though. :(
---
They need to up the numbers for babysitter imo
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu39az/what_do_u_think_about_inner_strenghtquic_and/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Except you can cleanse the totem before you are injured. Cleansing totems helps your team, so you're not losing any time there. Then, you just take 8 seconds to heal yourself, which is a lot faster than self-care can. The only true downside is that it only works once per match, but it's still quite viable if you don't suck and get hit all the time.
---
I feel like camaraderie needs a sort of buff though
---
The issue is if a killer can't quickly rotate from one thing to the next and pressure gens they just get gen rushed. The only other way to get around this is give the killer the ability to end chases very quickly, but the best way to do that in a looping/chase meta is.... to give them more mobility...
---
Until the killer is running Discordance.
---
Demongorgon
---
What's with DbD players loving Dark Souls or the other way around lmao? I always look at people's Steam profiles and it's like their favorite 4 games are all three Dark Souls and then Dead by Daylight hahaha
---
Because they're different, and if this community stopped for a second and tried being creative for once there could be some fun builds out there. But I'm sure folks will stick to the same tired builds like they always do.
---
Maybe there is a wraith and she has spine chill
---
yeah but what IF your like on 3% on the hook and someone is coming to save you and camaraderie saves you.
---
nope it activates each time
---
Killer main here. I hate everything about survivors and even I think all of those perks are great. Anyone who complains about them should uninstall, I want to see the meta shift to something different.
---
^^hey ^^check ^^the ^^background
---
*insert Undead Merchant Nee hee hee hee*
---
Ive been waiting to see my own scratch marks since I started playing. Definetly using that perk.
---
Christmas lights or a flower pot.
---
ohhh, u think i mean that ive just found out steve and nancy are coming to the game. no i meant that steve and nancy season 3 characters are coming to the game, so there‚Äôs more chance of steve scoops ahoy outfit being available as a cosmetic
---
It takes some time to get better, watch a good streamer or YouTuber play killer you might something up. I play killer and it took awhile to get good for me but I'm red ranks now and all it took was a better understanding of loops and perks and such
---
Lmfao. Every time I can 4k I let the best player on the team go. I only go sweaty when survivors go sweaty and same for when I'm survivor. I never camp and always fresh hook as if these are rules I should follow that just some entitled dickheads made up. I didnt get rank 5 by accident I've worked for it so I'm not bad. And how could I be lying when these are the same complaints you will literally always hear lol. They arent all made up there are people out there that are cucks and complain about everything.
---
I hated season 2 and I hate Dustin. Just couldn't get into the show.
---
Don't even try to argue with these rank 20s arrogant scums. They obviously don't understand the game to argue that you must lose ages looking for totems, so their opinions are irrelevant. Mate, do yourself a favour, don't try to convince these apes, cuz you'll only get downvotes. I know that ain't much, but i upvoted all your comments to balance what these arrogant animals did.
---
Watch it, it's first season is amazing, genuinely nail-biting scary goodness because it's all new and unknown.
---
She's possessed by the Mind Flayer
---
Inner Strenght counters any anti-heal perk and addons though. No nurses, no mangled, no nothing
---
At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard super often so I believe it‚Äôs accurate haha. And I know right? Would be a bit creepy if she just casually stole them from one of her victims. üòÇ No but for real she has braces of her own and I believe that‚Äôs where the inspo for the mask came from!
---
Cruel Confinement will be good vs survivors that play more aggro and are willing to finish a gen in a killers face if it means finishing a gen. I expect it to be a decent pickup in higher ranks as a upper mid tier perk.
---
I like aftercare, windows of opportunity, and dance with me, but I agree with you on all the others. Head on is fun to use though
---
You mean decisive, second wind, dead hard, adrenaline, instaheal into tea bag
---
Now I kind wish they would buff it for that one reason lol
---
the only good perk in here seems to be surge,
---
mindbreaker will only effect exhaution perks so it's situational
---
I jumped back on Destiny 2....
---
Maybe if you're facing a Billy or a huntress.
---
Legion
---
Mindbreaker is going to be a doozy.
---
Wait, so your argument is both that everyone else will cleanse all the totems before you can cleanse one, and also that nobody is gonna put themselves in danger to cleanse a totem?
---
What?
---
Oh, okay.  Thanks for clearing that up, that effect is just not what comes to my mind when I think of the word ‚Äúsmokey‚Äù.
---
Unbreakable is way more situational IMO&lt; a free heal during a chase plus speedboost is chase ending
---
It's true. I took a bit of a break from dead by daylight end only played about 15 or so matches but oh well. Could have been worse I guess
---
that's what makes it amazing.
---
What part of major complaint did you not understand? And even tunneling isn't bad as far as I'm concerned. I'm not talking about poor choices noobs/SWF carry-ons  make because they don't know any better in the heat of the moment.
---
My point, which you missed, was that as a killer you have one job where the developers have given you many advantages to do and we can't stop that if you're worth a fuck. **Nothing a survivor is equipped for, outside of cheating should prevent you from doing that job.**  
---
As a survivor, we're at your mercy and playstyle. This isn't Friday the 13th. We can't group up and spam stun you until you rage quit or even kill you. If you're getting body blocked and looped or your feelings hurt in post game chat, that's on you. 
---
I've played as killer for a year and had no problems dealing with SWF groups or getting 4K's most of the time. The problem with this game is most killers are just not good players and BHVR has done everything they can to cater to that so we even have a game to play because without killers we have no game.  
---
So please, stop whining. Killers have more then what they need to win every match. Including total control of the play field.
---
Your bias led you to comment on 6 words that I said ignoring the whole rest of the post. There r people in this sub complaining about every single thing I put there, take your head out of your ass and dont be scared to comment on something that you may lose an argument over.
---
It doesn't spark discussion either way. You get either a bunch of salty survivors agreeing with you and attacking killers, or a bunch of baby rage killers attacking survivors. I doubt any minds are changed at the end of that.
---
Is it really though? It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine 14 seconds making a difference against a camping killer. It‚Äôs all going to come down to the rescuer having BT anyway, in which case they probably aren‚Äôt waiting till the very last second to barge in for the save. I don‚Äôt see why I‚Äôd ever use this?
---
I might, but I don't have Netflix
---
Ah, finally. **Vore** in DbD
---
U/evand848
---
Small game, green map with a string add on, and that one perk of Tapp's all serve as great totem hunting devices. Yet people constantly refuse to use them, even though they openly expect Ruin to be used even more than NOED.
---
Where there's a will...
---
LOL, speaking of which, my Netflix sub actually expired today. The coincidence.
---
Finally someone else who thinks this! They are good, but to be run alot they have to be too good
---
The problem with this is that playing for max emblems won't even get you max emblems as a killer because gens will be done and survivors will be out the door.  Gatekeeper?  Forget about it.  Devout?  Nope.  There's a VERY SMALL margin where killers can actually double pip - it has to be a really close game OR you have to completely dominate the survivors and then literally sandbag half the game so you don't depip/black pip for winning too quickly.
---
It's stupid as hell.  Just give us blood points according to all the stupid sidequest BS and let us actually rank based off of things that require skill.
---
&gt; There really are no more excuses.
---
Oh you sweet summer child, there will be many more excuses.
---
A new Houdini build has been created, bring Quick and Quiet, Dance with Me, Urban Evasion, and Fixated. Also, just hope that the person unhooking you has babysitter.
---
*Huntress: OH, You do this for me? You husband now!*
---
&gt; Also outside of sci fi, what if the entity created their own killer? A manifestation of themselves based on killers it has taken hold of.
---
Oh that be so neat.  kind of like what Kala was in the game Evolve. A character who used aspects of the monsters that were in the game into their kit.  She was supposed to be turned into a monster herself that used a very Invoker type system.
---
It‚Äôs commonly believed that tier 1 is the best version, I‚Äôm inclined to agree
---
i said Comrade, ill get you off that hook, yes yes Comrade, we will flee this dumb crook!
---
Is there not a general agreement that stranger Things is light years bigger than dbd?
---
At least pig travels more distance and with charge time decreasing cooldowns it's actually good, especially against some pallets which you can be looped if you are a standard M1 killer. You just switch direction just after faking one direction and BOOM! Easy hit.
---
yeh
---
&gt; definitely not bad perk that could guarantee you a hit against greedy survivors
---
Excuse me? How is your teammate popping a generator equals to the survivor getting chased being greedy? I'm confused by your logic here
---
But survivors can see the tunnels.
---
I think it'd be cooler to just make the burrows a lot smaller/ almost transparent/ invisible until a survivor starts trying to clear it or steps on it. Would fit more with how it's like in the show
---
Fixated + that crouched perk that makes you go fast = you can‚Äôt sacrifice what can‚Äôt be caught
---
If your finding killer too hard too play as and win then you to find why u keep losing. You can try using different perks and killers to switch up your play style to see if that helps. If you keep getting looped easily then you need to change how you deal with loops. Flashlight and pallets stun can be  countered by perks such as lightborn and enduring. There are also countless steam guides and YouTube videos you can go to for help.
---
**Jesus Christ it‚Äôs Jason Bourne.**
---
Windows of opportunity on Kate. Reveals pallets and Windows even when not injured.
---
It looks decent
---
Spirit/Billy tier? Fuck no
---
Leatherface/Trapper tier? No
---
I wish they removed the explosion notifications from it, the timer doesn't bother me as much as the explosions. 
---
But yeah, the reduced timer is actually better. As a survivor I've seen a lot of killers using Discordance so I try to prioritize solo generators and even tap a gen real quick if there is a survivor already working on it, to see if the killer immediately comes in this direction.
---
Yes a lot of darker outfits got made a bit brighter.
---
Does it mean that survivors who get jumped at a gen by a pig or something, can't immediately sprint burst or dead hard away?
---
Does it also mean that their other perks are inactive while on a gen?
---
Sorry forget what exhaustion does.
---
Inner strength is going to be nerfed real fast
---
Putting a survivor in a dying state seems pretty clear to me. Also seems it can be more than one gen. The only grey might be if I grab someone, do I have to drop them to trigger surge? Overcharge is kicking a gen. Surge is upon dying state.
---
Time spent cleansing a potential NOED totem is not time wasted. Ill take 22s to get healed and increase my chances of avoiding future bullshit over 20s of being generally useless to my team any day.
---
The teacher: "What the fuck"
---
Locker Master Dwight: 
---
Head On, Quick and Quiet, Inner Strength, Dance With Me
---
That's a design problem and punishing players because you did a shit job designing is not only a bad idea, it's incredibly stupid.
---
... You do know that the "Pounce" is just a lunge, right? You can't jump over anything, you can't change direction and from what we've seen in the stream its really short. Its literally the pigs lunge but much worse.
---
The best part is that there are people, people in this very thread even, that say they cant use Spirit. For whatever reason; they cant phase well, they dont know when to, they dont understand the survivor mindset/gameplan when facing a Spirit, etc. and yet these posts are always some of the most popular. Is it because she's a viable killer? Like, are yall upset that she's strong and you cant just run in circles continuously? Maybe you're sick and tired of facing Nurse AND Spirit at Rank 1 and just want to whittle it down to facing Nurses all day? She's not Nurse-level difficult (she also isn't Nurse-level powerful) but she's no where near "a chipmunk with a headset can 4k every game" simplicity.
---
More importantly, how far can go with a leap, can he leap over pallets/low loops (2/3 of a normal survivor's height), is he slowed down while charging it, how much is he slowed down?
---
Survivors often see dull totems too but ignore them to rush gens and complain about NoED after.
---
Yeah that was some seriously fluid badassery right there! Were you expecting the overcharge skill check when you were doing the save or did you just roll with it?
---
I would've just thought the gen would blow up if you stop mid check
---
It depends whether your putting something bias like NOED OP plz nerf or Nerf sprint burst then yeah, but if you‚Äôre recommending a feature or a character in a post than you don‚Äôt really see killers and survivors arguing :)
---
Claudette is Queen .
---
well thats fucking unnerving
---
Seems like a fun build, but the killer has to not check a locker for 8 seconds, or see the blood leading to it or hear you
---
If you pull it off amazing! If not you have 4 more totems
---
Mindbeaker seems fucking busted good to be honest. Exhaustion perks are everything. Or am I reading this wrong and the effect only lasts 3 seconds after getting off a gen instead of the full duration?
---
If it's just that then it's a counter to Sprint Burst and not much else.
---
Total control? You have total control of ironworks of misery infinite or having your ruin spawn cross map. A group of perfect survivors will always beat a perfect killer. I get the kills that's not the problem. I see these people complain and bully newer killers and its fucking pathetic. The things people actually try to complain about is pathetic and scares away people from a game that I would want to continue playing without waiting 40 minutes for a game. It's as if you ignore the constant survivor complaints and just hear killers.
---
No, killing everybody is LITERALLY your objective.  If they want to change that - THEY SHOULD.
---
*The legion, with the power of running and stabbing, in the next other corner*
---
I feel like Fixated isn't enough of a perk to really take. Seeing your scratch marks is interesting, and walking faster is neat but... that's it? For a perk slot?
---
It's a pretty poor standalone perk, it needs time be complimented and that's not fantastic.
---
Its obnoxious. They feel entitled to a 4k 5 gens left using no add ons as a blind no blink nurse with no perks against red rank survivors. Sometimes you lose sometimes you win in competitive multiplayer games. The reason people get so salty is because its assymetrical, so when one side exploits something the other side cant do, it feels ‚Äúunfair‚Äù. Thats the only thing I can think of as to why the community feels this way in every assymetrical multiplayer.
---
Like sometimes I get wrecked as killer and sometimes I do good. Thats how assymetrical games should play out. You shouldnt always win/lose or else its extremely boring.
---
Ooh, that's a neat idea
---
I've heard that the art team put a lot of time in Steve's hair because they wanted to do it justice and spend extra time on it.
---
I think theyre good perks, but nt meta worthy. babysitter is SO going in my altruism build though
---
&gt;There really are no more excuses.
---
Cleansing visible totems will just make the totem no one can find NOED
---
The current actual counter to NOED is keeping totems near exit gates/ last 3 gens up.
---
it's because they have to wait 20 minutes for lobbies while most survivors just play lol
---
About Mindbreaker, I think it actually said that the exhaustion debuff will be paused up to 3 seconds after they stop repairing the generator. So my understanding is the normal exhaustion timer will be activated with up to an additional 3 seconds.
---
Jojo reference, ye
---
It cant turn much, you can see him turn slightly. Towards the end
---
Definitely.
---
Imagine thinking NOED is a completely fair perk and throwing a fit when a soft counter gets introduced.
---
Should I tell him that adding an ‚Äú/s‚Äù after the text doesn‚Äôt make it any better when it was added in post?
---
(Here‚Äôs the comment, by the way: https://www.removeddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctzbdq/comment/expgjdl)
---
Ah yes, noed, the only real counter to adrenaline, etc, totally unfair. Fuck off
---
Eh, its only 14 more seconds
---
Maybe I missed it or maybe its too early but do we know when the new chapter goes live?
---
Now let's so the same, but with survivor instead of spirit and W key and M1 instead of headphones :D
---
Upper mid-tier tier since it has map pressure and a sweet lunge to help chases
---
Or any killer in the game that's not Nurse. Every single pallet on that map is safe and the killer's skill isn't a factor in how well he does. Either survivors use all the pallets before they do the gens or the killer loses. It's just really boring.
---
If that's the case then Mindbreaker would be an A to an S tier perk. It would basically completely negate survivors perks that they depend on to avoid damage when gen repairing.
---
Iron Maiden Huntress [heavy moaning]
---
Honestly if we haven't gotten it by now it's probably not happening. We have about triple the amount of perks since when the game launched and so far BHVR has seen fit to keep it at 4 perk slots. 
---
But who knows, never say never with this game.
---
I mean, why not?
---
It's a NSFW page so it's quarantined. If the link doesn't work for you it's cuz of your settings.
---
Super saiyan Myers
---
Aside from not making yourself a target by tbagging or flashing at every pallet no not really. I see people hook camp and tunnel a lot more in lower ranks (20-15 or so). Theres unfortunately not much you as a survivor can do besides breaking line of sight and hiding. 
---
People that intend on tunneling meaning avoiding everyone else and deliberately running are going to do it no matter what.
---
Oh yeah. And I'd liked to think we would see some very nice spindly spider bits on this killer too. Make it look like someone tried to cram the entity into a human-ish framed build
---
oh no, i'm having terrible flashbacks... very good point my dude...
---
No one here mentioned that its vaults WITHIN 32 METER OF THE COMPLETED GEN. PLEASE READ.
---
Lol, why are you two the same height?
---
Btw wanted to clarify that Noed got buffed a while ago.
---
Before you knew as soon as the exit gates were powered that the killer had noed, now you need to hit someone to make it show.
---
Plus before instadown was only at tier 3, now it's all tier
---
Decisive strike helps.  Another thing that helps is being sneaky after getting unhooked.  I cant tell you how many times Ill see the fresh unhook run right in front of me.  Like, of course Im going to hit you.  
---
Another thing that may help is Dead Hard.  Itll give you another chance to loop the killer and maybe escape.  
---
You could also try Lithe/Dance with Me/Quick and Quiet combo.  Just vault right after being unhooked and sprint away.
---
WELL SOMEONE IS MAD
---
Is that loud enough? (I'm not the other guy)
---
Run Decisive strike, but that doesn‚Äôt always help. You may also want to run Sprint Burst for running off the hook. 
---
It really comes down to your teammates too. If they keep unhooking near the killer (without borrowed time), then they are messing you up. If that is the case, try running kindred. It can help the other survivors to make less risky unhooks. 
---
Are you constantly running an obsession perk like Mettle of Man?
---
I never tbag and I usually don‚Äôt run flashlights
---
Go on, do it, let's see how many people agree with you. Right now, this post has almost 500 upvotes. Let's see if you can do better.
---
OH, reading these comments I thought that the scratchmarks were gone too and it got me confused. If i run this perk it‚Äôll be for scratchmarks not for faster walking, and I‚Äôd rather it do it‚Äôs job all the time
---
The full game is 20 dollars, no way it will be that. 15 dollars seems steep though. It‚Äôs only one extra character and all the other full chapter DLC‚Äôs are 7.99 USD.
---
That would make the perk broken
---
Basically you just can't recover from exhaustion while also working on a gen. You have to choose one or the other.
---
good job dude!! the first 4k is exhilarating
---
isn't it already? like i swear i did it 3 minutes ago.
---
The problem is that they tried to build the emblem system thinking it's some kind of "reward" system - and it isn't.  Ranking up is not a reward.  It's just basic skill based matchmaking yet the way they designed the system they base your rank up/rank down on things that aren't winning or losing.
---
It would be like ranking chess players 70% on winning and losing and 30% on how many pawns they had left at the end of the game.  It's nonsensical.  Just give more BP for more hooks, fewer gens completed, more pallets/gens kicked, etc and otherwise it should have NOTHING TO DO with ranking people for matchmaking.
---
I want the Demogorgon to have a flower pot costume....
---
If you could have 1-3 tokens ready to go for when you get injured then it would be too good. But it sounds like it doesn‚Äôt work like that
---
Not even close to hag. We'll see what he actually is soon
---
I don‚Äôt have mettle of man no, I run lithe, botany, self care, alert
---
Not incredibly relevant but I believe it stops you from screaming when you get hooked as well iirc
---
Thats my Bubba Basement Build,i fucking love it
---
Mmh. Using perks to bandaid gameplay problems.
---
I thought that was NOT what we wanted.
---
14 extra seconds to rush gens and get out of the game while the killer plays phone games and fiddles with his dick is pretty decent to me personally especially on the very slim off chance it procs more than once, but for me personally campers are uncommon asf to begin with so I personally wouldn‚Äôt run it for that reason. It might be strong to get out of lower ranks where noed/insidious bubbas are a lot more common
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt it?
---
I‚Äôm waiting for Dstrike to get into the shrine
---
True. I think the legion update was meant to make him less cancerous toplay against, not nessecatily balance him, but it sucks that they didn't buff him since.
---

it doesn‚Äôt help that im getting pit against extremely experienced survivors
---
I think mid September.
---
&gt;Levels 1-39: Unchanged 
---
&gt;Levels 40-49: Three perks appear, up to two can be purchased.
---
&gt;Level 50: Four perks appear, up to two can be purchased. 
---
That's it?! That barley changes anything, and you still need to trudge through piles of worthless garbage to get the perks you want. (brown offerings and addons) The entity snatches one of the other two perks at random, which means there's a 50/50 chance that the entity will take what you want.
---
Yes, but they could keep the general idea and just do some tweaks&amp;change the dragging mechanic.
---
CONGRATULATIONS! GF here and hes picked it up quickly despite still new to PC controls
---
I feel this way about surveillance too.  
---
Also, in some cases I prefer tier 1 Distressing over tier 3 as well.
---
It blocks vaults within 32 meters of the COMPLETED GEN. This makes a HUGE difference and I'm sorry you were duped by someone who didn't read the entirety of the perk description
---
As a Dwight main I‚Äôm exited for inner strength
---
But you know that Stridor doesn't make it sem for killer like survs are louder, but **it actually makes them louder.** So you (as a survivor) can actually hear if killer has Stridor or not if you hear that your character is breathing and screaming too loud. Spaghetti Code.
---
I didn't even realize there was one today.
---
As long as they let me buy the killer separate I don't care.
---
Chess is nothing. At least there are some tactics you can learn, you can see your opponent. But this? This is just impossible! :P Billy is easier overall, but curving is way harder than anything else with the spirit tbh.
---
You only get the bloody cosmetic for the Survivors default outfit.
---
No, just the basic outfit.
---
Nope! Just the default outfit gets bloody counterparts
---
I used to D/C against doc was I was a nooblet, then I learned it's Nurse who is bullshit to face. I love facing doc, my teammates actually do things, so thank you
---
If you time the stream of Nancy closing a portal it took her about 20 seconds. Which for survivors is a significant time sink in the current gen rush meta.  Depending on how long it takes a Demogorgan to dig a tunnel it could be a good way to slow the game down or speed up your mobility. Either way the Demogorgan gets something out of it.
---
Unbreakable just seems more tanky than a mid-chase heal+ boost.
---
Beta or Alpha would fit the game a lot more imo.
---
"tanky" oh absolutely, I misread your comment
---
It does. It's a bit unconcerting to put someone on a hook and have them be silent lol
---
Legion got nerfed so hard, so that survivors can steal their weapons... Ridiculous. Rework Legion plz.
---
So... $12 then?  $4 per character would be my guess.  IDC, I'm only buying the killer anyways.
---
Definitely run Kindred then. It is a universal perk that anyone can get. That should help a bit to allow the other survivors to improve their unhooks. It is hard not to be tunneled sometimes when risky unhooks are made.
---
Well yeah survive with friends are always hard to beat, can't really give advice besides just get better
---
I love baby Dweet‚Äôs
---
We'll wait and see, but def not a shit killer and NOT a new Legion
---
New Sonic trailer looks really nice
---
Only if he's constantly in really angry Negan mode and has his bandanna over his face (to go with the masked killer theme already present).
---
None the less, power and perk time!:
---
Negan, AKA The Savior
---
**Power: Savior's Fury-** When activated, your terror radius fades away immediately and a whistle is heard.  Gradually over a period of 8 seconds, your terror radius returns. Those within your terror radius suffer from suspenseful fear, resulting in a lack of coordination. After 8 seconds, you enter Savior's Fury, (distorted, blurry vision) allowing you to break pallets and generators with lunge attacks (a powerful swing animation that is longer than a standard lunge but shorter than a break action) and successful attacks with your standard weapon have no cooldown.
---
*Each survivor within your terror radius while Savior's Fury is active suffer the following penalties:*
---
All action speeds are reduced by 5%
---
All rushed actions become regular actions.
---
Savior's Fury last for 8 seconds,(This means from start to finish, the ability takes 16 seconds to use) after which you enter a state of cooldown that lasts 30 seconds.
---
**Little Pig, Little Pig:** *You decisively eliminate your foes, striking fear into those remaining.*
---
Every time a survivor is sacrificed or killed this perk gains a token up to a maximum of 3. Each token increases your terror radius by 3/4/5% but reduces the visual brightness of your red stain slightly/moderately/tremendously.
---
**Made of Steel:** *You're not going down until you're good and ready.*
---
When stunned by a perk or pallet, Made of Steel activates. While active, the next time you are stunned by a perk or pallet, you gain a 2/4/6% speed boost. This perk deactivates upon successful hit and must be activated again.
---
**Hex: Eeny, meeny, miny, moe:** *You allow luck to choose who goes next.*
---
Spawns 1/2/3 additional dull totems.
---
While this perk is active, the lit totem associated with it moves every thirty seconds between the remaining dull totems on the map. Every time it moves, a survivor is selected at random to become exposed if at full health, or broken if injured. If the chosen survivor is in the dying state, their aura vanishes until another survivor is chosen.
---
Sorry for bad formatting. Will fix as I am able to.
---
*cries while thinking in No Mither*
---
Spine Chill bro, Spine Chill
---
:D ayee there's a smart one lol
---
I'm disapointed they were so shy with Camaraderie. Its a good perk idea but totally useless the way its designed.
---
That‚Äôs not at all what it‚Äôs saying lol.
---
I mean I stream it. But I get what he‚Äôs saying, survivor gameplay majority of the time is holding a mouse button on a generator.
---
i think sometime in september
---
Detective Tapp: [Jealous Staring]
---
Can you buy only the Killer? Since it‚Äôs licensed you‚Äôre probably only allowed to buy the full bundle, and you can‚Äôt buy licensed characters with shards.
---
It's "better" against stealth killers whose small terror radius might not trigger Borrowed Time.
---
why is it only white girls
---
Not really. Since they get the oblivious icon whether they're in the killers terror radius or not.
---
I will give kindred a try then
---
If they don‚Äôt add it, they are throwing money out the window.
---
I will be playing Demogorgan just for Surge. I love denying gen progress, and it just seems so broken.
---
I had a Freddy call me trash and easy because I ran him for two gens but he still killed everyone. Toxic people will always be toxic.
---
LOL
---
It practically cuts the grind in half that's pretty nice at least
---
he‚Äôs bullying the entity by asserting his dominance
---
Scared the shit out of me fairly recently. I was using Spinechill for a while and was playing on the hospital map and just going around looking for a gen when I suddenly got whacked on the back of the head and I jumped like crazy. I completely forgot that he was undetectable in Tier 1 :|
---
It's a shame that you can't even say that you don't think these perks are that good without getting downvoted :( 
---
I agree with you, I don't even run the meta but I can't see how these perks are so strong like most people are saying.
---
Like imo they seems interesting for sure but not strong.
---
Try running Franklins when everyone runs flashlights, then act like youre going to pick up the slug, then down whoever was going to flash you.  You could also try looking at walls when picking up survivors.  
---
Personally I love swfs because theyre altruistic to a fault.  This lets me get easy downs when three people rush the same hook
---
It is true that tier 1 is the best, as it gives notifications faster.
---
If you care about your rank and are goomba stomping the survivors that hard, you have the luxury to toy with them for more emblem score. 
---
Second, if we are talking in red ranks, I could give a lesser fuck about their difficulty getting double pips. Even Hotter Take: Once you‚Äôre in red rank you should care very little about double pipping cause you have no difference in skill between rank 2/3/4 and Rank 1. It‚Äôs all the same stuff. 
---
If you‚Äôre in green or purple and the survivors are just dogshit levels of bad you quite literally hold all the power in the game and can do whatever you want to get points and emblem score. To get to the rank where it really doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you safety pip every game. 
---
Trust me, nothing says high skill than Nurse with Infectious and a Terror Radius increasing perk just slugging everyone and them being showered with a double pip.
---
New killer confirmed
---
Every killer has different hooks.
---
He's cool like that
---
Reducing it by basically half isn't a crazy amount?
---
Good luck. Unfortunately it is not something you have control over. Tunneling changes as you go through the ranks.
---
Any thoughts on how effectively Surge will work with Infectious Fright?
---
Great for sitting in bushes while your teammates run the killer and eventually die so you can scoot over to trapdoor and get minimal points. Woo!
---
Nea ;)
---
**wild claudette:** *hey... can i rub your butt*
---
That's fair. Sad that you hate Dustin but I reckon I could understand.
---
Feng Min
---
There's not enough David on that sub for me so bye ok
---
I think the person who was told about it may have misunderstood, or maybe something was lost in translation. Her one perk still activates with generators, so I suspect that was the actual perk that was mentioned.
---
Yeah but it also requires a survivor to be near the hook doing nothing also just to get that 14 seconds. It would be different if the timer pausing was based solely off the killer being within 16m, and didn‚Äôt require a survivors presence. Then you‚Äôd have 3 survivors on gens.
---
oh no lol killers dont want me to have a 5th perk now  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) *uNbReAkAbLe BoIz*  
---
edit: 5 slots are overkill lol
---
It‚Äôs not difficult to be efficient with the blood web. You see two perks you want? Don‚Äôt take detours for those party streamers or some add on you want. Make a beeline for those perks first.
---
If the entity eats that other item you wanted, it‚Äôll be back.
---
You can get a merciless without a 4k in yellow and gray ranks, but in any other ranks you need a 4k to make double pipping easier as well as needing to pressure gens and drag the game out as long as possible.
---
Ok, thanks
---
It‚Äôs your opinion that it‚Äôs your favorite?
---
I keep messaging killers with a GG and occasionally a compliment, but they either have messages turned off or they never respond :\
---
Never once said *nobody* is going to put themselves in danger. What other survivors do is out of your control as a solo player. It could very well be the case that you‚Äôre on a map with hard-to-find totems (like The Game) and/or your teammates who all decide to hunt down and cleanse all of the totems before doing anything else. If that happens, they‚Äôve just made your perk either far more difficult to activate or totally useless. 
---
It has an activation requirement, Self-Care does not. That‚Äôs the gist of why it‚Äôs worse.
---
The Playstation doesnt have a ‚Äúnormal edition‚Äù it only has a special edition it‚Äôs the only edition of the game on ps4 (i‚Äôm pretty sure)
---
Yup. This will be great on killers like Wraith and Pig, where an early sprint burst completely shuts down their surprise factor.
---
Uhhh I‚Äôm very tired lol
---
I've won 3-gen games with doc pretty often. If I'm constantly putting people in madness 3 and hitting them while playing defensively, survivors cannot snap out of madness 3, (Optionally) heal, go to a generator, likely miss the Overcharge skill check, FINALLY start repair progress, and finish the generator while dealing with randomly placed unnerving skill checks in the time it takes me to hook the survivor and go back to the 3-gen. If it feels like I'm over-extending I'll disengage and go back to the 3-gen.
---
If a gen is nearing completion I can usually get it regressed by a large amount if survivors keep blowing the unnerving overcharge skillcheck repeatedly. 
---
IDK about red ranks but even in green and purple ranks it seemed a 3-gen doc was nigh unbeatable especially if he is good at timing shocks at loops.
---
OP now you can bad-mouth everyone who doubted you.
---
calm down son, its just a drawing
---
Yea , I feel sad but she still have cool perks , maybe not cooler but I think it's enough for a 3 characters chapter
---
But it's not strong - at all? Haven't you seen the killer POV effects of Lightweight? It's utter trash since the difference is almost unnoticeable.
---
Jane has cake
---
He doesn't look strong imo but its a bit early to tell.
---
His power looks weaker than Freddy's teleport, and his charge looks similar strenght as pig's charge. Really don't see it competing with nurse or spirit.
---
I dont see how this is toxic
---
ok so 1. fuck yes monto is my lord
---
2. nice cosplay
---
3. can we take a moment to reflect on how handsome of a person monto is B)
---
Windows of Opportunity: *Am I a joke to you?*
---
why fucking copy what others have said here?
---
If you watch it again, it DOES slow down wphepn charging the leap. That, for me, makes him a MUCH worse killer. Get rid of that slow down and it's lookin pretty damn good...
---
They already had good relations with Netflix, they made a game for them, so it was quite friendly trading at the very least.
---
Does it help with Freddy's dream snares?
---
I'm really disappointed they didn't make a perk that involved seeing wounded survivor's, as the Demagorgon is attracted to blood. And honestly it seems like a Pig/Freddy/ Hag mix.
---
Edit: that made it seem like I disliked the killer. I actually think he's awesome. But the charge ability doesn't make sense for the monsters abilities.
---
The first Killer status effect since Bloodlust, Undetectable consolidates our Killer stealth mechanics into one easily understandable status that can be applied through Killer powers, perks, and add-ons.¬†
---
When a Killer is Undetectable, the following effects are applied:¬†
---
* The Killer‚Äôs terror radius is removed.¬†
---
* The Killer‚Äôs red stain is removed.¬†
---
* The Killer will not have their aura revealed.¬†
---
* The Killer does not trigger the¬†jumpscare¬†sound effect.¬†
---
* The Killer sees the smoky screen¬†visual effect.¬†
---
Yeah.  The information was an article translated into English from German.
---
I agree it's still a huge grind, but slashing the grind in half is still a huge step in the right direction.
---
I'm hoping with the introduction of the archive/battle pass that they'll reduce it further.
---
Nea.
---
Because matches tend to be balanced around killers at X rank being capable of stalling out survivors at X rank despite "gen rush". The speed at which you reliably down survivors and how you apply pressure overall is an intricate system and balance.
---
But when a killer runs noed because they find it gets enough utility, that often means they're not good at chases or applying pressure to stop 5 from popping.
---
Hence all the memes and common intuition that if a killer is playing bad, compared to other killers you just faced, this one is going to have NOED because they can't stop gens.
---
Actually, with the new undetectable status his aura wont be shown when using insidious, so you'll be the clown after September
---
Doesn't it literally go away like 5 seconds after you get off the gen?  What exactly is the problem?
---
I believe it's just lost when you're working on it, which seems to take over 10 seconds.
---
Killers which power is based on teleporting (hag), moving faster (Spirit and nurse) or injuring survivors easier (huntress) are all slower for balancing reason
---
jane is latina
---
yeah, only special version is on ps4, sorry. It's really good though, definitely worth it
---
Let me know if I forgot anything. I didn't really want to rate the perks on strength because things will be changed in the PTB but Camaraderie is looking like the worst perk in the game. In fact, it might even help the killer since if they see the timer paused, they will know somebody is nearby. 
---
I'd consider making a video to explain things further but I've never done it before, I only usually make picture guides/light translation work. Perhaps once the chapter comes out. It also goes without saying that presumably the killer perks will synergize with Demigorgon.
---
Only if the Gen is under 50%.
---
Yep and they get Huntress for free
---
Every realm*
---
I have 1081 myself, I dunno how I managed it.
---
Holy shit. I‚Äôm impressed at the size of the map. Judging by the portal and gen auras, it‚Äôs pretty good size for an inside map. I know the hospital is pretty good size but still. As a killer main, I hope there‚Äôs good loops though, looks like a lot of cramped but open rooms.
---
I am saying that rank doesn't distinguish between a perkless killer going to rank 1 and a killer with instasaw mori every game going to rank 1. That's what I did to get rank 1 killer the first time starting with less than 10 hours of killer experience. Same thing goes for a solo survivor compared to a boosted one in a 4man swf.
---
I imagine rank is supposed to separate people into matches of similar skill but functionally, that's not how it works at all. People have been complaining about it for a long time. BHVR has tried some changes but after all that, we're still here. It's better to think of this game as a casual party game as opposed to something competitive.
---
Maybe if hook/gen spawns are willing you can quickly proc the perk at the start of struggle phase then run 1-3 seconds back to a gen and work on it till the time to unhook comes? Idk it‚Äôs definitely situational you‚Äôre right. It might be good on indoor maps where hooks and gens tend to be relatively close to each other but worse on coldwinds and macmillans where its more rng dependent. Will have to see once we get to play with it
---
Theres only one edition on ps4 and its the special edition, your friend couldve just typed in dead by daylight in the search and see all the editions (that don‚Äôt exist on ps4). Or he couldve looked it up...
---
Nancy‚Äôs perks are so fucking good holy shit
---
Same thing for Xbox it's only the special edition so that we don't have to buy the unlicensed chapters I.e spark of madness, flesh and mud ect
---
It's a gamble though, on large maps you're basically guaranteed to never hit more than 2 generators at once. Still good, but not nearly as powerful as it could be otherwise.
---
More like Demo**VORE**gon, AM I RIGHT!?
---
These perks are actually good yay
---
And Haunted Grounds while we're at it.
---
They are
---
Isn't the DLC confirmed for September? PTB is usually 2-3 weeks, so at most it should only be 2 weeks away.
---
Care to elaborate? Or are you oblivious to what asymmetrical balance is? I'm just gonna assume this is just bait since I don't want to write an essay about the killer's role in this game.
---
True, but we all know swf will abuse it for a while
---
Hag main here. Monitor and abuse is probably her best perk. I also pair it with sloppy butcher and a nurse's calling and with those 3 perks alone you should be able to do really well. I run bbq as my 4th for the points but it's really not a good perk for her. I'd try corrupt intervention, dark devotion (depending on your play style), agitation, or noed as the 4th for the strongest build.
---
Except billy
---
I expect the chapter to be 10 or so.  Normal chapters usually cost 7, so it sounds about right.  
---
Individually itll probably be 15 tho
---
Can SOMEONE please explain **OBLIVIOUS** in english? im confused af..  
---
so what when a killer goes in "stealth" eg. ghostface im now oblivious which meanss if im running a perk like object... i cant see the killer right and no heartbeat...   
---
basically a nerf to all aura revealing perks against killers in stealth right? correct me if im wrong.
---
Second wind is going to fuck over stealth killers
---
I agree with everything you said except the MoM thing is where I get scared.  They absolutely destroyed that perk with the hard post release nerf.  Don't get me wrong that one needed adjusting but it's currently just so bad.  That's the example I don't want to see the new survivor perks turned into.
---
Milk
---
Honestly I think he looks pretty good probably contends with Hag I cannot say without actual gameplay but he probably won‚Äôt be near the spirit/ billy. But he does look very promising
---
Fixated should work while injured too, but I agree
---
yet
---
Since this killer has a stealth mechanic called Undetectable, it makes sense they would add a perk like this to him
---
2019: People dont know the diffirence between crouching and walking
---
And in those weeks, millions of hexes will die. RIP
---
I mean.. Thats like 20 minutes of work at a shitty college student job, for something Ill use quite a bit.
---
I mostly play survivor these days, and only really play killer for my dailies now.
---
I don't really think this is a huge deal, as it's going to be very situational. All it means is that you try to loop the killer away from your teammates who are working on gens, something you should be doing anyways. 32 metres isn't that much of an area, eapecially if you're working on gens along the perimeter. It'll definitely have more of an effect on those centre gens.
---
Yeah, sometimes you're going to get that teammate who runs in to the terror radius to work on a gen, but hopefully if they see the perk block the windows, they won't do it again.
---
Pallets will still be available to use and vault as well.
---
We need to give the perk a chance in game before the devs determine if it needs to be balanced further. That's what the PTB is for.
---
Can't wait to deny my team cause I got all the totems
---
It would be cool if we had a fnaf killer with different outfits for the characters
---
Laurie and her both rockin the mom jeans
---
Billy is the only one which cannot move freely while moving faster so this is the reason he is 115%. Wraith is also faster but he needs to uncloak, Legion too but his power doesn't work in chases, Plague can also hurt but has limited time. There are exceptions
---
So my biggest flaw is probably losing survivors, they can run into me and i‚Äôll be confused af, i lose track of scratch marks fairly easily, and that draws out the chases. When it comes to pallet loops i usually just break pallets as soon as they are dropped, i try to use bamboozle to deal with vault spots that are annoying, i run into things embarrassingly and i can‚Äôt land hits very well (my lunges usually miss).
---
Another one of my bigger flaws is stopping gen progress, when i‚Äôm patrolling gens i sometimes run into people at the gens and when i find people i chase them, but then i end up on the other side of the map and the gen gets popped, i probably shouldn‚Äôt chase them to the other side of the map, but i usually just forget about that gen when i‚Äôm chasing someone or second thought myself and lose the chase and gen.
---
so basically i suck at everything.
---
Wack

I'm a little disappointed I won't be hearing Joe or Natalia in game, but at least they look like them, so there's that and hopefully Scoops Ahoy.
---
See reply I made
---
Yeah, maybe they will also bump up the time. Even if it went up to like 20 seconds, that would be nice.
---
This is the one that blocks vaults for up to 35 seconds after the gen pops.
---
actually that might be the case. they introduced a new status effect for killers. it's called undetectable it give the killer zero terror radius and no red stain and no jump scare sound effect when seen. they said it applies on the new killer and will come to others later with 3.2.0
---
Most likely
---
Dude why no one is talking about first two perks of Demagorgon they are really decent
---
It does count them, its just not as much.  
---
You get 1 point for reaching a new hook stage, and 1 point for hooking a survivor.  So if they die on first hook its 4 points, out of the possible 6.
---
Oh no! A strategy for killers that makes the survivors have to adapt and adjust their own play instead of just fondling generators and pressing space bar.
---
Quit your bitching. If you let yourself get 3-genned. That‚Äôs on you.
---
&gt;	The Killer will not have their aura revealed.
---
Does this mean they are immune to all aura effects or just like certain ones? I spent so long trying to get object of obsession, i swear if this all goes down the drain i‚Äôm gonna cry
---
Probably SWF
---
Probs 10 to 15 bucks
---
Most likely will be the usual 5 bucks per character
---
I use premonition tier 3 so the cooldown doesn't seem like a big deal. Has saved my skin more then a few times.
---
Doesn't the clown though? Is that his actual face?
---
E. I could see what you mean with the makeup obscuring his face
---
???
---
The option of 3/4 perks instantly cuts down the grind a ton.
---
The goal on most grinds isn't to get *every* perk but get the perk you want. It can take like 150~ bloodwebs till you finally get like tier 3 BBQ&amp;C for instance.
---
With this you'll get the *4* perks you want more easily, but also use less bloodwebs for *total* completion- almost by like ~40%
---
Will fixated stack with urban evasion
---
I dont use emojis, what does that mean?
---
That's not enough, you still have to prestige 3 every single killer you want to play just to get decent perks.
---
Not to mention that you have to level a bunch of killers to unlock perks, same thing with survivors if you enjoy playing both.
---
I thought the kid shat?
---
Well if it's useless they might buff it in ptb to make it useful
---
I actually thought that UE description said your crouching speed will be 90 /95/100% same as walking speed. Then I checked UE description and relaized I was wrong. It actually increases that much of croutching speed. I must have read that description somehwhere else and thought it was mentioned on perk description.
---
NGL, this made me chuckle.
---
Okay but imagine having to cleanse Ruin TWICE
---
I highly doubt it'll work with surveillance, but who knows
---
Never even heard of who you're talking about, but stop being an asshole for no reason.
---
Run this, Self-Care, and Second wind. You need nobody to heal you ever again.
---
What would you suggest for what I have now though
---
That was fucking hot
---
It's pretty powerful,  but you play peerless for most of the game so you really have to keep pressure on. Its challenging but noed helps
---
Stealth build is my thing, I use dark sense over all the others you listed because I feel it gives the most information due to me kinda being a gen jockey. If you commonly do a lot of gens id give dark sense a try. If you prefer altruistic play, spine chill and alert may be more up your alley.
---
Yay. Broken, killer doesn't even need to try to do anything perks! Woo yeah!
---
It‚Äôs 17 seconds shorter than self care and it‚Äôs safer since you‚Äôre in the locker. Also, it encourages cleansing totems. I think this is going to be my new favorite perk to be honest. At minimum I get one fast and safe heal, but best case scenario I get 5.
---
This dude...smh...without vaults, am I just supposed to rely on 360? Pallets will be your next statement... and if they are unsafe (or possibly trapped)? Probably that "free" hit thing you were speaking of. And the simple fact you play big brain trapper...oooooh and a bloody one! Watch out everyone!
---
All that's missing is a totem counter, no real reason for there to still not be one.
---
Inner Strength is the only Survivor perk that's actually strong tbh
---
Except Billy and Leatherface.  And Wraith.  And Legion.
---
There's also Auric Cells
---
What I have now please....Also I would like to know what to build for in the future....so I guess both :)
---
I remember that one time i ran Corrupt intervention, Nurses, BBQ and Iron Maide, with Nurse, i got a 4k and in the endgame chat someone told me this
---
"You cheating bitch"
---
I asked him why did he thought i was cheating and he answered me that i blocked all the gens at the beggining of the match, i told him that that¬¥s what corrupt intervention does, he just called me a bitch and that he was going to report me for cheating with the perks
---
How? Hes just seeing your aura for 4 secs
---
I find killer queues at night to be good, a lot more SWF happen then is my logic so less killers wanting to deal with them.
---
YES! Two Dwights were dressed the same. I accidentally killed one and I felt like an asshole. But he didn‚Äôt wriggle or anything, so maybe he didn‚Äôt mind?
---
Seems like a mid tier killer in my opinion, decent map pressure okish second ability, ability is countered easily but still gives a little benefit when they mess with it.
---
well, 2 things. I have an Ebony mori, and I meant to put NOED lol
---
The new perk arguement can be easily evaluated by not wanting to pay for character/dlc or wait til the perk appears in shrine
---
(Babysitter) lol
---
He used the ants for slave labor
---
Undetectable is something only you know; so ghosty wuld activate undetectable and not have his terror radious,  red stain or aura reading applied to him. Oblivious wouldnt apply to survivors, just undetectable to ghost face.
---
If someone uses an add on or perk that makes players loose being able to detect oblivioys, then they will hav the status. So its more so how or whats being applied to who, but there is two separate things here
---
I was really hoping that the demigorgan's power set would be super and interesting due to it being so different from all other killers. I'm sad that this interdimensional horror show is going to act like another slasher.
---
Oh well.
---
SCOOPS AHOY!
---
What makes this different from every other DLC that includes perks?  You either buy the DLC, or wait for the perks to show up in the shrine.  The only unique thing about this DLC is the fact that there's two survivors.
---
Same
---
Ghostface. literally two hours before they released him in the store, they announced that he'd be releasing today and bytheway we have a couple nerfs planned that will be released in a week or so.
---
also, Legion was nerfed within two months of release so hard, he was basically deleted. they applied nerfs to him that weakened him in ways that no one had even complained about. All that was ever wrong with him was an exploit that allowed him to make the bleed out timer go down by sidestepping towards survivors. that's all that needed fixed. instead, he lost the ability to see blood and got stunned simply by hitting air. not even Hillbilly needs anerf like that.
---
What do you normally run?
---
Elaborate
---
Nah if that were true it‚Äôd be head on but like that instead of stunning the killer
---
i love this as both a plague and jane main, janes right and plague agrees
---
It‚Äôs hard for even a skilled Huntress to get hits when survivors can just yeet to the left when they hear an axe throw
---
Too bad I'm gonna get all the totems
---
(Unhooks with we'll make it) "nah, I'll just wait for my perk to kick in"
---
It's pretty cool that the whining has started before the PTB is even out, as usual
---
Huntress is high risk high reward, you need to be skilled to play her.
---
But there's also double the amount of perks on each bloodweb, meaning you have significantly higher chance of finding it earlier.
---
I steer am I a joke to you meme
---
Some guy in the YouTube comments section with 4000 hours tried to tell me that they needed to nerf gen rushing and they aren't doing that. Noed exists, it's the perfect gen rush counter.
---
... Oh, I'm sorry, was there supposed to be an actual comment here? All I see is pointless complaining and facts. It's almost like you cant handle the thought of not having an easy win! Honestly. If a pallet is trapped, you avoid it or lose. What's your complaint here? I'm a buwwy for twapping da pallet? You want a spoon fed victory and the thought of not getting it sends you into a tantrum. And idek what your last sentence was about. "Watch out everyone he plays Trapper" isnt an insult, or anything close. Maybe form an opinion before you spew the formless goop that is your thoughts into acomment.
---
very good
---
I hope whoever voice them sound similar at least by their tone like not too old but not too young either. I can already tell Nancy is going to have a high pitched scream like Meg.
---
Surge + Overcharge? Would make a hell of a 3 gen trap.
---
SWF does not need the help, it is already dominant enough. Camaraderie is no buff to swf at all unless you all suck
---
I kinda like those new status effects, it will definitely make the game little bit scarier.
---
I think her difficulty should be set to hard, especially now that survivors can pull a Matrix whenever she throws an axe.
---
I just realized it sucks they weren‚Äôt able to get Jason Voorhees for chapter 13
---
Imagine having to cleanse devour hope twice
---
God no, if it was anything like Freddy 1.0, Demogorgon would be the worst killer in the game, we need more decent killers. If the power has to step a bit away from the lore to actually be good, they should do it
---
Pretty sure the argument their trying to make is they benefit two separate movement styles so why take both? I mean you will either be walking everywhere or crouching everywhere, if Fixated worked on crouching I could see the appeal
---
i think that nancy is ugly and plague is the best lookinh
---
But your aura won‚Äôt be shown to him
---
there‚Äôs no doubt that spirit is one of the hardest, if not the hardest killer to learn. that being said, dbd doesn‚Äôt really have anything that requires insane mechanical skill. it‚Äôs a pretty simple game and even the hardest killers are relatively easy to learn.
---
Or just find a totem, cleanse totem, get chased, sit in locker for a heal, headon stun and run away
---
EW1 Myers already has something similar to Undetectable. He's immune to aura reading, spine chill, and premonition.
---
omg ikr i thought that it looked weird
---
Initially I thought the killer perks were amazing, however the more I think about them, the less convinced I am that they will replace the meta bbq/ruin/spirit fury/enduring.
---
Especially the two generator completion ones. It seems like often they will see little to no benefit.
---
Really? 
---
You‚Äôve got one that is meant to prevent tunnelling but won‚Äôt work if the killer is actually able to see the unhook, and probably doesn‚Äôt make any difference if he‚Äôs further away than that 
---
You‚Äôve got one that pauses struggle for 14 seconds and lets the killer know someone is near the hook...?
---
And one that saves you 10-15 seconds of healing your teammate under a hook, or doesn‚Äôt work if the killer comes back and starts a chase as you stay broken
---
The killers perks are good but Steve‚Äôs are super weak imo
---
Surge on a 3gen doctor is gonna be a fucking nightmare
---
I see but fixated also has the ability to see your scratch marks so you can play mind games with the killer
---
There are dozens of us. 
---
*But only 6 are actually players*
---
I wonder if the killer sees the hook timer bar stop reducing when it gets activated. If so, I feel like it'll almost be a detriment, as it'll tell the killer when someone has approached the hook.
---
But that means I can't combo it with Unnerving Presence anymore!
---
You have to have two portals down to use it, you don‚Äôt only have two portals
---
The chase has always been balanced with the survivors in mind so I seriously doubt it
---
You get gen rushed by multiple people working on multiple gens at the same time. Your idea wouldnt really work. If anything, it would encourage gen rushing lol.
---
MOOKLE MERS!!!!
---
We don't need a Freddy deal again
---
All of them sound meta breaking, I like it.
---
Spider-Man 2
---
Forgetting about the stealth when it emerges from a portal?
---
People like you are the reason as to why we have to face the same 2 killers  24/7 in red ranks
---
Licensed are always never buyable with iridescent
---
I hope they give some kind of buff to mikey as well since object of obsession can be a pain when your terror radius in tier 2 is only 6 meters with m&amp;a and rabbit... Its basicly the same as survivors seeing the cloaked wraith etc.
---
just use calm spirit and distortion. ez iron maiden counter
---
it matches his length too, so it fits
---
*literally*
---
As another Spirit main, can confirm, spirit is brainlessly easy to play. I love playing against her too but the good ones like myself, are not a fun time lol. Especially since most survivors have 0 clue on how to mind game her in chase at all.
---
People are definitely downplaying the bloodweb changes. You will pretty reliably get the good perks you actually want at level 50 now. No more going through 80 level 50 bloodwebs without getting bbq or dead hard.
---
This post is so confusing. You are making an idea because you're mad about getting genrushed but refuse to run the single biggest perk in the game for slowing gen progression, saying you don't care if you win or lose. This post is so meta I can't even understand it.
---
That sounds like it could make for a great perk name lmao
---
Guys, it's a explosion, not a kick, those perks that relly in the killer kicking such as Pop, Surv, Overcharge and stuff won't work, at any time it said it was a kick, the gen explode so it can regress a bit
---
Still not doing them until they add a totem counter lul
---
There should be a day in a week where both killers and survivors get random perks when the match starts. I‚Äôd be down with that. Incentivize with a 1.5x bloodpoint bonus for that day
---
Yeah, I know ;P It wouldn't be smart to say that something is for sure going to be released on X day. People who played dbd for longer time will know the date anyway, because it almost always was Tuesday, I think since Freddy DLC every new chapter was released on Tuesday. And I'm 99% sure it's 27th, they wouldn't wait almost two weeks after livestream revealing everything :P
---
I mean, it's hard to come up with versatile and useful perks now, since the meta is meta for a reason; those perks can be applied to almost every trial, no matter who the killer is and what perks they run. As long as people keep running these perks, the niche perks will most likely never be used. 
---
I for one love the Stranger Things perks and I can't wait to try them, but it's become obvious that most perks that are put into the game with every chapter cater to complaints from both sides, especially regarding tunneling, NOED, genrushing, etc. It's up to everyone to actually use them, but I do feel that the introduction to these kind of perks give less room for complaints from both sides, which is good. 
---
It's a shame though that right from the get-go people start complaining about perks being OP without having actually tried them. I play both sides, so I'm not biased, but I have noticed that it's usually the killer side that tends to complain about survivor perks. I know it's a 4v1, but having survivors only get perks that cater to the killers is not the way to go either. The MoM and DS nerfs were kind of necessary though, but I wish people would give new perks a try before asking for nerfs.
---
The new perks are *very* situational, but they seem fun and also somewhat useful.
---
and being hit as well.
---
Nah, spirit takes very little skill. Shes OP. Anyone that justifies her either sucks with her or is sipping some good old killer main bias.
---
Remembers me of Mind Flayer of Stranger Things
---
But even 2 gens at once is equivalent to Pop Goes the Weasel, without even requiring you to hook the person. It probably won‚Äôt be the strongest perk around, but it definitely seems like it will have a place in quite a variety of builds. If paired with Thrilling Tremors, it would also guarantee 16 seconds of regression time for the now popped generators, plus extra time after Tremors ends if the survivors weren‚Äôt right next to the gens.
---
Again, it‚Äôs not the new Ruin, but it seems quite strong, especially with certain killers or perk combinations.
---
And Freedy Snares
---
There are only so many perk ideas they can have. They can never do simple perks again, that's why they're having to come up with increasingly situational/niche perks.
---
*The Trapper, with the power of placing traps, in the bottom-left corner of the other room*
---
I think that would be cool
---
The perks could use number buffs.
---
Question. I may be interpreting this wrong, but it sounds like camaraderie could keep someone on the hook forever if another survivor keeps entering and exiting the radius. It probably won't be like this in game, but could it be for the first day?
---
So he's affiliated with the game?
---
It prevents any possibility of survs countering your phase. It's good insurance for that one iron will survivor.
---
I could see Inner Strength requiring you to cleanse two totems or spend longer in the locker and Surge getting a nerf to its regression speed
---
Ghostface was entirely broken during the PTB and utter trash, and then they fixed him and now he's a fun to play against killer.
---
Lvl 40+  3 perks appear and can get 2, lvl 50 4 perks appear and you can get 3
---
I'm surprised he plays this game on a daily basis after so much, pretty much states why he's skilled right here and his knowledge about maps and good/bad loops is on point.
---
I think it makes your normal kick have higher regression to but im not sure. I did hear that
---
He‚Äôs just a popular Youtuber/ streamer who mainly plays dbd
---
Delete this, nephew. 
---
That‚Äôs awful, don‚Äôt give them that idea.
---
No but it's super easy and boosted.
---
Nea all day lol
---
i hate it when they knife
---
How do you feel about the niche perks being put out more and more though? Do you think eventually, with enough of them, people would stray away from the meta in favor of specific playstyles that suit them? And is that something you would consider doing in the future if you found a niche with useful perks that helped you excel in game over the commonly used perks?
---
I agree, but I feel like a standard counter would be too much. Having small game have a counter sounds more balanced, since that perk's main use is to find totems.
---
Ok
---
[Nope.](https://youtu.be/osAhJ_Kl_J0)
---
Thats the entire point of totems though
---
You have no idea :)
---
$9.99
---
*AW MAN*
---
The same people saying they don't watch because of x(insert reason)...I gurantee are the same people that watch his channel but like to hate... Just a lil bit lolüòÇüëÄ
---
have you met the sounds survivors make when walking through grass, or on concrete? or just bumping into the survivor while phasing? 
---
iron will helps but it doesn't help that much
---
Hmm, thanks
---
I mean it is like like a 1/32 chance right? I've only gotten it a couple of times
---
I played on that map a week or so ago on PC once and haven't played it on console since I can remember. Maybe it's getting lost with all those Badham variations. I was playing on them constantly for the past week or so.
---
V O R E, BOYS AND GIRLS, STRAIGHT V O R E
---
Dwight
---
I play solo survivor, its pretty damn easy. The counter of totems is "cleanse them, count how many you got and how many there are with hex perks"
---
If inner strength becomes meta, just counter with iron maiden. XD
---
Hears evil tier up, alright who‚Äôs the idiot who gave Michael his tier-OH SHIT!
---
Why did anyone think this in the first place? We had absolutely no reason to think this was the case.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
I'm going to be out here with a meme heal self build - Inner Strength Second Wind Adrenaline Head on
---
Sure, complaining is counterproductive, reducing the number of hooks to 2 is productive, for now at least.
---
They went from top tier killers to killers with more drawbacks than bubba (on the test phase, obviously). D:
---
Oh okay, thanks. I googled him and I thought he was a famous tester.
---
didnt devs already say that they wont ever make a killer that can pretend to be a survivor or anything similar because they want to make sure you know that that is the killer once you see him
---
Ok, I see the misunderstanding now :P I assumed, that this perk is made just to block escape routes for greedy survivors who stay at the gen for as long as they can, no matter how close the killer is (devs were talking about survivor finishing a gen in a shack and then being unable to run killer around the window there).
---
And you assumed that it's about blocking loop possibilieties for survivor that is already chased, when other survivors pop the gen nearby :P It also can be a way of using this perk, but you would need a lot of luck to chase someone near the gen when other survivors are about to pop it.
---
Maybe I didn't make i clear enough, if so, I'm sorry :P
---
sometimes I have a string of bad games and go ‚Äúbugger putting anything into this game‚Äù. And then I die, break even and feel justified for my decision lol.
---
Lol I'm out making money how am I mad about Gen rushing young man, I don't need Hex Ruin to destroy a swf with the clown like you do lol im just not gone act like it's not a problem though like I said it's a suggestion. I don't want to waste a perk  slot for something that gets destroyed in 30secs to 1 minutes
---
If the Devs wanted Small Game to have a totem counter they would already have given it one.
---
Because Ash was actually voiced by Bruce Campbell.
---
So a basic build I see, it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to change it up a bit.
---
Obviously. It's an "if" scenario.
---
Looks like two max
---
I agree with you. Do you think it's possible people would get tired of the meta builds though? Honestly that's my issue. I play both sides as well, and no matter what side I play the game seems so bland- and it's not due to the devs in all honesty. 
---
The killer treats every survivor the same because they always run identical builds, and you almost always know what to expect from a killer even with their powers. I think if we get to a point where we're tired of meta and branch out into niches, the game will be more complex and diverse for everyone. We'll have to adapt quickly to each person we play against and actually think about how to counteract the opposing side each match.
---
Overcharge is working as intended.
---
that's true man but people just don't use it at all its dust. i never see small game ever probably in like 1 of 14 games and i personally don't run it, because of other perks just being more viable and keeping me alive to even get to the endgame
---
NOED is already balanced - survivors just like to whine about it.  Adrenaline is literally the better, less counterable survivor version of NOED but if you complain about it you get 800 boosted survivors calling you names.  
---
I don't run NOED (unless I'm leveling a new killer and don't have anything else useful to use) because using it consistently can give you bad habits but it's literally the mirror image of Adrenaline.  Survivors complain that it gives killers kills they don't earn - but Adrenaline gives survivors escapes they don't earn all the time.  If one is OK, so is the other.  At least you can cleanse totems ahead of time or even just cleanse the NOED totem once it activates - there's no real counter to Adrenaline.
---
Surge will be interesting. 12% instant regression is okay but they're going to explode which lets you know which one's they're on and they're going to keep regressing. Pair that with Pop and you have perhaps the ultimate slowdown to the gens.
---
Wow these are all great.
---
A solid good build that helps me survive, could switch it up for mediocre perks but im good lol
---
Why would killer mains cry for a nerf of a killer perk lmao
---
Hopefully they don't fuck this up like they did with Bill's replacement.
---
Plot twist: OP was the one that moried the claudette by dropping a pallet on her head and is now trying to cover up her murder by blaming it on the killer
---
these perks are fucking garbage just as the game
---
Unrelated but it needs to get its own realm.
---
They also said they are not gonna make a clown killer, so I would take whatever they said with a grain of salt.
---
Iron Will + Dance with me + Lithe + Quick and Quite
---
Good news! Blood dissapears too :D
---
If ANY Survivor perks will be nerfed, it will be Inner Strength. Find a totem at any point during the game, and you can heal yourself in 8 seconds, completely ignoring all killer perks that effect healing. Thanataphobia, Coulrophobia, Dying Light, Sloppy Butcher + Add-Ons that apply Mangled, Nurses, all of it get ignored. 
---
Sure, it can only be used 5 times maximum, likely 3 times at most for a single survivor. But Insta-Heals are a 1-time use. D-Strike is a 1-time use. Adrenaline is a 1-time use. They're still used all the time. An 8 second heal that can be used pretty much any time that ignores all healing perks the killer can bring + grants protection from Aura Perks while healing is massive, especially since it can be used multiple times. Pair it with Q&amp;Q/Head On and D-Strike, and you can force D-Strike or get a free heal + a Head On, or escape into a locker mid-chase and fully heal if you last 8 seconds. Probably the best Survivor perk that was added in the update.
---
I'm sure people will always be using the meta, just because it gives them the highest probability of surviving. I got tired of the game for a while though, but new friends playing it and me using random perk builds has kind of rekindled my interest in the game. Maybe a random perks mode would be fun to have implemented in the game at some point (or even a vanilla mode with no perks for both sides)
---
Thats very true but i‚Äôd rather we get a totem count than the devs nerfing it to the ground (they probably will because of the salt) i also run adrenaline and i find it very strong
---
Damn man F
---
Not true. With more *choices* per web you can get your optimal set up WAY quicker. 1 blood web not only gives you a double chance of getting the perk you want from the set, but getting a new perk selection set costs less as well due to the fact that more perks are condensed into one bloodweb, but you KNOCK OUT 2 each one. So 1 mil bp will get you a way larger "selection" of perks as well as more in the bag.
---
Entity: screams in confusion
---
Finally more healing perks than just self care
---
Good huntresses don't get juked, and if they do, they learn the survivor's patterns. Most will juke to the same side every time, so you have to compensate that.
---
The hooks are based on realm, not killer.
---
This is the map that I encounter the LEAST
---
yea like tf
---
Trapper can M1 a trapped survivor and it counts towards STBFL, so it still works.
---
That line was hilarious lmao.
---
It's an instrument of punishment.
---
Some rando on the internets: blahs blahs blahs. I just took a shit, want that for some form? Please don't hurt my feelings through text.
---
Unless theres multiple people running it of course.
---
Holy fucking shit fixated is going to be so god damn good with perks like dance with me, poised and that one jeff perk everyone swore would shred the meta.
---
i want inner strength and second wind for my kobe sprint burst build lmao
---
As a surv/spirit main your best chance against spirit is hard stealth and not getting hit. Once you're hit, you are a loud, easy target. You need to be an exceptional mind gamer, unpredictable and urban evasion is a big help.  Like Nurse, some are just impossible to counter. But the weaker ones, you can defeat in chase. But good luck having team mates that can say the same.
---
People have wanted the ability to see scratch marks as a survivor for a long time.
---
We dont need a totem counter, this will hurt killers. If its for dull totems only you will know how many hex's the killer has, e.g. if it says 3 dull totems at start of trial. Then you it will ruin the surprise of perks like devour hope. No ed is an annoying perk but at decent ranks it never gets used and killers that use it only win with it against bad survivors. The whole point is that if a killer runs no ed and only gets kills at the end, at a high rank they wont pip, yes they may rank up a little but they'll soon get ruined as 4 late kills is simply not enough. NoEd is perfectly fine where and how it is  as it is used for players who arent great at the game.
---
Ohhhhhh okayy well that clears it up lol thanks
---
Not only that but you get 4 perks to select from per bloodweb. Not only you knock out 2 perks each ~50k bp, but you have a way higher chance at seeing perks you'd actually want in your arsenal.
---
Theres 5 totems and four survivors.. odds are you're going to get a single totem, even if everyone is running the perk
---
I've been playing this game since Halloween 2017 and I've got all perks on my P3 Kate. I like to shake up my build either by what rank I'm playing in (low ranks has lots of tunnellers and campers, so I'll probably run DS and Borrowed Time, mid ranks usually run NOED, so I use Small Game, etc.) or I use a random perkwheel. 
---
Small Game really is a good perk, albeit limited in use. However, it becomes harder to use well when you either play solo, since it's unknown whether any other survivors have broken any totems, or against a Trapper or Hag, since their traps also set off Small Game.
---
I‚Äôm loving the Killer perks. Can‚Äôt wait to use Surge on Doctor. Does anyone know if it works with other gen perks like Overcharge and PGTW? 
---
How fast will Second Wind heal you? That could make the difference between it being OP and balanced. I was kinda hoping the effect would be used as an instaheal nerf though.
---
Inner Strength sounds like it‚Äôll be OP, but I think I‚Äôll wait until the chapter releases to make any final judgments. It does seem like a really good NOED counter though. 
---
I‚Äôm liking Demogorgon‚Äôs power, though the pounce cooldown might be too much.
---
This is what BHVR thinks:
---
&gt;Q: [Any info on a totem counter of some sort that would be displayed on the screen? This would really benefit people who solo queue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxqz5/)
---
&gt;A: Hello SP_0101, we have thought about this as this has been brought up a few times. We are unsure whether or not we will put a totem counter in game, or whether a perk such as Small Game might get the counter at the moment. Ultimately, we are looking for the best way to bridge this knowledge gap between solos and swf.
---
The entity takes many forms, cool sketch.
---
So does the entity
---
Fixated might be nice with Sprint burst.
---
A totem counter could be added to Small Game, it would be a more balanced way to do it instead of being default, like the generator counter. 
---
If you look at the bigger picture, by buffing Small Game solo survivors will feel more inclined to equip it. More survivors running Small Game means it reduces the amount of really strong perks they could potentially be running (Adrenaline, DS, Unbreakable, Self-Care, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time etc). Granted that SWF won't be too affected by this change (even though I can see at least 1 crew member running it), the chances of **multiple** solo survivors in your lobby with Small Game is high. 
---
Additionally, having the totem counter showing that not all totems have been cleansed, it will be 100% guaranteed that all survivors with this information will spend some time looking for it and cleansing it (10s cleansing a totem is more time in comparison to a survivor doing a generator while debuffed by thanatophobia). 
---
Finally, the killer might not even be running NOED which means every killer (NOED users or not) will benefit from a survivor running one less meta perk and wasting time cleansing totems. 
---
Win - win situation unless you use and rely on NOED in every game you play, then I could see an argument against it. Personally I dropped NOED from every killer I play long time ago.
---
They have to be put into the dying state by the hit. We don't know how the interaction works.
---
Well, I stand corrected! Thank you.
---
actually yeah, you're right. But, how do you dodge a mori?
---
The issue is what if your randoms are doing totems as well? You can‚Äôt count what they have done unless you see them cleansing one.
---
You already see the aura of a survivor who gets downed
---
If you aren‚Äôt clearing ever totem as a solo then what the hell are you doing lol
---
Damn when i think about it killers will be affected.. there really isn‚Äôt any way to balance it any further idk man survivors are just going to complain i guess
---
Gimme Demogorgon with a Scoops Ahoy! outfit.
---
Yeah, but the more people are running it the worse it gets.  If you have just 1 survivor with it its strong af.  3 or 4, and even 2 sometimes, and its a worse selfcare.  Im talking about survive with randoms obv, not swf
---
Inner Strength seems weak - consider that hiding in a locker while injured results in a pool of blood forming under it. If a killer wanders by, it's a free hook.
---
This is absolute madness, i hope you never get to balance a game, ever.
---
I don't watch stranger things, but isn't it possible that they're controlled by a higher being? Kind of like worker bees vs queen bee? A hive mind that is set to a specific task? Idk if they've said everything There is to say about demagorgons in the show, but if this is the case, it would make sense that the entity got it's hands on one. If I'm right, the entity would take on the role of the higher power in this case, thereby controlling a killing machine for the entities own entertainment.
---
Self care is garbage. Why spend 32 seconds healing yourself (or 40 with SB) when you can do it in half that with a med kit with 32 charges and adrenaline for 3 full heals throughout a game that counters SB and nurses to some extent. Also, that locker healing perk makes self care look even worse that it already does.
---
Do you think second wind and inner strength could work together? Like let‚Äôs say you were able to cleanse a totem before or after getting off a hook. So now you have both these things activated. Now you‚Äôre healed, you get smacked and somehow juked the killer with quick n quiet or something to a locker. Boom healed again? Shoot maybe you can deliverance off your first hook too for that heal in the beginning
---
And it's so perfect for him, too. I love everything about this.
---
Kindred trumps any stealth ability, so it would still counter Insidious
---
I agree. Even if no other survivor is near you, it should give you extra time if the killer is camping.
---
Heh heh heh, try spring bursting away as soon as you finish a gen in front of my face now, Meg...
---
Because it's awful. If they're 32 meters away chances are they're either coming to do the gen already or they don't want to do it and they're passing by. On top of that there's like a million perks that show you suvivors anyway that don't need you to do a gen.
---
OP as hell.  Prestige should give more but that would just cause people who don't have everything to constantly be at a disadvantage.
---
A quick Google search shows the average height in Germany is 178cm... interested to know why you think 180cm is short. 
---
5'11 is not short anywhere, even the Netherlands... for reference Brad Pitt is 5'11 and I would never hear him described as small.
---
Alrighty man thanks for that. Ppl are thinking the same thing.
---
They're obsessed with having killers slowdown before using a secondary power. Clown? Bottle throw slowdown. Plague? Absurd Corrupt Purge slowdown. I could go on.
---
Yeah, they should buff most of those perks. Ideas for almost every perk in this chapter are really cool, but the way the look like... Just to weak to be viable, way too weak to change meta. They'll probably give those perks buffs, at least I really want to believe in it. I'm the most dissapointed with mindbreaker... A perk giving only one status effect is already too situational, but limiting this effect to only 3 secods? And only if gen isn't done in at least 50%? When I heard about this perk on stream I said that maybe it can be somehow used to go the gen and then chase someone who was working on it without loosing distance because of BL, Lithe and SB. Then I looked at the numbers... Basically every killer perk in this chapter is pretty mediocre, situational... None of them are good and I don't think that any of them will a place in any build, except for the Surge, but the Ghostface perk is probably more useful than that and has unlimited range...
---
*laughs in no mither and iron will*
---
uuuuuuuuuhhhh
---
Great optimism
---
Stridor isn't trash jfc have some goddamn perk variety people.
---
Being able to hear survivors from a much greater distance isn't as shitty as it sounds.  Christ.  Some people like to have fun instead of running BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy and NOED
---
The potential of this meme goes *far beyond* DBD sub in my humble opinion.
---
Bit off topic but I love how her facial shape is so different from their other models. With the exception of Jane and licenced characters, her model is very unique. All the original survivors have the same facial shape. I'm proud of the devs for this one
---
Distortion doesn't counter the scream but calm spirit does, also you can't run a future 4th locket perks if you gonna run iron will
---
Except we had every reason to think this was the case as this is arguably going to be their most popular DLC along with Halloween so why wouldn‚Äôt they go all out and get the voice actors
---
Idk might be different because it doesn‚Äôt trump Michael
---
I mean if you're never going to use anything other than the most meta perks in the game, yeah, they wont change much lol
---
Do survivors see that they have Oblivious status effect? If so, stealty killers are getting heavily nerfed because of that.
---
Well, it‚Äôs the truth soooo.
---
Good thing I don't want more DLC's like this one I guess.
---
hmm i often play spirit while listening to music lol and still manage to pull off 4ks... idk man maybe im a good guesser
---
AFAIK yes you lose everything aside from the 3 main perks. I might be wrong tho.
---
The bloodweb changes sound really good. Four perks per level 50 web is going to be amazing. 
---
I actually thought that Oblivious was going to be a Survivor effect because it cancelled out any terror radius perks and I was worried that Survivors could use it to cancel out Doctor‚Äôs terror radius, meaning that his shock would be the only way to increase Madness. I‚Äôm really glad that I was wrong and that Oblivious is a Killer effect.
---
Welp, currently I'm hyped for Ghostface who I'll be buying the next time there is a sale (if he will be part of it). Can't wait to by hyped about ST chapter in few months (when it will also be on sale)!
---
first one is ok i guess? would need to not show which hex it is tho, otherwise haunted would be another wasted perk slot(and we already have enough perks for that)
---
second one is hot garbage that got puked on by a homeless guy
---
third one is broken. 50% killer speed decrease? the fuck? and on an infinite timer too? yeah nah fam
---
Probably a cost issue. They already would've had to pay to use their likeness in the game, so using their voices might've been even more expensive.
---
Second Wind + Deliverance sounds amazing.
---
It appears after X gens are done. X being the number of survivors alive+1. So if 2 survivors are alive, the hatch will appear once 3 gens are completed. If 3 survivors are alive it will appear once 4 gens are completed. The hatch will always appear if only one survivor is alive.
---
https://youtu.be/cdEQmpVIE4A
---
I still wouldn't call it toxic even with the NOED.  Crutched out as all hell but still not toxic.
---
Surge looks meh to me, you'd be lucky to get 2 gens in 32 meters of yourself
---
you lower yourself to their level and then act like youre the one in the right here
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm still kinda confused about hatch spawns myself.
---
AMEN
---
Accordibg ti the descriptin it should
---
Exactly!
---
It's any gen by you, not just ones being currently worked on
---
It says in the first half that "While repairing a Generator with less than **50¬†%** progression, all Survivors are afflicted by the Exhausted **Status Effect**."
---
It gives Exhaustion while working on the gen, which sticks around for 3 seconds after leaving it. If you have Exhaustion already, it's simply paused while on it and for 3 seconds afterwards. You're both right, just looking at different parts of the perk.
---
*take my instaheal*
---
Maybe its cause I'm not a celebrity, but I personally would be stoked just for the opportunity to voice a character using my likeness in a game. I wouldnt have to be paid lol, but it could obviously be different for them. Netflix has licensing on the appearance/likeness, but not on the actor's voices themselves
---
Tier 1 Michael trumps all detection perks.
---
As long as they sound like them, i'll be fine with it.
---
oh, ye
---
Obviously there's gonna be a yellow rarity Dart skin. Just the pattern that he had, the distinct yellow on the butt, to see what he would look like as a fully grown Demogorgon.
---
They‚Äôre just shit subs to self care
---
The killers threatening to send in the video he took as evidence to ban her but she let him kill her because she felt bad it happened and thought she was lagging out at first and then she started clipping it herself to see wtf was going on and then placed herself at Fredwards feet and let him down her to hook her. Is this like a well known glitch/bug? I‚Äôve never seen this before personally.
---
Nope, it can be used multiple times. If you cleanse a totem when it's inactive it activates. After a use it deactivates and can be activated by cleansing another totem. You can't stack charges.
---
&gt;Changes to bloodweb only after level 39
---
My dissapointment is immesurable, and my day is ruined. As someone that tries to prestige killers, this will be hardly noticeable, but I guess it does increase my chance of finding BBQ a bit.
---
This change is big. Now you need 180 bloodwebs to get all tier 3 perks on one character. After update, you would only need 110 bloodwebs (40+(180-40)/2). 70 bloodwebs to grind less. That's huge difference.
---
oh, good point
---
I‚Äôm not right, just trying to make things perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Its balanced if both sides are completely OP or completely underpowered right?ü§£
---
Lol classic.
---
imagine a ultra rare addon that allows you to see survivors but faded like freddy............................
---
What a well thought out response
---
only if you and the other survivor are literally fused together
---
Had to add this one for the survivors. 
---
[Soldier at War](https://open.spotify.com/track/0MZ6bS3V9uR8F5SwegFcvw?si=q4GrT16GQFq1nS4JBRuQMg)
---
Only one I see being used is Surge on certain killers. You won't see any Billies running it, some Huntresses might, and Nurse and Spirit don't really need it. But it will help killers like Doctor and Trapper in a 3-gen situation, or any M1 killer in general. Saves time having to kick a gen if you end a chase near one.
---
It's only 35 seconds within 32 meters of a gen finishing.
---
Small game Buff like this would just Buff the swf even more(3 man at least). 1 could run it and share the info for the other 3
---
I mean BT means that you will have to run Discordance and Ruin or you will get gen rushed out the ass by anyone not just SWFs, that is honestly gonna spawn some annoying ass play styles.
---
‚ÄúGen slut‚Äù i like it
---
I‚Äôm picturing the pounce useful across the gap in the floor at the Badham Preschool and also the holes in the floor of The Game. (Assuming he can leap across.)
---
Well spoiler alert
---
&gt;!El loses her powers at the end of season 3, so if she wasn‚Äôt a child then she‚Äôd probably be able to join the roster no problem.!&lt;
---
Okay but still. Just search for a totem soon as you get in, then you've got the perk saved in your back pocket for later on
---
This would be awesome!
---
samination parodies are the best
---
Sounds like the survivor perks are more annoying for killer than anything, the killer perks have such a short range that I dont think they will be anywhere near top tier
---
You're right. These perks are all mediocre and won't replace current meta.
---
My fellow killers in the lower ranks are there for a reason. They haven‚Äôt figured out that tunneling and camping hurts them. All I can say is play immersed, don‚Äôt give them a reason to tunnel you (T-bagging), and invest in some meta perks until you get out of that shit show. Hope it works out ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
People are people, so they'll go that basement and check it anyway :P
---
I saw it happen on a teammate with sprint burst I think.
---
It might still cause the 12% regression on already regressing Gens though. So if you Pop a gen and no one touches it, and get Surge off near it, it might still regress. It doesn't say if already regressing Gens are immune to it's effects, just that it makes them regress if they aren't. We won't know until the PTB, maybe it will work but will be patched out, maybe it only works on regressing Gens. We'll just have to wait and see.
---
This is a very very niche meme but I like it
---
i have no ideia who you are, but why are u not in my survivor games?  
---
Im still not believing what i just saw
---
RESPECT!!!
---
iron maiden also makes it so that the killer can see the survivors aura. and inner strength and head on itself is good enough.
---
I don‚Äôt play toxic because when I play killer I hate people that are toxic
---
Cruel Confinement seems like so much fun. It might not be rank 1 meta but I'm going to have a blast using it with Leatherface. Flavor wise "locking" them in with you is awesome.
---
Gens?
---
What would Art's power be? Would he shoot people who DS him?
---
I'd rather they remove the protection hits and replace it with safe unhooking if it came down to it
---
What..no its not?
---
I think it activates when they enter the 16m and then starts counting down, whether or not they stay within 16m
---
I missed it at first, I rewatched it 6 times lmfao
---
I'm well aware of that. Laurie, Quentin, and Tapp, all licensed survivors, aren't voiced by their actors. Just because one person is doesn't mean every future licenses character will be voiced by their actor.
---
A much needed and welcomed buff.
---
Strong Mid tier is what I‚Äôm gambling on right now. Definitely not top tier. Also that dash will absolutely help in chases. Looks like a free hit in most situations
---
Mommy Harrington and Daddy Myers in the same game o.O
---
Dead by disconnect
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu528o/if_i_get_urban_evasion_from_nea_can_i_use_it_on/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Mettle of Man as I proposed would move it back to how it was when on the PTB. If it came down to it, removing the protection hit requirement would be fine in order to prevent rapidly stacking it. 
---
Technician I think you read or interpretated incorrectly. The generator would only be rendered silent until it was 25% of the way done (and I didn't specify this but this only works for the first 25%. If the gen is kicked below 25, it will not be silent again unless it hits 0, and noise will behave as normal for it). Not the entire time. And Technician would function as a counter to Surveillance and Discordance, 2 perks that are impossible to tell if the killer has. So the whole "there needs to be counterplay" argument I agree with, that's why I'd want Technician changed to this in order to counter Surveillance in particular.
---
I've been away from the game for awhile (and I never had any killers unique perks) so I may be way off base, but Cruel Confinement seems ridiculously OP.
---
I usually only target the ones who are clearly on a swf, 4 or 3 people teabagging is too much
---
... On insidious Leatherface mwahaha &gt;:D
---
FTFY
---
Any confirmation  for ice cream outfit for Steve?
---
Ghost face, with the power of taking selfies in another corner of another map.
---
I don‚Äôt actually get the fear of moths. They‚Äôre basically goth butterflies.
---
The first one is basically Dark Sense but with Totems so I'd see why you say it's so-so
---
The second one I forgot to say it would give you a 5 percentage every time you fully healed someone 
---
Also having a 20 percentage slower Co-op action speed that you can negate in 4 actions and then add onto it is pretty balanced you gotta be a team player and avoiding the killer ( I know that's very foreign for you Nea mains )
---
And the third is supposed to be another counter to tunnelling, but you actually have to run away from a hook instead of just relying on DS
---
True but Nancy was finally a likable character in season 3, atleast for me. Robin was likable cause she had a personality, which Nancy lacks.
---
First Neate with his fire and pets, and now BHVR with their manual teleports and Hawkins interior. Designers just canmt keep their mouths shut, can they?
---
I wonder if fixated and urban evasion would combo well. Crouching at 120% base speed seems like it‚Äôd make for a great stealth build.
---
I just don't like it. Not saying OMG DELETE THE POST! Just not a fan of it. No big deal and no hate towards you.
---
None of the perk numbers/killer power details are set in stone until they hit live servers.
---
If you have some tips I‚Äôll be glad, just a dirty casul here.
---
don't see anything wrong with that, this game doesn't have an economy
---
No, it also gives Exhaustion if you don't have it. "While repairing generators with less then 50% repair progression, survivors are afflicted by the Exhaustion status effect".
---
AMEN! ENTITY HAVE MERCY!
---
Spend them on copy perks to buy points
---
Yup. He can place tunnels around the map to quickly navigate and apply map pressure. Survivors can interact with them to disable them but during this interaction the Demogorgon can see them and they are applied with the new ‚ÄúOblivious‚Äù status effect.
---
I did and i commented because its true, we know that its sweaty and bit tryhard, but valid becuase the kill is confirmed and wont hold the game longer than the collapse and since we KNOW the game will end and hes not just holding them their (sitting in a corner afk for 5 hours) its not bannable.
---
Doctor with Ruin means shocking survivors to top madness before they finish a gen if you git gud. From there it's easy mode tracking them with your hallucinations and the disorientation from hallucinations, fake pallets, and ruin usually causes DCs. Add BBQ and you're SWIMMING in bloodpoints.
---
Cruel confinement + Tinkerer = Nice.
---
Wow! How original! Haven't seen this suggested yet!
---
Trash it
---
Let's not turn this sub into like League of Legends where kids always cry for some free shit or non-sense requests.
---
The one with the beard. It's a new cosmetic
---
No I totally understand! I mean like is there any change you'd make to the perk -adding or taking things away- to make it more balanced ?
---
Gen tapping is incredibly ineffective so most good players wont be doing it except for the rare circumstance of repairing a gen w/o making noise. 
---
That should probably influence your perk idea a bit since gen tapping doesnt really need to be nerfed.
---
Pennywise could be cool but feels... Unlikely
---
Never going to happen sorry. BHVR already stated they won't be adding a clown killer.
---
LOL How tall is Monto?
---
The actress who plays Selina (catwomen) from the Gotham series would be a good Nea.
---
Edit: I didn‚Äôt fully read lol now I realize you were talking about killers. Lol
---
so basically its a waste if you're being camped/proxy camped?
---
I like this because if you jump in a locker with ds active mid chase, they're either forced to take the ds or let you heal and head on them
---
No, soon.
---
Another daily-player.
---
Watch the Dwight's have inner strength
---
Guys stop fighting, this game is perfectly balanced üò≠üòÇüò≠üòÇ /s
---
It is actually pretty good, so far imo. Some maps are more killer biased others are better for survivor in general.
---
There are
---
Yeah, that's true. I just mean blocking windows and vaults. If you're close enough to the survivor, and/it if the generator is in a rough spot, thats pretty much an Insta-down.
---
When talking about the survivors and the choice for Steve and Nancy due to age, Mathieu said "Obviously they might have outfits that reference things in their past, but they are adults and from season 3" so yeah survivor outfits are confirmed.
---
I RAN THE KILLER AROUND FOR AT LEAST A MINUTE, GIVING MY TEAMMATES AMPLE TIME  TO POP THE LAST GENERATOR AND MY ADRENALINE BUT THEY WERE TOO SCARED TO WORK KN IT CAUSE THEY WERE IN THE KILLERS TERROR RADIUS. AFTER I DIE THEY FINALLY FINISH THE GEN BUT TWO OF THEM STILL MANAGE TO DIE. MIGHT I ADD THE KILLER WAS A BABY TRAPPER!
---
It affects survivors but isn‚Äôt caused by a perk. So far it‚Äôs only caused by destroying the demigorgon‚Äôs Portals
---
Guess I'm waiting to level up from 39
---
Damn that‚Äôs sucks *alot*
---
Every survivor since David‚Äôs perks have been complete memes.
---
yeah it gives other team mates time to get gens done but a smart killer would look at the survivors bar and he'll notice its paused... which can only mean o n e thing ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) but then again... a smart killer wont be face camping unless he/she's pissed lol
---
3 man swf. If the random breals a totem your Plan falls apart
---
I can't wait for that sub to die
---
The problem with gen speed perks is just that, gen speed. It is already pretty quick with organized teams and would be a nightmare. 
---
But in the interest of making it more fair. Only one person can use it on a gen at a time. The perk also falls off towards end game, basically its only viable for the first 3 gens. Could also give it a bp bonus towards all bp gains 30%/60%/100%. 
---
Idk.
---
Someone a couple weeks ago mentioned an idea about killer origin skins. I think it would be really cool.
---
One of you should DC sadly
---
Typical Twitch chat. Nothing new.
---
Bill kinda sounds like a Sim after you fuck with their voice slider.
---
Yeah but that's understandable from a balance perspective. If they could just be next to you and instantly hit you with a bottle/hatchet/ whatever, there would be very little counterplay possible
---
The killer might be a distance away and wouldn‚Äôt see your teammate, esp by scratch marks. And with distortion you can see the killer but they won‚Äôt be able to see you. To me that sounds pretty solid, if I‚Äôm thinking of the perk description for babysitter right.
---
To slow the game down.
---
Can you elaborate please?
---
Not necessarily, I've had it work perfectly even with a 2-man, being the last survivor with a hatch camping Legion (before EGC). I 99'd the last 3 gens, tracked down the remaining totems, popped the 3 gens and managed to escape without his NOED activating.
---
No perk is completely fool-proof. Sometimes your perks help you and sometimes they don't. That's kind of how the game works.
---
Yes that
---
Took me a minute to notice Myers outside the window
---
It made sense with Ash because he had actual voice lines instead of just various grunts and whatnot.
---
BT requires terror radius,  so this works for all killers especially high mobile/teleporting killers like most of the S/A ranked killers.
---
Just run detectives hunch +map instead of small game. Do one gen then run around a bit and every hex totem will be marked and tracked
---
&gt; If they could hear you phase it wouldn‚Äôt be a mind game really because it‚Äôd be far too safe to just slow vault over and leave.
---
So phase and stand still for 3 seconds, they slow vault towards you, and come out of phase and down them. You know, an actual mind game.
---
&gt;She started with phasing being apparent at close range, it made her really bad
---
She started with DIRECTIONAL phasing in her TR which is what made her bad. They never tested non directional in her TR, and by the time people started complaining about Spirit the trashcan that was the legion DLC dropped and all the attention got taken off her.
---
*G R O O V Y*
---
One of the devs said they are not on twitter.
---
Urban Evasion used to not work when you were injured, they eventually buffed it so it did, I hope they do the same here.
---
But Laurie, Tapp, and (Especially) Quentin didn't get the likeness for the actor or whatever, hence Meth-Head Quentin.
---
I see, well it might be okay due to gens being repaired in no time, still some of the perks are kinda too strong (can't paste them cuz mobile) and some killer perks are worse (discordance turning off every time can be abusable so the killer gets multiple times the alert sound), remember that killer perks have to be (or this was the think of the devs some time ago) a bit stronger due to the game being 1v4. Maybe buffs are not the way to change the same perks meta, maybe we need nerfs on the strong ones and *slightly* tweaks on the underpowered ones
---
Teabagging at the exit gate is what real champions do
---
Pallet stun
---
Jesus christ those demogorgon perks are obnoxious
---
Well, yeah. Most perks outside DS/kindred/exhaustion perks (I'm probably missing a few others) are useless if you're being camped/proxy camped
---
Nah man, Killers only double back if they aren't really doing anything else. Most of the time the killer comes back to tunnel the unhooked guy is because the unhooker waited until the heartbeat barely started fading before unhooking.
---
Second Wind is going to be a great perk because it allows you to run to a Generator after being unhooked and you heal while doing the gen instead of taking time off to do the healing yourself. It will be more like Deliverance than anything else, a good perk hurt mostly by how hard it is to turn turn on, relatively.
---
As cool as it'd be, i'm not surprised really. Ash had voices lines whereas Steve and Nancy will just have the usual screams and grunts.
---
yeah, but Michael's power also says it trump detection perks. so they're poorly written. Anyway, Tier 1 Myers does defeat kindred. but he'll rarely hook someone and still be in tier 1.
---
yes we exist

---
They litteraly did
---
They all seem above average to me. Not saying they'll all be meta perks, but they all seem useable at the very least.
---
Even if you delete them, once you get reported in the future for anything, they will most likely find out that you've hacked prestige and it often results in a perma ban. I know someone that got banned 1 year after hacking legacy skins even if they removed them shortly after.
---
Im retty sure that a grab would not trigger Surge.  Grabs dont work with Infectious Fright, and you dont loose a stack of Play With Your Food on a grab. Due to those perk interactions, it would be pretty wonky if Surge activated on a grab.
---
I think so, it completely changes the totems to add an incentive to survivors like chests do
---
Yeah i know. it's a shame because i had a really good game :(
---
Jessica Lange as The Nurse
---
Brant Dougherty as Legion
---
Famke Jansen as Plague
---
then Idk who. Most of them are hard to cast
---
Am I the only one that finds the survivor faces in this game so uncanny that i think the killers look more normal.
---
And when you are prestiging lvl 3 and want to unlock all the perks for a character this change is giving you like a 150% speed increase in doing that. This is a MASSIVE improvement all around.
---
PC
---
They could've made it where they had voice lines, too.
---
She has a Gen focused Perk so I guess that's the one referred to in that article.
---
Killers can also have the choice of closing the hatch or opening a door which both start the endgame timer
---
Plus, if someone closes a tunnel and then goes immediately back to gens, they will probably get yoinked off since the can't hear the terror radius for awhile and their location was given up.
---
The other choice is to stay off the gen even longer depending on how long that effect lasts
---
"I want to stop Gen rushing but refuse to use an anti gen rushing perk because I'm too good but I also can't stop gen rushing"
---
I'm curious about it's interaction though. It says the exhaustion wears off after 3 seconds, so do I just have to stop running for a tenth of a second in chase to be able to use dead hard? Cuz if so, the perk is literally worthless. If it's a 3 second exhaustion timer, it's still pretty bad though.
---
I'm totally using Fixated all the time, just a good overall perk.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is with mindbreaker, exhaustion for 3 seconds isn‚Äôt that bad of a debuff, one that disappears after the gen is 50% done. The only strong part about it is that is require you to walk for a bit after get off a gen to remove it
---
I believe Babysitter is going to be better than you think. Knuckleheads that run to the corner of the map after being unhooked will be harder for killers to find.
---
Also Second Wind looks great for staying productive after being unhooked yourself. Provided the killer isn't camping, you can just run to a gen and get to work while being healed at the same time. It's very efficient.
---
big man big stick
---
Is there a way of messaging behaviour and talking with them about it?
---
Fixated doesn't stack with Urban Evasion in any way but they don't interrupt eachother, since the speed boost from fixated only applies when walking, not crouching or sprinting.
---
Babysitter would presumably work with Distortion as there's nothing indicating that it wouldn't.
---
Mad Grit is at least fun to use, and while I can agree with Iron Maiden being bad I think that Discordance is really, really good. Plague's perks are far from bad either, with Dark Devotion fun in a "No TR Build", and Infectious Fright being currently one of my favorite perks to run due to pure snowball potential and altruism punishes.  
---
I don't like to run Corrupt Intervention, though some people like it.
---
The build most people are probably going to run though us Fixated and Sprint Burst. Lol
---
Kane Hodder as the trapper
---
Not really, it's the exact oposite effect: Oh the survivor's struggle time has stopped? Means someone is in a 16m radius of him! Thanks for the call! Oh I can see this guys' aura and blood puddles in another direction? Guess who I'm NOT going to chase.
---
Slight turn at the end of the lunge already exists, they mentioned it on the stream.   
---
Plus, addons could reduce stun time or increase the turn much like with billy.
---
Camaraderier sounds bad. basically if you get face camped, you get to live 14 seconds longer but only if someone else decides to not do gens and stare at you on the hook. this is a SWF perk only i thinks
---
Or how about the part where it takes nearly 20 seconds to break a portal and you can't hear TR while doing so?
---
What like the pick 20 system or whatever from like cod
---
It's an incredibly good map for survivor. Every single pallet is safe so the killer just runs them like a bad ai with no mindgame potential. If survivors are bad and waste them quickly you can win. If not you lose. Your skill is irrelevant to the outcome of the game.
---
I almost never get this kind of humble ending. It‚Äôs usually a ‚Äùgg ez‚Äù or ‚Äúeat a d*ck sweats‚Äù or ‚Äúlol baby killer‚Äù every time! I even got a comment on my Steam profile complaining that I used noed.
---
He looks fucking spot on
---
...I dont think you know what boosted means... also I never played killer without headphones before Spirit came out. Surround is programmed into the game for a reason.
---
It costs barely anything and it's every 3 months. If you play the game frequently you would be more than happy for  good content. Never thought i'd see a post actually complaining about good content.
---
I like that idea! Only usable on 1/2/3 generators. Could be cool.
---
Imagine having to cleanse NOED twice.
---
You better open those gates fast.
---
I love that Sony issues these bans. I intentionally bait these angry, salty messages so I can report when I'm deranking as insidious camping Leatherface
---
Yeah, if you read the post I replied to, they were trying to claim the killers aren't human because they're technically dead and ghosts/nightmares/ect aren't human. I disagreed.
---
I feel like it could considering the speed
---
Yeah this is basically what happened, there was a bill in my lobby and I knew he was waiting at the hatch bc there were 3 gens done with 2 alive, I slugged to find the hatch but ofc I lost our stand off bc I didn't know hatch grabs were removed, he didn't even do anything all match either, he was hiding most of the time
---
BW change isn't terrible but could be better; something should be added in for the first 39 levels IMO. So nothing is really different until you blow enough BP to get to at least 40 and the real shit doesn't come into play until you max out at 50.
---
Thhis is why this game is dogshhit
---
I dont think he was now that I watched it again. I think HOLDING it slows you down though, which would be fine. Watch the clip of the guy running upstairs and on top of the glass structure, he seems to gain distance while the power is being held since he went around the guard rail corner. THAT clip is what made me believe there was a slowdown, I saw the distance increase and immediately thought "charge slowdown" and didn't even consider "hold slowdown". Again, if that is the case (&amp; right now I think it is) then I'm happy with that!
---
Fixated seems really op combined with sprint burst.
---
You don't need Small Game if you already have all the possible totem spawn locations memorized.
---
This looks cool, like almost all of the perks are team-based (for steve and nancy at least) and I think it will change up some gameplay.
---
The information is more up to date at Tier 1 so it's the best version. Not sure why whoever created it thought the levels of this Perk made sense.
---
Everyones complaining about the teabag. Calm down people. It was a cool clip.
---
Finally some survivor love. I might actually start playing again.
---
and instead of fixing the only think about Legion that was broken, they nerfed a long list of other things that werent broken at all, turning him from a low-tier killer into a below sub-basement killer.
---
A bunch of the dark clothing got changed a while back even though Claudette was really the only problem people had.
---
Sure as hell hope so
---
Well the worst part is that it pauses the timer, so if I lose the killer and want to go to a gen, I have to either wait for my timer to go down, or work on the gen and lose exhaustion for the next chase
---
Though if multiple people run this perk you can run out of tokens quickly and objectives will take longer
---
Um...the pounce is a second power it has nothing to do with his attack. Its like Pig Lunge or Billy chainsaw.
---
Yeah, but there's a new map so might as well for now
---
Like what other perks show other survivors the gen you're working on? Not everyone runs Bond y'know.
---
Refer to above comment. Get Gud? Idk
---
&gt;he hunt a dul
---
i dont think that thrill by itself should be dull considering it does show if your touching totems making it so if someones protecting it pretty hard to get them especially noed
---
*Tunnels Quentin*
---
"Look at little goblin junior, Gonna Cry?"
---
Except the first thing I do when I join a game is try and find all 5 totems. I‚Äôll spend 2-3 minutes find all 5 and then not worry about ruin, devour, or noed the whole game. So, the people using this perk wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed the heal.
---
Those memories!
---
We don't know if Tier 1 Michael is getting the undetectable status or not. Assuming he does get it, his terror radius will be removed yes. If he doesn't it's unsure whether detection immunity stays.
---
Oh thank god so ist like freddy rework two abilities I like this he will definitely be A tier if he doesn't get nerfed thank you
---
What's the point of discordance with fuming tape
---
Yeah I got that but my question was " you're mad over a pallet stun"?...but you kinda answered it already
---
But we have a clown killer. The legion.
---
HEY DONT TALK TO FREDDY LIKE THAT
---
Huntress has been deleted
---
Oh, boo hoo. Least it helps.
---
Oh. my god. gotta make another one with Iron Maiden, Haunted Ground &amp; toth for maximum Inner strength counter-ness.
---
But then killers would be able to have 5 perks too. I know I would love to have 4 perks to choose from aside from the mandatory ruin.
---
You said don't riot if we want more DLC's like this one? Right after mentioning it being more expensive? If you're trying to say anything positive here then this is worded badly my dude
---
It can go through windows
---
Yea or like Ghostface and most new killers. 
---
He has his portals on his main power, and a power where holding it down does an effect thouhg its unknown. He then has his Pounce as a second abliity.
---
I was so hopeful until I saw "Shitpost/meme" ;-;.
---
Legion needs some love, he's the weakest killer now imo.
---
First head on and now inner strength? I‚Äôm loving these Dwight buffs!
---
Okay so he has both so I dont have to always pounce
---
Oh shit. I stopped using MYC a while ago. I gotta remember yo use it right after this chapter launches haha
---
That perk doesnt even really need to be countered tbh, if the survivors are running around cleansing random dull totems and sitting on lockers to heal up instead of literally just healing each other after unhooking i'm happy as a killer. Hell, even self care is faster considering cleansing is 14 seconds, then you gotta sit in a locker for 8, and god knows how much to actually find a totem and a locker.
---
I had one game before prestige and didn‚Äôt wanna change my load out
---
I'm trying to say don't complain for the few extra bucks it's probably going to be, because most of us want more DLC's like this.
---
I still think it will be good when paired with Pop.
---
His pounce only appears when he comes out from a portal(which is slow) and I believe when you attack you can't move the direction of the lunge. So both.
---
Yeah, but most of the killer perks are changes that doesn't really matter or awful changes that give more downside than being helpful (dying light) and the survivor ones being plain buffs or low risk high reward. The actual meta perks for killers are still more viable than the proposed changes here... yeah they can be more game challenging and fun but at red ranks or any competitive killer will be still using the same 4
---
But Survivors 9 times out of 10 hard focus one gen and then move on to the next. Pops good because it just slams the gen they were about to finish, or rushing. 2 gens reached on average, both of which may not even be touched since it happens when they go down.
---
Start a chase, smart survivors always run away from the gen so someone else can finish it. Youre giving it a lot of credit when its a perk that fills a role that wasnt a problem to begin with.
---
Ignor pallet vacumes! Op is not talking about them or how they were balanced! Op is talking about hook vacumes and locker vacumes.
---
I feel you Op, although rare, that 99% hook meter that gets interupted by the killer teleporting from around the hook is very annoying. Locker vacumes are not really a big deal, but I would like them be moved away for constancy. Although, when you really think about it, removing the vacumes would effect less than 0.1% of games.
---
**killer queen has already touched laurie!**
---
Well it won‚Äôt increase running speed so why?
---
*The Pig, with the power of OINK teabagging in a corner of a different room*
---
Thank you, kind stranger
---
pizza time
---
just pizza
---
Dammit, now I want a Creeper as a killer.
---
&gt;Next, not recovering exhaustion on a gen is pretty strong, but not if it's the first 50%. The last 50% of a gen is literally 40 seconds, meaning that you finishing a gen will never stop you from recovering sprint on time.
---
The pausing any existing exhaustion works on gens over 50% also.
---
The under 50% is only to create exhaustion. If you don't have exhaustion and the gen is over 50%, the perk does nothing, but if you just got out of a chase and hop on a gen over 50% your exhaustion pauses.
---
This is the only perk I think is slightly above average.
---
I would love to have a ‚Äúrandomize‚Äù option for the perks, on the survivor and killer menu. It would be nice.
---
Inner strength is definitely gonna be atleast slightly meta so that build will actually have alot of use.
---
Survivors will always complain. You get used to it. If you kill them it‚Äôs never because a miss play on their half. It‚Äôs either lag, a perk being op, add on being op and so on.
---
These are pretty dope!!
---
Can he move while normal lunge?
---
The books and show are god-tier
---
Please tell me I'm not the only one who dies inside when I chase a Survivor into the cornfield because they vanish like a pack of wild Claudettes going into tall grass. I just can't keep up a chase through the corn.
---
BY YOUR MORIS COMBINED, I AM CAPTAIN PLANET!
---
I'm still waiting for another foot video tho
---
Streamer: *breath*
---
Twitch Chat: POGGG OUR BOY OUT HERE BREATHIN AND SHIT pog
---
Btw people who say pog in real life are vegetables
---
And if the killer has neither of these (mobility and chase potential) inherently, the killer is either very weak or that power is relegated to their addons, also meaning they are weak. 
---
When you have only (mobility) but not chase potential, you‚Äôre Legion or Wraith. When you have chase potential but no mobility, you‚Äôre Leatherface, Myers, Plague, Ghostface, and Clown.
---
Way to be dramatic.
---
Blow your exhaustion perk, escape the chase, and instantly work on a gen so youre still useful, and by the time that heartbeat comes around again youve gotten no progress back on it. Now you have to actually do nothing if you want exaustion to wear off. I think its pretty neat.
---
Thats how it works right? If youre already exhausted, doing a gen keeps it from fading? It seemed worded strange.
---
Surge seems mad good
---
Maybe the actors were busy, didn‚Äôt want to or asked too much money! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Yea but its $5 USD for each character if you buy auric cells
---
I would say a small amount of turning should be allowed. If non were allowed, then there will be no point in using it
---
Ok jesus, It's just a concept don't get all pissy about it
---
If you're very Altruistic, Suspicious could be very useful pairing with Well make it
---
Also Ruin goes anyway pretty fast if the survivors know Totem spots and then everybody knows where the killer is when you cleanse it
---
" You can't just have a perk that makes the killer move 50 percentage slower under any circumstance."
---
Ah yes, the " you can't do that because I said so" response, a very in-depth criticism of a concept perk I can see you win most debates
---
The wording certainly reads that way haha. Now we need to see some PTB streaming. If it always pauses exhaustion, then it might go in some high level rotations. It'll be okay, but at least it's not a worse version of a better perk - I'm looking at you, surge.
---
When you exit the locker in Iron Maiden it forces a rushed action, causing a noise regardless of a scream
---
When I play killer, there are times when one person stands out from the group. You know they are the strong one in the group, so you tunnel and you put the MF down. It sucks to have it happen, but it's a legitimate strategy.
---
Sometimes the entire group is just incredibly good. So if I do down some one, I'm putting all my eggs into that basket and making sure I please the entity. Why should my own fun be sacrificed because you can't accept game mechanics?
---
Nothing is worse then, as a killer, being tormented by players who are vastly superior to you in skill. With perfect flash lights and good jukes. If I'm a survivor and get tunneled and die. I can reque, it's not a big deal.. but as a killer I'm subjected to 10-30 minutes of being made a tool for others amusement.
---
Honestly I‚Äôd love a hippie hag skin
---
It's for the perks too. So essentially $5 for 4 pieces of content.
---
The actual demogorgon from dnd
---
they said that if u are already broken, second wind will wait before your longer broken status effect is over before the healing takes place. Kinda sad but it wont work
---
What do you mean by normal lunge?
---
I know was saying when he comes out he can pounce not that he instantly attacks when out of it.

thank you for helping me and giving me tips to improve, i‚Äôll try your suggestions.
---
Natalia Dyer is so cute, they definitely did her justice
---
damn, did I upload twice? 
---
first time seemed to fail, I can't find the post so I posted again
---
You have to walk if you dont want to burn your sprint burst and fixated increases walking speed
---
Good luck finding a game every 30 minutes
---
Nea* FTFY
---
He can pounce at any time though?
---
I love seeing them tbag at the exit gates lmao
---
I'm even nodding üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What you thinking? Too strong for killer? How come? I think it gives them a choice to use up some of their already tight time to get a power back into play.
---
Still doesn't mean we were gonna get voice lines. People are only disappointed because they hyped themselves up for something there was no evidence for.
---
i still dont understand what second wind even does
---
Probably because there are very few landmarks to gauge distance. Its all just random ass rooms.
---
Okay but why is everyone sleeping on Second Wind? Yeah it's got limits, but in a SWF this sounds *damn* good.
---
Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Insta-Heal. 3 Very common things you see in pretty much every trial. One time use each. This isn't one time use, it can be used 5 times across all the survivors, assuming they all have the perk. In a SWF, the people who don't run this perk can just ask the others not to cleanse totems and call them out for each other. Good survivors wont have much trouble finding a totem on their own, they can just look for them between gens or while going to a hook and cleanse them when they have time.
---
That would be a more balanced perk
---
Everyone has a 1M cap, the exception is of a player has experienced a loss of save data and loss of progress due to a glitch/bug these players can then send the required info to BHVR and get reimbursed, on Xbox for instance you can take a picture of your lifetime bloodpoint gains, BHVR can break the cap and return your lost bloodpoints so you can re-buy everything again.
---
What‚Äôs actually really good about it actually is if you tap a gen that‚Äôs regressing while in a chase, it‚Äôll exhaust you which makes it stronger
---
Aaronplaystv.
---
I believe he got free BP'S over some progress wipe his account experienced.
---
You don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it but try explaining to your bosses why the player base is dropping like flies after facing 4 instaheals/Prayer beads/pink Moris 10 matches in a row
---
dosen't change the fact that still ugly
---
Praise the juke.
---
Will surveillance and surge stack? Oink
---
Pretty sure it's only when he appears out allowing him to use it at any time then but if not then I'm not mad that I'm wrong may be happy
---

Was leveling up billy and had tinker on cause I was lacking in perks. I hooked a meg and went off somewhere else so she got saved and about three minutes later after hooking a David I get the gen notification so I go there and find an injured meg who I proceed to kill. She said I tunneled her and I was so dumbfounded.
---
how many times will this god damn video be reposted? it was funny the first 50 times i saw it on this same subreddit
---
lol "Freedy"
---
Fixated sounds awsome
---
the second wind/deliverance combo wont work. Deliverance broken will last 60 seconds and the second wind will only begin to heal after this period. they said this in the stream.
---
Imagine being a scumbag only because you play a video game the way you want to
---
It's a video game mate and that's a pretty huge statement about his character. Could be a fantastic dude IRL but you felt the need to judge him for a playstyle.
---
No, the ponce and portals aren't related, think of it like how Freddies traps and gen teleport dont really relate together.
---
Earn able is capped at 1m. Points given for an account wipe there is no actual cap and the amount is based on what BHVR figured you would need to get back to around where you were before the wipe.
---
Camaraderie is going to get exploited by toxic swf groups i swear.
---
Perfection
---
If all four survivors are alive, it will take some teamwork, but a 3 gen is easily winnable. If the killer can kill someone, and then get a three gen, then the survivors really should have realized what they were doing. 3 gen is hard to pull off, but definitely winnable by survivors.
---
But with this perk totems will stop being on killer's side, because they gonna literally heal survs. Killers gonna beg to remove totems from the map, lol.
---
All of these plus Deliverance for a "We're gonna be hooked forever" build.
---
Exactly, i dont prestige my characters becauce honestly im to lazy but damn would i get smacked agaisnt that
---
Someone call Life Alert cause somewhere Bill has gone down from those SICK MOVES, shit son!
---
Popgoes the weasel?

WHAT DOES SECOND WIND DOOOOOO
---
Oh well I'm happy they are completely separate but honestly the pounce seems weak even though it's supposed to be like that.
---
New killer: The chin
---
Steve really had a good arc, but scoops tropes &gt;&gt; they showed so much personality than the 3 couples and will.
---
Its kinda the same as a pig lunge. Its a charge up, but has long range and a arc
---
Awww crap dont do that no no no no
---
But killers can‚Äôt be toxic!1!1!11!121!
---
It looks sort of horizontal to me, I would change it to vertical. That might get better results.
---
A swing like a knife swing or hangs harm swing and they can turn during lunge
---
Yea, I'm just adding on to what you're saying not realizing individually means auric cells and disagreeing with the other guy expecting $15 as you were.
---
Whew, I thought I was falling over.
---
And I agree with you on both ends of your statement. This are two other merits that should be enhanced in the killers who lack the mobility and potential to be strong picks in their niches. And Doctor/Pig especially have so much power in their addons that can go into their base and then make their addons more interesting I‚Äôm very surprised more focus isn‚Äôt shifting power out of addons for killers like that.
---
And borrowed time.
