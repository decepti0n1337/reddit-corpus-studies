Big brain ace main

---
---
I can see it now. They would have 1 totem perk, an aura of any kind, and a healing or altruism perk.
---
You can also depip from only getting 1 sacrifice so, definitely not incentivized behavior
---
First survivor I leveled up was Meg because the very first time I played the game, I had a daily for her and I figured if I'm going to play her anyway might as well put points into her.  Then it turned into well, since I've already put points into her I might as well stick with it.  I got lucky because at that point I knew nothing of what perks were good or anything like that and meg has pretty good perks.
---

---
As far as killer goes I leveled them all up relatively evenly, mostly as I played them or as I got daily rituals for them.
---
I could hear the hatchet whoosh noise as it spins in my head while the shoe was midair.
---
Honestly a fact that’s forgotten is it’s the killers playground, your stuck in their with them and they can use you like a cheap Indonesian hooker until you get out that gate or hatch, tunnel, camp, NOED, moris. All part of their toys.
---
I like third seal ;-;
---
"OK Claudette has a tool box, David has a medkit, and Nea may or may not have a hand"
---
Personally I disagree I feel the whole point of it is not ever hooking them to counter decisive strike since they more likely to he obsession 
---
There is absolutely an animation, it's just that the animation gets overridden by the "recently hit and injured" animation.
---
Overcharge can synergize well with Freddy, because it incentives the survivors to wake up, but punishes them as much as huntress' lullaby. Unlike ruin and lullaby, it can't be cleansed.
---
Which turns it into a metaphor for how she sees the world as the survivors kee.......
---
Goddamn it man.
---
Very legal 
---
Thank you SkittlesThompson very cool
---
Sorry, but there are so many killers running NOED on PS4 now that survivors have learned that they have to be totem cleansing machines if they want to escape. 
---
I would really recommend learning to play without NOED. It may seem difficult in the short term, but in the long run you’ll become a much more effective killer. 
---
Thought you were gonna say the survivors knees.
---
A small regression vs. a 50% penalty to repair/healing. 
---
Thank you UgotGINGERFIED very cool
---
Thank you for this. I love it. 
---
That TrU3Ta1ent
---
Killer is always more popular during free weekend because A) New players want to try and B) good killers want to bully survivors
---
Yeah, I realized that from another response. I'm currently running brutal strength, bitter murmur, sloppy butcher, and NOED. Any ideas of what to replace NOED with? Or any good perk combinations?
---
Always buy the brown memes first, they're cheap!
---
It's unparalleled strength.
---
TrU3Ta1ent in the background 😂😂
---
Thanks for this build. I’ve been a Myers main for a bit and was looking for another killer to be relatively stealthy with. Also, the mind game potential with wraith is fascinating as he can move quick to body block their next move. I also love the great speed he gets while invisible to traverse the map quickly. There’s also some fun builds that allow you to be annoying with his bell and terror radius for when I just wanna play around as well lol
---
Probably the stupidest thing you could do to yourself. The only time Freddy is powerful is when people are in the dream world. You're better off using the Slow Game build on Freddy.
---
Jigsaw Piece or Ivory/Ebony Mori
---
Blue Dress
---
Jump Rope
---
Dying Light
---
Thanatophobia
---
Colorophobia
---
Distressing
---
Just gave me an idea :3
---
I think that would be a good balance. I tend to play altruistically and hit totems. (when the killer has NOED it pays off lol) So it would fit my playstyle. I just always thought it was weird that there are perks for breaking hooks, doing gens, opening chests, helping others, but nothing for totems. Its the only side objective not touched by them.
---
Lucky Dwight !
---
Inb4 the NOED whataboutism/false equivalency
---
I’m guessing you’re somewhat new to the game, so I’ll recommend perks you might already have or can easily get. 
---
I really like using A Nurse’s Calling on Trapper; it pairs well with both Sloppy Butcher and his traps. You could run Agitation and try to get people in the basement, which allows you to set up a nice trap maze. Enduring is a good perk for most killers since it means you don’t need to worry about getting stunned by pallets, so you can rip through them in no time. Hex: Ruin is super useful as well, it gives you more time to set up at the start of the match. And Whispers is good for finding your first and last survivors quickly, and for knowing when there are no survivors around so you can set traps without having them instantly disarmed. 
---
Yeah I just looked it up. Im a bit lost on the lore and had to refresh myself lol.
---
I don't know how many times we have to say it. It's not a matter of being OP ( only Frank's mixtape + moonwalk is op ) but we just don't want to play against this killer. He will win the chase no matter what even if he is shit and stall the game with deep wounds. Game will be long, boring af, and chases are one sided.  
---
Legion = DC
---
I loved the how he stood in front of the hook, went back to the hatch, then stood in front of the hook again XD 
---
I LAUGHED A LOT THANK YOU. THIS HAPPENED TO ME YESTERDAY.
---
It doesn’t mean we can’t have another church but I think the devs would want a different building or maybe an indoor map.
---
&gt;Survivor does great all game
---
Stop assuming you haven't been hooked because you're good. I typically avoid hooking Rancor obsessions because they have a habit of suiciding on hook. A lot of other Rancor users are the same. You're not doing good, the Killer is ignoring you.
---
I feel I can sum up the problem with overcharge and Freddy from the last time I posted about it.
---
&gt;The thing is overcharge does technically make the game longer in general. But when you are running Freddy its more of a help to the survivors than a hindrance. Gens are now wake up machines that a survivor can quickly touch mid chase then fail the skillcheck while continuing to run away. That 12 second regression is useless when you have to wait 7 seconds more after they remove your skillcheck to pull into dream. Then probably more time as they manage to find a pallet.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You can see survivors out of your terror radius already. They are required to fail a skill check to get out. If they are on that gen for 20 seconds before they get a skillcheck its a 10 second regression for just the time wasted and even more for the gen regression. 
---
TL:DR Your focus as Freddy needs to be keeping survivors in dream state. Overcharge while allowing for more of a detriment for getting out heavily shortens a survivors time in the dream state pretty much at best giving you a perk that is almost like having an empty perk slot. The survivor will already need to fail a check, you will get that notification. Overcharge allows that check to happen sooner and only gives you an additional 5% regression. 
---
I don't want to 'victim blame' but it's obvious when you're the target of Rancor, you know once the very first generator is powered. That should be your cue to let some one else power the exit gate and play conservatively for the last portion of the match. 
---
Third seal is pretty decent on legion
---
Honestly any map would be cool as long as I get a totem survivor lol.
---
Wow I knew this was bad, but it started in September? Thats really unexcusable when a big chunk of your players has severe technical issues like this.
---
I've seen it multiple times where the obsession gets tunneled at the end and they slug the survivor and wait for the last gen to be powered. Kinda ridiculous.
---
Yeah lol. Totally forgot what we were talking about.
---
He's both broken *and* ineffective. Legion is OP for the one or two survivors whose match he can make hell. He has an extremely high floor, competitively, and a very low skill ceiling. 
---
Why aren't you dodging SWFs?
---
Lol I said generalized survivor there big boi. 
---
Your response "I'm very good I wait until I can insta down and mori later".
---
Like backing out of a lobby?
---
I log my own personal stats starting Jan 1st. I registered more disconnects with other players in the day and day after the reset than the preceeding twelve days combined. 
---
Yeah, it sucks a lot of the fun out of matches, IMO. It doesn't quite ruin the game for killers, but it's pretty unfair to use boosts in a multiplayer game. 
---
Not sure if this link will work but:

---
Eh fuck em play however you want.  If they can't adapt their strategy it's literally their loss.
---
I like the way you think brother ! 
---
Maybe an actual season pass that it’s for all killer for this year and then  they just keep making new season passes every year 
---
And I used a generalized "you" and "Killer" there, so....
---
Leatherface Haiku.
---
Yeah. There's no incentive to face these boosted squads, and there's no consequence for avoiding them. Why not do it?
---
On one hand, this is the exact type of promotion that got me into the game.
---
On the other hand, prepare for a fresh wave of unholy, salty shit slinging on all forums and such
---
Overcharge is the worst perk you can use. 
---
Survivor / map / killer against / Gens repaired by me / total Gens / totems / saves / length of match / BP earned / survived.
---
Anyway, not that you can see it, but, I do have comments marked in the survival column and I indicated any disconnects. For example, I mentioned that in the first three matches after the reset (Dwight, Tapp, Bill) at least one other survivor dc'ed those rounds. The round with Bill against the Hag had two survivors DC at the start and the killer let us remaining two fix the Gens and leave. 
---
paperwork 
---
I WOULD ALSO ENJOY THIS, NOT BECAUSE PS4 PLAYERBASE IS DEAD, BUT BECAUSE IT RUNS LIKE A FUCKING DRUNK POTATO ON CONSOLE
---
It's not that fun to play killer on console. 
---
Check something for me? I think you have a glitch my friend is currently experiencing. Restart your game after getting out of rank 20. When you relaunch the game, see if you're back at rank 20 with zero pips. If that's what is happening to you too, I don't know of a solution. My friend is still trying to figure it out. 
---
Go take your forced pc etiquette somewhere where someone cares. No one here does.
---
Hey thanks mate!

Playing the way the Devs intended they are pretty weak. Cheesing the chase mechanic is broken as there is no counter (aside from No Mither I guess)
---
Not all Kenyans are dark skinned dude..
---
But there always is a pallet or window near the basement.
---
I had this happen last night on the PS4. Not sure. This is the first time that this has happened to me.
---
"HAHAHAHA--*cough cough*--" *dies*
---
Just run sloppy butcher and lag them all to death. 
---
haha yeah its a struggle picking survivor perks as so many are just "meh"! lots are only for very specific situations
---
I'll never laugh at this shit.
---
lower blood points, but guaranteed blood points. plus at lower ranks kids suicide to get the rescue points which leads to the killer often getting more kills. even if you only get one player thats still 9k points guaranteed. if the survivors r noods or autritic u may get a full 38k without having to bother searching for people
---
I love doing this. I'll start off playing wraith normally, searching for a survivor in stealth mode. And then I'll appear and start chasing, and they'll run. But I just keep chasing until I pass them up, and they'll stop and be confused, and then
---
Bing bong.

I know you’re joking, but that sounds like a terrifying killer.

It's snowing on Mt. Ormond. 
---
Why are you booing him? He's right!
---
OK what is this meme?
---
Just happened to me, restarted the game and it worked!
---
Bitter Mumur &lt; Rancor &lt; Discordance
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Rancor gives you the same info Mumur does, except it shows players everywhere, not just around the genny that just got done. The mori that comes with it is just a bonus. Discordance is better imo because it gives you nearly the same information while you can still do something about it.
---
Thank you!
---
Omg thats so cool
---
I had some good moments. I am fairly new and prefer being the killer. But I had a game and every other survivor escaped, and the last killer stayed, dodged most my stuff, was doing all the gens etc. But never left.
---
He stayed til I finally caught him and put him on a hook and was like "Yep this has been the funnest game i've had in a while, and thank you I wanted you to catch me! Most games are so boring, but it is good to have a refreshing change".  
---
This is at the end after game, of course, but I felt proud that together we made a fun game. He improved myself and had fun himself.
---
Its amazing that theres still losers defending this company. My god....
---
That bps...
---
I mean not really? It's been a long time since I was rank 15-20 but I have 600 hours in the game and I have literally never experienced queue times that long on PC. Even on the public test server killer queue times aren't THAT bad. I almost feel like this is intentional hyperbole because there's a system in place that forces bad matchmaking to expedite the queue after a certain amount of time. 
---
PLEASE! 
---
Dont mind if I r/unexpectedjojo
---
Iridescent heads damn. 
---
*In Patrick’s voice* what’s the difference!
---
Okay thanks, I will try again tonight.
---
Nurse. NOED.... Okay bye
---
I always dream of a native chapter🤤
---
“Omg freddy is bad because the memes say so even tho i play him as a chase killer and fuck map control, the key to success right”
---
-All comments
---
Seriously, people need to learn how to play him before throwing shit. He has one of the best stalls in the game and again, ***HE ISNT A CHASE KILLER***
---
"Dont do gens because you should be focusing on unhooking someone who is being camped" um....no lol
---
BREAK. THE. TOTEMS. It’s really not that fucking hard, and don’t bring up I don’t wanna spend x amount of minutes searching for something I might not find. It’s crazy the amount of totems I find by just walking around the map not even really looking for them. But it’s easier to blame the killer for bringing it than it is to blame yourself for not doing them. 
---
Leatherface lacks on something called map control
---
you are dabest. 
---
Why are you complaining about PC queue times if you've never played on PC? I'm not trying to be rude or anything, I just don't really know if I understand what you're saying
---
nice work
---
....did you have a stroke while typing this?
---
That’s the only perk I run! 
---
Nah man its not like gens can be done in 3 minutes. Looping which if the survivor is good will keep a chase going.
---
Only gg’s I get are squads of four people like “gg ez ur trash lmao” after they get all the gens in 27 seconds and escape before I even see any of them once
---
I hope we as a community can welcome in new players rather than turn them away from it. This can only mean more players and that is a wonderful thing.
---
Yep. It's an outplay.
---
Im still learning nurse, one gen left and two survivors left. Downed one on top of the hatch and the other had found a key in the chest. It was the most wild escape I've ever seen 
---
why shouldnt it?
---
How? All you have to do is spam the drop button and avoid flashlights entirely. Feels cheap
---
Because it makes flashlights even worse then they already are and counters the timing required to pull out a flashlight save. Feels unintentional 
---
well, would be stupid uf flashlights had no counterplay, as they are pretty annoying
---
If you like the game.....support it.
---
It's a new concept!
---
Okay so if I drop someone while you're trying to flashlight me, two things can happen:
---
1) I stop the save and get to go back to my prey.
---
2) I could even down you. 2 for the price of 1.
---
An outplay.
---
? I don't see anything
---
*Remove Legion*
---
Only other Claudette's can see it 
---
I don’t follow. I’ve encountered juggling before. 
---
Is this different?
---
I play on xbox too. If you need a teammate message me and I'll give you my ID
---
Does Unbreakable's increase to recovery speed work even if you've already used the ability to get up once by yourself per trial?
---
SEEING A DWEARD MAKE ME GO FUCKING BALLISTIC- IF YOU WEAR THAT COSMETIC FUCK YOU

ALSO CHECK UR FUCKING PING BEFORE GETTING INTO A GAME WITH BAD PING AND ACCUSING ME OF LAG SWITCHING. YOU HAVE AT LEAST ONE BRAIN CELL USE IT.

Hey now, Jason X had a pretty awesome (even if highly unrealistic) liquid nitrogen kill. And some of the dialogue is so self-award and intentionally cheesy.

I laughed out loud at the smile, lmao

Her skill cap is high, and her power useful to learn. You’ll get good at listening for survivors just by her power. I’m a spirit main since her release so if you have any questions lemme know :)
---
Obvy
---
Rank 20 killers rejoice 
---
Always intense
---
Why run self care in a swf
---
Dude, you are not calm here.
---
No one uses Lightborn so its a weak Argument. Nothing wrong with that logic.
---
If you are sneaky enough, you can pull off some saves.
---
And by distracting I mean blinding after a pallet and using something like that pebble perk and Urban Evasion to Trick the killer
---
Spooky!!
---
Lmao I already payed $20 for this plus the money for chapters that *don't* rely on bullshit like this to make me wanna buy them, but sure, me not throwing $3-$4 bucks because of dishonest business practices makes me a filthy E N T I T L E D person right?
---
As a PC survivor main!? well, better listen up ya’ll
---
Guess I'll start playing killer this weekend
---
What perks do you run with her? My build right now is BBQ, Ruin, Devour Hope and MYC. BBQ is great, gives me an area to phase when I’ve hooked someone. Without ruin I always get genrushed. I’ve had some luck with DH but I’m considering removing it for something else. And surprisingly I’ve not had too much luck with MYC, considering her ability allows you to get back quickly.
---
Claudette first survivor I leveled up and Nea first survivor to be prestiged. Pig first killer leveled up and Huntress first killer prestiged. Now P3 for my 2 favorite killers Huntress and Nea!
---
No. I can attempt SWF during peak hours and it still takes forever to find a match.
---
I can play super late night and get matches quickly.
---
So dont play legion against them?
---
It'll be even steven if you kill the other two.
---

If you spent 1500 dollars you'd have a beefy computer, you could run DBD on a toaster PC with a 5 year old graphics card. Consoles have integrated graphics cards that are the equivalent of a hamster on a wheel thing
---
Honestly if there’s less than 3 survivors I always farm. At that point they have 0 chance so might as well just get more points for everyone than be a dick and kill them 
---
I would of I liked it and owned the cosmetics.
---
might want to set some guidelines as to what they are being ranked for. most fun? Most powerful? Most interesting? Favourite design? The rankings change substantialy depending on that.
---
There are perks related to finding totems but indeed no perks directly attached to totems. One thing I always found weird as a Tapp main is that Tapp's "find totems" perk is attached to generators and not, well, totems. I think making Detective's Hunch reveal after cleansing a totem could give it more use.
---
As for perks that are related to cleansing totems there are definetly a lot of options. I think a reverse Thrill of the Hunt could be interesting. Basically a perk that makes people cleanse totems faster as more totems are removed. Either an aura that makes all Survivors cleanse faster or have the perk only affect you.  
---
Honestly even a Survivor perk that counted the total ammount of totems remaining could be great for countering NOED but I have a feeling it would be really unfun to play against especially in SWF. One survivor running the perk could track the total number of totems and inform their SWF group how many remained. And while a 4 man wouldn't have much use for it a 2 man group would know if the randos cleansed any totems.
---
Overall I think there are a lot of options with totems and they could easily make some Survivor perks tied to them.
---
Good point.
---
please be sarcasm
---
Let's delete my power from the game when I literally have to use my power to hit people!  
---
Or I could, you know, *not* do that!
---
Bring Overcharge on Freddy if you want to derank without constantly DCing or going AFK.
---
About the sheeple? Partially. About the video lighting and physics? Definitely not sarcasm.
---
You knew exactly what you were saying and the intention of it. Dont step back now and play innocent. Theres a plethora of ways to phrase that comment that would have been perfectly fine, but you chose to be stupid with your reply. It was entirely unnecessary and everyone else was politely conversing until you jumped on your high horse.
---
People play Freddy like a chase killer, which he isn't. He's a stall killer. I once had a situation where four gens were very close together, and I guarded them for the entire game. Eventually, the survivors who were left realized that they needed to get past me to get to them. Long story short, I got a 3k; the Meg was a coward and hid for the hatch.
---
Literally Pay to Win smh
---
/s
---
Claudette for *immersion* 
---
Nah seriously P3 Ace because his prestige set looks the best and he’s just a good looking survivor. 
---
Dude...Im fine, but you seem to have a very weird experience so far
---
yeah they certainly get faster into the hook, 1 hit faster to be precise
---
I regret everything. Why did you do this Dwight?Why?
---
I'm the one with the weird experience when you lose people even when you spam drop?
---
skill has no factor here, its the fact that it actually gimps our chances of survival, its like using the calamity ring on dark souls (ring makes each dmg you take x2) its something you do just to prove yourself but in no way it benefit the team to have a guy that only can take one hit, has a beacon that says here i am injured here (sure its only 50% of normal volume but its still there) and the fact it can get himself up on its own its pointless because no killer is going to slug a nomither unless it doesnt know about the perk
---
Rancor is flat out better. The one strength Bitter Murmur has is that it reveals auras in the end game and I guess it deletes Distortion tokens as well? But as soon as a Survivor running Distortion sees their tokens go down after completing a gen they'll 99% gens and get someone else to finish them.
---
Mini NOED, free pocket Mori (that basically guarentees use out of other Obession perks like Remember Me and Save the Best for Last), reveal on **everyone** (not just the Survivors who did the gen), with the only downside over another perk being that the Obession knows where you are sometimes which only really matters if you're Wraith. (And if you're Wraith just don't use this perk you honestly don't need tracking perks as Bing Bong.)
---
Play No Mither survivor. Just no mither, no other perk. 
---
Bold to cry when NOED doesn't save you.
---
But yes: "totem spawns are shit" posts are made every other day.
---
Playing as clown and you yeet a bottle around the map just to see if you can get it somewhere, and you reveal a survivor. 
---
R E K T
---
When that one hit takes longer than you taking 6 to die then maybe you are onto something.
---
You are a piece of shit killer who uses perks that down people instantly because you're not good enough to win without it. You try to justify it with many means saying that it is decisive or adrenaline that justifies the perk, but you're just garbage at the game. You're not good, the perks just carry you.
---
Oh, by the way that was a generalized comment about killers. 
---
See how stupid your excuse sounds. I'm not trying to "save face". I'm just calling you ("personal you there") out for being ridiculous with your absurd justification of your unnecessary comment.
---
Yeah I was a bit concerned about how SWF would do it which is why I figured if they through a speed buff and BP bonus it would be okay because unless everyone ran it, it wouldnt do much. Plus they would have to give up a more "Meta" perk for it. Or if its going to be strong put in a downside. Something like you can see auras of all totems but you cannot benefit from seeing any other auras, etc. 
---
Beehive head skin
---
There is no correct answer. Too much will depend on the state of play, what direction they go in, how many generators are done, how many survivors there are, your perks, their perks, if they know what perks you have, if you know what perks they have, the map, how many pallets are down, what addons you’re running, and your goals in starting the next chase. 
---
😂😂
---
Yeah, I'm done crying. Another reply told me that on PS4 basically everyone destroys hex totems ASAP, so now I'm running brutal strength, bitter murmur, sloppy butcher, and unrelenting.
---
No counterplay is the big issue, especially if they're running Frank's Mixtape which is basically a free down for anyone with eyes. Can't even insta-heal to at least try prolonging the chase because "muh mending"
---
Jesus I was making a joke about what she said why am I getting down voted lmao 
---
Should I have posted there instead of here? Didn't know oopsie.
---
Not going to be the Survivor main police (honestly I've been playing Killer more than Survivor and I do use NOED on Killers I'm bad at lol) but you really shouldn't rely on NOED for kills.
---
Your perk build is good and honestly Trapper works fine with any perks though he is rather dependant on addons. (Trap Bags :V) NOED is not a great perk choice for him though you can defend totems fairly decently as Trapper.
---
This is better. Thank you
---
The reason Legion is broken isn't because they're good, because they're not. It's because there's literally no counter to getting hit with the power. Nothing you can do to counter, besides running and hoping they used it too early to catch up. But because of how long it takes them to down you in this manner, they're still a bad killer. It's just unfun to play against a killer that tickles you but you also have no way to deal with them tickling you, lol. 
---
Fear of death seems like bbq but worse. If basement is in a bad spot you get nothing, plus bbq also has aura reading ability.
---
They were most likely the ones trying to be very over-altruistic and going for flashlight saves and body blocks. Slugging is the only counterplay to that.
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny
---
So are Tbagging, flashlight gangbangs, body blocking, gen rushing, pallet looping, camping on pallets, 4 man 99%ing every hook, taking meta perks, wasting the killers time by hiding after the gates are open, and DCing to open the hatch
---
Just because it’s a tactic doesn’t mean it’s not cancer. 
---
IF YOU'RE GONNA TROLL AND BE SHITTY, DON'T DC THE SECOND I DOWN YOUR ASS!
---
Yeah but I'm telling you that you're the only person that seems to be experiencing that problem. I've been on this subreddit and in game a while now and it's very few and far between someone has this problem you're having
---
People rarely run aura reading so seeing totem auras at the price of not seeing other auras would be meta as hell. If it hid hook auras or auras of dying Survivors then it would maybe be bad but other than that it would be a direct upgrade from Small Game with nothing build a build option downside.
---
*Tbh...people like you ruin 95% of my games because they don't wanna play against a "Cartain" Killer. Now if you said Nurse....then thats most people. But they need bp too. But when you say legion. Already this makes me wanna find you in-game and Ruin it for you. Since you wanna ruin it for others.*
---
Well you don't want to be found a second time. :p
---
True
---
Yeah, I've recently realized that (like half an hour ago, when I was just doing match after match). I've dropped it. I'm probably not going to pick it up for a while. It's a huge crutch. And I agree with the bag add-ons.
---
ahhhh i see that does sound pretty shit, its just so confusing how everyone went from saying they were useless to this 
---
Wha- just use your power perks don't help you with that.
---
Haunted Grounds, MYC and Noed as well as rancor
---
Would it make more sense if I sad “she”?
---
TAKES ME 10 MINUTES TO FIND A GAME TO BE INSTA DODGED 
---
Standard Lerys match then? 😂
---
When you're chainsaw sprinting across the map and a survivor walks right into of you.
---
I like the map
---
Yes, yes it would
---
I like it. I hide in a corner upstairs and the killer always runs right past me.
---
The original firecrackers had sound. They were either removed or bugged after the most recent winter update that brought them back. A killer could easily turn away in time if they listened, now the killer *has* to watch the survivor's arm for that mini-twitch they do when they drop them. 
---
I didn't even realize that was Feng's face the first time seeing it lol. 
---
You can see claudettes? Teach me your ways.
---
Man this has been a problem since the clown came out
---
I think this is the best advice. 
---
It’s not tunneling (which is great) and it’s effective 
---
Yooooooooo. Me to. 
---
YEAH I REALIZE THAT NOW. I'M GETTING BETTER AT HIM BUT HONESTLY I STILL LIKE HIM MORE THAN THE OTHER KILLERS, I ALMOST NEVER WIN BUT I DON'T CARE, I JUST KIND OF LIKE STABBING PEOPLE AND LETTING THEM RUN OFF SCARED.
---
jasons a wimpy dumbhead michael would flex on him easy
---
I do the same. It’s just not fair. 
---
Lol hahaha I would crack up if I got this. That is the exact motion I would make as well
---
Funny, I’d say the same thing about someone who disconnects because they lack the skill to win.
---
I play killer a lot and about 50 percent of the time I swing through pallets I shouldn't be able to hit them but I know I'll get away with it anyways even though the weapon didn't even connect. Devs plz fix.
---
Getting hit a mile away after you vault a window is much worse. 
---
I explained to you- disconnecting deprives the killer of points out of pettiness. That doesn’t happen if you hit the hook.
---
That’s the difference. You’re only a bitch if you act a bitch.
---
Had that back in August, but I’d get the rank reset literally every day for almost a full week 
---
I THINK THEY FORGET THAT KILLERS ARE PLAYED BY ACTUAL REAL LIFE PEOPLE AND HAVE A WEIRD DISCONNECT WHEN IT COMES TO BEHAVING/TREATING KILLER PLAYERS LIKE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF IT. ITS LIKE THE PERSON PLAYING KILLER IS JUST A FACELESS ENTITY THAT THEY FEEL ENTITLED TO ABUSE.
---
My issue with this is the fact the every killers name has a capital in it except doctors
---
NOED, and haunted ground would say otherwise. 
---
They fixed that in the ptb by making it so you don’t lose momentum when you jump in a window you will be able to keep running. That should help stop that 
---
Agree
---
Why are you acting like a little bitch and disconnecting because you’re not good enough to win?
---
I mean, by that token, you could also say killers dodge SWF because they know 9 times out of 10, survivors aren't just "playing the game", they're also using third-party voice comms to gain an unintended advantage.
---
Play Myers so they feel the horror
---
Having this too and frankly half my friends have cut their dbd playtime but 80% because of it. 
---
Yeah but any survivor could start a party and voice chat with another survivor in the lobby. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Just a quick yeet out the hatch with 3 randoms
---
I thought Joey was a black dude
---
yup now when you jump out a window you can keep running. thank fuck for that 
---
Even on Pro is it bad, when all 4 survivors get hit my frames drop tremendously and it's just atrocious.
---
Yep I've been able to play one game in 45 mins surviver side. Killer queues are like 4 mins.
---
You're blind if you don't see how much information simply saying "oh shit it's the wraith!" gives.
---
Are we good?
---
I wish they'd stop dlc, and get their devs on optimization and game balance.
---
I understand, different teams entirely probably. But for goodness sake it's unbearable on console. (and I'm a pc player)
---
Not to mention, we need to buff some of our killers, nerf NOED, balance Rancor, balance out DS, and buff some awful perks. Like Left Behind. Instead we got...legion...
---
The only true advantage would be seeing through the killers eyes. I’ve played plenty of SWFs games where we’ve gotten our asses handed to us and being able to talk to each other makes zero difference. In fact, I usually do better playing by myself because I’m not as distracted. 
---
And... that's part of the problem as well? Tf is your point?
---
Nah fam I’m still gonna have to kill you
---
K
---
Next up, Skilled Huntress!
---
Yeah now for all my adepts😅
---
Wow yea great mechanic, waste tons of time to counter a perk that the killer may or may not have, absolutely epic dude
---
That’s fair
---
"why are y'all booing me, i'm right"
---
Hah the way the shoe goes straight up into the air is hilarious
---
I want unbreakable or self care so badd
---
Running sloppy butcher by chance?  There is a bug with sloppy butcher on wraith.  It causes huge fps drops and a visual glitch in survivors where they bleed profusely.   There are a bunch of posts about it already.  
---
yea like I said i feel like my experience is very skewd since I'm playing against low ranks. What rank do you expect me to change my mind?
---
Absolutely agree. Dead Hard is too situational and the amount of "benefit" you get from it is almost worthless compared to any of the other exhaustion perks. It never saves anyone, ever. You can even be hit WHILE IN THE ANIMATION THATS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU INVULNERABLE.
---
By far the crappiest exhaustion perk.
---
This game was listed under recommended games about a week ago in my google play store.  
---
Haha Wtf
---
You cant see it from the killers side. Only effects survivors.
---
at least on the survivor side of things, when they moved to the emblem system it was harder to rank up than it was before. For reference, to get a pip as survivor before emblems, all you needed was **10k total points.**
---
After the change, so many people threw a tantrum because suddenly they weren't rank 1 anymore. Before the change, everyone said Rank 1 was easy and didn't mean anything, and even joked how people do now like "oh i'm not rank 1 material, it's just easy" but when the time came **no one** wanted to admit that they were actually garbage.
---
shhh. you'll get a bunch of survivor mains trying to tell you that you're wrong even when you've slugged the overwhelming majority of dead hard users. 
---
Are you just trying to get the achievement and then ditch Spirit? If not you can just play her and get it naturally. 
---
I love Michaels stalking animation
---
I mean... you can also tell each other what perks the killer has (stuff like Spirit Fury and Bamboozle give themselves away), where hexes are, who the killer is, where they are, etc. etc... Saying stuck like "the only true advantage would be seeing through the killers eyes" is due to you being either horrifically thick, or blatantly obtuse. 
---
Seriously? You can hear his fucking bell when you’re playing and if someone gets downed it’s pretty easy to tell it’s him. You can hear the shape’s music, see if someone is being put to sleep, see if someone is getting shocked, hear the spirit and the nurse, see traps on the ground for the trapper, hear the chainsaw for the cannibal and the hillbilly...there’s all sorts of stuff that gives away the killer’s identity without seeing them. I swear the people who play as killers find any little reason to get mad and quit. 
---
Everybody knows that the real issue with SWF isn't people who know each other or not playing with each other, it's about voice comms. Your point is moot.
---
I havent played on it still. RIP me.
---
It's honestly easier without exposed, just because it's easier to hit them once, then track them while injured while phasing.
---
If you're running sloppy butcher or the addon that gives bleed status then you're abusing a bug (whether intentionally or not). The visual effect will not go away and iirc stacks. (So you can have multiple effects on you at the same time).
---
On PC it's not too bad but on console you'll have 10 fps by the 2nd-3rd swing.
---
I DC against it 100% of the time. Console fps is pretty bad the way it is but reducing it even more is unplayable.
---
DS and NOED both need gutted or changed. 
---
Broken does not relate to balance in any way.
---
Broken means that he isn't functioning properly, which can be the result of poor balance.
---
Legion is a garbage, poopy killer that happens to be violently overpowered in very specific situations, some of which involve abusing the game's mechanics.
---
So many expensive skins... Uuuug
---
The BEST feeling.
---
I’d reckon once you pass rank 10 but I’m sure there are others who’d give you a different number 
---
.................because it is
---
EVER SINCE RANK RESET IVE HAD AT LEAST 2 SURVIVORS DC, LITERALLY EVERY GAME, ONCE THEY SEE IM DOCTOR. 
---
WTF SURVIVORS?!
---
How is it an intended feature, when the hit looks like it obviously should not connect.
---
Because there's nothing to fix. Sometimes I feel like this is a lot of people's first PvP game. Get spawn camped in CS: Go and cry about it. See how far you get.
---
Coldwind Farm, Swamp and the japan map are the worst.
---
Yes it is a great mechanic, killer is very underpowered and it helps gen rushes, i play very little killer and run no ed, it is always destroyed, so people gotta stop saying its bad.
---
When you’re near the in. the. game. 
---
The problem is that y’all are getting upset over what you perceive to be an unfair advantage and people who SWFs are upset because they cant even PLAY because killers lobby dodge constantly. 
---
Lmao bro I've stunned killers before they even swing on my screen and they get a hit even when I play killer I swing early knowing half the time they will hit 
---
Congrats that's so awesome! My friends and I were so close to this but we had one random in our group and they went out of the gate instead. :/ Sad thing was the killer was actually trying to get them to leave through the hatch. Maybe another time. 
---
Beat me to it.
---
You deserve more downvotes.
---
Wait I heard the sloppy one but a addon can cause it as well?
---
Used to do that in bo2 with the dsr
---
Hahaha I’m sorry
---
It's because they are useless. That's the core issue. The only strat they have to absolutely have a chance at ever downing anyone is to tunnel the fuck out of someone, poke them with frenzy and then moonwalk or stare at the floor until you fall. If you try to mend they just frenzy stab you again. This goes on for the entire length of the match. Does that sound like fun to you? 
---
Survivor messed up on their loop but dead hard lets them get the pallet down and away for free. Survivors mess up and go down but they get away to a pallet/safezone cuz ds. Survivors get in a chase at the end but the 5th gen pops and they speed off with adren. Survivors mess up and get hit, throw pallet and insta heal. Survivors get found first but they sprint burst away to a nice pallet or safezone to lead the killer for 5 minutes (which i have done). Something tells me you get survivor rank 1 every season but are still rank 20 killer and play 1 game and get a 4k and think its fine...
---
It might happen someday, but today does not seem to be that day.
---
I was meaning to find someone to do it. Hope it succeeds.
---
if you are already running enduring, you are better off running spirit fury than brutal strength. Bamboozle is also valid though.
---
Let's see... David, Bill, I got nothing for that other guy, and Feng.
---
Thats some big boy lag right there, i've never experienced that and i play both sides. 
---
Those hair curls tho - like, that's 99.9% of the reason why I play her

Not sure if it's a "fact". Marth's de-pip squad made an effort to not work on the same gen. I don't think they were doing it to make their mission harder.
---
You are not worth my time i should've realised that from your first reply. Stop being irrational and maybe you'll realise you are the problem.
---
I hit the wall with my chainsaw as bubba and they ran around the loop into my chainsaw while I tantrumed
---
Thank you lol. They somehow kept joining my games and would get the killer to go after me. Lots of fun to be had!
---
Mista could never play against a 4 survivor squad
---
So you have nothing to say against my examples on bs a survivor can deal with? 
---
lmfao
---
that's what I thought you little shit stain. Can't handle basic facts
---
I don’t have Spirit Fury, but once I get it I’m gonna run it. 
---
Plenty is a strong word. 
---
Anyone know if we are ever getting the NA PS4 DLC sale we were supposed to get in the holiday sale?
---
Your argument isn't worth my time because you are set on the "killers op pls nerf more" mindset. I could sit here and list why your examples don't always work (not everyone plays nurse, not everyone plays hill/lf, not everyone uses enduring). But admit, would you change your mind? No, you'd keep thinking the same way, forever.
---
Alright I guess ill reword my post "huntress is insanely easy against noobs"
---
As someone who has never watched the anime this is from, and couldn't pick it out of a lineup with name tags. 
---
What's the joke?
---
What, how did you guys keep getting into the same games together? I always get different people every time. 
---
In the end did they escape? Or did the killer down them in the end?
---
Currently on our 3rd try as a SWF team of 3 (ranks 12,12 and 8). Waited 5 min, killer disconnected before we hit lobby. Waited for 8 minutes, killer disconnected before we hit lobby. Now waiting about 7 min so far for a new game. 
---
Instructions very clear Claudettes escaped without me getting any evil
---
Nah, Myers gets looped too easily and gen rushed early game
---
I got it for free too. But it was for the ps4
---
Commodius let's you sabo more hooks actually. Throw on a speed add-on and more charges. 
---
Apparently you've never seen the skill check for ds with an unnerving doctor. That shit is so small and random on the screen that it's almost impossible to hit.
---
Damn, I was using Sloppy Butcher. I guess I'll change it, but I really hope they fix that shit, it's a great perk with Bloodhound.
---
Salty much
---
That sounds evil, pop on some beads and dang that'd be some high iq fakes.
---
I'm happy you were able to go against such a kind killer! And this post is so wholesome and nice to see among so many complaints about killers or survivors. I hope you continue to enjoy the game and help out other players 😀
---
I think it's more to do with timing and ping. Unless you have almost perfect ping you will need to throw it earlier. Also I've noticed that the timing of the throw really changes it, if you time it too late even with good ping you'll still get hit.
---
I've had it happen to me as a survivor and I've done it as a killer before. Usually the hit 'connects' while the killer is in the middle of the pallet zone when you throw the pallet down, which is obviously too late. Also if the killer is lunging before getting near the pallet you have to change your timing accordingly. 
---
The easiest way to guarantee a stun without getting hit is to stun them just as they get into the hitbox, depending on ping you might have to throwdown a bit earlier to get the right timing. 
---
Do it and buy leatherface dlc if you don't already have it.
---
Step aside Bullseye
---
We need more players like u
---
Stalk from a distance. 
---
But you’re right, I’ve seen many videos of Myers getting looped, especially at those T buildings. Poor Myers.
---
Meme lifespans are so short now that I literally do not know what isn't stale atm
---
As a Legion main, this amuses me deeply. I had someone unironically say "Nerf Legion" and I almost died inside.
---
Ya I got it for ps4 when it was free and loved it, but after playing it on pc holy cow it's so much better
---
lmao
---
I once paid $20 for Guns of Icarus Alliance and 2 hours later they announced they would be giving away for free for the day
---
Ok thanks
---
Didn’t u already post?
---
I was so excited one game when I saw 3 bloody party streamers, one from the killer. He face-camped the 2 people he caught and no one got more than 10,000 points. Like at least the party streamers bumped it up from that but I feel bad for that Claudette who put up bloody party streamers, was camped, and got 2,000 points
---
TIL there's a Sloppy Butcher bug. That would explain why I see so many killers running it now when I play survivor. I just started playing again after a 5 month break and boy does this game seem more fucked up than ever.
---
I would agree but I can’t afford pc so yea
---
AM plying 5th game and all killers are just camping and tunneling one guy not much fun.
---
You know, you have a point. We have calm and Iron will which make us silent. But we still haven't gotten a perk that makes us not leave blood besides No Mither
---
I didn't realize that, and I've been using SB for so long...
---
It’s really not unbearable, only thing that is trash performance is ormond and red forest because of the rain
---
I've browsed this sub for half an hour. If you say anything good about killers you'll get downvoted and if you talk crap about killers you get upvoted. It's a survivor main subreddit and that upset me, why can't we coexist.
---
It's pretty much never worth it unless you know no one can help you.  You'll know when that is when playing more.  Like if you are on the hook and everyone else is down or dead then you may as well try.
---
A lot of people are quitting because the dc issues are so bad the q times are longer then the matches I bet
---
I agree, i love adrenaline but unless playing swf, i dont get to use it too often. I run adrenaline solely for the fact that it wakes you up from dream world against freddy, but the fact that it also heals you and let's you sprint fast for a few seconds is just a bonus.
---
When you're doing the same but it happens in the cornfield.
---
Just aim down the sight. DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!
---
Easily could if played by a decent player
---
AS. IT. SHOULD. BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
I'm guessing you use it by sort of walking in and out of the perimeter of the whisper to... "triangulate" their general location? I'm sure better players probably don't even need a way to track survivors that actively, but, yeah. I see, thanks!
---
i like to think if i were to play legion once i get back into the game i wouldnt need to do that, because no... that doesnt sound fun. i remember when everyone hated the wraith and i tried really hard to play him fairly and effectively and eventually i got there, im hoping i can do the same with legion. i know theyre not the same and shit for different reasons but its the thought that counts i guess? 
---
I got this because the killer signalled us that he'd derank by doing turning the ready button on and off.
---
I decided to bring a key in case it's true but with the add-on to make sure I don't lose it upon death. True enough, we sin found the killer, Billy was doing nothing but hitting attack button in a corner.
---
The difficulty was showing I have the key and we needed to look for the hatch to my team mates since there's no comm (this is PS4). Somehow I managed to show them the key and some of us went looking for the hatch.
---
We found it, jumped in and nabbed the trophy. 
---
More or less. Resets everyone’s ranks a certain amount 
---
If it's okay then why shout about it? 
---
there's no farting in DBD, uninstall imeeeeeediately. I'd say play both so you can see how things like running making you reeeeeeally easy to see because of the scratch marks which is something that's hard to understand if you never play killer.
---
(BAD MANNERS: ESSENTIALLY TEA BAGGING AND GESTURING TO A KILLER TO TAUNT THEM. OPPOSITE SIDE IF THE COIN FROM HOOK CAMPING OR HITTING HUNG PLAYERS)
---
Just remember it's just a game and no one should give you crap when you lose if you just tryin and learnin
---
He takes perks to counter that nobody wants to run. Everyone is very much stuck on their build and don’t wanna change because it’s always been jack of all trades. 
---
The games fundamentally broken in a way that everyone runs the same things regardless of who they are playin on killer or survivor a large portion of the time. Every match is hex ruin for the killers. Surviors all run 4 outta the same 6 perks. Etc and now everyone just dcs if they get touched
---
2.5.0 isn't even on PC. 
---
Yes, there’s ranks from 1-20 (1 being the best rank) and there’s a rank reset every 13th day of every month where players’ ranks get a little lower 
---
BBQ isn't the best. Pop Goes the Weasel is. 
---
I loved when she crawled away from the hatch to be with him again
---
if they do, just give the entity their IRL and THE DARK LORD will take care of it for you. Just say his name three times in a mirror and viola!
---
Can you feel the pain of buying a game and then seeing it on sale within a few days 
---
nipples
---
well now it's a common meme like the pet the dog meme or shave the monkey meme, they just add this pic to someone's hands but fyi, this is from Naruto, when Sasuke's getting choked from his brother
---
I like how I posted a meme that just says "excuse me wtf" and I put my caption relating it to dbd and a mod removes it for unrelated content :( but this is fine tho.
---
Wowwww. That really sucks.
---
I don't know, some of the characters look like they fart a lot. I'm surprised there's no crapping your pants mechanic for killers to track.
---
GOD I HATE PEOPLE LIKE THAT (THANK YOU)
---
That still makes it over 5 times more common than BBQ.
---
Ahh
---
Yeah it’s meant to be used for beginners to kinda get a feel for the game, plus it’s available on every killer so it’s meant to be that helpful perk !

---
Yikes, looks like no one understands sarcasm 😂🙈
---
What is that perk?
---
Insidious isn't his perk
---
There's nothing stressful about ending the game quickly and moving on to the next one. It doesn't make the killer "shitty" if they don't allow a free farm game simply because of some DC's. 
---
Why do people refer to this "merciful" shit like dying is the end of the world? Last I checked, you can instantly go on to the next game. Sure you might lose a pip, but who gives a damn? Sure you might lose an item/offering, but who cares? Blood points are not a finite resource, and getting them isn't exactly hard. 
---
I use Save the Best for Last, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring on Freddy. Brutal Strength is nice, but you already have two perks to counter pallets and Freddy has a hard time at window loops as well.
---
NIPPLES!
---
yes, it does until you turn it into laugh magic as you have, you beautiful angel here to deliver us from the murder hands of el chapo.
---
I don’t know why some killers have to be that much of a try hard. I don’t care if he kills me after farm but just let me get some BP ffs
---
It was actually confirmed in Dev Q&amp;A session 5 on October 26th 2018 that survive with friends was always intended. 
---
Source: https://youtu.be/gTpZSllfMmw

9:30 is the part in the video you'd be most interested in.
---
You're welcome.
---
these are wonderful thank you, I shall now claim these for my country of America
---
"A lag switch is a piece of equipment installed on a home network that temporarily delays the flow of traffic to the internet. In an online gaming context, the physical toggle can be switched on to delay gameplay to give the lag switcher the upper hand."
---
It can be a physical switch or just a key you press on your keyboard. But honestly you don't even need to lag switch. All you have to do is stream a HD video or download something, anything to stress your internet connection and boom, the survivors will lag like crazy and you will also have an advantage. And the best thing is it's not even bannable because the devs are incompetent and don't ban for people playing on McDonald's Wifi.
---
Even if you have "good" internet" downloading something in the background without cap will cause your internet to be bottlenecked and your game will end up lagging.
---
It is terrifying
---
they belong to the queen of america now and she is very happy with them thank you
---
I’d play killer for a few rounds so you know exactly what the killer sees and hears and then I’d play survivor. 
---
Breaking hooks is only really helpful if it causes someone to wiggle free
---
BBQ and Chili
---
It's ma-am!
---
Why did they think you were hacking? Like did they give a reason?
---
Breaking hooks isn't really viable unless you do a specific strategy.
---
You should get the sabotage meter to 99% and when the Killer is going to hook someone on that hook you run over to it and finish the sabotage. That way the Killer wastes time and your teammate has a chance to wiggle out.
---
If by holding aggro you mean getting chased then, yes, that's team play.
---
No need to report them- their own stupidity is punish enough 
---
My dude, they can still turn around whether they are revealed for 1 second or 5, that argument doesnt stick. The 10 seconds at the end game is nice though. 
---
Giving away your location means little in my opinion. If a solo player sees you for 3 seconds that information isnt going to help them a ton in the long run. If a SWF player sees your location there is a really good chance they knew where you were anyway because they can communicate with other players in the game. Seeing where they all are and a free mori at end game is worth that trade imo
---
Now
---
Or you could just play stealthy at the end game, let someone else open the door, and gtfo as soon as possible when you're the Rancor obsession. I know because I've done it before.
---
We were on the game and I had every top floor Hook was destroyed there was only one hook left on the second floor and then there's the basement. So 5 hooks total after everything was all said and done 
---
I play on PC and queueue times could be kind of abysmal before they Legion came out around the time of the Halloween event (5 minutes or so, but that might be because the event was causing some people to marathon survivors and then marathon killers so it was imbalanced) but nowadays I think a minute or two might be the most, sometimes the lobbies are bugged though, so you may have to remake it when it seems stuck at three people.

I personally use Ruin, Bbq, Thanataphobia and Monitor&amp;Abuse or Sloppy butcher.  I have come accross teams who don't heal against Legion so Thanataphobia punishes them a little bit. Bbq &amp; Chilli can be good as alot of players hide in lockers to avoid it but they think twice when its Legion because you could be running Iron Maiden.
---
SWF absolutely can be unfair if the SWF is actually trying. The game 100% was not balanced around the survivors having that level of communication.
---
That said, it's just part of the game at this point, like NOED, purple flashlights, and DS. It's just obnoxious to outplay a SWF on an individual basis, but have them escape because of coordination (which you can't do anything about as killer, since you can only be in one place at a time and they're communicating your location) and then talk shit in post-game chat.
---
A well coordinated SWF is basically a perk that tells the survivors the rough location of the killer and the exact location of the other survivors 100% of the time, across the entire map. If it were actually a perk, there'd be no question that it was comically OP.
---
people say things, just don't use hacks cuz then you'd be a hack and jesus would also be sad
---
How about a perk that gives faster healing while next to a totem (20% when in 6m range and for lit totem 50% extra); this way you could actually use the totems but risk the exposure to NOED?   
---
I personally dont like the idea of highlighting totems too much, since they are already easy to find.

---
Trapper just lazy af. Puts no effort into, just slashes until they die. Probably wouldn't work well against somebody that can dodge.
---
I literally have all the achievements except for that one and the Legion one. The Skilled Huntress one is undoable if you're not using Iridescent Hatchets and BBQ or you're Scott Jund.

Thank you so much! &lt;3 I def tried to give jules that sort of Titanic era Leo Decaprio boy cut for her tomboyish charm LOL
---
I heard when originally introduced they stayed down forever, but that led to some pretty griefy games so...oooh looks like they stay down for two minutes as a default but with the Saboteur skill they can stay down longer for 10/20/30 seconds more (depending on the level). And Amanda/Pig's Hangman's trick will bring sabotaged hooks back after only 30/20/10 seconds.

Well most people who tbag/taunt are bitches like you want to tbag/taunt fine but don’t cry and be salty when you lose
---
You are the reason I keep playing this game.
---
Difference is,this is a game where real human beings play against eachother for various reasons. Some just want to win,some want to have fun.
---
Its "slightly" different in movies.
---
Just for Steam, or consoles as well?
---
Grabbed a survivor tbagging a hatch when she already beat me to it last night.
---
Guys his post history is nothing but toxicity and comments like the ones above. He wants a reaction.
---
ugh, and then he might get the mask all salty and in his mouth, UGH THAT WOULD BE THE WORST!
---
There we go, that seems way more balanced
---
I once messaged a killer because he gave a coward Claudette (who did nothing besides hiding) the hatch. He said we gen rushed him and that he always gives the last person the hatch and that she also let him chase her (not true he mixed up my buddy and her).
---
I asked him what we the survivors are supposed to do because our objective is repairing gens and leaving. He said we need to loop killers because apparently that’s the real objective for survivors. 
---
They said on a stream they’re finding a way to make it work. It’ll take some time and they said it’s quite important to them to get it into the game
---
If you insist, put a small dab of toothpaste or whipped cream on your screen for a reference point.
---
Its ok to slug survivors to death on Omegablink nurse. THIS IS WAR BROTHER
---
Not really I just want to talk about the fact that it's hilarious that people want manners from a deranged psychopath character
---
 Y'all are "immersed' but why can we not be immersed
---
This guy wins
---
Well it unfortunately doesn't change that much (it's like a sport, and there isn't like an end boss or whatever) but it's cheap and some of the events are a lot of fun AND you seem to not be a pyscho with the need kill everything so you should live a very long time and not stroke out mid-match GOOD FOR YOU~! Honestly that's great.
---
I’m already tracer
---
I didn't know they let animals into bars, tie up your Claudette outside, ladies!
---
I cant see the red outlines on ormond sucks balls
---
honestly I didn't think ANYONE could make them work but wow, what a magician
---
Yeah it is?
---
People need to stop taking this game so serious, you can do what you want and if something happens you dislike you're not forced to stay.
---
Shit ping to dedicated servers will be same issue
---
I got that one by accident actually, we had all gens done and no ed killer. Mate found a key in a chest and we ran towards the hatch, he opened and 3 of us got in. Last person got knocked down. Killer was going to hook him but turned around for the achievement and let us have it
---
pants killer
---
You really had to do it to him didn’t you?
---
Look how ass he is of course he has to cheat
---
....
---
New game mechanic: Shit Your Pants. If the Survivor is hit by a surprise attack, or grabbed off a gen or totem, they Shit Their Pants leaving a brown stain trail to follow for 90 seconds.
---
Dude, I fucking LOATHE the Legion achievement. I'm close to having all the achievements, but that one is giving me so much trouble. So damn many hoops to jump through, I barely have 3 on it.
---
[removed]
---
Don't quote me on this as a fact in the future, but ZubatLEL often says on stream this is an exploit. Considering his game hours and impact on this game + developers regularly watching his stream I would assume they've confirmed to him it is indeed an exploit?
---
Besides, if you do this exploit (I consider it exploiting as well) with the new pickup speed you're actually just a twat.
---
This is how I feel some people describe DS when they're complaining.
---
Now we just need a Killer swinging once and downing all 4 survivors for how they describe NOED.
---
The Ross is strong with this one.
---
I don't use a crosshair, I prefer playing Huntress without.
---
Yes. You can't knock them off they're shoulders if they're off the ground. Also the killer can only do that 3 times before the person gets off anyways, so they can't just do it forever. So it forces them to chase you, so if you aren't going for a blind in a dead zone you can probably stall long enough for the other person to be picked up.

Mcote has shown a pattern of mentioning stuff without really thinking about what he is saying from a PR Angle, the Civilisation quote and 'Pretty good job so far' kinda show this to a extent. He means well but its kinda doesn't Read the room before he says something. Considering Not Queen has to run collateral and backpedal whenever he does that.
---
You certainly are
---
Overcharge also guarantees a skill check, while you can just kick the gen then follow the survivor. Especially since Freddy lets you see survivor's auras, he can kick gens much better than others.
---
Or you could give him hatch...
---
Mmhmm ;)
---
Hahaha thanks, Rip my pips and add-ons though

just according to keikaku

… Pressing a key to drop a survivor is not an exploit, lmfao. I don't care who you say is calling it an exploit.
---
ya, talk to steam support and they may refund you the ten dollar difference so it doesn't impact you loving the game and steam and life
---
Note, keikaku means plan.

Soon™️
---
rank 1 and the ques are complete shit anytime after 9.They range from 30seconds to 10 minutes though normally.I’ve accepted that I can only play survivor when it’s daytime,and killer when its night 
---
if it was that recently you can sometimes contact customer service and they may refund you the difference 
---
Legion might be kinda fucked up in game... But I loooove their design and all the attention artists and cosplayers have given them.

He does not.He struggles as well.But he sometimes gets those boosted players who got to rank 1 without skill.

Oh nice! I'm glad to know they're still working on it, I was curious since I haven't seen anything for a while. Cheers mate :)

steam gifting is sometimes weirdly difficult, you might be buying a version that only works on no US servers but I would check the Steam terms when you buy because it may show what regions it works in and I think North America is all one region for this game...

Lol nah
---
You do realize unintended game mechanics that you use in your favor are exploits right? I guess you could say when the Autohaven rock was a thing it wasn't an exploit either, I simply just walked up there.
---
If they patch this in the future with the notes saying something along the lines of:
---
&gt;Fixed the killer being able to drop a survivor during pickup to avoid flashlight stun.
---
Are you gonna still tell me it wasn't an exploit?
---
C'mon now.
---
I yeeted a hatchet at a hooked survivor over some cover just because they were about to summon the entity and it was about the time his buddies were gonna come for him. I managed to hit a Nea as she was pulling the Dwight off the hook. She was adamant that I was hacking.
---
Plot twist: OP was the killer
---
Neat meme 
---
No Mither+Iron Will+Resilience+Urban Immersion
---
i don't like Iron Will or Urban Immersion in any other builds but this one. it compliments my playstyle really well. i'm not good at looping(more like i don't like it tbh) but i am good and really enjoy taking the chase then breaking it and hiding. to me it works perfect with No Mither cause i can slap Resilience and actually be very helpful with gens and totems. and as i said, i'm good at this chase strategy so i do also buy the time for my team to do stuff while keeping killer busy looking for me.  i could have not used No Mither, sure, but then i'd bleed, you know? means Bloodhound/cloaked Wraith/Rin with Father's Glasses and i'm dead.
---
it also really helps end game, the killer can't just slug you if it's you and teammate. so most likely they will hook you and you just kill yourself so buddy could get a hatch instead of them helping you/waiting till you bleed out on the ground and basically just wasting too much time in game. 
---
I think your doubt is quite funny since you're the one asking so desperately where to get one.
---
Try and practice your aim instead, many good Huntress players can do well without a crosshair. Even if there's nothing wrong with using one.
---
thats a fair prediction, i guess if things keep going the way they are now perk choice will just progressively get more diverse. im not sure i could ever live without my self care/bbq&amp;chilli tho lmao
---
I can only imagine how that feels for the poor killer. RIP my dude
---
Murmur's great, especially if you're a Huntress going for crossmap shots. People don't expect it like they do BBQ, so no one really tries to counter it...the conventional way. However, Rancor has been better ever since Distortion came out. Yes it gives an inferior amount of information, but it's non-counterable. It works on people in lockers and ignores distortion. That information is still invaluable. 
---
The infinite load screen is such a load of BS. I don’t report people for DCing on the old screen currently since that shit happens so frequently, but once were in-game, if you DC as soon as you see the killer, I’m reporting you and probably dodging you too. I had like five games in a row like that, though. Got super tilted.
---
Then you get annoyed because you still need hatchets so you drop them, reload on hatchets, then pick them up and hook them.
---
11/10 would get stab
---
Oh i would be mad too, sometimes I think it’s RNG sometimes I assume all other dull totems were destroyed

I promise you if you do digging you’ll be able to build one that’s superior to the newest model of Playstation or Xbone for the same price if not a little cheaper 
---
I play on PC, EU region, mostly in peak times. As a solo survivor I get lobbies in like 10 seconds. As a killer I get full lobby in less than 2 minutes. Thing is, these numbers are for mid-ranks (I usually play between ranks 12-6 with ranks 5- in late season), and for beginners at ranks 20-16 queue times could be way longer.
---
But game is nowhere near dead on PC: https://steamdb.info/app/381210/graphs/

I *finally* got Adept Pig today, after numerous attempts over days. Great to hear Huntress is even harder...

I assure you I’ve seen it. When I first started out, people did not like Freddy. Even in green ranks people still bitch about it sometimes. 
---
&gt; killer signalled us that he'd derank by doing turning the ready button on and off.
---
What?
---
when i teabag i get facecamped :(

so people who want to play like it's an actual horror game don't count, eh?

75% more muscle, 150% more squeaks from eating pallets. Seems like a fair trade.

Ormond to me seems like it's just the forest map without the trees. Same layout, gen locations, just white.
---
Titles cannot be edited, which is why we corrected the issue in the link flair.
---
I play only solo survivor so i got really lucky one game where the killer had one guy hooked in front of exit gates &amp; the hatch was there too and i found the key in a box: unhook &gt; take a hit &gt; jump through the hatch and rest of the team followed (and luckily the killer didn't grab anyone).
---
&gt;  stop Gen rushing and I won't have to take it everytime I see 3 or 4 toolboxes. 
---
Stop doing your objective 4Head
---
How often do you watch his streams? He rarely gets killers bad enough to spin  more than once or twice.
---
Mmhmmm sure buddy ;).
---
Very convincing 10/10.
---
this episode freaked me out when i was young.
---
this is a good idea but i think its too late for that now, atleast for the old killers. 
---
I think he’s tryna say something else, but it probably comes off worse then he thought. Tbh it’s probably r/accidentalracism 
---
The more you play killer the harder it gets
---
This is the equivalent of me safely hiding behind the B+ on my test, but my mom still finding a way to bash me for not getting an A around it. Those words sting dude.
---
You dont even need to do that, you just need to be optimal with frenzy use and you can still down survivors in a reasonable amount of time. It's not fun.
---
I've never heard of that. I spam the ready button just to mess around
---
It was intented. The devs literally stated that both KYF and SWF were intented since the start but they made KYF first.
---
No need for the reverse bears traps now. She can tear your jaw right here and now
---
I mean, as killer,  I'll randomly spam the shit out of readying up, especially if someone leaves after waiting a good 40 seconds to ready up.
---
I too, have never heard of this.
---
The killer being able to drop a survivor isn't an "unintended game mechanic" either. It's nothing like survivors *truly* exploiting a bug in the game by walking on top of rocks. Last time I checked, walking on top of anything that isn't the ground or a second story floor isn't allowed or a routine game mechanic. Plus, it's not going to be "fixed". There's nothing *to* fix. You all are just whining because the killer's dropping the survivor so he isn't flashlighted.  Spare me the bullshit, please. 
---
Imagine getting salty over a low-tier killer OMEGALUL uninstall the game
---
It’s an intended feature, it’s there to make pallet looping require more skill, if you keep getting hit, you need to throw the pallets down earlier 
---
Look at his other perks, you can clearly see that he doesn’t really have options
---
no
---
You dont need to be good at anything really to be a legion main
---
No. This is in fact a bug/an exploit, not bannable but it isn't supposed to happen.
---
you meg mains are fucking relentless
---
Using an exploit to negate a mechanic isn't "counterplay".
---
Why would I take the pip loss, the survivor can dc just as well. No point in dragging on a game when I can just clean house and get into an actual game
---
touché
---
Boosted killers, with the hit boxes it is impossible to 360 a good killer

Jules is allowed to stab me any day 10/10

I’ve only been playing for a month or two, but I’m surprised this hasn’t happened to me considering I always run noed

Does it say « hoot HOOT» when dismembering its preys or when you hit it with a pallet?

Because you don't understand what "broken" means.

---
It's probably best to spend the first 5-6 games on survivor, just to get the feel of the game (having a team to help out and watch helps) After that, definetly go killer for a bit. Too many players don't actualy have an understanding of how killers work.
---
You are going to have games where you get hammered, morso on killer because thats just how things are ballanced. Unfortunatly the matchmaking is pants and your first game as killer could be up against some really good survivors. But, it's just as screwy the other way around, so you might get really good and end up against a team full of potatoes.
---
&gt;Since there's no way for me to find anyone unless I just so happen to see them or they choose to leave scratch marks
---
Learning the hiding spots and movement patterns help. Tracking perks might tell you where to head, but once you get there, you still have to work to find the buggers. Looking for clues, like the gen going, especialy if it's been kicked, or missing crows can be a real big one. Otherwise, try to listen for them.
---
&gt;Apparently 90% of survivor success stems not from hiding and avoiding killers, but memorizing pathing around very specific building models to widen chase times and waste time, since killers are always faster. "Loops?"
---
Sort of. Loops are more running around one bulding or wall, just circling it as many times as is safe, then dropping a pallet and moving on. Once you find a pallet, you just run around it untill you think the next lap, the killer will catch you, drop pallet, find next one. Just running to where you know there are pallets isn't looping though, thats just good understanding. Don't discount the ability to hide though, stealth players are gods in this game, but most people don't actualy know how to do it. They make dumb mistakes (I remember one Adam who decided he would hide *infront* of the tree rather than behind it.)
---
&gt;As feeling victory in this game, regardless of score, is very feast or famine, is it then best to put off killers until the new player understands much more about the game?
---
It's going to be feast or Famine whatever you do. Even the really good killers are going to have games where they get blasted. Only the sweaty, SWF squads really don't have bad games. Besides, learning killer will help your understanding of the game more than survivors will. Survivors don't know the difference between a good or bad killer or a good or bad survivor. Killers have to understand both.
---
&gt;Is farming up unrelated characters to the one you're using encouraged?
---
Yep. Play your main, spend the points on someone else. Especialy good if your main get more BP due to good perks.
---
Yeah I remember walking around looking for a gen when someone powered the gates and the dull totem right in front of me lit up
---
oooooh that's why most of the people disconnect and leave me alone or with one random and 5 gens to do ... wtf is a fucking joke !!! 
---
Oh I see! So it's only an exploit if it's in the survivors favor.
---
Dropping a survivor isn't an exploit, but when you're doing something that breaks another mechanic of the game because it favors you then it is indeed exploiting.
---
I also find it quite hilarious how you're saying "spare me your bullshit" when this is literally the exact same argument used by ZubatLEL as mentioned in my original post who is a well respected killer main in this community.  I am using his argument because with his explanation and reasoning I can see what he means and I agree.
---
Not only that, but like I ***also*** said there's actual developers active in his chat watching, agreeing and confirming things said and done when he is live.
---
&gt; Last time I checked, walking on top of anything that isn't the ground or a second story floor isn't allowed or a routine game mechanic. 
---
[Rest in peace ZubatLEL for abusing yet another exploit on stream, have fun with your ban. /s](https://clips.twitch.tv/AffluentCrowdedEggnogTwitchRaid)
---
i would like to have more non human killers. scary looking creatures or something like that xd
---
Unfortunately, I think they said doing non humanoid characters would be too intensive, I would love to see the fly or pumpkin head though, they are somewhat humanoid
---
That sounds like a wonderful idea, the chat surely is delightful after one of this funny tricks.
---
The points you get doesn't matter, people should play this game because they want to have fund. The people see that you're cheating...so why?
---
Believe it or not but survivors are able to finish all the gens in 3 minutes, which in it self barely gives the killer any time to really do anything other than get 2-3 hooks. Which aint much. Normally 3 gens will be done by the time a killer finishes his first chase and finally catch the looper. This goes for every killer other than hag and the fucking nurse. But hag wastes time setting up. 
---
Start of game. Survivors spawn and go on seperate gens. Gens take 80 seconds + 15 seconds to get to it. Making it a total og 95 seconds
---
Killer goes looking for survivors 20 seconds at least. The killer gets a good start of chase hit off 10 seconds. Survivor is now running you in 3-4 loops which easely rounds around those 60 seconds. Survivor is now downed. Picks up survivors and goes to the hook can be from 7-20 seconds really. Add all this up and 3 gens should be done by the time you get your first hook. Have fun cause this has 0 counterplay whatsoever.
---
I hate this system so fucking much. Who wants to try and justify the dumping of so many points on a character you despise playing as
---
Did you just call the devs incompetent because they don’t ban people who have poor quality internet? Wow kid...
---
Should have made it NSFW

*Facepalm* No, you idiot, it's only an exploit if someone's doing something in game that the game wasn't designed for/a bug/etc. Like I said: a killer dropping a survivor, even to avoid a blind, isn't an exploit.
---
And funny how someone not agreeing with you works. I don't agree with your or ZubatLEL's thought process, and him being a streamer in this community does not have any weight on my opinions. Spare me the bullshit. 
---
And yeah, that's pretty much an exploit, especially since killers don't seem to be able to go up that rock as well. But you're the one calling for bans, I guess. Either you're really thick or are just being blatantly obtuse, and I hate it when people are blatantly obtuse.

It's meh, i should'v put more effort into it. Like placing my mains on each pic. But thanks for your feedback!

Lol.

I'm not surprised about the lack of killers on console considering how atrocious the performance can be most of the time. I don't quite comprehend how BHVR thought it was okay to update the engine without fixing the FPS issues. The performance was a problem before the engine update, now it's worse. 
---
There isn't one it's just him getting choked which is the meme. It's a bit of a confusing one 
---
Pretty sure that was the patch they got rid of the vacuum that made survivors teleport to the other side of the pallet as soon as they threw it down.
---
I picked DBD up yesterday. 3 hours in and Wraith is my favorite.
---
I had my second game where I just decimated the survivors. So while the last one was limping around looking for the hatch, or doing the last generator, I just followed her. Tried to be sporting. Let her wiggle free a few times. But always ringing the bell so she knew how futile her attempts were
---
Some killers are insta killing me when this happens and at the end game they are like it's not my problem. Yeah i know it's not your problem &amp; it's not your fault but wasting by 5 minutes you can get some of your invested bp, the add-onn &amp; offering you brought and by that way you let that survivor get at least safe pip. 
---
NetEase strikes again.

Its never gonna happen and it would never fit into the game,but i´d love to play as the Xenomorph from Aliens...god i love the Xenos,but they would never fit into this game :(
---
Whenever a new killer comes out, the killers come on here and say he's useless because they are bad with him, and he needs buffs, then they learn the basics of the killer and the survivors come on here and say that the killer is broken.
---
She got a cosmetic for Christmas along all the other survivors. 
---
I'd record it, get the ID of the survivor post-match and send it to Behavior's customer support under the premise of the survivor taking the game hostage (which isn't allowed).

Why should I take the pip loss then?

._. u right, but like technically that was an event pack.

Why is it fair? Why 25% and not 50%? Why only to survivors?
---
Legion 2
---
if you end up having a shit ping, should contact your isp, I'm in the boonies and still have a good ping to people from even the EU.
---
Why should a killer get more blood points for his game becoming easier?
---
Maybe so SWF doesn’t apply to this rule, but I don’t know if behaviour could do this, seeing as everything else they do is really hard for them
---
These guys weren’t even DC names, but man is it tilting to just have people DC cause they don’t like the killer. 
---
But I have noticed DC names are usually toxic, whether it be because they actually DC or they teabag and shit.

From my understanding the DLC was supposed to be on sale but it never went live for na

Me and another survivor randomly encountered one another. I copied his glorious red robe Ace outfit and now we're friends lol.

I don't know, have you maybe once met journalist with homosexual preferences that looked like Dwight? 
---
Frick, I got Bing Bonged. 
---
This and the "return the slab" episode of Courage the Cowardly Dog really got me.
---
Well it wasn't Friday but usually bugs should be kept to Friday bug reports. The Friday bug reports and Offical Forums and looked at a lot more by the developers than random Reddit comments. They're easier to moderate.
---
I'd suggest reposting this in those two places. :)
---
It's just awful on Xbox One. Killer and survivor main with both ranks between 1-10. It's horrendous. This is what happens when the devs don't promise us actual legitimate optimization updates. Drives away people.
---
Because with 3 survivors he will get less BPs.
---
tried this out but it kept messing up for me :/
---
Ok. I will do that. Thank you so much for telling me this!

Oh. Sweet do you have a link so I can see it?
---
Always getting hit though pallets? I'm a survivor main myself and I almost never find myself getting hit while dropping a pallet. If you get hit its probably because they hit you while you were in the middle of the dropping animation and even then it really shouldn't be happening to often. Learning how many loops you can get out of a loop while still being able to have a safe pallet to fall back on is important if you want to do well in your games. The current state of pallets is much better than how it was before, we actually have to use our brains a little when it comes to pallets instead of being able to teleport a few meters in front of the killer on demand.
---
Not queen said optimisation was coming aswell. It's BHVR's problem not just Mathieu's. 
---
Well I did explain better. And no, I'm not angry, actually. You can't tell someone's feelings through mere text. Remember that.
---
Yeah happened to me as well. RNGesus is a bitch sometimes
---
I second this
---
U know when u say “most power” it means he is stronger then nurse, billy, spirit
---
Broken as it breaks the game and has poor design mechanics, not broken op
---
You can get this playing killer
---
Good joke :) 
---
Skilled Huntress trophy requires hatchet down further than 24m 100 times though.
---
Oh that makes more sense as a challenge.
---
Not really. You stop for a split moment. If I remember correctly it’s in the PTB notes 
---
If you had shadowborn on you can just make out that OP had also written in "Claudette" in the title.
---
Nea has less hitbox than Jesus
---
Wut..I guess.
---
Then i guess nurse isn't op either?
---
got mine from a noob killer 
---
I‘m not gonna satisfy you, sorry. 
---
Nope
---
No one killer in this game is ‘OP’, it’s just the player themselves along with your own skill level. You cannot instantly pick up nurse and become a god with her, she takes time and practice. 
---
That timing though... 
---
It's been the same since legion came out. People don't want to be killer as it's just not worth it anymore.the FPS is dreadful and some survivors are getting even saltier with it.

The trick is to go up against potatoes. I had 800 hatchets thrown(I used to play her a lot when I got the game), and 0 long range downs. After I realized there was an achievement for long range downs I started prioritizing it. After 150 hatchets thrown I had 10 long range downs. Also, survivors who are healing at the exit gates are a god send. I should honestly have the achievement by now, but I'm embarrassed to admit how often I have missed stationary targets.

Only try to unhook yourself if everyone else is hooked or dead
---
Did they mention cinsole optimisation again last patch? 
---
I love these posts
---
Last stream*
---
And as a new player here I am proud I got the achievement from escaping from the hook and escaping to the exit
---
You're so full of shit. You're active on this sub and this wraith exploit is regularly talked about anytime the legion isn't being talked about on this sub and you can see it in the game while you're playing. This shit didn't just start happening when you got on. This bug has been in the game for over a solid month now. Don't act innocent like you didn't know. 
---
WHA!
---
I was hoping for that.You know the reason of that specific streak?To show that the worst killer with the worst add-ons can still 4k with skill.He says it a couple of times too.
---
So true. Legion is so hard to play because it’s incredibly easy to juke, and then just as you’re about to catch them they run past you but you don’t notice because there wasn’t enough frames for you to see.
---
Here's hoping he goes up against a full P3 Squadette with DS.
---
wait, freddy got rework?
---
Legion is so incredibly broken anyone can 4k with him on 10 fps, just use franks mix tape or walk backwards
---
He will get it this year at least
---
I played a game earlier where only 3 connected, then the 2 guys d/cd right after getting downed/hooked for the first time.
---
Found the last kate and tried to sit there slapping the Gen so she would know I'm down to farm with her but she bolted.
---
Fast forward 3 minutes of tediously looking for her I gave her the hook for wasting both our time.
---
It’s not beneficial for me to depip and gain just 3.000 BP. Like I said I don’t care if I get killed after farming. Just let me get some points and not depip. 
---
Actually reported
---
Same, I bought Halloween and Leatherface on tuesday and I came back to this. Well, I'm willing to spend some more tho. 
---
Any ideas what it'll be?
---
Yeah, the problem with non human killers are all the animations they would have to do from scratch. When you get down to it there are a ton of animations, Window vaulting, breaking pallet, stunned by pallet, Breaking gen, grabbing survivor etc..
---
Whether you depip or not isn't of concern to me. What OP did here was nice, but to expect people to let you farm is naive
---
noice
---
Watch put bud, all the nurse mains will hunt you down if you even dare say ANYTHING about killers being crybabies
---
They said the Chapter 11 killer is going to be the oldest, so i'd like something like a Victorian plague doctor, maybe something that could be a combination of clown and doctor, the ability to poison survivors and give them debuffs while fucking with their mind.
---
“Just walk backwards lol”
---
*original content*
---
Take your "logical argument" and get out of here , don't you know? This subreddit is only for shitty memes and baseless complaining /s . Real talk though having played both sides before and after all the pallet tweaks i'd say pallets are in the best state they have ever been in currently. Problem is most survivors don't know what a "safe pallet" and an "unsafe pallet" is so they throw them all down at the same time and get smacked for not playing correctly.
---
You mean the Piggy, right? 
---
Had the same situation as killer yesterday. Man, that was cruel.
---
With team members like that they're really putting the "I" in "Team"
---
No mither is a sandbag perk. 
---
Basically, there are 5 dull totems on the map. They randomly spawn, around the map, but usually have a set few places they can spawn on a tile. So, if you've been playing the game long enough, you know where to look on each map tile to find the totems. They're usually a certain distance apart, too. Two won't be right next to one another. 
---
So, if the killer takes a 'Hex' perk, that perk is applied to a totem. The totem that holds their Hex is no longer dull and has a burning animation to show that it is lit. If you cleanse the totem that holds their Hex, then they lose that Hex and all the perks of equipping that Hex are gone. 
---
No One Escape Death or NOED is a Hex perk that only activate when all the generators are complete. So, the totem will not become active until that point. If all of the 5 totems on the map have been broken (cleansed) before the exit gates are powered then NOED cannot activate because it has no totem to apply to. 
---
However, if there are one or more totems left once the gates are powered, NOED will light up on one of these totems. If you're lucky, you can be cleansing a totem just as NOED is applied to it and destory it almost instantly. This is what the OP is talking about. 
---
Hope that helped.
---
Correct. But there is no counter to a great nurse. Like there is no counter to a great 4 man swf
---
Awesome description. Thank you. 
---
I want Vigo
---
Hex: No One Escape Death only activates once all generators are done. It spawns in any dull totem remaining on the map. You can prevent it by destroying all 5 dull totems. Sometimes, as you’re destroying a dull totem while someone is doing a generator, the totem you’re cleansing will be No One Escapes Death, and you’ll be able to save your team 
---
You realize they might be red for you but yellowish for other people, closer to them ?
---
The totems are used for the killer hex's. When you see one that is lit up that's the killer hex. NOED  (No One Escapes Death) allows the killer to hit you once &amp; you're down. For them to be able to use this hex all the gens have to be completed. So, if you cleanse all the dull totems through the game then they can't use this. If their is still.dull totems on the map then one will light up allowing NOED to go into play. You want to cleanse it to get rid of it. 
---
Killer already gets bonus BP since DCing gives them a flat BP gain.
---
"Clever girl ..."
---
Killer that is designed by people who know what is going on and map that is properly cropped.
---
Fucking love it! 
---
A killer who could affect the 5 senses of the survivor with his power.
---
still looking for teammates to do this with, only hard trophy I have left. 
---
I mean, maybe you should take the initiative and back out of lobbies you don't have a good ping in? Just a thought.
---
[You mean this post? Yeah, just look at how much it got downvoted... Oh wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agvh97/when_will_survivors_learn_using_these_things/)
---
Killers hanging around the hook not allowing a save and then going back to the hook if someone manages to sneak in isn’t much fun for survivors.
---
I was letting them get the save though, and didn’t tunnel the one that just got off the hook
---
she is the real killer
---
Even if they're abusing the system region wise, you can see the killer's ping before entering the match. I don't play anything that's above 150. Sometimes I'll even leave for anything 100 or more. 
---
I guess. I don't use them much though, too bright
---
And whether you want to pip or not or get it over quickly is not of concern for me either. 
---
I don’t expect people to farm. But if more people were less try hards like you and were able to have some fun and be causal, this game would have a so much less toxic and competitive community. 
---
&gt;waits 35 minutes to get a lobby
---
&gt;gets farmed and mori’d
---
I noed it!
---
You lose points every time a survivor is hooked, but you regain them if the survivor is unhooked. It's there to punish you if they die on their first hook

Im enjoying SWF games...just killing them all
---
8K and 32k
---
Currently in green ranks, solo queue takes up to 5 mins, swf (I only play with one other person, though) can take anywhere between 5-30 mins depending on time of day. Unready/Ready a few times helps speed up the process sometimes. 
---
Thing is, if you do get into a lobby most killers dodge immediately. Last time I tried to play swf we got dodged 5 times in a row, even without any items or flashy clothes. I just don’t get it. And if you do get into a game it’s just not fun anymore, especially after rank reset 
---
PALLET LOOPING CAN BE HARD AT FIRST BECAUSE YOU WILL FALL FOR THE KILLERS FAKE OUTS AND YOU WONT GET THE TIMING RIGHT ON QHEN TO THROW DOWN A PALLET AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT. I ADVISE LEARNING 360S. THEY ARE SURPRISINGLY NOT THAT HARD TO PULL OFF. WHAT PLATFORM ARE YOU ON?
---
They did, you lose points for the emblem by standing near a hook and barely any bloodpoints if the survivors teammates aren't idiots trying to yolo save them. Leave them on the hook and gen Rush the living crap out of the killer and get out as fast as possible. That your way of punishing camping, and the only way to make people stop doing it. 
---
Even if you're only loosing patrolling around the hooked survivor it's still pretty much camping if it's the only thing you are doing. Still though I don't think the reaction of the survivors was warranted.
---
I typically hook someone, and then go patrol the gens. If the person gets unhooked then that's fine because hopefully I'm already chasing someone else or potentially hooking them. The assumption is that the recently unhooked survivor and the one who saved them are now busy healing, meanwhile I'm chasing or hooking someone else. In this ideal scenario that's 3 people busy doing something other than generators, which slows the game down. Even if the recently unhooked survivor is running Self Care that's still two people not working on gens, and even then one of the other two might be going for a save on the newly or soon to be hooked survivor. 
---
Of course this doesn't always go as planned, and if I know a survivor is in the very immediate vicinity of the person I just hooked then I might hang around the area for a minute to see if can get them, it all depends.

**ｏｕｔ　ｏｆ　ｓｈａｐｅ**
---
i had a game where i was the only survivor who loaded into the game... the killer had no mercy...
---
BECAUSE IT'S DBD AND THE DEVS DONT CARE!
---
What exceptional bait 1.5/10
---
Legion is both. Like nurse, legion breaks the game but requires absolutely no skill while the nurse is one of the harder to use killers in the game. If you get chased by legion you are absolutely going to be downed. 
---
However, no matter if the legion moonwalks or uses franks he’s still not all that lethal, especially when deep wounds has no added effects to injured survivors. Playing legion these ways won’t get you consistent 3 or 4 kill games but just takes all the fun out of the game since survivors have zero defense against him. So yea, legion is underpowered as fuck but breaks the rules of the game while taking zero skill to break them. 
---
I once brought a skeleton key. It got knocked out of my hands, a survivor found it and gathered everyone up. Once I was hooked I saw all 3 auras jump through the hatch. Not gonna lie, I was a tad pissed.
---
Because survivors disconnect when you down them robbing you both of points and rank
---
what are people doing that makes him that broken?
---
Yeah I’m sure. I wasn’t the only survivor bitching about it post-game. I’ve googled it and apparently it’s happened a few times on said map.
---
The best way to learn is just play and don't be worried if you aren't good at first, that's what low ranks are for. I would recommend the Hillbilly to start since he's a decent killer even if you don't have any perks or add ons. Just a few things to keep in mind; don't be afraid to give up a chase if a survivor can loop so just break some pallets and go back to patrol the gens, when at a double window loop in a chase go on the inside between the walls to shorten the loops, keep an eye out for crows flying away (survivor near) or landing (survivor was there recently). Also don't worry about saving add ons for a killer, you'll get more
---
&gt;Press 
---
Idk but everytime ive been playing against him he will hit me and my screen will go black and i cant see anything
---
Oh I want getting at it being bright for strategic purposes, just don't like bright cosmetics generally.  Still, some of them are nice and I use them.
---
Can someone explain this noed?
---
It's a new Huntress skin?
---
are you meme'ing on dc'ing? 
---
You think with dedicated servers we won't get "I didn't check my servers and got into 200+ ms game" posts?
---
I usually let them be, unless: if I have Save The Best For Last and they are not the obsession, then I will put them in dying state. If I have Remember Me and they are the obsession, I will again put them in dying state. If I have Devour Hope or BBQ, I'll take my free stack, but appart from that, I'll leave em be

No my screen will literally go black when he hits me with a frenzy attack. if i mend it will go away. usually he kills me before that happens

That's what I thought because it doesn't make sense to me but there are a lot of people who say it is intended

---
Wouldn't mind Legion being removed. He's just anti-fun to play against.
---
Even with BL he had enough power juice to hop the window, drop down, catch up to me and hit me again.
---
Well, Nurse is also still in the game though, and we all know how boring it is to go against a good Nurse. Don't get your hopes up, Legion is most likely here to stay.
---
Not a chance and here’s why. For one his power has...well, no power against an injured survivor. One of the most effective ways to slow the game down as killer is to force survivors to waste time healing. Smart survivors will just ignore healing and get on gens and deep wounds does not do much of anything since mending takes a whopping 10 seconds. Legion is a killer that pretty much needs ruin to stay up in order to have a good game and nurse doesn’t need ruin at all. So in short legion lacks any sort of map pressure. 
---
Second, legion has zero end game potential. In this regard he is on the same level as Freddy. His power isn’t going to help you clutch and and his speed, even with NOED, is going to hurt your chances of getting a down in the end game. 
---
And lastly, the best nurse player will outplay the “best” legion player (if that could be considered a thing) any day of the week. And besides that while legions power hinders his pressure and end game nurse’s power gives her some of the best pressure and end game potential in the game. There is never a situation where nurse isn’t powerful, but there are situations where legion is. 
---
The only good part of Legion, great job btw
---
When getting hit trough a pallet it doesn't matter if it's a "safe" or "unsafe" pallet because there's nothing like this programmed into the game.
---
Judging by feel pallets have been at their best after the curtain call mid-chapter-patch and have gotten progressively worse with each patch.
---
I just started playing and I hope that doesn't happen :/. I've had 3 times now where stuck on the loading screen (both me and my friend) so we have to leave. It seems really buggy and I don't think it's fair people get banned for that. Or do you mean when people purposefully leave a game? (DC in my mind has always been an unpreventable thing)
---
I'm on Ps4, 50% off.  You'd think it'd be the same on Steam...  Maybe it's a bit of compensation for us!
---
Post op Nea
---
Itd be cool if he had a secondary effect that infected other survivors if they spent a tad too long around an infected person. Push people apart and force survivors to avoid each other
---
Yes and now half of the games I join actually load in and I’m not stuck with an infinite loading screen :) definitely better. I love waiting ten minutes doing nothing only to do another 10-15 minutes of nothing compared to two minutes of nothing then 10 minutes of fun!
---
I kill them first becouse they are injuring the rest of the team by being afk, forcing the others to a 3v1. I kill them first so they don't leach bloodpoints of a match where they did nothing
---
What are the specs on Pc? I owe it on ps4 because I've got a crappy pc

I spent so much time reading manga yesterday that I didn't understand the comic for a few seconds when I read it. 
---
Either the Claudette blends in too much, or literally any one of them DC'd before the bar tender got to say anything.
---
very common on ps4 the killer usually keeps going from ready to unready im the same time cycles then you know its gonna be an idler. Then you grap your luck coins, plunder and etc...
---
Yeah no, obviously it's not intented. 
---
The only thing every gamer ever will agree on. 
---
Zubat literally asked McLean and was told it's not intented.
---
Your correct! That was a hilarious episode! Remember Moe trying to smuggle the whale out of his bar?

Is the game 50% off, or is the dlc?
---
Well I am a p3 nea so you’re technically not wrong

was rooting for the nurse, sorry.
---
wtf lul, that sucks
---
500 hours is not much tbh I am like 3 months into the game and I have 470 hours
---
those the purple offering which prevents hooks from appearing stack?
---
I love playing as killer on console but the toxicity and current state of the game can make it very annoying and sometimes even difficult to kill the most trash survivors and hitting hatches as huntress can either be very far in your favor or very far in the survivors favor.
---
Take the L, keep your pride
---
For me it varies a lot. Might take anything from 5 to 45 minutes (swf usually takes longer than solo). At the moment I'm rank 10 but usually climb up to red ranks. Friends are in the green, purple or red ranks.
---
WEEKLY REMINDER TO ANY POTENTIAL SURVIVOR TEAMATES, IF THE KILLER DOWNS ME OR SOMEONE ELSE LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOOK, DON'T, FUCKING, BODY-BLOCK.
---
BODY BLOCKING IS ONLY EFFECTIVE IF EITHER A. THE KILLER IS JUGGLING THE OBSESSION OR B. THE KILLER HAS ALREADY WALKED A FAIR DISTANCE AND THE STRUGGLING SURVIVOR ONLY NEEDS A FEW MORE SECONDS.
---
BODY BLOCKING THE HOOK WHEN THE KILLER DOWNS THEM RIGHT NEXT TO IT ONLY SERVES TO INJURE YOU AND THEN LET THE KILLER KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE NEARBY.

Thanks for detailed answer!

AND PLEASE FIX THAT STUPID ENDURANCE BUG WITH BORROWED TIME...

Funny thing is that Freddy has one of the best controls in the game
---
Pallets at the most balanced they’ve ever been. Saying that as a partial survivor main. No more suction pallets, but also no more killers ALWAYS hitting you though pallets. They can really only hit you through a pallet if you’re a millisecond too late and they take the stun. 
---
[davidregem](https://gameover-amanda.tumblr.com/post/172297926587/how-in-the-fuck-are-ya-able-to-carry-me-ya-pig) on tumblr it seems.

I mean you are not wrong.That is how I got the achievement myself.And I was borderline trash at killer.
---
Someone made a chef-based survivor perk list not too long ago, and one of the perks was that after popping 4/3/2 totems, they can insta pop the next one they work on. I thought it seemed really neat.
---
Julie looks like she should be wearing a suit!
---
I had a game like this a while ago! At first, I thought the killer was afk but couldn't find him anywhere. That's when I realized it might be a wraith with noed and blood warden. They ended up not having BW but the game was really fun! 
---
Dude I bought the game for the holiday sale 2 weeks ago and I don't see anything as The Wraith. Most perks I see are about NOED, DS, or whatever someone is complaining about. I haven't seen a "SB bug" here.

Lift your camera a bit, looking up some, it will be on the killer's head, takes a bit of practice but it's not that hard. Practice on KYF.

Idk if it still is but the achievement was glitched at one point but ig I got lucky
---
As far as I know, there isn't. And yeah it's definitely annoying
---
Lol you probably won't believe this but I got this with one friend and 2 randoms. We were on crotus prenn asylum and there was only one more gen left to be done. My friend and the randoms were on that gen but I had nothing to do so I just hid in the locker lol. Then once the gen was finished, the hatch spawned, RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE LOCKER. I had brought in a key since I was going to prestige anyways so that was lucky. I opened the hatch, escaped, prayed AND THEN ALSO GOT THE ACHIEVEMENT! It was very satisfying 😂
---
When you close the game during the loading screen because of the recent loading bug its okay. Because when someone leaves before the start of thw game a generator is taken out to make it fair. But if the game already started there is no good reason to dc. If you wanna rage quit then do it and get like an one hour penalty that doesnt let you get into public games. If you need to leave because you got to go you can either run straight towards the killer and stand next to a hook. Then when you get hooked you can die faster by trying to escape and no struggling. This might take a minute but will give you the bloodpoints for the game, won't take 2 pips from you and you won't get any penalty. And if you do have to quit fast a one hour penalty won't hurt you. The only problem this method has is in case you are stuck and can't end the game so you'll have to quit on purpose because you don't have other option. This would take a lot of quitters out of the pool of players and also would make people think twice before the click the "leave match" button.
---
Yeah, they also wrote me after match they didn't got it. It's definitely easier but you need to cross a party of survivors with key and map. 😅
---
Lame. We burned so many things to make it happen over our night of trying to get it. We ran rainbow map on two people ever time plus a key obviously. So much was lost with nothing to show for it. 
---
Completely up to you,but I would.30% off is still a pretty good deal.Which DLCs are you thinking about buying?
---
Not yet, because the game does not register SWF groups once you join a killer lobby. This could change as soon as dedicated servers are introduced this summer.
---
Hell yeah man that’s some good luck.
---
In this match I didn’t have self care so I searched a chest for a medkit but got that key instead so I got my gf and the other two randoms to jump in, but one of the randoms brought a skeleton key so even more lucky. 
---
Yep! OhTofu has a great video on Whispers that further elaborates on how to triangulate with it, but it seems like you get it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kbSJm5U9i0
---
Trust me, "better" players use Whispers all the time. You can't always spot a survivor that's good at hiding, and Whispers confirms whether you're fruitlessly searching in one area or if someone's actually there. Time is one of the most valuable resources in the game and Whispers saves you a lot of it.
---
It's also infinitely valuable for finding that last survivor(s) that is either crouching around looking for hatch or just holding the game hostage for no apparent reason.
---
It might feel like a worthless perk that you forget to even look at it at first, but once you start noticing the icon go on and incorporating it into your gameplay it can be a huge gamechanger no matter which killer you're playing. 
---
Not to be that guy, but some of the things they've promised over the years and stopped mentioning really hurt.  Where's my leaderboards, rank rewards, and Nurse nerfs?
---
I was right about to comment that 😂 
---
Nea is the bartender 
---
I assume this list is for pc. Nurse on console is worse than freddy imo
---
 It really it looks like you tired to body block,
---
Console nurse lady’s and gentlemen. 
---
Nurse still has the skill ceiling, she is just harder but she has the same insane ass potential
---
Wow and i got noed 3 on level 19 yesterday.
---
“What can I get you 2.6 ladies?”
---
Someone mentioned a perk like Hex: Freeze somewhere else but I completely agree with the idea. Hex that when cleansed would freeze progression (or perhaps just drastically cut progress) of generators for 30/45/60 seconds.
---
Who would win:
---
Chad pig VS Shirtless David
---

---
Those are called jungle gyms and they spawn in every map , its a annoying structure to deal with as a killer since the survivors have 4 safe angles, my way to go about it is to never vault them , lure them into taking the window vault whilist going around it and hit them in the other side , 9 out of 10 times youll get close enuff to smack them with the lounge as they vault. Also if you know they are in the safe corner try to come in stepping backwards as they wait for the red stain to spot which way you are coming
---
Not what I was expecting
---
You get rewarded for wasting time (which is good) but the reward is too high, a free escape. It takes away the killers pressure if they had any basically, and momentum from the chase. Allowing a new loop to begin, if you're not Nurse it can be a nightmare. 
---
Not really, it has always been a thing. But it's boring and the results are mediocre unless the survivors are cocky, that's why you don't see it more often. Also it is usually tryhards that don't have the patience to learn how to play the game or, as you said, attention whore streamers.
---
Unless it's a good Hag with Freddy perks. Then you're pretty much fucked. (That would be a gimmick build, with which I'm fine).

yeah if you are spinning that fast i can think of two things change mouse speed on windows or adapt to the speed and move your wrist just slightly.

This 
---
yikes
---
I recommend a different killer
---
Just lost a Nea to this exact situation with a Legion. I found the totem but someone unhooked her and she got tunnelled. Killer only ended up with 8000BP, pretty much guaranteed more if he’d actually played the game and got 0 kills. But RIP Nea 💔
---
Oh my
---
Well too bad, I like Freddy and I gonna play him :p
---
when it comes to balance we're assuming that both sides have equal skill, so a nurse is as good at blinking as survivor in blink dodging. You can dodge blinks, predict where they land, juke or anything. 
---
You can't juke legion, even if you're really good at 360 he has no CD on missed swings during frenzy, so he basically hits you twice at start and 3rd swing follow up in about 10 seconds. You can't run from him,  as he is much faster than you, vaults pallets and windows just as fast as you, there is no counterplay, so in situation where the skill is evenly matched you're fucked against Frank's mixtape legion, you're going to be down in about 15-20 sec no matter what you do (once again, assuming same skill level between survivor and killer, that almost never happens but this is how balance should be discussed).  
---
So yeah, thanks for the condescending comment
---
Noed even on billy pls staph
---
The perk then essentially become "find and cleanse every totem on the map or the killer will be able to one-hit you after you have completed all 5 of the gens". That just sounds like Hex Ruin on roids.
---
I like the map both for killer and survivor
---
Damn he's annoying as hell
---
yip devs need to fix this. it isnt that bad just seems unpolished. it gets bad when killer lobbies keep disconnecting and you have to keep inviting people
---
Virgin miss piggy vs the CHAD huntress
---
After all the hours in this game he is now starting to crack XD
---
Cleanse the totems duh
---
It s useless on Legion anyway!? I ll dc before u get a stack ;D Prestige a real killer...
---
You are not using the optimized version of the sabo build though.
---
Alex toolbox, No mither and empathy, rest are optional but sabo increases hook spawn time by 30 sec, tenacity increases the speed to recover and breakdown = suicide sabo a hook.
---
Hope I'm not forgetting anything.
---
WHEN I HID BEHIND A GEN TO AVOID THE KILLER AND THEY SPENT THE ENTIRE GAME CAMPING ME ON HOOK TO THEN SAY IN POST CHAT THAT I WAS A "T-BAGGING BITCH" WHEN I ASKED WHY THEY CAMPED ME 
---
DUDE. HIDING FROM YOU ISNT T-BAGGING. THERES A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN T-BAGGING AND CROUCHING TO AVOID YOU.  LEAVING THE MATCH BEFORE I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO YOUR NEANDERTHAL BRAIN FRUSTRATES ME BEYOND BELIEF.

625 pts for doing nothing is huge, I agree. 
---
enough to complain on reddit though :P
---
I don't think this particular practice tool works in that way, you can click anywhere on the picture.
---
It's only for practicing the timing. But I do believe you need to flash 'em in the face, I've only ever pulled it off once though. I've managed to get "killer blinded" when a survivor is on the shoulder and it didn't drop them. I'm assuming that's because I didn't have the timing in correctly, so this tool was nifty for me.
---
In agree, it’s. It worth the effort and the clothes are ugly.

---
In what way does my post seem like I’m against it ? I just was stating what it looked like he was trying to do, save him teammate by body blocking but he was a second to late. 
---
This isn't that helpful. Flashlight saves are more about visual queues than they are about timing in your head. Just start flashing as soon as the survivor is at the highest point before they flop down onto the shoulder.
---
I personally play at the rank I’ve been placed and if that means I have to play meta after some time until the next rank reset then so be it. Yeah, if you drop rank to bully people then you probably aren’t the best person to discuss something with. 
---
Still, there are people that drop rank or wait after rank reset so they can mess around and play really casually without being a dick to the other team. Those people coupled with the fact that you can get to rank one and still have no understanding of the game is my reasoning behind the whole “rank doesn’t matter in a discussion” thing. 
---
Judging by the killers i've faced so far, they *need* it...
---
Easy enough to nail Jesus
---
1 extra hit with a purple add on, two without.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees-finally some merch!!
---
exactly...i hate it when i am playing killer and laggy survivor are imposs to catch....some ppl have acted like it doesnt happen...and im like bre...nice survivor main badge you got on.
---
He’s not
---
People who only play one side would understand this game so much more if they played both sides.
---
Of you mean the red stain in front of them then you're wrong as every killer has that, commonly among more experienced killers they do their best to bait people with the red stain or make it so you don't see it, if you don't mean the red stain you might want to clarify more what you mean by red light or you could just need to verify your game files, maybe do a fresh reinstall 
---
He isn't the only killer with red light
---
wait what ? is legion a good killer now ? i bought them when they first released and i remember everyone going crazy trying to come up with ways to buff them 
---
Ah, no not saying you're against it. I just wanted to know if the devs changed their opinion for body blocking and I missed the memo. Just asking since you used the term.
---
Well, I guess if its becoming a trend time to hunt down those totems real quick. Though honestly, unless the goal is to de-pip I don't see why they would do this.
---
Yes he is it was an epic design choice by the amazing devs
---
The first hit has no cooldown and can be followed up directly by a second. Because of this I consider the first and second hit to be 1 hit as thats what it is in practice.
---

---
Love the way Amanda’s eyes look in this 
---
Legion is a lot harder on console. As I said, juking is a lot easier and the frames are so low you can hardly see what’s happening in front of you. 
---
Windows and pallets are a last resort for survivors. You have to outsmart the killer, not loop them untill they give up.

Honestly, this isn't logical thinking. The friends that DC lose all their points.

Do you own tits or have you ever seen tits
---
Haha clever 
---
Apologies for the potato quality, I had issues uploading the clip. 
---
Thank you so much, I appreciate the feedback!
---
I’ve had times where I completely vault the window and I’m on the other side, but then the killer pulls me off the window somehow. I hope they fix this stuff. 
---
Thank you 🖤
---
Are you being sarcastic?
---
Yeah it's ok when the killer sits there and slugs or camps making the survivor on the unable to do anything and all the other survivors get to hold R2 the entire game. 
---
No way! I love blatant insults instead of actual critique :) 
---
Did she hit you to activate the BT effect?
---
No basement /10
---
Buff girls &lt;3
---
honestly i just prestige for the sake prestiging.. it feels wrong to say that i main killer X and not have prestige 3 on him, even if the increased chance for better stuff is bollocks
---
yes, i own a pair of tits, and i also like to draw so i know what a pair of tits look like
---
maybe he just wanted to bait a hit a then unhook you with borrow :) allways happen someone misscalculate it :P
---
If that person has never reached rank 1 even once, then yes.
---
I wasn't insulting it, I was telling you what she looks like.
---
Then you should know that small tits don’t literally sit in the middle of the chest and even with a push up bra will probably not touch ;) thanks for the feedback 
---
You misspelled balanced landing and adrenaline 
---
Didn’t work
---
Eh I’ve never liked tumblr, I’ll stick to Instagram and r/IDAP. Sorry for being shitty. Just isn’t nice to read a bunch of comments shitting on you for something as simple as fanart. 
---
Pretty bold thing to say considering it depends greatly on the map. Having to find and cleanse every totem on the map is without a doubt time consuming and to say it isn't is just plain wrong, especially when you're on a timer to do all the gens before the killer puts you all on your final hook. And as an FYI the newest patch is making totems harder to find. I don't hate NOED all too much, I just think that people viewing "cleanse the totems" and this simple 2 second task is wrong.
---
killers should 100% get more bloodpoints for dcs. the amount of points they get currently is horribly small compared to the amount of points they could have gotten if the person had been sacrificed
---
What if not every round of DbD *needs* to be competitive. Luckily there are also casual players around who don’t have to proof their greatness each round “lmfao”
---
Complete reworks for freddy, legion and doc.
---
I'd prefer better killers to newer ones. Its getting REALLY dull playing nurse.
---
Tried it with 2 friends, we brought a rainbow map with the add-on so all survivors see it when you use it, a key and The Game map offering so we could find the hatch easier ('cause it only spawns on the bottom level). Did all gens, found the hatch and the random was there too. We all jumped in but no one got it :(
---
Some time later I was playing with someone else against an afk Myers on the new map. We did all the gens and opened the exit gates when I started looting some chests. I found a key and then we found the hatch. Motioned to the 2 randoms to come over to the hatch and we all jumped in. Did get the achievement that time ^^
---
But grass hides the blood? and the chase mechanic takes a loong time tl stop if you're still in close proximity so the killer would need to go away then back? and since he is not looking running in grass and in a wierd direction should be a gold enough way to escape?
---
So first if the rage hurts just disable or ignore post messages. Plenty of killers are harsh on survivors too. It goes both ways. Who do you play as? Sounds like maybe you should mix up your characters some if you're still struggling on getting kills.
---
Me for instance as Myers can consistently get 3 kills and 4 if I'm actually trying really hard. But I'm terribly as The Hillbilly and The Hag. They don't suit my playstyle.
---
For matchmaking reasons the community isn't large enough to take Profile level into account in addition to trying to do Rank based matchmaking.
---
Try out other killers, unlock their teachables. Have you played as Survivor? If not, do so. Seeing how it feels as a survivor can immensely help your skills as Killer. And vice versa.
---
First off Welcome to DbD, seconds no perk in the game is Overpowered, NOED can be countered by cleansing totems, Decisive strike can be countered by Enduring, and then there’s Monstrous Shrine.... but anyway don’t get discouraged, survivors die then they get mad and this means the killer is obviously cheating, tunnelling, camping, trash, overpowered or unfair.
---
The whole community isn’t like this don’t worry, just the shitty parts.
---
Keep it up
---
TIL that a survivor on the opposite side of the map being able to instantly tell the other 3 where my totem is, is not "OP"
---
lmao yea, ive had quite a few shitty comments on my previous fanart posts but i took their criticism and made effort to improve, or just joked with them. its nice to have thick skin, especially when it comes to this game and its subreddit.
---
I always poke the butt.
---
I got this by going afk as killer. Made me laugh
---
Julie looks like she's about to go check if Annie's okay. 
---
It's been a problem since they removed the pallet vacuum. You get hit through pallets constantly and get the stun.
---
Minus potential 25% bonus for BBQ, minus all the points I could've get for playing vs that survivor... Do you really think a lot of killers like this "Quitter bonus"?
---
I would argue that DCed survivor hurts killer's BP gain more than other survivors'. Even with "quitter bonus"
---
He means the voice communication was unintended.
---
Ugly sweater.
---
Imagine thinking being a rank one killer somehow makes your opinions more valid.
---
It's not valentine's Day, it's moonrise. (Unless a new one has been revealed that I haven't seen)
---
I prestige cause the grind it fun for me. I get bored using the same perks only to later hate that I dont have them.
---
Hey i like it you did well
---
Thanks man, Ill keep trying to unlock stuff to diversify my play and ignore the bad parts and keep having fun.
---
How would you prevent farming? Especially in those games where everybody (or, let's say, killer + 3 survivors) wants to farm?
---
What is this meme template called?
---
Yeah I guess it’s a lot different when on other platforms ppl follow bc they like you, whereas here anybody sees it whether they like it or not lol. I have 1500+ in game and I try to be a force of positivity, my name has been Non-Toxic Nea for a year now haha 
---
Dude, rude.
---
&gt;Implying they didn't think VC was gonna happen with swf, which was planned to exist from the start
---
You got to pick and choose the survivors to go after. Just last night I was playing as Myers on Red Forest (I think that's what it is called and all 4 survivors were still alive with 2 gens left. I noticed every time I started chasing a Meg she'd Sprint Burst and start running away from all the killers but always made sure to keep me in Line of Sight. It was smart because I didn't want to give up the chase.
---
After a little I came to my senses and simply stopped chasing her and started going after the others. Once I got the easier to catch survivors it snowballed into a victory of 4 kills and 1 gen remaining.
---
So point being, if they are looping you and keeping you chased then break off. Another survivor will be worse. Just find them.
---
Yeah but, you can use perks to give yourselves the same information. there's enough perks that can do that so swf isn't that much different it's just that you can run more meta perks because you don't need the others for information.
---
Why I play as the most is Leatherface beacause I have BBQ tier 3 and he makes the grind less lenghty. I feel his kit makes me more campy, but I just want to be able to feel like I have a cohesive build and am on even grounds with the survivors, and right now he is the best I can do.
---
If you don't use NOED, swf warning their friends of NOED won't be an issue /s
---
The McDonald's customer when there is no ice cream left. Ftfy.
---
With how easy it is to reach rank 1 I’m not sure how much good that’s personally going to do you, but regardless not wanting to listen to someone simply because you see them as under you or less experienced is a bad habit to develop, not just you personally but for anyone in the real world. 
---
If someone is unwilling to budge from their standpoint it’s understandable, but if someone is willing to discuss something you shouldn’t turn them away or talk down to them because they’re less experienced on the matter.
---
As an added bonus, if the discussion is one where people are picking sides like game balance you’re only going to convince that person to side with the opposing viewpoint and encourage them to develop a negative opinion of the people whom you represent (within your discussion).
---
No I don't, I'm not a sailor.

Yeah I dodged this group when I saw them.  Memers and streamers get the dodge from me.

Where's DBD in that catalogue?

&gt;The fun in this game boils down to the chases(Not killing, not escaping, like many would believe), and legion simply removes that.

Speak for yourself. I find stealthing and ninja-ing my way across the maps the most fun. We got way too few stealth pvp games...

not with those slow ass swings he wouldnt

I am relaxed. Very much so. Just watched a movie, too. Good stuff. So I don't know what you're getting on about. Have a wonderful day.

I was rank 14. After reset 16.
---
If I turn off my cap card and dont play doctor or any of the problem maps it's okay, until the survivors get too close.

Kind of depressing that I have to do all this rigmarole just to get ok frame rates.

I would like big boi Clown
---
they've been trying to change it to something that is still useful but less harmful to the role of killer but something that is fun to use for the player as well, they don't want to just mangle perks anymore so give it time and we'll get something satisfying to use/play against.
---
Never thought about that, but true. 
---
Sabojake and Mike. 
---
Wow that must have been hell waiting! chapter 11 the grind.
---
And this right here is why I won’t play nurse
---
I got it because of glitch that let the killer for some reason get this achievement, probably when everyone escaped through hatch as we were farming so i helped them get this achievement
---
Apparently, dont know if they got it but i did 
---
I only ever p3'd Freddy &amp; Jeff &amp; that's because it was during an event and they're my bois.
---
Nah, make it a flat 5k for everyone still in the match (including the killer) and that seems better imo.
---
It's not because of no one escapes death. 
---
It's incredibly easy to rank up as both killer and Survivor.
---
Honestly Rank 1 is less about how skilled you are and more about how much time you play
---
Source?
---
Nea &gt; Nurse 
---
Freddy likes boys from what I’ve heard. 
---
I said I would value their option lesser than I would value someone who has reached rank 1 at least once. I Never said I would never listen to the person in the former case.

Your comments have been removed from r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);

---
Do not tell other users to kill themself. First and last warning.
---
if these were stickers i would buy them
---
Give an option for the person the hook to decide if they want to get unhooked or not. Simple. 
---
Sprint burst
---
Yeah, it will be a boring ''grind''
---
do you know what i'd like to see a shapeless killer whose special ability allows it to morph into one of the 4 survivors you are facing, say you focus on one survivor and turn into him once you down him, trick his allies and down them one for one taking a new shape as you go, that would be fun for me
---
Definitely agree. I mean each hit is 300, and a hook is 200... and 1st hook is 500 additional. Thats 1,300 just for 1 hook and thats not counting Chase points and "Survivor Found" for Hunter.
---
625 is jack shit.
---
Hey I use beast of prey in all my farming builds
---
well that has to be fun
---
First, it's not the only form of farming (though, most harmful). And second, it would open the doors for more trolling (you're going for the semi-risky unhook, and they deny it, leaving you one on one with killer)
---
Mate, you made dumb assumptions, and no, restarting does not fix killer queues. That will fix buggy software if the issue exists on your end. However, a restart will not fix the matchmaking algorithm, or the simple fact that there are just too many damn killer mains who don't want to ever have to play survivor. 
---
On PC, at any rank, Killer queues be bad. 
---
Watch monto he made a vid called Sabo squad.
---
Rank really doesn't mean that much though. It's pretty easy to Pip for both sides no matter how badly you do so it's essentially just a tracker on how much you've played this season.
---
I know its probably against this subreddits rules, but someone should compile a list of people that DC so everyone can avoid them, considering that bhvr does nothing about them.
---
Shouldn’t have teabagged at the exit imo
---
Literally the only reason I kill afk people is the sound notifications distracting me lol
---
It’s just not fun to sit around and watch one person farm an imaginary currency. I don’t get a lot of time to play and I want to play a real game
---
Spirit with Insidious 3. No more phase faking.
---
lol
---
Hammer?
---
The friends may not care, actually play the game, or could be your own dummy accounts 
---
playing killer is pretty stressful. I noticed yesterday i tend to move foward in my chair when playing killer, yet i lay back and sometimes even text when im playing survivor. Adding to the fact that the killer can get bullied and taunted, nobody wants to be taunted while playing a game in their free time.
---
maybe you shouldnt play in a lobby when you see the killer has 500 ping
---
I completely thought it was a racist joke until your comment, thanks (like how people said Michelle Obama was actually a man).
---
1.9%?  
---
1.9%?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!  
---
Okay. Some killer mains have *clearly* been lying when they say "uH! kEy is OpAF! SuddNly whERe evUrbuDDy g0?!"
---
thx
---
Wait till you see r/dbdgonewild
---
Unfortunately at higher levels of play it becomes obvious just how inept almost every killer in the game is aside from the big 3. Nurse, Hillbilly, and Huntress. It sucks because it does get boring using the same meta over and over and over, but its the only way to compete with the meta survivors
---
RIP Foxy
---
nah he's more into Nancy (side note, still pissed we got Quentin over Nancy but Quentin is like one of the few good things from the reboot)
---
**Survivors:** hear killer approaching and run away 
---
**Killers:** kick generators instead of chasing survivor 
---
**Generators:** 0o0
---
It's fine to mori people, they just need to have entered the struggling phase on the hook first. 
---
At least, that's how I found it to work, googled how to get adept achievements and that's what it said, hasn't failed so far yet
---
Who ever would ask their friend to dc for more points is a pretty bad friend. 
---
When is chapter 11 supposed to come out?
---
Leatherface or Hillbilly with Speed Limiter and Play With Your Food.
---
Chainsaw the obsession, leave, become the fast.
---
Well if you were broken they wouldn't have to worry about you healing, so I feel like it could actually get them to go for the other person, because they'll be able to down you easier if you get away than they normally would.
---
cuuuute, finally some good fukin Rin art
---
A really well designed idea, is a good one, the only thing is, for 15 seconds is too much, it should be 10
---
I've always thought a Killer that can blind survivors could work pretty well. He sounds like he has a really cool design too. Some of the perks could use some tweaking, but it seems like a pretty good idea!
---
omg, most encouraging words
---
he let them go out the gate?
---
If your having a hard time paying attention ti the ping download make lobbies great again
---
That's fair honestly. Didn't really consider it that way.
---
What is that?
---
Yeah, as killer you have to be way more focused, is why I do like to play survivor more, you can just chill and not really have to “try”
---
A good concept like your idea a lot🐲
---
What I'd suggest is to buy dlc you really like, so I bought the Halloween and saw chapter and I'm waiting for the perks of the other killers/survivors to come onto the shrine of secrets or if you can't wait you can spend 9k iridescent shards on them
---
this is a repost
---
I think that from a killer point of view... no one deserve to live 
---
Don't gen rush and look for totems then. 
---
Not simple. You're opening another option for a survivor to troll during a risky save
---
They cant get rid of swf. IMO the Killer should be getting buffs in games with SWF scaling with the number of friends. At least the lobby should show the killer how many premades there are so he can equip himself accordingly or at least prepare mentally for it. The right mindset in a Game can change how you play dramatically. 
---
Downsides are probably more dodged lobbies and more Mori's in SWF games.
---
Buffing the killer could look like more time needed to repair gens, or enable 2 Hex Ruin Totems to find.
---
I think the Devs should experiment with this.
---
As a killer main I fully admit to having landed some bullshit hits on window vaulters, including a non-tantrum leatherface chainsaw run *after* the vault animation completed. Oof.
---
That said I do not feel the same about pallets. When I play against survivors I feel are good I never get to trade a hit for a stun, they always get me first.
---
It's part of the juke. I've landed most of my hits by pretending to avoid the pallet and lunging from out of sight.
---
Dbd has an entire untapped army of weebs willing to invest in cute feng cosmetics, but they refuse to take our money.
---
Where is the rock?
---
Exactly, but... They can't stop the external communication...
---
This brings back homestuck memories. **Downvote** if you know what I mean.
---
I'm fairly new (bought in late nov/eaerly december) and got:
---
1. Leatherface - This gets you BBQ perk which is both good and gets you more points. I actually like leatherface alright as well.
---
2. Halloween - While I'm not a huge fan of his perks, Myers feels somewhat different to play, which is nice.  Lauire has meta perks, though I don't personally play her.
---
3. SAW - Pig, like myers, has a more sneaky play style which I tend to enjoy.  I mostly play her because I like the idea of adding the beartraps as an extra mechanism.  She's really hit or miss when I play her (I either seem to kill everyone or no one).
---
I've been pretty happy with this purchase so far and will likely buy spirit/hag when I want some more variety.
---
The reason people were (rightfully) outraged is in the screenshot of the opening post: they promised a larger optimization PATCH in september when responding to a player post asking them to fix the PS4 framerate, didn't deliver and then pretended the tweet never happened by trying to convince us we mistook "pass" for "patch".
---
The screenshot killed the excuse and now we have another promise of a spring PATCH specifically aimed at improving FPS on all platforms. Let's wait and see.
---
Yeah it's super annoying with randoms. I did a match yesterday. Finished 3 gens, almost entirely solo and cleansed 3 totems and kept track of a 4ths location. NOED still popped and not on the totem I left up which means my 3 teammates did virtually nothing that whole time.
---
Wow you're terrible
---
&gt; tenacity increases the speed to recover
---
unbreakable*
---
Myself I dont mind SWF, on my legion I run mad grit so I love it when they get all altruistic and try to body block a hook. Had a group that I drowned 3 of them with a guy on my shoulder and still got the hook.
---
Ruin 2.0 looks nasty. 
---
What people want when they ask for gens to take longer
---
LF+BBQ+NOED+ 'staying in the general vicinity of a hook'. yep, you will get a lot of pure rage.
---
bitch what
---
*drops shirtless David in boiler room mattress*

Hey I think that huntress is ralphfromthesouth on twitch. Really good huntresss
---
one might say it was hardly the easiest part of DS3.
---
y r u mad
---
Honestly OP, survivors will be upset that anything happens to them. Unless you run at them and intentionally miss every swing, never Hook them, and let them pallet stun you, someone will complain about anything you do. As a killer just play how you want to play and don’t let some made up rules by some stranger determine how you play. 
---
Alternatively, don't. Break dull totems. Because NOED almost always spawns on the outer edge, typically near a gate. This is what I do unless my team is pumping out gens really well. 
---
MODS, we need some regulation on fanart posts. The leeching is disgusting.
---
You can outplay most survivors you'll meet even on the more safe pallets. Breaking pallets in-chase - i. e. where Brutal Strength has its only real utility - is something you can do rather selectively, and you will not regularly need BS to best survivors in chases.
---
While your average survivor is also not very good at abusing window spawns, Bamboozle on the other hand has the utility of forcing survivors to play most of any tile as a pallet tile, rather than combining them with windows - and on those pallets you can outplay them again, or at the very least force them to use up resources more quickly.
---
A true Freddy main would use both, however, so that in combination with Fire Up, you get stacked bonuses on both pallet breaks and window vaults. ;)
---
Enduring should definitely be a lock-in, for the reasons you mentioned; between Spirit Fury and Bamboozle, I would still use Babmoozle: it has an a lot more reliable utility and shuts down quasi-infinites.
---
I wouldn’t really recommend the saw chapter. I have all dlc but it is my least favorite because the perks are pretty bad, and the killer isn’t too fun, but if you like her that’s great
---
\*distant sound of rejoice\*
---
His fault for being AFK. If you're not gonna play the game don't join the lobby.
---
They don’t have to be they are just allowed to be. The killers are almost all considered bad because their powers don’t help in the chase and the ones that are good at the chase are generally the most complained about. Nurse gets dicked by stealth but nobody wants to run stealth perks to deal with her cuz they might run into that one doctor a month and need to run. It’s kinda silly. The killer is dealing with 4 survivors and 4 perks instead of 4 survivors and 12-16 perks. There is no o I need to be wary of what anyone is using because nobody is evolving. In an mmo a raid boss is never defeated by a group of 4 of the same class. They each specialize and work together to win. Nobody does that here. Survivors spend half their time farming each other even at rank one and then bitching about the killer in post chat
---
His twitter handle is in the bottom right but [here ya go](https://mobile.twitter.com/chrishallbeck?lang=en).
---
haha I know what this post is a response to
---
If you think that me saying you should be clear enough in your head to understand how this is an exploit is an insult I don't know what to tell you, I am literally saying you're not stupid. But that is not really a path I want to go down now, neither have the time or energy for it.
---
Besides, you can keep saying what you want about it being an intended game mechanic when I've multiple times already told you an actual developer have confirmed that R-dropping to avoid a flashlight save is considered an exploit.
---
Here's a quote from someone explaining it, this isn't me:
---
&gt; Spam R whilst picking up, means the second the pickup animation is finished, the drop animation starts, meaning the flashlight blind is ACTUALLY impossible. It's not counterplay, it's animation abuse. The same can be done with hooks 
---
If you're gonna keep being biased and defend animation exploits from the killers side but lose your shit over survivor exploits, then I give up.
---
Aww crap. They found out. Claudette! How do you do that “hiding” thing again?!
---
when you make rules about no rules
---
Oh man, I'm excited for this. Here's hoping for a high quality Huntress mask.
---
Feels bad man. I too feel your pain.
---
There is no risk of getting banned, the devs don't do anything about that kind of thing.
---
Step 1: Be small
---
This is the worst idea I've ever heard on any topic ever in my whole life. 
---
At some point, you are going to end up dealing with a team where there is no survivors weak enough or bad enough to lead to a short chase. These games are not uncommon, although not the norm. 
---
At that point, you can do one of two things. Either change tactic and try camping or slugging or something, mix it up and try to mess with them. Or you can just take it on the chin and accept that you are in a no-win situation. If survivors are good and want to win, there isn't a fucking thing you can do to stop them.
---
ironic...
---
The dog is kind of creepy. 
---
I did this once but it was during the patch where it was bugged so the killer got it instead of the survivors :/
---
"when will killers start using tactics that create 4ks but no not those tactics those don't count" aight
---
that right there sums up why the Legion is not liked. 
---
100%
---
I do the same thing. My GF makes fun of me and my "intensity mode positions"
---
Sitting and relaxed.
---
Leaning forward with focus eyes.
---
Standing up and cussing quietly.
---
I was talking about just straight slug camping on the middle of the game. It's just boring
---
I'm not saying that survivors shouldn't also get more points. I'm just saying killers also suffer
---
We need the clown mori animation next
---
We’ve all seen this one post yesterday
---
I might post more of his art, if he says yes,
---
p.s. He's already given me the ok on posting his Spirit drawing ;)
---
I once played dbd on a way older free weekend on my shit laptop, was literally a playstation 2 game with 10 fps
---
I only prestige survivors because it’s not like I even see myself as killer in 1st person, and even then I don’t like the killers bloody clothes. I love P3 Laurie and Kate though.
---
Well no, the friendzone doesn't exist in a video game. 
---
Ay bruh quit runnin or u finna catch the fade 
---
Add someone go afk in the match at the beginning, so I figured probably loading issues, I down them and then moved them to the far corner so I could ignore them. The other got them back up and went about the game. They came back around the same time that I got annoyed with the noise from the crows and we finished the game. Turns out their dog had gotten sick and puked everywhere and they had been cleaning it.
---
\&gt;When you destroy 4/5 totems and noed still pops anyway.
---
This post is not relatable
---
You specifically have to down somebody after you have already deep wounded someone else in the same frenzy. It's way too specific and the achievement barely explains it. 
---
With freddy I tend to use perks that prolong the game (remember me, ruin, etc) and perks that make the end game more deadly (noed, rancor, ect)
---
With wraith I run Franklin's (for fun) sloppy butcher, stbfl, and ruin. I'm probably not the best wraith, but I at least tend to get 2-3 kills.
---
You dont have your crutch tbag vaccum any more ? How sad.
---
Fucking Homestuck shows up everywhere, I s2g.
---
"In public matches, with the Legion while in Killer Instinct, down 25 different survivors."
---
So I can't just follow a survivor and down them with Frenzy? I have to put someone in deep wound, then down a different person? That's 100% not what it says, and if that's what it means, the person who did the trophy description is a dumbass. 
---
\*whizzzzee\* they only have HAHAHAHAHAHA one defense ! HAHAHAHAHAH
---
Took me your comment to realize he wasn't just talking about a quick insidious dip, but full-on hiding until the gens are done?
---
How fucking boring that must be.
---
Oh they fixed unfair pallet vacuum and you call it unfair ? ....hmmmmmm....!
---
You misspelled Dwight
---
I mean, many killer mains make a good point that for the less gens that need to be done the more assholish their playstyle will become if they have very little kills. 
---
If you see 3 gens pop after your first 2 minute chase I assure you that most killers will shift into overdrive or immediately start playing like an asshole. You've backed the rabid dog into a corner what the hell did you expect?
---
I can already smell that foul smell of silicone from just looking at it, it really makes me nauseous 
---
thank you very much!
---
I know. I play the game almost every day, mostly as killer. And I'm telling you, that shit spawns on the edge 9/10 times. I'm Not meming or anything. It's really like that. 
---
I love freddy.
---
I usually run noed and bloodqarden with remember me. It feels like the goal for freddy is to gear up for the end game, trying to sleep as many people as you can at the start.
---
Freddy is not great at extended chases, so dont focus yourself on hunting down everyone you sleep, instead try to sleep as many people as possible before you begin chasing. That way. If it seems really impossible to get one survivor (they loop well/end up near good looping spots) you can go after one of the others.
---
When noed kicks in, you've got a much better chance of catching people, both because of exposed and because of the move speed boost.
---
Bloodwarden is key for noed, to lock people in. Be smart about when you hook people, wait for gates to be open. Remember me slows down their gate opening if you dont have anyone to hook yet.
---
In most cases, it's not really the perks, it's how you play. So give the mass sleeping thing a try.
---
I’m the KILLer, not the Prider. If I feel like it I’ll take NOED and secure an extra end game kill. 
---
Do you think Freddy is better than wraith ?
---
^ this unfortunately. This is the exact reason killer isn't fun in the red ranks.
---
Rank 10 killer is torture, I'm unsure what it's like on the survivor's neck of the woods since I am low ranked in the latter. I was R9 before the reset not bow I'm R13 and nothing changes, matches tend to be so awful that I give up in the middle of them then just hang out in the basement and I check Facebook.
---
Obviously you can. You bought the game. Noed is just only used for meme builds and killers who aren't good enough to rely on different perks. That's the whole problem with NOED, you don't learn to play the game properly and you can get to rank 1 while still being mechanically weak. 
---
i feel like people are misreading it as "Killers should get 100% more..." instead of "Should 100% get more..."
---
1 Means he fully believes Killers should get more than given now
---
The other means the Killer should get double points
---
I'd imagine if it did happen it'd be hex related
---
makes sense. I could've worded it better I guess. oh well.
---
I don't know, I ask the same question. It's not even funny.
---
Must be a Halloween 2018 deleted scene. 
---
DLC is one thing but the visual design team can’t optimize console. the rate at which skins come out has no correlation to how much of a priority fixing the game is, as the two jobs require different skill sets.
---
Put on Iridescent Head, burn an Azarov's Key and go up somewhere high and snipe all game.
---
Is it against any rules to message a survivor in this situation and tell them to farm points? I've had 3 DC games a few times and always tell them to farm and I'll chase just to get some more points. 
---
All according to keikaku
---
needs to exist
---
Staying in the vicinity of the hook is still camping, might not be facecamping, but it's still camping. There are certain killers (with certain addons) with wich you can camp from across the map (especially hag with mint rag). It is quite toxic and doesn't help all that much towards victory. Yes if survivors all stop doing generators to save their friends, then it works out, but when playing against experienced players, they will just stay on their generator and you're just losing time. Essentially what you're doing is ruining the experience of 1 person without it being helpful for yourself. And NOED is just a perk that is generally hated since it doesn't require any skill on the killers part and isn't situational. I am a killer main myself and don't blame survivors for getting angry when they get hit by NOED, when they get camped or when they get tunneled. I also don't blame killers at getting angry at Decisive Strike or T-bagging survivors.
---
Basically you take the fun away for other people while doing those things and they can't really do anything about it.
---
I do understand your frustration with the other side having more unlockd than you do. My tip is to try and lessen the camping. Yes, at first this will probably backfire, but in general it's more time efficient to imidiately go to the next survivor, force someone off of a generator and chasing them down than to wait for survivors to come to you. Learning how to handle loops is way more valuable in my eyes. Camping doesn't require much skill and takes away the fun for the receiving end. However, if you know that the whole survivor team is at the hook, then stay there, it's the survivors fault for not punishing you for camping.
---
To wrap it up you are a new player and I did the same things as you did when I started playing, can't blame you for them. But on behalf of the playerbase that tries having a fun experience for both sides, try to move away from using NOED, minimalise the camping and don't hardtunnel people. I can't force you to do anything, but please concider this. When playing, ask yourself how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of it all (playing some survivor once in a while will help you understand both sides better)
---
I dont care for Kate but Clown thicc and his sleep juice is cool
---
You know I know this is a trash account but man it was enjoyable reading your little troll comments on previous posts. 
---
you did a pretty good job so far
---
I had the inverse last night. My game was going extremely well and Survivors were making ridiculous mistakes (like running directly at me or not noticing me walking up behind them while they're crouching behind a wall, silly little things like that) and it felt weird, like something was off. It was game play like I'd not seen in a long time.
---
Game ends, scoreboard appears, Survivors were rank 19-16. I was at rank 9.
---
Clown is scary af to play against sometimes, and no love for Kate?!? Her P3 clothes look awesome, her hair is bloody af unlike my other P3 character Laurie who just has a few streaks of blood on her face...
---
I realize the merit behind this. But this would get heavily abused by people farming blood points. Leading to even more people DC'ing from matches. If anything this would just make the problem worse. 
---
Don’t forget huntress lullaby if you’re going all in. Miss that overcharge skillcheck and your gen just lost hella progress
---
The thing is, you're only in "Killer Instinct" after you deep wound someone. Killer Instinct is the part of frenzy where you see the red spots locating survivors. 
---
What about my boy Bill!!!!!
---
Oh. Well, you're right, that's not very well explained at all. I appreciate the clarification. 
---
I got it with 1 friend and 2 randoms. It was a baby nurse so everyone was craving BP since she couldnt do much and my buddy and I went to separate doors to try and herd the randoms. Luckily they were both at different doors and followed us to the hatch.
---
O shit, how did I forgot that? 
---
In 2012, the author tried to host the finale to Act 5 on Newgrounds because he knew the amount of people trying to watch would be too much for the Homestuck website to handle. Within 7 minutes of the flash animation being uploaded, Newgrounds' servers crashed as the sheer volume of people viewing overwhelmed the system. The author then tried to put up the animation on Megaupload but then we crashed that too. 
---
TL;DR: Homestuck has destroyed the internet at least twice. What's your point?
---
I love u just for those responses
---
contrary to what many people think, Freddy, if you use his power correctly, is very powerful. Plus it helps that a lot of survivors think he is crap so play more carelessly against him too.
---
Is that pretty good job so far? 
---
We all have to go AFK sometimes. Life happens. You don't have to be a dick about it.
---
“There will be no mercy for the merciless!”- Mori-ing a Claudette
---
Lol yeah I'm not sure if I wanna test it and see if I'm just a good Freddy maybe If I buy his DLC. He is the lowest on everyone's list but tbh blood warden is a cool perk and I think remember me is too so I'm not sure why everyone thinks he's so bad.
---
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
---
 *Cries in european server*
---
legion mask pls
---
HAHAHA
---
I had one game against the Legion. We were down to two and he had just put the other person on their final hook. I got near the hatch, as soon as I saw the hook pop i ran for it. He got to me at the same time I got to the hatch, but I was too fast for the grab and escaped. My heart was pounding so hard I had to watch TV for a little while to calm down haha. 
---
Another survivor moment I was playing with a friend and we were both doing a gen. She asked if that was a Pig she just saw, but it was a meg running the other direction. I was just turning my camera to check the other direction and there was a Pig crouched right next to me, like so close she could have been working that gen too. That was the biggest jump scare I've had in this game. 
---
Also in some buildings they don't even need to moonwalk as the wall structure breaks the chase regardless.
---
My jump scares usually come from either Myers or yeah the Pig. 
---
opening the gate and you see the killer in the distance coming right for you, just opening a gate makes me anxious 
---
I may have played with you then because I definitely played against a camping tunneling pig at Coldwind last night on PS4.
---
Tenacity is one of my favorite perks as killer.
---
It's funny and confusing.
---
It's incredible! Tell El\_Cuco that they did a good job.
---
Because killers already get a bonus plus they already have massive point gain over survivors.
---
It's especially bad around rank 10. You can't worry about it. My advice would be to play survivor some and learn what behaviors you don't like from other killers. Keep in mind, everything is subjective, so all you can really do is try to play fair if that's what you want to do. You can't make up for poor game design choices. People here will cry foul over NOED, but it's honestly not a great perk. The squads you actually need it against will be able to counter it, and it does nothing for you until all gens are completed anyway. You would be better served with a tracking perk like Whispers in place of Noed in you're new. Stick with it and ignore post game chat. 
---
Ohhhhhhhhh, okay. Thank you!
---
Using map exploits, that's a paddlin'.
---
Post game: 
---
Feng: Tunneling baby killer! You only came after me all game! KYS!
---
Killer: Ummm, you realize I can't tell you apart, right?
---
And I, someone who is logical, am telling you it is random.
---
&gt;So yea, legion is underpowered as fuck but breaks the rules of the game while taking zero skill to break them. 
---
I get what you're saying but he isn't that underpowered. He can be upper-mid tier with the right addons/map.
---
Still as you say he is the most unfun to play against especially if they run Bloodhound + Sloppy butcher and moonwalk to break chases.
---
This is beyond science
---
Playing as Doc, whenever I hit a survivor, instead of blood, I got [this.](https://imgur.com/a/UBdnplv) Playing on PC by the way. 
---
Dead by dawn: when you forget the name of Dead By Daylight.
---
I’m well aware but also who expects to die that way lol 
---
Getting slammed with a pallet when I turn a corner.
---
To quote the Huntress; "Aehh! HEY! GhhuurRRRRR!"
---
And I, someone who is also logical, am not saying it ISN'T random. 
---
Jump scares for me:
---
Spirit yanking me off gens with whatever add on she has
---
Myers popping up out of nowhere
---
Pig ambushes
---
Hag traps
---
Billy with Tinkerer just showing up behind me with a chainsaw completely silent
---
It’s on r/IDAP now!
---
Dude it’s worse when you’re on the hook in the basement and it’s only Claudette left and she’s fucking crouching around doing NOTHING. every Claudette ever I swear. 
---
[shitpost] for every survivor disconnect a random gen should be completed. 
---
Cheating is cheating
---
625 BPs "bonus"? Ok, let's give survivors same amount.
---
Just like the simulations
---
Jump scares are my favorite part about playing killer. I play Legion and I grab people at hatches and exits all the time, but I mostly like to catch and release. 
---
I picked someone up a foot away from the exit yesterday while they were crawling to freedom and I was like HA HA HA HA. I HAVE YOU. but I let them wiggle free because honestly I just wanted to give them a little spook.
---
Speaking of healing, whoever Claudette was with me on PS4 last night at Yamaoka against Myers is an idiot. They were on unlimited tier 3 and she kept healing herself and wanting to heal people after the unhooks. I guess sound is the only reason. BP too of course. I had iron will though. Stop following me and healing me! Our time was limited with tier 3 Myers. Do gens!
---
I was under the impression it was 5k.
---
What's wrong with Rancor?
---
Where's the option "She's in a good spot, no buffs needed"?
---
good job!
---
Yeah that was really funny, haha! Thanks for the comment
---
I played someone with that name last week, he was survivor and I was killer. I caught and killed him as Trapper and thankfully he didn't DC on me.
---
I only remember because he had DC in his name and I remember every time I hooked him thinking "okay here comes the DC" but it never came. Glad I wasn't nurse then.
---
I was Meg! If you saw how I escaped via hatch it was my best escape ever. I wasn’t the obsession but I saved my Decisive. She had a bear trap on me. I got unhooked at the end and ran to get my trap off. It didn’t work. Pig is now on me. I run to the exit gates but I know I can’t run out so I stay there and let her kill me. I wiggle up far enough to hit my Decisive right when she was near the hook. At this very moment, I also hear the hatch. I run to it and escape. She had to be pissed. 
---
Maybe you just need practise, I run low tier at rank one to much success, even Freddy. 
---
When people actually think that them getting to rank 1 means something lmao
---
I love wraith too it is possible with purple and red addons 
---

I think he is referring to the fact that killers with high ping teleport around like the Nurse does.
---
Well, you want to reward survivors for their teammate DC, but punish killer (because he potentially loses 25% of BPs), even if he has nothing to do with DC. And you think it's fair?
---
**Kleptomaniac:**

You are able to see items auras in a 16/24/32m radius from you and are able to pick up an item while running without slowing down.

**Speedwalker:**

Press the activate perk key while walking to increase your speed by 43.5% for 5 seconds if not exhausted. Causes exhaustion for 40/30/20 seconds. (Does not leave scratch marks).

Survivors who know to play are OP. I almost always match with survivors who unhook people just 10 seconds after someone gets hooked.  I would say that that's bad play. Do the gen for 20-30 seconds and then unhook. It makes a massive difference as far as gen progress is concerned. It also hurts campers since they would hey afraid of the gens popping and would try to start moving their ass away from the hook.
---
I actually main survivor but ok. My point is I dont want to be forced to play a side I dont want to. If I wanna kill that's what I should be able to do. If I wanna try to survive that's what I should be able to do and it seems there are a lot of people who agree.
---
Survivors outnumber the killer 4:1, they probably wouldn't admit it but some survivors just think the killers success is not as important as the survivors because 4 players getting points &gt; 1 player getting points.
---
Might also be because the biggest douchbag streamers for DBD are all survivors that make teabagging and bming look cool and have a vast young audience that likes to imitate them.
---
Idk what it is about doctor but I wreck with him and only have him at level 12. Only 3 perks not even ranked up. He is just insanely good. I also have success with wraith. Only ones I dont have success with is Myers and clown. Clown they just gen rush because I dont have ruin or thanat on hi. And Myers I have really good perks, I dont know why but I just cant get more than 2 kills with him in red and purple. I did just get him a few weeks ago though so maybe just dont know how to play him yet.
---
I never said that I wanted this change. I never said it was fair. Look over my comment again. I just stated that killer point gen is fine but survivors need a boost. 
---
I play on the PS4. I was playing a match against The Doctor. He started chasing me and hit me. The red stain and the music was still following me. At first I thought he was just messing with me and not swinging. But when I turned the camera around, I had already lost him. Yet on my screen it was if he was right behind me. Once I used Self Care though, the red stain and the music disappeared. It hasn’t happened since though.
---
Honestly in my games i find that megs are usually worse than claudettes for this
---
Honestly this is the one opinion I’ve held in the back of my mind but never said because... well, it’s really easy to argue against. People forget there’s a human being on the other side of that killer, and the games not over unless everyone’s dead or escaped. If have to cut my losses and adjust my playstyle then I will.
---
Okay I will explain one more time
---
She needs a buff to not be on the lower side. So I request people to vote which one they would prefer.
---
Mori a guy with no obsession perks. Just cuz. 
---
NOED 
---
I'm alive, don't worry xD
---
the bit where jasons just standing there and myers is like no this is my kill then they are just playing cards. thats brilliant lol
---
I honestly think this is totally fair. You know the risks coming in with a hex totem. They are absurdly powerful but very swingy.
---
I see no problem with this. 
---
Tier 1 Myers doesn't.
---
BHVR pls nerf Fire Up too op
---
On PC, in the endgame chat there's a small icon at the end of the line where you type — clicking that will hide the entire chat. It'll stay that way until you click it again. Makes playing killer a lot less stressful, especially if you're still learning.
---
Rare offering
---
Bloodweb pollution is a thing.
---
Really don't know why that has never been addressed by the devs, it makes it HARDER for long time players to get the perks they want instead of making it easier.
---
There is an Addon for the doctor that makes people in madness hallucinate the red stain and terror radius. 
---
The amount of people that would use a feature like that for trolling would initially be low, then someone would make a video, and the use of that as a trolling method would be significantly higher, that’s how shit like that works. I would much rather deal with one teammate attempting a stupid unhook on me rather than deal with potentially wasting my own time with attempting an unhook on some dickhead. It’s part of the game.
---
No, claudettes are the immersed braindead players 90% of the time
---
Wow, the doctor really does like doing weird experiments
---
I tired to do that to a Billy once but then he dropped me and mori'd me
---
Well if owl is a trash killer, what's your favorite killer in Dead by Dawn?
---
They also say that camping and tunneling is fine. I am not against body blocking. But I am totally against those two. Moral of the story: don't play as per what the devs say. 
---
Honestly, most recent survivor perks have been shit. The most recent ones that is any good (and was already nerfed once) is David's. I don't remember which DLC it was but he had both Dead Hard and We're Gonna Live Forever. 
---
Maybe it's because I have a good connection as killer or because I never experienced it before they changed it, but it feels pretty fair to me. Also, dropping pallets now requires good timing wich I like.
---
NOED lol
---
It's close enough xD
---
Mori
---
Maybe the bleed effects on the screen?
---
if she’s in a chase she should try to get the killer away from any hooked/vulnerable teammates. i also run bond so that when im being chased i don’t accidentally bring the killer to my dead on hook/injured teammates 
---
P3 claudettes in my experience always think they are invisible. I smack them in a bush, they run around me and go back to the same bush..  but there's no scratch marks leading away from the bush.... also if i get 4 P3 claudettes joining my lobby I am turning up the brightness on my tv
---
I love when i forget i was queued and go afk for a couple minutes and come back to see me getting mori’d. deserved, honestly 
---
setting traps on a hook as hag is toxic, heard it here first guys, another case of: the killer has to let everyone unhook safely and should also not interrupt gen repairing, if the survivors try to blind you please look in the bright light so they can get their points if you don't do it you are toxic, same for pallets - don't dodge the stun people, that's toxic, can't be toxic as a killer! Did i forget anything important? oh right, just in case you down someone by accident (hiting people is toxic) and he hung himself on the hook (hooking people would be even more toxic) and he gets unhooked afterwards, that person now has to be ignored by you for the next 5 minutes otherwise you are tunneling, which is ... you guessed it .. toxic!
---
DC on last hook like a boss
---
Just like Claudette, this joke is overshadowed by race
---
I still do when I open gates. Also I guess I'm tense during chases.
---
about running bond?? because bond has so many good uses, im surprised it’s not on everyones loadout tbh
---
When you think you’re about to die and then adrenaline pops
---
its just people being bullys. The game sticks 4 people in one team - of course they will band together against the one other guy, that's just how humans are. But you're right as a streamer, being toxic helps you have audience a lot.
---
Do you know how many times I tell my friends and literally everyone I play with to run bond? They never do. It's such a useful perk to keep the killer away from your team. I'm tired of getting sandbagged every match, hurts my soul.
---
Oh, I never said it was toxic, I just said that I think it's still camping. Again, I think I pointed it out before and I'll point it out again, I'm a killer main and am as we speak loading into a match with an ebony mori as hag. I never said any of those things are toxic, even never claimed that camping is toxic
---
I don't know why this made me think of Susie from Deltarune, haha.
---
Evil bastard
---
Now thats some heavy desync. Thanks patch 2.4
---
Got it. It's more of a widespread inside joke. 
---
If it's me, I'm looking for the hatch like a coward. When I'm on the hook and there's one survivor left, I let myself die so they can escape, specially if I'm being camped. 
---
If you don't want a buff just don't vote
---
It's not the animation, everyone has their own animations, it's the rigging. All the killers have 2 arms and legs and stand, anything other than that would require new tech
---
But if I'm dead on the next hook, I'll use bond to bring the killer to another survivor who hasn't been hooked. 
---
yeah if its your first hook after 4 gens personally after that point im probably frustrated so i under stand the camp
---
That’s hurts to hear
---
&gt;Staying in the vicinity of the hook is still camping, might not be facecamping, but it's still camping. There are certain killers (with certain addons) with wich you can camp from across the map (**especially hag** with mint rag). **It is quite toxic** and doesn't help all that much towards victory.
---
Funny, seems to read like you did say exactly that, must be my eyes :)
---
Feng is literally getting one for CNY? 
---
Lol geeze Kage Bushin no jutsu much? 
---
Okay I will be honest with you I was messing with you, sorry. I just wanted to be as unclear as possible.
---
Would you fter this still be intersted to give your opinion on a different poll I made?
---
[https://www.reddit.com/comments/ahcwek](https://www.reddit.com/comments/ahcwek)
---
thank you! and I honestly have no clue haha
---
What’s sandbagging?
---
He's broken on a fundamental level because he doesn't play DBD.
---
One of her addons it removes the ability to see the boxes until your trap is active
---
Its certainly good for a fun/memes build.
---
Okay. I’ll admit. It was too tempting just this once. 
---
I use cold dirt and any movement addon I’m not **That** bad 
---
Claudette is the new Laurie, either an immersed fuck with D-Strike or a toxic liability to a team. Change my mind. 
---
Currently they cant change that due to how lobbies are made on the killers end. This is something that they will be able to fix with dedicated servers, so hopefully they will ASAP. Unfortunately ded servers are still a ways out.
---
That’s not being outplayed, that’s just bad hitboxes 
---
Yes he does. It’s the same for wraith too I believe. 
---
you go in dreamstate and he pix you out of the locker.
---
Also consider voting on a poll I made: [https://www.reddit.com/comments/ahcwek](https://www.reddit.com/comments/ahcwek)
---
You get put in dream state and on his shoulder
---
I can't, there's no options "I have no friends to play with"... :cry:
---
He doesn't auto down with deep wound
---
Wraith can perform well at rank 1 as well. If you have the right perks then you’re pretty much set to get a 3-4K if you know the basics of running loops efficiently and forcing survivors to run jungle gyms/shack in the least efficient way. Hex ruin, barbecue and chili, spirit fury, and enduring. You can run double windstorm add ons for greater map control and bodyblock strategies. 
---
Also the wraith sloppy butcher bug where you constantly squirt blood makes the frames so much worse
---
That's actually an incredible story, and concept for in game!! 😍
---
Surveillance perk ???
---
Some of the stuff on the official merch page is good. That trapper mask looking ^(clean) 
---
i use Duration add ons which stack^i ^think
---
It will probably change when the dedicated servers come out. 
---
What honestly frustrates me isn’t even that I have to reinvite my friends. Is that when I leave, I’m put into the solo lobby, and not into the lobby where I can easily reinvite. Nope. Gotta go out to the main menu first, THEN into SWF lobby. 
---
They are probably the same people that think gen patrolling, juggling, slugging, killing survivors, ect is cheating but use exploits to "make the game fair" hope they get a lovely perma ban to go with their toxic tbags
---
Of course! Espically with the deerskin gloves (makes reloading faster) it’ll be good with the iridescent hatchet since you have to reload so often
---
New Add-On: Tasty Chalk  
---
Replaces combat straps, has the same effect.
---
"Unfortunately, this product is no longer available"
---
I don’t think they stack but I’m not sure but on a side note I have like 16 franks mix tape and only time I used it was for adept legion 
---
We need doorbell wraith aswell
---
*deep inhale* OH NO
---
Purposely leading the killer to your teammates to get them chased instead of you. Also known as being an ass.
---
If you guys had to pick some killers they would add who would you want to see in the game 
---
Freddy is a bit of a wild card at rank 1.   Most people hardly ever see one and forget about the quirks in fighting him and make really stupid decisions.  Outside of a 3/4 stack swf that knows the tricks to beating him, you can easily walk away with a 3 kill as Freddy at R1.
---
&gt; ok i understand my PC is ass
---
There's your problem
---
Amanda's playing games again... 
---
I dont know if they stack but I do know the BP gain for each full Frenzy does increase from just using 1
---
I dont remember the figures for individual ones but its 150 base for a full Frenzy and 212 for both.
---
Its like 170-180 for 1 add on
---
Did this just happen?
---
Explain 
---
the salt from toxic people gives me life
---
I have 25 left, I had 40 after the event. I want to prestige them but that means using 25 Franks and 40 Ebonies before hand
---
Halloween or the Leatherface DLC.
---
Yes, the one that is the pig face and a generator, it will have a little rework in patch 2.5.0
---
**EASY 4k**
---
The problem mainly is when these yikes hits are from a well timed pallet and as a survivor you are already injured so you did the right thing and still get killed which is unfair 
---
No I am doing a survey I am creating a couple of polls if enough people vote I can take the results to show the  altruism  of surviors against killers.
---
Doesn't really work when it's a collor that screams "look at me"
---
3rd option, just DC so the Pig doesn't get the RBT kill ;)
---
Lmao man you really sound like you have problems articulating yourself and all I'm saying is your time would be better spend posting to someone who gave a crap lol all I'm doing is laughing at your lack of basic grammar. 
---
Platform PC
---
Leatherfaces' chainsaw is not making any noise when he rev's it. No add ons equipped. Witnessed in multiple games
---
Pretty cool
---
I do that kind, too. But they just stare at me til I'm done. 
---
Thank you !  I know not everyone understands "Not English as first language" - " English speaking born native" 
---
One time I was afk because my cat brought a living bat in my living room. Yeah, a living bat. Got hooked while I was trying to figure out how to catch a flying bat
---
I'll have you know I already have my own bottles of chloroform, thank you very much.
---
Fair enough nothing wrong with not being a native English speaker but I'm sure your time could be spent in better ways then typing out multiple comments on one meme lmao. 
---
That is a thing, I love the internet.
---
I have now made it my new mission to become a P3 Claudette that isn't an ass and break the stereotype. 
---
And this somehow makes me look like an asshole ? Interesting !
---
Even with my lack of basic grammer understand, that you might not be the nicest person in this situation ! 
---
SWF with comms, not that impressive.
---
There is a limit as I found this out later as well
---
TIL 
---
Lmao okay buddy have a nice life. 
---
Firstly, don't buy the non licensed DLC's. Nightmare on elm street should be your last choice (Not very usefull perks on survivor side and worst killer in the game on killer side). If you only play survivor, then don't get the leatherface DLC since there is no survivor in that one. The saw chapter is a decent choice, but detective tapp doesn't have very usefull perks. The halloween DLC is the best one, it contains both the most usefull licenced killer and also one of the most usefull survivor perks (and I hate that perk, pls don't use it) (Decisive Strike).
---
Ebony Mori time, hehe buai
---
Don’t get my hopes up.
---
It's not his dead game that's keeping him out. It's the copyright mess surrounding him.
---
Wow plot twist 😂
---
Me too
---
Why does it happen
---
I recomend you just unlock non licenced characters trough gameplay and not spend your money on them
---
odd flex
---
Because game balance is important maybe?
---
Because if the game is truly unbalanced, nobody will want to play?
---
I think of game balance a lot when it comes to Overwatch. Whomever is strong at the time gets the most gameplay, but everything still needs a fair counter. If there’s not a fair counter, then everyone will always play the same, and games will not be frustrating and unfun to play. 
---
People did not start suddenly wanting any of the things you mentioned. They’ve wanted them for some time now, and now they’re seeing the opposition getting something they want, they’re wanting their demands done as well in order to keep the balance. 
---
Incidentally, giving a buff or a nerd doesn’t necessarily mean they’re attempting to create a more asymmetric environment. It means they’re actually trying to create a fair and balanced game. Both sides should realistically always be able to win depending on their skills and choices. Yeah, if this was a game of 1 killer vs 1 survivor, that’s truly asymmetrical. The one survivor doesn’t have a chance to get all 5 gens online. But the killer’s ability to kill all four survivors should be equal to the four survivors being able to escape, and this is done with appropriate buffs and nerfs when necessary. 
---
Killers don’t want their builds to be visible on SWF teams when someone dies (*cough* because they’ll destroy the NOED crutch *cough*). Similarly, survivors don’t want killers getting the opportunity to change their play style before entering a game by saying “hmmm.... they’re all taking items in, so I’m taking Franklins”. It’s hypocritical to say you don’t want your NOED revealed but at the same time you get to see if someone has a Key and make the decision to tunnel them ASAP, or choose a different perk, or even a different killer. Survivors don’t get the luxury of knowing what they’re up against, and that’s an advantage killers will always have when going into a game. 
---
So no. Wanting game balance is logical. You just have to adjust that logic towards a 1v4 environment. 
---
Unfortunately he has no mobility and his power hinders his ability to down survivors. Map control is good but not on its own, a killer also needs to be able to kill quickly. This is why Hillbilly is better than almost every other killer, he has both map control and lethality. And it’s why Huntress is so strong, her mobility is bad but she’s lethal at potentially any range. 
---
Freddy has his strengths, don’t get me wrong, but unfortunately his weaknesses really hurt him in the current meta. 
---
I don’t like using class photo because of the longer dream transition since I like to start chase as fast as possible, and BBQ is also good for bloodpoints. 
---
The swing is just for show. That doesn’t counter DS
---
It's just a 3 hit down, it's been like that 
---
I knew I'd see him here eventually. I really like his animations. They're cute and funny
---
At least you turned out to be a bit friendly in the end, you too buddy ! See you in the fog !
---
That was sarcasm genius hahaha i have to spoon feed /s to you dipshits.
---
Those are their names tho 
---
There’s currently a bug in live servers where if the unhooker with borrowed time gets hit or downed by the killer, the person getting unhooked loses the endurance buff from borrowed time. That might have been what happened. 
---
Further slowing a game slowing mechanic?
---
How about no. 
---
XdxDxaDxdxdx 
---
Its 100% down to how well the survivors know how to counter play him. If they get greedy or panic then you're hosed, but if they know how to exploit his weaknesses he gets dunked on.
---
Piss off kid
---
No. Look properly at what I said compare to the text associate with their names. 
---
The copyright mess is tied to that dead game. 
---
Sprint Burst, Lithe, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing To establish dominance
---
Yeah probably! I may have died in the basement
---
Dedicated servers has already been officially announced for summer of 2019. 
---
Nice
---
She was running ruin and devour and noed?
---
It was worth it then.
---
To be honest I didn't know you weren't a native English speaker until you told me so before that I just thought you were some kid spazzing out lol. But respect for being bilingual man. 
---
I love fire up with save the best for last. Some of the saltiest post game chat I've ever read.
---
r/madlads
---
To any killer out there that goes for the douche unhooking instead of the unhooked survivor you are the real MVP. 
---
This just happened to me, i made fun of huntresses hotboxes and didnt make it clear that it was a joke.
---
O e of Pig's teachables is Surveillance. Currently it's trash. Shows you the last 1/2/3 gens you kicked in white for 16 seconds. Ostensibly, if a Survivor touches it during that period, you'll know. But 16 seconds is worthless, and the gen limit is extremely restrictive.
---
But the mid chapter patch coming (presumably) Tuesday include a buff to the perk. Now any/every gen you kick will be white and will remain so until it stops regressing. So if you see a gen stop being white, it means it's either completely off again or a Survivor has touched it.
---
I have the feeling that Surveillance paired with Discordance (Legion perk, shows a generator in yellow for a few seconds if multiple Survivors are on it together) is going to be really powerful.
---
Is that stuff actually available now? Last time I checked it was all coming "soon". 
---
Had that happen to me another night unlimited tier 3 and a teammate would heal themselves all the time like bruh you will always be exposed just work on a gen please
---
Brace yourself for some pretty good job
---
Put a timeout on the penalty then.  If you leave the first game, you get a warning.
---
If you leave another game within 2 hours, you get a bloodpoint penalty.  If you leave yet another, automatic time out.
---
This could be tweaked to deter rage quits yet not affect random DCs.
---
You're being a tad myopic.
---
It's not that he can't camp, it's that he cant defend. Defending is important so that's a big one. 
---
Also, if you bolt the second he sleeps you and know how to path correctly he you just get 7 seconds head start for free. 
---
Being invisible doesn't prevent stealth it just gives you an edge.
---
His perks aren't bad if you play for end game, which is ironically when freddy's power is strongest.
---
Your bbq point is fine I guess, but its trivially easy to wake up or hide in a locker so
---
I love freddy but hes easily the weakest killer.
---
Whoever gets there first gets the box! That’s my rule of thumb lol
---
They should rename Hag to “Hex Babysitter”. 
---
Big brain play
---
you have no idea... just how fast i really am 
---
Add spirit fury, gg.
---
Oh boy yeah
---
If anyone knows or is able to check I think the new mend effect still shows red stain even after injured
---
And well Myers is the only exception because he's not meant to spend the whole game in tier 1 unless you've got the meme build with scratched mirror
---
No it's not. It helped to kill the game but it's not actually related to the game. It's related to the original characters and the first movie.
---
I played against her on coldwind, the game and redforest 
---
Devour no I don’t believe so. Ruin yes and NOED I think she was. 
---
I mean hit Number 2 is guaranteed so i dont count it
---
so more like a 2 hit down as opposed to the normal 3 
---
They said in a dev stream that they'll never add a non human killer.
---
They at least have to be a humanoid of some sort like Hag or Wraith.
---
I think it should instead of being able to recover from exhaustion x amount faster, it should allow them to recover from exhaustion while running and getting chased, similar to before the update, but can also apply to survivors in x amount of range.... what do you all think?
---
No, that's just being an ass. Sandbagging is when you block someone else from movement, whether its blocking you in a corner, repeatedly fake unookong you, or using a window/pallet so you cant.
---
The salt keeps this game alive stop playin
---
Brand new part isn’t effected tho unless somehow you get found in the first five seconds of the game...
---
&gt;Could charge power by hitting Survivors (discouraging tunnelling) then enter a superpowered mode with either increased speed or tracking or something.
---
So basically Legion then?
---
When I logged on I did not expect to see an Ace Attorney reaction image but I am pleasantly suprised
---
They still got what they wanted tho
---
i give nurse a pass for that reason it takes so much practice/skill that i just respect the dedication
---
So did you, now everyone’s happy.
---
Ah yeah the pig i went against had devour noed ruin and bbq ahe was p3 and crouched near the hooks everytime. First game i died in basement, 2nd 2 got out and one died she downed me i hit my ds while she eas in a pallet stunned her ran her around the whole map and finally found and got hatch and 3rd she killed all 3 i finished last gen went to gate and she found me downed me with noed i hit ds but there wasnt anywhere to go so she got me 
---
I’m a Freddy, they get the doors open it’s already over, I dc’s so I could just move to the next game
---
No I just dc’d and moved on
---
Hopefully they have all of the legion masks. I'd insta buy that for me and my friends.
---
Where 
---
Legion is awesome lol wym 
---
I would want at least a 3k lol
---
Awwwww
---
“About the infinite load”

You posted this 2 times ?

FACTS
---
When are we getting Nick as a survivor with the Proto Badger as the killer
---
It’s on Xbox, Microsoft is terrible and would probably give me the ban instead. 
---
It is. UP effects all skill checks. 
---
As long as they don't fix it we need to get around it somehow. It sucks so much
---
I mean what else are u supposed to do when the exits are basically powered lol
---
I originally saw it on their Official Facebook page. But here it is in their support site. 
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020519772-Dedicated-Servers-Coming-in-Summer-2019
---
We can talk about that over voice chat if you want to maple. 
---
Microsoft only seems to enforce communication bans
---
Hmm maybe I should have been a little more articulate. If you are looking strictly at revealing survs than ya murmur or rancor are better than discordance. 
---
The reason I rated discordance higher than the other two is because it helps you draw the game out and be procactive, which the other two cant because they only kick in after a genny gets done. Meaning those perks are reactive in nature.
---
So, if you had it in mind that you were only going to run one gen related perk (which is how I perceive all three of these perks) then I would choose discordance because it helps you before a genny gets done, in oppose to after.
---
That's not really what I'm saying. Of course overall game balance is important, what's illogical is demanding *symmetric* game balance, i.e. when one side gets a chase buff, the other side demands a chase buff, not because they think it will make the game closer to an even 2 kill 2 escape per game, but because it feels like if one side gets a buff in a certain area, they should, too.
---
I get that people have been asking for these things for a long time, and I agree, that's probably a part of it. Certainly lots of people have wanted their items hidden in lobby for a long time. I just get annoyed that so many people look at balance the wrong way. It's not about "if I have 2 of A, you need 2 of A", it's about "the sum total of all my unique advantages should roughly match the sum total of your advantages, regardless of what areas our strengths lie in". 
---
And you're making that exact mistake in your key/NOED example. I don't care that one side can see the other's plan and the other side can't, I just care if, after everything is accounted for, the sides perform roughly equally. If that balance is achieved in part by showing surv items in the lobby and not showing killer perks when you're dead, so be it.
---
I hope we get high quality Susie's &amp; Joe's masks, the two original Frank &amp; Julie masks, AND the Frank &amp; Julie common outfit masks. I wanna buy all of them xd 
---
Survivors have a limited amount of evil they can contribute to you. If the Survivor is deep red when being stalked then you've drained all the power you can from them. Without add-ons that increase the evil required to hit tier 3 you can only get 6-7 uses out of it per game, and only if you don't kill someone with energy left. Tombstone Piece drops that to 3 *if* you do it perfectly. Typically you'll only get 2. And if you fo Judith's Tombstone right you can get 2 with it.
---
Dude. This isn’t an overnight venture. It costs money and time to develop, and I guarantee that when we do it get, there WILL be issues. So hold your horses. 
---
oh I shidded my pant.
---
I've only hit that skill check once. I'm pretty sure it was by accident as well. I'm almost convinced that no one hits that shit on purpose but oh boy does it feel good when it happens.
---
yeah i understand but this happens with my friends who have good PCs
---
Note: keikaku means plan
---
I hope we get high quality legion masks. I don't wanna create the Susie, Frank, Julie masks because I'm afraid I'll bend the mask shape. The only one I could create was Joe's because its a bandanna.
---
You are an enemy of the people
---
People really still say shit like “salty” and “lmao u crying!!”? He didnt seem upset in the slightest, just said something that was true. The only person that seems upset here is you.
---
Blindness hiding the boxes would be OP. There is an add-on that hides them until the trap activates.
---
Remember, RBTs aren't meant to kill Survivors. They're meant to keep them busy and off of gens.
---
But I like legion!  :(
---
I guess my sarcasm didn't come across...
---
Creepy, isnt it? :D 
---
No they added a line clarifying it doesn't 
---
My horses have been held, but it’s gets old running into 4 out of the 5 match’s I played today were that way
---
A killer that is literally just a fly.  A normal house fly.
---
thank you
---
Not even unnerving presence?
---
The rock on the hill (where totems can spawn) can be climbed on fron one tiny side (it's an exploit). You can also do it as killer but it's pretty hard.
---
"I'M GETTING ONE OF YOU LITTLE FUCKERS"
---
Game crashes a lot. Like every 4th game. Fix k thx.
---
Not sure what games you've played, but the Legions I play against tend to still tunnel one person down to down them quickly, and moonwalk to keep the timer going down.  I've had more tunnlers as Legion that most other killers.
---
Why not Larry Butz as the survivor?
---
And the killer brings Franklins demise :) 
---
Spirit actually got buffed into being good. Legion got one change that was basically irrelevant (Deep Wounds still decreasing as you mend). The rest is just bad Survivors and toxic Killers feeding each other in an endless loop.
---
Dude, I have you added on my psn. You only ever play killer. I play both sides. You try playing a match as killer with a frame rate of 2 fps which breaks the game and tell me you wouldn't be mad about someone using an exploit to win because they wouldn't have otherwise. The meg that got hit was working on the same gen as me and I couldn't even have her on my screen because it was making my frames drop down to unplayable levels and I wasn't even affected by sloppy at that time. Sloppy wraith fuck the whole game up. 
---
New killer buff.
---
I'd use that perk lol
---
Can I get a DS piece of wood? Or an entire pallet?
---
Suck my cock right to the base bitch ;)
---
2 hits are guarenteed.
---
because I would have to uninstall myself from life if I was playing killer and got tea bagged by Larry Butz
---
I just couldn't go on after something like that
---
I’d go first, hit all great skill checks, then they’d have enough time. 
---
Unnerving has nothing to do with healing and never has. It only effects skill check size and increases the frequency of getting one.
---
Killing all these hoes camp in tier 3 you ain’t getting saved
---
Switch over to nurse and stock up on toilet paper cause I'm about to take a shit on some scrubs.
---
Thats pretty toxic. I dont know how you could consider Legion being fun to play when you arent even playing the game anymore. Like theres no way to play better or learn from your mistakes as Legion. Everygame plays the same exact way. When I got Bloodhound 3 on Legion I could literally watch a twitch stream while in “chase” thats how uninteractive and boring the chase (the most important and fun part of DBD for both sides) is playing against and AS Legion.
---
Ask any huntress main and they will tell you that it is a complete waste of a perk.
---
I get the sense we're actually broadly agreeing here. Yes, if a buff seems wildly unbalanced the side with the short end of the stick might call for a buff on their end to mitigate its effect. But those aren't the people I'm referring to. If I wasn't on my phone I would go grab examples from the forums, but basically a not insignificant number of people think balanced is about 1 for 1 parity by individual *mechanic* out of some misplaced sense of pseudo-fairness. The people who don't look at the bigger picture are the ones I'm impotently ranting about here.
---
I still think the key example isn't really appropriate. Lobby dodging is one thing, but so what if a killer wants to bring NOED now and thinks it's a good idea to tunnel people with keys? If the game is balanced in the aggregate it doesn't matter.
---
Based on how fun they are to play and how good their perks are
---
Best value for killers: Leatherface, Spirit, Meyers, Legion, Clown, Doctor
---
Best value for survivors: Laurie, David, Francis, Feng, Kate, Jeff
---
Yup. Megs more often run sprint burst resulting in them crouching around being slow.
---
Good for meme builds
---
I’d like to say I’m a huntress main, I think 
---
I saw no posts there
---
I've asked that myself often ^^ 
---
Why do you care how others play? Play your way. Every other killer can 2 shot but the moment legion can 3 shot people act like it's over and op. 
---
Because when survivors first start the game they have no idea what they are doing and get killed very easily. This makes them think that killers are OP. Once they start getting better at the game, they think they are hot shit for defeating "OP" killers and see acting as toxic as possible as payback and punishment. 
---
Also because online gaming in general is just super toxic and filled with terrible people. Fortunately DBD gives you the satisfaction of brutally murdering them with sharp objects and paranormal powers. 
---
Yes, thank you. 
---
r/prequelmemes 
---
It is? 
---
The difference is that going harsh on a survivor actually hurts the killer. If I catch an annoying survivor and facecamp them in order to punish them, then I'm probably going to lose the game. 
---
Survivors don't lose anything by being toxic. If anything, frustrating a killer serves as great distraction to helping your team win. 
---
I know. I even made this video compiling everything. https://youtu.be/isP4DycDQPE
---
What does getting a trap off have to do with altruism?
---
That's the main reason I think Sprint Burst is the weakest exhaustion perk. Having to walk everywhere to "save" the SB is a huge downside and a large waste of time. And if you dont save it, then you're just using it when you don't even need it.
---
Whenever you need to get somewhere, just burn it, then walk the rest of the way to get the cooldown going.
---
Thats what i figured. Ty
---
Absolutely. Bloodpoints are super easy to get. When I don't have any more killers to level 50 I eventually hit a million until the next chapter. 
---
Well, yes. Otherwise it wouldnt work. 
---
Also the pass will be an uodate that may OR may not affect FPS. Literally what they said aswell. So chances are even after this optimisation PASS things won't improve on a scale we want them to. 
---
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Millie Bobbie Brown hates lgbt /s
---
I don't think predate would fit with the game's lore.
---
That’s the key there. People think that the change WILL unbalance the game, or they’re only saying “hey, they got what they wanted, can’t we get this too?”
---
Myself, I agree that killer perks should be hidden until the match is over. But I’m beyond tired of getting targeted just because I bring a broken key into a match. It’s not fun to play when the killer gets that kind of insight before the game begins.  
---
well noob3 gets like 4k viewers per stream so he is a pretty successful streamer and youtuber.  Is it really that hard to understand?
---
Smash symbol spotted.
---
screw you I checked
---
NOED is actually easy to read if a killer has it or not. Look at the killers feet. If they're sliding then they have NOED because their footsteps wont line up with the speed boost.
---
Agreed it is quite different from other games.
---
If the killer received some additional compensation for playing against an SWF, it wouldn't be so bad.  A flat BP bonus or altered emblem threshholds or even increased XP for iri shards would quell most of my complaints about going against an SWF versus a group of 4 randoms.
---
Open steam and launch it from your library. This has been an issue since release in 2016, yet everything it has seemed to be patched, it makes it's way back. You are probably opening it from the desktop icon. Dont do that. Just go to your steam, then library, then launch it from there. It will always launch from steam library if the shortcut icon way doesn't work. 
---
Legion “3 shotting” people is a problem because they move at 132% speed, have no cooldown on missed attacks, can vault pallets and windows and the first two hits they get are guarenteed and happen within 4 seconds of each other. Stop being ignorant. Legion abuses the chase mechanic worse than the Nurse does because you dont have to be good to do well as Legion. My 10 year old cousin could play Legion with Franks Mixtape and down someone within 20 seconds. His only other game experience is Mario Kart and Clash of Clans. 
---
Legion literally plays the game for you. Its not about mindgames and trying to outplay someone at pallets. Its all about waiting for your power to recharge so you can hit the survivor with no counterplay. The people who are deciding to “main” Legion are going to get real upset when they realize they cant play as any other killer anymore because how crutch and easy Legion is to play. 
---
Also a person with game knowledge realizes that they dont even need Franks Mixtape. The other purple add ons are way more broken. Stab Wound Study is the best one. All you need is Bloodhound and use stab wound study. Hit a survivor twice, then pause for a second look at the ground and follow the blood. Their deep wound timer is going to go down quick and since you’re still trailing them theres no counterplay.
---
A great and valid opinion. While I already have BBQ and Chili unlocked, I'll keep this in mind!
---
I really don't know. I saw it a couple times in Trues stream
---
I mean just because you start a chase doesn’t mean you have to end it. Don’t chase the p3 teabagging nea with a purple flashlight for 10 mins, just ignore her and patrol the gens
---
I advise against such menuvers, dusabling antivirus is not as wise, just open the game from steam and not the desktop icon....
---
Would Wraith with two Shadow Dances be even better than T3 Myers?

I've played nearly every ace attorney game except for SoJ and i can't remember for the life of me when this CG happened

And again, I think you're ignoring the points I made. You don't have to play LF that way and I've had a lot of success in playing him with BBQC while comboing Spirit Fury with Enduring. Provides an easy way to track and helps finish chases faster. 
---
He promotes a campy playstyle because the community styles it that way. He can be quite good. That's all I'm saying. It feels like you don't want to acknowledge that but I guess that would make sense because it sounds like your experience with him hasn't been fun or rewarding

I've only been a P3 claudette since release but I've never gotten flak. I go for saves or I'm on a gen. Anything else is usually a waste of time. 
---
If they are P3 and use self care then they are an idiot. 
---
Its actually one purple and a common for max 
---
What if the Entity was the new killer? I mean like a spiritual form of the Entity that is a puff of black smoke that floats around and kills the survivors themselves. If you need to feed off of the fear of survivors, then the person best for the job is yourself.
---
When you suck so bad at the game that you need to use map exploits to beat Freddy.
---
Bro you are so lucky they didn’t just DC after they knew you had tombstone.
---
could anyone explain whats sandbag plz ive seen it so many times and still dont know what it is 
---
Your clones are very impressive, you must be very proud. 
---
The person is just upset no one watches when they stream.
---
You tread in dark lands, traveler. You spout blasphemy towards our sweaterboi. You must be punished.../s
---
No but seriously Freddy mains know our metrics. We main him because we love him as a character, maining him is a labor of love 
---
Sweet thanks!
---
Michael.. soft???
---
Yep. Like an older brother that knows exactly how to and wants to irritate the shit out of you. They know that camping with Leatherface really makes people salty because there’s no counter to it, so they do it for just that reason. 
---
So do you get the option to go into prestige mode when you get Max level? 
---
Exactly. V fun people to be around in real life.
---
What is a drag king? I first read it as dragon king and got pretty excited.
---
Altruism is the act of kindness towards others, and if your friend is gonna get there first but you're an asshole and steal it from him getting him killed, that's not a very altruistic act of you
---
admittedly me and my friends got this on a swinger leatherface. we weren't even going for it originally and i found a purple key in a chest
---
same :( feels bad
---
Sprint burst has to be run with urban 
---
Does it though? She’s not that difficult. 
---
If i'm not mistaken, you can also get to those spots as a killer by lunging from the top floor. Just a tip for future encounters
---
Third prestige. Reach level 50 on any character you get the option to prestige. You get a cosmetic item the first three times so most people stop there. 
---
Nice 
---
95 percent of my deaths are from me being too altruistic so I would give it to him since he's closer to it. He earned his life fair and square, he deserves the box
---
Yeah, I'm guity of that( got a bitter message about my internet once, despite other survivors having yellow bars) but fck man, I wouldn't even be playing as killer if survivors didn't earned a pitiful amount of bloodpoints despite doing so much effort.
---
It's like a Drag Queen, but reversed. Woman dressing as a man... although Ace Visconti, Dragon King sounds way more fun now.
---
The Shape is the best killer to play against first his scary ability and general scare factor. You can't change my mind 
---
We also know that know that he is not the worst killer in the game like some people say
---
How do you not see how? It wasn't in the patch notes and started suddenly happening, it will get fixed eventually.
---
Imagine poppies voice on a 6’2 250 guy and it makes it that much more funny
---
DOZENS OF US!
---
Can confirm, I was chasing a Nea as Legion in Frenzy, swung at her, and when the slideshow started playing again she was nowhere to be found.
---
Most of the time it’s destroyed fairly quickly, but I run it for the games that it isn’t.
---
People can’t t bag the exit if they can’t get the gens done 🤭🤭🤫
---
Being punished for going for risky/stupid pallet drops?!? What has this world come to??!? ;-;
---
I understand, I like him/her too ^^ 
---
I played a few games last night on ps4 with a random huntress who would just sit there and swing the axe while we got gens and left. It was nice. A few players farmed off her hits and then left.
---
This is really well done.
---
It’s just the percentage of ps4 players of dbd that have this achievement. 
---
survivor here, ruin is in i would guess 90% of games
---
I have no idea.I mean how worse can console get at this point?
---
sweet i didn't even know there was a site for artist to post their stuff on reddit
---
She also got a slight increase in point gain and her TR fades out faster when she crouches but also fades in faster. Crouch change is pretty big though since you can actually take addons for your traps as before you were basically shoe horned into always picking straps and video tape.
---
Michael juggle her she has DS! Oh god oh fuck he has airpods he cant hear us!
---
He’s just standing there, MENACINGLY
---
If they were gonna put DBD on console they could at least care for it. We were promised optimization in December and we still haven’t gotten it. 
---
Uh, people have been dropping survivors to avoid blinds for quite a while. And I've heard nothing about it being suddenly being blinded when trying to drop a survivor to avoid said blind.
---
Haha. That's a great idea!
---
Sprint burst lithe dead hard balanced landing
---
Wait you're not really bitching over being killed when you went AFK mid match, are you? You're not actually this entitled right? Just joking around a bit?
---
Bullshit post
---
I guess people like Zubat never go against decent SWFs then even tho he gets rank 1 at like day 2/3 of each season? Because he pretty much never depips, and if he's using his 4 or 5 best killers, he pretty much never loses. But yeah, sure, SWF is unbeatable.
---
lmao yeah u trash tho cuz ur complaining about swf
---
Its normal when they give bp back
---
Yes 
---
Fujin: Using Ruin on Hillbilly is OP
---
Also Fujin: Ruin is dogshit
---
Welp.
---
I didnt know that. Even though when they gave me the BP it didnt put me over a million?
---
I’d honestly say no. There’s no way to play him “properly” because even if he doesn’t tunnel there’s no counterplay to him whatsoever. It doesn’t matter if he tries to spread out the damage, I’m still going to get hit no matter what, I can’t hide from him bc all he needs to do is find one person and he’s found me, there’s just nothing I can do against him. It’s no fun and whether the legion plays cheap or not it’s not gonna change that I just want to leave when I see him.
---
Mr. Fiscally Responsible over here.    
---
Legion
---
I’ve had Claudette’s doing nothing and they end up dying after me. Like what???
---
That's your issue for not seeming to understand that "for quite a while" is not saying "always".
---
Balanced landing and lithe are situational that’s why I thought I’d give sprint burst a try
---
She wouldn’t be! 😂
---
All right gonna try it this way thanks 
---
I do, I'll usually just slug them and leave them
---
According to who? You? That's funny.
---
mhm but dont take it from me, i only have over 1,000 hours on killer alone
---
So you’re saying i can buy daddy’s mask?!?
---
I have to. The way I see it, if I have my 1st hook before the 1st generator is popped, then I have a better chance at winning. Rank 1 I come across more SWF, players who are very familiar with maps and totem placements so even if its a minute they spend looking for Ruin, its time away from gens. Hell, sometimes these guys run through the gens as if Ruin isn't even equipped. But times Ive had it cleansed within 20 seconds of the match starting, 2 gens are popped before I even get into a chase. With Leader, Toolboxes and players who never miss those easy skill checks, rank 1 players can finish all 5 gens in less than 5 minutes.
---
F
---
If players are using insidious I accept camping as a play style to an extent however, I DO NOT accept camping as a way to down/tunnel someone straight off the hook. If you do this you are just being a blatant fucking cunt, unless that survivor is a blatant fucking cunt, in which case it cancels out. Like AIDS.
---
Camp as a method of finding your next victim and when you see them, chase them. 
---
Alex’s is crap, you want more charges imo.
---
Pretty obvious she was memeing
---
it is MUCH harder to juke a legion during his fatigue cuz its way shorter and he can still see a lot
---
Yea that's definitely scummy and im not defending these guys one bit, but you might be able to bamboozle these idiots in the future
---
Because in our community they are celebrities? 
---
This has happened to me on PC as well multiple times. Badham and Haddonfield .
---
Don't take it from me, but you can be wrong no matter how many hours you have.
---
Tier up, you can’t see their aura but sometimes when you stalk through things and there’s someone there, it just gains the evil up
---
Pretty funny meme I gotta say
---
Lmao I play on a shitty laptop, can't run super well with high quality
---
Imagine telling someone to stop communicating with anybody, friends or not, in a game where being able to communicate with your teammates isn't intended. Holy crap.
---
You're completely missing the mark. Either you're thick or you're being blatantly obtuse. 
---
Fuck them
---
Regardless. You can't say that survivors being able to exchange information like that isn't broken as fuck.
---
eeeerm no not really. i have absolutely no problem with swf so youre just making yourself look like a whining baby killer that probably uses noed and dodges the lobby if 2 people join at the same time lmfaooo
---
Happens so much. I try to walk away immediately after hooking but if somebody is right there, I'm gonna smack them too. It isn't very fun for anyone involved.
---
I mean if he finds you early, and quickly downs you and breaks the gen, then it pretty much deleted the BNP.
---
when i don’t run it gens still go by too quickly even if i’m playing well 
---
Better for long haul over multiple gens, a rusher box can be quite valuable for cracking the last gen though.
---
I run urban too
---
I'd not help you either. Not giving that dude a 4k. Although, I'd be looking for hatch instead of nothing. 
---
Good job man, everyone thinks freddy is a garbage killer but really he's pretty balanced, he's hard for a reason
---
Okay might give lithe a try
---
This exactly. Its like they extend your hitbox or something when you drop it
---
I could see why that'd be frustrating... Im sorry for my original comment...
---
No? Nurse is easily the best killer on console still.
---
I'm saying low quality allows you to see more things, I play on a very good system and I run at low everything so I can see through grass. +23% Vision
---
Is anything that is a joke now considered a "meme"? Or does meme replace anything now? 
---
Yea, basic formula is that the first one is +25% mist, second is +50% mist, and the murky one is +75% mist.  So a murky and common or 2 uncommons are the same value overall.
---
The killer can tunnel you once they see you have a key in game anyways, It doesn’t matter if they see it beforehand. Also seeing survivor’s items is a feature specifically put in the game. Being able to counter the killer by telling your friends what the killer has was never intended and if it was you would be able to see the killer’s perks before the game started. Besides seeing items and seeing perks or not on the same level so a fairer change would be seeing the killer’s add-ons. Franklin’s demise would be almost useless anyways if you couldn’t see items. Noed should be changed to reward more skilled gameplay and allow it to be more enjoyable to play against like making the killer have a 5-10% movement speed buff and shortening attacks by like 30-50%. 
---
Erm, no not really. Funny how not everybody has the same opinion as you.
---
Also, good job on assuming stuff about me just because you don't like or agree with what I'm saying. Never touched NOED in my life and I'll take on a 2-man.
---
My toolbox repair like 2 survivor add streetwiste and you have gen rusher toolbox 
---
Ok here is the real reason. His power allows him to down multiple survivors, in contrast to the Hillbilly who can only down one but moves at super sonic speed. That means to best get use out of LF you ideally need to be able to find and hit at least two survivors with the chainsaw. 
---
While its certainly possible with some perks to find two together, the easiest and most reliable method is to just camp the hook and down the rescuer and the hooked survivors together. As you climb ranks survivors are more aware of this strategy and it becomes harder to use with any level of success. 
---
Getting mad at being camped is like being mad at getting hit through a pallet. It sucks but its a game mechanic and you have to play around it. At least theres a way to counter it
---
All of the main buildings where it can spawn have windows and pallets.  Asylum can have 2 pallets right at the entrance, the Game has 2 pallets right at the entrance....
---
It looks like you have hitbox behind pallet from side which killer attack 
---
Imagine thinking thinking playing on Very Easy and doing good makes you actually good. If they hadn't been on comms the guy on the hook couldn't have told them the hatch was there and this escape would have never happened. Any pleb can do good when they circumvent game mechanics. It'd be like bragging you always get a 4k when you use a noclip script on Hillbilly.
---
I occasionally do SWF. We never use comms in match and still have plenty of fun. 
---
I always wondered if Huntresses accidentally came across survivors in lockers when trying to reload hatchets. First game as Huntress I immediately found a survivor when trying to reload hatchets.
---
"Ha ha, these survivors aren't bad, This is fu---**OMAE WA MOU SHINDEIRU."** 
---
OoO Laurie is so fun though. ):
---
I wouldn’t even be mad if I was that billy 
---
Yeah, the SWF-comms plebs don't like it when you point out that they're playing the easiest version of the game.
---
I remember when the fixed the hitboxes and all the Huntress mains complained but that was the most accurate they've ever been rip
---
No problem.
---
O I N K  O I N K  M O T H E R F U C K E R S
---
I was playing David against a Myers on the game. He had tift of hair and tombstone. That meant he had unlimited tier 3 and could kill any survivor he caught. All my perks were useless. Dead hard, borrowed time, well make it and were gonna live forever. All for when your injured or unhooking which he obviously wasn't going to do. By the way, I was the obsession for some stupid reason. 
---
He caught and mori'd  2 people with 2 gens left. We finish a gen I went to the gen by the piggy slide by myself. I finish it the other guy opens a gate and leaves in a big hurry. I cant find the gate because I'm potatoe on that map. I got chased and lost him looking for the gate. Then had to open a gate fully and get out. Halfway through opening I could hear his heartbeat and started sweating. Just barely got out. 
---
Then you drop em to the ground to reload your hatchets 
---
&gt; Priorities &lt;
---
(I removed the name thanks) but the thing was she had cosmetics so I know she wasn't new
---
Uh, in what universe is using third-party voice comms in a game where you're not supposed to be able to communicate that way with your teammates, *not* unfair gameplay?
---
also everytime my swf group and i get into a game we are happy if we hear a nurse bc we know it will be an easy game. 
---
Care to show me where you’re “*not supposed to be able to communicate*”
---
This is at rank 1.
---
That sounds exactly like what a KILLER WOULD SAY! we're on to you Nea! 
---
Well then, refer to my 2nd point :D.
---
Dont expect too much of peoples in this game, I expect the least from them and when someone actually does something, I’m happy with it.
---
Oh my fucking god my ears kill me now
---
And you never knew, it could be for as-yet-unreleased characters, too.
---
Or is that another unwritten rules by survivors? 
---
The fact that there's no voice comms in the game? Or that the devs have said that this game was intended to be played between people who can't communicate? I hate it when people are blatantly obtuse.
---
I want an opt out feature, both Killer and Survivor, (with individual options for 2, 3, and 4 pperson teams) and bonus BP for Killers who face SWFs (25% per SWF player). And an SWF tag in lobby showing who's on a team. They're annoying as Killer but fucking hate getting paired with 2/3 man SWFs as Survivor. It's the worst.
---
well this is a new tier of low effort
---
When I encountered this,  I didn't hook anyone, I put them in dream state to share in my suffering. 
---
Lmfao, dude.
---
Im always like: "Well I will be nice no tunnel, no... Ok you little shit Cawabunga it is
---
Infinite load screens on PC not only loading into games but also just in to lobbies as well. Just had to end the game in task manager trying to get into a lobby and then the exact same thing happened again. 
---
I can dig it
---
Damn that's bullshit
---
I imagine bird watcher wouldn't be liked all that much, but the other two are really interesting and I can see their uses 
---
Now that's fan art I like. Also filthy smoker is Nurse.
---
[deleted]
---
I mean I agree she has the most potential and in the right hands yes the best. But like i said on console most people can't use her.
---
Shadow clone jutsu works too
---
Welcome to Dead By Daylight! The game where the real opponent is the game itself.
---
Should I now buy the Halloween and Saw Chapter? I actually have almost 9000 shards and what Killer or Survivor should I get next? Already have Letherface, Freddy, Clown and Hag. As survivor I got Feng Min.
---
Show me where. It’s not being obtuse if it’s never been said. 
---
Imagine using  PWYF with him
---
Lmao, dude stop down voting like a child 😂😂
---
Tier 3 low effort 
---
Tryhards and veterans don't like farming. I'm neither.
---
That awful! What a terrible bug they found! How did they do it? How? 
---
I just said it's been said, so... Yeah, you're being obtuse.
---
Rip
---
Anyone can say anything, prove it. 
---
Ooooh looks really good :D
---
According to who? You? Lmfao.
---
Yeah I realised this. I was just wondering for in game.
---
*everybody walks the dinosaur*
---
How?
---
I've already proved it. You're just being thick at this point. The devs have stated as much in promos in 2016, and more recently in a dev stream. Spare me your bullshit.
---
I had one guy sitting at some sort of rock next to one of those hills on a forrest map.
---
He teabagged and did his usual spiel. I sacrificed the rest of the team. He still did not move.
---
His buddy messaged me on steam telling me that he would not leave the game and that I should disconnect because he would just go afk and leave the game running over night if need be.
---
I took a screenshot, recorded a video, submitted both to behavior, practived a little bit and smacked the idiot down after about 2 minutes because getting there was not so hard. (btw, can you get bloodlust stacks by just staring at a survivor ?)
---
He disconnected on the way to the hook and I laughed all the way to the bank (100+BP game).
---
And people don't insult others by calling them "little guy", in the real world. Be prepared to do your own research, as well.
---
Spend the few bucks and unlock leatherface for bbq and chili. Slap that on doc and you can just go around shocking people. If you hook even one survivor you’ll often times get more bp than playing survivor.
---
I’ve spent too much time on this game to be mad at guys being obviously bad, i’ll just remember that its a complete deadweight, and that the saving priority he has is under the « doing gen » priority. Will cost me a hook, so I wont like him, but not gonna be mad no.
---
So you can’t prove it can you little buddy? Aw that sucks :/
---
Eh I’ve been using huntress lullaby with thrill of the hunt recently on my wraith at high rank. Survivors that like to gen rush get punished quickly for not cleaning the lullaby and end up handing me an easy late game clean up after I quickly stack up tokens. It’s a good way to keep a low key very effective totem up without people just immediately running to destroy it
---
I’m not sure if we’re allowed to give out someone’s name or not on here, but let’s just say it’s very obvious when you see it. He’s usually around the purple ranks I think.
---
I can, and did. Feel free to dig through all of that on your own time. And again, with the insults. Lmfao, I can sense the salt.
---
You do know that Noob3 earned the cosmetics fair and square but the game deleted them from his inventory, then when he tried to email BHVR they never responded so all he did was put his cosmetics back into his inventory.
---
Really? I dont main huntress or even killer really. Why is that?
---
Never spend all of it. Keep that 1 million.
---
Truth. Then they DC if you use a mori offering
---
You’re really going out of your way to still not be able to prove your point. Yikes also you’re the one down  voting who’s really salty now? :/
---
No Mither + Object of Obsession = I’m gonna be a first killed
---
It's a glitch but it could be that you where out of the heart beat
---
You're really going out of your way to be a pompous git, so... yeah, have fun complaining that I'm not giving any proof when I've literally told you where you can see it for yourself several times now. Yikes, indeed.
---
Never heard of a Drag King race
---
No we where both in the basement and huntress was on the stairs when we where unhooked and I saw the borrowed timer show up. 
---
How are there so many glitches on this game lol 
---
You can't crouch and use an object I think ? Anyway I don't crouch.
---
r/cosplay
---
I think that if the unhooker goes down the borrowed time timer ends
---
I’m not complaining, I’m saying your point in invalid because you can’t prove it. If you’re going to make such a claim you should be ready to have proof. Just be say it’s true doesn’t make it true. Also you can’t say I went out of my way when you actually replied to me first. So again yikesssss 
---
that fear was going through my head the whole time lmao
---
Yes there is. Don’t run it till they get the new patch done
---
Weird. There are so many glitches once. I cloudnt see the gens. Then there was the rank 20 glitch and all the weird hits and bugs. Happy cake day btw
---
Never expected a death note meme around here, and a good one also. Have my upvote
---
You barely spend any time reloading hatchets and it's short enough as is, a ~.4 difference doesn't do anything 
---
Kate's hair bugs on ps4, idk about other consoles
---
...am I the only one who noticed the killer power not matching Fredster's Sleepyboi power?  Either the game bugged or someone is lying...
---
I love this. 
---
Taking a hit for your teammate when you are no mither! 
---
This sums up my first ever experience with noed. From that day forward, I promised that I would never subject any survivors to something so evil.
---
I did prove it, and have proof. Not my fault or my problem that you don't want to go see it for yourself. Not to mention that you've been like this ever since my reply. Yikes, indeed. Think I'm done talking to the equivalent of a brick wall, some people have to go to work. You know, like they do in the real world.
---
Yeah, those hatchet hitboxes are so weird. You can stand on the ground in Grim Pantry and hit someone working *behind* the generator on the second floor of the main building, but hatchets can also go straight through someone's chest.
---
C'est la vie...
---
Him/her?
---
Hey, Wraith finally stopped skipping leg day!!
---
Wow hey thanks for the final paragraph sealing in the fact you can’t prove it. One love ❤️ 
---
Body Blocking Billy. Galaxy Brain move my dude.
---
Nah just Billy, Nurse, and Spirit on a cycle lol
---
By that logic, the survivor running up to the hatch while the killer's on their tail also creates a standoff.
---
It can't be that in this case because the unhooker hadn't gone down when both me and my friend went down. Knowing DBD there are just 2 versions of the bug lol 
---
I played a huntress game where all the pallets were invisible lmao. Thank you :D 
---
I hate killers that do this. Yeah, great, bloodpoints, woo. But strangely enough, I queued up to play dead by daylight, not to just be stared at while I play gen simulator lol
---
Why, thank you so much! HAHAHA I didn't know! Love The Nurse, tho, I kinda suck playing as her on console
---
Again, thank you!
---
This should stay. It's not a bug, it's a feature
---
We've gotten Ruin fairly recently and a few times in 2018
---
Hell I think in the last month of 2017 we had DS and Ruin twice each
---
Haha, nice, but you forgot the /s.
---
If only the good ones I didn’t have to pay for :)
---
Thanks, my man! You guys here are so kind. 
---
I do that too, when someone either DCs or kills himself on the hook
---
was that the day you became a huntress main
---
Unless I’m playing a meme build (or a toxic unbeatable build,) then yeah usually. Ruin doesn’t always work but when it does slow the game down, it alleviates some of the pressure to end chases fast and forces survivors to either hit perfect skill checks or waste time totem hunting. 
---
Omg I'll try to make this a habit haha
---
thank you!
---
A Thing-like monster that could disguise himself as an survivor sounds great, but i imagine it wouldn't work well due to in-game chat and voice chat. I'd still love to see an actual "Monster" Killer
---
and there ladies and getleman we see ppl who dont realy play the game that much :)
---
that's really sweet &lt;3
---
thanks a lot!!
---
I was kinda shy about posting here, now I'm feeling it!! 
---
This was so cool! A coordinated escape with a key is always fun, feels like a last resort kinda escape
---
You can decide if play as man or woman.
---
Maybe is better something like...
---
When you are the obsession and being chased when suddendly all gens are done and the killer's aura starts to shrine
---
*I guess I'll die*
---
For sure. It's just getting LF high enough to share BBQ&amp;C  and then getting Doc high enough to learn it. 
---
Thanks for the tip tho! I'll start grinding 
---
No I didn't. Why should we make one of the simplest, braindead killers even more braindead. It's fun to outplay your opponent by actually doing something that requiers skill
---
Egg
---
As the Legion. The Shape is Michael Myers a male
---
So pressing a button to cloak requires skill now? You definitely forgot the /s.
---
If he chainsaws, you just have to dodge it. If he misses, you're most likely going to get away. I don't know why I got downvoted, people don't like Borrowed Time saves against face campers? It's not even toxic, I'm just trying to save my teammate, I'm not going to let him die.
---
Sorry, i was distracted and switched them in my mind XD
---
Just play huntress lol
---
Do gens if they’re camping the hatch. Especially if you only have one left. That gives you three escapes instead of one. I’ve done this many times. Once all gens are completed they panic and abandon the hatch.
---
I've had worse. Got 5 stacks, down a survivor and as I'm licking off my fingers the totem gets destroyed
---
Scrap unnerving presence. It's only good with impossible skillchecks doctor build and to kinda counter DS.
---
Hex: Ruin would be much better to.
---
Also Spirit Fury + Enduring is good.
---
Alright Tsun Zu how are you going to dodge a chainsaw when you are unhooking someone which locks you in place? You're downvoted because your scenario is nominated for a documentary of it starring Leonardo DeCaprio.
---
Are you playing stupid..? Did you need examples of how third-party voice apps can give you a competitive advantage?
---
No, but predicting the vault requires skill. I think you forgot your brain
---
-Healthy survivor cleaning my devour hope totem (5 stacks)
---
-Lunge at survivor
---
-Eorvivor gets downed and totem gets destroyed
---
Ruin is good regardless.
---
There are very few perks as versatile.
---
There is no reason not to use it unless you want more challenge.
---
I didn't say it's OP, I said you're insecure and a bad Billy if you think need it. 
---
I’m not playing stupid, i just don’t think it’s unfair and I especially am not going to get so upset I take it to reddit crying about it. 
---
And if you tunnel them after that and face camp in retaliation they go afk because you were being toxic. Right. 
---
Again, cloaking doesn't require skill. If anybody forgot their brain, it's you.
---
Makes sense. Don’t want a witch hunt now do we lol. I’ll try to stay out of purple ranks. 
---
Unnerving presence is for terror radius. As far as I know, anyone in the terror radius won't hear you transition. Plus Bloodpoints. Ruin gets broken too fast with Swf teams so I don't use it much. Definitely want to keep a tracking advantage. 
---
They have to use dead hard to do this exploit
---
one of the reasons why I don't use DS
---
it HAS TO BE TRUE, IT MUST
---
^ This
---
It's a new bug, it will be fixed in the mid chapter patch tho.
---
Wrong stats unfortunately - moris &amp; escape rates per map. There was a stream with avg number of kills for every killer (and, I think, for different ranks too)
---
lol it's because when you use an offering technically you're using the billy but you're playing as Freddy if you get what I mean 
---
As someone who plays both killer and survivor (more survivor than killer), I agree with this. Killer mains complain way too much about SWF. If you're a good enough killer, it doesn't matter. Just like, if you're a good enough survivor, it doesn't matter if you're playing SWF or solo. You're always going to have games where you stomp or get stomped. It's part of playing competitive games or competitive anything, really. 
---
I usually like to fake the unhook, then the Billy usually will run into the hooked survivor. You would want to save at that point and bodyblock for the injured person. This usually only works when your next to an exit gate though.
---
Daddys nail polish 
---
Oh so you mean distressing?
---
Unnerving presence increases skillcheck chances and makes them more difficult inside the TR.
---
Because there's too many SWF players, they wouldn't stand for it. In their mind, it's less important that they're using boosts to rank up, or that voice-comm makes matches less fun for their opponent. They just want to enjoy their night and chat with their buddies. Unfortunately we all have to kind of appease them at this point, SWF has brought in a lot of players who otherwise wouldn't have played. 
---
I think it is dependant on the killer you play at this point.
---
Nurse and Hillbilly: Advantage
---
Hag: Slight disadvantage
---
Everyone else: Disadvantage
---
Haha! Thanks dude! glad you like it! 
---
Is the event happening?
---
Oh shit yea. Lol I change it real quick
---
Well if the Billy is that bad then you didn't really a big plan to beat him like that. He could just walk up to you while still revving his chainsaw and hit you. That's why the plan doesnt work.
---
I'll try this. But M&amp;A Myers is still my go to.
---
In the future use isthereanydeal.com to find sales. The game has been 50% off on other sites for a long time (they give steam keys)
---
is this only in the US?
---
Like I said, just give it a go. Use distressing not unnerving presence. I got those two mixed up
---
Too many people throw *tunneling* around too often. I got spammed by a group of 4 last night for *tunneling*. Yet, every time I hooked someone, it was someone different from the time before. 
---
If SWF isn't OP, neither is Omegablink Nurse.
---
It doesn't matter *why* you're using it, just because your main intent isn't to gain a competitive advantage doesn't mean you're not gaining a competitive advantage. Right?
---
My bad
---
Just imagine if the buff occurred for the crows above your head. It would also give you the amount of crows nearby serving as an action speed buff and a kinda premonition. 
---
I wanna see how many more of these camo cosmetics there are
---
But it doesn’t give an advantage if you don’t talk about the game lol. Not to mention almost every swf I’ve been in puts the survivors at a disadvantage because people play music over the game and sandbag for fun
---
True but i also wasn’t ready to get looped to all hell
---
Playing with friends is null if you dont talk to them.
---
Yea, 4 men swf they do all the gens and 3 of them dc ;) It's to easy to abuse unfortunately
---
If it’s my friend? Oh I dead hard to the box and laugh at them when they die next to me.
---
If it’s a stranger? I probably let them have it.
---
I’m a good friend to have apparently lol
---
1 out of 4, utter shit.
---
Just give survivors ways to communicate without swf, add more time in matches with a secondary onjective and balamce the killers.
---
Claudette camouflage costume???
---
What he said was toxic. “I dont care how survivors feel”.
---
Cool, got any suggestions?
---
I agree with you as a LF main I get a lot of hate from people calling me a camper even though I leave them alone
---
Mad?
---
5 blink nurse is just bad lol, if you’re good at nurse you don’t need 5 and if you’re bad at nurse you’re just gonna get juked 5 times instead of one 
---
I think the point is we don't like having to play Nurse or Billy, or else be crushed by swf. We want an even balance.
---
Playing with NOED is a disadvantage, not the other way around. You're giving up a valuable perk slot for a shitty crutch that only activates when the game is already over. Those kills are irrelevant. Even if you go from a 0k game to a 4k game because of NOED you aren't accomplishing all that much. But in the vast majority of games you'll probably pick up 1 extra kill and it's mostly meaningless.
---
As for the facecamping/proxy camping, they're basically the same thing. If you're just hovering around a hook waiting for an unhook you're actively losing the game for yourself. It really is no different from face camping, you're just using the distance as a shield to save yourself from 'face camper' accusations while also using it as a weapon to entice people to unhook. You'd be better off causing map pressure.
---
As for the perks - survivor perks are far less impactful than killer perks. Killer perks drastically alter the game flow, survivor perks can be good but they just aren't as strong. Whatever killer you plan on playing, figure out what perks you're going to run and work towards them. It'll probably be BBQ-RUIN-X-Y
---
Because Thanatophobia does absolutely nothing worthwhile. 
---
It's pretty easy to juke Legion's frenzy right now. The visual vfx makes it nearly impossible to see in your peripheral vision during it &amp; after the frenzy, the camera is broken and snaps around in weird directions.
---
I would be down 
---
And the VHS Tapes too
---
It ain't tho
---
Yes I'm sure most people only talk about Game of Thrones what's on Netflix or the new Kanye album or something, but you're starting to reach hard now by trying to argue that coordinated voice comm is akshually a *disadvantage*, lol. I'd admit that Discord/PartyChat are not insurmountable challenges. Would you admit that they're still competitive advantages for most players that use them?
---
Thats what I did.
---
No regerts.
---
My friend was being trolled  by a Meg. She wouldn't unhook him at all, just spamming M1. The other rando was doing nothing. I was unable to unhook my friend because my mouse is slow. My friend dcd and I ended up sandbagging the two randoms. We weren't going to escape anyways
---
This is real late in replying but I'm not sure what you're even talking about. Legion just downs you in 20 seconds and theres nothing you can do. If you make nurse miss one blink cycle you've exceeded the amount of time legion takes to down you.
---
&gt;NOED
---
NOED has no purpose on The Legion. His frenzy doesn’t work with **Exposed**, and a +4% to Speed isn’t too substantial 
---
&gt;BBQ 
---
Sure
---
Too many, Take2 CEO.
---
It's better than Ruin, I mean 
---
I think the point is, too many people complain about the game and how they perceive the game is *supposed* to be played. 
---
Personally, I think 3 tracking perks (BBQ, Rancor, &amp; Whispers) is a bit much, especially given that Frenzy's  *"Killer Instinct"* effect already reveals people in your terror radius. I'd replace at least one of them (your choice really) with something that helps slow the game down. I'd suggest Hex: Ruin, or in lieu of that, Thanatophobia, Overcharge, or Sloppy Butcher (which gets mixed results on Legion depending on whether or not survivors want to heal against you.
---
thanatopia, Hex: ruin
---
It was in the context of selecting Legion. Then the body of your post complained about having to face Legion. 
---
I had a farmer but was playing solo so I tried showing everyone my key to try to get the trophy. A dwight ran off with it and left through the exit gate. Fuck you, dwight 
---
I've had experience with both... ruin is better
---
I don't have Ruin, and I'd like to run Thanatopia, just wasn't sure what to switch it out with, thanks!
---
Glad you liked it! thanks for reading. if I get more people asking for the continuation I am willing to continue the series. So share it with friends! 
---
They’re a competitive advantage of you use them that way and try hard for an escape, but a swf goofing off is no different than a bunch of randoms and is more likely to waste pallets and body lock each other for fun
---
When a match is going badly, I'd rather a killer ended it quickly. I get that they are trying to be friendly, but farming is boring.
---
👍 this response right here!
---
&gt;I just don’t think it’s bad, it’s just a game.
---
Ok, again.....nobody said it's "bad". We're saying that it provides you a competitive advantage over your peers and the opponent. 
---
I do that to help teammates even when I'm solo. You wouldn't believe how many times killers blame SWF when the 4 of us are solo players. 
---
Gives me hope I can get Discordance from the shrine soon.
---
Bamboozle on Nurse is better though
---
If you're good at survivor you don't need a 3rd party program to know where the killer/hex totems are. I guess you're not.
---
YES
---
I like the fact that you added the TM
---
Gotta Unbreakable with sabo squad.
---
It took me forever to find it 
---
Yea me using object of obsession and telling everyone on my team where the Trapper is putting his traps, is a fair and balanced experience.
---
Its not about the points at that point its about who has the bigger dick
---
Unnerving + Madness skill checks is definitely tougher.
---
NOED and Rancor on legion seems pointless particularly both of them at once, other two are fine
---
When the last generator is popped, I always seem to find that it's game over for me. It just becomes toxic survivors t-bagging and flashlighting at the exit gate so I run NOED to keep them from stalling out the game further. 
---
I like Rancor! It's like Bitter Murmur but plus a free mori! I used Bitter Murmur before but it always seemed useless to me, the survivors never stuck around the generator long enough for it to be useful so moving aura versus a stand still blip are just as useful to me, but I think that's a me problem....
---
"Why?" I'm bad :(   
---
Plus it always seems to keep the chase going, I know if a survivor has left the area so I don't waste my time. Sadly, since I don't have ruin, I have a hard time slowing the game down sometimes, Whispers helps me find the survivors when I need to.
---
With that in mind is that anything I should switch it out for or any way I can change my gameplay style up? 
---
Both sides are toxic. DS is stupid. NOED is bad as well, if not more of a crutch than DS. Both sides have cry babies that think their side is weak.
---
Police?  I'd like to report a suspicious person. Yes Officer, it's that poster up above. 
---
If it's that big of an issue, run enduring, lightborn/Franklin's demise, and mad grit. Boom, there go all of your issues down the toilet. Survivors have to deal with moris and instadowns galore, you can deal with some flashlights and ds.
---
r/mydbdperks
---
I didn’t get hit 4 matches in a row that way but I had 4 matches straight with lag. When the skill check doesn’t register when you hit the skill check 
---
Which one of the two would you recommend? 
---
Learn to check? Ok smart ass checking the ping won’t do anything if it’s green when the match starts then in match I just start getting hit from a distance 
---
Nice!
---
Sloppy, Bloodhound, Nightborn. My last slot is either NOED, Monstrous Shrine, or anything depending on how bloodthirsty I feel. 
---
I have a particularly hard time finding survivors, I don't have a hard time with mind games or jukes or anything else, but finding survivor pre-chase is incredibly difficult for me. I was thinking, based on the advice of other people running
---
BBQ, Rancor, Whispers, and Thanatopia. Although, I suppose that's still are too much aura reading?
---
Wraith is probably equal to doctor, they both arent great but can do okay
---
How do you grab people escaping through hatch om ps4? No options appeared för me.
---
No good idea about killers. I don’t play that much but BBQ is a must cuz I hate camping and for bp sake.
---
For survivor perks imo;
---
“Spine Chill” is a must and my favorite. It’s the best perk for countering most stealthy killers like wraith, myers, freddy, pig, spirit, and all other killer build with less terror radius (except m1). It saved me so many times, so I can go hide or be ready to get chased. Too bad, it is an underrated perk, but I can’t live without it.
---
“After Care” is my favorite too cuz I always play as solo queue. Knowing each other location help my teammates and myself to get a job done faster.
---
“Autodidact” is the perk that I really love to use, but not very effective in real situations and I found it useless in the end. Most of the time, other survivors unable to escape so it’s very difficult to heal them and getting at least 3 token. It’s a good counter to sloppy butcher, thanatophobia, chrolobhobia, or even dying light. But not really useful...
---
“Borrow Time” is the perk that I want everyone running it. I feel totally confident and fearless when I try saving teammates against campers. So at least they can prolong the chase just a little bit if they get tunnelled. However, low terror radius killers won’t make the perk triggered. It’s kinda exploiting tbh.
---
“Kindred” let teammates do something more useful instead of running around and do nothing while I’m on hook, obviously.
---
Only if you're laaaaaaaame. 😝
---
/r/whowouldwin
---
I mean more about when you load into the game AFK. It's one thing if you have to leave mid-matcg for an emergency or something. It's another thing if you leave to get a snack before the game starts like a certain friend of mine...
---
Funny I see this meme now, I uave 15 abony mori's on hag and am about to prestige her, so I decided to use all my ebony mori's. However, I only mori the people that hit me with a decisive strike, so this meme doesn't really fit on me in my eyes
---
Ruin isn't essential, but it really helps the early game and slows down the progress on the gens in that small amount of time you spend at the start of the game walking towards gens
---
Refuting my paddin' with facts about console banning.
---
That's a paddin'.
---
Lul look at these survivor mains 
---
I've also experienced this on PS4
---
Play more and get better, easy fix.
---
Put them on a hook and they'll stop.
---
You are playing wrong you are not meant to tunnel one survivor when using the power.  Use it to locate and hit multiple survivors at once or like you said to mind game the survivor.  I use it to vault and end the chase faster.
---
So sick of this. I had one recently were i hooked one and the other three ran up in plain view with torches. Because i stayed and fought them off instead of going and admiring the empty gens im a camper....
---
I use Ruin and NOED for the post-game salt, but I don't need them. It's rare I even see endgame.
---
Nope, you get hit because your hit ox stays in the same place, if you were to run, you would take your hitbox with you. Funny, it's as if your hitbox moves with your character model
---
Just r2 them as if you were gonna attack them while there jumping in and you should be able to grab them if you are close enough. 
---
All I want tbh is for killers to not run NOED 
---
I have never experienced it. I only get hit during the animation.
---
I love the fact everyone uses self care i just run wraith with nurse calling. Very effective
---
Amen 🙏
---
Considering how incredibly busted SWF is. You'll get nothing but crocodile tears from me, bud. 
---
Get rid of Whispers and throw on Distressing.  I find that survivors tend to stop mending when they hear the heartbeat and then they drop more often.  But that is just me.
---
Those hands are actually pretty good
---
They said that, but given the fact that SWF will obviously use comms and given the fact comms obviously break a number of perks and killers, it's either not true or proof they did a terrible job of designing a game for SWF. 
---
I use NOED for end game, and most often I get the jump on them, which I think is due to distressing.
---
Didn’t Wretched shop used to have all 3 windows open? Lmao it’s a lot better now compared to what it used to be.
---
Tap attack instead of holding for lunge
---
Because killer will blame swf whenever they can for a loss, regardless of whether or not the swf actually try harded or messed around

He's not playing stupid. He is stupid.

That’s nice very nice

If fair means free win well then....

Is it just me or does the image feel like it is a video that is slowly zooming it?
---
You might have already seen this, that's because I just reposted it. Didn't know that the link would change the thumbnail.
---
No, the most terrifying thing is running to the exit and all of a sudden those entity spikes shoot up in front of you from Blood Warden activating lol

#bushlivesmatter
---
Both killers and survivors can glitch onto it from above 
---
"It's just a video game" is bullshit reasoning. If that's a good enough reason to not care about comms it's also a good enough reason not to care about camping or tunneling. Or even hacking. It's just a game, bro, who care if the other side is ruining your fun of playing?
---
Huntress is just like. This is my seat. Don’t you dare touch the hatchet. 
---
i dont because i know how to pressue
---
I really like to put sprint burst, urban evasion, and bond with the last spot saved for a team helper perk on my dwight. Most are for my survival with evasion but its important to to have one aura perk to find people and then the last one is to help keep your friends alive, I like barrowed time personally but others will work
---
The hatch actually spawned right next to the hook WHILE I was on it. Killer turned around and saw it, and stood on it watching me die 😭
---
The sub doesn’t need more cluttering of the same posts. Just please stop.
---
I mean, play how you want to play, but with three streamers on and a team that want to farm, I'd be farming too. Although I'm not sure why you'd post this, just play however you want to. Survivors get pissed either way. 
---
Just you
---
Rank one means nothing but time spent lol. I’ve moonwalked rank 1 killers around loops and been smashed by rank 7s
---
I never run Ruin in Hillbilly. Discordance does a way better job and I tend to stop people on a gen alone with BBQ anyway. Ruin isn’t needed with his map pressure.
---
I mean I can get rank 1 easy solo and never have playing with friends 
---
Yeah, some 4-man SWFs are really powerful, but some of them are overly altruistic and are very easy to beat. Yeah, it sucks to go up against a strong team, but not every match I play as killer is as hard, even when it's a SWF group. You win some, you lose some. We tend to only remember the times we got destroyed by a 4-man, but don't really remember the times we destroyed them.
---
Whats sandbag mean? One term im not familiar with. Is it bp farm off hook?
---
I personally like to AFK as Freddie. Survivors have essentially no way of interacting with him so they get almost no points in Altruism or whatever the Boldness one is.
---
Except they can because you all appear together in the lobby. 
---
this is actually really adorable.
---
+1
---
Ok? What he said is still toxic and is why I said he is toxic.
---
I swear these ppl will enjoy the game more without the killers 
---
**Assymeteical** games will never achieve because they are assymetrical
---
One guy that i hate playing with tries to find every glitch and/or exploit in every game he joins with me, which is the reason I hate playing with him. 
---
College length?? Dude what? He obviously hit a nerve with you you’re getting so upset and are trying to project it onto him. Why are you taking it so personally if you dont use the perk? Really makes you think....
---
For a good nurse it's a wasted slot
---
Vocal percussion on a whole nother level...
---
Making excuses for losses, and capitalizing on boosts the game isn't balanced for aren't mutually exclusive. A ton of killers cry 'SWF' whenever they lose regardless of how bad they played.... *and* SWFs make the game easier for survivors. Both can be true. 
---
That's not how this meme works.
---
Yeah that probably doesn't help. Still, it would be nice to have a way to stop getting audio notifs when they're in close successions or something
---
Probably because 1/3 of all games have some degree of salt, but nobody reports on this third.
---
My point is it doesn't matter if you think communicating isn't inteded. It's a multiplayer game in 2019, of couse you need the option to play with friends and of course they're going to communicate with each other. You think it's wrong or give them unfair advantages? Nice, I guess, but that's just how it is.
---
Sorry I'm new to the game, but isn't it REALLY obvious when they have it, since all survivors get the Exposed effect immediately after the last gen is finished?
---
I’ll keep an eye out 
---
Yet, I replied to your post because you said something I disagree with. It's not logical to reply to a different post or make a new post when I'm trying to say something about your post
---
I can think of a solution.
---
his ability could be to use his tentacles to draw someone closer to him.
---
Self care for healing, lithe for exhaustion perk, premonition for when the killer is coming your way, and we're gonna live forever, wglf is replacement for until you Max everyone, then go with ace in the hole
---
I feel like it's very fair right now, it's a risk/reward kind of thing. You could wait to get the stun, but risk getting hit. Also, it wouldn't make sense to do this with the pallet since it's quite logical that you can't keep your momentum when trying to throw down a large piece of wood with enough force to hurt a killer.
---
 No, they don't fall out.
---
Be very scared if you find the Gen Rush crew
---
Yea, hence why I think people wouldn't agree with it. Imagine getting to repair gens quick because some crow boys are near you
---
I can see the nurse in the Victorian skin smoking a cigarette out of one of those long holders
---
Body blocking
---
What kind of madman does this
---
Inaccurate the spirit is not reading hentai
---
Exposed only appears after someone is hit
---
Gotta fit Open Handed in there somehow
---
Eh, I think after a legion we need a break from killers that bend game mechanics 
---
Then the one who was playing sure didn’t seem to think so.
---
Click link
---
Greeted with non skippable 15 second ad
---
See yuh
---
The only people who complain about hatch stand offs are killers and the survivors that over commit to the hatch. More often the killers. The same ones that stand right on top of the hatch and hold the game hostage. 
---
I’m really close to Platinum on PS4!! I just need to reach max prestige on one character.
---
No, he's right. No matter how laggy the connection is, I've never had problems with skill checks. Well, on Xbox, PS4 is a different story and its not instant.
---
Just out of curiosity, are you on PS4 connected via Wi-Fi on the other side of your house from where the modem/router is using a plasma tv that even on Game Mode it still has terrible input lag?
---
Do you never use comms because you have some sort of rule against it?  Because that's idiotic.  You never use comms because the people you play with don't want to talk with someone who thinks like you do about the game.
---
The legion one I used cold dirt and the green tape for CD got it first try
---
WAH WAH FREDDY IS BAD BECAUSE I PLAY HIM AS A  CHASE KILLER WAH WAH
---
You heard those breaths after blinking? There's a reason a Nurse with add ons that increase fatigue time is called Heavy Smoker Nurse. Yeah I also suck at her, specially when my go to is M&amp;A Myers.
---
Welcome to Reddit, theres a lot of crap and a lot of gold. Mostly gold tho. And memes. I look forward to see more of you, I don't really like overly cute fanart so your style really hits the spot.
---
We don't use comms because we think it's stupid. It makes the game easy AF and ruins half the fun.
---
F (spoopy flashlight)
---
It's more so salty at higher ranks cause people think that a high rank means your better
---
1 DC = 1 Free kill. Congrats! Killers have an ez win!
---
BHVR announces nerfs to DS and hatch. Shortly after, salty entitled crybaby survivor mains spam their steam page with negative reviews, over 500 of them. Shortly after, BHVR backpeddles on DS/Hatch nerfs. I don't remember killer mains ever doing that before any killer nerfs.
---
Whenever a gamebreaking bug on the survivor side is found, it's fixed fairly quickly, meanwhile it's been over a month and all killer audio is still fucked. Vacuum pallets remained in the game for over a year, as did infinites. SWF will never be addressed or balanced.
---
Have you heard her breathe? She smokes big fat cigars at least.
---
IDK, I'm still waiting on my authentic clown belly with belly button maggots.
---
Np
---
Just tried that and it ended up working, had me scared for a second though lol thought I would have to re buy my stuff
---
She has one of those cigarette holders for cigars then lol
---
Oh god, I really hate that. Thanks for the clarification
---
He needs em karmas
---
That is quite the victim complex you have going on there. Kind of embarrassing when you realize its over a video game.. Couldn't imagine being this negative in my life.
---
Yeah that Nea creeps me out too
---
This question...is odd to me.  You sound like a super sweet person, but I don't think any Killers are creating their build based on what they believe Survivors want, and I don't think Survivors need to base their build on what Killers want - base your build on what your play style is.  What covers your weak spots?  What enhances your stronger play areas?  Build the best you.  :-)
---
I will say that its pretty clear that t-bagging and camping are very triggering for many players so thats the place where people could create a lot more peace.  But I don't think you need to worry about your build.
---
On PS4, when survivors drop pallets, they get stuck in a standing animation, even when they run or are downed. Don't know what triggers it because it only happens sometimes, and I see it as killer and survivor.

I was gonna say Empathy, Botany, Streetwise, Leader. That works too though
---
People hate every killer for some reason, and everyone says every killer is game breaking, which is why everyone hating on Legion right now is like, lol, ok.
---
Out of my last 15 killer games, 13 of them were against swf.  Mostly also a rank 5 trying to carry a rank 18 or so. I know because I wanted to do a little experiment so I started asking in post game chat and checking steam friends. I'm not saying this is the same for everyone, but it certainly happens. 
---
I love how his buddy told you to disconnect pretty much making sure you get nothing from the game. God forbid you tell your friend to stop being a ass and accept his defeat.

Laughs in survivor nerfs
---
Replied to the wrong comment, sorry for the ping
---
The hooks are being spaced out, though...
---
Check out the 10th of January dev stream.
---
People hate legion because of their moon walk cheese, other than that they are counterable
---
He just wants to be a victim. Look at his post history, its incredibly toxic.
---
I honestly don't mind it, they've nerfed a lot of the survivors loops anyway. And bamboozle is a thing for us killers, one of the best perks in the game against good players.
---
There has not been a single killer since release that has received even close to as much backlash  as legion. 
---
This is also backlash from both sides, there are very few people I’ve met that like legion yet most are fine with all other killers for the most part. 
---
Legion is completely broken. He takes all the fun out of the game. There is no counterplay to him in a chase

When I attempt to load into a survivor game I am put into an endless loading screen. When I attempt to play as killer, I sit in the lobby for a while until the lobby gets closed. Anybody have a clue as to what's going on here? I did validate my game files on steam and it didn't fix it so that's out of the question.
---
He’s not good. He’s low tier at best, but he’s a bitch to fight against. He’s unfun and is not healthy for the game. Watch Bricky’s videos on legion to fully understand 
---
If you want to please killer, don't use any good perks and especially not DS. Also do not loop them best is to let them hit you.  
---
he‘s not op - he is just really annoying to play against, especially with good addons
---
Pan camera left to right, see nothing.
---
Do it again, nothing. 
---
Do it again, nothing.
---
Do it again, Myers is standing there. 
---
Yeah, I’m aware. I’ve had a number of, “arguments,” with him in which he simply flings insults towards me while playing victim card and if you saw how he talked about killers you’d think infinite’s still existed on every map. 
---
Ive got the same problem, if you've a fix soon tell me please
---
Prove thyself and leader won't be receiving buffs. The devs said they were only testing something with them. Though if there were more objectives to do, then people would probably not care as much about action speed perks as they do now

Killer is a free win at low ranks. Play whatever’s fun for you, but learning survivor as a new player is a lot harder than killer 
---
Every time  :)
---
That is ptb I play on console we have not got the patch yet. 
---
Red hair = Meg. Okay
---
Legion is only OP for the one or two survivors whose match he can make hell, but you're likely going to 3-4K more often with other killers. 
---
I admit to gate teabagging, but I only do it if the killer is a camper. 
---
What’s your twitter account I’ll send you proof

And there Ladies and Gentleman we see ppl who dont realy pay attention to reddit flairs :)
