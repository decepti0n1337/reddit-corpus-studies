NOT

GENTAP

---
you idiots...
---
---
---
My God that was one of my favorite parts of the entire game lmao
---
They're sending him off with a neon encore
---
gotta sell them auric cells. at least they're using the money to fix the gam... oh wait
---
Sure.
---
Can I have a BP bonus for being the camped sacrifice when they mistaken me for being swf with the other 3 players and I'm not? Because I also find that frustrating.
---
Ya see it's 1 thing to be pulled off a hook .002 seconds after the killer put you on cause a retarded survivor wants points but it's another thing to be instantly focused by a killer just to get that sacrifice. If a survivor is being a tea bagging little prick by all means destroy him. But if I'm legit trying to play and I die within 3 minutes cause of a camping asshole that's when I get annoyed
---
SWFs should be nerfed, a BP bonus doesn't really do much. If you are a part of a SWF you should only be allowed to bring in 2 perks. Solo survivors should remain at 4 perks due to their disadvantage.
---
Happened to me while I was playing Huntress. Thought a survivor popped out lmao
---
Survivors: Do generators as fast as possible, actively ignoring anything that could hinder their escape. 
---
NOED: exists because no one cleansed any. 
---
Survivors: Pikachu face
---
They actually did  
---
they bought themselves off their previous owner and decided to go full cosmetic to get the money back  
---
that was their reasoning, don't argue with me
---
Take a look around the sub. There's video's on YouTube. You have to actively ignore it to not see it.
---
Thats what he said yeah
---
As much as I see toxic Surviviors I also see toxic killers so...it balances out if that is the standard lol
---
Yes but the way you said it, it seemed like you meant that killers were the only toxic ones
---
why did't you all like... leave?  
---
"mE WaNT sAvE eVEryOnE!"  
---
"oOF mE DeD!"  
---
"sTuPId nOEd kIddO!"
---
Hahah I‚Äôm not sure who I like better!
---
or  
---
you could... cleanse totems
---
yeah i always kind of wondered what the hell was he thinking when he said that
---
It's 2 schools of thought. I would prefer, both as killer and survivor to just get maximum points and let the survivors walk, versus just killer plays normal and ends game quickly. Agree to disagree.
---
I‚Äôm sure she at least looks better than you!

I hate the corn as well. It‚Äôs easy for me to lose a Survivor without the Madness effects. It gets worse when I‚Äôm playing Spirit because I can‚Äôt see the scratch marks that well in the corn. Some of the main buildings can be hell to chase a Survivor at too. Unless I‚Äôm sure I can catch them, I‚Äôll just immediately leave the loop and go find someone else. They‚Äôre almost infinites. At least there‚Äôs only around 1-2 that can spawn, unlike Haddonfield, where any house with a window is an infinite. Balanced Landing makes that entire map hell. If you ask me, that‚Äôs the map that needs a good looking at.

Wuth her sickness, she can counter perks like Mettle of Man, Adrenaline, Iron Will and she can also counter Instant Heals mid chase. For me, it's enough to put her in mid tier, around Pig and Myers. She is also a 115 speed killer which can become a ranged killer, and yeah, survivors can not cleanse and gen rush her, but don't forget that the broken status negates the heal from Adrenaline and most of the survivors gen rush just because they have Adrenaline to heal them in end game. So most of the survivors will cleanse themselves just because of this reason. She can run perks like Monitor and Abuse for ambush and down the survivors which decide to not cleanse or she can run perks like Enduring and Spirit Fury, so she can deal with looping. With some buffs ( like, make fully sickness to give more effects to the survivors, which may help you in chases or in stalling the game and survivors might have more reasons to cleanse themselves and make her again 115% speed while holding Vile Purge) she might become easily a top 5 killer. But right now, she is just mid tier.
---
Yeah, that's my only real peeve in this game so far. Everything else about the community is unironically lovely. Most of the people I run into are super friendly and I love this game.
---
But it's kinda annoying when you get the random rager who is mad that you "camped" because they literally followed you to the hook, tried to body block it, and then didn't walk away to let them unhook for free.
---
People call camping sometimes if you don't immediately run to the far corner of the map when you hook.
---
Tunneling is kinda whatever. There are usually 2 survivors you can cycle through hooks so I'll do that when I can, but I'm only a mediocre killer right now so if you run straight into me and you're injured I'm gonna down/hook you. I'm not skilled enough to be magnanimous because if I don't have someone in a chase or on a hook, I might never see another survivor all game.
---
with this system you get punished if the survivors are bad/selfish. since if they don't save anyone, you only get 1 hook instead of 3
---
I had to stop playing the other day. 2x party streamers burned and I didn't load in. Then a cake offering and no load in. Tried another cake and finally loaded in to end up chased for ages straight  at the start and hooked and no one came to get me off the hook.
---
It‚Äôs two different opinions and whilst yours is perfectly fine and I think it‚Äôs great (I still personally don‚Äôt want to farm), there are people who disagree (not only with you but with others) and are getting shit for not wanting to farm with the survivors. I do farm as a killer sometimes but if I want the game to be over then I‚Äôm not gonna farm coz the game fucked over everyone. It‚Äôs good some people do farm but still you can‚Äôt expect everyone else to.
---
&gt;lol what?
---
Your comment implies that I implied that they were doing us a favor. Lmao
---
If the comment I posted to doesn't make your brain hurt from the stupidity, then I understand your ignorance. 
---
Making an assumption, then pretending you have a valid point because you run with that assumption, is very dumb. Like, you probably think you can win arguments with it, and I hope someone films you trying, and posts it on reddit.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
.... it doesn't?
---
I dont think Zet0r is the guy who originally did this since his channel is so small
---
I mean you can just go and ask him on discord
---
Record it an link it, that glitch hasn't been seen for awhile and I'd be 100% surprised if it happens again. I have a lot of doubt that you're telling the truth. Even in the magical world where you do get hit, just run to a loop. I don't dc when a teammate leads the killer to me while my gen is 90%, which is one of the most infuriating things in the game. I don't even dc if it's a 3 man or if all my teammates dc. I like blood points and the game isn't over if the killer gets you at the beginning.
---
Feng is free as well. It shouldn‚Äôt matter if you have to pay for them or not.
---
yeah that's it really, that and just whatever perk kills them is instantly trash, a crutch, the only reason I won, and only used for noobs. Like I mean hey, if you're so good, you should know about this perk, and how to counter it yeah? 
---
But yeah, I'm just gonna keep playing in a way that makes sense, rather than this supposed forced politeness I'm apparently required to have, and hopefully find a way to remove/mute lobby chat, or wait for that to be added, and apparently set my profile to private, because some take it a *little* too far.
---
well it shouldn't be something to complain about still. The survivor isn't exactly holding the game hostage or anything and the killer still has full control of either chasing or killing the survivor out of the game.
---
This clown is not yet erect.  He needs some fingering.  Gotta get his little red hat standing up.
---
I'm not actually part of his discord, though I might join it and ask
---
Not really. no
---
It's similar to how thot is an acronym, but it's used as an adjective.
---
lol, tragic
---
I'm not sure if I want to be leading that race!  I'm not a cotton tail, but I do feel for those who are.  Feelsbadman.
---
oh I mean sure, it's not a huge problem, just kind of annoying, I either waste some time, or indulge their bm. Either way I "lose", at least in their eyes.
---
Just playing advocate and explaining the other side.
---
I never got a prompt. I was trying to get the achievement. I downed all 4 but was not able to kill them when I was chasing. I know when I used it before I'm pretty sure I couldn't lunge. And I would just grab them and kill them. This time nothing
---
Allow me to introduce you to my full hex spirit build.

Devour Hope, Haunted Grounds, Ruin, and Thrill of the Hunt.  Mother Daughter ring for MAX speed, and either Prayer Beads or a Haunting Recovery add on.  You hardly need to patrol gens, to wait until someone touches a totem and zoom across the map.

You're acting like they can't announce more than 1 thing per day/week

Oh no, they can. They can do whatever they like. But hyping up a completely normal announcement for no reason is a dick move.

Who on twitter said they were working with Lionsgate?
---
C U R S E D
---
Yeah, I thought a survivor rushed right into it after I got hatchets, I was so confused.

I keep saying the se thing, just fix this stupid stuff. I never had a problem until the major update last year. Ever since I get frozen and a million other weird glitches I can barely put into words

As long as it's someone who uses Susie I'm fine.

It does look like deleting and reinstalling works. I was able to successfully log in.
---
I had the same reaction about the legion skinüòÖ
---
I'd rather be able to get regularly injured in Feral like I just want them to remove Deep Wounds as a status effect it's so dumb
---
"Whenever I play killer" So, whenever you play Nea?
---
Meh. Cosmetic shit is cosmetic. At the end of the day there is no best store cosmetic for gameplay (lookin at you P3 claudette) so it honestly doesnt bother me.
---
If it keeps DLC costs down and gives us more free updates I say go for it BHVR, hook a whale and reel em in for us ;)
---
Almost a month later and it still doesn't work. It's also madness that the killer gets to 'catch' you as you vault the locker.
---
Damn they removed the leave game button.  Guess I have to get off of my ass to disconnect my ethernet cable. Damn it!
---
The two pallets outside of the basement, and the two pallets above the bathroom / basement are all safe pallets, guaranteed to spawn. You're more or less guaranteed to get 1-2 pallets that spawn above a stairway that are extremely safe.
---
Pretty typical to get a pallet behind a stairway on the bottom floor, 100% safe.
---
The pallet downstairs below the boiler area is 100% safe.
---
Multiple other pallet spawns are safe as well. If you have balanced landing you can also count the pallets *on* the stairs as safe pallets.
---
The Game is one of the most survivor sided maps, after Hadnofun and Coldwind.
---
On top of using Coulrophobia and Thanatophobia to literally make them not want to heal at all.
---
Even if you play for fun yourself, you have to be really selfish if you have No Issues Ruining the game for 3-4 other players just because it is not a Killer you like
---
Deep Wounds does kinda counter adrenaline since adrenaline only removes the counter, still leaving the surv vulnerable
---
don't think the game or the devs watch his youtube videos or care really I think they only saw him doing the bug in there logs so they just simply banned him. I think what he should have done is post a ticket with the video attached to it as a proof of the bug to avoid the ban. but it is 24h lol nothing big
---
I dont care. Nurse is super unfunny to play against. There's 0 % chance of escape if it's a good nurse. What's the point?
---
OwO
---
Huntress Lullaby is an extremely fun perk to run in my opinion (if you are having a good game)
---
Makes me think of a 30s mob boss.
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about, I have zero interest in continuing when that happens.
---
Ormond is an infinite against huntress, especially with balanced landing. You can run up the stairs (which have a guardrail that huntress can't throw through), jump down to get balanced landing, run around a wall, and repeat.
---
Not enough to fault him for.
---
Is it actually less efficient to tap gens??! Aaaaah. I can't hit any of the skillchecks so assumed it was better to do the on-off strategy rather than look for the totem.
---
Case in point. I have no idea why this guy is getting downvoted.
---
He is the killer, his playstyle is probably killing you (unless this is a very bizarre case of him letting survivors live). If he finds a way to kill you he isnt doing anything wrong. but... you disagree. Why not tell him? Why downvote?  He is making absolute sense! "How about YOU adapt to me, I‚Äôm the killer, boi." Yes! people dont play chess and go: "No no no that checkmate move is too powerful, please refrain from killing my queen you cheater. DOWNVOTE". 
---
Explain why he is wrong! dont just downvote. u are helping noone.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That said, you are being a little naive dorfoolio. Your goal as killer is not to just kill them. Thats why the entity doesnt let you instantly murder people you catch in the dying state (and also why your character doesnt run and instead does a creepy power-walk). Your goal as the killer is to make the survivors 'suffer' by hooking them, chasing them, injuring them, and after hooking and humiliating them multiple times, kill them off (by letting the entity kill them on the hook). So you probably shouldnt camp on the hook, as the remaining 3 are not suffering. they are chilling while u fap near the hooked target. Let them free each other and rehook them! Assert your dominance!
---
You can see that my point of view is correct from how the point system works. Gatekeeper emblem is gained from chasing and keeping the survivors busy for as long as possible/away from the generators. Devotion for HOOKING the survivors for AS MANY TIMES as possible (note: not killing. killing gets u a relatively low score). Malicious for injuring them, and smacking them. (This comes naturally if you hit, down, and hook them multiple times. so dont think much about this one) and finally Chaser: For smacking them smartly when you see them and not getting juked or looped like Tom in Tom &amp; Jerry (note, killing has NO effect on this medal).
---
Hope I did not come off as condescending. You might not even have proposed a camping playstyle, I kind of guessed. But I did it mostly to display my 'method' as a part 2 to my first comment in this thread. Sorry if I did offend you.
---
I lost a lot of respect for both him and BHVR as a result.
---
Dood that's momos face.  That face kept me up at night the first time I saw it lol.
---
you have to be really close to them till it gives you the "kill" prompt
---
WOAH!
---
Holy shit lightborn takes forever to blind you. I never knew how effective that perk was until this video.
---
It‚Äôs just as bad on pc, very annoying lol
---
I like the Black Hare and the Heavy Fur Coat. Gotta maintain that Bioshock vibe.
---
Yeah, it's shitty. I usually manage to avoid getting hooked in the basement and not DC, but I'm not gonna give the killer a reward for Insidious Camping the basement. If your ass is sat there doing fuck all but watching me while my team is getting gens done, fine, waste your time. Some idiot comes for me and fucks everything up even though it's obvious the killer never left the fucking basement (the failed savior usually circle the killer shack or whatever before coming in) Gone.
---
Soon
---
Then what makes Michael so powerful?
---
If survivors won't heal to full and will stay in injured, thus making them 1 hit away from being downed, what is the difference between Michael and Legion at that point?

You missed the part where he gets a first hit.

AAAaaall the while I'm pretty sure he was bangin' Lady Magdelena after a hard day of smackin' Bankers around.
---
J.C. would be cool with this.
---
This is lightborn 2.
---
At one point later, I decided to pick someone up while they had a teammate w/ flashlight in front of me. They barely made it half way through the blinding process. 
---
If I recall correctly, they had a green flashlight with some add ons. Lightborn is an extremely effective perk for its purpose (compared to perks like No Mither and Lightweight)
---
The issue is the limitations of the console vs the PC, I'm on PS4. They could add in something like eliminating motion blur but even then you're still limited by controller design and such. Most killers are fine, that's why when you see an exceptional one that means they're really good. Although nurse is practically useless on console.
---
Its a joke
---
You can lunge with it and all I can think is that you weren't close enough, it's never happened to me and I've used it a lot.
---
In general it's better to work on gens than spend time looking for the totem. But you shouldnt really be tapping gens. It's faster to power through them and you'll get a lot better at hitting greats, which will benefit you when ruin finally breaks.
---
I don't feel like there were enough DC's here.
---
Likely another idea that has been done a billion times already like that meme I posted the other day, but once again, OC so I tried. :shrug:
---
Clown is by far the most annoying killer imo (not counting legion because well, it‚Äôs legion)
---
Julie gang would like to know your location

WHY AM I GETTING DOWNVOTED?!?!

Seems legit to me

Choose your gorls better next time

Yeah they are pretty dumb.

I figured since they were my friends they wouldnt mind but please don't harass them if you can. I'm the virign filled with rage btw (fun fact I can't spell at all and that was completely unintentional)

I try not to be cynical and spread a positive energy but you can never be too careful on the internet.

Thank you!

---
He's getting downvoted because he recently before this made a post where he posted a video of him proudly facecamping and then bullying and insulting people in the comment section. That's what he's referring to when he says "about how my playstyle is still valid, fun, and effective."
---
Thanatophobia doesn't effect mending
---
If only this were true... My poor ruin dies so quickly
---
No, we're talking about men and mice. Get with the program.
---
Lmao you have no idea what you are talking about
---
Bear Trap:
---
‚Ä¢ Immobilizes and injures Trapped victims. 
---
SUCK IT DOWN!
---
Yeah but there is a line. 5 bucks for one piece is fucking terrible and the game is really far from running great.
---
NOED has its flaws and I do think it needs to be addressed, but if the killer got a 4K as a result of it in the endgame then you guys definitely made several misplays.
---
When does the hiker Meg cosmetic come out? I swear we saw it months ago and I‚Äôve looked in the store.
---
Oh shit sorry.
---
The counter argument for her needing a nerf is the skill needed to play her effectively. Which everyone who doesn't agree with you will use this argument. Which I agree with. I'd say over 75% of the nurses I play are trash. If you've ever played her, you know she isn't easy to play like hillbilly for example.
---
...Fair enough. WAHHHH
---
Get good, game is hilariously survivor favored and literally any coldwind map is a free win against nurse.
---
Trying to P3 Laurie so I‚Äôm spending bps and cakes, already working with hardly any perks and this happens twice in a row with different teammates.
---
"Chainsaw? Gee I wonder where the Billy's going"
---
Ik the game is survivored favored. I was the nurse, I died once to a nurse and it was a amazing one. Just saying a god nurse can make a game gone in 4m
---
But the limitations do NOT justify just how bad things are. I have played many more intensive for the system and they run just fine with more players in a server. DBD on console can be much, much better
---
All these are why Empathy is a good perk
---
I agree, but it doesent change the fact that a good nurse can make the game a 2m game and unfun for anyone
---
Calling people dumb, capitalizing words sporadically in your post hmmm.
---
Rinse best girl. Anna second best gorl.
---
Feng isn't free wut
---
I fully support a nurse nerf once the game is fixed to be less atrociously surv favored.
---
It‚Äôs sad how accurate this picture is
---
Find out in the next cosmetic reveal: will Nea ever get a good hair cosmetic?
---
I'd say what makes Michael mid tier is his ability to have actual stealth (16m at Tier 2) so even though hes just an M1 Killer he has the opportunity to get closer before they dart off. And perks like Nurse's Calling allows you to see their aura before they even hear your radius. Also since they are healthy they cant exactly Dead Hard meanwhile Legion is now for the 1st time vulnerable to Dead Hard (like every Killer)
---
So you're right. Hes just like Michael... if Michael had 16m TR, couldnt avoid Dead Hard, and didnt have extended Lunges.
---
Or to simplify it: If Michael had no powers
---
Don't know. I can't recall ever dcing against a plague. Shes not even that scary
---
Yea. I'd love some tips and such on her, just got her to lvl 15. 
---
Current perks; Spirit Fury, Haunted Grounds, and Rancor 
---
Any suggestions? I have no non-iridecent shard killers (only ones I don't have are Clown and Plauge.) so no Liscenced killer perks are avilable really.
---
Those are literally just cosmetics... You can play the game without them... You aren‚Äôt being forced to buy them...
---
That Adam cosmetic is looking pretty sweet üëÄ
---
I played with not_Queen once it was pretty quirky
---
Ants are not a good snack for a healthy meal
---
What? I accidentally posted 3 times and then removed the extras, if that's what you are refering to.
---
Oh really? Well disregard what I said then haha.
---
I really disagree, why huntress so high tho?
---
I‚Äôm doubtful they ever will as it‚Äôs seen as a strategy to them. 
---
What makes me laugh though is this new End Game feature seems to be pandering to those who play Killer and can‚Äôt seem to take being tea bagged in the exit gates and so wanted a way to force survivors out without having to look at them so their feelings didn‚Äôt get hurt. 
---
Yet the devs just released info on the new cosmetics and how they even have it in their heads that anyone should have to pay around $10 for an outfit for a survivor just so they can be camped and sit on the hook for 2 minutes doing nothing and not being able to participate in the rest of the game is beyond me.
---
That wasn't it, the fact he could frenzy with an incomplete power bar was what let him be right there. But it was fair because normal attacks depleted the bar.
---
Yeah I can agree with that. The prices are a bit too high for my liking and the in game currency is earned purely off of time played and they want a lot of your time played in order to get some pieces.
---
What are you talking about?
---
What are you gonna do to keep your YouTube videos from me
---
They nerfed her base across the board. They only buffed some of her addons. A better base killer is always preferred over a killer who is only dangerous with addons.
---
Cept he's not even close. Hes just a toxic wannabe.
---
Have bad internet If you want, I get it, not everyone can afford good wifi. but If you use a lag switch you are totally pathetic in my eyes
---
Oh those cancerous things? Not much
---
Cancerous tissue and tissue are also used in a variety known as the fuck that you have discordance
---
Honestly, people who dc on purpose are pussys
---
well, you should've left instead of trying to taunt the killer
---
lol bro. I play doc frequently and cold wind farm doesnt effect me at all. Ive never been 360ed or lost someone just because of the corn. You must be blind af
---
I think a lot of people--myself included at the time--took it as an insult because it seemed insensitive. He seemingly refused to even acknowledge the idea that "Hey, maybe this game *does* have balance issues." It actually felt like he was ignoring the grievances of an entire sub-community and discouraging us from playing. 
---
While I agree with what you said and I do understand *why* he said it given context, that isn't what fans of this game or competitive gamers want to hear. So it pissed a lot of people off.
---
Oh they're creative when it comes to this kind of "reworking" of a killer. I'm sure they can think of something. And it'llbe swift too, within months. They only take years to "rework" a killer when they want to buff him.
---
Trust me, if people began to DC against her too much they'll punish the killer before they'll punish the DCers.
---
LMAO i've been doing this series with the skins i like running on my survivors (with the exception of Claudette, i'm going to re-draw that one) and it IS always the pink-haired Neas ;)
---
thanks so much ;o;
---
Sure, as swf with comms. With randos it's hard to get 4 to escape if you're against a good killer
---
If you hit good skill checks with ruin, take a second or two to stop working on the gen until the fizzles go away, then start working again. When the gen regresses with ruin, the meter stops going up for a couple seconds, but you can still get more skill checks that can regress you further.
---
The only time you‚Äôd wanna tap a gen is *once,* when you want a kicked generator to stop regressing but need to run or something. Otherwise you‚Äôre only hurting yourself by not practicing skill checks!
---
If you have never been 360 then you wouldn't know the pain of it. I would go for a hit, they would 360 and then I'd turn to hit them and they would vanish.
---
Jesus, I remember being 12 and edgy too...
---
If you want killers to stop camping then punish them for camping. Grab the gens and totems while killer wastes his time.
---
The main reason killers camp is to take advantage of overzealous rescuers making themselves into easy prey.
---
You said 90% of the time it was an easy nurse. If your only loosing to a nurse 10% of the time then that‚Äôs not a big problem
---
I was trying to distract them from the injured survivor who was running for the gates.
---
Thanks for the gold!
---
Yes and you are allowed to disagree with him. But wouldnt it be better to explain why his actions are bad instead? Can you genuinely make out anything incorrect in anything he said in this specific comment?
---
"Seriously, I made a post yesterday about how my playstyle is still  valid, fun and effective and started a shitstorm because my views are  not ‚Äúthe correct‚Äù way to play. " Here he already concedes in a way. He knows people dont agree with him, so reminding him by downvoting probably wont help.

"Like how tf are you gonna tell someone how to play? You‚Äôre really just telling them to play so it fits your play style." here he is half correct. People do want him to play in a way that they can beat. but he is also incorrect in assuming that people dont want him to play better for himself. We do. If you camp as a killer you get a worse score. So we dont want you to do that for your own good as well.
---
"How about YOU adapt to me, I‚Äôm the killer, boi. " here he is being a little cocky, which is fine imo. But his point is very much valid, although it sounds toxic. He is claiming that he has found a method that works, and telling him to not do it simply because (to him:) it is so effective you want him to stop is ridiculous to him. Problem is of course that the method doesnt really work.

i've been putting off the male survivors bc i'm not very good at drawing masculine faces yet üò© but when i do Quentin i'll for sure tag ya!!

This is so fucking cursed.

Dead hard + lythe + sprint burst
---
Yep I'm stuck in green ranks rn because this happens to me every other game. üòê
---
No lol... oh my
---
i didnt say i've never been 360ed. I say ive never been 360ed just because of the corn. First of all, survivors always try to 360 you when you're really close and its their last hope. Second of all it only works 1/100 on me, and it has to be pretty fucking amazing, third if you get 360ed a lot, you might want to try just smacking them with m1 without lunge since it auto aims

Good point! Thanks for the tips-- gonna try to push through

Well actually, he isn't playing today. He actually won't be playing again, ever.

You don‚Äôt think that players do that? I played this game long enough to run into many camping killers. And many times gens have been rushed and the killer still camps and only gets the one kill. They clearly don‚Äôt seem to care about that as the amount of camping I ran into after the Plague update and more so after the pipping update got worse and worse. Again gens get rushed in most games but it doesn‚Äôt stop them. Some players actually say they enjoy camping so what‚Äôs the point. It still means that one player is not able to play the game fully. 
---
Plus who wants to have to ‚Äúpunish the camper‚Äù? I want a normal game with a bit of everything in,  not just do gens and leave the guy to die who wasn‚Äôt able to play. One of the plethora of reasons I only play a game every other day now.
---
*finger guns*
---
It's not camping if I pretend to just be checking the area before pretending to leave :D
---
They only nerfed one thing, her speed while charging vomit. Everything else was buffed, what are you on about?
---
This is quality meming. Big laugh
---
This post makes me think things about the spirit I didn't want to. I'm gonna need a few minutes alone to go contemplate on it.
---
I'll go for a save if I'm nearby, not across the map, but honestly PS4 attitude is ridiculous - many people end up dying on the first hook or people wait so long that everyone does go after the hook. There was a week people were doing instant saves but it seems to have slowed down again and it can take a lot for some to help you.
---
If I'm seeing people repeatedly downed and hooked across from me, though, there's not much I can do and just do gens. Counters camping, anyway. :( Sometimes you just have to do gens.
---
Deserved as fuck.
---
I thought this was a Fashion Frame from Warframe.

Nahhhh

Anyone else see a young hitler out of him?!?!?

Being a good teammate makes me deserve to get trapped in a locker because of shit code? r/okaybuddyretard
---
The tone of calling it "bitching" and "so quick to burn people at the stake" comes off really passive aggressive, what did you expect. We can't hear tone or anything through text, so language is key. Nobody was bitching, we were just pointing out similar cases that have happened in other games, you jumped in and pointed out something that wasn't on topic, I simply explained why we included it, you immediately called it bitching, witch hunting, and now we're apparently sensitive. Plus with how sensitive you're coming across at this point, with how you immediately got *very* defensive about it, rather than just the usual "oh, alright" or really anything else. Instead you took the original commenters (Which I wasn't even part of, I was simply trying to help clear it up for you) saying other situations where glitch video makers were banned without any warning, with no opinion included, and turned that into bitching, and witch hunting apparently, nobody made any attacks towards the devs, the only mention was the outroar after the Ark dev.
---
SO yes, with all that in mind, fairly easy to assume you were getting worked up about it, by how you were immediately defensive and accusatory. But hey, I'm probably just salty, whining, not using logic, and ignoring your opinion, right?
---
I'd rather have Hoffman as piy because Kramer never really "killed" anyone by his own hand
---
I'd be inclined to actually buy cells if the outfits weren't so expensive
---
Or when the Claudette or Meg come up to your 90% completed gen, blow it up, tea bag you and sprint burst away.
---
BURRGHHHHHHH
---
These cosmetics look real nice. But don't let this distract you that they missed the opportunity for bunny feng for easter.
---
Damn. Beat me to it.
---
He destroys P3 Nurses just like he destroyed &gt;!Curly's wife!&lt;
---
yeah if it was just a shorter rush, that was one hit, that would be great, it would make sense, the edgy "bad kid" teenager would be quite faster, but unable to keep up the momentum, rather than sprinting around like a marathon runner, bleeding people out, with just a regular knife? is it even serrated or anything? I mean you'd still bleed but full on deep wounds, bleed out to death after a while seems a bit much.
---
Haha its all good
---
I'm surprised you can hit an even zero
---
I like playing Plague because she's very fair compared to several other killers. She has vomit to prevent too much looping, and it adds an extra thing to do for survivors that isn't so stupidly unfair like Pig's reverse bear trap. It's an extra thing to do but you don't have to run to 3 or 4 trap removing things and straight up DIE if you fail. At least vomit only breaks you so you have to cleanse yourself or risk going down faster. Only thing I see Plague players having difficulty with is getting anything going at first since she can only make survivors yell at certain ranges. But once she spots someone and starts getting the vomit on, it's a fair and fun game.
---
Likewise i'm always pointing out the great things they did,  especially if i'm in a SWF, and that's usually with friends overseas so i'm at a disadvantage at the best of times with high pings. 
---
I've played a few games of killer, but i get so frustrated with the gen rushing and general run around. You can tell when the killer is newer or if the survivors are just better at running the killer around. 
---
The matching making on PC leaves things to be desired,  yesterday i was playing with a streamer friend, and we got a rank 20 killer. I felt so fucking awful they got run around so much. We were all rank 14 and below. 
---
I said as much and apologised that they got such a shit match.
---
I think hes trolling you but I'm not too sure. Lol
---
Corporate needs you to find the difference between these two pictures
---
They're the exact same picture
---
Who the fuck says "bullerino"...? An ochido fan? Ew.
---
I concur
---
I have to say, the way people often end up treating new killers is terrible. I can tell when a killer isn't managing much but isn't friendly, and then you see all the crouching and taunting from teammates - survivors need to think about their attitude just as much as the more aggressive killers do. 
---
Just know that with time and observation I'm sure you'll improve! Taunting is never nice, though, some just get really overconfident with this game. You can't really blame killer as survivor if you're being outright silly and you get punished, imo.
---
you butchered it
---
I‚Äôll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s one with cheese and a large soda.
---
yeah, smacking that sprint burst the moment you see a killer is skill, and hiding away from your team is the epitome of tournament tier gameplay. Gotta love when people turn this very, very casual game into some intense "skill based" game.
---
It's not at all, it's a party game, with a spooky theme, and a whole lot of rng, that's it.
---
why u bully me
---
They need to make Bond or one of those killer aura reading ability a default feature if someone is being facecamped.
---
Then make sure the camped person don't DC by giving them the point that was taken from the killer for camping.
---
Alternatively, if someone is being camped longer than one stage, they should be rematerialised to another safe area like most game do. Just let them respawn after each hook stage.
---
You're all wrong. Nea is best girl. Spirit second.
---
Imagine thinking the game is hilariously survivor sided in 2019
---
New survivor is a furry confirmed?
---
For real tho we need better console cosmetics for meg
---
Im not bulling you, just dont wath ochido... he is so toxic m and he thinks that its funny to bully 30 hours killers
---
How dare you call Susie a thot!
---
Your line and other peoples line are not the same. Clearly they are making money off of these at the current prices so it isn't the line for a lot more people.
---
your survivor's don't insta dc?
---
S U R P R I S E
---
Yes
---
F for legion
---
I usually play this way, but I'm becoming more of a nice person to the opposite side.
---
I don't slug ti avoid the hatch, I usually give the best player hatch if someone DCs
---
I give killers who tried but didn't succeed a free kill
---
I will NEVER teabag or use a flashlight unless the flashlight is to benefit me or a teamate.
---
I play for fun and take it upon myself to try to make the game more enjoyable for others, even if it isn't my job, what's the point i  being a douche and ruining the community when you can be the one that saves it. As much as people talk about games being like Dead By Daylight, there really are none out there that can compare, Friday The 13th is the closest, and it's hard to play more than 2 games in one sitting, while the gameplay of DBD is addictive enough to play all day. The only thing ruining it is the community, and once that takes over and the community ruins the game, we will have nothing... but it's fun to piss eachother off, right?
---
Ok ur just memeing now
---
Yea thats true, althought instead of working on fucking skins, they should fix bugs
---
Prob end of this week.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs exacerbated by the fact that this is pretty much the only game on the market. ‚ÄúGo play something else?‚Äù There is nothing else. F13 is the walking dead. Last Year is on fire. White Noise 2 ‚Ä¶ exists and doesn‚Äôt look that bad, actually. Secret Neighbor is actually having it‚Äôs Easter Alpha right now. See if you can find a code. They added classes.
---
Oh boy, I‚Äôm afraid someone doesn‚Äôt understand what an infinite is. You would have loved the game back in 2017.
---
I live in venenzuela and i can say they dont need that
---
Game cost 20$ and before 2.0.0 all dlc costed money, and then fucking 10$ for each skin like... really?
---
They‚Äôre working on it with dedicated servers coming soon and it‚Äôs the same on PS4.
---
I love when a teammate comes to a gen I‚Äôm working on, misses a skillcheck, and yeets outta there
---
omg I forgot about that fucking ad lol
---
I love getting forced to play against the same killer every game because of bad players
---
I was hoping for this line during the credits:
---
‚ÄúYou just wait! I‚Äôm about to get a major update and‚Äî[pages rustle] ‚ÄúOh no. OH NO!‚Äù
---
Rip
---
Honestly it looks good but I just wish it was any color but neon pink. If it came in a modest blue or light purple I'd buy it in a heart beat. But no it has to be "tunnel me daddy" pink.
---
This is some high quality shit!
---
Not to give her an excuse but I have mine the same way due to the bit earlier last year where a random message from a random person was causing ps4s to brick.
---
The game is a one time purchase. How do you expect them to keep the game up and to earn for themselves when they new players stop coming? The game would die, even with an active community
---
Yup my normal queue times on PS4 are about 3-5 for solo.
---
I know there are a lot of intentional DCs which suck, but the devs also need to bring back the network tolerance. If you watch your ping during a game and it goes from say 43ms to 85ms on just one ping and then back to 43ms... The game disconnects you... It's so dumb!
---
Soy lattes, avocado toast, and edgy t-shirts from Hot Topic won't buy themselves.
---
I played the game in 2017, but thanks for being condescending for no reason. I'm also aware infinites were allegedly removed, feel free to tell that to every huntress main every time they roll asylum/wretched shop/tempest creek/lery's/etc.
---
The fact that you don't know what's going on with the game doesn't make the game stacked against you. In any case, I'll extend an olive branch and say, I'm sorry BHVR removed some of your infinites so that you actually have to learn how to run tiles now on some maps.
---
I‚Äôm actually fine with the cosmetics being crazy expensive. The dlcs are cheap and only the really crazy cosmetics actually cost money. I use my shards for almost everything cause I‚Äôm satisfied with the lowkey clothes. 
---
Also licensed clothing ofc is going to be expensive, but most games can charge $10+ for a skin so the most expensive being $10 imo I can I live with. 
---
Still waiting on grandma Laurie tho üëÄ
---
Totally agreed, a lot of people want the satisfaction of upsetting the other side, it seems - like I once met a killer who lived for angry messages, and I guess that's just what they do. But really I acknowledge both sides contribute to a game, fellow survivors have ruined games for me by upsetting the killer - do I fault the killer for that? No, it was the BM leading up to it that caused it. 
---
A lot of us play games to relieve stress, and I just think DbD has become too stressful and almost competitive. Survivors are mean and in turn bitter killers become mean to counter it, or vice versa, but it's really not helping anybody - especially those just trying to play the game as intended. I often get bullied, it hasn't made me the bully, at least not yet. 
---
There really is nothing like DbD, it's short and fun and occasionally thrilling, it's much easier to appreciate the good over the bad with it. If enough people tried to just be as good as they can, it would change the community so much, but I guess in a way it's a hopeless plea to the crowd. A lot take games very seriously, after all.
---
Task manager. Or Computer Shutdown.
---
Your arguments are so futile and ignorant to the current state of the game I don‚Äôt feel I need to say anything.
---
This comment was made when the store was first released in which case it was 100% true.  
---
Not only this but older outfits eventually are able to be bought for shards. This is a great way for the devs to make money without pushing out DLCS as fast. Remember during the barrage of new dlcs when everything was broken, the balancing was terrible, and we got no QoL updates? BHVR is a very humanist company and pays all their workers very fairly and especially being not a very big stuido they need a constant flow of money to do that. After the cosmetic store was added we got entirely new animation sets for killers, QoL changes to the base game, and balancing that was very very much needed because DLCs weren't as pressing anymore.  
---
Patch 2.7.0 is literally just an entire QoL update, and is packed with cool stuffs. The end game collapse and Freddy remake would never have happened without the cosmetic store.
---
To be fair all the brown cosmetics are purchasable with Shards, and they probably make up about 80% of the cosmetics. :^)
---
I'm mad at the way it's managed. The way they put things in light, it seems they put more effort in cosmetics than bugs.
---
More people play on console than PC lol
---

---
I can see potential though, his power is to send survivors to his pocket dimension, survivors need to escape from the dimension by doing some sort of minigame or whatever (similar to the Pig's RBT and Boxes), if they don't escape in time they instantly die.
---
"In an ally"
---
Holy fuck it's a real SubReddit.
---
Holy fuck the first picture I saw was a David jerking it.
---
I started to use this perk so the killer focuses on me, but for some reason it‚Äôs almost like they try to avoid you, so now I guess it‚Äôs more of information.
---
A unholy one at that
---
Same here, but is 9pm really late?
---
I actually really enjoy this. Less double pips mean less time spent deranking.
---
I love this!
---
yes they did.
---
looked at their profiles. they were a 3 man :/
---
Even though I wish that could happen, people would already complain he‚Äôs too op. Some people think that pig alone is op so them having to do it to get out of a pocket dimension or they die (pig + Fred) would mean an absolute meltdown from the survivors side
---
Man, there's people dcing vs wraith on their first down these days.
---
That‚Äôs a bug. You are using a bug as reason to suggest infinite‚Äôs still exist on every map, good job.
---
I‚Äôve seen your explanation in the comments I‚Äôve got to say you should have just quick vaulted or left.
---
The only Killers that really annoy me are Hag (because of shitty solo teammates not knowing how to crouch) and Legion.
---
Nah I'm a Hag main. REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
When I‚Äôm Killer in 2 man games, I honestly try to kill them as if it were a 4 man team (even if it‚Äôs 2 man 5 gen). I know it sucks for survivor, but I don‚Äôt like farming very much and would rather just play the next game. 
---
If someone burns BPS though, I‚Äôll farm in that situation since I benefit more from it than before. But even though I‚Äôm a BP whore, I don‚Äôt like being bored and farming can be boring
---
The games been out for a few years, just been made free on PSN plus last year. The purchase rate is dropping and it's hard for devs to continue focusing on bug fixes if they feel there is no money coming into said project. I do agree it's too expensive sometimes but I also don't want this game to die out cause they decided to say fuck it no money in it
---
Wish me luck
---
But killer gets a shit ton more blood points... you cant have it all my dude.
---
Don't get caught
---
Shit fam you right, the fact that there are infinites in the game has no impact at all on the balance because it's a (consistently reproducible, affecting every single game on several maps) bug. BHVR has such a good track record on fixing bugs nice and quick too, in fact I bet infinites will be gone by the time I'm done writing this comment.
---
edit: just checked, they're still in. BHVR didn't get it yet. darn.
---
Dont want to sound rude but survivors who think the Pig is OP probably are rank 15's and such, but I guess other SCPs that could work are 939 and 049 (Plague Doctor, since everyone wants one).
---
She was definitely buffed in general, but her strongest playstyle of running up to survivors with charged vomit and getting a relatively quick down a la instasaw billy got nerfed. Buffed everywhere else and better to play against though, so it‚Äôs hard to argue it wasn‚Äôt a good change
---
Oh my god what is that subreddit it's perfect
---
You can also level your killer/survivors up and get their teachables for just bloodpoints!!
---
Ik that they are rank 15s or lower. Wish they would stop complaining and actually get good at the game. The devs should honestly not listen to them since they literally have 0 idea of what OP means in this game
---
Yeah their matchmaking does leave something to be desired. Plus I'm tired of playing swf and it constantly booting us to solo lobbies. Such a waste of time.
---
Some people can't handle her actual ability, like it may get them genuinely nauseous or uncomfortable. To save themselves the discomfort I know some dc for this reason.
---
Others though, can't explain.
---
That David cosmetic is juicy.
---
I said the same exact thing. Are people this desne that they'll pay more for a cosmetic than they did to buy the actuall character?
---
Bark
---
Killers don‚Äôt care about your feelings.
---
Considering how much he doesn't seem to enjoy the game anymore, I think he'll likely move on to something else.
---
God, David can be the mechanic of my engine...
---
Level 49 wraith hardly seems like 'just starting'
---
TiL that running the killer for a few minutes and doing a gen or two is considered "doing nothing"
---
You can‚Äôt do anything except for accept your fate
---
You know it's not the same team that works on cosmetics and that fixes bugs, right?
---
I know that I personally can't stand Suzie only because out of every Legion killer I go against Suzie usually ends up being the most shitty in my experience. Which sucks cause I do enjoy her aesthetic a lot.
---
Yea it literally 10 min ago and instantly posted it lmao
---
This Sub says that survive with friends is cheating, says that survivors need to have a get win button. They tea bag and hook block then complain that they get camped. Both sides are incredibly toxic but I've seen more survivors than killers.
---
Borrowed Time.
---
Get out of my head!
---
You're not wrong. We've had cosmetics like on a weekly bases and I'm not sure what's so surprising about it.
---
I‚Äôll uninstall. Probably.
---
I've seem killers defend camping calling it The best strategy. I've seen killers complain that Dance with me is a crutch perk. I've seen people complain that Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion is Op
---
Well just be glad to know he also didnt rank up :)
---
I didn't dc because I thought they'd try to unhook me seeing as I tried to unhook one claud.  They only unhooked those in their 3 man. I wonder why those players can't play in a 4man.  
---
Killer called the game fun even tho they hid in basement all game. The 3 clauds called me  bad even tho they allowed me to die 1st hook since it was "my fault for getting caught"
---
I've been told to kill myself because i run sloopy butcher, nurse's calling, iron grasp, and i think whispers. I'm not entirely sure its been a while since i played.
---
Think we‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far
---
He could have just leveled up his killer
---
Look I never said Surviviors weren't toxic. I *AM* saying that killers pretending that they aren't on the other side of that coin are fucking ridiculous
---
It always makes me laugh when killers get mad at being looped. I've gone up against some killers who will shut down a loop within a few seconds, it's all about the mind games.
---
[Tyler, would you kindly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXqiUrjpBbI)
---
Same outfit? Total DC squad lol. Who's dumb enough to even try to connect those? Even with all the customization this game has you're going to run in to people with the same shit on.
---
Oh no I understand completely i was just telling my story because you said crutch perks lol
---
Glad it was resolved peacefully.
---
What the fuck
---
Survivor I think would be best: Dr. Bright

---
More like 1-2mins with small game! But I will at least get 1-2 gens going first unless there is a skill check every 3 seconds. Some games there is hardly any and some games they are horrible on repeat! On PS4 btw so the frame rate isn‚Äôt the greatest at times.
---
Okay, but now they added to the merch and are selling bloody shirtless David body pillows and $60 pairs of socks...
---
Okay mommmmm...
---
this is a mood
---
Update: I tell him to have a good night and he's still messaging me. This guy is persistent af. He's starting to get on my nerves. I'm done playing for the night.
---
No one can stop the pizza dwete apocalapse.
---
Also tapping in 2019? What are we defualt megs?
---
All 4 of those are really good survivor maps.
---
Ik, the only times devs should listen to them is for bugs. Apart from that they shouldn‚Äôt do anything rank 15s and lowers ask when it comes to nerf or buffs
---
So what you're saying is that Nea IS a killer?? I knew it
---
I‚Äôve been putting a decent amount of time as her. I just got her to 49 from my matches I‚Äôve played earlier. I‚Äôve actually made some adjustments to my build since my last post and would gladly share my experience and tactics as her. 
---
I removed Haunted Ground as it was getting busted really quickly and then survivors would go full immersion mode as I‚Äôm approaching the higher ranks. Unfortunately my build does have a few licensed perks.  Have you purchased Barbecue and Chili yet? It‚Äôs currently in the Shrine. If you haven‚Äôt, I would definitely recommend grinding out the shards needed if you don‚Äôt have them. It‚Äôs useful on every killer for the 100% Bloodpoint gain, it can be very powerful for Spirit since you can phase to close the gap between them when their aura is revealed. Predator can be a pretty decent perk for her when using her power to track survivors during chases.  Ruin of course is always an outstanding perk for slowing down the early game. Running Father‚Äôs Glasses with Bloodhound can also be a very powerful combination, though it is of course add on dependent. What perks outside of what you are currently using do you have available on her?
---
Yeah, if only we had the power to smack them. Not too hard, but hard enough.
---
What's a dedicated server lol
---
I mean, I didn't even get to play because it was at the very beginning of the match. The other Nea only DC'ed because she got caught early on from the Leatherface. It's just irritating. Thanks for your kind words, though.
---
I‚Äôm in love w the clown cosmetic shit is creepy af
---
Good point lol
---
Did he just say....that the cosmetic team and the gameplay team are the same?!
---
OoO tends to be for survivors wanting to be chased.
---
It's been mathed out that if you miss 6 skill checks, it is equal to gen tapping. So if you miss 7, then gen tapping is faster. 
---
So the question next is.... Will you even get 7 skill checks? Average is a like 4 per gen. 
---
For me the answer is if I am working on a gen with some one or not. 7 skill checks missed solo? Most likely won't happen and I just work through the gen. 7 skill checks missed when working with another person? Totally possible to happen and I will tap if the other person is working through it.
---
I own Legion and Joey's outfit and even I know something needed to be done about exploiting the chase mechanic and moonwalking. There was no counterplay
---
I don't know &gt;:/ I'm still searching for one through all the cosmetics. (Which I love but still)
---
Damn spirit ruining shit.
---
Reality can often be disappointing, sadly.
---
Personally that's why I just closed the chat window and keep it closed, no point in hoping for the 1 in 10 chance the post-game chat is chill and civil when the other 9 times it's wishing death upon me.
---
And then the new Legion is like the least scariest thing of all. Looks like something from the purge but... not really spooky.
---
Closest I got to 0 was like 10. That's actually extremely rare.
---
I gained respect for him. It's just a game and he knows that. He's not gonna beg you for forgiveness just because you're being salty. Their game is broken, and they're well aware and working on it. The devs may seem like incompetent lazy pricks sometimes, but they've made some crazy progress in two years.
---
There's a ping indicator in the lobby for a reason
---
The content an artist makes is supposed to represent them... separating the two is kinda lime ddefeating the purpose of the cintent in the first place...
---
isn't ghostface essentially legion though? a bunch of murderous teenagers
---
I‚Äôll be the first to tell you, that makes absolutely no fucking sense.
---
Dr. Richthofen, also I‚Äôm assuming you mean Black Ops 3 and not the original
---
Isn‚Äôt billy essentially leatherface

ugg i dont think these people know how disgusting actual artists are... famous artists have been pedos, rapists and still their work is praised .However comparing there disgusting acts is not what ochido is.
---
saying everything you don't like is a troll shows you can't critically think and thereby won't progress, i feel sorry for you.
---
You mean the bar that tells you yellow 99% of the time and then *during* the game drops to extreme red? Helpful.
---
I did this before without the DC part. Had a random in the team though. Invited to basement party and it was a leatherface.
---
Farmed with us and now I play with that killer in swf sometimes.
---
Ahhhh, see, that makes it much more clear lol
---
Me: runs dying light due to the current state of the game.
---
Obsession: dcs because they took a hit.
---
No need to be hostile man
---
I have no idea what you did there
---
Bonus: he brought a mori, killed me with it when I got briefly saved then claimed we were trash survivors because we died to a mori. I'm not one for post-game salt, but this absolute cabbage of a killer pissed me off a bit.
---
it's the only way the devs ban him even on the console
---
Welcome, Dr. Richtofen.
---
Honestly I wish there was more nurse in this series
---
Or those metal knuckle things that say NONS and ENSE on each side, so when I punch them lightly, it leaves a slight imprint on both cheeks. That way others can avoid the drama. Lol
---
I know man, I've been hoarding jigsaw pieces on my Freddy for when I feel ready to deal with survivor bullshit again
---
hmm for me it's not removed
---
If you dont like it dont buy it
---
i had a killer ggez after me and 3 randos d/c and we all complained about how bad his lag was in post game chat and he said we were toxic swf and its not his internet i told him that i got pretty damn good internet and he was the first killer ive had a problem with all night he then went on about how the internet cafe he was at gets 100mbps and that there was no way it was him i even asked how many people were there on their computers and he said around 17
---
Looking like hitler over here
---
Oh not towards you, I mean the lack of dedicated servers. Them adding a ping bar didn't really help except dodging to red bar lobbies when they start before the game.
---
Can you imagine seeing green bars üò©
---
Sorry for the late answer, but they confirmed sometime around early May.
---
Some cases I‚Äôve noticed yeah. Just depends on the map
---
if i remember right they said they were going to fix that lobby boot issues as for op we feel ya i literally derank from red ranks to purple because i dont want to wait a half hour to find a game and even then i get lower ranks in my lobby and its really not fun for me when your a straight line gamer

No i have a couple killers leveled up, I have billy level 22 (I use him cause hes pretty easy), leatherface is level 16 (for obvious reasons), and Myers is 28 (I enjoy playing him but  im not so good).
---
I have a lot of experience as a surv (while still not being so good) and im just trying to be a non toxic killer so i dont tunnel or camp.
---
Maybe it's yours? I see green bars 6/10 games and they're usually under 120. If it's more than 150 I'll leave
---
Oof. The internet cafe had me laughing before I even finished the paragraph. I'm sorry you had to suffer that :(
---
That‚Äôs reasonable
---
That'd get you lower chase bloodpoints, you get emblems do ending chases quickly. If you get low chase emblem despite being fast it usually means you're either using one hit downs (IE Billy) that lower your number of chases, or you chase survivors that have been unhooked and haven't healed to full, also lowering number of chases.
---
It depends on how wide his craps are and how many he can have.
---
I would question it if it wasn't me and my friends playing together. We all experienced it at the exact same time. So it was him lol
---
I mean, could you really, though? In my opinion neither person can do anything so the game has reached a stalemate. No one person is holding it hostage.
---
i average around 45k bp every match with killer and around like 30k with survivor when im running WGLF but ive swaped from killer to survivor atm because killer right now is just not that fun to play its a struggle
---
Yeah, that's 100% sending you to corn
---
I play as billy/Myers/Leatherface (not anymore)
---
And yeah last game I didnt go to the gate and they made me wait 5 minutes... I started playing killer so people dont play vs someone who tunnels/camps and now theyre toxic as fuck lol
---
this man speaks for me
---
Points to the survivor who was smart enough to check around the corner.

It's ridiculous, it encourages both parties to farm each other more. Ignoring gens while harrassing survivors nets you a derank weirdly

Happy cake day mate.
---
Sometimes i consider suicide at the hook when i see them approach even after i gave clear indication im being camped , no point getting another person in the basement with a leatherface . Also you might wanna replace technician with another perk because i think its currently bugged

I just got out of a game where I'd been camped even after 1/2 the team disconnected.

I tried out Leatherface for my first time after reaching him to level 15 and wanted to use him for a daily event. I knew some tricks and abilities to start with from him thanks to experience against him and when I won a match with him, one guy insulted me and said that ‚ÄúLeatherface is a terrible character to use and we have to have a petition to have him removed for how overpowered and overused he is.‚Äù Only for me to reply saying, ‚ÄúUmmm this was my first time using him and I did it for a daily event.‚Äù He just cursed at me and left while another at least complimented I did well with Leatherface.
---
If you think tru3 and noob3 are even close to the level of toxic that ochido is, then you suffer from severe mental illness

That is both dedication and the most irritating thing I can imagine.

I wonder how she found out she was straight after sayng she is not straight
---
I do get that but whenever I see a game becomes free in the store I pretty much assume the purchase rate dropped a lot and they need fresh people
---
Unrelated topic but I absolutely adore the Spirit Fury+ Enduring+ STBL on my Clown. I feel like a fucking machine gun shredding through every single pallet and having quick recovery. I can't live without it
---
ngl, Legion and Clown look fucking fantastic.
---
It's a good thing Legion's getting nerfed hard, now I can play them without feeling shame AND while looking fresh as fuck
---
I can guess what you gunna  make after seeing your flare :)
---
because while it does make sense, it also comes across as insensitive. If someone **wants** to play your game, but it has issues, then just saying "go find another game" kinda stings.
---
I'm assuming that's the context anyway, I don't keep up too closely with this game, the most "constroversy" I remember are the OchIdo toxicity things, and Mathieu got the 110% troll survivor game live on stream.
---
Noted, and I wish I'd done that in hindsight. What's bugged about tech?
---
Bunny Feng PLS I need her
---
Well, let's just say I've lost all hope that they'll ever fix the game. I don't even play anymore, I just continue following it to see how much money a game developer can spend setting a dumpster on fire.
---
You can actually tap gens for near max efficiency. It depends on how you do it though. Hold a gen for 3 gen-ticks then let go, and get right back on.
---
Of course but what do dbd compilations have to do with pedophilia?

Even Small games fucks with me on The Game I can't tell if the ding indicator is upstairs or down

Low population is bad for ranked matchmaking systems. This game has a low population so things like this will continue to occur frequently. It is not a bug which can be fixed nor a mechanic that can be improved. Unless you are suggesting they tear out the ranking system and let anyone match with anyone. That'd be a nice change for once in one of these wannabe esports games.
---
What bloodhunt!?
---
I honestly didn't see the mustache when I looked at him originally.
---
Now it's all I can see. 
---
...Kinda hate you now.
---
4 sprint burst increases the speed at which my dad leaves me
---
Don't talk to me or my new David pillow ever again.

Now you're getting it!
---
This "rework" gives me such mixed feelings. Legion needed changes but not necessarily a nerf.
---
He was seen as a pain in the ass with no counter play but also being mediocre compared to most killers.
---
What made most people upset was probably the word "rework" that completely changed people's expectations of what this is.
---
When I heard rework I thought they were going to  do changes that made legion better at killing but he would be more fun to fight.
---
Now he's really mediocre, not the worst thing ever, just less problematic to balance (which is a good thing.) 
---
So this isn't really a rework to me but a jumping off point to see what they can do too make him better without making him a bitch to deal with.
---
I think instead of calling it a "rework" they should have said "change to make balancing easier." Or better yet if they want to be completely honest they would say
---
 "We fucked up bad when we released him so we are making this change to stop the complaints about him right now so we can have a year before we properly do a rework that makes him a competitive killer, rework."
---
So again he's not terrible. He's just sorta bland and is a free first hit gimmick with a some stall especially if he can hit multiple people in a single feral frenzy.
---

UNLIMITED POWERRRRR
---
You'll be fine mate, no-one actually plays Clown.
---
But if the killer is half decent he'd probably chase someone before that happens. Only toxic survivors intentionally seek chases
---
Give this man an award
---
You don‚Äôt know the survivor ranks beforehand
---
There‚Äôs new skins?
---
Pair the coat with the boar head and the halloween axe
---
sadly you live and die by your perks. Get alot of them and lvl them up. Very good perks to have most of the time is BBQ, sloppy butcher, nurses calling and hex ruin. If a survivor is running real hard then forget about him and look for someone else. If you know youll get looped on a pallet then just break it. Mind game people, predict their movement(double edge sword)
---
I would love this but not as a replacement legion is fine
---
It's slower than just working through it, even if you miss a lot of skill checks. If you can't hit greats you either need to practice them more memorize the totem spots because Gen tapping is the worst option of the 3
---
That's because the clown is the entities favorite üòé

No? It‚Äôs all up to the person decision

The DC-ing has been so bad lately that the game is almost unplayable. I had two games today where all three survivors DC-d. Almost all of the other games I‚Äôve played today had at least one DC.
---
I got Billy chainsawed 15 feet through a window about a week ago and instantaneously left the game. It went like vault, 4-5 steps, and then I get 1 hit and he‚Äôs on the other side of the window. After he finished the game he messages me and says ‚Äútrash survivor rage quit lul‚Äù and I‚Äôve never been so dumbfounded in my life. I really wish I could‚Äôve seen the kill from his POV because it was one of my craziest deaths ever.
---
If only these renders were anything close to the crappy visuals in game.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense
---
Feels good when they compliment you in postgame chat
---
Feels bad when you put killer in 5 gen chase, get downed to NOED and they all leave, saying "we did ALL the gens jesus"
---
Oh no what have I clicked on help me jesus
---
I can't really blame you.
---
I hope your least enjoying your time here have a fantastic day my guy.
---
20 was the initial value on release and it got nerfed down to 40 I'm fairly certain after a few patches at worst.
---
Perphaps not a pedo, but he only friends girls, gets nudes from them, and deletes them from his life, and usually they are underage, also, name me another Youtuber who is anything like OchiDO with their toxicity, the closest I can think of is No0b3, who only puts toxic in his titles and isn't actually toxic, he just survives... OchiDO teabags and shit, he rubs his victories in, and encourages others to do so
---
The problem is the ranking system tries to be fair and balanced in a game that is neither.
---
It was 20 seconds on release and after a few patches it got nerfed straight to 40 seconds, 30 seconds was the original level 2 of the perk when it was 40/30/20 after it got nerfed to 60/50/40, AKA what we got now.
---
Get better as killer lol
---
That isn‚Äôt what he‚Äôs saying. He‚Äôs saying it would be smarter to use it in the higher ranks since lower rank survivors are easier to kill anyways.
---
Yes, the developers have officially stated that camping and such are totally viable ways to play as a Killer.
---
Your opinion on clown I agree with, your opinion on legion I disagree with. He has extra map mobility, can dish out injured like it's nothing and ignores gameplay mechanics at the cost of an extra whipe.
---
So if people just want to chill with friends and play dbd ( which is the only way I play) we should get punished? Ur special if you think that...
---
100% of my killer games: "Oh the killer has Ru- \*thunder noise\* Nevermind"
---
It‚Äôs insane on both sides. I‚Äôve seen more and more killers dc if their totem is broken or if 2 gens finish before their first hook. I‚Äôve taken a break from the game because I either get screwed by teammates pulling the plug or the killer and it‚Äôs killed a lot of the fun for me.
---
Pre mid chapter update:
---
His power can‚Äôt see scratch marks. That‚Äôs HUGE counterplay???
---
Hatch standoff is being removed with its own feature change: killers can't grab survivors mid jump anymore.
---
I could live with that &lt;Lenny Face&gt;
---
Hear hear.
---
Spewing on survivors is such a fun thing to do.
---
And in reverse, when I play as survivors, I don't feel as stressed out as I would if I'm against a pig or Wraith. But like Nurse, a good Plague can easily 4k your team.

Nice strawman. I see you didn't deny that SWFs don't come with 5 built-in perks though.
---
You all know it's true, and you all know the advantage that SWFs have over solo survivors. I don't care if it's with your friends or your pets,... spare me the overemotional retorts. Facts... 5 built in perks plus the four you bring in means SWFs have 9 perks to a solo's 4. SWFs should be nerfed, period. Anyone that denies this is illogical.
---
Ruin is really polarizing the game. Try playing one of the worse killers  that can't apply map pressure without ruin and it is a miserable experience.
---
Omg yes! Last time i saw him was via floppy disk.
---
I've been saying this for ages. It annoys me that a killer can go through a survivors profile, etc. or just dodge players they've played against, or go supersweat mode on a survivor that outplayed them in the past. Either let survivors see the killers profile/name or dont let killers see that of the survivors. 
---
You cant have it for one but not the other BHVR

they were a four stack swf i versed in a previous game, was doing a end game build btw noed is so i get blood warden fast

---
I mean, as diminished as it already is, this would only further break the horror aspect of the game. I assume you mean things similar to Fortnite and Apex? Dances, weird ways to run, etc?   
---
The mori animations sound fine, though I feel that only the original killers could use a few updates, that being Trapper and Wraith mostly. Which wouldn't need to be bought, just updated in a patch.
---
I mean it, you just have to buy the in game currency.
---
Yes, but it is not about being fair to others. It is about being fair to yourself. Not to get too poetic but time is quite valuable. Using it to watch my character slowly die on a hook to buy time for some stranger so that they might win is quite low on my list of priorities. And the Killer's well-being, as you might imagine, is even lower than that.
---
This sports game isn't going well for my team, so I'll just get up and leave. I'm not having fun, so who cares.
---
No offense but that's the most selfish and borderline sociopathic thing I've heard and people like you shouldn't play multiplayer games
---
You forgot to mention that their teammates are going to de-pip as well. It took me far longer than I would have liked to go from rank 8 - 7 as survivor simply because of the god damn DC's. If I get teammates that don't DC, I always either get 0 or +1 pip. I'm fine with that, at least I'm progressing, but one DC and there goes that whole progress
---
Was he doing chest defense or was he aggressive until he caught you?
---
Nope, he was aggro.
---
Gen tap if there are more than 1 on a gen, power through if you're alone, gen tap if you're not confident on the last 5%.

 Very uggo, devs please reconsider.

It‚Äôs cosmetic. It doesn‚Äôt affect the game at all. You‚Äôre stupid and entitled if you‚Äôre genuinely getting mad about cosmetic items not being purchasable with shards.

---
All my friends and I do this once in a while for a good laugh and 9/10 times the killer plays along, good fun üòÇ
---
I have a cypress on my lvl 2 nurse not gonna use it though I suck with nurse

ehh, I'd say it was a pretty genuine apology.
---
Jake looks like a SNACC
---
This is why I try to have Stake Out on about half the time. Seems every killer has Ruin.
---
Okay. Just makin' sure.
---
You think not being able to down a survivor with your power. A FF that lasts longer tm while slowing you down And punishing you for missing while nerfing his small terror radius to larger is ok. I get the no blood no scratches I get the change to the power I get the Nerf to deep wounds but frankly. The one thing I cannot agree with is the no collision while cooling down. Basically window techs for days. If it takes 3 seconds to cool down plus they can walk through you while doing it you pretty much are forced to run bamboozle. I agree legion needed a change but bro we hit him with the shitty stick because survivors couldn't handle it. At least we know if we cry hard enough something goes away. Hopefully all killer mains cry about MoM and also the direct buff borrowed time got from the legion Nerf. Like seriously I get it but the shit was heavy handed and anyone who says otherwise is honestly lying, or dim.
---
No you. Visuals are important part of the game too.

Killers don't need buffs.

The check around the corner and dash was actually comical. Sorry you got camped.

I mean for survivors. A hack that automatically starts disarming traps for you when you get in range even if you sprint so you never walk into one.

I am rank 10 killer atm and sometimes have to play against rank 2 and 4 survivors, it terrible.
---
Seriously. Have you watched that tru3 guys stream its literally omg swf/lag/on coms excuse every game and this is a guy WHO PLAYS ALL DAY EVERY DAY, obviously you have the advantage by a country mile and you still make lame excuses. Watch actual ochido play he will only complain and even then only sometimes if the killer hits him 3feet away. At least he admits his mistakes and even so he is actually really good.
---
Good stuff! That clown is fantastic..
---
ok but at the time of the glitch it was 30 i think
---
I don't even play clown a lot and I need that
---
they didn't escape lol. They should have, but they chose not to. From now on, if they chose not to escape then Im leaving haha
---
To be fair that decline is due to nothing actually new coming to the game. It's been the same stuff since it first came out with end game collapse being the first new "game mode" being introduced. People like variety
---
No, no, no, you see, according to BHVR, this here is Fun and Interactive Gameplay, and if you have a problem with it, you can play something else.
---
It‚Äôs kind of funny now that I look back, what a smart cookie that Ace was.
---
uh, yeah. They do.
---
Legendary tutorial my dude! I'm gonna use this forsure. Its the only way to play killer anymore!
---
Honestly those are some of my favorite moments in the game. Just another person you don't know on the other end of your game doing silly shit to make you laugh and keep you entertained. That's the good stuff.
---
when you close the application on console your character stays there for a while before the realizes you left
---
My only issue is she‚Äôs too fast for a ‚Äúranged‚Äù killer. When she can literally outrun me to a pallet by running sideways and charging her vomit there‚Äôs a problem. That‚Äôs all addon bullshit though and a lot of killer addons are bullshit.
---
I don't remember it verbatum.
---
Probably but dude did you see her reveal trailer? She is so Nea now. Plus D'Vorah *drools*
---
Not abused? Do you know what sprint burst or dead hard is? That's nearly on par with DS in power level and is an innherent advantage against hex perks.
---
Oh man that would be fucking classic. "We did some stuff to Legion but now it's also Scream.
---
okay you got me
---
So I picked up Freddy and I gotta say, he's super fun to use. Putting survivors to sleep when they're in the middle of repairing then letting them "escape" me during the chase is great fun! Thank you so much hahaha
---
Ranking system is still somewhat busted so I don't know how strong of an incentive that is. I like the BP idea. 
---
Interesting - I'm a survivor main and I hate D/Cs. They make it impossible to get to endgame against a good killer.
---
Something should be done though because it still screws up ranking and generally messes up matches for both sides.
---
They got less points from chosing not to escape lol... thats pretty victorious lmao
---
Yassss! I love these videos. They‚Äôre amazing for new players and then when you know the mechanics a new round of hilariousness can be enjoyed.
---
I've definitely turned into someone most survivors hate. I'll put them to sleep, get my free hit and let them wake up. Wait for them to try to heal, then do it again. 
---
It's a vicious cycle.
---
I never work on a gen with somebody else with an active ruin. The time that we don't make progress is too common with somebody else and I end up losing progress even hitting 8/10 great checks.
---
I usually play solo though and might not get screwed if the other guy could actually hit them.
---
You‚Äôre never forced to camp, you just have to because you can‚Äôt beat survivors.
---
Players that breathe the game have a shit ton of shards. Casuals that well, play the game casually and take breaks from the game because so much of this community is toxic don't have alot of shards. But these are good ideas.
---
I beat survivors all the time
---
Yes but it's still a rage quit and doesn't fix shit
---
Their excuse is "we do it down rank" I say give them what they want, just to a degree they dont want to go. 20 to 13 is nothing but facecamping and tunnelers
---
Ruin spawns right in front of survivors when you're killer, and in the impossible to find corner of the makto when you're survivor. Also survivors never hit haunting ground first unless you're one of them.
---
I consider it a surprise that they were not beat to the reveal, and got to show it off themselves.
---
And knowing how things have been, and how this community is, it's truly a rare occasion.
---
What's so wrong with being happy to see new content coming out every other week?
---
Word. Thats rough. You gotta get them reachable perks. You‚Äôre gonna have a hard time without them. 
---
Pretty much just gotta suffer through it. But remember, Rank matters even less to the killers. Right now the pip system is pretty impossible. 
---
Good luck killing all those skin bags. They deserve a hook. :)
---
but at least the killer has the time to put you on the hook
---
Yep, chapters include new characters, and you certainly don't need all of them; killers are each unique and you only need to get those you could see yourself playing (youtube gameplay is good for this) and for perks. Survivors, the only difference is perks.
---
As for noob friendly, I just joined the game a few months ago on xbox, and theres a pretty substantial little bundle of new players you'll have time to learn the game with. Theres a sharp skill ceiling at around rank 10, but ranks don't really matter, meaning you can practice in green/yellow ranks for as long as you need to, ahem, git gud.
---
There is something off with his left eye.
---
That and the game getting progressively more toxic and buggy as time goes on. BHVR really need to step things up, or they're going to be in serious trouble.
---
Assuming I stick to survivors, I'm guessing I still need to buy the SLC survivors to obtain their teachable skills right?
---
What makes you think points for clothes will stop dcing when points for perks and items doesnt? Players that DC care about two things: winning and/ or just having fun. If you aren't winning, and the match isn't fun, and theres no serious consequences, players will continue to DC.
---
If things dont get fixed after they switch to dedicated servers this game will die. 
---
They aren't the best at fixing things even when they try. Ie freddy taking a year to be fixed while they nerf legion into the ground in a couple months in a rework nobody likes. Even the most toxic survivor mains are weeping for him
---
Dr is far from hopeless. There used to be some really strong dr mains back in the day.  I rarely see him anymore.
---
Hot
---
My games as killer generally go.
---
Trial: starts
---
Killer: takes three steps
---
Explosion: KABOOM!
---
Ruin perk: gone
---
let meg live
---
....wait
---
I always wondered why I saw people do this when they missed ruin checks. Thanks for the advice.
---
I mean, cosmetics are an easy source of revenue for the game, I would be happy to buy and have a lot of cool(tho it's not always) cosmetics if that meant more $$ going towards fixing the overall game.
---
or maybe they should fix the damn game, give rewards for ranking up and motivation to play further instead of punishing people for not having fun or motivation to keep ranking?
---
Definitely scared the crap outta me, even more than Myers. Almost no escaping that abominable snowman.
---
Wheeeeeeeen a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie¬†
---
That's a mori.
---
Me: downs Kate in the first minute of the game
---
Two other random survivors: DC
---
It's Tinkerer. Every time a gen completes to 80% his terror radius is reduced to zero. Iirc he also gets a noise notification.
---
What a dumbass survivor lol
---
survivors is so easy now that you can literally fuck around, open both gates and even have enough time to find the hatch so one guy can hop out there.   
---
Survivors are waaaaay to OP now.
---
I used to have tons of fun getting 12 hooks per game... and now I stand in the basement with insidious.
---
I think they are afraid of the backlash if they release anything other than bunny feng. But as a feng main I AM HUNGRY BHVR.
---
Why oh why
---
Yay, guess when I will be tunneled out of every game? Early May! :)
---
It wasn't them pushing out updates fast, the release schedule hasn't really changed, it was was that they didn't put out a lot of ptb periods to try and catch the big things.
---
If you d/c survivors still get the 5000 bp for escaping. Still counts as an escape. I‚Äôve completed an escape daily ritual that way.
---
Customization is like the only thing that's not poorly made in this game. Servers, gameplay, glitches and bugs are all meh. Yes, it does have loads of potential but cosmetics are like the lowest priority in terms of what needs improvement.
---
Wraith is 115%, and yet, he is known for eating pallets all day. Doctor is 115%, yet is only good when you 3-gen on him, because he can't down quickly. Clown is 115%, but can't get more than 2 kills because he is too slow. Leatherface is 115%, but is a killer red ranks love to bully.
---
You overestimate 115%. It makes SOME pallets unsafe, and SOMETIMES nets you a hit while the survivor is running to the next loop. All the high tier 115% killers are the ones that can very quickly down you using their *GOOD* powers along with their base move speed. Mikey's Tier 3, Hillbilly, Plague, and Pig.
---
Legion can't mindgame like the Pig. Legion downs people as fast as a m1-only Leatherface. Legion can't injure survivors without giving them a speed boost (Legions Feral speed is getting reduced, so you won't be able to even overtake them to counteract the speed). Legion can't hide his terror radius and pop out with a one-shot like Mikey. He might not be Freddy (because, wow, that power actually HINDERS him.) But he won't be any better than the Wraith, and is just becoming another boring killer.
---
Here's a prediction on his meta build: Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Hex: Ruin. Just like every other killer.
---

Iridescent Shards update - We are adding a new ‚ÄúPlayer account level‚Äù which will reward you with Iridescent Shards every time you level up.
---
Auric Cells - are the new currency you will be able to purchase from the first party platforms. There are 5 packages of Auric Cells, available in June (500 for 5 USD, 1100 for 10 USD, 2250 for 20 USD, 4025 for 35 USD and 6000 for 50 USD).
---
You know, for how gay this sub acts, I‚Äôm a bit surprised at how much het work there is on that one.
---
The new endgame addition solves them doing this to you after the match is actually over
---
Spirit is the 2nd best, and huntress is 3rd. Billy is just as good as freddy when it comes to chasing a good survivor that knows how to use pallets.
---
Just play the game bruh if I lose I lose.
---
This game is not changing anytime soon. I've been playing for 2 yrs and it's more buggy than when I started.
---
I tried explaining this to the people I face-camped but they seemed much more hurt about it than me and wouldn't listen to reason.
---
What's the clear indication you're being camped? Gotta ask, considering being on a hook leaves you pretty helpless
---
i was a Feng main but switched to Nea simply because of cosmetics lol
---
First part of your comment made me think it was a cool subreddit, tried to click the link *missed*
---
As i missed the link i read the 2nd part of your comment, that was a close one lmao
---
Battlefield V did the same thing : "don't like women in frontline WW2 battles? Don't buy it!"
---
Then everyone clapped
---
 him flailing his arms on the hook is pretty much giving the signal that he is being camped .
---
the devs aren't going to, when have they ever in the past? you don't even get told why you were banned.
---
again, the other youtuber would not have been unbanned if not for the huge community uproar for him to be unbanned
---
My only counter to that, is the person who is hooked and face camped stops gaining any points for themselves. While technically winning as the survivors is a team effort you gain nothing by being on a hook and face camped. I get frustrated when I am camped on the hook early on because I get to spend several minutes doing effectively nothing and earning no points while watching other people play. It happens, and I usually just try and get my team to do other stuff and let me be, but it is super frustrating when it happens a lot. Otherwise play how you are gonna play man, end of the day it is still just a game.
---
Huh. I‚Äôve gone up against hillbilly and he hasn‚Äôt had the perk. I‚Äôve also noticed chainsaw sounds randomly cut in out. My headset is fine so it‚Äôs not that.
---
green ping btw
---
Got to be late April Fools joke...
---
Read and pointy things at the bottom center?
---
I feel blessed that I don't notice anything wrong with the game that ruins my experience in the way it does for you
---
Between 1.0 and 2.0 we got 8 new chapters. It is now update 2.7 and we are expected to get 1 more chapter before 3.0 and we've gotten 4 chapters since.
---
So yes the release schedule has changed. Updates might be getting put out faster or in the same timeframe, and like you said the PTB greatly helps with that, but we've definitely gotten QoL updates over DLC comparatively to before the cosmetic shop was added.
---
Well this brings sad memories.
---
I think the idea is to prevent cancer builds to get achievements.
---
Trust me if i run instadown 3 hatchets with ebony and the mainstream killer perks no one is getting out. Yet if i do that i will not get the achievement.
---
I feel your pain, but I mean there is nothing we can do right now but wait
---
Hnnng emeralds
---
yeah sorry about that i was worried if i used my comp to post it i wouldn't be able to alt tab fast enough
---
So jump in
---
Yiiiiikes. This was addressed completely though? Not still a problem I hope?
---
I was just gonna give salt anyway, telling her, "so you're the p3 immersed Claudette the dbd community is talking about!"
---
Today i obtained my first Ebony Mori, in the bloodweb of Legion.
---
Now I have my own VIP spot in Hell.
---
Just do gens
---
I've flailed before as a, "no one's coming to save me" flail though. I don't think people make that association lol
---
Move skill check off space bar to mouse 4 or something and you‚Äôll improve your great skill checks a lot and can push power through ruin.
---
When killers get fed up with it, who will be left to chase the survivors? Killers leave, game dies. Can't really cater to the majority in an asymmetrical multiplayer game. There needs to be balance. One survivor accounts for 12.5% of each game while the killer accounts for 50%. How do they not realize this?
---
I mean you could improve at the game, not just camp. Your gonna remain shit if you camp
---
So you ragequit a match not exactly a rare occurance right now lol, get over yourself dude you got outplayed and got pissy
---
Btw to the degenerates who "want fixes": if you really want to make the ART TEAM to do bugfixes or balance-changes then go for it, but I'd rather not break the game more.
---
Honestly I don't mind it since it's just the cosmetics and the licensed killers which make sense.
---
I've never seen a survivor get 30k bloodpoints outside of farming, so I'm gonna need to see some VOD's
---
He means common games on that rank
---
I face killers who are higher at rank than me
---
I tested it and gen tapping only makes a gen 20% slower, if you're not good at hitting great skill checks it's often better than running around hoping to find a totem
---
I swear its mostly those eyebrows. Eyebrows can really change a face.
---
you will be suffer
---
DBD isn't a horror game, it's a party-game with an edgy aesthetic.
---
Probably gonna use hillbilly and instasaw with whispers.... Possibly use make your choice
---
I repeat it‚Äôs up to the person
---
Tapping the gen only makes it 20% slower if you're tapping well; if you can't hit great skill checks for whatever reason it's not that bad
---
Hisako from Killer Instinct, anyone?
---
Ok... Jump in then
---
Agreed. It's always sooooo nice tl watch streams and then see a wild "N****rJewSlitter" join the lobby. Would be a neat feature to just not see that lmao
---
I've done that. There's no reason in getting another innocent soul face camped.
---
No, I meant that survivors act really stupid around the hag and forget that she does not have a hillbilly radius so if you are camping as the hag then you do not know how to use the killer to their greatest potential.
---
Switch to Spirit, and save my Wraith daily for the next game.
---
they don unterstand that different teams are for different jobs
---
What is the definition of toxicity?
---
Well I have good news. I am working on it. I just need 3 more: Freddy, Pig and Clown.
---
I‚Äôve asked people in the same match as me when it happens and they don‚Äôt notice it which I find odd or they‚Äôre trying to make me think I‚Äôm crazy. Jokes on them.
---
It's more of a point funnel and a way to get past exclusives than a necessity.
---
Then the items tend to loose their exclusivity don't they?
---
Does anyone know why he deleted his channel ?
---
So it‚Äôs just a dumb mistake he asked underage girls to send nudes and if they didn‚Äôt he would harass them üò¥ if he did that to my daughter there would be hell to pay.
---
you still have a free first hit AND 115 movement speed to work with
---
stop complaining
---
that one's the most right of them all, but still, you won't learn how to land skillchecks if you do
---
1. it's faster if you sit on the gen even if you mess every skillcheck up
---
2. you'll never learn how to land those if you just avoid them
---
First letters
---
I did. Reddit's a bit fucky. I can see them all have their own lines
---
No, we‚Äôve all thought these things about the Spirit. And we all wanted to.
---
I'm glad something is finally being done about the stupid hatch standoffs
---
I'm still amazed that Mathieu Cote has a job. The guys got to be one of the dumbest chode PR managers in game studio history. His attitude that day forced me to conclude that the reason real issues are not being solved at Behavior is because this is the kind of jackass that represents their company culture.
---
Not a licenced killer but: Ochido
---
"I won't do what everyone does. Devs, remove it instead!"
---
LMFAO SAME!! ü§£ü§£üíÄ
---
I laughed so hard at this post!
---
Id focus on levelling Nurse first with bloodpoints. Nurse's Calling is one of the best perks. Thanophobia (sp?) Is also pretty good. Level Hag for Ruin. 
---
For Billy, I don't use him as much. But his chainsaw is good for fast travel around the map.
---
Myers is good for tiering up. Focus on tiering up to 2. Stay far back away from gens so you can stalk without radius. Get Doctors Monitor and Abuse for Myers for better results. When you hit survivors, switch to stalking quickly to get some tier juice. In darker levels and you suspect someone,'s around but don't see anyone, use stalk to find invisible claudettes in corners, etc.
---
When in chases pay attention to your surroundings. Listen for gens being worked on. Sometimes its better to switch from chase to hit survivor on gen and down that one. 
---
When downing someone, pay attention for footsteps as your about to pick them up. Can be a sign of an incoming flashlight. Chase and hit survivor away if so.
---
Don't be afraid to use add-ons.
---
 The Console limitations argument becomes near invalid when you remember red dead 2 exists
---
What website did you use to make this? (Or did you do it manually?)
---
Built in shadowborn
---
And tomorrow never came..
---
Do you look away from the light or you let them get the full blind?
---
I stare directly into the light for the full effect
---
The "exposed" status effect makes the survivor a 1-hit down! :) So NOED makes every survivor "exposed" once all of the gens are done!
---
Then give him the kill, anyone who plays head-to-toe brown clothes Claudette doesn't deserve a hatch.
---
Lisa from Silent Hills, but Spirit sorta negated that slim prospect.
---
If you are downing survivors right after them being unhooked and feel bad instantly rehooking, leave them slugged and chase other survivor. Down that survivor then hook. Go back to slugged survivor area and look to see if you can find any survivors trying to heal.
---
Also if you see a survivor coming to unhook, hit them a bit back from the hook and as they take the survivor down you should be ready for second hit. When I started I would wait to try for a grab, but I find it's more effective this way.
---
its the exposed effect that means that you are one hit. just played against one last round looped the killer the entire game until he got noed then everyone died because we tried to safe each other.
---
Most people would rather complain than sacrifice their "meta" perks
---
The F13 game got hit by copyright / legality issues so yeah of course he won‚Äôt be available but one can hope. I‚Äôd be more interested in original ideas than already existing characters.
---
Autoaim is only for close attacks (not lunges)
---
If huntress had autoaim for hatchet throws melee hatchets would be much easier
---
Been there, been there. Obligatory ‚Äúdoin gens, u?‚Äù
---
OP, I dare you to sit down and put the Hag's head on every single of them. And then for fun, put Nea's head on one of them, and we can try to find it.
---
Dunno about you guys, but I'm moreso waiting for shirtless Clown.
---
Ah, I see! Does exposed mean the killer can see exactly where you are?
---
I see Pig I upvote
---
Wow, so it really is annoying! I'm sorry to hear that
---
The key is to make them obtainable, but not easy to get.
---
You must be knew then if you don't think devs have been fixing problems for the past year.this game used to be ten times worse
---
Ok
---
one day youll experience it little one
---
A man/woman of class and etiquette.
---
Generally the more stressful builds that make survivors have to work, things like the big terror radius/difficult skill check doctor build.
---
The cosmetic reveal was the surprise.
---
I hope not haha. But I'm sure I willüíî
---
thats weird, the cunts usually find my RUIN withing the first 60 seconds of the match. I swear I get the sweatiest try hard survivors every match. They clearly have studied where all the Ruin spawns are... how annoying.
---
I suppose it was true when the store released. It's a real shame that almost everything that releases now is AC only.
---
I legit want this to be added so i can see how many killers get surprised when they see they got like a 100% bonus and go like "Wait what? 4 of them were SWF? I just destroyed them with little effort". Not every swf team will play like Marth's depip squad or do the mentioned shit above.
---
And everything releases at the max price too :)
---
Nope! I thought it meant that when I first started playing too. It just means you're a one-hit down. Idk why they call it exposed when that's the case tho ü§î
---
SCP –°–û–°–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–ê–¢–¨!
---
Not a horror movie, but jacket from hotline Miami, I know legion is sorta like him but I just like the idea of this maniac going to town on survivors.
---
Oh yea because you use your chainsaw around loops ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Please be a troll please
---
Only faster if you only mess up 6 checks. If you mess up 7, then gen tapping is faster. 
---
If you are working with other people on a gen, it's generally better for once person to work through it and every one else to tap.
---
It's more like "This is what's wrong with idiots" because there is no way at all that they should have downed 3 other people when they were camping. At most they should have gotten 1 more person from the surprise of Insidious. Escaping against an end game camper is easy.
---
Obviously billy is top tier only because he can go from point a to point B almost instantly, and can instadown unaware survivors, but that‚Äôs it. When it comes to looping there‚Äôs not much he could do.

"What's a pallet ... Hmm ?" - Nurse mains in a nutshell.
---
you'll still never learn how to land them if you avoid them
---
it's not that hard ya know
---
20 to 13 is an easy climb, to a degree it shocked me as a new player and has me worried ill suddenly hit a brick wall where all somewhat decent players are and i with my pathetic single unlocked teachable wont be able to compete. This is literally the worst idea in the entire thread. The only one that gets punished by this are the new and casual player. Your first mistake with this train of thought is already to assume they even want a somewhat remotely fair game, and wont be absolutely overjoyed by getting to go seal clubbing.
---
Why do you even play this game? Every post of yours is the same... complaining about it. Get a grip.
---
Also I guarantee you no amount of points would have made them happier than having you DC so well done, you played yourself.

---
im being accused of bug abuse with the legion, so recently i was wondering if the rusty and filthy blade effects stack, i put them together and they do stack, and it's quite powerful, but for some reason after every match the survivors get salty and they say "you're gonna get banned for exploiting the bug" and things like that, can someone clarify for me please, i hope i get an explanation from the reddit community, cuz im not exploiting anything or even intend to but i keep getting accused of it after every match.
---
Ohhh wow, just watched it, I usually play survivor, but this looks good, will stop people hanging around which is what was needed for a long time!
---
I don't remember the last cosmetic to come out that was actually purchasable with shards.
---
It really does count
---
Yeah they need to fix that as much as their hitboxes but thank God the killer can't see me haha
---
Is instantly even a thing? I thought the most it can be reduced to is around 1s, plenty of time to look up (or down).
---
The only time you cannot defend against blinding is while breaking a palette (where it doesn't matter) or picking up a survivor, where you can check if other survivors are around first or face a wall/tree if posible.
---
I used 2 bloody party streamers yesterday every time i got somehow kicked out of the match and it ate up my offering
---
I don't believe it's broken as well. I find it fair, since most of the time the people I play with wait to open the gate when everyone is ready to leave. But from now on I will make sure we get all totems before end game haha just in case
---
Can we add Bronies to that Death Penalty list too?
---
Thank you! I'll check it out
---
They actually want to, but they need dedicated servers in place to tell if the issue is killer or survivor side.  Right now, all they know is that SOMETHING caused survivor 1-4 to DC from the killer.  While they know it is likely just salt from the survivor, or killer, they don't know who caused it, or if it was an issue outside of either's control.
---
With the infinite load screen bug also added into this, it's pretty much stupidly hard to punish people properly without catching just as many if not more people who did nothing wrong other than play the game with someone having shitty internet or worse yet just a long distance connection between killer/survivor.
---
Next patch we are actually getting a "fix" for the infinite load screen bug, at least in a way.  Any game that starts with less than all players will instantly refund all items/offerings used, and just kick everyone back out.
---
I have had about 20 games of clown since Sunday night and not had 1 DC unless it was after first hit.
---
And what does that say to you?

Wow, just today. Looped killer for 3 gens, went down, got tunneled off hook, 1 gen, lost my dstrike because of time, went back on hook, then got tunneled off hook and purposely let them catch me, dstrike, adrenaline procs, still get tunneled, NOED.
---
Can you guys do the gens I‚Äôve been looping this *Killer* for 5 minutes
---
For some reason I found my case to be the opposite of yours. I've been playing this on PS4 since it came out &amp; in January got myself a nice gaming PC. Played enough to get all the base survivors up to level 50, but have since gone back to playing almost exclusively on PS4 (except for when a ptb is out) On PC the frame rate is better, so are the graphics &amp; the lobby wait times. I don't know why but I prefer to play it on the PS. Maybe because I still used my controller on the PC. I'd never gamed on a pc in my life before &amp; using a keyboard &amp; mouse felt so alien &amp; I found it impossible.
---
I agree with you, I quit this game cause the gens got done WAY too quickly and the game only really boosts the TOP SKILLED PLAYERS in this community, this game doesn't about new players and I guess that's the "charm" of it?
---
I also quit this game cause the killers are a HUGE joke to the survivors and not really all that terrifying.
---
oh and also the toxicity, as you can see by these comments you are being given by survivor mains..
---
Yeah, it's just sad. No love for ma girl in like -months-. At least it feels like.
---
NOED is strong but not broken. It's a clutch perk because it only activates after all gens are done but before that happens it's possible to completely stop this perk by breaking all 5 dull totems and you are basically 1 perk short until end game starts with the possibility of not even getting it if all totems are broken
---
Of mice and men chapter next
---
I'm just gonna say it:
---
Screw what people call DBD "etiquette"
---
Ha
---
He's English
---
You have to put an empty line in between them to get it to work.
---
I feel as if that might be a waste of a perk. I try and run speed burst, spine chill, adrenaline (urban evasion once unlocked), and quick and quiet (vigil when unlocked). Is that a good build?
---
Oh boi, that corn fields flashbacks
---
Was this on ps4? Or is this just common
---
That's what I thought too
---
I remember doing the same when her daily challenge was to get a kill with reverse bear trap
---
I have the feeling they didn't noticed that they're set to be featured and no one's talking about it so they don't do anything with it.

At this point I‚Äôm just waiting for Freddy fazbear to become a killer.
---
Because the question was about the bad state of game balance and matthiew's answer, gave an impression that he didn't want to admit those problems.
---
I mean seriously if you're trying to market anything, you should never say "don't buy our product/use our product". Just goes completely against what your job is. 
---
I'm sure he didn't mean to offend anyone and was just trying to give a harmless tip as a human to a human, when he should have answered as a game dev to a consumer.

The reasons people are and were frustrated is with the way the game is being designed and criticisms of bugs and priorities being blithely ignored. Pretending the issue rests with angry gamers is at best a petty deflection and at worst a red herring.

TLDR; Hi, I'm Captain Rhetoric. Play the game and don't complain.
---
I play pretty stealthy too, and I‚Äôve noticed more often than not that if I don‚Äôt get spotted once during a match I‚Äôll safety pip, but if I‚Äôm found / sacrificied (I cant loop for shit) I‚Äôll end up pipping due to the chase points
---
By the way, was that an official website? I thought store.deadbydaylight was the official one.
---
This has no bearing on my point whatsoever..? I never denied toxic survivors existing. You're basically saying survivors will try to loop the killer and fail and disconnect. Great, that will happen more at higher ranks. A brand new killer is more likely to play toxicly than a brand new survivor. It takes 0 skill for a killer to play toxic. A survivor has to believe that he will be skilled enough to loop the killer for a while if that is happening. Fuck people who d/c nonetheless.
---
I also love how people act like teabagging is a personal attack on you xD. it is the only thing they can do to communicate - ofcourse it is going to happen. This new generation of 'teabagging offends me pls stop' is fucking hilarious.
---
Fcking same, I felt that. They suck and blame it on survivors FOR DOING THEIR OBJECTIVE.
---
Oh god you cant comprehend how much i need Pennywise from it in this game. Sadly we already have clown but i can dream. I inagine his power either being the one we have been asking for for forever ( disguising as a survivor) or have some sort of Shape-esque "Fear meter" that he fuels by turning into diferent thing and he gets more powerfull. Oh and one idea( thats broken af but i like it) he could turn into all the other killers. Can you imagine ?
---
I tried that and my game closed ?!?!? What do ?

How many bitching posts are you going to make?

From my understanding, it wasn't "Game has women, therefore it's bad", but rather "People shouldn't be running around with katanas, spiked cricket bats, and all that, not to mention how diverse the squad is, like the woman with a prosthetic arm on the cover of the game."
---
Seeing people run around with katanas is not why anyone I know plays the Battlefield franchise; it's just too arcadey for the series. Also, while there were squads of women running around, the odds of finding a white guy in Woad paint in the same squad as a gal and a black dude seems kinda slim (I'm no historian though).
---
Then it was a factor of how the game was handled. "Don't like it, don't buy it," followed by "People don't like the wackier cosmetics, so we'll take them out and then put them back in later" don't speak well to how the game was being received.
---
Have you considered dying?
---
No one said teabagging offended them.
---
Ah, disarming. Sorry
---
Idk maybe because it sells and people want it?
---
If you don't like it, nobody is making you buy it.
---
Claudette is trying to find a butterfly or firefly, we can't blame her for her a.d.d. lmao
---
o   o   ooOOooooh
---
Anything but the gen it had 4 seconds left on it üò¢
---
Oof
---
I meant in this thread. Lol
---
I see you haven't faced BattleGuy
---
Did I argue with that?
---
I only said that killers only tell you to "stop looping" when survs tell killers to "stop tunneling, camping, proxy camping, defending generators, camping hatch, checking lockers, chasing them, playing around dead hard, using noed/bbq" and all the fucking rest.
---
That's interesting to say the least
---
From what I have heard, some of his addons are broken, and some people say he's super annoying.
---
Agreed. Exposed should be renamed vulnerable or something honestly.
---
I've never gotten a 1000 ping lobby but when I do, O Satan, I'll play it. Just because it'll be hilarious.
---
You can swap thrill of the hunt for myc for save game, and ruin for pop goses the wisel, coz ruin is gambling perk, if you wanna be amazing killer you have to rely on your skill not luck.
---
&gt;Her biggest problem is that IF the survivor's are optimal with gens and don't cleanse themselves, she is a 115 killer with no power against a team of no-mithers.
---
I mean that is a big advantage for the killer though. If survivors don't cleanse then they are playing against perma T3 Myers basically but better since the survivors are injured (bleeding etc.).
---
Entity do what the Entity do. Not like you wanted a Faint Reagent anyway, right?
---
Exactly! That bamboozle always gets me!
---
My queues last up to 30 minutes max. It's so damn bad.

Accurate. Leatherface is braindead, so are the people that play him.
---
Ok thanks alot! any tips for playing him?
---
Uuh, Adam's nice!

---
You can √úbercharge the Nea on your team
---
They had to do something, but hatchkicking is NOT the correct decision
---
I know.. what kinda sick fuck uses mist offerings
---
I have to admit, I am one of those bad, frequently DC:ing teammates. Everytime I get downed I feel like DC:ing. Doesn't matter if it's endgame and exit gates open, first time getting hooked. I might DC, and I fucking hate it.
---
I don't wanna DC but it's almost like a reflex nowadays. My intent is not to ruin my teammates' or the killer's match but I don't have time to even think about it before I've already pressed leave match. I feel really shitty afterwards.
---
Ever since the new ranking system I've felt like rank doesn't matter shit anymore and the -2 pip penalty is pretty much nothing. It feels like there's nothing to grind anymore either since If I don't get 2 iridescent plus a few golds in the purple ranks, I won't pip. Grinding for rank is useless and grinding Bp for prestige is unfun and very slow. It gets boring.
---
Usually I just loop the killer or do gens. Killers rarely give up on chases so I'll go down eventually and evader is already lost. I may be doing gens but that's only one  emblem. I won't get enough medals for a pip so there's that.
---
I feel like there should be a better reward for escaping (or not DCing in general) to motivate players not to DC. I hate being a DC:er but I can't help it.
---
High Mid-Tier      
---
Her projectile can go surprisingly far but if she doesn‚Äôt have Corrupt she‚Äôs less powerful then a M1 killer like Myers or with a projectile like Huntress
---
There's a bug DCing 1-3 survivors at a time. If you don't here the DC audio cue then it's the bug.
---
We can almost see the "Oh shit!" look on Ace's face when he saw Bubba was here
---
when you wanna pop your Tier 3 Evil Within for an instadown, remember you can leave Tier 2 at 99% and when you are close enough to a survivor, stalk him to get to Tier 3 and instadown him/her
---
not if people are smart and break all the totems 
---
or just leave
---
NOED should never grant you more than one kill. you're wasting a perk slot for maybe getting one kill.
---
I agree with everything except BMing. I personally got used to dealing with toxicity but I would never condone being a dick
---
You‚Äôre right, if the game allows you to do it you‚Äôre obligated to do it, sure maybe it‚Äôs a bug and an exploit but then it will get fixed in time by the devs, but as long as it‚Äôs doable in game you should be allowed to do it no matter what opinion that creates about you by your opponent
---
people don't even cleanse them when they see it. that's the problem. don't look for them, just check totem locations when you're near and cleanse them if they are there.
---
But also if the two killers are coordinated they could trap and kill individual survivors at an alarming rate.
---
but it will happen. noed probably won't
---
Last week in one of my games, I did 3 gens with ruin while my team was still looking for the totem.
---
when you see noed, you either go find it or escape, don't play a hero.
---
noed should never give you more than one kill.
---
gens wont be getting done so im fine üòî
---
What the meg ?
---
it is.
---
just lag switch lul
---
But being high rank gets you nothing aside from bragging rights which tbh as this thread proves doesnt even matter anyway as the pipping criteria is weird.
---
Watching people crouch behind a pallet and throw it down for the stun even when they aren't injured is still worse than people dropping pallets after a hit.
---
What if the gates aren't open yet because you are playing soloq also totems in soloq are almost impossible because either you do the totems and no gens get done at all or all of the gens get done and you get no gen points, it's just shitty in general for soloq.
---
Cosmetics and a double bloodpoints soon
---
Wasn‚Äôt shitpost at first. Was labeled ‚ÄúDiscussion.‚Äù

Nah, Anna best, Adiris second.
---
I honestly feel like she isnt getting anything because of the eventual release of the bunny costume, but in the mean time everyone else is getting 4 more costumes while BHVR says, nah Feng doesnt need any, shes gonna get the Bunny costume eventually. 
---
This Bunny costume is seeming more and more like a curse than a blessing...
---
He didn't give reasons but I don't understand why did he delete it. Should have at least kept the channel up, get some money and let people enjoy the content
---
Yo I had this exact thing happen at this locker as huntress a few days ago too
---
Rank matters to me because it means 1) as killer I won't get potato survivors and 2) as a survivor I won't verse or play people that are a lot better than me (I suck at survivor, I'm a killer main that needs more practice on that side). I do REALLY want rewards for rank though. Free bloodpoints/auric cells/iridescent shards, exclusive skins for rank 1, something like that.
---
Once in a while it can be a good laugh haha
---
I put her:
---
Nurse
---
Billy
---
Spirit
---
Huntress
---
Hag
---
Myers
---
Plague
---
I didn't, clearly... Lol. Hence my wording.
---
 People constantly whinge about teabagging and although the post I was replying to wasn't directly referring to it - he brought it into his argument about toxic survivors - so I personally would assume they are one of these people. But I made sure my text didn't accuse him of such with no evidence. ... If that helps.
---
Have it on video, I‚Äôll look into making a bug report on it.
---
Cries in Feng.
---
You better be joking. Imagine the latency. I'm interested to see how they'll pull it off.
---
Hitboxes are fine. It's called client interpretation. It's not a difficult concept.
---
Alt+Tab - the number one DBD player tool.
---
Context: It was a facecamping huntress, like full on, standing in front of you, not hitting anyone else, facecamping huntress. Two of us were opening the exit gates and she came running with her rabbit lookin' head.  
---
She downed me and put her ears right in my face, the Jake came a running and saved me but got downed as soon as I got off the hook (she missed with her hatchet). She then downed me inside the main building in the picture and proceeded to stand RIGHT on top of me, a term I am now coining "butt camping" with her hatchet raised waiting for the 3rd person to come and rescue the Jake off the hook. I tried crawling for the exit (which we had opened) but Jake was saved, I was picked up and hooked, there were three sad survivors.  
---
TLDR: Huntress camped me whilst standing on my butt, now calling this butt camping.
---
OMAM is the first book that ever made me cry real man tears. How dare you for reminding me
---
You did our Axey Girl good :)
---
Huntress' legs be juicy.
---
Call me bad, but I used to be at rank 7 as a solo survivor, but ever since the rank reset, 12 is the highest ive been at before going right back to rank 14. Between DCs and dying first hook, I cant rank up.
---
Hatchkicking is complete bullshit, its not a step in the right direction.
---
Wetter than the ocean rn
---
Is that a surprise? LOL
---
This stuff is actually pretty cheap. Yet again i am a survivor of POE's microtransactions. 40$ outfits lol
---
Thanks!
---
You like mending? You Won't Soon.
---
but yeah, just a constant borrowed time on you, heal it or be downed I believe, combined with ridiculously obnoxious addon combos (two knive blades let you have mends that would take longer and longer with an exploit, reaching minutes for one heal, never fixed, or disabled, jist "banned if you use it".
---
None of this helps take this game seriously, they turned a great concept of horror into a chill, comedy genre-type of game.
---
Problem is, there are thousands games better than that in that such category, and which would be much more funnier to play. So DBD loses its appeal by DBD devs being money-greedy and creating DLCs that appeal to teenagers.
---
Honestly, fuck the bunny outfit, its the reason we havent gotten anything in almost a year!
---
Meanwhile everyone elses gets several costumes, we get the tease of 1 skin that all we have is a grainy picture of!
---
ITS CURSED I TELL YOU! CURSED!!

Death by snu snu :D
---
It‚Äôs always a Huntress or a Myers that camps for me...
---
As a killer i only facecamp if a certain survivor BM's me. (T-bagging, flashlight flickering and all that stuff, you know what im talking about)
---
I'll probably get "gen rushed" and de-pip but i don't care, the camped BM boi is going down with me :)
---
then the killer comes to YOU and you know damn well they think you can‚Äôt hit skill checks and that you‚Äôre a noob when it was your teammate who‚Äôs urban evasioning 20 miles away by now
---
On PS4 I usually get half yellow half red tbh, but nobody has ever seemed especially laggy against me, even when I would occasionally play Survivor with some friends.
---
I am so triggered. 13-year-old me cried at the end of that book.
---
I'm bad at nurse, huntress and hag
---
Nurse because she requires a lot of skill and time
---
Huntress because I can't stand 110 speed and I'm not the best with hatchets
---
Hag because I don't know how to properly counter pallets and I can't instantly move my camera and hit after teleporting
---
I really want to be good with nurse and huntress though, they're among the most fun to play imo
---
That pure grin on his face the entire time.
---
Survivors want NOED removed so much that they refuse to even touch totems. So you can one hit down them all and they all like *surprised pikachu face*.
---
What if susie is just a prestge 4 claudette :thinking:
---
I guess? I think people look to much into these announcements
---
Laughs in class photo freddy
---
It's simple, let the market decide. Someone shrewd saw that DBD tapped into a great feeling of thrill/hunting instinct among humans, and created a game based on that.
---
Someone else must create a similar game, then let the DBD arrogant devs reap what they sow.
---
okay
---
Did someone say Legion with franks, ebony mori and moonwalking?
---
I'd be interested to see the answer to this, too.
---
were you playing Ash perchance?

I thought uwu was just a smily face or something. Crap have I been using it wrong? Does every one think Im a furry now? Oh gawd oh fuck!

---
When I was rank 13, I stunned a hillbilly twice with a pallet. When he got me after 50 seconds, guess what? I got face camped. Luckily my teams managed to do 4 gens in the time being and escaped.
---
No instead the minute the killer is on you run to and drop every pallet on the map in like 2 minutes! That‚Äôll show em!
---
RANK 10
---
&gt; I get  chased by the killer
---
&gt; The 2 random claudettes on the other side of the map hide
---
&gt; The killer slugs me
---
&gt; The killer kills the claudettes and farms with me cus he felt bad
---
Me and the killer: Claudette wtf were you doing??!!
---
Claudette: Doing gens, you?
---
One time I was panicking because of a ruin and then said we just have to work though it 5 gens later I open the gate Dwight walks up to me shows me killer turns out he was afk
---
People who genuinely believe this are hilarious, survivors are good/bad worldwide its not some specific area are better
---
It‚Äôs the face paint stuff he has. I had to really simplify it to make it fit the old Disney style.
---
I play him a lot because he somehow makes me the most BPs. I could make more with doctor, but i don't find that fun at all. 
---
Bubba is just a fun time getting at least 50k BPs while running around swinging your chainsaw
---
That‚Äôs amazing lmao
---

---
True, lol.
---
I will finally be able to prestige one of my characters
---
Man, all those Pizza Dwights we murdered are coming back for us.
---
Nope. Game freaked out and said I had no internet connection when I actually did the whole time. Lol
---
Id say killer games are much easier since the update. That being said, streamers will always put out the games that make them look best. So little bit of A, little bit of B.
---
those are rookie mistakes xD theyll learn eventually
---
Don't most killers. Oh no they have insta down chainsaws and blinking oh and ranged and a variety of different ways to play them we basically get to go against mithers every game. Basically we can summon no mithers.
---
There are only 4 perks for killer that give you BP.
---
* Barbecue &amp; Chili \[ALL CATEGORIES\] 
---
* Beast of Prey \[HUNTER\] 
---
* Distressing \[DEVIOUSNESS\] 
---
* Hex: Thrill of the Hunt \[HUNTER\] 
---
Barbecue and Chili is a must have. You can't bloodpoint farm without it. Beast of Prey and TOTH are small boosts, it would almost definitely be better to run perks that would secure you kills more easily, since that equals more points anyway. Distressing I would run since it gives a noticeable amount and is also beneficial to Doctor in general, since his Static Field is equal to his terror radius, so you'll be able to increase survivors' madness and make them scream from further away.
---
I don't understand this though. If i manage to avoid the killer, complete a load of generators and escape, i should pip. I had a game just like that yesterday and i didn't pip, and it's frustrating because i shouldn't have to purposefully get into chases in order to get a pip.
---
Is that because you have Barbecue and Chili on him and you don't have it on Doctor?
---
They revealed outfits today instead of letting them get revealed tomorrow.
---
Careful, wouldn't want you to get overwhelmed by all that surprise.
---
#SLUGGED.

Does he make you the most because you don't have Barbecue and Chili on other killers?

Times like this make me glad I only have/play one survivor and only care about them. Then I only will buy an outfit for them if I absolutely like it. Otherwise I'll just stick to buying the DLC for new chapters.
---
I'd choose the one who inevitably finds a flashlight and clicks it at me.
---
Really thank you
---
I think I heard a missed skull check lol.
---
No prob!
---
PTSD
---
Ruin and Lullaby show up as soon as you get a skill check, but you only know about Devour Hope if you witness them leaving the hook with a speed boost, or when they start instadowning people. Even if the killer has 3 hooks and isn't instadowning people yet, maybe they missed out on one token from being too close to the hook. It's far better to cleanse a Haunted Grounds than it is to risk leaving Devour Hope up.
---
Only if you use Corrupt alot
---
yup, and lately it seems like killers cant handle being hit by a single pallet.
---
next up, GeT fAceCamPeD LiTtLE tOxIC gEn RePaIRIng ShIT
---
Fuck your pips, play properly or gtfo out of my game you cunt.
---
Play something else if every game makes you wanna dc, NO ONE WANTS PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THEIR GAME
---
Just a suggestion but if you make a new post you could link to your previous surveys. I know you mention them but I had to go through your profile to find your RBT stats and only found part two.
---
What are they supposed to do, let you hit the injured one? Their goal is to survive xD
---
I hope this is a troll because if not you are one of the reasons this game has a shit community
---
The fact that you need to preemptively justify your loadout already says enough about this community.
---
Or sometimes they just know where you'll go and meet you there lol
---
Eh if i get those awfully obvious SWF groups i just go to a corner and stay there until they leave. Fuck that.
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit. Don't listen to these idiots who play huntress, she's consistently mid tier at rank 1 and you won't see her get play in any serious tournament.
---
Urban evasion is a decent perk, most people who use it crouch around the map like idiots though.
---
This is hilarious.
---
What I normally do is run windstorm for both of my add ons, so whenever I get a thrill of the hunt notification I can run straight for my ruin totem and get there before they destroy the totem.
---
Sure dude blame killers for survivor dcs. Makes sense. 
---
Guess it even counts as playing unfair as killer now when you find and down someone 10 secs in? 
---
Fucking moron
---
When this happens, go for someone else. U can't expect to chase the same person all game and NOT expect the gens to get done within two min. Thats what I don't get about some killers. If u can't catch someone and u know they are trying to gen rush u, go for the ppl on gens instead of letting that one survivor distract u. If u would've chased someone else u could've at least slowed the game down if not gotten a kill or maybe two.
---
If you think hatch kicking was not the solution think about this, last survivor, the endgame collapse starts, you run to the hatch and the killer arrives at the same time, now the hatch stand off begins, ah wait the killer only has to wait 3 minutes before the entity kills you or you pray that the killer doozes off and you get the escape.
---
Agreed. Any time I bring the perk it just seems like they know the spawns. I'm not mad since its much better to have good opponents than whiny trash that rage at me for playing the game in postgame chat. However, itts extremely annoying since I o ly even bring it on lategame builds since the gen rush is real.
---
SAME !!!!!!!!!!
---
all i see is campers and tunnelers
---
It's because the developers want both sides to have an enjoyable game so they are discouraging that kind of playstyle as it is not fun for the killer player to never see s survivor and then lose. I totally get where you're coming from that you think you should be rewarded for avoiding the killer, but that's not how they have it working atm.
---
GG you wasted at least 10 minuets.
---
I like Franklin's Demise primarily on Trapper and Hag. Its just so much fun to knock their items out of their hands, down/hook them, go to the item and set a trap under it. They always see the item over the traps at first and don't think to slow down and disarm them when it's Trappers bear bear traps, and you can also use Bloody Coil to ensure that when they wise up and disarm the trap they hurt themselves. Hag on the other hand just jump-scares the crap out of them every time as they often trigger the phantasm right before picking their item back up. Hag can also get good use out of the rusty shackles add-on so that they have no idea they've triggered it until you teleport to the spot and give em a smack right after they get their item back (I've actually destroyed flashlights this way). 
---
Up until Franklin's Demise came out, I always thought the trap setting killers could use a little bait. ;P
---
I WANT CRAPPER IN THE NEXT DLC
---
What rank are you playing killer where people are hiding in corners??
---
Dumbass-&gt;English translation: I've played killer once.
---
Why?
---
This happened to me a few times last night (they messed up the gen, not me. Except for maybe like one time.) and each time, they fled the scene.
---
Facecamping with insidious and a one hit down character (especially someone like LF who can down multiple ppl at once) literally takes no skill to do. Even new killers can do that with LF and insidious. This video is unimpressive and makes the killer side of the community look bad. And if those survivors we're smart they would've looked through the wood after the second person got hooked and realized u was a camping basement bubba and stayed away or tried to lure u out while someone else saved with borrowed time. 
---
I did a game with Leatherface the other day and got a 4k before the first gen was done at Cold wind WITHOUT camping. And I hardly ever use Bubba. But ofc I had a ebony momento Mori but at least I hooked each survivor at least once and went to break gens, like why use bbq and bitter murmer if ur not gonna actually USE them? Like wtf? What's the point?
---
make.. make him virbrate
---
You guys I just wanna say: We. Need. More. Civil. Discussions. Like. This.
---
There's still hope for this community :P
---
Save our forest! Too many trees are going down because of scary survivors!
---
imagine crying about 10 bucks LOL
---
What is that? A TV for ants?!
---
Wraith would love to have a word.
---
Running is fine 90% of the time though. If you only ever walk, you are slowing down the game and helping the killer.
---
Hey, fuck Jontron. He's a racist asshole.
---
Imagine trying to make fun of people on the internet and failing miserably
---
So when can we expect a new Billy skin? Beacuse he really isn't getting enough love in that department. /s
---
I'll simply play the game. I might get a little aggravated but it's whatever
---
So... Does headless chicken really look around?
---
Exactly, i will stay near the hook if all 3 of the other guys come charging towards it before i even placed 2 traps near the hook.
---
Personally I‚Äôm in evening over legion
---
Idk, a lot of responces I got are of people getting the reference, Of Mice and Men is still being read in high schools which is how I know it.
---
I'll never understand the uninstall insult. Even if you were a bad killer, is the message that there is a skill requirement to playing a game you own?
---
Thanks, will deffo do a bit of research! I've had this a while but not played since it was on PS Plus last year. I pretty much only play as survivor just extremely rusty! What level is it they get the teachables?
---
does jake have burns on his face?
---
Huntress: LOOK AT THIS HATCHET
---
Teacher: Huntress, this is the 7th week in a row you've shown us a hatchet
---
&gt; feng was coming out of the closet
---
Is there really more to add?
---
Stomps bad survivors, gets wrecked by good survivors...Upper mid tier.  With certain add-ons she‚Äôs competitive, same as the other mid tier killers.  I‚Äôd agree with the others, somewhere around the Myers range.
---
üòÇ

I am pretty sure he has. Look in the bodies section not the packages.
---
Your house looks really depressing.

Face camp the meg with the hat

he just got a new skin last week...

Lol, exactly its so stupid xD

If you watch them on twitch you can clearly see that they at least 3k in like 95% of their games. I cant speak for all streamers but most of them are just this good
---
You can't make a meme complaining about something but claim to be the ones not bitching.. come on now.
---
Because your shit and have to camp doesn‚Äôt mean survivors are op
---
‚ÄúFor the greater good‚Äù
---
.... who‚Äôs owned by a pedophile, the creeper looks pretty cool so unfortunate
---
Camping is an officially promoted strategy, I know you said that but it will get lost in the kerfluffle here. Giving points to people for being on the hook is probably not going to happen. If you get hooked it is because you fucked something up, it is a punishment not a vacation.  
---
The matchmaking is not broken. It is working as intended. There are just so few players that it isn't able to make a fair match every time. There are many factors involved in matchmaking such as; physical location, internet speed, rank and many more I am probably unaware of.  
---
Your idea of what the Endgame Collapse is quite erroneous. It is meant to expedite matches so that things like Survivors staying to needlessly hold the game hostage are removed. Along with hatch standoffs which are excruciatingly boring. And in general it will make the matches go by much quicker than before. I would seriously question your friend's experience at the "thousand hours" mark if they cannot understand the intent behind the Collapse.  
---
There is challenge and sportsmanship in this game. I would suggest playing more before deciding you have seen everything that DbD has to offer. I still find surprises every once in awhile and I have definitely played way longer than you.
---
__*The greater good*__
---
ghostface
---
I seem to always gets DC when I down someone early in the match. Then I can't get my full BBQ stacks. :(  Sad times.
---
It's not like it will be fixed immediately. We have seen the scrambled code, which means the devs are pretty amatuer tier. There's not much they can do besides actively work on fixing them and constantly pestering them probably frustrates them. Being angry is ok because gamebreaking bugs shouldn't happen, what isn't okay is acting like the devs don't care because they aren't the best devs out there. BHVR is a small sized company now with amateur game devs. Expecting League of Legends or Call of Duty quick patches is like asking a college American Football team to go against GB Packers and have a close game.
---
So, for the time being you just play a different game until it's fixed for what you care about or play it in small doses. Games are for enjoyment, when you stop enjoying them stop playing them.
---
yeah this happened to two people in a trial i was in a few days ago on backwater. one was in SWF with me so he told me to get the killer and point so he could get taken out. the other messaged me saying they were trapped. 
---
seems when this happen the killer has to get you out. ive been avoiding lockers since.
---
I‚Äôd say billy is better than spirit, with no add one
---
Haha i love it! If you feel the need to let the killer know you won, you deserve this. Did he reply to your message?
---
There was ever a penalty?
---
Freddy rework will just arm him with flashlights to stun survivors constantly
---
Ugh imagine how annoying it would be watching a movie with Michael and The Nurse with all that heavy breathing
---
i disagree but okay
---
I preferred [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/beu7k3/when_youre_the_last_survivor_and_the_killer/) one.
---
No it‚Äôs just not bannable. Is it a dick move? Yeah, but it isn‚Äôt illegal. It‚Äôs not an exploit or cheating
---
This isn‚Äôt the sunk cost fallacy.
---
I think it is because the next hit when you would get downed is the same for MoM and BT so the both apply and BT has a higher priority I think.
---
Even knowing where they are, it's still much quicker with small game since you don't have to go round obstacles and go to the edges to find the totems.
---
&gt;Legion: 300 people joined, 201 left, so on average 67&amp; of the survivors DC against them
---
Lol
---
Hillbilly is one of the best killers and comes with the game. Nurse is best and can be purchased with shards. As can spirit, who is equal to hillbilly. Hag and Huntress are next and can both be obtained with shards. This game is play to win, not pay to win.
---
This, and also ping filter is needed.
---
When i go killer, almost always survivors ping its below 120, most times green.
---
When i go survivor i keep getting matched with red pings or around 200, over and over. HELLO?
---
I dont get why match with red ping if 99% of survivors will leave when they see it, its pointless and time wasting for everyone, killer included
---
Not bad good sir/madam! I was expecting earrape and flashlight spam, but instead I got some generally funny moments. Ya got a few chuckles outta me ü§üüèæ.
---
This drops today, right? Pumped to try this out! So sick of survivors just hanging out at the gate after a match:
---
Even better, crouch behind the gen while the killer kicks it (don't try this unless you're feeling lucky...)
---
This is a very nifty tie-in.  Now I understand why the collection is called the Threadbare Thirties.  As the novel was set during the great depression back in the 1930s.  
---
It's a nice use of Jake and David, both of whom fit the description of George and Lennie (smart, resourceful smaller guy and the big guy who is prone to violence who care for each other a lot)
---
It's also clever of them to tie Jake to the mining industry, which again, The Trapper was a part of.
---
I was suprised it was so low.
---
Borrowed gonna trigger first so it kind of makes MoM useless.
---
Ngl, I don't think the cosmetic store is bad. No loot boxes and the prices are decent.
---
oh god oh fuck
---
Then at the very least crop it, lazy OP
---
&gt; Listen here you little shit
---
Oh boy, you're one of *those*. Enjoy the DCs until the devs fix the game.
---
I stepped in his crap oh fuck
---
My friend got face camped by some guy and told me his name. I remembered it and waited for him to play survivor and get in my lobby. I downed him and put him on the basement hook and sat there looking at him. He messaged me and asked what he did. I told him why I did it then he blocked me.
---
Good survivors push through Ruin.
---
&gt; "Hook humpers" are killers that hook a survivor and then just chill in a corner nearby or stand face-to-face with them.
---
that is called camping.
---
also, people have done research on the benefits of the prestige shit, and it's honestly not that big of a difference. it comes down to luck, except people who prestige have like 3% extra luck
---
He has virtually no counterplay and an extremely annoying power.
---
I wouldn't say camping is a promoted strategy just because three members of BI's studio did some apathetic hand-waiving during a brief Q&amp;A. It easily dominates the search results for DBD because I'm really not alone in seeing it as a cornball style of play. I don't necessarily believe that survivors should be rewarded for being hooked but if the validation for camping a hook is that it benefits your team, then *all* members of the team should benefit, not just those that either abandon you or are unable to assist because the killer has set up camp in front of you.
---
Matchmaking is 100% broken. Pip system is inconsistent and does a really poor job of ranking players based on their actual skill or knowledge of the game. Plus, seasonal resets, something I haven't experienced yet thankfully, only serves to exacerbate the matter. Add in the archaic P2P matching that leapfrogs regions and the whole becomes an obvious mess. It's 9:30am EST on a Tuesday and the game has 19k players online. There's no issue with population.
---
In my now-46 hours in this game, I've yet to see a single game where survivors hold the match "hostage". I've seen tea-bagging and a quick exit but nothing more. Meanwhile, I've seen killers stand idle next to a hook while the door is being opened thirty feet away dozens of times and I've seen killers body-block hatches and refuse to swing. Yet, we're about to see sweeping changes to end-game that will not only make it infinitely easier on killers but eliminate goodwill farm sessions (or hatch rescues by the killer) that arise from the aforementioned broken matchmaking.
---
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that my sense of humor isn't completely lost on others haha. I CANNOT STAND when people do the blown out audio thing. It's such a disrespect toward the viewer... 
---
I'm definitely never going to put together a show-off compilation, or something super toxic like a 360 compilation or flashlight fuckery. 
---
I hope to get a few more chuckles out of you in the future! I'm new to sharing these to people outside of my general social circles, so any comments or suggestions you have would be awesome!

---
Oh.  This must be when we had that match against the doctor who teleported us back to where we were no matter how quickly we tried to run away from him.
---
Yeah buddy call all the killers canping dipshits but put your tail between your legs like the little bitch you are when someone insults you. Must be rough knowing you're in the wrong
---
No thanks man I need advice for this stuff. It'll make the videos better. Thanks!
---
I called him a little shit because I had the same discussion with the guy yesterday and all he can say is stuff like "enjoy the dc's until they fix it" and other stuff like the camping killers are to blame nonsense.
---
And to be honest I am quite fed up with that shit. So call it cringy if you wish, but the game is literally unplayable right now because of people like him. And since apparently he thinks DC'ing is funny there is no need to treat him respectfully
---
It happens a lot. I‚Äôve realized that a lot of red ranks survivors are really bad at the game and get extremely salty over literally anything. It surprises me how someone can have such a massive ego to not accept when they lost fare and square.
---
You are very clearly ignorant then. High level blood webs spawn more nodes naturally. Higher prestige blood webs are pretty much the same as low prestige bloodwebs
---
This is easily the best thing in the subreddit
---
Yep, casual reminder that being stealthy more often results in just shifting killer aggro to teammates that have fewer hook states left than actually wasting the killers time resulting in a net gain for your team.
---
&gt; 11 am est
---
that is the time.
---
They revealed some upcoming cosmetics before people find them in the files for the PTB/next patch. It's a pretty shitty surprised to be honest.
---
well, are you level 50?
---
Use your power more
---
i choose wraith and just tormet them by ringing my bell and thats it.
---
and then question why it wasnt a group of anything that makes sense.
---
*mischievous oink*
---
Good stuff, OP. A bit of levity in these trying times.
---
Didn't know that, thanks!
---
What the whole thing about?
---
It'll eventually show up.
---
ur not lunging when you should, and you are lunging when you shouldnt, ik its hard but practice makes perfection
---
if only they were the other way around, would be perfect
---
Check the character information. Their perks are listed there and it will show you if they're unlocked.
---
When I thought he couldn't get more attractive damn
---
The point of it is if you aren't hitting a lot of great ruin skillchecks then you aren't practicing enough. Sure 9/10 is bad, but as you try more and more that number should go down. Don't worry about being bad at that start just keep practicing.
---
Yeah but damage puke is really good
---
‚ÄúOn fire‚Äù is probably overly dramatic. They decided to launch right before Christmas, took some time off for the holiday, and came back to find a user base livid about the lack of launch support. Now, it hasn‚Äôt released on Steam yet and there‚Äôs a gremlin in the back of my head saying, ‚ÄúWell it isn‚Äôt really actually out yet then, is it?‚Äù So they do have a window to fix things.
---
It would have shown up at the Level 40 Bloodweb on Claudette. You either kept missing it (it‚Äôs an orange colour, not like normal perks) or you already have it and don‚Äôt realise.
---
They should‚Äôve made it so you get crows for a certain time after the gates are open. But the endgame collapse is coming so I guess it won‚Äôt be necessary anymore
---
oh, the spectate bug is still around... welp
---
Its funny when you hit someone on a standing pallet. And you chase them through it. They try to drop the pallet but instead pick up the item that was dropped. I downed two survivors one game because this happened.
---
between 10-11 east
---
What? So if I‚Äôm maxed in objectives and altruism and haven‚Äôt been chased at all I‚Äôm toxic for getting the killer to chase me because I‚Äôm ensuring my pip?
---
Yeah, the devs just don't know how to accurately judge what makes a player good.
---
Like they are sort of on the right track, but there is a huge difference between getting one hook per person and only sacrificing one person, and getting one hook per person and getting all 4. Ultimately it punishes the killer when someone else does something dumb, which is terrible game design.
---
They also need to count a survivor DC as completing that survivor's 3 hooks. Especially if the DC is immediate.
---
either that or an attempt of fixing current joining bugs
---
If you're prestiged Claudette thing it's highly likely you've already "unlocked" Self-care for other survivors. What this means however is that it's only available to be found in their bloodwebs when a new one is spawned. 
---
So you'll have to keep leveling up the other characters until it decides to pop up for that specific character. Rinse and repeat for every survivor who you want to have it on.
---
Wraith would be more fitting IMHO
---
What? You may wanna re-read his comment, you apparently conpletely missed his point
---
no im saying that's just what toxic ppl usually do. Doesn't mean you are toxic tho
---
isnt the point of a hex to be high risk high reward? cuz all I see is a hex with very high reward and no counter play other than "shit i hope this isnt HG"
---
So will there be the Freddy rework or nah?
---
Dang, yea this is sad when the servers are so bad yet they can pump out new outfits for $.  I also hate that I got the special edition but it only gives random survivors or killers randoms clothing items. It doesn't make any sense. Each one should have different pieces of clothing to wear, not only some.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hear that cough again
---
I made a thing [https://imgur.com/67smuMx](https://imgur.com/67smuMx)
---
It‚Äôs pretty damn really good!
---
Damn that‚Äôs really cool. I read the book and watched the movie recently but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever make that connection.
---
I didn‚Äôt even see it, can you link it?
---
Buy leatherface for FACECAMP
---
Ah thanks. Yeah I've never played it so I didn't know. I assumed the "women are in the game and that's why people don't like it" couldn't be true and it must be shitty for other reasons. Sounds like it had a lot of issues.
---
Literally impossible not to get hit by em, if you dodge her puke you'll still have to throw down a pallet that's been puked on or a window (which btw BHVR that was an unnecessary part of her kit and is dumb). I dunno how you got hag up there but yeah basically your list but without Hag.
---
The only difference I can clearly notice in regional differences (as a NA killer) is when I am playing Asian players. They seem to BM waaaaay less. That‚Äôs the only difference. 
---
Then when my people start waking up and getting on, so much more salt and BMing.
---
But as far as actual skill, I can not tell a difference in the slightest. That‚Äôs a pretty far fetched statement to assume one region has ‚Äúbetter gamers‚Äù. I mean come on lol.
---
Salt doesn‚Äôt hydrate you though
---
Jake‚Äôs eyes tho...
---
So stop using RNG-based crutchperks no?
---
How did you get that background to the perks?
---
Nice stats and it is approximately what I expected but I thought Doc would be higher than 25% tbh.
---
Pretty comfortably mid-tier, maybe trending toward upper. Her ability to be her strongest is pretty predicated upon survivor behavior, more than most other killers
---
I thought Doc would be higher than 25%, lol.
---
I've have the game for ages just made it out in the video that I just got it. I am shit at the game though XD
---
The game isn't on pc, is it?
---
I really don‚Äôt get the frustration behind playing against doc.
---
Fair enough. And with those streamers, that‚Äôs their job to be good. Could you imagine how great we‚Äôd be if we had nothing else to do then spend hours with the game?
---
Haha same goes for you Dotey, thanks for being on the positive side!
---
&gt;A ~~villain~~ **HERO** among men.
---
fixed that for you.
---
&gt; Literally impossible not to get hit by em
---
You should try playing her if you think this. And I loop her puke all the time when I play survivor. It's very loopable and frankly kind of buggy and will fly right through survivors. Also the cool down after using Vile Purge is extremely annoying
---
Is that his mori? ü§î
---
**_Looking for the ruin totem because my PC is lower ended and I can't even do great skill checks without ruin_**
---
They either DC, stay on a gen and or immersed and scared and lea e you on hook.  Had a game where it was me and a buddy and two Dwight‚Äôs.  When they both were hooked we u hooked them safely.  When my buddy gets hooked and I‚Äôm getting chased then hooked what are the other two survivors doing?  Crouch walking and on a gen.  Needless to say we both were left on the hook and this happens too many times.
---
I don't mind him too much myself but people who like to play stealthy really hate going against him from my experience.
---
They also often tend to tunnel since the hooked guy is often easy to find if he is in Madness 3 and they can get obnoxious with a 3 gen strat.
---
That's true, is a better time for most.
---
Oh that's a good way to approach it. Or if the timeline for dying on hook is they immediately attempted escape then gave up, it doesn't matter how near or far you were. Or something.
---
The game just punishes people fo stuff other people do too much. If I'm never found in a match I can still do shit for that shard because I didn't go follow the killer around in their terror radius. Just dumb.
---
I'm more surprised about Freddy's low number. Even though he is not strong he can be really rage inducing.
---
Reddit steals from Instagram too :/
---
Load up Bubba so I can finally get enough Meg faces to finish the Athlete-Face mask.
---
Agreed. Who uses Ruin on Nurse? At least you are playing with two perks once Ruin gets destroyed since Thanatophobia doesn't actually do anything.
---
What time and time zone do you get paired with Asian players cuz id love a little bm game
---
Rank 15- I got camped by a huntress of all things. Skill checks are blown every 10 seconds. I managed to loop a killer around a rock with no pallets for about a minute and a half. Traps are placed right in the open, and people still step in them. Survivors think that entering a locker in the middle of a chase makes them invincible.
---
Care to explain how?
---
I made the new Jake skin my lock screem
---
Play Claudette with urban evasion
---
where else am i supposed to eat my quesarito? at home? where I could get cheese on the carpet???
---
&gt; they were Nurse and Billy.
---
lmfao bruh
---
I only use The Pig and Spirit so I‚Äôm all good lmao
---
Thnx for Kill Legion devs
---
Corruption is really good at screwing over people in exit gates, especially because you can‚Äôt hit one survivor twice, and if your skilled enough, twice without a full charge
---
What new skin ?
---
Gen tapping triggers me so much. D;
---
Dude you are kidding me right? There are no auras on that picture
---
Thx &lt;3
---
cant get facecamped if you never got hooked *points at head*
---
Was hoping someone would say this. Absolutely!
---
I just looked and it's not. My mistake. Either way i'm sure it's going to function better in the ways I stated above when it does come. Much like most other games that have been released between the 2 platforms. It's not to say pc is necessarily better than console but it handles certain tasks far better. And the argument for the console limitations doesn't become invalid with just 1 game. Especially considering, like I said earlier, the bevy of problems that game suffered and suffers even to this day.
---
Oh thank God. I guess I misread it.
---
The fact that you are new enough to not know what exposed is so adorable. I think we all rember when we thought that and cringe lol. It is rather weirdly named wich i dont understand why they named it that.
---
urban evasion, iron will, calm spirit and pebble, you can swap pebble for something else if you want
---
I was going to say this is PTB, but looking at it, it's probably bugfixing the infinite loading screen or maybe matchmaking itself trying to be improved. They also said the dedicated servers would be slowly rolled out and that it would be in the Summer. It's coming, just know they're definitely going to give us some heads up before it's rolled out.
---
I purposely throw killer games to depip so the trophies are easier. 
---
I usually just load in as Huntress and throw axes at a locker to progress for the 1,000 axe throws trophy.
---
So I'm not the only one who calls the perk pebble, Interesting! Thanks for the tips.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that
---
I reckon PTB will be up in about 10 minutes if they're posting this now. I'm excited to see how fluid survivor feels, but I'm anxious to see if there's any noticable delay as killer, since you'll no longer be hosting the game yourself.
---
Shit, I probably do the same face lol
---
r/ihadastroke
---
You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm a pig main so I should be good
---
Ill have totry this cause im trash with her as well
---
Great work. I've been really interested in seeing a statistic like this. 
---
My biggest surprise is why Spirit is so low at 3.66% when you consider Hillbilly and Nurse are at 19.33% and 21.33%
---
*I'd personally* much rather go against a Hillbilly or Nurse instead of Spirit.
---
I was just trying to point out that a game as graphically and memory intensive as red dead being able to work on my original ps4. Dead by daylight a game that released 3 or so years ago really has no excuse for its poor optimization
---
honestly i dont even remember the proper name for it
---
Thank you for being so nice! I really love Huntress but I'm so bad at playing her ;-;
---
I try to throw cross map hatchets whenever I see auras but I never hit anyone. In general my throws aren't really accurate. Good survivors can also dodge hatchets so well so I sometimes can hardly snipe anyone in a match. I watched some Huntress guide videos on how to predict survivors but I still can't hit.
---
I play survivor more often than killer and I usually play Hag or Spirit if I'm climbing ranks so I have only played Huntress for maybe less than a hundred matches. I'm planning to pick her up but I'm still missing so many hatchets and have no idea how to deal with survivors crouching at safe loops. I know you can hit them with hatchets if you time it and aim it right but I just don't know how ;-;
---
-5 chaser emblem for proximity to hooked survivors, you only loose chaser emblem for that if there isn‚Äôt a survivor close to the hook. ü§îü§îü§î
---
The sad thing is that there was also a feng who thought she was good and spammed her flashlight to get me to chase her and then she‚Äôd go down immediately.
---
Shadowborn helped me get better as nurse. A rank 1 nurse who slaughtered me on ps4 told me to try running it and it is a godsend for when youre learning her
---
Me neither.
---
&gt; a game crash makes none at all
---
You can also simulate this while disconnecting intentionally so the number is probably still higher
---
Same
---
That a matter of perspective. Whenever any game I play gets frustrating for me, wether it be the mechanics or my ability, I go play another game. Or just take a break entirely.
---
So when he said that, I nodded and agreed. Because I already did it. I still play DbD. I still love DbD. But I also play Apex, Titanfall 2, red dead, and pubg mobile. 
---
It's about variety.
---
This is amazing news!
---
Legion got a new skin?
---
I don‚Äôt know may you?
---
I love it when people report me for camping ( yes I camp at the end when the gates are open but only then)
---
Play Killer.
---
Autodidact. You could also run Bond instead of pebble to see your teammate running around. I use it to avoid teammates like the plague if I think they are being followed by the killer
---
Just use Small Game.
---
But Thrill of the hunt and Devour is so fun on billy...
---
3 minutes with the exit gates already open. I doubt the killer is going to get much fun out of collapse, it is more of a way to curb survivors just messing with killers or hiding in a locker for 20 minutes.
---
The clown makes me hope that we might be getting a killer from the 1700s with a map. We get cosmetics based around killer chapters like butcher trapper for the game and racoon/ranger hillbilly for red forest/ormond. MIGHT be getting my hopes up though.
---
He just tried to bully you out of learning Nurse to save the world
---
We‚Äôre gonna live forever, a lot of farming teammates, but it‚Äôs okay teammates are expendable for the blood hunt
---
Cry. I cry
---
Urban evasion (Nea)
---
Iron will (Jake)
---
Self-Care (Claudette)
---
Spine Chill
---
With this build you can be really sneaky. With spine chill you can see if the killer is approaching you, and with Urban evasion you can crawl and hide 100% faster. With iron will he won't be able to hear you when wounded so if you are hidding he won't hear you. Have fun.
---
DJ Khaled as killer when?
---
With dedicated servers, all players are connected to one server. If one player loses connection, everyone else will remain connected. This information will help us better identify and punish players who intentionally disconnect going forward.  
---
Oh my god thank goodness! This is huge.
---
Can't wait to not get bullshit hatchet hits/melee hits.
---
The problem imo is in the reward structure and the imbalance between solo and swf groups, solo queue it seems like I'm lucky to average one in ten escape rate, swf where at least two or three escape is insanely higher on the other hand.
---
When did you start playing the game? I'm not attempting to gatekeep. But the game used to be in a severely imbalanced state, with major issues. The current ones are miniscule in comparison. Still annoying, but trust me when I say these devs have really been taking care of this game.
---
I love swf. It's either challenging or super easy
---
I wouldn't say it's poor though. The game overall functions completely fine. I've only seen a couple problems here or there and even then they are specific to a certain interaction or character, such as nurse being a bit shit when compared to pc. Obviously there is work that needs to be done but again some of it goes back to the functionality of the controller vs keyboard and mouse and so on. Basically what i'm saying is it's both on them and the console limitations and people like the original poster blow it out of proportions.
---
I use the lockers to avoid his chainsaw in the first place. It takes him a second to put his chainsaw down and open the locker, so the second you see that bad boy go down, as long as he takes the 3 seconds, I think it would work.
---
Here something that will piss you off I was hillbilly

There were two survivors on a gen that was close to the shack so I smacked the first and then went for the second when I was on my way to him I heard an explosion the first guy dropped the shack pallet.

Pretty freaking rad! Really enjoyable, friend.
---
I was in a game with a killer with ruin I found a totem and when I was almost done I heard the ruin totem pop. I got a mini heart attack
---
I think I'm gonna use all three of Jake's perks and I'll also get Urban, Sabotaging all the hooks will be good for my teammates.
---
When does it start?
---
Can I have your Hassy
---
Autodidact is the perk where you get more health bonus on skillchecks. Up to 50%
---
Can confirm, 1.3 GB.
---
&gt;Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give a better environment and tools to manage disconnections and to improve hit registrations. A multidisciplinary team is working on both features
---
&gt;With dedicated servers, all players are connected to one server. If one player loses connection, everyone else will remain connected. This information will help us better identify and punish players who intentionally disconnect going forward.  
---
Can't come soon enough. Too many people treat this game like it's some sort of buffet. D/c'ing because they don't get the match they feel they're 'owed'. Now maybe they'll have to either suck it up and actually play the game as intended or face increasing punishments for taking the attitude of "Fuck everyone else, I'm going to get mine. No one else matters"
---
Why are we getting it now. The last one was at christmas? Is this a usual event for mid year?
---
Heck no, hands off the hassy
---
Yoooo, I mean I know they said "Summer 2019" but I didn't expect testing this early. I'm hyped!
---
you never have anyway
---
It's about a mentally challenged Lennie and his caretaker George tryna make some cash by getting farming jobs.
---
I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear some positive things from you guys! I was really nervous sharing my work on Reddit because it can be a pretty... critical place.
---
Really, really appreciate you checking it out and inspiring me to keep working on these! Good feels, man!
---
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve done a pretty good JOB!!!
---
The worst is when there‚Äôs a Leatherface camping you. Standing right in front of you. Not Insidious. And what do your three teammates do? They all crouch walk around the hook waiting for the moment that will never come. Then as soon as you‚Äôre sacrificed they run off to their gens. I don‚Äôt get it. If you‚Äôre not going to save then don‚Äôt stand there.
---
Side note for games with any killer: The ones that do that same thing then the second you start struggling they sprint over and unhook you. Come on guys.
---

Most people dont care about pips. Personally, I prefer losing pips over gaining them since playing at red ranks is ass.
---
I've been waiting, for 30 MINUTES!!
---
That David King outfit is fire.
---
Even with small game sometimes I never find them. I can't wait until I have totem spawns down to memory.
---
I'm going to keep the short braids/goatee head on him I think, but I'm super glad he has a casual outfit now other than just the denim set.
---
DBD needs a REAL punishment for survivors that DC. It ruins everyone else‚Äôs game
---
Damn that looks pretty cool no lie thanks for updating me
---
The solo-SWF imbalance is the biggest problem with the game. The easiest solution for it, to add in game voice chat for survivors, is something the devs refuse to do. 
---
Other fixes like making kindred, bond, and mettle of man baseline along with adding a totem counter have only been discussed never implemented.
---
Still even with all that, who DCs against low-tier killers like Doctor and Trapper?
---
You mean I've never been hit by a hatchet that hasn't even phyisically hit my body? Too many times to count. Dedicated servers should help allegiate the bullshit.
---
We‚Äôre gonna live forever coupled with Deliverance, Breakdown, and Kindred is a good combo to keep you alive and promote teammate to come save you so long as the killer isn‚Äôt camping. You can exchange Kindred for Borrowed Time, Urban Evasion or Selfcare
---
Stealing the stolen, bold
---
maybe try playing killer and observe all the hits that fly through survivors bodies
---
plAy sOMethIng ElsE
---
Thing is people will always DC because there‚Äôs absolutely 0 incentive to get to rank 1. They‚Äôd rather play the lesser players. If they had a system in place that rewards getting to rank 1 with shards or anything then you‚Äôd see a lot less DCing. But with 0 incentive to rank up, they‚Äôll DC whenever they want.
---
"god forbid the killer who has basically the easiest to hit power while still having 115% movement speed, should actually be hitting her power and not just puking on a pallet that she can force me to throw down after 10 seconds of dodging her power correctly"
---
Aw c‚Äômon cut me a break, I‚Äôm good at everything else in this game EXCEPT looping lol
---
Early may they said, either the first or second weekend of may.

Yeah, it sucks about that... so I doubt we would see him. 
---
What about the dude from the movie See No Evil?
---
Why did you give them 5 minutes at the gate?
---
Watching someone UE to you as your struggling on the hook and the killer is chasing someone else is just... I have no words.
---
I guess that makes sense cause I usually flail for the hell of now I know why no 1 saves me lol
---
Doesn't matter what you play, i get like 1/5 matches where no one DCs (not counting people who get kicked out of the game before it starts), survivor or killer side, doesn't matter. I really wish the devs at least implement a matchmaking cooldown for people who DC.
---
"Please roast me". Respect.
---
he said "plag" instead of "plague" in one of his vids.
---
save up your streamers and cakes and puddings,always run bbq.
---
I play him specifically to put people in the basement. Antagonizing you and taking advantage of your altruism is a completely legitimate strategy. You gotta be braindead not to realize what's going on and just counter play it.
---
Travelocity Gnome takes you places you want to go, Clown takes you to the nearest hook :(
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Nurse blink hits not to count towards Mettle of Man hits.
---
Oh boy.
---
Was hoping they‚Äôd update more perks, happy about all of the changes though. Don‚Äôt understand what changed about wglf tho.
---
Well... rip endgame pig..
---
&gt; the killer who has basically the easiest to hit power
---
lmao it's like you just plugged your ears so that you can scream your mantra. Again, actually try playing her. And fucking lol at crying about Vile Purge, an ability that does nothing but give the killer one minute of buggy projectile at some point in the match or will injure the survivor after 45 seconds
---
lmfao
---
&gt;Feature - Games that would start with less than 5 players are canceled, and all players still connected to the server will be returned to the tally screen (keeping their items, add-ons and offerings) and notified about the cancellation.
---
I BELIEVE THAT THE HOT DOGS, GO OOOOOOOOOOOOOON
---
Note that it will only be tested in two days from now on the PTB.
---
you see scratchmarks leading to the basement when someone is hooked you go of course there are people there
---
Nurse F tier
---
Fuck yes games will be cancelled if everyone doesn't join in. Best change by far.
---
I was the hag, i don‚Äôt enjoy trapper. He really needs a buff
---
Always.
---
What the fuck? They actually nerfed WGLF. They could at least add some more ways of gaining stacks for it if they're gonna be like that. It's already hard enough to get 4 stacks. And they should add another effect to the perk to make it actually do something useful.
---
I can't say it doesn't happen because I've seen it and it's just as bullshit. But I've seen way too many hatchets hit a wall beside me or fly 3 feet over my head an I still get injured to count.
---
No Oceania servers? Rip Aussie / NZ players.
---
I know I was just being stupid lmao. Both of their traps always fuck me up
---
&gt;Was hoping they‚Äôd update more perks, happy about all of the changes though. Don‚Äôt understand what changed about wglf tho.
---
Probably the safe rescue bit. Currently you can farm teammates and still get your stacks.
---
Pig nerf is unreal. One of my favorite killers with an already somewhat underwhelming power just became more useless than frenzy. How are you going to allow leaving the gate, not tick the timer in radius AND not guarantee traps to start at the collapse. That's just unacceptable.
---
Honestly, they could at least handle stuff like that in the same way as Warframe or Crossout. Basically give some way of getting it other than wasting your money on overpriced shit.
---
I was REALLY hoping for a complete rework of Left Behind. Its even more useless now because the second you are the last survivor, the killer will try to find the hatch to close it. You'll get to work on a gen for maybe 30 seconds before the killer slams that sucker shut and completely prevents you from working on gens.
---
Pretty disappointing.
---
&gt;The RBT timer now stops if the Survivor is within the Terror Radius, as opposed to when in a Chase. RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate.¬†
---
Thank you devs, for these much needed and much requested ~~nerfs~~ changes :/
---
You right! I forget what the pebble perk is then tooüòÇ
---
One of the weakest killers? Better nerf ~~Greninja~~ Pig!
---
And Remember Me while we're at it! It was way too good of a perk already, and it belonged to Freddy who's also way too good so it makes sense.
---
Oh that‚Äôs a good change honestly
---
I get the -5 every game, because you need to stay around the hook for some time because i play hag. And traps need to be in place. Less so with killers like doctor
---
When I try to sneak around I usually use a perk which tells me whether my location is safe or not like Alert or Premonition. I find them more consistently useful than the pebble. (The pebble can be fun though)
---
Before it was just any unhook would give you a stack. Now it has to be a safe unhook so you can't just farm your team for stacks.
---
Now I'm just thinking about a distraught Dwight desperately vaulting the pallet trying to get his item back.
---
I run legion with bbq, distressing, thanataphobia, beast of prey. Or doctor with bbq, distressing, unnerving, sloppy
---
Why would they buff the door opening time and nerf Remember Me? Now it's going to be even easier to get doors open. Wth, BHVR?
---
With the hag you need to place traps around the hook, that ussually takes like 10-20 seconds. Multiple hooks gets you that percentage almost always
---
&gt; Adjusted controller joystick inputs to allow for better movement control.
---
nut
---
What a lump of humpadoo
---
Behaviour, take a note from Riot Games. You're supposed to release the cool Legion skins *before* the nerfs!
---
no you didn't
---
They actually just nerfed the Pig.
---
Yeah, seriously, her ability is literally useless once the gens are done now... Doing a RBT after all gens were done applied pressure
---
It never fails to tickle me seeing the killer bug section and the survivor one not even being there. I guess survivor kind of fits into the perk section but I‚Äôve still to see a fix for DH and it‚Äôs just to tiring.
---
Everything about these perks hurt
---
If the gates are open you may camp imo, i don‚Äôt but if you do, they should just use that gate
---
Why do you need to place more then 1 trap?
---
Yay! So now only the Huntress will be able to throw hatchets! I was getting tired of the other killers from hitting me from half a mile away sometimes (always the red connection killers).
---
Nope, really not. Pig traps aren‚Äôt meant to secure a kill, nor should you be relying on them for that. They‚Äôre meant to waste survivor‚Äôs times with the boxes and once in a while result in a kill. She‚Äôs a stalling killer, that‚Äôs her job
---
The ones who want to be chased are my favorite. Especially when they go down  seconds after clicking their flashlight. I'm like you wanted this, why DC?
---
You don‚Äôt place it under the hook, to obvious. Place 2-3 to some paths leading to it
---
Maybe try playing Survivor and observe all the hatchets that fly ten feet away from you yet still affect you
---
I'm not crying. There's no way they can top the crisp n clean outfit you get with her DLC so I'm fine with them not trying
---
Pig nerf is digusting no argument for it beyond stupid
---
Hmm, yes, I would like a number 3 with 2 pips please.
---
Requiring safe saves isn't really a nerf, but a QoL change....
---
Ok, but like what is the point of working on gens when the hatch has already spawned and you're the last survivor? What an absolute garbage perk. They should give the perk some effect to give you an advantage over the killer if you are the last survivor standing instead.
---
Literally busted in it's current state and has no counterplay with the right build, even a half decent legion with the proper setup can easily 4k. The nerf will change that, thankfully.
---
My two favourite killers getting nerfed. Sad times.
---
Granted I love what they've done with Legion's pins and I can deal with most of what they've done to them, I just don't like how heavily they've come down on Feral Frenzy- it's the thing that made the character unique after all.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Except now traps don't initiate at end game and the time stress to take the trap off isn't as bad (it already wasn't bad to begin with). They went from "Gotta get these off so I don't die" to "Ehh, this can wait"
---
Petition to replace the basement's ambient music with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czTksCF6X8Y)
---
Fair enough
---
Wrong use of meme
---
It happens. I sometimes step in a trap which i could see getting placed. It happens lol
---
Seems like a good patch but why did they do that to pig? Lmao
---
I think it's already out on the PTB
---
Firing up the old PS2 for some classic Socom 2 &amp; 3! It runs way better than this game!
---
Do you play on PC? Also what exactly do you mean by Farm rate?
---
Should've just been that if the rescue was safe you'd get another token
---
I'm just glad that I don't get farmed to death off hook now by Davids.
---
Not even to 'this can wait' but 'why did you bother?'
---
I'm just confused about the point of the traps during the end game. How can they become active if all the gens are blocked?
---
Welp, time to main my old man Jake again. Back to the roots
---
Is there a survey of the playrate for each killer (i.e what percentage of games have Trapper) ?
---
Thats what I try to do, I definitively need more
---
Practice tho
---
Doctor is pretty weak, used to play him a lot with the old bloodhunts but I just get stomped. Legion might be viable if the bloodhunt is before the mid chapter patch with his changes.
---
Or they don‚Äôt wanna waste sprint burst.
---

Why the HELL would they nerf the Pig like that??? Amanda...I'm sorry they did this to you :,(
---
2 killers became useless in this patch. Gate time reduced. Hatch always open for last survivor, even if they did no gens. Rewards stupidity.
---
Were there any killer buffs? Nope. Feels like survivor mains have no reason to complain now.
---
Mommy, Daddy, what's a pip?
---
Yeah i just need to get blood warden someway! But ive had it done to me its pretty efficient
---
it was changed to deal with the new end game collapse 
---
her power would be overpowered if you had a trap on your head at end game since not being able to leave until you get it off might take up your entire time limit to escape
---
from both sides, because killers need the "i didnt teabag, i didnt flashlight" prefix.
---
I play a lot of survivor. This is like one of two games I play so I gotta mix it up. This is how I know ya'll lie
---
Literally me with Micheal Myers breathing behind me.
---
Did it for daddy üòçüòç
---
That's oddly specific and not really what I was talking about. 
---
Stealthing behind a rock is a terrible strategy. If caught, it's a guaranteed free chainsaw for the killer since you weren't in good positioning for looping.  If not caught, you're shifting the aggro back onto your teammates who might not be able to afford it.
---
Yeah listen to them. Do the Gens, not the Totem. Very right, do that! And best, you do it, when you play against meü•≥
---
Hey Bing Bong Boi, when is the next Hookers meeting?
---
I honestly laughed reading it.
---
solution
---
raise awareness and make people actually cleanse totems they come across
---
THEY'VE KILLED PIGGY
---
WHY DO THIS
---
He‚Äôs not a sweat is what he means
---
Good point. Some kind of consequences need to come from DCing though.
---
Well if your great insighful comments wouldn't change my mind I'm sure your downvoting will, holy shit what a passive agressive POS, don't talk to me again I already knew you we're an asshole but I decided to give you the time of day anyways, shocker that you provide 0 arguments and downvote the other person for their opinion, do me a favor and kys.
---
so bullshit hits are myth but bullshit misses are real?
---
bruh
---
&gt; Wraith is 115%, and yet, he is known for eating pallets all day.
---
Enduring&lt;3
---
&gt;Doctor is 115%, yet is only good when you 3-gen on him, because he can't down quickly.
---
You've never went up against a god tier doc then; they can deny windows and pallets with their stun if you time it exceptionally well. 3 gen is a meme and isn't even efficient points-wise.
---
&gt; Clown is 115%, but can't get more than 2 kills because he is too slow.
---
He's strong at chases but aint got much to create momentum based scenarios. Strong denial/ map control during a chase.
---
&gt;Leatherface is 115%, but is a killer red ranks love to bully.
---
M1 leatherface is not bad, but he's bullied because he's a Billy without the utility of map control and an overcommitted chainsaw animation. The thing about leatherface is that he's played by killers trying to unlock BBQ&amp;C (semi-newbies) and he's a chainsaw killer... Chainsaw killers have a ton of ways to juke them. He's definitely still nearly as strong as Billy against bad survivors. It's the good survivors that can shit on him.
---
&gt;Mikey's Tier 3, Hillbilly, Plague, and Pig
---
New Legion is essentially perma T3 myers is you don't heal against him. And how do you count Pig as a *good* 115% killer? I feel like Pig is the prime "rank 11 champion" killer. An M1 killer until the first down. The sneaking and ambush stuff doesn't work on good players.
---
You are an angel
---
b-but you just said if you enjoy him you‚Äôre braindead
---
Shut up, frank
---
Seriously? Left Behind is still useless even after we all had to tell you several times why it is useless and why it will be even more when EGC drops? And why is Pig being nerfed?  Really Devs? What are you guys thinking?
---
Neato
---
if killer DC, Nea becomes the killer instead
---
The pig change is terrible when it comes to the exit gate.
---
Was nerfing Pig really necessary??? She‚Äôs already a low tier killer
---
Obviously that makes sense with the new collapse but making the timer based on radius and not chase is a terrible change because a survivor can just hover you and have no stress. It takes any urgency away from the traps.
---
yes :)
---
My killer main just got nerfed. Wow. Sad oink
---
Imagine facecamping at 5 gens
---
lmfao imagine being this fucking mad about a video game
---
*peace.
---
As long as they bring the beer!
---
Yeah I really need to try doctor! Ill do that today thanks man!
---
Just why did she and Remember Me need a nerf? Why? I'm seriously questioning the devs here.
---
This is just amazing! Please never die, DBD.
---
unfortunatly not but I could work on that when the other one is done.
---
People say Doc is the point farming killer, but if your games last 15+ minutes it's not really that efficient if you think about it.
---
5 minute 25k games as billy or nurse vs 20 minute 32k doc game?
---
What do you mean they nerfed her?
---
I will explain it more in the survey and yes I am PC.
---
I was waiting for your post about this.
---
LOGICAL...
---
you are funny
---
kinda
---
Really i dont moan much but this change is beyond dumb. It kills her power, survivors were not dying from traps at a high level
---
Yeah I want to try nurse but she seems really hard, I already have ruin through the shrine
---
A Resilience effect if you're the last survivor maybe? ALL action speeds up as the last survivor? 
---
I think its situational enough that you could stuff the effects of several perks in to it as long as the activation requirement remains "must be the last survivor standing", though thematically thats more of a Laurie perk than a Bill perk. I don't think it would be too much to have miniature versions of Wake Up, Resilience, Hope, Lightweight, Technician, etc. Obviously not all of them but subdued versions of 2-3 of the lesser used super situational perks like that would be nice.
---
They made her RBT useless.
---
Leaving the upvotes at 69 because reasons
---
Why the pig nerf? Literally all they needed to do was make the EGC timer slow down if someone's wearing a trap if they're worried she'd be too strong. I feel attack both Legion and Pig were my mains DX
---
Wait how!? I‚Äôm a pig main and I don‚Äôt want to get bullied every match please tell me what did they do
---
***The Pig***
---
* RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. \*NOTE:¬†Initiating the End Game Collapse will not complete generators, but will block them. This means that any inactive RBTs will remain inactive.
---
* **The RBT timer now stops if the Survivor is within the Terror Radius, as opposed to when in a Chase.**
---
I'm wondering why tf they nerfed it and buffed doors. It's totally not like doors are easy as fuck to open or anything.... /s.
---
Insert Oprah Meme: You get a nerf, you get a nerf... Everybody gets a nerf!
---
They can't. Have fun I guess.
---
I think I was in your game lol 2 people dc as they get hit and I'm like why wtf are you doing I cant use deliverance now...
---
Tbagging isn‚Äôt a strategy like camping or tunneling, it‚Äôs just trying to be mean
---
*darth Vader noooooooooo* why the hell would they do that, she was game as she was
---
RBT time no longer goes down in chases. 
---
End game collapse doesn‚Äôt activate the RBT. 
---
And if I‚Äôm not mistaken, you can leave with a bear trap on your head now.
---
Well too late now.
---
Just gotta wing it and hope they don't all sprint burst into each other at once and cause a nuclear explosion.
---
Yeah it's kinda weird they changed it. I assume they must've play tested a lot of endgame perks for the collapse and thought it was too strong?
---
&gt; The easiest solution for it, to add in game voice chat for survivors, is something the devs refuse to do.
---
I am glad for that. I probably would quit if they added it.
---
Not only because people would get really annoyed and pissed off and vent on voice chat but it would also completely change the game. Killers wouldn't be able to jumpscare you anymore, you would constantly know if the killer is chasing somebody etc. I actually like the uncoordinated nature of the game as a solo survivor.
---
I would be fine with having kindred (or a weakned version of kindred) as a baseline though.
---
[It's right there, mate](https://imgur.com/a/WcqzqMd)
---
I almost never play Billy and got loaded into Lery's for my ritual with him last week and immediately lost hope. I proceeded to 4K...I have no idea how.
---
IKR? They buffed the numbers but that doesn't change how useless the perk is now when it was already useless.
---
It was.
---
What's the point of reposting a meme if you're only going to make it worse?
---
I cannot wait to buy this.
---
Will Bunny Feng ever come out?
---
YOU UTTER FOOL!
---
Nobody is talking about how they nerfed coldwind. 
---
It‚Äôs not in patch notes for whatever reason, but the walls are much harder to see through now. Poggers.
---
Imagine if pig could Sky Star with SWORDTRICK, ot would be cool af man
---
i feel like they dislike me or something.
---
Wraith got a certain animation back. He‚Äôs S-tier now!
---
Not sure what the logic was behind shortening the gate time overall, as opposed to only shortening it in the 1 v 1 scenario when the the hatch is closed. The latter is where the change would actually be needed.
---
WOW. I thought they were gonna buff her. Yikes
---
Wait. Removed hatch grabs!?!?
---
No no. You put those back in.
---
Jokes aside a fursuit costume for either a Survivor or a Killer would be hilarious. I'd unironically run around in a neon blue bunny costume akin to the mascots in Saints Row The Third.
---
Screw BHVR I love this game but they keep ruining it, pig was the only killer I really enjoyed playing
---
I feel ike they butchered everything that gave me joy. Exept Legion I am fine with that change.
---
Who the fuck was asking for pig nerfs??
---
It is a nerf to RBT kills but it also gives Piggy free **Whispers**.
---
If you notice the clock for someone with an active RBT suddenly isn't ticking, it means that person is near you.
---
How do you correct for people with legitimate reasons to DC? Like they get a glitch, they get disconnected due to latency or some real life issue comes up? What about Killers that are throwing games, no one would DC in a game that is being thrown even if the Killer was one they would DC against.   
---
There are a lot of discrepancies which I find make this a pretty useless bit of statistical information. Your data gathering is flawed. It would make more sense if you recreated the same static parameters in a match, such as ping, then ran through those similar situations over and over again seeing how many people DC'd.  
---
For instance; I have had more than a few Pig matches where more than 2 people disconnected. I can think of 3 off the top of my head. Based off my calculations that means the Pig has a 50% disconnect rate. I used the exact same measuring system as you but my numbers are quite a bit different already. Even if I played 97 more matches I still would have higher DCs than you.
---
So we will no longer be able to watch a Survivor with RBTR die :(
---
I run Doctor with BBQ, Unnerving, Distressing (+100% deviousness, which you get by shocking), and Overcharge. The games last a while, especially if you can 3-gen, and you have plenty of chases. Put an increased range shocker on there, Iridescent King if you've got it, or Calm/Order. The BP are sickening even in subpar games, so it's easy to keep him rolling while tossing 25-75% at another toon.
---
No. This game is broken. There's more important things than custom Morris right now.
---
I don't care for that! They took something completely useless and somehow managed to kill it even more. Like yeah the traps stalled time but this is just bullying.
---
they nerfed wglf so people try to safe unhook instead of farming.
---
The Pig change is interesting. It might actually scare some survivors away from completing gens and might slow the game down.
---
Thank you 2. Now pls go make a post or 2 like me on why the Pig changes are BS.
---
Tunnelling does exist though, and so do camping killers
---
lmao say more schoolyard shit i love it
---
Can you show me the 300 matches you played against the Pig which were all the same ping?
---
I like this change, it's kind of bullshit that the best killer in the game just automatically counters one of the few remaining powerful survivor perks.
---
Your replies are cringe, why post this.
---
Hatch grabs had to go or there would still be hatch standoffs if the killer wants to.
---
Now it is just a race who can get to the hatch first.
---
where is the dude that posts it in the comments? Cant open forums at work
---
thank fucking god if true, jesus christ
---
Yeah imagine 4 people running it, it‚Äôs impossible for each person to get the full benefit of the perk unless you‚Äôre farming.
---
The timer only starts if the exit gates are open. Concerning the hatch, they could've just made the perk not affect it in that scenario. Simple.
---
Whoever is on the balance team of BHVR needs to be removed. The game is improving the technical end but is just as badly balanced as ever.
---
Ok I can kinda come to terms with RBT not activating in exit gates anymore but pausing in terror radius? Why? Why did they need to change that? She was literally just buffed and that buff still didn‚Äôt make her top tier or anything. What a weird unnecessary nerf.
---
How so?
---
Not all the same ping, but if someone has like red ping or worse and they DC on a random moment I can make sure to either count or not count it also I put great time into this, it would be nice if you could trust me.
---
Because WGLF encourages desperate farming of teammates that severely hampers gameplay. No survivor wants to go down 1-10 seconds after being unhooked because someone else wanted a small bloodpoint boost.
---
I love playing Hag and putting all 10 traps strategically around the hatch. I don't even care about stopping the survivor from taking the hatch, I just like to see a whole party of Hags pop up around them.
---
Man, that's what they said last time they were gonna rework freddy...
---
Oh it‚Äôs definitely true. 
---
They look awful now but it‚Äôs amazing.
---
That or half the amount of boxes that need to be searched during EGC. Just entity block or not highlight 2 boxes that don't have the key. Increase the odds for the survivor to getting the trap off, while still giving some form of pressure.
---
Omg did they increase sensitivity for controllers, or am I reading that wrong?
---
It's not a "change" it was always a known bug
---
&gt; one of the few remaining powerful survivor perks.
---
lol
---
But you can close the hatch now. Thats the trade off
---
Diversion
---
&gt;We're Gonna Live Forever: Each time you perform a Safe Hook Rescue or take a hit to protect a Survivor, gain 25% stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of 50/75/100%.
---
How is this different than how the perk already worked?
---
Yeah, the RBT nerf is very unnecessary. The terror radius thing, fine but the trap going off at the gate was a fun mechanic I feel like.
---
If it is not a 1 on 1 situation then there should be enough time to get the trap off and escape since the 3 minute timer only starts when a gate is actually opened.
---
The trade off is that closing it powers the exit gates.
---
I read the ptb notes.
---
So much why. Not just with pig.
---
Why can killers open gates.
---
Why was remember me nerfed.
---
Why does the end game timer slow when the killer is doing well.
---
Why can survivors open gates faster.
---
I‚Äôll have 2 number 9‚Äôs a number 9 large, number 6 with extra dip, 2 45‚Äôs and a large soda
---
Sorry if that offended you, I just hate that reasoning. Cheers
---
As a P3 Claudette main  please spread that same message for us, cause they seriously judge us everyday lol.
---
‚ÄúNo complaint questions‚Äù
---
No it‚Äôs fine
---
Really unnecessary RBT nerf, just make the timer slower when the collapse happen, there's no more pig pressure during the EGC. Not dying when going passed the exit gates are ultra ridiculous.
---
Ooomph those pig changes are rough.
---
How though lol if I have a rbt on me and I see the pig chasing someone nearby, I get extra time because I'm in the pig's terror radius. It literally removes the intended stress of having a rbt on you.
---
So your telling me that I now have to place my RBTS before the last generator pops to make it effective? I might as well use Rule 2 to make it harder to find the toture boxes until the last gen pops.
---
Sweet, but like RIP the people who live in Texas or somethin.
---
BHVR hired the Riot team to fix their game.
---
So. Many. Nerfs.
---
The previous January update was a nerf too, basically removing her ambush ability. Less time to do grabs because of just 3 secs to unfade, and due to higher terror radius you have to go into crouch mode way earlier to successfully ambush the survivor.
---
And now they nerf her other ability too.
---
RIP.
---
Good.
---
The first two are pretty bad ngl, but the third perk is not bad. I like the little flavor text you wrote with each one too
---
Imagine if you used borrowed time.  This is a necessary change, stop farming your teammates.
---
No, that's the Nurse. (Ba-dum, tss!)
---
He's a troll, don't give him any attention
---
tf are you tapping in 2019?
---
You're probably right. They should have at least made the timer notably shorter to counter it.
---
People like this make this community as toxic as it is, orange just needs to get a grip.
---
Some balancing idiot clearly equalled borrowed time timer with reverse bear trap timer even though the bear trap takes over 2 minutes to work
---
They did say next month. Lets hope he wont be nerfed again somehow.
---
Oof my bad
---
Those arms can carry me to heaven and back ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
So does ruin
---
She will actually still be able to watch if she crouches.
---
Oh yeah that's a good point. Maybe it's something to do with the killer closing the hatch on the last survivor to start the collapse and if it's a 50 second timer there's no way you're gonna get away. Idk that's the only reason I can see why they'd nerf remember me.
---
I understand they want to be consistent with mechanics, and that's why they nerfed pig, but I literally never see pigs "moonwalking" to get a kill.
---
I'd be more okay with it if they gave her some minor buffs, as opposed to making it more difficult to get kills as her.
---
Box Defending Piggy is horrifying.
---
Survivors can‚Äôt get moried in your terror radius
---
This is just a toxic ramble, get a grip. Honestly, the legion rework isn‚Äôt great but it‚Äôs getting rid of a painful killer to play against
---
Im hoping as its a ptb a lot will be reverted tbh, the reactions already been quite extreme even for this community
---
Hahah nice one
---
What did they do?
---
As a Pig you don't see the clock ticking down. Only survivors can see it.
---
They really nerfed Pig and Remember Me. Huh.
---
Yes, Enduring is meta. Your point? 
---
Doc mains constantly tell me that there is little point in trying to shock someone out of dropping a pallet. You are slower in treatment mode, so they just get an extra loop unless you are literally on top of them, and at that point, why not just swing? 3 gen gets you DCs and kills. Which Doc gets neither of without.
---
I don't care if low ranks think Leatherface is good.
---
That's why people are GOING to heal against him. Why wouldn't you? Before, there was no point because he couldn't catch you without using Feral anyway (basically meaning, anyone without deep wounds was full health.) 
---
Pig isn't good because of sneaking. Pig is good because she can mindgame the hell out of pallets. Ardetha is pretty good at it.
---
A lot of people complain about characters not getting into Smash. Even past our obvious WAH, characters like Rayman, Bomberman, and other IP's owned or related to Nintendo, all the way to the fandom characters like Goku, to the meme/9 year old characters like Freddy Fazbear and Shrek. In a game like Smash, people will always complain about roster choices.
---
Interesting insight.
---
WTF Pig nerf :(
---
Nothing was changed about the Legion or Plague during PTB.
---
I don't get why the devs nerf pig... If anything she needs a buff to her traps and her crouch/ambush ability.
---
Welp my comment is the one in red... I regretted responding as they‚Äôre clearly a troll.
---
You'll have to be good with Nurse or Billy though. Billy isn't *that* hard but Nurse can take some time.
---
* **The RBT timer now stops if the Survivor is within the Terror Radius, as opposed to when in a Chase.**  
---
All patch notes can be found on the front page
---
Added the word: safe
---
As if I'm worrying about legion, I'm worrying about pig. Keep up with the times man.
---
well bits were but no one really had an issue with them overall
---
Calm spirit hides all type of scream. This means screams after a healing failed skill check?
---
That's such an easy 120000 though
---
okay so i guess let's juts fuck over all the fair players then yay always down for changes that decease already terrible killer variety good shit
---
Trapper is one of the few I think is balanced properly for solo queue, survivors actually stand a decent chance at escape. I'm more surprised that the DC rate for the shape isn't much higher, every myers I seem to run into tunnels and then camps, one of the least fun to play against imo. It doesn't help with the teachable abilities across killers either, especially now with everyone getting BBQ from shrine if they didn't already have it, things are just going to be more busted than ever.
---
Yeah she was already weak so why buff her?
---
it be like that sometimes
---
It's probably done to not make it unfair when one gate is open and the killer is there waiting for survivors that want to escape while NOED is active. There'll be less chance the entity claims someone still trying to open the gate because RM slows it down so much.
---
I get your pain though dude. It‚Äôs rough.
---
Why‚Äôd you remove it
---
First game on the PTB and it put me into an infinite loading screen for 5+ minutes. Nice.
---
Imagine this guy not getting his ass kicked at any bar he ever visits, good thing you only hang out with chicks as the non-threatening gay guy who already knows his place.
---
NO not even the terror radius. Stop nerfing things that are uselss. Its like increasing time to fall asleep or decreasing amount of madness when shocked. It shouldn't be in the game. I like that you are on my side tho.
---
Is there a reason behind this? Remember me feels numerically like a waste of a perk.
---
*who cares about dumb old Texas*
---
Do we have a release date for mid chapter?
---
Oop, be careful saying that. Did anyone tell you that all survivors are toxic and the only problem of the Dead by Daylight community?
---
Ah... I thought it was to farm more bloodpoints.
---
I guess I misunderstood the intention behind camping.
---
Also thank you for being so respectful.
---
In a way... ~~having the timers stop as soon as you are in her TR has basically given her a visual queue version of whispers... unless they remove her ability to see the timer being red or white.~~
---
Nvm, forget I said anything, I was never HERE!
---
Yeah gotta agree, as a pig main since the killers release, this update is quite literally the worst since flashlights and pallets could work on a killer mid-pickup-animation. This shit is literally unnecessary and I've yet to meet a survivor who disagrees with me.  
---
Hope BHVR gets off the crack they're smoking for these nerfs in particular.
---
*Sad Oink*
---
Safe hook requirement
---
Free broken status. And zero stealth abilities once youve been vomitted on.
---
And you mean to say that NO ONE had issues with legion? I know hes cool and fun, but if he tunnels you, you arent getting away.
---
You know, I was as much of a fan of Legion like everyon else (ahem, you kbow what I mean), but the only good buff he got was the 115% movement speed, which is amazing. I was strongly advocating for his speed to be increased when he was first launched.
---
But...
---
Nerf after nerf after nerd after nerf...
---
Bleedout timer only drains ehile in TR (this is nice actually, it gives the survivors more of a chance to hide from him!)
---
Only can use power if fully charged (so like spirit huh?)
---
Loses power completely after a missed attack (um... ok that's enough)
---
Lower speed while using power (why?)
---
Increased power recovery (but he already loses it if he misses, so why??)
---
Increased stun time (stop)
---
Cannot see blood while in frenzy along with scratches (stoooppp)
---
Increased time on pallets and windows (STOP)
---
Increased time of...
---
I can't remember them all from the patch notes and I will be logging on to try Legion myself. However, reading all these nerfs for this specific killer was really uncomfortable. It seems like they are actively gutting out the killer's ability, and they are so afraid for any future exploits to happen that they are going overboard to weakening his power. When I was reading the nerfs, I imagined BHVR saying, "HEY GUYS, YALL HATE LEGION RIGHT??? WELL HE CAN'T DO THIS NOW! AND WE INCREASED HIS RECOVERY!! AND YOU CAN MESS AROUND HIM EVEN MORE SO HE CAN GET PUNISHED FOR SCREWING UP!! HEY GUYS, WE MAKING HIM WEAKER JUST FOR YOU GUYSSS!!! :^)"
---
"Imma beat this mothafucka with anotha mothafuck"
---
when legion misses an attack they get stunned for 17 seconds and stabs themself the entire time
---
But it removes pigs map pressure, having a shit version of whispers
---
If the Doctor is in treatment mode for more than 10 seconds he himself reaches tier 3 madness, has a nervous breakdown, opens the exit gates and flees.
---
This trial's getting cuh-razy!
---
You dont need to use a killer to level them up. Just have to spend bloodpoints on them.
---
Freddy - useless
---
Pig (after 2.7.0) - useless
---
Legion (after 2.7.0) - useless
---
I think it's just one, the second image is showing the OP deleting the daily

&gt;HITBOXES &amp; DISCONNECTION HANDLING   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We know that hit registration and disconnection handling are two of our top issues and we are actively working on those. Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give a better environment and tools to manage disconnections and to improve hit registrations. A multidisciplinary team is working on both features, but they will not be ready for the launch.¬†More information will be released in the next Dev Update.¬†
---
&gt;You see the symbol but not the clock. Only survivors can see the time remaining on her traps.
---
I know you don't see the exact timer but you see when the clock is ticking.
---
lmfao this is straight up 1950s homophobia. do you also beat your wife?
---
i agree it won't have a huge impact it is just SO unnececarry(I know I misspelled) like just STOP BHVR.
---
I guess the idea behind this is with closing the hatch you could create a stalemate by trapping the last survivor and then *if* you happen to see them check all but one box then you can camp the last box. Then a stalemate is created where the survivor can't get the trap off and have to wait until the entity kills them.
---
But the fix for that rare inconsistent issue isn't to remove the strong point of a killers power. BHVR should have taken the time to instead figure out an actual solution to this issue. Off the top of my head they could make it so in EGC when you are the only remaining survivor the boxes teleport every minute (or when the Pig stays too close for too long.) Obviously not a great fix but it's the first to come to mind.
---
Welcome to DBD.
---
Some people need to remember this is for the PTB. The last PTB had changes that were changed again when it went live for everyone. 
---
I'm a developer, and I have to make changes to software all the time. If people complain about things based on patch notes without actually trying things, they usually get ignored. You might be surprised about how you feel afterwards, or your initial impressions may be correct, but an opinion without experience is just noise.
---
Play the PTB, give proper, constructive feedback after you've had a chance to play, and recommend things that would make your experience better.
---
Ahahaha, Legion "update" claims and nerfs another already weak killer. End game collapse doubles down and needs that same killer again. No compensation either. RIP in pieces Amanda.
---
Ah, yeah that is true. You are right then.
---
Gotta say, I hope BHVR fires whoever made this decision, tired of seeing random shit like this happen, it's like every update with these guys.  
---
The changes to pallets and flashlights way back when you could stun a killer mid pickup animation..it's basically the same kind of update but instead gimps one of the most popular/fun killers to vs and play as.
---
Was she about to start sucking some dick?
---
okay but at this point the devs pretty much have it set up as a free escape for the last survivor which i really fuckin hate and this is just helping that nonsense
---
From what I saw he did a quick goodbye video then almost immediately deleted his YouTube channel. I don't want to be that guy but that sounds like some suicidal symptoms. Probably taking that too far but yeah.
---
Wait, if killers DC on dedicated servers, the survivors just finish the match sans killer?
---
Lol I never get more people telling me to kill myself than when I play doctor and bubba. I play doctor because with that perk that caps deviousness + BBQ Chilli  and Thrill of the hunt I think? He makes for a killer farm machine. I never run a full cancer set up on him I prefer playing Franklin's hag to be annoying. Leatherface people just let him get to close and one shot them. Then they beg for an unsafe hook 5 seconds after he leaves and get mad when he turns around 1 shotting both of them. PM after the match calling him a camper. Bubba I play 70% to hear him squeal and have probably let hundreds of survivors escape that I could have hammered but wanted to squeal run chainsaw kill. Camping bubba is quiet and boring.
---
New Killer: **The Senate**
---
So about that Freddy rework...
---
Who am I kidding the devs can‚Äôt keep up with the content changes, there is just too much content and not enough balancing to go around. What DbD needs is a sequel, a freshly coded game that‚Äôs easy to work with, or they need to commit big time resources to a massive perk/map overhaul with a good portion of the killers getting reworked/fixed. 
---
But such a update doesn‚Äôt seem possible based on these little updates.
---
Only during the collapse. So say three perps down and hatch spawns. If lone ped jumps can still grab but if gates are powered and hatch spawns no
---
Are you sure? It‚Äôs not in the patchnotes...
---
the survivors have the ability to put the doctor in a straight jacket for the entire match and teabag him
---
I think you need a /s
---
Aside from subscribing to the channel (I feel so dirty when I say that haha) I'll see what I can do to post them. I'll ask the mods of the community if they have any suggestions. I definitely, definitely want to respect the rules and not spam you guys. 
---
I suppose I could also start my own subreddit. I'll see what I can come up with to try and make the content come to you guys without being annoying.
---
Hit them.
---
Mindgame 100
---
Nah The Entity is that blonde woman from that crazy show
---
So they killed Legion and Pig ( the both will be now low tier killers ), they buffed Mettle of Man ( now it counts towards Nurse's Blinks hits ), they nerfed Remember Me ( not a great perk before, now it's just bad ) and Left Behind is still useless AF.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
You don't.
---
Need US North US South and Oceania and you‚Äôve got it perfect
---
Runs Paintbrush and Monitor on Freddy *taps head*
---
Probably it will be like before but survivors keep their points and their items. But duh everything is a possibility
---
Try getting closer, I heard it helps!
---
If they keep in the hatch grab then hatch standoffs will not go away. I rather have it go away. Whoever finds it first wins basically.
---
D/Cs are always more common on the PTB in my experience. There are even less consequences to D/C on the PTB than on live.
---
The game has been almost unplayable since the new rank system
---
Let a buddy play on my account to get a taste for the game. I'm rank 10, not very advanced, but not new player levels either. All he did was crouch and hide in lockers, got some harsh hate mail on that one.
---
Aaaaand she was robbed JUST like shangie.
---
Pig was bad, now she's dead
---
I knew it. Also rip Russian players from Siberia (like me). 6000km to Frankfurt server (I guess this one would have the most playerbase in Europe) or 3800km to Seoul server (I have a feeling it will be much emptier). Goodbye to green ping games with your neighbors, it was nice while it lasted.
---
Players: everyone is tired of billys and nurses in red ranks we need more good killers
---
Devs:hey lets fuck the pig lmao
---
You can also get protection hits. Two unhooks and two hits and you're set.
---
Why are you crouching at the other end of the map when the killer is camping me.
---
You can also get them by body blocking. Its not \*just\* hook saves
---
I knew you were going to be upset about this. so much for rules set no. 2 in base kit huh? lol yeah i love using piggy, especially end game piggy. Very bad nerf. I know it's not super easy to be in TR without being noticed but it can stop your timer whenever you need it to. My other complaint is the trap not activating doesn't seem to hold true to the license. 
---
"I, jigsaw, bless you with this helmet that will most likely never go off!"
---
How is Freddy so low?
---
If you think Pigs Main-Power is the RBTs, you gonna have a baaaad time.
---
...why not just make one of the jigsaw boxes hold a dull key when the collapse is triggered? I mean it'd take more time to code, but...
---
Fixed an issue that made pig somewhat good
---
It really should just be Fire Up for Survivors. Based on other dead survivors instead of Gen completion.
---
There should be more ways to get WGLF stacks anyways. Pickung up a survivor from the ground, healing someone to full etc.
---
it's honestly hilarious how unhinged you all are over legion to the point you think this post was about that
---
if you are a pig main and rely on end-game kills with RBTs, you are... well, bad.
---
Play nurse
---
I wrote it that way because literally every 2nd comment on face is about fixing the game.Dont get me wrong,I want fixes too,but I unterstand the difference between dev teams
---
Then I hope they can stay hidden until I die, I'm gonna make them work for it.
---
People are forgetting the fact that the Pig has no terror radius when crouched..
---
Whats Illigal?
---
what‚Äôs ptb ?
---
Honestly, I'm sick of the whole 'killer victim, survivor bully' nonsense this whole entire subreddit spouts. It's so annoying to come across the same shit about teabagging, stupid complaints about not getting 4Ks, etc. etc.
---
hol up what the fuck
---
BHVR, look at what you've done to poor GlenOck. You monsters.
---
Ruin can win games if the survivors can‚Äôt find it and you keep map pressure. In my opinion I can be a great perk to snowball at best and gone in 15 seconds at worst.
---
She atleast still has pallet mindgames and mid game delay but this change wasted a huge amount of potential.
---
so many times i find myself getting camped, flailing my arms for the attempt escape, yelling at my tv 'fuck me, just do gens!'
---
i have played pig since release and FINALLY got my first kill with the trap a few days ago.  and that was only because i popped a trap on someone just before their teammates popped a gen.  i had the add on for 1 extra jigsaw box on the map so i'm sure that helped.  
---
now the strategy is basically going to be to trap as many people as soon as the game starts.  zero reason to keep any traps for after the game.  I used to always leave 1 or usually 2 traps for late game.  i mean you still could and try to get someone with 1 or 2 gens left.  but i def feel it was an unnecessary change
---
Killers are going full tryhard as well. Just want to mess around with the collapse but didn‚Äôt get the chance yet cause the last 4 killers I played against went full out with NOED, an ebony, insta chainsaw...
---
Guess I‚Äôll have to play killer to see the changes. Damn.
---
Isnt the hatch only open during collapse?
---
So true lmfao i saw they were changing it, read the patch notes and was very disappointed. So many small buffs they can do to make it at least usable. It doesn't even need to be meta, just usable at least. Literally all this is for is: 
---
&gt; Tenacious: Complete repairing a generator after the hatch has opened (500) 
---
Which NOBODY is going to do lol
---
Not anymore she doesn't
---
I go hunting in The Fog as The Wraith every so often, and I face camp.... but how would u/ImStuckInAToaster know, he's burnt bread at this point.
---
What a lazy fucking post. This sub is better than this.
---
i feel i come across more myers face camping than any other killer. most leatherfaces are just terrible though
---
That's how you play survivor. You're getting out of the very low ranks and into areas where people actually have a grasp of what they are doing. Use mindgames and fake them out / make them think you are going 1 way and go the other, catch them off guard. Chase them around the pallet loops and don't respect them (walk into the pallets and tank the stun rather than wait for them to drop). A good survivor will capitalize on that and keep looping it when you wait for the drop. You have to commit to chases otherwise you're just wasting your own time. Playing killer in this game is all about time efficiency. I recommend you level hillbilly to get enduring so your stun time is reduced. One of the best perks in the game for killers.
---
Just hit them when they try to bodyblock as well. It's actually a good thing for you because you're getting free pressure on the survivors and putting them all in the injured state. Just don't chase them down though but do smack them if they get in your way
---
Holy shit. Some people are really petty...
---
Any salt with that? Perhaps some pallets?
---
I never really played Pig that much but wasn't part of the point of the RBT for the endgame? Like aren't they useless in endgame now?
---
I thought dedicated servers weren't out until the 25th, even though the PTB is out today.
---
My spelling
---
WHY
---
That's because they added it so quickly, it wasn't intended to be in the game. My guess is you won't have to with dedicated servers
---
Seems like they are nerfing everyone first legion now this screw you bhvr this is why I stopped playing
---
That is the biggest amount of bullshit the devs have pulled in ages. She didn't need a nerf in the slightest. RBTs are pretty much useless now.
---
Already hyped for the Nurse buffs  no one ever asked for next patch.
---
Devs said this is just a test, and that they will add servers to areas if needed.
---
Its okay if you get super bored? So, you get to pick and choose when it is and isn‚Äôt okay to play a killer? Gatekeeping much
---
Oof what a horrible way to handle the Pigs RBT in the end game collapse. What happened to a logical fix for her RBT at the end game ? This isn't logical it's horrible.
---
i agree the pins being reworks is better than before, given their old effects were useless in terms of recharge (removed slightly less per normal M1 hits when not in frenzy)
---
No. The hatch also spawns if there is only one survivor left n√≥ matter the gens done. So if you 3k and the gates are not powered n√≥ EGC. The EGC only happens on powered gates and closing the hatch.
---
Hahaha what a nerd. Nah jk I play yugioh too, but fr it‚Äôs just a meme üòÜ
---
I use that perk too as a Leatherface sometimes but gotta admit it's a little annoying from the survivors' perspectctive. But then I understand it's part of the game so I am not mad about it. Some people are just too salty.
---
I feel like it's the opposite. Pausing in the terror radius is not a big deal, you should not follow them anyway or you can crouch if you want to surprise them at a box then the TR is 0. I'm more worried about the fact that any RBT used after the last gen is useless now which used to be my favourite strength of Piggy.
---
Only time that doesn't happen to me is when it's really low ping
---
It makes absolutely no sense, nerfing a low mid tier killer because you added an endgame mode that only will only effect potato survivors if 3 minutes pass. However, 3 minutes is the absolute lowest amount of time possible because you need survivors to be downed or hooked for them to stay.
---
That doesnt make sense. If you close the hatch there would be no hatch grabs anyways.
---
Because many pigs tend to tunnel their RBT victims, that's why.
---
I always switch a Franklin's in, if I see a party with torches. You just know what they're gonna do if they're already loading in with one.
---
Yesterday i almost made a thread about asking for some ambush buffs but i think this is fine too bhvr pretty good job
---
They even nerfed the BP for hooking after Collapse has started...and then moved those points to the actual sacrifice. Which will just encourage more end game camping which I thought empiricist hated.
---
Yeah you might be right there actually. And the more I think about it, the fact that it doesn‚Äôt activate like pretty much at all in endgame anyway is upsetting. They really missed the mark on this by just gutting her kit
---
why should nurse's be able to see mending
---
Pretty much.
---
*texas? whos she?*

---
A sad day has come to our lands.
---
I mean people who main him or think he's good. Nobody should ever not play a character cuz of people's opinions about him though.
---
DBD playerbase: Even as a survivor, I don't like that Mettle of Man nerfs the low-tier M1 killers like Freddy and Pig more than the top killers. They're the last ones that need indirect nerfs.
---
BHVR: Hold my beer
---
At this point Amanda is now the worst designed licensed killer. At least Freddy still to a point retains the thematic nature of his franchise even if he's weak.
---
Amanda's signature Saw power and pressure of being in that Jigsaw trap situation? Gone. Lol. I would not be happy if I was Lionsgate.
---
recreation or new DBD rendition of Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
---
Usually two weeks hopefully they hold out till they actually get a logical fix for Pigs RBT at the end game.
---
All killers move faster than survivors running(except for nurse and survivors using sprint burst/balanced landing/lithe etc). So relying on bloodlust is not always needed. To deal with loops you need to learn how to mindgame them and outsmart them. There are a lot of videos on YouTube you can check out for some tips and tricks.
---
As for bodyblocking, I always drop the survivor I'm carrying. Then I can freely hit all of them without worrying about the downed one wiggling free. Plus its hilarious seeing them run like hell when you do drop the survivor.
---
There are various ways to prevent looping using both perks, abilities and smarts. Don't worry, you'll learn how and when and where to mind game with experience :)
---
So don't give up!
---
I mean its a ptb, everyone wiill dc
---
It was already pretty hard for them to die of RBT without tunneling them...
---
I read about the exit gates and thought "well I'm glad I use Remember Me" then I saw that was nerfed as well. I'm sure it's related to the EGC.
---
seriously, I take 2 approaches to players like that. I either chase them or just ignore them since I know for a fact they are not going to do gens since all they want is to be chase around so I get to waste his time and his teammate that I‚Äôm chasing. 
---
But yeah, a lot of cocky players are really bad at the game. Also I don‚Äôt understand the DC
---
pig nerf? *excuse me what?*
---
&gt;I'm excited to see how fluid survivor feels, but I'm anxious to see if there's any noticable delay as killer
---
Dedicated servers are live the 25th tho. Right now it's still p2p even in the PTB.
---
Why did you feel the need to clarify a small, joke comment? Of course people play him because they want BBQ. Chill.
---
No salt, I'd like one god pallet with that though.
---
Pig wasn't even that great pre nerf. She was ok, but nowhere near thr level of top tier killers, and now shes just a freaking joke. Literally no reason to really play her now
---
Taking an extra hit vs being no mither against a baseline killer. Hmm.... People didn't heal before because you were practically full health. You aren't going to get downed by a 110% m1. He had to feral, so removing deep wounds was essentially full healing.
---
They have to care if you get them on before last gen is done, otherwise using your power wastes your time and gives other survivors more. That's the issue that I can't believe they managed to create:
---
*Pigs ability is actively detrimental to her during endgame collapse even when used correctly.*
---
At this point sign DBD rights to a new company. Lol
---
&gt;Now a survivor can just waltz through the exit gate
---
Only if no generator was completed. That's a pretty specific scenario.
---
You know its bad when the pork's asking to be eaten.
---
I must have missed it but what did they do to the RBT now due to the endgame?
---
Put that rbt in devs head, stupid dev.
---
Because rank 15 players complained. It's why BHVR does anything killer related: what are the rank 15 players having trouble with?
---
LMAO
---
They'll get it off before it even activates
---
I was playing a game full man swf vs a spirit with a Russian roulette build on (ruin, devour, haunted and lullaby) I cleansed every totem but haunted by pure luck and then my teammate knowing this cleansed haunted and we all died in the span of a minute.
---
Hot that phat whip
---
rip no stupid questions Tuesday thread
---
My question is how is this fun? You seriously spent money on, and took the time to download a game just so you could stand there and do nothing?
---
Then is the ambush that also got nerfed?
---
Not even if you get the traps on when there's one gen left. They can just walk out as soon as they get unhooked
---
The fact that the survivors can just walk out of the trial with a trap on their heads means that if at least one of the four survivors is opening a gate, you've wasted all your time putting RBTs on people
---
There are plenty of powerful survivor perks...you're just not looking hard enough.
---
Mettle is too strong and adversely punishes weaker killers more than strong ones because it simply is too easy to activate.
---
I play him often because I think he has some of the best teachables out there.  Infectious Fright + Franklin‚Äôs Demise is quite brutal for those who plan to Flashlight Save
---
Can't wait for Ardetha's rant. It seems that on rare occasions players that are better than all the devs call them out on their balance.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is that bad tbh (besides the RBT at exit gates). However, I only saw the bear trap nerf. Did they nerf her crouch TR? If not, I don‚Äôt think RBT timers will be hit THAT hard if you‚Äôre crouching to camp the boxes. Then you get into a chase anyway. It kinda turns her play style into more of a stealth type/wait it out/did he choose this box type play style. She‚Äôs kinda like this already but this forces you to be in crouch for longer. Did they do anything to her crouch? Like MS buff or something? I think a MS buff on her crouch would make it more viable
---
&gt;I hope BHVR fires whoever made this decision
---
Jfc dude, you want someone to lose their job because you don't like some changes you haven't even played yet?
---

---
This should help, OP!
---
For the body blocking, usually you won't have all 3 survivors there. It's pretty difficult to manage when they all show up, but it's very rare and otherwise body blocking is not that big of a deal so don't worry too much about it. But there is a perk that can help in this situation called Mad Grit, a Legion perk.
---
For regular old pallet loops, try and get Enduring, a Hillbilly perk, and don't respect that shit. Some of these you can mindgame around, some you can't. Figuring out which is which is just about playing and learning to recognize it.
---
Some maps, like Ironworks, you just have to do your best and understand that your games there will always be fuckin hard because of how bad the map balance there is for killers
---
First they take our cute oinks and now they take our power?!?
---
I'm not even sure why this was needed. 20 seconds was already pretty fast and often the endgame results in killers walkingnto the gates only for it to open as they get there.
---
The two big things are
---
1. The timer will now stop in Terror Radius, not just chase
---
2. You can leave the doors with one on and live
---
First they make frenzy useless now they make RBT useless...what's next on the nerf list?
---
Felt more like damage control to me.
---
I mean with the changes legion now can actually chain hit to multiple survivors as frenzy lasts long enough, you also get built in tracking that is actually useful as you can chase without frenzy. 
---
115% makes them less reliant on their power
---
Overall the changes make them better and more fun to play and play against.
---
I would change the vault speed back as now it looks dumb
---
David looks hot.
---
Hol up they're doing what? Does anybody got a link to  the info?
---
The trap still goes off at the gate, as long as a gen is completed after the trap is on.
---
Next update leatherface can‚Äôt one shot with chainsaw.....
---
Activating the endgame early blocks generators instead of completing them, and the timer stops in the terror radius rather than a chase.
---
Nod. It still sucks that during EGC a killer cannot grab so free escape???
---
Wait wait leave while its on!? Wtf is the point of it then!? The timer will stop in TR isnt horrible just unneeded but the being able to leave pretty much voids the RBT
---
The pig nerf is undeserved.
---
Not *only* people like this, the survs that orange were playing against also make the game as toxic as it is.
---
Legion was understandable but fucking Amanda? What the actual fuck devs. You literally destroyed a characters kit
---
Yo, yall know if there is any way to ask them questions? I wanna know if they'll ever make it so that you choose what server you're in. Cuz I wanna visit the Americans sometimes, u know
---
Yikes...guess I‚Äôm not a pig main anymore.
---
The trapped survivor would just be chasing you. He'd be doing nothing useful  for the team .Also with the traps not ticking within terror radius you would be able to know the general location of the trapped survivor. If it's not ticking then he's within your radius.
---
Pig traps no longer tick down if in killer radius and survivors can walk out the exit gates if a trap is inactive. Currently I only know for sure if pig closes the hatch it does not activate the RBT on survivors. What I don't know is if pig puts on an RBT after exits are powered does it no longer tick down which would be a huge nerf.
---
servers the Russians right tbh
---
Oh yeah I forgot to mention that the increased vault speed also makes it harder to chain stabs and use the power as (seemingly) originally intended.
---
Can you link a screenshot? I can't play it for another hour.
---
Makes slamming that hatch shut a priority. But also made gates 25% easier to open. Like, jesus... why.
---
I only played 4-5 games or so but he feels usable to me. I am rank 8 on PTB but survivors were kinda all over the place rankwise (6-15).
---
It seems easier now to apply deep wound to multiple survivor because of the significantly buffed duration (despite the reduced movement speed) from 6s to 10s. 
---
He obviously can be looped a bit more but due to the movementspeed buff and his small size you can mindgame survivors now decently well on certain loops. I thought the changes would make him way worse but now I am not so sure.
---
Another Patch that buffs Survivors and nerfs Killers. Great Job BHVR.
---
She could. That‚Äôs why I understand why they made it terror radius based.
---
That is a lot of assumptions you made. You probably learned to use those ellipses from your inbred family on facebook - that is my assumption.
---
loved that book
---
Roses are red 
---
And violets are blue 
---
One day we‚Äôll cruise down blood gulch Avenue
---
Everyone watch red be blue if you haven‚Äôt yet it‚Äôs amazing
---
I didn't say there should be. I was just giving the reason why people DC over there even more than on live.
---
**Inactive** RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. 
---
They didn't make it so RBTs don't pop at all when you try to leave with it on, they made it so if its inactive and you try to leave you can. They specify **Inactive** for a reason. What I'm saying is I believe that if all the gens are powered the RBT is active regardless, just like how its always worked. I think all the change does is prevent a nigh impossible win situation if you are the only survivor left in the trial and the Pig has prematurely activated the gates by closing the hatch INSTEAD of by you powering the gens.
---
Shhh. This is why no one likes you.
---
Stop using logic &gt;:(
---
&gt; US East (Ohio)  
---
wut
---
I don‚Äôt rely on RBT kills I rely on RBT to keep them fkers in the game
---
I was expecting the perk to completely change how it functions but instead they up the numbers...
---
Thank christ, no longer need to be punished for someone else's Zimbabwe internet..
---
How are they useless? This change only makes it so if a Survivor gets a bear trap and is in the last one left alive they can't automatically lose the game if the killer closes hatch.
---
Thanks! I never knew until now.
---
press f to pay respects
---
SWF squads have already completely changed the game. We have to deal with that.
---
If it wouldn't be rng, it would be too easy to kick off her traps. Which is not fun.
---
Ok yeah but no pig that is actually good will walk around crouched so survivors get some pressure from the trap ( the one thing they are meant to do).
---
So you accuse me of assuming...then you assume I'm inbred. Are you okay? Do you read what you write? Hey look i used dots again!! .... &lt;- inbred indicator
---
Oh yeah, that's a big nope to flashlight saves haha
---
I like the changes
---
I mean pre nerf pig was nowhere near nurse or billy.
---
Wait. If the traps are on when the last gen is complete then they are active. They don't deactivate... right? It's once that last gen is done and the gate gets opened, there's no way to activate them. 
---
And RBTs activate if youre hooked and a gen gets finished I thought? The timer just doesnt start until you're unhooked.
---
Buff/reward killers playing against SWF. Don't change the whole game around it.
---
ikr, how dare I even wish to play this game with green ping for being a filthy russian
---
matheiu is basically saying GET OUT OF HERE
---
As someone who used to main the doctor I can see why.  I would literally just guard three gens in close proximity to each other. The combination of overcharge and madness made it impossible for the survivors to 5 gen me. You also get a silly amount of points and I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt see the doctor very often.
---
It's funny because like three weeks ago a yellow ranks player made a post about how unfair pig is lol
---
Hm, never thought of it from that perspective. That makes sense now. My main issue is the terror radius change. It makes it so bear traps don't have nearly as much pressure on them. You don't feel as pressured to stay away from the killer with a trap on. The exit gate change I don't mind so much.
---
You can leave if it is inactive. Which now a trap is much more likely to be inactive than active.
---
As a survivor main this is one of the MOST FUN combos to play against. It adds a level of risk/reward and absolute terror when it turns out you've cleansed HG instead of Ruin.
---
Your whole argument is based on an assumption. Thanks for fucking off though
---
ALL YA HAD TO DO, WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN TOTEM CJ!
---
My main since getting the game in October of last year, I don't know who I'll play now. They are literally destroying the whole point of her power, my poor girl *sad oink*
---
Can still go off if it's **active**.
---
Calling someone SJW - yikes
---
Replying to yourself - double yikes
---
"What I'm saying is I believe that if all the gens are powered the RBT is active regardless, just like how its always worked."
---
Yeah, I run treasure hunter on occasion and have gotten some clutch yields that made a difference
---
Or he could just turn around and down them with a basic M1?
---
Haha, apparently. To be honest, it was really hard to find those even. But I think it is interesting that many of the things they complain about are now getting nerfed.
---
Why is your power icon and perk icons so cool? Did they update the textures finally? :o
---
But it doesn‚Äôt punish them because they will tunnel whether it‚Äôs active or not.
---
It hurts regular pig players because the RBT loses even more of it‚Äôs fleeting pressure
---
This sounds right. They figured that technically Pig could exploit chase mechanics like Legion did, even though it would suck for Pig to do it.
---
It does kinda show how bad the chase mechanic is when we've had 2 killers have their power disassociated from it and a perk disassociated from it.
---
I know how it feels to be tunneled and see no issue with it. Compared to the other people, Im in a weaker state, Im an easier kill, if they don't tunnel me for that then they're stupid. Its my fault for getting caught in the first place and essentially putting myself in that position.
---
As for the reverse, if i hook you and someone saves you, of course Im going for you. Youre injured, one less hook, and possibly have a trap. Tunneling is called toxic but in most cases its just playing smart...
---
And even then, I'm more likely to break off from you for someone else because you would be busy with that trap and I can just come back for you later by checking the boxes once I deal with someone else... Its just strategy...
---
I don'e see where you get that at all
---
God tier shitpost
---
Im so fucking done with pig man fuck this game
---
Why are you activating EGC, rendering **inactive RBTs** useless, if the survivors have traps on their heads instead of letting them **become active** due to a generator completion?
---
Can't really say I'm surprised, but I am a bit sad there arent any in the entirety of africa.  Oh well, stable 200 to EUW is still better than the diceroll it is now
---
&gt; Peer to Peer vs Dedicated Servers 
---
Everyone since ever already knew that dedicated beats peer any day of the week.
---
&gt;but I figure most Dbd players probably haven't read the book, which is a good read.
---
weird assumption
---
How often would something like that happen realistically?
---
The devs basically took a hot iron, pulled her pants and branded her "balanced".
---
Its overkill, I dont think even survivor mains would justify that, not even with the end game change.
---
Literally no one except newcomes with 3 hours of gameplay were complaining about how "OP" the pig is.
---
*really fucking angry oink*
---
Why? I live in Texas and im not sure how this screws me over lol.
---
Read the patch notes.
---
I don't tunnel early, but one game I was chasing the unhooker and leaving the unhooked person, when the unhooked person starts bming me. It's not like I can't make an exception for jackasses.
---
Yeah, agreed. If they literally have no way to proc after gen 5s done, thats atrocious. Im hoping its not the case too.
---
She could, but the RBT timers were too long. Unlike legion, it was just faster to down them rather than moonwalking.
---
Which poll?
---
There is no reason to change it from how it previously worked at all. Of course BHVR is classically not great at wording or explaining shit so we don't really know until we see it in action but considering every killer on PTB is playing Legion right now we can't see it in action.
---
These are Geistra's "Sky Pack" icons. You can get 'em here  [https://twitter.com/DatGeistra/status/1118292376810872833](https://twitter.com/DatGeistra/status/1118292376810872833)
---
You can¬¥t beat the bullies.
---
She didn‚Äôt need a nerf, and we never asked for a nerf
---
I‚Äôm sorry but BHVR has shit for brains
---
It is toxic behaviour and I think it can be reported. Not entirely sure though.
---
As I killer I see this kind of thing happen sometimes and tend to punish the survivor for it. After all...a survivor's worst enemy is often another survivor
---
I‚Äôm interested to see this as well when it goes live in two weeks. I use a controller.
---
Be wary. Pig's oinking no more.
---
This is basically you saying to my face that billy's chainsaw is not meant to one-hit survivors and it should be used only as a means to navigate the map quickly.
---
If the traps were just a bit more nerfed they would basically be a cosmetic you get to wear until the end of the game.
---
Played a bit and I like it. I told you guys, those changes are fine
---
This is fucking hilarious hahaha thank you
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that made it possible for The Legion to search a locker while in Feral Frenzy.   
---
Ummmmm....BE, this has been in the game since legion came out. This isn‚Äôt a bug or issue, it‚Äôs been a way to punish someone for thinking being in a locker is a safe space.
---
get out the billyboi and some bbq sauce
---
okay so your ass. got it
---
it's definitely rough. i tried a few years back and couldn't get through it, although that's also partially because i'm easily bored. i'll have to try again, i suppose.
---
Thank you so much!
---
is this just a joke or is this themed to the book? either way the skins look amazing!
---
Lmao i immediately thought, "really? left behind still sucks". and then i realized that's the survivor sticking their fingers in the gen lmfao
---
Not the best fix, but still best than this nerf lmao
---
it's even less likely to be useful now, that's the point... giving it haste bonus when you're left alone would make it at least good for finding hatch
---
The bit about EA has my sides splitting
---
Some of these changes are weird but overall I‚Äôm really liking the direction the game is going!
---
I'd rather they give it a tangible in game effect rather than continue to let it encourage bad saves. It'll be better for survivors overall if they aren't getting farmed.
---
Also the Claudette crouching to the bottom right
---
r/iamveryrandom
---
So you use a controller on PC but you're not testing it on the PTB?
---
You are correct. I misread it the first time. That makes it better although I still feel that the change is unnecessary.
---
&gt; Pig changes
---
RIP meme Distressing + Unnerving Presence builds on The Game.
---
1 - Yeah you're right on that one.
---
2 - It does lose pressure for the endgame, but for the most part the RBT will still gets the job done in buying you time in the mid-game. That said I do think that the changes made to her were unnecessary. They should have just kept her as she was before, let people test her out on the PTB with the end game collapse and then make some changes if they were needed.
---
I honestly prefer M&amp;K myself, though I adapt quickly between controllers and M&amp;K. But I havent seen many 360s and 180s other than myself on console
---
Are generators blocked or not when endgame collapse starts? it doesn't say that they are in the End Game Collapse section but there's a reference to blocked generators in the Pig's notes. Also, there's reference that generators can be completed during endgame collapse...so are they blocked or not? Are they blocked for a certain time? Why is there no reference to it in the initial endgame collapse section?
---
You are completely missing my point, which I thought I wouldn't need to carefully explain (because you were already talking about "all gens done").  
---
  
---
I am not talking about Tunneling in general. I am not talking about RBT in general. And I am sure as hell not talking about gen pressure.  
---
What I am talking about is downing an unlucky survivor who couldn't make it to through the exit gate only to be accessorized with a funky head ornament that also has the invisible letters F U C K Y O U written on it. Even with lightsaber flashlights, 3 man body blocks and 4 +2 insta-heals - that unlucky survivor has NO chance for survival right now.  
---
But the PTB? It fixes that particular scenario by making it so that any RBT that you for whatever reason couldn't get use of until then is essentially dead weight.
---
thanks!
---
Well RIP the only killer I‚Äôm good at. I‚Äôd like ‚Äúfuck Behavior‚Äù on my grave please
---
I agree. I was just made aware though that the traps can still go off at the gate if they were activated by a generator. They just wont kill anymore if they are put on survivors after all gens were powered. It is still unnecessary but this makes it at least a little better than I thought.
---
yeah new legion is fun to play against each time i got downed by him i feel was deserved unlike before so i like new updates to him
---
Flair checks out. Sorry bud
---
the only thing i REALLY dislike about their changes is their vault speed, it takes SO LONG to vault a pallet, i don't understand why they changed that.
---
other than that, i like their changes
---
Exactly.
---
I mean if the survivor is already got a powered trap on their head fair enough they die, the killer will be winning 99% of the time if they close the hatch anyway
---
when you're crouched behind a rock as the last survivor and the person who was just sacrificed messages the killer to tell them where you are
---
If you downed them, and put a trap on them, and hooked them, jigsaw box or not they are already dead. This is just going to promote camping.
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
&gt;And EGC baseline is twice as long as a  trap so it's barely even a concern
---
So everyone running around to boxes during EGC and only have half the time to open a gate doesn't like a major unintended buff and concern? That is so irrationally biased.
---
I run Bond. I see them. *I see what they ~~don't~~ do*
---
The 3 gen strat is really unfun as you can pretty much hold the game hostage, but it doesn't really achieve anything. 
---
At some point you've got to commit to a chase and at that point the survivors can work on a gen.
---
Doc may be able to find people easily but he can't end chases quickly against decent survivors.
---
Yeh, it's some wacky stuff alright.
---
Can't believe I got a new PC just to try out this PTB.  Oh well, it was interesting to say the least.  Wish the ground had shaken a bit more.
---
I need help
---
both US server sites are roughly equidistant from texas
---
When you misspell a word that is in the picture you uploaded
---
Now this puts a smile on my face
---
You're not a very smart person.
---
If there's 3 dead already, why would the Pig trap the fourth person and then let them go get their hat off? They'd just hook them and kill them anyways.
---
Heaven forbid that the last survivor doesn't just get a guaranteed escape after their entire team gets
---
Claudette is literally a skin and you guys stay shitting on her for some reason. ;)
---
Well, you slam the hatch the gates power and the timer starts. However, the gennies dont complete... so bitter murmur doesnt proc and I suspect they will make it so other perks like noed dont either. 
---
Assuming hatch spawn is far off a gate, that's more than 15 seconds for a survivor to get to open and make good their escape.
---
I dislike the gate timer change for survivors. 30 seconds is already short enough.
---
Emblems are now far more difficult to get to Iridescent
---
Yeah, I don't care if its grindy as fuck I just don't wanna drop 10 bucks on 1 skin
---
A happy ending lmao

They did! Just not all the way
---
i am here 4 u
---
I‚Äôm gonna stop him and I‚Äôm a killer main
---
Think it refers to the fact that once the hatch has been closed, the gates automatically power up, so the gens are shut down.
---
you're basing this off a ridiculously absurd hypothetical lmfao "but what if the pig saves all of her traps and manages to somehow down every single survivor after the gates are opened and traps them all?1!1!1!1??"
---
&gt;You're not a very smart person.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;If there's 3 dead already, why would the Pig trap the fourth person and then let them go get their hat off? They'd just hook them and kill them anyways.
---
I'm not the smart person but  I have to lay it out for you? 
---
3rd died on hook and the 4th had a RBT still on to begin with. Killer closes hatch, EGC starts. You're posposing he has to run around evading killer to boxes before he can even power an exit gate?
---
Yeah not sure how I feel about the killer changes yet, the pig one seems unnecessary but as far as overall game health goes, I‚Äôm excited
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that made pig somewhat *playable*
---
ftfy
---
Most pigs tunnel and camp but I rarely see them.
---
I guarantee you you wouldn‚Äôt
---
&gt; 3rd died on hook and the 4th had a RBT still on to begin with.
---
Who unhooked the person with the RBT on?
---
Worst thing is, Pig players tend to be total bros and have really fun games. Now even more people will play characters with OHKO crutches instead, which is just unfun.
---
wait, what's happening?
---
Fungoose also mentions occasionally on stream that he considers the Pig to be the weakest killer in the game, and he's honestly the best killer player I know of. And she just got nerfed...
---
Are you for real?! I just started maining her!!!!
---
you wouldn‚Äôt have to wait for the surv. just close it when you find it. but can you still use a key for it?
---
&gt;&gt; 3rd died on hook and the 4th had a RBT still on to begin with.
---
&gt;Who unhooked the person with the RBT on?
---
The 3rd guy before he started getting chased by killer? Do I need to really spell all of this out for you?
---
From what I see its not really on fire, its basically just warm ashes now.
---
People are clinging to the hope that the winds of steam release will rekindle the flame, but you cannot fix lazy devs with a half cooked idea.
---
Wait, so to clarify, it sounds like the traps can still be active during the end game, just not if you start it prematurely.
---
So what exactly is the calm spirit buff? It seems like it does exactly the same thing as it does now.

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa

ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME HOW COULD ANY HUMAN BEING NOT REALIZE AN OBVIOUS CHANGE BETWEEN A SURVIVOR AND KILLER I CAN'T FUCKIN BREEEEEEATHE
---
&gt;Also, you can't grab out of hatch anymore. Whoever gets there first wins.
---
Not true. Killers are already getting a buff with EGC and you whine about not getting guaranteed your 4th kill because you deserve it? Lol
---
RBT only activates after a gen is done. RBT no longer prevents escaping through the exit gates. If you put an RBT on someone after the gates are powered, it does nothing except give them an ugly hat.
---
Im a console gamer but if you look up Zubatlel on twitch and watch his video from today you'll see it .
---
lmao , you are a hypocrite .
---
there are some killers that cant live without getting the 4k. if you close the hatch then the survivor has a chance at escaping through the gates.
---
coldwind farm theme music
---
Yeah I guess thats a good point.
---
Ok but that wasn't what we were talking about.
---
Between, Mettle of Man, the Remember Me Nerf, and now the Pig Nerf...Im taking a long break. The devs seem intent on forcing killer-players to only use a few top tier killers.
---
I learned Billy because of the devs and what they do to map design and perks. But my favorite killers are M1 killers sadly (Wraith, Pig, etc)...who dont benefit from some of the perks the devs keep releasing or changing.
---
I think BHVR is going to force me to end up abandoning this game. And it sucks that I actually spent money and a lot of time on this game after buying it around New Years.
---
The devs are doing the same things EPIC did to make me quit Fortnite. I don't understand these updates. I want variety in playstyles. But in order to win consistently in high ranks, there seems to be only specific items and characters I must use.
---
That gets old
---
Only if most of your team is dead. Honestly how can this be such a large Nerf to the pig that it only triggers in endgame which means 3/4 of the survivors are already dead. Traps automatically trigger when 5 generators are powered, so it doesn't affect that at all.
---
I'm glad, and surprised, we've made amends there then. And no, it doesn't equal fun but in a game thats competitive with 1 side versus the other, you're bound to have moments where you aren't having fun. Its in those moments though you get better, find better strategies under pressure, new ways toe scape those situations and eventually those moments become fun again.
---
Pallet drop, circle, mislead or hide while being chased. Take every advantage you have in the case of a 1v1 where you have a trap. What also sucks is your teammates have essentially either died or left you, if there was one other person there it'd be considerably easier. 1v1s typically end when you're spotted, its tough, but they don't always have to. Its no different than being last alive and getting hooked, the only difference is you at least have a chance with the rbt.
---
That's assuming they're last alive of course, if not that's where the cooperative side of the game is at fault, not the killers ability.
---
And yeah, Legion changes are weird, BT sorta gets buffed out of this though since its classified as deep wounds too though I think? But deep wounds definitely wastes time still as long as, god forbid, youre anywhere near them now? Thats such a weird change still, same for the RBTs.. RBTs got totally screwed and as I've said elsewhere, putting an rbt on someone after gen 5 is just wasting your time and actively detrimental to you for using your ability.

Main sell point: Her traps kill you if you escape before dealing with them!

Patch 2.7.0: *What's a trap?*
---
WE NEED THIS BUNNY OUTFIT!
---
Literally just read the patch notes you absolute bellend.
---
You can close the hatch, this stops hatch standoffs, survivor finds the hatch while being chased they win. This is fine
---
Its technically a healing action. Also with it stopping in tr it would make nurses viable for countering people basically able to mend in your face.
---
It seems like you're being a whiny little bitch about EGC moreso than the Pig's ability to do anything about it. That's your _real_ issue here.
---
Depends on rank but generally console players are worse.
---
Not at all. Survivor can jump in and can't be grabbed anymore. If the killer decides to stand on the hatch you can do generators.
---
Huntress is like "I know I'm some god-chosen murderer icon but holy shit its like Paranormal Activity up in here"
---
... It was mentioned multiple times during the EGC discussion. You can either finisn the gens and start the EGC (in which case the remaining gens are blocked): the killer can open the exit gate and start the EGC (in which case the remaining gens are blocked off and both exits powered) or the killer can close the hatch (in which case both exit gates are fully powered, and therefore no more gens are required to be completed, ergo the gens are blocked off)
---
I'm not trying to be an ass here, but I genuinely don't understand what's complicated to get about that? There's 3 scenarios that can start the EGC, all of which result in the immediate activation of the end gates meaning gens aren't required any more...
---
I was wrong before so ty for correcting me
---
bye
---
I tried out Billy but I got destroyed as I'm like rank 15 and my Billy is level 12, should I wait for rank reset to try him out?
---
Awful changes all must be reverted before collapse goes live
---
I mean... yeah I guess...  
---
Seriously, this is why I don't follow memes. One fucking blink and you'll never understand.
---
No isssue :) You are welcome.
---
How about a mass protest. Only queue as survivor.
---
This is a massive overreaction
---
Yup, that‚Äôs precisely the sort of narrow-minded thinking that‚Äôs driving this. God forbid the Killer creates a nearly no-win situation that they absolutely earned. Gotta make it so Killer loses power even outside of that niche situation. 
---
Seriously, that would have brought the Pig to a role of prominence. Taking that functionality away from her just feels *mean.*
---
They needed to do this to align with the end game collapse, otherwise she would just be able to trap the last survivor and they would be dead no matter what. Yeah sure it will make her slightly worse overall but not by much. I really don't understand the outrage
---
no, how dare you play the game. russians are like the biggest reason why i want us to be able to switch servers so i dont have to deal with those idiots
---
Wow look at you, making the exact same joke as the original post. Hilarious
---
I felt the same. God forbid you are even mildly away from the gate, ending a Chase. Everyone is getting out for sure.
---
Really? It isn‚Äôt that difficult to assume this post is about the killer nerf everybody is talking about.  What else would it be about? Don‚Äôt be so condescending.
---
Yes and no. In this case I want the people that DC to face an extinction event. Though I guess them destroying what I want would also be a fair flipped interpretation.
---
Is Myers any good or nah?
---
\*makes an account specifically for a game's sub\* 
---
\*Posts that we should quit the game\*
---
&gt;Literally just read the patch notes you absolute bellend.
---
Let me read it for you.
---
&gt;Removed hatch interrupts for the End Game Collapse.
---
So you can still interrupt hatch escapes when EGC isn't triggered. For example, last survivor remaining, hatch spawns, no EGC yet, killer and survivor meet at hatch and since Killer can close hatch now the survivor is forced to jump asap and the killer can still interrupt.
---
Who's the bellend now?
---
When you are the last survivor on the map... gen speed repair gets faster
---
After a while the survivors would eventually take massive risks to end the game. This is where you‚Äôd catch them. I‚Äôd still never do it again as I‚Äôm starting to find a lot of things in this game are not necessarily unbalanced, but they are unfun.
---
I got body blocked by a Jake once, which lead to me getting hooked. Later when he got hooked, I pretended to grab him and left for the exit gates. He was the only one to die.
---
You get pig mains. But you are indeed correct. Everyone complains about everything no matter what behaviour does
---
Dedicated servers should be a new breath of life into this game. I haven‚Äôt played for a while because of how awful disconnects are, hopefully I can get back into it with dedicated servers
---
It‚Äôs more like they keep removing the good items from the menu, and all we‚Äôre left with is trash
---
Saves me time. I was considering trying her out after getting huntress to p3.
---
I don't understand how you people recognize that SWF is a game balance issue and decide that the issue is for the teammates of the SWF and not the killer where the actual conflict and balance problem exists
---
The RBT's are meant to put pressure on the survivors, not necessarily for kills
---
Pigs power is already almost really powerless, now she's joining Freddy's and Legion tiers.
---
Myers is mid-tier. He's playable, personally wouldnt call him high-tier though.
---
...yes?
---
No I don‚Äôt play the PTBs. I just wait until it goes live.
---
Ok. 
---
Don't let the door hit you on your way out.  And close the fucking door!
---
Killers have been buffed in every patch so far. Also legion was never op he was just broken. Are you really missing that much with the nerf?
---
The thing with the RBTs not being active during the EGC makes sense but why on earth did they make them terror radius based. I‚Äôve never actually played her but most of the time as survivor it‚Äôs easy enough to hide around a box while she‚Äôs patrolling the area and if she doesn‚Äôt leave you can just go to another box. 
---
I was a Legion main and while I don‚Äôt agree with the terror radius change to them it was much more necessary for them but is in no way needed for Piggy, hopefully they‚Äôll reverse that aspect of her changes.
---
Thanks! I'll probably try out Billy for the insta-down, that's what I struggle most in, I can get the first hit easily but after that I struggle to get a second hit as I don't know when I should lunge in a loop
---
Agreed
---
It's not just cosmetic, though. You can, for example, put statuses on survivors even if the RBTs aren't activated.
---
&gt; The Pig's Rusty Attachments add-on do not apply the mangled effect on survivors.
---
God damn it.
---
Here comes the crapper
---
Don't step into his craps
---
Before, waiting to bear trap at end game was a strategy to put on a lot more pressure, in exchange you gave up your primary ability for most of the game so you couldn't stall.  Now just bear trap from the start and stall like normal I guess, dont do end game pig anymore they just gutted a playstyle from her that had strengths and drawbacks.  And with how the timer would slow down during the collapse it wouldn't even be overpowered.
---
Yes it needed to happen or there would still be hatch standoffs if the killer wanted to.
---
Yeah sure
---
If you have to make up these really specific scenarios to excuse a change then the change is bad
---
And it shouldn't matter who you use or what perks/offerings , ITS PART OF THE GAME
---
And like I said you cocksucker, good luck getting matches.
---
(mic drop)
---
Basement camping is THE WORST. Who stands at the top of the basement waiting for good survivors who are playing the game properly. . I'm a survivor main for sure. Map crossing killers who basement camp are irritating. So a lot of my teammates disconnect. Not to let them off the hook they irritate the hell out of me too. But people make the game less fun when they face camp or basement camp. :/
---
oh, thank you for explaining all of this for me, i was really confused
---
You say rare hypothetical situation like it would never happen. Yeah it's not common but it does happen, that's the whole reason for the change. This is necessary. I don't think she needs a nerf but this needs to happen. They can buff her in other ways idgaf. Not a big surprise seeing this sub lose their fucking minds over a small killer nerf, especially a necessary one lmao.
---
Was never really worth buying DLC after they allowed you to get some of them for free with shards.
---
Aha, but here's my counterpoint. When you've lost the 90th game in a row because you don't have some instakill crutch, then what? The reason low tier exists is because everyone in there doesn't have access to instant knockdowns. Sure, Make Your Choice is a thing but you'll literally be throwing points away just to camp a hook, and that makes you a massive douche!
---
This is not a troll. I'm just un-creative when it comes to user names. Fuck Behavior at this point.
---
The Remember Me change has me genuinely infuriated. It was the only thing that saved the NoES chapter from being hot garbage and I used it in almost all my builds.
---
I understand this is to balance EGC, but no one likes to get their shit nerfed.
---
Or in EGC all boxes are researchable after searching another box, with an increasing chance to get it off per search as a collapse only thing. Represent it with Entity claws around the helmet and the base of the trap. Expalin it as the Entity is making Amanda's rigged game less rigged to get more juicy hope.
---
They said the rework would not be shown or out for another month or so.
---
I have lost faith I didn't know I had left.
---
Survivor can do gens until the killer closes the hatch. If the killer closes the hatch the gates are powered and the survivor has 3 minutes to open them. The only way the game will drag on is if the survivor is Urban Evading around to find the hatch and spots the killer on it and refuses to do gens while the killer also refuses to close it. Also yeah the survivor can no longer be grabbed from the hatch.
---
*Everyone Disliked That*
---
no more hatch standoffs, fuck yeah
---
I'm not. He's fun to play as, at least for me, and fun to play against too.
---
I think that they'll add more servers, it's just a test at the moment. Even then, they could possible add regions and then peer to peer it for your region if they don't have servers there.
---
I'm just glad to not be connected to people in China, Korea, or Russia as someone in America. It gets pretty annoying when every killer you get is from across the ocean.
---
I just wanted to help D:
---
I think it's interesting how they say these are being fixed with dedicated servers. I've noticed hit box issues are usually latency, not like gross lag but those small miliseconds of connection. They probably just haven't said anything so they didn't seem like they were making excuses
---
Read the patch notes: " Removed hatch interrupts for the End Game Collapse. "
---
&gt; Removed hatch interrupts for the End Game Collapse.
---
I used to feel the same way. But forcing yourself to do it makes you learn. I know actually want skillchecks, I've done it so much I can hit the great skillchecks much more than half the time, and the gen gets done way fast.
---
Can someone send me a link or is it up on dbds in game news? I feel seriously under a rock
---
Why do people say you‚Äôre doing ‚Äúnothing‚Äù. I‚Äôm getting 4fucking4. It‚Äôs fun tricking people into coming down the basement. And it‚Äôs even funnier to get whiny messages after the match!
---
Haha you mic dropped me! Epuic PWnzzz get pooed on nerd
---
I literally opened up an exit gate because you just cant win with this killer unless the survivors are potato. The legion didn't get Freddy'd he got Legion'd
---
I loved Remember Me on the trapper, worked well with iridescent stone on trapper. now its ruined.
---
Yes it is. I mean if you want to be super pedantic about it then sure I guess I could have worded it better but the statement would still be exactly the same and everyone who knows what sunk cost fallacy is understood what I meant anyways, except for you apparently.
---
I enjoy those personally
---
Why is everybody so mad about these changes? As survivor, I've had to put up with all of legion's bullshit exploits/uncounterability for months now, and I personally don't want to put up with it for any longer. Think legion deserves to be gutted until the devs can figure out a way to minimize those exploits/make their power fair.
---
if you get stuck in that animation try to get stunned this will lead to the hatchet being thrown away and you being unstuck
---
Not by much? Her power is useless now.
---
For me that's double sad. Not only do I really hate playing against Huntress, but to know that no one will even try Pig, a genuinely fun killer for both sides, chokes me up a bit.
---
Same.
---
If im not wrong, the majority of people complaining about pig being OP were survivors, whereas killers would be glad to have another viable killer to play in upper ranks. 
---
Saying she was going to be OP without even testing on PTB is overreacting, since there's a high risk just by depending on end game to make her this deadly.
---
Never liked pig to play as and against, so those changes dont affect me so much though i gotta say is concerning for that at this point, theres no reason to play killer at all nor maining a specific killer since it seems its inevitable them to be pushed down to the ground eventually cause "people dont like / is unfun to go against"
---
That's really gnarly! Awesome!
---
Not really, no. They removed the ability to grab them when they use Hatch. And they made it so it doesn't matter how many gens get done, the hatch will always spawn for the 4th guy. So, what's going to happen is this: you down the 3rd guy, hook them, they kill themselves or disconnect while the 4th guy is camping the hatch. Or, you slug the 3rd guy and go look for the 4th which brings us right back to square one. The only way to secure a 4K without slugging the 3rd guy is to either (A) know exactly where the hatch is or (B) know exactly where the 4th guy is in relation to the hatch and hopefully he's injured or you can instant down him. But, if you close hatch then the gates are now available and the pricks reduced the time to open the gates to now 15 seconds. So, unless you're using a killer with map control (Nurse/Billy) or maybe Hag you're fucked.
---
It's really funny how adorable the DBD fanbase made The Pig.
---
Harsher penalties are not really the solution.
---
People DC because the game has a bunch of unfun bullshit in it. No killer actually wants to play Haddonfield, ever. No survivor actually wants to play against iridescent head Huntress, ever. If people stay in those games, it's out of a sense of obligation, not because they're enjoying them. And when people leave those games, it's because they've dealt with so much bullshit that they've had enough and they'd rather just roll the dice on their next game as soon as possible. Harsher penalties just means more AFK killers / suiciding survivors. It won't fix the underlying problem of people not wanting to play out shitty games. To do that, there need to be less shitty games.
---
DBD desperately needs a balance pass. A bunch of maps need an overhaul. Nurse needs nerfed. The M1 killers need buffs pretty much across the board. A bunch of add-ons and offerings, killer and survivor alike, need nerfed.

B-bu-but I should be safe in a locker! That's unfair BHVR!
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstemiousProtectiveNigiriBatChest](https://clips.twitch.tv/AbstemiousProtectiveNigiriBatChest)
---
Shes the cutest killer after all, have you heard her stun squeak?
---
The Addons are shit too now. They nerfed his speed into the ground AND removed speed addons. They nerfed stun time addons after increasing stun time, etc. This character is now worse then Freddy was.
---
- ex legion main
---
it also doesnt take as long for survivors to open gates, no its been double nerfed.
---
Okay so Pig just got the balance equivalent of a back alley beating.
---
KYS phaggot. Thanks.
---
Common BHVR, she is already dead, don't make her even weaker.

---
Iron Maiden shadow buff?
---
Anybody know if you party up with friends if you still have to invite each other after a game?
---
I completely agree they should have left things as is but to be fair saying plenty of boxes doesn't really mean much if you get unlucky and killer camps 2 boxes that happen to contain your key. It's not like you can recheck a box for another rng roll.
---
When did they change the sound?
---
I'll never give up!
---
because i dont like people who make the game less fun?
---
‚ÄúThe pig happens to catch 2 people early in the match‚Äù
---
Yes we should definitely nerf a low tier killer because they could play well
---
I'm primarily a hag/spirit, but have been working my way though a P3 list, getting killers up there to play as the mood strikes me. Pig just got knocked waaaay to the back of the list.
---
Also, I heartily disagree that pig is fun to play against. Only killer that consistantly scares the shit outta me.
---
Stay strong fellow piggy our love for pig shall pave the way to victory in time.
---
As for a good build if ya want try this Spirits fury, enduring,bbq,and nurses calling/make your choice. This build usually works for me and makes me a spooky pig so keep up the good work and goodluck ma dude :)
---
Now two out of Freddy‚Äôs three perks are bad. And the other‚Äôs situational. Poor guy, at least he‚Äôs getting a rework.
---
Which could still be awful.
---
Shit.
---
Billy desperately needs a chainsaw cool down. Every time I vs a Billy I feel like I'm just going in and out of a locker because he hooks, BBQ and Chilli and then downs the next person and just rinse and repeat for the rest of the match. At least Nurse takes skill and she's easier to fuck up if you aren't high skilled.
---
Honestly, I think they did it because they knew that she would be powerful with the new changes and overnerfed to try to prevent the backlash of players being really mad about being unable to get the trap off in the small timetable of the EGC. 
---
However, there are a lot better ways to change her to make people have counter-play to her traps during the EGC. Why not allow any box to get rid of the trap? Or make a "maximum tries", where if you go to say, 3 different boxes you are guarenteed to get the trap off on the 3rd during the EGC? Hell, they could just slow the timer down based on how many survivors have traps.
---
I do think she needed a nerf for the end game changes, but you shouldn't just make her ability COMPLETELY useless.
---
I have; it makes me feel bad when I have to smash a pallet over her head :(
---
Whose saying I haven't played them?
---
Trivia: Do you know that BHVR has poo-poo in their brains?
---
You can't say he's worse than before. He's not top tier but he's no longer cancer.
---
I doubt it'll make that much of a difference but I do like to run Distressing on Pig which kind of sucks.
---
Wow a STREAMER confirmed this? Goddamn I wonder which one it is, normally I'd say Tru3ochidofan but he actually hates legion as much as the rest of us. 
---
Seriously though you gotta separate the real nerfs from the legion nerfs so that people will actually take you semi-seriously, so far anyone complaining about legion nerfs just sounds really dumb to me and everything else they say is tainted by me knowing I'm talking to a dumb guy.
---
We need more positivity in this community bud. Leave or cheer up. Saying stuff like that in person would get you spit on
---
Blood Warden ain‚Äôt bad- just very situational. Badham is... okay I guess, it looks pretty nice, especially with the boiler room underneath the Preschool.
---
Reverse Bear Trap, it is the ability the pig has.
---
Fun to play against?
---
Every Pig just tunnels the guy with the trap on their head.
---
How is this fun?
---
I got this game like 2 weeks ago and I heard people complaining about Legion killer not being that good. He seems super fast to me and I think every match I've been in with him I haven't fared too well.
---
La la la la la la laaaaaaa
---
Thank you kind sir.
---
Well isn't that the whole point of being a god-appointed harvester of souls? A Pig horrifies you, a Billy or a freaking Huntress just makes me go "Ah shit here I go again."
---
First legion now this what‚Äôs next nerf Freddy so you can see him like wraith and his sleep takes a solid minute to work
---
DONT DO THAT BHVR JUST A EXAMPLE
---
I practically never DC, not even when getting hard tunneled or facecamped. Stop making baseless accusations. Ps. Change your attitude and stop being so selfish. You are intentionally trying to ruin other peoples experience in the game. Your kind of people are the worst in the community.
---
Believe it!
---
As a fellow PS4 Huntress player, I have yet to experience this.
---
That‚Äôs a buff
---
This is a lot of moaning about nothing. These changes are simply to prevent her from being complete cheese during end game collapse.
---
That's the spirit!
---
We should get killer counterparts- Freddy as George and Leatherface as Lennie.
---
Why would you possibly speak to people like that?   Hes got a valid point.  If you disagree thats fine.  But dont act like hes an idiot.
---
Yikes, it's the ptb.. have you tried the new legion? He's actually not bad. Pig will probably not go through. And also the end game colapse is for killers so there will be no more hatch stand offs. You are being a huge baby. Relax
---
This wont stop people from farming. And it doesnt prevent them from farming if they run BT, they will still get a stack of WGLF. Just a stupid change to a perk that only gives bloodpoints. They didnt even add an effect to it like ‚ÄúSee the killers aura after an unhook for 4 seconds‚Äù.
---
Id love for you to explain how it's useless
---
Note:I have not played the PTB. This is based on the changes, not gameplay.
---
The Legion has had their base movement speed increased and power decreased. This may seem good, but it will have a bad side effect. Now people will want to heal against him. The Legion power is so bad that you may as well M1. Which means, survivors will now need to heal against him so they don't go down. The games will be longer, and you will be spending a lot of time healing if using self care.
---
The traps we're already pretty bad.
---
She still has Ambush shenanigans, but her traps have gone from bad to worthless.
---
Do we know how exactly they're changing this stuff? (other than legion ofc)
---
idkkkkkk man. It's stuff like this that gets the community going wild. It's almost like a bandwagon of people who want to complain and bitch about BHVR. I'm not happy with the pig nerf but pig literally just got buffed a few patches ago. Buffed crouch speed and surveillance. Idk i think it's important to look at the history of the game
---
He completely negates stealth, so if you're a stealth-focused player, he's extremely aggravating to play against.
---
Currently, I'm on Make Your Choice, BBQ (thank you Shrine!), Butcher and Whispers. I don't have Nurse's Calling/Spirit Fury/Enduring unfortunately, but I DO have Spirit's DLC so I could get it from levels.
---
They only allow survivors to leave via the exit gates if no generators have been done after the RBT is placed.
---
Crazy lag, game-breaking bugs, hacking, or a real-life situation requiring your attention are the only legit reasons to intentionally d/c. Any other reason is just a bullshit rationalization and y'all know it.
---
I'm just highly susceptible to jump scares. Ooof, pig wrecks my calm for games after I play here. 
---
It's why I'm fond of spirit/hag. Wrapping myself in jump scare to protect myself from it.
---
Doesnt work, getting nailed with a pallet around a corner still makes me jump when I play killer
---
the RBT timer was already 2 minutes, end game collapse takes 3 at a minimum. and the RBT is supposed to cause a panic. now it does nothing.
---
If anyone ever moonwalked me, taking a sharp turn or going around a corner would usually throw them off enough. The time decay sucks though, thats the only awful part. Like, i get it, its hard to prepare for that stuff with so many ways around it but why the bear traps..?
---
Deep wounds, totally agree since that timers far less, but the bear traps seem like a different mechanic altogether that should be treated as such... If a Pig is moonwalking you instead of letting you rumble around while hunting the other 3 who are obviously doing gens, that's a detriment to her, and you're working as a good team distraction.
---
Is the timer beeping only when the bear traps timer is going down or depending on the stage its at? Because if its the prior, that makes it even less useful all around given that beeping can help give someone away similar to injured grunts.
---
And don't even get me started on hatch grabs, that's one of my favorite ways to knock some sense into someone who has gotten super cocky. I don't care if you're last alive, you don't deserve a free escape. If the killer is hatch camping, go do gens. If they don't like it they'll shut the hatch. If they don't, take the hit and speed boost when they come after you and beat them back. I get it though, hatch standoffs are a problem because when you're last alive apparently you can't do any gens or bait the killer or anything?
---
There are countless solutions we as a playerbase could attempt or invoke in these moments but instead it comes down to 'i dont like it, remove it.' With no attempts around it. 'He just stood there for 20 minutes and wouldn't move from the hatch' 'they just stood at the exit gate and i couldnt escape forever', we see that crap on here so much. Accept the loss, or get creative... Bodyblocking though is a whole other issue. Idk. I could ramble for ages about how you're playing against a person and there are countless other things that could be tried but it won't change the outlook most people have.
---
Its not hard to get friends to play with, I just use steam discussions so they can just do that 
---
Also 
---
You're basically calling Discord a perk
---
How does chaining hits help you down someone?
---
What did they do to Bill's perk?
---
Or a Feng Min character model that is actually as cute as the concept art.
---
Why did you waste your money on a console?
---
He's the easiest killer in the game to play against. Just stay separate and heal and he's powerless to stop survivors.
---
I‚Äôve done this so much my friends have memed it.
---
I won't rest until it becomes a reality.
---
Who is making baseless accusations, the one with video evidence or the one with zero video evidence?
---
How is me killing them ruining their experience, that‚Äôs literally the point of the game? Am I supposed to flip a coin and decide to let people live or not???
---
i had a glitch yesterday which had the wiggle prompt constantly through the game
---
Patch Notes
---
\- Fixed issue with players being able to win as pig
---
Pig got a Nerf for tourism. They figured her power would be ridiculously unfun during endgame, which we can't know for certain what is most likely true. The other Nerf coincides with the legion Nerf specifically dealing with moonwalking. Whether a crouching Pig affects it is another question.
---
With the massive killer buff that is end game why are people surprised that killers are receiving changes to their powers? I don't think the terror radius was necessary, but within game you could literally trap someone in close hatch, why shouldn't the last survivor be allowed to leave through the exit gates? They still have to get an exit gate open, the entire point of endgame was making games playable and not stalled out when there is only one Survivor left.
---
It doesnt but it gives legion map pressure and you can now use the fact you can see survivors locations with frenzy
---
...the stickyed post on the top of the subreddit has everything in it
---
&amp;gt;I hope BHVR fires whoever made this decision
---
Jfc dude, you want someone to lose their job because you don't like some changes ~~you haven't even played yet~~?
---
Boys*
---
Duh. If you would, you would know the Hatchets are just as messed up on Survivor as killer.
---
Hell in the small amount of time I played huntress I don't remember having any problem at all with Hatchets
---
Survivor can still do gens
---
As someone living in Ohio amongst fields of corn, I am excited to have a dedicated server near me.
---
Just plop in a new killer. ez
---
An inferior whispers is not worth the traps no longer doing anything
---
True but that applies to all the female characters, all of them look like some kind of drug addicts...

This is absolutely horrible, everyone was excited about the Pig's potential for tense end game collapses. They gutted a mid tier killer because they couldn't be bothered adjusting her toolkit for the upcoming changes, horrendous stuff overall.
---
I think someone in BHVR got bodied one too many times by a Pig main.
---
This has no reason to be as funny as it is.
---
If they don't un nerf her then I have lost all faith in this stupid dev team
---
All I see is a whiny killer, who has no skill. Get better and these won't be a problem to you.
---
Yeah but legion needed to be changed he was worse then aids
---
Spirits fury and enduring are a really strong combo and ends chases really fast id invest some bp's into spirit and hillbilly just for those two perks .
---
Whispers isnt my cup of tea but i see why is good 
---
I like butcher too just that combo is real spicy so no room for it
---
[deleted]
---
What I particularly like about spirit is that the whooshing noise stops almost all genny progress b/c no one wants nabbed.
---
If you're asking for a date, forget it! Cause I make a point to no go out with women who hook me in the basement!
---
Pig players that tunnel will tunnel regardless of if this changes or not. You can change the killer schematics but you cannot change the player that uses the killer... tunnelers will tunnel.
---
If they're gonna shit on the RBT's to accommodate the end-game collapse, at least buff the charge attack. We all know it could use the buff, and Ms. Piggy was never all that strong to begin with.
---
He is worse then before lmao. At least before you could chain the feral frenzy. Good luck doing that with the nerfs.
---
If it said ‚Äòpotato‚Äô, then yes it would fit there. But it‚Äôs a direct reference to an actual line- it‚Äôs not random, it‚Äôs dumb but funny humour.
---
I dont get how they can keep nurse, billy, noed, rancor in the game but nerf pig and remember me, its just insane
---
Best way to counter her is to give her a snoot boop
---
Laurie I'm looking at you.
---
&gt; Some people need to remember this is for the PTB. The last PTB had changes that were changed again when it went live for everyone.
---
Only the ones that were good for killer didn't go through. All the ones that were good for survivors went through. There's no reason to believe that the Pig, Legion, Remember Me, End Game, and gate changes won't go through. Past behavior are indicative of future actions.
---
Save the hyperbole.  DC punishment is needed and coming
---
Why remove hatch interrupts?
---
One of the most exciting moments for a killer is to catch a survivor just as they're about to escape. I don't see why this is necessary for Endgame since survivors could just do gens/open the gates if the killer decides to camp hatch.
---
Did I come off that way or something? I didn't mean to if so
---
Probably because of the Hatch changes. Since opening the exit gates when you're the only player left is basically a death sentence.
---
Question here, what will happen to Left Behind?
---
Maybe but still gives killer a notification.
---
People are complaining about the pig's meme build to use rbts after the gates are powered?
---
Most pig's use 2 cages early-game a d 2 cages mid-game before the gates are powered. For them this changes nothing. Active RBTs still can't leave through gate. You can still shit hatch for last guy. And you can still crouch cheese since it erases your TR.
---
My thoughts:
---
Why are doors being buffed? Did ANYONE think 20 *cumulative* seconds to open a door was too much? This is just... unnecessary.
---
Removal of hatch grabs means mid-chase hatch escapes are impossible to prevent. Again, why do this?
---
Calm Spirit buff has made Doctor completely useless, along with Plague's ONE good perk; Infectious Fright.
---
Pig nerfs make complete sense, but she needs a compensatory buff. Perhaps drop trap timers to 2 min?
---
Collapse should start after the last gen is done, NOT when the doors are open.
---
Legion update is not quite as bad as I feared. With these add-ons, I believe he'll sitjust above Spirit.
---
It doesn't seem like BHVR will be addressing the chase music, breathing and footstep audio problems. Not sure if I can put up with them much longer, especially given scratchmarks will be near-invisible during the collapse.
---
Overall, not excited for this update at all.
---
Now we do!
---
I loved it on trapper, now it's trash. was the centerpiece of my fave build on him. I also loved Pig. so two things I paid money for just got made trash. good luck getting me to buy the next chapter BHVR.
---
also, note the fact that the gates dont take as long to fix. so remember me got double nerfed.
---
It was the first time I ever saw one bugged like that. I just let them complete it since it seemed like a pain for the survivors to do it right next to killer shack. Got the 4k anyway but it would've been incredibly easy to 3 gen since there was another gen very close.
---
Just found it kinda funny overall
---
Inactive traps won't kill you if you try to leave, making it pointless to use any once the gens are done.
---
Additionally, their timer won't advance when in the terror radius, which was unneeeded.
---
I love crouching around the corner and watching survivors repair generators, and gambling on hitting them to make it blow up in their face.
---
This aged very poorly very quickly.
---
that one actually got easier.
---
Freddy might have a thing or two to say to you about nerfs...
---
;(
---
So don't farm your teammates?
---
Not at all my friend!
---
i would rather End Game Collapse not happen at all than have the shit they've done to Pig and Remember Me.
---
Adjusted controller joystick inputs to allow for better movement control.
---
Wait, like sensitivity or what? I don't really get this
---
The Remember Me nerf is the baffling of all tbh
---
Yeah, but trapping once gens are done is useless now, which fucking sucks.
---
Nurse now has 10% movement speed, and blinks are a set 5 meter teleport. You can only decrease and increase this value with addons. A new iridescent quality addon is added for nurse. It sets movement speed to 120% and disables blinking.
---
I'm willing to bet this is just a place holder animation.
---
Trap Buff: Make them beep and flash even when not ‚Äúactive‚Äù to allow Pig to at least track her Trapped victims a little easier. I know you can hear the trap kind of ‚Äúrattle‚Äù when a Survivor is running, but make it beep too.
---
How is bloodhound op on legion
---
Still excited for end game collapse testing in the meantime.
---
If that's even there ...
---
Fixing a bug isn't a nerf.
---
Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Hope and Borrowed Time are the only survivor perks I‚Äôd consider strong because of how they warp the game when they proc. The rest are average or meme tier aka not worth running. Yeah let me take the new and improved Left Behind when the killer closes the hatch and prevents generators from being worked on. Let me take Deja Vu so I know where some generators are. Let me take Up the Ante so I can throw the game by trying to Kobe
---
Its the same thing with killer. BBQ, Nurses, Whispers, Ruin, Monitor, Spirit Fury and Enduring are the only strong killer perks worth running. The rest are average or meme tier. I was hoping for a perk overhaul this PTB and instead we got a complicated way to say ‚Äú3 minute timer when gates are powered‚Äù, a nerf to WGLF and Remember Me and an amazing ‚Äúrework‚Äù to Left Behind
---
You are absolutely right. I was just pointing out a possible positive in this depressing time to be a pig player.
---
wait what did they do to pig
---
Between Legion and Pig, I really wanna know what the hell these devs are smoking.
---
&gt; to be honest I am quite fed up with that shit
---
Keep blaming the players for the devs not fixing things, enjoy the DCs ;)
---
Third Seal was actually useful on Plague. Now that‚Äôs gone. Back to never using that perk again which sucks because I really like it but there are much better options for Hex perks.
---
what the fuck i play pig all the time what did they do
---
I'm asking for pig and legion refunds. They broke both killers. Legion was garbage to begin with. Now he's useless. Pig took a massive nerf with rbt not being an issue at endgame
---
If the killer is even remotely close, or if they like to rubber band to and from the hook you are fuvked. But hey better to let your teammate die than to possibly farm them
---
According to players like you we've been dying/dead since Oct 2016. And yet here we all are.
---
Not this, chief.
---
As a Legion main, I won't quit. I play for fun, not based on how good a killer is.
---
Right now pig has the ability to *choose* when to use reverse bear traps, but with this nerf, she'll have to use them every time she downs a survivor.
---
It doesn't help that most gens pop in pairs of 2, meaning that you'll only get to use an average of 3 traps per game. And that's being generous.
---
Oh yeah, you're right, I totally forgot about that very special "make games less fun" DNA built in every single one of us russians. While the entire rest of the world population is free from this sad condition being fun, cheerful and friendly people like you, yes.
---
Same man, only spirit grans. I laugh and call em idiots... knowing full well that I would have done that and probably also thrown my mouse
---
I'm really glad for the dedicated servers but not having any servers in Western Asia/Eastern Europe is kinda disappointing for me. I hope players there remain on P2P until they add servers in those areas.
---
I was thinking of a meme Legion build with the change where you keep frenzy hitting the obsession for Remember Me stacks since they cant die from frenzy, dont even know if frenzy hits give stacks but that idea is just dead
---
Somewhat new player here, I tried asking this before but didn't get a response
---
If you purchase a DLC killer with the in-game currency, do you just lose out on the content that comes with them if you had bought the dlc instead?
---
There's no way to obtain that content unless you purchase the dlc with real cash but then you would be paying for a killer you could already have?
---
Keep in mind this is just the PTB. Everyone who's upset with it needs to reach out to the devs via q&amp;a, forums, etc. This is the point of the PTB.
---
Crouchwalk to save Sprint Burst, unhook Survivor, then bust ass outta there
---
It now gives a 75% repair speed buff per gen when you're the last one alive instead of 25%.
---
The problem is, when the killer closes the hatch the gates are automatically powered.
---
He's wealth with speed boost instead of cloak now. Not as horrible as the changes seemed on paper, but he's still just a glorified M1er
---
Played spirit, they broke my haunted grounds instead of ruin, 2 dcs and no gens done.
---
So your idea of fun is making things miserable for other people? Cool, we know what kind of person you are at least
---
EVERYONE's trust in the devs
---
I've always thought the pig was one of the more fun killers to play against as survivor. It gave more things to do during the game without it getting too overwhelming. I'm really disappointed they nerfed her because I know people are going to play her less now. :(
---
That's on the survivors to stop 3 gen strats from happening.
---
And i responded to the wrong person. . . .    excuse me im going to go sit in the corner of coldwind and think about what ive done
---
I would be fine with the changes if they started counting down immediately instead of waiting for a gen to start.
---
Or you just don't unsafe hook and you'll get your stack regardless. Unless the killer is camping it's very easy to get a safe hook rescue.
---
Pig kills 3 survivors, has caught the last survivor at least once before, and manages to find the hatch and close it before the last survivor.  The pig won, but instead of allowing her to use the power, she is stripped of it to allow the survivor one last chance.  But it's not just that scenario, she is stripped of her power in ALL endgame scenarios.  Because the last survivor on that one scenario didn't get enough chances (minimum got caught, lost chase, didn't remove RBT whilst other survivor(s) were killed, didn't find hatch).
---
They just increased the value to 75% instead of 25%.
---
Though with hatch changes, the perk is even more useless. It spawns when you're the last survivor regardless of having a couple gens done or not. And if it gets closed you can just go open a gate.
---
There is literally ZERO reason to ever touch a gen when you're the last one standing now making the niche use of Left Behind pointless.
---
Valid if they‚Äôre close enough. I was specifically recalling a time when someone crouch walked from halfway across the map until I was already struggling and the killer was never near them.
---
Can confirm
---
Source: username
---
Same thing happened to my friend with a Freddy
---
Devs, left behind is already useless and will be even more useless once the killer can just close the hatch
---
BHVR: Dont worry, we‚Äôre reworking a lot of perks for End Game collapse! Here you go, Left behind percentage increase! You do gens 65% faster!
---
i dont know what i expected.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
says the manchild
---
Long Killer queues? It takes me twenty seconds tops to find a Killer game. Sometimes I legit can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm going against a SWF or if they‚Äôre just loading in that fast. Meanwhile it takes three to five minutes to find a survivor match. This is in prime time, by the way.
---
Honestly, one of my favorite quotes from DbD and salty fan boys still take it literally to heart.
---
I took that advise and still enjoy DBD. Because I dont beat it to death playing nothing else
---
Of course they nerf The Pig who is already not that good to begin with (I am a Pig Main) but don't do anything to top tier killers like the broken ass Nurse. Of course.
---
ya, that's right
---
Forgive me for asking but I‚Äôm not in the loop. What‚Äôs the nerf exactly?
---
Or, you could (crazy thought, I know) actually read my comment. If the Killer likes to stay within range of the hook with necessarily camping, you are fucked. Or rather, the dude on the hook is fucked
---
&gt;ates of the SWF and not the killer where the actual conflict and balance problem exists
---
You can't balance around SWF using voice chat when solos without voice chat exist, Once you buff solos to SWF levels then you can buff killers, slow down gens, add another objective for survivors, etc.
---
That's a massive assumption. Nowhere do you have evidence of me doing that nor do you have any reason to suspect it.
---
its like these nerfs were decided by someone who doesnt play or understand the game.
---
You are getting downvoted all to hell for saying what needs to be said.  I don't agree with some of the Pig nerfs, but honestly how many times did you see killer mains licking their lips and wanking off to the idea of RBT + Blood Warden + Remember Me + NOED + EGC?   
---
Maybe a bit too far, but something needed to be fixed before EGC.
---
Rip Remember Me. You will be remembered.
---
This made me realize that the Scream Queens killer would make a great licensed DLC.
---
When I play spirit, my Devour Hope totem pretty much always survives untill I have 3 tokens
---
They tripled the numbers
---
The most incompetent set of developers I have ever had the misfortune of being exposed to.
---
Good job. You have essentially stolen my money- again.
---
Maybe it's time to go back to making such classics as The Grinch on the PS1, Behaviour.
---
**TRI-SWO-TRICKST-SWORDMAS-ROYAL-TRICK-SWORDMASTER!**
---
*-gets air combo‚Äôd in front of a Gen for 3 minutes-*
---
Nerf Legion into the ground: check
---
Nerf the Pig for no good reason: check
---
Nerf Remember Me: check 
---
Then people wonder why there's a certain meta. The game doesn't even try to let you play around and experiment with certain play styles because certain shit is flat out useless. Fucking ridiculous.
---
Darn. And Frick might have some competition here
---
You‚Äôre implying that one singular person just decided, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm gonna make all of these changes to the Pig,‚Äù and proceeded to do so with absolutely no consultation with anyone else. That‚Äôs a little bit unrealistic, don‚Äôt you think?
---
Or have it happen and dont toutch Pig unless it is a buff
---
Is it that annoying lol. I have only played against Freddy twice and it hasn't been recent enough to remember if it is that bad.
---
I'm not making accusations. Also, the survivors in your video were absolutely awful, so your video means jack shit. Also you were accusing me of dcing, and that is a baseless accusation no matter how you put it. On one hand I'm happy you're not on PC, but on the other I want to face you just to get you off your high horse.
---
I mean, I run No Mither, so what's the worse that can happen? The killer being able to down me in 1 hit?
---
*To see a Pig in a grain of sand, and a Hag in a wildflower..*
---
Unless you were using the perk to farm via unsafe hook dives there's no reason this change should affect you. It rewarded dumbasses that would unhook next to the killer.
---
I made a similar thread earlier after I tried him on the PTB and he actually is pretty decent in my opinion.
---
I was also watching Zubat and he also thinks the changes were good.
---
The strong killers stay strong (nurse, billy, etc) while the mid tier killers get butchered (legion, pig).
---
It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt know what balance is
---
My guess is that it's supposed to make things a little easier on survivors who have the hatch closed on them but they didn't want to give an opening speed buff in just that instance for some reason
---
Normally I say "People wait for the PTB before we react to any balance changes" but... holy shit have I lost ALL my faith in these devs, like people want issues solved that ARENT MID TIER KILLERS.  Hitboxes, annoying perks on both sides, face camping, dsiconnecting, hitboxes, the extreme levels of toxicity... holy shit they nerf things they were fine.
---
Ey I got my copy paste for tomorrow ready!
---
Assuming they don‚Äôt make any other unnecessary changes (like hiding the trap‚Äôs progress from the killer), I think you just found the silver lining. Bravo to you.
---
Dear BHVR, GIVE US BACK THE FIXED MATCH MAKING!!!! Fixed it about 2 weeks ago and today or yesterday reverted it back to the broken state that everybody hated again......For 4 hours i could not find any local AU servers only 200 ping Asian/NA servers and 400 ping EU servers, IN PEAK TIME AT 6PM! what is that about?
---
what exactly are they doing to pig
---
They removed the catch animation if I'm not mistake. If the survivor gets to the hatch, he escapes.
---
It's fun on Trapper, Billy, Nurse, Hag, Spirit and Doctor, maybe I missed someone.
---
(Some of the killers named do require special addons)
---
That's not a real kill. That's narrowing your counter play until there is none. No mistakes on the survivor are involved other than getting down initially. So if you get down once the gens pops you struggle to get the rbt off but cant go near some of the boxes that are camped so either you try to take if off where the killer is and you go down. Or you try to run out of the gates and die or you stay and the collapse kills you. It's because the same principle as facecamping. You cant really do anything and you get punished for being downed once when most players get 3 downs. That's the issue.
---
That's a fair point. But wouldn't that mean we're getting more updates in a shorter timespan?
---
Yet review bombing and mass dcing wasn't?
---
Classic WoW will have a shorter life span than people give it. Also they cant touch Nurse since it seems the amount of viable killers is falling
---
At that point, some people are just dc'ing because their teammates did, not because of Legion him/herself though.
---
I suggest that Remember Me doesn't affect this instead.
---
Yeah killer was rotating open gate and other gate when I had a helmet on and escaped on second box had to deadhard to get away
---
Awesome. Will likely buy
---
Its even more stupid if you think about it that they actually forced the old version of it back - it is based on TR, not chase. That added thing that even when you are crouched (and have 0 TR) you can still get in chase. Now it doesn‚Äôt matter and you can do old trick with following trapped and activated survivor crouched until they die, if they try toremove you just stand up to catch them. Stupid the same as endgame for her is...
---
she would have been the same as she was before during collapse. now she's worse and her power is made useless.
---
Except you could have just made the RBT slow down the EGC as opposed to these changes that also affect her mid trial
---
Legion being practically removed is a good change. Nobody liked him.
---
Good killers didn't like him. Survivors didn't like him.
---
*‚ÄúMaking things miserable for other people‚Äù*
---
Dick, it‚Äôs a game where you kill people. Am I supposed to tuck them in and feed them Oreos?
---
I'm fine with requiring safe unhooks for a WGLF stack but they need to consider giving survivors some other benefit for running it or drastically increasing what gives you a stack.
---
I'd be willing to accept Pig changes if unhooking or smacking a survivor also started the timer. That's more consistent with the Sacred Texts, anyway - when a person starts moving in a Jigsaw trap, that's when things start ticking.
---
Fixing bugs is not a nerf.
---
Blood Warden is godly in my opinion. So was Remember Me :(
---
See they're more to cover my weaknesses of "Being new so I have no map awareness of hiding places" and "Literally only playing Pig so I don't have any special status effects from my weapon"
---
Not to me I actually like it. I was wondering how come nobody ever plays Freddy and I never played against him. Then in my match I heard the voices singing and the screen turned white. Freddy then proceeded to whoop my ass.
---
What? I'm literally just stating facts that the playerbase is shrinking and has been since October 2018
---
For the team
---
yet they could of made something good from him, but i guess i shouldn't expect anything from the devs...
---
Cant
---
Wait why is the pig there? I haven‚Äôt read or seen anything on the PTB so is she getting changed?
---
They were annoying before, now they are bad.
---
Exactly! I laugh but then I'm like "Yo that's just me from 2 games ago"
---
you can leave if the trap is put on after the gates are open, or after the last gen is finished. it wont activate unless its on you when a generator gets finished.
---
so her power now disappears after gen are done.
---
Haha. Never playing against Freddy made me "main" him. Funny to see people confused by him and I think they underestimate him. Thanks for the response!
---
&gt; Wglf nerf* now, unless you tun borrowed, it is entirely in the hands of the killer whether or not you get your stack. Killer likes to tunnel? Tough luck, go fuck yourself.
---
You never mention camping. And if the killer is camping then the person on the hook is already pretty fucked, but that also tremendously hurts the killer's chance to pip. I've been using WGLF for a long time without farming and it's fine.
---
I won't be buying any more DLC unless this and the Remember me nerf are reversed.
---
Lithe is also good. Self care combined with botany knowledge is half decent as well. Decisive is still good it's just more specifically for those who tend to get downed fast off a hook and teammates dont run borrowed.
---
Your list of killer perks that are viable is only half of them though. You missed discordance, noed, surveillance on high mobility killers, as well as things like make your choice. 
---
Plus people overrate enduring spirit fury. Once they know you have it they will drop pallets early instead of try for the stun. It has an effect sure but it just is a decent time saver for 2 perks.
---
Should we tell them?
---
yea, her traps will become almost useless and completely useless in the endgame.
---
Lmao thanks op this was a good read
---
Survivors exploit many issues in the game as part of the meta for years and developers encourage it: I sleep.
---
Legion exploits an issue: REAL SHIT
---
They buffed him to 75%. The point is that the hatch will spawn no matter how many gens are done, so why do I need to lose time by doing gens? If the killer finds the hatch and closes it, the doors will open and you won't be able to do gens. So, what is the purpose of the perk? It's like a Surveillance prebuff.
---
Mods, why isnt this post pinned?
---
&gt;yet they could of made something good from him, but i guess i shouldn't expect anything from the devs...
---
Gutting him completely called for a more immediate action than giving him a proper viability, which would take longer (Freddy is an example). People were DCing left and right simply because it wasn't enjoying to play against him.
---
If they keep these piggy changes as they are after the PTB I seriously begin to doubt the balance teams ability to properly adjust their game...  
---
Big yikes.  
---
\#PrayForPig
---
It's also very effective against the Nurse granted she swings and then enters the fatigue stage
---
Heyyyy be noiiice
---
I get that but being the only player left should be risky as you had 3 other players who should be alive on your team. Hatch changes were enough. Gate changes probably not needed.
---
Aint that a big ol oof
---
They will more than likely add more areas eventually, and I'm sure they will keep the other ares on P2P in the mean time.
---
Keeping in theme somewhat, butchering her. She's already mid to low tier, and they're basically neutering the reverse beartraps so that they have a wide range of inactivity triggers. So since they'll be near useless, all she can therefore do is charge. Hillbilly can charge, and he can OHKO with his. Nurse can go through walls. At least Legion has quick miss recovery on their charge. Now it feels like ol' Amanda doesn't have an identity any more.
---
&gt;Survivors exploit many issues in the game as part of the meta for years and developers encourage it: I sleep. Legion exploits an issue: REAL SHIT
---
Give some examples.
---
deadhard w sprint burst xD
---
Don't really notice any difference.
---
I don't get the joke, can someone explain?
---
I love this magical scenario you have created where a killer who is not Nurse or Billy can literally be everywhere at once.
---
RNG power on a weak killer that encourages tunneling doesnt sound really fun to play against. Pigs can win games or lose games based on trap RNG. Everyone could have played exactly the same way and the match could go from all 4 dead to 3 escape based off box RNG.
---
Can you imagine when he gets you trapped in his nightmare he would say "Welcome to my world bitch!"
---
Well for one we need a company that has a good track record of multiplayer games, balance, map and character creation.. im drawing a blank
---
I want to give u the reddit award for this lol. How do I do it??
---
Pig, Myers, and Spirit are my favorite to verse. Not because of their tiers, but because they can actually be scary
---
People disconnect while being facecamped in the basement?
---
I still don't get the fucking Remember Me nerf. Do they want to make it useless now? The whole point was the long gate time for everyone but the obsession, so you could fool around longer in endgame.
---
Now the gates will open so fast, even with six stacks of Remember Me there'll be an even harder time managing exit gate pressure. BHVR what the fuck are ya doin?
---
I suppose it is because the "Overpowered" stuff is more intrusive and gets noticed more. Everybody knows what the bad perks are (and there are a lot of bad perks) but probably just don't care about them enough to want them to be good.
---
I don't know if downvoting is really silencing since you can still view the comment. It's the equivalent of getting boo's or cheer's from the audience.
---
It's very noble of you to want to give him the benefit of the doubt and I do try to give it to most people in most circumstances but in this specific scenario I'm fairly certain he's not being honest and I would rather not be taken advantage of.
---
The way I see it is downvoting is just an easy way to say "I agree/like this" or "I disagree/dislike this". So if your comment or post has a lot of downvotes it just means that people disagree with it or dislike it. For instance I made a post about how I felt about the Legion changes and it was downvoted simply because people disagreed with me, nothing more and nothing less.
---
Of course there is the dilemma that downvoting makes a post less visible but in real life ideas that you like are going to be parroted to others moreso than ideas you dislike so I don't think it's all that different or worse than the natural biases that are accrued throughout daily life.
---
Also I think you underestimate how bad Ochido culture has been for the game.
---
If that were the case I would buy all of Freddy's skins. Oh wait. (Would be really cool and funny as hell though. Pls give Freddy skins.)
---
I just read about the bullshit nerf, and it just feels like spitting on an already suboptimal killer
---
The risk isn't high. The risk happens when survivors just don't cleanse the totem, or do it at a time where you can't get to any healthy survivors. The reward isn't high either it's uncommon to get more than 1 insta down with the perk. If you were to make it look different, it would only be high risk.
---
Also, tge intention is actually not to give the killer a high risk high reward, but make cleansing hex totems for the survivor high risk high reward.
---
What use would haunted grounds have if it never gets cleansed? It would be risk only. There would only be a reward in the lowest of ranks where survivors can't tell the difference between a haunted grounds totem and other totems
---
Why are you checking my other posts lmao. Stalker alert!! 
---
How do I make my profile private yikes!
---
I get its strong, but I believe it's one of the only perks that has numerous viable counters to it. It might be because I haven't played against it, but it seems fair. Especially since I believe they removed the movement speed it gives the killer
---
Bruuh her,stun squeak is so cuteee
---
they came completly out of nowhere and were pretty insane for something that was slipped in like this
---
Will do
---
You didn‚Äôt hear about the new huntress nerf? There now is a chance to render the killer useless when trying to throw a hatchet. Balance for endgame update of course.
---
I feel like Legion is actually decent with the changes.
---
Are you running around and disliking all of my comments hahahaha. I found the guy!!
---
Abusing poor hitboxes which makes bodyblocking easier than it should be, pallet vacuums, infinite pallet loops, infinite window loops.
---
Now I have that idea in my mind, like the legion but better!
---
Does this means I'm screwed if I live in Central America? :(
---
Fucking same here
---
Anyone notice that Frank's mixtape is still around and just gives legion his old power back of being able to take down the timer in FF? The most hated add-on in the game will be even more hated now... lol
---
ive looked into it any now if you go to gates they dont trigger ????
---
not really. before they would do a lot of smaller updates when it came to figures and such. Now they do it all those changes at once with small updates usually just being stuff they could change from the backend while not visually changing anything on our end i.e. Survivor Pip requirements was like 2.6.3 or some chizz instead of being 2.7
---
There is nothing fair involved in this game my friend. Hell, survivors can't even fight back, just run.
---
I am axe slinger
---
Buff Left Behind, a useless perk before and more useless now: check.
---
I was beyond freaked. I thought to my self "oh shit, I'm fucking running!" And now I found out it didn't mean I'm highlighted haha
---
Her main selling point wasnt the traps lethality lmao. What a bunch of dramatic crybabies. Her selling point was that her RNG power could either waste ALOT of time, almost no time at all or a little a bit of time and the game would swing in/against your favor based on box RNG.
---
Well Pig cosplays have been around for more than a decade now...
---
No no, its okay, it happens to the best of us. The two of us made up though, they apologized so its all okay too! Smile, don't frown, everything worked out!
---
First Legion
---
Now Pig
---
DONT YOU DARE NERF RIN!
---
No, it doesn't. It's only INACTIVE RBTs that won't pop. If your RBT time is active and you try to leave via the gate, you're still dead.
---
FUCK
---
It's just perspective. Not everyone plays killer. When I come up against a SWF, I just see it as a challenge to see how well I can do. I'm not disappointed if I fail miserably. It's an entirely different game against a team, so I can't hold myself to those standards.
---
Yeah, on r the exits are opened I tend to play hero. But I've been told not to. After all, if I die, then that's two people who didn't win
---
At least the pig can get rid of her terror radius
---
And what about the barrage of other nerfs and a new end game that heavily favors survivors?
---
Yep. You know how there's a WHOLE ACHIEVEMENT BUILT AROUND THIS AS A METHOD OF BEATING GENRUSHING? Yeah.
---
No one's talking about it because no one uses this perk and no one noticed it. Should be fixed tho
---
What PS4?
---
WAIT. BLOODWARDEN IS NOW A TOP META PERK
---
Can someone give me a link to where I can find these changes?
---
Haha i think everyone playing this game has had at least one of these moments and looks back at it now and again.
---
i love pig so much i play her all the time on my xbox account what the fuck ima CRY.
---
&gt;Abusing poor hitboxes which makes bodyblocking easier than it should be, pallet vacuums, infinite pallet loops, infinite window loops.
---
I see... You are a new player. 
---
Bodyblocking = free hits for the killer.
---
&gt;pallet vacuums 
---
Not a thing anymore and pallets are even not working properly since they removed vacuums. 
---
&gt;infinite pallet loops, infinite window loops.
---
Not a thing since bloodlust and entity blocker were implemented.
---
Can someone explain me the point of Left Behind? It was useless before, now that the hatch spawns even if there are still 5 generators to do and the killer being able to close it and power doors... What is the reason of this perk?
---
It really does feel like the Endgame Collapse is just a pretense to buff survivors. They‚Äôve lowered the time it takes to open the door. The Pig‚Äôs traps no longer prevent people from leaving the trial. Remember was nerfed. Deep Wound was buffed universally for survivors. And Legion was nerfed into the ground (oh, sorry: ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a different play style‚Äù). All this for a mechanic that puts a limit on how long survivors can troll at the end of a match. It even stops the timer if they get caught.
---
If you put a trap on a survivor when all gens are done nothing will happen
---
A while ago they fucked things up as usual. Pretty sure it got fixed but everyone was pissed
---
RBT only become active when a generator is completed so now survivors have no real pressure to get them off and they can‚Äôt be used once all the gens are done.
---
we do ask for buffs tho, we just don't want powercreep to happen
---
"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE nerf Legion!" Say's the spoiled phaggot who cried and cried and cried and ragequit as many times as he wanted to get his way in a video game.
---
I don't even play her a lot and I was still confused why the nerf? Nobody even plays her lol.
---
whats the point of saving traps now wtf
---
Revert the nerf to Pig, she was already low enough.
---
Killer mains rise up but is to scared to use his legit account lol
---
Too bad it‚Äôs nerfed, R.I.P. PS4
---
It‚Äôs a really horrible version of the ‚ÄúWhen you drive over a speed bump at preschool but there was no speed bump‚Äù implying that you ran over a kid.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really work in this case with Michael Myers because.. yknow.. he‚Äôs a human. Not a car.
---
Lmao that would be great
---
Not ‚Äúuseless.‚Äù They just sucked the most fun part of them out: putting them on people at endgame to keep them from escaping.
---
It's a fun game for those moments. Definitely gives me a laugh a lot of times
---
I like him, he looks mid-tier to me. still fun to play as and finally exploit-free.
---
I'd do worse than spit on you, bud if you acted like how you are right now in person.
---
I am going to link you to some matches of me getting 12 hooks against trams of glowing claudettes with flashlights. 
---
A lot of my matches I have a 0% Proximity to hooked survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt actually fucking play like this lmao. God everyone on this reddit takes everything so serious lol.
---
None so just use them to slow the game down now that‚Äôs all they will be good for now. To me they should have just made the end fame timer pause or something
---
not only that but I don‚Äôt think a lot of people realize the terror radius nerf was added because pigs could abuse moonwalking just like legions could.
---
Most likely internal testing showed that applying RBT during the endgame collapse was broken. Like, if pig downed anyone during the collapse and put on a RBT, they were 100% dead. 
---
Before, you had all the time in the world to get it off (well, outside of being caught obviously). But you could be real sneaky and make your way to each one and still have a chance. And if nothing else, you could always wait around for everyone else to leave and get the hatch. 
---
Now, you can't wait. There is no waiting. You have to run to each box quickly to get the damn thing off....and there might not even be a hatch. 
---
If this is the case, they could have either said this, or left it as is and let the PTB showcase that this was actually really strong.....then throw out a "lets try this to see if it fixes it"
---
If you want to pull rank, I've been playing since the start, but much more actively in the recent year. The changes they made were significant this I admit, but it's not enough to overlook some of the glaring problems that still exist today, most notably the infinite loading screen bug that's been massacring lobbies for months. So I have to question what you mean by "Taking care of the game". Because one of the most destructive bugs has been Taking care of the game lately.
---
&gt; Just crouch. Let those people think they'll be safe. And you can still follow them without pausing the timer
---
Except shes the slowest character in the entire game when crouched. So if you follow them while crouched they can perfectly outrun you, to either go to a box or at least lose you entirely. Also, like that youll be wasting more of your own time than the survivors.
---
The timer for safe unhook is not that long. It's not hard to get them in most games. Yeah it'll suck some games but oh well. I'd rather discourage farming.
---
The dlc pack in the store gives you the survivor and killer. When you buy it with in-game currency it is the same price if you buy both the survivor and killer.
---
Did you read the notes?
---
I will say this much: just had a PTB match where I trapped up a Kate and hooked her a few seconds before the last gen popped. Unhooked, exit gates open, collapse triggers, she goes right for the gate and kaboom. Maybe that's more a lesson about not skimming the patch notes, but I can see the incentive for Pig and Survivor to mix up their trap-and-endgame strategies. It'll still be a hard nerf once everyone gets their bearings, but after my disappointment with the news, that was a pretty good laugh.
---
It would make more sense to have at least had it ***Slow down*** the timer perhaps more so then a hooked/dying survivor rather then render it completely useless. perhaps they tried this first internally and found it too strong still...idk but as it is pig loses most of her power now when gates are opened unlike other killers who are unaffected.
---
It should only allow them through the gates if there are no other survivors left/the hatch has been closed by the killer
---
I don‚Äôt get why everyone‚Äôs going fucking bonkers over the pig nerf when this is only a PTB and this shit can be easily changed before this goes live. The whole point of the PTB is so the player base can critique changes, y‚Äôall acting like it‚Äôs gonna be permanent. But I do agree that the nerfs are unnecessary.
---
Next thing we know they'll nerf fire up.
---
I'm really liking Ruin, Whispers, Monitor &amp; Enduring.  
---
The Whispers + Monitor combo easily helps you find people, avoid running into dead zones (where no survs are) and let's you sneak up on people very easily (go into crouch the moment you approach a gen and whispers pops up)  
---
As addons I like using Combat Belt + Shattered Syringe.
---
Her traps no longer trigger going through exit gates, still dont activate via hatch escape.
---
Oh and also don't tick down if said survivor is in the terror radius, regardless of chasing/seeing.
---
Traps = Deep Wound apparently to the devs.
---
at this point I have lost absolutely all hope in them...
---
Now it‚Äôs downing 25 survivors while they are affected with Deep Wounds. So basically just use your power 25 times.
---
I'd be fine(r) with the nerfs if there were still some way to activate the traps - whack a survivor or hook them, for example.
---
Pig got a nerf too
---
It honestly might be worth just rushing the gens, if there's only a few left. As soon as the last one goes off you're safe. Seems like a bad change.
---
Moonwalk for 2 minutes, while you can just... Search boxes. Its not a viable strategy in the slightest.
---
Gotcha. I saw in the video that the endgame had started and 4 gens hadn‚Äôt been popped. Thanks for the clarity. I still however think that the Pigs changes aren‚Äôt that bad. All it means is that she would have to save her traps for the endgame (if you‚Äôre wanting to play that way)
---
This change doesnt even effect her that much, its for such a niche scenario I dont see why everyone is freaking out. Its only a niche scenario where you want to put a trap on someone when all generators are powered and all 4 survivors are alive (aka you probably played terribly and deserve to lose). Reddit killers are upset because this scenario happens to them frequently no matter what killer they play and instead of improving to prevent this situation from happening they want to cry about it instead. The traps are active if you put it on their head and the last generator pops.
---
Her ambush is horrible tbh. The roar that it gives before you are even a third charged on the bar half invalidated that power. It‚Äôs only really useful on smaller loops where survivors can‚Äôt see you.
---
Giving the killer the ability to close the hatch is to prevent the survivor from getting a free escape, not to give the killer a free 4K.
---
they can't leave with an active trap. And if you don't manage to put traps on the survivors before the last gen is done... well, you didn't play well and probably din't deserve a win anyway. If you want the survivors to stay in the game, take bloodwarden with you. it's great
---
Left Behind was a non-perk before and it still is now. It is of course disappointing that they didn't make it into something you'd actually want to use, but the same is true of many many more perks in this game, so eh, no change there.
---
Legion was the absolute worst thing to ever happen to this game. The rework was absolutely necessary and longed-for by just about anyone that actually likes playing this game. I do think some of the adjustments will have to be tinkered with (like the decreased vault speeds), but overall, Legion is now a killer that actually plays the game - and I think they are pretty solidly mid tier, at that, given that they still injure survivors with ease and efficiency, doing half a chase's work for them, and can also use Frenzy for cross-map and mid-chase mobility (the latter especially when using fatigue-reducing add-ons). Legion is now a very aggressive and efficient chaser that actually abides by the interactive and engaging mechanics of chase play. Use Enduring and Spirit Fury and Cold Dirt and Joey's and Julie's Mixtape and never look back (pun intended).
---
Pig's original RBT functionality would be downright broken with the current End Game Collapse mechanics. Being RBT'd after a gate is opened would basically guarantee death. The changes are reasonable. I do however think that rather than changing RBT mechanics, they should change the Collapse mechanics to account for them. If a survivor has an RBT on, the timer should slow down, just like it does when a survivor is downed or hooked. RBTs should only stop working if the Pig closes the hatch.
---
What I completely cannot understand is the Remember Me nerf. It does not interact with the Collapse end game whatsoever, since that is only ever active *after* the gates are opened. It does have implications for the Collapse hatch game, increasing the time it takes the last survivor to open the gates and basically making it impossible for them to escape, but really, if 1. you only have one survivor left in the trial, 2. that survivor is not the Obsession, 3. you have found and closed the hatch before they did, 3. you run the Remember Me perk to begin with, 4. you have more than two Remember Me stacks, ... - maybe then it is completely okay for you to win that hatch game, especially considering that you regularly could have just slugged in order to ensure it doesn't even come to the hatch game, and considering that there are perks that increase the gate opening speed (rarely used, sure, but then so is Remember Me).
---
Gen tapping is way more useful on console
---
Well they're better than the auto generated memes here
---
\*slaps table\* THANK YOU
---
Wow! From the hardest achievement it becomes the easiest.
---
If infinites were "intended features," then why were they patched out? They were both poor game design and Survivors took advantage of them to gain an unfair advantage.
---
I'd prefer a different bunny outfit. Like maybe look at DQ XI for inspiration
---
I'm not following,
---
Bold of you to assume there's any internal testing, at least if playing the game optimally is concerned.
---
Is it because you don't want to make eye contact with Nea?
---
RBTs don't waste time in the PTB though. Not when their timers pause when in the terror radius, when they cant activate after all gens are finished/locked, and when they no longer stop you from walking out an open gate.
---
The entire reason RBTs stalled for time was because they put you on a death clock. You removed the RBT or died, didn't matter if it was early/mid/late game. An ignored RBT meant certain death and that was balanced by Pig being a M1 Killer that didn't have anything else but a limited time sink.
---
The PTB almost removed all of that pressure by taking away what threat RBTs had.
---
This entire sub is about moaning and crying over any small change
---
So pig is worthless because she won't be able to get that free 4th kill? Ok.
---
Where does it say vaulting is slower? I know they nerfed their speed but I thought vaulting would still be enough to not loose ground while going through a window/over pallet
---
They should make running out the gate with a hat count as escaping with an item.
---
One of the few remaining powerful survivor perks? Tf you mean? There are a lot of powerful survivor perks. But yeah, that was bullshit. Nurse is overall breaking the game by ignoring most rules, she needs a rework tbh, not as bad as freddy, but still.
---
I literally just tested this in a match, and yes, triggering the End Game Collapse by closing the hatch does proc Adrenaline.
---
legion needed the changes
---
What notes? Can i get a link?
---
Piggy can remove her terror radius by crouching and following that was just a stupid fuckin nerf that wasn‚Äôt needed.
---
it's the same with Pharmacy
---
thank you luv &lt;3
---
Wait, they're actually serious about this?! Peppa was already not the best and they do this? We, the oink organization will not stand for this!
---
Isn‚Äôt she considered mid tier? And she can play very well. I don‚Äôt think many people really understand that it takes effort to play the game. Survivors aren‚Äôt going to give you free kills, you have to learn how to earn them. Now as the pig, the play-style changes as I mentioned above.
---
I mean my point is. Nurse etc is still in the gamw why keep that but kill pig
---
Alot of devs do read the reddit, they sometimes answer questions people have
---
Nope. It‚Äôs in the newer patch notes. The ones that also list the garbage addon changes. It‚Äôs **very** noticeable too. So I‚Äôm hoping it doesn‚Äôt go through.
---
Legion needed a rework, not a nerf.
---
Front page. Pinned thread.
---
In before they remove it.
---
&gt; The trapped survivor would just be chasing you. He'd be doing nothing useful for the team .
---
Whew now lets hope the other 3 guys join in doing nothing useful for the team, otherwise we have one entire side 100% effectivity down while the other side is only 25% effectivity down. Maybe some entity wide map announcement to please be patient, its a pig, so go easy.. Or a baseball cap for pig. "Please be paitient, im crouching"
---
I am not sure but I don‚Äôt think so, because the RBTs no longer activate when hatch is closed. You would have to check whether the adrenaline perk says ‚Äúwhen the last generator is complete‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen the exit gates are powered. The former meaning it doesn‚Äôt, the latter meaning it does.
---
Don't the dash attack to sneak up on people.
---
Just uncrouch.
---
Especially good with M&amp;A since you'll have a short duration of 0 terror radius while you're standing.
---
When I tried him on the PTB I thought it was easier to hit multiple survivors with the increased duration (from 6 to 10 seconds). The 4 extra seconds make more than up for the decreased frenzy speed.
---
The vault animation didn't need to be changed though imo
---
Left Behind was buffed for no reason. Like, what is the purpose of doing gens alone if the hatch spawns even with 5 gens to do and the killer can close it, powering the exits?
---
Legion was broken and now is shit.
---
Pig, or that, or stop the timer but the survivor still needs to remove it to escape.
---
The RM nerf is probably to not to make overpowered the exit time if you are the last one alive. You can't do 50 seconds alone without the killer noticing you. That's why the opening time was buffed to 15 seconds.
---
To be fair, it was a necessary nerf. It creates a near impossible to win scenario for the Survivor if they're the last one left and have a trap on and hatch is closed. There's no skill or counterplay to be had. You're simply fucked.
---
The pig player doesn't have to camp exits because they know they can't use them and hatch is gone. So pig just patrols jigsaw boxes and makes it near impossible to get the trap off. So they either get the down in a chase or Entity kills them at 3 minute mark. There's nothing the Survivor can do.
---
That goes completely against the point of End Game Collapse.
---
So they had to adjust it so that couldn't happen.
---
Wait WHAT!? This is why I liked going against the pig because she was so intense. They're really ruining their own game making all the killers reduced to a plank of wood -.-
---
Wait, Did they removed hatch grabs?
---
What‚Äôs next? People can‚Äôt trigger traps when in the trappers killer radius? If endgame happens then nurse can‚Äôt blink? Myers can‚Äôt stalk during a chase?
---
And what‚Äôs the point of making the gates open faster??? The endgame triggers after the gate is open. If you‚Äôre going after the other gate instead of running for the open one, does that 5 seconds really make a difference, killer is probably by the open one. If they‚Äôre worried about 1v1s couldn‚Äôt they have just made it only faster after the hatch has been closed. 
---
If they wanted survivors to just leave as fast as possible just end the game in the final gen. This tense countdown doesn‚Äôt sound tense at all.
---
You red ringed him lol
---
Legion is quite like Wraith now in how they work.
---
I disagree with the legion bit, but the pig was unexpected.
---
Who needs karma, its more satisfying doing the deed yourself ü§£
---
Are you new? Everything seems normal in the video.
---
Yep.
---
it says when the exit gates are powered so im assuming yes, and someone answered saying they had just tested it and it does so yea
---
Ah shit, I only just noticed this. Time for grinding.
---
Okay then
---
It's worthless because her traps have no effect after the last generator is done. Survivors can still escape with it.
---
what did they do to remember me?
---
Idk. I found it way harder. Because I would hit a survivor and go to the next who was already running away and even with 10 seconds I couldn‚Äôt reach her without getting stunned. It‚Äôs happened every time I‚Äôve attempted to chain it with the only exception being the one time everyone was on the same gen.
---
In the notes didn‚Äôt it say if the trap is inactive they can get out? The traps are only considered inactive if no gens are done. Otherwise they‚Äôre active and you can‚Äôt escape with the RBT on
---
its horrible xD im still having problems with judging the distance
---
Its bugged for me too
---
True, it won't be an every game occurrence. But still it makes an already bad perk worse
---
I haven't played recentely, what have I missed?
---
They nerfed it
---
Did this happen on the PTB?
---
Man why would they do that, she wasn't particularly powerful to begin with.
---
*laughs in borrowed time*
---
Ok I used to main pig but I don‚Äôt anymore so I hope I can be unbiased
---
She is WAYYYY too weak as it is, her whole kit revolves around making the survivors waste time getting the traps off. You‚Äôre not gonna kill anyone with them unless they‚Äôre rank 20 or you tunnel them all game.
---
This new update does require a rework of her end game traps but with how they are doing it they make useless cause they most likely aren‚Äôt gonna be active in the end.
---
The worst part though is the terror radius change cause unlike the legion shit where people were walking backwards, that doesn‚Äôt happen on pig and now she is LITERALLY useless on small maps cause the survivors are gonna always be in your radius. It removes the immediate need to remove the RBT.
---
In the end I understand the trap nerf as a TEMPORARY nerf till they find something better but the terror radius is just bad.
---
Presumably due to her potential in the EGC but there were other ways beside making her a completely useless killer in the endgame.
---
Blood Warden is okay but extremely situational. Fire up is pure garbage and remember me just joined fire up
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
nope, live
---
honestly yeah I do the same, I'll go practice some more piano, but I mean yeah, you're exactly right, which is what I was saying, great if you do that, but if somebody is happy playing one game, especially when they want to provide you money, or if it would lead to that, then surely it's better to at least say "we're working on it" or really anything that isn't "just go".
---
But Pig Nerf. GG devs.
---
Right. But if it was Billy or speed wraither thatd be a different story
---
That's so stupid -.-
---
Only if the trap isn't activated but... Yeah, is an unnecessary nerf tbh
---
And if you've permitted multiple people getting slugged and RBT'd, it kinda seems like there _should_ be some difficult consequences.
---
Really hope it gets changed back :(
---
Remember in the SAW movies where the guy with a trap on his head just walked out of the room and lived?
---
Damn, new Leatherface meta.
---
People play DbD on console? I mean technically it exists but it's like playing Doom on SNES.
---
I remember the devs saying the Pig has the best "base kit" of all killers because she can have no terror radius and slows the game down with traps and potentially kill survivors with traps.
---
Sounds good on paper but in reality the Pig is just a really bad killer who needs buffs to her ambush and traps and crouch speed instead of nerfs.
---
This is shit.
---
Spirit: If the survivors hear the husk, you will be trapped in the spirit world during the entire game.
---
Clown: You will become stunned if the gas of the bottles hits you.
---
I agree with the idea that legion is basically like a mid-tier killer now. If he is played optimally, he can do well. If not, then he won't do well.  
---
The only main difference I see is that he can't get extra pressure like others do (EX: Doctor making people go Tier III madness, Clown can throw a bottle near a gen; these don't do a ton but provide extra pressure)
---
Yeah. I like running it but I would feel a lot better about it if there was some kind of actual in-game benefit for running it.
---
I saw someone in the thread suggest that you get to see the killer's aura for four seconds when you unhook, which I like. Basically make it survivor BBQ.
---
I was reading the new notes and I didn't see any changes to caffeine pills/Susie's mixtape/bracelet did they remove them completely?
---
As someone who lives in Texas, it really won‚Äôt be too terrible - I get about 100-90 ms ping between both locations, which while ideal, isn‚Äôt really that bad.
---
There's no confusion. Its a simple enough concept to grasp, and anyone looking to play the PTB is almost guaranteed to understand the mechanics that the EGC is bringing to the game. Especially something as damn simple as "once the EGC is triggered, via whichever method, there will be no more gens to complete. Because there are no gens required as the escape route has already been activated".
---
It's insanely simple, and I don't understand why you're struggling to comprehend it or the fact that they don't need to mention this specific mechanic every time.
---
Creepy dude.
---
On an unrelated note where did you get those icons? Sick as hell.
---
They are now killer instinct increasing addons.
---
isnt that the hoodie that the loli from date-a-live wears?
---
69th upvote and TF2 YEEEEET
---
It can be really hot at summer (can't stand it) and really cold at winter (I love it so much!). Luckily, the summer is pretty short and the winter lasts for like half a year :) But I'm in the minority, others would prefer it the other way around. The town is kinda nice and people.. being people, I guess? Overall I don't think it differs **that** much from other places, but I don't know.
---
The trap progress is already hidden. Has been since day 1. Its either red meaning its ticking down, or white, meaning its not. Now if they make the beeping go away, that would suck
---
Thank you for the constructive criticism.
---
Agree, I also think it would be fun to have killers who revolve more around the endgame in general. Currently most killers sort of lost when all gens pop. It would be cool to have one or two killer who shine especially during the endgame (aside from perks like NOED etc.).
---
First off, you need to chill out. It's a simple discussion about a game, man, not a verbal war. There's no need for hostility. 
---
Second, unintended features can be the product of poor game design; it's not the only product. Do you think that things a developer make are intended, even if they completely break the game? Infinite pallets &amp; windows were the unintended product that came out of a bad design, which is why they fixed it.
---
Third, and to get back on topic, those flaws were exploited. Do you think Moonwalking Legion was an intended, yet bad, game design and not an unintended flaw that was later exploited? If we go by your way of thinking, it was never an exploit and just a different balancing and the developers are now growing from it. If we go by more logical thinking, Moonwalking Legion, just like Infinites, was an exploit that wasn't intended, and was a product of poor game design.
---
Oh shoot. I just saw this magnificent pig nerf on the 2.7.0 patch. This nerf is pointless! Why would they nerf a just good mid-tier killer
---
I love how they buffed the Left Behind perk, but made it so the hatch opens with 1 person left no matter what :p the devs must be Cosmetic shop mains because they don't seem to play killer or survivor :p
---
It didn't mention that in the notes... So are the devs just straight up with holding information
---
&gt;They completely destroyed the legion lmao. Your bias is showing.
---
Me and any sane player hated playing against Legion. Not because they were strong because they have never been apart from a few specific cases but because they were boring. 
---
Being chased by a Legion was just a matter of time before you went down and there was absolutely nothing you could do. Get hit, wait for his frenzy to recharge, get him again.
---
Listen to the audio. The entity lagged a bit lol
---
[Here's you go!](https://www.mediafire.com/file/4a5zg7tt5kp1mra/Geistra%27s+Sky+Pack.zip)
---
I enjoyed this post, that‚Äôs not very nice.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt have audio on. Sorry OP.
---
Yup, never denied him needing changes. Just said these ones were not it.
---
So it would be better to allow the pig to chase someone with a trap on their head for the entirety of the endgame collapse? That ruins the point of the EGC.
---
I hope you're right about that.
---
You're comparing apples and oranges.
---
NUMEROUS bugs, glitches and exploits existed on both sides for ages before the devs really cracked down on balance.
---
Now that they're focused on killing exploits shortly after they're found on both sides, you're trying to argue that it's all about being biased against killers.
---
That's ignorant logic. Killers got massive buffs in recent patches while Survivors got nerfed.
---
Now when a killer exploit is nerfed, you're complaining the devs are 100% survivor biased and anti-killer. It's silly.
---
Survivor exploits existed longer because all the exploits from back then existed for that long.
---
Once they made a SERIOUS committment to balance, they've cracked down on ALL exploits fast since. So that's WHY a killer exploit gets knocked out fast.
---
Just like if there was a Survivor exploit that let them get infinite sprint burst stacks, that would get knocked out ASAP now too.
---
They don't activate after gens are done, no way for them to be procced. So they can just walk right out.
---
Not the only problem, but survivor entitlement toward disconnecting is waaaaay worse, there's not even a reason to try equivocating unless you have an agenda.
---
Killers: Gets Gen Rushed, NOED and Ruin destroyed early.
---
Also Killers: Guess i‚Äôll DC 
---
[this does not apply to all killers, but i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happened.]
---
Probably. I thought they just nerfed the speed when I read it first. But the description has changed in game.
---
I had no real problem with most of the nerf the killers or survivors received recently but this one is pretty strange. Pig‚Äôs trap are completetly worthless in the end of the match now. I guess they will reduce the timer? That could help.
---
Wow that's ridiculous
---
6th perk slot for swf, 5th being voice comms: "lag jukes"
---
Great.
---
Still don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs fun, but okay.
---
Stop being so overdramatic.
---
The balance of the game only improved since the game launched. I am sure most people would agree with this.
---
I've only played killer for about a week haha, I'll go from rank 8 to 6 after 1 game too..
---
Agreed. Considering the killer equivalent is easy to stack since it's the killer's base objective and provides a strong perk effect, the survivor's side should be appropriately buffed. I think personally completing generators (each one completed giving 25% towards the perk, even if it's just joining a generator with 5% left) should add to the bloodpoint buff. As for an actual incentive to use it much like BBQ &amp; Chili, the perk should have an effect like "The killer's aura is revealed to you for 4 seconds when a chase is initiated with another survivor over 40m away", or "the killer's location (or aura) is revealed when a generator is completed", like Rancor for survivors. Obviously these could be tweaked or changed altogether, they're just a few ideas to make the perk not utter trash.
---
My guess is that the RBT timer and Feral Frenzy timer are related, so by changing how Feral Frenzy worked, they had to change the timer, or something similar, since they both worked the same way. Still pretty unacceptable though
---
The only buff trapper needs imo is the ability to carry 2 traps immediately and to start with 2. He has an add-on that makes traps set automatically so if anything they just need slightly better spawn areas
---
But what about DC rates of the killer?
---
Oh, the animation is much cooler than I thought it would be.
---
&gt;Yup, never denied him needing changes. Just said these ones were not it.
---
Now that people will stop DCing against Legion (hopefully), they will have time to work on a proper rework. 
---
Legion mechanic was bad from day 0 and everyone knew about it.
---
Can you edit a "and I'm a killer main btw" to complete that post? It's all it's missing.
---
Lets goooooo
---
I‚Äôd also just be happy if they didn‚Äôt spawn in random corners that I would never go to otherwise. I‚Äôd just like to see his early game strengthened, he‚Äôd be so much better
---
I agree. Also a nice QoL change would be to let him reset traps without having to pick them up first.
---
I'm not stating any bias and I kindly ask you don't put words in my mouth. I am making an objective statement that exploits that benefit Survivors take longer to patch than exploits that benefit Killers. I agree the Moonwalking Legion exploit needs to be patched out, since it is completely unfair. Like I said, I'm not bringing my gameplay preference into this at all. I could be a Survivor or Killer main; it has no impact. All that is being stated is a viewing of how long it takes for each side to get patched.
---
Alright behaviour you‚Äôve gone too far she wasn‚Äôt close to top tier and you nerf her wtf
---
of course [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tboskz85ex77fft/AABBlHF-LbyZVrD2lB30S7Wia?dl=0), idk why my post removed, i don't did it and for me my post not removed
---
Almost like how when two to four (or, I shudder to think of, six to eight) Survivors are coordinated and can run the Killer around a surprising amount of the Trial whilst at the same time completing generators at a similarly alarming rate? Coordinated actions between players being used to great effect is nothing new to this game, I'd like to point out. 
---
Honestly, with the skill imbalance caused by SWF that even BHVR can't seem to figure out how to deal with, it feels like one of the easiest ways is to have some form of coordination on the Killer's side of things as well.
---
Damn this is nice! My only complaint is that his legs aren't close together enough lol
---
[Meme teplates,](https://imgur.com/a/fx4xols) and lots of them. 
---
[Discord](http://discord.gg/aBz4aC7)
---
The point of the traps was never to be lethal, only to delay the game, but I have to agree, considering how easy it is to get one of it is just a waste.
---
Yes lol anything that activate once the Exit Gates are powered applies when the hatch is closed to trigger the EGC. Adrenaline is the same.
---
&gt;With closing the hatch and exit gates auto powering, does that mean NOED will be active once the hatch is closed?
---
I think so.
---
I believe a safe rescue just means they didn‚Äôt get downed within 10 seconds. I could be wrong.
---
I knew what it would be before I clicked it, but I still had to hear it.
---
I mean depending on his power sowing "mines" couod be good in loops
---
Having a high skill ceiling doesn't justify making a character strictly more powerful than the others. Sooner or later players will reach the necessary skill level, and just start winning nearly every game. This basically kills the game for experienced players, as everyone at the top rank will start to play the character. This is already happening to some extent, as high level play consists mostly of Nurse and Hillbilly.
---
There's a huge difference between the Legion's moonwalking **exploit** and the **intended features** that were pallet vacuums and infinite loops.  
---
You can tell the two apart by looking at what the devs intended, and it's deathly obvious that the developers did not intend for Legion players to be able to literally cheat the survivors out the slightest chance at winning the chase. It is something they simply overlooked, much like the Pig's ability to the same thing with RBT's, which is why that too is getting fixed in the upcoming patch.  
---
But pallet vacuums and infinite loops, while a poor choice of game design, were absolutely intended, as each and every one of those tiles were built manually by the developers, reviewed by the developers, tested by the developers, and were given the okay to be put in the game by the developers.  
---
Again, to finish this conversation, you cannot abuse intended features. That isn't how it works. By your logic, anything that could be considered the meta would be "abusing intended features," simply because it's the best strategy. See how that sounds outside your head? We're done now. Bye.
---
*dces*
---
that sounds like a cornophobic's worse nightmare.
---
Yeah, it's kinda sad really. We finally see a perk that's been kicked down, forgotten and left behind ~~no pun intended~~ for so long buffed to where it could see some use.
---
And the exact same update/PTB is has something that renders it useless.
---
It's not surprising. They had no interest in fixing Legion to keep them fun to play. Why would any other killer be different?
---
I'd actually say it will encourage tunneling. if I play Pig after the update, I can see myself tunneling the trapped survivor more because I know it's now easier for them to stop the timer by hiding within my radius, whereas before, I could put pressure on them only by chasing the others instead. the old way made tunneling inefficient with the Pig; now, it's as encouraged as with other killers.
---
Any traps placed on people after the gens are complete will never activate.
---
Traps won't activate if put on after the 5th generator is complete, confirmed on the PTB.
---
I'm guessing with the new end game mechanic, she became extremely strong in playtesting. That's the only reason I can see for the nerfs. Hopefully we'll learn more on the dev stream on Thursday.
---
Cool PS4 man.
---
Map is free to everyone
---
Accurate
---
Imma have to disagree on legion chief. Imma enjoy playing legion way more now than before.
---
It's like Nurse so they need that counterplay. Legion and Nurse are basically on the same tier anyway.
---
You might have replied to my original post - I did since edit the Remember Me section, because as you rightly point out, the Collapse does not warrant this change at all.
---
I would not say it can be used to argue in the same way for the Pig changes however, since Pig can open a gate herself.
---
Yeah with Billy you learn some fundamentals for killer chases
---
Nurse on the other hand feels like a different game. I think everyone has their nurse phase and promptly never plays her again when it becomes too easy
---
Probably, if the killer is camping the hatch, waiting for the survivor to be nearby to close it.
---
You can't leave the gate with an active trap open, but traps will not activate automatically after all gens are completed anymore, so any traps used after the gens are done are wasted.
---
If you run out before killer gets there then You won‚Äôt have a problem
---
My point wasn't that they need to be more lethal, just that they aren't especially threatening and therefore only delay it as long as it takes to remove the trap and keep working on generators - which, as Glen0ck's stats suggest, wouldn't take that long, especially if your trap hasn't even activated yet and the Pig isn't running Ruleset No. 2. 
---
They really do need a buff of some sort, so they can regain some of the pressure they would put on Survivors back when the Pig and her mechanics were all new to everyone.
---
&gt; does that mean NOED will be active once the hatch is closed?
---
yeah, but it's not going to really make a difference because only one person is alive at that point anyway
---
This is really good!  Love the detail in his weapon. I just think he looks way too short. Wraith is a tall bing bong boi
---
[MFW the data center for US East is in my home state ](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/663/cover2.jpg)
---
I never had this issue even before mm was "fixed" but it certainly helped me find survivor lobbies basically instantly at any time of day now i spend 4 hours in peak time and dont find one? Certainly seems better then having to wait 8 minutes as a killer.
---
With what youve seen of Pig and Legion, which part makes you believe youll get anything close to a decently playable killer?
---
Probably because it takes 2 and a half minutes to get the kill.
---
*absolutely furious oink*
---
seriously high ranks is billy, nurse, billy ,spirit, nurse, nurse,nurse and all will dumb af add ons why would you nerf pig?
---
i don't get why Remember Me was nerfed, the endgame collapse doesn't start until the exit gates are OPENED, not powered
---
yep, the killer cant grab survivor jumping into the hatch.
---
&gt; That's why people are GOING to heal against him. Why wouldn't you? Before, there was no point because he couldn't catch you without using Feral anyway (basically meaning, anyone without deep wounds was full health.)
---
Legion gets an entirely free injure on anyone, that's why healing against him feels kinda shitty. He'll just bring you to injured for no effort.
---
They nerfed him not that long ago. He can't stalk over walls that you can clearly see over.
---
Moonwalking pig is not a thing.
---
That‚Äôs two and a half minutes of moonwalking m8
---
It just punished the pig for being anywhere near trapped survivors
---
You know, it's funny ... I've actually heard this said a lot, but cannot remember where. I will say this though: As much as Billy grinds my gears, I do think he is reasonably balanced. If you watch someone like Ussylis play against Billy it really shows how loop-able he is. If anything on him needs nerfing it's the insta-saw.
---
How will I sneaky sneak now?!
---
The game is quite fair in my opinion. I truly believe that it‚Äôs in a okay state. I think I would fix the rank system and maybe add an extra perk slot for killer since survivors technically have 16 perks, but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Oh and definitely fix hit boxes for survivors.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to play worse to pip. That‚Äôs bullshit. I shouldn‚Äôt have to play worse or worry about the survivors feelings. Why the fuck should I ever feel bad for the survivors, they ate the enemy.
---
&gt;I was talking about new legion.
---
He will be as strong as Plague against competent survivors so we will have to wait and see.
---
yea but that is not really a buff to NOED though
---
I probably do a bad job of guarding totems :D
---
See looks so peaceful
---
Maybe there were other balance issues we don't know about. It might have been the case that she got extremely strong with the new end game mechanic, or that there was some kind of exploit they discovered. Hopefully we find out more on the dev stream, and perhaps she can be rebalanced later on. I know it's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, I guess.
---
That's a nerf depending on which side you look at it.
---
Literally just the first change and the speed buff would be enough if they had missed attacks reduce the duration of frenzy (even by like 3 or 4 seconds).
---
Nobody is going to moonwalk for 2 and 1/2 minutes
---
Meg main big brain üß†üß†üß†
---
End game collapse in general or did they make a change to Pig I haven‚Äôt seen?
---
This is almost as big of a joke as the rest of the game lmao
---
Very fair.
---
Aaah, ok. So if I main Killer than there's no real reason I shouldn't purchase the og killers and only buy the licensed ones
---
Thanks
---
To be fair, Ace Mains are smart. They get Iron Will built in.
---
If you aren't injured and you are getting downed in the exit area you must be the worst survivor ever. This whole post thing is ridiculous. I am a rank 13 survivor and 16 killer. If anything, the pillars are a great place to hide if you know what you are doing when the exit area is open. If killer comes in and starts checking pillars youll have more than enough time to sprint off the map.
---
105 doesn't sound bad for crouched speed.
---
His fast pace appeal was removed same with his vault speed and I won‚Äôt be playing him anymore.
---
Getting good feedback is the most important part. No ranting, not threats of quitting but solid and unbiased feedback from either a cohesive voice or the fog whisperers who are worth nothing.
---
Poor pig. Already struggling as a mid tier killer and now this.
---
I'm not like personally devastated if I lose. It happens. I just think this habit is so weird where people think SWF is a detriment to the balance of solo players and that needs to be fixed but not killer for some reason. This is how the convo always plays out on this sub and it's disconnected from logic and rather baffling
---
So blocking the final trap box from a survivor and giving them the ultimatum of ‚Äúdeath or faster death.‚Äù
---
Yeah makes sense.
---
That‚Äôs fair.
---
In fact why don‚Äôt all survivors just walk straight up to the killer as the start, assume a squatting position and let the match end instantly. That makes sense. 
---
‚ÄúGG EZ‚Äù
---
Imagine implying that Hope is a stronger perk than Self Care LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Part of me wants the wood hand too just because I‚Äôve watched the show and it‚Äôs his spanking hand lol
---
What cracks?
---
The fact that they made Left Behind effect gen repair speed if your the last survivor tells me that sometimes BHVR fails to think before they place forward a change.
---
Why would you ever want to complete a gen instead of looking for the hatch as the last person alive. Even then if the killer closes the hatch, all gens are auto-completed so why would you even bother using the perk.
---
report them. they're likely utilizing an exploit that's bannable
---
Fun fact you're actually looking at a grid of cosmetics with 89% of them only purchasable with cells!
---
The new pins honestly have saved Legion 2.0 for me along with the greatly increased Frenzy time. If it all gets released as is I'll probably be running Legion pin and etched ruler or a duration increase add-on at all times
---
It's honestly annoying as a survivor too when your teammates just DC as soon as they get hit once.  Tons of my matches are like this now. It's the most fun when people DC just because they saw the killer across the map through the fog.
---
I love getting chainsawed 2 seconds after vaulting a window and running away from it when hes on the other side.
---
What's happening to the pig?

can we stop spreading hate tho

thanks
---
A very balanced change, it can benefit both sides but also harm. Kinda like the fog thickeners
---
I'm out of the loop. What Pig nerfs?..
---
I also think he is more fun to play now and less braindead as well.
---
I was actually pleasently suprised when I tried him out today. Some new addons are also really fun.
---
Me last night lol. Thankfully TWO of my teammates were good loopers and didn't go down for the Haunted Grounds timer. God bless guys sorry I scared you
---
should be a billy cosmetic
---
yeah, i noticed, and to be quite honest i'm happy for now but it's solely because these used to trigger my migraines after engine update with Legion chapter.
---
but don't worry, that's just ptb, they will obviously fix this.
---
Misinformation. It still goes off if it's active. You just have to use all of the traps before the last gen pops. With the 3 minute timer for endgame and being able to close hatch I can see why she needed changes. I don't think they're nearly as devastating as the pig mains are saying.
---
Oink
---
Oh I don‚Äôt use the dash if I can help it, only time I use it is if I have that horrible daily to get 4 hits with it.
---
I like the strength of nurse and billy, but hurting weaker killers like this sucks. Mettle of Man is a great example of hurting the M1 killers which might be fun! Gasp*** FUN!?!? Pig is fun. Stop hurting our fun killers.
---
Oh shit that's cool. Any music for killer's like wraith or huntress or those killers who didn't really have a theme?
---
Already disconnected, and we don't even know the other player's name
---
I hope the shit follows you into other games, letting out stink lines if you dont clean it before leaving

Are you in PTB?

&gt; **cloaking** animation

No problem.

The walls of the jungle gyms. Killers can now mindgame properly instead of being bloodlust gamers.

"Massive killer buff"
---
Yeah, sure.
---
sounds good.
---
i love my stuns short though so Joe's Mixtape and Cold Dirt = ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Would be better as an actual video
---
They absolutely need to fix the Omega Blink addons. They are bugged, and the accuracy penalty does not work. I've tested this in KYF by precisely lining my HUD up with the road on Badham preschool. In addition, the increased range doesn't require you to charge for a longer period of time. This means that a range increase of 35% also comes with a charge speed increase of 35%. To put this in perspective the "Bad Man's" last breath increases charge speed by 14% at the cost of **increasing the fatigue** **timer** *and* **removing a blink**. The bug with Nurse's range addons completely destroy any sort of counterplay. Considering Nurse uses blinks as her main for of chase and movement, this is equivalent to having addons for other killers that just let them start in bloodlust II/III and stay there the whole game.
---
I stopped playing her a long time ago because of how broken she was. Especially when they originally destroyed her hit boxes. I miss playing her but she‚Äôs so slow and hatchets are always inaccurate or broken.
---
That's really good touch and all. I can appreciate it.
---
But I just really dislike what's going on right now. &gt;!I'm shitting bricks at the moment.!&lt;
---
Pig reverse bear traps will not trigger at exit gates unless active.
---
Oh and trap timers don‚Äôt go down while in the pig‚Äôs terror radius
---
Really glad they didn't forget about us in South America, and as someone that lives in S√£o Paulo I'm ready for 10 ping games
---
Well i looked it up and sure enough, a sexy Feng Min is also welcome
---
Because BHVR is incredibly incompetent
---
Or you can learn to play against her instead of disconnecting.
---
When did they make the terror radius a thing?
---
That's such a tru3 comment and it's bs. Billy doesn't care about looping, with enduring and spirit fury you're more than happy to eat through them and you get a free insta down every 3rd pallet. Or even better, you found someone where there is no pallet? Free instadown. He has the best map pressure among killers, he has 115% ms compared to Spirit's 110% and yes, that's actually a big deal considering what his power does. Did I mention already that he can instadown, Spirit can't? And it's not even remotely hard to do so. Also even though Spirit doesn't get looped (unless you already saw her using her power, then she does get) she still can waste more time at a single pallet if a survivor is good enough to mind game her. And this sometimes takes longer than just eating it through with Billy. And once all the pallets are gone in the end game, you're fucked against Billy, meanwhile you can still outrun Spirit. So yeah, Billy is better than Spirit.
---
Pretty much, since they're now completely worthless once the last gen is powered (literally 0 reason to do them).   
---
Only kind-of benefit is that active ones can be used to detect if a survivor is nearby (assuming Behaviour, in their *infinite wisdom*, didn't forsee that as well and just made it so the killer who designed the traps doesn't know anything about their timer whatsoever, somehow, logically)
---
This update in a nutshell: "Fuck Killers"
---
is this a reference to pvz
---
Chanel #1 of course, she'd be like Ash and same something like "If you're going to get attacked, please attempt to get attacked in a fresh, exciting way"
---
Ah yes, just like in Rainbow 6. Replace the Killer and have to salvage a 1 gen remaining clusterfuck of 4 teabagging flashlight Claudettes. I like a challenge.
---
(yes I know this comment was a joke)
---
Oh that's called a survivor toppled it. I should know. :(
---
The first panel is insanely inaccurate, this sub has been losing its mind since the Legion changes were announced.
---
I actually got downed by NOED after gates were open last night, head trapped, and got the trap off amd walked out the gate. So it's not impossible under current standards. This nerf is simply ridiculous.
---
you can change the killer schematics in a way that gives an incentive to tunnel, and that's what they've just done with the Pig. now survivors with a trap can just urban evade around in the terror radius to stop the timer, so it doesn't matter if Pig is chasing you or not. so now if I'm the Pig, I just lost an incentive to avoid tunneling that I had before.
---
Usually I'm pretty tame about updates, some nerfs and buffs are dumb and annoying but I get it sometimes,
---
(BUT WHY DID YOU NERF A LOW TIER KILLER THAT STRUGGLES SO MUCH IN GAME EVEN MORE????)[https://i.redd.it/caw6qzocov621.jpg]
---
I knew she'd be powerful with this new mechanic, but to the point of making the other half of her already weak arsenal useless from now on?
---
They've been systematically removing mechanics that are dependent on Chase since it's so unreliable. This is just a continuation of that.
---
As a fellow pig main, I don‚Äôt know I feel like this nerf is being over reacted to, like now we just have to use traps midgame instead of late.
---
We also now get to realize if a survivor is in our terror radius at all which I think is very strong. If their trap is activated they can‚Äôt get anywhere near us without basically telling us they are there with the trap icons.
---
Imo the saddest thing is that we can‚Äôt camp Jigsaw boxes to watch them explode anymore cause we will never see the animation without crouching.
---
Yes, I know. but the thing is for the most part people are okay with the Legion changes, which is not the case of Pig. Even those who never play her see the changes are all unnecessary
---
You‚Äôre being dramatic. I don‚Äôt agree with every decision they‚Äôve made but pretty much all of them had solid thought processes. The Pig as is would‚Äôve been extraordinarily strong in the EGC if they hadn‚Äôt made any adjustment, STBFL isn‚Äôt meant to be able to be a permanent speed boost, Legion was fucking the game up extraordinarily bad, etc. There‚Äôs been plenty of good things for killers and the game is in a good state, especially compared to the past.
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr Here's something for you.
---
Thanks for the info! I have to sit here and wait for people to post about stuff that isn't in the patch notes since i'm on console /:
---
The less you guard the totem and the sooner survivors realise they are fighting a spirit, the less likely they are going to break that totem
---
i really don't get how is Legion dead. while playing, the changes complimented my normal playstyle with Legion, i actually consider this a buff. speed really makes difference. i always preferred to injure as many people as possible then catch up to one person, end Frenzy and just m1 them.
---
at least people wont farm u anymore
---
i just bought her...
---
Don't put your faith in Behavior. They don't give a shit.
---
Obviously wasn't just one person but I still think the idea was shit and the way I express it is by being dramatic about it.
---
In the end I got my feelings through one way or another via stating my complete distaste for the changes.
---
Obviously don't want someone fired over a minor change, but I do think it's one of the more ridiculous changes BHVR has made similar to the flashlight/pallet ones in the past.
---
Noed doesn't really need changes
---
That's good news cause that's the kind of playstyle I've been using too
---
Free injure on anyone he sees, can string it together to get entire lobby injured in first 30 seconds on a lot of maps. Wastes time to heal against him. 115% killer.
---
*That is not bad.*
---
How constructive
---
RBTs dont work if placed after the last generator is done. that was the best time to use them before.
---
As a Legion main, I agree. The nerfs don't help. It makes him feel  like a survivor with a weapon instead of a killer. no point in using his power if perks like SB can make it harder to be hit with m2 because you're sped up. I'd rather just have a complete Legion rework at this point than buffs
---
It's easy beating up a gang everyone hates, but to then go for a lonely single cute sexy piggy? That is just mean.
---
Doctor: Survivors in his terror radius don't get effected by his shock therapy 
---
:\^)
---
try 20 fps
---
Valid points, but even so that's still a nerf to the Pig considering right now she could throw a trap on someone after the gens are done, and unless they take the hatch they can't safely escape until removing their RBT. After the nerfs, her ability has no power beyond the instant the gates are powered unless they were on someone beforehand.
---
I know, but knowing BHVR, you can never be too careful.
---
I'm pretty sure the entire reason they removed it in the first place was because the bone rattle played at the beginning of his uncloak animation, which basically just gave his position away immediately.
---
Yeah, reducing the time it takes to open doors while also nerfing fire up. What even?
---
Man, I just bought her too. Specifically because I thought she'd be strong in the end game. I want my money back lol
---
This wasn't confusion. It was intentional.
---
The RBT nerf is for the end game collapse mechanic. If the last survivor has the hatched closed on them with a trap on their head they automatically lose without this change. That said I‚Äôm still upset about the nerfs, especially the terror radius one.
---
RBT already has so many restrictions set on it (doesn't tick on hook, or in a chase, etc) that this is just kicking Pig while she's down lmao. It's not like her active ability is strong enough to warrant these nerfs
---
Except on almost every ptb they don't make any meaningful changes and just use it as an advertisment
---
Making survivors DC
---
He is still good. My problem is all the fun of playing legion is gone. At this point I am just playing an M1 killer.
---
What perks are you using? I've been watching FamerJohn and he's been running Spirit Fury and Enduring, getting a lot of chain hits on survivors, especially with the movement buff. Actually seemed... fun.
---
&gt;In all the games out of the 500 players 212 DCed. This includes 7killerd and 205 survivors.
---
Holy fucking yikes, this is going to kill the game
---
Stopping people from walking out of exit gates when the trap is on their head is the most fun part of her power in my opinion, not they gutted it, oof.
---
Legion needed changes and he got them, hes probably a better killer now than before if you didnt cheese mehanics
---
hell yeah! it's the best. playing survivor i was always happy to see these types of Legions cause that means they outplayed me if i let them lure me somewhere they can get a free hit. that removed frustration of being powerless against power abuse or blunt Frenzy hits.
---
I mean this with nothing but respect, but you gotta git gud. Watch videos and learn the tricks. You didn't specify which side you play so i can't really give you exact tips but my most general advice can be, as a survivor learn how to loop. As a killer learn how to mind game. And you only get better if you can learn both sides. Another thing you might want to learn how the emblem system works. As survivor, do the maximum amount of saves and gens. Take the killer on long chases, and survive. As killer, kick gens, win chases, always aim for 3 hooks on each survivor (don't camp) and try to get 4ks. If you have any specific questions i would love to help
---
They will with borrowed time lol but that got buffed too so ig it isn‚Äôt that bad
---
The killer will know you are near by the red ticking though, if the ticking stops they will start searching the area / lockers for you
---
Are you referring to the Coldwind change?
---
Fuck yo chicken strips!
---
ABORT THIS SHIP! I REPEAT ABORT THIS SHIP! IT'S SINKING FASTER THAN THE TITANIC!
---
Seriously.  They're gutting low tier killers for what?  So more people play nurse and billy?  I'll pass, not that I mind going against billy and nurse, but I don't want to see them every fuckin game.
---
&gt;Some of the legion changes are fine, but why the nerf to pallet vaulting?
---
Probably because they buffed Iridescent Button. I watched zubat using and it actually makes sense. If they kept the old vault speed, you could just destroy the pallet by vaulting it, the survivor wouldn't gain any ground on you and the pallet would be gone.
---
As an aside, when I first learned what was up for the end game collapse I thought it was a buff to Hope, so I'm super disappointed I was wrong lol
---
Oh my little survivor main how wrong you are. If you are on comp play Sally and if you go from rank 20 to 1 in a week I'll be impressed and say I am wrong.
---
In addition it will still tick when you are crouched now.
---
They nerfed the Plague, so no wonder they‚Äôd nerf the pig. They have shit for brains I swear, Nurse exists but Plague was too strong? Horse shit, these devs are fools.
---
Wow, that's cool looking. Shame no one is gonna pay for it since they dumpstered Legion.
---
They hate us coz they ain't us.
---
I don‚Äôt DC intentionally, but if I did I‚Äôd DC every Freddy game. He‚Äôs weak as a killer, but he‚Äôs unfun to play against.  I find his power way more annoying and unfun to face than Legion‚Äôs was.
---
did you get a 4k
---
Now that you've made this post a BHVR employee will update Pig's timers to remain grey at all times from the Killer's HUD.
---
Ah, fair enough
---
Freddy is probably weaker as survivors get 7 seconds to find a decent loop, even if freddy gets a free hit by chasing behind you he has no way to catch up
---
‚ÄúSpirit Fury and Enduring‚Äù
---
Yeah no, any killer can use these. That isn‚Äôt an argument, hell one of these is default on Spirit.
---
It's not just about the Collapse though. Picture this situation.   
---
Pig puts a Survivor in dying state after the Collapse starts, traps them and then hooks them. The other Survivors are opening the exit gates and regroup to get the rescue, they make it and rescue the hooked guy. Now, what should the Pig do?   
---
Right now the trapped survivor wouldn't be able to just walk out the door. So the Pig can make an easy choice not to tunnel and go after one of the rescuers while knowing they have extra time to go find the injured survivor since they have to get the RBT off before leaving.  
---
But after the patch the Pig will probably just tunnel the rescued survivor since now they know the trap won't do anything and it is better to just get the kill at such a late moment in the game.  
---
That is basically it.
---
RBT turns off during endgame and won't trigger when survivors try to escape.
---
Speaking of pig, I was just in a game where she got gen rushed, window juked, noed destroyed before she even hit someone with it, pallet looped, tbagged, adrenalined, and 0 kills. Kinda made me sad
---
Hey thanks for pointing that out, I'll make sure the devs know to fix that.
---
wipe your tears pls.
---
Todd Howard you've done it again
---
Well it just make them look lazy, not competent to be brutal. They couldn't figure out a way to make The Pig work without being too OP so they just said nerf her. Hope they figure something out.
---
Maybe with this change she is the worst, but right now it would probably be Freddy or Legion.
---
Will  people stop with this, so she gets a shit version of whispers if a trap is powered now so what, traps are easy to take off. Half the time they never get powered, before endgame the traps a purely to waste a bit of time
---
whispers is good on every killer
---
They should do what siege does and ban you from playing for a set time (about 15 minutes) and after you can playing you get a blood point penalty for 30-60 minutes.
---
someone pls stop the rank 17 survivors they're killing the game
---
I main killer and I feel bad for teammates of people who think they can just keep running and spamming pallets. Eventually, you'll run out. And eventually, I'll catch you, since your stupid ass keeps running (and I can see all the scratch marks). Or, you loop back after running through a pallet thinking you'll stun me, and  take a charged hit since I don't respect your pallet game. 
---
And then I get talked shit to for "tunneling" when you don't know that sprinting near me is just begging to get chased.
---
I feel like we are looking at a rotten Pig corpse now and asking if it has any uses.
---
Jump scares are the best part of this game to me, on both sides. As a survivor it's great because it briefly brings me back to how spooky this game was when I was new.
---
It still sucks
---
Legion's ability makes it so you are always guaranteed to get the first hit for free. You can quite comfortably get multiple survivors injured in a fairly short amount of time. Then if they choose to stay injured they risk easily getting downed alternatively the survivors choose to heal which wastes a lot of their time. Slap on Sloppy Butcher and Legion's ability will waste a ton of the survivors time. From the games I've played on the PTB I feel as if he is a more viable killer now than on Live. The regular movement speed on it's own does more for him than people seem to understand.
---
And girls
---
If they dont majorly change this from the ptb after the response I think it just shows how pointless the ptb really is, bugs still get through and nothing with balance changes anyway
---
Where did y‚Äôall find the patch notes for this stuff? PS4 patch notes on the forum show none of it.
---
Damnnnn what OP said plus what you said make me realize that everything is okay. The trap not ticking in TR really pissed me off when i read it but this creates more awareness for the pig. Good looks yall
---
It the PTB
---
All of Hillbilly's cosmetics are garbage tho so yeah pweaaasee bhvr gob hiwwybiwwy a good skin ty owo
---
You would have been downed there by literally any killer
---
Wow, must be horrible having to connect to a server a few hundred kilometres away. According to google maps the closest server to me is a 9 hour flight away. Why are Americans so entitled over 30 ping in games?
---
Ye, except... someone who wants unhook points or farm you is still gonna farm you. All this does it makes a perk that literally only gives bloodpoints even harder to get stacks on. Honestly, I'm not happy with this change and hear me out why. I don't farm, however there are some scenarios when "farming" is not bad. First, and this one happens a lot: 2 of us are alive, one on the hook and the killer is chasing me. I get enough distance to save him, the killer downs me as I unhook him and then he immidiately downs him too. And I bet the survivor was not mad or considered that as farming. Second, and this one happenes even more frequently: survivor is getting camped so he's basically dead any way so I save him with no chance to getting my stack at all. Third, I perform a completely save unhook and yet the idiot still somehow runs into killer a second before I would get my safe one. So yeah, no farming involved in any of them. Why not simply give stacks for more action, like healing someone or getting someone up from dying state?
---
The two killer glitch was so FUN and good for farming games, but now it's bannable üòí
---
Honestly i think it's the opposite. Since the pipping changes mid ranks are full of depip squads on xbox. Rank 12 in monto videos is full of potatoes but i see a lot of strong swf groups and almost no potatoes anymore.
---
It used to be potatoes well into purple ranks lol
---
\*Sprint bursts into hook save\*
---
Nice stats but something you should know moving further the comma (,) isn‚Äôt the same as the period (.) you use the comma to write big numbers using them every 3 number places like 6 million would be written 6,000,000 For period or decimal point you use them to show fractions for numbers like 3 and half would be 3.5
---
Free hits? Quite far from reality. Survivors with bad connection can prove even harder to hit, high ping doesn't favor either side.
---
Same :D
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the trap will kill them at the exit gates if you put the trap on before the last gen is finished, so this has no effect to wether survivors will work on generators with the trap on their head
---
Top of the sub.
---
This is a great sight to read. Some of the add-ons were buffed nicely. Frank's isnt op and still looks strong. Ty!
---
*Cough* Cat nea would make more sense *cough*
---
That happened to me too, yesterday!
---
"I'm gonna shoot you!"
---
"That's a paintball gun."
---
"Yeah, but it's gonna be really annoying!"
---
Ah, I sort by new so I guess I missed it.
---
For sure 2 seconds is hyperbole
---
They just keep catering to whiny survivors lately all I keep seeing in the DBD news is another killer being nerfed to a plank of wood when they don't need to be and they're crapping on their own game by listening to these fools that would rather change the game to suit them than actually try and get more skilled.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs like one of the most read book for middle schoolers outside of To kill a mockingbird.
---
I agree that the nerf is unnecessary. I was just pointing out that the collapse itself has little to do with it.
---
Its incredibly important to play with the general population as a dev. If they aren't doing this, the game will never be balanced. Do they do this?
---
If you slap on Sloppy Butcher your games will end even faster because that incentivizes people to never heal and just do gens.
---
He said "yay I can now lag as killer". 
---
Before, lag as killer means everyone else stops moving.
---
Yes, a laggy survivor is hard to hit, but that will be true with or without dedicated servers.
---
I'll say right now: Legion is just as bad as everyone says he would be, end game collapse is really cool, remember me WAS nerfed... and Lery's looks darker for some reason
---
Mending is really easy and takes little time. I have yet to see it waste a significant amount of time.
---
The chain injuring is nice though and that is something I noticed in the games I played with him.
---
I never said Legion wasn't  unfun to play. He was a terribly designed killer who had ni skill and no counterplay. But I don't agree that this is all they could do. It's lazy and the devs wanted to make him not broken in the laziest way possible, by nerfing the shit out of him. 
---
Like I said my opinion may change the more I play with him (just like Freddy did) but this is what I feel right now.
---
Yeah, but I feel like somehow the Legion one stirred more discourse on the subreddit.
---
(when it comes to killers I‚Äôm actually a Pig main so sad days)
---
I ship it
---
Lmao, are you just gonna ignore everything else? Because let's discuss the difference between Billy and Wraith then. Sure, Wraith can use this combo too, but what then? He still has no map pressure and no instadown. And that's why Billy is better. And that's why he's better than Spirit. And if you're playing any of those 2 on Spirit, you're playing her the wrong way. Why would you even use any of them if you said Spirit doesn't get looped, get your story straight.
---
IMO is going to benefit the killer because as a killer while looping you dont have time to watch between the small cracks on coldwind being in first person, the survivor is always the one gathering the info on how are you moving as a killer.
---
The only killer I feel it gets worse with this change is nurse, now survivors can reliabily break LOS in these tiles.
---
they have already stated in one of their dev streams that one of the complaints people have about freddy is that you cant see him at all when not asleep and they were looking into that when they change him.
---
Which will be largely mitigated when the host is a dedi instead of the killer hosting, assuming BHVR did a pretty good job on their architecture.
---
Stop photoshopping lol
---
I‚Äôm trying to play this game again but each update keeps me out of it. I‚Äôm think I‚Äôm just going to keep playing Rimworld
---
This is the most bend over backwards logic ever fucking lol
---
Alright, this looks nice. My only complaint is methodology. In this study it would have been better if you had played killer because of two principle reasons
---
A. You'd have an extra 100 data points for each killer.
---
B. The chance that having 1 survivor that won't/can't DC can alter the behavior of the others
---
I can understand why you didn't though. That's a lot of work.  
---
I don't suppose you can break it down further? Like out of 100 games for each killer how many had a DC? Like did every match with Legion involve at least 1 DC.
---
Listen up Meg main if this is photoshopped this Rohn guy dies
---
Funny, cos all I see is an elitist with no patience. Strange how perception works huh?
---
Yeah in my country it is so it used it. I see that might be confusing  Sorry my friend.
---
Wait they said that? What game are they playing?
---
To be honest I would say Billy has the best kit. It's a kit that rewards pressuring gens and not camping because its strong enough to actually chase after survivors and he has an instant down that is decently skill based and keeps him threatening throughout the game without being too oppressing because you can juke it or use walls and windows.
---
you probably shouldnt have done it in the first place its like when people accuse me of lag switching when i dont even know how to do it you should also block him
---
If you have lag, no. It feels like 2 seconds most times but in my books if I vaulted the window and I'm a foot or 2 away and running on the other side, I shouldn't be chainsawed. Basically if he starts his chainsaw as I vault and then I run and he still hits me for standing still at the window, something's wrong
---
It's not the pig's traps being changed to fit the collapse that people are mad about, it's the fact that traps dont go down in TR.
---
"I want to play a game...
---
...oh if you've gotta go, I guess we'll just hang later, text me"
---
tl;dr: I don't play legion or pig so Im totes fine with BHVR just crippling them to not cause problems instead of presenting actual solution that works for both sides 
---
I dont really understand how you can say the changes to pig are reasonable while literally 2 sentences later you presented the solution that would be totally fine and would not break the entire point of the killer. The endgame collapse was to prevent hatch stand offs and taking the game hostage. Just totally pause the collapse timer while the traps are on, they serve literally the same purpose and make them not work in 1v1 situation. They could have just added the animation for last survivor when running through the kill zone instead of dying to stop for 0,5 sec and throw the trap on the ground (the animation that literally already is in the game). This would be an elegant solution while also giving the killer a chance for last second down, so the trap isn't totally useless.
---
When it comes to legion, sure he now actually plays the game. Like trapper without traps. He has movement ability that runs at almost 2x slower speed than billy and with limited duration, but instead of 1hit downing people at the end it stuns you for 4 seconds (just for comparison, decisive strike in before nerf version stunned for 5 and then after nerf for 3, nobody felt a difference until they totally changed it). Your on hit frenzy effect does nothing because they literally cannot bleed out in any realistic scenario and you are just forced to play m1 killer with no useful ability during chase and a really shitty ability outside of chase.
---
Legion after nerfs is literally a hard mode for killer mains, if for some reason you think the game is too easy and you need a challenge to keep yourself entertained. Now instead of playing trapper and never setting traps you have a whole new skin to play with. Even 4 of them!
---
Or before a gen has been completed üôÑ
---
Then why would you mention them :)
---
She can be looped but it doesn‚Äôt matter when you stealth pull people off of gens for an insta down, there is no question on which killer is potentially stronger on certain maps. Billy might be stronger on Coldwind but Spirit would demolish on Lery‚Äôs or The Game. 
---
I have no idea at all why people say Billy is the second strongest, his chainsaw is piss easy to dodge. Literally any obstacle at all makes it useless for downing. All he has is movement.
---
Yea but that means you can‚Äôt play an endgame piggy and place traps on after the gens are powered which considering is one of the better ways to play the pig it hits her pretty hard
---
Hope is stronger than Self Care. I understand why you dont think so, you‚Äôd rather waste time touching yourself in a corner for 40 seconds while someone is getting chased so you never get to end game in order to use Hope.
---
Also traps dont go down in Terror Radius at all, making them useless even before the endgame.
---
It's a today thing but I've definitely seen more threads for pig today than legion. Legion was a fad where all the fotm mains got salty, but pig makes this personal. I play 70% survivor 30% killer and I main pig. Good thing I picked up Michael recently because I have to move on from her now...
---
You‚Äôll never get the community to agree on Tiers outside of that Billy and Nurse are toptier. Some people only consider a killer good for how good they are in a chase, some look at their overall ability, etc. She is midtier imo.
---
Well tbh i never play legion or care to. People are mad that he got nerfed really bad but tbh i don't care what happened to him as long as he became counterable. I woulda been fine if they just removed him from the game. But i am seeing people who like/are okay with the changes. I saw someone talking about how he is good for first hits and map pressure with FF and he's now a full speed M1 killer. IMO that sounds reasonable and maybe even low-mid tier. But i'm not really worried about him.
---
God I hope so.
---
EGC is so underwhelming when thinking about it. Literally the only good thing is that hatch stand offs are no longer a thing. This was the devs chance at actually making survivors feel any sort of pressure, but alas they can't do that. If the timer started after gates were POWERED instead of open then the remember me nerf and gate buff would at least make some sense. The EGC timer should also not be slowed because of survivors that are downed or on the hook. 
---
Nothing about the pig changes are good and I would gladly take removing the EGC if it meant keeping pig the way she is now.
---
Probably for those cases where the gates spawn 5 meters from each other, to give the final survivor a chance to get out of one so the killer can‚Äôt camp both after they‚Äôve closed the hatch.
---
The only thing I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm not great at is winning chases, I‚Äôve gotten better but I‚Äôm still not winning as many as I‚Äôd like. I‚Äôm talking about survivor, I didn‚Äôt even think to mention that I‚Äôll add an edit.
---
This has been my experience lately at all ranks on console. The ranking and match making system seriously needs a rework. The devs have no idea how to measure player skill and the emblems actually made shit worse.
---
Plague nerfs?
---
The amount of survivor that DC when they get down first is astonishing
---
I think it'd be best if the bonus repair speed increased for each survivor eliminated, instead of when you're the last man left. That way it'd be way less situational and might actually see play
---
What the blue fuck did I miss??
---
This is damn good! Wow
---
It's almost as if I didnt post this
---
Pig's new power: Make survivors wear a funny little hat so they feel silly when they escape
---
definitely agree that this is being overreacted to. people here seem to have no faith in the develops who spend hours a day play testing the changes they make.  they probably found some reason to make this change with the End Game Collapse coming.  
---
how about we try out the changes before we give feedback.  somehow people forget these are patch notes for a TEST environment.  at least try the damn changes before having a meltdown...
---
and i just made the same observation you did in my other comment, this change really just encourages the pig to use all her traps before the gens are done.  now there's no reason to hold onto any.  I really believe some players might have better results on the pig because of that increased pressure in the mid game.
---
It means you can‚Äôt trap someone after the gates are open and the timer has nearly run out (let‚Äôs say under 49 seconds left). If they escape from you, they can still ‚Äòactually‚Äô escape instead of get an auto death sentence.
---
I recently got my friend to play the game hopefully he sticks it out.  Even at lower ranks I think it‚Äôs worse being a new player.  Killers and survivors down there are I think more toxic than higher ranks.
---
Ruining the experience for killers one patch at a time
---
She didn‚Äôt get nerfed. They made her slower when holding down vomit but buffed the time her vile purge affected items and did one other buff I can‚Äôt remember off the top of my head.
---
Bugged for Hypbrid Panda too
---
Why would they call you a trans slur, what is it anyways?
---
Sad times x1000  :(
---
Yeah people would just dc agaisnt the pig if they didn't change it
---
On one side yes, but on the other hand you have to close the hatch mid-game to make them worthless and I don't see survivors run or find keys every single game
---
I think active traps still kill if you leave the exit gates so she can still have some late game power if you do it right.
---
agreed.  this change really only affects players who use RBT as a late game crutch to get maybe 1 extra kill.  also the TR change is great.  I've seen too many survivors die because the pig is camping the last box and there's nothing they can do if the hatch isn't open and the pig refuses to chase.
---
Edit: I am unable to spell because of my anger.
---
:(
---
1000000000000*
---
If the pig has saved her traps till that late into endgame and a survivor goes down and is trapped then thats that. Pig would be really dangerous in endgame but thats fine, 3 minutes is a long time. Against pig it would also be wise to not open the gates til necesarry.
---
Again the pig would have to not use her traps all game and then trap multiple people after the gates were opened and even then it wouldnt be a guranteed thing.
---
if you see players like that, it most likely they have NOED 100%, so i think you have enough time to cleanse totem as well. NOED doesn't need to be changed just because you face that kind of players
---
Haha the truth is funny sometimes
---
Legion went from useless and annoying to just useless.
---
One of the few times Pigs RBTs were useful are now gone. 
---
Remember me got nerfed for no reason and Left Behind is still useless (you can make it 200% bonus repair speed, it wont matter if the killer can just start EGC by kicking the hatch)
---
Now I'm just waiting for the Freddy rework to disappoint some more.
---
Instead of taking advantage of a camper they all huddle around doing nothing
---
I have said "what the fuck is this patch" out loud about... 16 times since reading those notes two hours ago.
---
If all the changes in this patch go live unaltered... yeah.
---
They shortened the time to open doors, as well as nerfing the perk that would counter that change. I wonder why. It's not like the time it takes to open gates has that much of an effect on the End Game Collapse. Since it only begins once a gate is opened.
---
I suppose it would totally fuck over a sole survivor in that his timer would begin if the Killer closed the hatch and now he was to open the gate for 40 seconds out of a possible 180.
---
But now they're useless if the survivors complete the gens. This is fucked for those of us who don't use Ruin because our gens go so fast and Amanda is bad at getting quick hooks a lot of the time. No, fuck this
---
thats some clean burning
---
not only is that not fixed, they also changed those notification bubbles and i don't know if they are bugged or something but they just don't work. if you don't pay attention, you won't even know if someone got unhooked, you don't hear that explosion sound whenever it happens.
---
does this only happen to me? i swear there are just no notification noises, i know that they changed something about them, i read it in the patch notes but i think that it's just broken.
---
The RBT is now an even weaker Deep Wounds.
---
Great. Just great.
---
Yea I guess ur right but she still has another power and I rather her be underpowered than an absolute monster.
---
The reason for the hatch in the first place was to give survivors one last chance. If killer can close it, they still have that one last chance now with the exit gates. If Pig is allowed to force the survivor to have to complete another objective within 3 minutes (remove hat) then it's absurdly strong. I don't agree to all the nerfs but that one seemed like it wouldve been an unintended buff.
---
Woah hey that's my meme! That's fricken cool
---
What happened to Remember Me ?
---
Then don‚Äôt jump in the hatch. Once it closes the EGC automatically starts and you can try to open both doors
---
Seems like you have no idea how any of this works:
---
3minutes is, assuming no one is downed or hook, still 30seconds more than the max time to remove a trap. Also this max is never reached. Then 30sec is more then enough to run out. Also ALL of this is assuming you dont just run out the gate with the trap on. Get your facts before you attack my girl like this.
---
Lol nerfing killers, youre stupid, they are buffing killers, go play killer back in 2016 and tell me killer is worse now
---
Got nerfed to hell. Read the patch notes.
---
Her traps aren't useless. The best way to use them is to keep survivors off of gens. That still serves a purpose.
---
You're the one who's not understood. 
---
Pig has been in desperate need of a HUGE buff. Instead she has now been nerfed into oblivion. In the endgame she is now completely useless. The main selling point of her has been removed. 
---
The main appeal of DBD and what keeps it fresh, is each killer is essentially a different game, you need to adapt and change your playstyle accordingly. Pig would have been op in endgame but that would have been a challenge and a welcome buff. Pig is a joke now and this nerf is a spit in the face to anyone who paid money for her.
---
That part is to get rid of her also moonwalking, I've had it happen a few times just because the killer hated a particular person. It's really by far the least of the nerfs. The other 2 utterly destroy her endgame potential and render her traps useless after the last gen is done.
---
Yeah, no
---
She wouldnt be an absolute monster, shes mid tier now with the changes she might be a bit stronger at endgame but not that much, they didnt even leave pig to see how she would be effected they just detroyed her
---
lmao I‚Äôm actually done playing this game as Killer. Nothing but pointless nerfs.
---
Please tell me the killer buffs that came with this ptb then
---
So now Pig loses her power if she doesn't down anyone before the last generator is completed.
---
Such good design.
---
&gt; but she still has another power
---
huh? 
---
&gt; and I rather her be underpowered than an absolute monster.
---
she would not have been aN aBsOlUtE mOnStEr if nothing was changed
---
WoW is a dead game, don't hold your breath on classic bringing any life back to it. Blizzard has thoroughly proven itself completely incompetent over the course of BFA, having learned nothing from Legion. I'd be amazed that anyone still plays it, if I didn't understand the addictive models.
---
I‚Äôll make sure to delete them
---
I'm glad I bailed on this game considering how fucked it's getting now.
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs a go to for me every time a survivor DC‚Äôs
---
No I agree they don't need to be lethal, but they need to rework he RNG with them or rework how they work.
---
I think it's so adorable you think anyone at BHVR cares enough about balance in this game to base it around anything.
---
You say camp boxes, but a killer can camp gens now and still now find a single player. It's not as simple as just camping jigsaw boxes, there is plenty of them.
---
There's still fatigue time you can't close the gap by cancelling frenzy  unless youre lucky
---
Huh ive never seen anyone spell "this game" as "Huntress" before
---
How was it that you were trapped towards the collapse? How is it that the Pig, in this shitstorm, manages to find and down and trap all these scrambling folks?
---
Is it wrong that she should be able to punish the survivors apparently deciding to impale themselves on her blade instead of opening the (25% quicker) doors?
---
Yeah, if she manages to get you and your friends in the endgame you're SOL, but why _shouldn't_ you be? At least three of you should be out one door, and any killer can facecamp any last survivor they manage to down.
---
Rip all pig. The biggest effect of this change is that it's removed all strategy to using her traps, they might as well be an action speed reduction condition and nothing else, that's about as much as the pig can interact with her own power.

&gt; The Pig
---
RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. *NOTE:¬†Initiating the End Game Collapse will not complete generators, but will block them. This means that any inactive RBTs will remain inactive.
---
The RBT timer now stops if the Survivor is within the Terror Radius, as opposed to when in a Chase.
---
Nah, I can see it now. Noed pig that saves all her traps for late game would be fucking stupid as shit.
---
The best way to use them is to slow down mid game *and* put on end game pressure. This inherently takes away *an entire play style/strategy*. It's fucking insane
---
I‚Äôm like 95% survivor, 5% killer and the Pig was always my go-to killer. I need to find a new main asap which will be hard considering I‚Äôm rubbish at all of them, damn.
---
He guys I found a dev! atleast I think. this one is also braindead.
---
What? Where are you from? Is the total opposite for me
---
Fungoose also thinks Hag is in the top 3 worst killers. So I don't know hoe much credit this guy has.
---
"A welcome buff"
---
nope. It would have just made her broken as shit.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you think the Pig should be immune to any nerfs whatsoever. The devs balance goals are going to be Killer ambivalent.
---
You missed the point though as to why i claimed you were being biased.
---
You can't say survivor exploits take longer to patch out than killer ones and base it on the fact that survivor exploits didn't get patched out until BHVR started actually patching exploits in general and now that they're patching exploits in general, a killer one didn't get to last as long as the survivors did.
---
It's like saying a Mom favors her girl over her boy because the girl got away with harassing her brother for a year before the mom finally put her foot down and now punishes both children equally anytime they act up.
---
The idea is that yea, the mom sucked for waiting so long to start punishing her kids. And one kid got away with shit for a long time. But now the mom put her foot down and is treating both kids equally on punishing and that's how it is from here on out.
---
No ones getting away with shit anymore. Both are being treated equally now regardless of who got away with what in the past.
---
So going on about the boy being punished while the girl got away with shit for so long is being biased and ignorant to the situation.
---
Hopefully you can see that now.
---
Haha its okay im messing with ya friend
---
Dude I was totally just messing with ya.
---
&gt; free
---
I main Nurse because nothing in this game compares to the control i have over survivors and the game's pace.
---
I do regularly play other killers (except Legion) but there's only so much looping i can take ;)
---
Agreed and thats obviously their intention but there are better options they could have done such as slowed the timer if a trap was activated when End Game triggers. 
---
A few people suggested that once End Game starts, a box or two could be blocked or aura removed so survivors still have to go looking before escaping but the strategy of using traps is still viable.
---
I really wish they implemented it that way; the pressure would really be on and you would really feel the urgency of getting your trap off and GTFO immediately before time runs out.
---
July would be the worst case scenario? Summer could mean September
---
I ain't even complaining for myself, but why you gotta attack Americans for no reason?
---
There are *plenty* of reasons to attack Americans, but ping is not one of them. I would know, being one all my life.
---
You better delete this post before BHVR gets any more ideas.
---
Seriously why is having an inferior whispers on trapped survivors which if your a good player you should basically be ignoring anyway a positive thing compared to losing her whole power
---
Give me a pitchfork-
---
Give me a flashlight. I'll make it worthwhile.
---
This is a bad shitpost, the Pigs nerfs were heavyhanded and reactionary but had clear reasoning. Killers in general are strong today.
---
\^\^\^\^ This.
---
It's just my bad luck then. Feelsbadman, so many scratched mirrors wasted :(
---
Have yet to play but here is my thoughts.  
---
Most changes are good, I really like the Wraith change specifically.   
---
End game hype, woo woo!  
---
Sad about legion.  
---
Why nerf pig? That is a change that needs reverting, imo. Nobody asked for it.  
---
Yay bug fixes, thank you devs, that is a sincere thank you.  
---
But also, Left behind is kinda still bad.   
---
WHY nerf Remember me? I think you hit it a bit hard, again, nobody really had much a problem with it.
---
Haha it's weird but that's something i always noticed about wraith. He literally puts his heels together when's just standing there, and his legs being so tight gives him a weird stride when he's moving. lol idk just weird shit i notice. But regardless this is a damn good sketch. Great detail throughout
---
Based of my big test. Yes. In reality it will be 100%.
---
Yes Brother. We will worj together.
---
You've just solved the problem. Rework the boxes and how the pig sees them. Not completely nerf everything that made her a unique killer.
---
unfortunately not. Ideally it would only count downs but it registers any hit as an unsafe unhook (I know from deliverance farming with bt and we'll make it)
---
Hope is meme tier. Its effect is negligible and entirely redundant if you have Adrenaline .
---
When you sneeze into your hand while you're sick
---
Idk man I guess I just do not think as hard about the definition of summer as you do, cheers
---
Yes if hatch was closed/last survivor goes into hatch the traps don't have any effect, that's what I said. Perks that activate with the doors however like Adrenaline and NOED will activate since they are not related to generators.
---
And you're getting downvoted because you're being logical and not complaining. Typical xD
---
What fid they change? Can you send a link with all changes?
---
Seriously you read it? Whispers but worse suck compared to making a non kill power suck more. Walking out of the gates with a trap on shoudlnt happen anyway. What Pig strat is there noe besides tunneling?
---
Literally happen to me 4 games straight way to leave us hanging
---
BHVR STOOOOPPPPPP
---
*Angry AngryPug noises*
---
Jokes aside, never forget that BHVR actually went to the trouble of making a new common Trapper add-on instead of increasing the number of starting traps.
---
They also "celebrated" Year of the Pig by increasing her terror radius, shutting down the optimal time save of Whispers where you would only crouch when the perk activated and could remain completely undetected.
---
And like you mentioned, many people asked for Rule set No. 2 to be baseline, a fair suggestion since the add-on is not overpowered at all. Their desire to streamline add-on quantity and type led to things like this (and to super generic add-ons like Plague's as well).
---
Way too many nerfs for the Legion the two buffs he received and add buffs do not at all compensate. I know many people found him annoying but this is just going too far.
---
It‚Äôs getting completely revamped and now has actual hunters with actual powers and survivors with actual powers as well and the only goal as hunter is to kill the survivors there is nothing to protect just kill those pesky runners
---
With the right build (Dr. Worldwide, Anti Skillcheck, etc.) on the right map (THE GAME) you can make progress EXTREMELY difficult for survivors, negate stealth, and basically undo everything. 
---
Madness 3 disables item use, so that means no toolboxes, medkits, or flashlights. With the right addon you can cause exhaustion, so zap someone up to madness 3 and you can disable stuff like Dead Hard. 
---
Zaps have a 2.5 second "stun" where you can't do vaults, pallet drops, etc. which really pisses survivors off, they think the game's busted because there was no vault/pallet prompt and eat a hit. 
---
You can win the hatch standoff with doc EVERY time (Although I get bored after 5 minutes and let them get the hatch) by mashing m1 in treatment mode and it'll pop the grab off as soon as they jump, although sometimes I grab them and the game acts as if they escaped.
---
I always thought the Legion=DC was a bit of a exaggerated stereotype, but I guess not.
---
"By the time his traps are set all the gens are done"
---
We're gonna exaggerate JUST A LIL' BIT
---
Legion now requires endurance, and vault speed has been nerfed. You guys really wanted to dumpster Frank and the gang didn't you...
---
I was trying to be positive going in to this update, but talk about going a smidge overboard.
---
RBTs explode in your pocket if you get within 25m of a survivor.
---
Jeeze, so now I will just hop into a locker whenever I see a Legion feral frenzy and there is nothing he can do about it, then just get out while they have the feral stun?
---
Seems like the ability is becoming just a worse version of billy since now you can avoid it by going in lockers and by dodging the hit.
---
The end game collapse begins whenever an exit gate is opened or hatch is closed (neither of which count as a generator being powered).
---
In the first case new traps placed just become fancy hats which the pig wastes their time putting onto the survivor.
---
 In the second case, the hatch either remains open to force the survivor to work on a gen and trigger it (with Pig presumably T-bagging the hell out of the hatch in the meanwhile) then closing it to trigger the collapse, defeating the purpose of the nerf entirely. Alternatively, she closes the hatch immediately and it becomes a fancy hat, as in the first case).
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to more pebble time.
---
What is RBT
---
Its on front page of reddit.
---
The funny thing is that I strongly doubt Hillbilly and Nurse would ever be allowed to made today. Nurse has absolutely no downsides other than the player being bad at her. Hillbilly's only real downside is that he can still be looped, but he has a good lunge, an instant down and insane mobility which leads to great map pressure.
---
It's mainly the Terror Radius change that broke her though.
---
this is probably the funniest "reaction" gif I've seen on this sub.  thank you
---
Noooo I was having so much fun with her, and was wondering how the EGC would affect her but I didnt expect these kind of nerfs. Damn
---
No but seriously tell me, how did pig get nerfed aside from the fact that traps in your inventory are useless after the last gen is done? Because that's what I said in my original comment and you clearly disagreed with me and told me to read the fucking patchnotes.
---
He got 7 upvotes in 2h, are you high? It's been mostly killer buffs because survivors were so unbelievably incredibly broken since release that after 2.5 years of mostly killer buffs and a coordinated optimal team of survivors can still shit on even the best killer unless they are nurse. Did you know sprint burst had a 20 second cool down, and there was no slowdown on self care, that survivors could run killers infinitely with minimal skill. This game has come a long way, do some research before you make a claim.
---
Depends on the killer tbh. I think a lot of killers need individual buffs, but I don‚Äôt think they need another sweeping change like the healing nerfs or exhaustion changes. They just need to make certain killers better.
---
You cancel frenzy, bodyblocking the survivor from where they want to go, this is the strategy I used on old legion and it worked decently, but they even nerfed that strategy by increasing the stun time by a whole extra second.
---
You can't close the gap during frenzy cancel, you make the gap that needs to be closed. So when you frenzy, you cancel your frenzy right next to the survivor, this creates a small gap and if you did it at the right time, you could close the gap with your normal movement speed before they reached the next pallet or window
---
&gt; The terror radius change is not a nerf due to the free whispers
---
reasons this is dumb: you know where trapped survivors probably are anyway, you're not supposed to go after trapped survivors so the knowledge is pretty moot. might as well just camp them on the hook instead
---
&gt;  If you put your trap on BEFORE the last gen is done they still die at the gates
---
reason this is dumb: saving a trap or two for after the survivors do the gens is a perfectly fine and valid strategy that was removed, limiting how Pig can be played for no real reason
---
The real game we played was actually the friends we made along the way.
---
It removes what makes her unique and interesting, her strong late game
---
&gt; how did pig get nerfed aside from the fact that traps in your inventory are useless after the last gen is done?
---
the timer does not go down if they're simply in your terror radius
---
Amanda was too op tbh.
---
Honestly I can see where you are coming from, and I feel like I could live with these changes if she did receive some buffs to go with it
---
But after all generators are repaired, if you put a Reverse Bear Trap on a survivor, that Reverse Bear Trap will do nothing for you, they will leave through exit gates with the RBT on their head. She lose her end game potential, she lose her identity.
---
The best strategy I can think of is using your frenzy to get the first hit and injure as many survivors as possible, then chase them with your full movement speed to down them
---
Uh, yes.
---
Wait I heard the Pig was getting changes, have they been revealed now? If so then how hard are these nerfs, does anyone have any details?
---
About the whispers: I agree it's not a huge buff or anything but it's certainly not a nerf. That's all I'm arguing.
---
About the second part: Yep, that is certainly a nerf. But not 99% of the killers power is useless now, as the title suggests.
---
I'm almost never in the Pig TR in the first place when I have a trap on. I don't see how this changes much.
---
Play killer. Before you can play well against a killer you need to understand how they work. You need to know things like how long it takes to catch up to a survivor while looping at the different movement speeds. When a survivor kicks your ass on a loop, pay attention to what he does.  
---
[Know your map structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM)  
---
How many hours do you have in the game? There are some things that just take time.
---
I‚Äôve honestly been fucked by running to a loop to find out the pallet was already down lol try to run through and get stopped by down pallet and get smacked.
---
have you been under a rock? there's been a hell of a controversy about how they nerfed Legion far too hard.
---
For that scenario to happen a bunch of other stuff would need to happen, no?
---
- You would need to get trapped and saved/slugged
---
- A gen would need to be done in that time
---
- The Killer finds the hatch before you
---
- You didnt get to touch boxes in the time the other Survivor got found, chased, and downed
---
If a survivor has BL, SB, or lithe it'd be hard to close the gap
---
Pig has 2 powers: Traps and crouching. Crouching gets you close but you will only dash hit or grab a terriblw survivor. So it gets you closer but slower. 90% of her addons are for her traps. her traps werw 50% and crouch 50%. Crouch works as said 5% of the time thus 2.5% of the total power. and the traps are now gone from 50% to 0. And 90% of her addons are a waist now. so 99% of her kid is gone. Crouching it self was not special already.
---
This shit right here is how I know they just don't quite have a grasp on the elements in their game and how they interact with each other... 
---
Like I just don't think they're looking at data the right way or something. Or maybe they're looking at the wrong data? This change absolutely makes the game less fun to play and no one in the studio spoke up and said "hey maybe lets not remove the only selling point of this character?"
---
Maybe there's some George Lucas type shit going on? God this game has such big potential but it just shoots itself in the foot over and over.
---
&gt; About the whispers: I agree it's not a huge buff or anything but it's certainly not a nerf. That's all I'm arguing.
---
It is a nerf. Because the whispers argument draws from how the timer does not go down when you're in terror radius. ***that is a nerf***
---
&gt; About the second part: Yep, that is certainly a nerf. But not 99% of the killers power is useless now, as the title suggests.
---
I don't have any interest in n argument around OP being hyperbolic. That's besides the point
---
Letting them bleed out or hooking them would also be a death sentence at that point.
---
If you are not camping boxes chances are trapped survivors are not in your terror radius anyway. Sure there will be times where you randomly ARE in their radius, but then you actually know that you are, which is 100% more valuable than the few seconds you stopped the timer.
---
I've tried a couple of different finishes. 
---
The finishes go really well with the keychains and stuff, but for the coasters, I think the natural looks much more clean. (minus the clear coat to protect them!)
---
I am honored, my friend!
---
Only if they were inactive at the time. Active ones still work as normal.
---
It feels so slow now though, like a slow vault.
---

The thing is you can‚Äôt make cigarettes cancer free, as that would require defeating the entire purpose of cigarettes. A live game is always subject to change, the devs can always change the games for the better, so it‚Äôs frustrating when you criticize the game and the devs basically act like there‚Äôs either ‚ÄúI worship this game‚Äù or ‚ÄúI fucking despise this game‚Äù and act like there‚Äôs no way to enjoy the game while having issues with it
---
Low budget Freddy
---
1. Activate Frenzy and hit survivor
---
2. Check for any other survivors around (If a survivor is found repeat, if not move on)
---
3. Close gap and deactivate Frenzy
---
4. Chase survivor and down
---
That's it. They took an interesting kind of play style where a power is almost always active and turned it into another trapper/wraith situation where your power is almost useless is most solo chases. Don't get me wrong I knew he needed a nerf but you really have to eat that fatigue and it makes it incredibly awkward where you can't do anything outside of finding another survivor.
---
Same play style as Freddy except not nearly as bad. Still revolves around putting multiple survivors at a deficit at all times.
---
The problem is that if you cleanse totems then they have extra time to facecamp an extra person.
---
Can somebody link the details?
---
Please and thank you üòò
---
Wait she‚Äôs getting a nerf?
---
Specifically here: https://youtu.be/WO2SCGfEYiE?t=653 :)
---
I agree. Their power is so sluggish it's unusuable in a chase, it feels like playing Wraith with a longer stun and no speed-boost, but you get a free hit.
---
i didnt know BHVR and devolver studios were the same company!  
---
(small absolver joke)
---
Ace can use those finger guns on me anytime.
---
tOxiC TaBLe daMaGiNG mOisTuRE
---
Do some research? I've literally been playing the game since release, and yeah sure survivors used to be OP but I never claimed they weren't, I stated that killers got more buffs and survivors got more nerfs.
---
And killer is unbelievably easy at this point, like you want to sit here and say a coordinated survivor group can shit on a killer, but an actual good killer can shit in a coordinated group of survivors. Like it's so fucking easy that I don't even like playing killer anymore. I was rank 1 killer back when infinites were still a thing, so by now if you are a killer and still getting shit on after 2 years of buffs you need to take a step back and re-evaluate your own skill level.
---
I'll quote myself from another comment I made: 
---
&gt;Sure there will be times where you randomly ARE in their radius (and not in a chase), but then you actually know where they are, which is 100% more valuable than the few seconds you stopped the timer.
---
And the hyperbolic part is what I was making fun of in my first comment.
---
Then why not decrease the vault speed while using Iridescent Button? Since when are killers balanced around their most expensive addons?
---
The terror radius change will make things awful for regular game play. I always used RBTs as a way to delay things so that I'd have more time to complete my BBQ stacks. With them no longer ticking down while in terror radius, the survivors will often have considerably less pressure to remove even active traps, especially on smaller maps. It also completely screws over my casual TR build that I sometimes liked to run, with Distressing and Lullaby.
---
Endgame collapse overall seems like an unnecessarily disruptive change that will cause a lot of unintended problems, while "fixing" very minor issues.
---
She'd be easy as hell to counter. If she's not using her traps to slow the game down, survivors will easily have enough time to cleanse dulls before the last gen pops. 
---
Then when the gates are open she maybe downs a person and hooks them, by that time the gates are open and the survivors are free to leave or try to save. 
---
If they play poorly she maybe gets 2 kills but most likely she'll only get 1 and the rest escape for free.
---
As survivor, in the US, I get games 2 min flat. As killer 3-4. It‚Äôs a problem that there are no suitable lobbies for you, or not enough killers. If you are having trouble with getting into a game, go play killer.
---
*cough* Nurse *cough*  
---
Having insane map control + chase ability with next to no cooldown
---
I don't think this game is about fairness. I do think Nurse could use some changes (she shouldn't have additional blinks for example) but personally i wouldn't play lot of killer if Nurse wasn't in the game. Is she healthy to the game? I don't know. She's the only killer who can beat an organized god level survivor team, comms or no comms.
---
&gt; closest to what it was meant to be.
---
Having said this, the game is not what it used to be years back, people know the maps, know how to loop and waste killer's time efficiently and what was "meant" to be isn't anymore. Survivors got better, killers got better, devs adapted and molded the game to what it is today.
---
Tbagging is trying to get the killer to tunnel you specifically, so your buddy's can do gens. Some killers see through it, and don't chase the bagger, others don't care and will tunnel him for all 5 gens.
---
The dash is good for survivors on a loop for the charge speed and lunge range, if they survivor is cocky you'll get them on the shorter distance around the loop to them.  I had that working several times around rank 4, 2 resets ago.
---
It literally says rbt doesn't activate unless a gen is completed. If you put one on after all 5 gens are done they can walk right out. It's a fucking problem. Wtf.
---
Yeah, no hatch grab is so necessary imo. Otherwise the killer just camps hatch, waits for the survivor to get close enough, then closes it and gets an easy kill.
---
&gt;Then why not decrease the vault speed while using Iridescent Button? Since when are killers balanced around their most expensive addons?
---
This is just my theory... Trying to understand and justify why they would do such thing. Changing vault speed because of the add-on would be the logical thing to do but perhaps they couldn't?
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to check that on PS4 but easily 100 hours at least. I‚Äôve played plenty of killer and I know my maps. I just seem to have hit a plateau
---
She'd be decent. But god forbid Killers are actually viable to play right?
---
You seem to be particularly dense, so I will spell it out for you. If. The. Killer. Tunnels. You. Are. Fucked. The killer can literally ignore you to go after the injured guy. It happens all the time.
---
My bet is that it's a George Lucas type situation where people in the studio don't feel comfortable pointing out "hey maybe this is a bad idea." and shit just gets pushed out completely unchallenged.
---
Like wtf kind of QA is like "Yup lets completely remove the main selling point of this mid-tier killer, that sounds fun!" 
---
There needs to be a change of the director position, I think.
---
It was a joke.
---
well look at that, numerical proof that survivors didnt mind playing against Pig, so she din';t need a nerf. fascinating.
---
As a killer I've always looked through the cracks. Sure, Survivors also benefitted from them but I've never genuinely had a problem as a killer with being looped around those jungle gyms.
---
Survivors now have to rely on the red light, but killers have to trust in their hearing (rip me, my hearing is shit) on which direction they may be heading.
---
Just my personal opinion.
---
A whole lot of these patch notes doesn't make any sense and it makes playing Legion feel like you are trapped in molasses. If you got used to Legion the way it was before you will hate how sluggish they feel now.
---
The new changes might have made her a good killer and we all know Killers other than Nurse aren't allowed to be good.
---
Litterally i cant see a thing
---
I guess the idea is that because EGC puts Survivors on a timer to get out of the game, holding Survivors hostage and hanging onto RBTs until all gens are powered basically guarantees kills.  The only way they could change that otherwise is to slow down the EGC when someone has an RBT on them, but then that just stalls the game out which is what they're trying to combat with the addition of the EGC.
---
if youre like me that 5% is the last 5% of a gen
---
Crouch has zero terror radius so that‚Äôs not going to help. The crouch and stalk still works.
---
Also, any pig who plays like that is kinda asking to lose
---
budget whispers is budget whispers no thanks
---
Nah, I left because in that situation there was nothing I couldve done, Nurse or not. If you watch from the start before I get injured the 1st time, she just slashes the air next to her and I get hit. Either way I'm not really ashamed about DCing, usually I dont DC with Nurse until the 3rd hook, but not this time. And regarding my rank, before the season reset my lowest rank was 2. At that point though there are many nurses and I kind of stopped wanting to have a low rank.
---
Ah those are good points. Perhaps they could change it from terror radius to "minimum of: 24 meters or terror radius." That way it's not catching survivors who are barely close to her and it doesn't mess up TR builds.
---
As have I, I brought up how unbalanced the game was to counter your point of all the killer buffs, it's not killer bias, it's just trying to balance the game. 
---
I agree that killer is easy. I play almost exclusively freddy because I enjoy how his power requires you to chase well. But when I said coordinated survivors, I was talking about marths devil squad levels of coordination, I will admit, games like that are rare, but it's shows the potential. I will also admit I exaggerated a bit, my bad.
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr What are your thoughts on this? Just a small suggestion. I would like to know any issues this might hold.
---
There is the endgame collapse. It's already a gift for the killers. Noed and blood warden are not even nerfed so stop crying please. I'm main killer and actually there is no need to cry, we are already seriously advantaged.
---
They nerfed pig because her traps with the new end game would be just broken as fuck. 
---
They still work as active traps anyway.
---
It's clear PTB is for bug scouting, not balancing.
---
I saw that, but it seems too little too late for that game. Seems like they're spending a ton of resources for nothing.
---
Good players never did unsafe unhooks anyway. This change only affects awful teammates. The only reason to be upset about it is if you're a trash tier player.
---
Think about how broken her traps would be with the new end game collopse and timer. They had to make a change somewhere to balance that. 
---
Also, active traps will still kill them.
---
Not sure how wiggling the gen would help anyone. I'm gonna have to go for the repair option, please.
---
Not even a survivor main. I have played Nurse and it really does not have a high skill ceiling.
---
**whyareyoubooinghimheisright**
---
If they make mending take longer by default, they need to remove Killer Instinct. 
---
Legion can easily find multiple targets, specially with bigger TR now that he is 115% + perks. I don't want to spend a whole match mending all the time simply because he won't chase anyone.
---
After someone goes down I just go into a locker until after they get hooked
---
Which does fuck all when they won‚Äôt activate after the gens are done
---
Nice
---
What if they give it another way to trigger traps, like make them active at the ENC? Like from Exit gates.
---
If they catered to survivors... nurse, legion, doctor, Billy, and NOED would have been removed from the game years ago.
---
You're being silly.
---
There's no "playing against" a decent nurse. You run around, change direction after blinks sometimes, hope you get lucky.
---
You literally have 3 minutes baseline. That is plenty of time.
---
I guess I'm okay with it but at least buff her sneak speed slightly or give her an extra trap.
---
If a killer is camping that hard then don't even go for saves, you are complaining that a perk which requires saves is useless when a killer is trying to prevent and punish saves, obviously. 
---
While I understand that is annoying, but you can't say this change isn't needed, I've been farmed many times by people with the perk, it promotes selfish behavior.
---
As someone in Ohio this actually makes me insanely happy.
---
Let us know if you ever want to make a few sets for distribution!!!
---
Sad thing is though is that no killers are really viable against a good SWF. They will dick on a nurse 9 times out of 10. Its bonkers how bad balance still is.

I can kind of see why they made the change to the endgame component of RBTs, because the Pig can just play for the endgame by running an endgame build (NOED/etc.) and RBT all the Survivors during the EGC, giving the Survivors _two_ death timers they have to try and deal with while being forced to get rid of the RBT first.  Only way BHVR could balance this would be to have RBT'd victims slow down the EGC... but then that stalls/drags things out.  Otherwise the Pig basically gets guaranteed kills by holding onto RBTs until all gens are powered.  
---
As for the terror radius halting RBT timers, kind of makes sense.  It further discourages tunneling RBT'd Survivors.  And Survivors make enough noise with an RBT to where it's not like they'll be able to get away with just casually hiding in the Pig's radius all match long.
---
&gt;Crouch works as said 5% of the time thus 2.5% of the total power.
---
For an Amanda lover, you seem a little uneducated about her gameplay potential. Crouching/uncrouching and ambush dashing can be used to great effect in chase play, especially when using a combination of Video Tape, Combat Straps, and John's Medical File. Good Pig players will use this consistently in chases.
---
Additionally, the main purpose of RBTs is actually to prolong the game, not specifically to prolong the end game, and even with the terror radius change, they do this just about just as well as they always have. Survivors will only very rarely and briefly be in your terror radius with an RBT on, if they are not literally following you around doing nothing productive (or you them, for that matter). They will not regularly be any less concerned about getting their RBTs off, whereas yes, the Whispers-esque utility that comess with this change is an actual, neat buff.
---
Pig nerf contradicts the games of Amanda though. Her traps are inescapeable, so the RBT should activate when attempting to leave. Even though its Jigsaws trap and not hers.
---
Imo, as a Legion main, if I were to change anything it would be that once outside the TR mend goes down no matter what. After reading the notes Frank's is still good just not 'needed'.
---
Yes, but think about how long it CAN take to get traps off espcally if Pig camps them or has other end game perks like Blood Warden. 
---
What they coudlve done is make traps tick down the collse slower.
---
What's RBT?
---
Completely agree, pig was fine as it was, if not a bit weak
---
RBTs are usually an inconvenience at best. I don't understand why you think nerfing them without any compensating buffs at all is a positive thing for overall balance of the character or the game? Or are you under the impression that EGC is somehow an overall buff to killers, so it's okay?
---
How was she op tho? She was mid tier at best
---
They mostly players versus randoms though. It's no surprise that someone with 4000 hours will demolish someone with a few hundred.
---
he measured it in the previous survey that he linked in post, 7 out of 100 disconnected so 7%. This survey was to determine which killers prompt most dcs, so it's not really useful to include killer dcs here, because it does not matter if you play pig or trapper when you DC as a killer
---
Nobody that camps realistically wants to pip
---
I‚Äôm sorry she was my favorite killer after I got her tbh and she does not deserve this. She needed more not less
---
Lmfao, absolutely not. All killers besides nurse rely on survivor mistakes to get downs. A good 4 man swf will beat any non-nurse killer 99 times out of 100.
---
Blood warden isn't that situational. I al.ost always find someone to hook after gates are powered.
---
I'm watching a streamer right now and they brought up that Billy needs to be nerfed.. yall are silly to think hes balanced when he can race across has insta downs and no cool downs...
---
That‚Äôs beautiful! And yeah, I‚Äôve tried nurse on ps4 and it wasn‚Äôt a fun time. I got the game and kept blinking through the floor üòÇ never again
---
So was mine
---
I'm not a Battlefield player, don't take my word for it; I only play games like that when my brother buys them for me and forces me to play with him, and he hasn't made me play since BF4.
---
No i used a glue stick. The Gray marks on her face are ashes stains
---
RBTs do pop so long as you place them before the last gen.
---
They have a timer and it can take awhile to get traps off depending on luck, not to mention pig camping.
---
Restart your computer
---
Okay I think I‚Äôm blind, what was changed exactly? Sry I must‚Äôve missed it in the patch notes
---
I don't do that, because it's idiotic. That's how Pigs lose games. At that point you might as well not bother putting a trap on at all, and just tunnel. There's no benefit.
---
I said it before, I am going to say it again. This new chapter every 3 months and mid-chapter patch after 6 weeks thing is not working. Not because I think BHVR is incapable of doing that, but it requires so much work. According to that roadmap, they have to release 8 big patches per year. 4 of them include new killer, new survivor, new map, new perks and add-ons, maybe even new status effect. Other 4 with reworks, buffs, nerfs and tons of bug fixing. I am not even talking about hot fixes and other small patches+events. 
---
I have no idea what is the situation right now but the next chapter must be ready, and they should be able to test the next killer (or killers) by now if they want to follow that roadmap. I don't think they can focus on everything.  
---
Because of their busy schedule I don't believe they think twice anymore. Pls BHVR take your time, don't release new chapters for awhile, fix the bugs and issues, bring the dedicated servers, complete any reworks on your list(could be killer power or add-on or whatever), and then continue releasing 3 chapters per year instead of 4.
---
They did so pig mains cant abuse end game mechanics
---
&gt;Nobody that camps realistically wants to pip
---
I know but OP is talking about being a viable strategy. It isn't anymore. People camp because they want to. 
---
Before the current emblem you could still pip through facecamping.
---
He has some pretty sweet tits for a guy :)
---
You dont understand, THEY FIXED THE MATCHMAKING SO LOBBIES WERE INSTANT, its not that there are no suitable lobbies for me, there are so many its ridiculous, the entire AU population on the game isnt just going to die over night, they reverted the mm changes they made and now its broken again.
---
This kinda ruins the whole point of rbt doesn't it?
---
Really? Do you main Sally?
---
As I said, I exaggerated, buy that caliber of survivor team is still possible and is difficult for any killer to win. I'm not saying survivors are too op and need nerfs.
---
fr , lol hypocrite .
---
They still trigger as normal If they are active.
---
Hooking or slugging means there‚Äôs a chance another person will rescue them. 
---
If they‚Äôre the last survivor, you may not get a chance to hook them, due to DS, or if they wiggle free. 
---
You aren‚Äôt making a case for yourself at all. If bleeding and hooking them is an auto death sentence, then there‚Äôs no need for the trap to work at that stage.
---
i did
---
Yes but in that regard she is also too op in the right hands, Billy allows for more jukes imo
---
You're doing good work out there, OP. This is some high effort deep fried shitposting.
---
Mmm... :weary:
---
Oof.
---
Same. :( 
---
*sad oink*
---
Or just make the collpse move slower when the traps are on someone
---
i understand your frustration, i really do. but those facecampers, well, are bad, if they're trying to catch someone, i'm pretty sure that that survivor are capable to run them for a gen or even two
---
&gt;  I wonder why.
---
They don't want killers to be able to kill. Mark my words. One day survivors won't die anymore and it'll just be a race for the killer to see how many hooks he can get before they escape.
---
Was joking(if it wasn't obvious enough).
---
Very very good but short legs
---
only in English, both UK and simplified (US), however strangely not Canadian, probably because they use 2 languages and French is in line with others
---
In my country it's actually the opposite and I've seen more commas then periods to mark the decimal point on the internet too, which is pretty international
---
hell, even calculators have the comma marking for decimal point and they aren't made specifically for Poland (which is where I'm from)
---
He might be the best for the game, but Nurse has the best base kit, undoubtedly.
---
Must be the same genius that increased her terror radius from 28 to 32m, because people were crying out for that/s
---
The issue with the RBTs at endgame is that if a Pig holds onto them and uses an endgame build they can basically secure free kills by not using the RBTs until the gens are powered up.  
---
RBTs during the EGC would also put _two_ timers on Survivors, forcing them to deal with the RBT before the EGC ticks down.  The only way BHVR could've balanced this is by having the EGC halted/slowed when someone's got an RBT active.  But then that just stalls/drags the game on which goes against the intended purpose of the EGC as a system.
---
I think Wraith is pretty bad honestly and I am a Wraith main.
---
I mean, it is a decent perk. You will absolutely be a nightmare in that situation for M1 killers. It's just very situational, unlike adrenaline which is just guaranteed to be good every time you get the last gen done
---
When did this happen?
---
I agree, just base kit, nurse all the way
---
How does this only have 23 upvotes??????????
---
Wait what?! Thank god. Killers can actually use their brain on coldwind now.
---
Mine were broken :) But tbh I got to at least 3 tokens in 1/2 times
---
Spirits tend to mindgame themselves.
---
^^Totally ^^not ^^speaking ^^out ^^of ^^experience..
---
You didn‚Äôt actually guess the rework details, both of your guesses were wrong.
---
I do use my controller. I played some of the PTB earlier today and found it a lot better. Maybe something to do with this change - Adjusted controller joystick inputs to allow for better movement control
---
Lmao I remember that. Even survivors knew how silly that was.
---
Rip Pig. There was literally no reason to nerf her RBT into the ground.
---
Heh. Street Fighter.
---
End game collapse is pointless. If you aren't out of the open exit gate in 3 minutes you were fucking around anyways. If the end game collapse was half the time then I would agree. As it is it will never kill a survivor.
---
Nurse lost a blink and Billy lost the flick. Those were pretty big.
---
&gt; It is very easy to find survivors with RBTs on just by approaching the boxes and looking out for the timer.
---
doesn't quite jive with
---
&gt;It's not like it gives the survivor a lot more time to get their RBT off, since they are not usually in terror radius while doing so?
---
It _does_ give survivors more time. It's very rare to get a RBT kill to begin with, now you're going to get even less if your terror radius is in the same area as someone who's doing their box.

---
Pigs can still crouch to pursue survivors, so.... this fixes absolutely nothing when it comes to hardcore tunneling
---
I‚Äôm going to get downvoted for this, but I sincerely believe her change (and only this one) to RBTs and the endgame was required. If you had 2 or less people and that happened, you‚Äôre fucked, if she hated you, you‚Äôre fucked. If she closed the hatch and you were the only one left, you‚Äôre fucked. It‚Äôs the same kind of ‚Äúhow exactly can you counter play this‚Äù that everyone hated with legion. I do agree she should have been given some buffs along with these changes, though.
---
The little bitch complaining said "Playing killer used to be fun but now it's only stressful, I used to love playing killer, win or lose it was fun but currently it's only stress and anger, killers aren't feared anymore. Do you have any ideas on how to improve the killer experience". That entire rant isn't a question on what's wrong with the game, but rather what's wrong with the player. If he was any good, the game wouldn't be stressful. I'm not a bad killer by any means, I win WAY more than I lose and I've never felt stressed out. I'm sure the only people who feel that way are the garbage players who bitch and moan about balance and never bother getting better. I play maybe a few hours a week and even with this current rank system I'll be rank 1 soon. Listening to what McCote said, there's really no other way to take it, other than "No reason to stress out, just take a break for a bit, video games shouldn't make you feel that way". 
---
Personally, I would've told the guy "Get good kid, quit your crying". I guarantee that kid whining to the devs expects to win 100% of the time. I win most of my games, but I have a few where I just get destroyed. Lately ALWAYS SWF using Mettle of Man, Adrenaline and Dead Hard. But those are few and far between. Bad players always cry for Buffs/Nerfs. Good players adapt and unfortunately, most of this community don't bother figuring out how to deal with anything. Just cry for Buffs/nerfs.
---
The buff was that the Pig is a 1.1 M1 killer
---
And the thing is, if you were going to tunnel you didn't need the RBTs at all. It's just a waste, she's fast enough to just get the down again after hook. 
---
Putting an RBT on was an incentive to NOT tunnel because they are only useful when you leave the survivor alone and go after another one.
---
Now you might as well just tunnel and not even use RBTs.
---
Pig mains in the PTB: please just stop using traps, and tunnel. Show BHVR this is nonsense.
---
This is what I have been saying, how often so you even have a inactive box on your head anyway
---
What did they kill? 1 rank 20 per game? lol so OP. But even then cant those Pigs just crouch and follow?
---
The Pig has a good kit against new survivors but any killer is good against new survivors. Against good survivors the Pig is a joke and everyone knows that.
---
maybe
---
I really don't understand these scenarios they're putting forward.
---
Ok, so, imagine that everyone is standing in a line and Pig (who has NOED) walks down the line and downs then RBTs every one of them. And then Pig continuously teleports to all the boxes. THIS IS NOT FAIR - THE SURVIVORS HAVE NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE.
---
could we also change some of legion's nerfs...?
---
please?
---
Wait, is collapse tomorrow? I‚Äôm so excited for no hatch standoffs.
---
Oink.
---
I still have hope and it looks a lot better
---
You either got unlucky or survivor mentality on PS4 is different from PC when it comes to breaking totems
---
That's a blatent gamecist lie.
---
They needlessly fucked miss piggy real bad.
---
Nope
---
You don't have clipping when stunned. Survivors walk right through you. Fun fact the speed of vaulting pallets is so slow that it's better to just break them. Surprise surprise
---
So i could stand by a gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch and get a near guaranteed escape?
---
If the killer finds it first, leave and do gens. If the killer doesn't want to leave with the hatch open, they now have the option to close it. Hatch grabs were one of the most intense parts of the game and should not be removed.
---
All the bad rank 20 survivors did
---
He's being downvoted because this update completely takes everything out of the Pig's hands.
---
In order for the Survivor to have been put in that no-win situation (Which, btw, is totally on flavor for Amanda), they would have had to:
---
- Been chased and downed.
---
- Pig would have had to have a trap remaining.
---
- The player didn't get the RBT off while the other players were being chased.
---
- The pig found the hatch before the survivor did.
---
- The pig knew where the Survivor was and was able to stop them from pulling it off.
---
Even with only one survivor left, the Pig would have to patrol 5 or so Boxes across the map. There would be plenty of time for the survivor to pull it off.
---
I love that they're using the character themes, really gives the killers so much personality!!
---
Lol I think people aren't freaking out due to reading it improperly. "RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed."
---
It's pretty damn clear.
---
Yes, and then they get facecamped until 1 gen is left/the gates are powered, and then the killer uses the insane buff from noed to get a couple more kills.
---
Completely useless is much easier than trying to make it balanced - behavior, about legion and pig probably
---
no you are not.
---
That still isnt that bad imo. The 9 percent is the adjustment of their movement speed. Roughly each percent is 2.5 m/s so going from 5.32 (I think) to 5.0 is a 9 percent drop in speed.
---
Judging by the complaing, i think they did
---
They nerfed my baby?? What did they do to her??
---
Well, if there are only under 49 seconds left another survivor would need to get from the exit gate to the hook, save and go back to the exit gate again within that timeframe while evading the killer. Even with the slowdown this would be impossible to do on same maps with certain RNG gate placement. 
---
My point is that there will always be situations in which a survivor is doomed to die. Especially now with the new 3 minute timer if you are hooked or downed towards the end of the countdown. Slugging out onw guy until there is only a minute left and close the exits with Bloodwarden, dooming all other survivors in the process. Slugging your obsession with Rancor, knowing that the last generator will pop in a second. A pig can always still crouch behind a trapped survivor after the last gen pops and he will certainly die etc. etc. there are lots of ways to do it.
---
&gt;You aren‚Äôt making a case for yourself at all. If bleeding and hooking them is an auto death sentence, then there‚Äôs no need for the trap to work at that stage.
---
I see it from the opposite position. If there are already ways to make sure a survivor wont get out then there is no reason to prevent RBTs from doing so. It adds more tension fighting against certain killers and certain builds. I think it would be fun having killers that are stronger in the endgame.
---
I never play end game pig so I don't really care about that portion. But I think the timers pausing while in her terror radius is a huge nerf to her mid game. The point of the RBT is to put pressure on the survivors to get it off. Now if youre in her terror radius there's no pressure, you can just sit and chill. It makes no sense that they would think that is a necessary nerf.
---
I hate it when they all try coming for you and just huddle around behind rocks waiting for him to leave. Like DOING GENS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT DISTRACT HIM! Seeing the generator visual cue pop up over and over again might cause them to go somewhere else. This is why you do swf, or bring kindred
---
I disagree. If there are more posts, it will cast a larger net out for them to see.
---
I just want head out of the grass. I don‚Äôt use it because I can‚Äôt see shit.
---
Why don't survivors start with bear traps on their head? Would that really be OP, nothing will ever be Nurse level. And it's similar to movies.
---
I would rather the pig be over powered in a SITUATIONAL mode that isn‚Äôt even guaranteed to really occur, then completely gutted. Some of the funnest games I‚Äôve had have been against the pig, endgame. I was actually looking forward to gaming against the pig during the collapse
---
Forgot your number 7, and one of those 45‚Äôs need cheese
---
So, if I understand correctly, not only can you run out with traps that got equipped after the last generator was done, they also don't do jack shit on any other department? My whole pig strategy was saving my traps till 1 generator left. This is no longer viable it seems
---
I know what a stupid thing for that kid to lie about lmao.
---
The most despair-inducing event in the history of Pig.
---
the meter pausing while in terror radius is bullshit.  however, does it mean that if you crouch and your terror radius is 0 that the traps keep going then?
---
besides that i see no reason to keep traps for late game.  unless you wanna chance getting someone down with 1 gen left
---
Still doesn't make her easy to learn. She is a high tier killer for a reason and most would say she has a high skill c·∫•p.
---
Oh look, another drama queen. My post is and will remain relevant as long as this subreddit exist. You are nothing but a bunch of drama queens. Every time a change is made, no matter how small = "EVERYTHING DEAD, OMG, FUCK YOU BHVR". Small change to a killer? "OMG, THE KILLER IS SO DEAD, CASPER IS TALKING TO THEM".
---
Calm your panties you bunch of whiners.
---
Spoken like a true survivor main.
---
Good outfits, not particularly good in my eyes for sneaking, but ofcourse I haven't actually seen them in action, so maybe I'm wrong.
---
Indeed it is!
---
Either I'm the one who's brainded or this is clearly satire, either way i'd treat it as /s and call everyone who thinks this is real dumb af
---
Also like, I don't even get it? Like, I get they're changing perks to work better with endgame collapse, but since it starts when you open an exit gate I don't see why they need to shorten it.
---
Like, maybe when you close the hatch it could be a problem, but like, that's the point. They aren't changing Bloodwarden which is going to be 100% more annoying with endgame collapse.
---
I mean it is logical. Its not good, but it is logical.
---
Get out, Nea is ugly af.
---
why you gotta be so mean to the stab gang ):

Scott Steiner wrote this

EGC is just a way to force survivors out...

I knew there was still endgame potential if you got the trap on before the way gen was done, but still. A lot of people have been asking for a pig BUFF. Like, this would have been a way to buff her without even actually buffing her.
---
&gt; Yet there were pigs who literaly did just that.
---
Dude I have over 3,000 hours in this game and I have never _once_ seen a moonwalking Pig. Lmao dude come on.
---
whats the counterplay, tell me
---
While that's true to an extent, people are making their voices heard this time, you only have to glance at the forums and see what people think are unnecessary and justified
---
People aren't happy with legion or pig changes or gate opening times but seem content with the new hatch mechanics
---
Umm.. the whole endgame maybe? Braindead moron
---
While yes her traps would be a pain in the ass to deal with, that‚Äôs kinda the point. They should just make endgame collapse longer when they have traps on their heads. Furthermore, WTF is the terror radius not triggering bear traps bullshit? I don‚Äôt know about other Pig mains, but I used them as fire and forget, rather than moonwalking. U can‚Äôt cheese a pig trap as easily as u would Legion.
---
Sounds like a DCer.
---
&gt;Nurse needs nerfed.
---
But I can forgive u for this.
---
I hope that Behaviour pull they‚Äôre heads out of they‚Äôre buffs and make pig go back to normal into of this shorty nerf
---
He should have to open lockers to get fuel canisters to power his ability. Like Huntress.
---
You will get used to it
---
kindred is a must have without swf. i usually bring a toolbox and try to get 1 gen done fast as possible when playing alone. usually though im about 70% through, someone gets hooked, and immediately attempts escape straight to struggle *sigh*
---
how downvoted this? how is it wrong?
---
You would obviously only intentionally approach boxes specifically to find the respective survivor, in which case you regularly don't care about the timer. Otherwise it is a mere chance-occurrence that you happen to be around a box a survivor is trying to get their RBT off on. And not only that, it would only be a brief occurrence, since you are not usually occupied in one spot for a long time - and even if you would be, since you can see that the timer is stopped, you still have the choice to leave/go into crouched stance to remove your terror radius.
---
Obviously going from having the timer continue to tick down in your terror radius to not having it tick down is a downgrade, but even regardless of the utility it also adds, I just cannot see the substantial nerf other people apparently see in this. Precisely because RBTs are not really likely to kill - without specific add-ons or specific (inefficient) ways to play, anyway - I don't see why them now being marginally less likely to kill is a huge issue. They will still take just as long to take off, stalling the game, fulfilling their primary purpose just as well. And I'd even argue that the Whispers-like ability allows the Pig to more effectively do make sure a survivor with an RBT on dies to said RBT, if they so choose, since with this interaction, you can pretty easily tell which boxes a survivor is still trying to get to, and so if you keep chasing them away from there, or camp those boxes crouched, they are bound to die.
---
I might try out Wake up whenever I happen to actually play survivor after the patch, ~10 second gate sounds so good :D
---
did he dead hard across?
---
I agree +5% movement speed was worth losing a power.
---
Because entitled gamers aren't just an American thing, so it's weird you're deciding to paint it like that. It's not offensive, it's just inaccurate.
---
Bugged for me as well, not sure whats going on. Played 4 games same bug.
---
Based on the other decisions they've made as of late he'll just become another M1 killer... Or should I say he'll become a worse M1 killer without a semi-cool power.
---
as someone stated below, that's unintentional, and its going to get "fixed" soon, and sometimes not using m1 isnt an option if you want to use other killers, and sure it doesnt stun you, but the survivors get a speed boost from getting hit.
---
See I actually feel like it‚Äôs harder to watch the newer seasons. Machinimas have a sort of classic feel to them. I feel like anyone can still go watch and enjoy Freeman‚Äôs Mind and that‚Äôs made in HL1. But once they switched to the hybrid CGI sort of stuff it kind of loses me, and a lot of people I know who used to watch. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre still doing that though because I haven‚Äôt watched since season 8 or so. I remember when season 9 started coming out I tried to watch it but it just felt like they doubled down on that style I didn‚Äôt like. Did they eventually get away from that and just go back to it being in-game, or no?
---
Im starting to think you're right
---
then your idea of a "high skill" level is just not that high. And since we're here making claims and assumptions without any sources, I've read that many have said Nurse is really not that high skill c·∫•p, and that Spirit for example takes more skill.

I think it might still activate when all 5 gens are done, even if you put it on after. It seems like it only won't activate if the gates are powered by closing the hatch.
---
At least I hope to god that's what it means. If traps don't arm once the gates are powered normally shit's super fucked.
---
Everyone disliked that
---
(X) doubt
---
Yeah I recently tried to go for adept killer achievements on PC.  I‚Äôm a survivor main and you have to play a perfect game to get it while as a survivor you just have to escape which is way easier.  Hopefully the new changes direct the game and community in a better direction.
---
Because something with her power had to change with Endgame Collapse. They probably did go too far but they didn't decide to do it just because.
---
I think it's pretty obvious at this point that the devs don't understand what makes a killer powerful. They've nerfed mid to low tier killers time and time again and never touched Nurse.
---
These changes would've made pig actually pretty playable, but apparently that's too much.
---
Xbox. Never that hard to find Killer matches. If it is it‚Äôs typically even harder to find survivor matches.
---
read other comment reply
---
And if she does that strategy then all 4 survivors will likely be alive as the only thing she has going for her is ambush and just regular M1 killer stuff.  She's choosing to not use the majority of her kit until the *very end of the game* for this kind of build, it would actually be at least unique and give her options instead of every single M1 killer being enduring/spirit fury/ruin/perk of choice.
---
Considering the EGC already is 3 minutes long after *a gate opens*, the timer is slowed by half when someone is dying or on the hook, you got plenty of fuckin' time to run to the boxes.
---
It completely changes her potential. And that‚Äôs devastating for the people who main her. She‚Äôs been needing a buff, not a downgrade. The collapse would have buffed her without even buffing her. Plenty of killers are OP... this gave the pig the chance to be OP in situational circumstances...
---
Instead they‚Äôre like nah let‚Äôs make her power utterly useless, forcing a lot of people to change how they play her.
---
Nope just insane
---
Just in case you haven't found the patch notes yet:
---
It already starts with a general change where they reduce the base time of opening exit gates from 20 to 15 seconds
---
Remember Me used to be that it takes 5 extra seconds to open the exit gate everytime you hit the obsession up to 20s/25s/30s
---
Now it takes an extra 4 seconds up to a maximum of 8s/12s/16s.
---
So before the patch, you could increase the time to open the exit up to 50 seconds, now at max you'll get 31 seconds. Only 11 seconds more than the base time of opening the exit gate before the patch
---
Can't she just crouch though and do the same thing? she just has to camp the box crouching and she'll have no terror radius.
---
I am legitimately curious what problem the end game collapse is intended to fix. The game is over once the gates are open unless you have someone hooked, but they'll die on the hook before the collapse does anything anyway.
---
I'm glad hatch stand offs are gone, but I don't see why they've added this needlessly complex phase to the game that required so many nerfs and changes just to make work.
---
"a bit of extra time" goes a LONG way to change the outcomes of games
---
How did they change WGTLF? I thought it already was 50/75/100?
---
Woah I...the fuck? This is going to straight up dumpster her! I really hope they don't pull through with this nerf.
---
Okay who am I antagonizing?
---
yeah I guess you're right... didn't think about that.
---
The killers dont feel powerful enough to deal with genrushing --&gt; eliminating one player is the best way to even the ground --&gt; people get tunneled so that it can be a 3v1.
---
Punish camping by making the entity progress slow down by 100% if the killer is nearby for too long. Or increase their luck (chance of getting off the hook) when the killer is nearby.
---
Buff m1 killers so they dont even think about tunneling since they are actually killers now, and not just pallet dummies who have to secure 1 kill before they can play a normal game where they have a chance.
---
Pig is absolute dogshit
---
Anyone not playing Nurse/Billy with the intention to win and not just have fun is hurting themselves more than anything.
---
Everyone else has extremely well defined weaknesses that are extremely easy to play around. 
---
Trapper you just need to watch your step and hes an m1 killer. 
---
Bing Bong is an m1 killer since he is so easy to spot a mile away on most maps. 
---
Myers is trash until he hits tier 3 then is decent. 
---
The Hag requires too much setup to work consistently for what Nurse and Billy do baseline. 
---
Huntress hatchets can be easily side-stepped by even rookies and thus you need to mind game the average player, aka too much work for mediocre results. 
---
Leatherface is essentially just an m1 killer cause his chainsaw is useless. 
---
Doctor is an m1 killer with gimmicks and hoping people cant hit skill checks/fuck up their timings
---
Freddy is unplayable until his rework
---
Pig is an m1 killer until she catches someone with a shit dash attack. So a VERY shit legion.
---
Clown is a BIT better than an m1 killer but not by a huge margin
---
Spirit is a shit Nurse who relies too much on mindgames
---
Legion is just weak without strong addons and even then still falls short of decent by a good margin. 
---
Plague is a bit better than average but not by much
---
I BROUGHT KINDRED ONE TIME AND MY TEAMATE DIDNT GET ME WHILE THE OTHER TEAMATE WAS BEING CHASED! HOW OBLIVIOUS CAN SOMEONE BE
---
Judging your response, I think you skimmed my comment. Please reread. You've taken 3 of my points and then addressed them almost the same way I did. And yes, you can defend and criticize something because not everything is perfect this isn't a "you have to 100% support something" world
---
They must of thought the teabag reduced timer change to 3 minutes was a bit much, better add 5 seconds.
---
How is "survivors could just not open the gates" a good argument when the Pig could literally begin Collapse herself? As it stands now the timer speed would not be changed with a trap on. It's very easy to imagine the Pig slugging someone, putting a trap on, beginning Collapse, getting another trap on when survivors attempt a save, and then being able to get kills because she's patrolling gens.
---
Keeping the Pig's traps as-is wouldn't necessarily condemn survivors to guaranteed deaths once Collapse starts. However, it's bad game design to have a mechanic that would literally make it impossible for a survivor to escape, even if they've been in the game for "too long"
---
But she needs a buff to compensate. Either a shorter trap timer or smaller terror radius.
---
You can get a refund.
---
Damn. I was really looking forward to it. Hopefully dbd will actually get some decent competition in the future.
---
Not enough to kill the game or anything, but just to make the devs start thinking harder on their decisions :/ 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
So can Oceania players stay p2p until we get servers? Pretty fuckin ridiculous to expect us to connect to Asia.
---
Her traps aren't useless. It will still kill you if you try to leave, unless I'm missing something. It just makes it so the EGC timer it like new timer for the RBT, so it's not a check mate with you get trapped.
---
Like I said to the other person, my point is that the changes to Legion are harsh, but necessary, whereas Pig's nerf is totally bullshit
---
you basically just described what the perk does, but I made this to discuss how balanced it is, do you agree or disagree that its old DS 2.0?
---
The Endgame collapse now doesn‚Äôt sound as good. I guess if you‚Äôre chasing a Survivor and you both find the Hatch it‚Äôs an automatic free escape for them. The exit gate buff was also unnecessary. Seems like all of the extra parts of the Collapse and the Pig nerfs were kept secret until today in order to prevent proper backlash. 
---
The Pig nerfs are ridiculous. She didn‚Äôt need those nerfs.
---
Okay but Nea's eyes are actually like gorgeous to look at
---
atleast you have that much, recently started to play alot of Pig
---
gets nerfed
---
guess im going to back to freddy
---
remember me nerf
---
guess im maining survivor now with left behind only :/
---
They still activate after all the gens are done, just not when EGC starts. So any smart Pig player should just start EGC asap if they're trying an endgame build.
---
Now needs safe unhooks, I stopped running it ages ago anyway, you never get 2 stacks let alone 4. Now you have to essenntially run borrowed just to get a stack against most killers
---
üëèüëèüëèüëèü•áü•áü•áü•áüèÜüèÜüèÜüèÜ
---
Fuck this. 
---
I can't put up with 6+ more weeks of this audio nonsense.
---
DO THE DEVS EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT AUDIO IS?!
---
you dont want to be downed by it the power is not fun if you have to use his power
---
Eh, not really. You can certainly prolong the chase, but the windows will still get blocked off, and if you're passing through the door on the top floor, the killer will still eventually catch up.
---
Yeah my psn name is DaddyIsStressed
---
well im sorry you're just wrong :)
---
Isn't Sharp-Hand Joe a 110% killer?
---
Yeah but when you compare it to lets say brutal strenght - a perk that you use almost every chase, it becomes painfully obvious why bloodwarden isnt top tier
---
LOL ARE THEY FUCKING SERIOUS?!
---
Via PS4?
---
The killer is baby rank facing rank 8 survivors.
---
why would you let a 5 year old watch horror films?
---
If the pig begins the collapse shes not chasing anyone which lets them remove traps or avoid her, then she has to find and down someone without a trap with an exit gate open and then they have over 2 minutes to take it off once free of the hook. 
---
A pig could tunnel one guy but literally every killer in the game can camp the hook and do the same
---
&gt; people here seem to have no faith in the develops who spend hours a day play testing the changes they make.
---
Like the flashlight guarantees a drop when you use it at any point during pickup changes? Or pallets stuns working at any point during the pick up animation changes? Those were just really clever and showed the devs knew what they were doing, right?
---
They are humans, they aren't invulnerable to making mistakes/nonsensical choices just because they are devs.
---
It might not be the most op thing but its is the most annoying thing except legion. Getting tunneled and hunted backwards is unfun and abusing gameplay. Most pigs also tunnel survivors with hats on which is the opposite way she is meant to be played in.
---
But Whyyyyyy tho
---
She's not even that strong
---
deep wounds isn't suppose to do much its about the same as doc t3 its to get you a free hit
---
Pig can atleast follow in crouch now to force bear traps to trigger despite being in chase. 
---
Pitty Spine Chill is so common these days
---
How cute, you think BHVR actually fixes the bugs
---
Have u ever played Pig? Whoop de fucking doo! She has shitty whispers! Ignore the fact that her endgame strategy is gone, her terror radius makes her unable to pressure survs with traps, and that her crouch makes her slow af, meaning the no terror radius pressure almost nonexistent.
---
Wow! they nerfed the pig? i think im done playing this game.
---
A big part of Pig's build is the ability to play the endgame. I'm talking base build too.
---
Yes, I do believe there is a chance.
---
Pardon my ignorance, but did you buy it on Steam? If so, there is a limited time you can get a refund for this DLC.
---
Can I play Spirit? No I can't.
---
But do I like playing Spirit? Hell yeah!
---
It is not a joke. I just like when the stakes are higher. I play survivor probably 70-80% of the time.
---
More restrictions? Like which restrictions exactly? Opening the gate got buffed as well on the PTB.
---
&gt;There are already perks that do this. Pick one.
---
I don't even play Pig. I just don't see why one should exclude the other. I think having killers that are strong during endgame and a bit weaker  during regular game would be a fun change of pace. Currently every killer wants to prolong the game as long as possible. Having one or two killers who thrive during the last minutes of the game could be cool.
---
I also don't get why you are arguing so agressively. Calm down a bit, lol.
---
What if there are severall survivors left when the gates are open lol. what are you even thinking
---
Legion needed changes. Pig didn‚Äôt need a gutting. And I still consider some of Legion‚Äôs changes unnecessary
---

---
Are 3 Dwights all you have? Can I have 4?
---
The perk itself got a decent buff, the problem is that the end game collapse itself pretty much nerfs it into the ground. Hatch spawns no matter how many generators are done and when the hatch closes, the exit gates will be powered anyways. There is even less reason to use Left Behined since both reasons you'd use it got removed. The last reason you'd equip it is to get more bloodpoints.
---
I'm hoping for the same too. I followed both F13 and LY very intently since kickstarter and was so disappointed by both.
---
You lied to me, there were no perks here.
---
I don't play Trapper due to having to run around and grab his traps, so I would love the change to where he starts with all of them and has to put them on the map. However, I don't play Trapper due to having to run around and grab his traps, so I don't know if this is balanced.
---
frenzy is 120% not 116%
---
Ah, unfortunately it was on PS4 through their store.
---
Amen
---
This PTB has destroyed what little faith I had left in BHVR.
---
They are now on the shit pile with DICE and Bioware.
---
Go play Killer before 2.6.0 and tell me this is better.
---
If your on pc go to the game properties in steam, local files and verify integrity of your game files. It should fix it for you :)
---
Mmh maybe there‚Äôs a possibility to get your money back?
---
I don‚Äôt exactly know they do this kind of things to ü§î.
---
And he's already easy to loop and dodge his saw. So many obvious yellow ranks commenting it's disgusting.
---
Also the traps timer stops if they are in your terror radius
---
Smh do you really think the devs play their own game in order to notice such problems?
---
Ah maybe they should have thought about that.
---
Why not make the trap kill you at the gate only if it's active?
---
That seems better then the first nerf
---
I am wrong with the math. It is more like a 5 percent drop in total speed in frenzy, my bad.
---
It should just be if they are within 20 meters or something.
---
Pig can just crouch
---
Seriously! These changes to Pig, even considering the new endgame function, are completely unnecessary and actually harmful to anyone WHO SPENT MONEY on this killer/DLC. If I were the license holder for the Saw series; I'd be pissed at the way my product has been devalued to the point where the player base (PURCHASERS) no longer have incentive to buy. 
---
End rant.
---
I keep losing out on points because chases aren't lasting long enough. Like, I'm sorry I catch them fast? I am also pretty sure I miss out on points in Tier 3, because I'm getting less hit points with an M1. Gatekeeper and chaser emblems need to be tweaked.
---
At the cost of movement speed and less map pressure. I thought the current trap mechanic was fine
---
End game collapse is barely ever going to come into effect anyway 3 minutes is a fucking ETERNITY after the gates already OPEN (not powered but fully OPEN) and it takes even longer if anyone is down/hooked. the only thing that EGC prevents is holding the game hostage by refusing to leave, and hatch standoffs. They are literally mercing the pig to fix those two problems.
---
Hell just making the hatch closable and power the gates, and completely removing the timer and then leaving the pig alone is a much better option than what they did.
---
It's 100k players strong cause it doesn't cost 15$/mo
---
As developers they have far greater insights into the game than you do don't you think? If you ever watched a streamer that knows how to play pig you would have known that this change wouldn't be a "nerf" in that sense
---
You got moon walked for 2.5 minutes? It‚Äôd be better for the pig to just down you and face camp for 2 minutes instead. Not at all comparable to legion moon walking. Just because a killer can tunnel doesn‚Äôt justify nerfing them, especially considering pig is mid tier anyway. At least compensate if they are going to throw her under the bus.
---
I stated my point poorly, but what I was trying to say is the devs will have a better understanding of how these changes play out than players judging the changes on paper (obviously). like you said, that doesn't make them immune to mistakes.  I trust that they've tested this change, and other big changes (like Legion for example), in many different iterations to a point where they are comfortable sharing the iteration they are most confident with on the PTB.  and if players aren't happy with how the changes turn out, I have faith that they will keep making changes until people are happy, even if they have to make changes after the live release.
---
They did that? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Well said.
---
Did the fucking Deathgarden team do this update?
---
stop trying to play dlc killers please! Youll ruin all of them!
---
The Pig has come to join Freddy down there.
---
Whoop Dee fucking doo. A broken clock is right 2 times a day... so they reworked 1 set of maps... so what? Legion is dead. Pig is dead. Remember Me is dead. I‚Äôm just waiting to see how Freddy gets worse...
---
Ayeee 
---
When you get owned so bad you have to just congratulate the other person üòÜ
---
Eh, some changes are good, but I find his super slow slides over pallets and windows while in frenzy a shit change. It looks awful, it feels terrible and I know for sure, I'll never use feral frenzy jumps without iridescent button or bamboozle.
---
She can still crouch, which eliminates her terror radius. So if the intent was fix the moonwalking exploit.... this isn‚Äôt going to do ANYTHING.
---
2.5 minutes of that is also way too long to be efficient for anyone.
---
-1/2 pips all day everyday boi.
---
No one cares
---
Would you like to retract that statement now?
---
I can't pip past rank 5
---
Great question my illiterate friend!
---
I just wanna reiterate that "I dont let her do shit" as, again, i am not her parent
---
Whilst also pointing out that the horror film portion of my comment was meant to compare it to DBD where its tame compared to tame horror films.
---
Next you're gonna say "I was only pretending to be retarted"
---
And I'm gonna say "nice JoJo reference bro but please no more stupid questions"
---
So if we can leave it there that would be great
---
Brilliant name
---
Then a Gen had to be popes for the exits to be powered. The only way to open the gate with out a Gen is by the killers own hand
---
I thought summer was May, June and July?
---
ACCURATE
---
I just bought her a week ago :(
---
If I wasn‚Äôt me and I saw a guide to win every match, I would care.
---
Yes it does. This measures which killers are most frustrating to play against. Killer stats will measures which killers are most frustrating to play as.
---
So 7% of Pig DCs, what about the others. Depending on rank, I bet Nurse will be higher.
---
It doesn't matter if you were being chased with the RBT on since your timer pauses then. It's not frustrating 'cause the pig simply wastes time doing so and prolongs your life. Loop her and she just fucks herself over. There's no need for nerfs.
---
Imagine always being on Coldwind
---
REPAIR NOOB
---
Well legion is just a base ms killer now their power wont be strong at all.
---
I dont know why downvote just because we have different opinions. Im sorry i have different experiences than you.
---
Legion is actually still pretty decent and while the Pig nerfs are super unnecessarry and should not come to the live build...they hardly kill the Pig and will be irrelevant in most games.
---
She's not even close to low tier.
---
Gens pop and i down 2 survivors with traps both of them can escape.
---
Thanks. Not sure why that didnt register. Will go throw myself on hook now
---
I just started getting into her Allso i feel ya :\
---
The RBT timer stops if you are within the killer‚Äôs terror radius or in a chase, and survivors can now leave through the god damm exit gates with the traps on. The whole point of the RBTs is too slow the game down and keep survivors in the game. Pig was already a mid-tier killer, this basically made her worse than she was before
---
Precisely
---
I don't even own the Saw chapter, and even I can see how stupid this change is.
---
It makes it useless, because you generally *want* people in your terror radius, and to be applying just enough pressure so that they don't feel safe enough to remove it, but also so that it keeps ticking. That and the fun moments as survivor where it leads to a cat and mouse game of the survivor trying to pull their trap off, while the killer tries to find them and stop them before they can and escape? Gone.
---
But considering how your only defence/reasoning is that Killer players are whining, and bad, I can tell you're not going to listen to anything anyone says anyway.
---
Cause Behavior thinks everyday is april fools day. They just never reveal that it's a joke. What's next? Oh yeah the Freddy rework. To make him balanced they will triple the time to get survivors into dream state. But he gets a 5% speed increase to make up for it.
---
Eh, some Pigs (though I haven't seen it in a LONG time) would just follow you while crouched and have you die by the trap, or block you in the basement with a trap on
---
I main Pig and it makes any endgame pressure I would gain due to Traps become Thanos dust
---
That these patch notes even exist has already done this.
---
It's almost as if these devs were competing with Riot Games on who can make more ridiculous balance changes.  
---
They could've just fixed the Legion bug instead of utterly gutting him along with the Pig... Completely unnecessary nerfs to already mediocre killers.
---
Being facecamped is annoying but I hate when I play killer and get accused of camping when I see there‚Äôs people near the hook, why would I let you just take them off the hook?? It makes no sense
---
Yea, that's a pretty stupid and toxic way to play
---
Are you rank 20
---
Killers: "I hate pallets"
---
Nurse: "....what's a pallet?"
---
I don‚Äôt even want the end game collapse at this point. Just revert everything. (Well except the legion changes. Please keep him nerfed)
---
Pls don't Nerf my main bhvr, she was already low enough, this really was the chance to make big a better killer
---
Same for Wraith, Freddy and Trapper. They still shit tho...
---
Doesn‚Äôt help as we can‚Äôt see shit through the corn
---
Do one for Pig
---
Something something MAH SKILL CAP something something.
---
They decently gonna change the no sounds add on for it is op
---
you must put /s if it's a joke. How would we know otherwise? there are dumb people on this interweb...
---
I fucking hate BUVR right now they are a bunch of dumb fucking ass hats who don‚Äôt know what they are doing
---
Yes, I play Pig.
---
The RBT's have always been pretty garbage and I've always considered them a secondary gimmick.
---
They never score kills and their value in slowing the game down is entirely based on luck.
---
They've gone from having pretty much zero value to me to having a little bit of value to me.
---
I mean even out of endgame, in your terror radius they just stop, so they're only useful if you just go away, which then just means they're going to untrap for free, since you can't pressure them without pausing it.
---
And knowing BHVR, they're gonna remove the timer so the killer can't use it for detection.
---
You for real? It's never been so easy for killer. This tiny changes won't make a difference anyways
---
Made on purpose
---
It's because since the killer is the server, once they leave there is no way for the game to keep track of the lobby, that's why you don't have to in kyf.
---
&gt; How about you getting put on the hook with 2 gens left, 1 person dead, and as soon as the other gens are done, she spends all of her time tunneling you while the other two are forced to leave?
---
She'd have to find you first, which is she is tunneling you right off the bat means that your team didn't unhook you safely. Their fault, not hers.
---
&gt; Better yet, what if she knocks them down, puts a trap on their head, rushed back to find you, and starts another cycle that makes two people die instead? 
---
Then she'd have to prevent two people from searching boxes, which means she has to be in two places at once.....
---
legions power you need to hit more then one person with it to get value while doc dose have the power to block windows and pallets but ageist a good survivor doc power dose nothing however no matter who your chasing the 1st hit is always free also you can use the speed from your power to body block people
---
Yeah I only ever saw it a few times. Thankfully most Pigs aren't SUPER toxic, but they ARE up there.
---
And this is coming from someone who enjoys playing her.
---
(I mainly play Wraith, Trapper, Pig and Legion, though I doubt I'll play the latter much now...)
---
Here you see the crux of the issue.
---
GENERAL REPOSTI, You are a bold one!
---
True
---
You should probably censor all the names
---
U killed the Pig
---
It makes sense and I think it was necessary, but they really should give her something to compensate because Pig's end game power was one of her niches.
---
It's not a buff, it's a rework, which could be a buff, "could".
---
It's why most pigs I see run the pallet eating build
---
I'd consider low mid tier so yeah not low, not as bad as Freddy, def above Bubba personal tier list tho. Still didn't a nerf tho - _-
---
New headcanon: The Pig is kinda a masochist?
---
I‚Äôm sorry you take downvotes so personally
---
 Both pretty gutted tbh
---
They turned her into bacon
---
7% of all killers dc'd, not only pigs
---
it doesn't make sense because you dc because of the opponent, not because of yourself. Measuring against killer opponents makes sense because people don't choose the killer they are set up against
---
If killer DC's it's against survivors so the equivalent statistic would be how many killers dc against Claudette, Jake, Bill etc. but it's kinda redundant with numbers low as 7% and 17 different survivors (you would have to get a decent sample size for each of the 17, which would take a looong time), also it's pretty easy to estimate that killers don't care which survivor you play as long as it's not p3 claudette
---
also if certain killer frustrates you then you simply don't play it, killers dc because of the survivors, not because of their own killer choice. And if you for some reason force yourself to play as a frustrating killer for example for daily or to farm BP you never DC because it loses you the whole progress you made and forces you to spend more time playing unfun killer than less
---
I've never seen the playerbase say anything like that.
---
And something needed to be changed about the pig to fit the new gameplay changes coming, I doubt these changes are the whole picture.
---
I only played F13 to laugh at the pure jank of the game. And yeah I want other great games but alas here we are.
---
Legion takes some kill to play now RRREEEEEEEEE
---
Thank god. Matches been so laggy lately.
---
well keeping the politics outside games is important, but yeah Russian gov is \*\*\*\*\*
---
Very much how I feel. This is going to punish the honest, non-tunneling pigs trying to make the game more fun for survs, not the hardcore tunnellers who can still crouch or even just facecamp.
---
Bold of you to assume thr devs listen to the community
---
All they care now is fog whispers opinion
---
Hell, I've DC'd sometimes because the killer will just be so laggy &amp; glitchy it's like they're stretch armstrong with their hits.
---
They really should have at least gave a compensatory buff lol.
---
How dare I don't overreact and decide to wait to try it myself? This isn't politics. We're all fans of the game.
---
Wait it is? What was it before?
---
Wot
---
His power is still shit because Deep Wounds isn't a threat and you can clenase it way too easily. Wjhy bother hitting people if hitting them wont do anything?
---
Wasn't this posted the last time there were changes on the ptb people didn't like and didnt those same changes get pushed to live anyway?
---
Dude, billies‚Äô easy to dodge bro.
---
I love how it also pays respects to the legion update
---
I think it went live on PC yesterday? Idk I might be wrong
---
That's weird, I was going to suggest it might be because I'm on PS4 I never see her! Just different luck I suppose. Usually for me it's Myers, Trapper or Billy. Rarely see Pig, Freddy or Clown.
---
i bought her recently and really love using her and it sucks that she‚Äôs collateral damage for this update
---
Ummm...  Ok.
---
WAIT STOP! Which nerfs?
---
Maybe there needs to be a playlist without perks. I know I personally don't enjoy the perks in this game at all, but it's still fun enough when lag isn't crapping on it.
---
I'd buy it as a makeshift dildo to fuck me in the ass when i realise how much I've wasted
---
Wow this update really is shit
---
I feel like the idea for "best" got lost in the conversation a bit
---
"Best" was originally used referencing the devs thoughts on the pig. Clearly nobody is delusional enough to think the pig is the strongest killer, so I assume they mean that they personally believe the pig is the best designed. I think what the person is claiming about Billy is not that he is the strongest, but he has the best design in his opinion
---
I literally just did. We may not see it but devs see the win ratio so updates, fixes and changes typically have the goal of getting games to 50/50.
---
132% that is faster the bl3 right now on ptb your around bl2
---
For this to happen, the killer would need to find, chase, AND hook someone else AND close the hatch, all while the player has the RBT on their head and chooses to do absolutely nothing about it. That should be enough time to at least get through at least 2 of the 4 boxes, which means only 1-2 more (if it's not off) and the exit gates, which is difficult but not impossible.
---
You keep insisting I'm skimming your statements. I'm not. Again, just because I didn't quote the entire paragraph doesn't mean I didn't read what you had to say. I just don't agree with you is all. I don't think that your way of framing this overarching problem is productive, it's purely dismissive in character.
---
Nurse mains can \*claim\* they have the high skillcap character, but Pig's Ambush can wallride and surf shit for awesome falling attacks in the right hands. just look at this:  
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyVictoriousYogurtOneHand](https://clips.twitch.tv/NastyVictoriousYogurtOneHand)   
---
I'd like to see any \*Muh skill cap\* nurse mains try to do stuff like that. Shame fun stuff like that isn't encouraged by also having a good power.
---
I am in no conceivable way supporting these nerfs. Instead of immediately attacking the devs all I want to do is take a more understanding route and spark proper discussion so that the proper changes can possibly be made. I love the Pig and don‚Äôt want to see her reduced to being absolutely useless. However, I think CHANGES need to be made to accommodate EGC. I‚Äôm not saying nerfs, but I believe she has the power to become impossible to beat in the endgame if she‚Äôs kept in her current state. I can‚Äôt suggest any changes because I hardly doubt I could come up with anything better, I even said all of the nerfs were unnecessary. Yes, the survivors don‚Äôt have to do gens to get hatch. But immediately writing that off as a nerf for the Pig is shortsighted. Sure, they may find the hatch first and escape but that is the same scenario that would happen before; but it‚Äôs not like the killer always loses, that‚Äôs why EGC was added in the first place, so that they can avoid hatch standoffs. 
---
All I want is for the game to be enjoyable for everyone. I love this game and I want everyone else who plays to feel the same. I know there is a very fine line between making one role better than the other and while the devs ARE slow to make necessary changes it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt happen in time. Something is better than nothing.
---
Maybe that used to be his opinion. But his top 3 worst are pig, doc, and legion. And he has said that a great hag is terrifying. His argument is that she is difficult to play properly but when done well, she is a monster
---
&gt; 7% of all killers dc'd, not only pigs ( to quote the post I and OP referenced, his previous survey : "Out of the 7 DCing killers: -2 were Hillbily -2 were Trapper -1 was Huntress -1 was a Leatherface -1 was Myers -1 was Freddy ")
---
So this previous stat was more worthless than I thought because there's no measure of how many of each killer he's faced.
---
&gt; it doesn't make sense because you dc because of the opponent
---
Yes. If you get run around for multiple generators, always losing the chases, can't find anybody, lose multiple downs due to pallet/flashlight and general survivor fuckery, you'll DC. Similar to this post.
---
&gt; If killer DC's it's against survivors so the equivalent statistic would be how many killers dc against Claudette, Jake, Bill etc.
---
So how many of those 67% Legion DCs were Quentins? Besides, survivors are just skins. Yes, even P3 claudette.
---
&gt; also if certain killer frustrates you then you simply don't play it, killers dc because of the survivors, not because of their own killer choice. 
---
By that logic, then there's even more reason to do this study because every killer is playing a killer they're good at. If they can't do shit with their favorite killer, then what does that say?
---
I feel like that's always been the case with PTB - everyone uses their top add-ons/items recklessly bc the progress won't be transferred to regular game
---
Smacking lower tier killers is a great way to balance your game, no?
---
He can, he just has to cancel the power the moment you jump into it. So by the time you get out you'll be in lunge's distance.
---
Think of it as dodging Nurse's blink hit.
---
For some reason I like the idea that the devs would listen to the community only if we put our thoughts in meme form.
---
&gt; They only ever activated when a generator was completed... 
---
When the survs completed every single gen, any traps put on them were instantly triggered too which is most likely gone.
---
The terror radius nerf also is going to do more to incentivize tunneling trapped survivors.
---
I mean you can just bait out head on by walking up and stopping at a safe distance.
---
Do we really need advanced stats to say 
---
‚ÄúHey maybe we should see what happens with current pig...after all it‚Äôs a *test build*‚Äù
---
And it‚Äôs not like BHVR has ever irrationally made a nerf or bad decision... they never once nerfed a certain fedora boi.
---
The biggest issue for me was that it just didn‚Äôt look fun, and it was clearly trying to attract the fortnite crowd with its battle royal mode and wacky loot box weapons.
---
You are still a bias survivor main tho
---
As an ex-Ace main, the smile was exactly why i played him. Hooked? Smile. Mori'd? Smile. Always smile!
---
And i mean, i like hoarding stuff so...
---
I mean if it's called an issue then I'd wager that it wasn't an intended interaction, just the same way Nurse or Spirit can't do it when using her power.
---
TIME FOR A FUCKING CRUSADE!
---
I was not the person who stated the original comment but ok werk
---
Bruh what the fuck, that is sometimes the only way to catch a survivor in the end game. The devs are fucking up killers for no reason
---
the terror radius change is a big nerf, everyone here is complaining about how traps arent ‚Äúlethal‚Äù at end game since traps arent automatically active if you down someone and trap them at end game. Didnt expect anything less from this subreddit
---
And traps applying any kind of prassure during the match as timer stops...
---
Just checked online. It seems that Ireland (where I live) has a different calendar, so the summer starts in May for us.
---
&gt; Terror radius thing seems like a natural change given they went the same direction with legion. You can pretty easily trick the game into thinking you're "not in a chase." You can still stalk them to "chase" and get the tick down.
---
Crouched pigs don't have a TR so this will do absolutely nothing to stop tunneling pigs (meaning it just punishes those who don't). Also, if Miss Piggy REALLY wants you dead, she can always just facecamp you.
---
Survivors wanting to survive and experience the endgame isn't tryharding. That's people wanting to, ya know, SEE WHAT THE ENDGAME IS LIKE. It's the hottest topic of PTB right now.   
---
Each game I've been in where we reached the endgame, survivors have been more than willing to just die because they want to see how everything looks, and because the BP's/Rank you earn don't tenasfer back to your main account.   
---
Can't very well see the endgame if you're getting sacrificed because killers feel like tryharding, when again, you GAIN NO BP/RANK ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT.   
---
It's not that hard to understand really.   
---
Or maybe that's just how killer brains work.  
---
:)
---
good down my dude. 10/10, would disconnect again :D
---
no but seriously, good job, that's impressive.
---
I know, I'm sorry! They keep finding me! 
---
However, if I go play Doctor maybe they shall hail me as a hero...
---
Tbh as I rewatch it doesn't look as God tier as it felt in the moment  but also I'm not going to willingly make things harder for myself.
---
Also the disconnect really completes it.
---
Isn't it still in PTB and therefore subject to change?
---
And I read the notes, I'm confused on what this is doing that's so bad.
---
&gt; Why would they buff the door opening time and nerf Remember Me
---
My guess would be that they want the 1 survivor who got hatch closed on them to have a chance to open the door with the killer patrolling, especially in situations when the gates spawns close to each other.
---
It's one thing to abuse your awesome add-ons when you're not doing third hooks or camping or tunneling. It's another to come in and just wipe the board when you gain absolutely nothing on your main account, and nobody gets to see the endgame anyway because of it.
---
That's your fault for not using your traps before the last gen was powered
---
oh you're gonna play that game, punk!
---
Yeah because we don't see every game that happens and aside from us making educated guess we don't know how often pigs get over on survivors. Unless we know the numbers, it's all speculation.
---
Complete hogwash. This is the most disappointing thing in the update. The pig didnt have many strengths, but toying with people in the endgame was one of em. I hate this change.
---
Sure, the point of a PTB is to make adjustments before the changes go live. But this isn't the first time they've done something so \*\*\*\* stupid literally anyone with 100+ hours could tell them the idea was idiotic.
---
Not that I am surprised. It's the same people that thought removing timing from flashlights was a good idea.
---
Also, no MoM nerfs. M1 killers still unplayable above green ranks. God forbid you dare want to play someone other than Billy. But hey, easy p2w cash.
---
Not even close to being as bad as people are making him out to be, I'm actually having a lot of fun playing him.
---
lol. This dude has posted this THREE times now, this being the third, and he‚Äôs deleted it the past two times.
---
And yet, he‚Äôs always going ‚ÄúLoL I dOnT cArE wHaT nOoBs ThInK‚Äù yeah, clearly. 
---
Grow the fuck up, dude.
---
Lol, isn't that just wallpaper engine?
---
I'm so glad that cheese is gone. Now I don't dread every trial I have against a Legion.
---
(I'll still never touch him though because he's the only killer in the game I genuinely don't like, he can stay at level 1 for all I care).
---
Fun? If you cant afford a 10$ skin you shouldnt play games all day and get a job
---
Survivors can‚Äôt dc for 20 hours, continues into other games
---
We don't need to pay to play on the Badham map, though. There's very little reason for anyone to buy the ANOES chapter now.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve been playing mostly Plague and not Pig recently cause of these changes go through I‚Äôm never touching her again. Christ, those are bad changes
---
This includes wraith right? He's a big cutie &lt;3
---
That's a good change tho, he ignored the mechanics of the game and completely removed any skill out of the chase.
---
This is much healthier than what he used to be.
---
That‚Äôs not entirely true. Granted I‚Äôm around rank 12, but I find Pig to be very good early and late game. Her ambush is great at the start and when checking boxes. Late game, her with surveillance is awesome if u chose your gens wisely. Her traps just bridge the gap from early to late. Well they used to anyway...
---
I don't have 2k hours in dark souls by getting up at 6 in the morning and going to work!

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
No one gives a rat's ass
---
I mean all it does is that you can't blindly farm people, which imo is good.
---
Sure you can use bt and get a safe unhook anyway, but at least you are bringing bt.
---
The power is not fun if it doesn't do anything.
---
Should we be nerfing TRAPPER next?
---
If you‚Äôre a Freddy fan, you‚Äôll get it just for him, even if he isn‚Äôt very good (Freddy‚Äôs the whole reason I got the game in the first place- however, that was essentially at his release before he became the meme he is now).
---
Yet they nerf pig for no fucking reason
---
Bhvr:did you say nerf trapper?
---
I mean requiring the unhook to be safe is a good thing, you shouldn't be farming your teammates.
---
You are the resident Pig ambassador of r/deadbydaylight
---
Usually after two weeks.
---
Nerfs Myers :(
---
Stalking through cracks was a blast.
---
That‚Äôs the PTB friend. Most of the player base doesn‚Äôt even play on the PTB. But I get what you‚Äôre saying
---
Then change the way timers work at endgame. Don‚Äôt disable half of her fucking kit during the final moments of the game.
---
We can always comment to change her back in the PTB feedback. Its a PTB for a reason.
---
Honestly only the nurse actually makes me worry at this point, the spirit is annoying but relatively simple to counter, Billy is good at map pressure but his chainsaw is easy to dodge, clown is good but most people play him wrong.
---
And then you get the nurse, where if they are even somewhat competent you are going to lose.
---
Since 2.6.0, sound is fucked.
---
Good luck getting 4ks when the hatch is always going to spawn.
---
I mean if you don't farm then this nerf doesn't affect you in any way, even if you were using WGLF.
---
This change only punishes people who blindly farm teammates, which imo is a good idea to implement.
---
Survivors can now eat parts of the pig to regain health
---
True but I play on console so I can‚Äôt test
---
I just don't get why they didn't just put her on Beta and let people, you know, TEST her as-is. I have a hard time fathoming that they fully tested her out internally with this.
---
Yeah lmao
---
True but I play on console so I can‚Äôt try it
---
I thought was intentional! It looked super awesome when you had corrupt purge.
---

---
Nerfs wraith instead
---
I don‚Äôt think that is right. Closing the hatch is giving the killer the ability to tell the survivor GET OUT and end the game. 
---
EGC is all about not letting survivors hold the game hostage (intentionally or otherwise) by not escaping. 3 minutes with slowdown when someone is downed is way more than enough time to GTFO. 
---
I had 3-4 games I can remember where the survivor stayed immersed for nearly half an hour after I killed the other 3 in their SWF. That‚Äôs what this stops. 
---
With the gate time reduced, the survivor should be able to get out without much issues, barring bad hatch and gate RNG placement. (And barring Nurse or Billy.)
---
* Feature - Games that would start with less than 5 players are canceled, and all players still connected to the server will be returned to the tally screen (keeping their items, add-ons and offerings) and notified about the cancellation.

God Bless.
---
I just wanted to be a mama bird and feed my survivors
---
Probably. Devs don't even play their own game at this point

I'll give you something better! A video!

---
Is this person fucking serious?
---
Great work with the update!
---
No, it's my credit for saving 2 traps for endgame. 
---
You've clearly never played Pig.
---
Well the thing with billy is that he is a relatively easy character to get decently good at. Once players learn that you can travel from one side of the map to the other in a few seconds they usually dominate lower to mid level games. I‚Äôm no master at survivor believe me, and I get good survivors can really dominate over billy. I just don‚Äôt like that him (and the nurse) have the ability to traverse the map no problem. Honestly, I think the spirit is the most balanced killer in the game. Her ability allows her travel quite fast as well and cover some distance, but it‚Äôs limited. This is the kind of thing I wouldn‚Äôt mind the devs adding to billy
---
Asexual Gamer
---
That's.... bullshit...I feel like a nerf to MoM should be that it won't give you the free hit unless you've already been hooked. Turn it into another decisive deal. Make tunneling bad
---
My only "insight" into the game is how fun it is for me to play it. It doesn't matter how much "more" and dev "knows" about the game than I do. If it's less fun for me to play it, it's less fun for me to play it.
---
Also I rode piggie and doctor up to rank 1 like two or three times, I'm pretty well versed in how to M1, but that's still completely irrelevant to this conversation. We're talking about how **fun** it is to play her, not how balanced she is.
---
If the killer is so bad as to not check the exit gates afterwards?
---
Those legion changes are actually so good. Now people can just 360 them with actual outplay and counterplay. The addon changes are great as well.
---
That's what Doctor's bat is for.
---
i would like to point out that trapper has 2 maps where he has no power the game lary's legion power wounds survivors
---
I know right? She can just flex on you with her hatchet and all you can do is DC
---
[Coldwind Changes](https://i.gyazo.com/55f7a9bf9154ffcd0932b184daf16c0b.jpg)
---
I mean the entire idea of the pig is that she is the best endgame killer. She's the only one who can make people stay. So what is she now? Certainly a lot worse.
---
Hmm I‚Äôm going to need to see this one on ptb. This is going to be a veryyyy interesting ptb
---
Hardly play as her but the nerfs were incredibly unnecessary to an already average- slightly below average killer with definitely bad add-ons.
---
the PTB loads up an old save from a few days ago, don't worry, your stuff is still there in the normal game
---
Only because you deleted them like a spineless cunt. 
---
All this big talk, and yet when it comes down to it... you‚Äôre just bad, dude. And stupid. Very, *very* stupid.
---
Fun and good are two different things.
---
Lets open it up to general situations then because you're doubting a "minute" situation of happening. This will make it a lot easier to understand.
---
Not including these nerfs would create an very strong unintended buff to end game Pig. Pigs would just run end game builds and stack NOED/BloodWarden/Remember Me and just save their traps till EGC. This would make end game pig extremely strong and force every survivor caught scrambling to complete another objective (removing hats) just in order to leave all within 3 minutes. Combine that with RNG of boxes and the ability to know where the boxes are so you can camp them would make end game pig very strong.
---
PTB is all the ultra-survivors and they are infinitely pallet looping. I know all the science of how to stop loops. If it's a safe pallet, you get them against the wall and break pallet, they then run to the next pallet, and it repeats. Every 2-3 pallets = a generator, with 11 pallets max on a map that's 3-4 gens done before a single hook.
---
It is lost, none of the progress transfers to the regular game
---
Pretty much just to usher them out if they're hiding. Possibly also for a few Bloodwarden plays, if you noticed they 99%'d the gates.
---
I doubt some of the legion changes will go through they're just too unnecessary.
---
God maybe now purple/ranks wont be 50% nurses anymore. 
---
I swear after MoM dropped its been nothing but billy/nurse/Huntress.
---
I am. My psn is L3gitHyuga1997

Your submission has been removed from /r/deadbydaylight for the following reason(s);
---
* **Rule 8** - Oversaturated Content. Oversatured posts are common &amp; uninteresting posts that do not add anything of value to the subreddit.
---
* Screenshot highlighting a salty chatlog.
---
The trap DOES kill you at the gate if it‚Äôs active.
---
This means you have to put traps on head before the last generator activates. 
---
If not, you‚Äôll only be placing *inactive* RBTs during endgame.
---
This was not an issue before because a survivor with an *active* RBT can escape through the hatch. But because the Killer can close the hatch now, these changes have to be made.
---
He's decent, and I find him a lot of fun. Works for me.
---
Have the traps either stall or slowdown the EGC then, like they do for hooks and downed survivors. Remedies this issue without completely tanking her.
---
I see what you did there
---
I'm not survivor main sorry bro
---
Thanks you! Im going to take my purple items to a field trip then lolol
---
This hatch issue is not fixed.  Heres my scenario as a killer in a hatch standoff.
---
Hatch spawns, I find it. I stand over it because the last survivor undoubtedly will be hiding at an exit gate waiting for me to power the damn thing.  I force the survivor to get into my line of sight before I close it - boom. Game over. No recourse.  No counterplay. Just waiting like we did before.    
---
I said it when they tested it the first time.  I'm saying it now. This. Is. Not. A. Fix.
---
&gt;It feels that way since you addressed points but didn't include other statements. 
---
 Unless they fundamentally change what I quoted, which they do not, there's no reason to include them. The sentences that followed from the quotations do not modify their context, so I didn't waste the space.
---
&gt;Most of the complaints in this sub are along the lines of just complaining and hate.
---
I mean there's plenty of Memes (Many of which are hilarious), but I think that's an oversimplification. They're based on a real critical desire for change. And dismissing those people just galvanizes their concerns further or worse irritates them to flame. These are just the symptoms. They're not going to go away by adding fuel to the fire.
---
&gt;My point there was that the valid and good suggestions get undermined by "X is stupid why havent these devs done anything yet" which is what I saw a lot of yesterday.
---
I think you're wrong about that and you're focusing your attention on the wrong targets. Those people can't actually do anything about the situation they're describing so it's kind of pointless to call attention to the tone of their frustration. So what that they're complaining? Who cares? It's not like they have the final say, only the devs do. So why bother fixating on the quagmire? You're just sinking yourself knee deep in mud. Look to the Causes. 
---
What's really undermining progress is the Dev's dismissal of feedback from their community. We're talking about people that have no power in the matter and blaming them for the continued frustrations that are currently feeding off one another just alienates them further. 
---
The merry-go-nowhere of "He said" "She said" "I don't like the way you said X" is a dead end. Start talking about WHY those changes should be implemented, and it immediately becomes obvious where your attention should be focused.
---
&gt; I am blaming BHVR but just want people to give them time before acting like they are shitty people.
---
I don't know what kind of people they are, all I know is what comes down the pipe by their design. But I do know one thing, they're never going to solve the issues the game is facing by being reactionary with every negative comment that passes by their eyes. The issues need to be addressed by the people with the power to address them.
---
Ah shit post. Was going to say hatch still opens in ptb but...*sips T*
---
KYF involves having friends online and ready to play, and don‚Äôt mind hoping on PTB. 
---
Not everyone has that option. 
---
The existence of KYF doesn‚Äôt magically allow killer mains to be a bunch of tryhards in PTB, ruining the good the of others who want to experience the new endgame feature. 
---
If you want to play for real, how about you play in the NORMAL game mode and let the people who want to TEST the updates play on the TEST game mode. 
---
Try that instead of telling people to gather in KYF on freaking PTB. 
---
(PTB exists for a reason, ya know!)
---
PTB is most definitely not all the ultra survivors. Also, remember as Legion, you're short. You can moonwalk a lot of tiles a lot of other killers can't, and it sounds to me like you're just kinda walking through every pallet. Even the most basic of survivors can deal with a guy who just walks in a straight line around loops until they have to throw down the pallet.
---
Billy main here: the hit box on the chainsaw is too much. On scenarios where I was juked pretty well, I probably hit 50% of chainsaws where I believe I shouldn't have.
---
Also, Carberator Tuning Guides should be purple, and Primer bulbs should be green. I'm always at less than 5 of each, but can easily get more with the blood points due to BBQ stacks, which is kind of BS. I can very easily (and I'm pretty sure I have) play 30 games in a row with primer bulbs and carb guides. This build with ruin is absolutely disgusting in terms of map pressure.
---
If one person gets tunneled, he's there by outplayed?

Sorry kid. It‚Äôs cute how crazy you are for me, *BUT I‚ÄôM A LADIES MAN BUCKO.*
---
Begs and cries for a Legion nerf.
---
\*Legion gets nerfed\*
---
"WTF THIS IS BS WHY DID THEY DO THIS TO LEGION. THESE DEVS SUCK!!!!"
---
lol.
---
-Reverse bear traps lose a shitton of pressure when they‚Äôre safe in my terror radius
---
-traps are useless in endgame
---
-Lastly, it‚Äôs simply because she did not need a nerf, not that it‚Äôs so horrible
---
Nea showing more skin than like 95% of the MK11 girls in this pic lol
---
As someone who would continue to be chased by Pigs and given zero chance to remove my RBT before I'm downed again... those kind of players deserve that.
---
Everyone else, sorry she got a nerf.
---
Then why is everyone upset?
---
This is perfectly fine
---
The main point of this was both misunderstood and I realize now that it was a bad point to make. I have come to realize now that I was being really stupid in what I said here but I still do stand by it to an extent. I enjoy event skins personally because I see them as a kind of badge to show that I have been dedicated to this game for a while. I wear them with pride showing off that I have been playing this game since its humble beginnings and thousands of hours of my life have been spent enjoying it. What I meant to communicate in the post was that I (personally, my own opinion, if yours if different that‚Äôs cool) think event skins should be event specific. I would say the hallowed billy and whatnot should be for last Halloween and that‚Äôs it, but I do think anyone should be able to get cool event skins. I think nice looking skins should come out often for everyone to get, but solo challenge skins I feel should need to be earned through the challenges. I think that if you go through the 10 hour queue and try hard games of an event you should get more of a reward than someone who didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs about all I have to say and will no longer acknowledge this post unless it‚Äôs a direct response to this comment.

The first one, okay, I can get, but that second change, that's not "logical", that's just mean :(

And reddit don‚Äôt? Check my screenshot. You can see the watermark near the top left, yet OP gets platinums and gold and silver
---
...So...? Like, so what? Doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt add it one day. This post is stupid.
---
Legion now moves at 92.5% speed(nurse speed),mending takes 2 seconds and instantly heals,mend can now be done during the chase,Legion now wears neon clothes at all times.
---
"stop crying please" you are with me or against me there is no middle ground
---
Well somehow in your mind two people die the moment they get the trap on their head when the EGC happens, so sure?
---
My problem comes from the ways he loses his power gauge, and that takes about 20 seconds long to refill. You lose your power gauge by getting stunned with a pallet even if you aren't in frenzy, and you lose half of it just for downing someone the only way you possibly can. Why is legion the only killer who has to extra cautious around pallets to not get stunned and lose his ability for that long? The fact that you can't use it whenever you want yet there are ways people can just destroy your abilities gauge, forcing you to respect pallets is a little obnoxious. Also the fact that mending stops the deep wound timer from going down at all makes it a status effect that really isnt that scary. It already doesnt go down in terror radius....why was not going down while mending necessary
---
Freddy still carrying me thru rank 1 matches. Couldnt give 2 shits about any other killer
---
I really, really hate tgis subreddit. Some asshole parades his opinion around as fact and when I realize that there is absolutely no point in arguing anymore because it‚Äôs pointless, some other dumbass comes along and has to chime in with some other redundant shit. 
---
This is why people hate Reddit and also hate this game and it‚Äôs community.
---
looks like a kinder-gardeners art project.

He's in the locker prepping the oven

Whatever it is, it'll certainly be a buff. They want to make him better than what he is right now.
---
Holy shit! I completely forgot this movie existed! God I watched it such a long time ago. Thank you for reminding me, OP
---
Small question, if hatch is close and gens blocked are gates powered? If yes then survivors can still escape, if no can hatch be reopened with a key?
---
You have to be an act bro.  Noone is this cringe in real life.  What you do is the equivalent of bumper bowling.  A rank 20 fresh off the boat in their fist game ever can stand there and camp basement with insidious.  You didn't "win" shit.  There is a reason you killed 4 and only safetied.  That's the game's way of telling you you are trash and regardless of how many kills you get with your pathetic no skill crutch playstyle that you don't deserve to rank up.  Insidious campers and NOED which you use that crutch too are for the weakest players in the community.  You can get all the kills against potato survivors calling for insidious LF you want you still lose games by not ranking up.  You belong at rank 18 with the other no skill trash.  Also you did not get 37k bps lol!  That is the double score multiplier from BBQ stacks.  You struggle to hit 15k bps base playing that babydick playstyle of yours which is insanely pathetic for killer play.  As a rank 1 killer main that doesn't baby camp, tunnel or run NOED crutch I'm telling you that you are a skilless piece of shit that represents the very worst of the killer community and makes the whole lot of us look like babydick assholes.
