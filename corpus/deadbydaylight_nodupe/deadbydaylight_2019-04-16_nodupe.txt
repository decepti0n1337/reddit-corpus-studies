You‚Äôre not the OC stop with the fake. ‚Äú19 seconds remaining‚Äù oh shit better pay up then. Take those downvotes and leave this sub please.
---
Tunnling is the most common complaint I get - not, I hasten to add because I actually do it.
---

---
Recently hooked a survivor (Jane) and while I was chasing another she got unhooked. She then literally runs across my path so I down her and rehook.
---
Got a message informing me that I had been reported for tunnelling and working with the other three survivors (who were also being reported)
---
Apparently breaking off from a chase to smack someone who makes themselves an easy target is a bannable offence now.
---
Blobfish are pretty sad animals, so it‚Äôs ok.  Continue
---
Was fun meme, blobfish approved
---
He directly names it along with F:13 as a "like", making me think it's more of a standalone thing happening, but I'd be happy either way.
---
Like what are we supposed to do not chase you down and kill you?
---
Runningman37 (Twitch streamer) suggested that Ghostface would travel between lockers, which I think is a cool game mechanic.
---
It's weird but sometimes artists do what snow mentioned, sometimes we just want to move on and aren't fond of our old work. Content creators have done the same in the past. There isn't always an announcement in these situations as people want to disconnect from their old fandom or work.
---
She probably moved on and is hopefully doing well.
---
You asking about Dead Meat in general?
---
Honestly, while Dead By Daylight was what made me want to check out the horror icons in game, it was Dead Meat that actually made me do it.
---
I'm a pansy by nature, so being able to watch the Kill Count and seeing that it's not all that bad made me actually pick up the original Halloween (Where it's mostly suspense) and also helped me steer the fuck away from Black Christmas (reboot) (seriously, why throw someone into a wood chipper feet first....)
---
If nothing else, you should check out his Halloween series, they're pretty good.

The devs are now banning for those who abuse the Legion mend time bug as well as 2 killers in a match exploit

See its false. I rage quit like 3 games and went from rank 15 0 pips to rank 17 2 pips

I understand the joke, I even like the joke, but it's a bit too real considering the past few years and the #metoo movement. If I do get downvoted here, I want each and every one of you to understand that women can indeed revoke their consent.

Please don't steal art. Especially to sell it. It's an insult to the original artist.
---
What‚Äôs the mend exploit?
---
Okay.
---
So, I‚Äôve been wanting Sidney as a survivor since I started playing. I really hope that she does get picked up by the Entity.
---
But, I‚Äôve heard some people want Randy as the survivor instead. He could be a likely choice too since he was killed, and his death scene does provide some funny dialogue for when he shows up in the entity‚Äôs realm.
---
&gt;Killer: Why are YOU even here, Randy, you‚Äôll never be the leading man...
---
&gt;Randy: Fuuuuck you!!
---
&gt;Killer: No matter how hard you try you‚Äôll never be the hero, and you‚Äôll never ever get the girl...
---
...and he wakes up in the Entity‚Äôs realm.
---
It would be a great. A horror movie expert inside of a survival horror game. 
---
I really want to be a Sidney Prescott main though :(

What is the Legion Mend bug? I know I has something to do with the blade add-ons but which ones an does it matter with how you pair them, and is it all of them?
---
No one has been very clear so as to that others won't just do it to but I need a basic understanding here lol
---
The Neverending Mending
---
I have several counter arguments to that, but in regards to DBD, this community is tiny enough that it really does make a huge difference if you're playing in a way that you know will make other people in the game not want to play anymore. Beyond that, it really does say a lot about you as a person with what brings you enjoyment. I'm not talking about wanting to play a video game where you can play a horror movie character and kill people, I mean if the only way you enjoy the video game is because you know someone else is getting upset.
---
first things first, the 2 killer thing is funny, please make it an extra game mode or at least put it in KYF
---
second, the legion mend timer exploit isn't funny and is actually terrible so yeah, that should be fixed asap
---
By using the two add-ons, Filthy Blade and Nasty Blades, these permanently increases the mending time each time a survivor gets hit, which could lead to up to 5+ minute on mending. Devs can now check people's match history to see if someone keeps abusing it in matches, someone who uses it once probably won't get ban but ppl who abuses it multiple matches are at the risk of getting banned
---
Hag is slow as hell anyways just loop her to death bro
---
When someone's 13 and just saw Fight Club for the first time
---
New player here, I see that you can unlock dlc killers by using in-game currency, but then do you just lose out on the extra content you would get by purchasing the full dlc? There's no way to obtain that content without paying for the dlc that you could already the killer for?
---
I am fine with being tunelled if its against my licensed nemesis, e.g. Quentin vs Freddy. It just feels right.
---
If you're planning to get the game for PC (idk much about console) read this:
---
Make sure you leave lobbies that have SWF (survival with friends). These guys have an unfair advantage with voice coms that the game does not warn you about, so you have to DC (disconnect) before the match starts to avoid the bullshit.
---
You can detect them by looking at how many join at the same time and using your own thinking to detect other patterns (same ping/names/language names etc.).
---
Welcome, and have fun my dude.
---
On-topic:
---
Camping gets you less points because as a killer you want to get as many HOOKS as possible not KILLS, as dumb as it sounds. You are not actually a killer, but a hooker. Hah! You should kill/camp/tunnel (tunnel = prioritize blatantly) the first player to get an advantage by making it a 3v1, and then play to hook as many as possible for more points to unlock more stuff and eventually rank up. Smacking them as much as possible is also good (my own term - smacking = hitting for the sake of hitting fast without intending to chase and down), but focus on hooking for now.
---
Must need perks: 
---
Hex: Ruin. the game is designed around you having it. use it on every killer. dont listen to plebbit.
---
BBQ and chilli: HUGE advantage whenever you hook, as it allows you to find your next target easily.
---
Monitor and Abuse: Gives you a big surprise momentum (makes it harder for claudettes to have time to blend into the background since you will be much closer when they stop working on the gen).
---
Source: Im a 70h player who peaked at rank 6 with killer without said perks above. lets see how well I do this rank reset. Cheers.
---
Oh and the reddit community is a little slow and cancerous, so please dont pay any heed to obviously stupid people who are only here to say "something" rather than effectively help you/make positive change.
---
i can type a more indepth explanation for how the point system works, and how you are supposed to think rather than logically deduce from the ingame descriptions. The devs made an amazing job, but they kind of dropped the ball when it came to understanding what people like in competitive video games - including the scoring/ranking system.
---
So using just one of the 2 you mentioned with anything else won't cause this issue? Its only the direct result of using both?
---
still gives you a period of warning to go "I should just move away from gen so that I can't get grab'd, just in case.
---
Even just one will permanently increase the timer
---
"You are not a beautiful 4K."
---
Oh, apparently mori-ing someone you slugged earlier next to a hook is ‚Äúcamping‚Äù now. üôÑ
---
Why don't we just ban Legion from appearing in the game until [the rework patch?](https://media1.tenor.com/images/beb5e5dad70db34225b07b574d874bd8/tenor.gif?itemid=7291034)
---
Ok got it, no green or purple blades, yellow is still chill?
---
Nice way of mentality to put it in. But lets say thay not everybody thinks that way too. Lets at least put a "safety pip" if the game recognizes that you were basically in a chase the whole game. That way everybody leaves home happy. In a sense.
---
Yeah it's just those two add-ons
---
Excellent, thank you so much for the clarity, sorry for so many questions.
---
The nevermending
---
Looks like we won't be seeing any more 2 killer+ posts, shame, they were fun
---
2-8 with 10 gens and a bigger map would be the shit
---
I did when I first started playing. I watched a lot of youtubers (Tru3Ta1ent, ZubatLeL, etc) that were really damn good at killer and learned from them. Once you get a solid understanding of how to be effective, that nervousness goes away. If that doesn't help, play survivor and figure out what other survivors tend to do. This could also help with feeling more comfortable.
---
np, glad to help!
---
Then take my upvote sir! :)
---
There is no thing as a "fair game" in my opinion. It's a killers goal to kill all survivors at any cost and vice versa for survivors, as long as it's in the game it's fair play.
---
Repeat offenders, as in multiple times a day. Once a week wouldn't effect it, because yeah life happens and you get dced without being toxic. (Also sorry that happens to you)
---
Same here! I really want to play killer more but I just get so nervous and always do really bad.
---
If I'm unhooking you under terror radius without BT, be prepared to run cuz Im going down for you mate!
---
Here's a thought gain some mental fortitude and dont fucking rage quit.
---
r/wooosh?
---
Yeah, it's a pity people are abusing this now once people figured out how to do it
---
It would be going against the Working with the Killer's rule. Since it can only be done with 2 friends. Meaning one friend will join as a survivor while the other survivor joins the game as another Killer
---
I'm down to help with this, so long as OP is on PS4
---
&gt;There is no need to report the 2+ killers in a match exploit. We have access to data that will allow us to find the players abusing the exploit.
---
I don't know how to do the exploit, nor have I ever witnessed it in game, but I've seen people say that it's not hard to *accidentally* do. 
---
**If that's true**, will people who accidentally abuse this bug gets bans too? Or is this data that they have access to thorough enough to determine if the bug was accessed intentionally or unintentionally?
---
Why not just disable the Legion add-ons? What if someone doesn't know about the exploit but uses the add-ons because he thinks they are good?
---
Who knows
---
&gt;practice fast vaulting
---
???
---
Depends on what you're woooshing.
---
[REDACTED]
---
Is that even true though? It takes twice as long for you, but it only takes up one person's time instead of two, so it evens out to be the same amount of time. Plus it's more efficient to be on separate gens, and often after healing each other people end up working on the same gen.
---
Yeah idk bro
---
They will most likely be looking at the matches for suspicious players, especially for people who have done it more than once or multiple times. This very rarely happens, In my times of playing DBD over 2k+ hours, It never occurred
---
I‚Äôd switch it for Ruin personally
---
That still doesn't explain why I deranked, and more importantly, why a bunch of trolls are editing the wiki.
---
Tangentially related, why is it that mechanics like gen tapping are considered okay by the community but moonwalking isn't? Both abuse game mechanics to circumvent safeguards put into place. The difference is that moonwalking isn't easily done by not good players because it's a quick way to lose your survivor if you don't know what you're doing, but gen tapping takes no skill. Survivors will talk about how gen tapping can be 30% slower, but this statistic ignores the wide variance that can happen and also that avoiding skill checks means avoiding a way that potentially allows the killer to know where a survivor is.
---
I'm not sure man. The way I see it is I can run longer if i takes me two hits instead of one and it's even more optimal to avoid being hooked that takes two people and a normal heal takes two people so i can't see where i self heal will add up to less things getting done.
---
Repost tho
---
It was a good attempt, then.

I‚Äôd love clementine but I feel like she‚Äôs too small to ever fit :/ maybe Lee
---
Wasn't the Legion bug introduced when Ash came out? Maybe it came with the Plague, but I'm fairly certain it was discovered post-Ash, and Ash came out on April 2nd, so it's been just about 2 weeks.
---
YES! FINALLY THEY BANNING PEOPLE WHO ABUSE THE LEGION EXPLOIT
---
Fix bug = üò¥ I sleep.      
---
Ban your players = üëç real shit
---
Exactly, you couldn‚Äôt go after anyone else, they were all dead
---
It's a FromSoft game, so it's probably incredibly brutal. Source: 1000 hours on each Dark Souls game at minimum.
---
The thing a lot of people don't realize though, is that taking difficulty out of games like Sekiro is like taking horror out of movies like Halloween. I mean, if you want to fast forward past those parts more power to you, but don't start complaining to the director to make the movie less scary....
---
God is real
---
It would be a frame rate nightmare but if Legion looked like this always, with the double stuttering effect but the double was always a different Legion character it would potentially look fucking awesome.
---
Each time you stab the Legion your playing as switches to the next.
---
I know it makes no difference in the game but the asthetic sounds so good in my mind
---
Honestly people like this annoy the ever living fuck out of me. ‚ÄúOh I‚Äôve been hooked? Yes, I can use this to my advantage, the killer isn‚Äôt allowed to hook me again until he‚Äôs hooked everyone else just as many times or more than me, I‚Äôll run directly into the killer to body block him the whole time since he isn‚Äôt allowed to fight ba‚Äî WHAT THE FUCK FUCKING TUNNELER!‚Äù
---
Ruin is bad, just play nurse already
---
What's the update?!
---
Has anyone tried Doc with corrupt intervention? 
---
I have it unlocked but I cant seem to get it on doctor and I feel like itd be amazing.
---
Its very, very hard to accidentally do. There is a lot behind it
---
And like only twice in a match, no thanks
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had a mainly bad experience with the game! It‚Äôs a shame how many people just hate others in this game for no good reason.
---
It‚Äôs great to hear the opinions of someone with such a new perspective bring them up, I agree that perk-reliance has been rather troublesome, but I‚Äôve figure that the more one plays, the less you‚Äôll need the perks, no matter the meta, but I‚Äôm not everyone, and I can completely understand the difficulty remembering what perks do what, I still can‚Äôt tell you what half the perks the killers have do, and I play killer a whole lot!
---
I hope you have a better time with other games, and that if you get back into Dead by daylight, I sincerely hope that you get only the best experiences!
---
It‚Äôs when the legion puts the double blade as there add ons, with every Ferrell hit it makes the mend time longer and longer!
---
Assuming the survivor is already standing on the hatch like this, what would you have done differently as freddy?
---
If you down then, you still have to wipe the blade (or do the freddy flick or whatever he does)
---
One time some guy got super lucky and managed to jump off the hook, I said fuck it and let him have the gate while I was looking for another surv... a few second later I get a notification my totem is being tampered it, I go check and the fucker who just jumped off the hook is right there. I down and hook him again and he messages me saying ‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK DUDE! Respect the 4%!‚Äù
---
I see that lol. Shame i guess
---
They can't fix it until they know the cause, which they don't. These are game breaking and thetvwonr stand for people abusing them, what's wrong with that?
---
No actually that's not it at all... oh and shame on you for defending scummy players... I hope you step on a lego...
---
Finally you trashy legions who abused this for the last month will get banned for exploiting this!
---
Their pain is my pleasure.
---
Depip square-pricing that the best killer is Freddy... (._. )
---
Because gen tapping is still a huge disadvantage, and still accomplishes what the perk sets out to accomplish and is worth running.
---
Oh man I love being Santa for my teammates and finding keys with Plunderer.
---
did the 2 killers glitch for fun once, let everyone go, shame if i get banned for it smh
---
I think playing killer can be a bit of a grind/draining. But, I noticed something different in the game, over the weekend. When I had the third person on the hook and one left alive, the person not on the hook turned red and became visible. That made being killer, during end game, a bit more fun.
---
My stuff is usually at 1 upvote at default but my comment is at zero. Did someone really downvote me guessing at a new game mode? What in the ever loving salt is that shit
---
No terror radius myers + noed UwU
---
They could test their game and withhold broken content until they figure it out.
---
On console most survivor mains are like this. So the first time my friend came over to check the game out he was watching me play and anytime I hooked someone twice in a short amount of time, or I turn around to see the entire team right next to person I hooked and I don‚Äôt let them save I would say ‚Äúwait for it‚Äù and 95% of the time I‚Äôd get some toxic ass message. One time I was getting bashed on by a rank 11 cuz he crushed me the first day I got the game, I literally sent him a screenshot of the game that finished downloading 4 hours ago and he acts like I made the picture up and proceeds to call me a trash camper. Btw, this guy called me a camper because every time he went for a save I was right behind him... I was playing hag
---
Idk? I don‚Äôt see the problem. If it existed, just don‚Äôt play it?
---
Claudette is not represented right at all. You can see her
---
Ace mains uniteeee
---
The only reasonable response to NOED
---
I play on Xbox, I agree with you completely, I just said some so it didn‚Äôt seem like I was generalising, I rarely go 3 games as killer without a message of some kind lol
---
Exactly. It's just weird someone is so angry at the idea of something new that just openly thinking about a new mode makes them downvote a comment.
---
That's honestly worse than the entitlement level that claudette SWF mains have when complaining about NOED
---
Not sure why people would still want to use self care when you can heal each other much faster anyway. The game is meant to be about team play and in my opinion, self-care is just a way to only rely on yourself and in a way, promotes ignoring other people.  
---
It is just my opinion but I think self-care is a waste of a perk slot, especially when you spend time looping killers like Legion, The Plague, Leatherface or Billy (and arguably Mike). Use Aftercare, Bond, Empathy ; find your team mates and get healed if you want to be. Most of the time when I solo queue, I don't bother getting healed up.
---
Pure aesthetics honestly. I've always enjoyed Scream and fun slasher movies and leather jackets. Legion just *looks* great and I enjoy it. Can still be fun without exploit (I've never even tried using the exploit), granted you actually get a chance at the game without DCs or obnoxious t-bagging with every survivor. 
---
There's plenty of lists online and on Steam forums for builds, but I personally just use Discordance, Spies in the Shadows, Sloppy Butcher, and Bloodhound. The first two to find/keep track of survivors on the match, the second two to try to down folks without using their power much since I personally dislike it.
---
I‚Äôve been saying the same thing for awhile now, I don‚Äôt know why BhVR is so slow at responding to things and also not just blocking things. Look how long the sloppy butcher glitch with wraith took to fix. Just disable the perk, add on or person in general until you can patch it. Most games now days do this.
---
I don't think I was able to complete it. Once I got picked up it functioned as it usually does so I assume it would have
---
Wait that‚Äôs real
---
If the 19 sold is true this guy is fucking cunt
---
Exactly!!
---
i get all the other stuff, but what's wrong with trying to be immersed? i'm not the best at chases (i can buy time for my team but i'm not a god), so i usually try to be sneaky so i can accomplish objectives without being caught. isn't that the point of the game?
---
I was first hooked bc the bubba was trying to give a stinkdette his totem then I slid up and tried to get it while he was juggling and took offense.
---
Heard bad things about her. 
---
But why are you going into her stream mid match? If I was a streamer, I wouldn‚Äôt be happy. I‚Äôd think I was getting stream sniped. 
---
Focus on yourself.
---
I mean that's what you think bud, but we all love him and I started playing dbd because of him, Cocky or not it's him, he's playing it real instead of some twat posting edited over used clips of the game ya know?
---
This is awesome, props to you.
---
Only went in after I got her and she was already having a tantrum over it
---
Good.
---
I say this as a survivor main, but ruin should be the base way gens work. When killer doesn't have ruin, I see 0ks and 1ks because me or my team just blows through gens in no time. The game isnt balanced right because as a killer if you're chasing someone all game, you will lose, like guaranteed. The person you chased has caused you to lose. Yet theres 4 people. 3 people who may or may not suck, had an easy game doing gens and escaping. 1 survivor can keep the killer busy which is a problem when theres 4 people to have to deal with. Gens should take way longer because a good survivor can loop a killer for quite a while. I recall seeing stats showing that at rank 1, killers averages are like 1.5k or less? depending on the killer. Which is because rank 1 survivors are the one calling the shots, running the loops, and deciding the pace of the game. Add in SWF and you can see the problem
---
it appeared with the Plague chapter release. Though arguably it didn't become THAT well known until a few weeks later around when Ash was released.
---
Can't wait for Kylo to mori Rey when she teabags at the resistance base entrance, but she doesn't know he has No One Escapes Sequels.
---
As a Meg with bad reflexes... yeah, sounds about right. (I'm getting better though, I swear!)
---
I would know I lost and just hit him for extra points instead of getting none in my opinion

For the first few months I always had a small amount of anxiety that dwindled the more I played. Now I feel nothing, just a cold hard dead shell of my former self. Bring on the 100th SWF group, my mediocre console Nurse is ready.
---
That round was... insane to say the least
---
I started playing Legion because (like the person who commented first) I really enjoy slasher movies, leather jackets, and Slenderverse types of masks and characters (Google Marble Hornets Masky if you don't know what I mean!)
---
I'm not gonna say that my build is good, because I don't think there's any such thing as a good or bad killer build. We're all different and have different play styles. I use Iron Maiden, Iron Grasp, Sloppy Butcher and Discordance. I main Legion as my killer even though I'm pretty much a hardcore survivor main, I enjoy chase killers which is something I feel like Legion excels at. I charge in following Discordance, tag everyone in my radius and let the game begin. Its like a much more lethal and scarier version of tag, you're it! 
---
I can see how Legion could be super annoying in the wrong hands, but speaking from a personal experience, I don't tunnel people, I don't camp, and I don't use exploits. I chase people around and scare them for most of the match, and if I'm lucky I get maybe 1 or 2 kills. Feral Frenzy forces survivors to stay on their toes and to keep running. Most of the matches I play as Legion or play against Legion are super tense and heart pounding, fast paced, which is something I wish there was more of in this game. Not much scares me, but seeing a masked hooligan charge at mach speed out of the fog in my direction actually makes my heart pound, whereas if I see a Trapper or what have you, its honestly kind of boring. I think that Legion adds chaos and unpredictability into the game and really forces people to run and give it their best, rather than just dicking off. That is, if anyone will even stay around to play with us!
---
We've all had that spiritual moment where a teammate gives up just a second from us saving them and we can only sit there and stare in confusion for a couple minutes
---
You should feel proud, not angry.
---
yeah i know but i just think its stupid to say something is for mature audiences when its for a mature videogame
---
Not even angry, just annoyed that I'm getting spammed by like 15 different people
---
As someone who tries very hard not to tunnel, people like this make it hard lmao. If you run into me str8 from the hook what am I supposed to do? Would the survivor give me the free kill if I made a mistake during the chase? When I see that I'll start letting survivors get free saves.
---
Is the counter to spirit fury to never drop pallets? Asking for a friend.
---
First of all, didn't snipe. Second of all, you call a toddler like tantrum commentary?
---
Says the guy who rage quits games.
---
Mhm, but you LITERALLY JUST STATED you didn't go in her stream during the game. You LITERALLY JUST STATED you did it after the game. So you're lying.
---
I had to unequip the fourth slot to get it.
---
Hayato.
---
I typically run Lithe, Self Care, Alert, and Urban Evasion. I like to use Diversion sometimes too just in case a killer gets too close to me. I used to use Technician, but I feel like it needs a buff. The reduced 8 meter generator sound is really nice, but it sadly doesn't apply when you're on a generator with someone else who isn't running it, or so I've heard
---
Also, she has great outfits
---
how?deranking?quitting matches?i dont think thats fair for the survivors im facing
---
I bought the shirt
---
Look at the post einstein, I got the down, THEN decided to open up the stream to see if I scared her. Maybe read before you respond?
---
I don't know why people hate legion is a good starting killer
---
Then your teammates orchestrate a borrowed time, bodyblocking save to rescue you. Best feelings ever.
---
Can we please atleast remove the woosh sound when pig goes into ambush or make it like pig should have no red stain or terror for like 5 seconds when she stands up
---
Ffs make her viable in good ranks
---
The satisfaction gained from a salty Twitch Streamer is really something to behold. I'll let you in on a little secret- if I see a Twitch Streamer, it is my *mission* to make them disconnect. I *love* their insults and comment spams. It is *really* cathartic and satiating to live in someone's head for hours, as you have, and make them whine.

I know I sound like a Horror movie character, but it's true. I'd really enjoy myself if I succeeded in drawing genuine anger and insult spam from a streamer. The bigger, the better.
---
Just the way the game is right now unfortunately
---
Haha depends on my mood. Sometimes im like ooooooh god, Just kill me please, I dont care. Sometimes its a shittier baby killer who destroyed the randies on my team and I refuse to lose to him. Combine that with a pissy mood, and I will literally spend an hour sneaking or camping the hatch with the killer. Out lasting his patience, and making him just as stuck with me.
---
Not my intention from all of this, seeing as I didnt expect her to pop up in my lobby, but it is enjoyable to watch her rant ngl
---
If this is, in fact, true- link the VOD and time. And how do you know it was OP in chat? I'm not necessarily dismissing you, I'd just like to see evidence. Perhaps you're right.
---
Trapper masks. Currently the only ones I see are custom and cost hundreds.
---
Im in the middle of watching her stream rn (I only  subbed a few days ago and just joined in about 20 ago)
---
I dont  know how I really feel yet, on one hand I think she has a fair point about not getting too worked up over a rank 17 casual game, but then again the way she went off on you over a 15 minute rant  and her being literally that tilted was kinda setting off some alarms with how toxic she was being (she did the same thing a few streams ago) 
---
Id really know, im trying playing devils advocate here , but everything she was saying was making it really hard to and just felt like the same old salty survivor rants we've all gotten :/
---
As a respectful survivor main we need more honorable opponents like you.
---
I once ran a trapper around for the last 3 gens, he was totally focused on me so I figure he was going to be superFaceCamperExtra
---
After he downed me and my teammates left he carried me the hatch and in post game chat, he goes ‚Äúyou deserve the respect your teammates didn‚Äôt give you. Well fought.‚Äù
---
I have never been able to repeat that feeling
---
This is stolen
---
I specifically said toxic, and I meant it more for survivors than killers, but go off I guess. Personally I wouldn't exploit it.
---
And I FUCKING QUOTE YOU IN YOUR OWN COMMENT:
---
SunDadSolaireBloody Pig 21 minutes ago 
---
So get your fucking story straight.
---
why the fuck do you even care lmfao get over yourself. if she wants to be toxic and talk shit then let her. making a reddit post and complaining isn‚Äôt gonna do ANYTHING.
---
That's all it is, she tries to bully new killers and it backfired to the point where to cover her own ass she accuses me of sniping her
---
You have to double pip now in order to get any adept killer achievements
---
No ones gonna talk about how this is the lead actress in the Scream special Netflix owns? Lol
---
Hard move on the ego my dude. You're right in every way. But for freddy to acknowledge hes the only killer in the game that can get screwed out of the stand off and to accept the hatch is yours and just hit you, is a hard pill to swallow. Then again I hate freddy as a killer, and against him as a survivor(that goddam shit tier annoying lullaby) so fuck freddy regardless
---
I've never heard of this, I'm a PS4 player though.
---
Thank you for the advice either way.
---
After I got her not after the game. READ
---
Plague doesnt tilt me, P3 bubba's and legion does
---
Then don't respond :D
---
The devs are working on something they call the ‚Äúendgame collapse.‚Äù We don‚Äôt have any real details on it yet (to my knowledge) but it should probably  make the endgame more interesting and exciting, and will hopefully prevent situations like this.
---
wtf is the person in that gif
---
New killer concept confirmed
---
Intentionally using/abusing exploits is expressly forbidden in the ToS, so yeah he broke the rules. I don't really see why that's hard to understand. Basically every multiplayer game ever will ban people for the same exact thing.
---
yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please yes please
---
Winning with NOED be like
---
Sandbagging the other killer is a fun idea.
---
All the love for my dude ace in this subreddit makes me so happy
---
3 in a row
---
this subreddits' memes are becoming self aware...
---
Show me the üí∞ beeeeitch
---
I was in chat, AFTER I hooked her and went to see her reaction, right of her going on her mori rant I said IN CHAT "I don't have a mori hon"
---
It‚Äôs the double blade add ons, BhVR put out a statement that you can report this now and that they will be banning people for it and also that 2 killer glitch.
---
I always found that to be the most faulty argument on this reddit. That splitting gens is better. Ill argue it till im blue because theres a HUGE difference between getting the gen to 80% on your own as the killer comes around to disrupt you/chase you endlessly, and knocking a gen out with 1 other guy before he made it to the gen, and getting away and hiding/moving before he even got there. 45 seconds is way way faster than 80 seconds. those 30-35 extra seconds? who knows what could happen. Yea in a vacuum, splitting gens is the fastest way to get 5 done. In practice, 3 manning gen to gen, under the killers nose will always be better. Secondly the game gives you mad co op points or working on gens together. BP wise and tick marks toward objective for rank
---
Hmm only tantrum I see is you, talking shit on reddit, trying to get people to either talk shit about her or make you feel better about getting drug in her chat. I'm not sure..
---
*you‚Äôre
---
Whatever, not the fucking point. Why stay in her stream for HOURS after that only to try to pick a fight?
---
Also she's not a Fog Whisperer, so you got that wrong. And you typed BEFORE you got into the match saying not to bully you. So that's not stream sniping?
---
You're probably going to say 'I closed the stream after I posted that.' No proof my dude, so the natural assumption is yes, you stream sniped her.
---
Crazy isn't it? Lol
---
Lol would be fun to be able to stun the killer every 15 sec by just pressing arrow buttons.
---
survivors arent a team and no one is required to save you
---
and they can and will escape without you
---
Hell yeah; hope OP replies to the comments so we know lol
---
Hey! First rule of fight club is we don‚Äôt talk about fight club!
---
Damn, it didn‚Äôt let me post and I forgot about it later. Came across it again. So it‚Äôs a little late but whatever. I‚Äôm a Claudette main so I know how to be toxic, and body blocking is toxic. You deserved to get tunneled.
---
How exactly is she bullying new killers? Is being good at the game considering bullying now?
---
That's exactly what I'm trying to disprove but whatever, put that in chat in the lobby then came back after I downed her
---
This could also help nurses learn how to control their blinks i‚Äôm upvoting this!!!
---
I run self care so i say this as a devils advocate but the problem starts to compound when you have sloppy butcher. Add in some other stuff like idk, madness level 3? shrug, and you spend 15-20 seconds for madness, and like almost 40 seconds for the self heal. Thats almost an entire gen done. I know you cant work on gens at Madness 3 but im just creating an extreme scenario. I understand both sides of the argument. Depends on the situation for me. If its hillbilly or a 1 shot killer, or legion or plague. Ill just do gens, even wounded.
---
No but purposely deranking with a full multi Thousand hour squad is
---
Well then I recant my upvote
---
A pox on thee OP!
---
Is this real?
---
Pig is best stealth killer. Don't dis.
---
oh well I see you were in my last game
---
To be fair she does derank daily to avoid competition, or whatever excuse they're using these daya
---
I see. For future reference, I think it's for the best that you say nothing. The streamer will get angrier if they don't have anyone to direct their rage at. 
---
Then again, it isn't your *goal* to make people clench their fists with rage, as it is mine- you seem far more *fun,* and *nice.* So really, to each their own.
---
Yep exactly! Giving up on chases isn't a bad thing, if anything it's smart. If I see survivors going to op loops I'll try get a hit but if I don't I'll just leave them be for now. 100% it becomes a skill to identify when to drop a chase, so many people on this forum misinterpret what makes a good killer, I really can't understand how decent players manage to chase a survivor for 5 gens. Assuming they have no toolboxes, gen perks or are double teaming gens, that would mean you're wasting 5+minutes on a chase. If you can't make progress within 1 minute (i'd say 30 seconds), just drop the chase and move on to patrolling gens.
---
Ok thanks
---
I used double blades a few days ago in a farming match. 
---
Am I safe?
---
Couldn‚Äôt have been me I‚Äôd ddos him to oblivion done it a few times now
---
I‚Äôve been wanting this for the longest time!!! OMG!!! Sidney better be the survivor!!!
---
Rank 5-10 and zero perks, ahh the dark times
---
You're the guy that stands on the hatch and let's me die on my first hook after doing 5 gens alone.. I hate you.. üòÇ
---
Just leave the game and reload until you don‚Äôt get a SWF that‚Äôs what I do
---
Yeah that all makes sense. One shots healing doesn't matter unless you want to activate MoM in the Hope's that they injure you first. Besides that in certain situations it's a waste of time but I don't intend to waste time with it. I may heal quick then hop back on a gen and typically I always get 2 or 3 gens done alone.
---
Ya you got a point I just never care bout hatch stand-offs as killer as it‚Äôs not worth it plus I never camp the hatch so I usually find them before they can find it or they jump in when I‚Äôm not there
---
Or you're a killer and you're trying to divide and conquer.. Either way.. You suck. üòÇ
---
So they are adding Negan to the game finally?
---
I also need help with comment karma how do I increase it
---
Lol wow you're upset. Imagine caping for some e-thot this hard.
---
Fyi she won't fuck you for this captain save-a-hoe
---
i actually killed his team after him, but his teammates had already been on either second hook or death hook.
---
Sounds like you're a person with too much anger over a video game.
---
Have to hard disagree here. I would say that Clown is among the worst killers in DBD right now, for heaps of reasons. Unlike all the other killers, Clown only is 'good' at one thing, the chase. Other killers have powers that help them in multiple aspects, for example the Pig has stealth with her crouch, some chase potential with her ambush and stall with her traps. Billy has map pressure, mobility, and chase potential with his insta down and the mindgames he can do with it. Clown... just has chase. Thats it.
---
Clowns power is super easy to counter as well. When at a loop against the Clown, you just have to see how long the loop is. If its a short loop, you can just run it as normal, the bottle wont help the Clown catch up in time if you play it right. On long loops, just camp the pallet, force him to break and, and run to the next loop. You could argue that this technique will waste pallets, but with how many pallets are on the map and how little gen times are, by the time you have wasted all the pallets the gens are done and Adrenaline is popped PLUS once the clown uses his 4 bottles you can loop him normally.
---
So yeah I think Clown is trash. Some people I know put him at bottom, but I think LF edges him out in shitness.
---
im i suck because i dont want to risk my own ass saving you from your own mistakes?
---
Make it extra bloodpoints to DC before legion delivers a frenzy stab!
---
Well now you suck because you don't understand humor.. But yes, that other thing, too..
---
Freddy is mid tier
---
Clown is trash
---
Those are my main two lmao
---
Update: the fact that shes live reading this thread  for wrongthink at this point is really making it hard to defend her, I was trying but if your serously still salty over a 5 hour game and complaing to 300 viewers whats the point?
---
I run Bond + Kindred + Open Handed and Plunderers. I dont even use items. I just hoard and leave them in the chests sometimes. Maybe someone can make use of it
---
Don't take anyone with that kind of pic seriously
---
They had me in the first half not gonna lie
---
Fear. Straight fear. I've brought enough new survivors into the game to know. They are literally terrified of getting  caught, or taking risks. If you're on a hook 80 meters away. Thats 80 meters of terrain they have to traverse to not get caught(cuz god forbid they get caught). To top it off, theyve had it done to them. Being left on the hook becomes the norm. No one saves anyone. Which further compounds the fact of DONT GET CAUGHT because they only ever get 1 chase before they get left on hook. It becomes a circle jerk of afraid survivors who never rescue each other. You have to climb out of these ranks by doing gens, and looping the killer, getting saves, and just showing you're better than your rank by a large margin till things get better. Also running kindred in solo is a god send for convincing people its safe to get you. These guys last 5-10 seconds in a chase. Don't know how to loop. Rank 15-20 is like brand new players. Near rank 10 people get a little better. Rank 5 is like ok, survivors start to actually show competency at the game consistently.
---
"Oh hey! Lets start banning people for a problem WE created!" 
---
There's going to be people who use Nasty/Filthy and get banned without knowing why. Literally could just disable one of the blades until they're fixed.
---
And since it's now a bandwagon to hate Legion, Survivors are now just going to report every Legion they face.
---
sorry, it's just that when i try to make a joke i tend to not start out with "i hate you" and finish up with "you suck"
---
&gt; Me playing 3 gens strat trapper around basement;
---
&gt; Getting called camper all night;
---
&gt; Sigh
---
Agree for sure. Always felt weak to me and never worth using. A better version would be if survivors can't remove the RBT until it's activated
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/411643398
---
At 1:41:51 he says "pls don't bully me" during the loading screen before the game started
---
lmao, you right.
---
I feel like this is a really bad way to go about the mending exploit. Just stop the addons from being used until it's fixed, no harm no foul, because it's EXTREMELY easy to do by accident, and people shouldn't get banned for playing a couple games with it without knowing.
---
Not salty, just annoyed that she thinks shes soooooo better than everyone else and that she thinks people would actually care to snipe her
---
i feel your pain.
---
Lol I got it yearsterdy it was hilarious
---
The art style really reminds me of Darkest Dungeon
---
This would be the best reason to have Head On
---
Yeah no i wasnt talking about you, I meant that shes salty enough to continue reading the thread on stream, but true :P
---
Oh yea prepare for the twitch e-thot white knights to get your post taken down
---
You are completely full of shit. You typed ‚Äúpls don‚Äôt bully me‚Äù in her chat BEFORE the trial began. Then typed mid match about not having a mori. You were obviously stream sniping the whole time, she ran you around for over 2 minutes. Then when she went in the basement, you spent at least another minute hiding near the stairs waiting for her to come up. She was the only person you had any interest in going after. Stream sniping is for losers.
---
Btw, you are terrible at killer.
---
Yep, had an encounter with this dude, called me a cunt and a camper and tunneler because i found him 15 seconds after unhook moaning behind a bush healing. Hes a dickhead
---
His name is not bubba man r/peoplearestupid
---
Ah lmao she would do that honestly
---
I'm anger prone in general. Give me an objective in a stressful environment and I'll get angry for sure. Video games have an objective. You win or you lose. If you dont get worked up over losing then you sound like a beta to me. But hey, to each their own ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
And that‚Äôs a real sub
---
Don't give in to toxic behavior like that. I know it's frustrating but I wouldn't advocate for purposeful deranking and quitting matches.
---
Ew grow up...
---
Both of those were the pretty much my final points, on both occasions. And the me hating you was in comparison to my past experiences with my teammates (or.. Co-workers, I guess) letting me die.. Chill out, man. I was just busting your balls.
---
Imagine actually thinking I'm out there looking to sleep with females. Imagine me being a female who's married for 10 years happily so. Imagine being an idiot.
---
I don‚Äôt even mind LF if he doesn‚Äôt face camp. Legion is the only killer that I know will be completely unfun no matter how he plays.
---
yes
---
I want kate to bring a guitar out like engie in tf2 with frontier justice.
---
I heard a rumor that dataminers found stuff for a sequel with multiple escapes and all sorts of new or changed stuff around the time they announced that they'd finally be doing dedicated servers. It said there would be things like a helicopter that Survivors had to choose when it leaves, meaning either leave some behind or risk the Killer pulling on the ladder and crashing it, planks as an item (items now having multiple equip slots and being found only in the Trial, so you can carry like 3 things at once) instead of pallets to board up pathways (including an exit that is always available but only for one person once certain things are completed, meaning you can stop cowards from bailing out and saving themselves while leaving you to die), and even some sort of weapon that Survivors can use on each other with some sort of health bar system so they can kill teammates for their items and to mix things up. It sounded really cool, albeit very different from the DBD I know and love. I haven't seen anything else on it so I'm not sure how valid the information is.
---
They‚Äôve pretty much confirmed Ghostface at this point and Legion is a piss poor representation of the character.
---
Good the legion glitch is banable it deserved it honestly
---
Omegalul!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£.. fucking tell him what's up!!  Salty ass killer.. haha
---
This guy gets it.. üòÇ
---
I dont main killer for that reason. Ill get mad tunnel vision. The game fades away, and it becomes about me and this dickwad im now stuck chasing who got my attention on purpose and thinks he can make a fool out of me. Joke is those guys ARE good at looping, and you will get looped, and taking the bait was a mistake, and blah blah blah....
---
If that happened I wouldn‚Äôt play until the Legion changes
---
Putting on 2 add ons isn't hard.
---
And not a god damn word about the incessant DCs, intentional and otherwise.
---
Weak as fuck.
---
Can we get some kind of ban system in place for people who are dc‚Äôing from matches?  Lately I feel like I‚Äôm reporting st least one or two people a match for just bouncing when they get downed first. It‚Äôs getting to the point where I don‚Äôt even enjoy playing. If it‚Äôs not a person dropping during the game starting it‚Äôs someone leaving.
---
I mean i don‚Äôt think survivors should be entitled to a hatch escape. But considering i already killed three i personally wouldn‚Äôt mind if the last should happen to escape... unless they are completely toxic and don‚Äôt deserve it
---
I guess in a way I can understand why they will ban for it now cause I‚Äôm sure some abuse it and other ppl just wanna play a normal game does suck though
---
I'm not against having more bloody clothes. I was kinda let down when I prestiged the first time and found out it was only the base clothes. If would just suck to be able to straight out buy it if you haven't at least earned one first.
---
I mean, having the ability to not get mad at losing a video game sounds more like having the emotional control of an adult rather than a hormonal teenager. But to each their own ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
They're low level for a reason, just haven't figured out how to play well
---
Just don‚Äôt do it anymore and you should be fine
---
Ya, thought it was pretty hilarious with 2 piggies crouching around but mcote says otherwise
---
Report his comment :/
---
End game Collapse, a rework on how the hatch and the end of the game works, there's video coming this week about it, and it'll be in next mid chapter, don't know anything more.
---
That's not going to teach them a lesson though. Campers don't share empathy so they deserve to have it done to him.
---
I honestly feel like the survivor would be Gale or Officer Dewey.
---
Most definetly. Torbert can be kind of a weird guy though, so as much as I'm dying to have a Scream chapter, I wouldn't get my hopes up too high based off this. 
---
It is a good sign though. As far as I can tell, Behavior is willing to put any big name in the game they can, and they'd most likely need his permission to do it.
---
I recently became full killer main, maybe I'll see you sometime &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs gonna be funny seeing the Legion mains pretend to be innocent. This is gonna be fun to watch.
---
I‚Äôm a offended and I feel Claudette main
---
Dude hop off her tits...  get a hobby..
---
I‚Äôd say replace either iron maiden or haunted grounds with ruin or monitor and abuse to get the most out of it.
---
Hop off my dick and get a hobby
---
Oh wow, I would have flame him lmao
---
My friend I do, and God knows how bullied I get on my rank 14 games
---
I always do a breathing training before starting a game as killer. Like you, I get so nervous thinking I will play badly (which I do) I feel like not playing at all. Once I get courage to start, I play about 5 games, and all of them I get destroyed by SWF groups or just a surv that I just can't touch as he runs me for 3 - 4 gens. 
---
I removed the end game chat quite some time to escape the toxic words but I get triggered anyway as I just got outplayed and I stop playing for some time.
---
It is a cycle, once calm again I try once more thinking it gonna be better, "this time, I gonna get at least a few hooks". The result end in the same way, I tilt and come back later. Hence and repeat.
---
Once, I was playing a match and the gates were opened, a surv were there just waiting for me and as I approached him, he 360 me and went back to the map so I could chase him, needless to say I never catch up since he knew where all the perfect windows were and pallets locations, after he was done with me, he left through the same gate 
---
It's just amazing how survs can make you play their game and you can do nothing about it.
---
I enjoy but also hate playing as killer, it is just so stressfull sometimes.
---
Forgive my unburden, I never talked to anyone about it. :)
---
There are some on amazon...they aren't licensed though...
---
Let me guess: The Killer used BBQ
---
Seriously though, it's fucking absurd how many times people come to me for shit or I notice something, and all I'm really left with is "Fuck it, let's see where this takes me." I'd say it's coincidence I always have a drink with me when that happens, but I don't know how much we can constitute as coincidence that I just drink a lot. Not like, alcohol or anything, just drinks in general.
---
When will Freddy be reworked? You seem to have answers the Devs aren't giving so thought I might as well ask you. :).
---
Unless you're talking out of your ass and assuming something completely reasonable on the part of the devs.
---
Gale is basically the final girl of the Scream series alongside with Sidney. I'd be down if we got her instead, but would prefer Sidney.
---
Gale is at least useful. Dewey is likable, but name one damn thing he did worthwhile in the entire 4 movies. He gets credit for figuring out the killer in 4, but lol, nah, that was Gale...
---
In her damn hospital bed even.
---
I remember reading somewhere that gen tapping is roughly equal to just working through the gen and missing 6 checks (not blowing the gen but missing 6 hex checks). 
---
Solo I just work on the gen even if I miss the great skill checks. Very rarely would I ever get 6 skill checks in those two minutes.
---
However if I am working on a gen with some one else, I will switch to tapping if there are three missed checks. With basically 2+ people on a gen, it is super easy to get that 6 checks and just would have been done faster if some one gen tapped.
---
Let me guess: You think it's okay to let the Killer use wallhacks when Survivors aren't even allowed to use guns.
---
Cell outfits are 1080, maybe that's the number you were looking at
---
The spirit just has some hidden buff that makes a skill check pop up as soon as I leave a gen whenever she‚Äôs around. Source:blown up countless gens doing this
---
Although it would definitely be fun to work together on one Survivor, I think that would mostly just lead to fighting over who gets to hook/Mori them once they're downed (at least within my friend group lol). Personally I think to help prevent that they could implement something kind of like Bloodlust where if two Killers chase the same Survivor for long enough, the Survivor gets like a speed burst or other boon while the Killers get a detriment, like a temporary decrease in speed, or even losing Bloodpoints. I would definitely reconsider chasing the same Survivor as my mate if it means I got reduced BPs at the end of the game.
---
Hatch is a pretty stupid mechanic. No reason to make a fuss over it.  
---
I typically don't care if anyone escapes through the hatch.
---
Officer Doofy would be better.
---
For me it's when I see a cute girl at a bar or club lol.
---
If I don't have the courage to approach, I usually say "Fuck it, what's the worst that can happen", take a chug or drink, and approach.
---
Dewey is lowkey just dwight tho
---
Yup. I feel ya.
---
No, survivors just DC against anything that can down them.
---
Guess I am talking out my ass lol. I mean it only makes sense since now they are deeming it banable that they will start to be on the look out now.
---
I'm confused. I ended up getting put in a 2 killer game last night (I was freddy and there was also a trapper) but I didn't do anything. Idk how it happened, if it happens again can I get banned?
---
*it just really aint that deep chief*
---
Fuck that bitch and any other bitch  like her. (:
---
They should wait until there isn‚Äôt an infinite loading screen every other game that makes it a 3 man game to ban people for dcing.
---
Yea, they added hillbilly for people to not ask for Leatherface?
---
Go against their morals, i love it!
---
Like decreased speed (as if you're literally tripping over each other in competition) or even losing/reduced Bloodpoints? Implement it like a negative version of Bloodlust, so like you could help your buddy if he was having some trouble with a particularly slippery Survivor, but if it just turns into you both tunneling them then you get a slap on the wrist.
---
Yeah everytime i run into her or her swf squad i stomp them and one alwaaays without fail disconnects to give one the hatch literally just made a post about this.
---
Makes you wonder if the devs actually ban anyone for dc's because i always see the same people doing it.
---
I don't mean to target streamers but they are always so damn hateful.
---
Worse still, I only got 3 stacks of BBQ. Instant dc on first down, then 2 hook dc for the second dc'er.
---
Enjoy that feeling. Your nervousness will just evolve into frustration and salt the better you get at this game.
---
OMG that pupper's face!!!
---
My guess is because it apparently costs a lot of money to roll out patches to console platforms. Just another thing ruined by console ports, it seems (not that I believe BHVR would be much speedier without these supposed restraints).
---
I was at first, &amp; still an to a small degree.  My advice is to just go for it.  Play killer &amp; know that you are going to likely lose.  It's the only real way to improve.  I get demolished every time I play Clown, Billy, or Nurse, but I think I'm getting better.
---
you leave Amanda out of this, you uncultured swine.
---
I think that it's the time that it would take a survivor out of the game when a trap is put into effect. For example the poison, having one survivor no longer working on generators in order to search the map for the antidote would hinder the team a great amount. To me that seems to be the biggest issue. Aswell as the constant alerts that the pig would get from the other traps. I could see many games where 2 survivors are completely focused on getting free of their traps and with the alerts giving away their position every time.
---
Trapper is Jason with more tricks
---
&gt;  this community is tiny enough that it really does make a huge difference if you're playing in a way that you know will make other people in the game not want to play anymore
---
Ok, so let me get this straight. Playing the game with abilities, characters, addons, and mechanics is now somehow equal to playing in a way that will make others not want to play? I'd understand if it's a very poorly designed mechanic that you're intentionally using (read: moonwalking Legion), but moralizing over regular gameplay mechanics is just you being pompous.
---
Yeah, it happens sometimes that you get a swing through a pallet that you shouldn't have. You have no control over that. The game design is flawed in that regard. "Showing mercy" or "recognizing you didn't deserve it" and then being "fair" to them is little more than patronizing self aggrandizement. This "fairness" attitude in a video game with two sides in an adversarial setting really reads like some participation-trophy-SJW nonsense. Not all playing fields are fair, and being sabotaged, intentionally or not, by teammates is a thing that happens. Your teammates will do things sometimes that get you killed or downed, that's just something you have to be prepared for. 
---
&gt; Beyond that, it really does say a lot about you as a person with what brings you enjoyment

For Christ's sake... *It's a damn video game*. If you think that because your subjective take on "fairness" in a video game speaks to a person's character, then the only thing revealed here is that you're an overreacting snowflake that's entirely too sensitive. Stop being such a snob about the way people choose to play a video game not aligning with what you feel is equitable. 
---
&gt; I mean if the only way you enjoy the video game is because you know someone else is getting upset.
---
What does it matter to you? You know the way you beat those people? You don't react the way they want you to. Let's try a little thought experiment. For the sake of it, we'll assume the player is actively seeking to annoy, frustrate, or otherwise anger his opponent.
---
Insidious Leatherface sitting in his basement with someone on the hook. He knows rescue is virtually impossible if he plays it correctly. The survivor hooked doing jumping jacks and cussing either to himself or to his teammates on Discord, in the Leatherface's mind, is an expression of his displeasure with the situation. The survivor(s) that runs down into the basement only to discover the Leatherface, again, in the Leatherface's mind, teabags, points, or runs in circles, again is an expression of his displeasure with the situation.
---
Do you think this is the Leatherface's ultimate goal? If it is, he's only thinking small time. The *real* "jerk players" are waiting for one major thing: end game chat. They *want* you to "go off" on them and tell them how horrible and ignorant and mean they are. They want you to sit there and waste several minutes arguing. The more you argue, the more emotional you become. The more emotional you become, the more they get to make a fool of you.
---
How do you prevent all of that? You *don't give them what they want*. People that are "trolls" in this regard are fishing with bait and hoping to land a big catch, and if all of their bait (read: time) is taken up by small catches, they don't get the return on their bait investment. If you go fishing with $50 in worms and have all of your bait nibbled away, lose the fish, or only catch perch, and your aim was landing a massive catfish or bass (read: raging butthurt survivor), then you just wasted time and money. You may have enjoyed the "experience" of getting out and fishing, but the only person feeling it is you.
---
All in all, the moral posturing needs to be dropped. Stop pretending you're some altruistic force and taking the high ground. If you get *that* worked up about a video game, then there are deeper issues that need serious help. In competition there will be winners and losers. Fortunately, you can continue playing without any permanent deficit. It's astonishing that the same people who will say to killers "you don't have to kill everyone", "you should've stopped chasing", "winning just means a pip, not a 4k", "pallet looping is intended to be in the game. it's all survivors have", or "pips/rank don't matter" are the same ones that will throw temper tantrums because something was "unfair" to them and it reduced or eliminated their likelihood of escaping. 
---
The hypocrisy...
---
As a main survivor, I think the hatch is trash too. Usually the most potato survivor scapes through it...
---
Time to never play Legion again !
---
Personally, I kind of wish each teachable perk wasn‚Äôt teachable. Killer included. This would make survivors and killers so much more diverse. No more same meta build across the board.
---
I think it is the Survivor equivalent to the Killer Slugging  the 2nd to last person to hunt for the last Survivor.  The Killer is using Game mechanics to try to keep the hatch from ever opening and the Survivor is using game mechanics to open the hatch
---
Yup, new players, derankers,  and people who play DBD like a horror game getting scared over everything. Its a mess down there.
---
Bear Traps are fine as is, they don't need the ringing noise. Venus Flytrap having a lot of screaming involved should only be on a failed skill check. I personally like the idea of Venus Flytrap being something that only downs you, rather than instakilling you. I know it doesn't make sense but neither do chainsaws in this game. Shotgun Collar could be a cool idea, I like the idea of having to go to every box to be safe, but it would have to have a really long time to activation in order to be balanced. Poison Syringe, if I'm reading this correctly, isn't something that's meant to kill you, but something that afflicts people with status effects the longer it's left untreated. I think you should remove the death mechanic from it entirely and instead have the effects trigger and stack faster. Say, two full minutes without a cure, and you get Broken. I also think that if this change is implimented (which it unfortunately won't be, even though it sounds mega cool) you should be limited to two traps of each type. That might be too much, and just have one of each trap, and have add ons to increase the count of one type of trap, and maybe an Ultra Rare that increases the count of each type to three. But I think that that add on would have to be, y'know, *actually* ultra rare.
---
chasing is like the core component of the game, practice is key but here's a few things.
---
\- a lot of the time the killer doesn't see you, fog and debris can hide you pretty well even if the killer is really close. unless they're obviously walking at you try to stay hidden and escape when there's some distance.
---
  
---
\- Don't instantly throw down pallets this is a waste of them (unless they're right behind you), instead wait till they get close, if they try to walk at you or lunge (if they do lunge there's a chance they'll get the hit off though) throw it down and stun them, you can use this to run and hide or just prolong the chase by going to more windows and pallets, if you threw it down and didn't stun wait for them to act, if they start breaking it, run, if they try running round to your side jump over it and run or repeat. 
---
\- use tall walls and buildings to break line of sight and escape, urban evasion helps with this a lot as you can lose your scratch marks once the killer can't see you and hide without them knowing which direction you went.
---
\- don't wildly strafe left to right, it actually slows you down immensely, if you're against a killer with projectiles you shouldn't just run in a straight line but there's usually an audio cue you can hear which lets you know when to react.
---
\- learn to 180 turn as they swing, I'm not great at this but when it happens it feels great aha
---
\- there's multiple perks that give you sprint burst, i don't personally use them but i know some people love them. there's also lightweight which makes your scratches disappear faster, balanced landing which lessens the stagger when you drop from somewhere and also makes you sprint if you aren't exhausted, quick and quiet makes you make less noise when vaulting, and urban evasion which lets you fast crouch, not good in a chase but if the killer has lost track its the best thing to keep making distance without showing where you are and ending the chase.  
---
Sorry if my spelling and grammar is a mess. **tl;dr** learn how to use pallets, 180 turns, and when to hide
---
I can't tell if your joking or not but in case your not; Leatherface's actual name is Bubba Sawyer.
---
Yeah Rank reset blows. Had the same as you last night and I asked why no one unhooked and they said "No one unhooks against a Bubba". This was the least campy Bubba, he didn't even patrol after hooking- he used BBQ to apply pressure.
---
But apparently me questioning why no one would even bother unhooking means i am "mad because I am bad"
---
What just happened
---
My name irl is Sidney, and it‚Äôs not used very commonly where I‚Äôm from. Seeing people use it so much is kind of weird, in a way
---
My favorite is when you message them to tell them they should unhook teammates. They ALMOST ALWAYS respond "Don't tell me how to play. I am better than you are since I lived longer and scored me points."
---
\*It's like duh, of course you lived longer since you just leave teammates to die on the 1st Hook
---
Huntress stuff. I may be a dude, but so long as I get the mask, shirt, pants, utility belts, and some LARP-style weapons I think I'll be fine; no need for the main sarafan dress part lol.
---
Leaving the game so someone can get hatch is not game mechanics but I know you know that and don't care so whatever
---
How about you start banning people with ridiculously high DC rates?
---
I know
---
A bond has been formed.
---
I'm sorry you've not had a great experience with the game!  I kind of get what you're feeling, I come from the Blizz background as well, for the Horde - Thrall server! I'm also in my later 40s so its been frustrating dealing with some of the more toxic behaviour. But I think that comes part and parcel with any large group of people of such a varied age/personality rage. Its not League quality, but it could be handled better by BHVR.  
---
I've seen a few of the streamers and its not always the teen/early 20s doing the teabagging/camping/toxic crap.  It is what it is. You'll see it in other platforms. 
---
Can't really say much about your discontent with grinding.  I think its really minimal compared to WoW/GW. It could use some work, but a lot of games can use work. 
---
Hope you find your way back.. GG and best of luck!
---
why is this so funny üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ her smile and the fire in the back is just killing me lmfao thank you op
---
NO FUCKING WAY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Not sure which is more irritating, salt or cheap philosophy.
---
I was and to the people who probably didn‚Äôt get I was joking r/woosh
---
Lmao that last slide is a lie. You don‚Äôt sprint into hyper speed. You struggle while the bastard traps you into a corner
---
Friend of mine did it once, didn't even touch a survivor and got banned today. Pretty sure you are going to get banned sadly.
---
:(
---
That's completely understandable. It's hard when people decide for change or need a break and just (presumably) choose to vanish instead of informing. Hopefully this is what happened and it's not a hack or something. 
---
It's kind of you to be worried, all we can do is hope for the best if no one else has answers. I never knew of the user, so I have no idea myself, I'm sorry. :(
---
Would love to see Legions banned for doing this too.
---
Well, some people tend to drop everything once they've got a trap on them anyway but I'll admit I think I went overboard on notifications. I think the Bear Trap ring could be easily removed it's just, I probably did it because it just felt bland. With the poison, they do get Haste and Endurance so they can check a major portion of the map the look for the Razor Blade box before the poison starts working. If they don't find it or refuse to check, it'll come back to bite them; which is usually how Saw traps work.
---
Does this apply to Fog Whisperers?
---
Lol he was like "sure get the totem and not me" he was streaming too lmao.
---
Wait for dedicated servers. And when they fix the crashing problem of loading into games, you can finally  ban people temporary for DCs. Imagine half an hour for DCing 3 times in like 2 hours.and longer and longer the more you dc. (Only if you are leaving the match intentionally)
---
Oh I forgot, he had red ping yippee
---
I was just making teasing you for suggesting something reasonable when the devs have a history of their bug solutions/outcomes not being reasonable &lt;3
---
...There are perks to counter that. There is no way a killer can counter a DC to give hatch lmfao
---
LMAO!! That would be so creepy, love it.
---
Your own comment's a good place to start.
---
I gave this idea to mostly fit into the Saw feeling. Every Survivor gets their own trap suited for them. The different traps allow for a difference in how you play your trial. Three of them are angled around the Jigsaw Boxes themselves while only one is not; and that one takes the longest to kill you. At least getting the trap off doesn't include one Survivor standing on a square on one side of the map while another stands on another square before knifing a gong or freezing gravestones with a staff that shoots ice.
---
OP just made their account today, so it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it takes a bit to get back to the comments. 
---
I need more non-toxic friends to play dbd with on PC, but I also have it on PS4 so I‚Äôd also be down for this if it‚Äôs on PS4
---
I don't think you were buddy, I think you were just trying to stop the down votes also pal, it's r/wooooshwith4os
---
Non SWF honestly. 90% of all toxicity and bs I see comes from SWF. However here are specifics of things that I personally consider to be BS:
---
1. Flashlight spam
---
2. Bodyblocking 
---
3. Teabagging
---
4. BM in messages (I play console)
---
5. DC‚Äôs
---
Love to discuss these points with u OP
---
‚ÄúWhen salt pretends to be wisdom, then truly that creature has reached the darkest depths of its pitiful nature. Shut up and hit leave match you whiny bitch. ‚Äú
---
Oh sorry but I was that‚Äôs why I put people are stupid as a joke then learn it was real
---
Or maybe those that didn‚Äôt answer have their aura revealed.
---
I will fckin loop you for years tho
---
If everyone survivor just took a couple of weeks to work through Ruin and get really good at skillchecks, Ruin would have to be reworked.
---
What about her addons? These would change drastically. I feel like it would be too many mechanics. Especially when having to remember how to get out of each individual trap. This would be very unfriendly to newer players, and tedious to older players. I like your spirit but it would be too much to change
---
Makes sense.
---
And although I have a PC, I live out in the sticks so my internet is terrible and my gaming PC tanks it even when nothing else is connected and I use a wired connection with the Ethernet cable, plus I don't have DBD on Steam. Until my internet gets better or I get a Vive for Gorn and such, I'll be sticking to PS4 lol.
---
Ok. I have my terminology all messed up. Probably because of the nurse bug and Mettle of Man not triggering
---
&gt;A Killer can grab someone who tries to jump in to the hatch.  Grabbing a Survivor doesn't even require a perk.
---
No reason to make another post about getting facecamped.  
---
I'll be honest, most, if not all, users don't care
---
I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just pissed
---
I feel this in my soul (also I'm a lesbian though so gay and Susie lovers UNITE!! My gf and i cosplayed as her and Julie bc they're a better couple anyway)
---
Understandable, no one likes getting facecamped.  
---
Thanks for listening though
---
I can definitely agree to that. Some people really hate that you can be so reliant on them, but for baby killers I think it's a good way to learn mechanics like powers and controls  vs. The trapper (who left me so confused for my first rounds)
---
What the fuck, god no.  It's gotta be Sidney.  "Hello Sidney."  That's the LINE, man.
---
Claudette.
---
Here‚Äôs some advice: Don‚Äôt be a toxic asshat! That‚Äôs how u get tunneled, reported etc.
---
This looks like the actress from MTV‚Äôs Scream
---
You talking about salty killer or survivors?
---
Same issue. He didn‚Äôt even try to run. He teabagged in a corner and let me down him before dc
---
If it happens, they need to embrace Ghostface being a genre-savvy killer but one that also loses out to just as genre savvy survivors.  
---
So give him a power that makes it so survivors go into first person mode.
---
That‚Äôs a bit too soon dude...
---
Sorry for the caps.
---
DOWNVOTE THIS POST, ART IS STOLEN AND OP IS TRYING TO SELL IT AS IF IT WAS HIS OWN.
---
I stopped playing today because I got farmed and tunneled, every match. In the four matches I played, 1+ person always disconnected. Didn‚Äôt even bother to switch to killer; I‚Äôd probably only have at most three survivors to hunt, followed by bountiful, unabated salt dc‚Äôs.
---
Until there is some kinda ramification for quitting, and the random disconnecting issue is fixed, I just... don‚Äôt want to play anymore.
---
Considering that's your attempt at a punchline, I don't think you have an idea of what's funny or not.
---
I'll actually scream like a little girl if this happens and jump like a kid on Christmas.

Give a 30 minute queue cooldown. They could say it's to give your network time to stabilize. They wouldn't want to have people banned for a temporarily poor connection that was mistaken for rage quitting, now would they?
---
I really don't think he's toxic. I love watching Pug, he's great at the game and fun to watch.  
---
But that's the beauty of Twitch and Youtube... Don't like him?  Well, no one is forcing you to watch him, so go find someone more to your liking?   Lots of good streamers been listed already, would be happy to give you my list of people I like to watch... But Angrypug is at the top of that list.  (And Morf\_UK, people on Reddit hive mind against him too weirdly.  But he's amazing too!)
---
Yea I decided to test the patience of one guy
---
Two hours, He was streaming
---
I went afk to shower / breakfast / coffee etc.
---
He linked me his stream he was messing around on his phone for 2 hours
---
I hope this endgame patch nerfs sweaty nerds like this
---
Also he was playing nurse with whispers so when I snuck off to do a gen he followed
---
I must be alone in thinking farm only games those are, aren't fun. The one I RNGed into was the least fun match I had that day.
---
Gen rushing is popping generators so god damn fast that by the time I load into the game, all four survs are teabagging in the exit gate. 
---
In all seriousness though, gen rushing isn‚Äôt toxic. I can‚Äôt fault a surv for gen rushing. That said it‚Äôs super fucking annoying to see 2-3 gens pop within 30 seconds of each other
---
Do you have any proof this is real?
---
I like how everyone who saw dead meat, and play dbd had one thought, all alike
---
Yes. Being a content creator for DBD does not make you immune to punishment.
---
I don't want to defend the DCs by any means, but I don't think its a coincidence that (at least in my experience) they always seem to ramp up after rank reset.
---
I believe it was stated that you can't undo a link. You might want to put in a support ticket and see if they can do anything.
---
You're in the wrong on this one. You can't equate doing something in-game to pulling the plug. Your argument only works for a survivor letting themselves die on a hook. The devs meant for the killers to be able to slug and they meant for the survivors to be able to kill themselves so that the last survivor can get the hatch
---
I guess it boils down to rng and spawning near gens. I get it's frustrating but so is hearing three heartbeat 15 seconds into the match Haha.
---
New killer leak?
---
History says different.
---
Gens should just flat out be slower and Ruin should be something else. I hate Ruin as a survivor because you either find it immediately or go the whole match with it up. Recently the only killers I see getting kills is either from NOED or Ruin or they generally only get one guy the entire game and that's just ridiculous.
---
Beautifully edited my friend
---
Dewey gets to fake out the audience into believing he's dead a lot. Other than that he's kind of a bumbling fool.
---
this is a great idea
---
Postgame lobby safe space 101
---
Monto and No0b3 create content for DBD, they still got punished. Ochido made ‚Äúcontent‚Äù (lets be real, no one knows what his videos are) and he got punished. The Devs have no actual control over the game, no matter how much we wanna believe they do.
---
If you are a low rank survivor you're going to be going against low rank killers, so you shouldn't need a full perk loadout to deal with them. Try replacing one of your perks with kindred so some of the newbie survivors know that no one is coming for you and that someone has to make a move. They are new/really suck so kindred will help them see whats going on. and get a better understanding of what to do.
---
This is really amazing. Great idea and sounds incredibly fun to play as well. Nice work!
---
If the Devs apply special treatment to Fog Whisperers the community will almost certainly riot, no doubt about it.
---
How about both? Why does it matter which side they were on, it's fucking infuriating regardless
---
Yeah they would have to set limits if this was a thing.
---
Now now now, as a filthy survivor, he has every right to do everything it takes to kill you, including you get no points or fun.
---
Remember: The killer is never wrong!
---
*this message was brought to you by r/deadbydaylight*
---
I've seen this a couple times now.  Why don't people use their BP right away
---
Totems so you don't get hit by NOED
---
Wait. . . the Lorax got confirmed, then?
---
My bad, Let me translate. me survivor me salty toxic boi
---
Ash vs Evil &amp; Dead
---
Ruin isn't even bad, it's insanely good from everything I've seen. Infact I'd go as far to say 3 Hex builds with Ruin, Haunted Ground / Thrill of the Hunt and NOED are generally amazing largely because you can slow down the game a lot.
---
&gt; but so is hearing the heartbeat 15 seconds into the match Haha.
---
Why? Just hide. And 15 seconds is a good amount of time to hear the heartbeat
---
But how do you know they're planning to abuse it? They may just wanna screw around and shank some people
---
i thought i had a hacker in my game when their was 2 killers glad its being fixed

Heey! I just got the postcard today and wanted to say thank you so so much I absolutely love it &lt;3

Gen rushing doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Brand New Part addon for toolbox used to insta complete a generator. 4 swf each having one was the REAL gen rush.
---
In event of modern day ‚Äògenrushing‚Äô, bring NOED and Blood Warden if you have it. Best thing ever around rank reset time is watching that jake park claw and scratch at the entity‚Äôs spikes blocking him from sweet freedom. 
---
If gens pop too fast, chances are ain‚Äôt nobody done any damn hex totem cleansin‚Äô. Bathe in their fear. *** SUDS UP WITH THEIR BLOOD***
---
It's not gonna last 
---
Maybe initially, but at any rank other than low ranks you're screwed. Totems will be bad until they find a good rework. Don't get me wrong. I really like totems, but they just don't live up to taking that perk slot. Once you get a survivor, or get into a Chase they're going down. Maybe it'd be better if you could see which hexes are which.
---
Leatherface has had multiple names in his movies. One of them was bubba.
---
They used a key to escape early
---
Nea are you ok? Are you ok? Nea are you ok? Are you ok Nea?
---
Wondering how they had time to type that out before the host DC'd
---
What'd they do if you don't mind me asking? Out of the loop..
---
This is in my top-three favorite responses.
---
It's ok. We're all asshole survivors, but here's some ways to be non-asshole survivors!
---
1: Never touch a generator or totem.
---
2: Never save someone on the hook.
---
3: If you HAVE to be chased by the killer, run in a straight line.
---
4: Try to stand under hooks most of the game, in the hopes that a merciful killer will take pity on your existence and hook you ASAP.
---
5: Always try to escape off the hook, and never struggle.
---
Now, you're ready for a new life, as a nice survivor!
---
Happy dying!
---
Thanks! I love playing survivor now!
---
That‚Äôs a load of BS blaming it on console ports. They have no problem doing hot fixes or coming out with the Ash vs Evil Dead Update. I‚Äôm sure the Legion mend update could be pushed out once they figure out the error in the spaghetti code
---
When you die, you can type something out and wait until the trial ends.
---
Ahh, you're right about that. That didn't come to mind at all lmao
---
New killer: Swamp thing.
---
It's about time dbd switched it up with crazy gimmicks like this imo. Just go full send with these ideas.
---
The problem is the game genuinely crashes a fair amount while loading for anyone who plays a significant amount of hours throughout the day. It's unfair to risk banning people who aren't doing this on purpose. But I do agree with you, it's annoying af. I'm a killer main and it's just been boring to play against three for so long now.
---
This was a hot minute back but they made a video exploiting on MacMillan Estate (which led to the generator being moved two times, could‚Äôve been more idk) and it was humorous for the SWF, even the killer joined in and thought it was funny. Both No0b3 and Monto received a temporary ban after that, hence why Monto is not a Fog Whisperer. Ochido was a simple liability to this community and he got everything he deserved.
---
I'm aiming for that 500 sacrifices trophy and it's a goddam nightmare.  8 matches, out of the 32 survivors atleast 20 of them dc'd
---
Nemesis as a killer would turn me back into a frightened ten year old and I'm for it.
---
does this look daaaaaangerous?
---
YoU UsEd NoEd
---
So what's the mend time exploit? I know it has to do with the knives but I also use Sloppy Butcher. What do I have to avoid?
---
inb4 LEGION BAD REEEEEEEEE
---
He is, but he's fun to play.
---
Same genning is faster and so is healing the same person as two, the issue is that both of those aren't guaranteed. Realistically speakong Self Caring to 99 and then doing gens with This Is Not Happening is great because you need 39 seconds to heal and however much time is saved from consistent Greats you will get. At least that's what I run sometimes, with the benefit of being able to heal wherever as long as you have some room you can give yourself an extra hit in a chase.
---
That's a crap shoot. No guarantee they're running NOED. It drives me nuts when I see survivors cleansing totems that aren't active and there's 3 or more gens left.
---
Edit: Thankfully the video is still up! Here you go: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pw981msOU
---
Patrick no!
---
I normally don't care either because I'm not trying to waste a bunch of time just standing there lol I just have never seen a survivor give up and just jump in and let me hook them it's always me having to hit them

But how is it done though??????
---
Where do I claim this? I‚Äôve stated you‚Äôre either getting a Camping Killer or SWFs? 
---
You‚Äôre just trying to put people down, sad
---
It should never happen in the first place. You should be actively searching for them and not camping the hatch. If you find and hit them and they should somehow find the hatch but not jump in then by all means wait it out. They don‚Äôt deserve it any more than you do. But consider that the hatch is their only win while you‚Äôve already had 3. Either way, i guess i‚Äôm saying it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ yes!!!

Small Game is such an underrated perk. One survivor should be running it every game
---
One of my friends I played PS4 and occasionally some PC with all the time got a gaming desktop to replace his broken gaming laptop a few years ago and then sold his PS4 and has since become a true PC master race lol. Its very upsetting bc I miss playing games with our little trio (the other two of us have trash internet and one computer between the two of us) but I'm also jealous that he has such good internet AND saved up for a Vive last summer by working gates for the local fair week and a few other things while I get shafted turning in an application at a grocery store and they hire 5 people within a month and a half of me turning it in.

... a bit off topic, but yeah lmao. That about sums up my experience with games right now. Sorry for the rant?...
---
Isn't possible people are using this and don't realize it's even bugged?
---
I spent many hours over the course of a year trying to make nurse work on PS4...and I'm talking MANY. It is impossible.
---
I'm convinced that good console nurses either use a custom controller or mouse/keyboard or something. Between fps drops, lag and aiming with thumbsticks, it's insane. Plus that  fatigue shaking and dimming hurts my eyes.
---
Easily the worst killer experience 9n console.
---
&gt; until they know the cause
---
An addon that's easily accessible and easy for Behavior to disable with a simple PC hotfix.
---
There Legion exploit fixed.
---
Granted I would much rather see a KWF mode implemented with a bunch of limitations put in for balance and such rather than it just be a mosh pit for Survivors and Killers to duke it out lol
---
Nah lmao
---
The only m2 killers are Billy , bubba, and plague. trapper technically can damaged you with his m2 but it's not direct
---
When did they say this?
---
It's funny how MoM won't activated if you're already in the Deep Wound State due to BT but I can understand why.
---
For real lol. I don't mind goofy game types for kill your friends though. With it not having any reward to get I don't care if I win or lose or do well at all I just play kyf for fun.
---
the pic was taken by my gf BTW not me.
---
I'm betting they just go mouse and keyboard tbh, it provides such an edge in so many games it's unbelievable. R6 had a very big problem with people using mouse and keyboard because they were just objectively better and had an advantage over everybody else. Can't remember what happened, whether they even fixed it and what they would have done to do so.
---
Aw ye. Plagues puh jerky
---
So you're not deranking from playing but you're crying because you can't figure out how to counter better players.
---
yeah i understand terror radius manipulation, but that doesnt matter if ur in chase forever, but i get ur point
---
I don‚Äôt think they would release any information of a sequel anytime soon due to them still adding more playable characters and features to this game. On top of this from a business point of view it‚Äôs not smart to release a new game while their current game is still making money. I‚Äôm sorry but I think this is just a rumor but I hope it‚Äôs true.
---
Whats the point of getting it...especially if you didnt earn it.
---
They definitely have the info for people who dc by hitting the QUIT GAME button in the main menu during a game. At the very least they can starting suspending those people. 
---
At the end of the day you have to do *something* about leavers, whether intentional or not. Even if its an accidental dc its still ruining the experience for 4 other players. Getting dropped from a game every once in a while is fine but once it hits a certain threshold of "accidental" dcs then that person's internet is fucked up and they shouldn't be playing online multiplayer games anyway. If they want to continue ruining games for other people knowing they have garbage connection then they deserve the same punishment as other leavers
---
People who abuse the exploit deserve to get suspended.
---
That said, WHY NOT JUST DISABLE 1 ONE OF THE BLADES FROM BEING USED?
---
Yeah but the difference is that Hex Perks are game changing, RUIN not being found can make the game slow down to a crawl, Devour Hope 3 stacks insta down in the middle of the match.  
---
But having an addon that just deletes perks compared to Hex Perks that can make/break games isnt a proper comparison
---
You know, I wonder if cocky survivor mains will ever stop resorting to calling a person "bad at the game" just because they have no other argument. The problem that killer mains have with the game right now (and by proxy, cocky and ignorant survivor mains), is that Looping (with or without pallets) and gen rushing, is that it isn't something a killer main can overcome by getting better at the game. It is objectively true, that a killer cannot stop gen rushing and looping just by being more skilled. Pallets take too long to break, generators get fixed to fast, and the only thing that helps, area few bad perks, that only work well, for killer with extreme mobility.
---
I come across this way too often, just because a player can't beat a certain aspect or level of a video game, doesn't always mean it's because their bad, there are plenty of other reasons that a player might not be able to win, and dbd is one of those examples.
---
You and other people in your group of "Pallet Looping and Gen Rushing takes skill and is fair to the killer even though he can't stop either no matter how good he is" survivors need to stop acting like a killer is bad just because they can't overcome a truly broken and unfair aspect of the game.
---
Console/PC and region?
---
Doesn‚Äôt even get the 4k tho
---
Coaches be like:
---
two wrongs dont make a right
---
I'll be the first to say that I hate Legions with a passion but...really? Banning people? For using add-ons?
---
The other exploit I get (even though it's more fun than being tunneled or infinite loading or loading into a 3 man), but c'mon now...this is just a joke at this point.
---
Exhaustions perks are strong but they arent game changing unlike Hex Perks
---
It definitely has copypasta written all over it, but I've never seen it before nor do I know what Sekiro is. Lol. Just remember, not everyone has seen everything everywhere!
---
Although wasn‚Äôt billy their take on Bubba? Actual question
---
Nice job on saving your teammate :)
---
:3
---
Leaves some room for silly perk interactions as well, ‚ÄúGet the girl.‚Äù ‚ÄòAll female survivors spawn next to you, absolutely in heat.‚Äô
---
If for WHATEVER reason we do get the TV Show, I hope they do Brooke Maddox. There's no bitchy mean girl survivor in the game yet, new trope.
---
Only time I'll ever DC at all is if the killer is abusing bugs and he or she hasn't hooked me yet. if they are using bugs or have an unnaturally terrible connection, then I'll just suicide out to get the points (or kobe). It's just not enjoyable or fair to play that. I'll only DC against that pre-first hook because those killers don't deserve the BBQ stacks.
---
Outside of that though, completely agree. I hate survivors that DC because they basically just aren't happy with the game's progress. Get downed early? DC. Killer you dislike? DC.  Though I've lately noticed that this happens more frequently on both sides. On survivor it's basically every game, on killer it's definitely noticable frequent. :(
---
American Palletball - Never Mendt
---
That would be cool to see
---
If Ghostface is added to DBD I'll have a new main killer
---
As someone who's a little picky with Youtubers, I definitely second Monto. He's a good player with both sides, does interesting or at least entertaining contents, and though his personality is not everyone's cup of tea (isn't mine) it's not overwhelming to where it drowns out the content.
---
Noob and Puppers probably make good content but they're way too survivor-biased for my taste, and I find especially Puppers really fake.
---
It will happen at some point naturally. and it feels better when you earn it.
---
Maybe one of pinheads perks could be that the more stuns he takes he gets a boost to speed or something like that.
---
I feel like a good balancing idea would be to add skillchecks to an exit gate, I believe it would be incredibly plausible the entity would toy with survivors by giving them the false hope that they can simply prance over to a gate and pry it open.
---
Golf as in: golf course sized? Golf club sized? Golf ball sized? Golf cart sized? Volkswagen Golf sized? Or something else?
---
On PlayStation there is a colour blind mode that according to my colour blind friends is pretty good.

I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôd call that racist but do what you want, it‚Äôs your life fam.

Would be great. I want to practice the Nurse but don‚Äôt want to get bullied since my blinks are awful

---

---
Racism doesn‚Äôt even matter anymore. Everything‚Äôs racist now, which means real racism is overshadowed by fake racism. Stop using the word so damn much. Just call the guy an asshole and move on.
---
Some of the killers unique perks are just so crappy that without a perk that slows people down of some kind some killers adepts are so hard to get.
---
Reading this gave me an aneurysm.
---
Wrong on him for DC‚Äôing, but to all the people complaining about the face camping: Camping with LF is a meme, that‚Äôs it, especially in the basement.
---
It should whistle ‚ÄúItsy Bitsy Spider‚Äù kinda like huntress with the humming
---
The ends justify the means.
---
Wraith like almost
---
I‚Äôm sorry , please don‚Äôt tell the lord
---
Epic
---
If you want bloodpoints, your only choice to make is getting BBQ and Chili. 100% extra every game is just too good to pass up. I use it on every killer and I always will, even if they get rid of the aura part.
---
Never trust someone online.
---
Now the game is fair ;)

---
Real talk, are they actually working on any changes for this killer?? And while they're at it, a buff for Freddy?
---
I couldn‚Äôt see it. He was never the ‚Äúchase then down and kill them‚Äù type of killer. He brings his victims to him.
---
Makes me think of Rayman for some reason.
---
Yeah exactly. Though refusing to cleanse puts survivors in a compromising position of having more or less a constant exposed effect. Issue is that it leaves her permanently vulnerable to survivors using dead hard.
---
Worse the end game is her weakest point. Survivors can use the fountains to heal far from the exit gates to remove all the pressure she had with the survivors &amp; to force her to walk away from the exit gates if she wants to use her power.
---
I enjoyed that episode too.
---
I like where your head's at
---
Very true I understand that but you know tossing around the ball and seeing if it sticks is all in the process
---
For what it's worth, I always link proper attribution, be it a direct link to the image or a post URL. May not be included in the title but expect it in the comments.
---
It works if the second-to-last person is still on their hook when you first get hooked, which I‚Äôm guessing is what happened here.
---
I had this glitch happen to me earlier in a solo match. This glitch reminds me of a dog dragging ass on the carpet lol
---
Trapper: "...Huh."
---
Wouldn't mind at all
---
Survivors, mainly. Don't see killers DC very often
---
I think scaling is the way to go. The more dcs per day, the longer the bans.
---
5 min &gt; 10 min &gt; 30 min
---
I can understand it. I have no interest in hag for example. I tried Legion as well but his lack of speed, and his ability really turned me off. I vastly prefer Myers, or Leatherface for the control aspect. Especially leatherface because no one is leaving bubba's basement alive.
---
My dream is Silent Hill's Pyramid Head. But that's all it is going to be: a dream. \*sniffs\*
---
This is all I have ever wanted since I started playing this game. Please üò≠
---
Yeah as /u/HiJumpTactician mentioned there are a few issues with this suggest.
---
First it is very weak. This perk would benefit survivors more than killers, basically becoming the No mither of killers. 8% for killing a survivor which not only takes effort but time is so small that survivors wont even notice until they have lost 3 memebers of their team which by then the last survivor will not need to work on a gen.
---
The second issue is that it does not remove the whole tunneling issue with the perk. If anything it makes the whole issue worse as now the killer would need to tunnel at least 2 survivors to get somewhat of an impact using this perk. 
---
I personally believe Dying light should not benefit survivors but rather provide a slow down effect for every individual survivor hook during the match. This would encourage spreading out the damage while rewarding killers for not tunneling other survivors. 
---
Maybe provide a token every time a killer hooks a different survivor. 2 tokens could be worth 16%, 3 being 20% &amp; 4 maxing at 25%. Even then though the perk can be weak as by the time you hook all survivors individually, around 2 to 3 gens can be finished.
---
I treat them like EXP points i cant spend on characters that i wasn't playing as when I got them, but now i think my autism is showing
---
I used to finish loading in long after other players. Most likely due to having a slow hard drive and small amount of RAM.
---
"Legion Rework"
---
Oh yeah no problem you have a good day. And happy surviving
---
This is a top tier leatherface he demanded the devs give him a better challenge.
---
Lucy survivor please thank you
---
Prince ea
---
Mr. X from Resident Evil 2, gimme that
---
Like Jedidiah, Jackson and Thomas.
---
Thanks. Same to you.
---
Let's see... there are a few things.
---
1. No DCs. NONE. 
---
2. No 4-Man SWF with voice comms or Rank Abuse (e.g. no Rank 3 Survivors in a Rank 10 lobby because they *do not* belong at that skill level) 
---
3. Humility and Sportsmanship on both sides--no BM or condemnation towards a killer's tactics, particularly late game. 
---
4. The Killer is not to be bullied, defaced, or insulted in game or post game. That's an absolute given. It's flesh and blood behind that mask--treat him or her with respect.
---
Moris Franklin before he can flashlight stun
---
Yes. Trapper was also their take on Jason, and Legion was meant to be a Ghostface
---
I get nervous when I see flashlights, multiple items of the same type, or groups with matching names. I have shaky hands so whenever I miss a survivor, it fills me with dread when they move in circles or teabag on the other side of the window/pallet.
---
He looks like Boss Baby.
---
Survivor: Uses skeleton key as soon as he can, leaving two injuired and one downed teammate to die.
---
Other Survivors: (Image Text)
---
Amen to that. Preferably painted with Hellfire.
---
insta heals are used for the speedboost, but it also increases the chase even more also combo it with mettle and you can tank so many hits and run a killer forever, if someone uses an instaheal its basically like "oh shit now i cant chase or im gonna waste even more time" or they r bad and they die in a few secs after. but the main reason its significant is cuz it wastes the killers time
---
Maybe end game collapse will add something new and exciting to the game that encourages killers not to bring ruin all the time.

---
Bring 2 or 3 though, and just when the killer finally downs someone after being looped forever, flashlight/pallet saved multiple times, then you hook them, and they unhook right in front of you, you try to down them but they have a mix of instaheals and MoM and BT, making it virtually impossible before adrenaline pops and they full heal.  
---
Just randomly used it's not a big deal, but mixed with a bunch of coordinated survivors and other powerful perks, it can really make a killer want to stop playing the game.  
---
Oh, and if the killer DARES to have NOED or tunnel, or camp, then they will get death threats.
---
What about Mr axe instead?
---
Or Mr Tex
---
Or Mr x Wong fighter pilot
---
Or better Professor X
---
Thats a yikes from me
---
If that was me, I'd have gotten the entire self-care off without a single fuckin skill check.
---
Bug.
---
yes the game is a bit toxic, but i dont think it ruins it. there are a LOT of games that are more toxic and i love the concept of pvp 1v4
---
i started playing recently and have no idea what 80% of them perks are doing, but they are not that important as far as i notice it. there are like a few core perks like selfcare or noed, but in general they are not really gamechanging. they make some things a bit more easy but feel more like a small reward.
---
What bugs me the most isn't the fact that they won't save you. Is the fact that they are fooling around doing NOTHING.
---
There's always that one guy hidden in a closet and the other two crouched doing absolutely no gens at all
---
Ok then he‚Äôs Gen Y as in *Y Do W Care*
---
Whatchu mean don't play sneaky? You trying to tell survivors not to survive?
---
You're already better than 90% of people, who refuse to try the other side to understand what it feels like. Good job!
---
are you suffering from a mental disease? 4vs1 is for a reason. the more people alive, the more chances to survive and get good bp and pips
---
That‚Äôs neat, thank you!
---
id really rather they not add in more great perks they can lock behind a paywall
---
Survivors who give an offering are three times as likely not to make it past the loading screen. Help those poor survivors.
---
i have no bloody idea, ask this guy..
---
Good. Hopefully you'll be back at rank 20 and will stop doing this bs
---
This is a meme, its already captioned.
---
you can't double pip with 21k
---
I liked that movie
---
I really thought for sure at one point it was all over for us XD
---
And so does disagreeing with someone, or commenting on something, or having an opinion, or being on the wrong side of politics, or liking a certain artist, or not liking a certain artist, or sharing a certain post, or watching a particular news station. When the word racist is overused like it is today, it loses its meaning. I‚Äôm not saying the dude isn‚Äôt racist. Maybe he actually is. Maybe he dons a white hood after his gaming sessions. Or maybe he‚Äôs a black guy trolling online. Who. Cares. You want CNN to Dox him and do an hour long segment? I bet they will.
---
See above for response.
---
Your assumption that this is "pulled out of my ass" is frankly pulled out of your ass. While I'll have you know that I was not trying to "form a theory" any more than a somewhat-snide comment in a video game subreddit, this is based on me having read articles specifically talking to the issue of developers being unable to maintain games on console platforms, due to these payments. I did not look into it further than that, so I don't know whether it is the case for BHVR (or anyone, anymore, for that matter), which is why I decided to use "apparently" and "supposed" in my post.
---
2 more if you have MoM.
---
Remember, this is the 2010 Freddy, not the original Freddy. Plus, Freddy's still in the dreamworld. The Entity just kind of allows him to put survivors in its realm to sleep, thereby being in the dreamworld for Freddy to interact with them. Just think of it as Freddy being in his own little time/void/space pocket, independent of the Entity's realm.
---
You don't even need both blades. A lot of Legions are just using the Nasty Blade with the Iridescent Button and just tagging people over and over and it eventually will stack up to the 5+ Min Mend.
---
Could‚Äôve had bad RNG and fully healed so he could continue the standoff
---
i'm a simple girl. i see a killer who doesn't camp or tunnel, i upvote
---
You're welcome!
---
I don't care what you do. As survivor, I get annoyed at camping and Tunneling but I understand they're necessary a lot of times for victory. As killer, I get annoyed if I get looped to oblivion or gens start popping insanely quickly but that's the survivors jobs and they're doing it. The only thing I prefer is no BMing but 90% of this community are assholes so I learned to deal with it anyway.
---
I get nervous too! Especially when Gens start popping and I don‚Äôt have one hooked yet. I still try my best though and I don‚Äôt tunnel, if I trap someone as Pig, I‚Äôll ignore until they get it off.
---
To date, I haven‚Äôt had toxic messages after chat, which means I know I‚Äôm doing pretty good to make sure they have fun. I‚Äôll always let 1 survivor go though, idk why, I just do. 
---
I‚Äôve learned how to squash the survivors looping though, from watching Monto, I do the whole point the light one way and walk backward and they always tend to fall for it and come to me.
---
Are you okay?
---
r/fourthsub
---
I wasn't camping they were swarming the hook... and there are multiple BT... who hurt you?
---
I‚Äôm totally fine. You?
---
I'm going off of the description of the game in the steam store.
---
You don't have to work together.
---
Calling someone the N word isn't racist?
---
? i wasn't even being rude. you asked a question and i gave you my answer
---
ty for the downvotes salty survivors should just be killers getting banned for exploits üòò
---
&gt;don't be an asshole to other players
---
That's the thing, i'm not. As a former Claudette main, i can tell you that this post is inaccurate. I don't think it was necessary to make a post just because you happened to run into a Claudette which just so happened to be toxic. Ace, on the other hand, is probably mained by OP, so he tries to boost his esteem.
---
But it is in fact real racism to use a racial slur... I am so confused.
---
Why, is it okay to call white people the n word?
---
Only in Dead By Daylight
---
Watching the kill count doesn‚Äôt mean you watched the movie, go watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre all!
---
Haha no worries. 
---
And yeah that blows. Maybe one day you‚Äôll be able to join him in the future? But for now, just make some new buddies until your original trio is reunited once more :)
---
It really has no meaning. It‚Äôs like if I toss kryptonite at someone who isn‚Äôt Superman. Would that be considered attempted murder because there are some people who could die from that?
---
I just ran into double blades and told the legion about the exploit. They had no idea and were very apologetic about it.
---
We play a game where one of the biggest shitposts is that we want Shirtless Myers. I feel we took the horror out of Halloween a long time ago.
---
Ruin, Nurse's calling, Sloppy, BB&amp;Q is what I use for Huntress
---
F
---
More hoping for the Dryad
---
So basically don't play legion at all because salty players will just report you.
---
Is it okay to call a Hispanic person the n word?
---
Survivor logic??
---
Hag has trap totems though? Maybe that's what happened? Of the many games I played I never had such a bug, only hexed totems are lit.
---
Great now if someone is salty about going against a legion they will just lie and say said person was exploiting
---
Only the best of hacks = M1
---
you used to be able to get two or more killers in kyf, kind of imbalanced, not for actually playing, but some people liked it(especially Spirit asmr).
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be racist. It would just be stupid and pointless.
---
He would still have all the power in that situation. Killer auto-loses hatch unless the survivor leaves the room for 30 seconds.
---
You remind me of those guys who buy the Alex Jones nutrition pills...
---
Kids still say fugly?
---
Damn man. Why you gotta point out how I dropped the ball with the thiccness
---
This isn‚Äôt for ‚Äúhistorical context‚Äù, now is it?
---
You can conflate ‚Äúis it racist‚Äù with ‚Äúis it okay.‚Äù They‚Äôre not the same.
---
One thing.
---
Doesn't the cast of Scream, Randy included, watch the movie Halloween during the move?
---
As in, the movie featuring fictional characters Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.
---
Who are both in the game.
---
Wonder how Randy would react to find they're real.
---
And then wake up with no kidneys. Or in one at the head of a fucking cult and invoking the powers of fucking Usain Bolt.
---
Because I use logic?
---
Or get taken by The Entity
---
No. But I just poked a hole in your logic. You said it‚Äôs never okay to use racial slurs, but apparently sometimes it is.
---
What‚Äôs the exploit
---
I see what ya did there
---
Lolol. Gotta secure 1 kill apparently..
---
Are all these toxic folks masquerading something? What do they need to hide? Unless they literally act toxic just to get reactions from innocent people, which is very rude.
---
Nom nom nom...
---
Guess the race
---
Okay, I'm back. Having watched the match and reviewed all the evidence, it's clear to me that you were *trying* to draw salt of the Streamer. At the cost of winning the game. This is evident from you waiting at the top of the basement, only targetting her when other survivors *tried* to draw aggro- and you nodded. And you were more than likely watching her stream as you typed in chat both before, durring, and after the match. You were toxic. I'm toxic. It's fine- but don't deny it. *Embrace* it. 
---
You tried to get the streamer to disconnect, or be salty. And to a large extent, it worked. Your ***huge*** misplay was engaging with the streamer, then coming onto Reddit and trying to spin the events to make yourself look innocent, and her toxic. I'm guessing you did this to rub salt in the wounds. It clearly backfired. Let me explain why. 
---
The key to being toxic is to appear as though nothing phases you, and you don't give a crap. The best, and basically only way to own a streamer is to get into their mind and piss them off for an extended period of time, and try to make it seem like *you* don't care. You want to live rent free in their head, basically. The hate comments are an extension of this- don't get *mad* at the insults, *laugh* at them and move on. Everything you did exemplified this, until you spoke in chat. *Now,* you're as triggered as she is. It's no longer *"I made the streamer mad, lol next game,"* now it's *"We're both salty, let's get in a trash talking flame war."*
---
And, sad to say, you lost the flame war. You lost by letting her chew *you* out instead of her chat since you showed up and spoke. You lost by posting the events on reddit to try and redeem a victory out of the situation. Next time, play the cards right.
---
This is some fallout 76 shit here.
---
ban customers for bugs that WE created.
---
Like seriously just disable legion addons and if you have data on it make the game do an internal check to see if there are 2 killers and auto end the game if there are
---
I tried giving up and pointing to the hook but I would get hit everytime she healed me. Eventually I ran and tried doing a gen. I was trying to see if I could get the hatch if maybe her bleed out time ran out from them using her dying state aura to find me but I couldn't. Was so aggravating. Do you think reporting them did anything? Cause I tried
---
How dare you stay on the hatch and wait for the last survivor! When they could have done Gens or done anything to try to get you away! You camper killer scum! Lmao
---
Reported.
---
60 whole seconds? You monster!
---
Don‚Äôt know why, but my winrate with wraith is 80 percent but for any other killer it‚Äôs 20 to 50 lmao
---
Then I won‚Äôt chase you
---
Is that a Legion insult?
---
I don't think you understood what i wrote. I don't personally find his content enjoyable with the constant screaming/screeching/mimicking memes. It's childish. That's why i said his content isn't for a mature audience.
---
Legion has a couple of addons that increase survivor's mend time for every hit they land on them. In theory it sounds like an alternative to Frank's Mixtape, but in reality it slows the mending process down so much, that it can literally take minutes to complete.
---
You cheated not only the game, but yourself. you didn't grow. you didn't improve. you took a shortcut and gained nothing. you experienced a hollow victory. nothing was risked and nothing was gained. it's sad that you don't know the difference.
---
I'm generally a good killer and yet playing killer feels like a challenge and makes me nervous cause I know in reality I'm the one surviving them lmao
---
Don't go for the stun. Easy as that.
---
Ah yes the mend time "exploit" of using add-ons in the game.
---
Obviously the addons are not something that you want to have in the game, but that's not an exploit. What if someone uses those addons and doesn't use reddit/forums? How would someone that is just now buying the Legion know that these addons are bugged and will **get you banned?**
---
Yep bro. I start up the game, go to the killer menu, stare at who I want to play for a bit. Start thinking I'll probably get bullied to death if I play horribly, then turn off my PS4 and do something else.
---
i had a game where i was kinda forced to face camp becasue they opened the hatch with a key and it was right next to the person i hooked :L
---
Wait, it's been a while since I played dbd or kept up to date with it. What's wrong with legion and their add ons? Any in particular?
---
I know this is a meme but I say this to myself every time I play against a beginner killer when they just face camp instead of doing anything else. I don't message message them this because I don't wanna hurt anyone feels plus it's just a game. Play as you like. Eventually they will start to adapt.
---
Pug literally begs for money all stream and tries to manipulate his minions to send him cash. Even worse is that he's not thankful for the donations - he somehow thinks he's entitled to it.
---
There's better streamers. Tru3, noob, zubat and I'm sure some of the other suggestions in here are good too.
---
tapping is slower than hitting only good skill checks. but two people ESPECIALLY shouldn't be on the same gen while ruin's up, because the second survivor only adds 80% of a survivor to the gen speed, but they get the same frequency of skill checks (i.e. they bring 100% of the regression).
---
Nervous isn't the right word. I get nervous playing Survivor, wondering what horrors await. With Killer I just wonder what names they'll call me when I dare to injure them.
---
Not that I saw, so if you're not following and just using the knives because their description sounds good, you're SoL.
---
Even better, there's that scene in H20 where some girls were watching Scream 2.  So, Halloween is a movie in Scream universe, aaaaand Scream 2 is a movie in Halloween universe.
---
Post a video please!
---
His only massive problem is that he gets auto-fucked by self-care and medkits. His baseline slowdown is actually awesome, it just feels bad that people can do gens in your face because it'll take you a minimum of 7 seconds to stop it.
---
I wish they removed the skill check wakeup shit and added something functionally identical so they could balance it instead of randomly losing because survivors happened to take self-care.
---
The whole point of Totems is to be annoying and make it more annoying to play basically.  They are stalls, they are just *meant* to be stalls so I can't hate them for that.
---
That's amazing. They're practically made to fit already.
---
I've seen the ones on ebay. I recently purchased a payday 2 mask that wasnt licensed via Amazon and it was great but it was made from resin. So basically it can fall half a inch and shatter.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

This has been posted
---
(A) Too many fucking times
---
Takes actual skill to play, did you mean Legion?
---
I feel like with the presence of Up the Ante, the amount of luck one could accumulate might become too much. I personally wouldn't want practically risk-free Kobes.  
---
Even Deliverance comes with a relatively high risk.  
---
Your change to Integrity might not be quite enough, because what if two people running it were close to each other, nearby the killer kicking a pallet? The killer would have a hard time tracking either of them.  
---
I personally don't find the idea of punishing killers for eliminating loops very attractive. I would want to change the perk into something different entirely. I'm not quite sure to what, though.
---
This so called vet is still useless as a survivor :D
---
it's awesome, just needs an axe
---
like i said,i can 3k and 4k in these ranks,pip almost every match,the thing is,is just not fun,simple
---
Sticking on the same gen is bad because running together is less efficient. Only one person can vault at a time, so unless you're surrounded with 3 badass jungle gyms (at which point the killer probably considers that gen lost anyway), 3 people on a gen guarantees that one's getting bopped with not much effort.
---
As a killer, I love when I find 3 people on a gen, because I'm spending one chase occupying 3 peoples' time. If I find one person alone, then that means there's 3 people doing gens while I'm chasing that one person, and if that person has a fucked up loop then I have to just give up on them.
---
Jesus christ the dude just made a statement and yall are attacking him. And I agree, 2 wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
Dewey lol
---
Lol I said the same thing about BBQ and Chill. I just don't do good without it
---
Oh same
---
I always let Lauries go when I am Mikey tho usually
---
You know before the devs publicly announced this bug I "only" faced like 2 or 3 legions that abused this shit. 
---
Since this statement I've faced about triple that in just a few hours. Thanks devs :D
---
I don't play much survivor, but I usally use feng with the year of the pig event outfit.....im normally downed first, eh oh well. I like my outfit
---
But you camped him before knowing he was a racist tbh, so you probably camp others who aren‚Äôt racist considering the fact you use NOED on the huntress ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But if it is TV Please let it be Brooke Maddox. A non-typical final girl. That's only if it HAS to be TV.
---
Trapper is the killer from See No Evil I think
---
Damn youre special
---
When you repost a meme and slap a lazy, unrelated macro onto it. Yawn.
---
Gen rushing IS annoying, but it's not the survivor's fault as much as it's the dev's fault.
---
To be honest, playing killer calms me down. My anxiety comes with Surivvor gameplay
---
They were using it as an analogy to explain the copy pasta
---
Because you have no way of knowing if you'll go against a freddy whereas this bug always will work no matter what?
---
Wowsers... I in fact was not camping and have a total of 6 perks on huntress. I notice you are siding with the guys who said the racist stuff and this is alarming to me.
---
I think people should be shamed for being toxic people like that in this community
---
Are camping and racism comparable?
---
That's a stretch
---
Well they really should do that... I see they are so busy with an upcoming update and such but at least it needs to be explained in game. It‚Äôs just unfair for those who use it without knowing the bug.
---
What you trynna do villainise a black dude for being racist? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è even harder
---
No because you brought the stream of consciousness to CNN doing a doing a doxxing witch hunt... It felt like when Alex Jones mentions his nutrition pills.
---
And it's usually an Officer Leathercock that does it
---
Its actually, " Welcome to the kill count, where we tally up the VICTIMS in all our favorite horror movies..."  
---
:)
---
discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.
---
You right
---
Adept trophies used to be so much easier to earn. I‚Äôm sorry if it feels too difficult. You should persevere and try harder.  Hell, offer more advantageous maps if it helps. 
---
Anything in your power to help you win is more beneficial to you than asking them to hand it to you.
---
I hate that I main Claudette, but I hate most Claudette‚Äôs. #whenyoureaclaudettethatdoesntplaylikeone
---
Kryptonite is radioactive and actually ended up giving Lex Luthor cancer. So maybe, yeah. Also, calling someone that insultingly is racist
---
Never payed for an update/patch since Windows Vista, and never spent a cent on my psp, ps2, PS3 or ps4
---
Chill out bruh why are you getting so tensed up üòÇ
---
It's a bad perk but I'm not losing a good medkit every game so it's all us poor survivors have.
---
So using a racial slur to someone is okay, or not racist, if they aren't that race... Why not, it's 2019 nothing else makes sense.
---
What kind of cunt gives people shit for NOT using noed? Jesus.
---
You can't change how you feel, but you can not post your rant on a place that is specifically asking us not to rant.  Reading comprehension is not that hard.
---
Yuy I love these posts. When one tries to understand The Other. I understand gen rushing. Doing the generators as fast as possible. Is it wrong? No. Is it toxic? No. Is that your job as a survivor? Duh. I use the term gen rushing, but not to complain or cry. It's just a thing, a strategy. Just like Camping and Tunneling is a strategy, a thing. Just us doing our job, choosing a way to get it done.
---
Rank reset did just happen so give it a week
---
You might wanna mention what you play on lol the console
---
I lose the motivation to be in that trial, but I'll just reboot and play further
---
I do ever time and I'm a red rank killer. The only thing I can think of is just lose super badly. I really hate losing.
---
LOL I'm curious now. I've always been on the Killer's side. Did they screw up on the survivor's perspective? That's funny
---
How is a killer with no counterplay in chases balanced?
---
Yup, not a good thing to call someone but to say that just saying the word is racist is wrong. At least today, it would be different if we were in the middle of the slave era.
---
How am I being unintelligent or egotistical?
---
this is gonna sound ultra humblebraggy but i had a game where all my teammates died and i ran a nurse around for over 10 mins, so when he finally downed me he just let me wiggle out and do gens to escape
---
in postgame he was like "you beat me straight up, you deserve the win"
---
If he had red ping that's probably why? I've seen some killers facecamp the laggy survivors for not finding a better lobby.
---
I just put down my controller and watched YT videos. I wanted my points. They gave up pretty fast since I wasnt running or doing anything.
---
It's hard to say.... I don't think they honestly do anything. But it doesnt hurt to try I suppose
---
Rise, my Quentin squad, rise!
---
The hilarious part is I get 4K‚Äôs when I don‚Äôt have all three slots unlocked or when I don‚Äôt have all 3 unique perks. But when I‚Äôm trying to get adept it never works
---
Fine, is it racist to call a Hispanic person the n word?
---
Oh god no please
---
You can 4k 5 gens no add-ons no perks with every killer against bad survivors. Freddy is the worst killer because good survivors shit on you and your power is only making it worse.
---
No... Dont you dare complain.
---
I managed to do hags adept trophy... Pre-buff... On console... Against Swf...
---
Try, try and try again is all i can say
---
I do.
---
If it's not racist why isn't it okay I mean the context clearly has changed right and context makes it okay to use the word. While I even agree there is contextual reasons to use the n word suck as quotation. Using the word as an insult period is racist.
---
Putting your name beneath it as if your attempted meme is so good others will try and steal it cracks me the up
---
Just because something isn‚Äôt racist doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs okay. They‚Äôre not interchangeable words.
---
I like smashing Dwight heads too much. I gotta reboot. THAT IS THE THING NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. If it's a Dwight the Loading screen seems to be more 'common', triggers me
---
when you whip out a glock and shoot up the enemy soccer team
---
So either nobody wants to play killer no more or the matchmaking system that was supposed to fix lobby dodging and ranks mixing backfired against the surviors
---
I mean, I agree that he's the least effective of all the killers currently but putting it into quotations is part of the joke.
---
Speaking of which...We need a witch as killer. And yeah I play on PC/EU too. I'm not that much of a voicechat fan, because it takes away the surprise.
---
The addons themselves just make it so mending takes slightly longer - the bug however causes this additional time to be added each time the survivor is hit by frenzy. It's not the intention of the addons and are bugs
---
Period, using the n word as an insult is racist. Help me understand differently.
---
Again you‚Äôre trying to interchange ‚Äúracist‚Äù and ‚Äúokay.‚Äù Just because I don‚Äôt think something is racist doesn‚Äôt mean I believe it‚Äôs decent behavior.
---
Isn‚Äôt the Hag considered a witch? I mean she does some type of magic? Also same, I‚Äôm way too shy for voice chat but it‚Äôs somehow more comforting to know you are playing with someone you know and since none of my friends own the game or anyone in particular in my country it‚Äôs a biiit hard
---
I fully agree, having this information as part of their news splash that is available in game and pops up when the game is first loaded is important.
---
Not really. I mean, its just a game, after all. You win some, you lose some.
---
You‚Äôre hopeless man. You almost had it before when you said calling a Chinese guy the n word is wrong. Because it is wrong. But it‚Äôs not racist and most Chinese guys would just laugh at you for doing it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even black you idiot.‚Äù They wouldn‚Äôt get offended and call you a racist.
---
Nah bruh, if you were a Killer main, you'd agree with me. Nice try, but you're not a good lier.
---
I‚Äôm going to guess they were level like 15 haha
---
Nice bait
---
I've been wondering, what were the changes made to Freddy?
---
So it reminded you of something completely unrelated, and didn‚Äôt remind you of CNN actually doxxing someone and encouraging a witch hunt?
---
Survivors like you won't be satisfied until the Killer begins the match with three generators already completed. Sorry bud, but you are just another survivor main who thinks that Gen Rushing and Pallet Looping are fair and balanced, which means you're mentally challenged.
---
Gadzooks
---
They are most likely going after people who abused it multiple times, the steps to reproduce the bug is very hard and if someone have done it twice in a row they aren't innocent
---
You know what pal, I am rank 20, the highest I've gotten was rank 14, and you know what, I'll never be able to get higher, there is nothing wrong with that, but there is something wrong with rank 1 players being able to drop their rank to play with low skill killers, and rank reset, does the exact same thing, and it ruins the fun for anybody who is not a god at the game.
---
Legion. Doesn't really matter to me in a way, I'm just watching YouTube on my other monitor. I'm just really confused because you're supposed to get crow notifications after 3mins of a survivor not doing anything, and all gens are 0. Odd.
---
monkaS on the multi killer, good luck friends who did it
---
Yeah ok. Clown good though right?
---
My (wo)man! *high fives*
---
Apparently I do... anyways, the last sentence I clearly said ‚ÄúI still love the game though‚Äù with no hint of sarcasm, ‚Äúreading comprehension isn‚Äôt that hard‚Äù. My rant was chill honestly, it‚Äôs not my fault I don‚Äôt have anywhere else to rant to until that stupid all caps day. For some reason you somehow took it aggressively? There was also no reason for you to reply, ‚Äúsilence can be just as powerful as speaking up‚Äù... you‚Äôre such a hypocrite jesus christ.
---
Also side note, it‚Äôs 2019, I wasn‚Äôt calling you an actual boy if you didn‚Äôt understand that lmao.
---
Yep, and this bug only works with 2 players working together (1 survivor has to be helping the killer to queue into another's killer's match)
---
Ahh ok. They will be moving around and that stops crows. I had a game last week we're it was like that for about 10 minutes then he got bored and started on a generator so I just got him then.
---
 There is a million hiding places on the swamp.
---
Oh now you‚Äôre going to get racist against Jews?
---
Maybe go round the gens and smack them and pretend to give them a free win. Then just kill them if they show up.
---
Then 3 gens pop one after the other and you realise everyone‚Äôs doing the same thing. So good.
---
an exclamation of surprise or annoyance
---
Read sub's rule number 3.

---
Which means God‚Äôs hooks. Which could be insulting to some.
---
You got a valid point. Yeah she probably is, I just picture her as gollum lol
---
Dang too shy, how dare you o-O
---
But you need to be interacting with something to remove crows I thought? It's been well over 25mins and all gens are at 0 so there should be crows none the less.
---
And according to you saying anything at anytime that could be construed as insulting to someone somewhere is always 100% racist.
---
I try to get better, what's with assuming I'm not trying? That's not a very smart thing to do.
---
Done it every now and then nothings happened lol
---
If 4+ gens are left they'll probably just be hiding
---
I literally said there is contextual reasons such as quotation... So no
---
No mate you just need to be standing still for that to work. If it's been that long I would probably DC and report for holding the game hostage.
---
Damn mimics
---
Clown is fine tbh. His issue is he lacks ANY pressure base, although that's fixed by say Ruin which slows down the game *just a little bit.*
---
Dude I wish they would fucking implement something new instead of just killers and survivors like dedicated parties or new game mode.
---
Just wanted to point out that I see older gamers blaming anything they don't like, be it gameplay issues, community issues etc.. on their age way too often.
---
Yes, memory is affected with age, but the difference in skill between a player in their 20s and a player in their 30s - in these type of games, FPS and similar are completely different - is mostly related to a lack of time and willingness to invest more resources in the game than "mental sharpness". 
---
As for the vocabulary, every game has mostly their own "lingo" even with players the same age. It has nothing to do with age. 
---
Communities in online video games have always been toxic, I find this one no more toxic than WoW, LoL , or Smite, or Overwatch.
---
As a fellow gamer in my 30's who's also new to this game and definitely casual, I'm having a lot of fun, I've met some very nice players even though I mostly play solo. 
---
Sorry to see you go and hope you find another game you enjoy. If you don't feel free to add me if you're on pc.
---
Wow they made a film out of the Dbd killer, crazy :)
---
Just wait for rank reset, then profit, or just keep playing, its mot that hard to 4k anyway
---
If you think they are overperforning you are wrong, just because wussys just DC, that doesn't make the killer better XD
---
it's the only 100% necessary perk on scratched mirror builds due to giving you 0 terror radius outside of chase
---
Ya man would love to hear an update as well. People can be such dicks on this game.
---
Nope, I've experienced the combo above. You don't need both.
---
When you first start the match, run to your ruin to make sure no one is cleansing it. Be careful though, some survivors take advantage of that to know where your ruin is
---
Stop camping reddit lol, killers and there nerves!
---
Don't worry it's good to vent even if you think it's kinda dumb to vent about a game sometimes you gotta talk about what ever it is that's bothering you (I main killer and I get salter than the red sea )good luck in your games
---
Ikr and I even got a autograph from the actress that portrayed Amanda herself!
---
‚ÄúFound the incel‚Äù
---
Doctor Who was in my mind but that game is awesome years later still.
---
Banning people who abuse moonwalking as legion when?
---
That's an area the hag excels in. Trapping a hooked survivor
---
:D it‚Äôs like meeting a completely new person and making conversation with them doesn‚Äôt it make you anxious?
---
Entity be like:
---
‚ÄúD E P I P      L O L‚Äù
---
They‚Äôre not banning people who use add ons, they‚Äôre banning people who exploit bugged add ons. There‚Äôs a difference and they have enough game data to get a good idea of who is doing which.
---
THE CASTLE GATE REMAINS CLOSED
---
Mb I eventually found him and just reported him. Crazy how crows can go away by just walking tbh
---
No please don't bring Dokkaebi to dbd
---
Yeah I do the same thing: As a survivor I jump straight into it and see what happens  (if the killer is not just blocking it, if the killer does block the hatch I will just go away and let him hit me/ do the nearest gen / totem / whatever there is left to do). And as a killer I will just hit them and look if I can still get them (if they jump to late, or don't pay attention whatever), but I won't go out of my way just to waste my time on a standoff on either side, because let's be honest here: If a hatchstandoff occurs and it lasts more than a few minutes it's not about the BP anymore, it's about who has the bigger ego.
---
I eventually found him and reported him. Took around 35 minutes lol but I watched some Netflix so win win üòÅ
---
I'm actually blown away by how it of context you had to take my statement to get here. I'm convinced that your drinking water has heavy metals in it. I hope that going forward you have a good night.
---
Its why watermarks exist, chief
---
Outstanding move
---
I still want to know the context in which this copy pasta was used in dbd.
---
Http://steamcomunnity.com/profiles/76561198952675694
---
I've been in a game with 2 people usinh the name 'all hail the killer' and the second the game started they run up a hill out in the open. A short time after i hear the t3 michael music and both of them go down.
---
As i was finishing my gen the 3rd guy (a rando i assume) got downed as he tried to save while mike was still in t3.
---
So i pop my gen and run over there, nodding at mike and presenting my bottom to him.
---
In postchat i got flamed by the rando for that but seriously does anyone think i waste my time on a match like this?
---
the 2 killer thing includes many steps and result is not guaranteed. from what i've seen, people just fuck around with this bug cause it's weird. i was involved in one of those, there's a video in my posts too but it was fun and cute. me and other killer were just slashing each other and farming with survivors. no one got hurt. 
---
but no one cares that the game will be ruined for Freddy, surely. cause it's Freddy. devs hate Freddy.
---
sweaty killer complains..
---
/s
---
fair enough.
---
This is crazy. It literally just needs a hotfix to temporarly remove the addons.
---
Keeping them in the game and telling people on the forums not to use them is bullshit.
---
btw I hate legion and I only played legion for the achievements when it came out and haven't touched him ever since, but I would feel bad if someone was accidentally banned for using the addon combo without knowing it...
---
Ok...what do you want us to say OP?
---
Yup
---
just.. dont do hatch standoffs then
---
I dont really care what killer i face people need to stop complaining.
---
Yeah the map is more or less worthless.
---
Rank 9 isn‚Äôt that low anymore after the emblem changes, deppipping due to rage quits from survivors and killers, and rank reset. A lot of people in green and purple ranks now are people who used to be red ranks but don‚Äôt have the hours a day required to grind their way up there now.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm getting downvoted for telling the god honest truth. I saw this format and thought this would be a good meme idea. That is it. Downvote me all you want, that won‚Äôt change that the fact is I haven‚Äôt seen that post before.
---
WHAT SIDE EFFECT? THATS THE ONLY EFFECT BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS HAS NOW, THEY JUST FORGOT TO CHANGE THE DESCRIBTION TEXT! HAVEN'T YOU READ THE LAST PATCH NOTES?
---
ALSO WHY ARE WE YELLING! IT'S NOT EVEN RAGE WEDNESDAY!
---
This is crazy really. Like the prestige exploit back in january.
---
You can't leave something in the game and tell people they can be banned for it on the forums. Some people don't read that shit. Either you make an in game announcement or you hotfix it.
---
It's actually ridiculous how the devs expect every player to either 1) go on this subreddit to be updated on this or 2) go directly on their forums.
---
~1000 people are on this subreddit, which is less than 10% of their entire player base. The vast majority of their players don't go on the forums either. The temporary bans that will be given to people simply because they don't check the forums is completely absurd. 
---
Disable the add-ons until they're fixed, not ban people. BHVR are seriously incompetent.
---
They can report every Legion they face, but the report isn't going to do anything if they aren't using those add ons. Who cares if they report them, they'll never get punished if they aren't using them as they haven't broken any rules.
---
Yes, they should ban people for abusing an exploit that ruins games for people. Just like people that used to get on certain rocks and hold the game hostage, or those that got outside of the map and held the game hostage, or back in the day when you could get under the killer on some drops and keep them in the falling animation forever (till they dc) because they'd bounce off your head.
---
Abusing game-breaking exploits is bannable. Yes it's their fault that they exist, but those who actively choose to abuse these exploits are at fault too and deserve the punishment.
---
How to play with out ruin

I can confirm this
---
ban time
---
Or maybe people should stop reposting art :)
---
I mean once one guys disconnects it cases a ripple effect, 5 gen 3 man whats the point
---
When you play Unreal tournament single player and in console write 'god'
---
You still abused a glitch and the survivors + killer got robbed of having a normal match.
---
No lets not..
---
Enemy team too busy flaming their own team
---
Billy was right in front of me guarding the hook when I did that. I guess we were coordinating who's gonna bait him and who's picking up Claudette. At 0:46 you can see him vaulting a window while I was unhooking her. He took the bait and followed our other team mate.
---
It's because they have small pp
---
Right to report. That is pure taking the game hostage.
---
Still, end game collapse should prevent this sort of thing.
---
This happens so frequently too, hope they do something to avoid situations like this.
---
The exploit works with only one blade too, it just adds less time to the mend. 
---
Double blades is just more effective as it adds more time.
---
If your art is watermarked people would know its you and will check you out :) Why do you think shitty artists layer their patreon all over their garbage
---
That's incorrect that it requires another player to be complicit. With the simplest method of performing the exploit the person who invites you may have no idea you are performing the exploit until you get in game. It does not always show you as a killer in the pregame lobby, even if you perform the exploit successfully.
---
It's not funny for people who want to play the game. I kept getting those matches all week and they are really annoying after the first 2.
---
You can't really do it on accident, it requires you to work with your survivor partner.
---
This is my tactic too. I had a legion yesterday running Frank's and Cold Dirt. Trying to be as toxic as possible slapping on hook etc, end of game chat he goes "Outskilled retards, too ez" etc and I just said gg and hope has has a nice day, he was so confused lmao.
---
Stop lying
---
A lot of the Fog Whisperers are toxic assholes who constantly DC, no riots so far.
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre playing on console so just set your settings so that only friends can message you. Problem solved.
---
League is punishing leaving people for a long time now and they don't care why it happened. DC? Ragequit? Crash? Doesn't matter.
---
Those people who intentionally quit don't have to be banned. It's enough to just let them wait several minutes to join another game or put them into a low priority queue. This would reduce the amount of quitters tremendously. Why leave a game when you have to wait anyway? Might as well get some more blood points then, eh?
---
"Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Leatherface ecc..."
---
**Amanda will remember that**
---
If you have never been banned before, you will only be banned for 24 hours.
---
Yep exactly...
---
I started playing again because I learned the legion achievement is not broken after all - time to get banned for that now - oh boy.
---

Good call, and yes I'm on console one of the most toxic communities you can come across.
---
That's awesome you found him, I hope you caught him too! I had a guy hide for 10 minutes as the last person left tonight and I was on the other side of the map of the hatch, it felt so good finally finding him too far from the hatch lol.
---
Billy doesnt need ruin ;D 
---
Im playing like this, never had a problem
---
I took a break from Dbd around the end of Feb, and only played 2 or 3 games here and there since then, I realised the amount of ruined/3man/infinite loading bugs far outweighed the actual fun. I will probably go back at the next patch, but this bug specificly. (It was crashing about 1/3 of all games) was just too much to deal with.
---
I've seen multiple players exploiting the rock glitch to hold games hostage for as long as possible go free without any punishment for months. It'd be a real shame if they permaban for this while letting more malicious players go untouched.
---
yo is that tanner from high school?
---
if you consider that toxic you've not seen anything
---
Hey that‚Äôs me! @xbox @trampishsteak
---
A lot of the time i'll lose the will to play when I have to close the game. It immediately kills my good vibe.
---
already done this for my own killer, it's a wooden post with a lantern on one side and a hook hanging from rope on the other side
---
YES. UPVOTE UPVOTE UPVOTE. THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR TOO LONG THAT IS BEING IGNORED.
---
My friend has recently left the community entirely because her artwork is constantly stolen and used without credit.
---
Saying "credit to artists" IS NOT CREDIT. You DO NOT have the right to use somebody's artwork WITHOUT their permission or without at least crediting them.
---
Indtagram is notorious for it, and people just comment "nice work!" instead of calling them out on their bullshit. Stop letting it happen, defend artists.
---
Killer has never been easier...but swf is still the strongest thing in this game. Unfortunately solo survivors have taken the hits for swf‚Äôs overtuning, thereby making killer a less stressful experience overall. 
---
But like I said, a good swf is still stupid strong, and games still go quick at high ranks without ruin.
---
Rank reset just happened. A lot of previously red rank killers are still making their way back down or just simply sticking around lower ranks for a while. It's not only killers though, I still often get destroyed by survivors with thousands of hours in game at rank 10. They'll move back up the ranks at some point.
---
Purple ranks are still infested with really good rank 1 nurses. They'll all be gone soon though since the survival rate for those matches is practically 0.
---
Watermarks do not. a direct tag to their blog, account, original post is correct crediting and is also not hard to do.
---
Many reposters like to blur or crop watermarks out too, and if we put a big ugly one over the art they tell us we ruined the art.
---
Stop calling people shitty artists, it's disrespectful. All artists struggle to feel confident with their art and will often beat themselves up over it, they don't need children like you insulting it as well.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna call your bullshit out
---
This is basically me, I don‚Äôt get angry I just wish this a good day and move on once the abuse starts.
---
this community i swear
---
okay? pretty sure most people think that's gross, but it doesn't mean their art is bad. let them do what makes them happy, if they have patreon supporters.. so what? live your own life instead of insulting others.
---
now.. onto artists that draw the normal stuff. they're constantly treated like shit by the community and it needs to stop. give artists respect and credit them, it's really not difficult. if it wasn't for them you wouldn't even have any content, so to turn around and say "no i won't credit you, use a watermark" is just unnecessary rudeness. grow up and credit people
---
Unskilled,
---
Female Myers.
---
A lot of universes do that which is quite funny, DC is a thing in marvel movies and Marvel is a thing in DC moveis.
---
Lmao they made the pig into a real thing
---
Weird. I ended up in 2 killer game only once, and i had no idea who the second killer was. Also, i dont know how it happened. Would I get banned either way?
---
Completely agree. I've lost every game I played against scratched mirror myers (only had a couple of games in a few hundred hours now though), but I had so much fun and got jump scared so much. Also I didn't find it unfair since there's definitely counterplay. Prayer beads spirit is just OP though. I've only ever used it twice when playing her and I felt really dirty afterwards.
---
DbD doesn't use VAC so it wouldn't show up on his profile if it was DbD.
---
Give a new objective and bring back old pallets
---
I have no clue why you're being downvoted, but you're correct. 
---
He's mocking the killer for not being able to use NOED to make a comeback.
---
It's okay to camp a good soul too, strategy is strategy
---
What you can try as a new killer, it set yourself goals like a daily Ritual:
---
This game, I need to hook all for survivors at least once
---
This game, I will try that get a hit through a pallet.
---
This game, I need to end the chase within one minute, or find another target.
---
It makes for some fun games, and it's good exercise for how to play killer
---
You don't need to learn DBD, though. She's like, the definition of a shortcut to being good at killer. You have to learn way less, and Legion is never good, so he's not a shortcut.
---
Ghostface is basically legion.
---
Very, VERY ironic you say this honestly, sounds like you are just another person that hates being judged and everyone that doesn't suck you they have "no brain". Jesus you are just as toxic as the ones you hate,rather your mentality is toxic actually.
---
Shattered glass hooks for spirit would be so nice.
---
What I see as a fair game is both parties trying their best to win and show sportsmanship towards eachother
---
I'm not the one who made this post but I have a Oneplus 6.
---
This is why I have a Rank Reset Build: Kindred, Empathy, Borrowed Time And Prove Thyself/Leader. Basically I assume the Power Mom role and have to take care of three children who can‚Äôt stop drooling on themselves to stay on task. I try to start in chase ASAP or immediately hop on a gen and get someone with me or run with someone else and reward them for being a teammate.
---
Yeah, pretty much this. OP's lack of foresite to prevent this disaster quickly led to them using their own copy pasted comment to defend their ego, while also indirectly calling everyone that doesn't just say they liked their video toxic.
---
He didn't come up with it on his own. It's from a very popular fan creation post, he just wrote it out here without giving credit.
---
No, but he can see you getting in, so it's best not to actually try that.
---
Animation wise Legion (victim fights back) and Hag (Savagery). But both lack perks so not playing either right now
---
The only toxic ones are the pieces of shit who actually play legion
---
Until you find out this is the first ever licensed cosmetic and it's just a new skin for Legion.
---
Distortion doesnt work well on nurses as it doesnt block the other persons aura you are healing
---
Yes.
---
What's WGLF?
---
Oh no I get and understand that. But I‚Äôm talking about just healing myself. A few days ago I saw a token get used and then 2 not set used very quickly. But just tonight a Nurse just walked right up to where I was hiding when healing
---
Just killer mains sucking their own dicks
---
Well it's looks as if I found another Freddy main. Welcome to the club
---
This shit again.....
---
That does seem alright, but consider one major flaw: this directly combats the effect of Save The Best For Last. So while this perk is nice on its own, it completely negates the bonus of STBFL.
---
\*noise of The Pig being pallet stunned\*
---
I went to this tweet and the one in the picture is not there now but  "this tweet is not available" is there. Probably weren't supposed to talk about it
---
How sad must you be to call someone a piece of shit for playing the game...
---
Rank 15's in a nutshell
---
To get a target killed ASAP. That's about it. 
---
It happens that I chase the savior and after catching/losing the savior, I bump into the guy who the savior unhooked. Well sorry but I'm not just going to ignore him cause I caught him recently. I don't see that as tunneling, just dumb luck
---
They're legion players, not a big loss either way
---
The Entity's true form cannot be comprehended by human minds...
---
This answer may be useless but put yourself in their mind. how would you react if you were in their position. Also, this becomes easier the more you play

I mean that doesn't make the messages the guy sent ok.
---
ok?
---
Except you'll get banned for it
---
I believe that camping and tunneling is a viable strategy.
---
I don't mind sacrificing a team mate to get a gen or two done.
---
Will the disconnecting epidemic be addressed? What about offering a small bonus to survivors and killers for using character specific perks? It seems like every killer and survivor runs identical builds and it makes games redundant
---
They wouldn‚Äôt be able to add a new main objective without adding a new time stalling mechanic as well.
---
I mean if you did it while they said you couldn't then you defenetly deserve a ban. But if you did it before they released any statement I don't think you should get punished.
---
I'm upset at the fact that they weren't clear about it. If you are going to ban players be straight forward. With the prestige exploit it almost seemed like they were teasing people into doing it to ban those that did it. 
---
They said something like they were working out a way to find out those who exploited. And so there was a possibility that you could get away with it.
---
They should instead have said from the beginning that people doing it would be certainly banned. Leaving a hint of you being able to do it and getting away is bullshit.
---
Some DbD content creators I watch that arent super "omg im soy toxic" are:
---
Monto

Noob3
---
Farmer John

Demi
---
Ardetha
---
TrueTalent
---
The King
---
I also watch some smaller ones too.
---
I leveled him up and got all those anti pallet perks. He's great fun to play. Easy to catch people. DC's are satisfying. I have officially called my clown Mr. Green cause I love that green hair cosmetic. Also his laugh gets to me, also he juggles the knife like a pro.
---
I keep hearing about this guy, and it's always bad stuff hahahaa
---
Don't forget about exploit legion
---
Earlier today I played Pig on Lery's and it was fucking stupid.
---
Outplayed a Laurie at a center pallet, she DC'ed one minute in. I hooked two people in basement shortly after. One was a Meg who gave up immediately &amp; didn't struggle. The other was a Jake who was in the basement and somehow got hit twice by me with Meg on my shoulder (not running agitation). I go upstairs from the basement and kick a gen nearby and walk off in the furthest direction and immediately run into an Ash. Ash is caught and DC'es and immediately accuses me of hard proxy camping for whatever reason, when I ran into him as I was leaving.
---
I don't get this game anymore and BHVR really needs to step up DC punishment bc it ruins the game for everyone yet happens every match.
---
Learn form this guy, lads
---
We're Gonna Live Forever

Can you teach me to be this kind? I can be a really gentle soul at times, but I flip a table when someone goes out of their way to harass me

---
You can look on the wiki for what these add-ons do. Sorry for laziness, I'm in a car going home after a vacation.
---
I don't consider Gen Rushing a thing really, when im playing killer and multiple gens pop really fast then im not applying enough pressure.
---
Cuz in all honesty what should survivors do? not do gens? it doesn't make sense.
---
But the term Gen Rushing is more of a term in my mind too see how effective the survivors are with progressing the game.
---
I generally expect to lose at least my first two gens but I try to at least get a down before one pops cuz if not you basically lose. But yeah if your called a gen rusher, then your just playing smart.
---
(but...only way to "Toxic Gen Rush" is prove thyself plus 4 BNPs which then, your kinda an asshole bcuz your shortening the game to win easier)
---
It really is right now. When someone DCs I always let people farm before. It‚Äôs almost every game now though so I feel bad killing them when it‚Äôs not their fault but I can‚Äôt play the game otherwise right now it‚Äôs got so bad.
---
When your history teacher finds a Wikipedia citation in your essay
---
yes https://youtu.be/Sskva92TutE
---
I felt this way yesterday. I had to play as freddy for a daily. I just got him so I don't have anything good on him. I was tbagged and blinded at every pallet  and window vault. The match was over so quickly. Luckily I was able to get my daily done in that one match.
---
This is honestly not that bad
---
I did all legit nurse was help since I never used her before on console legion was also rough
---
Sorry, you'll always be a sadsuck
---
I hope they don't do a blanket ban and only target those that did it to grief.
---
To be fair as you said most of them were people that wanted to meme around. Very few did it to gain an unfair advantage.
---
I don't see why people that did it just to mess around before they issued this statement should be banned (considering most of them made the match enjoyable or even more fun for every survivor).
---
it looks like a standard youtuber gameplay video to me. at what time is it just the spirits and nothing else?
---
the killer ones i was trying to add in another meta like perk, so they are going to be quite strong. tracking splinter counters quick and quiet dance with me lithe combo, as well as improved mindgames at jungle jims. Hatred is balanced IMO, the obsession knows you have it so they can try to work around it.
---
i assume your talking about broken record, its a unique idea that relies on luck, if you get an early skill check you may as well miss the next one if you know your going to lose progress. and its a hex perk
---
Having the same problem..
---
Even worse, they try to save you when you're on your first hook, with 5gens done, exit gate super close but no one opens it.. so it's a volatile combo, down early or right on the end, I don't know what I prefer. Same case, have been rank 1 survivor, took a break, now rank 14 and feel like the gameplay has changed. Instead of the usual help each other, it's one for all...
---
Honestly I play both and i mainly have done adept survivors and tbh adept is kinda fun, being forced to play with something u may not normally use..kinda fun for me lel
---
Yes, don't get caught up in the details. It doesn't have to be named a syringe, it could be an adrenaline injection or whatever.
---
Feral.
---
Feral is the "animalistic" nature of the hit.
---
Not Will Ferrell, who thinks this bug escalated quickly. Things really got out of hand.
---
I don't usually do this, but this bugged me more than most.
---
Feel like tho only way I can play high rank is by playing plague and ruin so it can block those gens they spawn on and they take awhile to do gens though most ‚Äúpro‚Äù survivors just do the gens anyway and pray for not too many skill checks and if they do get a skill check go for great so they get no regression.
---
Try watching popular streamers/YouTube‚Äôs, you will learn slot of things, for killer I didn‚Äôt even think about waking backwards to hide the red stain, it works all the time for me now.
---
Kind of sounds like how Bungie was all into Destiny and said 'yeah guys we've got content planned for like 10 years or whatever' then after like three years later they release D2. And yeah it was probably a rumor; honestly after Plague I thought there wouldn't be any more Killers or Survivors and then I saw Ash get released and I was excited to see what his Killer was on the Wiki and instead was greeted with three more upcoming Killers, which made me very happy indeed.
---
Well that's one way to demolish your karma score
---
Why, thank you :)
---
For survivor focus on maximizing your chase time. Learn the map tiles, learn to do pallet loops and how to get from one safe spot to the next at least semi-reliably. 360‚Äôs can save you sometimes but it isn‚Äôt really full proof obv. If you aren‚Äôt being chased, gen rush. Also using meta perks (Borrowed time, Self Care, etc) is always good.
---
For killer hex ruin will be your best friend, as well as the 3 gen strat. Also make sure you think about what you would do as a survivor when chasing someone. Chase is really important, get them down and hooked asap. If someone‚Äôs just outplaying you and you can‚Äôt catch them, backoff and protect gens. 
---
Some games you‚Äôre just going to get facecamped first, or get absolutely pallet looped into oblivion though. Good luck!
---
Yeah ruin helps him a lot. Had a match yesterday on yamaoka estate. It was a 20 minute match because the survivors couldn't find the totem at all. I 4k'ed them with 4 gens left. The totem placement was awesome
---
Nurse on console... You, my good sir, are a real man and I salute you. ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
Alakh Bhar
---
Well instaheals still do exist and in my opinion resetting your exhaustion perk mid chase is similar to the second chance you get while using an instaheal on yourself, in a sense that it allows you to, for example, sprint burst away to another loop instead of taking another hit and getting that after hit speed boost. So all in all, doesn't sound that broken to me, but that's just my opinion.
---
Newborn human being.
---
this was me, still like playing them, still feel sorry for the people playing against me :(
---
D:
---
He does it in the 2003 version as well. He hooks the blonde dude who's leg he had just chopped off.
---
Mad respect. Anyone who takes the time to write in the end game chat, no matter how little or how much, gets a thumbs up from me. It's only polite :)))
---
I think at this point it's actually the opposite. Unless you're hanging around grey ranks it is mostly the survivors that impose the way the game is played. You can't chase what you can't find. Your hexes are useless if they're gone within a minute, etc.
---
Kyf. Have a friend who plays killer while you do survivor. Try and loop them, keep practising. One day it just clicks and you play better if that makes any sense
---
&gt;that's literally so childish and stupid for a serious game. why would the entity give people phones.. this is such a waste of time
---
In the Scream franchise the Ghostface killer is prone to calling its victims to taunt them and play games with them. His power would reference that. Otherwise Ghostface is just another killer with a knife.
---
XCOM 2 does not do that. It was just a meme on the XCOM Twitter.
---
Depiplol, sounds like a medicine
---
This month
---
I find it hard to kill people sometimes
---
too pure for this game
---
If you think this is bad then you should see an MW2 lobby in 2012. Grow up.
---
Do u even need ruin? I mean calm/order, distressing, overcharge, unnerving presence and pay ok last 3 gens until survivors DC. EZ
---
Fuck doctor
---
didn't say you were going to be banned for it, even if you did it would only be 24 hours. 
---
No way would you be banned if it was "only once". If what you said is true theres nothing to worry about.
---
you fucking ded spirit ! i mean‚Ä¶ again !
---
YOU CAN RUN, BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE, BITCH
---
Yeah now it's just two of us here on PS4 but it'll just be me during the summer bc my remaining PS4 friend is going to basic for the National Guard literally the entire summer aside from a week or two immediately after school, just enough time for us to go to our T√òP concert. So I guess it's a good thing I main Killer since Killers play alone :') But I'll also be hanging out with my PC friend irl since he got his truck a few months ago, so things aren't as bad as they could be!
---
This game needs help, not more killers.
---
Jason uses knifes, axes, machete, a kind of chainsaw in part 7, his own hands, spears, oof.
---
And hillbilly uses the same weapon as LF
---
all good lol. i just had a hard time watching the vid myself cause of his mug and the way they all talk like damn normies so i didn't want to look for the moment where they all just stand
---
Okay so the aura hiding is a little buggy. Distortion will consume tokens as long as it shows your aura. I have a theory that because nurses calling, object of obsession are old aura reading perks the, don't apply an "aura reading" debuff on you that can be blocked. Instead it is just a constant aura flickering. The game checks multiple times if you are still doing the action and keeps applying the aura debuff on you.
---
Object of obsession consumed distortion entirely before the match even starts and you can control your Character.
---
r/im14andthisiswooosh
---
I think the add-ons themselves are bugged. It's not that they just work too good.
---
so, I‚Äôm playing with my friends, they die, and I ask them to spectate the Dwight because I haven‚Äôt seen him the entire game and wanted to know if he was also doing a gen. It turns out he‚Äôs in a locker.. I go to his locker and make him come out, we run across the map so we can do a generator (so I thought) and he goes into another locker for legit no reason. I got annoyed, so I fast vaulted a few times and showed Doc where he is.
---
A reason to dc?
---
Here we go with salty survivors mass reporting Legion mains.
---
Too easy to wake up, 7 seconds to hit, no chase ability, and decreased visibility in the dream world.
---
Killers always get a slight headstart iirc, but this is clearly a little much.
---
Frank, nobody likes you mixtapes. Get over it.
---
Copy pasta
---
Because every player on console plays from the same city as you.
---
Now if only they'd ban the dude lag switching who admitted to it post game with footage I submitted almost 2 years ago...
---
My Biochemistry professor following the final last semester where about 20% of the class was caught cheating lol
---
What the actual fuck. You literally have just said, that black people are lower than anybody who is racist. You're unbelievable.
---
Issue isn't in ruin, "gen rush" or repair time nor should they tweak or increase it..., they need to change skillchecks themselves!
---
Let's be real you have small player population of new players that struggle with core game mechanics at rank 20 and 90% of player population that has 100s if not 1000s of hours under thier belt!
---
Just by playing for so long most of them can hit those Great skillcheks like it's nothing when you remove Ruin out of equation you get 5 generators poped withing few minutes of match starting 
---
To balance game and make it "harder" again they just need to tweak how skillcheks appear and look, change that a bit make it different and see generators exploding everywhere.
---
Now I see streamer poping Great skillcheks while listening to music and reading his chat...
---
There usually is--it's called Copyright--but it's certainly a harder thing to police on the internet.
---
Great work! Hope he is mad as hell üòä
---
Sure, after Sidney has to tell him the magical secret.
---
''Head Dewey. Shoot him in the head."
---
of course its a dwight
---
Another advantage of gen tapping is there's no repairing sound, so it can be clutch in those niche situations where the last gen is at like 95% and the killer is chasing another survivor around a loop right next to you, but will return to the generator if they know you're working on it/it's no longer sparking.
---
I honestly have no idea if you're trolling rn
---
not to mention one w an Xbox-generated username LMAO
---
Squat.
---
That's not how servers work, also OP. Crying about it on reddit. Weak sauce man
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs like really helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I never denied her skill. People were saying that she would‚Äôve won without DS. She wouldn‚Äôt have. Imma roll with your chess analogy for little bit. Let‚Äôs say black is gonna get checkmate in his next move, but white plays an Uno Skip card and gets his own checkmate. There is no denying that she would‚Äôve died without DS.
---
Unfortunately as I just picked dbd back up, I didn't have any killer teachables except docs, got him to level 40 and a few other killers a bit lower before I stopped playing. When I came back my first thought was to get ruin so I could play about every killer and now that I got it(Fuckin hate playin hag btw) its just so good sometimes. I do want to try the unnerving presence build but gotta get ruin on my trapper first
---
you can even see jane's thicc thighs because of the aura
---
It could definitely be that too, regardless the timing is nice :)
---
7 seconds for mindgaming with the dream transition. That's chase ability.
---
They have done an update recently to his world and i can see in it just fine now. 
---
And your only valid point is its too easy to wake up, he still gets tons of map awareness and pressure.
---
i had a 6000 h player,  moonwalk my borrowed time... with a Hillbilly last night x'D
---
Interesting tactic
---
Last time they helped the ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù population was when they had hook sabos, insta flashlights, infinites, pre-nerf DS, and more.
---
Id does
---
Yea if I had just seen someone start moving slightly before me I'd think it's a bug. The reason why this looks so weird is because he was clearly quite far away and seemed to know exactly where we were and just made a beeline there. All survivors were also grouped together unfortunately (nobody used the shroud of union though).   
---
Another suspicious thing about this match was that he knew where everyone was at all times. I just assumed he had BBQ and chilli but he literally didn't have any aura reading perks. At one point another surv and I were nowhere near a gen in a totally random place and he came right for us. The whole match seemed really suspect. Added to the fact the Legion was actually really bad and missed a tonne of hits made me think they were hacking/ exploiting in some way.
---
Reported. Enjoy your ban, kid.
---
Feng vs jane?
---
Why are memes toxic?
---
Yes
---
Well it was fun while it lasted. Goodbye double killer glitch.
---
are you rank 19?
---
He‚Äôs not lying. I have 200 auric cells now.
---
The thing about that is, when I'd go up against red ranks before the changes, they'd never go through gens this quickly with Ruin on.
---

Honestly this could be an event. Like the Entity is getting weaker/stronger and the Trial itself is experiencing whatever the Entity is.
---
Dickhead alert
---
I did the 2+ killers one time with friends. Will I get banned for a 1-time offense?
---
End game collapse will probably be a feature that prevents the survivors from holding the game hostage, and prevent hatch standoffs. It will likely make the game speed up. Ruin could be even more desireable
---
Usually when I‚Äôm in that situation I just send memes. It came to the point where my friends were sending their ugly custom fifa characters to this guy and I was sending a picture of fries banana from a trip. The guy didn‚Äôt know what to say
---
Two words:
---
Entity‚Äôs Steroids
---
And again, Survivors do not need to work faster. Given the gen rush they can complete the game in as little as 3 minutes. Dying Light is a very difficult perk to rework, especially given that it alone could take all of that time, maybe twice that, to work.
---
&gt;That's not how servers work, also OP. Crying about it on reddit. Weak sauce man
---
DBD doesn't have servers.
---
Hayato
---
They are doing both, they are working on fixing the bug and banning the abusers.
---
They aren't only abusing add ons, they are abusing a bug with those add ons.
---
BITES ZA DUSTO
---
So alls I have to do is kill a whole bunch of people, get summoned, and I can finally break 5 foot?
---
You get the *Hag Treatment*
---
Hag didn't, I don't think
---
They've said the reason for removing it, these things are supposed to be posted in the dedicated bug threads.
---
Hag just has bad posture so I would be fine with it. Hope I can cover up though.
---
Had the same thing happen to me. This dude and I were the only ones left and we had two generators, I‚Äôm there still trying to work on one to get us out of there. My friend is dead so she decides to see where tf our Adam is since he disappeared after getting everyone else killed, he‚Äôs in the basement locker just chilling. Killer finds me so I run into the basement, make sure the killer is there and open up the locker he‚Äôs in. We both get hooked but it was worth it, he was a horrible teammate the whole game.
---
I'm another potato XD
---
If you're on PC, feel free to pm me for my ign and add me on steam so we can  1v1 for practice.
---
**But that spine tho**
---
Praise the entity.
---
Nah man, Hag just has a bad back. I got great posture do I would be like 6 foot.
---
As a survivor, run DS &amp; Unbreakable combo to counter sweaty killers. Borrowed Time is a 'must have' for me to prolong the survival of my team. Early stages, you can run Sprint Burst until you feel comfortable. For me, rank isn't important. I go for bloodpoint gains. This is a casual game, being competitive can wear you down emotionally, but it's up to you. - Meg
---
Is this Tom or Yoshikage Kira?
---
Better not go walk in a Forest.
---
Maybe this is the legion rework. Completely removing legion and replacing him with ghostface
---
I think Doc was more pleasantly surprised than anything.
---
Wouldn't you say that insta heals + insta exhaustion would be a little op?
---
It's brilliant! The community will lov- W-Wait why aren't you guys happy?
---
What? Then how to do you connect to online?
---
Showing the Aura for 9 seconds is waaaaay too long, even BBQ only does it for 4 seconds and you have to be 40 meters away, Hatred only around 20....
---
And Broken Record? Combine that with Lullaby+Ruin and Toth and you will never see a gen get done.
---
If I just get hit by enough pallets I can move it back into place.
---
I don't care when it drops. Prepared for disappointment already.
---
What boost are you talking about, it‚Äôs not slower if only one person is working on it.
---
this is the bhvr standard that we've all learned to tolerate. it's been this way for years now.
---
not saying it's how it should be handled, but they're not the brightest at dealing with exploits in their game
---
I have spirit and I really like her. Once you get used to her phasewalk shes a lot of fun. My favorite killer so far thought is bubba. I love bbq and chili mainly for the blood point boost. I rarely play killer tho because I usually have at least one friend that wants to play.
---
I'm already tall. I'd probably be taller than Plague given some Entity 'roids.
---
Not that bad, you learned your lesson for staying to close to the window.
---
Because you still punish people who are crashing? You didn't give a counter argument, you just showed an example where that situation happens.
---
If you visit LoL forums and subreddits you'll see tons of posts from people complaining about getting punishments despite it not being their fault the game crashed/didn't connect. It is a big issue there, as client stability is really bad.
---
Lol has a stable and working client, dbd does not. You can't compare a working game with a broken one Einstein.

---
It's not a fun glitch if it keeps happening to you, I've had like 4 of those this weekend and after the first one they became really annoying. 
---
&gt;but if you DC every single match that's fine
---
No, if you reach certain % of disconnects you'll get banned. Read the terms of service.
---
Abusing known exploits is bannable, that's nothing new.
---
Just play normally, dude. You're bound to get it eventually.
---
No, don't use add ons that are bugged. 
---
You won't get punished for playing Legion otherwise.
---
same. I don't even flinch if I see ruin anymore, I just keep repairing gens instead of wasting time looking for the totem. Super useful skill to have.
---
\*Gets T3\*  
---
That is the scariest fucking thing I have seen in my entire life
---
I had a match once where I didn't do very well and one survivor messaged a nice "EZ baby killer" something or other and I just replied "GG". He was like "Wow, you're not mad?" I said "No, I know I could've done a lot better." He agreed and then gave me some gameplay tips. 
---
Idk. People are weird sometimes. /shrug
---
They are already doing that. If your total number of DCs is a certain % of your total dcs (its not a publicly known number but I'd bet around 40%) then you get auto banned.
---
So if you DC at &gt;ridiculously high rates
---
you get banned.
---
That‚Äôs understandable I suppose.  The way I usually see it is that he‚Äôs so fed up with the trolling and shit talking he just doesn‚Äôt care about how he sounds sometimes.
---
I‚Äôll agree with being kinda arrogant because he definitely can be but when you‚Äôve proven your skill on a game time and time again and people still come into your chat and tell you you‚Äôre barely above average or whatever they like to say I‚Äôm sure it can be annoying which is possibly why he gets a big head about it sometimes.
---
As long as you don‚Äôt play comp. OW comp is incredibly toxic. I stick to QP and the Arcade most of the time.
---
I showed an example where it is effectively used while people aren't straight up banned for it. This avoids people "bypassing" the punishment by simulating a DC or a crash but also gives a punishment that's "light enough" to not cause harm to the innocent. (waiting is annoying but it doesn't make you lose your account)
---
Then you haven't played survivor too much. I see tons of killers DC-ing when losing, when their ruin/other hex totem gets destroyed fast, when they get a bad map, etc.
---
Or that you're close by hiding somewhere in his radius.
---
This is funny and all, until you realised that dedicated servers are going to be released very soon and the devs have acknowledged the bugs and have stated they‚Äôre going to fix them and when you use your brain you realise that buying paid DLC helps fund development of the game, which then helps them fix bugs.
---
This is the wholesome content I want more of from the DbD community.
---
I got huge respect for people who think his power is a good mechanic. I think it is too, what you said about gens is literally the only problem. His mind games during the dream transition are amazing if you know how to do it. Pretty much free hit and if you lose em you have auras till they wake up. Fixes are coming so we'll see what happens. BHVR has been doing pretty well with balance lately (my opinion plz don't hate me) so i think they have something really good cooked up for freddy. We'll see
---
This mindset is why you wont ever be satisfied, no matter what they give us
---
True but ya know at least other killers can if they want to. Frederick doesn't get an option
---
The 2 killers bug can't be done on accident, you need to work with a paired survivor to do it and it takes like 10 steps to do it.
---
Mettle of men bug in most games won't be happening, as you only have 1/13 chance to run into a really unpopular killer. So it can never be intentional unless you somehow know that you are against a Freddy.
---
Double blades bug can be used every game and they can just ban those that have been spamming games with them.
---
Dude, go play killer for a few hundred games in red ranks, then come back to me
---
I've gotten better by watching streamers. I mainly play survivor but watching killer and survivor mains helps greatly. Watch good survivors loop killers and how they do it. You won't be as good as them at first but it's a start. When I had enough of the sneaking around I ran Bond a lot to see where my teammates are at and if they were being chased. Empathy works but I prefer Bond. If I'm on a generator and hear the heartbeat and my teammate is running around I can stay on the gen unless they get really close.
---
Also for the love of God practice getting great skill checks so you can push through Ruin, or if the match is taking too long Gen tap. The longer the match, the better chance the killer will get you. 
---
When you watch killers some of them commentate their game play in why they do certain things.
---
NOED on powerful killers, Nurse mains with ruin, hook save into adrenaline into escape, key escapes, legions mend exploit. Did I cover all of the controversial topics?
---
It doesn't matter if they report the Legion player if they aren't abusing the bug.
---
You won't get banned if you aren't abusing the bug, the report will not affect you. So why does it matter if they do report people who aren't using the bug if the report won't do anything?
---
It is!! I just realized that when I uploaded the video.
---
So... You have a knife?
---
You lose pips. Lots of people dc to intentionally lose pips and derank
---
Or to the wall even, that hit went through everything lmao
---
And in the other half too not gonna lie
---
I usually do this when i see they‚Äôre being chased by the killer and they attempt the save just to farm. it‚Äôs what they deserve ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
These sound terrible. I‚Äôm sorry
---
There‚Äôs no uno card in a chess game here. We‚Äôre all playing the same game, just in different positions. There are killers and there are survivors, and they have different powers.
---
I get that part but usually I run bond or empathy so I know how close they are if they get hit then I leave the gate area also never know when I can get hit buy something random
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking üòÇ
---
&gt;No, I guarantee you it's all the time a different nurse but with the same level and the same ping lmao. I live in the EU yet I often fall with Japanese
---
Buddy, you can't guarantee anything. The only people that will get the **same ping** to this Nurse, are people living near you. Your title addresses console players in general, as if people from NA or any other part of the world would see a low ping and get this same nurse.
---
Hes wasting so much time. Break the pallet and move on.
---
Why do people assume that the entity only takes people who died when is that is clearly not the case? Kate, Laurie, Quentin, Ash were all healthy and alive when they were kidnapped.
---
Easiest upvote of the day.
---
I‚Äôll revise my build if there‚Äôs a huge change! Until then it comes into play too much for me at the moment.
---
At his third hook? Sure.
---
I've already reported two different exploiting Legions yesterday. One of them even tried to justify it by saying "at least I didn't use the purple blade too" as if that somehow makes it better.
---
Perhaps a new survivor
---
Another reason I don‚Äôt take it off unless I‚Äôm playing SWF or using a specific build: every time I bring in a medkit instead... Surprise, it‚Äôs Franklin‚Äôs Demise!
---
r/Isweartogodifsomekidsayswoooosh
---
1. It's still Dying Light because you have to sacrifice one survivor but it is not limited to the obsession. It's a tunneling perk and like devs said, they will rework Dying Light to avoid tunneling.
---
2. It's bad.
---
3. They basically can't do generators. Moreover, 15 seconds is too much. We have Discordance that is really strong, imagine being able to see **not the aura of the generator but the survivor** and for 15 seconds. It would be too much.
---
4. I only play Jake.
---
I'm glad you can escape through hatch for those rough games
---
Yeah I had this conversation with a friend who I introduced to the game. 
---
He made the same point as you where if you've got the skill you can afford to be arrogant. He's got worse recently though and I personally just can't stand it so don't watch.
---
I feel him when he gets annoyed at toxic behavior and trolling etc but there's a line that he's been crossing recently. 
---
Again nothing against Tru3 himself, just not my cup of tea anymore. Would still recommend to new players starting the game though.
---
how often would these skill checks have to come and in my opinion that wont do anything good except make the gates open faster
---
Killers are faster in general but survivors have some advantages as well like being able to fast vault windows and slide over pallets which killers can not do and when they do break a pallet or go through a window it gives you some space since they do that slowly (unless they run certain perks) so when you are being chased definitely try to have a plan and know where you are running too. If you just run in a straight line out in the open of course the killer will catch you so you have to learn the maps and jungle gyms so you can use them efficiently.  
---
After awhile of trying to play a solo game survivors will learn how to work together more, of course sometimes you get potatoes but for the most part once you get into the higher ranks you have better teammates. Also in 10-15 range you have a lot of deranked killers who run the best perks just to have an advantage and play against newer players so the numbers are skewed some since it‚Äôs not a real setting of equally skilled and prepared players, some survivors do this as well so you have fully decked out swf groups going against a new killer
---
I think they changed it recently to combat deranking
---
‚ÄúWife Beater‚Äù beat down and steal another survivors health state Instantly to restore your own.
---
I‚Äôm surprised Jane‚Äôs disappearance didn‚Äôt cause more controversy seeing as she‚Äôs Oprah Winfrey, basically.
---
I had the same thing happen a few months ago. I was the last one left with a Claudette and I had aftercare so I could always see her. There were 2 gens left and I kept trying to do them while running from the nurse. The whole time the Claud was hiding in this weird spot in the corner of the map, going in and out of a locker. Eventually the nurse downed me and through some weird communication with nodding we got going she signalled to me she wanted to know where the Claudette was. I took her to the Claudette who was - surprise surprise, camped near the hatch. Nurse pulled her out the locker then gave me the hatch.
---
It was literally over 20 minutes she waited by the hatch. She could have even done a gen while I was getting chased but she just wanted to wait for me to die. Afterwards the Claud threatened to report both me and the Nurse rofl. I've also done the same thing as killer, funnily another to another Claudette who was waiting for her team mate to die. The Nea was trying to do gens and the Claud was afk hiding in a bush. I eventually found her because she got crows and gave the Nea hatch. Fuck useless teammates.
---
I‚Äôm knew to the game (1 week of playing, but I‚Äôm already addicted). But what happened to me yesterday, me and my teammate were working on gen, she was gen tapping and I wasn‚Äôt. IDK if this happens everytime but I got no skill checks while she was gen tapping (and the killer had ruin ofc). Just a (possible) tip
---
I think it would have had the same effect
---
Nah. If you are just a normal dude you get the legion deal. You can run a bit faster for a few seconds but get a short but painful migraine attack.
---
Hmm, I don‚Äôt know. He didn‚Äôt really leave hooked survivors and tunnelled them off the hook, then slugged everyone who tried to help them. I was a slug while he found the last person, I just happened to crawl near the hatch.
---
yeah that guy was a dickhead sitting in a locker the whole game
---
You‚Äôre just jealous of my scratchy ambience Joe!
---
Same, I‚Äôm not usually this lucky! I was spamming LB so hard.
---
A buddy and myself just started playing, (I bought the game near the original release long before dlc but never had anyone to play with so I didn't)
---
One of the biggest things I see is the toxic survivor community, not a lot of them, but hell they are vocal.
---
I had one match where the killer only got one player, and the dude just kept calling the killer trash for just getting them. 
---
I honestly only came back for Ash, and I'm glad I did. I'm a huge fan of f13th game and I wish I had been playing this too.
---
Those bloodpoints though
---
Leaked endgame collapse footage
---
I play Ash, so I couldn't do this if I wanted too.
---
It's the PSN messenger app
---
I hadn‚Äôt used it until this point in the match! That was my first hook. I wasn‚Äôt immersed or anything, I was just unhooking and doing generators. I know the reasons people think Self Care bad and I do agree. However, I‚Äôve run into too many situations where I needed it and didn‚Äôt have it. Now I always have it. Mostly just use it if I‚Äôm the last one left because I know other survivors heals are faster and give them points.
---
I hope they drop one piece of info today like maybe the legion blogpost, and the end game video on Thursday.
---
I'm a newish player, and the pig always makes me jump when she comes around the corner, crouch running.
---
We do not have any plans to change adrenaline at this time. I'm not sure which blog posts you are referring to.
---
You are going to get banned until they fix it I think? It's not a perm for sure
---
Myers is just huge in his own canon
---
If you've played for long enough, you can DC hundreds of games in a row and never be banned.
---
Praise the all maker, I‚Äôll go on and take this down to not perpetuate the cycle of misinformation.
---
It's funny how he feels guilty for being an asshole to you, when you responded with bubbly cheer. But apparently it's ok to be a shit if you piss someone off and clearly ruin their mood.
---
same without ruin
---
Always, I get hit through pallets more often then not. They changed the pallet drop in an update I'm pretty sure and now its delayed. ..
---
It‚Äôs not his
---

---
Idk legion is annoying because 1v1 he has the final say in when u go down, there is no counter. But he also suffers from no map pressure. He‚Äôs a tunnel machine. And it‚Äôs strange because it seems the idea was to have him be an anti-tunneler with killer instinct letting him run around and tag different targets, but the idea behind it just completely failed what they had in mind.  If there was some way to reward them going after different targets during killer instinct while also making it harder to straight tunnel someone down, he could be more enjoyable.
---
Don't listen to them, you're beautiful Susie
---
The game does need help but I would still like new killers with new fixes
---
How about banning the people who dc?!?!
---
Those are the real community cancer.
---
6*
---
DR reduces by 25% so M&amp;A brings it to 8 and then 2 gets removed
---
Child‚Äôs play might work because of the new movie coming out
---
Is that guys username seanboy
---
Idk why it happens, but legit every time I go to play my first survivor game of the day, I get an infinite loading screen. I never get it as killer though
---
You keep going back to pallet loops as your point of argument...and i must ask...are you aware that there are things that exist in the game to counter the very thing you complain about? If pallets are a problem, you can run enduring and spirit fury and swing through every pallet. Commit to a chase and don‚Äôt double back, and the pallet should be down by the second loop. You do realize killers run 15% faster than survivors right? Most maps have an average of 10-12 pallets now (some have more, up to 15, i know) but on average, you could get rid of them fairly quick if again, you know how to push a survivor into doing so. Windows are a problem? There‚Äôs bamboozle. Unlike survivors, killers have more options when creating builds that compliment their power and killers who truly optimize that will always excel. Other killers also commit to chases too long. If a chase lasts more than 20 seconds without me landing a hit, i try to move on. Thats 1/4th of a gen all the other survivors have completed in the time without ruin.
---
That‚Äôs dumb. If this was a glitch people were exploiting I could understand the banning but to ban people because players are using two addons the devs put in the game is just dumb. Either remove one of the addons or nerf them, but don‚Äôt punish the players for the fault of the devs.
---
Says the guy who uses noed on myers...  stay classy killer mains...
---
I mean like best your would get is a mask for trapper
---
Aww, thank you! I'm glad you like it!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Its not hard to get to that rank, i managed to go to rank 12 after 20 hours or so. He might have just got carried by team mates.
---
&gt;I did report for being unsportsmanlike but what do I do with the footage now?
---
[Official Dead by Daylight Help Center](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)
---
No idea then.
---
Why
---
It‚Äôs not that it sounds fake. You just come off like a jerk. You got outplayed by a good group of survivors then bmed them and are crowing about how it felt good. Weirdo stuff.
---
But you still end up punishing innocent people. 
---
The game is too unstable to introduce that system.
---
Oh no my friend I believe every word of it.  Bad killers relying on NOED to crutch out the downs they were incapable of earlier is the most believable thing I could hear.  I see it daily in game lol.  You can tell 90% of the time the killer has it by how poorly they chase midgame.  I just think it's quite sad your most satisfying game involves bm'ing and forced farming killers to death after only being capable of getting them period from the biggest crutch in game lol.  My most satisfying games involve times as a killer where I played my ass off and play a very strong game against a great team but your way is another route to go too lol.
---
I thought it'd be cool if he'd spawn in as a random survivor and would have to equip the ghostface outfit to actually damage them. So you could go up to a random survivor and start working on a gen with them (fake working) and then disappear behind a tree or something and pop back out as ghostface to hit them.
---
Incompetence.
---
I know there's no use since you have nothing to say :)
---
Was this on Xbox? I might have been one of those survivors!
---
Yea I remember they changed it quite a while ago but it seems to be worse recently. I am even finding if I do finally drop the pallet the killer has got to my side of the pallet, been stunned and I need to vault back over the pallet.
---
So, for using 2 in-game addons, the players are being punished for using them because the devs haven't applied a hotfix or at least temporarily disabling them thus rendering them unusable for the time being is a justified response to those players? What about the players that don‚Äôt frequently browse forums etc and aren‚Äôt aware that these implemented in-game items are abeing considered a ‚Äúbug‚Äù, just ban them too right?
---
Aww, thanks!
---
Thank you so much. &lt;3
---
Then you have still played out more games normally than you have DCd. The system is working well in that case.
---
That's just the same as someone playing casually, but with increased numbers. Either way, whoever we are talking about played out substantially more games normally than they have DCd. 
---
They are in the clear.
---
...how did players somehow make the most unfun killer even worse.... the talent...my god.
---
Do you got problems in seeing red or differences between some colors? 
---
Maybe it would help if someone plays a " kill your friends " match with you, with you as the killer and him running around you so you can sprach for scratch marks and try to develop a way to recognize(?) them.
---
Sounds like I may have to main Legion then.... They're still effective if you don't apply deepwounds right?
---
It isn't ironic, but it does serve to show how survivors tend to place fault.
---
obligatory r/dbdgonewild
---
I just find getting kills with the rbts to be satisfying, but yeah you're right. It was a dick move.
---
Yes it was on Xbox. The survivors were two Claudettes, a prestige Dwight and a Jane, I think
---
That sounds brilliant! 
---
...Wait just a god damn secon- I've been had.
---
Yes and he is making money because of people watching and imo that is supporting him.
---
And I sorry but I get angry because of pedo‚Äôs.
---
Negan wouldn't make a good killer though, he thinks of people as resources and wouldn't like just killing them, now the whispers could work
---
*I was being a bit of a dick
---
However you have to agree that theres a difference between actively giving him money and watching his vids for entertainment
---
Ah no not a Jane. It was a Meg. I downed her last and showed her the totem
---
I think I missed something, what did he do? (Sorry I was never a big fan of him the only movies I watched were he has a role was pirates of the Caribbean)
---
It‚Äôs more that we get payback for getting screwed over in uno or is that just me and my friends?
---
That may be neat but only if it's Ghostfaces power, a perk no. But it'd also be way unbalanced because survivors need third person to make sure the killer isn't creeping up on them, ninja Myers becomes ninja ghostface
---
Which you'd think would be an easy fix, just tweak the numbers/way they function and push out the patch.
---
Until you realize that patching games on Consoles requires fucking approval and has all this red-tape nonsense attached to it and can take weeks.
---
Just depends on how you like to play I'd say play them all and then find the ones you like the most and start leveling them up. I used a double blood point week and leveled them all to 40... so I could have all their teachables.
---
Many survivors are very salty. I guess they must feel powerless trying to escape the killer and that gets them angry.
---
Why? Legion and Pig are just people same as Ghostface
---
No, OG Myers is only about 5'10, he's only a little taller than Quentin and Laurie who are 5'8 and 5'7. In fact, Tapp is actually taller because Danny Glover is 6'4"
---
But... there is no yellow blade addon
---
Yeah getting on objects and holding the game hostage not juts using addons instead of fixing them
---
Amanda can just get over it
---
Amanda will remember that
---
It's said that till this day the Hillbilly is still out there chasing that Jake.
---
I do this too! I usually only do it if I know for a fact that they haven‚Äôt done anything that game while me and the other 2 people I usually play with do everything. I hate randoms on this game sometimes. I‚Äôm also really shocked the doc didn‚Äôt keep after you too ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
maybe try running bloodhound see if that makes a difference for you? i had problems with it at first but they‚Äôre easy to catch now. maps can make it easier/harder as well.
---
It's weird, but Freddy straight thrashes low a mid rank survivors. Pretty sure a Freddy took the xbox side of the DbD tournament even. His play style is certainly underestimated.
---
If you post it after people forget about it you get a lot more karma since it‚Äôs gonna be funny again however if posted it on the same day you wouldn‚Äôt get any karma from it since people would just call you for stealing it I really don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs to hard to comprehend here. 
---
‚ÄúIf I saw it, I most likely would‚Äôve commented something like ‚ÄòI play Leatherface‚Äô‚Äù so you‚Äôre telling me you comment on everything you see? Or what are you trying to say here? That you didn‚Äôt see it event tho it reached 2k upvotes and you commented something on this sub the same day meaning you probably saw it as the first thing under the pinned messages. 
---
At least thedankdwight had the guts to admit he was in the wrong. You just want to try to deny it. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going anywhere with this since you don‚Äôt seem to won‚Äôt admit and try to change the conversation. I won‚Äôt be responding to anymore of these until you actually come up with something better besides ‚Äúyour logic isn‚Äôt making sense‚Äù or ‚Äúl didn‚Äôt see it since I didn‚Äôt comment on it‚Äù.
---
According to his wife he was very abusive towards her, mentally and physically. BUT in all seriousness I don‚Äôt believe her, she probably just wanted money.
---
Some people are weirdly obsessed with escaping and lose sight of the fun of team work. Even if you die it's better to die a hero than live to be a hatch coward ahaha.
---
We actually had a guy in our DBD discord server that played this way. every. damn. game. He'd stealth around doing gens and nearly every game when there was a precarious situation he'd say "OK I'm going to look for the hatch" or "Should I just go for the hatch... or... should I come get you?" He just always wanted to live. One of the worst was when there was three of us left, I was on the hook and someone was getting chased and he said "It looks bad, should I go for the hatch or get you?" I couldn't believe it and it was the one time I shouted at him lmao. Worst of all whenever he asked "Should I go for the hatch... or get you?" It was ALWAYS a rhetorical question. Like he just wanted us to say "yes, of course go look for the hatch while I'm getting chased instead of just doing the last gen!"
---
I meant as Survivor.
---
There is already totems in order to avoid NOED, but survivors are bitching that they have to do something else than gens.
---
Honestly I have less of a problem here with it as I do with instagram, holy shit I have told people so many times not to repost my work and I get outright ignored with people tagging me in it, meaning they've seen me say not to do it and do it anyway lol
---
I've got to add as well I used to play with a new to the game friend as a high rank (2) whilst he was a 20. Without fail we would end up in matches with low ranked killers and survivors so I stood out like a sore thumb and it showed when playing the game because low rank killers just don't have the gameplay or time in to cope with a higher ranked survivor.
---
I think that has to be looked at too because I understand there has to be a middle ground between us but middle ground be like rank 10 not rank 15-19. Like I noticed it would always be at those ranks until my friend hit rank 15 then we were getting matched with killer 10-13.
---
I think they've said they're only temp-bans and I assume they might be checking to see whether or not a player is intentionally abusing it. 
---
Lets say we have 2 cases, Dickface and Little Johnny:
---
Dickface goes into every Killer match as Legion with both blade addons equipped. Little Johnny goes into his Killer matches as Legion (because he just bought him and thinks he looks really fun and cool!) and is trying out different addons every time, and maybe finds after a dozen or so matches that he likes a cooldown reduction addon, and filthy blade.
---
During the match, Dickface hits people with his double blade addons and then just runs away, leaving them to helplessly mend for exactly 15 years. Little Johnny on the other hand, hits people with his power, and then continues his chases, trying to down the Survivors he's hit, maybe occasionally breaking chase to hit someone else because they showed up on Killer Instinct.
---
Obviously one of these players is intentionally exploiting the bug, while the other is just a random player who thinks Legion is really cool and fun. HOPEFULLY BHVR can distinguish between these two players, and only bans one of them. Hopefully.
---
My guess is that they made Killers really tall to look more menacing.
---
This is why I dip out when doing my daily survivor task and a Dwight is on the lobby.
---
Many of them are cunts and selfish. They'll hide or refuse to do any saving even after you saved their ungrateful ass. They're also the first to get out the minute someone got hooked after all gens are powered.
---
When I resume my killer duties, these douchebags are my main targets.
---
Oof my bad, twas thinking about the yellow ruler that I never use, in my mind it was blade lolz
---
The devs knew this so they created the ability to Mori survivors
---
As a killer main, I'd like to put her on my diet. All these scrawny sausages running around, I could use a thicc snak
---
Suppose when you define Surviving == Win and Dying == Lose, some people will be like that. 
---
For me, Dying so someone else, even one, can escape == Win. Not having fun == Lose
---
If he didn‚Äôt DC though, you might not have got the hatch to open before he died on the hook. So in a fit of rage, he ended up helping you out!
---
Instant DC I think so
---
I don‚Äôt even understand how this happens. Why were all of you down there?
---
with the newer pip system? odds are pretty slim
---
I think I‚Äôm like one of the only people who is not rude to people like I never tbag or flick my light or tbag at a exit because they didn‚Äôt kill anyone or whatever. I don‚Äôt message people to be rude nun of that i only tbag when the killer is being a tunneling face camper then he deserves it face camping with 5 gens up okay :| I‚Äôll twerk at you then -.- also if they start cheating I might message to be rude in a kind way üòä but other than that nopeee or if it‚Äôs a michael I mess with killers and I‚Äôll message some of them the whole game just to bother em c: i love Michael üíï
---
Then when you get hit with noed and nobody comes and saves you it's your own damn fault... it takes 15 seconds, 600 bloodpoints, avoid noed seems legit to me..
---
It's just a Dwight doing Dwight why so rude ?
---
I don‚Äôt have bbq ‚òπÔ∏è
---
The hatch endgame is so stupid! Let‚Äôs reward a swf team that got beat by giving one of them a freebie as it wasn‚Äôt hard enough to pip. Doc deserved a 4 man at that point.
---
I can't believe killers still do this trash. If it was me, if afk and then watch some YouTube :p
---
Jesus Christ that‚Äôs scary looking!

Still works on PS45
---
"Believe all Women" : When in put into the injured state lose half of your blood points for the match.
---
wow, how in the world did that happen??
---
This is how I feel when someone cheats on dbd or tunnels for nothing and face camps with 5 gens up :|
---
This is not true on PS4. It used to be. But you do lose them now
---
wow, I've tried to use this art style for a while and I've never been able to master it. Any tips on how to draw with that style?
---
People are giving people doing this way too much lenience. People are not doing it completely unknowingly if people are literally running black wards and purposefully not hooking anyone and just hitting them over and over to make the timer go as long as possible
---
Why do they want to remove instaheals? Survivors have nothing when it comes to ultrarare addons... 
---
If they remove instaheals they better remove ebony moris and bloodlust..
---
I main both üòäüò≠ but I play jane more now
---
Maybe some [mild color blindness](https://www.colour-blindness.com/colour-blindness-tests/ishihara-colour-test-plates/)? You can click the pictures to see the numbers (or lines) and some info about each. 
---
There's Bloodhound (Wraith level 35 perk), which increases the visibility of blood pools (once you hit a survivor they leave them behind them), and there's Predator (Wraith level 30 perk) which puts the scratch marks closer together, so you see more at once.
---
For aesthetic reasons or hiding?
---
This game gets people heated more than any other game I've played
---
Because I play Feng cuz she is so small and quiet
---
I agree that they could have gone with disabling the add ons (idk if they've ever done that before so I dunno if they can), but if they are choosing to ban people for abusing exploits, I don't see the issue. It's a common practice to ban those that have exploited the game.
---
The devs can look at match history of reported players to see if they for example randomly started spamming legion games with those add ons while not touching Legion before, or only playing with those add ons. They can also use post-game chat logs to determine if the user was aware of the bug. It's not that hard to check.
---
Drugs sometimes make people act in ways they don't normally, I hope that she is lying, and he's a good person. At the same time we should never assume someone is lying about something so serious :/ it's a shitty situation
---
That perk build tho. Whispers 1, Insidious, aannnnddd Noed on Myers. Stay classy killer mains.
---
I saw this on a Resident Evil 2 DLC where you can unlock all the extra modes.
---
Didn't know it came from a game journalist.
---
They habe to be tall, or they couldn't keep up with survivors by just walking :p
---
Just my own reasons Jane looks like me out of every other survivor so I play her more than others also jane has my perks also feng can be really loud just as jane can and I have iron will on jane they won‚Äôt give me iron will in my
---
Bloodweb for feng so I edged away from her because feng is actually really loud tbh and I‚Äôve noticed that playing killer.
---
Omae wa mo Shindeiru
---
Hmm, didn't know. Thanks :)
---
I love my feng she has 3/4 of my perks that I run on jane and i play her Sometimes but not all the time.
---
Yes let us extend m1 simulator even longer.
---
2 people hooked and I went to save. Fourth guy disconnected
---
Dude imo Feng is like one of the most quiet survivors
---
Asymmetrical doesnt mean unbalanced. its supposed to be balanced. Its just the teams that have different numbers.
---
So now he is a 110 killer with no ability to actually down?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjjkHg5FOhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjjkHg5FOhk)
---
&gt;This is not true on PS4. It used to be. But you do lose them now
---
Half true, then. On PC you keep your pips if you hit Leave Game.
---
Out of some people yeah but she can still be loud to and I like iron will üò≠
---
no anymore, theyve just banned it, anticheat rejects it now fml
---
Suppose I‚Äôm blinded by fandom, same with Micheal.
---
And similar shoes, pants, and boxing wraps + fake blood for the bandages, my good sir! :)
---
Iron will is great but I don't use it anymore because m1 killers are so rare these days
---
Yea I'm definitely the same. I'd rather die trying to save someone most of the time, or die for them,  because the rare times you both escape is worth it.
---
Then buff him somewhere else, I only suggested a way for his power to not be abusable anymore
---
I have to run it on jane there is no way üòÇüòÇ but yeah I like to be quiet most of the time because usually I‚Äôm getting tunneled and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hurt so I don‚Äôt wanna be caught again.
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt even understand how this happens. Why were all of you down there?
---
Doesn't matter what survivors were doing in the basement. Killers shouldn't be douchebags and ruin someone else's game like this.
---
Thankfully this is bannable on PC, don't know about consoles.
---
I've had many games with only 2 people left where one gets chased and the other does the gens. Just last night I had a game where I managed to finish 3 gens while the other guy was being chased, sadly he got caught and willingly sacrificed himself *RIP Dweet*. Of course if the survivors are playing immersed it's going to be impossible to finish the gens unless someone is willing to take and keep the aggro of the killer.
---
I want BBQ soooo bad but I know it's probably not going to show up in the Shrine any time soon so I may just have to get him and power level him like I did with the Nurse. I usually play Killer because I find it more fun personally and I'm better at it (probably why I find it more fun lol).
---
Forget everything you thought you learnt in school, just personify dogshit incarnate.
---
Honestly, it can be said about any killer. Billy while revving his saw, Leatherface with the chainsaw ready. Pig with her traps as well. Huntress holding hatchets. Nurse within the blink distance. Plague with AOE corrupt purge chilling around the hook. 
---
It's all about the player who plays the killer, not the killer itself. Hag just gets a bad reputation, sadly. Same as Leatherface. And to be fair I've seen great Hags and Leatherfaces who stomped the whole team and never needed not even to camp, but to tunnel.
---
You're welcome! Just trying to help out a new player the best I can ^_^
---
I think the better mentality is expecting nothing so you get pleasantly surprised when you do get something.
---
Well if you are running a sneaky setup that make sense but a good killer will always follow the blood :/
---
It‚Äôs funny, because he never actually beat his wife
---
Because in literally every other game they'd just disable a character from being played online, if there was an exploit they couldn't fix immediately. That's just dumb banning people for it, i.e it'd be like banning players for playing "x champion because their dead body would still contest the objective in paladins", when you should just disable the character until you can get a hotfix in like just about everybody else in the game industry.

Bloodhound is for blood

I understand that, it‚Äôs the simple fact that I did not, again I did not see the meme. Okay? I don‚Äôt understand why me commenting on a different post the same day guarantees that I‚Äôd have seen the other post.

I sort by new, so no I didn‚Äôt see it for the millionth time. If I had seen it, I don‚Äôt have outstanding memory. I do not comment on everything I see, I‚Äôm just saying it would be likely I commented on it because the post makes a meme focusing on a popular player decision, when I do not make that player decision. ‚ÄúI probably saw it as the first thing under pinned messages.‚Äù So I see we‚Äôre just going to make assumptions just to try proving me wrong now, okay, that‚Äôs great. If you have a speck of maturity (which I highly doubt, considering you‚Äôve already made false accusations about me because of a meme on the internet) you‚Äôre going to have to just take my word for it, which I know may be hard for you.

---
He states that he didn‚Äôt see the meme and neither did I. We both had the same idea. No, he is not in the wrong. With your way of thinking, if there was a Legion meme posted on this sub, then anyone else who posted a different Legion meme after it, is remaking a meme for karma and they have to have seen the first Legion meme ever posted.
---
Please don‚Äôt respond to anymore of my comments, it gives me turbo virgin vibes, due to you getting mad about me making this meme in the first place. The fact the only two things you resort to saying are ‚ÄòyOu HaVe To HaVe SaW tHiS mEmE‚Äô or ‚ÄòrEmAkIng FoR kArMa‚Äô really says a lot, besides the false accusations your entire argument stems upon.
---
Yikes. I can feel the projection.
---
Grass
---
In your graphics card's control panel, you should be able to increase color saturation (in AMD's control panel literally called saturation; "digital vibrance" for NVIDIA). Maybe this could help you discern scratchmarks more easily. (I would not recommend keeping your colors over-saturated if you don't game, however, since it diminishes color gradients.)
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Thank you for doing this to him
---
i know my way around it. I‚Äôm not running a sneaky build tbh I run lithe adrenaline iron and self care if anything it‚Äôs a loop build or escape build üò≠ but I know how to get away from it especially on certain maps if they don‚Äôt have bloodhound then it‚Äôs over for them me playing killer has helped me alot tbh.
---
If you don't expect anything, then when you do get something, you're genuinely surprised
---
Lmao it's not that deep...  the lady streamer yelled me for being a dbag and stream sniping...  now I'm gonna go on reddit and talk shit about her to make myself feel better. This guy is a pansy...
---
Isn't Wraith their take on Freddy?
---
susie
---
Not a legion main, but this seems good : monitor and abuse, hex: ruin, pop goes the weasel and discordance
---
Deranked down all the way down to 15 before attempting to get this trophy. Plague is still my worst killer besides nurse and the recent changes made it way harder to double pip for the achievement.
---
That‚Äôs the strat
---
When I get gen rushed I get mad at myself for not applying more pressure i don't fault the survivors for doing their objective lol
---
consistency has never been the name of the game lol
---
They are very definitely A cancer. I think this community has many &gt;_&lt;
---
I don't know if you have leatherface but get it as soon as possible. Undoubtedly the best perk in the game alongside hex ruin. I feel like I'm at such a disadvantage without bbq it's insane. You get 2x bloodpoints and instant map knowledge upon hooking a survivor. Works even better for killers with mobility like spirit, Billy and nurse
---
Adrenalin, lithe (or dead hard), borrowed time and alert is my setup on Feng and I usually tap gens and run away just so i can keep track of the killer
---
Noice mate
---
i dont understand, you made them wiggle free then what?
---
Yeah I ran alert on her too and I wish dead hard would come in my
---
Blood web thing is most of my girl survivors are p3 50 already so its hard making them keep going over and over it the last females who are p1 and p2 is nea and claudette üò≠ and it‚Äôs so much work dead hard dont wanna come ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Interesting. It seems he deleted his reply, I can't see it anywhere. .
---
Welcome to our bitch, bitch.
---
Also I remember that scene
---
Michael: Omae wa mou shindeiru!
---
Laurie: Nani?!
---
I think the reason they haven‚Äôt implemented 2 killer games is because of the hosting issue since killers are the hosts of lobbies and you can‚Äôt have two of them, I think that dedicated servers will get rid of that issue and pave the way to 2 killer games
---
Tbh, I wish they would have made Leatherface a cosmetic for Hillbilly. Leatherface is so awful and boring to play as.
---
hahaha love the Myers one
---
Who? Who forgot this? Its like 1 of his 4 kills.

OMG yes, I can't even tell you how many times the pallet lag has screwed me over even though lobby ping is fine.

I remember it. I didn't even know about the hatch mechanic(I was still new to the game). I was playing kyf with 3 of my friends and it was me all alone, and my friend told me to look for the hatch and I can escape through it. I found it and jumped in(it was in lerys). Fun times
---
Dude, imagine getting shocked by a Doctor so you can't vault a window, get hit, then vault the window into a bear trap. I wouldn't even be mad
---
I do it all the time. Usually killer will either take first swing or even down you then open locker
---
Usually followed by a facecamp.. worth it to make him look like a dumb dumb
---
The moon is even staring
---
&gt;  I notice they is no mention about survivors going through windows multiple times when the entity has blocked the window. 
---
I thought I was going crazy over this and the only one seeing it. o-o
---
Well do we know for sure it didn't?
---
Also this does bring up an interesting point.
---
Til Feng Min, every survivor who disappeared, was more or less unloved/not missed.
---
Dwight was basically the world's saddest tragedy.
---
Meg's mom was probably the only person who missed her.
---
Jake's mom was the also the only one who cared about him.
---
It took a full week before some people online noticed Claudette wasn't around.
---
Nea presumably didn't really have anyone in her life who cared about her.
---
Ace was in the same boat as Nea.
---
So it's weird how the Entity started to go after famous people.
---
First Feng, an Esports champ, then Laurie, a famous fictional character, then David, a famous sports star... See where this goes?
---
Ooo til. Thank ya
---
Sure as hell one way to get the hatch.
---
Awesome, I‚Äôll be getting that Trapper one.
---
Yeah that's the one I want too
---
SWF would make a disguise killer useless. They will never add a killer like that I'm afraid.
---
Body blocking is nowhere toxic. Survivors have no other counter play. It's like when killers say "what am I supposed to do, just let you win?" Same thing same argument. Use the opportunity to get free hits and weaken the team.
---
The rest are pretty annoying if you ask me.
---
Never knew Tinkerer 2 had that issue. But it‚Äôs gross that they‚Äôll ban someone for using double blades instead of disabling one of them for now. Not everyone who plays DBD is on Reddit or some other site they get the news, so I‚Äôm expecting someone to get wrongfully banned right now. 
---
BHVR, if you see this, just disable one of the add ons for now. It‚Äôs way easier than saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use them or we‚Äôll ban you‚Äù
---
see you in hot
---
Some of these are neat, but I'd give everyone fair warning their merch is notoriously problem filled. If you don't mind waiting an absurdly long time to get your order then go right ahead, but ask any person who ordered a Trapper Mask or 2nd Anniversary shirt, it is painfully slow. 
---
For me personally it took ~4 months for a single shirt to finally make its way to me. I know other people have horror stories of goods going to the wrong place and delaying it even more.
---
*sprints burst away*
---
Staying on a generator for 80 seconds is also camping. Just work on all of them little by little lol
---
No at the end result i want more BP by rituals but less per,  so maybe 3 per day but 20k per or something like that
---
Strange. I feel like I get usage out of it all the time. It's kinda unusual, but I don't want to complain
---
I hate it because it makes no sense in the in game world. Think about if the Camp Counselors blocked Jason Voorhees from leaving a building. Could he kill them? Yes. Is it stupid in a horror setting? Yes. Bodyblocking can be toxic in certain scenarios. Not always, but sometimes.
---
Unless all the skill checks do is keep it progressing at the same speed it does now whereas missing them makes it regress.
---
Sometimes you gotta embrace the potato.
---
I'm just devotion 1 :/ i didn't even level up some good f the survivors
---
Ive played this game for 25 hours, no clue what you're talking about. Also why do i get downvoted when i literally didnt say anything negative.
---
Yeah I played like 10 games with her before I realized you could drink the corruption. I felt kinda silly but it really helped get the 4K. But I guess I‚Äôm going to have to keep trying because they changed the achievement.

If Myers got to T3 with tombstone and you weren't anywhere near done with gens, that match was over before it began.
---
Wow someone down voted me just for asking a question my god this community sucks.
---
Well, they‚Äôre not exactly the greatest at ‚Äúhiding‚Äù perks/addons etc seeing as the Ash Williams perks were leaked long before his release so I guess disabling these addons is probably too much to ask of them. 
---
Yes, normally it is a common practise to ban exploiters, however, there‚Äôs probably a lot of people nonchalantly using both of those Legion addons unaware that they‚Äôre being considered an exploit as there‚Äôs no real lucrative method involved when ‚Äúexploiting‚Äù with them both equipped. People could be using them thinking they‚Äôre just good at playing Legion. 
---
You can‚Äôt really compare these two scenarios though as the MacMillan Estate exploit was going to an out-of-bounds area of that particular map and this one is simply equipping two addons that are easily obtainable from the blood web. 
---
With the match history, there could be Legion one trick‚Äôs that have been using them since his chapter release, again, unaware of the ‚Äúexploit‚Äù and receiving a temp ban due to it. Not to mention there will more than likely be an influx of false flag reports now by salty survivors because they‚Äôve played against a Legion killer.
---
1.5k hours in, I still have this problem at times. Not even the "oh they're a higher rank than me" thing. I just get anxious.
---
Buff nurse and give base huntress iri heads
---
Pre buff hag was still decent, but like, no one mained her and addons were a must. 32 meters was not enough and setting traps was so slow. 5 fucking seconds. They really did a good job with the buff
---
What perk is that?
---
O daaang, nice work Didz
---
This community is so sad
---
Well therein lies the problem then. Not the survivors being ‚Äútoo easy‚Äù, just not having the tools at your disposal to play the way you‚Äôd ideally like to. That statement i can agree entirely with. Sucks that the hag isn‚Äôt included in the pc version, on console all killers up until huntress were included. I suppose I‚Äôve never seen it from the perspective of not having every killer/teachable perk before since i have purchased em all on console and for the killers i enjoy i have made my preferred build on them. For a default killer with little to no perks vs a squad of survivors then i guess yea the game is pretty shitty and I wouldn‚Äôt play killer myself under those circumstances.
---
What do you mean by not respecting pallets exactly? Do you mean if they are standing there at the pallet charge em let em clock you with it?
---
Huh, I thought the two plus killers was only a KYF thing...
---
1k bp is 1k bp
---
TBH, they should fix glitch spots too but I understand that takes time. However this is beyond stupid just remove the addons until they fix them. The addons are bugged thats there fault not the people using them without knowing

Since it was confirmed the Entity could traverse universes, I'll assume Laurie was fictional in the DBD world

Jesus christ chill out I was just wondering. You people are so fucking sensitive
---
What‚Äôs your PSN ?
---
It seems like everyone is stating a point about your post, and I don‚Äôt get it too. Why do you complain about the game‚Äôs balance and the way it can be toxic if you contribute about its toxicity with a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù build ? 
---
What‚Äôs the point of complaining in that case, I just don‚Äôt get it
---
What are some fun but barely viable perk builds for Nurse?
---
Same thing, I think the servers are down :/
---
Also would be cooler if they actually added original art on it... They just added a filter on the existing characters and thats it
---
I was referring to people just playing legion, not having the blades stacked... If you just immediately dc, how do you know they have those add-ons
---
And they should make an in-game announcement or else following up on that is potentially unfair.
---
It's OK in a chase.  Sometimes I have to bottle twice to just get a hit but it's usually pretty fine.
---

---
wow never truly realised what an actual chess game this game is lol thanks for the essay of the info :] so your talking safe/unsafe in the survivors eyes okay
---
It was proven that she was in fact, the assaultee
---
Hmm well that was fast.
---
Anyone having problems on PC or Xbone?
---
There is a ton of people using them that know about their bugs and are doing it on purpose to screw people over. The devs can use post game chat logs and match history to check who is using them on purpose.
---
Idk if they've ever removed add ons in the past, so I'm not sure if they can do that.
---
They can fix the add ons while also banning people for abusing exploits. People used to get on top of objects that the killer couldn't access, they also got banned before that got fixed.
---
It's nothing new to ban people for abusing exploits, I don't think there are any issues with it.
---
It worked for me like 4 hours ago when I was a on, if it still doesn‚Äôt work maybe delete the game and reinstall  that‚Äôs what I usually do when I get errors and bs and it fixes for me
---
Sometimes when I play as a killer(PS4) I suddenly slow down/stop for a split second even though I'm still pushing the analog stick just as much. It almost feels like I'm fighting the stick, if that makes sense. 
---
Is this lag? Framerate? So the survivors see me as slowing down?
---
same
---
Zubatlel and Scott Jund are probably some of the best killer streamers around.
---
I keep getting disconnected saying I can't access network features without a patch. Um did a patch JUST come out?
---
It's stuff where things that should be universally agreed on are subverted. Like saying that Mt ormond is bad for looping so it's a bad survivor map.
---
Or talking about all the survivor nerfs and just rattling off a list like "flashlights pallets vaults" with no context to hide why those things were changed
---
"Gen rush" is a term that takes way back when the game was in it's early stage. Before Gen progress could not be noticed unless a survivor was working on it. The goal of the Gen rush was to leave every generator at 99% and don't pop it instantly, and wait for someone else to pop another one. This gave a feeling to killers that generators were done too quick (and to be fair, it was, because they took 60 seconds with 1 survivor and no toolbox instead of the 80 seconds). This term got popular because this strat was used way too often and made Killers feel helpless. Nowdays that strat is not that viable agaisn't Killers with experience since they will kick a generator anytime given. But that's that.
---
It's possible that a survivor is body blocking you. Next time it happens, try looking down, if you don't see anyone, then I'm afraid I'm mistaken and I can't help you. If you do see a survivor you now see how sneaky they can be :p

Sounds like lag
---
Okay
---
I think there are lots of issues with banning people for doing something in game, not hacking or glitching. Its bad enough when they leave an exploit in, now they are banning for using addons, literally nothing else just powering up the game and using stuff in game. The addons even promote being used together. Beyond stupid hope no one is banned for this.
---
Especially people who dont go on reddit/forums like 90% of the playerbase
---
I got camped again 2 games after this one, also yeah these ranks are full of immersive claudettes that get scared after hearing the terror radius for 0.1 seconds or people who don't know how to do gens while you're being chased for like 10 minutes :(
---
DamnNoHTML has a great video called "how to run generic tiles" for killers. For pallets, there are some basic things to remember. 90% of them are safe unless the survivor messes up. I'll generally test them for a few seconds, then break the pallet if they look like they know what they're doing. As others have said, it's better to force the survivor to throw the pallet down early. The reason for this is that it eliminates the total number of loops they'll get out of it. Killer is all about time efficiency.
---
Yes and no. M1 Killers struggle with it since they have no options on how to down survivors, so it's a hard counter for them. However, with killers like Huntress, Hillbilly, Legion and Nurse (for some odd reason...) don't add to MoM counter. The perk is situational at best.
---
If you can force Killers to M1 you, it's a safety net.

Something about calling Freddy "Frederick" is sending me rn

Legion is cancer rn, most players know this, granted few players don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs on BHVR to disable the character until they fix it, or at least do it in a timelier manner than 5 months. 
---
The whole release of legion was a shit show and they deserve to know it so they learn from their mistakes. Plague release is bad too but in a different capacity. They need to start making more interesting and challenging perks/play styles instead of everything being a crutch for killers. The problem isn‚Äôt that killers are bad it‚Äôs that objectives are too simple with coordination.
---
I still have a good chunk of killers i need to get to 50 so ill level all up to 50 and decide which i like the best
---
Only legally mature people (Over 16 in some countries, 18 in others). The Entity has a good lawyer.
---
It‚Äôs so adorable! Honestly though, I wish Meg had more sweatpant cosmetics in the store :/. Those are my favorite pants to run on her.
---
I mean I wouldn't mind dicking around with it if it happened in a game I was in, but would never do it in a regular match outside of kyf.
---
It's a douche move to the other survivors/killer not in on it. Just trolls the game and you deserve to be banned for that. You're actively ruining others experience for your own enjoyment.
---
good luck friend! If it is useful, I find the trapper and the huntress so good, and I used to play as witch at first too. But, you know, that depends on the person and his or her style of playing
---
The add ons don't promote being used together, they just have the same effect. They don't have an extra effect when you stack them. People are stacking them purely to make the glitch stronger.
---
Exploiting is abusing the game's glitches and oversights to achieve results that were not intended and that often break the games completely. Yes it's the devs fault that those bugs are in the game, but it wasn't their intention for them to be there and to be used. The users exploiting them are using them while knowing that they are bugs. That behaviour gets punished.
---
&gt;Beyond stupid hope no one is banned for this.
---
I don't understand this sentence.
---
It‚Äôs the price of a cup of coffee.

No need to be sorry for the long text, it truly helps. I am TRASH like burning hot garbage as survivor so i have to learn survivors tricks by youtubers and streamers along with playing against them

So is the other killer able to down in one hit despite not having tier 3?

Kidnapped a bunch of social rejects (except Claudette who actually had a lot of friends online) - Okay that makes sense.

Kidnap successful pseudo-celebrities (Ace, David, Jeff, Technically Laurie if we use the 2018 movie cannon?) - Would raise suspicion.
---
Kidnap literal goddamn celebrities (Kate, Jane) - Okay someone's going to wonder what the fuck's going on.

Kidnap experienced fighters who by all rights could murder the shit out of the Killers if they got their hands on any sort of weapon (Ash, Bill, Tapp) - Okay now you're just asking for them to escape your realm.

one time, i was with a Feng min who had totally given up the game and was alternating between lockers while i was trying to do gens. we had two left. i had been playing with my girlfriend and i had her spectate and she confirmed it. killer also seemed to have picked up on the fact that my teammate was useless. when he found me, i thought i was dead but through nodding and pointing we came to an understanding, and i led him to the locker where she was. i followed behind like a little shitlord and when she was hooked i teabagged until she died and then killer gave me hatch üòÇ afterwards i thanked him and he said ‚Äúno problem, she wasn‚Äôt helping you at ALL.‚Äù and we agreed that useless survivors are annoying af
---
Apparently they clarifyed in saying they spy on their players and know who uses Legion regularly and can tell if someone "suddenly" decides to play lots of Legion and intentionally uses the broken addons. So if you've been doing it since before it became an exploit, you basically have license to keep doing it until it's fixed, if you're a JohnnyComeLately, you'll get banned for it.
---
Eh, like 70% of the time I run ruin it gets found within the first 20 seconds by a designated hex sniffer while the other 3 power through the gens. Its also what my group does when playing survivor. 
---
Really overrated perk imo. Just a wasted perk slot in my experience and I do better on average without it.
---
Playing another side actually helps a lot. When I started playing I wanted to be a survivor main but due to my potato skill, didn't get far. Switched sides and I realized Im better at killer than survivor even though I enjoy surviving more =(

And here I'm just wondering how they get away with using things like Freddy's Glove to sell as their merchandise on that killer perk pillow. 
---
Surely an image as iconic as Freddy's glove is a license all it's own.
---
I honestly think that some form of Borrowed Time should be put on base to lessen the effects of farming.
---
Or downing someone who was unsafely unhooked should reveal the aura of the person who did the unhooking. I don't think that a "reject unhook" feature should be implemented though because that would be abused too much by trolls.
---
What about your solo survivor experience is no longer fun? I haven‚Äôt noticed any of my games lacking any quality vs SWF. In fact I‚Äôd prefer playing solo because my queue times get dummy thicc if I‚Äôm with my friends.
---
Just because the only thing you create is verbal diarrhea doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't be credited for their work.
---
Always annoying when the person gets hit/downed for the first time and dc's because they for some reason have to play a perfect game
---
Yea same. What the fuck does it mean?
---
I accepted it
---
This says making a false support ticket. Not a redundant one. They may say they will, but they will not punish you for reporting DC.
---
No, dont switch sprint for borrowed if you play solo. Might consider switching adrenaline for Iron Will if you are new and want to sneak around.
---
I didn't his to a teammate that was corner camping all game. Didn't help do anything. His friend still messaged me saying o was trash for helping killer... They had taken the game hostage and there wasn't even enough gens done for hatch. Some people are just clueless.

It's a 1980s cult classic directed by Larry Cohen of *It's Alive!* fame. These miners find this goop while they're working and decide to eat some of it and it's delicious so they sell it and it ends up on the market as food. But it has an insidious secret! And an ex-FBI agent and 12 year old boy unravel it.
---
It's fantastic.
---
I had an idea for a plausible-ish game mode. Three zones. Two killers, x amount of survivors. First zone, you have to complete gens to open a gate, which leads to the second zone, instead of the exit. When a zone is opened, there‚Äôs a respawn function of some kind, for killers and perhaps survivors.

That actually sounds super cool
---
lol did you ever get back inside the map?
---
Also, holding right click with freddy's power slowed you down, now it doesn't. With whispers and range addons you really can find everyone. And if I remember correctly, they made him slow down a tiny bit once he put someone to sleep plus the sleep timer is increased a little (meaning freddy has to wait longer)
---
That was the old store however, that's why they created this new store, since all this problems were caused by the gaming legends company and not BHVR.
---
Hopefully this store will provide better times and better products!

Me, cheating on my diet:
---
Me, but to myself after eating fried chicken:

To be fair if I'm playing huntress and you run into the basement you bet I'm standing at the top chucking hatchets down
---
I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was a better platform to post art, I do so on twitter myself but it's hard to find a community to really post likeminded things in - reddit is a close option but the reposts really need to be sorted out first.  I imagine a lot more artists would be posting if they felt safer...
---
Also, youtube thumbnails of uncredited art are the worst. Bless the users who commission artists and don't just rip off them.
---
You can apply deep wounds and still have a nice fair game, just use it as intended.
---
Do you remember back in the day, when games didn't received updates and all that? when you found a broken move you just limited yourself on how to use it to make the game fun both for you and the people you were playing with, it's the same. Legios is truly from the 90's.
---
Using the blade addons increases expnentially the mend timer making it incredibly long to mend
---
Even 5 minutes to fully mend
---
Okay here‚Äôs a shorter video [dead by daylight ](https://youtu.be/MIuJsaUT8DQ)  let me know what you think of that
---
I feel like combining it with ruin is a bad idea. Since the survivors spend less time early game on gens, that means they spend more time looking for another gen AND ruin at the same time. 
---
If the survivors are potatoes and can't find ruin then it'd be a pretty damn good setup I'd imagine, but 99% of the time ruin spawns out in the open and/or right next to a gen.
---
Yeah I've noticed that some killer mains don't like it. A lot of the time when I'm playing ash I seem to get targeted. Probably because they know i most likely  have mettle of man and want me out of the way. It's quite annoying.
---
Sorry, but I'm tired of dying on my first hook.

Dude insidious on myers??? That's a terrible perk for Myers he doesnt have a terror radius.. it's a waste, and so is noed, you have noed in your hand.. geez....  I'm sure he has other things to help him... unrelenting? Save the best for last? Play with your food? Dying light?  So dont give me that excuse of decent perks... those weren't decent perks.. lmaoo

"When all gens get done, but you haven't reached evil 3 once"
---
It's funny but tbh that building in Grim Pantry is broken.
---
I'm surprised they didn't close some of those windows yet.
---
hahaha WHY is it always Claudettes!!! I can actually think of another time it happened to me on Badham preschool. Gens were all done, one gate was open. It was against a trapper and both gates were super close. He put most of his traps on one exit gate and one trap on the switch of the other. Props to him for planning that in advance I guess. Two people left and it was just me and the Claud. He was camping the open gate with all his traps. Every time I went to the other gate he could literally see me from a distance and came over. I couldn't disable his trap in time and open it. Never, ever saw the Claud. The back and forth with the trapper lasted wayyy too long till eventually he chased me for another 5 minutes. I actually managed to escape and still hadn't seen the Claud.
---
After the game she called me a cunt and some other stuff and said I was an idiot for not leaving (even though I literally couldn't leave). One of the most toxic post match chats I've seen. They were sitting on the hatch waiting for it to open while I got chased. They literally could've opened the other non trapped exit, I could have got out, and then could have gone back for the hatch about 10 minutes earlier. Luckily the others spectating spoke up for me cos I was confused as fuck.
---
Yes? It's an exploit. They should get banned. If survivors did anything close to this, the subreddit would literally be ripping their own ovaries out in anger.
---
Have you tried other games and this happened?
---
But all I really get out of it is BBQ and Franklin's Demise really bc I've used a few Bone Splinters and I suck as Leatherface and  wouldn't use him. Plus I've only got like $25 to spend rn and I'm already planning on spending $10 on Myers and Legion ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Yep.. I get so angry with the pallets failing me... it's like you have to drop them before they even get close to ensure you dont get hit through it.
---
You only have to pay for pink haired Susie. The other one you can get with shards
---
yeah, i keep getting an error code 8015. i can't even get into the game. no fix besides just not playing it... which i guess is what i'll do? lol
---
I‚Äôm just stating in game mechanics, people are strange.
---
When they escaped I'd just patrol the jigsaw boxes, keep them from getting any traps off, and eventually that timer ticks to 0 while I'm crouched behind them, and their head pops open
---
I said kinda like a nurse extra blink lunge.
---
I bet those teabaggers won't be so damn smug now
---
Ban every Legion that does this.
---
Doesn't matter, it's a principle thing. If we all lay down and accept it nothing would change - people work hard and they deserve some kindness, you know?
---
The thing I mentioned, a "source: me" worked just fine, it was at least having the user to confirm it was theirs. And if one really wanted to make sure it was theirs, if a user had posted previous, consistent art there'd be nothing to question. You wouldn't need a page, but it does make it easier if anyone doubted you. 
---
It's generally pretty obvious when someone hasn't drawn the art, they don't go into details about the work, say proper thanks, or anything like that. That said, it hasn't stopped people from not checking these things before upvoting them.

Yeah, I think overall it punishes the already B tier and lower which is mostly agreed being m1 killers. All top tier popular killers are not included in this or have abiltys that are good that ignore it, if nurse is fixed by now she will be much less powerful against it because her attacks after blinking now count, but it‚Äôs still the nurse and barely gets affected by it.
---
tl:dr 
---
It punishes the m1 killers that are already struggling and can be ignored or partially ignored by the already strong killers.
---
With me it's the opposite. I avoid hitting an Obsession Ash unless there's nobody else around. I don't mean to sound self-praising but most of my matches are hatch games anyway. I'll leave Ash until last and if he gets hatch that's fine. You can tell by the way someone plays if they have Adrenaline/MoM/Dead Hard etc. so I'm fine if they just follow me around all match trying to get stacks.
---
He had so much speed she started orbiting around the entity's realm. Now she's a satellite.
---
Instagram is horrible, reports have always been a headache there. I haven't signed up for this reason. :c Sorry it happens to you.
---
I mean that guy coulda just hid there after hearing the killer, are we taking the word of this stranger?
---
There appears to be some connection issues on PS4 right now. We are currently investigating and determining if the issue is on our end.
---
Don't even think that I didn't see what you did there 
---
"Madman"
---
Beautiful.
---
Kinda a one sided video, but whatever.
---
you can pretend to search for a solo game as survivor for forever if you end up getting past the error code 8015. it's nice. kind of meditative in the fuck-this-game sense.
---
nice
---
I enjoyed f13 when it first came out. There were some little bugs and exploits that needed to be fixed. Dedicated servers would of helped a lot. But instead they changed a lot about the game before adding and fixing those things so the player base dropped. Haven‚Äôt played it since
---
There appears to be some connection issues on PS4. We are looking into it right now.
---
Just tell us shirtless Meyers is holding the servers hostage lol. We thank you for investigating. NA Ps4 I get error code 8018 and 8015
---
You have quite literally proven my point. Thanks.
---
I use Nvidia Freestyle and it works really well.
---
Yeah, it would be cool if it somehow took Nurse/Spirit/Billy/Huntress down a peg without affecting m1 killers too bad. There is nothing more heartbreaking then playing as Freddy and 2 hits in a row are Mettle triggers. It can be crippling against m1's when used well. Against Nurse? It only takes 10 seconds off the chase.
---
"Hey killer, why didn't you let me escape lol"
---
Would definitely watch
---
Seems like that‚Äôs what they want
---
It's additive
---
Yeah. Ghostface actually has a lot of cosmetics, since he is owned by a costumes company.
---
We could get:
---
Brandon James: The poncho, the masks.
---
The killer: the scary movie mask (hell if they can make it have some expressions this would be one of my faves, imagine him laughing at you when he hooks you, or a disgusted face whengetting stunned), the funworld robe (it is different from the movie one) and the cleaver used in the movie to decapitate the girl.
---
Scarecrow ghostface: The scarecrow mask and robe and a hand scythe or another farming tool.
---
Ah thanks! And while I have a Dev here, thanks so much for everything you and the other people at BHVR have done with DBD.
---
Alot of people might bitch, but at the end of the day, DBD is a great game
---
Spawning in = DC
---
What do you even mean by that? You are just ignoring my post.
---
Yup. I get the stun, but still end up getting hit. Even if it looks like I won't get hit, I'm hit. I usually just accept the game wants me to die.
---
Then your other team mates don't understand how it goes and they all end up dead.

I know my perks are shitty. That's my build from when I first started playing and I didn't know much about the game. I changed mains and I hadn't bothered to change them.
---
Oh. I thought I heard that somewhere. Still, I mean such a height would befit the personification of evil that he is
---
Is there a bug causing the entity blocker not to function? Is there a bug where you chainsaw stops and it looks like it should hit but it doesn't?
---
Yeah no shit
---
A developer commented on a similar thread and they are looking into it to determine if its an issue their end
---
Why what?
---
Play however you want, you don't need to play how survivors want. 
---
Do your job, murder them :)
---
The perk is a crutch, depends if you need that or not.
---
It just shows how incompetent these devs truly are. Instead of posting it ingame as an unskippable message, they post it on their fucking blog that no one reads.
---
They are so unpleasant that when they come near a genetator the survivors start running to avoid them
---
he got into the locker like 30 seconds before I took this. He was in one the entire game, but not this same one.
---
that or they're just fooling themselves.
---
for reference, current player count : 
---
* 21,173 Dead by Daylight 
---
* 443 Friday the 13th
---
Exactly!! No one likes legion! Hes a bully!
---
No doctor dildo? I'm uninstalling.
---
If you're willing to sacrifice a perk slot for early game on Doc, Corrupt Intervention's not bad.  Usually Survivors will simply immerse for those first 2 minutes, but Doctor's Static Field can put an end to that nonsense quickly.
---
Aside from Doc and maybe Trapper/Hag though, Corrupt intervention is really meh.
---
Lol he got prank'd
---
Have fun mending for 12minutes, there‚Äôs literally no point in trying, no matter how much of an mlg survivor main you could be
---
This 3 window setup is so mean lol and when one window gets blocked you have the pallets above and below. As well as the good ass window downstairs.
---
More like locker guy wiggles free, unhooks the snitch and they both hit the hatch. At any rate one of them is likely to hit that hatch right after the hook.
---
some people are just bad at certain games. after 300 hours i would say you cant really improve.
---
I hate racism.
---
But you're playing the racism card to justify camping. This is post game chat. No way you knew they were a racist prior.
---
Which is fine to camp, but to use racism to justify your actions is just as bad
---
It's just an annoyance in the game that doesn't affect the best killers. If one hit decides the game then it wasn't a strong killer match in the first place. I'm just afraid that more people are encouraged to move to the killers it doesn't impact which will lower killer diversity.
---
 I don't understand why this has to be a Survivors Vs. Killers argument. If something in the game increases how often you face Nurse and Billy then you should probably be concerned too.
---
That was probably me then. I was the Meg. Fun match!
---
Yeahhhhh

This is pretty good!
---
Were you on console or pc?
---
What rank tho?
---
What do you mean?
---
The DC debacle.
---
Also the fact that he desperately relies on Ether and either Feathers or Bleach addons for his power to properly impact the chase.  The amount he slows himself when he throws a bottle without feathers vs the slow applied to Survivors baseline results in his power being more of a "bark but no bite" power unless you're using addons.
---
It mah boi
---
Could be many things; Your savefile is not being sent to the cloud, problems with the game files.
---
But i have seen this in first person. My theory goes as the dev team messed up hard on the ranking situation and they somehow disabled ranking up or down for a while. Should be working normally now since they tweeked the ranking system and rank reset happened
---
No worries my friend, they patched this a few months ago. No more infinite squirting blood everywhere until it lags the frame rate of the game out and forces it to crash. Not sure about other platforms but almost every wraith game with sloppy butcher on PS4, after being hit you would continuously squirt blood out. Even if you were healed you still would be squirting blood out and it would drop the frame rate out so bad to where either you would lag out of the game or everyone was lagged out. If BhVR has blocked the sloppy butcher perk for a little bit until patched it would have solved the problem. But they don‚Äôt and let this glitch persist for a long time until they patched it.
---
Groovy
---
Whaaaaaaaat?! That's gonna be fucking sick
---
Where can you see them?
---
i would like it.
---
i kinda wanna see a dbd model of the beldam from coraline.
---
Entitree displeased.
---
While someone else owns Freddy (including his signature glove), BHVR owns this particular art. I'm sure it was all worked out prior to selling it.
---
Artist: http://ecstaticasusual.tumblr.com
---
Took me three whole minutes to find the artist. It mustn't be a favourite of yours if you can't spend five fucking minutes finding the person who drew it, or you're just a lazy ass.
---
Not to mention her VO...
---
You get the hit, and you can go sleep other people or break the pallet and continue on your way.  They fail a skillcheck, that gives you a notification so that you can go and restart the 7 second mindgame for a second hit.
---
Freddy's one of the few killers I will risk Self-Care against, because a good Freddy can easily down Awake and Injured Survivors.
---
I hope they add the shirtless David to the store.  I'd love to buy that skin to wear IRL.
---
Don't be fooled, thats a completely intended mechanic. Dead By Daylight is the perfect gaming experience.
---
It‚Äôs a bug exploit from and very bannable now
---
What rank
---
It was bound to happen before daylight.
---
&gt;!I'll see myself out now.!&lt;
---
What killer was it?
---
I guess my problem is that if a player wants Kindred they can just use the perk. Like, a lot of the game is weighing pros and cons but you want to have your cake and eat it, too. The reason it's the way it is currently is to help with gen repair speed. We all know that generators go absurdly quickly, and there a few things in the game to help with it, and the possibility of multiple survivors going for the save is one of the things that does so because it pulls people off gens.
---
And a basekit totem counter would be a huge nerf to Devour Hope and I just do not support weakening an already very vulnerable perk
---
phew I play PC never heard of that, sounds like aids to play against.
---
It's a dropbear
---
Was it you, buddy? üòâ
---
I've been playing over 2 years.  I play both sides but consistently rank higher as killer every month than survivor 1 vs rank 1-8 as survivor depending on how much I played that month.  If you are seriously going to refer to pallet looping as this unbeatable cheese mechanic at this point with no pallet vacuum and neutered window spawns in most buildings then I know for a fact my previous suspicions of you are true.  You are playing them all wrong.  You should not be getting looped this hard still unless you're on Coldwind them maps still rough unless you are playing their chases completely wrong.  And gen rushing is 90% on killers over committing to chases they have no business still being in with multiple survivors up.  Pressure them gens boy.  It is possible to be objective and not cry for our games to literally be handed to us by demanding "massive survivor nerfs" and still be a killer main.  Go play the other side and then quickly realize how tonedeaf your outrage is.  Killers have never been in a better place.  Decisive is dead huzzah!
---
When is the mid chapter update they talked about in the developer update?
---
before rank reset 10-7, after 14-11
---
 I also played around 10 matches with Friends (rank 20-18)
---
pc
---
I want a spirit dabbing
---
Or I don't know how? Jesus dude.
---
This is normal. While fast vaults land a set distance away from the window, short and medium vaults only place you right up against the window. The killer is still able to swing through the window, and the point where you got hit in this instance is still well within his reach (even before you factor in latency).
---
Obviously it should be his power.  His perks should still follow the same line of "breaking the rules."  Maybe a perk to make all hex totems appear as dull totems until 2 generators are complete or something wild.
---
definitly 15, you never see trappers and wraiths at higher ranks,
---
Top 3 should be 
---
1 Legion
---
2 Spirit
---
3 Nurse
---
Oh ok. Kept hearing something about mid June or something like that.  Thanks
---
no, lol. it's a perk, why shouldn't players use it?
---
Last time this happened, the support team told me it was my problem and my internet connection, then magically it fixed itself 4 days later. Now it's happening again. Nothing to do with my internet connection thanks!  
---
Sucks though as this is the only time I get off this week to play.
---
Don‚Äôt waste god pallet :,(
---
Late response but I'll talk about your idea.
---
Killer power: I like. Not too strong, but not that weak. May not be meta, but not everything needs to be, and since he isn't too weak I'll approve.
---
Last Word: promotes tunneling, which is a no-no. But the idea isn't bad, maybe rework it. Something like "Each time you hook a survivor, gain a token. Each token reduces survivor action speeds by 2/3/4%.", so it is more of a snowball perk. It was before, but now it doesn't encourage tunneling. 
---
Movie Night: Like the idea, but it isn't viable at all. It doesn't have to be meta, but it should find more use. Maybe something like "Each stage of bloodlust gives you a bonus 10/15/20% reduction in your attack cool downs". Sure at bloodlust 3 it is stupid strong, but that's 45 seconds of chasing a survivor without being stunned, breaking a pallet, or hitting them.
---
Suspicious Fright: This is too strong. Again, not a bad idea. How about "whenever you enter within 32 meters of a survivor working on a generator, see their aura for 5/6/7 seconds. This has a cool down of 70/60/50 seconds". That way it will give you good information, but it isn't overpowering and has a long cool down.
---
No, because you did an explicit slow vault
---
Remember those cosmetics that were teased on YouTube a while ago (leaked?), well any idea on when they might be released?
---
So camping is as bad as racism? Also I wasn't camping.
---
Exclusively? Look how community react to current state of the solo gameplay: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/search?Search=Solo+survivor
---
Ooooh yeah...
---
It was, but the Dr. Cured it lol zzzzap!
---
The only problem is that we already have a long time with queues, now image that with half of the people over that mode, it will worse the time to find a match :/
---
I dance to her music
---
Yes, almost all of my survivor matches are solo. I play SWF with one other person about 3 times per week.
---
I do not care what the cry babies in forums say. Address my argument and stop with this "but other people are crying too" nonsense. That doesn't matter.
---
I know but I had time to move before I got hit and I am far from the window after being hit
---
The fact that he was seen falling was to embarrassing and aggravating that he disconnected
---
appreciate the offer but Im on PS4! We have our own host of other issues too haha
---
Sorry, forgot to mention: Overall I like the killer a lot, but the perks, although no bad concepts, needed tweaking.
---
Excuse me buddy, but if a lot of people agreed that playing solo is not fun at all, than there is something wrong about this.
---
Thanks!
---
Well they said that Dedicated Servers would be coming in the summer, so maybe in mid june? I haven't heard anything official for those yet.
---
But it has a pretty good negative of if you heal after mom is used then the killer can see your aura, it's not just the old ds perk with no consequences
---
They might be trying to pick them up, providing the downward survivor has fully recovered
---
RUN TRAPPER RUN
---
100% agreed.  It stunts development of killer play hard.
---
No, this is an exploit that people have found and are now using in their SWF lobbies. I wouldn't recommend trying this on purpose in a non SWF lobby as you will get banned for doing it.
---
I predict not BBQ.
---
G R O O V Y
---
&gt; and I am far from the window after being hit
---
No you're not. That was latency. Slow vaults are designed so that always hits
---
Kindred is gonna be added as default quality of life for solo players soon? 
---
Ps. Bunny feng min will be ever released?
---
No, i never said that. 
---
I said using the racism card to justify your actions when your previous actions didnt even involve race, is just as bad as racism.
---
don't get me wrong, it's beautiful. but dark
---
So to be clear you have no intention of addressing my arguments
---
 ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Consider it advice then: Imaginary internet points from strangers aren't worth worrying about. Also, in my few years on reddit, I've notice many people will downvote someone who complains about downvotes, so if they are important to you, don't bring it up
---
well done mate looks great
---
Pesci as a killer when?
---
Oh yeah bb I love D A T A
---
glad i'm not the only one. thought my pc was dying lol
---
&lt;3 thanks
---
&gt; But it has a pretty good negative of if you heal after mom is used then the killer can see your aura
---
All you have to do is 99 your heal then finish it off when the killer sees you. Voila, no aura downside
---
And it shows
---
They arent, just find it weird how many people downvote stuff on reddit just for the fun of it.
---
Maybe try 2v 6 and if its too op for survivors then rank the amount of survivors based on rank of survivors and the killers rank. Ex: rank 1 killed adds 4 survivor, rank 10 adds 3 and 20 adds 2. Something like this. Rank 20s would get high level survivors though ( obviously not exactly like this because it has flaws )
---
I respects your opinion, but I still think this issue should be adressed.
---
I mean I have my moments..
---
\- a camping, moonwalking, tunneling, op addon plus ebony mori using, legionplayer. 
---
Just making sure everyone realizes who is giving them this great advice upvoted by all the other camping killers.
---
He was clearly in struggle phase when the clip starts... So at his second hook... Yes.
---
It's not even right now PS4 survivor queue times have been off and on broken mostly on for the better part of a year.
---
+1
---
I agree with you and I'm very sad that everybody think it's normal.
---
Trying to survive by getting the hatch and hoping the other survivor die before you is a way to play.
---
Working with the killer? It's a legit reason to ban op.
---
Well then he was just an asshole
---
Lol nah there's definitely an asterisk next to it though haha.  But hey you got out that's all some players care about.
---
What does it mean when other survivors start T-bagging me at the start of the game? Are they trying to tell me that I am a noob and that they want nothing to do with me and want me to go away and do my own gens?
---
Just use the fucking perk
---
If this happens what would you do to not get banned, since disconnecting lowers your rank
---
Watch monto to learn some mind games and prediction habits
---
Or mabey they are trying to get an achievement
---
Oh, you have nothing to worry about if you‚Äôre not intentionally exploiting the bug. The devs have a system in which they can figure out who exploited it
---
So taking latency into account the distance I made didn't exist
---
Had something similar happen to me and my bud last night. We loaded into a three man vs a Legion. Our last guy was a fuckin pinecone. It was one of the coldwind maps, and he just kept hiding up on a tractor. Never did a gen. He saved one of us once. Me and my buddy ended up dying, and I'm going to go out on a limb and say he got hatch too. We ended up leaving as soon as we died because we where so fed up with the guy.
---
lmao karma xD
---
No it‚Äôs because you camped before you knew and  now are tryin for defend yourself, let it go you fucked up don‚Äôt dig yourself a deeper hole
---
If you disconnect more than a certain % of your total games played then you will get banned. Nobody is free from that rule.
---
Concent creators play the game A LOT, so they have a higher number of total games played. If you were to play as much as they do, you'd be in the exact same spot. They don't get any special treatment.
---
It would be better to guide the killer away from there if you see that from a distance because they already have someone healing them and the killer doesn't know they're there
---
happy cakeday

i hope this was helpful! i understand why the commenter above got upset, but they probably could have been gentler about it. the general rule of reposting art is if you don't have a source, don't post it. üíú
---
Do you know how latency works and what it is? Because you didn't actually gain that ground. Look at when the killer's lunge is actually occurring and where you are during that part of the animation. Again, slow faults are designed to work this way
---
I was the original Wraith in the game, and I left survivors alone while the other Wraith went and killed survivors. Glad to know I won't get in trouble.
---
No amount of borrowed time will bring him back.
---
It means hello
---
Its not wrong or rude, yet to maximize the chances of blood warden procking, i would run something else so that people are less intimidated, more confident, and more altruistic.
---
It‚Äôs been 5 months. Is it really that hard? Change the damn addons if you can‚Äôt fix them.
---
and the legion just so happens to also be disgusting. pig's ability is actually fine for the game and was really unique at its debut
---
the perk is Spine Chill, which lets you know the killer is looking at you. since the perk is a puffed-up kitty, all of the survivors are puffed-up kitties too. :p
---
I think I screamed "WHAT ARE YOU DOING" like Robbie Rotten a couple of nights ago when the Meg/Kate who were helping me both blew skill checks on a non-hexed gen back to back.
---
''...''
---
I wouldn't call that being defensive, I was utterly baffled that this dude complained about "camping the hatch" when I knew he was in the immediate area of it.  I just stood near it and waited like "I know where it is too, go ahead."  Then I got bored and paced around until he got it.
---
In a game where actions are measured in seconds, any attentive killer playing Legion would notice that it takes longer and longer for the survivors to heal up from being Frenzied every time they get hit. They might not notice fully unless they get it to a minute+ of mending time, but they should notice. If not, the survivors would inevitably complain about the longer mending times unless the killer just leaves the game immediately.
---
Campers don't get 26k blood points, especially when it's not even a 4k. From my experience campers get around 15k when they 4k.

Playing nurse on console with decent ping

---
Why are little kids on this game tho.. I thought this would be a safe haven
---
I see Wraith and Trapper frequently in red ranks. 
---
Most frequent is probably Billy for me. I am central EU.
---
Not sure why op is arguing, he deserve to have gotten hit there, slow vaults are basically guaranteed to get you hit
---
Never camped, never tunneled unless it was the safest choice to go after, never moonwalked.
---
Just make sure you never put all Legion players in the same bucket and be mature enough to understand my advice is because survivors are salty as fuck and complain about everything. No matter what addons or perks or killer you use, they will find something to complain about. Just play the way you want and feel like it. NOED is a perk, easy to overcome and useless in my opinion because you play with 3 perks until the end...which is why I never use it. 
---
I expected anytime one of you people to jump at my throat because I play Legion and you didn't fail me :) Nice community.
---
Freddy main here. 
---
Insidious is an absolute waste on him, even more so with M&amp;A. M&amp;A however is amazing on him. It's my favorite perk in the game for a reason.
---
If you're going to come on here and be a douchebag troll could you have at least given us a better insult to read than "sadsuck"?  That shit was soft as babyshit son.
---
I got the two killer bug the other day, and I was Michael (my killer pal was a billy) and my stalk function was broken. I could use m2 to stalk but my evil within never went up. I didn‚Äôt take a scratched mirror, I just couldn‚Äôt gain anything from stalking. Also I took a mori and, even though the other killer didn‚Äôt, he was still able to m1 kill survivors.
---
Day 2: DBD servers still down, no end in sight
---
Plenty of killers countered ds by dribbling.. I think survivors need an op perk..  leave MoM alone.
---
Why fixing somthing you fucked up, just ban your OWN Players for it ! 10/10 Big Brain move there ! Why not testing it enough to bring out fleshed out. ... insanity i know !
---
I see this sort of reply every time MoM is brought up. "Don't worry about winning" is not a valid response to a game balance question. 
---
You are as bad as the killer mains in NOED threads saying "JuST dO ToTEmS lolol".
---
I'm not sure if it's a stupid question at all, so I'll ask anyway:  
---
How do you guys get used to looping? Sometimes I'm being chased and I feel so lost. Sometimes I create a route in my head and it works very well.  
---
But sometimes... There will be no pallets, no windows, NOTHING close to where I am. What exactly you guys do to make your chases more consistents?  
---
I am personally always doing good in gen repairing, totem cleansing and altruistic actions, but the chases sometimes just get me f\*'d
---
lOl rrr///wHoOOoSH
---
Well... as survivor sometimes there is a bug that will make appear, for the whole game, the 'wiggle' bar and during the whole match the character will suddenly stop moving, just like you said, for a split second. Maybe its the same problem.
---
With the right add-ons, he's decent. That's about it. Considering the "right add-ons" make other killers straight up nonsense sometimes, that isn't much by comparison. 
---
He can be strong late-game however.
---
Yeah, I agree but I see some huntresses than legion.
---
It was the thread right before yours on the list. I think it is sorted now though as I am back on.

Same here

Fair enough. Once you get the hang of him I think he‚Äôs fun!
---
Now if you excuesse me, i have to take of my shirt and walk into this mysteries fog that appeared, inside this bar !
---
I know that's what I'm saying is that I didn't actually move it just looks like I did
---
I had his happen to me the other day where I went Michael and a hillbilly was in the game too. Survivors and me/hillbilly were very confused, billy was able to use my ebony, my stalk function and flashlights were broken, etc. I also didn‚Äôt get all of my blood points for some reason (maxed out every category with survivors farming, only got 15k)
---
&gt; I think survivors need an op perk
---
No one needs an OP anything.
---
&gt; Plenty of killers countered ds by dribbling..
---
1) Dribbling doesn't stop DS from activating eventually. You're not always going to be close enough for that
---
2) Doesn't work on the other people using DS who aren't the obsession and surprise you
---
This must be a PC thing. Because I get a diverse range of killers on ps4..
---
Yeah lol, one time the textures for the birds didn't load in for me so they were all just white. And another time the grass textures didn't load in, so it was just white blobs on the ground
---
Yeah same :/
---
Spirit is well balanced as she requires skill to play and she can be mindgamed easily. If they have spirit fury drop the pallet early. MoM is annoying but it‚Äôs just one hit üòâ, also they need to fix legion and Freddy. Don‚Äôt forget about poor Freddy.
---
Lmao later dude
---
You weren't monitoring them very well if they managed to do that to begin with though. 
---
Insidious will never be a good perk on anyone because it is literally the act of doing nothing. Playing killer well requires constant action.
---
Lameee
---
K
---
Yes a dev commented in a previous post that they‚Äôre aware and are working on it.
---
Kind of, you moved but it took a second for the data to transmit.
---
You should never slow vault in this situation. It has a place, but this isn't it
---
Been like this for the past 2 hours.
---
i love these kinds of posts
---
LF from the sounds of it
---
It's super nice for getting blood points. I need to finish leveling him to unlock the teachable version, but I don't play enough killer and I end up using the blood points on my survs.
---
Hide in a locker, I always end up the obsession and Ash has a perk that let's then killer see him over distances.
---
Impressive. This is realy good, tnx u.
---
What can I do to adress this? It's true and a lot people agree at that. Nothing more to say.
---
Yea, I just got confused by the insta down cuz I couldn‚Äôt see.
---
Oh we are debating this. 
---
I stepped away to dreamstates someone else. And I needed to recover chasing them as I didnt see there aura but I knew they were close
---
Are the servers down on PS4??? Was playing just fine and now I can‚Äôt log into the game, it kicked me all the way out to the main login menu? My internet is fine can play other games. Error code 8018 cannot connect to online services?
---
How can someone has 1200 hours and complain about spirit...
---
I mean, it would make sense, considering nobody would really be able to live in the world Bill Overbeck came from.
---
When the killer be using NOED
---
These are my favorite because whenever somebody does this I know we're losing a toxic community member lol
---
Just about every recent survivor nerf has been justified, and they even just got buffed again with recent pallet changes adding more overall pallets in most maps. Exhaustion and healing changes were both needed, as well as the d strike nerf. Killer is ‚Äúeasier‚Äù than ever before, but that‚Äôs only because the game is much more balanced than a year ago.
---
every game across the board will have some issue whether it is a OP character or a glitchy map never understand why people get so angry about it.
---
It‚Äôs a friendly hello and I normally do 1 teabag after being healed or after helping someone saying ty or Yw
---
&gt; \- A player who mains a certain killer who uses add-ons, offerings &amp; tactics that are part of the game and meant to be used
---
FTFY
---
Then you either have to carry a med kit or run self care, which limit your options.
---
I don‚Äôt blame ya :p  LF sounds are funny that‚Äôs how I noticed.
---
well, you won't be missed, bb
---
Ok thank god üòÖ I was worried
---
That and it's not like WGLF and it doesnt give bonus points. Only the normal amount at a faster rate.
---
I think the point is that the survivor has already fully recovered besides the "find help" amount. If in reading correctly your example is that they run towards a teammate who is on the ground without nobody else but the killer around? I've done this to great success, you up them, body block a hit, then run
---
Datamined content could have been put in the game for any number of reasons, and without being the devs at BHVR we don't know if its just to test certain things out, or what. So basically we don't even know if it will be released, let alone when it would be.
---
&gt; But sometimes... There will be no pallets, no windows, NOTHING close to where I am.
---
And sometimes it's just a pallet city. This is one of the issues with map spawns right now - pallets being RNG based and you can easily get crazy dead zones or Palletville, USA. I don't know how feasible it is, but ScottJund suggested that each map should have like 4 or 5 pre-made spawns to avoid this. 
---
Anyway, before you start doing anything, take stock of what's around you and make a plan. That's really all you can do. Because of the RNG nature of map spawns and because you can't control how your team uses pallets, you could get caught in a bad spot.
---
Use Dead Hard or something like Windows of Opportunity.

Just kidding. Same.

It kicked me out about 15mins who on PS4 staying it can‚Äôt connect and a error code 8018 on PS4. I can play other games online just fine. Damn you BhVR I‚Äôm bored at work!

And all of those killers get punished by mom. People who play wraith over billy are already putting themselves at a disadvantage, and mom just widens that gap
---
For survivor focus on 3 things to slowly remove the starch from the potato.  
---
1. Get to the point if you're not there already where you can hit a good skillcheck automatically.  Few things are as frustrating as watching a survivor blow up your gen or considerably worse your heal.  Goods get mindlessly easy to hit with little practice.  Once they're automatic start practicing greats so you can ignore Ruin.
---
2. Only provide intelligent safe unhooks.  Unless you know the killer is nowhere around don't just sprint right up to the hook.  Be smart about your approach and provide friendly safe unhooks for your teamates.  Farmers on are side are the equivalent of facecampers on their side.
---
3. So you are a gen jockey God and your altruism is on point.  It's time to learn how to handle yourself in a chase.  Learn how to pallet loop and run window tiles properly.  Hug the corners of the loop as tight as possible to extend your loops and only toss the pallet when you have to.  Always rotate your camera mid loop so you can change direction in time if they attempt mindgames.  And NEVER just run up to a pallet and sit there.  This is the worst thing you can do in a chase and only serves to help the killer.  Watch Monto, Puppers, Noob, hell even Truetalent is learning how to loop now.  Tons of videos on YouTube to help learn how to loop.  It gets easier every game with practice.  Eventually you get to the point where you can bait out their respects and keep running to create additional loops.
---
We all start off potatoes but have it in us to become delicious perfectly seasoned french fries for the entire team to enjoy.
---
Been trying to find a match for the last 20 minutes I guess this explains it
---
I love Dead Meat. James is so darn lovable. And I love how he‚Äôs actually normal - not a misogynist or homophobe or racist, like his words actually are open minded and fair.
---
Oh my god you guys are just reaching for straws now. Oh no you might have to use a common item.
---
You are the biggest idiot ever. I mean cmon, i know MOM is strong but you can easily counter it. Just walk away and find someone else and if you are running nurses calling try catch them off guard before they get the heal lol. Legion is getting changed so i dont understand why you are crying like a little girl when we all know he is getting the rework. Spirit is one of the highest skill killers in this game and she is super strong but u need to know how to play her. Someone must have just outclassed u in game and you are a whiney little girl who is looking for attention on reddit because u think you are better than everyone. Thank you for leaving DBD, people like you are terrible for the game and no one wants you here. Bye kiddo.
---
Exactly.
---
As a killer i'd say leave my devour hope alone.
---
As a survivor i'd say it's worth to risk it.
---
Oh no, I already know the copypasta. That's my screenshot, if you look close.
---
That's perfectly normal, no matter how much we try, sometimes it's impossible to remove personal biased from an opinion. I really dislike tom cruise, especially because of all that Scientology stuff and him trying to steal his kid away, so I don't even give his movies a chance
---
yeah it's kinda a give and take scenario just try to make see if you can cleanse it when know ones being chased or do what I do and hope it is to watch my friend go down :)
---
Okay well you just encouraged everyone else to do this, so if you get facecamped in your next 100000 games, don't you dare fucking uninstall or even complain once to the killer even once "play how you want" after all am I right?
---
Also all legion players go in the same bucket of fucking morons who play killers that require 0 skill, only noobs enjoy playing vs legion because their chases finally last longer than 5 seconds.
---
The only real suggestion I can give you is try avoiding the cleanse, if you don't know the hex, while someone is in a chase. Otherwise it's mostly educated guess based on the killer you are against and the pool of ranks you are with.
---
"A lot of people agree" is not a counter argument. I want to know why you need baseline Kindred in light of my argument that:
---
1) the game is about pros and cons
---
2) if you rally feel like you need it, you have access to it
---
3) not having baseline kindred serves a game balance purpose
---
"other people also complain on forums" does not address any of that
---
I think it's because she blends in really well so people who aren't very good at the game pick her, and then proceed to just hide and not do anything.
---
I play with friends a lot so I might just do that to piss them off lol
---
Nooooo BhVR I‚Äôm bored at work!!!!
---
To true
---
Thanks a lot for the tips :D  
---
I'll try to make a plan before taking any sort of actions (healing/cleansing totems/gens) and I'll level up David for Dead Hard.  
---
Thanks again!
---
&gt;I don't need you to explain to me anything, I legit think you're all assholes for merely using a website like this so don't bother there's a 0.0001% chance I'll respect your opinion.
---
You are not alone my friend
---
First of all, he got hooked... the notification popped up that he got hooked. The animation has to got to the struggle state before sacrifice when there is someone still alive.... plus there was no progress bar at the bottom left icon plus. How the fuck can I get to the hook from far way after they got hooked immediately. You. Are. Cancelled.
---
No BBQ as always, Mettle Of Man because fuck you survivors get their version of BBQ and Chili (Great perk, in any build) while killers have been waiting for over TWO YEARS.
---
Holy I just changed my name and thought that was the reason thank god
---
Sure.
---
They could. None of these people are from 2008 onward. Maybe Quentin but ANOES never specified a year

*Nurse mains approve of this message*
---
Mine is down as well ;-( and yes we know it‚Äôs on your end, since I can play other games I own just fine online!
---
Wow I thought I would be the only one lol. same problem on ps4. I tried everything but not a controller change. I also experience this as survivor. Im holding down L1 and he walks normal speed. Strange thing is i face this problem only since legion release. I hope it will dissapear somehow bcoz i dont know what the f* I can do.
---
Thank you, redditor. I don't know if it makes a difference, I'm on mobile?
---
Testing it turned out to be a pain in the ass.
---
If only that were true.
---
In reality it's just another 12 year old throwing a tantrum and then getting back to the game.

Gag, I was wondering.

"Do you wanna get high?" - Towelie

Lol bye, you wont be missed
---
Actually I will, not by some f@gg0t who only sits on reddit all day and doesnt even play the game but yeah by people who do play they'll lose a good teammate and a respectable survivor.
---
What killer should I assume could have haunted ground? Other than the spirit of course
---
We get it your dicks small doesn‚Äôt mean you have to get pissed about it
---
You reached first with the heal 99%
---
I cant cosign on any of that. But Ill take your word for it.
---
Icing on the cake was the DC
---
I think it helped you didn't really bump into each other.
---
How can someone have 200 hours and think their dumbfuck opinion is relevant enough to press the "post"-button?
---
....because they are injured. Its simple math.
---
True
---
It's not a glitch like the add ons it's a game mechanic, you can't ban people for something that the developers implemented themselves even if it isn't intentional
---
Also, using the hue slider can push the colors into a different color family, so blood and scratch marks can turn sort of bluish.  If you have a color aberration, that may help you a lot.  At least until BHVR finally adds a color. Blind mode after 3 years or so.
---
One time when I was doing a dull totem I had text on the side of the screen telling me that thrill of the hunt was active. Howver a couple nights ago I was doing a hex totem and I didn't get a notification for thrill of the hunt even though the killer had it. Why is this?
---
Every last one of you saying "THIS IS GUD!!!"  and yet slam AngryPug's ban video need to stop being such hypocrites.
---
Scriggity scrotum, I‚Äôm coming for that totem.
---
Ohhh okay haha
---
The PC version is likely a safe haven from the kiddies. But console version definitely has a lot of children playing. I play on both platforms.
---
So why do you even post here if you don't bother to read our opinions? Dude, just leave already.
---
If that's how you feel then why are you here?
---
I remember. He wasn't the last to get hooked. I was already far away and teammates made mistakes. I played this whole trail and not you. You are cancelled.
---
Nea‚Äôs backpack would be rad. Also the Meg leggings with the floral pattern on the sides.
---
It's especially important to do this on the Shelter Woods map.
---
Just cleanse it. Be immersed for a minute and its gone
---
Not wrong, nor rude nor toxic. It's your way of playing. :D  
---
It is annoying as fuck indeed, but so are survivors doing gen rush.

Don't worry, my friend changed his name over the weekend and he could play fine until today
---
To educate you fucking retards, if you have a fucking brain you can see the truth in what I said, but I don't need some fucking retards to talk back to me especially some fucking 200 hour redditnoob.
---
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent üòÇ
---
I got all sorts of toxic shit done to me as a survivor. I stood there and endured it like a brainless person you think I am. Guess, I'm that stupid.
---
Is it frustrating to get camped and tunneled? Yes. 
---
Do I DC because of it? No.
---
On one hand it's a good counter to Gen rush and for the survivors who don't bother cleansing totems, on the other hand I think it's an unfair crutch perk. Up to you really.
---
&gt; You reached first with the heal 99%
---
How is that a reach? It's literally what everyone who plays MoM does haha anyone who doesn't just hasn't had it cross their mind yet
---
&gt; Would you prefer if they treated it like a BT status?
---
I think survivors should not have uncounterable perks that force an error on the killer they did not commit
---
Just got error 8015, but got in after about 3 attempts, if anyone else is having problems just keep trying
---
Why does your retarded ass post anywhere?
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve loved a repose as much as I loved this one before lol
---
Well, this has been a super successful post, so the actual context for this image, in case anyone was wondering, was this:
---
I was playing in a 2-Man SWF, and when we both died, we realized we could use the new copypasta I threw that into the chat as the killer came in. He slammed it shut immediately after the screenshot, which I should have probably also clipped.
---
The username in this is "sans/Review: [GLHF!]"
---
Hope everyone had fun speculating! It's a great copypasta.
---
Cleanse it if nobody is being chased, then stealth until the timer runs out.
---
Thanks! now i read the perks and they arent fun to play with, yea probably they would need tweaks, but thanks for being moe retairler.
---
Oh no..... okay so, add me my username is Venus, my icon is a Sailor Moon one
---
Thank you for the laugh good sir
---
Weeds are on swamp not that map. Thats bamboo
---
0.0001%...soooo you are telling me there is a chance!  I like this guy :)
---
I liked that so much I tried to give the match a 5 rating on my screen. XD
---
You're welcome, your gonna like it :)
---
Bye bye
---
Hex: Be Immersed - the perk
---
In both posts OP said that the downed survivors are already being healed by a third player.
---
People who run that way are just fools that want to get the killer of their back so they can go back to the M1 simulator.
---
Oh no, however will we survive without the infamous /u/Editnvmthisguyhrpdrp ?! They've been a staple of this community for the entire ~50 minutes their account has existed?! 
---
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS EVERYONE, THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, THIS ISN't A DRILL!

---
Look around if you find a hex totem. If you're under the effect of a hex, cleanse it, if not, it might be Devour Hope so go and see if there are any other hex totems. If there are 3+ totems lit, and you don't know what the hex is, it's probably Haunted Grounds with Devour Hope.
---
Look man, im not debating whether or not you were camping. 
---
I'm going 100% off your title. You are the one trying to justify camping with racism that you didnt know existed until after the fact.
---
like i said, whether or not you actually camped, is a completely different conversation. but you didnt want to have this convo, according to your title, you wanted to know about racism and camping.
---
Cleansing any totem with Hex: Thrill of the Hunt active will show you that the Killer has ToTH. 
---
As to why it didn't show up, it's probably just a bug tbh.
---
No you got camped once or twice in a row, try 10000 times in a row, see how your "just play how you want good sir killer, let me suck your dick while im at it"-attitude will change then.
---
Thanks forgot what it was called
---
Yeah 1200 hours actually moron, what do you got 50?
---
A perfectly balanced game is probably the goal of most multiplayer game devs, even if it is extremely unobtainable.
---
You can earn Legion in game, with in-game currency. With 1200 hours you should have enough to get him for free, so you know the game is "earn to win". The more you earn, the better your loadouts, the more you win :)
---
Close the door behind you.
---
Then what makes you think posting your opinion will do anything? We don't want you here anyway to fack off
---
Lockers block that aura like all others though, right? Also, just heal to 99% so you don't trigger it and you can basically insta heal as needed.
---
Also this exploit is pretty nasty because when you join the lobby as a survivor, game will start with only 3 players and when you join there will be 2 killers.
---
Will I be sentenced to death if I told you that I use Corrupt Intervention on my Legion?
---
If there is no ruin or lullaby I would say keep the totem location in mind and wait a bit to see if any effects typical of hex perks happens. For example if after 3 rescues or more you all suffer exposed, you know it‚Äôs devour hope and so you can cleanse it for definite positive effects on the game - removing exposed. If you get hit and get blindness, you know it‚Äôs third seal so after getting rescued/escaping, head over to the totem and cleanse it. Worst case scenario is when they‚Äôve got haunted grounds on top of other hex perks, which is really bad luck. However with this there will be a few hex totems in the map, so if you are seeing a bunch of hex totems and there is no ruin or lullaby, there is a high chance of haunted grounds, so only try and cleanse if you absolutely have too. Hope this helps üëçüèª
---
&gt;If survivors did anything close to this, the subreddit would literally be ripping their own ovaries out in anger.
---
You act like survivors exploiting stuff in the game hasn't happened before, I mean, like back when survivors were abusing infinite loops so long ago? or unreachable spots? or making killers get stucked at certain map points?
---
Won't happen, they will just patch it... at some point... maybe in a year.
---
Lmao copy paste. Be original at least
---
OldDS,jpg
---
It‚Äôs not bamboo. It‚Äôs really muscular grass
---
Is he holding a bread xD

Thank God everyone came to the conclusion that camping is worse than racial spots otherwise you your comment wouldn't make sense.
---
fack off with the a to make sure that everyone knows im definitly under 18 and probably a mongoloid

Same cant connect to servers

True lmao

You are also using this website...

"I don't need you to explain to me anything, I legit think you're all assholes for merely using a website like this so don't bother there's a 0.0001% chance I'll respect your opinion."
---
- a decisive strike, adrenaline, dead hard, flashlight using, survivor.
---
Just making sure everyone realizes who is grieving and downvoted players cause of their flair.
---
see what i did there?
---
First check to see if ruin is in game, if not, I'd leave it alone, but remember where it is.  Thrill of the hunt doesn't matter if thats the only hex perk,  and lullaby and devour hope aren't important until about 3 hooks.  When people are getting instadowned, go for the totem.  If they have two hex perks, take your chances. If you get unlucky, avoid the hell out of the killer.  Afterwards, the killer is playing with 3 perks.
---
Not the litlte petty "downvote everything I don't like"-cancer way you fucking mongols do. I just create a new account let my voice be heard and ditch this shtihole.
---
I got in twice but got disconnected while searching for match both times
---
Rofl
---
No prob
---
1st because I have the most fun with her. But if thinking effectiveness then 2nd.
---
Right behind myers. So like 4th
---
Your reddit account genius. And I seriously doubt you have 1,200 hours in DbD either. The way you rant, it has to be closer to 12.
---
It's cute!
---
It‚Äôs my birthday today lol - I just wanted to play dbd but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Shes tossed into the top 5 for sure. It usually goes nurse, billy, huntress/spirit, myers.
---
I often teabag other survivors at the beginning to say hello and to get the reunited points.
---
Ah, I see. But why don't you just use the emotes provided?
---
You're so insistent on your "1200" hours that honestly don't mean alot, I've met many players in many games who are dogshit despite having thousands of hours, and I'd honestly bet you're one of them.
---
What about if they changed it to everytime you are hit? Do you think that would that make it better or worse?
---
Yup me too. Did the tutorials first though as i haven‚Äôt played in ages which gave me a false sense of security
---
If you are literally going to claim it's a mechanic when we all know it's not, you are insane.
---
She can be top tier in the right hands. Unfortunately an little change they do with sounds can really affect her effectiveness.
---
On the topic of 3 gens, I played a game as legion on the game and got a 3 gen in the bathroom but the other two were so close, I could stand in the center and have my TR affect all of them. It was disgusting
---
And if you reported people that did that, they got banned. I vividly remember, especially the making killers get stuck part.
---
Hypocrites.
---
Yeah, I don't think he was ever on the list, I was mistaken. I assumed that the trip out to BHVR was for Fog Whisperers. Just a simple misunderstanding lol. I agree though, I think certain behaviors (pun intended) shouldn't be rewarded by the devs, and giving a certain someone that title might reinforce shitty attitudes in game lol.
---
V the survivor?
---
Na fak u 
---
-The devs
---
Lol he's checking everyones profiles. I think we might have gotten his ego guys...oops.
---
&gt;I legit think you're all assholes for merely using a website like this
---
Yet, here you are. Funny.
---
Yep you missed some stuff
---
Who gives a shit about my reddit-account? When you sound like a fucking moron but you dont wanna admit it. "Closer to 12 padum-tsss" fucking kys.
---
This behind Nurse and Hillbilly for me. But she's my best killer and the most fun one to me.
---
NUT
---
&gt; you see someone in the distance on the floor **being healed**
---
What the 2 they provided, the point and follow? Those are not much to work with, plus the teabag looks funny. I wish they would add more or at least put on a proxy voice chat.
---
Sitting in a locker while someone bleeds out on the ground is soooo fun
---
Yeah... TIL I'm illiterate
---
r/imverybadass
---
where is mobile version of mommy spirit please im thorsty
---
probs unpopular opinion; but I think there should be some kind of hatch displacement things. In the sense of, when a survivor is within x range of hatch for x amount of time, the hatch vanishes and reappears somewhere else on the map. And I say this as a very exhausted survivor main who is tired of dying because a teammate decides the only option in life is to camp the hatch or hide until it appears and then camp. Shit like this is why I only play swf now. At least I know my friends will actually do shit.
---
Okay :)
---
TL;DR: i am upset there are counters to counters and my brain cannot comprehend strategy or mind games, or that maybe i just suck because everyone else seems to be able to live longer than me and 4k with killers i dont know how to use. i am toxic and everything should be easy in this game but since it requires brainpower i hate it &gt;:(
---
If he's holding the bat by the opposite end anyone can tell him he's doing it wrong. And wtf is even "1200 baseball" Is your small dick trying to get hard because you have a lot of hours?? Get a life you virgin
---
It's only worth it if you really enjoy the cosmetics.
---
If the chance to increase good items is actually true, it's really unclear if it even increases it by enough to be remotely worth the millions of BP it takes to prestige to 3.
---
It would be wrong to use it and anything but an endgame perk. I wouldn't worry about being rude, though. The survivors have the ability to make sure it never activates by cleansing your totems.
---
You can listen for sounds or spend almost the exact same amount of time just walking away from where you believe they are while having M&amp;A so you can reveal their aura. 
---
It's a trash perk on literally every killer. Lol Leatherface and Freddy just have niche things they can do with it. But it still ain't good.
---
Cleanse it and hide or if you take the gamble and assume they arent runing devour hope.
---
Yes they do, you can get it down to a 3 sec transition with Z Block and Red Brush.
---
if you really are leaving, good riddance.
---
Lmao
---
A Ghost Face cosmetic set for Legion would be nice, unless they figure out a good idea for a new Killer power.
---
That would be pretty sweet. The only thing I don't like about bbq is when I hook someone I know when people are near so I'll take a look around before checking some gens and man does that make me a terrible camper to most survs lol.

To the commenter: Welcome to the game and this sub. You're gonna become really familiar with these types of posts if you browse by new or the steam forums. We're not all this bad, I promise.

That's not nice, I like fortnite, leave it out of this :p

You're getting worked up over a game of glorified hide and seek dude. Chill.

Jokes on you, I'm only half mongoloid.
---
I thought it was just me at first too, it‚Äôs my day off and all three games I‚Äôm trying to play have their servers down -__-
---
Lol ok buddy don‚Äôt get so triggered over literally nothing
---
Lmao this is adorable
---
You sound gay ish
---
Having played a lot of ranked games, I know that killers have higher win ratio compared to survivors.
---
These are hard facts, DBD devs would also have the statistics. The game needs to be balanced for the majority of players.
---
And there's a good compromise - those who play as friends and use mics to co-ordinate the game efficiently can utilize the invite-only friends lobby, wherein settings for survivors will be left as they currently are.
---
Yeah 3 gens can be extremely disgusting because you just *know* that you can easily give up a chase because they will come back, so mistakes are easily forgiven.
---
that perk combo gives them an easy time doing gens and a hard time getting out. survivors get mad because they think its supposed to be a hard time doing gens and an easy time getting out but since your focus is on endgame they will probably gen rush and your loadout will even out the trial. if they get mad ab it its cuz they were potatoes who played bad and had a hard time gen rushing a killer w no active perks until endgame
---
You're talking about pro players, most players in public games don't play that efficiently, and the stats themselves can give you the truth: killers have way higher ratio of wins over survivors.
---
Therefore, the general ranked lobby needs to be balanced to work for an average player.
---
That's because hillbilly is a copyright free version of leatherface. He was made way before they ever thought the game would become this big as to where they can actually just get leatherface
---
Ok? Pay2win? U dead ass can get any perk even from licensed killers/survivors using Iridescent Shards which if u have played "1200" hours u should have plenty of Shards to buy every perk that pops up in the shrine LET ALONE enough to buy all the unlicensed killers/survivors. That's all perks and over half the characters that u DONT HAVE TO BUY. 
---
Legions getting a rework so calm ur little 12yr old middle school teenaged drama bull shit kid. 
---
Idk if ur being serious about Spirit or not but u must've just had a bad game or something and decided to throw a baby tantrum on here, every killer on the game can use those perks so idk why exactly ur just complaining about her using them.
---
And as for ur little  "I think your asswholes for merely using the site"... Are u serious? Like are u dead ass serious? U just called urself an asswhole.. such a idiot. U need to grow up, and yes I read the comment where u said u would just make a new account if u get down voted but if ur just gonna keep making posts like this and typing comments just the same then u might as well make plenty of backup profiles cause every one of then will be down voted. 
---
Anyway it's prolly a good thing if a little baby like u leaves the community. The less toxic ppl the better.
---
I'm so glad those kids will now get punished for missing frenzy swings. Pretty good idea imo.
---
‚ÄúI understand that, it‚Äôs the simple fact that I did not, again I did not see the meme. Okay? I don‚Äôt understand why me commenting on a different post the same day guarantees that I‚Äôd have seen the other post. Lots of people had the same idea, again the user mentioned previously being one of them, I don‚Äôt see why you have to pick me out like a cunt.‚Äù 
---
There‚Äôs a very high chance of you seeing it if you were on the subreddit that day but I guess you conveniently sorted by new that day but didn‚Äôt scroll long enough to find it and did go on your home page at all how convenient. 
---
Only 3 people had the same idea the original, you and thedankdwight I‚Äôm not gonna count the original since he‚Äôs the first to come up with it thedankdwight admitted his wrongdoing and deleted the post without having an a long argument like what we‚Äôre doing now if he had denied it like you are doing right now I would‚Äôve continued arguing with him.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why you have to pick me out like a cunt.‚Äù I‚Äôm not picking you out your the only person besides thedankdwight who remade the meme but as I said thedankdwight deleted it. 
---
‚Äú ‚ÄúI probably saw it as the first thing under pinned messages.‚Äù So I see we‚Äôre just going to make assumptions just to try proving me wrong now, okay, that‚Äôs great.‚Äù
---
I was making an assumption based on how many upvotes it got and you being on the same day as it but conveniently you somehow didn‚Äôt see it.
---
The part ‚ÄúIf you have a speck of maturity (which I highly doubt, considering you‚Äôve already made false accusations about me because of a meme on the internet)‚Äù  Ironic the person saying this is making an assumption and later on used the mocking text (‚ÄúyOu HaVe To HaVe SaW tHiS mEmE‚Äô or ‚ÄòrEmAkIng FoR kArMa‚Äù)
---
‚ÄúHe states that he didn‚Äôt see the meme and neither did I. We both had the same idea. No, he is not in the wrong.‚Äù
---
He just says that you both had the same idea also he did see the meme because he commented on it.

‚ÄúWith your way of thinking, if there was a Legion meme posted on this sub, then anyone else who posted a different Legion meme after it, is remaking a meme for karma and they have to have seen the first Legion meme ever posted.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs the most idiotic thing I‚Äôve heard. The meme you made is a blatant copy of the original if you used the same format and let‚Äôs say hag was asking the same question and the killers said you give us hex ruin I wouldn‚Äôt mind that since it‚Äôs a different meme but your meme is just a copy you can try to deny it buts that‚Äôs the truth. 
---
‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt respond to anymore of my comments, it‚Äôs incredibly sad you got mad about me making this meme in the first place. The fact the only two things you resort to saying are ‚ÄòyOu HaVe To HaVe SaW tHiS mEmE‚Äô or ‚ÄòrEmAkIng FoR kArMa‚Äô really says a lot, besides the false accusations your entire argument stems upon.‚Äù

I am free to respond to any comment I want feel free to not respond. it‚Äôs incredibly sad you‚Äôre making the assumption that I‚Äôm mad because I‚Äôm calling you out for stealing and the only things you can do is to try to call me immature or be a hypocrite and assume I‚Äôm mad.
---
The servers are down rn they've been for about 3 hours now
---
I'm very happy that the timer doesn't go down when in the terror radius now. That's the best change they could've made. Him being 115% will help end chases faster without having to rely on feral frenzy. 
---
It'll take a little bit to get used to but I'm very happy with the changes so far. Legion might be fun to play against soon.
---
Huntress isnt in the top 5 though
---
There's a difference between mutual trashtalk for fun that happened on Xbox Live and toxic survivors going out of their way to send you a message to mock you
---
i know its tough (and i feel u bc i just got reset to rank 15 surv) but in these ranks everyone is a potato. its godawful. dont make it your goal to live but make it your goal to pip. dont play for the good of the team play for the good of yourself till you rise up to better ranks. i swear by rank 12 and lower its much better. this is a time to maybe mess around a little bit and go for those difficult achievements or try new builds while you still can.
---
Legion has a bug where, if you run the Vile Blade and the Nasty Blade, every time you tag somebody it will multiply the Mend Timer.
---
By the end of a match it'll end up taking 5 minutes or so to mend.
---
Today, the devs said they'd ban anybody who abused this.
---
It IS your bad, your communication level and the anger you try to hide behind your copy-paste comments are rivaled by children that get mad and think you have wronged them in every way possible, while also mumbling bout how unfair everyone treats you.
---
It's not toxic but it's annoying in my opinion lol
---
The problem with legion was never getting the first hit...
---
If deep wound was affected by hitting your attacks, then it‚Äôs problematic that he gets to swing as much as he does. With these changes, that part doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Let us rejoice in the tears of Legion mains. For today is a glorious day.
---
I play a variety of killers, but Spirit is my go to "okay I'm being serious now" killer. She has a very rewarding power, and is just cool af all around.
---
With how much OP is trying to defend themselves, i would not be surprised they are one of those rare survivors that get found once while injured and assume the killer was tunneling them that round.
---
I like it, his power is a time water, but he gets normal movement speed
---
I don't think there's anything wrong with having a perk without a counter, or a weak one, in an asymmetrical game. 
---
The counter to a slugging killer is a single use perk that may or may not work; they may just slug the other survivor to come back after you. The counter to rancor is just don't get hit.
---
You can always use Franklin's to counter a medkit to try to stop the 99% healing.
---
I get a 4K almost every single match with Hillbilly.
---
Disconnect more. Let's ruin the game.
---
I think its good the changes but these all nerf him pretty bad to the point id never play him, not that I really did before. Frenzy rarely if ever allowed you to hit more than one person unless the survivors were dumb, this hasnt changed
---
Hitting the same person more than once does nothing now

So this is how a killer dies, right? Poor Legion got Freddy'd
---
I think its a fuck ton better than what we have right now though
---
if a killer slugs me instead of hooking and I know I'm not gonna find the hatch, I DC. The bp isn't worth waiting that long so the killers can masturbate to seeing me on the ground.

Didn't know that about the lockers, I have been playing him more as a distraction.

I kinda don‚Äôt wanna play legion because of this I don‚Äôt want to be accidentally banned

Oh well..

Lmfao what the fuck
---
ITT whiny legion players who are sad their broken killer isn't bullshit anymore.
---
I hate despise players like this! Justice was served
---
You have a bad game mate?
---
I love teh art, but you arent getting any internet points for this :)
---
Not that I believe you, but literally nobody is complaining about billy.
---
I feel that. I‚Äôm a new player so I want to upgrade as much as I can, but I can understand DCing if the killer is not hooking last survivor
---
So does changing your playstation name reset your progress and purchases? I've heard before that it does so I've been very hesitant to do so
---
I recently had a Claudette actively throwing rocks at me (while I was doing the last gen)... they got caught by the clown, but I made sure that was their last hook ;)
---
I agree. Frenzy sounds completely useless now and very difficult to achieve. One miss instantly depletes bar and you must wait for it to refill.
---
Holy damn, this is so mesmerizing. What did you use to make it?
---
You do realize that a.) You haven't played the legion changes, so you don't actually know how it plays and b.) They play test changes before they push out an update.
---
Yeah. If enough streamers bitch about a killer anything is possible. Can they all start bitching about Plague next?
---
&gt; You just can't down people anymore with it. What's the point of his power ?
---
Well with him moving at 115% now people will be a lot more likely to heal against him, so his power will actually waste time now if you get the chance to spread it at all.
---
I don't think you get it. You sound like a very naive person.
---
I never expected to see HotS on this sub! 
---
Heroes Hearth is the main social network for Heroes of the Storm, and since their Esports is all but dead, it's nice to see them branch out.
---
Alot of these changes are really nice but the fact that the deep wound timer doesn't go down if he hit in frenzy is not justified along with all the other change, this last change actually make him a really bad killer while most other change are good, this really feel like it's too much of a nerf.
---
Hope the PTB make them realize that they nerfed him too hard
---
My main issue with the timer not going down in Terror Radius is that it'd going to make Borrowed Time a living hell for Doctors.
---
yea i picked up a bunch of the dlc killers when they were on sale.   i'm grinding leatherface to get that bbq and chili  but he's just not that fun to use.  i had a fun standoff in my last game between 3 generators and 3 survivors left alive.  they needed 1 gen and i just kept phasing between the gens trying to snatch em up.  ended up getting 3 kills  1 got out via hatch.  
---
its juts fun to see the screen after with all these survivors with their purple perks.
---
and then there's my lvl 3 spirit with her 1 perk and 0 addons
---
LMAO THEY BASICALLY DELETED LEGION LOOOOOOOOL
---
Greet garbage just right Freddy and literally any other killer besides nerf, they have no freaking idea how to balance srsly, anything literally ANYTHING is better then this....
---
Xbox has an automated system to pick up profanity lel try again
---
My thought as well
---
I uninstalled the other day because the community on this game is hands down the worst of any game I've ever played with the DCs, toxicity, ruining each other's games intentionally, etc ( and I've played league, DotA, and battlefield so that's saying something). The devs are doing nothing about it and the fact that my post above simply saying it's wrong to intentionally sandbag a teammate got downvotef into Oblivion says all that needs said about how right that decision was.
---
Thank you so much devs, he seems actually bearable to play against now. 
---
The fact that feral frenzy hits doesn't make the timer go down further is fantastic.
---
Super coordinated SWF can also be cancer though, especially with MoM, yet nobody really believes they'll disable either. Legion was a paid DLC, so making them entirely unselectable would likely require them to refund or give huge gifts to make up for it. However, we will hear about the changes next week, so let's see what they have in mind.
---
And the perks from these aren't even that bad. Discordance is just information, and could be manipulated, plus most survivors don't do gens together early on.
---
Iron Maiden and Mad Grit are... meh. Their situations are so specific...
---
Plauge's Corrupt intervention is only really good for either funneling them into a smaller area or slowing the game down "Just a little bit", infectious fright is very specialized, and Dark Devotion is no more than a Tinkerer with no gen ping and requires you already being in chase
---
Nerfing their speed is the worse way to balance them imo, and it is balanced for the average player already. Look at pro players, most times survivors can escape
---
People said fix legion not nerf them into the damn ground
---
Dwight don't care about anybody, he's got a pizza to deliver. Wait, the pizza's already 30 minutes late, fuck you, Dwight.
---
Oh wait... i'm at work. What update?
---
Hes a real basic killer now, the power is only good if the survivors are looping a dropped pallet. Against injured people it does nothing.
---
The normal terror radius wont help either, legions frenzy only works well if hes close to the survivors when he starts his chase, survivors now get plenty of warning hes nearby.
---
Yeah. Only do it if you have nothing to lose, like a low BP game. The grind is really hard for new players so I understand not doing it.
---
Are you serious? Legion is broken now where as anyone that can play this game can get a 4K, now he will actually take some skill to play and you‚Äôre mad about it.
---
ü¶Ä Legion is gone ü¶Ä
---
I suppose it could also have been through an exploit. Though there's also the chance that he loaded in before everyone because he's the host
---
&gt;The Deep Wound timer pauses for survivors within The Killer's Terror Radius‚Äìregardless of whether they are in a chase or not.
---
But, what about insidious? can players still exploit it with that perk?
---
Legion was maybe the only way for killers to have a chance in this current bullshit meta.
---
Downvote me, I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm just sick of taking it in the ass from these devs who are more concerned with releasing DLC than fixing their broken ass spaghetti code game.
---
I‚Äôm gonna go play something else rather than be part of the Second Dark Age of this game. See ya!
---
Some of these changes are great. But a lot of this is overdone. BHVR went overboard with nerfs
---
I'm angry. Deep Wound is now actually useless, as is Feral Frenzy. You apply any kind of pressure to the survivor and the timer pauses. What's the fucking point any more? I was fine with all the changes up until that.
---
Why was it scrapped? Was there ever any official reason given?
---
I stopped reading once I read "mend timer stops when inside killer terror radius". Guess I'll never get the deranged pursuit achievement now.
---
Or they release the legion info now XD
---
You don't realize that a) out of 6h of play and watch time I can make clear assumptions! That you clearly lack b) the it to check if it FUN for suvivors... Only... Or they would bring out garbage like this, but this subreddit is a circlejerk anyways so what ever!
---
This is what im thinking but in that case why play legion? Just play any other m1 killer that has a power
---
Lol
---
Same as PC + The Hag and The Doctor
---
I have no idea what they‚Äôre doing at BHVR. Sounds like they had a list of complaints and implemented every single one. 
---
They buffed his movespeed though L O L 
---
Hey just go play some civilization
---
Freddy is still weaker. Doesn't have to wait 7 seconds to hit you with a basic attack, better map presence because frenzy lasts longer. Can't just pull people off hook in his face etc
---
Who are the two in the back? I know one is jake but is the other nea w her ‚Äúugly‚Äù hair on? Lol
---
I usually get around 12,000-15,000 bp but it‚Äôs only good for like 3-4 things which means I can‚Äôt complete the bloodweb to level up my Meg 
---
She‚Äôs only lvl 11 so it‚Äôs starting to get harder and harder to level up
---
No..... they nerfed every single aspect about feral frenzy while simultaneously giving Legion a tiny base speed increase. So yeah, I‚Äôm really glad I move a little bit faster, considering that there is absolutely no point in using feral frenzy now.
---
But hitting with his power twice the same survivor won't lower his deep wound status, thus making hitting the same survivor twice in a row while on frenzy pretty useless
---
You're meant to use it to apply it to lots of people.
---
&gt;Deep Wound still sounds stupid exploitable though. Using Insidious mid chase sounds like it'll be enough to cause pain. I also wonder how Dark Devotion on Legion will work out with this? Transfer the terror radius to the obsession and then frenzy someone and have the timer go down freely for a solid 10-15 seconds.
---
It says the bleedout stops when mending though so you can run to a pallet or window and start mending to stop the timer
---
Until after his supposed rework that‚Äôs coming, and then he too will be stronger than Legion.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that jumping over pallets/windows means you‚Äôll have to cancel your frenzy since hitting them in Frenzy does nothing if they have deep wound.
---
Goddamn he's terrible now. So if I'm reading this right, he can't down you with frenzy anymore. He also has to wait for his power to get full before using it(like spirit). He also likes his power if he misses(like nurse). So basically his power is just for you to get a free first hit kinda like wraith but without the element of surprise. He's Garbo.
---
Well yeah in my opinion based on the info he sounds like the second worst killer against good survivors. Leatherface and trapper might still be worse as well. Have to wait and see
---
While also making the legions terror radius bigger LMAO.
---
Yeah screw people who do that. Unless you‚Äôre friends. Then double screw them ü§£
---
So are they going to update the Deranged Pursuit achievement now that Legion can‚Äôt actually down people during Feral Frenzy?
---
Umm thats a weird title... You're mad at people who want to support the actual artist instead of some shithead who reposts it.
---

---
&gt; He was broken, and a lot of people played him because of that.
---
And that, to you...is a good thing?
---
Currently there would be a huge issue if they started doing punishments for dc's. There is a massive issue with the game and people keep getting kicked out against their will. If they made it so on top of that you get pushed for something that is out of your control then there would be a riot on their hands
---
&gt;When will this go live?
---
Read the whole post.
---
&gt; the movement speed would mean they'd be able to still play even without Frenzy.
---
So, another freddy?
---
The killer has to stop moving for insidious to be active, the survivor can just mend to pause the timer and then since insidious is active you cannot move without your terror radius becoming normal again.
---
i think your perk build is pretty much perfect
---
&gt; Legion was maybe the only way for killers to have a chance in this current bullshit meta.
---
LOL
---
So ill get bullied when i get to the single digit ranks im guessing
---
You can't report someone for bodyblocking lol the developers of this game even said that
---
Legitimate Strategy - just like "camping" is. Survivors do it to defend their friends and Killers "set up their camps" to protect their "kill".
---
Get over it.
---
Another buff to Borrowed Time.  Great.  Because it wasn‚Äôt annoying enough at the endgame.
---
Staying injured against 115 is a risky move but yeah frenzy sounds not worth it you may as well just hit them normally. Missing an attack ending the frenzy in particular sounds rough
---
When I play Myers, I specifically save my EW III for obsessions now because they most likely are running MoM.  You'll get your three hits...but it won't save you. lol
---
What rank? Guessing 18 or 17?
---
u/Dreadkeeper
---
I like to use Hope if I use Dead Hard because at the end game you need those clutch Dead Hards and Adrenaline exhaustion messes that up. I just wish it lasted longer because sometimes the end game can last a bit if you are trying to save people from the hook. 
---
Another perk that I have been having alot of fun with surprisingly is Jane's Poised. I've lost a few killers midchase because the perk will activate after someone completes a gen
---
Alert is also surprisingly useful in a chase because the killer will break the pallet and I can tell what direction the killer is moving 
---
Idk if those are off meta but Hope, Poised and Alert can be fun
---
I would agree with you if mending didn't pause within the terror radius. As long as the chase you're in is close enough to the survivor for them to still be in your terror radius (which is now bigger) they don't have to mend diddle or shit
---
To be fair. It was written in a slightly darker text haha.
---
Tell me how he was cancer?  
---
Moon walking? that shit was too rare.  
---
Most perks on legion are useless due to his power, this is further continued by making his power much more useless in a chase.
---
He is now a basic m1 killer now.
---
I‚Äôm just getting the connection error
---
Tryna do swf w my brother and we can‚Äôt even get into that menu. If we do, the lobby bugs and we can‚Äôt invite people üôÑ
---
Can you elaborate on that "skill" you mention?
---
You seem to be an expert.
---
Be careful doing this as it does count as working with the killer. Not that the Devs actually care though. Lol
---
My bet was correct.
---
Even just a basic Distressing makes this pretty nasty.  40 meters is still a pretty considerable TR.
---
I know if the timer doesn't go down why can't you see blood?
---
Im not going to argue about freddy, i think hes bad and most people agree.
---
It depends on the rank that you play Freddy on. 
---
High ranking players tend to be able to counter Freddy really well because he is very weak to being looped. That coupled with the inability to punish unsafe hook saves &amp; meta perks countering his dream state really harm Freddy.
---
At lower ranks Freddy is god tier. Players do not understand how to loop properly &amp; don't really know how to escape the dream world efficiently.
---
The perks you are using are decent;
---
- Freddy shines at end game as exit gates take much longer to open &amp; having amazing map awareness. Remember me was purely build to be used by Freddy &amp; works really well on him so is a great perk to have on him
---
- Sloppy is good for Freddy in that survivors spend more time injured. Being injured &amp; in the transition state is scary for survivors so they tend to feel pressured to heal whenever they get the chance which stalls the game
---
- BBQ is great for finding survivors outside of your dream world. Good bp gain
---
- Do not think spies of the shadows works with Freddy. Perk in itself is inconsistent as it relies on crow spawns &amp; with Freddy you do not really need tracking perks. Would suggest perks like Discordance or my personal favorite, Monitor &amp; abuse on Freddy.
---
- NOED would work amazingly well with remember me. Could allow you to 4k almost every end game using it correctly.
---
I‚Äôd need to look lol
---
This type of unbalanced nerf further solidifies my lack of faith in a freddy rework.   Completely 100% neutered his power.  May as well release the next killer as M1 killer only.
---
Hmm I'll choose eight perks. Overcharge, Brutal Strength, Stridor, and Iron Maiden for the killer perks. For survivor perks I'll choose Stake Out, Breakdown, Urban Evasion, and Ace in the Hole.
---
i have a couple times i just close the game and re open it
---
You're a joke. Also this isn't "news". Grow up kid.
---
That's fair.  I'm on the other side that sees him as being better than Clown or update Legion, but I acknowledge that he still needs some help.
---
Wow, did you just think that joke is still relevant in 2019?
---
to be fair half the community wanted to delete legion
---
So, he's just an M1 killer now?  
---
Good job making another unique killer completely useless, might as well play any other M1 killer, it's no different from the killer's perspective. Proof the game is made for survivors...
---
Not to gloat, but I am literally the smartest being to ever exist

Why did you buy it if you knew without playing that is was going to be shit?
---
Okay. Billy is healthy for the game because he can be countered while also having a useful power. 
---
The health of this game comes from variety. They have just killed yet another killer. Nobody likes getting shit on and if everyone is forced to play the same four killers, then killers will stop playing.

Did Legion need a change? Yes. Did Legion need to be annihilated into the ground? No. There are two or three actual changes that were needed for him.  
---
You realize that vaulting windows and pallets is useless now, right?
---
Absolutely :)
---
I think the miss attack thing shouldnt go through, legion will hit you once but after that they have to down you normally that seems fine
---
Would pay top dollar for every amazing piece of art triangle. True art.
---
Not that I agree with what OP is saying, but you didn't read the post. At least, not correctly.
---
I‚Äôm thinking about trying to farm with people to get it before the update. I know that‚Äôs a bs way to do it and borderline cheating but I too am unsure how to do it post update. 
---
It really should‚Äôve been down 25 people in feral frenzy so you have to keep chasing people down. That makes the most sense given the lore and power idk why they didn‚Äôt do it this way to begin with x-x
---
deathstrike2112. Not the best at the game but I try my best and consider myself very knowledgeable about the game.
---
But downing a survivor won't stop others from saving
---
you should tunnel but slug when you tunnel just so it gvie them an extra chance and it allows you to keep a map wide presence to create more map pressure
---
I think you misunderstood his post.
---
Yeah, this is just a giant nerf across the board, the only compensation they got was standard MS. 
---
This just makes Legion a super weak plague. Easy injures, still have to just W + M1 for downs except you don't get powered up range attack and your ability is on a huge cooldown.
---
Nea.
---
Greatest Pizza Boi, just let him deliver that pizza I'm hungry...
---
exactly i‚Äôm completely on board with this nerf. Legion is simply not fun to play against
---
Isn‚Äôt this sandbagging? lol
---
There is literally only one buff.
---
why is it always the P3 claudettes with urban evasion xD
---
&gt;Not to gloat, but I am literally the smartest being to ever exist
---
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bcgv04/developer_update_april_2019/ekqzt1j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Not really. People have literally been saying this since legion came out.
---
Yeah I think it's down for everyone any clue of when the servers will be back up
---
I doubt they'd care to be honest. I remember one of their first streams or videos about Dead by Daylight they put a huge emphasis on how they wanted the survivors to be stressed about whether or not their teammates would be altruistic and help them, or simply help themselves. I think situations like the above are what make the game fun and exciting sometimes.   
---
I'm sure there are some instances where people help the killer and it's really shitty, but in my case the Claudette had it coming ;p. I'm willing to risk getting reported to screw over an afk Claudette.
---
If I had to guess, it might be like Docs, where you had to get all 4 survs tier 3 madness in one match. Maybe have all four survivors in the deep wound effect at the same time?
---
&gt;So, another freddy?
---
I guess. Most of the killers seem to have over lapping elements.
---
 But Freddy is more of a wraith/doctor in that the ability is more focused on finding survivors easily and being able to stay on them. 
---
Even then, we don't know if that will stick because they'll be announcing the Freddy rework in a few more weeks. For all we know they could turn his ability right on its head and be completely different. The addons are also reworked from what I know for both of them, which would help differentiate them both even more..
---
Wut, did you not see the power massively nerfed? What about not being able to use it to down survivors?  
---
He's just a regular M1 killer now with a bit of extra flair.  
---
NOW, if you CAN down with frenzy, he might still be useful, but I doubt it.
---
But why not go more if you want a big TR? :P
---
Plus Calms + M&amp;A is quite fun. You go from a huge TR to basically none as you like mostly XD
---
Mend stops when in terror radius
---
Miss one hit in frenzy and its automatically done
---
Bigger terror radius to even counter the new mend change.
---
Frenzy hits doesnt progress the bar
---
You really dont got to play to see how bad it is cause you can easily imagine the scenarios
---
So what you are saying is: I din't need proof he is bad, I believe he is bad so he is bad. You sir don't deserve that refund.
---
Why do you not just mutually trashtalk back? If anything, replying like OP did SHOULD be considered mutual trashtalk (I originally thought that seeing the post for the first time, generally someone replies in a nice way to piss someone off further) and the guy 9/10 times would've just insulted them more.
---
Also, I don't care. I think if you get a "mean" message on the internet and show it off to other idiots on the internet then you're the epitome of sad and stupid.
---
Plus they may think you left and give a free hit.
---
good to hear i wasnt the only one
---
Holy crap they just Freddy'd him.
---
Like freddy id rather they make them shit that leave them annoying
---
Control your microaggressions and check your privilege
---
You know, there's a reason why you're rewarded more blood points for not ending the game right away. You aren't meant to down them with deep wound like someone else said. Just like how Freddy isn't meant to sit there and wait for a survivor to fall asleep after using his power. It is meant to disrupt the survivors and slow the game down. This is why Legion came with discordance, a really good perk to counter gen rush. He is meant to have long lasting games that tend to end with everyone getting at least a +1 pip.
---
They'll try. I mean, if you're good at the killer and know what you're doing, then any killer can be utilized. The best way to think it is that his ability doesn't help clear distance gaps and get a hit like Hillbilly, nurse, spirit, and clown.
---
Can they change an existing achievement/trophy though?
---
Take my downvote.
---
&gt; You realize that vaulting windows and pallets is useless now, right?
---
Again I don't fully grasp this, which was I (out of no animosity) asked for you to talk about it in the previous comment.
---
I know, I even said so in the comment.  It‚Äôs called a joke.
---
It stops everyone doing gens while you chase someone without frenzy.
---
Frenzy was never meant to be a chasing tool, it's for applying pressure.
---
That‚Äôs fine I‚Äôll add u
---
You could also think:
---
Ant terror radius perks
---
Don't be trash and hit people
---
Again anti terror radius perks
---
115% movement speed might help
---
You need proof for a claim to be taken seriously.
---
Small thing but it's driving me crazy. The dev listed Darkness Among Us as Chapter 11, but Demise of the Faithful was Chapter 11. Legion was Chapter 10.
---
I don't know how I feel about these changes. I feel like they gave Legion too many nerfs. I like the deep wound effect being tied to the terror radius, but then they increased their terror radius. I also think canceling Frenzy from a missed swing is way too much, on top of making it to where the bar has to be full to use. I think a missed attack should definitely knock time off, so they're not mindlessly swinging around trying to land a hit, but not fully cancel the power. Legion was, and definitely now is, too weak of a killer for all these nerfs, especially only giving one actual buff because the other buff is only an add on.
---
I think all he needed before was a longer exhaustion after 3 or 4 slashes to be honest.
---
Teabagging at those pallets, then uselessly throwing them around
---
...I‚Äôm honestly not sure if that. Being that there are times achievements were broken, I have to assume so, since something had to change to fix them? I‚Äôll look into it. If not, people who don‚Äôt have this achievement may want to start grinding for it before it becomes impossible! Lol
---
I‚Äôm a rank 19 survivor
---
what are you talking about?  [lol](https://media1.giphy.com/media/26DNh6nLbSNji14wU/source.gif)
---
Shit good point; thanks! I'll have to do that and repost lol
---
Except, unless the duration increase is MASSIVE, you will never get to hit more than 1 survivor unless they are really stupid or run at you.  
---
If they all just run away or have sprint burst, it will make the power useless to tagging multiple people.
---
Because NURSE IS THE ONLY WORKING KILLER. it's hard learn high reward, period! This game is dead of they do it.
---
Awesome, hope is definitely something I want to run more.
---
Wraith and freddy also have some element of surprise legion get nothing and frenzy sounds kinda hard to pull off now, you cant whiff or mess up at all
---
Lol I'm fine with that. This community hates legion so i don't think they'll be getting much sympathy.
---
It's like watching someone who abused you getting beat up by cops.
---
So he's a worse plague with no ranged attack.
---
Yeah. there are alot of people here that steal other dbd artists art. need to be careful around here lol
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôll be injured on gens during this time either so? Still helps keep people off gens.
---
It‚Äôs gonna take a bit before I can pass judgement but it does seem like a net nerf at first look. I mean, moving faster is cool definitely, but not being able to lower the timer with bonus frenzy hits seems a bit insane coupled with the loss of power on any missed swing. Following people after pallets is gonna suck cause you lose collision when you vault so people can just vault behind you and even if you do hit them, they won‚Äôt get put into Dying from it so they can just do it again until you miss or cancel, where they can vault the pallet again. 
---
Buffing Iridicent Button seems nice. I‚Äôm hype for it. 
---
I am very curious how the other addons will work now and what their achievement is going to be changed to. Since you can‚Äôt down anyone in Killer Instinct anymore, Deranged Pursuit is gonna have to change.
---
I got him long long ago. You misunderstood my messages, but my English is shit so sorry for that
---
The people most upset by this change are the legion players that used them to tunnel a single survivor to death with frenzy. Legion was meant to hit everyone to make them mend so they're not on gens, and those were also the legion games that weren't unfun to play against. Anyone that played Legion the way they were designed is unaffected by this and benefits from the 115 speed as well.
---
Yeah xD hate it when people do that camp in the locker while i have to so all the work
---
that's when hope resurrects in me and I got out the exit gate with everyone holding hands and skip juming like we're walking the golden brick road
---
Slugging exists. If you really think that hatch is a crutch and rewards people for playing badly, you really need to brush up on how you actually play the damn game. 
---
Also, what does it matter if they're a swf group? It has no bearing on how you should treat them as players. Grow up.
---
That update isn't coming out until the end of this month for the mid chapter patch. Shit goes down on PS4 all the time for this game, even though they don't have servers.
---
 fun to play against or not deep would is essentially useless now
---
You know who's the REAL worst teammate? The guy who holds on the hook for his 600 struggle points while I die standing on the about-to-open hatch
---
It's the second post in this reddit and in the DBD forum.
---
Feral frenzy attacks can't deal damage to the deep wounds timer anymore, there's your counterplay. Loop Legion like any other 115% killer
---
I rather deal with 20 pallets per match than wasting 5 minutes looking for immersed survivors.
---
Stealth in DBD is present and really useful. I use it to go past the killer unnoticed towards a generator, a totem or an unhook. Hide behind objects at certain moments to delay the beginning of a chase, buying time for other survivors to work on generators. 
---
Stealth doesn't necessarily mean you must escape every trial 100% undetected, this is boring for killers as DBD is a game of *Cat &amp; Mouse*. 
---
I hope devs **never** encourage stealth.
---
You mean the shrine that took DS like 2 years to be in it and BBQ and chili never even shows up, you mean that shrine? Also they'll nerf it a good 6 months after it showed up in the shrine and then the new "licensed survivor first one to have a decent perk after 7 unlicensed survivors with shit-tier perks came out" and repeat and repeat and repeat.
---
I've been playing against legion for 4 months, they finally admit that yeah the killer is braindead and boring, so instead of removing him untill he's fixed these terrible developers are gonna make me play vs them for another few months because why not? Also make sure to announce that he will be fixed soon so that all the dogshit legionmains getting undeserved BPs on a daily basis can quickly use up all their ebony mori's and other disgustingly moronic addons.
---
Both spirit and hag have the same problem that you need certain perks in order to stand a chance, everyone has urban evasion or flashlight vs hag? Easy fucking game. Nobody has it? Well good luck crawling out of her 17 traps before she actually came walking back, perks shouldn't be hard-counters to killers especially considering every new killer will make it harder to be prepared for every single killer. Same with iron will vs spirit.
---
Also you pussies would do well with more toxicity in your life, it's embarassing what offends you pussies nowadays you really need to build up some resistance.
---
Pretty sure it was on PC too. I remember experiencing it, except without the lag. Ruined my attempts to stealth/lose the killer.
---
Right. Dude is just worse Wraith now.
---
ü¶Ä LEGION IS GONE ü¶Ä
---
Devs responded in another thread saying they are aware of the issue and are working on it.
---
I think they need to increase the time it takes to mend so using the power is more beneficial
---
To be fair, while I agree that the changes were very harsh, this game...IS designed with 4 survivors and one killer in mind, every match..
---
Alright thank you!
---
Gonna give that solo build a shot right now!
---
What aspect of Billy would you change?
---
Isn‚Äôt mori a secret offering ?
---
Yes, because there was never any legitimate reason to DC against Legion.
---
But that‚Äôs not fair because their doing this change simply to appeal to the survivor mains
---
There are no pro players in this game it's not a real competitive game like that. You can definitely escape killers you just have to think about what you are doing and be smart. Use the killers red stain to know which way they are coming if you are using a jungle gym, don't always throw the pallet down right away try to loop it. Eventually you will have better teams, not always but still the higher rank you get the better for the most part. Killers will always catch up to you if you run out in the open
---
They increased FF duration, so you may be suprised.
---
I hope it's r/woooosh
---
It's fun for you, it's unfair for everyone else.
---
Yeah. I wanna hear actual fair evidence on these survivor nerfs. I get everybody in DbD has suffered some sort of nerf but not a lot for survivor comes to mind. At worst DS got nerfed but I don't really know what else.
---
I don't remember if I did comment on this or not but I am also a killer main and I just play survivor when I'm with friends. And I have no issue with body blocking whatsoever. Only t-bagging and flashlight spamming tilts me, but nothing else
---
Any vault juke that used to buy time, now cancels out the frenzy if they try to swing.
---
Running will be easier now, but you will still just go down to basic plays because of 115 MS.
---
Appealing to the survivor mains is usable what they do
---
Might as well play wraith and also get the added chase boost from windstorm.  
---
You will never hit more than 1 or 2 survivors at one with frenzy if they have discord or run the moment you get close., or aren't dumb enough to run into you.
---
Not to mention, it will still be easy to keep everyone in the injured state.
---
you have 6k hours with changes Legion?
---
Ah yes, the classic ‚Äúover powered players get angry when they aren‚Äôt given their power trip.‚Äù Happens so much in game development testing
---
I haven't played legion since going up against this and realizing it. I have stacked these blades before I knew about this bug. Also I thought this was a World of Warcraft meme until i saw the subreddit.
---
He gets the first one or two hits in easy and then is a basic M1 killer to down people.
---
I really don't see how it's comparable to Spirit or Billy.
---
Pls leave my bb Amanda alone
---
I‚Äôm sorry i had to ask what‚Äôs no2 ?
---
Exploit add‚Äìons ‚Äî and that's it.
---
Don't pretend to be stupid.
---
Yahoo BHVR shows once again they have no idea how to properly balance their game at the most intricate level! Sure they can make sure new perks aren't terribly OP, but they've show themselves MULTIPLE TIMES to be pathologically incapable of nerfing a killer without completely fucking destroying them.
---
It's basically all nerfs to a killer who is already very weak without using the cheese mechanics. Without the ability to see blood pools there's yet another perk they can't use.
---
This is why my dominoes never arrived
---
If you just camped the hatch I will gladly struggle. If you deserve it I‚Äôll die.
---
I‚Äôm happy. At least I can play him now without getting DC‚Äôd on
---
‚Äî and all you had to do was disconnect like a bitch against a low tier killer (every single time).
---
You cant see the jigsaw boxes until the trap is active.
---
Or anyone who paid money for something they enjoyed.
---
Hey, have you ever played against any killer that can only attack using M1? If yes then here is your counterplay to Legion
---
yea ur not a true man of culture.
---
This is the change I like to see. Thank you for deflecting his attack and reminding him that there is a person behind the character. You may have even swayed him from his toxic ways by reaponding as you did.
---
You are good and I hope you continue to do this. This post was quite inspiring.
---
Sounds like I will touch one of my favourite killers never again.. RIP
---
What do you guys think are the best perks and things to do when playing against the legion?
---
( I haven‚Äôt play against a legion yet as I stopped playing a bit after tapp and the pig came out)
---
Salty survivors ruin yet another of my favorite killers
---
Legion needed changes and bug fixes but this is way too far
---
Wow, you literally fucked Legion big time
---
Just beautiful... it's great to listen to whiny people and completely ruin a killer that only needed few tweaks and not huge nerfs. 
---
Great job so far.
---
I doubt it's like the minute long that it would need to be.
---
Imagine thinking so highly of your own play that you decide who deserves the hatch lol
---
You are calling Spirit, Nurse or Micheal M1.
---
We will just have to wait in see.
---
Ruin nurse + Mori, I would've DCed as well. 
---
You shouldn't report DCers btw. 
---
&gt;#UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT
---
&gt;* Disconnects (leaving the match before killed or sacrificed) - DO NOT REPORT
---
&gt;##ABOUT DISCONNECTS BANS - DO NOT REPORT
---
&gt;The escalation is now 1 week / 2 weeks / 4 weeks / Permananent ban
---
I hope you realize I was mocking at the players who whine about deranking survivors, but then again this is reddit so it's hard to take someone seriously lmao.
---
But for real, what kind of streamer will remain below the 12 rank and call themselves skilled when playing against babus and boosted survivors? Like come on, the stretch is tearing apart.
---
Honestly I follow a lot of streamers who remain on red ranks or even purple ranks, and they're called derankers by many on reddit but I'm like, watching them while vacuuming the floor and it's like "this is the bullying ppl complain about? teaching a boosted red rank killer what skill really is?".
---
Honestly streamers that do do that of remaining really low ranks and calling themselves skilled probably don't have many viewers.
---
Anyway long live "entitled survivors".
---
I vividly remember a lot of people that got "reported" never actually being banned, which includes alot of youtubers.
---
I agree on the radius argument, but I never missed a frenzy hit as Legion. For me it is just not that hard. And I still stand by my argument of having to play him first. I won't say you are wrong or right until I tested him myself.
---
It's really fun, i added a few more.
---
I don‚Äôt think highly of my play "lol". But when someone hasn‚Äôt done shit the entire game I try to make their survival as hard as they made mine.
---
check this one chttps://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bcyvty/friday_the_13th_chapter_fan_made/
---
Goodbye!
---
Myers takes time and it is limited while Billy is the second after the Nurse killer who everyone wants to see nerfed to the ground so don't point out these 2 please. That is exactly what the killer needs - a mean to slow down everyone. Like the Doc in Treatment mode and the fact you have to snap out or pig and her traps. I hope he will still have the speed to move arounf faster than normal speed and find new survivors to hit
---
This. You will NOT be scoring multiple hits unless survivors are braindead or the frenzy duration is massively increased.
---
To me it sounds like a Pig and LF combo: When you catch survivors you can slow down the game. Not good I agree but far from dead.
---
I never really played Leigon, but I really like the design and idea of cult killers. I was hoping they'd just straight up redo them.
---
Damn, love the attention to detail. 
---
Vomit looking delicious with a nice side of dab to go with it.
---
Ya, but that's not how balance works. It's like saying how it's ok to make laws that discriminate against black people in the US because they are only 15% of the population...
---
I forgive you for asking.
---
How does one loop a killer that can vault pallets and ledges tho?
---
Cat ear cosmetics when!
---
They should have added to the time to mend if that's the case. It's too fast to remove.
---
I place of my trust in you, so you best not let me down you bihtc
---
Wow this is actually terrible. What the fuck is the point of feral frenzy? It's even more worthless than it already was
---
We‚Äôll make it stacks with botany or another allies Leader, Dying Light or anything really.
---
*reaches tier three*
---
[Nani!? Breathing]
---
‚ÄúAND THIS, IS TO GO, EVEN FURTHER BEYOOOOOOND‚Äù
---
No it doesn't there are a lot of situations where you can play hot potato on gen while a killer continues to chase a survivor near a generator. The bleed timer while in terror radius allows for people to exploit that to their favor.
---
The terror radius bleed is a huge nerf. The mending portion is now the hey legion is leaving me alone and going to do something else mechanic. The mend is not actually a threat to the survivor its a pointless mechanic.
---
Completely nerfing killers into the ground is not how you fix them.
---
i only dc'd against moonwalking, and I guess if someone else also insta DC'd but that's not exclusive to Legion. 3v1s aren't fun.
---
Legion was not good for the game, i think killer/survivors mains agreed on that. These nerfs were necessary to stop him being annoying
---
Both sides of the game need to be appeased and supported, lots of changes have favoured killers recently a few for survivors seem fine
---
By "body blocking" in the reasons for a ban they mean blocking another player in a corner so they can't move, essentially holding the game hostage. Other forms of body blocking (like blocking a window during a chase or trying to block a hook when the killer is holding a survivor) are just playing the game.
---
Considering that we know how Legion currently works it's easy to get a good impression of how bad these changes can be.
---
Well. At a glance I kinda hate it. But if it gets people to stop hating me for playing a character then, sure, I guess.
---
You stab a bunch of times, jump over pallets and windows to hit, and eventually down the survivor.  
---
Now you do that once and then you can't do it anymore the whole chase.  
---
Might as well play wraith.
---
What does it mean when people describe perks as being "Meta"? I see that term alot on here but can't figure out what it means.
---
Red Forest, Gas Heaven, Crotus if you stay outside the center building.
---
Thank God, now you have to have an actual brain to use Feral Frenzy. And thank you for the Terror Radius to mending. No more moonwalking, no more tunnelling mindlessly while in Frenzy Mode. 
---
Thank you, great changes.
---
Hag really benefits from it along with Trapper. Some playstyles of the hillbilly.   
---
Essentially any killer that is always going to let you unhook to put pressure on other gens.
---
People are REALLY underestimating this new change. Who cares if Feral Frenzy is useless? His power is just to give you a free hit, and now that Legion's faster he can reliably use M1. 
---
Very healthy changes for the game, but also he's slightly better now.
---
It's good you enjoy it :)
---
I assume you are baiting. But if not: the version of body blocking that they mention in game is meant for killers body blocking them into a corner for a unreasonable amount of time. Say 10 minutes with out killing or hitting them. Just forcing them to be there. It's not meant to be for survivors tanking hits to make you drop a survivor.
---
Okay but they should‚Äôve reworked the character instead of turning them into dogshit
---
No, we asked for this. Specifically this. Exactly this.
---
I made a simple quick watermark with Photoshop text set as a brush, it should hopefully work well, I've never really had reason to make or use one before so I'll just have to get better with it as I go along. Thanks for the heads up!
---
will people who bought the chapter get a refund or something after this cause this is going to be like the Freddy nerfs but ten times worse
---
You fucking cocksuckers just nerfed Legion into oblivion. I want my fucking money back you fucking pieces of dog shit. Behavior is made up of the some of the most reatarded devs I've ever fucking seen. YOU DON'T LISTEN TO SCRUBS WHO CRY ABOUT EVERYTHING. But that's what you shitheads just did. Congrats. You destroyed Legion. We're not allowed to have another good killer similar to Nurse because fuck killer players we want those shekels from survivor shitlords. 
---
FUCK YOU!
---
Okay so why the fuck did I pay money for a killer that
---
is less than worthless? I want a refund if this is going to be the re-work
---
hahahah thank you mate you just made my day.
---
rofl
---
So they basically butchered Legion ?
---
That would be reasonable if hitting one survivor more than once did anything, but it doesn't
---
well looks like its time to use up all those mixtapes before the killer becomes worse than a Freddy without an m2 button
---
They really dropped the ball on this one. They made Legion more cookie cutter, rather than acceptably unique.
---
I get killer mains love 115 m/s and the devs don't want to give it away without penalty, but it really sounds like Legion's a lot less fun to play. I wish they'd instead made Legion's power more fun and fair instead of shafting it. 
---
And I say this as a survivor main who doesn't like playing versus Legion right now either.
---
Haha! Ha! Haha... Ha.
---
Oh it hurts.
---
Their power is literally "fast vault once" now
---
They got pissed at people exploiting mechanics to make up for a fairly shitty power and got the developers to respond with making the power even fucking worse for non exploiters.
---
Yeah, I'm sure console players will be thrilled by having their power deleted over and over again by the shitty framerate, bad auto lock-on, and the hordes of mediocre 360ers.
---
I think the point missed is that the power is not fun in anyway as the killer. Your power is just a free first hit that has nothing else to it. You could invest in the nurse. Get the blinks down and just get your free first and second hit. Plus all the perks work with you.
---
I think your best option you will have with legion is running exposed perks and Cancel the cool down on the stun after frenzy and get regular swings.
---
Even I, as a survivor main agree that this nerf is overkill.
---
The game is pretty much broken and unplayable but people still blindly buy merch like baby birds accepting food?
---
I didnt make the post for karma so it's all good. I'm expecting a lot of "this update is good" because of the survivor to killer ratio
---
But a single miss takes away the whole duration. This is too much. I was actually excited for a rework too.
---
&gt; Transfer the terror radius to the obsession and then frenzy someone and have the timer go down freely for a solid 10-15 seconds.
---
fuck off that's not an exploit
---
Some of them immediately start unhooking themselves 0.1 seconds after getting hooked. Fuck those people.
---
Appealing to the survivor mains...
---
That‚Äôs why they buffed Decisive Strike...
---
You need to stop, dude.
---
I want a refund then because legion just does fuck all now
---
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, because vaulting a pallet means you‚Äôre in feral frenzy, where you can no longer down a player. You can loop a legion that is now stopped by windows/pallets.
---
Tough guy for an account less than 30 minutes old.
---
Was that really the reason? I completely was down with it, because if you closed the hatch it was supposed to power the exit gates.
---
This. His power does not have any use in a chase now. Therefore, it does absolutely nothing to help fight loops.
---
Still down for me... Not today ;(
---
Clown is fitting, and i'm not even talking about your killer main
---
Where do people get this kinda shit from? lmfao you straight up attacking a dead argument and yet i seem to be the one with issues. Not only that, it has officially been communicated that there was no tunneling in the video. You just apparently wanted to let me know i communicated in a less than desirable way. Do you feel accomplished on this fine tuesday?
---
From what I've seen it's lots of folks on ps4 including me
---
Ghostface needs more than 1 killer as that's his gimmick in the movie and Jason just sucks
---
The devs are so bad at balancing this game holy shit
---
Yes, it's been down for hours today
---
How the fuck did they buff decisive
---
Holy fuck you fucking survivor mains will never be happy.
---
Look how they massacred my boy üò±üò±üò±üò±
---
Same!
---
Legion was never good, he was annoying. Hes now less annoying and still a bad killer. Legion was never balanced either he didnt follow any rules at all
---
I think the changes were necessary for the health of the game.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs just awful. Taking game knowledge away is always a negative. And Mend is now an actual shield against damage....
---
Yea I guess your right, every killer can be tedious
---
k
---
This is garbage and you need to issue refunds
---
I got downed, got up, and got downed in the same spot in less than half a second. I just didn't expect my only alive immersed teammate who did nothing while I run the Plague for half the map to just snap and actually do the last gen, which was at 80%.
---
Oh joy, so it's not just me. Thank you
---
Same here but The devs said they working on it
---
He is, but now Legion is even worse
---
Serves him right.
---
Just tap the gen
---
Just pull thru, I finally got to level 7 again and I‚Äôm getting decent killers and teammates sometimes now lol
---
Last time I crawled to the exit gate, killer came right in time before I reached the final steps. I was salty :/
---
This was hilarious though!
---
if that does become a problem, perhaps they can do what currently happens with the plague's power. the timer should go down while you're making progress on an objective (doing a gen, opening chests, cleansing totems, but not healing or mending obviously)
---
Post it then. It won't take but a minute.
---
Aka old legion without Frank's mixtape and cold dirt.
---
Actually, you got downvoted into oblivion for making a completely nonsensical point and you've just emphasised your lack of ability to reason by attacking survivor players with ad hominem instead of trying to put up a fair arguement. 
---
It seems the only entitled one here is you. To repeat, you need to grow up and learn to use logic instead of attacking people and trying to defend your poorly made viewpoints by deflecting the hate onto others. I can't tell if you're trying to stir up controversy or if you're just that biased and deluded that you can't recognise when you're saying stupid stuff.
---
I mean this with utmost sincerity, if you're regularly missing Frenzy attacks, 
---
Git gud.
---
When was the sale?
---
Yeah man I got two days off of work and this happens lol just my luck
---
Where can find the update notes?
---
It means the perks that are used oftenly and powerful such as Mettle of Man
---
Yeah gay is an insult, no matter how badly some SJW vegan owning 7 cats wants it not to be. In fact considering you are so liberal with insulting everyone else on the planet except whoever your SJW-overlord decides is a protected species. I could really give any fucks what you think I should be using as insults and in fact I will call people gay even more just to trigger the fuck out of your blue haired ugly fat face.
---
What a crazy man to do such a feat. I would literally be screaming
---
No, they're dead. No doubt. Everything good about the power is gone, but hey hey hey survivor mains get their way. So everything is fine. And now they're 115, so they're balanced. 
---
Fucking Developers.
---
Us freddy mains need to stick together
---
I just put that under the folder "Plays casualy and dosnt understand helath balance" ..... go circlejerk again with ALL the others. But they must be right, right ? There are so MAAAAANY of them!
---
As soon as they announced the perk it was easy to tell that MoM is gonna be the 2nd DS. I agree with you. You might have over exaggerated a little but there are glaring issues with the current MoM design that need to be fixed
---
It‚Äôll be sad if they make her add-on reliant
---
Is that really the case? When i got the achievement, I'm pretty sure i had to actually be in feral frenzy when a survivor bled out (whether by hitting them again or by them just not mending and hitting the ground). With these new changes it seems like the only way to gain progress on this achievement is to have the survivor not mend after you've gone feral frenzy on another survivor. Either way I'm glad i got it out of the way already
---
Oh boi... I've been using MoM against Billy and Huntresses as well. You just need to force them to M1, no matter how stupid the play. 
---
Against Billy I just keep vaulting stuff. 
---
Against Huntresses I just run around any object I can find, denying the M2 as much as possible. During pallet looping I **never** drop the pallet. Good huntress players will try to mind game you and time their M2 during the pallet drop. They never expect survivors to continue running forever. I either get a M1 hit or the looping never ends as she keeps pulling her M2.
---
It's information that I can't use or won't really change anything but after seeing it, it's somehow like I always needed it.
---
When is the nurse going to get beat up by the cops?
---
Even with Billy if you stay near loops he's forced to m1 you
---
That seems like a fair compromise. Force them to have to mend before doing anything, even if you are still in the terror radius.
---
best thing to do w killer campers is leave one person on the hook for as long as possible, gen rush as much as you can then switch out w the hooked person until exit gates open. then have everyone guard the hooked guy till he gets out too
---
You know, except the part where it still lets him jump over pallets and windows without the regular killer vault animation.
---
Serious question time: Is Spirit strong against loops? Is current legion strong against loops while in frenzy?
---
He was never good to begin with, but changing somthing without destroying it, isnt possible for these devs, there  history shows this !
---
Nice! lol Glad to see a full try hard Hag going against 3 people. Lovely.
---
If simply missing one attack kills your whole power then yeah they're bad. Full stop.
---
I dont know why I expected a different response
---
That's tough. Sorry bud,
---
Can we agree the idea of flesh and blood people spending the time to actively spy in the way required for this kind of *very* specific enforcement is kind of insane?
---
r/woooosh
---
I‚Äôm sorry for the upcoming karma loss this sub is about to bring on you
---
I think he is fine as he is but somethings that could be changed if they ever did change it is slower movement chainsaw sprint, slower chainsaw recharge rate (even though it already can be stalled), normal movement speed. I still think he is balanced as he is though
---
There is one thing to consider that no one has mentioned yet. There will be a rebalance to his add ons as well. Maybe it will be like when they revamped the wraiths add ons and made them fun to use instead of just pure number changes. We already know iridescent button was changed so they don't need to hit a survivor anymore for it to activate. We will have to be patient and see what happens with the add ons before making a full on "they suck" judgment.
---
Fking gay

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update/p1?new=1
---
Here ya go
---
don‚Äôt use that word in this context
---
You cannot do that as it only hurts the team further. You have 45 seconds per stage and the best strategy a lot of the time is to continue repairing for a bit, then head to the hook. This is good because:
---
1. Killers generally loiter around the hook at first
---
2. You get a little bit more generator progress before abandoning and risking regression.
---
You deciding to commit suicide essentially implies you want survivors to rush to the hook as soon as they can, which in a number of cases is only worse for the hooked survivor.
---
we did
---
You seem really angry so ill just leave this discussion here. Legion was not a fun experience and he needed to be changed
---
Yep, I was looking only under the Feral Frenzy section.
---
That being said, the fact that they specified 'regular' Feral Frenzy attacks makes me think they may implement a new addon that does so.
---
I wonder fucking why is there NURSE around with NO counterplay? Legion was not even overpowered, and now he is nerfed to the ground, why everybody complaining about legion and not nurse? This is such a bull shit
---
I don‚Äôt regularly miss attacks but that was a big selling point of feral frenzy the no cooldown attack‚Äôs
---
Well, his base speed increased which means you can get a first free hit into a survivor and the keep the chase as most killers do. But I agree, his power seems one of the weakest among all killers...
---
I just recently checked out Jane's cosmetics as I do with every new survivor and I couldn't believe that they have multiple different colors for the same outfit that you have to pay for individually! What even man lol
---
r/friday
---
I've had that. I finished the last gen and dropped out of the window of the building was in to sneak off from the trapper and the totem in front of me was alight. I thought might as well take this out and it turned out to be noed. The entity favoured the survivors that match.
---
As it went the trapper DC'd.
---
There was only 3 survivors. We were all injured anyway and no gate was open yet. He could have gotten one or more of us but he DC'd and lost the points XD
---
*laughs in insidious*
---
Oh absolutely. They nerfed him into oblivion. Hopefully the ptb responses will actually give them pause. But again, thzts what the ptb is for so until we see how bad it is we won't know. Maybe they'll change their mind on some of the changes.
---
Game is ruined by ppl like you
---
This.
---
On the other hand, intentionally abusing something that is clearly an exploit should be bannable
---
80 seconds is pretty far from 10 seconds.
---
It's mainly the fact that a missed attack depletes the power completely and that you down a survivor with it. Both of those things are absurd and it's baffling that BHVR thought something that severe was necessary. Undo just those two things and it would be fine. But no.
---
Not a fan of reducing the Killer's unique power in exchange for 115 ms.
---
Some other directions I would've enjoyed better would've been:
---
* faster Feral speeds and higher deep wound damage after each different survivor hit in exchange for mend being less boring and oppressive 
---
* more emphasis on stalking mending survivors that think they are safe, less on chase or abuse of chase mechanics.
---
* less power on feral frenzy/mend and more interaction with terror radius and red stain as per survivor masquerade motif 
---
* more interaction with survivor objectives and objects in exchange for mend being less boring and oppressive
---
Ways to improve mend:
---
* survivors could mend and walk
---
* survivors mending another survivor goes faster
---
I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt aware add-ons were broken. I don‚Äôt remember if or know if did or didn‚Äôt. Usually use him for daily‚Äôs
---
Its gotta be done now
---
they probably felt this was necessary because people were rarely able to escape Legion once he activated feral frenzy.  this is just to give survivors another option to escape him during that time since he is unloopable in frenzy thanks to his significant speed and ability to vault.  feral frenzy will also last longer than before so now your only hope to escape is to lose line of sight.
---
On 0 tr Myers, you probably aren't going to get bt off anyways.
---
How to fucking ruin legion. Good job BVHR, I‚Äôm losing hope in them man. Legion was already not a great killer at all in high ranks. Now he‚Äôs in like with Freddy. Fucking ridiculous
---
As a both main, I'm gonna have to reply "Because that really worked for Freddy" also nice fresh account you made because your too scared to post on main.
---
You can spam x to load in but you can‚Äôt q as killer but you can as survivor but you won‚Äôt find a game because there‚Äôs no killers :(
---
For people who find fun in rotating killers, it's now just another killer you roll you eyes when you select them.
---
I honestly would not judge anyone for skipping over that killer in the rotation.
---
Deleting legion would be less of a nerf to legion
---
Dude. You really gotta improve the quality of your life. 
---
Not only do you defend toxic actions while running a bugged legion, you‚Äôve brought nothing but toxicity towards the survivor side all day. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry your life isn‚Äôt great, but if you play to piss someone off, you‚Äôre a loser.
---
They deserve it. Except during rank reset I got a rank 20 survivor on my team and they messed up the generator and went into the locker until I finished then i kept telling them to come with me and eventually they did and they followed me around like a puppy till we escaped. But other than that if someone knows that they shouldnt be in a locker I'd sandbag all day
---
"Well class, since 1 of you did a bad thing, the whole class will now be punished."
---
Doesn't matter.
---
Think about it. Bruh.
---
You move ‚Äî you're fucked. All they gotta do is run in four different directions.
---
Even if he's solid ‚Äî it's the principle of the matter. Survivorcucks can officially take the game hostage by quitting every match.
---
He was a low tier killer to begin with. This is fucking absurd. lmao.
---
yeah cant load into any game rn im ps4 btw Random\_Cody im a skate board dude coz i like skateboarding we could play when it comes back on dude
---
I didn't. I know people often used that perk to abuse the exploit, but people also used that perk to be able to track during frenzy (like in the middle of a cornfield). If people wanted to abuse the exploit, they pretty much still can using just scratch marks, or throw in Stridor to make it even easier.   
---
I'm just saying, it's another perk that doesn't make sense to put on Legion ever.
---
Not really much different than the survivors DC'ing when Legion is the killer then, eh?
---
Yep. Just for ps4
---
Haha thank you my dude :)
---
Like I said somewhere else, an old version of the wraith. Strong first hit, but weaker chase, except that wraith is now decent with the windstorm in his base kit.
---
Nurse has counterplay. She's the easiest killer to juke. She has to guess where you are going, so if you change direction she will be punished with a really big fatigue. Legion, in the other hand, doesn't have counterplay.
---
1. You can't hide because he sees you after deep wounding someone.
---
2. You can't loop because he can jump on windows and pallets faster than you.
---
3. You can't escape without being injured because he runs faster than you.
---
4. You can't juke because he won't be punished from missed attacks.
---
Add the Moonwalk exploit and Frank's Mixtape and you have no counterplay at all.
---
You mean to honestly tell me that you think those windows are in any way fair
---
So, your SWF group teamed with the killer. Interesting. I wonder why everyone hates SWF
---
Could've swore the perk said that you don't leave pools of blood David so there's no way you've lost a lot of blood so either you're lying or I'm crazy.
---
For 2 Winters in a row we get an unfun Killer that instead of getting reworked gets fucking nerfed to the ground. Unfucking believable... I really thought they wouldnt do this again. I want all my damn BP back and the money i spent on cosmetics and the DLC. Unbelievable
---
AND THE FIRST KILLER THEY DID THIS TOO IS STILL NOT FIXED!
---
A match starts with a DC or two. Is it typical to farm those matches or get them over with ASAP?
---
As a killer, if I wanted to farm would I just hang out in the open or chase and never M1?
---
I typed this before reading a lot of other posts. Finna be downvote city huh?
---
It is. You can get a Dwight, Claudette, Meg or Jake faces as a reward for killing every one of them 25 times.
---
It's not regardless, the game is pay2win untill MoM shows up in the shrine period, no buts or what ifs about it. 
---
So basically just because people paid money for something you can't change or remove something? I bought this game when BNP actually did an entire generator in 1 second, they can't nerf that to the ground, I paid for this game it should be exactly the way I paid for it and if not then I want a refund despite being fully aware of how terrible old BNP was for the game I paid moneys and moneys is the only thing that matters when balancing a game.......... See what I did there?
---
I said you need perks to COUNTER hag and spirit, not to play as them. 
---
And I'm just saying I never cried about anyone being "too toxic for this community wehhhh" that's some next-generation pussificiation that I wasn't part of, but if you define me saying the game is trash = "being too sensitive" then I guess pussification isn't the worst part of your generations problems.
---
It should have been a sensible re-work, not whatever this fucking insane trash is. A missed attack in frenzy depletes the entire ting? That's fucking ridiculous and you know it
---
gg ez
---
omg i saw this when i got a 4k witch billy the last surrvivor stepped out then i yeeted my chainsaw on that p3 claudette
---
I think the playstyle will become something along the lines of frenzy hitting for the first hit, then keeping up with the survivor, cornering them or forcing them into a place, so that when the frenzy wears off it will be easier to get the hit on them. Again, I'm just speculating, but if the duration increase is big then this may be what Legion becomes. Either this, or it ends up where the goal is to slow the game down a lot by applying the deep wound to multiple survivors as quickly as possible.
---
Yes that scene was intense. He finally met his match
---
Not saying you‚Äôre wrong, the people who intentionally DC because they don‚Äôt like what they are up against are the worst.
---
Fixes survivors DCing against Legion. We can finally counterplay, about time.
---
...no, it doesn't? You could use Bloodhound without doing the exploit. You could just use it like you would with any other killer.
---
crow: flies somewhere on the complete opposite side of map
---
survivor: dc
---
No mither and tenacity. Plus adrenalin and MoM.
---
They were already quite weak without powerful addons.
---
Yes, they were unfun to play against. But they were far from powerful.
---
This is just making them absolutely worthless.
---
IQ 200
---
&gt; The Deep Wound timer progress is no longer reduced by regular Feral Frenzy attacks.  
---
Unless that means that you can down them in frenzy, it means it doesn't do anything when you hit them more than once.
---
The pig is probably the most balanced killer in the game
---
Nico nico ni* - that very anime weeb 2019
---
Well if you get banned you can speak directly to them. And I'm sure it won't be a permanent ban unless you constantly use them for multiple games in a row.
---
? uh...idk if you read what i said. I'm aware of the faces. I'm talking about his outfit where he's wearing a suit that has the tiny cute tie and hes got all the make up on the face he's wearing
---
Survivors will need to mend anyway, in terror radius or not, so they will lose time doing it. His power works like Pig's RBTs.
---
I love Legion and while knee jerk reaction is anger I am willing to see what happens. The changes are not live and will be play tested.
---
...The power that makes you move faster and allows you to fast-vault pallets and windows was "never meant to be a chasing tool"? Are you absolutely sure about that particular hot take?
---
It‚Äôs weird to call something selectable in-game an exploit. It‚Äôs not like glitching up trees or anything like that.
---
For the inability to down a survivor with it:
---
make it so that you cannot down a survivor in deep wounds *but* you **can** down a survivor simply in injured state, however that depletes the power bar.
---
Boom. Sensible and balanced. How did they fuck this up so bad?
---
You clearly have the time here, just go watch the many videos on the subject. There was a time during a PTB that they made it so if the killer found the hatch first they could close it and it seems you haven‚Äôt played this game very long judging by the way you acting but the ability for the killer to close the hatch seemed very fair especially considering that if the hatch comes live then it means the killer won and no reason at all to give survivors the hatch. You must be one of those entitled survivors or a dumb killer that gives a survivor the hatch that is until you get that asshole survivor that sends you hate mail so yeah you ain‚Äôt been playing that long and I honestly doubt that you would ever confront me like this lol trust me keyboard warrior and no bait this time.
---
The fact of the matter is that BHVR wants the problem to disappear and for the survivor main streamers who support their game to be pleased with them, with no regards to how killers actually play
---
Ah fair enough.. kinda a Freddy main ... well now a spirit main but.. yeah thanks for the info :)
---
Not surprised. They made him worse then Freddy ever was. Hopefully the devs will give him something to make up for this purge in a year or so. Legion straight up sucks now.
---
What about screwing around in Kill Your Friends mode. Since it doesn't get you BP or effect ranking, is it cool to bust them out there?
---
u/BanimeDoesReddit
---
I like what they did to Legions deep wound where if they're in the terror radius it doesn't decrease no matter what and I like the changes to their add ons so the exploits can't be used anymore but, lowering the frenzy speed and making it so we need the full bar plus taking away the damage we can do to the bar by hitting them again was too much imo
---
Hitting then after vaulting a pallet does literally nothing. It just uses your power up.
---
I like the attention to detail, take an uppbote
---
I would just love if they had a Jeff fat suit to wear
---
The mend timer is not paused while you're mending currently. Sure, you can't go down to deep wounds while you're mending, but the bar still ticks down the entire time, so if you have to interrupt your mending, you're probably going down because of it.
---
Clearly these changes are meant to make deep wounds less of a direct threat of downing a survivor, but giving them 115% MS in theory makes it so legion no longer has to rely on deep wounds to down people. It's clear what the philosophy behind the rework is, but we'll see how it ends up working out in practice.
---
Common*
---
Complaint meet irony
---
Holy shit legion is actually useless now
---
Really?!
---
Not gonna lie, usually it is for worse
---
A lot of players have expectations. You cant win them all on both sides. But even getting downed first and not killing yourself buys so much time for everyone else. If I'm ever face camped and I'm downed first I notice the gens fly. Unless the team focuses on saving me too soon. Then its bad
---
Hey there ya go! Enjoy your time with your friends!! :)
---
This is a bad balance dynamic though which no developer ever should strive for. BHVR should always aim to balance the killer roster as tightly as possible.
---
Is this a joke or are you actually like that.
---
literally all the fucking way dude. when they open their mouths you can see fingers.
---
I know, right? Core vision my ASS y'all just made the only unique thing about this already shitty killer impossible to use.
---
I wish that wasn't true
---
And I love mystery heroes. Really addicting
---
Again you're meant to hit as many survivors as possible with it it, not one. It's a pressure skill not a chasing one survivor down skill.
---
Agreed. I'm extremely surprised this many people got so mad about this. I'm estatic lol i mean i think what people don't realize is that the only way legion can be made right is a complete overhaul. Like a different power. He should not have ever existed in this form. This nerf is literally all they could have to done to make him hated less. Now people just hate that he's gonna be useless
---
JohnnyComeLately and her little psychopath?
---
Hit the gen nearest the survivor which indicates you want to farm, if they go work on the gen you hit then they also want to farm.
---
I support your opinion. I‚Äôd rather him be obsolete than overpowered and causing so many disruptions. Furthermore, we can‚Äôt really see how he is now till we test him. Honestly he looks now like a very flexible and fast killer who can vault and all that. He looks pretty fun compared to the original
---
For those of you who havent see it https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update/p1?new=1
---
You're meant to be hitting multiple survivors not just one.
---
&gt; Let‚Äôs try them out before screaming about how they‚Äôre bad.
---
It's objectively bad to lose the entire power for one missed attack. It's objectively bad that a survivor cannot be downed with their power. These are both indefensible.
---
Missing during a frenzy = cancel power is good, deep wound not ticking down when mending or in the killer radius is good, but honestly, I feel like that would've been enough.
---
Just realised how they make survivor pudding...
---
&gt; I get killer mains love 115 m/s
---
wow, no surprise that killer main would love to go at 414 km/h
---
Excited to see it off of paper. Seems weaker but that 115% js important. Curious HOW much slower the frenzy is. But a 115% m1 killer with an easier 1st hit and game slowing potential doesn't really seem awful to me, just comparatively weaker than what we had. We'll see it soon.
---
While the majority of the changes seem pretty okay, I don't think missing an Attack in frenzy should take you out of it. Maybe decrease the timer instead, but pulling legion out of it completely is too much.
---
No they are going to nerf Legion to the ground. Frenzy speed will be decreased and missing an attack will put them out of frenzy. There's more.  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update/p1?new=1](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update/p1?new=1)
---
thank you, kind sir
---
Its like hearing someone saying The nurse is easy to juke and my head starts to hurt. Well shes not if shes good. And I don't think its hard to master a puke/while the Nurse atleast is hard to master/.
---
That is bad.
---
I sort of want a refund on Legion now, he's just boring as hell sounding, but we'll have to see really
---
feral frenzy still lets you vault things.  that is important because any other m1 killer won't be able to get that free 1st hit while being unloopable.  Legion's power is way weaker than before, but imo it's still a versatile tool.  you still get wall hacks which is valuable information even if you don't plan on chasing the other survivors.  
---
plus I'm trying to imagine a scenario where you see 2 survivors on a gen and a Legion with feral frenzy isn't the optimal option to guarantee an injure on both survivors in a timely manner.  I think it will still have its uses and force players to make a conscious decision on when to use the ability.
---
&gt;Not even sure what deep wounds is meant to do anymore.
---
Activate Frenzy, Stab 2+ Survivors, the Survivors you're not chasing waste time mending and then healing because you're now a big scary 115% movement speed killer with a decent lunge.
---
Or nothing because their power is really boring now.
---
Not everything needs play tested to know it's bad
---
Devs:*makes insta kill killer that can teleport to survivors*
---
You: "yOu HaVeNt PlAy TeStEd It YeT"
---
Care to explain why Amanda is not in this picture?
---
I wanted a rework, not a "enjoy being the new freddy bitch"
---
Another knee jerk overdone nerf due to people rage DCing against a DLC player? What an incompetent company choice. You don't "fix" a killer by neutering them entirely. These changes should've had a line drawn there's just far too many now. Increased terror radius, BT status now doesn't go down in the killers terror radius, frenzy hits no longer down or shorten the bleedout timer, lowered speed in frenzy, frenzy penalty on misses like for fucks sake. The only real issue with Legion was he was utterly useless baseline and only had 2 usable strats aka Frank's Mix Tape and Cold Dirt or moonwalking after a survivor. Instead of entirely making the killers already pretty horrible power worse why not just change some mechanics surrounding it? Maybe just remove Moonwalking keeping the timer going and remove Bloodhound working with Legion and adjust his ability to effectively down survivors without being forced to run 2 purple fucking add-ons. Remove the lunge chaining for distance or lower the overall frenzy speed doing both was overkill. I wonder if they even properly test any of these changes or just regurgitated whatever ideas everyone had to make him a shit tier killer and put them in effect immediately. If we all remember Freddy being knee jerk changed and how long we've waited for him to be buffed or reworked properly than you know that now Legion is going to be in a meme form for fucking ever now see him again in a year or so when they get to him.
---
Very interesting the perks are good but I don‚Äôt see them being too broken well done
---
So you think the solution was going all the way in the opposite direction and wasting people's money rather than a sensible, balanced re-work?
---
Real men main Trapper.
---
I for sure agree. I just edited my post and i mentioned it in a comment above, this was all they could have done besides changing his power entirely. Which i hope happens but it probably won't so this is our best solution. Legion should have never had this stupid power in the first place
---
If the killer closing hatch was fair, how come it got removed? Fucking dumbass. You have yet to raise one decent point. If you have to know, I play both sides pretty evenly. I'm a rank 8 surv and rank 2 killer as of right now. However, that doesn't matter. Even if I played survivor exclusively, it still wouldn't invalidate my point. Also, still trying to threaten me over the internet? Real mature buddy. Are you really that deluded that you can't see when you are being overly biased and acting like a twat? If so, I have no reason to keep arguing. You are beyond help.
---
Goodbye and have a great evening.
---
I believe with the increased terrot radius that should mean an increased range as well.
---
Down for me too :(
---
I prefer more original killers but a few fan made killers won‚Äôt hurt
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
I didn't understand the bug @ the time 'cause I don't look for ways to break the game.
---
Le toxicity. Le toxicity.
---
Sound like a fucking vagina. Please be better.

Haha i'm honesly amazed i'm getting positive feedback from this post. People usually can't wait to tell me how stupid i am for having an opinion lmao
---
It's not going to be possible to do that with the massive speed de-buff. And with the normal terror radius they'll hear you coming a mile away. It's flat out not going to work.
---
Devs: Nerf a character and give it some slight buffs.
---
You: It Is DeAd
---
Then when they get around to it, the rework will be a nerf instead of buff

Legion v Freddy: race to the first z rank killer.
---
I was able to play yesterday. And I had loaded into a game today then got the error. turned off my system and was able to get in after 10 minutes and I have yet to get into a lobby.
---
They dont listen to killer mains. That's how
---
Yeah dude just juke her 4HEad and she will be extrimely punished with one second of fatigue, and will able to ignore walls, doors, stairs, roofs again 4HEad
---
Freaking amazing!
---
You're a fuckingmoron
---
He's gonna be more annoying now imo. You use feral frenzy to injure someone, end it, tunnel the shit out of them. If you think any legion player is going to not tunnel now more then he did before your wrong. Pre-obliteration legion could choose to go after another survivor. Now his only chance at a kill is going to be tunneling.
---
Yea they fixed that by making it so nobody play legion
---
yes! i've been trying to get in for 10 minutes and restarted by PS4 but i dont know how to fix it :/ i think its common with new updates
---
You would enter fatigue. If you didn't, it would be a little too easy to abuse it by catching up to a survivor in frenzy, turning away, missing a swing and then hitting them with a regular attack to down them.
---
They nerfed this dude into yhe ground lol
---
GREAT NEWS ! UwU
---
I think for a lot of the people the fun is just in trying to outthink/outmaneuver the others. 
---
For me, I personally enjoy trying to catch up to really good survivors or trying to escape a really good killer because you‚Äôre going to learn something new and get better every time. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind losing- hell, I always throw myself in front of the killer and get downed just to let teammates escape. Or give the hatch to a survivor. 
---
That‚Äôs also why i‚Äôm not a rank 1, so take that as you will
---
Calling me names now!? Oof bad little monkey go troll someone else. Idiots like you crying is why they removed it. Enjoy your day.
---
Justice served.
---
Yes. YES! YEESS!!!
---
thank u
---
I'm sad.
---
‚ÄúA global issue affecting PS4 users is preventing login and creation of online matches. Our team is aware of the issue and is already working on a solution to re-allow players on the network.‚Äù per Dead By Daylight twitter
---
That's exactly the problem, isn't it? Even one intentional DC is enough to disrupt the game for everyone else in that match, so taking the view of "oh, they only DC 10% (or whatever) of their matches, it's all good" isn't an effective way of discouraging people from doing it. People mostly DC just so they can move on to the next match. A 30 minute ban is long enough to negate that yet short enough to be only a minor inconvenience in the case of unintentional DC. It also minimizes the number of games a player can ruin by going on a DC streak.
---
Hypocrisy.
---
And thank you. I will have a great dayüòÅ
---
&gt;and now that Legion's faster he can reliably use M1
---
Windows? Pallets? Loops?
---
Oh yeah it definitely helps I just wish there was a mechanic that causes it to grow bigger and bigger with each stab in a frenzy
---
they increased ff duration but reduced his speed, so what's the point... shame i spent shards on him, won't be able to get a refund lol
---
In my experience it works fine. If you spawn with a party then it just so happens that you are all as far from the killer as possible.
---
Yeah, lets put holes in the floor in a game where one of the sides has limited vision...
---
Awww man that sucks :( I dont know how to fix it either...
---
You can still spawn with others. The shrouds just force it to happen.
---
It's not comparable. Her phase walk is a lot quicker and she can also actually use her power to end chases - Legion cannot end a chase with their power. So it makes sense for her to have that punishment. Also Legion having their power depleted causes a stun. ffs
---
That would be pretty cool.
---
Bye
---
If you look over there you can see a killer fall from op mountain, to z list trash.
---
I meant movement speed.
---
These low effort dancing crab gifs are way too overused in this sub its kind of annoying.
---
No one should be celebrating a killer becoming useless entirely. They should have balanced properly instead of panicking due to disconnects and putting 0 thought into the changes they made. Variety is part of the fun for this game having placed another potentially viable high tier killer in the dumpster is literal tragedy.
---
What's that add on do?
---
Oh I just saw the tweet they posted regarding this!!
---
I dont have the facts, sure. But the person you replied to did. He literally gave a valid and reasonable argument and you just pull some dumb shit and say "6k hours in legion rework". You're the fucking idiot here. I was just hoping maybe you'd notice that. Guess not.
---
Yea thanks - that's just the respond I wanted to hear. You got me there.
---
I don't see the humor in what I said.
---
Continue over-exaggerating though.
---
Never have despite the feverish screaming on this forum claiming the devs cater to killers
---
Well they decreased how much faster he is, but they increased his base speed, so he will probably have a longer maximum range in ff, just not as fast.
---
If I may, what kind of different Power?
---
Honestly you're more entertaining than anything since I can't add on top of my 2,496 hours due to servers being down. I'm sorry, who are you? Keep going, please. This dead sea salt you're giving is beautiful. If anything you're acting like the sjw- because a game isn't exactly how you want it to be, you're throwing a huge ass tantrum and making pathetic attempts to insult anyone who points out how sad you're acting is. I need something to fill the time since it's one of my few days off work a month. Please, do keep going.
---
It is really fuckin dark tho
---
But what if they use an instaheal
---
no one cares nerd
---
Sounds like you just suck at the game
---
noice
---
Sue bhvrnfor war crimes, collective punishment.
---
will some addons still reduce fatigue time or is it intended for Legion to not use their power in any way to down the survivor?
---
Camping the hatch is the only situation where "snitches get stitches" doesn't apply.
---
Wait, are there actual documented cases of people being BANNED for using the addons?
---
Use Ace In The Hole with Plunderer's Instinct. Bask in the glory of getting Keys and Maps on a constant basis (usually). The other two perks can literally be anything; though, I run Kindred and Lightweight with it.
---
Ah yes, exactly the response I awaited from a toxic community.
---
Disappointed, my rework was better https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4bmuh/legion_reworked/
---
* Deep Wounds doesn't grant him a greater strength/ability like I suggested. And if it wasn't going to be a tool used for that then it should have applied pressure on the survivor in terms of ticking down *when not in a chase* like the Pig's traps, even if you're in the killer's terror radius. That it pauses while within the killer's TR regardless of in a chase or not is punishing the killer for possibly going after another survivor nearbye the one with Deep Wounds. This, on top of increasing his terror radius punishes the Legion even more  If anything the Legion's terror radius should have been decreased to encourage survivors to mend with more urgency.
---
And let me guess, nurse's calling or other aura reading perks are still going to be useless with this newer version of Deep Wounds.
---
* Since Iridescent button effects the whole map, and if survivors with Deep Wound have their timer paused if within the killer's terror radius, does that means that if a killer brings in the addon that survivor's Deep Wound effect will never go down at any point? Please tell me I'm wrong about that.
---
* I don't have too much issue with this version of Feral Frenzy changes *if* it's duration is going to last around a minute. The reason why it needs to be longer than what it already is is because with a significant reduction in speed and even more protection for survivors with Deep Wounds, it needs extra time.
---
* There's crickets heard from the Devs about the DCing done against this character. If entitled survivors are still DCing against the character even after these changes (and just the fact that he can still vault pallets may be enough for the DCing to continue in mass) then none of this will matter much. Volunteeringly DCing is a major issue for the health of the game that needs serious addressing.
---
Spirit is bae. Though I stopped playing her recently because they fucked up the sounds and she's a lot weaker now.
---
But just now, I tried a game where I swapped out Haunted Grounds (my least useful perk) for Stridor. The accuracy you can get out of that while phasing is amazing, even better than before they broke sounds. Particularly good with the saya, you can pretty much always land on top of them.
---
Buffs? What buffs? You mean normal movement speed? That's not a buff
---
Killed* not nerfed. He is 100%, unusable now without a doubt. There is no way possible you could get a kill with him and honestly if you die to this version of legion you should probably uninstall the game because he doesn't even have a power.
---
Even Freddie's power is better than this and Freddie's just allows him to become a m1 killer
---
Yes, that was really the reason. They stated on their developer stream at the time that it felt unfair to survivors and was unpopular.
---
They wanted a rework to him, not to kill him
---
For every 1 survivor nerf there is 5 killer nerfs
---
Far from the truth, lol.
---
haha good sir, your comment appears to have a typo! You have been keked and logic'd
---
Behaviour could have a complete rework on their ability to allow counter plays and make Legion less annoying to play against while still viable. But it's Behaviour we are talking about lol they suck at balancing anything and everything. But whatever I hate Legion and I don't want to see any in my games :DDDDD
---
U must be spoiled if u think it's pay2win if one single perk doesn't show up within literally a month of it being created. 
---
And yes, u can't REMOVE something as for changing it it's called buffing/nerfing but they won't block or remove it like u proposed in ur early comment. And again ur 2nd paragraph makes literally NO sense.
---
Ok then, to COUNTER Hag and Spirit there's plenty of perks for it. Like I said, change your playstyle/strategies if u don't like using the same perks. There's multiple ways to go about it. 
---
As for that last section of your comment, if u wanna go there saying that then u need to really take a look in the mirror and change some thing pal because u sound like an entitled ass. I think we have a right to complain about a "toxic" player in the community. As for someone who is just bashing the game, if u seriously don't like it that much then u shouldn't even be here in the first place. So if u think "our generation" is bad and has problems urs must be on the next level.
---
The standard fatigue (one blink) is 2 seconds, plus 0.5 for every chainblink. You can also juke her by fastvaulting a locker while she is blinking. It's easy to know when she will blink because of her breath. Plus, playing Nurse is really hard, Legion is not.
---
:(...
---
And he is super bad now worse than Freddy
---
I agree.  All the other changes seem pretty balanced, but that **one line** makes him entirely useless.
---
I mean most killers tunnel anyway, survivors can now at least run legion around. With current legion he will just down you with frenzy hits after 4 times. New legion obeys the laws of the game once survivors are injured
---
Finally thank god
---
You missed Borrowed Time smack into Dead 'ard into Mettle of Man
---
If I understand, when a Spirit comes out and misses a whack, there's no additional penalty other than the missed attack cooldown. Unless I'm wrong about the numbers, Legion has to grunt at the ground for 3 seconds. Pallet stun time is just 2.1 seconds.
---
I don't know what the missed attack cooldown is for Spirit, but I imagine it's far less than 3 seconds of immobility and looking at the ground. Compared to Legion, she really does immediately recover.
---
If survivors are running away, you're already putting pressure on. People are just bitter they're going to actually have to play Legion as intended. Imagine moaning about needing to hit on attacks. This sub man.
---
Same here. It‚Äôs upsetting. 
---
Anyways I am very aware his is not the place to post this but I‚Äôve been having trouble finding people to swf with on playstation so if anyone wants to play add me ReptileRainbow 23/F/EST.
---
I‚Äôve tried gamerpals and the dbd discord I use for PC and can‚Äôt really find people that play on ps4 and aren‚Äôt 16.
---
I think your problem is, when you really focus in on it, when the dust settles at the end of the day, focusing in on the root cause, looking at all possibilities, essentially, you need to, and pay close attention cause I'm only gonna say this once, git gud.
---
Fuck your thievery, motherfucker
---
Owo uwu
---
Just a couple weeks ago.
---
Can you explain how it got buffed ?
---
Legion mains on suicide watch.
---
Comparing swf to a game breaking bug is the silliest and dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard on this reddit.
---
Big fucking facts. This is about Noob and jen
---
Sorry to the original poster I‚Äôm not spamming I just feel like this will attract people who play on PS4
---
What makes me laugh is when the survivors ignore those 3 gens the entire match then call the killer a "proxy camper" for patrolling them.
---
Against healthy survivors it has its uses sure but not much, in most cases it would be better to break the pallet rather than jump over it. Maybe if they give legion collision while in recovery there might be some mindgames to be done
---
Let‚Äôs get one thing clear, legion was fucking terrible from the start. During the PTB he was pretty much being put in Freddy tier before everyone got their time in with him. The only reason he became viable was through exploits or broken add ons. Now legion is healthier for the game and takes some skill to actually use, but isn‚Äôt top tier and that‚Äôs fine because not every killer can be. Maybe he needs some buffs, maybe not but I‚Äôm excited to see how this plays out.
---
Whoever you're trying to impress by voting republican it's not fooling me, anyone who gets so offended over the use of "gay" as an insult, especially without seeing their own ridiculous double standard is a fucking SJW I don't care how much your husband controls who you vote for. Getting triggered over a game is still better than getting triggered over words, funny how you never complained about the use of mongoloids, a group of people way worse off than gays, dumb double standard fat cunt.
---
Noob3 should have gotten the same treatment as Ichigo. He hacked, was abusive towards killers, and showed exploits. Where‚Äôs his ban? Oh wait, he has a lot of subscribers...
---
You don't know what the fuck you're talking about. I didn't say I immediately kill myself when survivors don't come as soon as I'm hooked. I said if I'm on the hook for a while and I'm about to enter the second state I'll kill myself. Basically if they let me get two hooked. I'm not playing that game.
---
You still get the frenzy refilled after the first hit, so you frenzy to someone to get the first hit on them, then frenzy to stay with them as they run away, and when the frenzy wears off, catch up to them (115% speed now) and down them. Remember that the the duration of frenzy is also increased now too, so you can do this.
---
So you think it's sensible that an ability that includes a physical attack cannot down a survivor and simply missing an attack causes a total depletion of the power bar and a stun is a sensible change? Interesting.
---
It's because they don't care about the balance they care about their precious data. If their data shows people keep DCing against a killer alot then they nerf that killer. Every time. And what did people do? They kept rage quitting even against REGULAR legions who werent moonwalking or using purple add-ons or using glitched add-ons. BHVR did not respond to the much needed fixes and balances and now that it's grown to a shit state they just purely hammer nerfed him into the dirt. They likely will keep him shitty for months if not a year now and hell be a meme and no one will use him.
---
lmao oh boy
---
The Pig is Closer to the trailer version of Legion than the real Legion is.  (Aside from Reverse Bear Traps and Jigsaw boxes.)  Amanda will *sometimes* get mistaken for a crouching survivor, if just for a moment or two.  That **never** happens with Legion, despite being the main interesting thing about his trailer.  :/
---
When was there an update
---
Survivor's are the weakest they've ever been. LOL
---
On the other hand, the way to use the bug is equipping two things you are fully allowed to by normal game rules.
---
Make no mistake, the blame of this bug is on BHVR, not the people using it either intentionally or unintentionally.
---
At least Wraith's passive windstorm and clapper add ons allows him to mind game at jungle gyms.
---
But Legion doesn't really have anything to support him in that regard.
---
God damn, the balance team on this game is clueless as per usual
---
Sure, you could also counter loops by using your power three separate times over the span of about a minute, but that was never the most effective way to down any player while using Frenzy. I do not imagine any killers enjoyed using that method either as I sure disliked it for anything other than farming Brutality.
---
Anyways, these are all of my first-thought rants. I am sure Legion will be playable and effective with certain strategies, very much like Freddy.

---
If the killer is camping me I do it to give the last survivor time to find the hatch. Also I do it when the last survivor is being hooked in case they want to attempt escape.
---
&gt; Imagine moaning about needing to hit on attacks.
---
...Are you serious right now? You think it's wrong that people want their hits to hit?
---
ITT: A bunch of rank 18's acting like Legion is now garbage, even though the movement speed increase and frenzy duration increase means it will be easier to stay with someone after applying the first hit, allowing you to have an easier time on the second hit. The hivemind complex here is disgusting. I guarantee you no one will be saying any of this the second some big streamer or youtuber makes a video explaining how this doesn't mean the end of the Legion.
---
Nooot r/dbdgonewild!
---
I almost never ambush because the roar gives people time to get away especially with sprint burst. An ultra rare add on to silence it would be unreal for the odd game.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm not sure on no mither  as obviously not every match will be against a legion but maybe unbreakable and I think that‚Äôs a great combo I‚Äôd use!
---
Or just remove them while they look for a fix
---
You had hope that trash players wouldn't act like it for 5 seconds. I don't blame you.
---
\&gt; Tbh I'd I see no one is coming and I can't unhook myself I'll just suicide. I'm not playing a game with only two lives. I'll suicide and hope the killer gets you all. 
---
Your initial post says otherwise. That, or you misunderstood my post.
---
Everyone wanted him deleted out the game
---
The people who think Freddy is a bad killer probably dont play him at all, or play him well.
---
&gt; how are you meant to be able to apply it to lots of people if they nerf the speed and make it so it just straight up stops if you miss an attack
---
Haven't seen one post calling for a billy nerf or saying billy is op. Nobody I play with complains about him, nor does anyone in my 60k member ps4 community.
---
If you could link me to where the billy complaints are that'd be great
---
Grim Pantry is low - *really fucking low* - on the list of broken structure loops in this game.
---
Well there are a few reasons I enjoy it
---
I really love horror movies so the game makes me feel like I‚Äôm in one 
---
As a killer I get to relieve the anger I accumulate through out the day in a way that does not harm any one and is fun. 
---
As a survivor I get to try and outwit someone. Being able to survive against someone try to murder you is just very satisfying. 
---
If you have a hard time killing people maybe try out different killers and find a style that fits you. I‚Äôm more of a stealth killer so I prefer to use Freddy or the Wraith. They make it easier to be able to follow survivors and surprise them with a hit. If you find that everyone is gen rushing while you chase down someone, switch objectives. Try to injure as many as you can and see who‚Äôll be the easiest catch in the process. If it‚Äôs a SWF group, there‚Äôs a 10-20 percent chance you‚Äôll even get a single kill so it‚Äôs better to just build up blood points by chasing,getting hits in when you can, break pallets, and sabotaging generators.
---
Yeah they just tweeted something about becoming aware of the situation only like an hour ago and a lot of people are pretty pissed it took them this long to realize the issue when its been going on consistently for a while
---
Honestly the survivor queue time thing isn‚Äôt a code problem? It‚Äôs a ps4 problem. The demographic of console players that play killer is astonishingly lower than on pc, mostly due to the terrible and unplayable optimization.
---
Really not the sort of collusion the devs are concerned about though.
---
okay so you are fucking helplessly fuckingstupid. your brain is rotting
---
I mean, they're now a base level Killer but, yeah...
---
Frenzy is now completely useless.
---
ALL that needed to be changed was to have missed swings cancel Frenzy.
---
I didn't say this update is balanced and I'm using this meme sarcastically instead of a celebration. Sorry if that triggers you?
---
Whenever the killer catches me the game becomes unplayable.
---
All I'm going to say is if you don't see how crippling mending not ticking down in TR is, there's nothing I can do to convince you that this is an awful change.
---
Those two don't know true art and must be punished.
---
Perfect. Part of the reason I love her
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1118241246445805568?s=21
---
What lol.
---
What made the current version not fun? Did you play a lot of Legion?
---
What do prayer beads do?
---
Literally just happened to me. Played all day yesterday, and it didn't happen. Only happened today.
---
I think the fact that you get a free hit, and can sprint for longer, and can still sprint after the first hit allow you to chase the survivor longer  and then down them normally since you now move at 115% speed is fine yes. Try to actually think about things before just screaming at the devs for money back since your killer is no longer 0 counterplay.
---
Ala Heath Ledger -   
---
It's simple, we kill The Legion
---
The player base on console (at least PS4) doesn't even reach 20 percent for killers. It is extremely extremely low
---
Maybe this will be a thing. Just wait for a year or two when the devs eventually announce they will make legion a playable killer. Then wait another year or two when they eventually actually do it.
---
Well don‚Äôt give them your business then.
---
Yeah for the last month or 2 I've been maining pig, shes just a really good killer
---
Fedora man bad lol
---
Not if your a Meg hiding in a locker right next the hatch the whole game while your team gets slaughtered.
---
But yea getting out alive is a win.
---
Imagine getting annoyed at someone for quoting what you said earlier haha.
---
It‚Äôs also objectively bad to spam missed autos because it moves you faster during Frenzy.
---
It‚Äôs also objectively bad to create a killer with absolutely no counter play for the survivors.
---
I can‚Äôt outrun Legion. I can‚Äôt vault pallets because he‚Äôll follow me. I can‚Äôt hide if he hits a teammate near me. I can‚Äôt break chase because of Deep Wounds. Legion‚Äôs existence was indefensible.
---
&gt;It's objectively bad that a survivor cannot be downed with their power.
---
You must love The Plague then. You do realize she can‚Äôt down anyone with her power, right?
---
Would it be OP if there was no cancel animation if a Legion's power runs its full course? That way Legion can at least use their power to stalk and get a quick hit in versus someone already in Deep Wounds. 
---
Versus cancelling manually, getting stunned, or missing a swing would trigger the cancel animation as usual. Thus the survivor would have to time pallet slam and Legion would have to time their power use.
---
In my Opinion it's just a nerf. I hoped that they would really rework Legion...
---
see f13 remake... and then tell to me if jason still sucks:)
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
Hes the worst killer right now, 100%. His power is more useless than Leatherface's
---
I think everyone quickly forgot how awful their power was to play against, exploits and all. While these nerfs are 'Freddy level', it's better to start from the bottom and promote a now-tolerable mechanic, rather than chipping away at their power over the course of a few Mid-Patch Updates. 
---
We also don't know the numbers on their add-ons, nor any possible perk changes (which, I'd assume, are to be expected this upcoming patch). Also, like, if they're really *that* bad, I'm confident the developers will compensate them a little bit; they're pretty good at responding to PBE complaints.
---
Without giving them a full rework, Deep Wounds not decaying within their terror radius is mandatory; without reworking their power completely, how else are they suppose to stop players from exploiting it? I'd like to think the other changes speak for themselves. That said, I do hope that Mending takes longer. If survivors have a wide safety net while having Deep Wounds (i.e., not decaying while in terror radius, not decaying while mending), then I don't see a reason to not extend the duration by some significant amount.
---
I always legit tho it was a pig until now, I just zoomed in. Damn
---
Noobs sub has nothing to do with it though? If you look at the sub count ochido has more subs lol
---
So... you now spend 20 seconds to find another survivor to stab in Frenzy (with Frenzy's reduced movement speed) for them to spend 12 seconds mending?
---
Let me sell you a time machine that takes a second to travel one second into the future, you'll love it.
---
While Legion was nerfed,
---
He is still not that bad, he can still give a free hit to one or more survivors, jump Windows, he is m1 killer, but still better then freedy,Bubba,trapper,wraith.
---
He is low tier plague or worse version of plague.
---
He is the best killer of low tiers.
---
I Like low tier killers they have cool powers, and legion still has that movement and jumping, we just need to see how much movement speed of frenzy did they nerf also 115% ms buff is very nice.
---
I Like Legion.
---
They removed deep wound without removing it. This is just a killer without an ability. But who knows maybe I‚Äôll enjoy them still. Think I‚Äôll go back to pig if not.
---
Same, I feel they should make a new killer ability based off of the deep wound effect
---
Where did you pull that number from
---
Isn't stalling time better though? Like with the way the BP system is if you down all the survivors super fast with little chase or hits won't you get less BP? I love Legion and want to test these changes.
---
1) I don't play Legion, so it's not "my killer"
---
2) free hit? what the fuck are you talking about?
---
3) the speed debuff is actually insane and will prevent any of that
---
&gt;  and can still sprint after the first hit allow you to chase the survivor longer and then down them normally since you now move at 115% speed is fine yes.
---
Considering this implies that Legion goes through hall of their power bar, this means you get stunned. So no this doesn't work.
---
fucking survivor mains
---
He does. Myers also sucks. 90% of his popularity comes from sound design
---
No one played Legion as they were "designed" as survivors aren't brain-dead enough to stick anywhere near each other against a Legion.
---
That has to be the worst view on game design I‚Äôve ever fucking heard.
---
It‚Äôs not a schoolyard war of who gets to be broken and useless or fun and not fun when, it‚Äôs supposed to be BALANCE. 
---
I don‚Äôt like anything about Legion or really even their players, but they‚Äôre are just as entitled to a good time as you are considering they paid BHVR for the character.
---
someone told me about a week ago.
---
Passive aggressive much? You don't have to be an asshole just because I don't join the circle jerk of "hE's tHe nExT fReDdY"
---
Thanks for elaborating on your point. Because I must not understand the game much at all JUST because I have a different point of view.
---
Thanks, I love it
---
Survivor main here that would play Legion to vent. They became my favorite killer ( Boo you suck I know I know) I never used any exploit or cheesy method. When I heard of the changes I knew they would nerf them below Freddy but a side of me was hoping it was a full out rework. It saddens me that there power will become obsolete. I will spend the rest of my time with Legion as much as I can and attempt to adapt to the changes however I am considering finding a new main (Probably Wraith or Plague) even though it breaks my heart to think that.
---
I agree but good luck speaking out against the hivemind. Everyone turns into a game developer the second anything is announced.
---
Please link the comment because I never said that you fuckingmoron
---
Wraith suffered the same fate, as they both have no tools to help them in that regard.
---
The same things w/the bleedout timer with legion will affect BT
---
Well yeah, if you live under a virtual rock.
---
 The Legion‚Äôs **Terror Radius** is increased to 32m.   
---
 The Deep Wound timer pauses for survivors **within The Killer's Terror Radius**‚Äìregardless of whether they are in a chase or not.   
---
The good 'ol one two punch. Those two lines alone are what kill Legion worse than anything. If he chases me, his power was just a first hit for free that does nothing. If he swaps off, it's very likely I won't need to start mending for a very long time, and as soon as he leaves TR I can 99% my mending - because now mending pauses the bar - wait for the Legion to show up and then absolutely meme on them on a pallet and finish my mending then immediately drop my blood-covered claudette ass down to the ground to deliver the third and final punch the devs didn't bother mentioning.
---
No :( PC is up and running puppers is live streaming right now and playing ingame.
---
Buffs
---
‚Ä¢ 115 movespeed
---
 ‚Ä¢ Buff to iridescent add on
---
Nerfs
---
‚Ä¢ Deep wound cannot down unless the survivor is a free week player
---
‚Ä¢ Cannot see deep wound progress, served as a tool before to predict if a survivor is mending or not. Might as well hide the hook progress for killers.
---
‚Ä¢ Reduced movement speed of power
---
‚Ä¢ Lose line of sight and becomes blind while using power
---
‚Ä¢ Removed unique elements
---
So basically behaviour: 
---
"here's a normal movespeed and a buff to an add on that you will only get 1-4 times per 1 million bps. Also we're taking away everything. And no, we won't fix the bugged add-ons and just ban people."
---
the joke is he already got a save for deliverance so he doesn't need to save the guy
---
Every other kill gets punished for a missed attack, why not Legion?
---
I must be blind, because I still can't see them.
---
The game is too unstable and buggy to implement such punishment.
---
I see 3v1s being painfully common, and that 1 guy who crashes when they happen is getting punished for the game being buggy.
---
That plus we are also punishing people who are going against hackers and lag switchers.
---
Also the only difference between that punishment and not having it is that we'll add like 10 seconds of that person staying in the game, running at the killer and dying on first hook by suiciding. The effect is the same, but we have a lot of innocent people getting hurt.
---
sooo... how a killer doesnt suck?
---
This isn't final. A PTB is coming very soon and a lot of things can still be modified before they add it to the public build.
---
I'm on PlayStation but if pc was down to then I don't think it will be long till it's back up
---
&gt; sprint alongside them without hitting them,
---
I've played against many Legions that do this already so it's not like it'll be a big change.
---
Yes or as i like to call it tuesday
---
**OH, YOURE APPROACHING ME? INSTEAD OF STALKING ME FROM A DISTANCE, YOURE COMING RIGHT TO ME?**
---
*I can‚Äôt stab the shit out of you without getting closer.*
---
My bad, it wasn't you. It was someone else in the chain you decided to take over on. (As in you, responded to this comment)
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bdx86v/the_legion_update/el1ke3g/
---
Agreed or a warning in game at the veeeeery least. 
---
I warned a Legion player who was doing the exploit last night that they posted this warning, so to be careful out there now and his reply to me was a simple "stop complaining".
---
Only, I wasn't complaining. I was warning the kid cause some guy is going to report him and get him banned for doing it. 
---
Can't say I didn't try to warn him at least.
---
Imagine thinking you deserve the hatch while there's a struggling team mate you could be saving instead of being selfish
---
But you can sprint for longer now, so you might be able to get ahead of them. I'm just saying people should try it out before announcing the verdict.
---
Ah my bad, BHVR removing one window out of the 250 others iSnT FaIr tO SUrvIvoRS. 
---
But come on man, in that one building alone has around 5 windows and a few pallets JUST UPSTAIRS...
---
And their username is *‚ÄùHex: ________‚Äù*
---
What the fuck is this deranged comment you left? Because I'm pointing out how bad this re-work is that means I'm defending original Legion? Fucking lol amazing
---
&gt; You must love The Plague then. You do realize she can‚Äôt down anyone with her power, right?
---
I think she's more on the weak side but she's viable unlike this shit. And also actually interesting unlike this shit
---
Same here on PS4 but it‚Äôs been 3-4hours now and still down for us. But the PC players are able to play...
---
Go play with your 7 cats or clean of their piss-stains that I'm sure are all over your smelly house, better way to spend your time imo.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt report something that the devs want reported?
---
I hardly played the patch and this recent patch and this is what I come back to. Jesus Christ
---
I accept your apology, fuckingmoron
---
I'm not going to take the time to link you to threads you can find for yourself. Just search on the forums and/or subreddit.
---
And the timer not decreasing in TR to stop the exploit and I say it as a Legion main.
---
Myers wouldn't suck of he didnt have plot armour. Ie. Getting shot in the face and being fine the next minute even though he is a human 
---
Jason wouldn't suck if he had a reason for killing who he's killing. It's mainly just teens having sex at the wrong place at the time
---
There has to be a separate problem this is so sad. :(
---
I actually think the changes are decent.
---
It is much more risky to not heal against a 115% speed killer so survivors will try to heal up more than usual. So they would need to mend and heal in many cases.
---
We need to wait and see but I think he will be decent and less annoying.
---
Maybe his power is a little underwhelming now, but we all knew he couldn't just stay like he was before, so this is definitely a step forward, even though I hope he gets reworked in the future.
---
In my opinion this changes are good for now; Survivors now have a change against him and legion matches will be fairer for everyone, so there shouldn't be anymore DC's.
---
I never said anything to that extent, I simply said survivors can finally counterplay and no need to DC the borefest that Legion currently is.
---
I think we can all agree if I say that many people were somewhat "disappointed" when we didn't get the Legion the Trailer showed us. They should've done him like that. Tru3ta1ent had some Ideas in a few videos back on how they could've made Legion and they were pretty good imo
---
In a way there is punishment, like say it deplets the power meter, but for a one miss and all out of juice is rough.
---
Because he still gets that punishment outside the speed boost. 
---
With how wonky the game controls and plays, it's hard as hell to hit a survivor with his stupidly fast speed.
---
Cheers, I'm sorry your killer won't be a baby killer anymore :(
---
i remember someone saying that their power cuts the chase in half, you frenzy stab everyone then you M1 them regularly, looking at it that way, they are now sort of similar to Myers except not really at all? 
---
either way, we just have to wait and see how they now work in the PTB and not immediately judge the changes just from reading it, we have to play it and see how it works
---
free hit, his ability, sprint to someone and hit them, vault windows and pallets while sprinting. You literally get a free hit. 
---
And I'm not a survivor main Lmao. Telling someone a killer isn't shit tier means I'm a survivor main? Pathetic.
---
I don't have cats you fuckwit. Love how you still use the typical sjw stereotype even when I've told you I'm on the opposite side of the scale. Get out of your mother's basement some time, it'll do you some Good. You aren't shit, so stop acting like it.
---
Doesn't work because you lose collision when stunned by Frenzy wearing off
---
I think Mettle Of Man can actually stop chainsaws (I THINK) if the survivor is already injured (Straight healthy to down ignores the perk) when they get hit. 
---
Same with NOED. (Oddly enough this means Adrenaline can actually work against you if you're injured, last gen is done, adrenaline goes off, heals you to healthy, and you get insta-downed from NOED. If you were still injured, MOM would have went off and let you tank the hit.)
---
I don't even play Legion but keep living in your deranged fever dream
---
jason kills because teens killed his mother on part 1, so he kill teens for revenging his mother
---
Yep haven't been able to get on for the past two hours basically
---
Seems fine to me but I do agree with you. I'm think they won't Nerf him this hard when they deploy the live update. This is just PTB updates.
---
i main on ps4 i literally can't stand the wait times as survivor on there its unplayable half the time
---
The killer could have outsmarted him, just takes a good skillet to do so. I‚Äôve had great spots to loop and a good killer has managed to outsmart me
---
&gt;Same with NOED. (Oddly enough this means Adrenaline can actually work against you if you're injured, last gen is done, adrenaline goes off, heals you to healthy, and you get insta-downed from NOED. If you were still injured, MOM would have went off and let you tank the hit.)
---
100% correct but, by the time I get Adrenaline, I already used MoM (to extend the chase and cause the killer to lose all gens).
---
Tyde is that you? Jk. I think the knee jerk reaction needs to settle before anything can be judged.
---
I got that reference.
---
Legion's power can now be used for what it was designed for. Hitting as many survivors as possible to ensure that people are mending rather than working on gens, this buys you time and allows you to chase survivors to start hooking. This change only changes the playstyle of Legion peeps that used the power to tunnel specific individuals into the dirt.
---
This is nothing compared to the myers house
---
Lol that's what I thought.
---
I play both survivor and killer and found legion not fun to play as or against. So, go cry somewhere else.
---
&gt; And I'm not a survivor main Lmao.
---
ha okay fuckface
---
&gt; free hit, his ability, sprint to someone and hit them, vault windows and pallets while sprinting. You literally get a free hit. 
---
oh yea it's going to be so hard to get away from his huge terror radius and heavily debuffed frenzy speed
---
lmfao
---
‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve never had a problem with those windows, I have no clue what you guys are talking about‚Äù - The Legion
---
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a window?‚Äù - The Nurse.
---
Sure because EVERYONE need to be perfect at english, because its normal DUUHHHHH....
---
better get me a blendete outfit
---
yeah, i looked at downdetector and lots of people are having problems,seems like dbd isnt working on ps4
---
Yeah if it stopped there it would make sense. He had motive
---
A killer without motive is usually lame
---
Same on board with the nerd, less legions running around, he is a annoying killer!
---
Update: iridescent button works always now
---
Wow, this shows that they didn‚Äôt understand AT ALL what was wrong with the Legion, now he sucks. These devs are so incompetent, they don‚Äôt understand their designs at all.
---
when you have the tombstone add on
---
Ngl when I see people gesture like that as killer, I don't even swing at them. If they're trying to show me something, I'll gladly follow them around and see what they wanted me to see. I don't play for the 4k, and I'm curious to see what's going on. Hell, half the time, I'll just play Thanos and kill two, then meme around the rest of the game.
---
Going from 110 to 115 speed isn't a small buff. It is a huge deal. 
---
Other killers would be gutted if they were nerfed to 110.
---
I think it‚Äôs way to earlier to judge him as of yet good or bad things.
---
Bold of you to think I'd dare play Legion ever again after his Freddifying. Or have the skill to play Nurse on console.
---
Thankfully these are just PTB updates. I don't think they'd nerf him this hard in the live updates. But I'm all for increased counterplay. Maybe they reverse course on the Deep Wounds changes.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Yea I feel like this guy was not legit coz I‚Äôve never seen someone load in that quick. And if he knew where you all were then na he‚Äôs bullshit. Idk how in game reporting will go but you said this was the only game he had I think? So he will probably get banned AGAIN I assume.
---
soo why Jason sucks...?
---
can confirm, i was playing as killer and got a 4k and one of the survivors had 2008 in their name. i kinda felt like an asshole lol
---
Who hurt you. You seem to have anger issues. Shouting at internet strangers may lessen the pain but it won't really get to the root cause.
---
[This link](https://www.bacp.co.uk/search/Therapists) is for the UK but there may be more local ones for you.
---
Wait a tick. You are saying they move too fast in frenzy to score a hit, so since the dev Team is slowing down frenzy while giving base speed a boost might mean more Hits.
---
No he needed a Nerf, not to be made useless though. It doesn't need to be some kind of revenge on players who were using him
---
This is such a fuckin stupid rework and fixes nothing. Legion was low tier at best without his broken add-ons. Maybe he was annoying to play against, but this is ridiculous, and a waste of their coolest killer. Nice one BHVR!
---
Wut. You realize that Plague's power actually has a viable use other than trying to down someone, right? You also realize that Plague can injure someone without giving them the speed boost a survivor normally gets from getting hit?
---
Plague's power is very useful in a few different situations. Legion's power is only useful for one thing, and it can't even do that one thing.
---
I get that you hated old Legion, but take a break from the haterade for a sec and look at it objectively. Legion's power is literally vaulting pallets on a long CD that also stuns you now. There's no other use for it.
---
Today is a glorious day for drinking legion main tears
---
I mean those 2 windows next to eachother don‚Äôt look that safe? Can‚Äôt the killer just walk around it? Am i missing something?
---
Thank you good sir/madam ! You are not completly mentaly damaged ^(like that one over there .)
---
I found Legion a blast to play as and against. Each their own
---
I'm kinda mad about the changes but maybe it won't be as bad when I play them when it's out. I still think it's too much though like honestly and I know all the people who hate legion will disagree no matter what I say but still look at this I paid money for a killer that might literally be completely useless now this doesn't make the game healthier it makes a lot of people pissed and  it potentially breaks a killer rather than fixing them.
---
BHVR is just punished good faith players.
---
It would have been so easy to not fuck this up.
---
Make it so that a missed hit doesn't deplete the whole power bar, thus causing a stun
---
make it so that you cannot down a survivor in deep wounds but you can down a survivor simply in injured state, however that depletes the power bar.
---
and it would have been fine. but no they had to utterly destroy the killer that people paid for. this is the second time they've done this. insane
---
I mean FF's movement speed boost also got nerfed along with the change that FF can only be activated at a full power gauge. So the increased duration is counterbalanced by those two nerfs.
---
So you didn't rework him you nerfed the ***shit*** out of him. Outstanding. 
---
I mean, I don't mind because I don't even own Legion. But I thought the changes were going to alter his ability in a extensive way that actually changes his play-style and the ability at its core. That's usually what a *rework* is. Instead, they didn't change his ability, they just whacked him a couple times too many with a nerf bat. 
---
Like, is this a joke? It's kind of funny. It's like with the Wraith rework- *"They want us to change the Wraith and reinvent him- really reinvigorate the way he's played. Let's just buff his bell timer and call the entire update 'THE WRAITH CUBE'"*
---
IDK what's with all the "The Game" posts that aren't in reply to your post (The OP doesn't mention The Game) but yeah The Game is VERY killer sided depending on the killer. Billy and Huntress have major problems, especially billy due to Ace Combat Tunnel-Run style gameplay when using your chainsaw, but Doctor with Dr. Worldwide build on The Game will give major trouble to survivors. 
---
Doc's terror radius goes through the floor (Note this is AFTER the patch which added verticality to terror radius, IDK if it's because a large enough terror radius makes it go through the floor anyway with Distressing and Calm addons, or if they didn't tweak it enough, or what) + cramped quarters means you can easily keep everyone going insane at all times (Outside something like the extreme edge of the map) + benefit from Unnerving Presence or other terror radius-related perks the same way.
---
God you trolling really ? REALLY ? Are you that numb ?!? Do you really not understand even simply thing, others already explained it in way better english you still dont get it ....god let it be brain !
---
WELCOME TO THE FREDDY CLUB
---
I think it‚Äôs good it does not go down when in his terror radius cause honestly it was bullshit he could just look down so your mend just goes down
---
Legion mains disagree and so do a lot of people. I wouldn‚Äôt rather them destroy a killer I‚Äôd rather them not be stupid and actually fix the killer. There is no reason to make another Freddy after just FINALLY fixing him.
---
&gt;The Legion can no longer see blood pools (in addition to not seeing scratch marks) while in Feral Frenzy. 
---
Oh good, so now survivors don't even need their myriad of stealth perks that help them stay hidden from Legion, now they literally can't track them at all. Without being able to track blood pools with Beast Hound, now survivors can quite literally vanish with Quick &amp; Quiet or Iron Will the minute Legion loses sight of them in Frenzy. Literally fucking no-one wanted this change, and I really have to wonder where the fuck it's coming from that this was included.
---
There is ***nothing*** in these changes that is good for Legion or the game. It just shows exactly how fucking poor BHVR understands their own game. The incompetence is just so bewildering. It's inconceivable how a video game studio can be this clueless in balancing their own game. 
---
I'm literally one week back from a few months break of DBD and I'm already done with BHVR's inability to grasp basic fucking game design. I'm at the point where I'm ready to drop this game from my mind and never think about it again - BHVR's incompetence is just too frustrating to deal with anymore.
---
Say hello to the new Freddy
---
R.I.P LEGION 
---
R.I.P SUSIE MAINS
---
He sucks a slasher killer. If he was like some demon thing it would work better. 
---
Its essentially let's take this super strong (human? Demon?) Put him against some horny teens and have him lose somehow. Like what?
---
Well fair enough then. I guess ill just keep slugging for the 4k
---
I should point out that due to how sloppy the game is, the speed is often a problem. I play a lot of Myers and whenever I get T3 I always feel like I miss attacks because he's so fast and the game starts to drop FPS.
---
Basically, if the game was more stable this would be great.
---
I actually can't even log into the game. I get the 8018 error code.
---
Its too late for a refund right ugh i guess discordance is nice?
---
oof nice try kid we all see you got caught being anidiot and had to deflect
---
So instead of fixing the ways people exploit his playstyle, and making a few adjustments to make him less frustrating to deal with, they've pulled a Freddy and are putting the killer 6ft under. Glad I spent 7 bucks on trash for the second time. üò≠
---
Lol ok, I disagree, it‚Äôs a small buff... vs a large lump of many nerfs to an already weak killer
---
And other killers are already not the strongest if all they are is m1, which is why they are always mid-low tier, also, other killers have a different abilities to make up for this.
---
Legion just had all of the unique aspects taken away, with massive nerfs, and people are happy that it‚Äôs a boring m1 killer now... sad
---
beSCUSE me Freddy EXISTS thank you very much
---
For real. Claudette is a beast down there I stg
---
That would just be a better version of both spirit and nurse. Surely you realize this?
---
They actually don't want you to report DCers because their automated system already detects them.
---
So, let‚Äôs see if I got this right.  Legion gets +.2 m/s base movement speed, but is now literally incapable of downing people using his power, so if a survivor is injured there is literally no upside to using it whatsoever. Yay.
---
Thats awesome I wonder how she got the hair to stay like that! It‚Äôs great! I feel like she could have rehearsed a more twitch like movement like the one she does in game rather than dragging herself on the floor like that ( it looked like horror porn tbh)
---
I don't think it's bad but I think a lot of Pig players user their bear traps way too early in the game. 
---
She has a great end game mechanic built in to her kit and so many Piggies put traps on while there are still 4-5 gens up and have none left by the time there's 1-2 gens remaining or the gates are opened. 
---
Best to play around with builds you like depending on your playstyle tho imo :)
---
Haha that's their job to find out :p i mean honestly there isn't a single thing about legion that i like. Some people like his aesthetic, but in my opinion, the legion should have never been a dlc in the first place. I mean if i tried hard enough i could maybe think of a good idea for him but really BHVR is in too deep by releasing him like this. There's not much that can be done for him besides nerfing him into freddy land
---
Explaining a joke is like dissecting a Frog.
---
Honestly i don't think i'll be getting legion anymore,i was going to buy him when i came back but after hearing of ash perks and seeing the plague and the legion butcher,i decided not to buy him
---
something that people are missing is that the power bar depleting when an attack misses also means that you get stunned. that's insane
---
Yeah it can be bad. I play on PC as well I‚Äôve actually played more on PC but I want playstation trophies lol
---
I was wondering why my bathtub was getting full and why Frank went to the gas station to get a razor. I thought he was doing some manscaping...
---
Just heal to full, bum rush past him, find that sweet gap and escape.
---
He can‚Äôt body block both of you running from each side unless it‚Äôs a Leatherface with an active saw.
---
Have they said anything about double bloodpoints anytime soon?
---
a) nobody has actually played with this new build so they don't know how it feels yet, and b) it's not like they're never going to update them again
---
Legion is dead!! Hope everyone‚Äôs happy. And I hope the devs are happy they have another Freddy to fix when they eventually have to in a year or so. Since we ALL know they won‚Äôt be cleaning up after themselves anytime soon.
---
Even before you couldn't down a injured survivor with his power before you hit them 4 times.
---
I take back what I said.
---
Over the course of about 3 matches, I must have done exactly what I said on three or four separate occasions. I only got a +1 on my achievement counter. 
---
This will in fact be bugged and need a change for the achievement.
---
Because I didn't read the username of a comment someone left me? Lol. You need help man. I assume at playing Legion but probably in life too.
---
I hear yah and I have it on all.platforms
---
Dontblet those windows deceive you they are made by satan
---
It's like when overly vindictive Killer mains defend unacceptable survivor changes (like making Ultra Rare add ons worthless) with "well SWF is awful and everyone's sick of them!"
---
It's a massive nerf, but it'll at least be a lot less toxic to play against.  They just need to 100% fundamentally re-think Legion's ability.  It's not just poorly executed, it's poorly conceived of.
---
as a killer if there are 2 left I usually give the running chance for the hatch to the last guy working on the gen get away the guy camping the hatch is the one I kill
---
Until Freddy gets lifted out of the dumpster. Then legion will be all alone or a year while he waits for the devs to clean their mess. If they even do of course.
---
you are fucking delusional if you think that. the two things I mentioned are with the rest of the nerfs which means that the ff speed is way way way way lower than spirit's phase speed. and fucking lol at thinking that's stronger than nurse. i don't even know what to say to that. what a fucking intense delusion
---
Thought that was the point of his power from the beginning? To slow survivors down by them having to mend instead of just doing a gen
---
Getting hit by the killer right after being unhooked by a player that runs borrowed time will apply the Deep Wound Status. The same Deep Wound Status that is applied when getting hit by Legion in Feral Frenzy. 
---
If you happen to get get out of the chase, but you are still in the terror radius, you don't have to mend immediately and can still gain some distance, since the timer pauses now. You may even have time to unhook someone or work on a gen without mending immediately, as long as you are still in the terror radius.
---
Also, mending doesn't deplete the Deep Wound timer anymore with the update. If you stopped mending with an expired timer you'd get instantly put in the dying state before.
---
I feel ya man. I feel bad for the people who spent money on him but i will always believe that legion should have never been released / a thing. I sympathize with you POV but as i said in the post, i would prefer him be useless than his current state. I am perfectly happy to run into any killer but i hate seeing legion. and im not the type to dc based on killer so i just have to deal with it
---
It's worth considering what ranks you are in cuz that could help determine the likelyhood of if they have teachables from other killers. Any killer that benefits from slowing early game with ruin. Also anyone with fair map control may have it. Melee killers like Myers are very unlikely.
---
It's a long way to the other side of the wall, especially during a chase. The survivor could just hop back over either window, even if the killer goes through one. Granted, I've never had to deal with it myself but from first glance it seems sorta dodgy.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty low Myer‚Äôs %
---
I agree with you, I never abused any of those things yet now my favorite killer is possibly gonna be trash. Rip Frank
---
b√¢y gi·ªù l√† l√∫c ƒë·ªÉ t·∫•n c√¥ng
---
Every time I got hit or vomited on this mess would come up. Chases were much harder because I couldn't see the stain/ around corners
---
Makes it so survivors wearing a trap can't see Jigsaw box auras until the timer on the trap starts to tick down.
---
I didn't want to engage in a whole drawn out argument which is why I said what I said.
---
My point is the same as everyone elses: Legion is dead. There is no "different view" about it, unless you count delusion as a viewpoint.
---
I was a Legion main, and I enjoyed it very much. When played properly, Legion was a blast to play and with the right perks he could cover his weaknesses and be a good killer. They nerfed the weakest part of the legion, and a 5% movement speed increase won't help. The original intent of the power was to "spread the love" between as many survivors as you could, chaining frenzy until you settled on a target to take down normally. BHVR decided to pander to the vocal majority (survivors who dislike Legion) and Freddy him. But hey, that's what BHVR does. They don't actually rework, they just tiptoe around and actual solution and fuck things up in the process.
---
The thing with mending gets on my nerves too.  Survivors are physically incapable of bleeding out while the killer is chasing them or is even remotely nearby, meaning the only reason anybody would ever go down from deep wound in a normal game Is if they literally just forgot to mend. What used to be an interesting mechanic is now a mild inconvenience at best
---
&gt;We shouldn‚Äôt report something that the devs want reported?
---
I copied this from their official statement... They **don't** want players to report DCers
---
Ummm. Freddy can only injure and down survivors when they're asleep. If there's multiple people around, yeah sleep them all. But yeah, you're supposed to wait for them to fall asleep so you can chase them. The sleep mechanic then slows the game down if they get away.
---
How are the wait times on xbox?
---
Just wait, you'll play against it and then complain when you get hit early in the chase. No sense trying to argue with you when you resort to using 'fuckface' in an argument lol
---
I wasn't responding to you, sorry!
---
Or when the survivor tries to unhook themselves after being hooked when you're crouched very close to them waiting for the terror radius to drop before the hook. Just wait dammit!
---
I am not talking about Legion specifically. I personally wait for the PTB to form my complete opinion on it.
---
I am just saying that having 115 movement speed instead of 110 is a big deal.
---
You will catch up to survivors 33% quicker with 115 movement speed. There is a vig difference when trying to down a survivor in a chase with Wraith or with a Huntress without her hatchets.
---
"There's no getting out of this now. We're too good at it." ‚Äî The Legion.  Don‚Äôt worry friend, we will over come this
---
It looks like a buff for how i play him (ff ,chase, end ff next to surv and whack them)
---
To me, Legion was a killer that made survivors fear pallets and windows, things normally safe (except for Nurse who breaks the game). Legion absolutely needed changing as there was really little counter-play, and I can agree with most of the changes made (coming from an on-and-off Legion main). 
---
Unfortunately, I see this change removing what I felt was the core aspect of the killer: fear of pallets and windows in a chase. Feral Frenzy and Deep Wound are now pointless in a chase after the first hit. Successive hits do nothing and there is no fear or punishment to a survivor for being hit. Legion‚Äôs power is nearly useless in the end game now. 
---
IMHO, I think a right balance to include with these changes would be integrating the iridescent button ability to break pallets by vaulting. Feral frenzy wouldn‚Äôt directly hurt survivors, but it would serve a purpose in a chase for the killer to remove a pesky pallet quickly and set up for the end game. As Feral Frenzy has a cool down where the killer is immobilized and the survivor has a chance to run away, it will not serve as a free down and it will get rid of the killer‚Äôs power for a while. This would be no different than Billy or Leatherface breaking pallets with their ability.

Ok buddy

I don't mean physically trap, I mean force them into an area. Similar to clown gas.
---
It's like a meme. I don't actually know if Dwights are more common in Lockers, but that's probably what lead to the meme. I mean it's a really old joke, so I can't pinpoint the source, but If I had to guess I'd say probably someone mentioned it. And then it caught on and just grew from there. 
---
Don't mind the joke- Killers aren't actually more likely to check lockers if they're facing 4 Pizza Dwights.
---
Oh my god yesssss üòÇüòÇ this is amazing haha
---
But why using FF to hit them in the first place?  Just hit them with basic attack like a M1 killer, cause it doesn't matter if you stab them multiple times now.
---
Talking from a console perspective, how are you supposed to hit all survivors during FF when they run around you like crazy? It's very hard to juke around after them without wasting a lot of time for that perfect moment to hit them, giving you a high chance of missing. And for that you're punished and removed from FF. Seems like the power itself became obsolete. I didn't use FF much anyway, mostly for fast travel, but for those that used it to initiate a chase it's completely garbage now. I guess this will work for me as I already played Legion as a M1 killer and just went for 2 basic hits.
---
&gt; and then complain when you get hit early in the chase
---
...This is already possible with multiple killers and I don't complain. Fuckingmoron
---
The Plague have the posibility to become a ranged killer with 115% speed, more than the new Legion will ever have.
---
Legion needed some changes, but now it's just too weak.
---
okay so i agree that they should "actually fix him" but how? as i keep saying, the only way to fix him is to completely change his power. His current power is run too fast, unlimited stab, mend simulator. Those three things should never be apart of this game based on how a survivor is to counter a killer. And those three things are the only things he does. His power doesn't work with this game.
---
I just want to give an example, people and myself HATE mending. Run to corner - hold r1 to mend. There's nothing interactive about that. Now lets look at a good idea like plauge. She affects you but you can counter it, when you're affected you get to run to a cool little fountain, it heals you, doesn't take long, and it feels interactive. The legion's power is the opposite of what players want. ya feel?
---
Make him his Sweeney Todd character!!!!!
---
The Demon Barber would be so much fun.
---
I know what you mean, I still think it could've all been solved with some smaller changes though.
---
Right after they tried to unfreddy Freddy. Another mess they made that they‚Äôre not gonna fix or acknowledge for a year.
---
Weren't you just complaining that leigon is getting a heavy nerf? So what are you insulting someone else who plays leigon for?
---
i think he just wanted everyone to know he has Ash

---
So getting hit early in a chase is totally possible with multiple killers, but not with Legion, who can move faster than all of them and vault pallets? You're not making sense here.
---
But... compared to the list of massive nerfs, there isn‚Äôt a real point in playing legion as an m1 character because the other m1 characters are better
---
I‚Äôm not saying my opinion will be fact either... just stating what I think... I‚Äôll be playing the ptb as well. But I‚Äôm very disappointed in bhvr for yet another freddy botch...  instead of reworking a character for balance to killers AND survivors, they just give them the nerf hammer straight to Hell...
---
Legion will be the new Freddy till another op killer comes out and then they Nerf them to hell and make Legion decent again. Circle of life
---
I'm fine with this.
---
It's my favourite game, but I'm so sick of the lobby issues with it
---
Can we just remove this guy from the game? Like I love the character, love the idea, love the visuals. I like the backstory. But the constant *justified* whining for ***months*** is getting tiring. This douche has been a complete disaster from start to finish. 
---
Just make him a Survivor, actually. He's their height anyway. We don't have a survivor who's a deranged fuckface with a mask. Now's our chance.
---
That's different than a free hit you fuckingmoron
---
I can't even imagine who thought this would result in a positive feedback
---
&gt; They need to implement two changes and they would‚Äôve fixed legion.
---
Two changes?  For an ability without any real counter?  FFS that seems really out of touch, feral frenzy needs a *fundamental* rework.
---
You beat me to it lol.
---
But yeah I completely disagree with the nerfs. I don't even have legion but I agree the moonwalking shit was stupid and needed to go. (But I would have had a medium radius that's not terror radius that freeze deep wound, and kept being able to see blood. I thought the whole point was you can't see scratches in frenzy so sloppy butcher or bloodhound would help you track if they got away) 
---
There's a few changes I think seems reasonable or a step in the right direction but many of them seem absolutely knee-jerk and heavy-handed.
---
Respect. I've seen legions like you and they make me hate that particular match less than other legion games. But legion from the start was a huge mistake. I think we can all agree on that
---
I like the idea, but maybe the rank limit should be lower, around 15 or 14, but it‚Äôd also be harder to implement. It might turn off a lot of people.
---
But I‚Äôm pretty sure the Survivor tutorial mentions this, but you‚Äôre not thrown into it when you boot up the game for the first time. Maybe something should be changed so that first time players actually play the tutorial before jumping into a match.
---
Susies are the worst tbh, I saw more susies use the double blade then any other legion.
---
If people didnt abuse the mechanic and moonwalk this wouldnt have been put in place. Yell at people breaking it causing the need for this.
---
So legion is literally unusable now.. gg
---
&gt;You must love The Plague then. You do realize she can‚Äôt down anyone with her power, right?
---
So just aside from all the other stuff in your comment: 
---
You do realize that the corrupted puke is part of her power right? 
---
Your point is valid: There are enough killers with powers that wont put the survivors in the dying state but the Plagues power is not one of these killers.
---
And no frenzy mid chase.
---
But they lowered the speed of ff also... so it‚Äôs kind of hard to hit multiple people if they all run away... unless they buffed the time in ff by a lot
---
If you had your way, I‚Äôm sure all survivors would take fourteen hits. 
---
If you honestly think anything other than two or three changes is absurd, you‚Äôre out of touch with the actual problem that legion presents.
---
Bbq and chili the perk, oof you hook all the survivors you get 100%
---
More blood points
---
yeah I'm pretty sure it specifically says you have to down people while IN frenzy to get it. and hitting a wounded survivor while in frenzy now does nothing, so... derank so you stomp noobs who don't notice the "mend" prompt?
---
they tweeted that they knew the issue about an hour ago and were working on fixing it
---
Yeah, I played the tutorial and even I forgot it existed. It's just kind of there with nothing mentioning outside of a box on the main screen
---
Also getting this error code on PS4 right now.
---
They said on their Twitter that it is down worldwide right now
---
Same, getting codes 8014 and 8015
---
What changes do you think should have been made? His power never worked with this game in the first place. His only options were, get a completely new power or get nerfed into the ground. If they decide to change his power it's going to be a LONG time before that happens so i think this is the best solution. But i think that because i play against him rather than as him.
---
Did they ever threaten bans for Hillbilly's double chain addon causing crazy heal time?
---
INstead fo people hating you for playing with it its you who is going to hate playing the character.
---
LMAO what is the difference? If you get hit you get hit. With wraith or pig it's a jumpscare and with legion it's them chasing you. Literally there is no difference. I agree with the last part though, hoo wee.
---
People exploiting that was what caused the terror radius to be put in effect.
---
So annoying dud.
---
Today, I believe it was a legion update!
---
Survivors mains will try to targetting Nurse and Spirit, I tell ya.
---
PC master race for a reason.
---
No. Not even close.
---
I play both as well, and I have the opposite opinion? So? 
---
I find nothing wrong with legion... (other than a few things like franks and moonwalking)
---
&gt;If you had your way, I‚Äôm sure all survivors would take fourteen hits.
---
Nice strawman, Legion main.  I see you're an intellectual titan.
---
&gt;If you honestly think anything other than two or three changes is absurd, you‚Äôre out of touch with the actual problem that legion presents.
---
I'm 100% aware of the problems with Legion.  It isn't just exploits, it's the fact that his ability has no counter, that as it is, he's the most ezmode killer in the game, with effectively free first hits that survivors have no way of avoiding.
---
It is still an update. The word update doesn't imply good or bad. It does seem to be more of a nerf but im gonna wait till the patch and a few games before I decide.
---
I'm not all that surprised they made Legion worse, but I didn't expect them to be THAT much worse. Jesus, this is so bad I can't even conceive it.
---
At least they have a couple good perks
---
If they dont do anything to the achievement requirement, then yeah that's really the only way
---
Yes, but we don't know how much they decreased the speed, and still its faster than 115% which allows for faster mobility, and with the increased duration the distance you're able to cover is basically the same, maybe even more, thats on the specific numbers, and unless you run add ons that increased FF duration using just bits of the gauge at times was basically never worth it, and even with add ons.
---
I agree with you there, I just think you're supposed to use FF to track survivors like Doctor, and you can still choose to tunnel, but the changes advise in another direction, as well as make survivors waste time, and now that you can do a proper chase having the other three survivors mend gives you enough time to down one of them.
---
And we still don't know his reworked add ons.
---
I paid for this game and didn't get any enjoyment out of a moonwalking legion. You cant make that excuse because it goes both ways. If people didnt abuse the exploits so much a lot of these changes wouldnt exist.
---
9 times out of 10 survivors dont have one. Even then Billy can down them easier than doc would IF they had one
---
He stomps at lower ranks, but had like third worst kill rate at rank 1, before hag and wraith got their buffs, so I imagine they're stronger than him now.
---
Personally I love Hag and Spirit. No 4.6m/s  needed.
---
Didn't the devs said they were no longer going to make big nerfs/changes without testing them before and getting feedback?
---
I get that the addon exploit needs fixing and also the "moon walking" thing some legions do, but this seems overkill.
---
They are going to do the same exact thing they did with freddy and over-nerf legion because fuck sensitive balancing.
---
Everyone searching for the totem is better than everyone gen tapping, if all 4 look for the totem it will take 30 seconds to find
---
I cannot stress, how much I am disappointed with this update. They are giving legion the Freddy treatment and nerfing him to shit, when he isnt even that strong..the mainly issues with legion is  
---
Frank's Mixtape, Moonwalking, and the no in chase counterplay.  
---
They didnt address Frank's   
---
The fixed the moonwalking by pausing it in terror radius, but in the process remove being able to monitor the deep wounds timer, made the mend pause when survivors mend themselves..making there be no point to even use feral frenzy other than for catch-up  
---
Cant see blood, but if they removed the whole ability to moonwalk seeing blood wouldnt matter cuz he cant moonwalk survivors.  
---
Reduce the feral frenzy movement speed, even though billy can have 115% movement speed and a 230% chainsaw speed (this change will be okay if they buff the movement speed addons for legion)  
---
Increased his terror radius, which makes no sense and is pretty unnecessary cuz he cant moonwalk, also survivors mending when legion runs away is even MORE effective bcuz it pauses the timer.  
---
This change is just hot garbage and hes gonna seriously be garbage if this goes live.  
---
This is how i see legion being played: Hit a survivor with frenzy, Catch Up, Then chase in normal form.  
---
Very intuitive gameplay, and before someone says "Killer main" or something, im glad they removed the ability to moonwalk as legion, but i feel like they went kinda overboard with the nerfs, im glad they did make more in chase counterplay with the whole "if they miss with feral frenzy they get stunned" but i dont think it should be 1 miss, maybe like 2 misses Its a crowd control ability to fucks sake.  
---
Im just really annoyed with this change but i would like to hear everyones opinions
---
Evident by what? Having BOTH the frenzy unable to down people AND being cancelled after a missed attack. DO THE DEVS EVEN FUCKING THINK?
---
Lol love it
---
What about daddy Jeff?
---
Dude they have been balancing this game like crazy what are you talking about? they changed maps for less pallets, pallet vacuum gone, no more D strike. Survivors used to be extremely over powered. I know people can debate about MoM but look at this on a grander scale my dude. Open your mind, look at the history of the game. Also he was the most annoying killer with no counter/no fun. this has nothing to do with the devs taking sides
---
ü¶Ä ü¶Ä ü¶Ä LEGION IS GONEü¶Ä ü¶Ä ü¶Ä
---
Which I could have gotten through the shrine, like I did with Freddy
---
This is true, but you could do that if you needed to.  I personally didn‚Äôt want to do that often, but it was nice to know it was possible.   It could even occasionally wind up being the correct play. For instance, if you lost a survivor mid-Chase for a while, and found them a bit after. They‚Äôd have sometimes bled to the point you only needed one last hit
---
Because it‚Äôs finally a day where survivors aren‚Äôt throwing a temper tantrum?
---
People said the same thing about the ranking changes and those made it onto live unchanged.
---
i can tell you put a lot of hard work into this
---
You make a good point, and I agree that mending should be visible to Nurses Calling.  But punishing mending close to the killer won't really help much.  With the new changes, there's no need to mend close to the killer since the timer will pause inside his terror radius.
---
Do we even still consider Freddy ‚Äúbad‚Äù anymore?
---
I just played him a bunch at Rank 11 and was able to at least 3Kill-minimum all my games. 
---
Maybe people forgot how to counter him?
---
I didn‚Äôt realize they made Legion‚Äôs power defensive. 
---
I also didn‚Äôt realize that Deep Wounds was a benefit for survivors, not a consequence of being hit.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt handle the truth.
---
Nah, at least Freddy can slow the game down, Legions basically crowd control and nothing else now, this isn't a fix, its a fucking debuff.
---
What is his logic? Because it's blatantly not and I have to question a lot of things about people who think that
---
Cue the Michael Jackson callbacks.
---
LF means leather face right? You cannot seriously tell me you think Leather Face Sloan‚Äôs down the game.
---
Nurse bandages
---
And add Michael Myers body pillow
---
Peanits, do you know the thought processes behind these changes? Because these seem like they're kinda poorly thought out. Maybe there's something we're missing as a community, and if so I'd love to hear it
---
What about queues (:
---
People complaining about how BHVR made them waste their money or their money is now wasted lol. No one forced you to buy the chapter, and you should know that drastic changes will and can be made in the future lol. Thats like spending money on a character just for its perk and then it gets nerfed or rendered useless and saying "damn devs wasting my money". No, no one forced you to spend money on a killer. You're money isn't wasted stop crying lol.
---
Unless it's been changed, I'm pretty sure Sony's system still does not allow devs to change the text or names of trophies. Which is why the Huntress' trophy for downing survivors from far awy still requires 100 downs, while it was changed to 20 on other platforms. some other games even have typos in their trophies because of it. so this could be a problem.
---
could you fuck off and stop flaming? i main survivor and think the changes are bad too. be mad at the devs rather than your fellow playerbase retard
---
Main issue with Freddy is his mechanics can be abused by a SWF wayyyyy harder then most killers.  Survivors in comms can really play around him HARD by comparison.  If they can constantly relay positions and where Freddy is they can very safely get out of sleep and if they are any good at looping he has no way to really handle it unless you do the standard enduring + spirit's fury.
---
Against 4 randoms he doesn't feel terrible, nowhere near some of the better killers but certainly doable.
---
Losing frenzy on missed attacks is actually my favorite part about the changes.
---
It sucked 360ing some bad legion 4 times only to get hit the 5th time because there was no penalty on them missing.
---
Same, never ever played toxic. I actually got messages from survivors telling me how fun our matches were cause I was always struggling to make it fair and fun to everyone. I barely used FF, mostly for fast travel, but what they did now to their power is unreasonable.
---
I guess I won't be much affected as I always played him as a M1 killer, hitting them twice with basic attacks, but they butchered my boy Frank :( We'll see how it works in Tests.
---
Can't play her for shit thanks to how shitty my ears are after years of power tools, but her design is awesome and I can certainly see the appeal.
---
Tbf Jane was moments away from dying because she crashed her car into a lake so it‚Äôs easy to say that she drowned to death and her body was swept away. Can‚Äôt make the same excuse for Kate though.
---
Yes, you are missing something, the part where it states they are all the same team. Companies allocate and reallocate resources to different areas (e.g. teams) giving different prioritization based off what goals they have. Hence, why you can have a department that is understaffed with poor resource allocation because it may not be viewed as important enough by the decision makers.
---
I think they could keep the power but do this:
---
Keep the feature where the mending doesn't decrease if they're in the terror radius so that the the killer can't chase them from a distance or moon walk, that being said keep their radius bigger too
---
Make it so if they miss a feral frenzy attack it decreases some of the gauge not all of it and if they hit a survivor that has deep wound it still damages the meter but they suffer from the stun for much longer and maybe make their vision a little more dark too. Also make the damage to the injured survivors bar less and less the more they attack them. That way no three shot downs.
---
Change the speed like they did and make it a tad slower and change add ons so that they increase speed and recharge rate of the frenzy.
---
Keep the change that requires a full bar to activate frenzy too.
---
Maybe make it so vaulting a pallet or window takes away from the meter too so that legion has more limits to where they can go.
---
A few questions.
---
1. So if Iridescent Button applies his terror radius across the whole map doesn't that render Deep Wound useless when using it? Granted having the terror radius applied to the whole map does have it's own perks.
---
2. So what happens with Frank's Mix Tape?
---
They should have made his terror radius standard, make it were only THE LEGIONS deep wound didn't go down in terror radious, and decreased the vaulting speed. This shit they did is just a fucking debuff.
---
Unfortunately not for everyone:(
---
Because outside of the safe loops the map isn't hard to play as killer. Survivors get lost and have trouble keeping up on what gens are done, not to mention totems tend to last longer on that map. Mix in the small layout of the map and the fact that your terror radius is everywhere, survivors can often struggle on that map. Outside of Hillbilly, Huntress and Nurse I don't mind playing the map as killer.
---
So you just want to delete legion then I guess
---
I agree about nurse it's just hard for me to give an opinion as i play on console. I'm actually a console nurse main and she's really not very strong at all on console. So i really don't wanna get into that. One thing i will say about nurse is that at least it has a skill gap. Unlimited stabby plus super fast speed just doesn't work in this game. As far as him still being able to vault, at least the have gotten rid of his ability to exploit with moonwalking and things of that nature. PLUS a huge change is if he misses he's out of feral frenzy. I can't tell you how many times i've 360'd a legion 2+ times just for him to finally land that hit that makes me mend. AND THEN the asshole has the audacity to turn around and walk in my direction. I mean the shit is just annoying. They may have nerfed him bad, but the most important thing is they erased the annoying stuff
---
I‚Äôve been trying to find a game for about an hour. No luck yet
---
Can you even hear yourself with your head that far up your ass?
---
I think this is supposed to be the """rework"""
---
A lot of survivors want her destroyed. There are people in the Legion post who are acting like Legion is *still* broken and others calling for a Plague nerf. It's insane. And the devs need to stop listening to the fucking survivor mains. Every time they do we get shit like this and Fredyy
---
You do realize that you‚Äôre not forced to cleanse and give her corrupted right?
---
My point is that just because a power can‚Äôt down a survivor, doesn‚Äôt make it ‚Äúindefensible‚Äù.
---
if it makes you feel any better i probably wont be able to find a game till everyone else can get on
---
I agree, but good luck voicing anything against the hive mind.
---
Another clueless survivor main that'll tell me to "git gud" and other meme shit while the phaggot runs around using Mettle of Man, Borrowed Time, Deliverance, and probably Unbreakable or Adrenaline while playing with his SWF butt-buddies he met in a Furry Discord.
---
it's worse than that. legion was always worse than Freddy, now he's infinitely worse than that.
---
I‚Äôm gonna repeat myself here but Jane crashed her car into a lake before she got taken so it‚Äôs safe to assume everything thinks she‚Äôs dead, especially when the end of her bio says they held a funeral for her and all of the episodes of her show having a message at the beginning wishing her peace.
---
Nah, just give legion a standard terror radius and a slower vault speed, and rework his broken add-ons, and the killer would work as normal. And maybe keep the deep wound change for JUST the legions deep wound timer.
---
It‚Äôs been down since like 10 am pacific
---
Except its around 10 seconds where you could just spend that time downing and hooking that survivor so them *and one other survivor* can't be working on gens for a longer period of time.
---
Tapp is not in either ;-;
---
Why can't they add like a chance system? Like 3 misses and your out. The only reason why I think it's harsh, it's because the game loves to drop frames mid chases as killers.
---
That's what I've been thinking, I can't even imagine whatever power they'd give freddy that would make him viable. Maybe make him visible, leave dream state alone and he can hit without them being in dream state but whenever they are in dream state they have blindness and cant see auras, progress bars fill slower as usual and they can be tracked when out of TR?
---
Even that would be wayyy OP or wayy underpowered depending on exact numbers.
---
It's most likely due to the connection between you and the killer. As the killer is hosting, if it hits on his machine you get hit on your client. It will probably be fixed with servers as long as you also don't have ass internet
---
In all seriousness likely Doctor. I'm a doc main and IMHO Doc can mine survivor salt just as good as (if not better than) Legion. He slows the game down, makes skillchecks a pain in the ass, is 3-gen king, and outright disables items in tier 3 madness (So no flashlights, medkits, etc.). 
---
With addons you can cause exhaustion in tier 3 madness, so you can zap someone to tier 3 when a chase starts and disable Dead Hard, Lithe, Balanced Landing, etc. 
---
Also, you can time your shock and prevent pallet drops, vaults, etc. 
---
I don't think Doc needs any changes and is fine as he is, but he is definitely frustrating to play against because he pretty much says "Fuck your shit" and blocks your progress and prevents actions like flashlight saves, stealth, etc.
---
Cat Nea is the most accurate
---
It has recently become possible to change your online ID on PS4, but I have been putting it off because it's possible to lose your in-game content for some games that don't support this change. Can anyone confirm whether Dead by Daylight is compatible?

I agree. I‚Äôm okay with waiting a __bit__ for another legion rework or buffs to actually make this killer good. I wouldn‚Äôt have such a problem with this change of the devs didn‚Äôt take a year and a half to fix Freddy. History repeats itself in this shite game and I‚Äôm personally not looking forward to waiting that long for my favorite character to get destroyed. I‚Äôm not bias either. He needed a change. I just don‚Äôt think this rocket launcher nerf was what was needed.
---
Congratulations my friend. You have done it lol i really have no complaints with anything you just said. You kept the important nerfs like terror radius and mending bar. And that entire 2nd paragraph is gold. I doubt BHVR would actually make this change but this is actually a pretty healthy balance for his stupid power
---
Lmfao oh no, the killer gave me this status effect that literally does nothing to me, whatever shall I do?!
---
I'm sorry you're a potato that refuses to do a gen if you're not healthy
---
Same thing happening to me
---
Yea. Those changes are dumb
---
Yeah he probably isn‚Äôt even the weakest killer honestly, and mostly gets dumped on for memes. Although there are very good reasons they are reworking Freddy and the bottom tier has been deemed Freddy Tier.
---
The way I foresee it, their game "goal" is somewhat similar to the Pig's. Her sneak attack is rarely useful against Survivors that keep looking around, but the time wasting power of her Bear Traps is immense. Likewise, the Deep Wounds also waste much of the survivors' time while chases can be closed out like with the Pig.  
---
I'm not sure if **completely** depleting the Frenzy meter on missed attacks is a good thing tho. Then again, I can't recall the last time a Legion player missed an attack ...
---
Sadly he does.
---
If it was 2 I wouldn't be mad but I think 3 is too much. 
---
It forces legions to actually swing when they know they can get it and not just spam it aimlessly until something hits.
---
Yep. That‚Äôs how I feel. I would have never bought them had I known it would have been this.
---
I mean, I don't really care. I just voice my opinion hoping somebody with same or different views engages in good faith discussion with me so we both can learn something, or just me, or just the other person. I don't give a shred of a fuck about ranters and one liners.
---
Let's all take a moment and realize this guy made a brand new account because of the legion changes. That is all.
---
Some people do use blood mid chase my good sir.
---
Lowkey it helped a bit
---
Havent had it happen to me but this morning had about 5 games in a row where the killer dced
---
I'm talking about the legion on the PTB where the mend timer would pause when a survivor is mending, you'll know if they are mending in a corner if you are not in a chase and the timer does not go down.
---
I'm referring to that version since mending is reverted to the PTB version.
---
Nah, Leatherface and Trapper are better because their powers actually do something
---
The crab dance will never get old... thank you for the blessing today
---
Thank you ( :
---
Delete the legion's power\*
---
I was really looking forward to something sensible. This is *extremely* discouraging
---
I wouldn't say his power is useless in a chase - you can still vault things quickly which is huge. You can catch up to survivors and cancel your power to deny windows/pallets similar to windstorm wraith. I feel like stun reduction add-ons will be some of his best add-ons.
---
legion's "power" is to actually apply the borrowed time buff, it always has been. so now that buff is being buffed again to weaken Legion; thus, they buffed borrowed time as well.
---
Cry some more
---
Yeah, he still has his power. He's just way more fair right now.
---
You are like a sidegrade to Wraith now. The first hit on people is free, you can tag multiple people, but you still need to chase people as normal.
---
No clipping. Look it up scrub.
---
maybe baby survivor players, but any survivors that are aware wont be phased by the layout of the game, i rarely have issues playing on survivor end on the game, but on killer is always everyone on a gen, while one person abuses the safe loops, also the totems spawns on the game are so widely known it isnt even hidden anymore, like at some point i gotta chase through the safe loops to hopefully get the pallets down, but that wastes so much time, and they can just do the gens and escape, like its so difficult if im not playing a killer that works well on the game, i.e. doctor or hag everyone else its just terrible.
---
I'm not saying the vaulting thing was soley his issue. People and myself HATE mending. Run to corner - hold r1 to mend. There's nothing interactive about that. Now lets look at a good idea like plauge. She affects you but you can counter it, when you're affected you get to run to a cool little fountain, it heals you, doesn't take long, and it feels interactive. The legion's power is the opposite of what players want. I can't tell you how many times i've 360'd a legion 2+ times and he still ends up landing that hit that makes me have to mend. Once he's about 10 meters from you and he activates FF there's literally no getting away from his hit unless you land a pallet on his head. Which it's easy to respect pallets while in frenzy. The unlimited swings thing is ridiculous i love that if he misses he has to cooldown cause i out-move legions like crazy and yet they still hit me after a short amount of time
---
Personally I do think they're being a bit....over dramatic, but at the same time thanks to PTBs and Play through videos people had plenty of chance to see what Legion was like and try them out before buying the DLC, and now that it's changed, it brings up an interesting question:
---
How much can a game/dlc change before it's not what you originally paid for, and if so can you request a refund and have that game/dlc unavailable to you as a result?
---
While I don't think this is enough of a change to warrant a refund, especially as no one's tried it out yet, it does raise the initial question of how big a change can warrant making it a different product than what was paid for, and as such if you weren't given the product you paid for you have a right to a refund.
---
Things are looking up. There in charge now and they seem to be listening. Also don't forget their reworking freedy. The question now is, what are they going to do when theirs nothing left to complain about?
---
As Hag or Trapper, those are some of the best holes.
---
Legion was a riskless, less rewarding nurse
---
Nope
---
Looks like its time to put some points into Ace lol
---
Yeah,  buy people who intentionally vault windows that should be blocked due to another bug don‚Äôt get banned. Fuck the devs.
---
thank you ever so much!
---
You can't really activate BT on a killer with 0-8 TR anyway, so it doesn't really matter
---
The fact that the timer no longer depletes because of so much stuff, he can't lower the timer and he can't down is complete and total overkill. F tier now, fucking hell.
---
Exactly! Since i've joined this community i only think and listen and i promote it every chance i get there are just some people with their heads way to far up their ass. Salty and entitled. It's a lot of variables as to why there's so many people in this community who are fucked in the head
---
Interesting bait
---
Thx, its my background at work now.
---
I mean we can‚Äôt reallu judge anything right now let‚Äôs just wait for the ptb
---
What I mean by the multiple stab thing is with the wall hacks you get when you stab someone. Kind of like you already do, where you see all in your TR after getting one hit on them.
---
I actually don't even know if this is a bug or a hack. Sooo... maybe?
---
At least they farmed with us
---
I have an idea... how about we make Legion's power practically 
---
#useless, 
---
therefore making Freddy a better alternative
---
What a shitty rework.
---
You have no idea how thankful I am that I spent my shards on Spirit, rather than Legion.
---
He's way more fair and healthy. 
---
He's like a sidegrade Wraith now. The first hit is free, you can tag multiple people, but you chase normally later.
---
Also they are getting rid of the moonwalking exploit. And he's still better than Freddy.
---
Just make sure you know where the nearest escape route is whenever you‚Äôre working on a gen/whatever. Figure out which areas don‚Äôt have pallets and avoid them, try getting gens in those areas done and out of the way so you don‚Äôt have to try to escape from them in critical moments
---
okay. don't respect yourself, that's fine. if you don't care about getting what you paid for or quality products that's none of my business
---
It was a wraith and he blocked both of us by standing in the middle?
---
Yeah he got nerfed HARD
---
You can't body block while in frenzy so it's not in any way similar to windstorm wraith.
---
Lollipop is one word.
---
Honestly I wasn't going to continue on, but now that you've made it a huge deal I gotta.
---
I am pretty sure that they haven't touched Freddy until now for 2 reasons:
---
They don't know how to make him better without breaking him.
---
People hate playing him so they don't fix him on purpose to keep people from picking him.
---
In either case, don't expect them to 'fix' Freddy.
---
What
---
Only good thing to come out of it was inridecent button change. Smh ruined the only killer I had fun with, at least I got him p3 before
---
BILL
---
Funnily enough, I think if they would make it so we could see the timer instead of hiding it from us it would give the legion a built in Whispers after he injures someone.  I mean...  With how fucking awful he is why not at least let him have the bhvr.
---
No one escapes embarrassment
---
What the fuck?  
---
I like that you are talking to us, so please listen up for this one. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE WANTED.  
---
Legion is ANNOYING right now, and have issues. FIX THEM.  
---
By doing this, you don't fix the problem, you just made a new one. Legion was already weak on a standard basis, he relied fully on addons. But now? Why the fuck even bother. This isn't going to be good.  
---
His power? Useless. His appeal? Useless. THIS Legion? Useless.  
---
REWORK HIM, not NEFR. Please, for the love of the entity, don't go through with these changes, literally nobody wanted this. We wanted a rework, not a fucking butchering .
---
missing a skill check from healing yourself will also wake you up
---
I would say depends ∆°n the Legion. Per Player experience.
---
Sounds better than the Lobby Simulator Edition we have right now. Will it be cheaper than the Infinite Loading Edition?
---
Ok.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre a Legion main.
---
Looks like you‚Äôre gonna actually have to learn how to play this game.
---
Definitely some assholes that rather ruin someone's main then help make it better like, the community should instead of fight each other push the devs to make it fun for both sides but for some ig that's too hard to think about
---
Legion was completely unfair to play against, as he ignored everything the survivors had to defend themselves. With Frank's mixtape and moonwalking those things were pushed to extreme.
---
The new one is like a sidegrade Wraith. Your first hit is free, but you have to get the 2nd hit normally. Plus he's infinitely healthier to the game, as he now has actual counterplay, except "don't let him ever see you, hurr durr".
---
This happened to me [once as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ahi5p8/excuse_me_but_could_you_let_me_down_so_i_can_wipe/) That was 2 months ago. Doesn't appear to be common.
---
I like the rain
---
These changes would set them up to be just like Plague, easy injuries then just M1s for downs. But their injury is easier still than Plagues (although it can now be juked as they only get once chance to hit), and they're a lot shorter, which does make a significant difference, so they'll probably have an easier time getting downs that she does without corrupt purge. Aside from that, they also have significant mobility with Frenzy.
---
Depending on how much slower and longer Frenzy lasts, it could be very powerful mobility on a 115 killer, it was already decent when just used for mobility before. Most likely though, the reduced speed keeps it the same as it was, because devs don't like buffs with reworks. I don't think the increase to its charge time or the decrease to its speed are necessary since it can no longer down, so I hope they ease up on those so it can be used more frequently for mobility.
---
A major issue with this though: Previously, if you wanted to down without using Frenzy, you would use it to chase and corral a survivor into a dead area of the map, then go after them with m1. Since it no-longer does anything to wounded survivors, they'll just stand in a safe zone and tank it before they continue looping you. It either needs to do something, or be very cheap to cancel, so that letting it hit you is still somewhat dangerous. Possibly it either causes the bar to bleed for a few seconds, even while in the terror radius, or it increases the time of Mending.
---
I think mending should be made more interesting as well, an easy way to do that would be to give it constant, large skill-checks like when snapping out of madness (minus the random positions). Failing decreases progress and signals the killer, neither of which are too dangerous now since you can pause the bar and Legion can't down you with it, but it will still take up time and give Legion some map-knowledge.
---
One other thing that they could do to make Legion fit their unique fantasy a little better, and to give them a little bit more strength now that they're probably going to need it: Legion has no red stain while not in frenzy. It plays to their fantasy of almost passing for a survivor, and it makes their looping much more threatening even without Frenzy. Considering that a killer can already manually hide their stain and can use it for mind-games, I'm not sure how much this would be worth, but I like the idea that it makes them harder to recognize at a distance, and unpredictable in a chase.
---
All in all, I'm glad I'll get to play legion again without being berated for it, even if I try to play in a fun way. I'm not happy though that I'll now be berated for playing them because of how weak they are, and I hope they see some more love before the end of the PTB, or that the numbers we don't know yet prove to be enough to make them strong after all.
---
I freaking hated to play vs legion.  
---
But all these changes are downright pathetic. Legion simply got deleted. Devs have no boundries on how much to nerf things. In this case, i belive we just got another Freddy tier killer.
---
Except this was supposed to be a rework. Instead we got MS buff and a fuckton of nerfs that make him a Trapper but without traps.
---
Oh okay. I didnt know you could mod the PC one. I'm afraid of the final boss honestly. I was clearing content so easy but now that I've gotten to the final area of the game and those red cloaked guys are like mini bosses in themselves I'm afraid to keep playing lol.
---
What add ons are bannable?
---
My friend who recently got into the game plays legion and I dont want him to accidentally get banned because of the devs. He doesn't browse the subreddit or pay any mind to any other possible dbd community afaik so I don't think he knows.
---
i thought the killers offering was darker on the back
---
At least for me it is
---
Because the game is not balanced around good survivors, haven't you read the thread? 
---
They either have to start balancing around 2k hour survivor mains or they could inconvenience better players to bring them closer to worse players.
---
Good players have no problems with Ruin and bad players shouldn't have to play against Ruin, simple as that.
---
Hmm, it‚Äôs interesting from a legal standpoint. Don‚Äôt they cover this stuff in the Terms of Service?
---
See you in 6 years when they finish deleting his power and rebuilding him from the ground up. Hopefully Freddy‚Äôs rework will be out by then too
---
would i get my money back for buying him is the real question
---
Just run play with your food and become a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù or ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù killer
---
Now we have a killer with no power and I spended my money on it.
---
Well maybe that's why it's not such a nerf. But the mend bar doesn't go down if you're in the terror radius. At least they can't make you go down or mend and get smacked. It was a lose-lose. The bar not going down in the terror radius is very important

---
isn‚Äôt working for me either
---
nah. try to start a game as killer
---
Everytime survivors complain they get their way immediately. How long have killers waited for nerf to DS and a freddy rework? But no less that a few months we have to see BT get a buff and a already weak killer get a buff. Welcome to no one playing you legion.
---
Still tho, 16.56 km/h is pretty fast!
---
Downing people with his power was both slow (unless you were using mixtape) and unfair to the survivor as they couldn't really do anything to defend themselves as you ignored everything they could do.
---
If you wanted to chase regularly you were 110% movement speed so you would get dicked at loops.
---
Now you are like sidegrade wraith, first hit is free, after that you need to m1 them. That's much healthier for the game.
---
Receives like 10 consecutive buffs for killers/nerfs to survivors over the past 8 months straight.
---
They finally issue a nerf for killers to address a single killer that even a good chunk of killer mains don't really like anyways.  RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!
---
You just caught a tiny taste of what has been hitting survivors for a while now and it only affects a single killer a lot of people don't enjoy playing as or against anyways.  The hypocrisy is strong in this sub.
---
it's teasing me now :(
---
He still has his power. If they REMOVED his power completely  then thats different. He just got a nerf, people need to learn to grow up. I bought the legion DLC, i main killer and i sometimes play legion. Guess what, i couldn't give a fuck that hes going to be "useless". I spent ¬£6 to play him, and i got my moneys worth. Thats like playing a steam game for 60 hours and the 100%ing it and saying, this is useless now and then asking for a refund. The people who ask for a refund 100% got their playtime out of it. No refund should EVER be issued for a nerf, it's never happened before in this game and i GUARANTEE it wont happen this time either. People need to buckle up and get a job if they're gonna cry about ¬£6 (essentially ¬£3 because they still have a survivor thats the same)
---
&gt; Didn't the devs said they were no longer going to make big nerfs/changes without testing them before and getting feedback?
---
Isn't...that what the T in PTR stands for? Public **Testing** Realm? Or PTB I guess, for Public **Testing** Build?
---
Wait no, of all the stupid garbage here why did they both fix the moonwalk exploit with the terror radius thing AND remove their ability to see blood during frenzy anyways?
---
Pick one and stick with it god damn.
---
DbD is on the list of safe games with no risk. You're good.
---
Umm you still have to mend. That didn't change. Yes missing a hit will suck if these changes go through as is but it wasn't like the Power had a cooldown before. At best I hit two survivors but only hit one twice, my power drops after a successful hit, hence why it took four Hits without Frank's.
---
Yiu have bled completely out, there is no blood left to lose.
---
And it doesn't even make any in-game sense - you don't bleed if you're close to the killer? I'm trying to think of another mechanic that's as nonsensical.
---
lol 115 no power killer makes it all okay. but this fucking picture is really what legion is about.
---
Thank the lord.
---
He will be nerfed to oblivion. They pretty much Freddied Legion
---
I know the hatch won't spawn on second story of buildings, but does it ever spawn on the top level of the Game?
---
Take the L, filthy legion mains
---
Dont argue with those people man. Survivor mains got what they want.
---
So they won‚Äôt fix the mistake they made. Typical. Not taking responsibility for something they did.
---
it is
---
Yea, unfortunately they are super slow with balance changes when compared to other developers. I just hope The Legion has some strategy to them after the patch... I don't think the developers want another 'Freddy' that they have to revisit and give a complete rework, so hopefully they listen closely come PBE release.
---
Still better than Freddy. A standard killer is better than Freddy and Legion is as close to a standard killer as they come now
---
It matters as you can't spread your power to other people if you miss. Plus if you miss they can then loop you around windows and pallets, as opposed to you getting a free hit on them since you ignore those in feral frenzy and then you either have the option of going after them or spreading it to other people.
---
He takes more skill now as you no longer completely ignore pallets and windows (and no moonwalk exploit!) so you must actually learn how to run loops and get good at chases, instead of ignoring everything and just waiting for your cooldown to come up.
---
New Legion is infinitely healthier to the game.
---
My favourite part is the leg not even attached to the body however it is the spirit so..... Great! Amazing attention to detail and I good sir applaud your efforts. 
---
can we have a image of the clown in like 144p quality licking fingers sucking toes or you know whatever else the clown does these days
---
&gt;If people didnt abuse the exploits so much a lot of these changes wouldnt exist
---
True but nerfing the power to the point where it's just to bad to be used at all and thus not exploitable is not the right answer to that. 
---
Let's just imagine the following:
---
Theres a house and in this house there are things that don't work as intended, lets just say whenever you turn on the light in any room your toilet will flush.
---
There are four ways to deal that:
---
1. Live with it (no one wants that) 
---
2. Replace the broken lightswitch and/or the brolen toilet with replacements that work as indendet (Works fine) 
---
3. Move into another house where everything works as intendet (would mean a completely new power) 
---
4. Just throw out the lightswitch and the toilet but don't replace them. (Well you don't have that problem anymote but you can't use either of your toilet or the lightswitch anymore.) 
---
Well BHVR just used no. 4 for Legions power
---
This game has needed an actual competitive game mode with bans for maps/perks/killers since the start. Bravo Didz!
---
It could have been cleansed before you started working on the totem.
---
You got what you paid for.. You got many hours with the killer. I respect myself by not making myself look like a big fool when i beg and cry for a refund. If you miss your ¬£6 so much buckle up and get a job kid. I GOT what i paid for by having many hours playing the killer. They will NEVER issue ANYONE a refund for this change.
---
I feel like they fixed an exploit by making a stupid mechanic, it should go down in terror radius because it‚Äôs kinda dumb if you chase someone and another guy just follows with deep wound not going down even if you don‚Äôt see them.
---
You remember Mystical Pique? This reminds me of the boss.
---
Now he's a First Hit Killer like Freddy and Wraith... which are considered weak... except he doesnt have the stealth aspect. Also mending takes all of 10 seconds or such which makes it not comparable to actual time wasters like Pig
---
Yeah they added that a while back. For example, if someone's about to get hooked with bbq and chili and you're a distance away, just hop in a locker when they hook and they won't see you. It's not so practical with MoM but it has its uses.
---
So make Nea killer then.
---
Guys, it‚Äôs deep wound in any terror radius, BT is fucking the doctor with his world wide build.
---
Source
---
Finally! Freddy is not the worse anymore.
---
Why would a guy follow you instead of mending?
---
oh man haha good to know, thanks
---
&gt;feral frenzy still lets you vault things.
---
Ok, so, I vaulted the pallet. Now what? I can't down you, I can't punish you in any meaningful way, and if I want to, I'll just get stunned and you'll be able to run away/vault the pallet behind me. It's better to break the pallet than to use his power now
---
They do. They really do. Ghostface is good because he was 2 people
---
The fact that you're being downvoted for wrong think is simultaneously hilarious and depressing.
---
Flashlight saves from the immersed Claudette, the chase is near a gen someone is doing, etc.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3oL7v7PLac
---
Deep wound is useless now so spreading it doesn‚Äôt matter much. The probability that someone misses their attack on the very first target is slim to none. 
---
You can loop legion now. Feral frenzy is borderline useless. 
---
He needed two changes, they‚Äôve killed him. 
---
He definitely isn‚Äôt healthier to the game. When you remove a killer from being played, you take much needed variety away from a side. 
---
I probably won‚Äôt continue this conversation since you think you can ‚Äúproperly‚Äù run a loop.
---
Killers on console get hits all the time without actually hitting the survivor (AS Killer). Idk what you are talking about.
---
having trouble playing the game ): says cannot connect to online services error code 8018 been like this almost all day i played it this morning then it started doing that.
---
Do you not see my flair?
---
I play Legion when I have a daily for him because he's not fun right now. I want him to be fun. I like the concept. But he's just not fun now, and he'll be garbage after the patch.
---
Learn how game balance works
---
I used it once in a ‚Äúslow down the game‚Äù build along with Thanato and Sloppy butcher and then got harassed and called an immigrant. This game is going to die at this rate lmao.
---
You ever see Freddy vs. Jason? Ya know that scene at the end, after the big fight, on the dock? That.
---
No it only spawns on the bottom level for the game.
---
You're calling it useless before even playing it. Before ANYONE has played it, so it's impossible to say how strong they are rn. We haven't even seen the add ons. Look at Trapper or Wraith or Doctor. All of them are hot garbage without add ons.
---
New Legion isn't even that bad on paper, his power still grants you a free hit, you are like a sidegrade to Wraith. He's also much more healthy to the game now.
---
If it was flashlight saves that would benefit the killer as long as you remember to look at walls or etc. for a gen that‚Äôs a pretty good point did not even think of that although to stop that from happening they could easily make it so it goes down no matter what if working on a gen
---
About time!
---
Seriously, this game has been a disaster for me lately
---
knife fight, knife fight, knife fight!
---
BHVR...you people are morons
---
And like I said. Legion had no map control, a terrible end game, oh yeah and it took longer to down a guy even with Frank's Mixtape.
---
Nurse has none of these problems.
---
Yet you cunts cried and cried and cried until you got your way because your parents spoiled you when you stomped your feet in the toy aisle and demanded the toy you wanted.
---
Teenagers in masks def not the coolest lmao
---
1 winter.  
---
Legion was released during the Winter event of 2018-19
---
I know. And you spend more than 10 seconds trying to get to the second guy to apply deep wounds to him. By the time you get the second deep wounds applied, the first one is probably already done. It's pointless
---
Did they officially say it was?
---
I hope the make it go down when interacting with an object, kinda like Plague‚Äôs sickness,  but at the same time it feels almost like the uniqueness is being taken away, y‚Äôknow?
---
I do too sometimes. If theyre being toxic, dont let it throw you off, just ignore it. Also, its not over till its over. If youre not doing well, you usually can make something happen, even later in the game. Think about when to slug, when to chase, when to stay by the hook, etc if its end game.
---
I just found a game, loading in rn
---
If it wasn't for that M1 button there id say you got an early copy of the Switch edition.
---
You can tag multiple people with it, and the frenzy duration is much longer now (I bet you can use some add ons that make you faster too) so you can catch up to multiple people easier.
---
He's also much more healthy to the game now.
---
&gt;You do realize that you‚Äôre not forced to cleanse and give her corrupted right?
---
You do realize that it's still part of her power even if there are ways from preventing it and you just stated that her power doesn't give you the ability to down survivors, when her power does that, right?
---
Like I said your point is still valid. Plague is just not the right example since she has the ability to down people with her power unlike a few other killers like Freddy or Wraith.
---
I'm back in too, lets see if I can finish this match
---
They can. Sony allows it as well. They changed a trophy in destiny 2 last year because it wasn‚Äôt obtainable anymore after one of the updates.
---

---
Okay and you also said you're not an SJW thing is I make my own judgements, women say alot of dumb shit they don't really mean, it's called virtue signalling.
---
Also notice how I'm reading the shit you write and filtering out all the whiny petty insults and ignoring the petty passive agressive cunty downvotes and can still form a normal response to your dumb cunty ass arguments? That's what not being an SJW is, you don't get superoffended about stupid word or attribute value to them to the point where the lack of being insulted is more important than you than the actual thing I'm saying. If that's the case how could you've ever voted Trump, with how many people he insulted how are you gonna vote for him?
---
So no I won't do that I didn't even write these things to "discuss" with some reddit-trash I'm stating these things as facts and the lack of counterarguments from anyone who can tie their own shoes is enough for me to confirm that I'm right.
---
Freddy is still worse than him. 
---
He's honestly not as awful as you are making him out to be, he's like sidegrade Wraith. First hit is free, the other one is not.
---
Yes the changes for legion come next tuesday... in the PTB
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
I dont blame you, no one plays freddy anyways lol
---
Let me know my dood
---
How long do you really think the max is going up by? I bet a second or two at max, combined with larger terror radius so people scatter even sooner, tagging multiple people is only gonna work on idiots or people who have never played against Legion and think hiding in a locker works.
---
Remove the moonwalking exploit. Not sure how you would do it, but definitely not the way they did. Legion was fine other than that.
---
[Legion player missing attacks?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F1fN3KTRa-o)

&gt;fear of pallets and windows in a chase
---
Those are literally the only things survivors can use in a chase. Otherwise they can just run in a straight line. What do you propose would be in any way healthy that would make survivors fear those things, while also not being a torture to play against?
---
So your solution to fix Legion's power is to make it entirely pointless to use?  xD; gg RIP
---
they did nerf ds.. it has tons of counterplay now... and the freddy rework is about to be detailed on and brought to live in the coming months.. not to mention of the other survivor nerfs over the past half year
---
Ya I do get what you mean it does sorta suck but as of right now considering we have not got to try these changes it‚Äôs unfair for us to instantly mad. When the ptb hits ppl should play then give detailed feedback on what they like and don‚Äôt like and etc. if I also remember correctly isn‚Äôt the detected servers going to be on the ptb as well?
---
It's a video game.
---
You know the thing that people play for enjoyment? Let people be
---
I dunno, these notes make it sound like he's more fun to play as/against
---
I wonder, if devs made a killer stronger do they get to lock your character and make you pay more ? Gotta use these people's logic against them
---
I'm so sorry Susie has been causing all this trouble. I guess I'll switch to Joey later on to clean up her mess.

1. Lose time to hit more than one survivor that needs 15 seconds to mend and after that he will also need to heal himself.
---
2. Complains
---
You are too blind to see that they are the same.
---
Except neither Nurse's nor Wraith's first hits demand that extra time be spent mending, which is time they're not doing gens. If that number isn't enough, it can be easily tweaked. It's a much healthier design. 
---
A majority of people here are overreacting quite a bit. Chill, I'm sure it'll be better than expected. More importantly, it'll actually be engaging to play with legitimate counterplay and rewards for outplaying *on both sides,* even if that's in the most fundamental M1-killer way. Now, Legion will be forced to outplay a survivor and win a chase normally, meaning skill and mind games - things that previously were not necessary - are required. 
---
In theory, at least. All of this is theorycraft, which is what more people here should try to keep in mind. In other words, I invite you to have an open mind about it before writing it off as "omegalul mega nerf total trash omfg."
---
Although I'm happy that this piece of unskilled garbage is nerfed, this is kinda overkill?
---
I will reserve judgment until he is tested by players.
---
It's just that Survivors are finding it hard to beat Legion in chases. BHVR is going to fix that.
---
People are EXTREMELY underestimating how much play Legion will have as a regular-speed killer. Being able to actually catch and down survivors who are in Deep Wounds without resorting to Feral Frenzy again is probably the optimal way to play Legion, and now they can actually catch you.
---
He can only do it in his feral frenzy, he needs to stop using it to down you with his M1 attack. 
---
Once he's out of feral frenzy basically a Wraith, he can get pallet looped normally.
---
Except that you healing yourself when I'm on Plague makes me stronger.
---
What does you mending yourself when I'm on Legion do for me?
---
I wasn't implying that?
---
Mate I don't even play Legion. Only time I did was to get Iron Maiden on Doctor in case people actually know how to hide.
---
I never said Legion was unplayable. Just a lot worse now. Can't see blood, reduced speed, can't see bleedout timers, has to wait longer to use Feral Frenzy with having to have the bar completely full, Terror Radius stops the bleedout bar, missing causes the power to deactivate.
---
You're trying to sneak logic into DBD?
---
The loudest voices are always heard and listen to, so the cries and exaggerations were taken into consideration instead of actually see what doesn't work for Legion and what was ok. Besides, they don't really keep in mind how easy it can be to juke Legion in FF as you're almost blind (no scratch marks, blood) and if the survivors run around you, 360 and stuff, your speed in FF doesn't help you find them to land that perfect hit, so most likely you'll miss one. And so you get removed from FF. I understand that on PC this might make sense but it's absurd and too punishing on console.
---
Well, I already played Frank as M1 killer, might just remove the power.
---
I hope not, you're the type of kid that DCs as soon as a killer does something you don't like.
---
I don't think they really have a choice except to rework him.  I'm...  really not sure why they take AGES to make any kind of change, especially with a PTB.  With that kind of a set up you could risk making much faster changes that maybe aren't 100% thought out but, the PTB would quickly reveal the issues and they could take it back to the drawing board.
---
And that is the key of why balancing Legion is hard. I fully agree with you that it can‚Äôt be too bad or else you get another Nurse that ignores all rules in the game. 
---
I think that destroying pallets is enough, considering that after the first hit, Feral Frenzy cannot hurt a survivor. Add the cool down from leaving Frenzy, and the survivor has enough time to escape and run somewhere to another pallet safely. Since the time to recharge is increased and a full recharge is needed prior to using it again, Legion should not be able to spam destroying pallets.
---
It would give Legion some benefit of using Feral Frenzy in a chase to clear a pallet at the risk of a survivor escaping (with the no blood seeing nerfs). This would be like Hillbilly or Leatherface using their power to get rid of pallets. It would help in the end game where Legions‚Äôs power has no use.
---
Is it STILL down? üòü it‚Äôs been like this all day wtg
---
You use lol way too much.
---
Yeah we both insult each other the difference is I can read between the insults and you are too much of an SJW to do it. You'll fit in great on reddit, society is also completely behind you in this, soon many words that I just used will also instantly remove my message like it did for yours, not sure how they'll tackle it IRL but I'm sure it's happening soon at which point you can sit all day everyday in a safespace and it will just be like people are really like that because if they're not we'll just make them be like that *winkyface*.
---
I will fuck off now person that's totally not an SJW but totally acts like one.
---
Been hangin out with Jane too much since she entered the realm
---
You missed the point lol. Why have a power if your character is better without it?
---
Unfortunately.
---
The cash grab shit was lame. I would have loved a killer that switch between masks/people that all have different powers.
---
Hm, I don't know about the movement speed reduction for the frenzy, that would at least give him more map control.
---
Haven't been too bad to be honest depends on rank I think
---
But it just feels like their doing it by getting rid of their power entirely (or might as well be.)
---
The change is a noticable nerf to his power, but his power was unfair to play against and was simply miserable for anyone playing in that game, except to the Legion.
---
There was no counterplay to getting downed in feral frenzy. The version they are proposing is the only alternative that is healthy for the game.
---
I‚Äôm.... Cancelled? As in I‚Äôm going to be killed because I mentioned that you didn‚Äôt unhook your teammate? K
---
Losing time, like Snapping Out of It and RBT. Doctor is weaker than Legion because he needs to increase madness for himself. Legion can just hit and go away
---
I thought punishing Legion for missing an attack in Frenzy was enough but damn they kind of gutted the character. Why even play them now?
---
Well you are one
---
Yes, now the survivors will have fun with 4 escaping every game against a Legion, and instead the Legion player will be miserable every single game.
---
If you remove the stun then you can just catch up to the survivor after you hit them with feral frenzy, cancel the power right behind them and then down them.
---
0 counterplay.
---
it's because i find the people moaning and begging for refunds a very funny topic
---
Once freddy rework comes out he'll probably be the worst killer now
---
Honey, you‚Äôve got a big storm comin‚Äô
---
How so?
---
No it‚Äôs not... they nerfed it waaay too much.
---
I actually liked legion (as a survivor) 
---
They are so different it‚Äôs fun as a change up... the only real changes that were needed, was to his addons and some minor ability changes... not like now

Right back at cha, sjw in denial. Try not to kill yourself on all that edge you have.
---
What about the reeds tho
---
They blacked out his power because it's not useful anymore.
---
Myers has to mend, poor dude
---
weLl iT WAsnT fUnnY arEnT jOkES SupPOseD tO bE fUnNny1?1?-?/!
---
The sign of a scholar, I'm sure.
---
Its good to try something new. Good job devs. I will definitely play new Legion to test his pros and cons.
---
This will probably be a base for his future rework.
---
Game was created around no coms.
---
Game has no coms in game.
---
Therefore, having coms would by definition be game breaking as it's not what the game was designed for (even if they honestly need to implement coms in base and balance around it)
---
Furthermore, I was NOT referring to a bug, but rather the character of Legion, so don't go putting words in my mouth.
---
Well, yeah. You‚Äôre right. 
---
Wraith would be a better example than Plague.
---
But regardless. It‚Äôs still a dumbass thing to say:
---
&gt;It's objectively bad that a survivor cannot be downed with their power. These are both indefensible.
---
People just love to think they‚Äôre amazing at game balance.
---
i wasnt playing back when freddy was new. how did he play before he got nerfed?
---
The point of it is that you can now see where everyone is on the map (and the feral frenzy last longer now, so you can actually get to them most of the time now. Easier to spread his power). Also a lot of survivors will panic and try to hide when they hear chase music, so that is still there.
---
Nobody knows what his add ons will do as of right now (except the devs) so we have to wait.
---
If you miss a swing you go into fatigue AND your power bar needs to be full for some reason too...
---
I want Blizzard to refund me all my money I spent on WoW expansions because they changed my class around with every expansion!!!
---
Oh, no no no, you misunderstand. She's next.
---
.....wow. Legion will be COMPLETE and utter trash now. Nerfed into the ground.
---
Ok. Soo all killers need to be  at least 2 persons to being good right?
---
I actually think that it's not a free hit (I take that as a guaranteed hit) and more like an easy early hit, that can be avoided if you pay attention: Just like with Freddy and Wraith. And I also think that his power will be useless against already injured survivors.
---
However:
---
&gt;No sense trying to argue with you when you resort to using 'fuckface' in an argument
---
This is definitly true, that is just bullshit and does have nothing to do in an argument.
---
I agree with you tho, the nerf really isn‚Äôt that bad. And they gave so many buffs alongside, like 115% movement, longer duration of frenzy etc. 
---
It seems like he‚Äôll still be viable but not as annoying or tunnel-y as before
---
I had a similar situation happen but I was the killer (Pig). Half the team was dead, Meg was on a gen (last gen left) and the Ace was nowhere to be found. I run into Meg and chased her but I got suspicious because I haven't seen Ace so I break the chase and go look for him (plus if I hooked Meg again she would've died so I wasn't desperate for that kill anyway). 
---
Come to find out he was in a locker near the hatch but there was also a hook by it too. I found Meg and made her follow me, grabbed Ace and hooked him then made him watch Meg and I T-bag as he died. 
---
That Meg and I are friends now.
---
They need to have a reason for what they are doing. Myers could have a reason but he was retconned so much who knows what's his true motive
---
The change is it stops by Terror Radius and not by chase as I understand it, so if you're in chase, but their TR is 0 for whatever reason, your timer would start as I understand it
---
yep, that makes a difference! depending on what browser you're using, you'll have to navigate to images.google.com and then go into your browser settings and click "show desktop mode," which will bring up that handy-dandy camera icon for you. alternatively you can long-press on an image and select "search Google for this image," but that doesn't always work properly for me, so ymmv.

Hopefully I can make you smile. While yes missing does suck as it currently reads but it opens up the button add-ons to be reworked better. Like say each tier reduces the penality by 25/50/75 percent. Suddenly missing isnt that bad. Better yet say cancel early and have a ruler add on that refils the Meter quicker. Hey look im 4.6m/s speed base and can yeet when needed. It opens up more possibilities, imo.
---
So don't miss.
---
Whats dwight story? :(
---
i have one golden rule i follow:
---
everyone works on gens unless currently disteacting killer
---
if it becomes a 2v1 and hatch can spawn and you get hooked im not coming to save you and get us both killed, i run into so many games where im expected to risk my skin to save yours if i know where hatch is and we're the only two left, unless you're a SWF member with me or you did something i highly respect you did i wont exempt you from my golden rule of 2 because i used to almost always die when doing saves in 2v1's with hatch and i've always been a fucking 200 iq gamer with my saves, at that point in the game all pallets are used, i likely found hatch, and im an emersion god able to circle thin trees to hide from the killer like 2 meters away, i can do this all fucking day while you mash the struggle button
---
They were weak in terms of getting a 4k against competent players, but in a 1v1 the survivor had no way of counterplay against them, as they ignored pallets and windows AND could also stay away from the survivor for a bit so that they would automatically go int othe dying state as once they were out of the chase they'd bleed out. With strong add ons he became even more bs to play against.
---
These changes aim to make Legion more healthy to the game. Currently Legion is so awful to play against that he has the highest chance of making the survivors disconnect from the match with him, sometimes even multiple survivors.
---
They're basically Wraith with an easier first hit, bigger punishment for missing it, and less map pressure.
---
I think it still stops in a chase since I didn‚Äôt see anything saying it didn‚Äôt, I might be wrong though.
---
Nice thank u for the info
---
Gameplay looks pretty crystal clear to me in this clip ü§î kinda tired of people commenting this same thing in clips that appear to be from really low ping games.
---
While I understand the frustration of the game not being simple, you can't expect a ranked game to be simple if you are evenly ranked with the other team.
---
I messaged them after the match and we uploaded each others perspective to youtube
---
Not really, you're just posting something Legion related when Legion is the hot topic
---
I'm sure you were laughing out loud every single time you were typing it
---
lisa needs braces
---
Well they nerfed an already weak killer, buffed a already buffed perk in borrowed time. So basically the devs showed if survivors complain enough they can get any new killer nerfed.
---
This seems a little harsh, even from someone who hates playing against Legion. A lot of the issues with The Legion, in my experience, comes from the idea that it basically ignores the established game mechanics. Legion more or less couldn't be looped while in Feral Frenzy, but had to chase survivors and stab them a million times to down them. This made chases against and as Legion fairly unfun. This nerf doesn't seem to address that a whole lot, it simply makes Legion worse. Chases in Feral Frenzy will still be boring for everyone involved. At least the base speed got buffed so Legion can chase outside of Feral Frenzy.
---
Yea exactly, and that makes myers more mysterious and interesting, we dont know how he is so strong, we dont know what the hell he is. A really dangerous beast.
---
I got 4 survivors in like 30 seconds
---
Legion is as useful as Freddy now...yayyyyyy
---
Jesus the cyrclejerkers that still think Freddy is legit this bad.
---
You know we can still moonwalk or even look down to break chase. Even with these changes Y'all still have to mend.
---
Probably not cripplingly less -- they can still use Feral Frenzy to run around the map, they just can't blindly swing their stupid dagger the entire time now.
---
I think Freddy got off light.
---
Sarcasm if not on got it üòê
---
Shitpost
---
that free first hit is still worth something.  other loopable killers can get looped for centuries before even getting the first hit, then they proceed to get looped even more.  now Legion's power dramatically reduces the time it takes to get that first hit then becomes a regular m1 killer.  I think we really need to see gameplay before we judge his ability to down 1 survivor.  I have a feeling his increased speed will make that stun feel less impactful, but I wouldn't be surprised if they make a few tweaks to his transition from frenzy to no frenzy.  
---
don't forget the whole point of the changes are to make Legion less frustrating to play against.  never being able to win a chase against a competent Legion was very frustrating.  I'm sure they will make some changes before his live release to put him in a good spot or buff him after collecting data
---
insta heals shouldn‚Äôt be a thing lol
---
He became a pure m1 killer. No reason to frenzy except looking where other survivors are. Complete useless otherwise.
---
It's not shutting down a discussion, people can still reply to Worge105 and discuss things. But a vast majority right now is just "Legion is ded lul" with no further talking.
---
You mean like the 550+ survivor mains who bombarded DBD's steam page with negative reviews when BHVR even talked about touching DS?
---
If you get hit in frenzy, you will help Legion to find other Survivors. See the similarity?
---
And Survivor will get sick anyway after unhooking you so your point doesn't make sense.
---
Let people have fun.... clothes are cute and I would gladly buy merch if it means they will help the team.
---
No I think it was for following people when the got put into deep wound state but intentionaly not engaging chase which would cause the wound timer to go down but the surv not beeing able to stop it
---
I was sweating when Kate‚Äôs timer was getting lower and lower but you guys were getting closer and closer lmao
---
If you do it for a while okay, but if you're the type that always just crouches behind a rock and never grabs a survivor just because the killer is near then just no. If the killer is camping and they're getting to the second stage just rush in and grab them. If they go down again, oh well, they'll go into the second stage which they were were going to go anyways if you just kept hiding.
---
Again, don‚Äôt blame BHVR. Blame the people that were intentionally abusing his exploits. I don‚Äôt feel sorry for Legion at all.
---
I agree with this. His design was terrible for the game and this will sukt for s fix until a rework (if they ever even do one sigh). Now he is just better for getting first hits in snd then doing a normal chase like any other killer
---
I‚Äôm not sure what to do I just give up when they get to a pallet
---
New player as of last week here, bought legion and was really enjoying them without the exploit. Bought cosmetics for them, too. Feeling a bit insulted right now, not going to lie. And it seems like this community knows the pain of this sort of thing from freddy too. This is damn shameful, hopefully feedback proves useful unless all survivors just go "hood man bad"
---
He's getting a rework, you know, that thing they just did to Legion.
---
Don't tunnel and you'll never see it used.
---
&gt; Do you remember when survivors got repeated nerfs 
---
All necessary 
---
&gt; and killers got nothing but buffs
---
all necessary
---
&gt; and survivors cried about wanting refunds? Me either. 
---
because something they paid for wasn't ruined. there's nothing to be refunded for
---
&gt; Do you remember when Decisive got nerfed out of relevancy and killers cheered " ding dong the perk is dead" and told survivors to adapt and get good? I do. 
---
how is this relevant? also totally needed 
---
&gt; And now we have the first killer nerf in like a hot year, and its nerfing a killer that was strictly unhealthy for the game, and killers are crying for refunds and claiming that it's all the survivors fault for ruining thier lives. 
---
they're not sensible changes though.
---
&gt; I feel like I was correct to be biased against killer mains.
---
the Legion changes post is full of people screeching that legion is still broken and that plague needs nerfs, but okay
---
Call me boring, but I like Frank the best. He doesn't need any bells and whistles on his costume, he just needs to stab.
---
Sorry susie is giving you problems:(
---
Wait, what?? That‚Äôs a bug?? I just came back to the game and experienced that last night.  I got killed while mending because some dumb feng min failed a skill check while using self care on herself next to me. THANKS FENG. 
---
I watched the rest of the game until she died. I was satisfied.
---
how about you stop assuming and taking out all your weird fantasy frustrations on me? I never once said i dc from legion or complained endlessly about them. I'm happy they're getting nerfed but i wasn't the one making 100s of posts every day about them. "There are killers everyone hates going against" yeah but not like this. I don't think you understand the sheer amount of instant DCs i've seen from people the second somebody learns its a legion, or the number of videos and threads going in depth into why legion is poorly made and extremely unhealthy and unbalanced. It absolutely will stop dcing once people learn about it because now legion is going to be basically par for the course the worst killer in the game, below freddie and trapper for sure. Now they're like wraith with no stealth and even worse tracking.
---
Freddy and Wraith are weak for other reasons. Freddy is completely dependent on his transition add-ons, and the RNG of skill checks makes him either completely useless or completely bonkers. No other killer in the game can have someone follow them to a hook and be completely powerless against the follower. You hook them, instantly lose your hook, and now you have 2 people that aren't in dream state. 
---
Wraith as a killer would be fine if tiles weren't as strong as they are. Perhaps even changing the range at which the bell can be heard, either by shrinking it further to maintain the stealthy jump-scare aspect, or making something like Bone Clapper standard - help keep people on their toes, re-inject the fear aspect into the game.
---
Legion needed to get toned down. Spamming feral frenzy just to catch up took away counterplay or skill in chases, and the bleed out timer seriously needed to be changed to what it is.
---
Please tell me what small tweaks do you think would fix Legion.
---
That trailer was so odd. It's literally nothing like how Legion plays, and even the chapter title suggests a survivor-as-killer mechanic - makes me think that they couldn't get it to work and threw together Feral Frenzy at the last minute.
---
Oh no I don't wait out entirely. If I can tell it's a camper or a tight looper I'll choose my moment and just take the hit. I'm talking specifically about the kind who can see your aura there and the killer has just turned their back on them and they are trying to get themselves off the hook. Just like give me 10 seconds at least!
---
I don't wait until people get into struggle if I can help it, at least that way they have another hook stage left.
---
The other changes to the other add ons might be good too. They said they were rebalancing them too.
---
Thing is I agree that feral should be used to stall the game and not aid in the chase but I wish they added a mechanic where your terror radius increases with each successive stab to make it easier to locate survivors in frenzy. I feel like the changes they did could make legion work better in that aspect
---
So, they made a killer who's power is worse than freddy's. Call me sally and mend me backwards I didn't think they could ever do something like this. All legion needed was counter play. Not an emptiness in my heart while I play him. Do you wanna see cold dirt be that useful or are you gonna make that a useless add on too? I swear these devs knew freddy was getting reworked so they needed a new freddy tier killer and was like "mmmm who should we make bad?" Done with my mini rant, just don't even wanna type anymore.
---
holy fuck you had to make a whole post about this lmfao you got hurt feelings eh
---
&gt; and get a job kid
---
...I'm an accounting administrator
---
these people are actually fucking deranged it's insane
---
How are you dying on the hatch if the killer is face camping? Maybe you‚Äôre just trying to justify being a shitty team mate?
---
Was crappy, I had only this afternoon off to play this week and couldn't.  Now I'm heading out with my wife to the pub so I won't get to play tonight .I hear it's back up now though?
---
he is unloopable by a healthy survivor when he is in frenzy.  he is not as fast as he was before, so now you have a decent chance to escape him if you have some distance and a way to lose line of sight.  a good survivor won't take the hit if they can avoid it.  it's in your best interest to not take that frenzy hit so you don't need to waste time later mending and healing.
---
He was insanely awful to play against, these changes were needed to make them bearable.
---
Definitely an opinion, feel free to disagree.
---
This is a good point.
---
4.6 m/s is overrated. Of the 4 best killers in the game, only one has 4.6 m/s. Ask old Wraith (not a Wraith main, maybe he still sucks), Trapper, or Freddy how the 115% MS is working out for them. Meanwhile Nurse, Spirit, and Hag are all top tier and truly viable with 110%.   
---
Billy is the only top tier killer with "Standard" speed. It does not help much, if at all. Even if some people still want to argue that Huntress is top tier still (I don't think she is personally), again she's 110%. Slow killers usually have powerful abilities to offset it and BHVR had been good about that until Legion came along.
---
I agree, but this doesn't make Legion unplayable.
---
If this is what is happening to Legion, I'll never be able to have my decent Freddy. Good to know this game is going the way of Deathgarden: an ATM disguised as a disappointing game
---
Before the nerf, people who liked Legion didn't complain, people who hated Legion complained.
---
Now, people who liked Legion complain and people who hated him love it. 
---
Different sets of people complaining about different things.
---
Ty!!
---
This nerf didnt help! It made is power usless he is just another M1 killer you made him the trapper with no traps! Im done arguing. Have fun bullying legion now.
---
Does this mean we'll finally get unmasked legion cosmetics since they're now pretty much useless and might as well just do gens?
---
I agree that old Legion was a problem. I'm not going to fight that. But think about the other killers that get a "free first hit".
---
Spirit: has invis mindgames
---
Wraith: has invis mindgames
---
Nurse: has blinks
---
Freddy(kinda but not really): is invis until first hit
---
Only one of these killers has a normal TR that alerts survivors to their presence. And even then, most of these killers aren't all that great. Nurse is the best killer in the game and Spirit is just kind of meh.
---
But they did change DS. I agree with you though.
---
Keep telling yourself I'm somehow the personal be all end all reason your favorite broken killer got fixed.
---
damn i fucked up
---
I know man. Its crazy i dont even want the freddy rework now just leave him alone.
---
That's certainly part of it.
---
Theres a reason most people don't heal against a Legion. It makes his power completely worthless. There's no point to heal. Just mend your deep wounds, and go back to that gen you were on
---
Not in terror radius though. The moonwalk thing can go, the fat fact that his power doesn't even down is what has me all turned around.
---
No, you've spent the money fully knowing that they might/will change things once they are out if need be.
---
It's the same thing with other aspects of the game. Some people bought characters for perks. Example: Laurie. DS got major changes and most people would say it got nerfed. Yet nobody recived a refund, and why would they? It is obvious that things may get changed, nerfed, buffed, reworked. That's how games work.
---
You can still play Legion after the changes and use his perks and Jeff's perks. You still have access to this stuff, nothing to warrant a refund.
---
Ok so what the hell have to do The plot from the movie to a character?? Most of f13 movies are bad but Jason is fucking great as killer, and one last question? Do u know what slasher means?
---
Legion more like wheremypowergone
---
It said 'Regular' Frenzy attacks won't deplete the gauge. My guess is add-ons (Frank's) will still let you Frenzy them down.
---
'least, as long as I read it right. I kind of skimmed it.
---
Not really "spying" if it's their game and their data. 
---
Good on them if what you say is true.
---
He isnt favorite killer freddy is! Im afraid the devs will just go with survivor mob rule and nerf more killers.
---
Then why ask...
---
Well, maybe wait until the PTB before assuming that's what's gonna happen
---
Oh my gosh! XD  
---
If they'd only had a killer attacker her during the "me so horny" part, I'd have died.
---
Is it destroyed? Were people really just spamming it to four shot a survivor, three with Frank's?
---
I've been playing since release and have 1600 hours played, mostly as survivor. I have played at all ranks and whether it's high or low, I rarely see killer DC (although I do see the occasional noob ragequit after they can't find someone for the first few minutes). I see survivor DCs far more often, to say the least.
---
Wait, you're really arguing that the fact that legion is just a worse version of the Plague is ok? Is that what you're saying?
---
Yeah, let me just fast vault this window *and* there's the cooldown. 
---
Look at all this time I've saved.
---
It's not like you're missing out, every killer has tunnelled today -.-
---
It's kinda like finding out there's a tunnel in your basement that leads to the next-door bank's vault. You're didn't dig the tunnel, but that doesn't mean you should be allowed to regularly visit the bank vault. At the same time, you shouldn't be punished for following the tunnel unknowingly and ending up on bank property. But if you sneak down there weekly to steal money, you should be punished, but frankly, the bank just needs to fill in the tunnel regardless. Is this a fitting metaphor? I have no idea but I'm really proud of it please don't shatter my reality.
---
More perks will work on Legion now.
---
Enduring, spirit fury, brutal strength, save the best for last, any exposed perk status (which is a lot), healing related perks since now people will have a reason to heal against you, any terror radius related perk since now your terror radius is larger. Tons of them.
---
Except it already doesn't waste time.   
---
You won't be getting multi-hits. No survivor is going to sit in your TR when they see someone else tagged with DW. You will get one hit. It will waste their time if you let them go. There's no mention of a longer interaction, which means it's not going to waste much time.
---
Survivors are still going to put off healing to do gens instead (see: Plague) as 115% MS killers are NOT as scary as people seem to think. Consider that 3/4 top tier killers are NOT 115% MS and are top tier due to good ABILITIES.
---
If MS mattered so much Wraith and Pig and Trapper and Doc would all be stronger than Hag, Spirit, etc.  
---
Of course Mobility matters but 115% MS is not "mobility".
---
Ahh, sorry. Misunderstood what you meant by your comment. I thought you were implying Plague's power was pointless.
---
But also I disagree with the assessment that her power is a *nerfed* hodgepodge. I feel like it's really good if you use it correctly. Theres so many different ways to use her power and I love that
---
I said *not* just minor tweaks, so I don't know why you're asking me that.
---
Uh, Legion's power never downed survivors, lol. It just lowered the mending bar. Yeah, the missed attack depletes the power bar is new.
---
Guess what cocksucker? They DC anyway. They DC if I use Legion with Frank's Mixtape, they DC if I find them first with Billy, they DC if I dare to bring a mori into the game, I get flamed and get spammed rage invites (BTW this is the only game I've ever fucking played where I've gotten rage invites). And I used to play TF 2 and the TF 2 is 10 million times better than this flaming garbage pile of entitled autistic cunts that cry about literally everything. Please off your self. Go suck a shotgun barrel you waste of flesh and bone.
---
It doesn't empty the meter on a missed attack. It ends Feral Frenzy. :)
---
Found the rank 20.
---
Please nerf survivors...
---
1.5 years ago. Damn those devs and their subliminal messages making us keep playing!
---
No, they haven‚Äôt- if I were to hazard a guess, I think we might get one in Anniversary in June, however.
---
The same would be with an increased TR per stab. Yeah, well that depends on how you feel about Feral Frenzy as an idea. I've never been a fan to be honest, but I can see where they're coming from.
---
I agree.
---
I hope you‚Äôre right tbh.
---
Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Facebook groups, in game by word of mouth, Steam community, PlayStation community, this exploit is literally EVERYWHERE. Highly doubt anyone that used the double blades were unaware that it was an exploit. People that played Legion and used those add ons knew exactly what they were doing.
---
I loved Sam raimi spiderman, better than Tom and Andrew
---
Yh but just bc she may have assaulted him doesn‚Äôt mean that he didn‚Äôt assault her, it may have been a two way thing, we don‚Äôt know, only them two and people who were present know
---
I mean Freddy can‚Äôt get any worse. But people were complaining so much about legion exploits/ counterplay that devs had to nerf him. The opposite is true of Freddy where they only complain about his weaknesses
---
damn just as I was about to source it
---
HOLY SHIT. HER FUCKING LEGS, I FEEL LIKE IM BEING ATTACKED. (I got bad knees)
---
It will certainly give players pause when considering purchasing future killers. Killer looking strong on the PTB? Better wait atleast 6 months to see if the devs are going to obliterate the killer, just in case.
---
This happened to me with a Claudette who sat on hatch
---
I bet it feels nice living in an echo chamber where everything you say is right and a bunch of phaggots agree with all of your garbage opinions? And you tell me to pull my head out of my ass when Behavior bent over backwards again for the umpteenth time for you entitled cunts? KYS. Please, for the love of god and all this is holy, just fucking KYS. Not joking. Just fucking KYS.
---
It has 2 pallets and possibly 3 windows + 1 or 2 vaults and multiple dropdowns on the top floor.
---
Plus it has 2 or 3 pallets on the bottom floor and possibly one or 2 more windows.
---
Disturbed Ward is probably the only one that is worse.
---
I really can't think of another building as bad as the Grim pantry one.
---
Thank you for clarifying!
---
My thoughts as I read the rework. Fuck Legion
---
And the Legion changes are necessary too. Weird how that works.
---
nea, it's the first five characters
---
Unless you use double cool down, that will never work against good survivors. 110% is not very good at catching people at all without some kind of power.
---
Myers house has 2 or 3 windows and that's it.
---
Haddonfield in general is broken but Myers house isn't nearly comparable to the Grim Pantry main building.
---
$20 says they won't even change how that achievement works on the day the update goes live.
---
No, its common sense knowing that a killer can be changed at ANY moment. Like with any game or DLC, nerfs can come in at any second and change how something plays. It's legit just common sense
---
I am of the belief that if you suddenly start playing exclusively Legion, and every game you only use the blade add-ons, making it clear that you're abusing the glitch, you should be banned. This is to say nothing about how hilariously inept BHVR's lack of action has been. 
---
But, just to play devil's advocate, couldn't you argue "sandbagging and bodyblocking shouldn't be bannable. You're simply holding still, not hacking or glitching. BHVR could just make other players not be physical entities to eachother if they really didn't want it to happen."? The point being that game mechanics made by the developers shouldn't always be immune to ban just for existing in-game.
---
This is what I was waiting for
---
Theyre literally going to be better after these changes, yall are so dumb.
---
Now get that thing out of here.
---
it‚Äôs working!
---
I wasn‚Äôt truly around DBD when Freddy got nerfed so I don‚Äôt truly have an opinion :/ I think he is fun and awesome hopefully this rework makes him balanced and doesn‚Äôt overtune him the same way they overnerfed Legion &gt;.&lt;
---
Y'all seriously need to chill. Even if he ends up being bad (which I doubt) it is infinitely healthier for the game that they get changes to combat their exploits and just overall terrible design.
---
That has nothing to do with dead by daylight. Take your nonsense elsewhere
---
Honestly, lol
---
I‚Äôm glad I never got him in the first place. Dodged the biggest bullet there.
---
Play Nurse, play her all day, get good with her, and you'll have fun again. Do it while you can.
---
This person stole my brand
---
It would be the same but it would only be active during the frenzy duration while you have the speed buff to encourage breaking away to attack the other survivors. Yeah I agree I see what they had in mind but I‚Äôve always liked powers that are flexible
---
Actually not half-bad changes. Good Legions become even better, bad Legions get shafted into Oblivion. My only complaint is that having a full power recharge per Feral Frenzy use is quite brutal, but I guess they just gave the Pins and the Rulers a reason to exist.
---
Someone has to be meme tier- if Freddy‚Äôs rework makes him good, it appears Freddy has a ‚Äòsuccessor‚Äô.
---
No one likes him, he's terrible at everything he tried to do in life, and his co-workers got him drunk and abandoned him in the woods, where the Entity found him
---
The fact that this post has been downvoted shows how fucking stupid this sub is when it comes to MoM.
---
JuSt PlAy HiLlBiLly Or HuNTrEsS. What a fucking joke.
---
I didn't DC after a while, scared to get banned since I already got banned a few times for telling degenerate legionmains and campers pretty much what you told me to do in your last sentence. 
---
I wouldve send you rageinvites as well, I wouldve done everything in my power to make your life as miserable as youre constantly doing to others with your moronkiller made for braindead 9 year olds. 
---
Go back to TF2 spam those minisentries, beware though they actually have a counter so you might not like it as much but it's still braindead so who knows.
---
He gets 115 movement speed but his power was nerfed to death
---
I NEED a picture of that girl! Especially in these sad times for us Legion lovers *hugs* OUR BELOVED SUSIE IS GONNA BE BELOW FREDDY SHE DESERVES BETTER *weeps uncontrollably*
---
Exquisite!

The killers are ordered by release date, not encounter rate.

---
I've said it elsewhere but I think it's worth repeating: 115% MS is overrated. 3/4 top tier killers don't have 115% MS (and if Billy were made today, he'd probably have 110% tbh).
---
Some "infamous", weak killers like Freddy, Wraith, and even Trapper all have 115% MS. Looping has always worked on any killer who has to W + M1 to down you. Deep wounds will not waste anyone's time, it already doesn't and it's not being changed to waste more in compensation. Gens will be done fast while you get looped, etc. He'll be in the same boat as Freddy, maybe a tad better since he's not forced to wait before he attacks.   
---
So yeah, you won't have to resort to Frenzy, instead you'll have to resort to brute force perk builds (Spirit Fury/Brutal Strength + Enduring) to eat pallets or getting looped around windows trying to build bloodlust because you can't even chase with frenzy for 4 hits or w/e anymore.
---
Evenly ranked should mean evenly matched but unfortunately that‚Äôs not the case in this game. 
---
High rank survivors are more advantaged than (most) killers although it‚Äôs also true that low ranks favour killers simply due to bad survivor coordination.
---
lmao they just gutted him. But to be totally honest, i'm not complaining. I'd rather have this shit tier legion than the way he is now.
---
 The Elm Street and Halloween spotlights have some fantastic shots- Michael‚Äôs silhouette appearing in the doorway, Freddy in the boiler room/Freddy walking into the mist carrying Quentin- it‚Äôs great stuff.
---
üëå
---
&gt;But also I disagree with the assessment that her power is a nerfed hodgepodge. I feel like it's really good if you use it correctly. Theres so many different ways to use her power and I love that
---
Different strokes for different folks I supposed. I actually do fine with her even in red ranks, I see her as a _jack of all trades, master of none_ kind of character can handle a lot of situations. Nothing wrong being a character like that.
---
It's just that I've always personally enjoy playing with more *specialized skill-set/archetype* characters in my games.
---
Basic gist of it:
---
- The transitioned into dream world in 4 seconds instead of...  However long it is now, 7 or 10 seconds or something?
---
- He used to see your aura the moment you left his terror radius, now there is a 10 second window before the aura shows up.
---
- Downed survivors had to be woken up first then healed, where as now you just heal them up
---
- Smaller lullaby radius and terror radius
---
- Adrenaline didn't wake up survivors if I remember, don't quote me there though
---
- There was no slow down when putting people asleep, although I believe that was initially a bug more so then anything else but it did help nerf him.  Also was no delay to sleeping someone else
---
Hmmm, I think that's about it?  Could be more but I'm not finding exact notes at a quick glance anyways.
---
I actually had a similar circumstance. This Kate was trying her darnedest to get the last gen done. Eventually i put two and two tigether and spoke nodanese at kate. She took me to where the last person was hiding, in the basement of Temple. I pretended to be chasing the kate, got t3 michael, did a quick 180 and downed the p3 jake that was hiding. He instantly dc'd.
---
I believe he's referring to the semantics of the situation, and what it could imply.
---
This Havana? If so, which part? I don‚Äôt recognise it.

My nonsense and I are one and the same, and I'm not going anywhere :P
---
I dont like nurse, I wanna play a killer where I have to chase because chasing is fun, but losing an entire game because 1 perk bcuz they got hit 3 times cuz they played awfully is so fucking infuriating, like how the hell am I supposed to improve at playing the game when theres literal perks that can completely negate any kind of pressure I apply, like these survivors were hot garbage, they got gens done quickly but I was able to end chases with my m1 as 110% killer, like brUh the one with mettle of man didnt even look behind her while she was running like she was so garbage, but I lose bcuz that perks exists
---
You only do for the first frames of the animation. Good Legions know they can block you if they vault a window then press S+Direction in which the survivor is at while ending Frenzy.
---
That
---
s what they should've done, but instead they just put them in F(reddy) Tier where they'll probably remain for the next year+ until bhvr finally gets around to applying an actual rework.
---
[I'm contributing :)](https://youtu.be/ko0J8Ft_bxg)
---
Legion main?
---
 staying near the wall shouldn‚Äôt be a problem if Freddy wasn‚Äôt mr.fantastic
---
You sure cry like one
---
The point of Legion is not to waste time but to constantly track survivors and start chases, the time wasting is just a sub-effect to justify Feral Frenzy stabbing.
---
If a survivor sees another in DW that means you've hit the survivor with FF, which means you've already seen where the others are.
---
The no healing thing is hilarious, you hear it always and see it on guides and tips but in real gameplay nobody does that, everybody heals. The same with the Plague, someone is going to cleanse eventually (sooner than later) and then nobody gives a fuck because she already has the Corrupted thing and everybody starys cleansing.
---
And now more than ever, if a Legion sees you're injured he now can just walk up to you with his 115% MS and down you.
---
Well, what you are saying is that Legions ability is not good, which I agree on. But given his ability is staying, standard MS will make a big difference because people wont need to spam FF to actually chase.
---
He doesn't need to be OP, he just needs to be viable, and he is, by far.

I didnt. Meme just sucked monkey shit.
---
If I'm not mistaken thats actually a Legion add on. When you it a survivor in FF your TR covers the whole map for the duration of FF. Or something like that.
---
Yes, I agree with the powers.
---
The only real underwhelming part of his power is the fact that Survivors can wake up directly in your face due to random chance, and having Add-ons that affect Skillchecks is the dumbest thing. 
---
Otherwise he‚Äôs pretty decent for a Killer.
---
Ah there are 4% ers that I missed. Ok thanks! Still worth discussing that none of those 4 are higher. Kind of surprising.
---
I'll tell you what's going on. The game still sucks. If I were you, I'd keep on not playing the game.
---
No one but me :(
---
God Dangit I was beaten to it aswell! By 2 hours Jesus why does high school get out so late
---
I completely disagree with the nerfs. I don't even have legion but I agree the moonwalking shit was stupid and needed to go. (But I would have had a medium radius that's not terror radius that freeze deep wound, and kept being able to see blood. I thought the whole point was you can't see scratches in frenzy so sloppy butcher or bloodhound would help you track if they got away. Another solution would be reworking how chase algorithm works where even if you don't have LOS, as long as you're still closing the gap the game still counts you as in a chase. This could help prevent situations where you're still clearly chasing someone, but the game decides they got away and you lose bloodlust, + would fix moonwalking Legion.)
---
Clarifying that I‚Äôm referring to people who self sacrifice after the first hook which screws over the other people who have one less person helping.
---
Legion got Freddy'd, hard.
---
So it's kinda like Spirit now? Sorta?
---
Can I get my money back?
---
Just doing the generator is best actually since 30 seconds of zero gen progress gives the killer a decent bit of time to work, and that‚Äôs only if you are able to find it in 30 seconds. Maps like the Game it might take way longer
---
Honestly this doesn't fix any of Legion's core issues. All this does is fix the exploits and make him a shittier Wraith.
---
~~This doesn't fix the issue of playing Legion like Nurse for stupid people. Legion still has the problem that (in theory) you literally don't have to break any pallets or do any vaults since you can just brain fart over them with your power.~~
---
&gt;*The Deep Wound timer progress is no longer reduced by regular Feral Frenzy attacks.*
---
&gt;I missed this part. Yeah Legion is objectively a worse Wraith now. I think we did a pretty good Freddy so far.
---
Cool-down addons ~~and Frank's Mix Tape~~ suddenly go from "strong" to "literally mandatory." Also Stab Wound Study is fucking worthless now but...
---
Literally get rid of all these changes except the Deep Wounds timer change (remove the Moonwalk exploit), the Iridescent Button change, and the general Terror Radius increase. Maybe kept the not being able to see blood thing, and the Killer not being able to see Deep Wound progress. I don't think missing an attack should make you instantly stop FF but if it reduced the duration a bit or had a longer cooldown on miss it would be fine.
---
Legion does not need to be 115%. We don't need another default Killer "but their power lets you get a hit." This rework is shaping Legion into some bastard child of Wraith (faster movement) and Plague (get a survivor injured for free) with a great uncle Freddy to remind them how much big brother Behavior isn't looking around for the little guy.
---
I'd prefer for Legion to be a Nurse for potatoes than for Legion to be a worse version of Plague. I'd settle for the 4 hits in Feral Frenzy over being a worse default Killer, thank you.
---
Legion needs to have a reason to break pallets, but that reason shouldn't be that they're literally just Plague. Please don't go through this change.
---
its basically the same as a second story building. Execpt the building is the whole map
---
.......... da fuk is all of this?
---
Interesting points, we will have to agree to disagree but it's interesting none the less to see your thoughts. 
---
I will say this: I am not married to what Legion is currently. The only "fun" thing about Frenzy imo was the multi-hit capability and the parkour feel. Everything else about it could be dumped. I'd rather have seen some kind of debuff/buff token mechanic where Frenzy doesn't injure but instead gives tokens that improve the Legion and they could get consumed when attacking or whatnot (kind of how Save the Best for Last works).
---
Instead there's an across the board nerf and the very small buff of 115% MS which at best gives another mid tier, W + M1 chase killer and at worse gives another trash tier killer where everything is stacked against you all game. /shrug
---
Again, not a Legion main but I'm just a bit disappointed. Was hoping for something more from BHVR. After how creative they've been with Spirit or the Plague, I had some hope they'd truly make Legion into something interesting.
---
Borrowed Time got a heavy nerf after legion came out. But now it's definitely a buff.
---
&gt; as well as having great mobility due to the increased duration of feral frenzy.
---
Let's not forget the "significantly reduced" speed you move at while in it. And while we don't have exact numbers for either aspect yet, do you really think they're going to give feral frenzy any bonus beyond like 3 seconds at most?
---
If you even considered playing legion seriously for longer than 4 secs you kinda deserve to have all your shards burned right in front of you. Legion to me was a test to see if killers could be disciplined enough to not go for the most braindead easymode killers out there, you failed the test and even though I'd like a wall of legionmains where your names and adresses are all posted so I  can make sure that I can cut anyone from my life who plays that degnerate character but BHVR are canadians so they always go for the nicer option so I guess a few lost shards will do enough for them.
---
It's... definitely not overrated on a killer whose main problem was getting a second hit? Nowhere did I claim Legion could even sniff the top tier?  
---
&gt;He'll be in the same boat as Freddy, maybe a tad better since he's not forced to wait before he attacks.
---
So... better than Freddy, the worst killer in the game... which is where most people currently rank him? But minus constant Feral Frenzy and Button Simulator (Mending)?  
---
Count me in.
---
They already do. They sound almost exactly like the barrels that are on fire.
---
&gt; Lit totems should produce a bit of ambient noise, like a quiet crackling sound.
---
they do.
---
Hex totems have literally been the easiest thing to find for a while they dont need nerfed after getting some form of stealth to their placements

---
Oh God the nerf hurts oh God
---
And this is faster than just hitting the survivor?
---
Ah yeah. Now that you spell it out for me like that I can see the difference
---
That already happens anyway if you have competent survivors
---
Sounds brilliant whack out  ms paint for that one
---
Shush, don‚Äôt tell BVHR I‚Äôm leaking!
---
That's not abuse, that's literally using items you pay for with in game currency..
---
Well back to playing lobby simulator
---
Yeah I was thinking ‚Äúthis is a survivor shroud...‚Äù
---
In what way? To me it looks like they solved every problem they had. Moonwalk is gone and his spamming is gone, and they increased his speed, so what problems with legion were not addressed?
---
i hope this nerf makes legion completely unplayable. that‚Äôs just my opinion, people only play legion to piss people off or farm BP.
---
Oh no my game crashed during loading. I hate it when task manager opens itself and selects Dead By Daylight and clicks end task all by itself.
---
&gt;they were far from powerful
---
Frank's mixtape was literally hit twice, wait 10 seconds and down the person. All requiring little to no skill since there were no mindgames involved and pallets or vaults were useless.
---
If that wasn't powerful I don't know what is.
---
Oh fuck he might as well be a paper bag now then xD
---
:'(
---
No problem on agreeing to disagreeing, always enjoy a discussion.
---
I totally agree with you about the FF stab effects, I really hate the Deep Wounds mechanic outside of Borrowed Time, and you're idea sounds interesting.
---
They also increased the duration of FF, and since we still don't know the numbers we don't know how much effect its going to have on his gameplay.  Same with add ons.
---
You have to remember that they never said they were going to rework Legion, they said they were going to make changes to Feral Frenzy, so the increased MS was a bonus. The problem lies with the Feral Frenzy core idea, and that would mean a full rework. At least thats how I see it.
---
You seem to be struggling. They wanted Legion to be reworked, not nerfed. If played as intended, he was fine. This isn't a rework, they just nerfed his terror radius, increased his movespeed, and then deleted his ability. 
---
Gotta love when Survivors site getting rid of instablinds as the developers being "biased." Survivor is still far better than Killer, quit your Whining. I'm glad you're celebrating another Killer thrown down the tosser along with Wraith, Freddy, and half the other case. But that's fine, I can play 5 blink Nurse *all* day.
---
They already do. This post is a joke.
---
If you can't fix a killer, just nerf it. - BHVR
---
How come the bad guy appears for a second at :08? (I've never played)
---
They will be an objectively worse Plague in every sense of the word. Both Plague and Legion have powers that are meant to injure Survivors and slow the game down. The difference is that Survivors have to go somewhere specific to "mend" against Plague, still have to "mend" after being downed, Plague's "deep wounds" can spread to other Survivors, and Plague will get a ranged attack while Legion will not.

No, they never changed that achievement. It's 20 on PC and always has been, and it is 100 on Xbox as it is in PS4. Overwatch has had its achievements changed.

---
Thank you for calling out everyone in this thread on their fuckin bullshit.
---
So does she, now.. Ouch..
---
We would make sure it wouldn't be a mess in action.
---
Except they made it so if you hit someone they DO ignore your physical entity, because they realized they fucked up.
---
You didn‚Äôt see the video of her saying she‚Äôs gonna tell the cops he hit her??
---
My impression? Seems like legion, an already low tier killer, has been nerfed to hell rather than reworked so people will quit complaining. 
---
the inability to see blood pools in frenzy was completely unnecessary, especially since they dealt with the moonwalking problem 
---
I‚Äôll need to test them once the update is out, but early impressions are *very* unfavourable, which is disappointing because the concept behind legion is cool but I‚Äôm predicting following this update they are going to be sent to the bottom of the tier list then left untouched. 
---
Have at thee legion hate bandwagon
---
The point isn't that you claimed he could be. MY point was that 115% vs 110% means little to nothing. It's barely a buff. It is definitely overrated. See if Hag players would give up her buffs that made her godly in exchange for 115% MS. They wouldn't. This is the "easy way out" for BHVR. 
---
Honestly, the TR change is probably going to be more influential overall. 
---
And sure, I agree with you he's both bad and bad for game health. 100% agreed with you there. If this were a temporary "fix" to at least alleviate the toxic effect on game health, this would be fine. It's not though, or at least they are not billing it as such. It's being said to "Fix" them.   
---
Except it's only fixing it for survivors. Legion is already not fun to play as intended, nothing was done to address that at all. And that makes this a bad update imo. 
---
I feel I should add a disclaimer: Not a Legion main by an stretch and I'm by no means attached to how Legion currently is. I just feel it's worth providing feedback that this change is a pretty lame direction. The Spirit and the Plague show that BHVR is not out of ideas, they should be reworking killers like Legion and Freddy instead of just "tweaking numbers" on a flawed design.
---
Also if you disagree but you have no arguments to explain why you disagree because you're fucking stupid there's a handy downvote button to the left.
---
I am honestly so upset, they nerfed him to oblivion, they didn't fix anything you still can't play the killer without the UNCHANGED frank mix tape. 
---
My God bhvr give a shit about your game.
---
Imagine defending live Legion like he's totally fine and balanced.
---
stop spreading your lies about daddy trapper you fiend
---
Now if I play hag I'm going to put traps there and see their reaction in the end chat lol
---
Well I fucking jumped.
---
Keep in mind that the other guy probably suggested Dead Hard due to it being a short sprint boost on button press, and not for the invincibility frames. However I believe Sprint Burst is a better perk at leaving a gen to get to a safe zone quickly
---
Agreed.
---
I'll miss him you fucking bastard. How dare you say something so insensitive, you're an asshole.
---
So if I‚Äôve been playing legion for the past 2 weeks and do it just once today will I get banned ?
---
Yeah, pretty much agree. I'd honestly be more than satisfied if they removed the Deep Wounds effect from his ability. But from what I've heard from the devs they have no interest in going any further with Legion, but who knows. We can only hope.
---
Can we tag this with Shitpost like you‚Äôre supposed to? Don‚Äôt put this as gameplay.

Myers house is worse. You can loop the killer for a really long time if you have balanced landing and 2 windows are open on the house.
---
It‚Äôs in the warehouse of Havana.
---
I thought since you added it in another paragraph that they weren't powerful in general.
---
Wish it was that easy. Games like these are near impossible to fully balance, as people strategies change quickly
---
Wish I could of seen that post game chat
---
I‚Äôm on console dude
---
Mettle of Man is certainly not why you‚Äôre losing.
---
Ah, I see. 
---
Speaking of which, thoughts on new Archives gamemode?
---
Meanwhile, I get 5 Trapper games in a row against different Trappers.
---
Hmm.. I see how that may have been confusing, apologies!
---
They may as well just have deleted their power.
---
Why didnt they just make missed swings take a chunk of his ability timer away?  That way he's still more flexible than your typical w+m1 killer, but is still limited in some degree.
---
Plus it would be a survivor perk as the video would suggest. Gonna make a weak post as least watch the video
---
I don't know if I'd say lazy. From what I gather, most of them are just not that good at the game. It's hard to design a viable killer when their own playtest team probably struggles against low tier killers.
---
139 days later and Legion is officially worse than freddy üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇlololololol
---
I figure that legion is going to be along the wraith in the tier list
---
Me too. Bought the goddamn cosmetics too that I no longer care about. And were already a rip-off as is that I have to buy 2/4 characters in the goddamn legion. This is really shitty. The character sucked when released, and it really seems like they are just trying to make them unplayable because they fucked up.
---
Then they've gotta go heal or they're easier to find and are 1 hit from death, going for the uninjured person slows the game down more than going for the unhooked person
---
Walking around the edge of the map
---
I don't think BHVR knows what a rework is. It's like Valve not understanding the number 3.
---
Kate‚Äôs got an evening dress out soon. Jane‚Äôs just been released, but she‚Äôll get stuff soon- my guess is we‚Äôll get another large cosmetic drop at Anniversary, and I‚Äôm willing to bet Jane will have some stuff there.
---
A man of culture.
---
Slower than survivors fast vault, but not so slow that its like a slow survivor vault. Like just make the animation 3/4ths of a second longer.
---
New legion meme face
---
I heard the new killer was hinted to be Ghostface from scream
---
Prolly cuz i got my moneys worth and couldn't care less because the dlc cost ¬£6
---
1) Ima dude  
---
2) its a game and games can be frustrating when you lose due to thing you cant control  
---
3) how about you take your "witty" responses and not respond to things, your only doing it for a response so stop, lmao
---
Guess the Huntress could have used Hatchets, but if you're playing the half of the cast that can't bypass it, there's almost no counter play. Maybe she could have tunneled.
---
Even with headphones i can barely hear them unlike fire barrels
---
Legit me I want a blood point refund
---
First off calm down. Secondly you didn't buy the game specifically to use a bnp. I'm not even saying they can't change it because I paid for it. I'm saying it's a little upsetting that instead of actually changing it for the better they're just over-nerfing.
---
I would play that map
---
"We've removed his ability to sleep survivors, and replaced his glove with a rubber chicken. However, we've increased his base speed considerably, so he can rush to the gates and watch helplessly as everyone leaves."
---
This isnt a hacker its a known bug lol can you even hack on console?
---
Aha! I knew you did it just to upset me, which is why I didn't get upset because I knew me not getting upset would make you upset!
---
Now watch him report you for "Working with the killer" XD
---
Never try to argue with survivors post game chat, 4v1 they always win, on messages they call you toxic if you do anything, only one thing left to do. Hit em with that GG and complements
---
She was tunneling all game, just was really bad at chasing and landing hatchet throws. I‚Äôm pretty sure at that point she had ran out because she was camping and standing back and throwing hatchets at him.
---
Love this- had to be made eventually. And, it‚Äôs one of the only scenes from the movie that actually makes me laugh unironically, too.
---
Skip to 25 seconds for main segment
---
Freddy Rework. Thats the only thing that matters.
---
And thank god for that. Doctor next, Doctor next!
---
Let's hope enough complaints get through so that BHVR ACTUALLY does a rework based on these two things.
---
Id rather unhook myself when the killer is gone rather than get unhooked near the killer. Either way I either end up in the struggle phase or dead.
---
Monitor and abuse will be counter productive, you want bigger terror radius all the time, not just during chase.
---
So me downing 3 ppl bcuz they played altruistically, then one of them using mettle of man and getting another person up for me to have to chase one then the others get rest of them up, and as i go back to my first slug the three that just got up had time to get the fourth guy up, so thats being bad at the game. Maybe, take that edgy tone and go somewhere else and not look for people to shit on for attention.
---
Love it.
---
"Hooking a survivor as The Nightmare is now considered abusive and is a ban-able offense."- Freddy rework, probably.
---
Interesting. I gotta say, I think it‚Äôs a huge step down from Retribution and even Uprising.
---
Show the video where he hit her though...
---
So some extra info:
---
1) The skillcheck sounds are audible but the icon is invisible
---
2) Yes it happened all game
---
3) No I didn't escape
---
4) Yes self care sucks but solo queue + rank reset= no one healing me 
---
5) IDK how but I managed to pip with chases and altruism points, thanks rank reset!
---
Hes going to have fun painting today
---
I think it only works with the scarred hand addon. Otherwise the phantasms don't have collision.
---
Everyone's laughing right up until they realize that their odds of seeing Susie as the killer in a trial after the patch will be smaller than their odds of seeing a Freddy that doesn't use his power.
---
......touch√©
---
Thank God ppl agree lol xD, i hate the intended changes i like that they removed moonwalking but they did a good change then nerfed him to shit
---
But now hes injured, and youre a 115% ms killer
---
I'm not sure how you perform this exploit, but is it possible to do it in a KYF and would you get banned for doing it in private match? I know they're banning for doing it in public matches and I wouldn't dare try it there anyways.
---
Maybe, but at least it's a unique experience even if poorly designed.
---
dead by misplaced tree
---
Why were you following blood during frenzy?
---
Its not, they just cant spam it anymore, making the game unplayable for survivors and you now have to be a good killer with 115 MS and actually think before using the ability.
---
Legion mains are just losing their shit because Legion is not a braindead killer now and most people are just jumping on the memes based on a lie.
---
 I bet you all of this people crying and whining are gonna continue playing Legion after the changed.
---
Here are the changes
---
 https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57702/the-legion-update
---
I'd love to see the post-game chat.
---
Pasty Jane pl0x
---
Vigo's Shroud, Shroud of Union, and Shroud of Binding. Start the trial as far as possible from the Killer, with one other person, or together.
---
&gt;The thing is Legion is not a staller, he's a time waster,
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/YAGpXPd
---
This is still game throwing is it not? I get it, it's annoying. But still...
---
It doesn't really change much from paused during chase or paused under terror radius. They just removed the moonwalking strategy which for any decent killer other than pre-update legion isn't really a viable strategy.
---
So?
---
Ty! UwU

---
And ruins others haha
---
That's sounds like Trapper, but without traps. And a built-in self stun. Amazing killer
---
They used to be very loud with their crackling and it made them super easy to find. Easier than now even.
---
Nope, but saying "they did nothing all game" then showing them being sandbagged just shows them being sandbagged. Making op look like an asshole, people on this sub should use their common sense and not just take everyone for their word
---
Hah, to put legion alongside wraith would be a buff from their current state
---
But there was literally 0 counterplay to frenzy hits. If the Legion had a brain the survivors couldn't do anything to play around it. Once you got hit you were put on a timer. You didn't have anything to defend yourself with.
---
I, for being a Legion main, am pumped. If the add-ons are reworked in a positive way then more variety.
---
wtf does that even mean you fucking dumbass camperkiller?
---
Yeah I get it, when there's one prompt on your screen you're just going to press it unless you don't know better. But the tutorial basically promoting attempting escape puts me on edge.
---
So buffing freddy includes making legion useless *c o o l*
---
Why does it sound like trapper ? Its more of a wraith/freddy situation there. Free first hit with deep wounds and then either go after someone else or end the power and chase the now injured survivor

---
What is interesting in mending? 
---
You still need to mend if you want to heal. If you don't want to heal then now you are against a 115% killer that can down you in 1 hit. And if they ever go away to a different part of the map then you are forced to mend.
---
You mentioned MoM is the reason you lost. So, sure, the survivors all get up; at this point, how many gens were done?
---
Something someone else has mentioned is this; play Nurse. She‚Äôs literally Legion but A) requires skill, B) isn‚Äôt bottom tier, C) isn‚Äôt infuriating to play against, and  D) won‚Äôt lose games from a survivor running MoM. Sure, the survivor will go get the other guy, but the blink will solve this issue quickly (if you know what you‚Äôre doing). And even if you don‚Äôt want to play Nurse, which is totally understandable, you might want to reconsider Legion after his changes go through.
---
Behold the Lazer eyes
---
Yeahhh... but I didn't want to ruin the monochromatic style, and I personally hate when people put a bunch of ugly watermarks all through the image... I guess it's just something I'll have to learn more about to use in the best possible way. I have the original image from before I ran it through Lightroom to make it B&amp;W and touch it up as well, so even if someone tries to steal it I have some proof that it's my art.
---
Half hour yet dude
---
Oh yes, I want all my killers to be Freddy or Wraith strength
---
i mean, y'all have to remember that there's going to be a public test beta testing all of this shit out before it goes live - they'll likely consider feedback and decide what's *actually* implemented from there. it does feel like they've been nerfed into the ground right now, but for all we know they could actually be fun to play. idk, i just say we give it a little time before we start calling them a Freddy-level killer, you know? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! So relatable.
---
I genuinely love this theory.
---
Mettle of man definitely makes a killer want to kill you
---
Overwatch has changed it's trophies many times on PS4 due to character reworks. Not sure about PC
---
Not with a bang, but with a honk.
---
There is no point, you miss one shot while in frenzy you get stunned and they get away, yeah vaulting is useful, but when its literally not lethal honestly it shouldnt be one miss and you get stunned it should be at least 2, but in all honesty wasting effort to use frenzy when it is only gonna be slightly faster and if you miss you get a stun, like it doesnt seem useful. only time it seems useful is if you catch someone off guard but you cant cuz his terror radius is bigger now, also i cant see blood and scratchmarks so tracking is even more difficult, and since my power is: Non Lethal, Slightly faster than my base movement speed, I get stunned if I miss like..theres no reason to use it, other than running bamboozle so you quickly vault, but even then i cant down them with frenzy after and i get stunned before i can chase them. Like he was already weak now he is just freddy, with a vaulting window gimmick, like wtf
---
And then you get 500 for the unhook
---
they won't.  
---
Its been more than 3 months and the achievement is still not updated.  
---
Even the bloody description on steam achievements has not been updated but for consoles it is.
---
Because it‚Äôs not illegal since I wasn‚Äôt intentionally breaking chase perhaps..? 
---
Ugh, sorry, sarcasm aside, I‚Äôll usually follow blood after the first stab in a frenzy activation if the person breaks line of sight with me, frenzy is quite good when used to outrun survivors and cut off the routes they were gonna use
---
Same with us Bill mains, generally. With the old BT especially I'm not about to unhook you too early if the Killer's still around. I save that for when it counts.
---
They did those adjustments. 
---
You are no longer able to moonwalk people, and you can't down people with your power (which had no counterplay, and was the reason it was frustrating to play vs Legion).
---
They also made it so that Legion doesn't have Unrelenting 9000 built into his power, and if you miss your power you get punished (just like every other killer). The only change I'd make is making it so he can see bloodstains in his power (as he can't down people in it anymore) and make it so you don't need a full power charge to use your power. That way you can use it for a moment to jump a pallet and get some distance.
---
Being unique doesn't mean it's fun to play.
---
A game staller is preventing or slowing the survivor from doing objectives for the whole game, like Ruin or Pig's RBTs; a time waster is making the survivor take more time in doing something specific for a short period of time, like Deep Wounds or unhooking against a Hag.
---
It says in the notes all add ons have been reworked to reflect the changes, so I'd imagine it'll be different.
---
Y'all mad cause you cant moonwalk anymore with a braindead killer?
---
I cant believe the things people assume is camping. Just because they want an easy win t bag hatch escape.
---
I actually don't think these changes are as much of a nerf as people are saying. Obviously you aren't going to be downing people with deep wounds anymore, but I think it'll be a lot more useful as a pressure tool now.
---
Depending on how long feral frenzy actually lasts (I wish BHVR would just give us the numbers) we might be able to apply it to multiple people more consistently now. With perks like Monitor and Discordance, you could conceivably sneak up on two people, apply deep wounds to both of them and then run the second person down with your improved movement speed.
---
And since you'll be at greater danger of being M1'd down, survivors are more likely to heal up as well, wasting even more time.
---
But really, it all comes down to how effectively you can reach multiple people with feral frenzy. Since we don't know how much slower it will actually be it's hard to say at this point. But I'm not gonna act like the sky is falling until I actually see it in action.
---
Because he ignores so many of the game mechanics (pallets, windows) and makes chases unfun. Nurse does similar stuff with ignoring pallets and such, but her skill ceiling is much higher, requires some semblance of skill to properly do that stuff and isn‚Äôt infuriating to play against.
---
Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
---
115% movement speed means shit if the power is trash.
---
Yesss!
---
Yeah, I think the 32meter radius might help with getting to the other survivors while in feral frenzy, rather than just the 24m range.
---
Fun idea... Just without your attitude.
---
2edgy4me
---
Well if they did that they would actually have to issue refunds so instead they just make a garbage killer that no ones gonna use and anyone who actually spent money on him gets screwed
---
Where at?
---
Your thinking about level two survivor level without even three perks and a loose understanding on the game.
---
I played this game for three weeks just on Xbox and easily manage to figure out that as a survivor 
---
don‚Äôt run all the time
---
Don‚Äôt mess up skill checks
---
Find fire totems and regular and cleanse them
---
Figure out when it‚Äôs easy to run or dropping a pallet
---
Stay out of the basement for the love of god
---
Split up generators and don‚Äôt huddle up.
---
Freddy is an excellent killer.
---
Exploding a gen will wake up *everyone who is working on that gen*.
---
Cutting yourself while healing will wake you up, while cutting someone else will wake them up.
---
Failing a skill check on a hook does nothing but alert Freddy, though. :L
---
Is It better to continue to invest in the game on PS4 or switch to PC and repurchase what dlcs I want?
---
I play solo, I have made some dlc/cosmetic purchases on PS4. 
---
However, I‚Äôm concerned that the community is larger on PC and as a result will see the most attention from the developer into the future as well as more ppl thus quicker matches 
---
Thoughts?
---
Damn. Into the ground
---
Still doing 180s in the cornfield, we dont have the heart to tell her the match is over.
---
1 gen on thompson house, they gave me a three gen.  
---
Also not playing nurse, or because I played legion doesnt mean MoM isnt broken, and legion changes are gonna be ass i agree with that. Nurse breaks the game, and I dont wanna play a killer that I deem as unfair, theres a reason shes at the top tier for a reason cuz she literally breaks how the game works. Also Nurse is infuriating to play against, I always do fine as legion without camping or tunneling the unhooked, but when a perk takes all my momentum and says "momentum? gone." how is that not infuriating to play against. I like playing a variety of killer but when survivors win bcuz they have a crutch perk, that doesnt feel good..also the reason why I dont use NOED bcuz its just as much of a crutch as MoM is currently. Why do I get punished when I wouldve won without her running that specific perk, but lost bcuz she had one perk that rewards you for getting hit.
---
Uhmm she would have gottem those stitches if he didn't DC
---
Your right with plague if your 4 man swf the no cleansing thing works great but if your with randoms your just making yourself easy to kill.
---
Run play with your food and become a recruit/default killer
---
To be fair, this does seem like a lot of things are changed at once and maybe the changes should be a bit more gradual. I really hated the legions that spammed feral frenzy I always felt like that was an exploit.
---
Following
---
Technically he's going to be equally as good as wraith. He gets 1 free hit and then finishes with an m1 hit as a 115 speed killer
---
If I know I‚Äôm about to struggle, I‚Äôll attempt. Sometimes I get lucky and pull myself off the hook, other times I don‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why everyone thinks it‚Äôs such a powerful perk. It‚Äôs only good once and you have to reveal yourself to the killer when you heal back to full health if not inside terror radius. Wouldn‚Äôt dead hard be better, or?
---
?????? What else was a buff
---
Git Gud and you can be the movie killer :\^)
---
Bless you, my sweet summer child.
---
Then why are you writing paragraphs to random kids on the Reddit?
---
If you actually want a refund because they changed the way a killer works then you're delusional. Legion isn't fucking ruined, you just can't play them like a total shitbag anymore. The people who played legion normally aren't even going to be affected by these changes.
---
FROM THE FORUM
---
&gt;The following changes allow for direct Survivor counter-play, reduce the potential for exploiting certain game mechanics, and bring The Legion‚Äôs default attributes in-line with other Killers, all while retaining the core vision of this Killer. 
---
It's clear you just want an overpowered killer so here are some suggestions (two of which are free): Spirit, Nurse, and Billy in that order.
---
Nurse breaks the game? She ignores pallets and windows much like Legion, except she requires more skill. She can do short noclip, but just using your eyes/ears and doing simple stuff as quickly changing direction can counter Nurse easily. That, plus her movement speed makes her powerful yet not so powerful she breaks the game. I don‚Äôt know where you got that from.
---
So edgy. And you realize your chance of escaping drops with every other person that dies right? Or do you just ignore gens and search for the hatch all game?
---
My issue comes from the fact that I feel as if survivor feedback is going to outweigh killer feedback. Survivors will be happy legion is nerfed most likely, as I've seen a ton of people flapping their tongues saying how it's a godsend that this character is ruined. I'm hoping the feedback reaches them, I'm just not hopeful. I'll save a lot of it for when the final update comes, but right now it doesnt look good at all.
---
Loving how my meme post is getting down voted üòÇ this community is great !
---
If you are in madness a 'hologram' of the doctor will apear looking in your direction, thereby helping the doctor track you down
---
It‚Äôs so nice
---
r/dataisbeautiful
---
It's not even a licensed character you whiny fucking bitch, there are 2 options here either you bought legion before you knew how strong he was, so if he was released post-nerf you would've bought him anyways because you buy shit without researching it 
---
or B you bought legion specifically because he was the most braindead piece of garbage killer and you should've known the game wasn't gonna stay very easy, braindead, everyone hates you for playing it-mode forever. You didn't waste your money you bought 4 months of finally being able to beat survivors who would normally be teabagging your ass at the gate and now those 4 months of babysitting are over and go fuck yourself.
---
Yeah I get it's a somewhat small game team but I've seen one man indie devs do waaaaay better. What's going on with Behavior?
---
I was about to get angry but then
---
&gt; Like a quiet crackling sound
---
Almost got bamboozled, pack up the angry comments you guys, it's a joke.
---
‚Äúim gonna laugh my dick off‚Äù 
---
sounds interesting...
---
Letterman Frank is the best.
---
So what if i bought legion because it was on sale 2 weeks ago, decided to level it up and i came across both add ons, had nothing else to use so i equipped the double mend? (I only did the double mend like for two games not knowing about this bug...)
---
Hot take: legion is one of the most fun killers to play as, could care less what the memey groupthink is here.
---
The only reason freddy got nerfed was that he was unfun to play against. Legion is getting nerfed for the same reason.
---
That actually sounds pretty cool.
---
In no way does doctor need changes lmao
---
He literally have no context of what happened, all I see here if a Nea sandbagging a Dwight
---
And when they frenzy another Legion member appears and pushes the wheelchair for them.
---
Things that were wrong:
---
Moonwalking and dropping chase to make the survivor bleed out with no counterplay. This got fixed - Terror radius stops the bleedout. Mending stops the bleedout.
---
Feral frenzy hits are unavoidable, so no matter how well you play you will go down with no counterplay. Frank's mixtape only made it worse. This got fixed - Frenzy hits are still unavoidable, but they can't down you anymore. The survivor now has means of countering them. Legion now has normal movement speed so they have realistic means of downing you normally.
---
The survivor can also try to spin the killer to make them miss and cancel the power. Frank's mixtape is getting reworked. 
---
Sounds like a lot of good changes to me.
---
Awww, someone doesn't have the F pass :(
---
So in Layman's terms, goodbye Legions. 
---
Un-be-fucking-leivable. They actually just made him worthless now. Nothing can ever be in the middle, it's either REALLY good or REALLY bad in this game.
---
I think Legion will take Freddy's place. These changes sound like a complete nerf. Legion wasn't OP, I'd argue he was even weak, it's just that a few of his mechanics got exploited and some of his addons were very strong.
---
The problem was that he was annoying to play against. This change sounds like a direct nerf and I think he will be WAY worse than Freddy.
---
But hey, at least we get rid of the non-counterplay annoying killer legion used to be
---
"it do be like that." - Claudette
---
way to nerf him. If you want to get steam rolled then play legion.
---
This is so sad :( Alexa, can we play Frank's mixtape?
---
Not a lot, increased MS to 115% (more efficient chases), increased TR to 32 m (better tracking) you have to wait for the gauge to fill completely to use it again (so stop spamming), decreased feral frenzy speed (stop tunneling), you cant see the progression of the DW bar (no more moonwalking exploit) increased feral frenzy duration (more efficient chases).
---
Thats basically it. They made him more efficient and less annoying. Basically any non-spamming/tunnelling Legion got a pretty big speed buff. Now, the spamming/tunneling Legions got deleted.
---
Oof
---
It was introduced as a mechanic to balance borrowed time - it made the perk what was said - borrowed time. You had time, sure, but you had escape the killer quickly - If you didn't actively try to escape, you'd die anyways. Thus your time was borrowed.  Now there is no incentive to actually escape the chase - your timer is paused, so it's only actual detriment is spending a brief time healing a wound that doesn't even show on nurse's calling. Barring the exploit, that is nothing.  And now it doesn't even proc inside the terror radius, so you have literally no incentive to try and heal it until you are far enough away from the killer that there is no way at all he can try to punish you for it.
---
