That's a cool Vigil idea but ultimately it's kinda complicated.
---

---
Also the Wake Up! and Pharamacy are fine perks.
---
---
---
That's kinda sad.
---
just noticed the description today and it was chuckle worthy
---
Kinda biased as she’s also my favorite killer to play, but probably Pig.  I just really like having to stay on guard for potential jump scares, and I feel like she manages to sneak up on my better than Wraith and Myers in most matches.
---
Somebody likes going up against the legion.

Is there ANY sort of reward for achieving a level of devotion?
---
BARBRA STREISAND
---
It depends on the time but it takes me anywhere from 2-15 minutes to find a single game.  Red ranks. 
---
'no hard counters' oh really because I'm pretty sure dribbling only takes about 15 seconds, compared to the time it takes to find every single dull totem and then cleanse them instead of doing gens and actually helping your dying teammates. 
---
Idk what’s sadder, the fact they waited that long to jump or the fact you committed to a hatch stand as killer.
---
I would say the clown. He makes me laugh and i can't take him seriously tbh lol. 
---
It doesn’t, some friends and I tested that. 
---
I do know some killas have been the ranking by playing stealth killers and just hiding in corners and waiting for the survivors to leave
---
Hm 80% of the pigs I face are hookcampers. Worse than kewtherfaces. And if they don't camp the hook they camp the trap removal machines.  Very unfun to play against xD
---
Not worth taking every game in case the killer is Doc
---
The face doesn't look like feng at all?
---
Smol billy. I missed you
---
None. Every killer is unfun in some way, just how all Survivors with good perks are unfun to kill. Imo the appeal in this game is the thrill of escaping and the thrill of killing respectively. Even the worst, trash-tier chars/perks can feel cheesy. 
---
Das just me though.
---
- Downs survivor
---
- Hooks with 2 survivors following
---
- Appears climbing out of locker in basement
---
Excuse me, what the fuck
---
I main survivor and don't play too much killer. I purchased the Halloween Chapter DLC to get Laurie Strode and Decisive Strike, and ended up really enjoying playing as The Shape (Mike Myers).
---
Hag is a strong killer. Huntress is strong and very fun. Billy's movement takes some time to get used to, but he is also a good killer. The Nurse is also one of the best, but I think she has a high skill floor (I'm not good with her at all).
---
I've gotten only maybe 3 hatemails playing survivor from the killers. Ironically they were all from Leatherface players.
---
Insidious? Why ? You're stalthy anyways to people outside dream world. And inside you're busy chasing them .hopefully
---
Insidious is poop.
---
But M&amp;A works good on him
---
What if they did something with him like starting out as a survivor or looking like one so he blends in really well. Like survivors see him as another survivor since in the movies it’s always like “who is ghostface” and it’s always someone they didn’t think it would be. 
---
I enjoy playing pig as well! I love how the traps slow down the game for killers, I really don’t play any survivor so I love getting all this input. 
---
He was my #2 for that and the awesome cosmetics, but I had a bunch of people dc against me today all saying they hate facing clown and that he’s no fun to face. 
---
I agree. Lightweight is a permanent part of my build and I love it
---
Insidious is wall hacks on Freddy.
---
As our lord and saviour Demi says skins = skill
---
I feel like it has to be Michael Myers. The Clown is also reasonably strong without being annoying, though for some reason he seems to have the Leatherface thing going on where a lot of people who play him just facecamp.
---
Same works for xbox owners I have a gold account yet the wife plays her profile on my "home" xbox while I use my gold account on her xbox.
---
Yeah, they usually signalled this in the lobby by turning the ready button on and off repeatedly. 
---
I got one last night and when I realised it, I brought a key to get that "Where did they go?" achievement. True enough, found a Billy just swinging his axe in a corner so we did all 5 gens then I had to convince my random team mates to find the hatch. We found it and got out like t through it. 
---
I had this too!
---
Mostly After a round ends and im trying to get back in the lobby. 
---
I have to restart the game then because the loading screen is fucking endless
---
I hate toxicity as much as the next guy but when someone else starts it, all bets are off. LET THE BOOTY DROP
---
Sorry, you don't get shards, it's more like since you are level 1 again you can start earning shards again. And since it takes less exp to level up from say 1 to 2, than 91 to 92, you earn them at a faster rate
---
I've been around since launch, and can agree it's not as bad as before. I don't think that takes away from the fact that killers literally have ability to end a game with little effort. Most killers who run moris also like to camp and/or tunnel off hook, completely ruining the survivors experience. I'm not debating it's fairness or usefulness, simply that it's unbalanced and unfair in the grand scheme of the game.
---
Breaks the locker
---
I love the artwork
---
It should be Meg tho
---
Found the claudette!
---
I love how the definition of tunneled has moved on from “overly focusing on one person to get an easy kill and ignoring other people” to “running the killer around really well, getting myself tons of points and contributing to everyone escaping”
---
This is why I don’t take people who complain about tunneling seriously 
---
No I'm not saying he is good. I'm saying he's broken, as in he fundamentally breaks the chase.
---
hacks
---
DS is a one time thing that doesn't always work (not being the obsession, getting dribbled or missing it). NOED can completely throw the game.
---
With the recent buff, NOED can be used by a level 1 killer who just bought the game and instead of having the usual learning curve, will assume they're really good at the game and have a massive ego due to getting easy kills from a crutch. On the other hand, DS is not only a teachable perk, but a teachable perk from a licensed character. Meaning not every single player even has it unless they bought it from the shrine which is going to be a rare occurrence.
---
Every other killer has NOED now, while DS users are a lot rarer and half the time won't even use it for whatever reason. 
---
So tell me again that DS is worse than NOED. 
---
Personally, I hate the Pig because I feel like I spend 90% of the game running between boxes. I know she has a hard time catching people if they see her first, but if she gets you, that's pretty much the end of your bloodpoints for that match.
---
Repost.
---
Extra extra. Come and get your demi plays.
---
Over the last week it has been awful as survivor I play with a friend and we are often 20-30 minutes for a game and every now and then we get lucky and wait just 5 
---
I had a mori like that once... All survivors immediately DCed when player 1 died.
---
All day, every day. Frustrating times in dbd.
---
That's my secret, Claudette. I'm always in a locker.
---
nice house reference
---
Spirit does not actually rustle grass, just thought I’d point that out
---
That's why you bring self care never would of had a hatch stand off if she brought self care
---
It doesn’t get rid of the perk, you’ll get hit later on unless you have a mori or happen to be within dribbling range a second time and a third time. That, and you can’t always dribble; with the hook adjustments we have currently and especially after the coming ones it’s not common to down the DS in a spot where you can dribble.
---
/u/vreddit_bot
---
Yeah, dunno what it is but I've noticed a lot since Legion came out that a lot of people have started using tunnelling not as 'going after one person multiple times to remove them from the game early' to 'chasing someone until they're downed.'
---
Every one is like "Legion strong at tunnelling," what, if I down you without stabbing EVERY other survivor first, that's tunnelling now?

&gt; • Decreases the Reverse Bear Trap Death Timer by 2 minutes.
---
So... the survivors head instantly blows up?
---
Before the game got a major integration of EAC and started storing most account data on a server, people could just open their save files with "homemade" editors like it's Borderlands 1 and edit amound of points or consumables they have.
---
Now if only both sides involved could recognize that when they get spanked for it.
---
to make it worse, toxicity is subjective as all fuck get out.  What is normal to some might be toxic to others.
---
Guess I’m stupid then
---
*infinity war theme earape* 
---
It's day thirteen. People still haven't read my username. The downvotes continue to come in. 
---
Perhaps they're not paying attention, perhaps they think that YOU'RE not paying attention. I've also had people who ran away after letting them wiggle off right beside a gen or Jigsaw box. Or when dropping them at the hatch, I like to grab them, move for a sec in a different direction then drop them back at the hatch and then back off completely. Then I ask in post-game chat if I spooked them.
---
It just feels nice, you know?
---
Most importantly you had fun!
---
Imagine coming upon a downed survivor, with another downed survivor right next to him, and you don’t know which is your friend and which is a trap. 
---
The only problem is that you don't stop toxicity with toxicity.  You breed more of it.  The main problem here is that neither side cares about the others current/past games, which can quickly come to dictate a players behavior after enough time.
---
Yes it's fun to spank a camper.  It's similarly fun to let a toxic survivor spend the whole game on the ground bleeding out.  But in the end it accomplishes nothing... since, again, toxicity breeds toxicity.
---
I left my girlfriend play dbd for the first time, one claudette decided to do this to her,  she got scared and didn't want to play anymore
---
I took control and hunted that claudette until she was dead
---
I legit think I just had mt best killer moment followed by salt. I seriously wish I had recorded this.
---
I'm playing Freddy, and this Bill is really good at leading me to windows. I hook him, walk away, Claudette I never saw the entire match rescues him. I turn, not far away and give chase, Bill leads me to the pallets just as I hit him with Dream Demon. He waits, I wait, we both know the expected outcome, but I pull the trigger first and manage to strike the instant he falls asleep. We're talking, when I lunged, he's still awake. It was amazing. I haven't felt that good since my last beej it was so wild.
---
Post-chat: "U have lag dood!"
---
I AIN'T FEELIN' SO GOOD MISTER VISCONTI 
---
You could always drop them and be all:
---
“Whew! Got you out of there before you suffocated.!
---
There's like 6 of us out there
---
Absolutely this.  There's definitely other stuff that drives me insane, obvious toxic behaviors and whatnot, but this one really feels like rubbing salt in the wound.  I can understand when they're split and trying to buy time for people opening the other gate/find the open gate, that's totally fair.  But when all 4 are just hanging out at one gate together, or one group leaves and then the others wait for you to /also/ shepherd them out of the other gate as well, you're just wasting the killer's time for no reason.
---
*doesnt give any valid points or understand game, proceeds to say that about me instead* good one, you’re so clever trying to undermine my points by literally just saying I don’t have any. Except that facts don’t work like that sorry. And I didn’t start an argument, I didn’t even start a conversation, you did. And you made it an argument instead of a conversation by whining like a baby, never making points, trying to say nothing I’m saying is valid without any evidence or proof. You sound like a bad political leader. I’m sure things you don’t understand seem “dumb” to you but you just gotta understand that some things (maybe a lot) are beyond your understanding. Also I’ve been trying to converse not argue, and for the sake of debate while you continuously try to backpeddle and back your way out of it, making it an argument, not saying anything, then saying you’re leaving and then don’t. So go ahead stop replying like you’ve said you would numerous times, make like the baby you are and head out
---
Hag and Cheryl? In my DBD subreddit? Upvote.
---
Why not both? With a bit of Tea-Bags after with some Hex?
---
That would be terrible.
---
Domt feel bad I'm a rank 15 killer and i got a lobby of red and purple ranks
---
Someone made it a ringtone
---
:(
---
Keanu reeves plays john wick...
---
Try Shadowborn and Bloodhound
---
I try not to get caught up in making arbitrary rules like that, for my own sanity, if nothing else.  Yeah the looping and blinding are annoying, but I accept that's what survivors need to do to avoid dying even if it's frustrating at times.  I will say though, there's no reason or justification for the toxicity you get from some people.  The constant flashlight clicks, the teabagging at ever pallet, etc.  I don't think that "don't BM your opponents all game" should be that controversial a rule to have, but it apparently is sometimes.
---
"one of you will have to be sacrificed so the others can live"
---
Its feels bad especially when its just your first hook
---
“Shit, I left my phone unlocked near my girl!”
---
Keanu is Jesus, and so is Jeff, so yes.\
---
you don't miss out on a chance to teabag a dumbass teammate who managed to get moried at the gate by being too cocky
---
&gt; What is normal to some might be toxic to others.
---
This is the biggest problem. One team seems the other do something they consider toxic -&gt; 
---
does something more toxic -&gt; other team is pissed because they were just playing the game
---
Lmfao I was mad confused on why you were leaving 
---
She swings in an arc from right to left. If you're unsure that you're about to hit someone that wants to 360 or 180 you then follow that arc starting from right and follow through with it to the left. It makes her attack an aoe instead of just a direct straight through. It might just be a mental/visual thing, for me at least, but I swear by it and always land a hit against people doing 360's and 180's. 
---
She's good with just about every perk. Bloodwebs can suck for any killer but a couple of good perks for her to start with if you get them in the web are monitor and abuse and whispers. I would say ruin but that's a given since it's universally a good perk for every killer.
---
Also, don't crouch walk everywhere you go. She's super slow crouch walking. If you do that and go to the wrong side of the map 3 gens will pop before you've found a single person. Use ambush at loops. Take ownership of that pallet the survivor wants to use and fake. Shes more of a steathly mind gamie type of killer for most people. I'm super aggressive with her and only mind game at loops. She's stealthy for now until the ptb goes through as a live patch for all platforms. 
---
A lot of it is just getting used to her and her camera height. For me it was when I first started using her. Might be different for you. Her camera height is slightly higher than hags and exactly hags height while crouched.
---
It is really slow for survivors. As killer, it takes 30 secs.
---
I personally love versing the hillbilly. There’s something tense about hearing him revving his chainsaw right behind you as you turn a corner only to realise there’s nothing but straight ahead
---
Hey at least it’s not somebody’s else artwork without credit. 
---
whats that moon walk strategy?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Playing against a Rank 1 Pig or Hag main is always really fun. 
---
you are also not hindering anyone by going afk, you don't have any teammates to disappoint and survivors can just repair the gens and leave. there is no reason to implement any afk mechanic for killers
---
and I hope it stays that way, it allows me to go for a smoke during hatch stand-offs
---
He could have worded it a bit differently, but I can see where he is coming from. Splitting the player-base, or any player-base, with multiple game modes can often lead to more harm than good, e.g. longer queue times. There isn’t really an “easy” fix to the whole de-ranking issue I feel. 
---
Your title is hilarious 
---
Why would he whack her instead of picking her up
---
Myers or Huntress. Myers is fun to face and vs huntress it's skill matchup. I never see anything else after that besides Billy, Nurse, Spirit and Clown unless I derank.
---
Buy perks you want to use. That is all.
---
From what I've played, about 98% of them use it.
---
This is the problem. It makes sense on trapper and hag because they need prepararion time. Likewise it helps killers with no map pressure.
---
It can be op as hell on Billy or especially Nurse.
---
Apply 'Deep Wounds', then follow them while looking away so it breaks the chase and starts their timer. 
---
and doctor
---
yes rank 1 in three days it's very easy to get.
---
"disconnecting doesn’t mean you’re bad at the game" i never said it did.
---
and you can die instantly you just use object of obsession run up to the killer let him hook you try 4% and don't struggle easy death.
---
you don't know why this comment infuriates you it's because you lack intelligence sorry hug and kisses.
---
DON’T DEAD
---
COMPLAIN INSIDE!
---
I can see the appeal in only unlocking the ones you want, but the completionist in me unlocked them all anyway. 
---
Another one that's been given is intentivizing rank with BP or shards. There are definitely things to try
---
da hoontreees
---
r/thishappened
---
is this console?
---
That's why you don't play Freddy
---
I wish you guys could come up with a list or something so the rest of us know when DC'ing is or isn't shitty on the other players. 
---
The first couple of people you down in the beginning, It's best to get a trap on them asap. A gen is about to pop. Start their timer. Nothing wastes more time than 2 people not doing gens while you patrol the other gens. The survivors don't always get the trap off in the first 2 or 3 trap boxes. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't. This is most effective if you don't have ruin.
---
Everyone plays her differently though. Some save them for end game and others use them sparingly. I use them all at once. Ruin + 4 traps = no gens being done by anyone at all.
---
unlikely because killers want DS out the game and survivors with noed
---
I know a nerf for noed but not DS 
---
It often veels for survivors that the killer is camping but most of the times its the actions of other survivors that make the killer camp. Its not a bad thing to check up on your hooked survivors, just make sure your giving them atleast some time to even unhook them.
---
I don't think that you camp. You also have to understand that survivor can be very salty and toxic. 
---
As for Camping I understand that you are close to the hook and looking at the hooked survivor or running around the hook.
---
But the Problem is this : If You see 3 people running to you to save the hooked and you trying to hit/chase them that would be fine (since where should you go If you know there are all survivors there) But they will still gonna call you camper.
---
I suppose. But it still doesn’t solve the issue of ranking in general being too loose in this game. Unlike in other competitive games where there is a clear delineation between each competitive tier, DBD’s ranking system is just a mishmash of varying skillsets. You only really notice a real difference in skill in the extremes, red and yellow/brown ranks. There is no real difference between a green rank or a purple rank or even a purple and a red rank. Maybe I’m asking for too much, but I’m pretty much parroting what other people are saying in terms of rank actually meaning something. 
---
How is that bad matchmaking? 49/4 is 12.25, it's pretty close
---
I really don’t mind killers that camp . Killers have to do what they can to secure the Kill .. if that is what their play-style is like then oh well , on to the next game .. it may be lame for a survivor but bags,flashlights,party starters, keys,pallets etc are lame in the killers eyes.. camping  doesn’t happen much at all in low ranks .  Are you always getting hooked first or something ??? Get better perks so you don’t get caught . Or maybe it’s your outfit lol .
---
I was going to put it there but I dunno if anyone other than a few would get it.
---
Unrelated but are you the guy who did those halo the musical videos
---
LOL THOSE DOWNVOTES
---
Console 
---
((Iron Maiden))
---
Ummm idk what you mean but it is really bad matchmaking. Had to wait 20 minutes for this lobby too. 
---
I think when people say he's "overpowered" which we all know he isn't, people are talking more about the fact that there's no counter play to him at all. People are tunneled with sloppy butcher until he downs them because there's no actual way he can down anyone without doing that because he is so weak. 
---
You cant vault or drop pallets when you are screaming. Know that when he charges up shock,, he moves slower than you. Use that time t ik build extra distance, especially if he has electrode add ons. Otherwise, loop him as normal unless you hear his madness charging
---
Generally yes, but no other thing had that much impact, even Thick Mist did not impair the vision as much as looking for 4 stealth outfits Claudettes in a majorly darkened map. Both the swings of lightning were weird to balance and were abused probably the most, even compared to old Mori that let you kill without hooking, so they got rid of Boquets.
---
When you forgot to max your stacks of WGLF
---
Okay i get deep wounds applied to me, the legion is following me so the timer is ticking down, i drop a pallet, try to mend, he break its, then he kills me, i vault a window, try to mind, he just moves through it, then he kills me. I keep running, he keeps following, the timer ticks down, i fall on the ground, he kills me. I somehow lose him, he activates frenzy, sees my pulse, reduces my timer, and starts the process over again with even less time for me.
---
I am not a fan of doing a DC, but if a player does that I just nope out the game, not going to play a unfun match. I would prefer to lose the 6k BP and find a more fun killer to play against.
---
Id usually agree but recently in my region theres been a lot of doctors and ive learned to love it
---
understandable
---
"Oink, oink" is equally acceptable coming from Leatherface.
---
He’s overpowered in the sense that if he hits you once with frenzy, you’re going on the hook. Considering how easy it is to be hit by a frenzy attack as vaults and pallets are useless, you can see why no-one enjoys playing as him or against him; his power negates the chase.
---
Legion is still horrible, and seemingly impossible to balance as is. They need a complete rework.

For context I started playing some LF since I have neglected playing/leveling my killers in favor of my survivors. I pretty much just have my default perks atm, so Knockout and hoping they take forever to find the downed obsession is really my only counter right now, at least until I find Enduring in a lucky bloodweb.

The frames are better on the One X, not crazy good but definitely better

 Literally 90% of them. They all run the same cycle of perks making every game boring and predictable.
---
Awesome advice!! Honestly didnt know that you cant pallet or drop only when he's charging..... that is going to help a lot!
---
why in the fuck did this get downvoted?
---
source?
---
r/iamverysmart seems relevant
---
Also that’s BS because I’m rank 8, meaning I’m fairly good at the game, while these rank 14’s and 15’s are fairly new to the game. While your math is correct, it doesn’t excuse this bullshit matchmaking. 
---
2.5k hrs and nothing annoys me more than 3 surv watching me die on the hook instead if doing gens.
---
Basic Doc build honestly. That's pretty much the most meta build you can have on him.
---
again you managed to say nothing of substance, no answer as to how they were, just vague nonsense.
---
Well I can't help someone with a kindergarten reading level
---
Bloodhound and Sloppy do you really need anything else?
---
Wow, you really are an idiot.
---
Still managed to dodge the actual question, solid job.
---
How so? Please enlighten me :)
---
WAIT! I FORGOT MY FLASHLIGHT!
---
I mean killers have the right to slug whenever they feel like it, especially when the person has DS, but yeah you right. 
---
Try reading and maybe brush up on some basic math :)
---
Standing around the hooked survivor without a reason beyond "securing a kill."
---
More effort in that than in these memes.
---
Jiren would like to have a word with you
---
Savage.
---
You *can* hit them, though it is pretty difficult. I'd still report for taking the game hostage though.
---
Thanks for the advice. I’ll try it.
---
lets go over all the comments so we are clear. they all brought toolboxes. not toxic. they gen rushed. not toxic. you weren't playing bad except you were, half the thread already told you that. still no answer to how they were toxic. got it.
---
my name is my name Add and we can play 😤
---
idk if I'd consider rank 8 a high ranking survivor right before reset
---
In the grand scheme of things, no it’s not a high rank, but for these new players it is. Imagine playing Overwatch as a Gold and playing against Diamonds or Masters. Doesn’t seem fair, right? 
---
How are we toxic, lol?
---
If gen rushing isn't toxic then facecampping isn't toxic I guess
---
It's mind wars, if I see killer is bad and I can run him around, I will t-bag him so he looses his mind and turns on tunnel vision. When he eventually hook me up, I know he's gonna face camp me, so my team can peacefully do gens and escape.
---
Yes. I play in a party with friends I clearly are a noob. Nice logic
---
It was a joke lol
---
I was a trapper doing a daily when I came across Jen's super squad.  
---
My heart sank when I heard the flashlight macro click. I knew.  They dismantled me for a bit, but it wasn't long before Jen figured out I was doing a daily.   The game shifted, they took it easier on me, I got the daily done, got some hooks, we all played around a bit, I learned a lot in a short amount of time going up against such an incredibly talented team.
---
Jen isn't the problem.  And in fact from my own personal experience plus watching her streams she holds back often when she realizes it's a true baby killer, they mess around a lot.  And I know that they don't go all out every game, else it'd be horribly boring.   
---
They do exercise some control and such.  But at that Rank 1-5 isn't terribly different than 5-10.  Can you blame them for wanting to stay around Rank 8ish for faster queues, variety, etc?   
---
tl;dr -- I don't know why people want to punish Jendenise.  This isn't her fault at all, this is matchmaking and BHVR's fault for funneling people into a bad matchmaking and ranking system.  
---
oh they're trying to down rank but it also let's survivors farm
---
Hit rank 1 a while ago but ok. The fact that you compare internet arguments to battles just makes you look like a complete fucking looser bud
---
"Faster queues?"  Survivors always have faster queues and spare me the bullshit about variety, they do it because at red ranks they start to face people that stand a higher chance of knowing how to play.  
---
This is someone that was developer appointed to be a leader by example in the community, instead you have her DCing daily and spending ten hours with a SWF looping and shit talking killers that obviously aren't the type that play DBD until they have a nest of cysts on their tailbone.
---
U are luck I got two survivor with lvl 2 swf team.
---
Depends if it was on purpose or not. I've seen clips of people spawning on top of shit like that before.
---
What? lol
---
how i feel when i leave my room and go outside for the first time in a week
---
I get it! 😂 
---
Even if you spawn on top, if you never actually get off of it, then it makes no difference.
---
If the average rank of an overwatch game was 3800 vs 4k I don't think it's that much of a problem, no
---
Want to practice? I've been practicing with nurse for over a month now and we can take turns practicing our blinks in kyf?
---
Yeah, think it was on purpose cuz she kept t-bagging, etc. tricked her off though, 4 man so it ended ok.
---
That's not a bug, Moris can't be stopped once they start by either party
---
I mean an argument is kind of like a battle, just online. The fact that you even replied (as expected) that you got triggered with "toxic" behavior as gen rushing is fucking embarrassing. You have such thin skin and are so inept at killer that you think the only means of survivors winning the game is toxic behavior. Dominated, once again.
---
Survivor queues are instantaneous at R1 if the lobby isn't bugged
---
It's probably a bot or someone trying to derank.
---
Or, you could just eat the DS and down them again?
---
Real talk I'd rather see someone fumbling with a chest across the map than watching the killer facecamp.
---
You are not forced to prestige tho o
---
Nah I don't see one
---
Haha, he does say it.
---
Talks about being thin skinned yet got triggered by a comment that had nothing to do with. Why do you survivor mains take it so personally? And if you want to talk about embarrassing you should look at your own replies. You take so much pride in "dominating" a person you've never even met because you got triggered by a comment. Nice job bud :)
---
Had this happen to me earlier it’s annoying. 
---
Side question. How’d you get your video to be embedded and be be able to click to play from Reddit instead of being redirected?
---
NB4 the.. ya know.. that link
---
1) Ruin. So you can slow the game down So Un poquito
---
2) I dont ptb
---
3) Nea, cause she is cute and I like her Pink pin-up hair with glasses. 
---
4) I think its fine the way it is honestly. I would award extra bp to killers who face them. 10-25-50% bonus based on size.
---
Or I could just leave them bleeding out? There are certainly benefits to hooking them, but leaving them bleeding out tends to increase altruism among survivors. I tend to do better having just left them on the floor. On the floor a survivor is just as useless to their team as being on the hook. Both are perfectly valid strategies for killing survivors.
---
Tbh I’d 100% rather 1 person watch the killer facecamp somebody than they actually try to save that person because at least then they don’t go down as well
---
Ps4? 
---
Do you do the legion exploit(?) where you chase the survivor without being in chase so they cant mend?
---
If you're truly stuck at a place like that, then you're better off just dcing and going to the next game since you can't get out. Getting stuck happens (got stuck in a pallet as freddy today and everyone woke up shortly after; would not recommend) and if it's impossible to get out, then just leave and find another match.
---
Imo I never use Hex Ruin despite how many killer mains rely on it and never struggle for a 4k.
---
If I were to use a Hex, id use either NOED, Haunted Grounds or Devour Hope.
---
That being said, with the exception to NOED &amp; Haunted Grounds, I never use Hex perks due to the simple fact that they can be destroyed and made useless so quickly at high rank play (I'm at rank 1, have been for about a year and a half).
---
The only time I'll use Noed is on killers who are stronger in the end game such as Trapper or Freddy (I tend to not use hex perks on Freddy though)
---
The only time I'll really run a hex perk (that isnt haunted grounds) is if im playing a killer that can protect their totems easy such as Trapper, Billy, and Hag.
---
Now, Haunted Grounds. That perk is god sent. It's good on any killer (sometimes its pretty ok on Freddy, but he's a killer you won't want to run Exposure perks on due to his kit). Now Hauntwd Grounds is sometimes hit or miss, because sometimes it'll get destroyed as soon as the match starts and you dont find anyone to use it on, and sometimes it'll be destroyed mid chase, giving you a great advantage, so sometimes its a wasted perk slot.
---
Tbh, the only time you'll wanna use a hex perk at high rank play is when youre playing Trapper. You can more often than not, trap your totem and be 100% ok on it never being destroyed because either you'll get the notification when someone sets off your trap and you can march over there before it's destroyed, or they'll step in it and you'll get there before they get out of the trap. The only issue is, without Iridiescent Stone, you'll be constantly resetting the traps on your totems, and if you didn't bring in a purple trapper bag, you'll be wasting up to 4 of your only traps on the map, making it so youre at a loss on having traps in good loop spots and at the doors for when end game happens
---
Idiots wasting time
---
I don’t get it why do they do that when the killer isn’t even in range and can’t see them
---
You gave him the hatch, you did make it easy. Stop fucking doing that. You're training the survivors to get entitled.
---
Maybe it’s the sleep deprivation, or me being blind, but I don’t see a link. 
---
I think its really dumb because its a perk they can just be compleatly avoided like thats not how perks work
---
You’re in! 
---
Did that Adam tea bag you or the dumb team mate
---
*secret cult noises*
---
How?
---
What did they change
---
no?
---
That would make the perk practically useless and would take out the decisive part of decisive strike.
---
Little kids play this game too. 
---
Really? A gold player vs a high diamond player? That’s not a problem? Seems like you play against shitty diamonds then. 
---
It's called as a counter. Perks work that way. It forces the killer to play in a different way. 
---
:)
---
And make it so people can't DC anymore. Survivors will want to be sacrificed and there will be no more pallets or flashlights. In fact, the game will be rebranded as "Suvivor Sacrifice Sim" 
---
Or the killer can slug them and get at least 1 other survivors off gens while they chase another person so that’s 3 people not doing gens
---
I've already responded to all your points. So... I win? :D
---
There are counters to DS. Also if 2-3 gens pop like that, than don't chase your obsession right away. 
---
&gt;first time?
---
actually I’ve played as killer for around 30 games, but I’ve never really been BM’ed. As a survivor main, I get mad at teammates who go out of their way to BM. When they die, you know they lowkey had it coming. But like sometimes it’s funny if both the killer and survivors are messing around (I got into a really fun match today like that). I see what you mean about toxic survivors or even killers ruining the immersion. When they go out of their way to BM, it’s no fun. Just play the game.
---
For what you were saying about SWF.. first off, I’ve never tried SWF but isn’t the point of it to play with friends and have fun? Why do I see so many complaints over it, if my idea of it is correct? Does it have different rules than regular matches? 
---
I think you really are an idiot, 3800 and 4k are not gold and diamond respectively. 200 rating difference in ow is what the disparity is for your game here
---
I hate how their only argument afterwards is that youre a swf
---
So the current state is survivors can die?
---
Sure. But I hope it will only happen between Xbox and ps4 not pc as that would be simply not fair 
---
It’s not an intentional visual blocker but it won’t be changed because it does what it is intended to do.
---
LMFAO
---
What in the world is wrong with you lol? This isn't a complaining thread. I love it when I prestige. Losing your stuff is all apart of the fun, and the end result is reaching P3, which I've done and I feel accomplished.
---
It bugs me when I prestige because I never feel completed, and that's a personal thing, not me complaining whatsoever or me blaming it on the game. This subreddit surprises me sometimes.
---
If you would like to discuss the podcast, please do so in this parent comment! Thanks! &lt;4
---
^(\[Somebody sticky this, please?\])
---
Woah, wtf happened there?
---
Rarely killer but every third or so game there's a disconnect on my team
---
I think It'd be nice for it to be a little transparent but thanks for the answer m8
---
PS4 visual - when a survivor gets downed or hooked, the aura shows the survivor vertical or as opposed to in the downed state. 
---
As much as I love interdimensional physics, let's keep it out of DBD.
---
LF will be happy :) 
---
“I’m playing SWF with comms but these killers are trying too hard.” You are for real bringing something to the game that was not intended and then complain when a killer tries to play the game. Sometimes it’s necessary to camp or tunnel. There are cases in which these situations arise. 
---
Its been known. At least, Ive seen a lot people complain about it. Honestly Im not sure if its a broken matchmaking or the fact that no one is playing killer because 10fps
---
Yeah, we shouldn't condone making anymore killers in the same tier as Billy or Nurse, that's bad for the game and future DBD players.  
---
Can't wait until Last Year kills this game because of the dumbass playerbase and dumbass developers, it'll be a long time coming
---
Cant tunnel me if I don’t get hooked 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Aren't people who miss DS generally made fun-of?  
---
Explain plz
---
On pc you just click the chat button and it turns it off until you turn it back on. Idk how on console since I don’t own one.
---
When has this community ever fucking been intelligent on a large-scale, though?  I mean really?  It's second to LoL for worst fucking player-bases in gaming.
---
pretty sure they'd know if it's OoO. if it was Sole Survivor, then it was a meme build to fuck with the killer into thinking it's ds.
---
or it was just ds and imagine that not every game you want to deal with it. 
---
I personally don't mind the perk but some killer games I better ignore the ds player cause I just don't feel like eating it, okay? or I slug them again and again. it does not have an actual counter 100% to avoid it unlike noed so it's a bit frustrating when you had 4 swfs in a row on rank 1 where at least two people had ds. 
---
Wowee that some smol pp energy.
---
Hoooooo boi that game looks... REALLY fuckin bad lol
---
Or just make the game enjoyable so people don't have to resort to DCing and/or unranking to MAKE the game enjoyable for themselves.
---
I know it won't happen though. Game is too old and the mechanics are set in stone. Number tweaking won't do anything to fix the inherent problems.
---
Give it a moment. They'll come.. They always come.
---
It's the doctors ability. You start to see things that aren't there and you can't do actions like vaulting etc. when he is us my his power near you.
---
Its a doctor add on. Causes broken pallets to respawn as illusionary pallets
---
He didn’t use his electrical zap or anything, he was actually decently far away. ;/
---
There just aren't enough chests on the map to make it anything more than a worse self-care without a rework.
---
#rip ;(
---
Perhaps on a map like Coldwind or Macmillian.  On any other obscure totem-spawn map... doubtful
---
WHO??
---
Yea sure! I’m not playing again until tomorrow night but add me, my username is my psn
---
oh my gosh i literally just watched this episode 😂
---
With offerings and perks you can have a much greater likelihood of Kobe.
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
Except I made valid points yet your just blowing them other like the bloodhound and sloppy butcher combo and this post was mainly on about a perk not the killer so now your trying to say people don’t aren’t aloud their own free will to choose whatever they want
---
Well all my killers are p3 so
---
you didn't get the meme and situation, did you?
---
Not enough t-bagging, pallet looping, face camping and flashlight spamming. But I guess movies never really depict reality.
---
Note: Legion does not see your pulse if you already have a deep wound. He also needs to hit spmeone first. 
---
Got to love the doc and his addons
---
Best party ever
---
don't get me wrong, I love Keanu. when I was 14 I used to write him letters saying I'm tired and wanna cuddle.

but God damn the muscle in that dad!

" Increased repair hearing distance by 8 meters. Regressing generators will be highlighted by a white aura. Once regression stops, generators will be highlighted by a yellow aura for 8/12/16 seconds. "  
---
There was an "active at the start of the match" part, but it was a mess up. Gens aren't marked until you actually kick em. Now instead of it being you kick the gen and you have, at max, 16 seconds of knowing if the gen got touched within that time to, kick a gen, the aura turns white and as soon as it STOPS regressing, it turns yellow to say "Hey someone was here". If it doesn't get touched to stop regressing, it'll stay white the whole way to 0% progress.
---
Squirting isn't real, she's just peeing on you dude.
---
BMing is not a mind game, it's just toxic.  If you're that much better than the killer and can loop them easily, just do that.  There's no need to make them rage and/or feel like shit.
---
then stop whining about DS
---
Bitches be fuckin salty I guess
---
Absolutely destroyed a SWF group because they fucked themselves on the last 3 gens (trapper can be nightmare).  After I got my BBQ, I ended up letting them go.  The one non-SWF guy was like "get rekt camper".  Completely ignored him while I had a wonderful and civil discussion with the SWF group who realized the whole time I had let them go.
---
Yeah but when you get an early DC and they go tryhard it's pretty shitty for everyone.
---
Doctor has an add-on that makes fake pallets appear if you're crazy enough, I think like tier 1 or 2 insanity. However, fake pallets can only appear where a broken pallet is, so if you see a doctor break a pallet, and then that pallet is mysteriously back again later in the game, it's fake.
---
Oh no his pride was on the line I knew he wouldn’t dc lmao
---
**NSFW** [Source](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5b317a29af2d2)
---
You are over simplifying the point I was trying to make.  
---
You can't tell me that EVERYTHING survivors/killers do in this game is 100% strategic or practical.
---
Stopped reading at I was playing as Legion /s
---
Thanks for posting this. Love your summaries :)
---
Why should people stop complaining about the most broken OP perk in the game?
---
Then the Joe skin
---
I get this is sarcastic but why is this funny? Is there something wrong with playing legion?
---
Visual bugs like that happen to me sometimes, but instead it'll turn rocks or the gates blue and see through
---
My standard PS4 plays at like 17 FPS. My pc runs at 144 FPS but I don’t have any friends on there. :(
---
The hero 
---
Hey, I never said I was a dbd pro lol. I do play the game, I just haven’t had it for years and I don’t play it everyday. I’ve definitely played it enough to see different parts of it as well as it’s player-base. Anyone who plays a match or opens this Reddit can see how toxic the community is in terms of people that BM and how extreme killers respond to BM’ing. I understand if it’s frustrating, but that’s part of the game. It’s totally different if a survivor or killer goes **out of their way** to camp or flashlight.. but at the end of the day, it’s not that deep bro. It’s a game. 
---
Moonwalking would be completely pointless if the timer only starts outside of the terrorradius. 
---
Additionally if he uses frenzy with my idea of mixtape and gets a hit he completely loses is power gauge. 
---
And recharging it is slowed down aswell.
---
This [r/dbdgonewild/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbdgonewild/)
---
...okay I guess our definitions are different then. I'd say (SPOILER ALERT) building an underground base, training, then saying "happy Halloween, Michael" before fucking him up in fire was a flex.
---
Dwulk
---
So it’s actually useful now?
---
Right, didn't know the name and couldn't think of a better description. I know it now :P
---
Oh. Man.  
---
So Jake is the second to last person I need to get to level 40, and I hadn't realized they'd buffed this perk, and now I'm just rolling though games as *one stealthy boi!*
---
Yeah I stopped playing the last few nights until they fix the match making system. I waited the other night and set my timer and ended up waiting 43 mins for the killer only to dc. Set the timer again and an short 31 minute lobby allowed me to play.  
---
It's actually pretty common for it to be cleansed after gens are done because people think it's NOED
---
i would shit my pants if this happens to me haha
---
I agree that it needs changing. The notification is definitely great, but not at the expense of the fact that I cannot see the killer if I have direct line of sight on the hook (aka, they can be walking straight towards me and I won't be able to see them)
---
U forgot the 5th one: The killer does all the gens themselves
---
Figured the Surveillance thing was just a phrasing issue. 
---
Surprised the Legion change isn't going through. 
---
Mixed feelings on SC not getting changed, though. I run it a lot and would have enjoyed the buff. At the same time, though, not sure I'd have enjoyed it as much as Killer. Drawback of playing both sides, I suppose. However, I do like the idea it could be its own **new** perk as part of the base pool, because that means they're considering adding new non-teachables into the game, and I love that.
---
Yea he get a lot of blood points and also hunter because he can find people quite easily. Legion is now my go to man whenever there’s a 2x bp event
---
Oh man, look at that tunneler go!  
---
\*sarcasm\*
---
Yeah, I just got out of a match where one of the survivors’ connection had them teleporting five feet at a time and all four of them just ran into the corn field and did 360s while the game chugged.  Boy is it not a fun time.
---
In my opinion as a Killer main: in this situation teabagging was 100% fine and also hilarious 
---
Happens to me when I am Hagging around drawing triangles on the ground. 
---
I always play against the nicest Clowns so :)
---
It feels exactly the same as it always has. Where are you all getting this?

When a survivor runs to a loop, pre bottle it

---
The goal as a survivor is to get all 4 out. The goal as a killer is to kill all 4. 
---
Same, i get so many gross messages too
---
Nightclub map + rave Killer when?
---
I have really good internet and today i've been disconnected/game freezes like 4 times. I play overwatch and the game runs really smoothly so idk whats happening
---
I'm right there with you on PTB Selfcare. It's past time for a non teachable healing perk. It makes me wonder what other newer player friendly perks could be a thing.
---
Use colouraphobia and maybe something to make your terror radius bigger so survivors can't heal, maybe even throw in sloppy butcher, clown is a pretty good killer overall when you use his power correctly, he really shuts down loops and technically you can control where you want survivors to go if you throw the toxin (for example) to their left so they will go right maybe towards a hook? Maybe run iron grasp of you really need to but that's kinda a waste imo, I run bamboozle on a lot of killers but not really the clown since he slows people down anyway so why even use it
---
Survivor queue times are going up to 10 minutes. More if swf. Theres two/three threads on this every single day. 
---
Nah your good, this post turned into a killer circle jerk.
---
I still have an AutoHaven lisence plate on Dwight
---
i hope that didn't come off a mean, i meant to give off a more joking tone while saying what it was.
---
Yeah, experiencing the same. Just had a match with only 2 survivors loading and a couple hours ago I was the only one.
---
I play killer, but only sparingly due to work, and life. =/
---
But yes, the framerate does make me want to dropkick a baby sometimes.
---
Salt is powerful, it changes people...
---
Actually it’s every 25 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds but okay. 
---
Throw a bottle at a direction you don't want survivors to go to. Try to guess where they're going to run and cut off their running track. 
---
200% base move speed
---
Can vault pallets and windows faster than survivors
---
No recovery on missed or connected hits
---
Hits instantly down 
---
Can Mori all survivors without hooking first
---
I just do it to get to the next match so I can get hooked in the first minute and try and kobe to get to the next match so I can get hooked in the first minute and try and kobe to get to the next match so I can get hooked in the first minute and try and kobe.....
---
Thats not iron will......
---
Boy you couldn't be more wrong! People often don't know what is or isn't a slur. It's a colloquial piece of knowledge quite frequently. If you're skeptical of this, I encourage you to go down to Arkansas and start calling people rednecks. Some won't mind, some won't be letting you walk away.
---
In reality, most pejorative terms are localized and gradually spread because they're born from local culture. Many times people will take a national pejorative emerging over a territorial dispute and then go about asserting it's racial when it's not. Various phrases and insults tossed about are actually pejoratives to minor groups that ceased to be a represented group. 
---
Pike.
---
A fish? A spear? A Romanian caravan traveler? Who knows what the hell I mean, you silly monkey. That's racist if you're Filipino and I'm Chinese but in reality the phrase was born out of a territorial dispute because they're...both basically the same race until they have their own grievances from a nationalist kerfuffle. 
---
So, kraut, what do you think? These starting to sound familiar to you yet? No? Maybe you've got a Ruskie bug in your ear. You'll never know where them shifty commies (east Germans) will stuff ''em. Of course, there I go, tossing up red flags from every rock... whoa, actually that'd be suuuuper offense in certain cultures. Sorry, Tibet! I DIDN'T KNOW!
---
Slurs aren't universal. Language isn't universal. Words have definitions and meaning but they actually don't do anything unless you choose to process them and internalize them. You feel me, ShinShin?\^\^I made that one up for you just now. It means 'Bright Signal, Little Virtue'.
---
Also it was free for a while on ps4, so that player base is very healthy.
---
Ah. I've always had the sense that Xbox never really had a strong player base to begin with tbh
---
Clown is great at chases but suffers from poor map pressure. I run sloppy butcher and save the best for last to allow me to hit many survivors quickly, which keeps them off gens. At the beginning of the match I usually pick 4-5 gens that are reasonably close and defend that area or the map.  
---
Once you master how to use his bottle to counter loops, you can end chases quickly and move onto your next chases. Don’t throw the bottle directly at the pallet. Instead, you should throw it at the other side of the loop so that the survivor will become intoxicated and cannot complete the loop without getting hit.
---
It's only cause the community is literally split between him, half think he's somewhat decent the other think he's complete dog shit, it's mostly survivor mains complaining about him being op were he's really weak at higher ranks, against rank 20 foreheads he's done but rank 5 throughout you literally can't play him. The other half is killer mains complaining he's to weak at the higher ranks and just shit in general. I personally like playing him and I played him till rank 4 but had to switch it up after a while
---
Yes! Great in one on one chases but cant keep good pressure. You just have use him alot to get used to it and make each chase quick and count.
---
Survivor taking skill lmao (see how that works)
---
gross ace main dwights unite
---
You're pathetic.
---
He works like Freddy. You're meant to tag multiple people with the power, but they're better tunneling one survivor into the fucking ground.
---
But Freddy doesn't ignore pallets and vault windows as fast as you. Legion is brainless to play. Now you may say "but Nurse also ignores pallets and windows."
---
See, Nurse takes time to master. She is based on complete muscle memory. I know that when someone is good at Nurse, they took time to memorize how she works. But Legion can just be picked up and you could annoy the shit outta someone.
---
While I don't mean to down play him, Jrrizzo did [this](https://twitter.com/JrrizzoYT/status/1083695174218334209) at rank one on console. He's been playing for 2-3 fucking weeks and he's got a 4k because people just give up. Legion is just that unfun to play against that I'll just accept death. Better to play a different game and actually have fun with it.
---
tl;dr: legion isn't fun, pls fix.
---
"you ruined someone's experience blah blah blah"
---
I guarantee when you're playing either killer or survivor you aren't going "Ohh I hope they're having fun. Am I being fun for them. Hope I'm not..."
---
Yeah, when you play you're playing for yourself, not others. So stop trying to bring this shitty morals crap into something where it's not that you care that it happened to someone it's that you care it could happen to you.
---
I hate the way that NOED makes me actually run for exits to escape the unstoppable murder machine instead of staying to taunt/troll/farm for points. 
---
Takes me RIGHT out of any game of Teabag at the Exit I play!...that IS the title of this game, right?
---
this is your answer. you don't play much. you don't know how it feels when you put time and effort in the game and these things happen. I've been playing Lineage 2 for 5 years straight, it would never make me so mad. other MMOs either. other videogames overall. I'd never get frustrated over a game. Remember first time visiting Reddit and seeing all this. I didn't play much that time. I thought to myself: these guys need some milk! couldn't understand wtf is wrong, why they all so mad. couldn't understand people losing their minds in game. I'd just shrug and continue with my business. 
---
but then I decided I want to get better with the game. you know, not like god tier, just actually rank up and play it not just casually couple times a week. so I did. and now I'm often mad, frustrated, bitching on Reddit a lot. 
---
and honestly, lots of people assume here there's something wrong in my life since I take things seriously but my actual life apart from game has never been better. they would be right just a year ago though but I didn't play and didn't use Reddit back then. 
---
also camping≠t-bagging
---
nodding at hook/hitting someone on it=t-bagging
---
Strategies like that are why people don't like Legion. He can abuse the game mechanics to make it so there is no way to counter him. Hop in a locker to try not to get fucked when you inevitably go down? Well you're just gunna plop right out.
---
A lot of people I’ve seen aren’t focused on whether or not he’s good. They’re focused on his power and how it’s quite bs
---
"BUTTLICKER, OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER!"
---
While I agree with everything you said, this is why I’ve sent emails to the developers asking for a different game mode. One where people’s intent in this mode is to use their best builds and teams to play in a more competitive scenario. This does two things: it gives people who play for fun/to win a place and it stops most of this useless banter. 
---
Guy face camped like a punk, somebody was toxic, but not the survivors
---
Longest I usually wait is a minute or two although the connection isn't the best more often than I'd like to admit 
---
Just👏a👏little👏bit

Us killers gotta stay strong, though I don’t dare go into red ranks

Different modes are definitely worth looking into, but I don't think it would fully fix everything. Trolls will be trolls, you know? But at the very least, the people clamoring for serious competition would be able to get it. Lord knows what the queues would be, but they'd be there.
---
I'd happily give up my noed and moris if they take adrenaline and keys with em.
---
No ruin or Jigsaw map offering? Genrush/10. If you really wanna lay on the pain in the ass build I would reccomend distressing, caulrophobia, unnerving, and huntress lullabye. Put this along with a jigsaw piece and two calm addons and it will be impossible to lose that game. 
---
amen. 
---
I don't care how strong or weak they are. I just hate that they don't require skill(therefore as killer main I feel injustice cause we all dealt with downfalls to get ranks, to get kills, to get bp, we had to master our powers and be clever at using perks to help us in chase. as survivor I'm not the best but I know what to do and I am rank 1. and I hate that it renders my best skill as survivor - break the chase and hide - completely useless).
---
 like I put time and effort in my characters and skills. I hate it that I can't outplay Legion who as any other killer wouldn't touch my foot cause the player doesn't know how to properly play and just relies on add-ons and perks. 
---
and the games are just boring against them. not only I'm not recognizing a killer in these teenagers, also it's just frustrating and long. doesn't matter if they're good or bad at what they do.
---

---
It would make the troll arguments become based on balancing perks. I think tell people how to have fun overall is the most major problem. 
---
I am a pig main as well. I have over 2k hours with just her and only her. I've only recently started playing other killers. I'm saying right to left because she starts her attack by extending her arm outwards away from her body and quickly brings it back towards her chest. The hit box doesn't engage until she's bringing the blade back towards her chest. Her blade is on her right arm. At the end of the day its semantics but the general principle of turning a straight lunge into an aoe attack is the same so were on the same page there. 
---
Okay and I will rebuttal that with, imo at least.. there's nothing wrong with the power and the vault, I like the power, I think it only works well when you attack multiple survivors instead of just one, one his frenzy is over yet turns into a regular killer again and (up until his recent buff) he has to wait until it fully drains and resets to actually do anything good, so what he can vault? I think it's a cool mechanic that he can only do a couple times per frenzy, but then another question I think about is why is legion getting the back lash for the "tunneling" argument? Every killer can tunnel? Just cause he tunnels you while you the mend bar doesn't even deplete? All killers can tunnel you. Its almost a good comparison to spirit, he can't see the scratch marks during frenzy like she can't, he can vault, she can pull you off a gen without difficulty, I think people will learn to play against him in time, a survivor taking 10 (maybe more) seconds to mend when you escape the chase isn't a problem. My only thing is that moonwalking with the mend bar depleting isn't fair at all, idk how you'd change it but it's not Fair to the survivors, but on the other hand just escape the chase like you do with every other killer
---
You also have yet to produce 6.3 litres of water from an empy jar, _in a crowd of thirsty iguanas_
---
Okay, real talk:
---
Legion is new, so a lot of people who survivor main don't REALLY get how they work yet. They're also the new tunnel champ, and a BP grinder. (Doc is still real good for this at high level.)
---
You are basically guaranteed to R1 as Legion for the next 2 weeks, so, honestly, good on you for doing it while it's hot.
---
You aren't in the wrong for playing a character in the game, promise. Grats on R1, man.
---
I love the killers that give me a thrill without being way stronger than me like Myers, huntress, the trapper 
---
I mean, you could make it guarantee that the medkit has a charges addon, which would ensure two or more regular speed heals, would go well with loot builds, and makes it useful for helping teammates, but still is the core perk. Let's be real, people only use it with loot builds, so why not just make it a little better for everyone?
---
It’s a legit strat if want minimal bloodpoints 🙄
---
It probably means it can stack with perks that increase blood points and such.
---
I don't even know what your talking about at this point. 😂
---
Yes.  I'm stupid for not taking things at face value. s/
---
I usually throw it around the rotation point. In other words, as far away from the pallet as possible. The placement doesn’t have to be exact and can vary based on the loop. The important thing is to force the survivor to run through the gas and hit them before they can get through the pallet. 
---
I read somewhere agitation gets you further then iron grasp would.
---
Hex: Opinion Discarded
---
They have not. They said in the Dev stream that they are aware of it and working on it, though.
---
Somebody once suggested that all totems spawn dull at the beginning and after 1 minute get assigned. That way the killer gets at least a guaranteed 1 minute with his perk power and time to set up. I think that would be a decent idea. 
---
I also liked the idea that the killer can walk up to a totem and burn it once a game forcing the totem to be reassigned to another dull totem. Then if it’s discovered or is a bad spawn he can reroll the dice on it. 
---
Both work and add I think more depth to the totem mechanic of this game. 
---
Over-altruism, disconnect rates, unfamiliarity.
---
Same as most.
---
To be fair, when I first started I had no idea it was as low as it was (4%). Had I known that, I wouldn't have tried it so much.
---
I think it would get you to the hook faster, the iron grasp would get you further, I think I could be wrong 
---
holy fuck. will you all start reading??
---
you can't do that as any other killer. even as Nurse you can't do it as efficient.
---
BBQ was created after Billy and Nurse. if any of these killers would be added last or this year, changes to BBQ would be made with that. of course you all got used to it. you just take it as it is. but you saying BBQ isn't broken on Billy or Nurse means you play one of those and enjoy the perk that is way too powerful on them.
---
any other killer can only use it to pinpoint the location of survivors since they still need time to get there but these two just rush to the spot. 
---
I'm done with this conversation. you all keep on saying I have some made-up rules while at the very beginning I said that these things make the game frustrating and that's why community is so salty and toxic. you all seriously proceeded assuming I say killers or survivors gotta do something while I literally only said the certain things they do are frustrating and spread hate. holy fukin shit, people, learn how to read, please. most things I voiced are not even my opinion but just things I see being discussed every day on here and in game. 
---
It was mindgaming a mindgame. A lot of people would expect the survivor to jump during the blind, so the killer would swing in hopes of a grab. Claudette expected that and waited, but so did the killer. 
---
WHO IS THE REAL MINDGAMER NOW, BITCH?
---
People are talking about Surveillance.  What people aren't thinking of is Pink Rag Hag with it now.
---
Put your traps close to gens.  You see the gen go from white to yellow?  Teleport to it and attempt a grab or get a hit.  No depending on a survivor messing up a crouch walk, or anything.  Just port and you are a go.
---
This just seems like a shitty hag. I think the legion already has that sort of effect that makes you think there are multiple killers running around. Once somebody is hit you normally think that you are safe to work on a generator, but with the legion you have to worry about some deranged sprinting maniac rushing you down almost like there are multiple people on the map.
---
You don't reduce the toxicity in our community by being toxic in return to something toxic done to you.
---
The point is what’s fun for you is not fun for others. Some people play to win and then casual players get mad at them. 
---
As a rank one killer, you are the easiest survivors. The worst is when I chase someone off a gen, get a hit... and when I think I'm in another chase wasting time...  the injured survivors are doing more gens. Hate when 3 gens are done before I can even check them all.
---
Yes do it! I came from PS4 and the difference is night and day. FYI if you thought you were great at this game on PS4 youre in for a surprise. It’s so easy to 360 on PS4 due to bad frame rates on pc I can only manage to 360 a killer by corn. 
---
It was tough starting all over but starting fresh was nice since I knew which characters/perks I want to unlock and which survivors I want to prestige. 
---
Haven't encountered it myself as Survivor (thank God) but for funsies the other day I ran Hag with Ruin, Devour Hope, Third Seal, and Thrill of the Hunt (would have used Lullaby in place of Third Seal if I had it) along with Mint Rag and Rusty Shackles. It, uh... I don't think "blood bath" quite captures how that game went.
---
I was playing Billy the other day, zooming across the map and looking for the last survivor. Pulled a tight turn, then **SPLAT** right into a Meg
---
About jumped out of my damned skin
---
If you're the random on my team and you've done everything possible to sandbag me and my friends I'm going to farm you on your 1st hook and then sit by the killer and share some popcorn while we watch you die together. 
---
Let me clear that you could have straight up face camped that Bill and they could all deal with it. That was your best move at that time given the situation. 
---
There's a weird thing where survivors want you to let them go or give them the hatch -and if you feel like doing that, go for it - but it is not a given. Until they run through those gates, it's your job as killer to kill them. If you never tried to kill them, there would be no game.
---
Teabagging is a part of the game too then 
---
Why she don't fail skillcheck and jump in the hatch?
---
It boils down to being unfun for both sides.
---
Survivors say he's "too strong" because once in a chase you're basically guaranteed downed unless they really suck, a good chaser downs you quickly, a bad one just needs to keep track of you until you bleed out.
---
Killers say he's "too weak" because while the chase is an inevitable down, it takes SO LONG to down someone without moonwalking cheese. If you use the power with all its intended mechanics you have to stun yourself and recover power SO MANY TIMES it just isn't fun to do. Then if you're efficient you're barely playing the game, just walking staring at blood on the ground avoiding initiating a chase.
---
Trying to make their chase a unique mechanic has made them so hard to balance. You can't patch it so that the deep wounds is proximity based like people want because then you HAVE to use their power or chase at 110 which is basically just saying "yes, I'd like to play this killer that doesn't get a first kill until the other 3 are already in an open exit gate," but you can't patch their power to down much more efficiently because they're still fucking inescapable so it'd just be instant 4ks.
---
Legion is just broken from the ground up, not overpowered or underpowered, just an attempt to be SO unique that they've gone too far from the basics of the game to fit into it properly.
---
I mean sprinting away can be te right thing but not always and i notice people tend to sprint for too long (right to the corner they wabt to selfcare etc etc) also teammate farmibg without borrowed time sucks but if it means preventing hitting second phase its worth it i suppose 
---
I got that same luck yesterday. First match farm map, thought I was just unlucky. Then got an offering for red forest, then 3 matches in a row got farm maps (exact same one mind you), then autohaven, then another farm map.
---
Idk but that rng is looking kinda sus to me. /s
---
I've definitely noticed more wait as Survivor, but I'm still getting a game in like, 3-4 minutes most night. Playing during peak hours is still instantaneous.
---
Alright if I ever go against a Hag Im cleansing all the dull totems 😅
---
But have you watched this vid by Space Coconut: https://youtu.be/4OiP2gVja_s
---
Its very informative imo and might help you out
---
I dig it!
---
Tuft of Hair Myers with Enduring + Spirit Fury. There is literally nothing you can do to get away
---
Also had a Doc running Agitation + Iron Grasp + Mad Grit on the car's map where the basement is at the middle, there was no way to avoid getting hooked there 
---
This was a really good explanation of it all, I really like that you displayed both sides of the field, nice debating with somebody that can think critically instead of just throwing hate
---
Whilst I understand the sentiment of doing anything to win and believe me - I do, the majority of "toxic"players I've come across have done those things for no reason. 
---
Everybody and their dog knows t-bagging, emoting and flashlighting are seen as toxic. So when survivors do those things for no reason, or a killer hooks one survivor at the start and decides to just camp them all game, it's gonna make people mad.
---
Lol I think I faced you about an hour ago maybe. Blue Hag on Rotten Fields
---
Yes we are all familiar with Nea mains
---
When you bring streamers and have 4 stacks on We're Gonna Live Forever 
---
I am sure the devs will fix it like they fixed the bugged new map instead of letting it hit live and having to take it out of rotation until it wasn't bugged
---
Oh wait...
---
Killers are quitting on both platforms, as of late. 
---
As a Killer or Survivor, if they're going to camp it for more than 5 minutes, as Killer I would just let them have it. Not even worth waiting longer than that.
---
As a Survivor I just start doing generators if they want to camp the hatch so bad. 
---
Hatch standoffs are annoying, but in the end it is entirely your choice how long you are willing to wait for it.
---
The problem with the killer closing the hatch idea is that it will lead to survivors crouching/hiding once the hatch is closed instead of actually doing gens. This happens all the time when 4 or 5 gens are left in a 1v1 as well.
---
Whatever solution they implement, the endgame must be quick. 1v1s are not enjoyable and searching for an immersed survivor who is doing nothing but hide is frustrating. 
---
You should be stuck in red ranks once you get there.
---
On most fronts except the tbagging part. I just further clarified what you were getting at since it's only specifics that people (apart from extremely salty people) complain about. 
---
You ignorant slut. 
---
Apparently iron grasp only gets you an extra 3 seconds for the wiggle timer.
---
I guess it depends on the killer, if it's nurse agitation would be better due to her movement speed.
---
I also found this on a steam discussion board, not sure if the maths holds up or not but:
---
3.68 m/s x 16 s = 58.8 meters, default carrying capability of all 4.6 m/s Killers.
---
4.34 m/s (AG 3) x 16 s = 69.44 meters.
---
3.68 m/s x (16 x 1.12) s = 3.68 m/s x 17.92 = 66 meters
---
I have no idea how this was worked out and for all I know it could be completely made up.
---
I play on Xbox and I’ve never had difficulties getting games, weird.
---

---
I’m waiting personally for nurse since I’m dead curious.
---
How tf do they wake up then?
---
I wish all killers had this mentality 
---
Same though, the singular time I have ever purposely camped was during the summer BBQ event. This dude kept 99% sabotaging the event hooks and then breaking them in front of my face... as the other survivors were visibly not struggling and letting me get them because they had seen that I was waiting to let them get the event gens. I was gonna let everyone go after I got all my event hooks, but that guy didn’t get to leave because of that. I got a message from him basically saying I was a bad killer who couldn’t get a kill without camping and I was just like you do realize I was literally just trying to farm for the event right? He then proceeded to cuss me out and call me a liar ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I fucking hate waiting that long just for the killer or two survivors to dc in the loading screen 🤬
---
I’ll do it for you TL:DR; let killers close the hatch to even out the game. The survivors would only have themselves to blame.
---
It's hard but not impossible if you play a good killer and get a little sweaty.
---
Please don't derank. 
---
I think it would be really cool for killers to customize their basements like they do the outfits.
---
Maybe depend on skill and stealth instead of being a pretentious prick like the devs intended?
---
A Legion does not have to walk backwards for that to work.  Literally he just has to look down and follow the blood trails without re-initiating the chase.  Take Monto's usage of it for [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qur3lpJw5_E).
---
Killers dribble and DS is useless. Which should not be a thing. So fuck off. 
---
PSA for dumbasses on both sides: *Every* perk is a crutch perk.
---
I’ve never touched a game as killer but I agree lmao. Can’t flame you for doing your job, the game wouldn’t be a thing if we didn’t you killers !!!
---
Survivors cant dribble noed 
---
Ya know, to be honest, I wasn't expecting that. And I loved it even more-so because of it.
---
Just take spine chill. It let's you kill yourself on the hook 9% faster. /s

Legion is unsatisfying because it isn't earned. A survivor can't escape legion if they choose to down them. None of the standard survivor techniques to gain distance work except for a pallet stun and.. well, you run out of those very quickly. The problem is that means that for most killer players, dowinng someone like that is jsut unsatisfying. And for the survivors it is worse because it feels like you are getting beaten even though you didn't do anything wrong. With every other killer there is a moment during the chase you can point to and say you did the wrong thing, and that is why you got caught. You don't have that with legion. it is just you got unlucky and were the one who has to pay the hook tax this time.
---
flair checks out
---
Sometimes the game simply won't load on both my computers even after letting it hang. Infact sometimes I'll get in and the other pc doesn't.
---
It's real frustrating when people rage quit too, this is a lot of things that make it go wrong and it's just a result of bugs, no DC penalties, no dedicated servers, etc. 
---
I'm a HybridPanda man myself.
---
superb editing 
---
I actually really like this concept but I think Hook, Line and sinker should only cover one of the two effects. 
---
Getting Aura Reading outside of the Terrorradius while the survivor gets exposed once he stops opening seems just kinda too much imo.  
---
It tells you that and then immediately says it's a fools task or something if my memory is right.
---
Eh, I'd say it depends on the state of the game.
---
Face camping in the early game is just the killer being a douche.
---
Face camping in the mid game is the killer admitting defeat.
---
Face camping when the exit is powered and he's already sacrificed two people is just the killer deciding to take the safe kill rather than try for the 4k. Nothing wrong with that, and you can't really say he's "ruining someone else's fun" when the game is already over.
---

I've gotten this bug before. It sucks, but hey, at least it doesn't make a squirting noise or something...
---
Feng Min is bae. Feng Min is life. 
---
I mean if you get all of them in that time frame you probably bought a bit of time.
---
When the obsession has DS but you don't care because you have STBFL.
---
&gt;BBQ was created after Billy and Nurse. if any of these killers would be added last or this year, changes to BBQ would be made with that
---
That literally makes zero sense.
---
They'd alter BBQ if Billy and Nurse was added after BBQ?
---
The fuck stopped them from tweaking BBQ for Billy and Nurse when they already existed in the game.
---
You're literally making no sense.
---
&gt;any other killer can only use it to pinpoint the location of survivors since they still need time to get there but these two just rush to the spot
---
You're forgetting Spirit. And I main Huntress so a lot of the time I can literally turn around and map someone without moving.
---
Nice word diarrhea, man.
---
Okay. Thank you so much! Killers still DC, but it's better than being in limbo for a half hour
---
Yeah you're actually a fucking idiot Jesus christ
---
Nah, M1 simulator is already boring enough. 
---
First tip: there are no rules to how to play killer. Tunnel, camp, and slug if it works. Your goal is to kill them in any way you can.
---
Second tip: some survivors will be salty no matter what if they lose. They'll call you a camper if you *exist* on the map at the same time they're unhooked lol. Just laugh it off.
---
What you're describing sounds fine. You didn't tunnel or camp or anything. And even if you did, hey, it works, right? XD
---
Freddy dropped his paintbrush add-on, so NATURALLY Nea had to go ham with it.
---
What's wrong with someone feeling proud? Good job man.
---
Probably a reason why you get those, don't you think?
---
Great accomplishment. I'm working on getting there myself. 
---
Usually for me, it isn't the framerate that makes me whiff, it would be auto lock controlling my lunge when I don't want it to.
---
That's true-ish. What you are saying is true, it can be saltier, but it's a different kind of salt. I have not played DotA nearly as much as LoL but for what I've played in that kind of game you get shitted on MASSIVELY by your teammates. I have almost 400 hours on Dbd and I still haven't gotten as much teammate toxicity as in one bad LoL ranked. I know it is thanks to the fact that I can just leave as soon as they can even blame me for everything but still that illusion makes me not get pissed off every single fucking match by letting me do that, ignore them, meanwhile in LoL if I mute them I can't be guessing their next move all the time to compensate and I just get more pissed off. Then again it could be all because I have already played ten billion hours of LoL and i'm just burnt out but I see it that way.
---
Essay finished.
---
Hey, in theory, longer gens means more time for the killer to find people and chase people so less M1 simulator so long as you're not a gen jockey lol
---
And what killer do you play? and do you just camp and tunnel right off the hook?
---
the Spirit does not see auras as soon as she starts phasing. also, while phasing, she doesn't see people. you can literally be standing still and she won't see you using her power. Spirit is my second main and BBQ with her is not broken. you can be, however, using the add-ons to make your phasing longer/faster which gives you a certain advantage but seeing someone outside the BBQ range, man, you don't have enough charge to get there. you can use the Mother-Daughter Ring but that means whole game you won't see even scratch marks.
---
Spirit is the most balanced killer in the game, strong but counterable, loopable and outmindgameable and there's nothing too op with her.  
---
to Huntress and her hatchets - only noobs get hit by BBQ hatchets. literally just look in the sky and get behind a wall, big stone, any tall obstacle ffs. 
---
Funny enough they said I shouldn't do that. Because of what I had done, it shows that I don't have a basic understanding of the game's mechanics. Needless to say, I was confused...
---
Ew ace is best boy 
---
I think so

Pretty sure it's a bug in the PTB right now.

Can't hatch standoff, can't prevent survivors from leaving, can prevent almost done gens.
---
Good idea
---
I don't camp or tunnel, I play most of the killers but my P3's are Billy, spirit, and Myers. I want to get wraith my next P3
---
wut lol I cleanse cause I love bp and that's how I do good points on survivor and can never bitch about amount on this side cause everything is in your hands. you have all the place and time to get good bp on any side. yes, killers get more cause they spend more. most of our add-ons and offerings are useless and we rarely go in match empty-handed as in without add-ons therefore always after a killer match don't forget to -10-12k you waste on add-ons. I go to a match as survivor without anything, bring back 15-20k + item. and it's without WGFF. with it at least 30 pure k of bloodpoints. not wasting *anything*. 
---
&gt;waste time doing totems
---
lol k. get hit by noed or camping/tunneling killer cause they will tunnel and proxy-camp when no one is dead and 2 or more gens done. and then complain how little bp you got cause you didn't take time to do other objectives.
---
I'll let you know that if you don't do killer objectives and just being efficient by tunneling injured survivors you don't get over 23-25k points. and usually even less especially as Nurse since you never bother breaking pallets. 
---
Thanks! I had a great time making this, and I'm glad you enjoyed it. 
---
Yeah, Desecrated Badge is suppose to take affect when full wetness is reach. I prob need to reword it.
---
Basically a content creator known as jen intentially de-ranks herself. A few other Content creators had a problem with this because JEn is a fog whisperer which is kind of like an offical content creator Under BHVR's name. These creators think that De-ranking hurts the community (so do i) and think that a person who's basically the face of BHVR's community shouldent be doing it and not get punished.
---
I totally agree but every killer runs noed too
---
Maybe I just don’t suck as killer but I just play and if they use DS I just down them again and continue to play the game. Usually killers who dribble are not very good to begin with and need to use perks like NOED as a crutch as well. Makes the game less fun for everyone if you make it impossible to lose. 
---
Reminds me of the time i was creeping through the cornfield as a low terror radius Doctor and a random Nea comes out of nowhere and runs right into me face first, made me scream so loud omg. Im almost sure we scared each other on accident lol
---
Literally every killer uses noed unless its their first time on a killer so like bruh YOU KNOW IM FINNA CLEANSE ALL THE TOTEMS I CAN
---
Thanks a bunch! A lot of respect for your dedication. I'm sure everybody understands that you have other important stuff going on, so no worries.
---
No improvement whatsoever
---
Do they not give a crap about losing revenue from console users or is it seriously too much work to fix what’s broken &gt;_&gt;
---
See my latest post
---
My baby! 😍
---
Dwighty Dwighty Doo! Where are you? We've got some gens to do now!
---
Why people call that facecamping I don't know.
---
It's just camping.
---
I'm guessing most of the people here are new and never suffered the real facecamping. The camping that wouldn't allow other survivors to unhook you... literally.
---
I wish we could get a Bear as a killer
---
Ruin is not necessary. Just accept that you can't win every game, and some killers are harder than others.
---
Lmfao 
---
Because he’s too easy or too hard?
---
Doesn't it on the PTR though?
---
It was worth staying up till 5am to watch the stream and kill myself during the day xd
---
I actually don't think NOED is as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It has literally no bearing on the game until the very end, and you can cleanse the totems. Sure, if you're gen rushing and not doing totems, it can be annoying to fight, but personally, in higher tiers, I'd say Ruin is more annoying to fight. 
---
No I just wanna DC
---
And the zenos would like to have a word with you
---
That sucks about the bug.

What I do in a real situation of game being held hostage though, as Hag, is put traps around the outside of the map and in places the survivor doesn't expect. If they have urban evasion, it doesn't matter, but in my experience, they feel safe on the outskirts of the map so they don't always use it. 
---
(This is why I love Doctor. No hiding from him. Even if you go in locker, I'll find you eventually lol)
---
What a poet!
---
Using pallets and circling the killer to avoid getting hit is being a pretentious prick now? What else are survs supposed to do? And stealth is no fun whatsoever. The only fun part of the game is chases, from both killer and surv perspective. So, if the devs didn't intend it, why put in pallets? Why make survs 3rd person with free camera?
---
Okay then, what about slugging until they're near a hook? I've been on the receiving end of slugging when I'm the obsession and don't even have DS. Then in the end game chat it's 'oh well I thought you had DS' or 'I don't like DS users'. Also going down near a hook is more common than you think. 
---
Oh I agree, the lack of transparency was a huge fuck up on their part, and they didn't handle it very well when they got called out (optimization PASS.) It shows they wanted to get it to us as soon as possible though, even if it just couldn't happen in time. I'm looking forward to being able to play fast killers without throwing up
---
Have you tried cleansing totems. And before you say "it's so hard playing solo" Then don't play solo, SWF are at a clear advantage. So he problem sin't solo the problem is you choosing to play it over SWF.
---
And i mostly don't have totem perks in.
---
Even without the Pig crouching up to you and lunging, her tools still manage to jump scare you lol
---
No. Looping is being a prick. And stealth is much more useful than you’d imagine.
---
Even as a killer main I think it’s unfair. The recent healing nerf did enough. Punishing others for running SC is too much. 
---
I wish there was one answer, but different players have different defninitions. You'll hear the joke 'if you are in the same game as a hooked survivor, you are a camper' a lot here, because killer cop hell for no good reason.
---
If you 'face camp' sure, if you never really leave the immidiate area, okay thats camping. But if you go away a little and come back to check? No, not camping. Are your hooks next to all your gens? Stay, no reason to leave. Gates open? At that point survivors genuineley want a free win.
---
Tunneling is almost never an actual thing, are you injured? Did the killer pick you over a free kill or were you honestly the easier target. Survivors will complain about tunneling when they lose, or oddly when their team fucks up and somehow thats your fault.
---
[I guess Android has just fucked you](https://imgur.com/a/MJkmMKs)
---
Clease 'em all just to prevent NoED lul
---
Of course you do, but you can't seriously say there isn't still a very noticeable skillgap between someone who is legitimately rank 20-15 and someone who is rank 5-1.
---
Because people who get slugged like that often DC and end up giving the last guy the hatch.
---
Me, a wee Pig, in the corner praying they don't find my ruin
---
I don't use it, but from what people are saying I guess like, 95% of everyone else does.
---
no
---
*someone rescued right next to me* *down them again * OMG why you tunnel!?
---
r/ihadastroke
---
100% this
---
well my normal on killer is 27k. but for this and more i use add-ons cause otherwise i won't have enough time to do killer objectives. and that means my 27k - 10 = 17k 
---
but counting further, leveling killers for these good add-ons i have to invest a shitton of bp. which i earn with BBQ so no complaints here. after getting all perks, you're still running out of add-ons sooner or later so you're stuck with 3 green add-ons you use left and over 200 brown ones with which you might as well go perkless cause they mostly don't do shit. 
---
with survivor you get perks and that's about it. you don't have to bring items, ever. you will run out of offerings, sure, but so as killer so we exclude this one. 
---
i don't invest in my survivors much after i got all stuff on Feng Min(since survivors are just skins) and i don't suffer by going in a match without offering or without an item cause i can always search a chest if i want one. and as i said, without everything i get average of 15-16k per match without wasting any points as survivor. and bringing back an item. so, you know, the average difference between my survivor and killer(both rank 1) is 2-1k bp. while on survivor i don't need anything but perks and i waste a shitton of bp to find the add-ons for killers. and don't get me started how long i have to wait for killer lobby. cause it's long enough for me to give up and go play survivor. i don't even have a courtesy to dodge a very fishy-looking swf party meaning the game will most likely be frustrating and i might not get all stacks. or kills at this point and leave the game with 18k bp + like 9 from BBQ, upset and nervous wishing i didn't wait for 15 minutes to get a lobby and just played 2(or more if one ended too fast with me dying) survivor games already and got a bunch of bp and fun. 
---
Maybe it has i guess. Now that I'm reading back my com my bad for the attitude. Lol i guess I'm salty rn cause i haven't had a decent game of dbd since last month :(
---
or how about being absolutely ascended and not chasing your obsession in the first place since you know you're not gonna get  a hook out of it
---
Insidious hardly seems worth it to be honest as you need to stand still for a little while for it to trigger and the Terror Radius drop isn't instant like it used to be.
---
Tbh took me a while to realise. 
---
Yes
---
If you keep an eye on the person that went down first you'd have no problem. Or if you don't want to risk making a mistake (somehow) then you just slam the Gens because you know the Killer is lying down on the ground putting absolutely no pressure on anyone.
---
It bugs me when the swing animation seems to be over and then I get hit.
---
very nice with insults. mind explaining why i'm dumb?
---
Shitty design if it's fun for one side.
---
Freddy is shitty design because he's not fun to play as or against.
---
Legion is fun to play as if you play him how you should, but you'll just get fucked. I don't find him fun cheesing how chase works (and Frank's Mixtape is the most unfun piece of garbage.)
---
Legion and Freddy have the same "design" around their power. Both meant to tag multiple people, but doing that will just get you fucked. They're better tunneling one person, but Legion at least ignores pallets and basically ignores windows.
---
Omg that happens to me almost every other game!
---
It's a legit strategy in specific situations. Facecamping the first guy you hook for no reason like the killer did is just being an asshole
---
Every person who plays this games uses a crutch. Killer, survivor, everyone. That’s why this game is toxic as fuck. 
---
The lore and character design is an A+, but as a playable character, their design is fucking horrible.
---
or how about getting good at the game and eating that DS like a killer that can actually catch someone instead of whining about a 1 time use perk that only gives them half an extra life because they're still injured, unlike noed which can be used on every survivor several times and gives you twice the damage
---
Ah i played with you a couple times yesterday as nea. Was wondering what you werr doing with this build lol  :D
---
Legion is meant to spread the pain but they are more eFFicient at focusing on a single target. Once you're chasing someone, unless you're braindead, they have no chance of losing you.
---
Then there is also the people that cheese the chase mechanics leaving you with almost no counter play outside of running No Mither.
---
nope because ds is op because i got ds'd once and i disconnected and started crying
---
Bloodhound is more than enough by itself.
---
What a wonderful game that was :)
---
The right thing.
---
Survivors live in the same building, and chasing each other through the fog is like a 9 to 5 job for them, and they're mostly friendly or amicable with each other after the job. Nurse patches everyone up best as she can between the matches - which is to say not particularly, given that neither has much time for healing besides slapping on a bandage and kissing the boo-boo away. Doctor deals with emotional trauma and generally tries to fix everyone's issues - like Feng's videogame addiction, Leatherface's mental disabilities (he actually got much better and Laurie teaches him how to read and write in her spare time), and Billy's rage issues, Legion and Nea hang out in ♣-╣(Entity's not good with numbers) and get up to mischievous pranks, but nothing malicious. Aside from that one time they accidentally broke Billy's chainsaw and it whipped him across the face, but they apologized profusely. The only killer who doesn't interact with others much is Freddy, because he's a nice guy neckbeard and he creeps everyone out.
---
omg I'm so sorry you had to go through that you're right DS needs to be removed from the game also buff noed
---
PFFFT. I saw a Myers with Ebony Mori, Judith's Tombstone AND Fragnant Tuft of Hair. He LOST. I was playing with my two other friends and we kind of bullied the poor guy lul, as long as I remember he dc-d.
---
Up to you to derank but a lot of killers just aren't playing right now, me included. Framerate, sound bugs, broken scratch marks, and overall garbage performance makes red ranks absolute hell to play.
---
yep we need to buff noed, a survivor cleansed my noed and i started crying because it was too traumatic (they tbagged me and i disconnected)
---
Killer has every right to always slug you*
---
I personaly hate playing against DS, but camping someone for using it... really? Why throw the game for a single perk? Just make they guy running it enjoy the floor for 10 minutes
---
I just thought of a GREAT idea. We should just remove crouching completely so they can't teabag anymore! Also make it so that if the survivors don't escape from the exits within a certain time (2 seconds) then they instantly die with no bloodpoints. 
---
110% movement speed is downright painful in chases and not using his power would be stupid. Ever tried exclusively normal attacking as huntress or hag? Same thing. Also Pig's power is stealth mixed with a burst of speed instead of a giant middle finger with a knife that doesn't kill people.
---
If you aren't going against decent survivors then eating the DS is no problem. If they are then it's an extra life for each DS that goes off. Unless you are nurse a DS results in a lot of time wasted, time the other survivors, if they are even somewhat, are using to do objectives. Dribbling in no way makes it impossible to lose. At best it just makes it take longer to get them to a hook if they have DS and no real use otherwise.
---
*even somewhat decent
---
it's nice you're having fun and aesthetic pleasure of knowing your killer looks good(even though you don't see it in a match) but survivors you face have to deal with annoying piece of shit power that needs a severe rework to stop being so annoying in game and uncounterable in chase. that's... sad, I dunno. 
---
Honestly, at high ranks, you pretty much lose unless you have ruin, or tunnel. I appreciate it actually, to slow to gen rush just a little bit
---
&gt;(unless you face nurse or spirit
---
Rancor + NOED + Haunted Grounds. Triple exposure for triple efficiency. 
---
Yeah. So don't get frustrated at the game when you choose to make it harder on yourself. You know exactly what you're going into. Playing solo is a gamble, and if you do not realize this then maybe just play SWF.
---
I camp DS when it's efficient.
---
D A R N
---
They're slow because his power forces people to stand still in order to Mend themselves or they go down. His power still puts the survivor in an injured state, so all you have to do is listen for the survivor grunting in pain to find them and smack them once.
---
Hey that's pretty toxic
---
Well that was entertaining :)
---
Developer Stream on Thursday
---
Sounds like a hardmode scratched mirrormyers
---
but I mean your killer looks good *in your taste* so survivors shouldn't be bothered they're having a frustrating and boring game, right?
---
More like a cash grab? Errr bp
---
Borrowed time and sprint burst. Otherwise genrush and let him waste his time.
---
I'd rather face looping then stealth. Also, your most used power is much less useful in a stealth only situation, if your flair is anything to go by. I mean, stealth is annoying as fuck. 
---
I once got completely random 2ks this way cause survivors were really confused and scared. 
---
The people watch streams for entertaining content, what would you call this? Would you sub to someone after watching a “clip that” moment such as this?
---
Not to say he shouldn’t stream different games.
---
[is that not a claudette?](https://i.imgur.com/pN6ATiI.jpg)
---
Agitation is the superior version of iron grasp
---
Nah man, she's the Flash.
---
I don’t run Ruin in Hillbilly. I run Discordance. Stops gen rushing, I can easily get 2 people down at the start of the game, and most importantly, IT DOESN’T BREAK IN 20 SECONDS. 
---
Still a killer main but frankly it's garbage right now.
---
To be honest it's the terrible queue times as survivor that are keeping me doing it.
---
Play with your food is nice too. Literally ignore the DS after you spot them and you get a nice buff. 
---
I agree with you but I guess it depends on your opinion.
---
But the point I was trying to make is we haven’t seen any new nurse other than that pixelated little crappy pic.
---
I get triggered by do mains
---
Suspect? Its virtually guarenteed the ibsession will be DS. Didn't see their aura so it sure as hell ain't OoO.
---
And they always tell killers to stop crying about DD because it can be countered....so I found a counter.
---
Like what am I meant to do? Let them off the hook so that they can stun me at some point later in the game? Why on earth would I do that when im trying to win? A stun does me no favours.
---
I love how entitled DS users get. "Waaaah LET ME HAVE MY FREE ESCAPE!! WAAAAAH!!!"
---
Its like that guy on here the other day who cried when the killer slugged him so wasnt giving him a chance to use his DS. Fucking entitled little babies.
---
Or make DS an exhaustion perk
---
a friend of mine got banned for abusing an exploit or something when he streamed the day prior and didn't do so.
---
You can get banned but reporting does nothing. You have to email them with video proof. i always record my games for that reason.
---
Reminds of a joke about him breast feeding a hungry kid
---
Yeah fucking idiots trying to better the game. How dare they want something you like to improve.
---
Why not have Pharmacy work on open chests that are empty, and essentially be him throwing together whatever he can find into a medkit? Give it aura reading on chests, less than Plunderers but still enough to be useful. 
---
Wierd flex but ok.
---
Give survivors a second objective. Dont make it replace the generators but give it a purpose. People are always complaing about BP how about a second objective that spawns after all generators are done or if you're the last survivor that dramatically increases Bp gain but at the risk of staying in the trial
---
Alright mr tryhard pants. Some people play for a little something called “fun” look it up, it might surprise you. Jesus.
---
If there's a DS I'll tend to tunnel them a bit just because of wasting so much time
---
Darn. Freddy buffs won’t make him good. It’s rework time. 
---
Please give me original format. That picture is too damn good
---
Can you not get those anymore?
---
Doesn't face camping mean he is right in front of you? Wasn't he just "regular" camping?
---
Whenever I play with a friend for the first time
---
If you DC like 75% of your game you will get banned
---
how... how did you find it?
---
Such a crutch
---
~~That's actually her screeching noise~~
---
For real? I’ve played this game since day 1. So I can dc like a month straight and still in get banned?? That’s crazy 😂
---
Deliverance isn't reallt a great perk. It's too situational
---
Yes it is when the game is unfun for 4 people and fun for 1.  
---
Haha this happens to me so much. It’s scarier than tripping a hag trap when you don’t know it’s hag. 
---
I hate to come of as mean but do you no what a lag switch looks like? becuase what you described doesn't sound like one at all.
---
more like a case of your or the hosts internet being high as all hell
---
This is what I get for running altruistic perks
---
Tbagging was literally the only toxic thing in this video. And the killer earned it, he was being a camping bitch the entire match
---
Where have you gone, bot :(
---
((Calm Spirit))
---
get what you want to play. You will have a lot more fan and do better if you buy what you like. Rank doesn't matter but if you want to get rank 1 try and read up on how to rank of efficiently.
---
https://redd.it/8bvz68
---
The devs have said that SWF was intended though.
---
Given enough practise its easy to pull off consistently.
---
lmao so happy I'm on PC. I knew it was bad but not THIS bad
---
"someone disagrees with me so that must mean they are crybaby survivor mains"
---
I've been thinking about buying the darkness among us, is legion really that bad? 
---
1 week and you already got Ruin 3 and Bbq 3 on your Spirit? Ok I believe that.
---
Many bring unbreakable.
---
But i didnt throw the game. I won because of it lol I was just in a salty mood due to the hook changes on the ptb making DS so easy now, and survivors acting like little shits so I really didn't feel like taking a DS on that day.
---
There was no indication of that. He wasn't being friendly in any way
---
Idk but you have to DC a lot on short span of time I guess. Honestly I DC a lot and have never been punished, I'm around 30% of DC game I'd say.
---
Yeah I tend not to hit survivors when they're fresh off a hool but if its the obsession and im in the area then im sure as hell gonna do it. That way I know they're gonna be next to a hook.
---
They bring it on themselves.
---
Both
---
Hmmm I been at rank 1 killer for over a year and I only get messages saying “fix your net plz”, so maybe you are rather unfun, jus’ saying.
---
My god
---
The description is "A heavily salted pudding"; it's made of salty survivors
---
DWIGHT! ... SMASH!
---
It’s not that unbelievable. If they like the game then it wouldn’t be unthinkable that they play a lot
---

Bbq and chili

T bagging is toxic, you can't deny it. I don't have a problem with fighting toxicity with toxicity, i do it too, but you can't deny that what  op is doing, is fighting toxicity with toxicity.
---
I'm gonna have this as my headcanon haha. Otherwise I have to imagine Julie trying to follow Frank into his first trial when the entity comes down and goes *no*
---
As a killer main. I agree. 
---
When every survivor gets hooked at least twice and I get 2 sacrifices and I get an 'ez' in chat
---
*grrr*
---
Someone made a bot which replies with perks when you put them in double brackets. It seems to be down
---
&gt; Using lack of experience on a killer to bully new players
---
Not everyone is doing it to actually bully new players though. I myself mostly play killer and currently have 3 smurf accounts and consider myself an aggressive but fair killer who actively tries to avoid things like tunnelling and constantly gives survivors a chance, sometimes to my own detriment, and will sometimes even intentionally mess up or let someone escape.
---
My reasons for having these smurfs are quite simple, the first was made to try out &amp; mess around with playing other killers just after I hit rank 10 on my main which I was almost exclusively playing Nurse on till I reached rank 1 (which I did, aside from some dailies on other killers where I didn't care about pips) and I peaked around rank 8 on the smurf. The second account was made some time later when I was bored as a little challenge for myself to rank playing Wraith with zero perks or addons that I got to rank 11 before I got bored of playing DBD for a while. And the third account I just started playing on 4 days ago as a Freddy main, having never played him before, which is already nearly rank 7 with just him (aside from some dailies for others where I tried to avoid pipping) and I'd argue only a minority in the high ranks were actually "new players" as the majority I've gone against have seemed experienced enough. And as I said above I generally consider myself a fair killer, hell on the recent Freddy account I've intentionally let a number of survivors escape and even had a few games where I decided to tunnel a player I know is strong for the fun of it only to let them all escape at the end.
---
Ah, ok
---
I agree to some extent but I’m in a community on Facebook and we are all just so nice to each other and helpful.. it’s amazing!  And people want to blame survivors for being toxic but killers do so much unbelievable shitty stuff that I see why survivors feel the need to talk shit.  As a killer I’ve never been messages. NEVER. I get 4ks most of the time with MICHAEL and play to the best that I can without singling anyone out. So the fact that some killers receive hate messages so often, it’s because THEY’RE doing something wrong. Don’t @ me 
---
Had this happen before
---
Okay, I just understood that constant healing makes it boring.
---
When he came out, everyone was whining how bad killer he is and now how unavoidable hi is. Or they. Whatever. 
---
He is quite slow when not in a frenzy, so at that time he's escapable. When he is in frenzy, that's the problem right? But it lasts only a while. Maybe that while could be shorter? Maybe it could reload slower?
---
okay, you know, i will play the Legion till i get a migraine today. and i will provide screenshots of every single game on this very post.
---
weekends are never a good time for me cause in my region i get a lot of swfs and a lot of them are not chill. so i rarely even touch killers during these days. and today i already played some killers and it was harsh as usual. but not with Legion.
---
and do consider this is rank 1, pc, EU zone. 
---
You know people funnel bloodpoints into characters they don't necessarily play on the go right.
---
Matt - "In the Badham Preschool, we had a lot of reports where the school is really difficult to get anybody out of once they're slugged if the basement's not down there. To handle that dead zone, we forced a hook to spawn at one of the entrances of the school."
---
This fixes very little though. There was often 1 hook out there. Once that's gone, what about the rest? When I play Badham it's very common for all survivors to run down to the basement over and over and over again. Don't say bring agitation becaus ryou don't know if this map is coming up or not.
---
They need a hook in the basement too. Especially since decisive strike is still a thing.
---
Also bringing back the new SC is a dumb idea. It will replace the old one for sure and everyone will be self-caring again at 21 seconds which is an enourmous survivor buff.
---
Just DC man
---
Legion is the easiest killer to play. Those add ons just make his time to down quicker.
---
Where is, if I don't bm, he might leave me, but if you bm, hes never leaving you.
---
Honestly me playing killer
---
The killer has a right to slug anyone they want regardless of what perks they're running.
---
i know, they're really the easiest. when i loaded in a game i thought i'm gonna get max 2k cause these are just yellow add-ons, nothing op, and i didn't play them much. but it was easier than when i did kills with Billy. or Spirit when she just came out and people didn't know how to counter.
---
I agree
---
Because without running it you will be slower than in the previous patch. Still debatable whether it's worthwhile of course.
---
@BVBYSCORPIO666
---
Is this a question?
---
Did you not even read what I posted? 
---
&gt;" get what you want to play"
---
Who cares, play what you find fun, if you've been thinking about buy Legion cause it seems fun do it. No one is judges nor cares what you play.
---
Legion is kind of a.... divisive topic, honestly.
---
I personally don't like them, but others do. They're kind of considered the most frustrating killer to go up against for most people though.
---
I'd put muh dick in that mouth. 
---
I have been told this before but what do I switch it for
---
With the incoming Spies buff it could be an interesting tracking tool. Regarding NOED. It might feel great to stomp people when things get downhill suddenly, but please don't rely on it. It'll make you a better killer if your able to manage your time to prevent sudden downhill experiences. 
---
However, hope you have a great time in the fog. Keep slashing, tums-tums!
---
xD
---
Vault master god?
---
What do you recommend I trade NOED for, Unrelenting?
---
It's a good idea if you're shit and you need 1 kill
---
Exactly the same here.
---
The survivors are very different right off the bat due to having different perks (Meg Thomas can sprint over pallets/walls and into lockers silently, William "Bill" Overbeck can pick himself up off the ground), but the way the Perk system works is that one you hit levels 30, 35, and 40, you've unlocked that particular character's perks to be used on every other character.
---
On the Survivors, this means that they become nothing more than cosmetic changes. On the Killers, each killer is still totally different from one another.
---
also, i am Freddy main. and i don't find it easy to go perkless on rank 1 and get 4k. my max(i know his power perfectly) by going perkless and with no add-ons depending on a map is like.. 2 kills? not more than that.
---
The new i-frames off of unhook is so glorious against this shit.  I love it
---
"survivors think they're good juking someone that can't see shit"
---
Lol happens on PC too. *Claudette runs into the corn*
---
Omg I juked you! Ez im so good!!
---
To be honest I dont think the devs just dont give a shit, I just think whether its talent, resources or the engine they just can't do much better
---
Summary of the lfg dbd discord 
---
the surv got 5k survival and I got mori points + emblem for 3 sacreficed :)
---
really? you ever tried to do consistent 4k with perkless Freddy? or even 2k? or even 1k? cause i said i am Freddy main. and i know you CAN but it's not consistent.
---
so, okay, played another one, got 2k and they finished gens. but it is my player fault cause i chilled too much and didn't pay attention, ignored those i hooked completely even when 2 gens were done and even though i could have downed them with m1.  
---
https://imgur.com/a/3zqote7
---
hm
---
Yep I understand but don't say it's the fault of survivor. We didn't do the map. If we can't use decisive because it's trash (and I agree with this), at least can we try to juke the killer to survive ^^
---
It really depends. If you whiff your M1s a lot. All in all I really don't like Unrelenting. You don't have that much to choose from... so whatever feels fun right now. 
---
If you'll get some teachables one day I really recommend Enduring &amp; Spirit Fury it gets rid of pallets easily and allows you to use your chainsaw more deliberately sooner into the match. 
---
The point is that you can even take the worst killer and by playing much better than your enemies you will 4k. Trying to make a point based on showing your good games doesn't mean anything since the survivors you face can be anything from utter trash not using a pallet once to some 3000 hour guy who can loop a killer for 4 minutes.  
---
While the "loop" scenario falls flat for legion, there is still this wide variety on players you can face. And with Legion you will no way in hell get a 4k should you face 4 very well playing survivors.
---
Suppose that’s something, hopefully they get it fixed before the patch goes live.
---
Thank you
---
Restraint is MVP
---
I do it anyways just because it's funny
---
Yea, run enduring on killers like Spirit or Hag(who don't need it) only because someone may have game destroying ds.
---
It should be fixed now
---
Never underestimate smol billy.

How many 3v1s did you get? Did you make a new account just for this?
---
Negativity bias aswell as Selective Perception play a role in this. If you start counting how many people are  
---
- negative (toxic, flaming, bming)  
---
- neutral (just play, dont say anything in chat)  
---
- positive (say gg or are friendly)  
---
and put it onto paper you will find out that its overall not that bad. 
---
As in terms of abilities, I'd place Huntress on the same level of Hellsing((manga)) characters, Daredevil villains, or Flash villains. She's grounded yet superhuman. Her hatchets would probably be as fast as bullets. But even still she'd be great for recon, she could double as a sharpshooter as well. 
---
Imagine the Wraith sneaking up on a troop then ripping their spin out of their ass.

Correct, unless it appears on the weekly Shrine of Secrets rotation. Some perks are considered rarer than others for said rotation, though; for example, I think BBQ &amp; Chilli hasn't come up for a good 50+ weeks or so.
---
Also one of the best general survivor tips I can give to a new player is to learn how to look behind you while running. Far too many players just keep their camera pointed forward relying on the killer's red light when you can mindgame and dodge the killer much easier by keeping your camera turned around. You might run into some stuff at first but it's a good habit to get started.
---
They’ve said before that it’s intentional. That way the killer can’t see you when you complete a gen or you can’t see the killer when they hook someone. 
---
No, Legion is by far the easiest killer in the game and every idiot can play them effectively and pip without even killing on them. They are just very weak at getting kills. 
---
With nurse you should 3k to 4k atleast 9/10 games at rank 1 once you can play her well.
---
-sigh- Fine, I'll be the one to say it once again
---
***Rank does not determine skill***
---
It probably would work very well with the suprised pikachu format.
---
Since you hit me with a hammer I have the right to hit you with a broken glass too
---
I mean sure if you're gonna tunnel a guy off hook 30 seconds into a match, yeah 3v1 is hard against anyone. Poor dude who got 3k points for a match cos you wanted to prove a point on the internet.
---
You know, I really like Legion, but I still feel like you doing consistently good might be a matter of playing low ranks.
---
Not to invalidate you. I'm sure you're doing well.
---
That's not how the meme works. Deranking does NOT make you r1 with long queues
---
Nice
---
Could almost pass for Myers
---
Holy shit. Everyone wins.

When people complain about legion, a majority aren't talking about their actual power level but rather their design. Legion if played as the devs intended is supposed to quickly dash from survivior to survivor getting a hit on each to put all of them into deep wounds state. The problem with this design is the only way you can actually do that is to make it so that The legion is able to negate all counterplay from the survivors. 
---
Typically if a survivor is being chased by a killer, they can go to a pallet or window to get a little distance and set up a loop. The legion's ability to jump over pallets and windows means that survivors are incapable of escaping them in frenzy mode though. This means that if The Legion goes for a survivor, 90% of the time, they will land a hit with their power. This in itself is annoying, but the problem comes with how you actually down people with the legion. Deep wounds will never down a competent survivor on it's own. Mending is just not a difficult thing to do if legion isn't following you. Unfortunately, what that means is that legion just ends up following a survivor around and using frenzy every 15 seconds to get an unavoidable hit until the suvivor goes down and there isn't any way for the suvivor to stop this happening. For a survivor, this just sucks. It isn't fun to have a killer that is undodgeable just chase you down and catch you whenever they want, even if it isn't an instant down and takes a while. It is really unsatisfying to feel like there is nothing you could have done to prevent it.
---
On the killer side though, it is equally unsatisfying because it is a slow inevitability with the legion. Most downs aren't earned with the legion, it is just the slow process of following someon around while waiting until your power bar goes off cooldown and taking another swipe tha the survivor can't o anything about until they go down. It is too easy and simple to be engaging, and takes so long that unless you just single out one survivor to repeatedly rehook over and over, it takes so long to do this slow bur inevitable successful chase that on average you will only get 2 kills anyway, even though you were chasing people all game.
---
Short version, Legion negates the main interest point for the game, the chase, and that is unsatisfying for everyone.
---
my 3d game today, fukin finally after 20 minutes of waiting for lobby. fukin Haddonfield, i hate it. i know two of these survivors, frequently play with them, they're good. this time i didn't fuck around. just killing. the Claudette dc(when i think 3 gens were done) because i downed them through the fence - they were stupid enough to be too close.
---
https://imgur.com/a/aOZqXDF
---
Happened to me with the Pig to some extent, but kinda screwed her over. I used Dead Hard, only to get downed at the exit gate (same as OP). She places a trap on my head as my survivor crawls out; was so worried my head would instapop. Sadly the running animation didn't have the RBT on. 
---
Personally i think you're overreacting quite abit. Ive got around a thousand hours in this game and 'sadly' to say ive always played solo and alone. 50% Surv and 50% killer. Because of the easy ranking system i always play in red ranks (i hate it). Im not nearly as good as any of those players and its espacially very hard when i play a killer vs those god-like-loopers. It feels like a 1vs4 game for me. (wich it is)
---
However i do my best, Try not to tunnel and take the other persons gameplay into consideration. If they get farmed on the hook for whatever reason and im playing killer i try not to go for the easy kill but instead let them have a chance and go for the 'farmer'. All in all. Over those hundreds of games i've PERSONALLY faced almost no toxic stuff. Ofcouse there are those that will always be unhappy but you just say "gg" and carry on, Leave game and create/join lobby forget about it. Like a person above said.
---
YOU are a major factor in how the game plays out.
---
You can't see him and he's nigh-impossible to get away from, especially if he runs Nurse's Calling (which I do).
---
Okay thank you for explaining I ubderstand now.
---
Susie is still thick tho.
---
just did 2 very successful games with them again. easiest games in my life. screenshots are in another conversation on this same post. i'm doing it whole day today(or at least till i get migraine). if you're being so skeptical. how about i stream this shit for you? 
---
My friends always say "let me save I have borrowed" then rush for the save and borrowed gets no usage because the killer is nowhere nearby whilst if I'd unhooked I could have healed super fast so we could get back on gens.
---
yes? and? did he play Bubba less than 10 games or he actually put some time in learning the killer and power?
---
It's becoming more of Legion is just boring to a lot of people since there is no strategy to playing them and it becomes boring for both sides. Also I think the general skill of people has gone down since the latest patch, people always hiding in lockers instead of doing gens and healing to full against Legion because apparently they don't want Thanato
---
1. I believe the hook by the cars, on Badham, is forced. Thus, there will be 2 forced hooks, so if you play smart, the boiler room won't be an issue.
---
I will collect all stats from all matches soon but I would guess like 4-5 3v1. I try to dodge the lobbies if not everyone ready up in time, that way I get way less 3v1.
---
And yes I made a new account for this so I could start at rank 20. Also used fake name etc so no one would recognize me and play differently because they knew it was me.
---
That is my friendly killer move during blood hunt!
---
Looping, one of the couple viable strategies survivors can use to escape during a chase, makes you a prick?
---
What do you expect them to do? Run in a straight line until they get downed?
---
Stealth won't save you if you've already been found. Sure you can sneak around all game and not get spotted, but that's boring as fuck and also you get no points for chases
---
YAY! We can all be lame together!
---
I would be soooooo mad
---
\[BRAZZERS logo here\]
---
My mistake was probably playing Feng because it was Haunted Ground and Spirit found me straight after I did the totem &lt;3 She also found others before Haunted Ground ran out, so it was fun and gg
---
But he's the pretty much the easiest killer to loop. If you heal between them like a lot of people do anyway you can delay the chase for 7 seconds. A good Freddy won't always commit to a chase anyway so it's only the babies you have to worry about tunneling you, in which case they probably won't be much of a problem anyway. 
---
What about "doing the Gen in the shack while a teammate is looping the Killer there"?
---
I can hear exactly what would've been going through their mind.
---
It's nothing nice.
---
why would it cause exhaustion and if you do that wouldnt that make the perk a multiple use perk?
---
i just went on Legion spree. 
---
already had 3 games. only using yellow add-ons. two of these games 4k, one - 2k cause i just chilled and fucked around instead of playing normal. 
---
made a post about it, people saying "hard to get kills blah-blah, one time 4k doesn't count". i mean ok, i started playing more and it is braindead easy to play them and not in the slightest hard to get kills. i'm not having fun with them. it's too easy.
---
You’re forgetting the most overpowered one of them all... Johnny sins
---
I don't believe in an eye for an eye because it makes the world blind. I get camped, tunneled, teabagged a lot but I never return the "favor". Let's be better together.
---
The worst I'd do is to not give the last survivor the hatch.
---
Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, "Battlestar Galactica.
---
When was this changed? Im always wondering if console even had these or they removed them before it was out. (im a console player) 
---
Thanks so much! I really didn’t know that legion was like this and I started out playing her for a mission. I think I might play her more tho for the points
---
And the ds
---
i think you didnt understand the mechanics of this game. Is nurses calling overpowered on nurse, cause she can instantly teleport to him healing? no. dont make it worse for you, you are already judged by you dumb opinion. made up by self made 'rules'. BBQ just has a strong synergy with billy, hex ruin isnt overpowerd at all. Heck, they even made distortion as a perk and lockers too to counter bbq. its not way too powerful on them. but yes, billy would be weaker if he came out today. nurse probably too.
---
Based off of my experience, I was certain that the way to deal with any facecamper (to be read - killer) was to immediately DC as soon as you were about to be hooked (dcing asap if you were the obsession)?
---
Have you made sure your NAT is open and done port forwarding for your console? How’s your connection in other games? I ask because that’s not my experience at all either. I haven’t waited longer than 45 seconds for a survivor queue in weeks.
---
[Hiya.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9bslxt/survivor_perks_in_need_of_buffs_my_thoughts/)
---
It's an answer.
---
Hey, I have just about the same amount of subs and make dbd videos too, interested in possibly collabing some time?
---
Think he was fucking with you
---
He probably was in the locker and said he left the game. So you left and he won.
---
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
---
If you’re staring at the hook from a distance where no one can come save the hooked survivor, and not moving at all until that survivor is dead, you’re facecamping.
---
Some simple Legion counterplays: Stop healing to full, do gens, thanatophobia only adds a few seconds even with all 4 injured, and stop running towards gens where teammates might be cause you're gonna go down so run to an empty part of the map
---
I actually unironically agree with you that teabagging is part of the game. I’m sure that’ll get me called toxic. But if I can trigger the killer and get them to tunnel me while my teammates finish gens and win the game then I’ll teabag and click a flashlight and loop to my hearts content.
---
What does not healing to full accomplish? 
---
You can use the emote to call him towards you. That is less toxic and will attract most of the killers. Teabagging is disrespectful. There is nothing wrong in wanting a killer to waste time chasing you but the meaning behind that gesture is just bad.
---
Doesn’t stop them from asking their moms to get GTAV.. 
---
Win win!
---
Yeah, I see so many people waste time that they could be doing gens and finishing the game. By the time it takes legion to down the survivor they chose to focus on, you could get a gen most of the way done and even completed if they're far enough away
---
Oh my god.Another guy who plays swf and thinks that he is original by doing so.
---
I don't even find them fun to play as, there's really no strategy or skill to them
---
Nicely said
---
Ardetha is also good on twitch 
---
Great recommendations
---
Nah, that was just her score from when she mori’ed me, 2 minutes into the match. 
---
thats targeted harassment

I see his name in every shitty meme
---
That’s me! 🥰✨
---
Freddy and his 20 meter claws
---
She da best
---
There’s people like me that havent played since last reset and are still 14-15 when we originally were 6-7
---
1 hooked from a NOED down at the end of the game is the worst feeling.
---
Game destroying? Way to overreact my dude.
---
Yes, you can apply it to every perk, so? 
---
There are a lot of players who are very successful without Ruin and/or NOED. Even not very good players like me can get to red ranks without Ruin and NOED and playing not top-tier killers. These perks are very strong, no one disputes this. But they are not mandatory.
---
Also ScottJund, ZubatLEL on twitch
---
Yeah, the only downside is that he can hear you when you're injured but I guess I have to try to run away. 
---
He tricked you man, lmao.
---
&gt; because Victor absolutely LOATHES the idea of Jason being the main villain, so with him taking the helm, don't count on him showing up again. But who knows.
---
Do you honestly believe that he gives a fuck? No. He just wants the money from the franchise and having technically created Jason. 
---
If you like her yeah she is really good for mindgamed
---
Thanks, I'm glad someone liked it.
---
Schrödinger's Meg, apparently
---
He’s annoying, the moonwalkers are the worst, with franks mixtape, I put in about 2% effort, I’ll do gens and rescue but my heart just isn’t in it.
---
Don't lie, I own it for both PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, and while it does play A LOT better on the X, its far from godly. It does feel a tiny bit smoother to me, but frames are still dropping quite a bit.
---
Absolutely! She can be amazing if used properly. Keep in mind, every time you "get your ass kicked", you learn more. I just kinda pick certain perks and see what works well. Ultimately, the more time you put in, the more you get out.
---
&gt; when I got hooked for the first time and and after few seconds I immediately went into the struggle animation
---
If you were the last survivor alive, that's normal. If not, that's strange.
---
&gt; Also while I was getting sacrificed I heard the sound pig does during the ambush attack does legion can do it too with another ability?
---
This sound also plays when killer goes out of Insidious. Maybe that killer had that?
---
&gt;the
---
Kindred III? 8 meters is enough, 32 meters is craziness, on the Game map you would be seeing killer all the time someone's hooked.
---
Son it takes me a day to get someone to level 25 just because you're slow as hell doesn't mean you need to project onto everyone else
---
You haven't even mentioned the worst part: hitting Bloodlust in a chase.
---
Your frame drop and the survivor does a 180 or 360 and they fucking vanish.
---
i know that. Just explained to the guy i replied to why its just auprised feng
---
Actually the Unreal Engine was the first step of the optimization. So they are working on it.
---
Doesn't stop either of them bring crutch. DS has also been in the shrine very recently regardless.
---
Amen. However, with all the people who leave, it would slow down queues drastically.
---
Yea, that i supposed to be his power, if you know how to deal with this he ain't do shit tbh. I love trapping survivors by windows but it's soooo rare against good survivors. 
---
They were around during console, my friend burned one the other day.
---
Gen rushing=face camping simple
---
Yeah I don't understand why people are so afraid of DS, I let them waste it and down them like 10 sec later, most DS players don't have a plan and at worst you spend another 30 sec to redown the bastard. 
---
Could have added a JoJo "to be continued" at the end tbh.
---
Do you really think that many people leave? I mean I've only been playing this game for a couple days but I probably get a leave on average once every 3 games.
---
BBQ is way easier to counter now, hiding in a locker before a player is hooked and waiting 6 sec, or you can hid behind a gen

So in the upcoming Moonrise event as stated by BHVR, players will be able to use to coins earned to purchase 3 full Lunar cosmetic character outfits (9 items total) but there are only 3 outfits anyway 😞

I have nurses haunted grounds noed and bbq right now 
---
&gt; Kindred  
---
Give survivors a base version, but in exchange remove killers emblem getting reduced for being close to the hook.  
---
&gt; Left behind  
---
Would still be a shit perk noone ever uses. Either rework the perk or wait until hatch rework before looking at it.  
---
&gt; This is not happening  
---
Its okay as it is. Its a syngetic perk for No Mither and in general can help out people who struggle with skill checks.  
---
&gt; Slippery Meat / Up the Ante  
---
Shit perks, give them a complete re work.  
---
&gt; Boil Over  
---
Fair change.  
---
&gt; Saboteur  
---
Since you using it for memey shit and saboing hooks, maybe add a bonus 30/40/50% bonus blodness bloodpoints to it.  
---
&gt; Tenacity  
---
It is good as it is. Its a rather unique perk that isn't aimed at being copmpeteive, but rather having some suprise/flashy moments. One interesting change would be to add that you are bleeding less while on the ground. That way its slightly more likely to actually do something.  
---
&gt; No Mither  
---
No. No Mither is not meant to be good. Its meant to be a challenge for yourself. Only nice change would be to reward no mither users with a bit more BP.  
---
&gt; Vigil  
---
There was a better change suggested recently. Make it so that Exhaustion recovers while moving at any speed. In my opinion make Vigil even give Exhaust Recovery while in chase.  
---
Aww Bill, I feel so sorry for him. :C
---
Tbh I prefer this than watching them (usually) hand the killer a free 3-4K
---
Lol does franklins work with feral frenzy? If so ... Ezpz
---
Dont switch noed coz survivor nvr switch ds lol
---
Sometimes people on console have a privacy setting where you can’t message them, usually killers do this to avoid hate messages. Happens a bunch to be honest 
---
Not today!
---
Ez teachables myc is her only good one anyways! :p
---
So it originally comes from back in the day there were these things called brand new parts which still exist but dont do anything now. You would bring a tool box and the bnp add on. This add on would prompt somewhat difficult skill checks every few seconds until the gen was done getting the gen completed in like 15 or 20 seconds. So swf teams would come in each person with a tool box with a bnp and complete one gen then they would all go use their BNP which would finish all the gens in like 2 mins total.
---
They called that gen rushing which it is, but now it's a word that is a relic that killers dont understand and use when people complete the gens quickly (due to them having shitty map pressure) because someone else told me that. Its an excuse that bad killers make to justify why they lost but it doesnt exist. Survivors should be doing gens so it is just saying "hey I made wrong choices and didnt protect the gens as I should have". Back in the day it was OP now it doesnt exist and is just used to try to justify losing.
---
I’d recommend overcharge on its own, unnerving doesn’t realy help overcharge Freddy in any way
---
Unfair lol nice what about ds anderline and borrowed time at end game? Is that fair for killer?
---
I would drop Haunted Grounds in favor of something else, maybe sloppy. Haunted Grounds isn’t great on Spirit because people expect it, they may not cleanse the totems if they don’t have to (if there is no Ruin or something). Even if they do cleanse it, it’s unlikely you get more than 1 instadown with it if any at all.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Now it is. Though many maps there are very few lockers about. Sometimes you just really aren't close to them.
---
Running distortion also *tells* me if they are running BBQ. I'll deliberately let distortion activate to tell me if I need to waste time worrying about BBQ the rest of the game. 
---
Personally, i LOVE it when people camp. Its a free iridescent lightbringer and an easy win.
---
people underestimate the potential of a hex perk with trapper he is very strong when its in a good spot like a built in thrill
---
Yes.
---
Connection is good in any other game. 
---
I get instant killer lobbies anyhow. Like, 20 seconds tops. 
---
There are just too many corn maps like whyyyyy. Extra hard with a short killer in those shit stick fields
---
dont bother trying to justify thx
---
Yeah, I am more so a killer main, over 3k hours into the game and I've all but stopped playing on my ps4 since the framerate is so terrible now.
---
To make things worse, fedex fucked up my computer when they shipped it and have been giving me a massive run around and are currently refusing to pay me, despite having put insurance and such in it.
---
depends if its straight up facecamping or just patroling the hook
---
It was last in the shrine 108 days ago
---
See, I played for a bit during beta a couple years back and back then people would leave and keep whatever rank they did so it was a lot more common. But the fact they lose rank now and still do it, like ?!?!?
---
Exactly, any who have watched a noob3 stream tru3 stream (if he is survivor) at rank 1. You will notice it takes max 15 seconds to find a lobby and alot of the killers are different. 
---
Heck i keep switching up the killers i play at rank 1. Do when i hear people say its only billy or nurse, i just think they should shut up cause they are lying.
---
I saw a Coldwind Cattle Tag the other day
---
define 'lose'
---
90% of the time,it comes from killers that did nothing but tunnel a guy for 5 minutes
---
The more gens you do the more powerful he is. Yes please.
---
Like doing what? It is the ONLY objective
---
Yeah, so in the last 12 shrines. That's when I got it.
---
Everyone has to be on their last hook else it's tunneling, also you HAVE to let them get free unhooks and heal else it's camping.  
---
  
---
Oh, and even if they gen rush you in 4 minutes, you can't use NOED as a deterrent(to force them to do totems or risk getting 1 shotted), also you can't have franklin's because they might lose their items.  
---
ALSO, all killers are toxic and unfun to play against so you can't play any of them.
---
Also bald so it works
---
People "patrol" the hook to make it not look like they are just waiting to see that little notification in the bottom left. Just run Remember Me. No problem.
---
I’m well aware haha I was just letting the dude know killers actual side of it, I’m not a killer main but see plenty say that when they are gen rushed. I’m not against what he’s saying just giving him the info he “asked for” which I feel he already knew the answer 
---
Who else is on the list
---
It gives you PLENTY of time late game to stop them
---
Well, for me, it's getting entity displeased, or brutal killer and less then 2 kills.
---
12 shrines ago is not 'very recently'
---
not really because you dont want to use it if he is too close to the hook you dont want use it as part of the name decisive 
---
well, ye thats the reason, but there is nothing wrong with downing the unhooked guy again
---
Its frowned upon, but its how the game is played. People just need to accept all people play differently.
---
Have you heard of our Lord and savior Iron Will?
---
Legion is fucking aids. Every second of being in a legion game is torture. I’m not saying he’s OP in any way but i can’t stand to play against him. I don’t know how to fix him but remove him in the meantime. 
---
i swear theres a video that shows someone using bloodhound to see it. Maybe space coconuts video 
---
What do you play on?
---
Amen.
---
Pretty recent dude. We've been waiting over 50 shrines for BBQ.
---
Only new players to dbd in the last 3 months haven't had had a chance to get DS. (So not many).
---
Literally at no point did I say no-ed was the only unfair thing in the game. 
---
Yeah fair. 2 or less kills is a lose for a killer imo.
---
But if I have Dying Light, shouldn't I focus on my obsession?
---
Man, that moment. Your second hook, one gen left, you have Adrenaline and you see two teammates working on different gems and a Nea without UE crouching who knows why, all of them stop doing that and all of them start running towards you to get the save. That moment I know the Killer is going to get a 4k.
---
.... You pretty much just said everything I did, but with much worse spacing and a bit more condescension.....
---
Yeah, trust me,there’s a bunch of others that want this too. 
---
No. Save it for when it's most useful. I personally send it for end game or when I'm about to be on my 2nd or 3rd hook depending on the circumstances.
---
Add on. 
---
That is actually a hilarious suggestion. Down one, then as the 3 flashlights approach go and pokey poke them all with Franklins and frenzy wallhack.
---
Skemooo! Tell me about ORM texture in dbd.
---
Is it O - Ambient Occlusion, R - Roughness, M - Metalic?
---
Trying to play with materials.
---
Your ass is getting handed to you because sounds are broken. 
---
Only during the time when you can’t hit them, so they can’t just ignore you and finish the gen.
---
Ah. 
---
Punishing others for a healing perk you run is so dumb, tho
---
But the killer still isn't facecamping.
---
For me it's when you're playing 3-4 really good survivors and a non-top tier killer. And they're very good at looping, and you didn't have Ruin/They got it early/Are actually as good as I am at killer/survivor and hit ever Hex skillcheck. And 3 gens pop instantly, followed by the 4th before you can really put out pressure.
---
It's not a super common thing, but with some killers, on some maps, it can even happen to a top tier killer. Some people will tell you it doesn't exist, some people will meme, some people will kill boosted R1 survivors or main slugging Billy, and defend it, but it's something that can happen.
---
She got it as an escape and I got it as a kill so we both won :)
---
This is called wtf 
---
&gt;Either side during a hatch standoff 
---
FTFY
---
I don't find it to be "toxic". Its the objective, its what survivors have to do. What annoys me is how easy it is to get them done. Ive had so many matches where I'm using Trapper, set up 2-3 traps, go look for someone right after, find them, begin a chase and 2 gens are popped in less than a minute and a half. It takes 80 seconds to complete a gen on your own. Add toolboxes, and a couple people with leader, they get done insanely fast. Its the reason I bring in NOED. The killers objective is to kill. A majority of my matches, I put enough pressure to not ever need NOED so it ends up being a wasted perk slot. But I'm using it if not to secure a kill or 2, to at least get the inevitable tea baggers at the exit out ASAP so I can move on to the next game. Its also the perfect counter to "gen rushing". If youre just doing gens as fast as possible, don't cry for getting killed by NOED when you could have easily prevented it by cleansing 5 measly totems.
---
Yes and BDE is blood dirt and emission 
---
You'd want high level whispers anyways, tells you when you're closer instead of picking up a hooked survivor halfway across the map
---
You probably get pissed when you get hit with NOED huh?
---
Makes it harder to escape if you aren’t running remember me as well. I tried to main Freddy a while back and survivors just ignore you until they’re asleep, and unless you are camping the exit gate, they’ll finish before asleep, thought it would be easy to implement and make the dream states down side of being unable to hit immediately a lot less damaging.
---
Pretty sure he meant the dev stream?
---
Saw nothing about it in the patch notes.
---
I know, I didn't read the whole thing apparently. Mental short circuits are annoying. 
---
Yea, just look what Ardetha is doing with Nurse(the worst killer btw) with Fire Up. 4k with the slowest killer in the game, it should be removed, not even reworked, let everybody forget that such a crutch perk ever existed. And shame on everybody who's using this OP trash. Period.
---
I had a nearly same experience as killer like you. Got my Dying Light obsession and I'm so devastated to kill while all other survivors are just doing anything to save him. 
---
I play more survivor than killer but these survivor salt. You are right to camp or whatever. Just hook them tricky bastards.
---
Thats called cheating
---
Good morning! I play on Xbox One and more often than not, I get an "Initialization Error" when logging in. It always happens on the "license cache" part of the login. It recommends I restart my game, but it sometimes can take a day for it to actually work. I tried reinstalling the game which didn't help. Any suggestions? Thanks! 
---
PC!
---
Not at all. Yeah, it sucks. But it's part of the game and I accept that. I bet you get pissed when you're looped for 6 mins.
---
reddy
---
&gt;waiting over 50 shrines for BBQ
---
&gt;haven't had a chance to get DS
---
you can just buy the DLC and level the characters so that's irrelevant but whatever because that's a different argument
---
i don't see what your point is. NOED is a non-teachable so it's very easy for noobs to get their hands on it and use it, whereas with DS you have to buy a licensed DLC, level a character and then learn how to hit the skill check, and even when you get that far, you still have to be good at chases or else you're gonna go back down fairly soon.
---
Idk man, I feel like you don't really need Distortion to tell you if the killer is running BBQ and faking them out is really easy just run to the side for a few seconds then run the other way. Distortion is good but I feel like it's a very situational perk and could be swapped with better perks.
---
Ok? then don't come on reddit with 30 hours giving advice
---
Am i the only one who thinks that he isnt that bad, does well with him and doesnt want him reworked
---
no need for such changes as long as swf is a thing lmao
---
playing with 3 mates and voice literally defeats the purpose of the game
---
Bopt what the fuck you doing getting karma
---
What you on about? It helps me cleanse about 3/4 totems each game, lets me search for NOED at the end if need be.
---
Means I don't have to run UE since it'll alert me to hag traps.
---
I get alerted to trapper traps.
---
Pretty nice perk. 
---
oops dropped my wallet
---
I think he's fun to play as and against. My favorite to go up against aside from nurse. I really dont understand the hate. I wish I encountered him more but it's rare I see a legion :/
---
Just a tip: on the game map hatch will always spawn on the lower floors 
---
I’d highly recommend the Halloween DLC or the Curtain Call dlc. Clown and Myers are both fantastic killers and Laurie and Kate have pretty good perks (aside from Sole Survivor). I’d pick up those DLC’s first. As for tips, if you’re playing killer I’d recommend watching Bricky’s casefiles series. It’s fairly old but it still holds up for all killers up to the Clown. For survivor, I don’t know too much but watching streamers worked for me. I’m pretty sure TydeTyme did a guide on survivor so watching that should help. 
---
Then it's not a matter of a particular survivor character since they all are the same, they have no special M2 power as killers. Legion is unfun to play against because of his design. I don't even care about winning or losing, just facing it. Nurse, Hillbilly and Spirit are all arguable stronger than Legion and I'd rather face any of those and lose the game than win a game against a Legion.
---
The fact these outfits can be earned for free is awesome. Definitely excited.
---
really only works against 2 killers, and even then you can't tell the difference between a trap and a totem since the sound is the same. 
---
you also realise that you can cleanse totems without small game, right? the perk doesn't really save you that much time.
---
but again, different argument. it's like running unnerving to counter DS, except unnerving actually does enough to justify running it.
---
Nvm I'm on ps4 
---
Ruin is only needed if you dont know how to pressue
---
I for one, accept my Jeff overlord. 
---
*a brief moment of respite*
---
Watch out or legion will mug you for your items!
---
It works against 2 killers specific powers. And all killers who run hexes.
---
You do realise it lets you know you're close to a totem right so you dont have to go check every location up close? I can run round a map just looking left and right to see if one is in range. Awesome for finding ruin at the start of game.
---
Like A for vaults and RB for lockers. Dont know what MnK layout is so got no input in that.
---
Maybe they’re using his rework as incentive to stop being toxic. Holding him hostage or something. If we stop being toxic, we get the Freddy rework. 
---
Or they’re too busy with everything else to even rework him. 
---
Kindred. 
---
I expected this kind of comment. Doesn't matter how good of a killer I am, or how can I put a pressure etc. If I play against experienced survivors that can loop me for 2 minutes... Then I can't win regardless of what I do.
---
 
---
And he catches you a few seconds later 😂😂😂
---
No I dont face camp if there is 3-4 gen left, If only one gen left I will camp.
---
maybe drop the chase?
---
The clarifications on their thoughts on the changes to Self Care and Legion are both really nice to hear. As a Legion main I thought the change to Deep Wounds on injured Survivors was good but seeing all the "Legion OP", "uncounterable", and "DC if Legion" threads I can see how that change would make an already unfun Killer ~~that you guys labeled as worse than Freddy lol~~ more unfun.
---
As for the Self Care change... I think a perk that allows for self heal but reduces all healing would be very interesting as a concept. Not as the be-all end-all replacement to Self Care but having more options for a solo play perk and a team play perk (akin to running Kindred in solo play or Unbreakble in co-op play when you know your allies can distract the Killer) would allow for more unique gameplay. I know I personally wouldn't change from Self Care but if I was playing at a low rank I'd definetly opt for faster self care and gensb4friends.
---
He needs minor tweaks, but you're right. I'm almost to red ranks mainly playing with him. The problem is, for the devs, survivor fun&gt;killer fun most of the time. People hate playing against Freddy in his current iteration. 
---
Fire Up so good we need a killer based off it
---
There already is a petition ongoing, it’s called DC’ing 🙂
---
I don't see anything to be sad about. It's not like we could ever use the event items to purchase non-event related cosmetics.
---
Yes but people DC from Legion on sight so Franklin's won't help get good games.
---
I’m just saying it’s a shame we don’t have any choices to make.
---
None
---
ah yes, 2 killers, out of what? 14? most people use ruin and noed, and DH isn't worth running small game for since its so niche. and if you can't hit ruin skill checks then you're a noob... really not worth running small game and wasting time running around trying to find it.
---
Thats survivor point of view but what about killers point of view? Survivors can simpley counter noed by cleansing totem. If u are lazy thats yourfault not perks? 
---
I still see Yellow offerings for Swamps and Haddonfield from time to time.
---
Hey look a cat knows how to counter noed better then most players
---
Thank you all for  your comments , I have about 60 hours so far and  I just have a feeling the hatch hates me lol. It lets my saviors escape and hides from me when I want to escape ! 
---
Of course, but then again... I lost the time for nothing and other survivors might be as good as the one I have just intentionally lost. I personally cannot get ruthless killer unless I have ruin. Red ranks btw. Maybe I am actually bad, it's just my opinion. Plus console optimalization doesn't really help too.
---
I've found better teammates in lower ranks than I have in red.
---
1. even if you use small game then you are still going to spend a large portion of time looking for the totem
---
2. yes, lots of high rank players consistently hit great skill checks. its second nature to me.
---
this isn't the original argument so i'm not gonna reply anymore 
---
I was going to say that Ds and Adrenaline are unfair bc I’m pretty unbiased on what fair and not between killer/survivor since I play both. But if you truly believe no-Ed is fair then Ds and adrenaline must be as well
---
Well it only *opens* when you're the last survivor. It will spawn and be visible as long as the amount of generators completed is at least 1 greater than the amount of survivors alive. 
---
There's a discord???
---
Holy shit you're lucky I've been a rank 1 hag for the past 5 seasons and I know people that are even stronger than me, if you want to, You can send me a discord invite and show you a discord dedicated to hag main and getting extremely strong with her, you'll be then able to be rank 1 viable as her because you have people that we consider to be teachers that played her since her release
---
&gt; I think Huntress axes are bullshit
---
lmao
---
Huntress whining is my favorite survivor tears
---
Get good at survivor so you know what loops they want. Aim low for medium and close hits. Don't forget you can throw through windows. Spamming slows you down, so wait 2 or 3 seconds after a hit before throwing again.
---
Also clown and map presence? Lol nah. All you can do is have chases so fast that you have time to walk to gens.
---
Yes that's right, thanks for correcting me on that 
---
&gt; even if you use small game then you are still going to spend a large portion of time looking for the totem
---
Not really, it doesn't take lot.
---
&gt; its second nature to me.
---
Hahaha, such bullshit lol. 
---
&gt;I forgot to report them but i've got the screenshot.
---
What exactly would you report them for? Unless you forgot to post more screenshots I don't see anything that would be reportable. 
---
&gt; wastes so much of the survivor's time but doesn't make progress to end the game while doing so
---
This is the best way yet I've seen it put
---
This works both ways. Killers thinking they're probably good at the game while the survivor is literally teleporting and unable to throw a pallet without a delay and then suddenly getting hit somehow when the Killer wasn't in range.
---
But playing the same perks all the time is extremely boring.
---
How do you outrun a sprinting pallet vaulting legion ? Eh
---
Imagine feeling the need to reply when you really didn't need to
---
^ this
---
I like to mix things up. But if there is a part of the game *you* in particular find very frustrating, run the counter.
---
You have 4 perks to play with, you'll still have 3 left over to play with.
---
It's not. This is probably a personal issue on OP's end
---
Not telling you gg after facecamping isn’t reportable. This is nothing.
---
I'm an Xbox killer main. Was having issues, but discovered I had strict NAT. Once that was sorted, it's been a lot better. Lobbies aren't too long, but I can see the issue people are having with framerate.
---
yes
---
Sounds like you dont enjoy this game tbh
---
That ground also has emotions you know :(
---
If you have it open listen for an ominous wooshing noise basically, but honestly just slug one dude and hunt the other its your best bet
---
Except when the survivor spawn literally right next to it. I won't run ruin until the devs fix spawn locations for totems. Most spawns for totems are literally right out in the open or right next to gens. As survivor I've literally spawned next to a lit totem no less than 4 times this week and to me that's just ridiculous.
---
I mean, sure? I guess wanting even more content is a valid point, but I think we are getting quite a lot anyway, I don't think there is a need to be picky.
---
There is no "playing it smart", due to the crappy map design sometimes survivors all run to a spot.
---
On Badham I've had loads of games where all 4 survivors run there constantly.
---
In fact last time that happened I couldn't even make it to the hook next to the generator and the fence, so the survivor broke free, ran down the basement again and got the hatch.
---
Some survivors run down there because they expect it to be safe, others do it because they know they can't be hooked. Like everything they exploit the hell out of it. Not to mention a 35% decisive strike is guarenteed down there.
---
They should just force the basement in the school.
---
As for the healing, they won't do that. Survivor mains would scream if they had to have 3 perk slots dedicated to it.
---
One thing is for sure, if it comes back in the same form everyone will be using it. The penalty to healing others is dumb, if its going to take someone 21 seconds to heal me due to their perk then I might as well take it and heal myself in 21 seconds.
---
I am not sure, I know they reworked some maps, but as far as I know no news about key items.They did say in their stream on Thursday, that Plunder's Instinct may be reworked to where you can get rare items from chests
---
Than why does is it take longer to find a game as a killer?
---
Survivor queue time, instant. Killer queue time, 5 minutes plus.
---
Is Slenderman a property now that there was a movie?
---
Thanks!  
---
But what is this?
---
they dont give any support
---
only release cosmetics because they are easy to do,if they do it for pc its like free for them to release them on consoles
---
the game was dead before go free on psn and it will be dead a year after
---
if games dont have problems with playbase they dont go live
---
Yeah, currently I run Bot knowledge, we'll make it, borrowed time and self-care (for when I take a hit for a unhooked survivor). I do try to do gens, if a guy is getting chased or downed across the map I'll try to finish a gen before I go and help them, and once at least 3 gens are done I go totem hunting to try and prevent noed.
---
Agreed, but it's still worth the risk to me.
---
Anyone can get rank 1 using legion because of the easy hits with Frenzy, no matter how bad they perform
---
Maybe not the right place but, what card should I buy to run this max settings 60 fps?
---
Is the sound bushes and grass make really that loud in the PTB?
---
I dont get it. Cleansing totem isnt hard lol
---
Ya it goes both way sometime u get frstrated with noed and simetime with adreline and ds.
---
Yeah, looks like we play pretty different roles!
---
PS4 
---
That’s usually an issue to do with the P2P connection instead in my experience, it’s avoidable by dodging a lobby if you’ve got a red ping. 
---
Nothing crutch about noed, it's a very strong perk that can also add intensity and excitement for both sides. 
---
it's space for both, if I could I'd swap lockers to Z since I'm used to using the key. 
---
Adding to this, the original brand new part completed the gen with a single tap, no skill checks, you just burned out the toolkit. The worst form of gen rush was when you'd get a full team running these insta-gens so the killer had maybe 2-3 minutes before gates were opened.
---
I don't mind killer using noed and it does indeed bring intensity to the endgame. 
---
5 totems are on the maps.
---
Feng Min's new outfit? STUNNING. Finally, we've been waiting for so long. Yaaaasssss!
---
So did I glad I'm not the only one
---
Cleansing all the totems takes a long time just saying lol
---
When you solo queue assume your teammates will be potatoes and play accordingly until shown otherwise. Prioritize your own escape over saving people. If you get found by the killer, assume you won’t be getting off the hook and give that killer the chase of their life which will either make them give up on you or give you enough points 
---
I got a question, do you need to get rid of all the dull totems in order to counter NOED, or if I get rid of a couple dull totems and one of them was gonna happen to be NOED that works?
---
Yeah because you know that McDonald’s WiFi is trash. 
---
Just use small game.
---
Nah, I enjoy it. I play plenty of games like this. For Honor, Overwatch etc. 
---
Anything that isn't equal and pure skill-based is unfun for me, but it doesn't necessarily ruin the entirety of a game.
---
Wraith sloppy butcher is bull. Even when healed I am pissing blood everywhere! Good luck hiding anywhere with a fountain of blood on your back! 
---
And yet everyone has the chance to get NOED no matter when they buy the game. 
---
Yes I was
---
Increasing the chance of Self Care skillchecks is always a good addition though
---
I hate when survivors fuck around in the exit gate area only to get downed and fall out and get an escape. But this really worked out for both of you! 
---
Yes I was the last survivor alive, honestly I do t remember the name of his perks but I guess it could have been possible that he had it, the for the answer
---
Healing in general now feels like a chore. I was actually fine with it being buffed.
---
I do well with him but I just want him to have a better reputation. I never see Freddy's when I play survivor and a lot of people say they don't play him because he's too weak. And survivors say he's unfun to play against although I disagree. 
---
It is a normal game mechanic. Its not new to recent patches. When you swing through a window the hitbox starts before the flinch from hitting the window comes into play, so you get a few frames where you can hit through the window.
---
Throw bottles in loops
---
BNPs are basically useless now. They absolutely shouldn’t be ultra rare add-ons anymore. 
---
Hell, even with SWF it can be tricky. If you remove all the totems placed right beside generators, then the only one hidden in a corner will be the NOED totem. But if you leave them, it will be placed right beside you at the final generator. 
---
Mainly doctor and freddy,
---
They have very diffrent playstyles from every other killer which is fine. but seeing as how the doctor completely removes stealth and freddy's power encourages tunnelling they just aren't fun to fight
---
Goals
---
Fuck it, if you run DS, you get camped UwU
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I think he's an Internet Creation and less of something penned by a single person, he should be Public Domain. 
---
Gonna double check and then edit with findings.
---
It brings toxicity when the killer doesnt deserve getting those kills and halving the amount of skill it takes for them to do their main objective. 
---
Yeah rank 4 killer on xbox and having the same issue.I think it's because most players are taking a break since we just had the double bloodpoint event
---

NOED chooses its totem when the gens finish.  You need to clear all of them.
---
The only difference in skill that's noticable is anyone 15-20 and everyone else after 15 I see good people, and bad people at every rank down to 1.
---
Wait it does say that they started a week ago though
---
Same. But i have never seen an old map offering. 
---
Ah didn't know it, thanks dude
---
Except the two guys that already died earlier 
---
I'm good, thanks
---
I like the idea but that would be an insane buff, the number should be tweaked for sure.
---
Looks like a salty survivor post to me. 
---
He was just the last person alive. 
---
No, this Huntress was a blatant asshole who would sit and camp me and the one other person she hooked and used a fucking lag switch.
---
(It's that old M&amp;M's commercial where Red screams "He does exist!" at Santa Claus and Santa says "They do exist!" before fainting)

I did this to a rank 2 feng on Mount Ormond (on stream) and I almost died from how hard my heart was pounding. I’m glad someone clipped it for me because we both thought it was gonna be impossible for me to get her

According to Wiki (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Frederick_%22Freddy%22_Charles_Krueger) they stack
---
I was mainly curious about the crteria by which content creators were chosen to represent the game...
---
Yes the block addons stack and they also stack with the Red Paint Brush too. 
---
PTB selfcare is a big fuck you to anyone who doesnt run it.
---
Lets say my 3 teammates run PTB SC and I dont. Well looks like im never going to get healed that match.
---
Yes it does
---
And the tire-stacks
---
I mean Ardetha said in this video : https://youtu.be/A4GX-XiUr4A
---
That he can hear peoples across the building due to the change 10:15 I believe is the actual parts and according to comments self care and legion change aren’t going to go to actual patch 
---
Lol, I ask myself the same question from time to time :D I have a small kid though, so maybe that's why &lt;3
---
If you're curious about the full video then here's the link, any constructive criticism is welcome \^\^ : [https://youtu.be/rBoJy7LUUk0](https://youtu.be/rBoJy7LUUk0)
---
Maybe
---
No, I mean those seem to be facts about the perks. Not much to say.
---
Prepare for downvotes, anything related to DS or NOED immediately triggers this sub. I think the comparison to Ruin over NOED is fairly accurate. 
---
Personnaly, i think DS'ing should give the survivor Deep Wounds (to negate the free health state), and the non-obession should be re-worked. 1 DS per game is fine, 2-4 can be cancer. 
---
As for NOED, maybe just immediately show the exposed effect when the gates are powered? I dont think its OP so much as its just not fun to play against. Hex perks *should* be good, by nature of being a hex. Also, end game builds add diversity to the game. 
---
All told, both perks need some looking at, but i think the complaints against them have gotten a bit overblown.
---
Looks like a list with facts to me
---
I was in a similar situation on PS4 with two friends. Games took forever to find. You’re likely the problem. I was a 7, but deranked back to yellow where my friends were and now we find games instantly for our entire session. Of course, the times you play is a factor too. 
---
Yeah, but unfortunately it forces you to not go for the obsession, which can be a bad thing sometimes.
---
I have [heard](https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/c/cd/FulliconAddon_disfiguredEar.png?version=e69ce3455a670d8a192566b9362cc279) the cries of my children. They have been subdued.
---
Okay but My point here  is we shouldn’t have to wait so long to find a match. 
---
Honestly even 3 man 4 generators is already significantly harder thanks 4 man 5 generators. 
---
I love this game but fuck the infinite loading times and the people who DC instantly.

You may have a point. Or 17.

Kinda weird that he stepped on a bear trap when the killer was michael
---
I'm used to it. This subreddit is full of crybabies who overreact about every little thing, and they HATE having it pointed out to them. I've never been involved in a community as entitled, bratty, and delusional as this one.
---
I'm sure the degenerates have lots of experience with people behind them like the filth they are 
---
Pallet new killer confirmed
---
A 'hardcore' more with no HUD and a limited hook aura would be nuts. If you've ever played against Third Seal you know how disorienting it can be. Definitely would encourage the horror atmosphere. 
---
I'm only playing Claudette for self-care. Once I get it for Feng Min, I'll play her allot more
---
Except it can make a killers game even though he played trash and it's not really exciting going against it. Overall bad design. 
---
I'm fine with keys and moris... And the old BNPs... Not with these two perks tho, they can fuck you up real good.
---
Yeah they need to carefully take it apart ad untie the strings if they cancel to process the strings retie themself or some bs like that i would be all for boot fucking them myself
---
You do realize prisoners can buy things to make jail more comfortable right?
---
Ahh yes the rub for 15 seconds and grunt ritual a very advanced ritual at that!
---
It’s just toxicity. I play Killer more than Survivor, and sometimes I just sit there at the menu title, mouse hovering over “PLAY KILLER” thinking to myself “do I REALLY want to get into this right now? Is my mood good enough right now to deal with this shit?”
---
And it’s sad, because this is a video game. I’m supposed to have fun with it in some sense. But with teabagging, Soft Landing infinite Looping, 4-Man Squadettes, and the abundance of Party Starters/Rare Items I just can’t enjoy the game.
---
And before I get swarmed by salty survivors, I don’t mind if you’re better/outplay me in the game. Just DONT be toxic. People complain about waiting times to find Killers, and then proceed to bad manner and bully the Killer in Chat, Profile Comments, DMs, it’s ridiculous.
---
Play the game. Loop me. Smash pallets on me all day. Once the Survivors start clicking flashlights at me and teabagging, I’m quitting the match and re-lobbying for new players. Do good at the game, swing me a quick “GG” after the game, and go onto the next one like me. 
---
Honestly if you need to bully/harass people in a Videogame to have fun, you most likely have some home or life issues you need to work out/see a therapist for. I’ve met some of the nicest respectable Survivors after match, and they are what keep me playing. It’s the salty, childish 4Man Groups and Twitch Streamers who annoy/harass on purpose that I hate.
---
I mean, I guess you're correct. The distinction isn't super important to me. Still, good camping wouldn't let them get the unhook without at least eating a hit, because they can then just bodyblock.
---
Personally I've stopped playing killer because there simply isn't much to do/learn anymore. Almost every match feels the same, with only a few feeling like real, somewhat competitive games. There's too many red ranks these days that just don't do generators, don't do well in chases, and aren't stealthy/efficient with their time.
---
I remember getting my ass handed to me consistently a year ago. I kinda miss that feeling.
---
You don’t always want to break the pallet if a pallet really unsafe you can just leave it as bait for another survivor 
---
There was one this past Thursday I believe
---
I think you're just thinking of Whispers in the wrong way
---
It wont let me watch this, do you mind giving me the link to the video :)
---
Well I just met him not five minutes ago
---
Or maybe just cleanse all the totems when the killer is a m1 warrior
---
thas hot.
---
He’s streaming rn
---
Because it means the player cant use exhaustion perks in a chase making it better to deal with. Also just keep it one time use? Why do people act like it's impossible to program stuff.
---
The part that is painful to deal with, exactly.
---
Or maybe let the adults have an actual conversation? 
---
I covered both perks. Unlike you, i play both sides regularly. 
---
Killer mains hate this guy
---
Perks are just that....perks. Pitting one against another is not going to prove anything or be productive when there are tons of other things that are available to both sides. Add-Ons, Burnables, and don't forget about Flashlights, Keys, Medkits, Toolboxes and Maps PLUS their Add-Ons. Also there is 2 exit gates and a hatch, there is perks that help survivors do objectives faster, see the killer and much much more. 
---
Is DS a bit of a crutch? Yes a little bit but as stated in the image has many downsides. 
---
Is NOED a bigger crutch? Yes and also as stated can be avoided by doing dull totems. 
---
Does anybody here actually give a shit enough to stop running the perks they like or use? No...
---
Some players like certain perks and use them. I have used both of these but didn't like the playstyle of either of them, but if you tell me running Sloppy Butcher or Iron Grasp is me being a bad killer or that running Borrowed Time and Balanced Landing makes me a bad survivor, it will fall on deaf ears as I don't actually care about others builds and their expectations of mine. 
---
We all can get any perk in the game with shards, we all can play as killer or survivor and we all just want to play a game without someone else telling us how to play it. 
---
What should be more concerning to the community is the fact that the game crashes all the time no matter how nice of a computer you have, all the while the "team" seems to be mainly concerned on pushing new cosmetics instead of improving connectivity and fixing the myriad of glitches/bugs that make the game an utter frustration to play at times. "how did that hit?" "how did that not hit?" "did that pallet stun really not work?" "who's hair is that flying all over my screen?" "Lithe works even though I am in dying state?" + tons of other WTF moments of this game. 
---
But survivors have items and perks that’s are not fun. 
---
As a killer main, I do believe that NOED is stronger than DS and refuse to use it when I play. That being said, good killers with NOED tend to be overwhelmingly strong; good survivors with DS tend to turn into potatoes and have their finger prepared to teabag at all moments, so I guess we can't say which would really be stronger.
---
There suppose to be a console optimization in the Spring, but don't hold your breath on that
---
Four survivors that may not all have the perk. Seems a little unfair to me. 
---
I rarely even play the game which is why I don't get all emotional like you do. Also, people could just play killer to get better and learn the perks and the game. In other games, like MOBAs, you are incentivised to play all the characters, not necessarily to get good at them all, but to learn all of their abilities so you can better your play against them. This change gives newer players-who would otherwise only play survivor-a reason to actually try killer to learn what the perks do. It's a positive change.
---
The lack of communication between players is a part of the game's original design. (Of course, SWF breaks that.) It's frustrating when it doesn't work out, but I stand by that idea that information should be limited.
---
The Bystander Effect is a real life phenomenon under which people are likely wait for someone else to step up. That being said, most players counteract this feeling by being VERY altruistic.  I've only, in one game, seen a team completely ignore someone on the hook and let them die. If anything I see the 3 man rush a LOT more. The altruism in this game is so high! Unsafe hooks abound!
---
This is a unique problem because it's difficult to enforce one way of playing the game. Even giving them auras - which I think should remain a perk as anything that gives information should not be default on either side - won't MAKE people save anymore than they were. You might have less clusters of people scrambling for the hook. Maybe. If people want to run for a hook, you can't stop them.
---
Well sure, but that is because they have other perks lol. They could never balance a perk by assuming that only one survivor could have it-- even if they could, how would that be fair? 4 survivors. 1 killer. By that very nature survivor perks have to be weaker.  
---
Ultimately its 16 perks versus 4. No single survivor perk can be as good as a killers, or the game would become immediately lopsided, even if only one survivor gets to have it.
---
Honestly - speaking as someone who has literally never equipped DS, and has dealt with it as a killer - I don't get why people are so scared of DS. A ton of people miss their check, dribbling is a thing, and if they DO get their skillcheck? Most of them get downed in a stupid place, and you chase them for another 10 seconds and down them. Very, very, very rarely is it some looping god who proceeds to extend the chase for another 2-3 minutes. 
---
Don't be a baby and just eat the DS. Standing still, taking it, and seeing a clear direction of where they're going (if they even hit it) so you can follow makes way more sense. Even juggling I think has downfalls. Who wants to get to the end of the game, gates open, the hook is too far to juggle, then they DS off? Shoulda just ate it in the beginning. 
---
You can leave slugged whoever you want to leave slugged. But with the change to slugging, where you can load your bar to 95%, it takes less than or exactly 1 second for someone to pick them up. Many DS users who aren't braindead run unbreakable as well. Slugging just doesn't seem like the best choice for the overall game.
---
I agree! It's a different game when you solo queue.
---
You really are downplaying how much time ds can waste. My friend is only pretty average at looping but ds can easily add another 30-45 seconds to his chase if he jumps off the shoulder to a good loop. That’s enough time for multiple gens to pop right there. Noed is strong as well but since i play with two friends we can take the totems out pretty quickly. It’s just another case of solos being exponentially weaker than swf groups. Also the fact that if you aren’t the obsession isn’t always a bad thing since then a killer won’t expect you to have it and won’t try and play around it. I’ve had times where I got striked trying to take them to a more defensive hook and that gave them time to hit me with it and I had no clue it was coming.
---
Yeah I refuse to use NOED and I rarely even use DS anymore. Ruin is the killer equivalent to DS but everyone seems to act like NOED is the exact opposite. 'Don't use DS if you don't like NOED' seems to be a favourite on here even though it's completely wrong. 
---
That caught me off guard, fuckin lel
---
Completely justified, playing Doctor on any map is a shit show
---
I wouldn't necessarily say Ruin is the killer equivalent of DS; I don't think there really is one. I'd say the exhaustion perks and Self Care are more aligned with Ruin since they also serve to buy more time.
---
I still think both perks are shit. At least Ruin is easy to take care of, NOED on the other hand is a surprise and can be hard to deal with because it's usually the best hidden totem that becomes the NOED one since all others have already be found and destroyed.
---
Decisive Strike is a perk that is pretty much a free escape from a hit and the killer can't do anything about it. I feel like it would be way better if it were an exaustion perk, that way you can avoid those times where you chase someone, get them injured, are about to hit them again, but they get away with balanced landing, you finaly get close again, but oh damn, there is adrenaline, yes, I finaly got them oh fuck decisive strike and they escape.
---
You have to use father glasses to see blood in phase walk and you don't need Bloodhound to see them if you equipped father's glasses(this addon has bloodhound built in).  
---
But tbh it's not so crazy addon you may think.
---
Laurie on average plays worst in my games. Killers, no idea.
---
Which tools do you use to make these renders?
---
And how long did it take to learn how to make these?
---
I agree that DS and NOED are annoying and that NOED has a hard counter that can completely negate its effect while with DS you can just lessen the effect. And that both are crutch perk for bad player but since the effect is so good they are abused by more experienced players. 
---
How many killer games did you have for zero hate messages? 1 game?
---
it belongs in a museum
---
Noed gamer reeeeeee
---
I hate keys and moris too because both of them feel like you're having the carpet pulled out from under you while having fun.
---
No, just tired of the same childish rhetoric.
---
Hurr durr JuSt cLenSe dA tOtEMs. What a fucking hot take that is. 
---
DS does have counters it just might not always be the efficient to use them. I think that maybe hitting it should put the survivor in the broken state so they can't heal afterwards. 
---
I've never had an active NOED.  All dull totems are always gone after the gens are done.  But whatever.  All hex perks are total shit anyway.  It's a no contest. 
---
I love that no matter how mediocre Wraith will be, he is the god of vaulting. 
---
Oh look, the pathetic whiner is still at it xD
---
I almost agree, but it should be 7% since hope also gives 7%
---
And less efficient. 
---
Dribbling and slugging aren't really hard counters. Not only do the survivors still have access to it if you later decide not to, but there also may not be a hook in range for you to dribble them to. Likewise, if you slug a survivor because they have DS, the survivor is still getting value out of it unless you're playing a slugging build anyway.
---
in theory:
---
the entire OP post
---
in reality:
---
killer downs and hangs one person and the other 3 escape through the other exit... na who am I kidding, they prefer saving the guy and then crying over noed in chat rather than leaving 1 behind
---
D I G I T A L      B L A C K F A C E
---
Ey my huntress is level 25 still so i had to use it xDD 
---
The game was over anyway. Also, I like how you complain about people using perks that bthey like. 
---
Yeah, that does make more sense to me.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write it out.
---
Why you bully him.
---
You should run away from him, not hunt him, he's the killer!
---
And I freaking love the salt in this subreddit, getting this much downvotes on such a simple post is like having a full swf -rep your steam, it just makes my day everytime!

I'm on PC and can relate. Used to run every map just fine, after a few updates certain maps are unbearably green.

Ahh right my bad I did just ignore ds completely and contributed something use less. I like the deep wound idea by the way, i just feel like they are both fine as is although I wouldn't complain about a ds change but it really wouldn't make sense if noed popped up immediately when all the other hexes involve interaction with its hexes purpose (getting a skillcheck for ruin to pop up etc etc)
---
PARKOUR! 
---
If you're getting 4kd exclusively because of NOED, it's because you and your team are playing like fucking idiots.
---
Aww that's actually cute. Well now you see, they do exist! Hope you encounter some. Ignore the salt, enjoy your game friend!
---
Right over my head lol
---
I feel like exhaustion would work better since most of the times when you use it, the killer will catch you a few moments later and put you on the hook, unless you mean broken for the rest of the match, the broken status effect will probavly be removed by the time they got unhooked
---
I don't get looped for 6 minutes
---
I think huntresses are often quite B O O S T E D on ps4 at least although it's really easy for a billy to look boosted if he misses his chainsaw. As for survivor i think dwight goes without saying.
---
I highly reccomend charging speed increasing addons(bloody hair brooch, White hair ribbon, Gifted bamboo comb) and addon you like (speed and reappearing time addons). I don't reccomend phase walking too long (so duration addons aren't neccesary) because the more time you spend phase walking the easier it becomes for survivors to loose you. That's why charging time is super important.   
---
Also if you want to play her really well, make sure you have decent headphones ;) Listen for footsteps, breath and crying. One of the most common jukes survivors are trying to do is to go back so make if you end phase walk after seeing that scratches ended and you cannot see a survivor, maybe check behind you ;) Spirit's worst enemy is Iron Will so you have to learn listening for footsteps (when they get fixed ofc).  
---
Try to predict their movements but not too hard cause you can easily juke yourself :D  
---
Remember that they don't know if you are phase walking when they're in your/your husk's terror radius. So you can easily confuse them on loops. Your husk has colission, you can use that to stand at a pallet and then phase walk(they cannot use the pallet).   
---
For perks I would reccomend ofc BBQ, may be ruin if you like it, MYC, Fire up(joke) and my favourite: Save the best for last. Why I like it? Because you can down survivors super quickly. You m1 a survivor, wipe your blade super fast so they don't have time to run too far away, then you charge phase walk super fast thanks to said bloody hair brooch and you down them :D You can combine it with rancor and ignore dses for all match ;) If it gets to end game you should mori an obsession :P And if it doesn't rancor is still useful because it shows you survivors' location.  
---
Somebody already talked about vault mindgame (she doesn't have vauling animation, she just teleport). Also my tactic is to move in really awkward way (like turning while chasing) because it can confuse crap out of survivor due to her passive phasing :D Sometimes they will just run into your loving arms &lt;3 
---
Oh wow, you're the guy who complained about NOED on the Nurse post. Dude, both of them are perks, no need to compare them. Noed is a hex, it should be powerful. DS is a one time use, it also should be somewhat powerful, otherwise its a waste of a perk slot for a one time use perk that isn't that good. 
---
4 x ds is way stronger then NOED change my mind.
---
It’s a sign of friendliness or just a way of being nice I would say, people who say things like “You’re garbage” just want to make you feel bad and ruin your day &gt;:( 
---
ah
---
I try not to judge players by their in-game appearance, I've run into default Dwights and Megs with godlike skill and I've faced P3 Squadette teams who go down without doing a single gen.
---
But if I have to give my impression, it's that for Killers generally Michaels, Spirits, and Hillbillys are always really bad or facecampers. That could just be red ranks on PS4 tho.
---
As for Survivors; it's probably David Ks. Megs and David Ts have a 50/50 chance to be really bad or really good, but almost every single King will go down in seconds; usually after farming someone, Dead Harding into a wall, failing 3 successive skillchecks, or trying to crouch behind an object that is a quarter of their size.
---
You're right, NOED should be powerful but not *overpowered* like it is now. And unlike the other hexes it's easy to come by since it isn't a teachable. Not to mention you only know the killer has it after all gens are finished and they already have one person down. 
---
Wow! This isn’t worthless!
---
&gt;after this patch if more than one person works on a gen its gets slowed for everyone on the gen.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators
---
Read the "Statistics" section
---
Then it's another entire problem, you maybe find playing DBD as a killer not fun and that's another subject. If your only fun is making other players angry and frustrated, then yeah, Legion is what you are looking for m8
---
Unless it is a very well coordinated SWF it's unlikely that every single survivor will have DS, whereas almost every single killer has NOED equipped after the buff.
---
He might have his messages set to "private"
---
these look amazing but i hope they look amazing ingame too ;;
---
Lured in is cool
---
Yeah, if the killer gets the skill check he should be able to body slam the survivor and reset his struggle.
---
why nsfw?
---
For the 2nd bullet point does it mean in addition to the 1k for unhooking person and everyone else gets 500, once the game recognizes the safe unhook everyone gets 500 more?
---
It's not "overpowered", an example of something overpowered is The Nurse, a good Nurse cannot be stopped, NOED can. If it's so annoying for you just destroy totems before the gens are done, search for the hex afterwards, hide until somebody opens the gate or wait until the killer is far away for you to do it. It is NOT OP
---
There's multiple ways around it, you know well and you chose to throw yourself into the killers arms. Doesn't it also show you the exposed effect the moment the last gen is done? I didn't get the "unknown to survivors until its too late". Is finishing the gen with no killer nearby too late?
---
The only idea that truly seemed like it would keep the diehard players at rank 1 would be a mystery box at the end of each season that has a chance to have exclusives in it life Golden Feng, maybe Dweard (black glasses) and more.  
---
Create the mystery box and make it so that every day (must play 1 game per day in that rank) in red ranks increases your odds of getting the exclusive loot.  
---
Any rank should be able to get that exclusive loot, but high rank and staying high rank increases chances. Over time add a few cosmetics to the pool that are mystery box only.
---
But usually if you've been in a chase for a while you would have used your exaustion perk and already be exhausted. Then when you get put on the hook the exaustion gets removes anyway. 
---
I don't believe you. You must strongly exagerate or have some sort of misperception of what is really happening in game.
---
Yeah although it would have to be removed as a hex and given 120 seconds to be the same as hope. 
---
I guess b/c I used potty language, or anticipated more potty language than I'd actually used. Lol.
---
AFAIK if you're past the "Detonation point" then you're good. The killer can carry you over and drop you and you'll be fine. I believe it wasn't always like this and was changed to stop Pigs abusing it for instakills.
---
 Check your NAT or something because most everyone is having the exact opposite problem because there aren’t enough killers. Not saying you should have bad queue times as a surv, but you shouldn’t have bad queue times as a killer right now unless your internet is bugged
---
This is an analysis from a dataset I recorded with a rank 15 killer. So the survivors dont have to be rank 15.
---
Yeah. The person doing the unhook gets the standard 1k +500, while all living (and 'participating') Survivors get 500bp on the unhook, and then 500 more once it's recognized as a safe unhook.
---
I've only tried it as killer between ranks 1-7.  When I play survivor ruin is a joke.  That could explain my results.
---
I almost never run hex perks anymore anyway as killer.  I love it when a killer is using ruin.  I immediately know it's a wasted perk slot, and I go on the totem hunt.  Somebody always finds it before me 10-30 seconds into the match.  "EZ Baby killer."
---
It’s going to be similar to the hallowed blight event wherein you need to collect lunar stuff as survivors and killers in order to gain currency to buy the outfits!
---
Getting unhooked when the killer is literally 5 feet away only to get downed instantly and then moried. Feels bad man
---
Yeah I’ve always had to wait a couple minutes to find a match as swf but last night me and my buds waited like 15-20 minutes for a game and got dodged. We just got on R6 after that and didn’t touch dbd the rest of the night.
---
This post is gold. That is exactly what I'm saying on this sub. DS is strong, right, but only on good survivors.  
---
NOED literally rewards bad killers, that will rank up not learning how to play the game and get destroyed by non-potato survivors in higher ranks.
---
Eh I’m not sure if I’m a fan of this idea. It’ll encourage more SWF teams where there’s one person who only baits the killer while the rest do gens. 
---
You don't see the exposed effect until somebody gets downed, not after the last gen gets done. Sometimes you finish a gen as the killer comes towards you and then immediately get hit by NOED before you can get anywhere. 
---
Yes, thats exactly what I mean. If you already used an exhaustion perk in the chase, you probably already cheated death in the chase so it seems stupid to then cheat death again with decisive.
---
This is exactly why I think it'd be a good change, they introduced exhaustion, do you couldn't chain sprint burst, balanced landing lithe and dead hard, I feel like Decisive should be added to this list. This would reduce the Decisive+Exhaustion+Adrennaline+Selfcare combos I see so many times
---
I mean, it depends on your motivation, but generally no, letting the last guy have the Hatch is usually a, very rare, courtesy or nice gesture. People on this game in general can be really salty though, regardless of your actions.
---
It's Freddy, he's already weak so it's pretty much the only way he can get kills. 
---
U ok Miss Hag
---
Which wouldn't happen if they hadn't made the unnecessary buff. 
---
They can still heal you, it's just a bit slower. Unless they have BK, then it's 8% faster. Or you could be using the new Leader, which would make it normal speed. Or they could have a medkit. There's a large number of ways to counter the PTB SC debuff, and even if you don't 25% isn't *that* big of a debuff, honestly. Like I say, I run SC a lot, it's primarily how I heal, even with sloppy, and I don't find even that delay particular problematic.
---
Can you change key bindings for specific actions or no? I’ve never tried changing the controls before so not sure 
---
Can't be true. People assured me "nobody takes Decisive Strike anymore".
---
Ruin, thana, OC, and weasel do next to nothing before the update. Especially against an organized team. 
---
It'd always been like that, the statement is just poorly worded.
---
But considering there are only 3 outfits instead of the 7 before, I'm not going to get my hopes up about being able to get more than one.
---
I saw a Macmillan ledger page not too long ago 
---
Abuse Pop goes the Weasel if you run it. You are very fast and have a far lunge, use that to your advantage when looping. To end chases fast, use Solvent Jug to give exhaustion and Flask of Bleach for hindrance. Addons that increase reloading speed are disadvantageous.8 
---
My personal Perk Build is:
---
Bitter Murmur
---
Iron Grasp
---
Whispers
---
Pop Goes The Weasel
---
Figure out where they are after the gen is done, hunt them with Whispers, hook survivor, smack a gen, keep hunting. 
---
If you have Bloodhound, Stridor and Predator here is my favorite meme tracking build.

Bloodhound

Sloppy Butcher

Predator

I dont think thats true personally but i cant argue your opinion.
---
Literally all of Legion's perks counter Dwight it's actually kinda funny lol. Discordance counters Leader, Mad Grit counters helping your teammates, and Iron Maiden counters lockers.
---
This is all messages. I used to hover over their game tag to send a message but now I cant do it on anyone. I've tried the past several weeks but this is the first time it really bummed me that I couldnt
---
High rank killers shouldn't really use NOED anyway. And survivors are usually more coordinated at that rank so they probably actually do totems when they see them, rather than only having 1 person devoted to totems. 
---
I just got the game and the game keeps crashing whenever the map is loading for me. It just stays on 99% forever

Louis - "When more people are working on a generator, each person is a little bit slower. Such that, if two people were on a generator, each one has -10%. It means they're doing 180% instead of 200%."

Not_Queen - "So that's why when two people get on the generator, your bar becomes red?"
---
Louis - "Because you personally are going 90%. ... This feature wasn't working, so we fixed it."
---
Not_Queen - "It's always been in the game, it's just fixed form a previous bug."
---
Louis - "If you are repairing a generator by yourself, it doesn't change the game. Two people, you get slowed by 10%. Three people, you'll probably notice a difference. It's still faster than one person, it's just slower than it was before."
---
Survivors definitely need more in match bonus BP generation perks. Killers have several, plus many killers have add-ons for even more. Survivors have... No One Left Behind and the new Prove Thyself.
---
Survivors just want easy wins. There is nothing a killer of average skill playing a killer other than Nurse, Billy, and maybe Spirit can do against a SWF group or even a good solo team that just buckles down and does gens. It becomes a math problem if Ruin is cleansed early.  
---
Ez fix... just use restraint class 2 or 3
---
good killers don't need noed because the game won't reach endgame
---
God, all stacks on STBFL look so satisfying 
---
Agitation gets them to the hook faster than iron grasp. Plus, it's more respectable
---
It's called dead by daylight 
---
Just try to tease yourself into postion if they crawl under the window while downed, works most of the time for me 
---
Fair point.
---
Why the repost?
---
See this is what people should look at. They are both get out of jail free cards, one just being a little more powerful than the other. Every game depends on the killer, survivors and other perks involved so a lot of the time people just base it off of one game they had which doesn't really work since games differ all the time. NOED is more powerful than DS but maybe not more than a 4 man SWF all running DS and bodyblocking for each other. 
---
I once made a sick locker juke because I accidentally went into one instead of vaulting a pallet. I think both me and the huntress were both surprised.
---
Just cleanse the totems. NOED is only a problem if you speed rush gens and allow it to be a problem.
---
I agree. Honestly, there should be more in the way of keybindings for specific actions.
---
I don't know how many times I've tried to thrown down a pallet only to start self-caring or begin healing the survivor downed at the pallet. Or better yet when you want to self-care but you waste a good pallet.
---
And then there's trying to vault a window only to be gobbled up by a locker that's too close.
---
You must never "win" then cause hatch is a thing
---
The most useful tip^
---
Yeah but the biggest thing is that NOED can be completely and entirely countered by cleansing totems, so yeah it’s powerful but so is 4 man DS and the only way to get rid of DS is to get hit with it.
---
No it's not letting me download it. Maybe the full game will be more different than.
---
GTA build character
---
Survivors have this secret handbook of rules that killers are supposed to follow. Unfortunately i'm a 50/50 player so i guess i didnt qualify for my copy.
---
Joking aside, dont worry about the opinions of postmatch survivors. They'll say whatever they can to get under your skin. The only "unwritten rules" to follow is not to face camp (stare in the face of a hooked surv) because that just gives other decent survs free time on gens and that its considered poor taste to purposely hit survs that are already hooked.
---
If you are pissed about hex builds just run urban evasion with small game. The killer will piss himself for sure
---
Salty noed gamers incoming
---
No, theyd have to be hugfing the wall for it to actually hit, so thats them being dumb.
---
The game keeps freezing for survivors in the loading screen and so the match will only be 3 or less people
---
Why be scared when you have Franklin's and no counterplay 
---
Downed a david when the gates were opened, and when i picked him up the other 3 left, I didn't have it in me to hook him so i carried him to the gate, let him wiggle off and watched him run out. 
---
Dude the auto lock tho like what the hell why are you making me aim there. My favorite part about it is you can't overpower it happens with billys saw too its the worst feeling when you are touching a survivor and you get "out played" by the game just because you tried to saw
---
You forgot the part of ds where It can change the chase from 15 minutes to 30 minutes with a good player. Might I add everyone who complains about ds is in higher ranks, thus everything you said about low ranks doesn't matter. Generators can be done within minutes so if this survivor can completely get around you do never catch them. It's almost guaranteed they'll get out 
---
You can think whatever you want to it doesn't make it true.
---
Its a bit too sci-fi for dbd in my opinion but she doesnt look like such a bad killer. Cant be worse than legion i guess?
---
Bloodhound is really good on legion, mostly to cover his weakness of being unable to follow scratch marks in frenzy
---
Ah okay.
---
Pretty interesting :)
---
I only used DS because I play the character I level, and people would demand that I use Decisive or they'd Disconnect.
---
It’s honestly making me want to purposefully derank because now I can’t play with a lot of my friends who are lower ranked without waiting forever to find a game
---
Today I learned I'm a thot.
---
The next offensive action part should be removed by I like that the perk forced you to not camp.
---
Oh boo hoo, you get to use it before tier 3. Wanna cry about it? 
---
Its probably just a survival with friends group. The matchmaking isnt 'that' broken in dbd
---
When you use a flashlight on a survivor
---
Found the killer main
---
Appropriate on this map
---
Is the new patch out yet or is it still in the PTB?
---
I can understand it in someway if the survivors being toxic or if the game is basically over but this guy started camping when it was 2 gens left with us havent doin anything toxic :/  
---
If you dont give hatch to these people you are a monster btw
---
4k on Freddy? Definitely not normal.
---
True at that last paragraph tbh. There are so many bugs in this game it's unreal. 
---
They changed it so you can't message a player by hovering over their name. You have to manually input their name and search for them to send the message.
---
If you’re one of those moonwalking legions expect multiple dcs. Legit no counterplay to that. 
---
Making wiki how pics into memes? I like it.

---
Given that the animations for healing, sabotage and repair are equally simplistic, I'd just assume that's it's a lot more intricate than it looks.
---
Realistically, it’s a 4v1 game, killer perks should be better in a 1v1 situation. You do have a point about the how it’s locked behind Laurie. Only equivalent I feel is bbq being stuck on leatherface. 
---
I don’t even care that much about either perk, but I felt that should be said. After all, in theory you can get hit with 4 d-strikes, not 1 per game. 
---
Hey man, we've all been there
---
Oooo this is good... more please!

Saving is possible, so its not facecamping. Even when facecamping was still a thing, being 6 feet away from the hook was not facecamping. It was only facecamping when the unhook prompt was blocked, because youre actually right up their face. 
---
You can unhook survivors and yes, youll get downed. Duh, you want to unhook a survivor with the killer close. Camping and facecamping by your definition is basically similar. You could argue that facecamping is still when youre right up their face, but when youre not close? How is it facecamping, but not camping? Or hardcamping? Its always easy to hit the unhooker and then down them

Monto helped me understand killers I was using wrong like the nurse. 
---
Okay thank you! Is there any word on when it's coming to live build?
---
Well the last paragraph says now youll notice a difference so i think theyve doubled down on what was previously a bug.
---
They played survivor before 1 week ago do you not understand? 
---
“What are you people doing in my killer shack?”
---
Prove Thyself is already getting this
---
I might be the only person who loves Freddy. If you know how to use him 4ks aren't that hard to come by. 
---
Honestly I rarely see it in red ranks anymore. I sss it a lot in lower ranks though.
---
There’s definitely a way because this video is from YouTube and it plays on my app, but when I post a video and out the link in my own post it gets redirected.

Totems seem to go lump after being rubbed enough.
---
Shooting a blood bank for BP
---
Nah, doesnt fit.
---
Haha now you know how it felt for killers when you blinded them before the update
---
Can confirm it has always been like this. 
---
Maybe I should have wrote "often" instead. Everyone fucks up sometimes x)
---
It's a post about being glad that a asshole killer DC'd, it's naturally gonna flame up salty killers.

---
What? I haven't played them yet but I thought he was considered slightly under performing?
---
So hyped, I knew they were gonna hit us with a banger new dlc chapter!
---
Well if a new player runs into loads of High Rank Killers, hed prolly stop playing the game.
---
Then we all need a support group cause the game would die.
---
Thats how mafia work
---
I'm saying frame rate isn't an issue.  Also as a survivor I queue pretty quickly. Unlike the rest of this sub I got nothing to bitch about 😏
---
Gens still go pretty fast. And I’m saying this as a survivor main. 
---
Its those kinds of survivors that make me play killer more frequently lately
---
If they’re on console the moba was probably smite, I don’t want them back :(
---
DAE "Super popular, 100 times repeated opinion"-posts shouldn't be allowed.
---
The killers are even bigger units though. Those that aren't tend to have some sort of otherworldly power. David is strong, but he's a brawler and probably hasn't fought a lot of people with knives. Bill is combat trained, but he's old as shit and probably more used to using fire arms than his fists.
---
Nah dude. Much more important to map a button of the controler with the important feature of reversing your controls with the press of a button. /s
---
I dont DC but I sure do try to die as fast as possible
---
1 Day in and already Top Post all the time :D Thank you
---
When you bring Franklin's it isn't about kills. It's about reminding them that anything can be taken from them even if they escape.
---
I know, it determines experience. I brought that up as a point against somebody else, actually. My point is I have time on this game.
---
I'm just concerned that he'll become better but boring. He's not great now, but I enjoy playing him.
---
Isn't it also canon that disobedient survivors literally get pitched into the fucking void, and get destroyed permanently?
---
I aware of how games start. Only one gens usually pops in that time anyways, than you would usually down somebody and the sniwball begins.
---
It really doesn't make chases that much longer.
---
Just another low rank survivor whining about how op the killers are
---
That must be why a team of 4 David’s can’t just start beating the shit out of a Hag or a Legion 
---
The same happens to me. I just got the game yesterday and I ended up just turning it off and going back to overwatch instead lul
---
If they make gens harder (read: longer) then I’d like a modifier to help genrush campers. Maybe 1.50x gen speed when the criteria for losing chaser emblem is met. Won’t affect killers who play normally but will effect the basement leatherfaces and other facecampers. If they leave the AOE for losing emblem, the modifier goes away. 
---
Hmmph, neat.
---
I don't think so.
---
It just looks like your organs comstabibly combusted to the point you collapsed at which point nock of jason used the force to drag you to his reach

---
is there a reason for why people dont use this build all the time?
---
I haven't been able think about any perks that would kind go with him though.
---
NOED isn't so much "rewarding" less experienced killers for "bad play", it's punishing survivors for not cleansing all the totems. And before somebody comes at me saying something like "but you don't know if all the totems are cleansed unless you're in SWF", not having all the information provided to you is part of the experience that's intended to be in the game by the devs.
---
Lullabys is hard to come by i guess?

Goodluck slugging as legion buddy
---
He's the Highest Devotion on Dead By Daylight across all platforms (Devotion 12). He plays Killer Main on PS4, and was interrupted during his stream on Jan 5th, where he was arrested for allegedly assaulting numerous amounts of women, burglary, and attempted rape.

---
Ehh, Bond works well against Legions, it can tell you if you’re wasting time running to an occupied gen, or if somebody near you is taking a Frenzy hit. 
---
Is it an opinion? Never in my post did I say ''Legion sucks'' or ''Legion is terrible''
---
Its the idea that surviors are so powerful that they can focus on nothing but gens and escape within minutes, more often or not its a complaint that the killer usea after not applying enough pressure however there are cases where some perks and maps can cause gen rushing to be an actual thing.
---
Thats my opinion on it
---
I know, but when it starts impacting the overall enjoyment of the game.. That's where things become finicky.
---
They BM while at the window. 
---
To put it bluntly, yeah.
---
The entire point is that you're losing rank for something entirely out of your control - somebody else disconnecting, which isn't fair.
---
Isnt this what they did to freddy?
---
Eh, he turned out fine
---
So many fond memories, I had to quit the skins were to much of a drain on the bank account. 
---
So you hit your first survivor?I hate these stupid posts.No effort put into them and nothing out of the ordinary happening.
---
The ability to pallet stun a killer is insignificant next to the power of The Entity!
---
Nurses calling, no one escapes death, hex ruin and bbq and chili. Those perks always do good. 
---
It happened when she was stunned while carrying a survivor
---
And yes, I did say I hate playing against him, but that's not even in the title, just basically asking if anyone else gives up when they play against Legion. I just happened to mention in the text that I hate playing against him. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if only half of the outfits are actually in the PTBs files and we'll find the remainder when the update is released proper, iirl that happened with Hallowed Blight
---
Can’t go against Legion if you only play killer *taps side of head*

What about a skill that lets you see other injured survivors auras for 1/2/3 seconds when you hit a survivor to the injured state within a certain radius

---
True. 
---
It's actually always been this way. Although the Devs did say it has been bugged but didn't state how long for. So what the patch notes really mean is a bug fix.
---
I didn't say that, but when things go from 'manageable' to 'flaming trainwreck' in a matter of seconds I get a little peeved.
---
Welcome to the game design.
---
You just cut off the part where I made fun of the Claudette. Nice try kiddo lol
---
NOED is easy to come by and shouldn't be as strong since anyone can get it. Teachable perks are supposed to be something you work towards getting so you are rewarded when you put in the time and effort to get there. Otherwise why not make every perk available to you the second you buy the game?
---
&gt;I half jokingly suggested was to make the survivor moriable after using ds
---
The fact its 'half jokingly' says a lot about you. 
---
Freddy has small character model and has no weapon in his hand (his hand is a weapon itself). His lunge is same as others. Hag had long arm, spirit has a sword, Pig has a retractable knife. They should probably change the swing he does, make him turn that torso to outstretch the arm. Or maybe everyone should just remember that it’s Freddy. 
---
When you nut and she keep sucking 
---
"they're literally cheating" What the fuck? No they are not. SWF is in the game, it's not fucking cheating. Having a fun match vs SWF is not next to impossible. Most swfs i face aren't assholes even though i'm in red ranks. Most are just people who want to play the game with their buds, not people who want to do everything possible to make the game unfun for the killer. Those exist, but are pretty fucking rare
---
That'd be him on his personal stream. I have no idea how often he streams though.
---
If you're interested you can follow him here - https://www.twitch.tv/mc_ote
---
ok
---
All they did was promise a december 2018 console optimization patch, that never came. Now all they care about is to make sure dedicated servers will work.
---
Console players get the shaft once more on this game (reason why I stopped playing roughly a month ago)
---
bloodhound because it makes it impossible to counter legion on your own 
---
you just look down and follow the blood trail
---
they cant get away to heal the deep wound and if they try you will catch up and down them normally. and since looking down at the blood wont count as being in a chase the timer will go down on their own creating a no win situation for the person you are tunneling 
---
like how bubba thrives at basement camping the legion thrives at tunneling
---
remove Legion, Legion is awfully designed and so on is repeated over the entire internet. 90% of all people say they are awful. So yeah, your post is: "DAE BREATH AIR?"
---
I don't think people would use in-game chat if the killer can hear ever. It sucks because it'd be fair, but there's no good way to block players from using a 3rd party voice chat and have that advantage.
---
I single out these people I make them pay for their sins
---
Thats a fine alternative. Just anything to increase the games timer.
---
It bothers me that we never get a real resolution to this episode. Does the gang kill the serial killer or not? It’s never mentioned again.
---
Well, I noticed a strong biased writing style. True or not. It is incredibly biased. 
---
So you have problems with newer players/ less skilled players posting their small accomplishments? Hmm interesting 
---
The other one was made at 6 am european time, would figure maybe during 3 pm european time resp9nse would be different
---
Nice hit  especially since you can’t hear footsteps currently 
---
Yeah, I’ve only been playing for like 1.5 years and I’d say about half of that time has been in Arena, with my current focus being Conquest and you’re right, it’s either a 20 minute snowball, 10 minute surrender or 90 minute stall fest that makes you want to kys
---
It’s just a video game dude.
---
Pretty simple throw the bottles at loops and windows and if your in the open aim the bottle in front of them 
---
Couldn't have said it better. Being survivors =/= being friends. If I need bloodpoints I will try my hardest to escape, even if it means sacrificing everyone else.
---
If I get found first so be it, I'll try my best to keep the killer occupied for the most time possible!
---
Dribbling *can* negate the perk, but even after the hook density buff you aren't going to be able to do it every time, especially against decent survivors that go down far enough away. This isn't to mention that bodyblocking or flashlight plays pretty handily county dribbling. This would only be a hard counter if you could dribble infinitely, and even then, not a particularly good one.
---
Slugging also isn't a hard counter because unless the killer is running a slug build anyway, they'd much rather have you on a hook. It also doesn't prevent use of DS if they actually do have to pick you up. It's the reason you see DS so often run alongside Adrenaline (which is good enough on it's own) or Unbreakable (which is at least situationally useful even without DS.)
---
Both DS and NOED are busted and in dire need of reworks but the only "hard counter" to DS would be Tombstone Myers, since you don't even have to take hooks into the equation, unless they do some cheeky shit like hide in a locker so you HAVE to pick them up. While NOED can be completely removed from the game before it becomes active by cleansing totems you can only reduce the effectiveness of DS, never ignore it.
---
It do be like that sometimes though,  like i just want you to leave so i can go to the next trial.
---
Oh sorry. I usually equate "not fun to play against" with "op or slightly op"
---
I know the sound partially is messed up, I don’t think scratch marks are though 
---
You conveniently forgot to include that decisive strike has been in the shrine seven times. It's always an auto buy. The only people who don't have it unlocked are brand new players or players that don't like Lori's perks to begin with. Get over it. 
---
I was trying today to message a randy to let him know the killer had noed but it was impossible and they popped final gen and all died, they were a swf group, i play solo
---
Sorry dude let me just sit in the lobby for the rest of the day
---
That won't change anything because deep wounds is worthless for the killer.
---
Exactly 
---
&gt;But survivors are weaker than killers anyway.
---
*Laughs in de-pip squad*
---
No problem, edited the post a little bit so people don't think that that's what I was talking about. 
---
Than, Bloodhound, deerstalker, Sloppy is what i run usually with never sleep and susies
---
hmmm...why? :/
---
Most legion games will end in 2K, the problem is that you cant loop Legion no matter what you do so if he finds you and decides to tunnel you there is nothing you can do to stop it.
---
And it isn't even a quick death, he will hit you in frenzy twice, leave you alone for a bit, hit you in frenzy again, leave you alone and finally hit you one more time and hook you. Repeat that 3 times and that's how 90% of Legion players work
---
Save the Best for Last. Every time you hit a survivor that isn't your obsession, you gain tokens. Each token gives you decreased cooldown speed from a successful attack.
---
The killer was trapper. 
---
But it's a win!
---
Well, there's a more reasonable idea.
---
I didn't read the intro and you got me so hyped up, I though these were real. They should do some of these, it would definatelly make Amanda SO much better. 
---
Dracula new killer confirmed.
---
How? There is like no counter to frenzy lol
---
And brand new players that don't know how to play killer are cheating the learning curve by bringing noed every game because they got it in their first ever killer bloodweb. Bad survivors won't even hit their Decisive or gain much distance if they use the perk anyway. Also you spelled Laurie's name wrong so I don't really think you're very experienced at this game anyway. 
---
4x BP gain from every category.
---
The dream world lighting has killed my desire and ability to play Freddy. I’m colorblind so now I have trouble even finding survivors that are highlighted outside of my terror radius. I can’t even find my Ruin without staring at walls for 10 seconds! Remove the lighting change and I would main him again.
---
You mean, like this?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdI8-GDSMns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdI8-GDSMns)
---
There is no counter, it was just an incompetent Legion.
---
Yeah, if they had a dc, I know the last survivor was getting farmed earlier (unhooked unsafely right in my face), etc. I’ll do my best to get them the hatch.  If not, I’ll just try to go for the 4K, and honestly they’re more likely to hatch than not anyway given how that system is balanced (I’m not gonna do a hatch standoff).
---
Why didn't they do something though? 15 minutes and they couldn't finish the last gen. Hiding out and waiting for the other survivor to get caught is kinda childish imo. Just work on a fricking gen for gods sake. 
---
That's the joke
---
Huh I made a meme just like this with leatherface and Claudettes a few months back od
---
Oooo okay!!! Thanks so much :)
---
Survivors want to get out of the gates as soon as possible, it's perks like NOED that prevent this from happening because now they need to look for the totem to rescue their buddy that would have made it to the exit if it wasn't for NOED.
---
Maybe the developer's vision on certain things can be wrong. Fun fact: NOED first had a timer and wasn't a hex perk
---
As a killer, Its always great to see someone incapable of playing the game try that nonsense. You just smack the bastard and see if they keep it up and enjoy the postgame salt when they start whining that their team was trash and didnt save them. Bonus points for the classic locker pointing, smite the weakling and nod the locker guy off on his way out
---
Sorry I forgot to switch out my sloppy for whispers in the middle of the game, I'll try that next time
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I play on both ps4 and PC, though lately almost exclusively ps4(because of friends). Honestly there are perks to both platforms. 
---
The killer queue times on ps4 are tremendously better, across all ranks at all hours.  There's a lot more variety in the red ranks on console as survivor than just Nurse/Billy over and over again.  As survivor, it's much easier to successfully 360 killers since both players are on joysticks and killers have relatively limited sensitivity options. 
---
On PC I think the SWF queue times are generally faster, at least during off peak hours, though it could still be an issue. With your build, there would be performance increases in the game, and skill checks would not skip as much making consistent greats possible.  It likely wouldn't always be perfect, but generally a good improvement, especially on killer(less lag on corn maps/as doctor/when bloodlust activates/etc.).  If you enjoy huntress, she's so much more fun and powerful with a mouse than a controller.  It opens up nurse as a much easier to learn and play killer.  Also, having access to the PTB to see content early is nice as well as getting updates first is good. 
---
Overall if you're a solo survivor player, it's probably a more fun experience on console(despite performance issues) than PC, especially in the red ranks. If you're a killer main, you not only have better control over your character, but less framerate issues holding you back from performing well.  It's much easier to punish players who try to 360 when you have a mouse and can turn to any direction you need instantly.  Though playing killer is largely a better experience on PC, queue times can sometimes get pretty high(10+ minutes), even during good hours.  It depends on what you're looking for out of switching platforms on if it's worth it to you.  PC is generally just a better version of the game, but still has problems.  Switching may or may not improve your experience much depending on what you play and which problems you're looking at resolving. Buying the game and all that DLC again is a hefty chunk for possibly not even a better experience, but it may be worth just getting the base game at first and seeing how much of a difference it makes in the areas you're looking for then see if it's enough better to justify the rest.
---
I'd be glad to share more insight if you have any questions about things.
---
I'm not bitching. If I was bitching this post would not have any upvotes at all. The post itself is very open and only really states facts. A good killer has no reason to use NOED, counterable or not. If you choose to use NOED then fine that's your choice but just remember it really shows your lack of skill as a killer. 
---
In ranks 8-1 I find this perk pops all the time.
---
Extra fun when one of the survivors is trying to bait me into a chase, but I just ignore them and go grab another or disrupt their work.
---
How stupid can you be? If you suck at tracking (and I can see that you do), use tracking perks like whispers. Don't cheat or do drugs. Stay safe in the fog, cheater. 
---
Cheater: "no, I am for sure telling the truth. It was a long amount of time"
---
Yeah, not atypical for cheaters to contort the truth to appear more acceptable. So no, I dont believe you. You showed your colors and proved you cant be trusted so my logic does make sense.
---
Hit the guide button scroll to the people tab and hit recent players
---
Too bad assholes in here might downvote you because they don't care. They will try to take you down because you're proud of your accomplishment for some reason.
---
Your fine friend he's just talking out his ass. Pressure is important and a useful skill but the truth of the matter is unless your playing a killer that can exert pressure in the first place you can't really utilize it. Play billy and you have built in immense map pressure , combine that with slugging and things grind to a crawl. Try the same with someone like wraith or freddy and you'll just get looped forever , break the chase you waste the time that chase took and the time it took to find that survivor and the time it takes to find the next only to find out the next survivor is an equally strong position/runner.
---
Point is while pressure is important its highly dependent on the killer your playing the map you spawn on and the skill-level of the survivors your facing.
---
Why does it even matter if you get a 3 or 4k?
---
That has to do with the ping and lag though, not FPS.
---
Yeah track two healthy survivors not running. Easy. Now you're just pulling insults out of nowhere 
---
Of course! Happy to help a fellow fog traveler! ;D
---
Yeah. I've actually been in this situation before, last 2 survivors screwing around for like 10 minutes. It happens. I just ended up hard dcing so they didnt get any points. Can you not put yourself in that position and see how childish that is? 
---
You are most definitely bitching, none of the things you said were "facts". Even if you're a good killer (and aren't using the nurse) you need to hit them twice, but you also have to keep in mind that at least one gate is gonna be open and that hitting them will give them a speed boost that they can use to get to the gate, and then there's bodyblocking. 
---
You can't. Unless you either farm or give the last guy the hatch the chances of getting nice messages is too low.
---
I either slug then or eat it. Depends on where in the game we are.
---
Which is exactly what they were going for. Now look at all this free advertising they’re getting 
---
She can go through walls, floors, hills, the entire fucking map... There is a reason why she's considered the best killer in the game.
---
The legion is already really annoying to play against but when I get a legion with Frank's Mixtape, I just want to DC.
---
USE WHISPERS, NOT CHEATS.
---
Gotta get Susie 
---
Except NOED is pretty reliable at guarenteeing at least one kill that you shouldnt have gotten because its impossible to run away from the killer when its end game and most pallets have been used and the killer moves 4% faster. Since we shouldnt have a reliable anything then it should be nerfed. I dont think you get it, I dont want to completely neuter the perk like they did to BNP, just remove the movement speed buff and it will be fine. That buff is so unnecessary. Its like if DS gave you a 4% movement speed buff after hitting the check until you got downed again. 
---
and dont kid yourself, NOED does reward bad killers. No good killer lets the game get to end game so they dont need to rely on NOED. 5 generators got completed? Well you get to move at sonic speed and have a permanent insta down until the hex totem (that you know where it is) is destroyed. But dont worry solo survivor, just cleanse all 5 dulls and do all 5 generators while saving people from the hook and getting chased by the killer to counter NOED, its that simple :\^).
---
We are here for you! 
---
Goddammit 
---
Forgot to mention the devil’s gift, 35% Decisive Strikes. These are the absolute worst. You’ll never see it coming and it gives such a huge tempo swing to survivors as you’ve already got the obsession’s DS to worry about 
---
I posted this here to see if what I did was acceptable because of how long I waited. If it truly was a short time I wouldn't have posted anything
---
What is you sample size?
---
How many games/hours you used to acquire the data?
---
Yeah...you know once you try to pull out spelling mistakes as some sort of argument you know you're fucked :) I have 800 hrs split over killer and survivor. I know both sides of the game pretty damn well. 
---
NOED and DS are crutch perks. Any experienced player will roll their eyes when they see the obsession status playing as killer or a hex notification after all the gens are done and a teammate is downed as a survivor. 
---
Yet all of these can *easily* be countered. DS doesn't make a survivor OP but in the hands of an experienced survivor it can be incredible. Same for NOED. Yet it's so glaringly obvious that you would rather complain about a perk that can be erased from the game before it even activates.
---
You know what ranks have the most DS and NOED? Green and purple. Very rarely will I play or see a killer in red ranks using NOED because they realize (as all good players) it's not worth a perk slot unless they're running an end game build.
---
First person to get hit by NOED is unlucky. The rest need to GTFO of the exit gates. The longer you stay in the game with it activated is only playing into the killers strat. You want to decrease the number of people using NOED? Don't allow a killer to kill more than one person with it. Fucking simple. 
---
Survivor stupidity is the only way a killer you're devising in this strawman fallacy can do so well. This comparing perks between survivor and killer screams inexperience and saltiness. They're two of the most annoying perks to deal with for *unskilled players*. :) 
---
If there’s more than one gen left, don’t camp and if someone saves near you, go for the saver and not the saved person
---
Noed also, you often would have made it to the exit, but NOED prevented this
---
It is a crutch.
---
And it creates too many boosted players.
---
The crutch part is more obvious when four rank 1 survivors escape a hillbilly without being hooked once. If the killer rolls up to high ranks on the back of NOED, and proceeds to get ruined by real players with high skill, it's a crutch.
---
I hate fast 4k nurse games, but I would spend 10 minutes as a slug before I suffer through a game where I lose because of Noed and the killer score is lower than all the survivors.
---
No. Devour Hope, Haunted Grounds, and Make your choice are in the game now. We are really close to removing NOED. 
---
Whispers is just an okay perk and you can't predict what will happen in a game
---
You can't. People will always get upset about something. There will always be those who whine about losing. I wouldn't worry too much about it. A lot of survivors like to try and enforce some weird honor code, when your only goal is to kill them. 
---
As for telling with a survivor, I wouldn't let a killer's playstyle bother you all too much either. At the end of the day, it's a game after all. If they're camping you, just stay on the hook as long as you can and hope your team ignores you and does gens. If it seems like they're tunneling you, they either are because they want the kill or they are because you're the only person they keep seeing. 
---
I'll let you in on a secret. 
---
Almost every killer perk in the game is to prevent survivors from escaping. :) 
---
Yeah, sure I totally believe you now. You're just an 100% honest guy going through some hard times.
---
Part of the point of wiggling is the opportunity to escape. If there were always hooks within wiggle distance then there would be no point in having the wiggle mechanic. Part of being a good killer is forcing Survivors into unfavorable positions near hooks. Your lack of map knowledge expressed by having to look for stairs shows you have room to learn instead of complaining about RNG being broken.
---
That's actually how you fix a generator irl. SMH, people here not knowing anything about the real world
---
Thats how mafia works
---
But on the flip side, 2 generators left, how is the survivor supposed to get them done with the killer only has them to focus on? They won't unless the killer is really stupid, so it'll be an automatic win for the killer. Hatch at least allows for the chance for survivors to win.
---
I just want something to deal with hatch standoffs. I still liked the idea of killer being able to close hatch. I just say they can't do it instantly. Maybe if a survivor doesn't escape after like two minutes, the killer can close hatch then? Idk.
---
There is only one hatch on the map  and you can see it even before it opens. Be on the lookout while you're searching for survivors so when it does open you'll know where to go.
---
Yeah I get it feels bad. 
---
If you want to try to prevent the perk run small games.
---
Even as a solo survivor and without small games it's not impossible to just go around the map looking for totem.
---
 Tedious yes impossible nowhere close
---
Shit, just made me realize a vampire would be a cool killer
---
i’d love to be able to draw a fucking cat. then maybe i could advance to concept art in 7 years or so...
---
Oh hey, thanks for the gild!
---
I feel like your purposefully excluding the counter-play options both perks have. 
---
For ds hard counters you either have to slug the obsession or juggle the obsession to a hook if its nearby. Soft counters include enduring and unnerving.
---
For noed hard counters you have to either find and destroy all 5 totems or wait until the end of the match and destroy the active noed totem. Soft counters include small game and borrowed time.
---
So lets look at these objectively at rank 1 for both parties , assuming the group of survivors is a swf and they are all moderately skilled they will ALL be running ds , thats 4 different near guaranteed escapes. All of these survivors will likely survive for at least an additional 30 seconds adding up to 2 minutes of time the killer could have been exerting pressure on the remaining 3 survivors on gens. Nearly 2 complete gens all for hitting an easy skill-check.
---
Compare that to noed , well at rank 1 most survivors will be looking for ruin anyways so they probably destroy anywhere from 1-3 totems trying to find ruin. This leaves 2 potential toems for noed to spawn on assuming no other hex perks. Assuming survivors assume noed because of the killer you playing then finding 2 totems isn't all that difficult , almost trivial if one survivor has small game. So realistically ds is the far superior perk because it can be used at any point in the game and has far less effective counter-play.
---
Are you from the 90s? What the fuck is that monitor resolution...
---
Congrats. Try to get further next season. I managed to do so this season for the first time too. You'll make it.
---
Doesn't matter what he does if you act like an entitled cunt, people are just gonna call you an asshole like I did, entire of reddit is an echo chamber, both perks are fine but if they weren't in the game I wouldn't be complaining either.
---
Stop sounding like an asshole dude
---
But people say this game isnt balanced around SWF but then expect solo survivors to deal with perks like NOED...how can you say one thing and also say the other?
---
Also you kinda proved his point. DS can only really be taken advantage of by good survivors while NOED can only be taken advantage of by BAD killers.
---
yeah. i shouldve gotten it before already but idk it bugged or something
---
I was getting chased and couldn't vault windows
---
How does a crutch create boosted players? What is your definition of crutch perk? 
---
" A crutch is a figure of speech that describes something that is used as a [**surrogate**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=surrogate)or substitute for a more [**ideal solution**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ideal%20solution) or approach "
---
If it is the best way to win games, it by definition can NOT be crutch perk. 
---
But you let the dumbass get away!?
---
Written with a rather clear Survivor bias.
---
No it means I didn't spend my time whining about something and I actually took an action to prevent something I don't want to happen. 
---
This is one problem I have with the community on both side a lot of you people will complain about a problem yet take no measures to actually mitigate the problem.
---
If you think doing it naturally is too difficult then equipped small games if you don't want to do it then don't complain about no one escapes death.
---
You know what you could also do leave the match I've rarely had matches where everybody has survived till endgame only for us to be completely wiped out because of noed mainly because nobody is that stupid.
---
If I'm worried about no one escapes death I cleanse totems because I actually like mitigating the problem more than I like bitching about it.
---
 if I wasn't able to enough totems and noed gets activated if I get downed I'll take the death if there's no way to save me or if I don't get down I'm leaving
---
Actually, survivor gameplay is stable, but killer gameplay... Well it's better but still 20 ish FPS.
---
Uh a minor question, did the game happen in Lery's with the killer being the Cannibal?
---
Posts like this. 
---
underrated comment, exhaled aggressively through my nose
---
If I want to camp someone solely because they have DS, I will. 
---
I don't play by made up survivor rules.
---
It's almost as if Killer perks are worth four Survivor perks, or some crazy shit like that...
---
Sorry for the post that's longer than Freddy's lunging range, but the tl;dr of it is pretty much sheer dread that the rework is going to make him borderline unplayable for the 12 Freddy mains that have taken the time to learn his ins and outs until we readjust to what could be a far more boring killer.  If they go through with this then I want some sort of Freddy Legacy or something.
---
(Also some salt about how bad Doc is was mixed in lol)
---
I like Devour Hope because it's something you earn. Noed is just there and doesn't require anything from the killer and then there is the increased movement speed that not many people mention, but they really should. This 5% increase gets a lot more people killed than it originaly should have killed because it's easier to hit people
---
Was in a hatch standoff, didn’t wanna waste time
---
Well her hitboxes are pretty bullshit, just in favor of her, back when they tried to "fix" it they were useless
---
what does it mean to slug?
---
We need a cultist that actually worships the Entity
---
There is no counterplay.The legion was either braindead or farming.
---
Yeah I always 100% give them the escape if someone left or something stupid like that 
---
I do not need to mention counterplay. I simply was talking about how both perks "scale with playerskill, whilst noed is good even on a shit player". It was all about the idea of how much they interact with player experience/knowledge/skill  
---
If we want to talk balance, DS is much worse than NOED could ever be. I don't mind to have them both removed tho.
---
It's not going to be a complete scrapping of Freddy's power, so we can take solace in that. 
---
I'm on step 8 of this meme right now. I switched from the unicorn block and z-block add-ons to Nancy's Masterpiece and I'm never going to look back. Still trying to decide what add-on to pair it with, though.
---
Lol
---
I'm ready for the downvote hell and people arguing in the comments. Controversial here I come
---
noed is only overpowered against survivors that refuse to use stealth in any form because they're just too mlg pro looper survivor mains to do that noob shite. truly epic gamers.
---
Quoting myself
---
&gt; Any rank should be able to get that exclusive loot, but high rank and staying high rank increases chances.
---
Maybe. I think that they honestly didn’t see any of us bc we were split up and hiding well. 
---
Okay, so to clarify, yes, I agree that survivors need an opportunity to wiggle and that's a good thing - I play survivor too. That's not what this is about. While yes, I don't know the meat plant map too much (which by the way changes drastically each time with barely any noticeable features for reference unlike other maps), I can't exactly force someone into the area I want while I've been chasing them for a fair while they have the advantage (Lots of pallets/windows). When I finally downed someone, there were two options: Trek across the whole bottom floor to one of the hooks, or try and find the stairs, which were also far away.
---
The point is, I shouldn't be FORCED to go upstairs to have even the slightest chance of a hook. There should be at least a medium chance of getting to a hook downstairs. Yes, there should be a chance the survivor could get off my shoulders, but equally, I should have the OPPORTUNITY to get to a hook since there was no other survivor intervention (e.g. body blocking/sabotaging)
---
I'm not the best killer by far, but as both survivor and killer, it's annoying to be screwed over by the map.
---
ur braindead
---
even if u cleansed the totems then congrats u wasted time cleansing totems and ur team probably got killed because in the current state of the game u have to rush gens
---
Then dc you prick.Or find and kill the survivors.In fact there is a perk just for that called fucking whispers.
---
After the event I was planning on taking a break, start a game as killer intending to depip while farming for remaining trophies, survivors start getting cheeky to an assumed baby killer, I get tilted and tryhard. End up pipping with a 3k.
---
Repeat several times, hit red ranks last night. ..fuck
---
&gt;She comes up to me at the hook, nods her head, and leaves.
---
End of the game? She gets hooked by the gate, I run up, T-bag her, and leave. She dies. I was the only one to make it out.
---
That's how mafia works.
---
Not a fan of Ace's mohawk.
---
"Boohoo, I can't stand not being able to rush gens without being impeded a little bit." Sounds like you're the braindead one.
---
She's indeed a woman of culture.
---
When I see killers heavily guarding their hexes with TOTH, I just cleanse the dull ones. It's pretty obvious to me when the killer is setting up for NOED.
---
*The Hag is pretty much fuelled by a desire to eat human flesh*
---
TL;DR: I could have done better myself, but then the map could have been fairer.
---
yep no brain activity here, 'impeded a little bit' because action economy doesn't exist and survivor is waaayyy too op right now
---
In the beginning of me playing and I mean WAY beginning playing I would stick kinda close but now playing I feel bad getting the person I hooked twice already done instantly if that happens I usually leave them so they can have a second chance I try to play as pleasing as possible and clearly giving people an escape but Xbox players just get so mad so idk from time to time I’ll get a gg thanks or something but not all the time and that’s why I’m confused about this
---
Yep, I'm definitely sensing no brain activity from you.
---
Plz no booli Quentin he already doesn’t get sleep and he gets chased by a crazed murderer every day. Just let him get some god damn sleep for once ;-;
---
guys i'm dying laughing this may may is too funny!! le ebin mafia city memes XDDD!!!
---
I will d/c every game against him until they either remove him entirely or rework him. I really don’t care. I bought the game. Not playing against that “killer” who’s design is the worst in game dev history lol
---
I’d like to learn how to play Freddy since I find his whole play style pretty fun when people aren’t just Self Caring and waking up in your face! What are your favourite perks, add ons, builds, etc. if you don’t mind educating a Freddy newb? 
---
If the hatch didn’t exist in that scenario, instead of complaints about hatch escapes we’d get “Every game the last survivor keeps fucking hiding and doesn’t do gens, I can’t find them. They are holding the game hostage!” As if they expect a survivor to just hop right on a gen while they are doing nothing but patroling so they can kill them. People would be wishing for the hatch to come back.
---
dude is this middle school, you just turned my own insult back on me wow i'm gonna cry now 
---
true freddy mains know that class photo is better than the stupid double block combo, "yeah im gonna play freddy like a standard killer why am I losing"
---
Dude it's because these types of posts flood the subreddit. You can be proud that you got to a high rank without telling everyone on Reddit.
---
That's what I'm saying. Survivors have 16 perks+ 4 items. I can't possibly counter every single thing they throw at me. And that's always what I hear about any legitimate killer gripe: "just run __". It is far easier for survivors to counter killers than vice versa, especially in premades.
---
lmao true
---
That's not even a good build for noed. I think it's better to have no totems if you want noed to go off, or only hex ruin. If you have any more, survs are just gonna cleanse all of them. I agree with you that noed is stupid, though.
---
You're brave to try and have a discussion about DS and NOED on this sub. People here get over-sensitive at the topic. Surprised to see few of those folks on this thread tho
---
You just deserve a permaban.Honestly if there was a way to find your username I would just send it to the devs myself.Such an entitled prick.There is a whole perk called whispers to help you out at tracking you fucking dumbass.But you are just an asshole who tries to justify his actions.I hope you do get banned somehow.You are the people that ruin the community.In everyone's eyes you are no better than ochido.
---
Its mostly devour hope in my experience
---
Slugging means to send a player to the dying state without picking them up and hooking them. If you stay too long in this state, you will bleed out and die. It's an alternate way of killing survivors, but a lot of players dislike it because it is both inefficient for the killer and very frustrating for the survivor.
---
And? 
---
"Action economy", yeah because gen rush isn't a thing and survivors totally don't need to be slowed a little bit via cleansing totems or suffer getting insta-downed. /s
---
If it's just an increased "chance" then that's not enough motivation. You gotta take away their chance to get it if they're lower rank, in order to keep them from deranking.
---
But that's how I see it.
---
Yea, killers have four perks and survivors total have 16. Such a dumb, tired argument. 
---
The amount of times I hold down for a lunge attack only to have it do an auto aim short attack whiff is almost enough to make me quit gaming the rest of the month.
---
That’s usually when I do it when a DC happens or they get destroyed in the first 3 minutes 
---
If you intend on cheating, you should be punished. 
---
or maybe you can git gud at killer and not rely on your little hex: no one escapes death tier 1 just like your mummy holding your hand while crossing the road in primary school awww so cute
---
He has a right to.We all do.You are everything that is wrong with the game.
---
Amazing that Racecar Johnny wasn't able to deliver on the horsepower there...

Wait, Johnny is OP, right?

Is this the end scene to  "2019: a DBDyssey" ? 
---
Legion, ebony... hmm. You looks fun to play agaisnt sir.
---
Dude I love Laser Tag
---
Doesn't keep me from being paranoid about it and just wanting them to rip the band-aid off.
---
Same tbh, I'm still learning that awkward mindgame, but I've still had some success with it.  If you're not sure what to run with Masterpiece, I can recommend Class Photo or, if you're not looking to burn Purple addons, the Green Dress (confusingly named because it's the Yellow Rarity addon.)  It reduces skillchecks further than the Blue Dress, at the cost of a negligible .5 seconds to the sleep timer.
---
"I do not care what the MEAT thinks"
---
PS4 player... Framrates.. Nonexistent.. Lobby ques... Nonexistent. Literally wait almost an hour to play 1 match in which someone either DC’s (usually unintentionally) or the killer DC’s. The game is unplayable to say the least. 
---
A Quentin tried doing this to a poor meg while the exit gates were open. Thankfully I had 8 stacks of SBFL and downed him in the exit gates, slapped a trap on his head, hooked him and left. 
---
Beyond the memes, it felt like a real SAW moment. The Meg could choose if he lived or died. Weirdly, the Meg decided to save him but he ran out of the exit gates with a trap on anyway. Classic red rank plays.
---
It's like someone breaking into my house and I kill them out of self defense and then you arguing "well you still killed them"
---
Short answer; you can’t
---
Long answer; survivor’s will always call everything the killer does BM. If they hook them, it’s BM, if they chase, it’s BM. What I’ve been doing is just playing killer how I want to play instead of how they want me to play, because if I play how they want me to I’m gonna stand in a corner the entire game. Just play how you wanna play. If you wanna camp, camp. If you wanna tunnel, tunnel. 
---
I sadly don't have Legion for Discordance yet, but I really want to put it on my Freddy so that I can have ez doublesleeps.
---
the killer can do anything they want, change my mind
---
YES. Agree 100%, hatch is an incentive to keep people invested in the game. That’s why it’s always going to be mechanic that favors the survivor.
---
It’s become one of my favorite tracking perks. I use it on pretty much everyone. It’s a fantastic perk imo and the only good Legion perk. Mad grit sucks, and Iron Maiden is situational. 
---
As a solo player, actually none of these would want to make me deal with the increased level of truly flat brain teammates and sweaty killers who only play Spirit/Legion with NOED/Ruin/Mori every game. Sorry but I feel as if the problem with high rank has little to do with no incentives and everything to do with a subsection of the playerbase being simply unfun to play with.
---
how is splitting up slowing down gens? splitting up gens is faster and more efficient.
---
For those who don’t play killer or meg-
---
Often survivors with sprint burst will wait till the killer is close to them, keep walking to bait a lunge, then sprint burst away so it’s basically a dead hard but for longer.
---
Someone had a P3 Legion mid Christmas double bloodpoint... 
---
Plus they were a survivor main before so may have started with a million bp 
---
More like guy who lays dead amongst the corpses then escapes on his own as a badass lone wolf surviving solo while the "team" gets picked off one by one.
---
Sole Survivor Lone Wolf Quentin FTW
---
I dont think noed is OP but god did this post make me laugh
---
Hah, I genuinely didn’t know dribbling was considered toxic.  That’s very silly.  It’s a completely reasonable counterplay to a strong perk.  Plus, as you say, it’s very situational and even when you do it you’re still wasting some time which is what DS was there to accomplish to begin with.
---
It’s the only way to counter DS, but people find it toxic anyways. Still works though. 
---
Or not.They can wait in the game forever.Its not their fault the killer wants to kill faster.Survivors just want to survive longer.They didnt use any cheats so they are right.He straight up cheated and has the audacity to post it on the internet expecting some sort of praise.
---
I never dc, I just want them to get out. Ill chase em out but it really shouldn't have to come to that
---
Are we supposed to get 4K or what?
---
Funny you mention NC since that Discordance, Whispers, and M&amp;A are apart of a Billy build I've been working with, alongside having the Begrimed Chains+CTG add-ons I found a pretty fun combo for myself.
---
It shouldnt.But it does.Cheating still isnt fair.
---
I just let them use it, almost all the times I'm able to down them again.
---
facecamping when the gates are open isnt a dumb thing to do, you are truly letting yourself lose if both gates are open and you walk away from that hook when all survivors are still alive
---
I swear everyone is running TOWARDS you and you STILL can hit them and the hit detection is rigged, making it worse.
---
It was them or me
---
It shouldnt but unfortunately it did
---
as a killer I will actually do a complete 180 if a survivor teabags me because I know they want me to chase them. can't think too emotionally when playing killer.
---
DC'ing isnt cheating, it makes the killer or survivor look like a sore losrr though,  which is why im not fond of OP's decision to strangle his connection but im fairly certain we've all been in the scenario where the survivors *just will not leave*, no matter what the killer does
---
How about we lag switch next huh?What is the difference?
---
Git gud
---
This adds to what I've been saying all along, it's a sport games with a horror skin slapped on. It's a professional game of tag. Friday feels more like a horror game. Dead by Daylight is its own thing as in terms of what it is.
---
but it isnt toxic, its just a poor strategy in the early/mid game. literally don't understand how its toxic. if someone camps you just do gens.
---
Spin to sometimes win, position myself so they fall off something and get stunned briefly, or dribble to a hook.
---
Lag switching would be cheating, this (if I'm honest) helped all of us get to the next game faster
---
No it wasnt.As long as they were in the game you could stilk win.But you cheated.
---
Yeah what's the point of surviving longer when you aren't getting any points and will most likely die anyways. That's just an excuse to screw with the killer. Everyone could have already been in another game after 15 minutes of hiding. Dont act like when people do that they aren't doing it to mess with the killer. 
---
"Cheated"
---
I feel like a decent compromise would be if auras were shown within a certain radius of the hooked person.  Like you're on a gen, wondering if you should go rescue, and then someone gets within X meters of the hook and now you know someone's on it already.  Then Kindred is still useful since it'll show everyones auras at any distance, and have that tier 3 killer reveal.
---
Can't argue with that
---
Its useful on trapper, lets you know if there's someone nearby before you put a trap down for them to just strut over and disarm it 
---
This is cheating.You used something from outside the game to get an advantage in-game.
---
More like “accidentally gets shot by another human who mistakes him for a zombie”
---
True
---
Advantage? I honestly helped everyone by saving all of our times
---
no because I love juking the shit out of him
---
bro, I MAIN PC!

I have a 4790k with a 1080ti. I have over 890 hours on pc.

Lol.

I didn't "buy" a zim for DBD, it's for FPS console titles to play with friends who ONLY own a ps4.

The majority of the fanbase actually likes Feng more than Claudette, Feng gets the most fan art and her fan art's cute and endearing. Meanwhile most of the memes here are anti-Claudette. Both Feng and Claudette are my favorites but I have to lick the ground like a thirsty dog for any Claudette meme that isn't shitty towards her.

I don't know where you're getting this.

Please don't free him.

Yeah.Thats what it was.
---
&gt;realizing you can shred through pallets with Spirit Fury and Enduring, eliminating is one major weakness
---
just throw the bottle then hit ez, smash and bash gamers.
---
I bought susie’s body but franks weapon 
---
No no no no.You gained bloodpoints.They did not.You cheated.
---
Well I mean if you believe it somehow didn't save time then that's a personal issue
---
This literally happened today (I was one of the Survivors).
---
Before the match began a Survivor screamed in the chat ''FLASHLIGHT'' a bunch of times so I decided to grab a flashlight as every other Survivor was using one so I thought ''eh, why not''.
---
We lost, everybody died. The Legion didn't even had Lightborn. I guess we all just were bad.
---
Honestly, that may work against bad killers, but why do so many survivors try that at rank 1? It's pretty much the equivalent of having flashing neon lights above your head that says "I have Sprint Burst". All it's doing is giving me a head start for the chase. On second thought survivors,  keep on doing what you're doing.
---
no one cares about the killer backstories as much as the actual gameplay
---
It is sexy and it'll be even better when they can't see your perks after they pass on. 
---
I love it but I'm sure the dress is gonna wig out as soon as she starts running.
---
Although this is true and Endfury is a very powerful combo on M1 killers, I actually use that combo on him very rarely.  I typically prefer perks that enhance his ability to sleep Survivors, or punish poor plays.
---
It saved your time therefore gaining an advantage in game.
---
I actually LOST bloodpoints because I didn't hook them, didn't even get my bbq stacks
---
Basic idea of this perk: Follow your teammates around to fill up tokens. Other survivors can see your aura so they can keep a track of where you are so it's harder to lose you.
---
Once you have tokens, survivors should run to you to get the debuff - Vigil prioritizes Status Effects in the following order: Exposed &gt; Exhausted &gt; Hindered &gt; Mangled &gt; Hemorrhage &gt; Blindness.  
---
If a survivor who got hit by Sloppy Butcher runs to you, first their Mangled would be removed for 30 seconds, then Hemorrhage.
---
If a survivor who is exposed by Rancor runs to you, for 30 seconds the killer would not be able to insta-down them.
---
My only issue with my Vigil rework is the exhaustion section: is it overpowered if someone who sprint bursts towards you can sprint burst away again? (Provided you spent at least 40 seconds collecting a token to debuff them). 
---
Well if saving time is an advantage then the survivors were at an advantage as well
---
"Why is this killer trying to kill me?"
---
I show no mercy. Unless I feel like it. I'll pick the last survivor up and drop them off by the hatch to let them escape. 
---
Instead lets add creeper from Minecraft &lt;3
---
Yeah but they got zero.Therefore you are at an advantage.
---
no its a friendly gesture
---
Then you don't really have a place to say anything, surely?
---
Time is more precious than bloodpoints
---
not exactly what this posts about, besides you can just face away from the window to pick them up if they're under one.
---
Delete both from the game.
---
new furry killer?
---
Honestly my memory is pretty shit so unless I see them that same night I'll forget.  If they are super toxic I block their username
---
No. It was the Auto Yard
---
That's so thashy
---
SO WHY AM I LAUGHING SO LOUD?!
---
If you want to, sure. Unwritten rules are not rules that you have to play by. I personally only let them escape if they were at a severe disadvantage like a disconnected teammate very early on in the match, but even that's your preference. You'll get called a tunneler or a crutch user no matter what you do, so might as well just have fun doing what you want to do.
---
As a killer main, they are both bad perks.
---
DS is worse in my opinion because EVERYONE can run it, and it isn't possible to counter it outside of a nearby hook, it WILL happen if that isn't the case.
---
NOED: Completely worthless if all totems are cleansed. Completely worthless in a SWF if all totems are cleansed except one which WILL be cleansed right before or as the last gen is done.
---
Even if it isn't cleansed, once someone is hit, NOED is displayed to every survivor.
---
NOED is basically just guaranteed to down 1 person, just like DS is guaranteed to wiggle off a killer as an obsession.
---
I'd rather NOED be that for 60 seconds the killer is granted increased movement speed by 10% and exit gates are not powered during the effect.
---
DS should just be "hit X button to stun the killer for 3 seconds and add X% to the wiggle bar"
---
Since it can be used by every survivor.
---
all you need to do is go to the menu and click match info or something then you can message them
---
Clearly not for them.You had no right to to do what you did.
---
This happened to me as Pig once. The survivor vaulted so I could grab him and get out, so we had a farm game instead of me having to dc. 
---
And far less situational.
---
There are no unwritten rules. 
---
Consensus is toxic behavior for killers includes hook camping, hook slapping (melee'ing people on the hook) and tunneling (to a lesser extent since you can't help which survivors you find most the time).
---
"nice" killers may allow the last survivor to escape, use the hatch, but most (including me) would only consider doing so if they played well, were obviously brand spanking new and had no idea what they were doing, if they got screwed by asshole teammates, and if there was no toxic survivor bullshit (teabagging, flashlight spam, etc.).
---
Actually a good joke. Oh, TTD made it. No wonder the meme is above the standard of putting a very basic bitch text in a white box next to an overused meme.
---
i love the new spirit cosmetics, they make her look like shes actually from an horror flim.
---
Can’t change it now. Tried to edit it earlier. Won’t let me take that tag off. 
---
Ye
---
Time is less valuable than bloodpoints to them, that's sad :(
---
Well if we got incentives it would hopefully increase the amount of players at high ranks,  decrease the games where you got DUMB teammates, and increase the variety in killers you face :) 
---
The lvl 1 Crook is just David's shirtless skin but with black jeans instead of Orange pants
---
I've encountered it when I was playing killer a meg was fast af the whole time
---
I believe this game is mostly about slasher killers anyways. 
---
No
---
Ascended Dwight skin soonTM
---
the only counter to DS is juggling near a hook, if it's a death hook.
---
So?What is your point?
---
We're probably gonna get something even worse than Legion in March. 
---
The amount of NOED I see Micheals running is utterly ridiculous.  I understand the logic of it.  “The survivors would never expect me to run NOED because Micheal already has built in NOED”... but... **Micheal already has built in NOED**.
---
My point? I saved both of us time
---
Wow! Our random was a Meg while we were playing.. interesting.
---
Very true, playing as survivor can feel very unrewarding 
---
Top right all day
---
Ikr, it’s stupid 
---
Can you explain what happened to you?
---
Its harder to depip on Legion than it is to pip on them. 
---
I misread, my apologies 
---
damn
---
wait were you talking about me or that guy who said that this post was pointless?
---
no, kill as many people as you can.
---
I'm pretty sure that's the default music. I prefer the legion theme personally. I'm sad to see it go. 
---
Bbq and chili+Survivor pudding makes it about 100,000. I just wish I could get bbq 3 because this game decides that I never get what I deserve. Level 50 hillbilly and still don't have ruin 1 or bbq 2.
---
there is no real consensus actually, everyone has different ideas on whats toxic, I personally believe the only truly toxic things are legitimate exploits of the game. like getting downed in a place the killer cant pick you up, body blocking a survivor into a place then just leaving your game running, etc.
---
Ya see I haven't insulted anyone throughout this whole thing but you guys all you do is throw insults because you're mad that I can manage my and others time
---
Thanks for this. I love playing Frederick and I wish more would give him an honest chance. He has so many built in advantages. One of which is he can’t be body blocked by awake survivors. I can’t tell you how many times I see an awake idiot crouched at the hook and then run away in terror as their neck snaps in half 2 seconds later lol. 
---
Speed hack... on console? Can that even be done?
---
Camped a guy with this perk since there were 5 gens left as well as only three survivors alive. Only one gen got done as well as the guy called me a noob camper.
---
Although incredibly difficult, it sure can be done.
---
I'm just sharing my opinion which should be alright considering it's a open forum.
---
I think my favorite of the menu themes I’ve been around for was the one that coincided with Hubtress’ release.
---
No. The opposite, actually. They've confirmed zero interest in Jeepers Creepers. Like, ever. There's too much associated baggage. No one wants to be company that gave the pedo money to use his character.
---
Before i could fully see the image, I thought it was Patrick Bateman...
---
Really hm for me it’s like rock music in the menu if that makes sense
---
Feel free to write ur opinion below , I hope for a clever discussion, cheers
---
You said everything 
---
up to you, really. if i like them, i usually let them get the hatch
---
Yea I loved that one how good would it be if you could pick from all of them 
---
I like the other rework idea, that's just me though.
---
The problem with this (imo) is that for DS you have to waste a perk slot because someone *might* have DS, and for NOED the survivors just have to cleanse the totems.
---
So the survivors have a built in counter but killers have to waste a slot for a *half*-counter
---
Damn it Legion!
---
I doubt it. Billy’s hit box and huntress’ hitbox is fucking awful. 
---
To be mad or even consider what I said as insulting, I'd actually have to take you seriously as a human being
---
I don't think Exhaustion is too much of a problem here. Your rework only allows them to see your aura in 8m, so they'd have to still find you, presumably while in or near to a chase. The other issue is that, hey--you're sort of taking your life into your own hands running this version of Vigil: yeah, you can suppress Exhaustion, which means everyone in the game is going to be trying to drag killers near to you. I can see a lot of Quentin's getting killers scraped off onto them.
---
huh...I was rooting for the guy from the Scream movies
---
But when they both work noed is easily superior
---
We had a hillbilly who would lag at tremendous speeds across the map 
---
you cant haha
---
exactly I run a perk like devour hope or huntress
---
Yeah, it used to work like Hope. Gens done, perk activates for 2 minutes. But you said nothing about making it not a Hex anymore, which was the nerf I mentioned, therefore for adding a timer to be a buff it'd have to work as I said. :)
---
What?I can 360 a killer too.Am I better than noob3 too?
---
Switch your target. Put more pressure on gens. If you choose to continuously tunnel your obsession that's your fault. If DS can reward a good player with another long chase then they probably deserve it for being skillful. NOED rewards bad players for not doing their objectives effectively. NOED shouldn't even be used at high ranks and yet you see it all the time. 
---
noed on myers?
---
Your "views" also include telling people they're inexperienced at a game for misspelling "Lauri" mate. 
---
Don't start a discussion without actually wanting your views to be critiqued because as everyone can see from your replies. 
---
It's no new information that DS and NOED suck to play against or a lot of people think they're "OP". So making a table that favors one over the other under the premise of "facts" then being a condescending guy to everyone that calls you out on it is just bullshit. 
---
I think he meant one survivor. 
---
holy fucking shit
---
It depends on which killers and teachables are you interested in buying
---
There is not an official DBD Podcast. OhTofu uploaded a podcast to Twitch the other day, debating whether or not it is 'okay' to de-rank. Some other points about the community's toxicity and expectations towards other players were also brought up.
---
A bad player using DS = immediately caught again afterwards. A bad player using NOED = a free kill because as you just said, the rest will leave ASAP and the survivor on the hook is unlikely to escape. 
---
Joke's on you, I don't use any hexes.
---
Like I said, get good at survivor and stop expecting to be able to genrush unimpeded. Cleanse all the totems or run the risk of NOED.
---
I like how they finally made an audio based perk based on DISTANCE, not "volume" its now like how sound actually fucking works.
---
I think you can understand what's wrong by yourself.
---
Sometimes, just to fuck with the last survivor,
---
I’ll slug them and then carry them to the hatch.
---
you know ruin exists? thats not a crutch
---
Running NOED with thrill is stupid because cleansing dull totems lowers the cleansing time of the hexes and you can cleanse without notifying the killer. 
---
You're much better off pairing NOED with ruin or something since survivors wont bother with dulls since they're get ruin and then go on gens after due to spending so much time dealing with ruin.
---
That's (not) how mafia works.
---
Derank from Rank 1
---
But if Ruin is the killer equivalent to DS and we're comparing the best survivor perk to the best killer perk, doesn't that mean that NOED is more powerful than DS since it isn't Ruin? 
---
devour hope because trappers an m1 killer and they wont know to be looking for a totem until its too late, its perfect for trapper
---
of course. Survivor mains hate legit reasons :P
---
You know I said I don't use hexes?
---
Again: cleanse the damn totems.
---
Michael and freddy are the only killers you can't buy with shards.
---
The steamer is spectating and not playing.
---
The killer have to use a perk slot the survivor only have to clean the totems not the same 
---
And pig
---
It’s the 13th....because the 13th is sCaRy
---
exactly
---
I do if I know the survivors and/or they've had disconnects and/or sandbags. Up to you though.
---
2500 extra bloodpoints for 4k
---
So one takes a perk to counter while the other just takes a few seconds cleansing totems
---
Rules for killers.
---
Don't let survivors repair gens
---
Kill survivors
---
Don't cheat
---
Do what you want.
---
Wow this post is shit in so many ways
---
I'll always advocate for Save the Best for Last on Freddy. It saves so much chase time (plus it gives Freddy fast fingerknife rubbing, a bonus). I use STBFL, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. Freddy has absolutely nothing to help him in chases, so an anti-loop build is nice to have. I use Nancy's Masterpiece (your new best friend as Freddy) and the Green Dress add-on (the yellow add-on). 
---
Guy got mad at me for downing people the camping the two right next to each other on the ground. Reported me for hacking as well.
---
DS is also more powerful than it should be, all you have to do is hit a skill check and it can mean the difference between escaping out of the gates and not, not to mention the only decent counter is Enduring which causes you to have to eat the DS first and even then, there is a possibility that the survivor could get to shack or a pallet to loop you for a little longer, wasting your precious time.
---
Also, have you seen how cocky DS survivors can be?  This is because they know how powerful the perk is and they know they can get a free escape out of it which is why they try and piss you off so much.
---
DS: Juggle, slug, enduring. 
---
NOED: Totems, or leave.
---
Generators are the survivors primary objective. If you have time to cleanse totems then that's great. If not then you have to do the gens before your team gets killed. It's as simple as that. Doing the totems means you aren't necessarily helping your teammates and because of you, the gates may never get powered. 
---
I think something worth mentioning about NOED is it's one of the few ways some killers can get access to Exposed (and movespeed, for that matter). Not counting Nurse and Huntress, other killers without instadowns can get bullied at a hook after gens are done.
---
I'm not saying they're not strong perks or that they shouldn't be changed at all, but "crutch perrrk" is just teary eyed blustering. All perks help bad players do a little better. Good perks help more than bad perks.
---
I mostly don't use NOED out of the kindness of my heart, but the handful of times I have used it I didn't get a kill with it because I won without it or the SWAT team cleansed it.
---
ikr, not to mention getting to 35% wiggle is guaranteed as long as no hooks are right next to you
---
do you honestly believe survivors are weaker than killers?
---
The killer's primary objective is to get kills. NOED helps with that. Genrush and risk NOED or cleanse totems and never face it at all. This entire game is built around decisions and risks like that and it's hilarious that people just don't want to face that reality.
---
That’s how mafia works 
---
Although you don't have to play him at all to get his perks. 
---
I mean you could not play him but level him up with bloodpoints earned. Although I did enjoy the times I played him and cut down multiple survivors during unhooks in the basement.
---
The PTB self-care isn't a punishment, it's actually a massive survivor buff.
---
A team with 4x self-care that never, ever heals altruistically makes games go an entire goddamn generator faster. 21s to heal yourself instead of 16s to get healed by another survivor (which is 32s total between the two of you). 11s of time saved for every health state the survivors heal. That'll add up to an entire generator worth before the killer triple hooks everyone.
---
It's just that it's new and only on the PTB (less players), so people haven't figured out how powerful it is yet.
---
Well u're right, but cleaning totems wastes time, which gaves the killer a little advantage  for a moment. We also need to notice the maps, like the game or the swamp, on them noeds goes on everytime
---
Fail meme
---
that name haha
---
Im on PS4. Only lets me buy clown with shards
---
I'm not here to agree or disagree with either side, but if you want to critique OP it would be better to tell them what they've missed (unless you've already done this further down the thread somewhere) or some counterpoints.
---
Killers cost 9000 shards, Movie Killers are $/€ only.
---
Get Perks from Killers you dont want to play as ex. The Hag ( Hex:Ruin ), Leatherface (BBQ&amp;Chili).
---
Only buy Killers for their Playstyle you like their Teachables are just an added bonus.
---
But ingame it says 35%?
---
I've gotta remember this line for when SWF survivors get salty in the post-game chat
---
Wow as if people say this stuff over a game. Props for those who keep calm and don't give in.
---
I’m more of a Nurse main who occasionally plays Freddy, but the two things that I enjoyed about him was the fact that you can use the dream transition, the blinking in and out of reality, to mind game survivors, and how easy it was to disengage from chases since you had infinite aura reading. I’m excited to see what BHVR has for our dream demon, but I’ll definitely miss the hidden fun aspects of his power. 
---
dribbling requires a hook to be within about 12m of you, slugging requires you to defend the guy and doesn't always work as people will just do gens.  Also, DS is used almost all of the time, the only time it's never been used when i play is if they miss or if there is a hook right next to them
---
Trapper angrily smacking the ground with his weapon when the Survivor got out carries the same energy as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIUCzIH9Bp4)
---
Dribbling doesn't negate the perk, you just trade the risk that they'll DS and loop you again for like 10 seconds of fucking around at a hook - giving them a chance to bodyblock, flashlight, or sabotage. Twice.
---
In most cases slugging is a disadvantage for the killer because it lets the survivor get saved faster in a place and manner of their choosing. 
---
the guy is very gifted, there's no denying that
---
Because we're all entitled.
---
There's actually very few multiplayer games that are original and don't get boring after 500+ hours and with this one no two games are ever the same. There's also very few Asymmetrical games that are enjoyable (RIP Evolve) and thus we linger and though the complaints grow so does the game and its community.
---
literally 99% of my games the killer has not got NOED, it isn't a common perk to deal with unlike DS
---
I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying you're not healed one health state. That's all. That's like saying a flashlight save heals a survivor for 1 health state or the killer dropping you 4 times heals you. It's not a heal. Healing ome health state wpuld make it so the killer has to hit the survivor twice again. 
---
I'm sorry what? If you get hit by a survivor perk you facecamp them? 
---
&gt;Getting hit with a non-obsession DS when I'm not Freddy typically results in a *very* long face to face chat.
---
And yet I would bet anything you find survivors that teabag you in the gates when you use NOED the most toxic thing in the world don't you?
---
I don't think I have the mental capacity to properly respond to your ascended comment. If that's how you treat people using Decisive then you're no better than a toxic survivor. If you can't catch a survivor a second time after eating the DS then you need to get better as a killer. NOED is a problem because you have to rely on your teammates that may leave you for dead. DS is only a problem for unexperienced killers that can't catch a survivor more than once. 
---
The real OGs be people who can still say “GG WP” after blatant toxicity and the such. 
---
True enough. 
---
you realize attacking the people you are supposed to be working with is not the same as attacking the people working against you?  
---
neither is correct, but when you get to the point where you sabotage your own team you are being worse than a salty killer
---
This isn't an argument for NOED being op, it's an argument for Decisive being badly designed.
---
I don't think you play killer much if you think "but if you just eat it and move on its not that hard".  That is really not what it's like
---
She's foul. Don't understand why everyone is so obsessed with her.
---
The only problem here would be that if your Adrenaline procs and then you immediately get downed by NOED it seems a little unfair since its less tit-for-tat. 
---
woH?
---
Not DC, DbDC. 
---
Maybe, but I think this would go a little over the top. Speaking of hex perks needing a buff, why do survivors know the killer has huntresses lullaby before the killer has hooked anyone? Doesn't seem fair to me.
---
1/10 meme
---
Not a single photo of SuperFreddy anywhere, smh :(
---
Nice, I've been considering picking up Nurse myself actually.  I definitely agree that his disengage and re-engage game is actually very fun, and his Dream Transition Mindgame is a surprisingly satisfying maneuver.
---
Maybe op had a bad monitor before and thought that since his pc could run on it he switched? Maybe he never used to play on 1080p+ and had to lower res on his new monitor to hit 144fps
---
*Discussion*
---
I play usually Huntress, Doctor, or Bing Bong.
---
This is true for all DBD players. Even pc. Trust me.
---
It depends. If you dont want to spend money save for killers. I would recommend getting all the DLCS on a sale and using shards for shrine.
---
If it makes you feel any better, in the most recent dev stream they said they were aware of the infinite loading issue that was causing 3 man games to happen a lot. And they're planning to fix it of course
---
No. This is my only account.
---
Because BHVR is bad at consoles.
---
You use R1 for healing and dropping pallets.
---
The Touch Pad which I touch during games by accident can make me miss a hit.
---
And the Analog stick may be because you move the killer left and right a bit.
---
Rotating the stick works rather well, it doesn't even need to be fast and can easily be done with your thumb.  If the bar is progressing, then it is going as fast as it can go and the speed in which you move the joystick has no impact on the speed in which you wiggle free.  Just rotate the stick in a circle at a comfortable speed and it works perfectly and isn't a hassle.
---
Also I don't see why we shouldn't be allowed custom bindings for literally everything, and BHVR should also allow for sensitivities higher than the current maximum as an option.  More options is never a bad thing, and since they already allow adjustments of some of the controls I don't imagine it would be very difficult to open it up a bit more.
---
I feel slightly better :|
---
Waiting for news regarding re-implementing the flick, as they promised in one form or another. :)
---
I agree, but then again, I feel like NOED needs a rework itself. I'd like it if the movement speed got increased to 7%, no longer gives the exposed effect and no longer is a hex perk.
---
If that doesn't go trough, at least let everyone know that they have the exposed effect, don't make it hidden for the survivors
---
SuperFreddy would require an ascension beyond the limits of mortal man, to the point where one might even say that Freddy's top 6 killers in the game.  
---
I've never cared if people use either, they're just perks in a game I like and they make for more interesting game play. But with the facts shown so clearly like this, it's very clear that NOED is much more of a crutch perk that most people shouldn't need and is way stronger than it should be for the people who do need it. All DS does is extend the chase like 90% of the time and only very seldom does it lead to an escape because it's not hard to counter at all.
---
Know that feeling.
---
I didnt even lvl for Franklin  because I want to keep my Perk Pool somewhat clean. 
---
Its sad - the game is really fun and original but the player base are mostly whiny babies. This sub in particular is a total echo chamber of people rehashing the same posts and arguments over and over.
---
Everyone thinks they know best, not much to do besides try to ignore it and stick around for the sprinkle of good posts and memes lmao
---
These high rank killers shouldn't *need* NOED. Yet nearly 1/4 of them do.
---
That's only 1/5 of survivors using DS and the only reason it becomes a 'problem' is because there are 4 survivors. You also have to take into account that high ranks are full of P3 Nurses where survivors never even get to the endgame. 
---
I just had a 3 v 1, i let the last survivor live like real gentleman
---
So basically, they didn't buff prove thyself, they nerfed repair speeds. GREAT. 
---
I think the worst is a key, a map, and 2 toolboxes
---
Mission passed; +5 respect.
---
Billy is the best killer next to nurse. Change my mind.
---
Don't put him on Night Watch 
---
You mean so hot am I right 
---
I agree that both perks are a hassle to deal with. However as a survivor main I feel that the game is allready favoured for survivors. A ds is a huge tempo swing. As a killer you need your time so badly. If the obsession is the first one you find and you chase them (ds users are often skilled players) you already lose so much time. By the time you down them again, two gens have popped. Then the game is basically lost because there is no pressure.
---
NOED gives a bit of tempo back, but only once it is too late. It usually gets you one more kill if you're lucky. To say that it rewards a bad player is incorrect I think. Yes less skilled players can get an additional kill maybe, but that is just it. Why should you not have perk that helps out a little bit should you have less skills then others. You could easily just be not very good at the game, but still enjoy it. No need to be harsh about just needing a little bit of help.
---
I feel both perks are unfun and therefor decide just not to run either. Sometimes it costs me a game when I come across more skilled players, but i'm fine losing badly every once in a while :p
---
I got this.
---
truthfully if this is how i inevitably go out, i wouldnt regret it at all. 🤷
---
The only issue I have with him is when there's 4 survivors on the one gen and if you put them all to sleep, they just sort of take turns waking each other up and putting you back 7 seconds (on average). You hit one and chase them and the others wake each other and go back to the gen and then you have to choose between losing your hook or going back to try and scare them off the gen.
---
With other killers it can still be a pain in those situations, especially in SWF, but I always feel like I at least can slow them down a significant amount and that they have to go find another gen to work on or try and lead me away significantly.
---
I dunno, that's just how I feel. The rest of his gameplay feels pretty fine though so I'm not sure how it could be balanced in a way that doesn't make the rest of it too easy without drastically changing his power.
---
Old DBD legend.
---
its an economy but with actions
---
She’s a lot of fun once you get her blinks down. Give her a shot! 
---
Doubtful, if this legion truly didn’t even get a single hit they were either farming or very very bad
---
Both need changes imo but no matter what I say people think I'm just shitting all over NOED and saying DS is perfectly okay. Admittedly, DS doesn't cause as much of an issue to me as NOED does, simply because NOED causes you to rely on your teammates who are probably going to leave you or get themselves killed while DS is just down to you choosing to tunnel a good survivor instead of putting pressure on gens and finding someone who isn't your obsession. 
---
except NOED is a crutch and unbalanced as fuck while ruin isnt LMFAODOSFOSDFKOPDSKFPAGIDFHOIOGUH
---
This is me when I’m killer,
---
If it’s 2/1 man either from loading issues or d/c I’ll let you guys farm. Shouldn’t be punished for other people leaving.
---
Same here. I bought it on pc just before clown was released so I could play ptb and stuff. Realised how much smoother and overall better the game ran on pc. Been on there ever since. Still dabble on ps account if it's switched on and I wanna quick match but pc is much better. Worth the regrind IMHO. Plus ptb. 
---
I also took my knowledge from hundreds of hours of playing and applied it to who to level first and the best way to maximize BP etc. Whereas ps4 I was freshly noob so made some horrific choices which set the grind back a bit. Think I've put in about 260 hours on pc now and have pretty much all teachables across survivor and killer. Bar a handful. But I left them on purpose to reduce the crap perks showing in webs etc.
---
You don't need to let anyone go.
---
Never heard of him. Also fortnite is making more money.
---
Agreed :(
---
