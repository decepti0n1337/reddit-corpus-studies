Yup and if you look below this there is human trash defending human trash.
---
---
---
Sounds like the average Ochido fan, too similar for parody
---
He's a fucking pedophile why defend him, also he ban evaded when he went to PS4 which is literally against the terms of the game and will get him banned. No amount of outrage from his fans will change a thing
---
Yeah, he's one of those twelve-year-old followers that will believe everything he says. His arguments are basically nothing.
---
This is what I use Empathy for. Unlimited range on injured survivors. Let‚Äôs you know where the chase is, and you can also run to them to heal or be healed 
---
that glich isn't even that uncommon
---
Quick question, do you have proof he‚Äôs a pedophile? 
---
Oh dear, I hadn't seen this video - thanks for providing the source. It doesn't help that he doesn't seem to have any allies amongst fellow content creators. 
---

---
You're right about the vocabulary, after all each word exists with its own nuance. I was just worried that this was blind hate is all. Appreciate the info. 
---
Personally I don't understand why people go after No0b3 just as hard. Is there anything I should know there?
---
ikr, if this ain't hell, idk what is
---
ü¶Ä OCHIDO IS GONE ü¶Ä
---
No i mean in game. I haven't used her default outfit in ages lol
---
I can imagine him just walking up to The Legion and saying that and letting out a godly laugh
---
With Surveillance you can track multiple generators in different states without survivor requirements. Discordance needs two survivors working on the same gen and can just track two gens at the same time, which is very situational. It depends on whats your priority.
---
hmm let me make a post instead of looking st the top post on hot. 
---
If he gets a new account they can just ban him again
---
Yeah.
---
If he can't make money off of DBD anymore, he won't play it.
---
i think the only offense i find stupid that you can be banned for is ban evasion. imo if you are gonna play on another account and not cheat you should be allowed to play since you put more money into the game. but maybe that's just because i evaded a ban on counter-strike years back and now play it more than anything else without cheating ever since. (i was in 8th grade when i was banned). other than that he has done some shitty stuff, but idk if he exploited on ps4.
---
 I don't need you to respect me, I respect me
---
I don't need you to love me, I love me
---
But I want you to know you could know me
---
If you change your mind
---
Y tho
---
Its bullshit, but killers also suffer from it when they land a hit and the game doesn't register the hit.
---
Ahhhahahaaaaa dick head so happy he‚Äôs gone, switching to console doesn‚Äôt mean your are now unbanned and aloud to play. 
---
*fortnite dancing intensifies*
---
Harassed people

\*Starts to dust away\*

‚ÄúHOOOOONK‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
---
also getting to rank 1 isnt a good thing. Its just nurse/billy/spirit up there, and they all will 4k you if you arent good enough :)
---
Yes please! It‚Äôs a QoL change, but I want it nonetheless. I like running Meg‚Äôs Envy hoodie, green and yellow hat with Black pants and I want to save it as an outfit. 
---
Thank fucc for that, as a ps4 player i was scared to run into him online
---
So you mean you made the correct play and they were upset
---
I went back in his stream and saw his reaction fucking priceless
---
But its shitty and noone uses it for that exact purpose
---
Doctor flair checks out
---
I‚Äôm so confused like how does the killer know they have BPS
---
PS4 is clean now GG Devs 
---
Good riddance.
---
Standing up for someone like that only puts them in the same boat. Disgusting, hopefully twitch follows BHVR and bans him too.
---
Oh yeah that would be smart 
---
No one cares aboit his money, we just finally removed a cancer tumor
---
Unfortunately, all his fuckin' 12-year-olds are still gonna watch his YouTube videos, I guess. For some reason he still is so fucking popular...
---
Gates dont get powered because too many survivors waste time self caring instead of doing objectives. 
---
Yeah, I used to use it back when Legion was deemed the worst killer in the game. Now I refuse to. I prefer the knife ones anyway. The Ultra Rares are pretty meh
---
Nice job then, haha.
---
Ochido had good things going for him when he started the funny moments, wish he didn‚Äôt go down such a toxic path :(
---
Unfortunately, they can't unless he follows his god and uses some exploits. Don't understand how anyone with common sense will defend human trash.
---
no but they love a bit of ochido
---
You're welcome my guy.
---
Most he'd likely get is a refund for any money he has spent on the game.
---
Can't sue for lost potential revenue because then your getting into the legal fuck-zone of copyright law and fair use. Ain't now small time lawyer going to mess with that.
---
I assume No0b3 is getting lots of hate because he plays pretty toxic occasionally and is a troll every once in a while. But he isn't doing it mean-spirited like ochido does it and he isn't doing it all the time. 
---
I assume that another factor is that he, too has been banned twice as of now. Once for hacking legacy and other exclusive items he presumably lost during one of BHVR's mess-upsband once for reasons that I personally don't know
---
If you broke the rules and cheated then you hurt the playerbase and you deserve the punishment. Ban evasion avoids the punishment, which should be a bannable offense.
---
Not my video, but is anybody else experiencing this?
---
I hope your not serious, the man is literal cancer
---
That sucks
---
Fair enough, I didn't know about a lot of these transgressions. The video was pretty interesting too
---
Why did he get banned
---
I don't know much about his bans. Were the previous ones temporary or permanent? And is this one meant to be temporary or permanent?
---
Oink!!
---
Thats a basic perk loadout, i mean its nothing special
---
They are missing adrenaline haha 
---
I love seeing this awesome artwork you've been posting, please do more o.o
---
Thx
---
It literally lists rage quitting as a reason to report someone for being unsportsmanlike.  Why the fuck is it an example they spell out themselves then?
---
On "The Game" map in the bathroom you can stand in a way that the killer lands on your head and if you dont move they cant get out of it. (Since patched.)
---
Who's Ochido?
---
I agree that noed can be used in certain build like and end game. I only use it for what i just said. But if i just prestiged my killer i use it just for the extra security
---
I'm glad you like it thanks , means a lot .
---
And yeah , I will make more dw 
---
No I mean preventing the last survivor from escaping the match by letting him wriggle free in a corner of a map then instantly downing them, and not  ending the game by using that hook five feet away. 
---
Oh wow, this is incredible. Great job! &lt;3 
---
A good survivor will dodge mindgames of that caliber though 
---
Maybe he is just creating alts to defend himself? I don't know why anyone would want to legitimately defend this person
---
Only problem I can see is the mask is too wide; Huntress' fits on her face perfectly. Other then that, awesome cosplay.
---
Not sure if it's the case on console, but if you get banned on PC it's a Hardware ID ban, meaning you have to get a new computer before you can play again, not just a new account, so unless he goes to xbox or a new ps4 AND account then he shouldn't be able to play again
---
If anything i said isn't correct feel free to correct me, this is just what I've heard about their system
---
Survivor perks make it harder for the killer to do their objective (killing) and perks like ruin make it harder for survivors to do their objective (gens). Pretty much every survivor build has to include and exhaustion perk, and on most maps that means dead hard or sprint burst. 
---
Well I mean if you have bad internet and you know you have bad internet you should really put the controller down and find something else to do until the latency is resolved....it‚Äôs not rocket science. The very least go play a single player for a bit.
---
But I assume like most ban systems you won‚Äôt get banned over just one match, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôll be a good amount so that way their CS team can be more adamant about some of the ban appeals that I definitely think people like ochido tried to do to get the account restored.
---
The system is new, give it some time so we can see the actual results/data before we go criticizing a new system that is honestly better then none because anyone who plays console religiously knows PS4 DC‚Äôs have been a cancer on the PS community 
---
OR they make the next killer so unbelievably messy that we forget that Legion is a mess
---
They can have a sign up sheet. People who sign will get banned when they dc.
---
When was ochido unfairly banned?
---
This actually reminds me of the time where I met a streamer
---
 I was new to the game (important for later) and just said good luck to the team of four, Nothing too special simply gl hf for the sake of kindness and this match I was playing The Pig. The streamer was a m u c h higher level than I was and was in a SWF group with two others (one being the mans wife) so the match began and they were playing like a SWF group with good cooperation and that jazz. I had killed the wife of the streamer with a bear trap. The match ended and he and his second SWF had gotten out because of the cooperation they were able to have, a nice move to be frank I‚Äôm not mad it was a good move. So I was giving out the post GG‚Äôs (like a good little boy) and the dude starts being toxic to me in the dm‚Äôs of xbox and I, being the good boy I was, replied back with nothing but kindness. He then says ‚Äúsee you on YouTube‚Äù as if to say I‚Äôd be exposed. Sound there mate I‚Äôm not being toxic you‚Äôre just looking like an ass. So I message back Hi YouTube and other positive things to the chat and at the end of it all I ask for his channel
---
*this is where stuff gets juicy for me*
---
The guy gives me his channel name and I go looking through his videos, nothing there but that‚Äôs when I realised and I saw. He was streaming so _everything_ that went down was on recording and now it was just time to find my match and watch it. 
---
How are you gonna find it you may be asking me however I had one easy way of locating the exact time stamp I was *remember when I said I gave out gl and hf? Well that‚Äôs not really common* so I just hear the wife say ‚Äúsomebody just messaged me good luck‚Äù and well there‚Äôs my match. zSwiiftyyx as Pig. The match itself wasn‚Äôt all that much however I realised right at the end he was insulting me (or at least trying to) for my low rank by referring to me as ‚Äúbaby ribs‚Äù or something along those lines. Now that wouldn‚Äôt be an issue except the dude is a *full grown man and I was a 14 year old teenager* 
---
So yeah, that‚Äôs my time with a toxic streamer! Sorry if the story wasn‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm not used to these long winded posts but this is my favourite story to tell in the whole word 
---
If you‚Äôd like proof that I‚Äôve actually been through this I‚Äôve got the dms from the guy on xbox so I can show them if need be
---
I bet that is photoshop 
---
Lazy 17 year old :I
---
Pathetic
---
Because he evaded he ban even after getting perma banned on pc
---
So, don't get me wrong here, ban evasion is wrong and I agree with it. But I kinda wish there was a way to kinds circumvent that. Say you get banned, but enjoy whatever you were banmed from dearly and want to redeem yourself. So you make a new account or whatever and do abide by the rules and whatnot. I wish there was some kind of redeeming thing I guess. 
---
But this isn't defending ocunto over here, he's just a dink.
---
This. I sometimes wish I could just post a dancing emoji in text messages.
---
Well unfortunately for ochido moral rights mean jack shit outside of feel good land 
---
His videos are worse, unless you like identical videos where the same overplayed ear rape memes are played back to back to back because humour
---
If i was actually the huntress‚Äô size then this mask would maybe fit, but i am a lot smaller üòÇ thanks! 
---
Thanks for this info.
---
I had this bug in one match about a month ago. It wasn‚Äôt one survivor, it was one particular hook in the basement - I could hook people on all three others but not that one. 
---
Probably it‚Äôs technically against tos
---
I'm pretty sure if an entire community celebrates the removal of you from a game, you have more then enough moral right to do it.
---
follow ur dreams 
---
I‚Äôve been getting hit after a fast vault. Literally after the animation ends. Before the patch hits like those would never go through in a million years, but now it feels like window loops are not safe at all.
---
I know I‚Äôm on reddit but how can you possibly think that Spirit Fury is useless? It lets you disrespect pallets when its active and is a huge help for killers like Wraith and Leatherface.
---
Deliverance sucks. You need a safe unhook for it to proc, so you need to not get downed and hooked first and you need to go for the hook rescue and make sure its a safe one. Theres no situation where it is worth to run deliverance over a perk that will actually help you. Not to mention the negative synergy with adrenaline, one of the best perks in the game
---
These are allegations, and serious ones at that, so until I see some solid proof, take this video with a grain of salt. Regardless of how much a toxic asshole he is, we can‚Äôt just go around accusing people of shit. You can never 100% trust things online. Now don‚Äôt confuse this with me defending OchiDO, because he‚Äôs a fucking asshole and I hope I never see him play this game again, but accusing him of being a pedophile is serious and is to be treated as such. 
---
Fucking beautiful
---
I can imagine a Twelve-Year-Old defending him. In this day and age parents don't teach their kids that certain actions have repercussions. Anyone over the age of 16 should begin to realize that people like Ochido don't deserve remorse.
---
Yeah it was a flag of sorts but I can't remember what flag it is, I think it's Africa related that's all I remember djdhjd go to Paulie Esther's twitter
---
I‚Äôm so damn happy rn
---
You are just rank 15,it's so obvious to see, it's a Photoshop... 
---
Just look at the rank closer... 
---
The Devs being super slow is a common thing.
---
I sense a trend here
---
I think it's because he looks like an autistic 12yo, which is godly compared to his troglodyte fans.
---
He wouldn't even get that
---
spirit fury enduring combo and meme in the same sentence. man reddit never ceases to amaze me with the stupidity.
---
So you fuck over the other three survivor players because you're too trash to learn how to play a killer you don't like? Got it.
---
Hopefully you'll get a run of Legion players and DC from enough games that you'll get banned.
---
Just make sure you don't show this particular mixtape to your parents, could make for an awkward family dinner... 
---
Probably. Bans just went live and we already have an example of someone getting banned (Ochido). Devs ban for achievement hacking and modifying the game data so they'll know if people used the exploit.
---
Plus on stream they said they're gonna ban for it. 
---
Spirit fury
---
I made this for the discussion going on between people in the community.
---
I'm not a woman, so probably not.
---
If Daddy Myers isn't your top I don't even know what to say to you.
---
I‚Äôm not on ochido‚Äôs side, but you can get banned for purchasing a new account? That seems odd. Hasn‚Äôt noob3 done that like twice?
---
That limits the effectiveness of both though, you might as well run any other perk in that slot.
---
So who is Ochido and why is everyone so happy he‚Äôs been banned?
---
Would be great but first I want the ability to preview multiple things at once in the store (outside of preset outfits)
---
What about report for stream sniper
---
How do people look at this and not realize it‚Äôs satire lmao
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law
---
(this list assumes that each killer is willing to shower beforehand. without this assumption most would be F tier due to lack of sanitation)
---
Yea. BHVR fucked up and made a bunch of people lose their legacy so noob hacked it back. Pretty dumb ban since all he did was hack to get something he lost because of a dev fuckup
---
Oh lol. Personally I got 20 purple flashlights all from plunderers + luck/chest offerings.
---
Trapper outswoles him and the Doctor has the unique ability of using his thingy as a vibrator
---
I mean, if he keeps making accounts they keep getting free money so him trying to come back just benefits the community 
---
why are all teenagers on reddit so fucking annoying lmao
---
Not even 4 stacks of thano do anything. They add around 5 seconds to a gen. It's such a waste of a perk slot that complaining about it shows how much he knows about the game
---
For one, not everyone knows how to navigate Reddit
---
Two, not everybody looks in hot because it's normally just reposted memes anyway
---
People on Reddit don't seem to know how to answer questions without being cocky, sarcastic douches
---
Wrong. He was banned for griefing.
---
It's amazing how false info just spreads because nobody does research
---
It's just these people's delusional attitudes. They make up shit just to say that their favorite streamer is superior. Tru actually compliments everyone every time he gets outplayed. A big majority of this sub are survivor mains so I guess it makes sense that they'd be triggered at the facts Tru is complaining about at rank 1 lmao. 
---
I piped too much and now i am rank 2 as survivor and i find it boring...
---
Leatherface before Myers ? You drunk dude
---
Aaaaa... Haha
---
I also wanna add in that the doctor also laughs if he hits you. Both the survivor and doctor can hear this.
---
I think the progress is a bug - unless I read the patch notes wrong.
---
The person was a Claudette who was pretty good at looping based on running into her earlier in the game. She got into that spot when there were two people (including herself) left. It just took me a little bit of time (way too much lol). There's not a whole lot of room to move around on that rock and yes you can dodge attacks but like I said, the mindgames work. At least they did for me. I was also playing the Spirit so maybe that's why it was more effective for me.
---
Let's be honest no one would get that gift card because it's probably fake.
---
The order the killers appear in their respective tier doesn't mean I favor them any greater or less. It's in no particular order.
---
We got raided by 9 year old pedochido fans that are also planning to spam on twitter
---
It's optional, the game tells you you can 
---
Yeh, because those two things are totally handled by the same staff/teams... /logic.

Yeah, they're too busy saying "hE's gOt aN eGo" instead of celebrating his achievement, it's actually so fucked up. Like, who cares? 
---
True, I've gotten almost all achievements, just missing Taking One for the Team. Which is a bitch to do because most killers in red ranks aren't going to go hit me unless they have MYC.
---
The only other challenging ones were Evil Incarnate and Where Did they Go. WDtG isn't even that challenging when u have a SWF who knows what they're doing, I did it out of pure luck with pug matches
---
noob3 also changed his behavior to an extent ochidio hasn‚Äôt 
---
Welcome to the real world, buddy
---
ratboygenius as killer. trust me
---
He doesn‚Äôt have to say it... if the victims all spoke against him. There‚Äôs not much that he can do. Open your eyes
---
Dwight pig.
---
In America, most places are "If you're under 18 you are considered a minor" Doesn't matter if hes 19, if that girl took him to court he would be considered a pedophile and be put on the list as a sex offender. Just don't ask underage girls for nudes. Ask people your own age or higher. 
---
This will sound crazy but, what if they buffed other killers? 
---
Spirit, Hag and even Trapper are very competitive nowadays but they are add-on reliant. 
---
Long Gone
---
UNLIMITED POWAAAAAAAAA
---
They lost their charm for me after I lost 30% of my hearing in a day.
---
have one of his perks to be "your having a nightmare"
---
I watched that video just now, wouldn't say that's much proof TBH. I mean the behavior repulsive, obviously. But I didn't hear a mention of anyone being underage, unless that was just implied or something?
---
2 days isn't that bad. I'm curious to see if you lose any of your items. 
---
Wym?
---
It's a combination of Feral Frenzy and Carter's Spark. The Deep Wound timer apparently doesn't deplete during a chase, so if you come across David and Feng, and hit David, you'd be better off going after Feng instead of focusing David, while eventually wrapping back around to David to make sure he doesn't heal himself of the Deep Wound.
---
It's only a guaranteed down with the Memory Of A Goddess Add-on. And now that I think about it, that seems broken, so maybe that should be limited to only working once or twice.
---
So basically all of his past streams?
---
Makes sense too 
---
With a high map presure killer like billy its really good, you can just patrol the gens and wait for them to touch one. Then you know where to run. Same for spirit and nurse (I dont play nurse but I supouse it would work fine).
---
Just wait until he sees this 
---
Guys wanting to be completely wrecked by other guys exist
---
Spirit does make it a lot easier but I did it at rank 1 once just to try it myself and managed to avoid hits for a few minutes before they just gave up. I got down after this btw but I needed to experience it lmao
---
A few reasons but the bulk of it is that he's just super toxic.
---
I imagine they would need to ban a lot of people many people have seen that video, friends have explained how to do it ext. 
---
Yea but how much close can I get with the power before they hear the sound??
---
Ruin noed and ebony Mori . Yup that's red ranks 
---
Look on the website, it states temporary. 
---
‚ÄúThis is illegal. They're banning me without a reason.‚Äù
---
Lol I don't like Trump but he's no pedo (at least from what I know, not American so I don't keep up with this shit), and it's plenty relevant at least to what kind of person he is, I mean if you want to support a child predator go ham I guess but I'd question your morals if you'd continue to support a piece of shit just because you find them funny.
---
Doves are a universal sign of hope.
---
You hardly see the same killers on console. 
---
As a killer you fly through ranks, as a survivor once you hit rank 10 you also fly to rank 1. But oh god do I get stuck in rank 13-15. It takes me my life and a half to get out of there.
---
This is tragic on so many different levels. 
---
Rage quit
---
While I agree with ‚Äòthey all should be locked up‚Äô I don‚Äôt agree with ‚Äòeven with a lack of evidence‚Äô. By that standard I could accuse you and you would be locked up right away. There‚Äôs a reason innocent until proven guilty is a thing. 
---
Makes sense because according to the story, Julie pretty much forced susie to take part in murdering the janitor even though she didn't want to. 
---
Susie has never done anything wrong in her entire life. Change my mind. 
---
Oh that. There‚Äôs a lot I could say on that topic but as long as they aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúwreck,‚Äù me, I don‚Äôt care lol
---
Now that they can ban him on console no end of his accounts are gonna last very long. Plus he‚Äôs already spent at a minimum of 80 bucks on it, 100
---
If he comes back 
---
Curious if you will keep all those prestiged killers. 
---
Late Response but he's less of a Pedophile and more of a closeted-but-obvious Hebiphile, there's been proof that he has asked underage Girls around 13 - 16 for Nudes I believe and he apparently finds Rape to be funny or "cute" (?) as he has said it once in a Discord Voice Chat in Spanish, I believe.
---
I'd take all of that with a grain of Salt because I'm not sure if it is actually his voice (it does sound like him, though) and this is the Internet where we cry wolf at a street dog; HOWEVER it should be noted that even his videos have a clearly ... weird kind of sexual humor, so for him to be a sexual deviant wouldn't be that much of a shock, IMO.
---
Note: This is just what I gathered and it's only my Opinion, I know how reddit works so I'll just say ahead that I don't want to start an argument, have a nice day!
---
I would definitely support this over throwing your controller and breaking something.
---
Spirit and hag do fine without addons. 
---
Well that‚Äôs the reason he was banned, but he did do all that stuff
---
&gt;Lol. Trapper. Competitive
---
Iridescent Stone + Stitched Bag + Knowing where to set up traps makes him quite strong.
---
Whenever I see Trappers failing with these add-ons is because they didn't take time to prep the map and just play as a Wraith. 
---
*we're gonna doot forever*
---
If you accused me it's most likely true so I need to be locked up forever regardless.
---
I think some people just got whooshed.
---
I always report rage quitters, as a killer or survivor.  Bare minimum should be item loss but I'd support a day ban as well for every occurrence.
---
You don‚Äôt have to like the guy, but don‚Äôt spread misinformation and lies about him, ya know? These things are what ruin this community for me, and is by far the most toxic one I‚Äôve been a part of. 
---
Is that an actual song or just one made for this clip? 
---
It's not only the grind system, but the progression certainly helps a lot, Do you honestly think people would get to like 7k hours on DbD if there was no grind? And is DbD core gameplay not fun because of that? 
---
You're joking right? Pedo allegations are thrown around all the time you edgy cunt
---
Ah, ok, got it! That seals the deal that this is a great idea.
---
Be a lot more substantial if they hadn't done at least 5 DC's as well
---
Yes. Apparently they announced that yesterday and everybody thought they were just tryna scare people into following the rules, then Ochido got banned and everyone realized they weren't fucking around
---
Well some of us don‚Äôt believe everything we see on the internet but like I said, I put my two cents in and I‚Äôm finished. So if you‚Äôre wanting to argue comment on someone else‚Äôs sheet and have funüòä‚úåüèΩ
---
Man people really like hating on this dude 
---
It‚Äôs amazing how you haven‚Äôt learned how to read the rules BHVR laid out so clearly 
---
I mean Id love to hear your argument because I wasn't playing when freddy launched and as I said I'm not a seasoned player. However I can already sense the condescension in your tone, like you skipped that whole section in my post. Maybe try coming down from that high hook and Id love to have a discussion about it, not a session where you smugly ridicule me simply for being inexperienced.
---
I'm stuck between 13-12, but it's because I suck or sometimes tunneled to shit.
---
Might I suggest throwing in some totem cleansing? 600 BP per one is quite good and it's a good way to get possible NOED out of the game. 
---
Same thing happens to me over and over on xbox, makes me want to level up my meg and jake so I dont start a game with no perks when I want to use my claudette lol
---
Hag + add ons is like having 4 killers in 1
---
I can't believe that actually scared me
---
Not at all. I have plenty of characters that I don't prestige and keep getting new bloodwebs at 50
---
New main, can't wait.
---
Or you could perform a basic human function and control yourself.
---
They will never hear the sound if they are inside of your terror radius.

I wish I got stuck around rank 13 as that's where I probably belong, it's so stressful dying instantly to a god tier nurse every game
---
I got stuck like this on Asylum on the upper floor. Was there till I got tombstoned, great game. 
---
was there ever actual evidence of that happening or just empty words?
---
No it's usually because they're just awful.
---
That last perk actually sounds pretty cool.
---
This game has very little competition and has been selling really well. Money hasn't been an issue for quite a while. Even if he spends $500, we as a community aren't going to benefit from it, because they can't just throw money at the current bugs and have the magically fixed, and I'm sure plans for future cosmetics and new killer/survivor updates are already in the works for then next two quarters of this year, at minimum. 
---
His extra spending will especially not be beneficial if he decides to move to other consoles or pc.
---
That's awesome! I'm actually working on creating a huntress cosplay myself right now! :D How did you make the orange/red torso part of her clothes! I haven't figured that out yet. Well done with all of it and great photo angle ^^
---
had this happen twice as a surv, the killer DC'd for some reason. *meh*
---
Most of the time i equip all kinds of hex perks and lead them to my totems and generators. Maybe hit a few dudes to get some points as well. And sometimes i outright DC at the start. I am not ready for red ranks lul
---
I see that, but many killers would find out they'd get more bloodpoints from playing the killer they want to and getting a 3\~4K then playing the suggested killer and getting stomped but getting 25% more bloodpoints.
---
I believe what I read on internet if there's evidence which has never been disproved, which there is. And I'm not making you reply, you could've stopped this at any point.
---
The problem with ranks 13-15 is that the killer is starting to understand how the game works (unlike rank 15-20 killers who don't know what they're doing) but survivors still behave like headless chicken. It's basically ALWAYS someone carrying the whole team.
---
sounds more like they couldn't handle getting anything less than a perfect win.
---
You haven't seen me as Wraith yet :P
---
Omg you are a new level of ignorance. Right now. Without me ever meeting you. Im going to call the police on you and accuse you of being a pedo. So by your logic, knowing you have never met me or came into contact, you are still guilty? 
---
Yep, probably. He was literally only doing it to keep   his channel up.

---
Eh. I made it to rank 4 with no add-ons legion before I took a break from them.  Won't get many kills but you have to actively try to not at least safety pip
---
I mean they can say the other people are using crutch perks but they have no room to complain about it
---
It's his money maker,  I'm sure he will come back.

Everyone keeps forgetting that ban evading is bannable so I'm glad you brought it up

I either get toxicity from men turned babies or a "GG, don't want to play you again, too scary"

I dunno man, I've had a good number of matches where Deliverence actually turned things around for my team and I.

Autodidact, great for team plays, paired with Aftercare, *fuhgeddabuddit*. You're gonna be mending wounds faster than the killer can deal them if you're a decent medic.
---
Yeah, obviously you have some Reason to accuse me. I probably did something
---
Its an actual song. Search "Crabrave"
---
Ban evasion and constantly utilizing exploits, such as blocking the killer during a fall so they're forced to DC to do anything, Dead harding onto a spot where no one without ranged (HUNTRESS) can be able to hit them,  etc. And being a toxic twatmuffin.

The developers disagree, and I fully support that stance. You ruining other peoples games shouldn't be a simple fine.

One of the reasons CSGO cheaters keep coming back is that all they need to do is get another account and they can get back to their shit.

---
Hey guys can I get updoots too?
---
No. They are just hanging, even though they should be sacrificing right now
---
I know he hacked in legacy at one point because he lost it when his account got wiped and bhvr wouldn't give it back. So they banned that. The second one I'm unsure.
---
So far Noob3 has been banned for nothing that really hurts others, just go against what bhvr wants. 
---
Ochido though has made videos of him abusing glitches, bullying killers, body blocking survivors (some are his friends and are just jokes), etc. He definitely deserves it 
---
There is indeed some annoyance to my comment, but I did read your post and found it interesting but too familiar. Bear with me because it's late here and I'm sleepy. 
---
You say make him totally invisible, like Freddy, and make him do a non-directional noise like a whistle, so like the Freddy chant. And then there's Echoes of Death, which let's you see survivor auras inside your TR when uncloaking. Freddy sees asleep survivors outside his TR. So basically you turned him into a Freddy rework. I could have started sayig all of this but I wanted to take a fun little jab.
---
The almost invisibility of the Wraith I think serves him just well, you just need to know how to move through the map, something like Myers. You have to choose your position, they'll only see you if there's an open area and if you're close enough. Wraith is not meant to be a jumpscare killer (aside for THAT addon), he's like a worse billy in that his thing is that if he knows your location he will be there ASAP and you won't have time to react. When you see him coming it's already too late. Also his chime makes for a lot of mindgames, and the extra lunge when uncloaking is insane.
---
And the Echoes of Death thing is just too broken, you basically give him a permanent, non-requirement Nurse's Calling. What you propose would need a complete rework of the killer, and that includes perk reworks and a whole add on pool reshape, and that's too much work. You're approach is interesting but too much.
---
And I think the problem with Wraith is that he's too dependant on add ons. Also I want to clarify that I'm not a Wraith main, but I thought you would appreciate my 2 cents.
---
In theory yes, but not every killer knows exactly how when the spot in unintended in the first place. It's still an exploit.
---
I face palmed so hard I forgot what to type
---
I mean, I DID say I know it can't happen. It'd just be neat.
---
check your facts it is all rumors. I hate ochido but he isn't a proven pedofile
---
The best is when you successfully avoid being found by the killer so that you have nothing in evader, and your teammates fucked themselves too much to get altruism, and so after you do two gens you *must* escape if you want to actually pip (and thus get to a level where playing solo survivor is bearable) but that requires you waste a ton of time looking for the hatch while avoiding the killer. Then you still get fuckall for bp too.
---
Damned if you do, damned if you don't. I stick with killer, except for some reason wait times are terrible, almost like people don't like playing survivor.
---
Don‚Äôt feed the troll guys
---
I agree Ochido needs to be further investigated on the ‚Äúpedo claims‚Äù but i 100% disagree with the other part!
---
Alot of people get falsely accused and prosecuted because someone just ‚Äúfelt like it‚Äù.
---
Its not something to joke about.
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
There‚Äôs screen shots ? That‚Äôs facts. 
---
Now you see me, now you don't
---
I don't care if they ban me, as a killer if there are 3 survivors in that game I am DCing. I'm not playing a game that survivors won't enjoy, and I won't enjoy.
---
Give it 10min if the games not over it's a bug send the pic to behavior via Twitter or something
---
wait hes downed
---
Removing the fps lock actually causes this exact bug.  I decided to cap my fps at 50 and this bug has never happened to me once, but as soon as I tested going above 75 fps it started happening.  Just cap ur fps to 60 or lower
---
Couldn't have said it better

I don't think you got the joke.
---

They had an intense argument which prompted Tapp to just walk off. 
---
Nice. Got any tips on playing Legion?
---
After the other 3 were dead, it was like 15 minutes and this guy was nowhere to be found, at the hatch, at gens, in usual locations, and I just wanted to stop playing but I wanted the points
---
I assumed that he was just waiting around, getting more time points so I got annoyed at him when he didn't leave, so I wentTo check the hatch, he wasn't there. I sent him the "please leave" message when I was walking away and when I got back, he was waiting in the basement for me. He sent me the message about not being able to find it, so I signed, slugged him and too him there, but I thought it was kinda funny. We're in this together, buddy. 
---
So I dropped him on the hatch and he just sat there for two minutes. I was on my phone when the match finally ended, and I was shocked when I looked up to see he had disconnected
---
implying rank matters
---
Oh so I'm a dick for reporting someone who is breaking the rules? Stfu
---
He just yeets himself trough the window
---
Best part was chat saying that he should get a lawyer and file a lawsuit LULW
---
What perks do you enjoy on Legion? And what is your strategy for success with him?
---
When you loop the killer around a pallet and he refuses to break it
---
Omg yes Thank God! But, he will come back. We need to be ready!

I found a sweater that had a pretty chunky-ribbed knit and just cut it and sewed it onto another shirt! The knit kinda gave it a nice texture that you can see in the reference pics from the game. 
---
and he RQ like a bitch too, I am glad I can't hear the survivors in this like in F13th 
---
No0b3 isn‚Äôt toxic anymore, he plays by the rules 
---
yeah because a guaranteed win is fun as fuck 
---
This. I absolutely love when someone loops me for a second, thinks I'm going to chase more, and just walks to the other side of the pallet to see me trapping it. The amount of "fuck fuck fuck fuck" you can see going through their mind is just priceless
---
Looks great! I love Frank and Legion art always makes me happy.
---
I believe you are talking about the Romeo and Juliet law. It varies by state whether it is a thing or not. My state does not possess it. And yes it doesn't matter in the eyes of the law. If you're an adult and you ask a girl that is below the age of consent or is not within the romeo and juliet law age, you will be seen as a pedophile.
---
Update: i took a screenshot from each corner of the map. http://imgur.com/a/96C6OSj
---
They also claim that they have left the game, but it is still going
---
I definitely appreciate the 2 cents, its the kind of comments I was hoping for, you're first one was just the exact antithesis of that lol. however I definitely see now how that could be an issue and how broken it would be. I literally know nothing about Freddys kit besides people calling him shit tier. I only know the killers I play and survivor stuff for the sake of countering it. I agree that his reliance on addons is a huge problem but I still think he needs more map presence or awareness. He can get places fast yeah, but he has no reference for where he should go, just a slower billy with no instadown. (I mostly play Billy and Hag btw) I just really wanna use him and have been trying to concept out a fix, yet everything ends up being OP.
---
I think it would be pathetic if OP was obsessive over it and let it take over his life. I don't think it's pathetic to put some text on a dumb meme. Just me.
---
Thompson house is the best map for that, yank them off the gen on the second floor of the house. Works better if a chase leads you there and you know someone else is up there, the person on the gen will think you're blinking after the other person and stay on the gen since they can't see you. I imagine the second best map would be Gideon meat plant. Its all about vertical blinks for that achievement.
---
I had the luck of playing a few weeks after rank reset and getting less experienced survivors.
---
Yeah, but he has to grind to get all the good perks again LUL
---
I had this happen to me. Dude held the game hostage for so long.
---
It‚Äôs hard finding an urban evading nea on that black water swamp map. I told him to take the hatch, I left the game on and decided to start my homework. It was maybe a good 10-15 mins later that the game finally ended.
---
He literally has a seires called "Once upon a toxic ______"
---
Its a three strikes and your out thing. first two bans are account based and the third is a machine ban.
---
I love speed wraith, he‚Äôs so cool
---
I saw his ban screen you dumb fuck it literally said banned for griefing
---
If he does then BHVR will tear him apart. 
---
D i s g u s t a n g....
---
Don't get to close to them but if you have to use a hazmat suit
---
So? Monto has a series that‚Äôs WAY more toxic. No0b3 just goes for the adept achievements if you actually watch them
---
That would be .. like ... his whole stream.

---
His chat was legit trying to get him to sue
---
I don't view trapping a hook with the hag and then teleporting to the trap as "camping", though. I view it as survivors not being careful to crouch past my traps and being punished for it. So MYC sounds like a fantastic choice for me. 
---
Fam... You should have censored his name, people could witch hunt him
---
Agreed.
---
You said above he was banned for PC ban evasion. His screen said griefing, so you're wrong. 
---
After a quick Google, apparently this is quite a common bug. If they have left the game like they say they have, then just continue to wait it out. Apparently the game will eventually register their sacrifice and end the match. 
---
Yeah it's rough, it's funny, mine was also a Nea, and it was one of the swamps (not the one with the middle boat) so maybe there's a theme üòÇ 
---
The hatch was literally in one of the square corners of the map, I'd better seem one there before, I was glad I wasn't the survivor looking for it
---
Finally a relatable tier list 
---
Ok, thanks
---
Okay I celebrated getting out of that awful newbie queue despite having 400 hours of rank 1 killer/survivor  
---
It's not hard, I was very lazy and didn't want to be a survivor, but my god was it painful to experience.  
---
With nurse too.
---
That‚Äôs because they‚Äôre a bunch of 12 year olds who don‚Äôt even understand how the law works.

Keep us posted!

I know that's why I made this meme. I got a good laugh about it! üòÇ

They dont ban for ban evasion until the 3rd ban. If you've been banned once or twice and but a new account you wont be banned. After being banned for a third time they will ban any new accounts.

_THIS IS SO CUTE_

How can Michael only be A tier?
---
These comments are really disappointing.   
---
Why are people are acting like this guy ran over their freakin' dog or something, lol.  
---
It seems really extreme to hate this guy for his playstyle or because he shined a light on glitches and bugs (fix your spaghetti code bhvr! loooove youuuuu&lt;3) to the point to where you're happy he can't play his favorite game. If it's more than that, I'm totally open to enlightenment. Also,I'm not sure it's ban evasion to play on a different system, but I do think he might've been told not to stream the game (unsure tbh). Other than that, I do wonder why he was banned because it so far I haven't seen a reason and that's a little alarming...
---
You could theoretically get all 25 on the same survivor in the same match, despite how the wording on the achievement sounds.
---
Ok i heard of nudes but not underage that's just terrible
---
Nah he will get banned instantly
---
Even after explaining its a joke, you still fail to see that IT IS A JOKE.
---
This is the 4th time he was banned actually
---
The perfect thing is the end game chat no Salt
---
Nah I like him too. I‚Äôm gonna keep supporting him.

How is it a joke?

It happens. This time last week, it took me about an hour to find a match. Recently I‚Äôve been finding matches within 2 mins. 
---
Well at least it's not a Legion is good post. That would triggered everyone or mostly everyone.
---
Not guilty until proven so
---
The first time he got banned he claimed he "didn't know why" so either he thinks his fanbase are a bunch of brainless 2 year olds or he's actually managed to trick himself into thinking it's true.
---
Thank goodness 
---
It is a penalty to each person for their individual contribution. That way 4 people can't pop a gen in 20s. So if you are alone, you repair at 100% speed, two people each repair at 90%. It still goes faster, because you're still repairing faster than 100% as a team, but the individual repair speeds are slower. 
---
Mathematically it would be something like this c/s is charge per second per survivor
---
Formula would be 80 / (# Survivors * Efficiency Penalty) = time to repair a generator from 0 to full. 
---
1 Survivor: 1 c/s, (80/1) =80 seconds
---
2 Survivor: .9 c/s, (80/1.8) = 44.4 Seconds
---
3 survivor: .8 c/s, (80/2.4) = 33.3 seconds
---
4 survivor: .7c/s (80/2.8) = 28.6 Seconds
---
So I believe would be slower than previously.  In the case of a single gen it is still faster to repair the more survivors you had on it. Theoretically, following this pattern, the peak efficiency of a single generator, if it could have an infinite number of survivors working on it, the most efficient amount would be 7, with a total c/s of 3.5, and would complete a gen in a little over 22 seconds.
---
This also gives diminishing returns. I may do the math later, but I believe it is still more efficient to do gens solo than to co-op them given there are 5 gens total. I might make a spread sheet for this.
---
see previous thread hon, and what is it with people giving such nasty unhelpful replies, no wonder my friends told me y'all were toxic. 
---
Hahaha, bloody idiots
---
I get that you're attracted to men, but really? You put freddy over Pig and Huntress? I am attacted to females, but I'd still put michael over hag
---
Had mostly great experiences in 8 hours of play today! Only time I had salt was a streamer, went to his stream and asked why he was so mean. He was very nice about it and apologized if it was offensive. NastyNate69 (as well as everyone else I played today), I appreciate you reducing the game's toxicity today!
---
Looks like he is prepared to suicide all over again
---
Ohh somebody is a salty boy. Watch your mouth kiddo, you‚Äôre griefing me, you might catch a perma-ban since that‚Äôs the punishment. Because somebody could possibly grief anybody that much in two days to get a ban. His last offence on pc was because of a witch-hunt aka causing ‚Äúgrief‚Äù. You should get that anger checked out, it‚Äôs not healthy 
---
[removed]
---
Wait until they get him for ban-evasion-ban evasion. Ooooh he‚Äôs gonna be so pissed!
---
First off, no one asked you. Second off, what a fucking stupid comment. 
---
This could have had so much more potential. I don't know why Ardetha decided to fuck it up with that shitshow in the first half of the video.
---
Me too! Disconnecting is so pathetic. It‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be this hard to accept that you lost. 
---
Bless Mcote, he's adorable. Clueless, but adorable.
---
I love how he said "this is illegal" after getting banned !
---
Most glitches like this require the killer to stand at a certain angle and lunge at the area
---
I know this because some guy did this to me on Backwater and spent the entire match up there. Fortunately he was nice enough to teach me how to do it so I could deal with it if it happened again
---
Nah, just don't understand people who chime in out of nowhere for the sole purpose of being an ass. 
---
Reason why i play other less shit games like Black Ops 4. At least that shit works now
---
IKR that's fucking hilarious hahahaha 
---
Mistakes were made.
---
I‚Äôm glad you posted that link to BHVR‚Äôs Twitter so I can slam it your oblivious face. It clearly says console report and banning is now live on January 25th. You‚Äôre telling me you think everything BHVR says is the truth? You‚Äôre a gullible fool, if everyone got 100 blood points for every lie a BHVR rep spoke nobody would need to use a glitch to get their useless prestige. I have literally never had the displeasure of speaking to someone so ignorant. For somebody with hippie in their name sure sure are very hostile 
---
I was replying in the context of the reply. The guy was saying that smacking someone like this was toxic, and you came in and said it wasn't. That's what I was replying to. If a survivor was being toxic, sure, but I'd had killers do that to me just because I looped them for a while. THAT'S toxic.
---
She killed you. But also the killer was kinda an ahole for not going for that claude instead of farming you.
---
plays trapper with basement build and mori. come and get itttttttt
---
A killer shouldn‚Äôt need top-tier add-ons to be viable. Besides SWF hard counters Trapper. Once one of them sees a trap, the whole group knows where it is.
---
And time spent setting up traps is free time for the survivors to do gens. 
---
Where‚Äôd you find this out? I don‚Äôt see any official posts about it. Or are you just assuming it because they said they were gonna ban perma-ban dodgers on PS4 too? 
---
but you can set custom buttons?
---
Memes.
---
Jokes aside these perks actually aren't awful, though the second is basically just Bloodhound that also affects Scratch Marks and the third could perhaps use a slight buff.

---
Oh yeah forgot to add that you said, "Because I whack you once after I hook you?" and didn't mention anything about toxicity from the survivor. That's what made me think you were defending killers who did that. 
---
There‚Äôs a link to a yt vid somewhere in the thread 
---
You must be a BHVR employee since you think you know so much, or maybe you‚Äôre a BHVR employee because you‚Äôre absolutely clueless 
---
He's pretending that he was "unfairly banned."
---
I don't mean to be that guy, but don't consoles have some sorta... share feature?
---
cake upvote
---
Modding legacy if I am correct. His first account had a recovery issue and he lost all his progress or something (the devs couldn‚Äôt give it back to him? Can‚Äôt remember exactly what happened) and so he set up a new account and modded his legacy. For some reason some unnamed person gathered a bunch of evidence of cheating from different streamers/youtubers and got a bunch of people banned. Noob3 was one of them. He has a video that explains it in great detail.
---
... huh. Been playing since console release, and I never knew that. 
---
The killer was definitely not in the wrong here, you can‚Äôt blame a killer for the survivor farming. Doesn‚Äôt really make sense. 
---
Eh, he slugs with a vengeance, which is at least as "toxic" as camping or tunnelling (read: it isn't toxic, just another efficient win strategy that can be annoying/boring for the survivors), and he does return to and check on his hooks regularly, and also ends up hooking survivors back-to-back, at times certainly intentionally. Once games get closer, he also utilizes those tactics more liberally.
---
It's just that his games are rarely close.  And that's because he vastly outclasses the survivors he faces in the vast majority of his matches. I mean, that is to be expected: his average lobby probably doesn't even match half his playtime when you take all four survivors' hours combined. But it's also that he's certainly one of the very best killer players in the game, while the survivor players he goes up against most of the time are really not some of the best survivor players in the game, to put it mildly. It is painfully obvious that, on average, they are not even good at basic levels of play, making a multitude of obvious mistakes, which he also finds himself pointing out almost every single round. One big thing being that people play into his slugging headlessly; they could be progressing gens but feel the need to pressure for saves on slugs, not even so much as giving them time to recover first, while also not giving themselves a chance to a proper chase scenario, dying quickly getting caught out in the open against a Nurse/Billy/Huntress (not that they last long in a standard chase either, though). Count how often he gets looped even just around a single pallet tile - the most basic bread-and-butter play of any survivor to stall time, yet something you do not see very much of in his games, because the survivors don't regularly play cerebrally enough, or not with enough experience, to force him into standard chase scenarios. I mean, even against killers that are nowhere near as good as Zubat is at chasing and slugging and applying pressure fast that way, the average lobby's gen pressure and chase game is really rather lacking. So it's no surprise they tend to fall completely apart against such an efficient fast-pace pressure playstyle in the hands of such an experienced and skilled player.
---
He also not seldomly uses strong addons despite already hardly being challenged without them - and just because he's aware that it's bullshit doesn't make it less bullshit. He gets annoyed in his survivor games with some of the same stuff he does to others. So I don't know what you define as "toxic gameplay", but 4-slugging most teams at 1-2 gens done - let alone with Nurse, ranged Nurse, and such - is definitely not fun for survivors. At least it's over with quickly...
---
I wonder how he is not growing bored of it. He is rarely actually challenged in his killer games, and he knows how subpar many of the players he goes up against are (not least because he's a solid survivor player himself, and just generally knowledgable about "proper" play). That he doesn't change up his killers, builds and strategies, or generally go for more standard-chase-centric playstyles, is weird to me. I don't outclass the survivors I tend to face nearly as much as he does, and I still get bored of the repetitiveness of "optimal" killer gameplay. Using various different killers/builds and playing for "fair" chases makes it fun for me, despite my kill/escape ratios not being as lopsided. For one simple but telling example of this, back-revving isn't really fun; once you get good at it, your back-revvs should be nigh-impossible to dodge - there's not a whole lot of interactive or exciting gameplay there. Rather than chasing survivors until they run out of resources or make a mistake and you can backrev them, you can try and do tricky and flashy things with the chainsaw on tileplay and medium distances, especially using a combination of steering, sprint and charge speed add-ons. But he hardly ever does that. His gameplay is impressively solid and drilled-in, but not usually very fancy or fun.
---
If I seem displeased with Zubat, it's more of a general sentiment: I used to enjoy watching good killers stream, but now it's pretty boring, because they are only rarely challenged. This is more-so due to most survivors simply not being up to par, but that is just another issue, namely that I get to see first-hand the type of survivors I get paired up and frustrated with in my survivor queues.
---
On that note, this perkless gameplay session was a nice change of pace, and I enjoyed watching some of it.
---
Their‚Äôs a reason those two are so common. Why not address the cause (gen times and the lack of balance around voice coms) then nerfing the two killers who stand a chance against a good SWF team. Nerfing the golden duo of DbD won‚Äôt convince more people to play killers like Trapper or Leatherface, instead they‚Äôll just stop playing killer entirely.
---
Fix SWF and then yes you can nerf them, The Nurse does break the game, but so does SWF.
---
Nice!!!!! Thanks for posting this. I smiled from ear to ear. Split my face open I was smiling so hard.
---
This is, legit, one of the gayest gaming communties I've ever been a part of and I fucking love it.
---
My friend and I were on springwood once against a Nurse. I had made it out so I was spectating my friend who has stayed behind to try and help the randoms. He was the last left after the two randoms died. He was being chased hard  and went into the school by the big hole in the floor and the nurse blinked at him but fell through the hole to the basement and he ran out lol. 
---
*cof* *cof* ^Shirtless Myers *cof* *cof
---
I see now, is she beginner friendly like Dwight and Jake are?
---
Man, people sure are taking a shitpost super seriously
---
Hey, thank you so much for all this info. I used to only play survivor, but as I venture a bit into being a killer, I definitely think it's helpful to know both sides of the game. 
---
I'll definitely check those people out, and I definitely believe you that Hag and Spirit are good killers...and not just because Hag is the only one I am currently able to be decent at. :)
---
Thanks again, and good luck to you too! :D
---
LEts sUR BhVR
---
Thanks for all the info. I had no idea he did this shit, I thought he was just some rando "making" crappy content
---
Like it's hard or something
---
You‚Äôre sure they didn‚Äôt find a key in a chest? That wouldn‚Äôt show up in the post-match screen.
---
I hate to say this, but I kind of agree. He can easily catch up to you while he's invisible and all he has to do is run right behind you, ring his bell and he gets a free sprint boost to whack you. His only counter is really sprint burst or a window with a long wall. Even with sprint burst or if he misses, just go invisible again, run up behind them, and bam another hit. 
---
It's still faster overall but it's not twice as fast if there are two people. It takes you 80 seconds to do one alone. But two people don't make it take 40 seconds. So it is less than 80 but each person is slower.
---
I may have explained that shitty. 
---
Ochisoo wont get unbanned
---
Dont bother
---
\*sans noises 
---
Yeah, I hear you. I've been playing the game since December of 2016, so I'm pretty inured to people telling me to kill myself, that I'm garbage, etc. and very, very rarely get mad, but for some reason, this dude got under my skin.
---
Partly it's that I resent being called a cheater, partly it's his attitude, and partly it's that he has a clip catalog full of him naming and shaming "lag switchers," the vast majority of whom probably weren't doing anything wrong.
---
Something about the combination of idiot confidence that he was being victimized, his attitude, and the inability to think "oh, wait, I'm streaming in 1080p and my latency is red" just really fucking irked me in a way that I haven't had before in DBD, idk.
---
Is there any actual evidence that he is, in fact, a pedophile. I havent seen anybody post any solid proof that he is just acquisitions and hearsay. Dont get me wrong, im not defending the guy, im just legitimately curious. This new culture we live in where we blame someone of doing something without any evidence and it automatically becomes fact no matter what, is saddening. 
---
I think with the bug if they DC at any point it continues to show that they are there.
---
I don‚Äôt like OchiDo lmao, need to contact them for another reason
---
Literally everyone : hating Ochido.
---
I bet your instagrm is full of stolen and unfunny memes
---
Typical ochidoo fan
---
Does this mean Killers can't lobby scum any more if they see a SWF group?
---
That‚Äôs not slow motion that‚Äôs just PS4 gameplay. 
---
None of them had items, and like I said I camped the hatch waiting 
---
What is it made of? 
---
I chased them during the game, and camped the hatch. I also didn't get a disconnect bonus.
---
I main doctor but I play all killers and I play survivor too. It'd just be way too much of a grind again. Getting all killers and survivors to 40 was a pain I went further and prestige 3 50d everyone but Huntress, Leather face, and Trapper because I won't ever use those 
---
" I don't care about lack of evidence, if someone accuses you of something it's most likely true."
---
https://www.apnews.com/47524e930a434068a819bc0cd4646b38
---
Because if they believed every person who was accused of doing something illegal. Stuff like this would happen alot more. The students in that story lost scholarships, went into debt because of school, and literally had their lives ruined because the girl claimed she was raped so she could lie about cheating on her boyfriend. To say evidence isn't required is a joke
---
I do not like Ochido, nor am I defending him, I am stating that you cannot believe every accusation. 
---
TLDR: OP is an idiot
---
Hope you guys like the backstory we made! As well as the idea
---
And you‚Äôre sure they escaped? You saw the escape symbol show up?
---
Good work. Keep at it. Extra points for the murder basement backdrop. 
---
No the game just ended. No one escaped. No one disconnected.
---
Nah ur good boss. I knew two people on a gen didn‚Äôt make it 40 seconds, but it never occurred to me *both* people‚Äôs repair speed was also reduced. 
---
Yeah... So some time after you chased them they DCed. You camping the hatch doesn't affect that. And if things aren't worked as intended (they aren't), then it's not surprising that you didn't get the bonus.
---
Give me about 10 minutes and I'll be calm, sir.
---
Busty baboon 
---
Final Cutter spam
---
&gt;second time he was banned without a reason right?
---
No. Why would BHVR risk banning and pushing away high profile dbd streamers and YouTubers with no good reason? Nearly everyone who gets banned always lies about their innocence.
---
I don't remember to scenario well (so correct me, someone, if it's wrong) but he lied about no wrongdoing initially and even dedicated a video to the subject of criticising the Devs and the game but then eventually admitted he inventory modded and has said to have learned his lesson. Good for him for admitting it at least but his initial reaction to the situation gave me a sour impression of him.
---
Hopefully he really has learned from it.
---
See, there's the good ones where you actually have to appreciate the artists talent, and then there's those ones where no matter how much you like these sexual drawings you can't understand how the artist fucked up so bad.
---
The only thing calm here is a shitty jake park perk fam cuz im going full sicko mode right now

You must be really insecure to talk to people you disagree with like that.

Gives you access to a trumpet

---
I'm usually between rank 1-5. It takes me forever to get there now though because I seem to have literally just the absolute worst luck possible on this game. (Most games actually so fm)
---
I personally think it's becoming more of a PS4/console problem. I don't have SWF groups to play with anymore, but even then in the past that didn't really matter much. In fact I a lot of the time did better without being dragged down by a group. (I usually end up doing something stupid to save a friend or a friend does something stupid and gets us both killed. No big deal, it's whatever. But now, even in the off chance I do have a friend (also high rank) it never seems to matter. One of us is usually the target of some sort of shit. A bug, Tunneling, face-camping, traitorous teammates, exploits, etc. there's just so many things that seem to go wrong now that's ya made the game virtually unplayable. At least without wanting to throw the controller and the console in the trash. 
---
I find lag switchers all the time. But another one I find a lot is something I don't know the name of. It could be a bug, but it happens pretty often and usually happens with a suspicious killer. I find a lot of killers that have this thing that makes you die on hook in less than 30 seconds. No struggling to unhook yourself to lower the timer, and it's your first hook. They usually proxy camp no farther than 20 meters from you. They seem to have twice the speed they are supposed too, all of their action speeds are increased, they know where everyone is at all times, and there's pretty much no way to counter play them because if they choose to go for you, they WILL get you. Sometimes when you hit struggle stage on hook, it either instant kills you or my personal favorite, struggles for you. If it struggles for you, you can't let go. When your timer runs out? You're still there and not dead and can do nothing. Teammate tries to unhook you? They simply can't. It will start the animation and do one of two things:
---
- Just complete the animation but do nothing. They can keep trying, but won't be able to save you and sometimes the interaction prompt(and therefore capability) just goes away forever.
---
- Freeze the survivor attempting to save you permanently in place. Every time this one has happened, the killer had instantly come back to the hook (sometimes they had left sometimes they were just within eyesight) and pulled/grabbed the frozen survivor from the frozen animation. Basically it's a trap to get another survivor on the hook. 
---
Sometimes when this happens there also some debuff everyone has for all actions. A healing debuff for no reason, Repair debuff for no reason, Etc. I see it a lot now. I've met a few other people who have been seeing it too, and I've seen video of pc players facing similar suspicious activity and confirming that the killers doing this are in fact using some sort of exploit. But my problem is with this being on console and the complete bullshit farce of "We can't do anything to help on console because Sony and Microsoft won't let us or work with us!" Is simply unacceptable at this point. Things have gotten completely out of hand on console. Some players are lucky and rarely encounter these things, but that doesn't mean the rest of us should suffer. We paid for this game too. We paid for cosmetics and dlc too. Refusal to fix these issues for months on end is a clear showing that BHVR doesn't care about their community, or their content quality. They simply care about money. Classic case of small developer hitting it big enough to become just like all the other greedy dev teams that let the money and power go to their heads. 
---
Until they seriously fix issues, and listen to their community, the game will continue to die. If they don't fix it? It will die, because it already is and fast. Even some of the top players, YouTubers and streamers that help the Devs promote the game are starting to get sick of the constant crap. Developers need to learn, if you ignore your consumer/community/fan base, for too long...you're going to kill your game. I've seen it happen so many times, and frankly I'm sick of putting money down on something that I'm meant to have fun with and enjoy only to end up angry, feeling ripped off, and literally sometimes cannot even play because it's just not possible.
---
 It's like when the old SOE Devs on DCUO ignored their community for years and look what happened? At the peak of the game being expanded and overhauled, a very large percentage of its community abandoned it, ESPECIALLY on console. The game crashed all the time, people lost progress, sending report tickets to Devs for things like lost progress and items literally being deleted from inventory, loot not dropping in high tier raids,  and game breaking bugs often went unanswered and unresolved. There were things that were totally broken and sections/levels that were literally unplayable no matter what because of bugs that never got fixed until it was already too late. Those Devs paid for it in the end. The same will happen to BHVR if this continues. 
---
Tldr; If BHVR doesn't get their shit together there won't be a DBD anymore because people will simply move on to a game that works and has a dev team that also works. 
---

Sorry for the low quality, but I assumed the easiest way to take it would be using my phone.
---
Little more context:
---
I was Doctor, killed 3 of them, and saw this guy at the gate. Backed off a bit, let him leave and then sent him a message asking if he grabbed his toolbox or an item. Said he did and also asked if I was the Doctor. Told him yes, and what follows is the messages in the pic. Just trying to spread some kindness in what I‚Äôve seen to be a moderately toxic community, (No offence).
---
Oh didn't hear about this 
---
When they also have toth but you just can‚Äôt resist 
---
so Jake, Dwight and Meg are beginner friendly? like how hillbilly, Wraith and Trapper are beginner friendly killers? someone said a DLC killer is beginner friendly none of them are tbh, someone said the huntress and legion.
---
I personally believe only the base game killers are beginner friendly.
---
flashlights by themselves are not bm. spamming right click while having one is, and that's what these survivors were doing.
---
"apparently"
---
Nah
---
I played against a killer earlier today who camped and said "that's just how the game works" in his defense
---
üòí
---
Shit I didn‚Äôt know this and was subbed to him. Now I‚Äôm unsubbing 
---
Not at all. I can just judge your character by defending toxicity. 
---
Blood warden and STBFL can be more entertaining than useful but still very useful imo 
---
This is a big change from the msg I got after being nice. Two players dc'd as soon as they got hooked because they had ran right at me while the other two were trying to play normally so I let them do generators and farm pallets off of me since they would have gone down fast. I let them escape and one of them msgs me calling me all sorts of nasty things and how I was a moron for letting them go.
---
Wake Up has no purpose for not new players. You can just run Leader and stand near the gate instead. The25% increase for everything is always better than the solo 15%, even if Wake Up doesn't get used
---
Aww fuck, sorry dude. Some people are just pricks that don‚Äôt understand the word ‚ÄúKindness‚Äù.
---
The fact you've used to outdated "chief" meme is saddening but yh your point is correct
---
Yeah the four starter survivors; Claudette, Jake, Dwight, and Meg are all easy to use and useful
---
The trapper is easy to use but only effective against other beginners, wraith is good in most ranks, hillbilly is extremely good but takes some practice, huntress and nurse are also free. The nurse is amazing but also takes practice and then huntress can be good with once again some practice
---
Legion is only really good with specific add-one would not recommend
---
Let me ask you this now here me out would you like to get banned for the way that you like to play? Some people find it fun I don't know how but they do. But even still they are playing the game in 1 of the few ways they can.

Because camping is a valid strategy in some situations. 
---
If I‚Äôm a killer and the survivors swarm to the hook every time I hook someone, I will camp. You know that they aren‚Äôt doing gens, so why would you leave?
---
Do gens. That‚Äôs the way to counter camping
---
Like, the game is bad enough with some people idk why they be mean to people who wanna be nice? I'm not gonna stop being nice but I'm also not going to read anymore msgs from people either :/
---
That Zubat and I needed NOED on lower tier killers to win, when he very frequently says only bad killers use NOED.
---
Also we never use NOED, so he was just lying at that point too.
---
As a former Huntress Main, I very much appreciate this Huntress cosplay. Very nice. 
---
Extremely toxic player and a pedophlie.
---
Even if he did get banned, He'd proably just quit playing, he's already proably going to quit the game anyway.
---
Too manly you mean.
---
No but you‚Äôll gain a bad reputation and some survivors will get you killed whenever they see you. 
---
Haven't seen anyone defending him...
---
I mean, it's just as easy for someone in a SWF group to say, "He has Nurse's, I just lost a stack of Distortion while healing," as it is to say, "I see on the end-game screen that he has Nurse's." They both involve giving you information that you wouldn't have had 2 seconds prior.
---
Can you send me this please.
---
I love this subreddit where we keep trash talking each other over DS and NOED but we can come together with this.
---
If they are outside of the terror radius, about 8m for a rough guess.
---
Lmfao I love how you used that against him. üòÇ
---
This. Even if you're camped, keep struggling, buy time for the others.
---
He said if he gets banned again he will quit once on stream, but why would he quit if he doesn‚Äôt get banned?
---
Leatherface if you don't already have BBQ and Chili from shrine, otherwise I'd probably pick pig
---
It seriously sucks, but if a killer is honestly that stupid to keep camping when gens are popping every few seconds they deserve to take the L with that single kill
---
This makes me wanna cry because PTSD AHHHHHHHHHH 
---
Seriously so relatable, and of course it's PS4 so even more so. God I hate DBD on PS4 so much now. 
---
Gratz! It's a proud moment the first time, own it and love it!
---
Sadly it loses its luster and you wish you could stay in the green ranks eventually, but man... that first time is awesome.
---
Yeah that too, there were so many reasons for his ban
---
Yes
---
Yeah. Had a game earlier where I used Bloody Streamers, a guy Infiniloaded so I just let the survivors farm off me with the bonus BP.
---
Sue for what lol? It‚Äôs no different from getting banned from a store 
---
It's about goddamn time. 
---
I love this
---
This is the type of content that I'm here for
---
Oh man, I didn‚Äôt know you could do teachable perks. I heard BBQ and Chili is the best one but I though you could only get it with leatherface! Nice 
---
400 sacrifices? 
---
Yep... 
---
Do not bully people!
---
I think he tried eating you
---
Look at this! Look at what you have done!
---
He clearly likes it!
---
Honestly the killer was in the right here. I‚Äôm not saying camping is the answer or fun but to not even punish by doing gens? It would be one thing if it was an intentional exploit abuse or blatant cheating but it wasn‚Äôt. The ultimate counter to not getting camped is not getting hooked in the first place. This is why I‚Äôm a fan of games that punish leavers/abandons/Intentional DC‚Äôs. 
---
Im not sure if youre outing your friend for being a toxic little jerk or if you thought this was funny...
---
Completely agree
---
This is what SWF is for, most games with a solo queue the odds are things won‚Äôt be very coordinated. 
---
the "you're bad so stop playing" attitude is so stupid. like if the person is legitimately bad, how the fuck are they gonna get better if they don't play?
---
That left and right shift is the survivor wiggling, you move left and right at random when the survivor struggles.
---
I haven't played wraith, but I've seen a lot of game play on him, and personally I don't think he needs more invisibility to be fixed, you already have no terror radius or red stain when cloaked, and adding the whispers or chime whenever he is cloaked would be a massive nerf to him, where there would be no point in cloaking. As for revealing the survivors locations when uncloaking, it's a decent idea on concept but it would just end up in cloaking and uncloaking until you find someone to initiate chase with, which is already doctor, you're buffing. You're focused too much on map pressure, which is already something he has going for him imo, you're able to sneak up on survivors, and by the time they see you, you already see them, the biggest problem with wraith is chase proficiency, which you didn't even touch, so even if you were to add all of these in, he would still be the same wraith but you can find survivors easier. If I were to buff wraith I would make his wailing bell do something in chase, the only thing that helps him are add-ons that make his speed while cloaked faster, allowing him to body block, however you shouldn't have to put add-ons on a killer to make them playable.
---
How fucjing broken he game is.
---
You are looking for people to tell you that you were in the right and he deserves it. Jokes on you. You and your mates are the entitled pussys who leave and then flame. 
---
Let your lightly salted survivor hang for an hour or so and then place them on the grill for 10 minutes or until sizzling, spread your choice of BBQ and Chili on the survivor, grill for another 15-20 minutes, and it is ready to serve. Enjoy your Mori while all the other survivors tea bag in the exit gates. For a healthier meal and reducing your sodium intake, avoid the post game chat as it will be rich in salt.
---
Confirmed on MySpace too
---
So you think he‚Äôd quit his job because the game is slightly buggy?
---
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
---
yea its a game just on discord at the moment but they are planning on expanding :)
---
Has anyone else PS4 have no heart beats for ANY killer? Like I get music cues when they are chasing me but was going against leather faces and Billy‚Äôs with no terror radius reducing add ons or perks yet never got any
---
Entity IS  a cat
---
I cant be assed to find it, but it was in one of their weekly dev videos they did. I remember it was meg because I remember saying to myself "why change her skin color, instead of making her claudette?" After they mentioned it   it was megs alpha version.
---
Now when you say dc lobby dodge do you mean leaving during the match or before fully loading in to the match? 
---
There's no need to call names dude. 
---
nope, but if you are that David that unhooked me in the basement with a Tier3 Myers, Two times in a row, Fuck you and please Step on a lego
---
I... you... what?
---
While I hate camping, I don‚Äôt think it should be a reportable offense. You can always heavily punish the killer by doing the gens or use borrowed time if you encounter a lot of campers. Just like how survivors pallet loop all the time and it‚Äôs annoying, it should not be reportable either.
---
Why tf does this not have more upvotes 
---
This is incredible OP I am terrified of you
---
Tunneling is shitty. Don't spit any other way. You can always feel bad for the farmed survivor and go for the stupid rescuer.
---
Well funny enough, I don‚Äôt like playing with scrubs who facecamp then get more kills with NOED. If you don‚Äôt see a problem in that, then you‚Äôre ignorant. 
---
Happy cake day x2
---
Nice
---
tell me what you guys think about this situation
---
Asking gamers to pursue a fun time by sitting there &amp; doing nothing, for an extremely underwhelming amount of bloodpoints is a bit unreasonable.
---
You need a shit ton of disconnects to trigger a ban though, and from what I've read it's typically a week on the first offense.
---
Not sure about the pedo bit but people hate him because he exploits the game
---
Exactly!
---
Before the match.
---
Goddamn Myers is a licensed character, I'd enjoy seeing him using a pig mask!
---
Tell that to Valve. The same people keep getting caught by the VAC ban-wave and have for years. 
---
aren't there like screenshots from underage girls that would frequent his chats where he asked them for nudes and shit?
---
Slightly buggy? You sure we're playing the same dead by daylight?  Cause in my dbd the hitboxes are broken as fuck, it has the most unfun shit to play against, connections so bad you can be working on gen then suddenly be on the hook.
---
Damm
---
Don't there's a way to report lobby dodgers. 
---
Kek
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
That‚Äôs lag switching 
---
ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
The thing is it will take forever, and the killer might prefer to leave.
---
Ochido. Extremely toxic dbd YouTuber/ streamer who also just so happens to be a fucking pedo. 
---
Asked underage fans for nudes... tried to get Jendenise (dbd streamer) to break up with her boyfriend Scottjund (another dbd streamer) so she could be with him (which she obviously declined) oh and did I mention him being a pedo 
---
Not every killer wants to farm because it can be boring. Maybe he wanted to get that match finished as fast as possible. If i were the killer i would have farmed. I also farm in 3v1 when the map is bad or i have a good day
---
Salty survivors, just look at some of the ridiculous comments haha it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about being toxic I‚Äôm talking about the satisfaction of taking down someone who‚Äôs toxic‚Äù
---
Unfortunately, no. I think i am just gonna leave, i have stuff i want to do tonight XD
---
Also thanks hahaha
---
What is "intentional game play abuse" ?
---
oh thank you. here have a completely pointless internet point.
---

---
Wait a minute, Frank? You're in this subreddit? What are you doing out of /r/DarkestDungeon? I should've gotten this game sooner.
---
I try to help my teammates every game. Then they farm me and leave me for dead. I have given up on helping randoms.
---
Before they fixed it you could 4 man a gen in like 20 seconds 
---
Funny that you're on Xbox. I'm an Xbox player, and I'm constantly getting DCing survivors. As killer, and survivor. It's so annoying
---
*Roundabout song starts playing*
---
It didn't work until this patch, up until now you got 400% repair but they fixed it.
---
T3 here refers to Evil Within, which is The Shape's power (which has three phases; T3 = tier 3). At tier 3, The Shape can vault windows noticeably faster than most Killers.  Bamboozle is a Perk which allows the Killer to vault a little faster *and* block the window at the same time. Fire Up is a Perk which causes the Killer to move faster and perform certain actions faster; vaulting windows being one of them.
---
These things put together make an absolutely terrifying build, as The Shape can vault windows almost as quickly as Survivors can *while running*. If you want to see it in action, [observe here](https://youtu.be/CpWFPJV0jO0). The build is usually referred to as "Vault Master Myers".
---
Spirit fury, enduring, nurses, ruin or sloppy 
---
They are also banning the people exploiting that glitch to get unlimited items but thats harder to detetc
---
My goodness, why so much anger for Ochido? Has he hurt you personally? We have so many folks to actually be mad at but a boy playing a video game gets you this angry instead? I can see where your priorities are at kid.
---
The EULA also states terms of use, which in this case were violated. Not saying it would be impossible for a court to hear it, but it would never go anywhere. And they put ‚Äúall that crap‚Äù in there to protect themselves legally, not confuse or deceive people.
---
Also, as far as I know there was never a steam court case, they changed their policy to adapt to consumer protection regulations.

She‚Äôs 110% speed so she‚Äôs catch up just slowly especially if your movement isn‚Äôt optimal 
---
Remember Me is based of NoES remake around 2010, where Freddy uses the line as a means to remind Nancy of her past abuse by Freddy.
---
It makes sense for the gate duration increasing perk to be called Remember Me, the obsessions past abuse is used to scorn the current time.
---
It just works
---
TFW you realize this perk was made with that predator meme in mind
---
Legion should be one tier higher because of potential 3-way possibilities with Frank and Joey. 
---
Because they know it's true
---
Maybe, but don‚Äôt the Devs have a moral imperative to remove someone who‚Äôs ruining others enjoyment of their game?
---
Well I do have to admit a certain amount of stupidity because I'm not big into nightmare on elm Street so I guess there was a whole lot I don't remember or miss...  I didn't remember him, I'm getting out in 16 seconds!!!

Wow that's awesome. Thank you for the info!

I could‚Äôve. But out of the 100 I don‚Äôt message, there‚Äôs always one. 
---
They should make it so that you can see all survivors while opening gates.
---
* ***BAMBOOZLE***
---
* Pallet pop perks in general
---
* Sources of Exposed are great, Make Your Choice is my personal favorite but NOED can work as well if you want an endgame build
---
* Hex: Devour Hope works great with MYC because they unhook a guy, you down him super fast and that's another token waiting to happen. Not to mention it's another source of Exposed. This works quite well with Windstorm addons so you have even better map control (which you should be bringing every Wraith game IMO, even if it's just the uncommon one, unless you're doing the coxcombed/ghost combo)
---
* Haunted Ground is a nice side dish with your Hex Devour Hope but if you're running those two and MYC it might be "putting your eggs in one basket". I haven't unlocked Haunted Ground on wraith  yet myself, so it's just something to consider
---
* Nurse's Calling is always awesome on any tiny terror radiused killer and Wraith is no exception
---
* Gen-breaking perks like Overcharge are nice picks for stopping the gen rush. I probably wouldn't run Ruin as Wraith is not especially good with a hex-heavy build and it's too rng dependent by itself. 
---
And of course three perks that basically everyone can benefit from in some way: BBQ, Sloppy, and Whispers
---
She's on the generator. I noticed her instantly 
---
From what I've found out, he was the king of Toxic on DBD, he's been banned multiple times on PC for cheating, hacking and griefing, then moved to PS4 to avoid the bans. Got found out and banned, the community is happy simply because they will now never encounter him.
---
True its average, he just plays against really shit survivors, with op addons and tunnels the living fuck of the first one hooked...
---
Wait you can get custom ones? Can you get custom perk icons?
---
I was trying to get the Adept Freddy achievement a few weeks ago. I had downed my obsession and immediately, two awake people run up and start healing her. What could I do about that? Absolutely nothing. 
---
We're not your personal army dipshit
---
This is me when playing a new killer.
---
Freddy has a good stall and map pressue, but he can lose it quickly and is very vurnerable to open gates, thats why he is considered underwhelming (In my opinion he is bad but not the worst. Still love playing as him) 
---
Also yes you can be stunned by awake survivors
---
What do mean this is a serious suggestion 
---
Ah ok, that‚Äôs kinda crazy
---
Running NOED because you don't even have the option of running Ruin since you don't have it unlocked ‚úì
---
It's a nice backup plan anyways. I don't have any other perks that a) prevent me from getting gen rushed or b) offer me any substantial value. Most of the perks seem like garbage so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Good answer. Ty 
---
Yeah but most of the time the survivors will lose a pip so how is that fair? Idc if the killer kills me at the end as long as I get a chance to do enough to not lose a pip from no fault of my own. 
---
OchiPEDO
---
From that short sentence you have filled me with unholy amounts of rage and anger 
---
Nah, there were screenshots floating around for awhile of him trying to flirt and shit with underage girls that he knew were underage.
---
... Because you onow it's true.
---
Freddy is only underwhelming when played incorrectly, and by no means is he OP.
---
He has a lot of map pressure if constantly tagging players with his power, and as long as he whittles pallets away he can really pressure the game into a long drawn out nightmare.
---
He isn't OP however, you can't stealth him easily once in the dream unless you want to risk a locker, and he can easily tag players as they don't know where he is to hide from him
---
But he can be looped and is especially vulnerable to quick actions such as quick heals, saves and finishing totems/gens
---
My personal one, which seems to get more and more effective the longer a game goes on:
---
NOED, Unrelenting, Whispers, and Shadowborn
---
I heard he was ban for being toxic i personally don't care if he gets banned or not for being toxic. People get really sensitive like i grew up playing MW,Bo1 and Bo2 and toxic was part of the game im sure if you're playing a M rated game you shouldn't cry about being toxic.
---
Right? Half the time I just ignore them and they waste the whole match chasing me around while I kill their allies then get mad when I hook em and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúok but did you do anything?‚Äù
---
Frank's mixtape is not for me. I just love hitting survivors and hearing their scream. Why miss out on one more scream when you can hit them more?
---
&gt;:/
---
Onow I mispellet a thang
---
Thanks and welcome. I really do hope that they figure something out with the legion's ability or at least finish the Freddy rework by the next two patches. Because it stinks having poor concept killers like them in the game at the same time.
---
I tried to make an angry face. Now I'm sad.
---
I lied I spelled things perfect
---
I feel personally attacked
---
no shit you dumb bitch ass
---
There is no fucking joke and the hit boxes are shitty ping
---
Dude you completely came off as a know-it-all prick. Plus, why would I make another account to hate on you when i'm just uploading something I found funny.
---
This right here perfectly answers the question, op. Altruistic survivors can nullify Freddy‚Äôs powers.
---
He is talking about the release trailer meg
---
Good.
---
At 56 ping you van get hit from way farther hen you should, and just because you are too dense to get the joke doesnt mean its tot here.
---
So ignore the person right in front of you, hook your survivor, then go tunnel the claudette, giving everyone else still around the hook a free unhook and heal?
---
The irony here is that what you're describing isn't scrub behavior, complaining about a tactic because it's "cheap" or "boring" is the calling card of a scrub. I really encourage you to give this a read, it's a good article and changed the way that I personally look at competitive games: [http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub](http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub)
---
Being camped or tunneled sucks, I don't disagree with you there and I've been on the receiving end of it too. But it's a bit silly to expect your opponent to employ less than optimal strategies or not use a really good perk when it's available to them.
---
There is no joke and what the fuck is ‚Äúvan‚Äù
---
watch out before he calls you a pedophile like he does when people call him out for re-posting ! Ironic that this guy is telling other people they need a ban

Um, what?

I get a hit of dopamine every time I land a lethal blink. I'm not even that good at the Nurse since I'm still so new, but damn is fun. An accurate read  is equally a great feeling, especially because it almost always means that the blink is lethal.
---
thats fucked up
---
I don‚Äôt care if you are a guy or a girl, why isn‚Äôt Huntress on S+++?
---
Because they have to give a specific reason for the ban.
---
Everything else listed is also a bannable reason, however.
---
Tell that to people like Tru3 and his minions that complain about gen repair speed being too fast. If camping is valid and the counter is do gens, why should gens EVER be slowed down. That‚Äôs the side of the argument these people are too blind to see. 
---
Not meaning to target you, just speaking to a general annoyance I have. 
---
Amazing how quickly they were able to put this out when console players have been begging for a YEAR AND A HALF for a decent framerate. But nope, it's only worth rushing fixes that make the insane grind go by a little faster. Otherwise, "Hurr, durr... we never said Decemeber 2018. It's gonna be a PASS, not a PATCH!" 
---
Done with this game. I've tried to be patient, but I just can't anymore. If they can rush this console ban thing out at the first sign of an exploit, then they'd better have a DAMN GOOD excuse as to why console gameplay is still absolute trash and getting worse over time. 
---
I hate this, from both sides. Killers that complain about DS and survivors who complain about NOED. 
---
DS isn‚Äôt even that good anyways, the ONLY way it can even be considered a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù perk is if the user holds onto it until the very end of the game in the off chance they get caught but the exit gates are open. That is extremely situational though, it‚Äôs exactly how I play if I do use it though. Either that or save it for my death hook. 
---
I ain‚Äôt taking a shot at you OP just voicing my opinion. Especially when it comes to a one off perk that unless you‚Äôre running an obsession perk, you know they have it. Take the DS, chase them back down and hook them, give them a nod once you have Hahahaha

Watching him play is really calming too, he‚Äôs just really positive about everything.

It's a valid strategy to punish overalturistic team, must are greedy for points and pips, who isn't? So of course staying there is necessary if more than one survivor is around.

And from my experience I can tell you, yes most not the killer is toxic because he stays there, your mates are for giving him a reason to stay there.
---
If nobody is around the killer might be new or you are the needed sarafice, when you die and 5 Gens are done and the other escape, the killer will understand that this brings NOTHING!

DO GENS!

Ruin is the gift of practicing great skill checks.  Do the gens and get better at them.  I swear to God those ruin skill checks are slightly slower, too, but I can't find any evidence.
---
They're referring to Sujan; the central character from the [release trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGhIXLO3ul8).
---
Sujan was never released (obviously), but her athletic background and early designs would be incorporated into the character of Meg Thomas.
---
The devs have stated as much during one of the dev streams.
---
And what point is that? It‚Äôs not fun or rewarding to play against a killer who camps people to death. You really think I don‚Äôt know how to punish campers? I‚Äôve done that enough times to be sick and tired of it. 
---
Ochido united us... In a mysterious way... 
---
you had a mental breakdown and called them a pedophile because someone said hun then told you to stay in school because you were acting like an idiot. Pathetic mental gymnastics for labeling someone as a child fucker... or are you just projecting your inner guilt over being a pedophile yourself? see how easy that is "hun"

Rage quitting is rage quitting. I get camped and tunneled sometimes when I'm doing survivor dailies. You know what I don't do? Disconnect. People who disconnect instead of losing are a big problem with this community.

The perks wouldn't really work since they would be teachable, revealing survivor ahead whenever you use a power would literally make Nurse, Billy, Wraith, leatherface, doctor and hag a nightmare to play against.

What‚Äôs up with people forever saying that facecamping isn‚Äôt a flawed tactic? Are you kidding? Sure, go ahead and bash me for saying it, but it‚Äôs so ridiculous. Who wants to start a game like that? When you see it happen so often, you don‚Äôt want to deal with that bs!

Dead by Daylight uses Easy Anti-Cheat, with which the game picks up on disconnecting and will ban people who do it too frequently.

The toxic behavior Ochido promotes probably alienates a lot more players than it attracts.

I mean, with just Enduring and Bamboozle he can shut down most loops by just following the Survivor while invisible. Even experienced Survivors will probably have to take a hit to use a loop, and inexperienced Survivors will just waste pallets or get caught out and go down.

I wouldn't say he's OP, but depending on the add-ons he's far from a joke and can be incredibly dangerous.

Is it a "known issue" as in the devs are aware and are currently working on fixing it, or is it a "known issue" as in the community knows about it but the devs don't know/don't care and it will probably never be fixed?

Unfortunately, the way mapping buttons works on console means that all 'actions' are always mapped to the same button. 
---
So while, you can change the basic action button from R1 to square or triangle or whatever, it will still be the same button for all actions, meaning this can still occur.
---
Honestly, it's the reason I refuse to run Self-Care. I've been smacked at a pallet too many times because the game decided that what I really want to do at a pallet while in chase is start healing.

Huh that‚Äôs interesting 
---
I've been here since launch and I can count on one hand the amount of times I've felt like decisive strike legitimately fucked me over. It's hardly a crutch perk as it's a once per game thing.

---
It will most likely be addressed at some point in the future but who knows when that will be
---
Rank literally has nothing to do with the queue times. It takes the group average and matches you with a suitable killer at that rank average when there are varying ranks. 
---
For example.
---
Rank
---
2
---
5
---
9
---
3
---
Add all the ranks and then divide by 4. 
---
2 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 19 √∑ 4 = 4.75
---
The average ranked killer the game will look for is a 4 +/- 3 ranks above or below rank 4 to fill the gap.
---
The queue times are long because the match making system is fucked. Not because the ranks are different.
---
Add in the fact that there are lobby dodging noobs that fuck the match making system up even more because they're bad at the game and refuse to play against swf and get any real skill. Anyone can smash a bunch of solo queue players in a matter of minutes. They want easy games and no challenge of ever getting better at the game. These people are known as boosted baby killers and it's obvious when going against one.
---
*tears up*
---
why all ppl from reddit are toxic af wtff ....i dont even like ochido 
---
Very nice !
---
What the fuck do you mean doesn't mean they're allowed to? Read any TOS, somewhere in there it will state they can ban you for any reason.
---
It's their game. You are just purchasing a license to play it. Enough with this misconception that because you paid for the game you have some god given right to play it until the end of time. You don't.
---
Having 3 people asleep is arguably better than having 1 hook and none asleep.  Sure, optimal survivors will sprint immediately to a gen and start trying to wake up, but often people aren't sure if you're following them or not and try to hang out near safe areas of the map, wasting a ton of time.  Anyone who is asleep has 50% action speed, meaning even if they go to a gen then they're still not really accomplishing much.  It can be very easy once multiple people are slept to juggle them around and make sure no gens get much progress, fishing for someone to be in a poor position to allow for a fast down/hook.  
---
It is kind of like a house of cards though, it's very possible RNG goes horribly wrong and it all his pressure vanishes and there is not really much within Freddy's control to combat that.
---
Out of curiosity, what is the pointnof deranking? I've always seen it as being in the same camp as smurfing, which I find to be a generally shitty thing to do. 
---
They lose a pip ?
---
There is
---
100% agree, too many salty killers 
---
But then how will I know when a Dwight or Jake is in my game so I can bring leatherface to try and steal their faces
---
They lose 2 pips
---
The salt - Doc
---
It could also be argued that it is unfun and unfair for the killer that he must slug and search for an immersed Claudette so he can get the 4 kills in a match where maybe 2 gens got done. 
---
While slugging is mainly used to find the 4th person in a match, it has many tactical advantages at other points in the game too, (it was much more effective and hence intended to be used more than it is back when dropping a survivor did not fill the wiggle bar, hence the losing screen tip that is still in the game and says that at times dropping a survivor is the best option. Since the wiggle bar drop change, it‚Äôs only the right call maybe 1/100 times.) and giving the option to bleed out or faster is likely to be abused by survivors across a number of various scenarios.
---
Slugging already got a nerf anyways with the max recover being moved from 85% to 95%, so it really doesn‚Äôt need another. The only viable situation I could see where it‚Äôd maybe be okay is if everyone in the match is slugged and the killer refuses to pick anyone up as you described, but even then for every case where that happens there will also be a case where the killer properly slugs a team so secure a win and goes to hook people but everyone suicides on the ground to deny points or intentionally speeds up their bleedout time in hope that the killer will not find them in enough time or reach them if he must hook multiple people across the map. And if you could do it whenever you want then people would just suicide on first down out of rage or to deny a BBQ stack instead off DCing, and toxic randoms screwing over their teammates would suddenly become much more of a problem.
---
It would be more damaging to the game then helpful, and just like dribbling or bodyblocking it would be used for what was clearly not the intended purpose and open up new avenues for people to be dicks to each other.
---
If the game crashes and a dialog box shows up to report a bug, you dont lose rank or depip/
---
It's just so strange, because like, I just want folks to have a good time for the most part. (Sorry flashlighters, you always try to be butts. &gt;:() 
---
I just wish people were more positive in post game chat. Sometimes I get really really sweet people, and then other times oh gosh... 
---
That's cool. I wasn't trying to imply that you were a shitty person or anything, that's just generally my first thought when I hear the term "derank". Good Killers (or survivors) who just want easy stomp games against weaker players because they get off on the power trip. I wouldn't do it, but I don't have as much of a problem with people who just prefer the more laid back atmosphere of ranks like 10-5 to the more serious, hardcore, stressful environment of 4+ ranks.
---
wat I don?
---
I usually get salty over a 4 man SWF, or horrendous map generation, like having 3 infinite loops right next to eachother like my last 3 games.
---
Not on console. They only care if you're cheating their grind/BP system. 
---
Hahaha! That is pretty accurate 
---
Yeah same, my knowledge pretty much ends at True and Monto.
---
Why I can hear this picture. The humming is so loud.
---
Not necessarily true now that the banning system is here the system picks up on your dcs
---
Sex in airplane: Distressing
---
I can confirm you can actually do it on the same survivor multiple times in a match even as of 2.5.0. Best way I would recommend going for the achievement is to use franks mixtape (F in the chat) and frenzy a guy twice that you know is just gonna make a save no matter what. Once you hit him the second time and get stunned, it may take a second to recover to like 1/4 by then go frenzy the guy that just got unhooked and then down the unhooker with your killer instinct active.
---
Amazing, truly truly beautiful.

No? Why would they change that? The only reason people dodge lobbies are because of dickhead p3 Claudettes and SWF if they got rid of that then you wouldn‚Äôt know what to look out for you could go against a team of 4 p3s and never know 
---
yeah... just ignore the toxic people. I dont wanna win m9 i just wanna have fun so if im skilled why waste precious time to insult me?
---
Right?
---
If people took time to read things, most of the world's current problems would be solves pretty quickly.  
---
  
---
Sadly reality isn't like that.
---
Here's a lesson in life that no one will ever be honest with you about.
---
You are not special. You are not unique and you are not original.
---
Any idea you've thought of has already been had. Any question you will have has already been thought of as well as answered. Nothing is new, nothing is original and nothing is special. Anything you've done has already been done and is not new. We are all copies of the same product. 
---
Some people are just butts and hate it when people are having fun I guess! 
---
God I want to know what happened immediately after.
---
Calm spirit is actually pretty good now in higher ranks since more people are using spies from the shadows after the buff 
---
Well deserved, pizza face. 
---
People blame survivors who crouch somewhere and only start working on a generator after someone else is hit. But I can understand people who do that. Playing as solo survivor, if you get caught first this often happens. Team mates often saunter around in the grass eating bugs or whatever else they're doing, until you're at second stage hook.
---
I don't see why. I find the videos entertaining. Huge view counts. If not for him a lot of people might not have even played.
---
Old enough
---
You talk the talk, but can you bing the bong?
---
It's been cited so many times before, you can find it if you want but asking everyone to cite it after it's been done so many times is kind of overkill.
---
Yeah. It was unfortunate but we worked a lot to get it all back up again!
---
Yes officer this comment
---
And this one too
---
Looping requires skill
---
I still see rank 1 posts, and people still compliment 'good job' and congrats. I'm not saying it doesn't annoy some people, but others feel great congratulating each other for something happening the first time for them that was an accomplishment their first time as well.
---
I'm not going to lie, SOMETIMES I will play super serious because I'm just in the mood for it, and lord the map generation can be potato sometimes. 
---
I think the only time I get salty is when I'm just trying to get like, my FIRST hook, and someone, or two people come outta' nowhere and try to flashlight me/body block me. 
---
It's just like... "Shouldn't you be working on gens? We're like 1 minute into the game...??"
---
Those are usually the lobbies that lose though because they're not doing gens effectively. I have nearly 1k hours in this game now, I just ain't got time for salt, which is why I play the way I do now, lol.
---
Honestly my best advice, that I started giving myself when I played for kills more often was: "It's just a game, as long as you get x# of survivors, you're not bad." Because I used to get A LOT more salty at Dead by Daylight. 
---
Disconnecting to derank is scummy, because it ruins the chances of your team mates.
---
If you want to derank so badly, drop a pallet and vault over it continuously until the killer finds you. Get hooked, and suicide on the hook. This is also a douche move, but at least it wastes a small part of the killer's time.
---
Can you explain point 1 in detail by what you mean with devotion level?
---
I wholeheartedly agree
---
He abused and published exploits, edited his savegame to get Killers and such to P3, probably cheated Legacy. 
---
Then there's multiple Witchhunts on Twitch. 
---
He ended up getting HardwareID banned on PC. 
---
After that he switched to PS4 so we can add ban evasion to the list.
---
I watched one video of his when a friend linked it. God, there needs to be a warning for ear rape.
---
But that's no fun for anyone! I want to spread positivity, not make others frustrated, or upset. D:
---
that's really good, did the cameraman die

Wait is a feast for the entity 400 sacrifices on pc? It's 1000 on xbox
---
Im not an Ochido fan but its kinda scary how different players have different rules. Some streamers the dev's enable there shitty behavior, like the streamer Jen who admitted NotQueen and other staff members told her when she and her friends were close to the D/C limit and Ochido getting banned for something he did on PC(Which is says in the rules shouldn't happen). 
---
I love these devs but this is disturbing honestly.
---
Accidentally found a way out of the basement when you're experiencing the bug (only works when gates are open though) 
---
BASICALLY you spam the locker and the game somehow flies you up? It doesn't show on your own screen, but eventually you'll get out of the basement (watch your basement time points) and run out the door. 
---
For others this looks really silly though. 
---
You're probably the type of survivor who gets caught scrounging around in the basement and hooked down there. Just an annoyance that you're putting on the rest of your team having to go down there, risking all to save your ass.
---
The reason they should be slowed is because at a competitive level they really do get done too fast. Unless you are playing a killer like nurse, billy, spirit, or huntress, you can not down an equally skilled survivor in enough time to prevent gens from popping left and right. It‚Äôs the reason why you see so many of those killers at the high ranks. Quickly downing a survivor in enough time to combat the gen completion is a task that is mounds more difficult than the actual task of doing a gen while the killer is doing literally anything else. 
---
You do see teammates that allow themselves to be pressured really easily but you also see teammates that chew through gens while you run the killer through a god loop on torment creek or wretched shop, with the killer being unable to actually do anything except drop chase or bloodlust/entity block you and then camp to secure one kill since the game is pretty much a gg for them, especially since those loops can be reused at any point. It would make the game harder for survivors at a casual level but would likely also give killers the freedom to mix it up a bit at the high ranks as opposed to playing nurse 17 games in a row.
---
No it happens just before they snap into the animation. Maybe a half second before. Enough that you can definitely tell that they got hit before they started the vault animation, but still didn't have enough time for the effect to wear off.
---
Hag's style directly opposes Ruin IMO, because you will lose 2-3 gens before you've made your web but then you just end the game very fast.
---

I would love to live in a world where people are supportive enough to celebrate a stranger's achievements. Imagine getting a new job, walking onto the street and yelling, I just got hired! And everyone that hears applauds because we actually LIKE humans.
---
That's why I tell random strangers on the internet congrats, because I want that kind of world.
---
yeah he gone 
---
lol  
---
BHVR: We no longer want you to play our game. \*bans\*  
---
Ochido: aww k.
---
\*Ochido goes into game from another door\*  
---
BHVR: You again?!! what part of what we said did you not understand??!!  
---
Ochido: Fuck i'm being kicked out AGAIN?! \*pissed\*  
---
Just a bad killer all you can do sadly is just rush gens 
---
On the third day, he rose again.
---
O shit. Did I find you on Reddit?
---
That's not bannable. It would be if it was the other way around, where you were in the basement but couldn't get out because she was just standing there.
---
There has to be a balance somewhere. On PS4, everyone joins at the same time regardless. I‚Äôm just playing by myself and the killer dodged the lobby about 25% of the time. However, with Franklin‚Äôs as a killer perk, you kinda need to know if you should equip it or not. Maybe only show the items being brought in? Idk. I just know when playing by myself, if two or more of us happen to equip a toolbox, it‚Äôs about a 75% chance of a disconnect from the killer. They assume SWF with toolboxes. 
---
You seem to have not known these things which is why your stupid post exists in the first place.
---
What he‚Äôs doing is allowed so it‚Äôs not bannable. 
---
Sauce?
---
Quentin‚Äôs just a meth-head
---
That‚Äôs the worst. When you get your offering consumed and the killer DCs immediately. 
---
BBQ, Beast of Prey, Distressing, Thrills of the Hunt.
---
That's how I play, just farming bloodpoints, addonless.
---
Keep doing that, until you know Wraith by heart, then equip what you want.
---
1‚Ä¢ You put your Instagram link in the title of the post.
---
2‚Ä¢ You put in ‚ÄúPoor Ochiido‚Äù which is seen as being empathic to him. 
---
 3‚Ä¢ This meme is outdated.
---
It can be interpreted either way honestly. Unless the devs have commented on it. 
---
Why comment then? People have already made douchey comments telling people to just search for things instead of making new posts, you're so unoriginal
---
I also think so. 
---
I‚Äôve also seen shirtless, baseball cap, and camo bottoms with the username John cena
---
Same reason teabagging and flashlight clicking isn't reportable. Cry some more.
---
This is so sad!
---
Can we get Legion porn?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
I dislike this so much, thank you very much.
---
Right? I love watching him
---
This isn't in defense of him or his fans, but even the worst people in history have good that people see in them. It's likely his defenders enjoy him like someone enjoys anyone else, they just like who he is or his sense of humor, and sees his flaws as minor.
---
To be fair "yeah he was an utterly toxic shitbadger, but I personally thought he was a *funny* utterly toxic shitbadger" isn't really a defense
---
I screamed for a little while. He later killed me because he had Rancor. I can upload the fest tk Youtube or so
---
The devs said so about the borrowed time. So the hook I‚Äôd say would prob be the same. It‚Äôs shitty but eh
---
Sex with me: Small Game
---
lmfao nice

I found a strange way to fight this; https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aka6oq/basement_be_gone_how_to_get_yourself_unstuck/?
---
She's got a dick: bamboozle. FTFY
---
Clown should be S ++++++ due to him being an a b s o l u t e u n i t
---
But what about the perk Playing with your food which rewards the killer for letting their obsession escape from chases. If the killer does this enough times could it be seen as ‚Äòboosting‚Äô?
---
It can‚Äôt be considered holding the game hostage because the game is ending the person on the hook is slowly dying that‚Äôs why camping is not against the rules 
---
What's his power? (Also those quotes are hilarious)
---
Sex with a fifi: tinkerer.
---
Exactly. If I‚Äôm about to struggle then save me. Give me a chance and at least makes the killer put me back on the hook. Plus gets you unhook points. It‚Äôs a win win. 
---
I mean let's be real, this is something they were probably working on but had a low priority (which it shouldn't have been sure).  
---
Once the exploit came to light it probably became the #1 priority to finish.
---
*remembers the amount of Davids with Urban Immersion* 
---
sure.... literally Frank. 
---
I can bing the bong and heng the feng
---
You‚Äôre referring to blocking their entrance. I‚Äôm referring to blocking their exit. Yes I agree blocking others from saving the hooked survivor in the basement isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage. It‚Äôs camping. But if you just stand at the top of the stairs for awhile and don‚Äôt let them out, I‚Äôd consider that bannable. 
---
Oh, no. Or at least only tangentially.
---
This was 100% about me being mad at this particular guy, if I'm being honest, lol
---
If it gets people to realize "hey, they probably aren't cheating, DBD is just kind of a clusterfuck" then that's a welcome bonus, but this was totally just me finding a way to vent that didn't involve screaming at another adult about a video game over my personal/professional Twitter account like a fucking lunatic
---
I have never been saltier about anything in my entire life. I can only plead a combination of exhaustion, work stress, and the fact that this guy is genuinely a douche
---
Not at all? Why would you assume that? I'm being completely genuine. 
---
thank you so much you are a god &lt;3 
---
A bit late, but I think you win the planking challenge 
---
They don't care, though: that's WHY they DC, because they want to derank
---
too old

---
And what‚Äôs the problem with that? 
---
I'm not sure why you think I care I am perma-banned from his channel. I haven't watched him in over a year.
---
no one argues with that. but if you block the stairs to wait up the BT that's also not banable and not holding the game hostage since there is a progression that you're waiting for.
---
[The clip of him getting the ban](https://youtu.be/8aS5V05cO58) 
---
Ninja memes in 2019 YIKES
---
Yes that is bannable as that‚Äôs taking the game hostage. Unless you are waiting for borrowed to run out. But that is not what the killer in the image is doing. He‚Äôs keeping them from going down there for a save 
---
Yeah he used to exploit glitches which led him to getting banned on PC. He also organized a witchhunt with his twitch followers to get someone banned. That coupled with many girls revealing that he has made perverted moves on them. Also he is known for playing 4 man SWF and calling the killer bad and teabagging even though the killer is clearly at a disadvantage.
---
Yeah, but I mean more than just losing 2 out of 5 points of a rank. You can gain those back in 10 minutes while your initial DC can cause all of the other survivors in the match to depip because they don't stand a chance
---
Nurse should have like 105 move speed
---
My career is over because i don't want to play on PC? You know, that platform that lets you do streaming extremely easy. Either way im very happy about this
---
HAH! 
---
It happened to me twice yesterday, so frustrating when your looking for 2 survivors for the game to just end.
---
I know what I'm talking about. :)
---
Ugh, this circle jerk needs to stop. They DC because the game has so much BS to offer. It's not as common as you guys make it look like.
---
This is like the 10th post in a day i've seen...
---
To be fair, OP never specifies their gender
---
Pathetic excuse of a human being, absolut digusting manchild.
---
And then you have to do it twice as many times as if you DC... lol nice idea "Don't ruin X games doing that, ruin 2X games doing this".
---
You might have replied to the wrong person
---
Only clueless when i comes to design and balance, but otherwise a pretty ~~good job~~  nice guy, so far
---
As much of a piece of shit that he is, he has over 500k subs and get's around 200k views a video he releases. As hard as it is to admit, he is one of the biggest content creators for DBD.
---
That jsut proves how stupid his entire derange fanbase is, but i am not surprised he formed them like himself, deranged in all possible ways ! 
---
Still that dosent mean he's not a top content creator.
---
He was perma banned twice on PC already.
---
Nah, he's fine, unless gets his 3rd ban. 
---
Yeah, solution to high queue times, make another queue so we split the player base. Great idea.
---
If they are OUTSIDE of your terror radius, they can hear the phasing sound as soon as you're in 24m range of them. So basically the size of your terror radius. 
---
&gt;Sue for what lol? It‚Äôs no different from getting banned from a store
---
Exactly, if you write your name under something or agree with terms and get punished for not following these terms, you get punished, this is how ~~mafia~~ LAW works. 
---
His entire fanbase is so toxic and caused so much dmg to the reputation of the community, he can be happy that he only got banned. People get freaking sued for the shit he has done. 
---
Tier 1 monitor Myers is the most terrifying thing in the entire game.
---
They can hide survivors if they disable swf. That seems fair, right?
---
OMG you are right, guess its true that enemies become allies when there is a bigger scum around XD
---
&gt;Not a huge fan of his but doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense to permanently ban one of their top content producers
---

Nurse being a mindflayer would make her the undisputed queen of all things, "fuck this."
---
Thank god hes banned.Hes responsible for a lot of toxicity and the toxic community of the game,he deserved it.Not to mention his "other things"
---
yep
---
7 seconds to start up his (speedlimiter) chainsaw for each survivor before being able to rev it would be a more fitting comparison but I fully agree. Freddy sucks.
---
wow, didn't know about that last part. can you imagine being so much of a fuckin weirdo that you try to get a girl to break up and go out with you because she streams the same game as you

Yes in full costume XD

---
No? I swap out offerings and perks based on the items and my perception of the experience of the survivors. This is an intended advantage for killers. 
---
Maybe treat the cause instead of the symptom instead.

Yea the skull is kinda reminiscent of Frank castles, but he is a little on the skinny side

‚ÄúOne of the top content producers‚Äù am I wrong?

Whats wrong with dwight your bullying him '='
---
It's not, it's just a meme template in general.
---
Everything you said relates to survivors being evil bags.
---
Goblins are my favourite race in D&amp;D... and Dwight is my favourite survivor lmao
---
he doesnt even do anything he just stands there blushing through his mask 
---
teaming is when you play normally but let your friend who is in your game go and farm with him
---
And then Adrenaline pops
---
Okay, so it doesn't help one of the randoms I was with killed herself after the first hook.  Was it the wait or was it because we were against Legion?  Even so, giving up after 1 hook is a bit...overkill.
---
But yeah, the rest of us pretty much couldn't do anything but mend and pulling people off the hook.  When I was the last survivor alive, I realised there's not enough gens done to make the hatch show up.
---
So for the third time, maybe third time‚Äòs the charm: I know (and agreed) that character‚Äòs speech can often break conventions without being a mistake. 
---
However, you guys are absolutely ignoring what I‚Äòm telling you once again now: The error is very common and you can see it in environments which are not an exception to the conventions time and time again. 
---
Quite a bit late, yeah. But you are exactly right about what the app is. Just a dbd ripoff

BHVR does have a hand in the content they release.

I think it should simple hide the names.

That‚Äòs fine and also good to know. I think I saw op giving rightful credit in another post amongst the comments, too. 
---
I mean, wraith's non-existent ass is a bit too far high, but I agree with the rest of it
---
And the map needs to be the meat plant.
---
The glass looks like the least of her pain problems though.
---
What are these comments, lmao 
---
No abilities or add-ons? Then that'd be the exact same base killer every time, with the only difference being which perks the player chose to run. 
---
Wraith looks like The Lich when he possessed Billy in Adventure Time
---
Ah kk then, my bad.
---
It's not the same thing, and it's not bannable.

---
Sounds like Legion
---
Pretty bad imitation if you have seen them though. 
---
They counter this by giving you time to get to a somewhat safe location, though unless you have the timing down on the transition chances are you are going to take a hit to start but after that he is a basic killer. Once you are outside the terror radius you do become visible to Freddy for as long as you sleep. 
---
If you're in dream world, he can see your aura if you're out of his terror radius
---
Cannibal Sex: **Play With Your Food**
---
You're literally making an unhook *impossible*. There's a difference between face camping now and face camping with single direction unhooks.
---
Body blocking single direction hooks is the same thing as body blocking the stairs to completely prevent an unhook. Body blocking the stairs *in general* isn't bannable, but this player is directly making it so an unhook isn't even attemptable. That's why old facecamping was bannable.
---
Do you agree with that C tier
---
What do you think his name means... Hex: 3 man ?
---
Could it mean he's DC'ing and leaving the game as a 3 man? 
---
Because he‚Äòs already the worst, stop trying to beat the poor guy :( 
---
I'm gonna pretend you said "pre-blowjob handjob to get hard" instead, cause that's nasty... but also impressive.
---
Are we talking huge dick, very flexible or a bit of both?
---
This gave me cancer. 
---
Exactly why it would be unfun.
---
"killer is hard to play". Camps + mori = 4k unless you miss half of your hits. 200iq plays right here boys
---
Look out for the jigsaw boxes highlighted in white. Usually there is 4 of em and one (randomly chosen) removes it if you stick your hands in it and do a few skill checks. Generally speaking if your trap is already active and the timer is going you don't wanna heal but immediately go for the boxes. 
---
Anyone else feel like hag needs a bit of love? I feel she hasn't gotten that many skins compared to others recently.

If exit gates are open don‚Äôt bother taking it off and just run out  : )
---
His power is literally to have to wait 7 seconds to hit you the first time instead of just hitting you immediately, and that's assuming you do nothing to get somewhere safe during those 7 seconds. The song acts like a warning beforehand and that's all you need since if you could see the red stain you can see them blink in and out as you start to fall asleep, unless they are running pill bottle.

Yeah or use basic tech skills and don't be like Ochido and ban evasion is more simple than it looks.
---
I mean he could just set a program up over his normal screen that blurs names out , not particularly difficult. Don't get me wrong I don't enjoy his content or who he allegedly is as a person but game bans seem kinda moot to me. I remember when you could buy a game and the ENTIRE game was yours to use how you see fit. Now almost everything is always online doomed to die the moment the servers decide to shut down. Also kinda moot because evading a ban is stupid easy assuming you even have a monocle of common sense to do a quick google search... Something tells me this wont be the last we see of him.
---
BHVR removed/nerfed most of the overtoxic things in the game. This guy doesn't play DbD to survive, or any objective. His sole objective is to tilt the killer. That has no place here for BHVR it seems, and i‚Äôm ok with that tbh.
---
You don‚Äôt see the problem of not being prepared to go up against people?
---
That's on the developers then. Can't ban him for playing the game. All the other critiques on him are legitimate though.
---
SWF get so insanely salty and toxic in the post-game when you kill any of them. I ordered a hazmat suit off Amazon just to protect myself from the community.
---
You dick xD 
---
Pretty sure they didnt just banned him for that. But i‚Äôm not from BHVR so I cant tell you their reasons :D. Anyway, if they decided to, they certainly had a reason to.
---
Why is there all the hate for Ochido ? I like his videos , he is very good at Loooping the baby killers Dud XD
---
He was hardware banned on pc and banned on ps4. It can't play with other accounts
---
Just slower than previously.
---
Before the patch, 2 people on a single generator would repair it twice as fast as a single person (80 seconds for one person, 40 for two). Now, two people repair a generator 1.8 times as fast as a single person, taking roughly 44.4 seconds.
---
This ‚Äòefficiency penalty‚Äô was always supposed to exist, but had been bugged for a little while until this latest patch. They added the red bar to show that you personally are repairing at less than 100% speed.
---
Facecamping with single directional hooks is like waiting out an RBT or BT but that was bannable. How is this any different?
---
It 100 percent won‚Äôt be the last and all these threads really do is make him more known 
---
Swapped to ps4 after perma pc ban. Sony handles the ban different. 
---
It needs various reports throughout different games to get someone banned though.
---
One game alone won‚Äòt do and it‚Äòs good that way (reasonable doubt) 
---
He got banned for violating the rules, not playing toxic 
---
oh ok XD but usually when i do generator it goes red, and then i die, so if i do the last generater and run out then i will livev?
---
oh i thought u have to stay away from the box because the pig head can see u when u go near them (every time i go to them she comes to me and kills me !!)
---
Something I found is when you already removed a trap at a box it has a low chance to go there again so try a different box 
---
Once for hacking legacy and once for hacking purple flashlights.
---
Yes and extra bloodpoints for escaping with trap on head!
---
Killers are supposed to have the advantage of being able to prepare. So no, this feature will never go, especially since SWFs could abuse this more than heavily. 
---
oh ok what is a box?
---
omg awesome, do u get an achievemt for it? i might play all day to try and get it

I am not new, but a killer should not be messaging a survivor during a match. And if you agree, I bet you're one of those players that do exactly that. 
---
He lied to you. Don‚Äôt get out of the exit with RBT on.
---
i was whoring myself out for bloodpoints yesterday while playing doc, and this happened to me many times. i originally thought it was just bad timing, but even when i got perfect timing they would still get the vault 
---
wat
---
When I use Tinkerer the gen gets popped straight away, even with Billy I usually can't get there fast enough :\  Is it meant for tracking rather than stopping survs completing?
---
Okay sorry me too
---
Well looking at your post history you could probably use some of your own gameplay to find out.
---
I don't get why there's only one killer outfit but two survivor?  Not very fair...
---
Save the Best for Last, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. Good luck looping me now, survivors.
---
Lithe, Bond, Iron Will, and Quick &amp; Quiet. A stealth build that allows the player to be stealthy while not having to crouch and hide everywhere.
---
I do suppose they could've made use of all that blank space though
---
It was Mathieu Cote and some other BHVR person. I believe they were consultants.
---
why?? i want the secret achievement 
---
I bet it took all of his courage to not scream "fuck off you exploiting little bastard" 
---
Thats where you draw the line huh?
---
Just need a boiler suit, a William Shatner mask (inside out), and a kitchen knife. Can't get lazier than that.
---
God tier big gei
---
Everything you said makes no sense.
---
The nodding heads got me good because I do that shit xD
---
You‚Äôll die if you get out of the gate with RBT on. Get out via hatch or take it off first.
---

---
Oh i didn't know what greifing was 
---
Yeah, it can't hurt to send the video in. Unfortunately I think devs have said something like over 20 mins is considered holding the game hostage. Still, send it in, might get a result anyway.
---
Yeah I'm guessing it was just to separate the other killers from freddy and the female ones because they specifically don't like them 
---
You seem to be the kinda guy who jumps to conclusions pretty much instantly. I'm not even a console player so I don't even have the capability of messaging people in an ongoing game, except when they are on my friendlist in steam already. 
---
Just because someone has a long playtime, doesn't mean they are doing anything wrong. Messaging during a game is not an ingame offense as long as the guy isn't spamming you with insults or asking you to farm (since farming is an offense). Also, you never know if they guy wasn't a nice killer for his first 2000 hrs in the game and then went rogue because he got bored. 
---
Whorehouse owner: Pretty good job so far.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
Susie is a sophomore
---
yes but there is 1% chance for die
---
No friend, unless you consider the tutorial offline play
---
what? u can take the trap off? how
---
Probably connection issues tbh. Once the survivor stars the vault action, you can't cancel them out of it. On their screen they probably already started vaulting.
---
what my own gameplay? i have played lots of game against pig head but she always kill me
---
what is RBT? 
---
There are banable things you can do that are toxic but not everything toxic is banable. 
---
??
---
The killer's objective is to kill survivors. If survivors get a stupid teammate, that's on the stupid teammate. Killers are allowed to take any opportunity they can to gain an advantage, just like survivors can.
---
I see what you mean. Maybe they can filter people who disconnect more than 2 times in a 30 minute window and temporary ban them using an algorithm.
---
Rejoice! Ochido is banned!
---
Take off the RBT first via the jigsaw boxes then exit the gate.  Don't exit the gate while you have the RBT like some people jokingly said here:  
---

Blocking till Deep wounds runs out is shitty, but not bannable. Blocking without attacking and doing it just to hold the game hostage is bannable though.

 Also the Post **\[Lorepost\] Is Legion really just Frank?** 
---
Makes a lot of sense to me, so it is only Frank, that get the appearance and all changed  by the entity, its still just him. I think the "Frank has a split personality" is still canon.

Witchunting is bannable on almost every game and on twitch. Plus the pedo stuff and the expoit abusing it's a well deserved ban
---
No
---
I usually like Cold Dirt + Susie's the most, but I've slugged all four survivors at the same time with Frank's before completely on accident. A lot of the time you don't get as lucky as it doesn't feel like that big of a difference, but if all four of them are running around in front of you boy does it get out of hand.

You've said 2 things that could be taken as an explanation.
---
&gt;The killer is waiting for the person to die
---
So is old facecamping. Therefore no difference.
---
&gt;Like another person commented here, it's like waiting out an RBT or a BT.
---
Being on the hook is a timer. That person related hooking timer to RBT and BT. Old facecamp waits out the timer, so does basement stairs hook blocking.
---
If I'm misinterpreting you, then please explain. That's why I asked in the first place.
---
I would let nurse choke me to death
---
~~I'll leave~~
---
wow your really good!
---
He lied to you. The chance to die of getting out with RBT on is 100%.
---
We can only conclude from this that Frank is into drag and blackface
---
&gt;The Entity's realm is not reality and it's capable of pulling from the memories and minds of its victims to recreate locations and things familiar to them (but not quite). It's very possible that due to the nature of Frank's disorder, the Entity interprets the way he's thinking as him being a particular person, and it manifests him as any of the four Legion members.
---
The trials aren't reality. The Entity manages the powers and things everyone uses in the trials and creates them itself. It is capable of changing the form of a killer within the trial if the killer is willing it, like how powers gain different characteristics based on the add-ons you pick.
---
this is awesome xD gj
---
Unsafe unhooks remove the 37% safe unhook from the emblem and are 500 bloodpoints lost. The emblem (that gives you the pip) is more important I think
---
Good idea 
---
There is.. it's called not gen rushing and clumping up.
---
the worst is when you see his mask in the darkness just staring at you and building up his evil within 
---
While you could have some shenanigans with 6 perk builds, a killer without any kind of usable power in game would be boring
---

no

sal doesnt have photo editor so he need use snapchat what majes sal tonight the biggest loser
---
Why arent you happy? 
---
No she can't see when you go to those boxes. There a addon that gives her a notification when you manage to get a trap off of you head. 
---
okay, this one is kinda funny at least
---
Looking at his post history, he probably does
---
The trails are real.The Entity has the power to give survivors the essentials to survive aka food and water.He saves the survivors before fully dying and heals them up aka they are sacrificed to the Entity.And keeps them in a cycle
---
Tier 1 isn't scary, as long as you see him first.
---
You already lose the 500bp bonus for safe unhook and they lose points in the altruism emblem.
---
What if the Killer is camping and you at least try to get an unhook? Why should you be punished? Sure, you'll have games where players farm you, but I'll gladly take that over punishing players for trying to combat camping.
---
I have 900 hours, prestige‚Äôs, never been reported and i message survivors during a game to tell them where the hatch is and take it cos I‚Äôm lazy..... and nice. 
---
He is some rando making crappy content but hes also an exploiter, cheater, and pedophile.
---
In my belief this Entity picks people from different realms and puts them into its own but I can see where your coming from
---
I did watch linked video and it just states guy asked 75 girls for nudes based on anonymous source. Didn't see any info about them being underage.
---
this is why i just skip the post lobby when i play as a killer. No need to read these toxic comments and get me riled up. or when the killer is toxic when i play as survivor.
---
The issue is that it's too hard of a counter.
---
Yeahhhh still gonna play him. I‚Äôm an adult, I don‚Äôt let people in an online game bully me out of the things I enjoy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Updated Video put original video in description thank you for pointing that out.
---
You're not getting it.
---
Solo survivors are always in a worse position than SWFs so no idea what that point is. SWF spread out across the map on solo gens is the counterplay. But most of the time SWF people stay glued to each other and double up on gens for some reason.
---
i looked at your post history, now what do i do/?
---
so you're saying the emblem for ranking up is more important than getting the good stuff with juicy BP? nah. who even cares for ranks and pips anymore. 
---
though I do agree it should be punished more severe. I'd even say not give any points till it's safe unhook. either bring BT and tank hits, or don't rush hooks like an idiot. 
---
just report the SOB now you have video proof too.
---
VHS porn
---
How I've played this game for over 2 years and am just now hearing of this guy for the first time honestly baffles me.
---
Hillbilly could be cavalry
---
Possibly many more reasons that couldn't fit
---
Haha. I do that every time
---
its the lich king from adventure time :o
---
That is non sense.
---
How do you not leave scratch marks when running away from them. Not to mention if they stab you, you have to mend asap, which makes getting away far impossible.
---
Show me a video where someone can get away without breaking line of sight. And even when you do, you likely have to mend, which put you on vulnerable position. 
---
You can joke about anything in this world. Death, genocide, bad behavior, sexism and so on. Sure, I guess majority of very sensible people will never understand that. But jokes are jokes. If they offend you, I am sorry. But personally, I think a human being can joke about anything and shouldn't be treated like shit because of it.
---
A Rocket League solution would be perfect. 
---
I have a question. Where is ochido from?
---
The point is that Legion feels horrible to face as a solo survivor, while any semi-competent SWF will just fuck him up.
---
Its absurd to say that only bad SWF's have a problem with Legion, he is unfun for everyone.
---
I‚Äôm a PS4 player and if you look on his profile his only game is dead by daylight
---
Those are bold words 
---
Why would you be confused about that? You think people were saying its mathematically impossible to get prestige with devotion 106?
---
Wow I didn't know. Ok that's illegal
---
Sex in your childhood: VHS porn
---
&gt;Plus i think dissociative personality disorders happen gradually
---
This is false. Some people have dissociative identity disorder and don't even know it, until they suddenly dissociate. It doesn't have to be set off by trauma or any kind of event they can't cope with, that's just one of the more publicized ways it happens. Many people with dissociative identity disorder experience dissociation in their regular lives, it just depends on which personality decides to come out. For instance, if a person wants to be at home for the day and relax, one of their personalities might disagree and think they should go out and do something, and they'll dissociate to that personality to go out.
---
And the backstories may not always be reliable narrators. I'd say the backstory is as told in third person from Frank's point of reference. If you read Leatherface, The Pig's, or Anna's backstories, they heavily empathize with the feelings of each of them and come from their point of reference, to convey the mental state of each killer. 
---
Probably not, cuz she died and was sent to the Entity's Realm which means no going back to her dad? Well that's my take on it
---
Definitely Monstour Shrine on Wraith is OP
---
Sex in a Foursome: Make Your Choice
---
i too believe William Shatner was beautiful when he was younger. 
---
I‚Äôd say the first would be a little to powerful in my opinion 
---
I need more then words to believe victims. And words are all that those victims have. Heard of a woman who admitted that her rape report few years ago was a lie? People still believed her. And those she accused of got their lifes ruined. If you want to point out so-called proofs, maybe I am wrong. But I am skeptical. I don't care about Ochido. Nor about this whole mess. Its rather... amusing, to see people who blame him and his fans for with-hunting, in-fact, always ready to witch-hunt him.
---
Removed for being uncivil
---
That explains a lot
---
The problem with adding debuffs or efects to the main ability of a killer is that it would require a cooldown because otherwise it could be exploited,  and that would break Wraiths whole purpose. Also think not every killer has to be inherently good on every single aspect of the game, Myers is crap at map pressure, Doc has crap mobility and Hag is crap at chases but still you can make them work by not relying at what they're bad and being really good at what they are good. That's the purpose of maining a killer. Now, the relationsship between how good a killer is in X and how bad it is in Y, paired with what a skillfull player can do and supossing a high skill team of survivors is what would inform a somewhat decent tier list.
---
 Controlling the rhythm of the match is essential for any killer, but every killer has its own rhythm, which can be modified by perks.
---
If you know how to control the map with Hag the chases will end instantly, if you know how to snowball with Myers there's no need to pressure the map and if you know how to track survivors you don't need the mobility on Doc. Look at Huntress, she has the worst mobility of the game and she's considered top tier.
---
XXXXXDXDDXDXXXDXDXDDDD 
---
True but how can frank know the tone of the town changed when they discovered the body of the janitor after they disappeared? he wasnt there, so it cant be told from his perspective can it?
---
What is his streaming name. Might pop in sometime.
---
&gt;Frank's mixtape is way too good, it makes Legion almost half as good as Nurse, Spirit or Billy
---
Obvious bait 
---
In Sal's defence it's 4:00 where he lives and he is very very lazy
---
If I recall correctly you BHVR have some sorta thing where you can have up to three account bans before you're hardware banned. 
---
But then people checking his stream and trying to snipe him will know when they end up in a match with him, and can then find out his Steam ID. After enough corroboration, his account would be known for sure and he will get banned after that. 
---
"The acquiring of any in-game skin through anything other than official channels (ie. codes, giveaways, etc.)"
---
Yeah, they can't do anything about people ruining the game for other players, but hack those skins and they'll find a way to make it happen. "Official channels" is code for money. 
---
In Frank's head they'd be real. It's in his mind, so the Entity could recreate what his visions of the rest of Legion are through that. Just like how it creates the maps out of memories from the killers.
---
Imagine how the Narrator sees Tyler Durden in Fight Club. He looks real, has his own appearance and personality. But, he's not real. That's the same way Frank would be visualizing his split personalities. 
---
He isn't terrible, it's a sustained battle, you need to constantly tag people to slow the game effectively. If they break out, they lose progression, alert Freddy and can retagged in a second.
---
He is bad at quick pressure and chases, but stall is his game. 
---
Then he starts walking faster

I feel like it does affect it, a higher chance for a better rarity, better add-ons, you can't tell me it only affects self rescuing and bear traps. I don't know any more uses for the luck stat, so I'm pretty safe it affects chests, and given Aces other perk is also chest specific, I'm sure it does. Except you have proof that it doesn't, of course

Try them all and see how they play. Honestly I started the game playing survivor, but once I felt comfortable I played the killer who to me was the scariest as far as looks, the nurse. She was free and the one who just by looks scared me the most when I got into the game. I was determined to learn her though she had a great learning curve. She is my main, but since then I‚Äôve tried pretty much everyone else. After playing the game a lot, I understand it‚Äôs all about preference, I hear a lot of people who dislike certain killers that I have no problem playing, and I personally dislike some killers who are used often. So use them and see how they feel to you! Though I tried several killers before my second main, Freddy, I didn‚Äôt want to pay attention to those who said that he was absolutely trash and just did my own thing, and honestly I wouldn‚Äôt do it differently. He is much more fun to use then say the Hillbilly to me, which honestly is my least favorite killer in the game. So explore and have fun, it‚Äôs a game after all so don‚Äôt worry about it too much ^_^

U shouldn‚Äòt. A friend of mine did it, he got banned. U could technically put graphics there that let u watch through buildings.

Just by replacing the perk icons in game files with the ones you like to have ingame.

Because this game is a trash fire for both sides and all versions right now. I lose people when I get bloodlust cause I drop a massive amount of frames

YES, I frequent the dbd community on tumblr and it's honestly fucking awful. They have absolutely NO idea how the game works and it make me irrationally angry to see them giving advice like they're good
---
Been using changed perk icons since 2016, still not banned. He got banned for something else most likely.

Don't worry just closed and opened the game they're back. :)

If I truly only desire to do killer , and understand the tactics and focus of survivors, why would you recommend survivor too ? I‚Äôd rather not frustrate myself but if you see great benefit to it I can stomach it if need be.

I have pretty dark humor too, my point is that he glorifies it. Its different if someone does rape jokes every 2 minutes cause its so awesome in their eyes. If you try to remind him that its a very real thing, he deflects. I'm not against dark humor or anything like that but the amount of jokes he does is pretty creepy, especially when he goes after females 24/7

I play her a lot, if you did this to me I would probably think its hilarious and let you come along as a sidekick. It's not like you're doing anything productive at the time anyway 
---
i believe only Amanda's Letter reduces jigsaw boxes
---
Yeah, I hate that a lot. Honetly, I do enjoy the salt they give me, it makes me feel good knowing that deep down they feel like I outplayed them. It feels extra good when they call me a camper and tunneler when I stay away from the hooks and just slug people if they just got unhooked. They are empty attempts to contribute dirty play on my side to their loss.
---
Its pretty simple how that happens. If a survivor presses spacebar before he actually gets shocked, he is in a vault animation and gets the vault since the vault action was started before the shock hit him. If the shock hits before he presses spacebar he wont get the vault.

I hate killers that dodge people. Not only are you wasting people's time, but you dodging SWF makes shure that there are more SWF in rotation and thus, indirectly, you contribute to increasing the chance of gettin matched up against SFW. Also, I've had many people dodge me as a solo player. I have no items and no one is playing the same survivor, but I think they haven't gotten used to all survivors joining at the same time and just assume a SWF joined. The rare times that I do play with SWF, it's not even obvious. The times that we do make it obvious is when we want to screw around and have some fun (pizza delivery dwight and all hiding in the basement lockers), changing our names to "Piggy Trap Me", "Trap Me Piggy", "Pls Give Me Trap" and "Trap On My Head". I think it's obvious what we're trying to do when we chose those names.
---
This is comming from a Killer Main btw. Please don't dodge SWF just accept it and play a normal match. If they turn out to be toxic, you can always be toxic back (facecamping)
---
Well done 
---
Well, he changed Adrenaline to a Mountain Dew. But if its not bannable, then I will do it too.
---
You couldn't react, as soon as I saw you noticing I would Sprint Burst/Dance With Me/Quick and Quiet to the other side of the map. I call it the Silent Bullet build.
---
I know I'm not doing anything but sometimes I just wanna have some fun. On the other side, when I fuck up and she notices she usually freaks out and I get camped and probably tunneled, so my teammates can work at their own pace.
---
The thing is I'm usually stuck at rank 13 as survivor (getring out of there is a pain in the ass, then you fly through ranks) and there survivors are still potatoes but killers go full tryhard so no fun allowed. Once you move up players start to have fun. I hate rank 13.
---
Dont message them afterwards though just move on
---
Who is this guy? 
---
Probably because he looks like he skips the shower.
---
That's clearly holding the game hostage, yes.
---
M'lord, this is fucking with my mind
---
Well shit!! :/
---
Not me irl
---
Hey you mind if I take the F-Tiers to a Pizza Party? ü§î
---
Agreed. Making him 100% invisible would break him, and be less scary for survivors. 
---
The plays that are bad against other killers, are still bad against Freddy.  With the current system in the game, killers have 4 objectives.  Their goal is to slow down generators, find survivors, hit survivors/break pallets/break generators, and to hook survivors.  It's not that Freddy gets bullied by survivors denying his hook, it's that he gets the opportunity to stop way more gen progress than the hook would have to begin with, while still getting a hook out of it but this time generators aren't popping since two other people were asleep and possibly still are.  Sure, the ultimate goal is to kill everyone but if the survivors don't complete all the generators then you get at least a 3k, 4 if you use Freddy's built in deerstalker to slug(I don't personally do this, but it is an option).  The more you slow down the generators by tagging and slapping people, the more likely you will inevitably get kills.  Nurse and possibly some other killers can simply race the survivors to try to get all the kills before they complete the generators, but Freddy needs to be a bit more methodical and try to establish/maintain some amount of control.
---
Many killers require the survivors to make mistakes in order to win, and Freddy not only gives survivors more opportunities to make mistakes(such as healing in front of him/not running away immediately/unhooking in front of him) but he thrives off of them deceptively so.  It's so deceptive that survivors often don't realize what they're doing them is hurting them in the long run and killers just assume Freddy is getting bullied since he's not immediately turning that into a hook. Those things slow the generators down more for Freddy than they do for other killers, giving him more time to ensure kills later on.
---
 Survivors who try to get a skill check during the dream transition often just ensure a free hit, but even if they do succeed in regressing the generator for you then it only cost you a couple of seconds to restart the dream transition.
---
Freddy doesn't have any ability to directly counter loops like some of the stronger killers do, but often he doesn't have to go through all the loops.  He can get that first hit/force down a good pallet or two, then move on to sleep other people knowing that person isn't going to be productive for awhile and now it will be easier to down people later who may not know that those pallets are now gone.  Not every one of Freddy's chases is going to end in a hook, or if it does then you're either doing exceptionally well or, more likely, you're going to get stomped.  Perhaps even over half of his chases should be dropped early to ensure multiple people stay slept/injured.  Freddy has to choose his chases a little better than other killers, and being able to keep up with where other survivors are combined with map knowledge of what strong tiles are near those survivors/how many pallets are still available in that area allows him to get downs without easily giving up generators.  You can choose to only commit to chases where people run toward other generators you needed to check/to unsafe areas of the map, at least situationally. Obviously you'll sometimes have to risk generators in order to get hooks, but Freddy gets to be the least committal to chases out of any killer which allows him to keep strong map pressure and ensure he doesn't get gen-rushed as hard.  Of course the best teams are still going to gen-rush him, just like they would every other killer except the very top percentage of Nurses.
---
I've had plenty of games where 3 or 4 survivors are all slept, yet wake up in under 20 seconds, it happens and it can suck.  I've also had plenty of games where people fully finish their self-care without waking up, or spend even longer than that not getting a skill check on a generator.  Some of the slept people are going to wake up very fast, some are going to wake up very slow and at least Freddy gets a lot more attempts to work with over the course of the trial for those numbers to average out to something acceptable than the Pig does with just 4 bear traps.  As long as they stay asleep long enough for you to tag/hit more people then it's a pretty good situation, and often you'll be able to get hooks during that window without losing many/any generators for it.  
---
Sure waking up gets rid of the sleep debuff, but it doesn't get rid of the damage done from being asleep.  They still lost out on generator progress, and you still probably know roughly where they are at.  In a lot of ways it's like a re-appliable Hex: Ruin on steroids.  To say his power is to maybe get the privilege of actually hitting someone after 7 seconds and nothing else, is like saying the Hag is very bad but not keeping most of her traps placed down.
---
On average the RNG is kind enough to Freddy to be serviceable, sometimes it can screw you, sometimes it gives you way more help than you need.  There is a lot of RNG in the game though, where totems/generators/pallets spawn, even where the killer and the survivors spawn can make subtle but dramatic impacts on the outcome of the matches.  It can be frustrating for either side to be adversely affected by RNG, like when someone dies because NOED spawned too close to the hook in order to cleanse/save, or both doors are beside each other and the killer can stand in the middle and see both so someone has to be a guinea pig.  Freddy can help mitigate skill checks with add-ons, but it still ultimately is just luck on exactly how potent his power gets to be and that's not entirely fair to anybody.  
---
Yeah and I think even though he isn't completely invisible not having the heart beat warning is a real advantage. 
---
Rules set no. 2 could be as soon as the survivor interact with the box the timer starts. It would be a meh add on in higher levels but in mid and lower it could be hilarious seeing people panic as their own struggle activated the timer
---
Xbox One, and not the Xbox One X

Troll alert 
---
I actually really like this

---
Don't forget he tried to start shit with truetalent as well.
---
I at least wouldn‚Äôt be frustrated by the person doing the gen.  In most of my games team mates are way too altruistic with all three other survivors pulling off gens to each try and unhook, completely stalling gen progress in the killer‚Äôs favor.  
---
Agreed. 
---
Interesting.
---
Are we sure it‚Äôs a perma-ban?
---
yeah, was easy to work out which one was the goblin :P
---
I feel personally offended by like half of these. Looking forward to number two. Hopefully your favourite argument starter can make it in there ;) 
---
Uncapped fps?
---
I don't think Legion is Billy/Nurse tier but I'm shocked that Behavior added a Killer that counters literally everything Survivors can do to get away. 
---
And I'm fine with that.
---
INB4 down vote city. 
---
Isn't the point of the game to fear the killer? Legion makes you actually scared even though he/she is actual garbage.
---
If you think Nurse promotes fun gameplay by teleporting between the 3 last gens and then slugging idk what to tell you, that's the least fun shit to play against of anything, same goes for all the other top tier killers.
---
I'd rather play against a Legion than a Nurse, Billy or spirit any single day of the week. I'll never understand why this subreddit has such a massive hateboner for a killer who is such garbage
---
happened to me twice in one day, it‚Äôs a 3 man swf going around and closing their games while loading in. i noticed it was the exact same people both times that were in the lobby with me.
---
There are a lot of argument-starters on this subreddit lol
---
*sweats nervously*
---
He also asked 75 different girls for nudes. His fans too
---
Jerking off = mad grit
---
no one is calling legion OP....
---
billy is fine you can still loop billy, nurse can get fucked
---
Can I have an argument instead of a personal attack?
---
He's not without his advantages (i.e no heartbeat). But I don't like the use of "not completely invisible", because he's basically visible unless he's standing still. I think a better phrase is "a little bit invisible" and that sums up why I think it needs to be changed.
---
He has some great add-ons, but you shouldn't have to use add ons for a killer not be bad.
---
Also, if a survivor is actually paying attention, and you're a wraith with no add ons, sneaking up on them is pretty impossible. At low ranks this isnt as much a problem, as they're not always paying attention. High ranks (and even mid ranks) it really is.
---
&gt;Legion is unfun gameplay for the vocal gen-rushing SWF groups that are too dense to know how to counterplay him and don't like versing a killer designed to prey on multiple survivors.
---
Pretty much. If you can't find multiple people in a match to slow their little asses down and don't have a Mori to just thin them out then yeah, you're getting gen-rushed. Funny you mention this, I don't think I've tried Legion against a 3 man SWF squad. Personally, I think when you face a 3-4 man squad you absolutely need either an Ebony or Ivory Mori just to even out the odds. 
---
I understand that you've given up on expecting more from game developers building a fun experience, but we can agree to disagree about nearly everything you've said. But I will say, yes I've moved to being killer-main and am now quite happy with lobby wait times and point amounts, both winning &amp; in loss. I'm just explaining the other side out of fairness.

Do you feel the same when the perk borrowed time is being used? I'll take someone off the hook if I'm being chased when I have borrowed time on.
---
Messing with game files MIGHT be bannable since there's no way for devs to know if you're doing something harmless or not. I think the devs mentioned even changing perk/character pictures is at your own risk. 
---
Fucking so hard that you die and continue as ghosts = spirits fury

---
My favorite type of a killer üòÇ 
---
I obviously prefer serious matches, but sometimes I just love being friends with the killer while they‚Äôre hooking everyone else. 
---
I just had this happening the other day with the Trapper ‚Äì he spotted me immediately when the match started and I decided to slowly t-bag and nod my head at him instead of running away, and for my surprise he just did the same and went to look for other survivors. At first I kept my distance but then noticed that he indeed didn‚Äôt hurt me at all, just everyone else and let me run around fixing generators and healing others or running next to him throughout the entire match. I wasn‚Äôt being toxic as in leading him
---
to others etc. and it was super funny. He killed all three, and let me escape. And now we‚Äôre PSN friends lol, I never do that with anyone but he was great. 
---
its a new bug, from 2.5. it is caused by uncapped fps, and the devs are working on fixing it.
---
yeah i agree :S 
---
Sex in the pet shop = pop goes the weasel 
---
I'm gonna go with no
---
You cant react in the timeframe hes ringing his bell lol, thats barely anytime at all. Being able to see him while moving stops him being annoying to go against
---
Phew thanks that hyperrealistic skull almost bamboozled me.
---
Same here (PC).
---
Nothing shows the skill level of a player. Prestige is only time and ranks are only for matchmaking purposes. Purple ranks usually play better than red ranks.
---
That would be the much better thing to implement rather than punishing players who are trying to save when there‚Äôs a camping killer. Should they also put it in that the hooked survivor can cancel the unhook? Just like you can cancel when someone‚Äôs healing you. 
---
Dont forget that they are underage girls. 
---
Could just be a Halloween piece. Also, please give credit to the original artist. When I type in 'Vaporwave Michael Myers' in Google, this is literally the first result.
---
Yeah, i probably honestly belong at like 8-4 for killer, but last season maining legion just fast tracked me to rank 1 within i swear hours of gameplay time, then all I versed were absolute sweat fest swf that, most of the time, I would have to legit facecamp the first down i got to secure even a single kill (still didn't do that because that honestly just isn't fun but jesus). 
---
Legit went from double pips every 4k to sometimes even double pipping on a 1-2k, legion is just way too easy to ride to rank 1, even if the game goes tits up (i think mainly because you get so many "successful chases" because you can so reliably hit survivors, not to mention the amount of deviousness you get from spamming your power)
---
Sex in the Hospital = NURSES CALLING !
---
I really do be like dat when it do
---
Level Nurse or Doc. You don't want Huntress perks infecting your bloodwebs. You should only prestige if you are willing to commit to the *GRIND*. And I don't know what DLCs have to do with BP.
---
Me too. Technically I did do the last generator and was the last to leave, but I wasn't the last alive. 
---
That would be pretty cool.
---
And when you die the entity should lower you down into the ground like the battle boss from FN (Fortnite)
---
would there be danger zones too?
---
I really hope the developers read reddit then they will see this and do this because it is a good idea. but they probably wont because developers never do good ideas... especially nintendo... they should let me developer the pokemon games. i cant program but i can write the storys and give the programmers good ideas like make it a mmo game and let you choose from all the starters and buy masterballs in the mart. i also think there *needs* to be a game that has all the maps in 1 game and then you can get an airplane or ship (SS Anne, anyone :) to the other regions!
---
of course, the developers won't read this so they will never do this. but if you do please look into hireing me as a consultant when I turn 18. If they want I would actually be willing to do it part time when I turn 16
---
That Nurse skin could be actually incredible if animated correctly!
---
Love these concepts - they‚Äôre amazing. 
---
If you don't need a killer right now just wait. If you want a fun killer with great perks get Spirit. If you want a farming killer with one cool perk get Legion.
---
Around march afaik. 
---
Seems pretty unfair towards the side that doesn't get a skillcheck. It's way easier for killers to find the hatch than it is for survivors. Killers should not be allowed to win by just camping the hatch. Especially concidering that you can just slug one of the 2 remaining survivors. I am a killer main, but I feel like if a survivor makes it to the hatch, they deserve to escape
---
Why does it matter if he has YouTube money
---
You first scott.
---
Sure! I‚Äôm not the best with body types, but this is good experience.

The next Chapter *should* be out in 5 weeks from Tuesday, which is the 5th of March.
---
Totally agree
---
I mean, he was using a fresh account so his selection was kinda limited.
---
Just kinda funny since the top tier killers are pretty much free.
---
I wish the moonwalking thing could just get erased from everyone‚Äôs memory so we could all just play them as intended. I love Legion so much to the point they‚Äôre pretty much my main and knowing they aren‚Äôt game healthy and probably will never be is disheartening. I‚Äôm just gonna keep playing to have a real threatening Presense in game, not Moonwalk and not need FMT cause it‚Äôs a sucky addon when you play normally. 
---
Also no one talks about Double Blade Legion how mending takes an actual century and with something like Stridor, the survivors are crying ducks that ya can guarantee will basically reveal their location for the duration of the Mend. 
---
I don't think he should be completely invisible like Freddy is, because it would be kind of unfair. He can be invisible when he's standing still anyway. However, I do think they should reduce the "shimmer" or whatever you call it, it's too easily spotted.
---
It makes me think of invisible enemies in The Evil Within. In this game, the enemies are not entirely invisible but the "shimmer" is kind of difficult to spot and sometimes you can have a hard time finding where they are, especially in the middle of a fight. It would be cool if the wraith was like that too.
---
Also : use old reddit (I love the night mode one), the new reddit for this sub is garbage. The text suddenly became light grey for some reason even if it was black before, it's annoying as hell lol.
---
I mean... such game would need a lot of surviors and if your friend gets to be the killer (i will get to that later) he can kill everyone and let you win. With no objective everyone would just hide in a locker and it would just be a matter of luck who will killer find first. Also it would take ages for such game to end. Statement
---
HAHAHA in the survivors favor ok bud nice lie 
---
Holy shit it actually works! 
---
Excuse me, what do you mean you wouldn't wreck Nea harder than David Cameron wrecked England?
---
In Susie's defense, Rin (Spirit) never killed anyone pre-mortem.
---
Spoken like a true survivor. He's supposed to be annoying to go against. Also, the bell rings for 1.5 seconds? (citation needed) That's more than enough time to gain some good distance on him, especially with sprint burst, since he's slowed ringing it. Moreover, he will always struggle to land a second hit since has has little to no chase potential. That wont change with this.
---
The most informational thread this sub reddit had ever produced :p
---
Did you just get offended by a meme?
---
But she‚Äôs a ghost not a shy teenage girl wearing black leggings to killing sessions
---
I know right! 
---
OINK
---
Because Nurse requires practice and mechanical skill, Billy does too to some extend but Legion is just "activate power twice, boom".
---
I agree that it should be easier for the survivor, I just didn't want to get flamed on a killer main sub so I said I'd be fine with either way lol The survivor should definitely get the hatch if they find it, but if the killer finds it first they should at least get a chance too, so a survivor-side skillcheck to make it through would be perfect imo.
---
No, it as much as I love them they got take out for many very good reasons. They are flashlights - any skill....
---
Oink
---
Reeeeeee
---
*hi mark?*
---
You took 15 minutes to down us so we are legally allowed to leave /s
---
This , ... a coordinated  team can easily play around a camp , the only killer that makes it remotely difficult is leather face.  
---
The thing is, they have no right to be mad. I was trash. I got one kill, and that was only because they got cocky and I got lucky. Maybe they were just mad they didn't get a flawless escape.
---
Maybe if he sends him some nudes...
---
This buff makes no sense, as soon as the survivor has a rbt they immediately start searching for the boxes, 99% of the cases
---
0 effort, piss poor punctuation, gradeschool insult post of a terribly/barely edited jpeg, and the community eats it up like animals to a trough
---

all i'm saying is that you lot, who can't help but seek toxicity at another's expense insatiably, deserve eachother
---
I miss hits I should have gotten because I lose massive frames as I'm about to hit them.

yes but they won't know where the boxes are which makes them waste more time than usual

As if pips matter. Same reason the camping nerf didn't do much "killers lose the chaser emblem if standing around the hooked survivor". Until pipping has rewards, then there's no point in popping (unless you want bragging rights, even though it's already easy to get to rank 1 anyway)

Wait, he did? Mind explaining? Sounds interesting.

Also this is supposed to be a game about making a few mistakes, imagine if robots played dead by daylight lol
---
Welp that's a thing lol
---
Granted, annoying wasn't the right word. What I meant was "not easy" to go against. A well made killer is fun to play, to play against, and challenging agreed. The Wraith is not challenging to play against (unless he has stacked some great addons) if you're not rank 15 and below. He would be more challenging if you had to rely on your reflexes and quick thinking (you know, the correct way to respond to an ambush) instead of just having to manage the slight inconvenience of actually looking for the killer.
---
The timing of this console ban feature is impeccable, almost as if it were intended for Ochido, himself. Good job BHVR!!!

Just a heads up if it happens again at some point your rank might get reset like a rank reset. I had the dlc missing issues all of December. I rebooted one day and got the rank reset screen. For killer it wasn‚Äôt so bad but it sucked balls as survivor because I was stuck with the suck players for a few days.

I‚Äôm also on Xbox and I do not have this problem anymore at least the latest patch fixed it for me

You're welcome, I guess lol.
---
I doubt they'll change the wraith anytime soon though. They should definitely rework other killers first (*cough* Freddy *cough*).
---
But didn't they buff wraith not so long ago ? I wasn't playing dead by daylight then but I haven't really noticed anything different. He's one of the easiest killers to face, even for a noob like me.

Damn, you rly know how to take things out of context and fail to realise the frustration behind the challenge. This challenge was hard - he was streamsniped hard, we know this cus we saw another streamer facing him as survivor while another survivor said in lobby "Its Tru3, he is perkless Nurse so just genrush him". Stop spreading these lies already. Both Tru3 ans Zubat did this challenge, why do you feel the need to praise one while pulling another one down! Be mature and stop this already.

sounds to me like you suck mega ass at the game, if you get camped at the start thats a fucking easy win, legit just gen rush and get chased for more then 15 secs (i know thats hard for you but you can do it i believe in you) DCing is nothing to brag about. you are basically bragging about not only losing, but being to scared to lose to the point you quit to make yourself feel better

I'd love to cosplay the Huntress and this is lovely! I really liked this cosplay. Appreciation sent!

Console must be realy different then. Ive played it on the Steam free weekend, loved it (that rank 20 chaos was realy funny) bought it, 7 hours, had alone in this weekend 2 games with the last survivor holding it hostage for an eternity, hiding somewhere refusing to leave.

Alright lol I didnt know :)
---
THATS SO FUCKING VALID
---
legion is pretty fun, only prob i have is when playing in lower ranks, he‚Äôs ti easy to juke especially on console. Its practically unfair that legion can lose his prey so fast on console if someone 360s
---
Only if you're using bell addons that quieten it or remove it, because otherwise they'll hear you. You still very may well get a free hit, if you're lucky enough that cover lines up for you to approach that way, but the chase that follows will be as painful as always, and you have no way of pressuring the map or slowing the game down.

So after 2.5 hours i decided to leave. My patience has limits, and i had stuff to do
---
Cross the "sex in" in the 3rd one and I can relate.
---
First bing, then bong
---
Pretty sure he was a rugby player so yes
---
Step 1: Bing.
---
Step 2: Bong.
---
Step 3: ???
---
Step 4: Profit.
---
The last part? What?
---
David is overrated. Jake is the true daddy
---
Looks like im not the only one who started adding their name to the meme!
---
I like The Clown and Huntress, but that all changed when Legion came out...
---
**OINC**
---
SFM?
---
Hell no she doesn‚Äôt
---
Literally nobody didn't appreciate it, the title is the definition of fishing for attention and since we're on Reddit this shit always flies with the general userbase. 
---
Well i mean the killer isn't really killing anyone now are they?
---
If you think about it the only one doing the killing per say is the entity,
---
The killers just assist.
---
I'd get the claudette in that situation. It's going to make the game last longer and it's likely going to be a 4k anyways. More points and gg for everyone. 
---
That sucks.. 
---
well, killers have moris

---
How does that make his power weak? I have to put them in the dream world to interact with them, so I might as well get them in there sooner so I can start chase sooner. 
---
Unfair advantage? That seems a bit unbalanced imo
---
He actually does the same sort of thing as Legion, only on a lesser scale. He punishes teamwork and makes it very difficult for a survivor to escape a chase and wake up if they're being tunneled. He basically encourages camping the one survivor so you can sleep them and them alone so no one else can intervene with the chase or, if he sleeps everyone, the game progress basically stops until 2-3 people wake up. Don't get me wrong, he's not as boring to be chased by as legion but there can be a lot of down time, especially if he does a 3 gen lockdown.
---
Nah, he's not Russian. It has never even crossed my mind. Either American or British^^
---
Hey man, at least it isn't dr pains, getting everyone hooked with 4 gens left, last Jake LITERALLY throws EVERY SINGLE PALLET COLD WIND FARM HAS TO OFFER, we are talking a legit 10 min chase, you finally slug him, disco-disco-disconnected.
---
Wraith is a pretty bad killer, but a really fun one imo. You prob wanna level him up before playing, because without green, purple, or red addons it is pretty painful to play him. The best ones are windstorm and swift hunt, but all seeing is nice in both blood and spirit form. The other set is the cox combed clapper (ultra rare) and the ghost (common) which in combination makes your decloaking completely silent, and makes some really cool grab plays, however this rarely works above yellow ranks because people start looking out for the shimmer that wraith gives off. My favorite combo is all seeing in spirit form, as well as swift hunt in blood form. It allows you to know where survivors are by seeing progress of gens, and swift hunt makes it easier to get quick hits from the info all seeing gives you. The perks you wanna run are enduring (for light resistance as well as pallet camping during decloak), brutal strength to kick pallets fast in cloak form, hex ruin, and bbq. However the thing about wraith is that his addons can replace perks. All seeing blood form can replace tracking perks. All seeing spirit form can somewhat replace hex ruin or bbq. There‚Äôs an addon that can replace brutal strength. 
---
Bearded David + Shirtless david is 100% SMASHABLE and the reason why I let him live most of the time 
---
I agree. A game should be fun but the Legion... Just isn't...
---
I agree its forced altruism, but it‚Äôd be good for the game overall.  I get the whole I don‚Äôt want to waste my time, but what ends up happening is next match someone else gets tunneled that isn‚Äôt you. So then they DC which is also a waste of time for everyone else..rinse and repeat.
---
They do indeed.
---
Who the hell give them thay shitty idea to create tennager with paperplate head and pocket knife?  
---
Unfortunately. There was (And still is) a lot of potential for them... We'll just have to see how (Or if) the Devs respond...
---
Either way, he‚Äôs uncut.  That‚Äôs all you need to know.  
---
Thanks
---
Welcome to my TED talk
---
I once had certain *dreams* with the Huntress and I wish I could go back. With Myers as well, more than once actually and I got no regrets
---
Thank you
---
How do you know? monkaS
---
I actually think they're one of the cooler designed Killers. Menacing... Not so much...
---
üëå 
---
Facts
---
He got permanently banned and then went to ps4 where they couldn‚Äôt ban him to get around it that‚Äôs def against the rules 
---
Most of them are actual games taken straight from the VOD with no editing.
---
I love this idea! A killer who could focus on truly sneaking up on survivors by staying out of eyesight could make a very scary killer. He'd probably have to have an animation to go out of harvest mode so the survivors don't die too much. Also as a bonus cosmetic feature, you could have no crows spawn when playing scarecrow besides spies from shadows.
---
Well, after the guy quits, I will come to know the reason why he quit. I will also quit after that. Simple. 
---
Really feelsbadman
---
Shades of Dio abusing time stop just to fuck with Polnareff.
---
Yes officer, this comment chain right here
---
End of the match after I got some BP, I'm usually not upset. At the beginning of the match with no generators done, yeah I'm pretty pissed. 
---
you didn't play Fred much, did you?
---
He's a born and bred biscuit.
---
Obviously he plays it because he makes money streaming it. 
---
Many dbd streamers would like to play/stream other games but their fans are dbd fans 
---
Not standing up for ochido (although i don't care about downvotes) just saying that's why
---
goddamnit. 
---
Alright this one is attacking me
---
And then the Michael hits Tier 3 
---
Justice for Meg wtf.
---
Nice Snapchat meme have we ascended?
---
Good job op.
---
Yes but by not putting all survivors asleep you cant slow the game down a swell. If everyone is in the dream before you chase they all have 50% reduction. But by putting one person asleep at the time the 50% reduction is almost never in action.
---
had a really good match against a myers, led him on a few chases, got some good unhooks and plenty of generators. my team were relatively good too but unfortunately all wound up sacrificed.
---
got the last generator done just as he hooked the only other living survivor who proceeded not to struggle, probably intending to just let me have the hatch since i was self caring on the other side of the map. didn‚Äôt realise good old mike had BBQ &amp; Chilli until he smacked me around the wall, but i‚Äôd had a good match so i didn‚Äôt bother wiggling, figured he deserved the 4K.
---
dude carried me to the hatch he‚Äôd found on the other side of the map instead, dropped me on it, and walked away.
---
was super appreciated after the shoddy matches i‚Äôd had before and in a year of playing that‚Äôs only happened to me about 3 other times.
---
it was my last match before my PS+ ran out too, so i ended on a good note.
---
thank u michael i love u &lt;333
---
Hmm yeah that is true , all rank 1 is at this point is to be able to say , yeah I‚Äôve been rank one so I don‚Äôt have to try anymore .
---
He looks funny. Specially when you stun him and he just stands there lifelessly
---
Well that applies to everything no matter the addon. I will always break chase to put people in dream state. It‚Äôs not the addons fault, it‚Äôs the player‚Äôs fault.

---
In all honesty, I didn't really have the motivation to play him. The hype burned out really quickly so I stayed with Huntress, Billy and Nurse... Is he fair to play?
---
An all time classic.
---
Give survivors 6 perks so we can talk.
---
there is no rule you can't play on other platform. besides, he didn't do anything bad since then except for being a toxic shit. but same many other  people do and never get even temporary bans. 
---
and any way, the ban says "griefing" not "ban evasion". while he didn't do what the ban says. if they'd say "ban evasion" I wouldn't care. though still no rule you can't switch platform. 
---
and even with all that they banned the most subscribed dbd YouTuber. he is not the best, but what their pr team is thinking? instead of contacting him and maybe asking him to change, they just ban and ignore. they do the same with the community what they do with the game. instead of being smart being complete idiots. 
---
"i can no longer wank to these cartoons because of this reddit post"
---
Maybe an ultra rare add on; in return would take him longer to unclear maybe
---
*DUUUUD THATS ILLEGAL O DUUUUD
---
Guy is a griefer and circumvented the ban. That's okay, Err... I mean easy to prove and ban worthy.
---
Yet whole pedophilia thing is questionable. This is serious accusation and only proof I see in comments is video claiming he asked girls for nudes. As sleazy as it is, that is not a criminal offense. I didn't see girl's age being mentioned in this video. Maybe just missed it, but that's not the point.
---
If there is concrete evidence, then that should be reported and investigated, but for some reason people seem to believe it just enough to repeat the thing over and over, but not enough to actually do something about it. So, pedophilia is only "interesting" as an argument to bash a person you don't like(seems to be well deserved, but still) and apart from this no one really cares.
---
Quite hypocritical to add witch hunts to the list of his crime while doing exactly the same.
---
And my axe!
---
How many British/Russian guys have you sucked off?  Cause I got some stats to work with.  
---
Funny thing no single one and it will stay like this lmao
---
Just pallet the entity 
---
Put Laurie to quentin and Meg in her previous place and we are good.
---
Yeah no shit. But by putting all survivors to sleep before you chase, you can start chasing people who are already asleep, making the dream transition 0 basically.
---
*Seen by Donald Trump*
---
!
---
Who tried to be quiet in dorms? That‚Äôs when you start getting crazy, cause there‚Äôs no fear of anyone catching you lol
---
It‚Äôs cool man, just learn to prioritize. 
---
there's nothing to him what you just said. he's crippled but challenging. games with him don't last for long. if Fred is good, he will 4k pretty fast, if not, you'll open the gates and t-bag him trying to put you to sleep. the waking thing sometimes takes forever but mostly you wake up in few seconds, I don't see the problem with that. to me it's less annoying than crouching with Hag or constantly looking at the ground with Trapper. 
---
and yeah, only thing he has is this wallhack. where he still only had 115 speed to get to you and not immune to pallets or windows. 
---
And the survivors will pay for this!
---
Really Amanda...?
---
me too
---
Then you must learn to accept the wisdom of those who venture in untraveled lands.   
---
And that‚Äôs bad because???? Not putting as many survivors as possible in dream state is on the player, not the addons. 
---
His backstory says he was raised in Manchester and the wiki lists his ethnicity as English.

Legion equips Franks mixtape*
---
Legion: ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôm something of a musician myself.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm against the weapons. But I would love a custom match with 2 killers and 20 survivors. 
---
I thought that he could have a sickle on a chain (5 of them) and he could throw them at survivors, pulling them to him like a smoker from L4D2, but survivors can get to the chain and free the survivor.
---
Note: After throwing a chain into survivors the chain automatically removes. When a survivor frees a victim from the chain it removes too.
---
i was going for adept huntress without iri heads and slugged the fuck out of survivors. when i saw the last survivor i wanted to give him hatch but i needed the achievement. i apologized trought dms and he told me that it was fine and gg. when i made another lobby, i found him and his swf group and we almost maxed out out bloodpoints
---
So true. I've had that happen so many times. Shortly after I made this meme, I got the guy who inspired this meme in another lobby. I tunneled him, hooked him, face camped, and let the other three go. 
---
Pretty much
---
I believe it
---
Approach Gens in stealth, from angles they cant see, you bing bong and hit one, then you bing bong into stealth again and hunt from stealth.
---
Don't be afraid of using stealth to your advantage.
---
I just did the thing I spoke of in my previous comment on the same guy twice because he happened to be put in the same situation and sure enough it did count twice
---
I never said anything about interner problems. I am saying that the game can randomly crash on you. While it's not all that likely, it is very plausible that the game crashes twice in the timespam of 1 hours. My "shit" is all sorted out, but it's not my fault if the game suddenly decides I've played enough. The way you imidiately go in the offense doesn't suit me, I never said I have those problems, i just know that the game has a tendency to crash.

Unless it's Clear Reagents on survivor. That's normal.

True, but the icon folder is still nothing that is searched trough by EAC. As long as it stays that way we are allowed to do whatever with it. 
---
Lol, I had the same kind of moment for a sec before I remembered it won't go any higher... 
---
Wraith Rank 1 here, I agree that observant survivors is his weakness, but a total invisible Wraith would make him very dangerous. Too dangerous.
---
Can we agree, Full Invisibility should be an Ultra Rare or Rare addon?`That would be way better IMO.
---
I think most players have been there. I remember a year ago this also happened to me. I was so stocked until some person I was playing with told me it's caped D:
---
Really? Always find it fun to playa against Freddy cause you don‚Äôt do it very often and the games stand out. Decently fun to play as him 2 unless you‚Äôre tryharding for wins (I‚Äôm a Freddy main).
---
Hardware bans are easy to get around
---
Every freddy I see tunnels a single guy all game, so I either get ignored or tunneled all game, neither of which are balanced which makes it unfun for me personally
---
You know, a 0 days old account with -4 karma where these are the only comments left is kinda suspicious
---
Thank you üòäüíï
---
Oh my god this just clicked for me
---
Holy shit why
---
Haven‚Äôt experienced that personally but that‚Äôs lame, is it cause they‚Äôre using remember me?
---
Lit, huh
---
No I‚Äôm in green ranks so they probably cant get kills with him any other way
---
Damn. Thanks man
---
I see what you did there...
---
I wouldn't mind, but I'm not seeing how it'd make him exceptionally strong. Good, yes probably. Maybe Myers level of good. I'm trying to ask it be worked into his base kit because I feel like he relies too much on addons already to be healthy. Swift hunt, shadow dance, red clapper, windstorm, all improve him considerably, but without them he's really, really weak.
---
Yeah it would make him very dangerous at rank 20. But Freddy is very dangerous at rank 20. It's the nature of invisible killers.
---
Raise your beers 
---
That‚Äôs not true, I only played PlayStation for years and RvB was still my favorite

Really funny meme btw
---
You need dedicated servers for this, coming this summer.

What? Franks mixtape means you dont have to moonwalk. You hit them twice in frenzy right away, wait for cooldown and then hit them and they‚Äôre down.
---
Two-edgy4-ochido
---
No problem, just doing me job
---
survivors hitboxes are fucking broken
---
When two survivors are working on the same gen the sopeed slows down by 10%, so instead of doing it at 200% speed is at 190%. The red bar was always supposed to show but it was broken, this patch fixed it.
---
It shows that your progress speed is downgraded by 10% per people who are working on the generator with you
---
This took a hard left turn
---
it's based on who i would smash m8
---
180*
---
Add your ranks up and divide by 4. That's the rank of the killer you'll match against. 
---
I thought the gen detected more than one survivor and then applied the 10% penalty. Didn't know it was per survivor.
---
The game is literally designed around the concept of fun and playability, not a contest of who‚Äôs best. The devs even openly stated on a discussion about legion‚Äôs viability that they design characters and the like by how fun it would be to play and play against, not how good any of those elements would be in a competitive setting.
---
If you honestly think adren, dead heard, self care and DS is an OP build, you‚Äôre a brainlet
---
Self care is bad though. Just run Iron Will
---
Making this an addon is a good compromise, don't forget freddy is getting a rework currently in the works and so I dont think having freddy op at Rank 20, is a good indicator of what the devs intend.
---
Thank you for seeing it the way I would have assumed everyone would.
---
Never call customer service, or get grounded while in the simulation. Those are the 2 rules 
---
Dont forget the "I facecamped a toxic teabagger/I camped when exit gates were powered, am i wrong guys" posts

Keep it up. :)

So guys... we did it
---
Sex tape: Surveillance
---
GUYS, THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD LEAVE WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHANCEüò§üëè
---
Yeah, I don't really understand the whole "R20 to R1" challenges either.  Ranks 20-12 are full of players that feel like Easy AI and after that it becomes, as you said, an RNG slog.  
---
For streamers in particular, I feel these challenges are kind of disingenuous most times.  Some of the more "liked" streamers will have snipers that pretty much run in front of them or take it easy and respect them way too much, some of the other streamers will face demonic hit squads.  
---
It'd be better to do these challenges by recording them off camera under a new name/account entirely if you want to do it at all but at the end of the day they don't really fulfill much purpose other than, as you said, some bragging rights and fanboy parroting.  
---
I didn't know shitposting paid.
---
had this issue a moment ago, it's not just you
---
Diversion
---
Slow: you have a hard time flinging yourself through windows. You physically cannot do a medium/medium/fast or faster vault.
---
Quiet time: there is a 15/35/50% the killer will not get a visual notification when a generator is finished. (All other indicators such as aura or gens remaining are unchanged)
---
Powerwalking: gain 2/4/6% speed after not vaulting, stopping, or using a power in a chase for 5 seconds
---
I thought Visconti was an Italian name
---
An amazing one night stand: Remember Me
---
In most cases it‚Äôs better not to take the chance if you don‚Äôt feel like dealing with the bs than risk a toxic and unfun experience for everyone where you facecamp because they were toxic. That‚Äôs no fun for anyone, so just dodge the match for a match that‚Äôs more likely to be fun/fair.
---
I have not been banned yet. So far I've only used the items glitch, not the prestige one. I've used it to obtain around 30 BPS. I am not sure if I want to continue as this is good enough for me I don't want to get too greedy, this small little boost will make me happy. :)
---
After reading all these replies, I decided I will disconnect on any one camping hook. Just like you guys are all toxic, I will be too. :);
---
had a guy use macro or a bot to keep saying "LMAO EASY GET REKT" 20 times per second. what a pathetic piece of shit ya know?
---
Laurie and Quentin Z tier. 
---
That's gotta be a lag switch. 
---
Good maybe the killer will learn to stop when people keep leaving and he's BORED you idiot.
---
Fuck I‚Äôm dumb didn‚Äôt even read the title
---
You don't
---
it's alright be happy i didn't woooosh you
---
Sad :(
---
Jeff and Nea are my S++ tier. UwU 
---
Sweet and little, like his victims.
---
Tru3talents was pretty impressive, playing with no addons or perks looked really hard.
---
He's not good but he's not awful
---
Don't be sad. Its ok.
---
He is a hung british god
---
I checked the comments for some super reaching innuendos and.... nope. Literally every perk in this game can be rationally converted into some form of sex act
---
He's saying he gets a lot of views. He isn't saying his content is good. Is like pumping out trash games but getting a lot of sales like some CODs. Doesn't really matter if the content is good, that is subjective after all, the only objective thing is that they get a lot of views. That said if he deserves a ban, he deserves a ban, no matter how many people he's moving into DBD.
---
Would be nice seeing Ghostface but it would be impossible adding him.
---
If I remember correctly only one of them escaped, but they were for some reason pretty focused on one single generator. It was in Springwood, the one close to the Killer's shack, in a sidewalk. They kept running for that gen as soon as I turned my back and I was honestly so confused
---
next up tydetyme for being an idiot
---
Upvoted because I just love the word ‚Äúhardened gilf‚Äù 
---
There is one thing that u/Whos_Griffin got right. There ain't no escaping Freddy if he absolutely wants you dead. *(Tunnelling)*
---
He got hardware and IP banned from DbD on PC, and going to PS4 to avoid that is enough for the same treatment.
---
And then it says ‚ÄúChat offline - Killer disconnected‚Äù
---
Never exist: As soon as the match loads you disappear into the mist to never be heard from again.
---
Freddy's PP is probably all burnt up
---
F indeed
---
a.k.a P3 Claudette
---
Why would 75% be Max. That doesn't make any sense
---
This is just a normal picture I don‚Äôt see any totems 
---
*Long comment extremely well formated helping OP balance the whole chapter*
---
OP (choose one):
---
-Doesn't reply
---
- "thanks man"
---
- "well thats ur opinion"
---
- "chill, is just for fun"
---
OP *forgets about the chapter in one post and does another within a 3 hour span with another unbalanced killer*
---
Repeat.
---
It's a new bug, the devs are aware of it &amp; they're actually banning people for it. I can't tell you how it works (since it's a bannable offense &amp; posts to that nature are being removed,) but I would keep this post bookmarked. If you DO get banned (which I think would be unlikely since it just happened once &amp; people truly exploiting the bug would probably use it more than once,) I'd send this post in as support for it being accidental.
---
Eh...i'd say the store stuff is pretty damn awesome.
---
Expensive yeah but skin quality on a level we never saw prior to it's addition.
---
The killer can't see survivor perks until the game is over, why should the survivors get to know the killers perks before the game is over as well? That's an unfair advantage.
---
The entitlement is unreal.
---
What about mine?
---
Bump up Min and Jake to S tier.
---
Drop down Tapp
---
But than that I agree
---
Shut the fuck up and stop blaming everything on ochido
---
I also think the matchmaking in this game is fucking garbage so it might ght just be an internal issue. 
---
The system will try to match you to a killer that is between your ranks (7+2)/2 = ranks 4-5. You can be matched higher or lower though as well.
---
For the record: Enduring saves you about 2.25s off a 3s stun (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7bsk0l/is_it_quicker_to_have_enduring_3_take_the_stun/dpkh0ap/).

---
Indeed my friend 
---
This justifies camping and tunneling and NOED use but they will still lynch you for it lmao
---
Surely it would be ‚ÄúPredator‚Äù
---
And then you see a dropped-down pallet, then you run into it and it turns out to be real, and Doc gets a free hit.
---
Nice, when do we get rid of jen and her breed?
---
Whoa calm down. If you think Ochido didn‚Äôt spread the stereotype of Claudettes being toxic you are just wrong. Spreading a stereotype isn‚Äôt bad but I do t like being depicted as raging ass for playing a character a streamer plays. 
---
Ok thanks, I‚Äôm just not going to prestige anyone else just so it doesn‚Äôt happen again.
---
He's decent at getting a free hit anyways. This would just allow him to take a more advantageous position before uncloaking. The Legion sucks to play against because you they're great at getting a first hit, and windows and pallets are generally ineffective. They can also track really well by seeing the location of others. The Wraith could still be looped, still be outplayed, still have pallets slammed on him. He'd still lack map pressure too. He'd just actually be able to sneak up on people and mindgame them better with his cloak. Your parallel doesn't work as this wouldn't patch out his core weakness- lack of chase and pressure, he'd just actually be able to be stealthy as a stealth killer. Imagine that.
---
And "doing gens, you?"
---
I dont really want his "clienty" in the game anway, toxic garbage like him should come to dbd ! I am ok with the hand full assholes we got, we dont need more ! 
---
There‚Äôs more than just ‚Äútoxic‚Äù play. People listen to streamers and YouTubers. No one would play Nea cause she is fucking ugly. No0b3 popularized her into the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù figure she is now. Only difference is the No0b3 hasn‚Äôt done anything douchy. He doesn‚Äôt teabag or bm people in other ways. He isn‚Äôt THE reason why people are toxic but when a Claudette is toxic it‚Äôs usually be a of Ochido.
---
Whats going on, what happened?
---
That just adds onto my point more. He purposefully deranked to bully less experienced killers with his friend group. Any video with someone running into him usually ends up with him getting rekt cause of how bad he is.
---
Have to wait and see, im dubious how they can tell unless someone else reports you or its superobvious (loads of new items etc)
---
Absolutely no idea why you made this, but Tapp is top tier so I agree. 
---
Almost every new killer goes through a phase where they test to see what strategies work. Eventually, as you get better, you‚Äôll learn to apply map pressure instead of camping.
---
Instead of giving in and insulting back, next time you can just report the messages. The PSN is actually strictly moderated and the other person would likely have gotten a ban or at the very least a warning if it was a first offense. PSN mods also delete the messages when the report is valid and they tell you what consequence the other person is going to face. That‚Äôs my experience at least. I‚Äòm not sure if you should report it now since you threw some punches as well though.
---
I would agree with everything that you said but then I read "spirit is the best designed killer" 
---
throw at windows and pallets
---
I very much like this comment

It was a hard choice between the 2. However I got to disagree that it only works on 2 maps. I've played a lot of scratched mirror myers and it works on all maps as far as I'm concerned (appart from autohaven, but then again, there is barely any killer that works on auto haven) corn maps also get turned from one of the worst maps to one of the best maps. You're movement speed moght be low, but you won't have to waste any time chasing survivors and I have had the best Myers win rate when using scratched mirror, regardless of map
---
Ochido got game banned on ps4
---
If the killer clicks leave game you keep your points / get escape points. If they close the game or disable their internet connection you do not
---
Yeah. I read somewhere it's about the bloodpoints counter or something
---
Starcraft, ow, tf2, cs, dota, quake, civ
---
What else am I missing?
---
Well that is a fucking joke.  
---
Those two games he played were regular stuff, no griefing whatsoever.
---
I'm on xbox and have gotten pretty decent with her. First thing I did was turn my sensitivity up to 100% so I can make flick/quick turn shots. Not everyone is comfortable with that tho so find something that fits for you, but I recommend setting it higher regardless. 
---
I also have a crosshair that I use that is built into my monitor (bUt dAtS hAcKiN'''''). Trust me, it's not cheating at all. It only really helps with mid range shots, but helps regardless. If you have one, you should use it! 
---
Also, watch good huntress players on twitch. Zubat, ScottJund, and RalphFromTheSouth are all amazing huntress players that I watch, and I learned so much from watching them. 
---
Lastly, practice always makes perfect! She takes alot of time to learn, but once you start getting the hang of her, she becomes a blast to play!

Cheers.

Boxed breathing: You don't need to breathe. Thats for the weak. Your rate of breathing is reduced by 10%/20%/30%
---
"Controlling your breaths is simple. Just don't breathe."
---
First impression: First impressions are always important to you. When being chased by the killer, gain 50%/75%/100% more bloodpoints in the boldness category. 
---
"I was never good at introducing myself. But since I'm not in public, why not start now?"
---
Directional awareness: Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability. Any generators, hooks, chests, and totems that you can see with the camera are revealed to you and will be able to see them from across the map. This applies to 1/2/3 items. The perk resets when you initiate a chase with the killer. Does not stack with any other aura reading perk.
---
"I was told I have a good sense of direction. I guess it's time to put that to the test."
---
Improve your chase potential because honestly camping might get you a few more ranks but its lame to do and soon survivors will stomp you if you have no idea how to chase

don't call people "white trash". that's as racist as what the other guy said.

that is really cute:3

But like I'm live for the drag race memes ngl
---
Never forget the times when you die on first hook because the team decided to engage in competitive nosepicking on the opposite side of the map.
---
&gt; no one can escape the tunneling or be chased for a very long time unless the player is completely boosted
---
That's the point..

Or. Maybe it's the power of Dio's offspring?
---
yeah, how about killer add-ons don't get to waste, amirite?
---
Shes one of my favorite killers. Use BBQ and chili, sloppy butcher, Bloodhound, and Nurse's calling.
---
And most importantly practice, practice, practice. 
---
Take a chance and lob a hatchet from a far distance. Very rewarding when you land a hit on an unsuspecting gen rush.
---
ALWAYS reload hatchets before picking up a survivor to hook, just in case of DS or flashlights. If you run out of hatchets during a chase just break off and reload UNLESS you are within ax striking distance. She is shit without her hatchets in a chase. Just use good judgement. 
---
We stan a rank 1 killer.

I thought jenndenise was with that other streamer ? I can‚Äôt think of his name right now but I used to watch him stream and I could have sworn she was dating him and that they lived together did they break up ?
---
If only he didn't complain about not hearing the 'bloodeh footsteps' every two minutes. Otherwise it was a pretty enjoyable run of videos/streams.
---
It‚Äôs a great game but it will take a while for you to get decent at survivor. It is the harder role for new players. 
---
You can play the mode, ‚Äòkill your friends‚Äô to play with just 3 of you.
---
You can Kill Your Friends, but normal queues are random. If you have a three-man, then just survive with friends. 
---
1) we did it yesterday

2) it's not "clean" on purpose, bc look at the original icon.

A witchhunt on twitch should be called a twitchhunt

you‚Äôre giving ochido way too much credit. and noob3 isnt no angel and isnt the reason why people use Nea lmao. not everyone who plays a game knows every youtuber/streamer

Feng Min's skirt was fucked in lobbies. new Spirit's cosmetic misses few pixels near waist. the game has a bunch of spaghetti coding that constantly fucks something up including cosmetics.

If you DC too much after a certain ratio of DC/regular games you get automatically banned for a limited time.
---
After a long time just playing survivor I dived back into killer. I forgot how fun it was! I really like The Pig :)
---
Killer mains overestimate how many toxic survivors there are by a long shot. I play a fair bit of killer and survivor, and I honestly don't see more than 1 toxic survivor every 3-4 games. And how are you supposed to know a survivor is going to be toxic in the lobby when you put on NOED? Fact is, it's the biggest crutch perk in the game by far and the only reason certain people use it is for jokingly toxic builds or because they're total shit and won't get more than 1 kill without it. Beyond the NOED thing though, yeah there's no problem with tunneling toxic survivors and not going further than 10ft from their hook; maybe it'll teach them a lesson.
---
Nope. Its helpful but may put you in a position where you cant play her without it. Which kinda cripples your build options. 
---
Stfu
---
Bullies people, gets his fans to mass harass people, hacks his game, he was banned 4 times on pc, so he moved to console, but back then you couldn‚Äôt be banned on console. 
---
Where do you think he go it?
---
I think it should be this subreddit's responsibility to maintain this post's score at 3 karma
---
Lol. Someone already got banned tho foo. It's for a couple of days but it could be worse. 
---
How dare you do that to Kate 
---
This might be what his design was in the developera heads, but that is not the most effective way to play. With what you say, you pretty much rely on survivors not having any windows or pallers nearby, sometimes it works, but you can still do this with Frank's Mix Tape and have a backup alternative to quickly end the chase if your original strategy doesn't work out
---
Never said he was an angel. At least he has no pedo allegations and his bans were deserved but he understood and knew what he did while Ochido claims it‚Äôs illegal. Like I said not the sole reason but many play her because of Ochido. It‚Äôs not just DBD either. A good example is the Thrall Hood from Ds3. 
---
How do they nerf No Mither
---
I feel like I'll be stuck at "Self Care" for the rest of my life. I'm 20.
---
Yes but bouncing builds up pressure, them mending gives you time to hook a dude, then go for another man and keep up momentum 
---
I think that swf games should be in their own separate clickable icon at the main menu. I get people want to play with their friends but it typically isn't fun for the killer. So I think a killer should be able to choose if they want to go against swf or not at the main menu. 
---
A good non toxic swf team can be a really good challenge but asshole swf really make the game not fun. 
---
I think that, if we include the reporting system actually working on console now, if the devs put in a choice for killers to play with either randoms or swf it would keep the toxicity a lot more down because obviously if the swf choice is full of toxic assholes the killers aren't going to want to go there as much which means more wait times for swf. I understand that this is kind pf punishing to not asshole swf, but it will be a learning experience at first, then it should level out as assholes stop playing or learn their lesson.
---
Being a dick doesn't pay.
---
Its good, but not mandatory, there is an Iron Will to counter it almost fully. You can also use Predator instead of Stridor, it will have pretty much similar effect, but I personally still prefer Stridor. 
---
Also when youre using spirit walk pay attention to grass and how it moves, it will give you a lot of information on the survivors position.
---
Its still only one person. Im kinda curious how things will go down this week. 
---
We do NOT tolerate this behaviour here. If you name and shame another player, be prepared for consequences.
---
No killer main would ever choose the swf option, though.. LoL.. 
---
Every game and sport has people being asses. In tennis there are heated arguments all the time but in football people beat the living shit out of people. Soccer is the same. THERE WAS A WAR OVER SOCCER. That‚Äôs like saying there is a lot of toxicity in Mario party so dbd is fine. A major portion of the toxic behavior (pun intended) is because of streamers. 
---
Removed - Repost
---
Man i wish he people in my flat were quick and quiet 
---
Which, doesn't make him a pedo. As I said, he is an asshole of an assholes, I do not deny that. My main point - there are no legit proofs of him being a pedo. Majority may believe otherwise, but what many say is not always equal truth.
---
The penalties are: wasted time, wasted offerings in this case, zero BP and also losing a pip. But I would recommend losing more pips. Like a Killer. I think they lose two instead of one.  
---
Good, if they wanna exploit then they deserve it
---
You think that was the only person why? Every dbd player doesn't browse reddit. Every player who gets banned doesn't show reddit they got banned.
---
Running both because you're a superior being with a big dick üòé
---
I agree with the drag race memes. We need more of them though 
---
Meg C????? EXCUSE ME???
---
it can disorient you, actually. you'll feel they're near but they're actually by the pallet 5 meters away from you. I wouldn't recommend. only times it really actually helps if someone has Iron Will. but then others will be a bit disorienting.
---
and overall it's a pretty weak perk. I mean it's good but there are way better perks to use. 
---
This is a flat out horrible idea. 
---
it's a bug with latest update. 
---
You don't have to play in a way that satisfies them. Think about it, Survivors never play in a way to satisfy Killers. If they did, we'd see a lot less use of Decisive Strike. Play how you want to, mang.
---
But sadly, if you want a Killer that can actually leave the hook and come back to it quickly enough to catch a hook diver or the guy who got rescued then you need to use either Hillbilly or Nurse. Maybe Legion or Spirit too. 
---
&gt;People really go overboard with ochiido, the guy plays toxic but hes not the reason plenty of people play toxic he just represents that part of the community. 
---
I disagree. A lot of the community is made up of Monkey See Monkey Do exceptional individuals. There is a correlation between what the big streamers do and say and how Survivors (especially at rank 1) behave in the game.

wasn‚Äôt that legion‚Äôs original design? like isn‚Äôt the trailer for the killer literally what you just said?
---
That does make a lot of sense, but i dont think the devs will ever put voice chat in the game.
---
While they're at it, ban people using MLGA to dodge everyone who kills them.
---
I said allegations cause I don‚Äôt remember if the proof. But the fact that it‚Äôs possible worries me. I guess a more firm thing to say would be his witch hunts.
---
I thought you said Marth did it 2 years ago and it was much more impressive than anyone? 
---
Plus Zubat did this 12/13 days into the Rank reset where the ranks are more spilled in the rank pool and the potatoes are at rank 1already and with only the OP killers and the occasional trapper game. SO IMPRESSIVE HMMMM! /s  
---
Tru3 just used Nurse at Rank 2 to 1 and rotated ALL killers until then with Survivors games too, being sniped and known of his build. Yes we all do mistakes but belittling both these people achievements makes no sense.  
---
We could celebrate that streamers are doing this challenge and they understand the things that are broken in the game, come together and make the game better. But all this is, is a fucking hate fest on Tru3 and Zubat doesnt like drama? lies. He loves this kind of shit. 
---
you are full of shit Fujin, its all I have to say. ;)
---
Everyone who gets banned doesn't post on social media ...
---
Just saying this is a stupid way of thinking.
---
Also there's a total of like 8 perks that are worth running on legion; the rest do basically nothing. Just let me use what perks I want q_q
---
&gt;Thy get to see our items
---
You said perks at first, which is what I responded too. Items are a different story. Don't change the goalposts midway through a conversation.
---
&gt;yea your entitlement sorry you can‚Äôt handle someone disagreeing with you over a mutual agree to disagree thing
---
It's entitlement to want to see something hidden (perks for this example) when the other player(s) do not get to see your hidden perks. Why should you get that advantage over the other player? You never answered me. You just stated you want to see perks without them knowing yours. That's not fair and it is entitled.
---
&gt;who hurt you?
---
I'm not even approaching you about high level concepts here. This is stuff a younger child would be able to go over. Why the ad hom?
---
That happened to me before against a Legion. I saved my teammates multiple times and even got the killer's attention so the two who were trying to heal could do so. I had kindered 3 on and just had to sit there on my first hook and watch as they all urban evasion'd away to the other side of the map and left me to die. They just kept pointing at each other and tbagging.
---
I haven't really had a killer yet who outright frustrates me, but I have had multiple occasions where my teammates do annoy me to no end. 
---
Samn Quentin not even a D
---
Im not sure why you are triggered, it at least feels like it. I've been playing Freddy for roughly 700 hours. Im not saying that stacking blocks is bad I use it as a meme when someone says "Freddy is bad" or wants to buff him, I use it as kinda like a "Git Gud". If you are finding that blocks stacking is good, sure go for it, you are the one playing, not me. Here is a post someone made a while back on how to effectively use his power, SPOILER, it is not using Blocks. But if you find they they are working for you sure go for it, but it doesn't hurt to learn how to play a characters Different ways.

Yes, but he got another common pmm skin

MANY people have been reporting him for a pedo. Lots of underage girls usually on discord
---
I mean from what I know he was talking to 16-19 year old girls. harassed them somehow. that's hardly a pedo in my book tbh. a nasty dude for sure. but not a pedo. he solely targeted those but younger than. him because older or more mature females would never talk to him. 
---
It is! So something must've went horribly wrong at BHVR, to result in a pile of hot mess that is the Legion we know. IDK what, but I really hope they get around to fixing it sometime soon.
---
my man really went thru a troll account's post history lmfao
---
Or just streamers who play the game are a good example of those types of players, some streamers are "toxic" like some players are.
---
Wow crab dance 
---
If you name and *shame* another player..
---
Lmao what. People were assholes in Halo and COD back in the day with no streamers being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. People are just generally assholes on the internet and especially in a competitive multiplayer game. Stop blaming streamers for nothing.
---
The game wasn't originally meant to have swf right? I wasn't around for that but are you saying that the killers were so OP that P3 survivors, as an example, were just uber easy and had no advantage? I find that really hard to believe. 
---
I have played against randoms that were P3 and they WERE NOT easy. They weren't Dbags mind you but they were not a cake walk.
---
Yea I understand killers want an easier game and randoms are generally easier because they don't have the truly unfair/borderline cheating advantage of comms
---
And yea that will happen but killers will have things like iridescent heads or example. They won't be defenseless. The whole point of having a swf option is for competitive players which might open a doorway for actual televised tournaments, which brings in more fans and more players. Idk if legit tournaments are being done tbh but I haven't seen any MLG type stuff so far
---
Do you really honestly believe that the competitve base is that small? Truly?
---
Think bigger picture, Brother. That's where I'm at. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry it came off that I was triggered. I just felt like you were telling me how to play Freddy when I have my own playstyle. Everyone has their own playstyle, I just happen to like stacking block addons, but when I‚Äôm out of blocks I use Nancy‚Äôs masterpiece and the Green Dress. 
---
NA LUL
---
I want proximity VC like in F13. 
---
Does that mean it'd be faster if people did multiple gens?
---
No. Just no.

A good huntress can shut down a camp pretty well to but I agree.
---
even if he doesn't go for underage girls specifically, he still pressure girls into sending him stuff and that is not okay, even with adult women. idec about the pedo claims thats why I said predator.
---
Your issue is with reddit mods not bhvr 
---
I wish rules set #2 was just baseline for the pig, and the add-on was changed so that survivors can't see their time left (only hear).
---
I had the funnest match I've ever played as a survivor against The Pig this week. Everyone was being aggressive, the Pig was putting traps on everyone, guarding the last couple gens really well, and eventually got everyone except the last hatch escape. 
---
I messaged them a thanks, but they never responded.
---
Karma is quite an odd thing. Right after I saw I was tagged here and smiled I clicked on a small youtube video with merely ~10k views and Justin Y was there greeting me with another medicore top comment.

Locked - Uncivil behaviour in the comments.
---
ive actually thought about this a lot. hard to remember though.
---
Solitude - you prefer doing things by yoursel. Get a 3/5/10% speed boost for performing actions on your own
---
Hiding in Agony - nobody notices when they have hurt you. After you have been injured, your aura cannot be read by the killer for 30/45/60 seconds.
---
Don't let it get to you - you perform well under pressure, and your friends get inspired. You and your friends receive a 3/5/10 speed boost when in the killers terror radius.
---
Or when they give you a perfect 3 man gen spread and call you a camper for hooking someone close to the gens then patrol the only gens left.
---
For Clown, fogging up the area so nothing is seen, you hear screams, mad laughter, and the sounds of repeated stabbing, slashing, and tearing. The fog goes silent, the fog disappears, and the Clown puts a new finger into his pouch with a giggle. 
---
Honestly there's not much you can do.
---
Or when they give you a perfect 3 gen spread and call you a camper for hooking someone close to the gens then patrol the only gens left.
---
Yeah i agree with both ideas. They can then buff totems if they need to but this brings solo survivors up to swf level. 
---
For Clown, fogging up the area with a bottle thrown straight down so nothing is seen. You hear screams, mad laughter, and the sounds of repeated stabbing, slashing, and tearing. The fog goes silent, the fog disappears, and the Clown puts a new finger into his pouch with a giggle. 
---
Dont just fling hatchets. A good technique is to just hold it and wait, looking at how survivors attempt to dodge then make the call. Holding hatchets also pressure survivors to go into places they dont want to be in.
---
I like it. The kindred thing would definitely close the gap between solo and swf. As for the totems I have always wished that small game gave you a totem count just like how thrill of the hunt does.
---
*calls player white trash after being cruelly insulted, gets called out for "not being much better"* 
---
I'm sorry that comment actually made me lol, just had to point that out. This reddit really is full of a bunch of 4heads sometimes.
---
But yeah man, I know it's pretty messed up situation, but if I were you I would just report his ass on PS4 and move on. Don't let some 12 year old who lost to you in a video game get you down. There will always be more. 
---
Yeah I know, that's why I hate all these tier lists of killer and perks. I always play with what I want, if someone say "Wake Up! is bad", I tell them to fuck off and mind there own business.
---
Killers are meant to protect objectives from survivors, which include gens, unopened exit gates, and hooked survivors.  When the exit gates are opened, the only objective left to protect is the survivor.  They have no other objectives left to patrol to by that point.  Running around like a headless chicken trying to find someone to slap is not effective play.

Or just don't camp period. If you've gotten to the end, and have to camp a survivor, then you're awful and should just take the loss.

Camping shows that you suck so much that you need to be toxic to make sure you don't depip. Just let go of the damn pip and try harder next game.

I am not defending the dude, man. I am genuinely concerned. because I want to know of how the ban system works, I don't understand it. I don't understand why can't they make strict rules so you were sure what not to break. because what happened to him can happen to anyone. because I hate that he got banned for simple fukin toxicity but others are not getting banned for it. it makes me sick, you know? 
---
&gt; since his pc ban he never abused a bug or anything of this kind.
---
He evaded his (you said it yourself) legitimate ban on PC. Ban evading is an instaban on every game I know. 
---
Pretty darn accurate. Some spots are debatable but it‚Äôs basically spot on. 
---
spirit? what about the glass tho
---
idk why you are so toxic
---
You'll fit in great around here tho
---
Toxicity is bad mkay 
---
He exploited bugs in the game as often as he could. He starts witch hunts on players who huwt his feewings, and to top it all off he‚Äôs just a straight up toxic piece of crap. You‚Äôre most likely not going to get banned. 
---
Yep, people want balancing stupid moves around other stupid moves. These type of comments are the reason campers get away with it. Stop being altruistic (autistic) around a shit killer, and stop forcing any other killer to sit on the hook because your ass can't wait to get the unhook and crouches behind the rock next to it ... I won't even mention the ones in chase, yikes.
---
True,sloppy+bloodhound is neat
---
How do you do it
---
he was playing for 7 months on PS4 after his pc ban. hardly an instaban. and as I said so many times already, I haven't seen the rule where you can't switch the platform. 
---
Doesn't work. If you just tap unhook the grab animation will start and then become a normal M1. To make it even weirder. You m1 them and THEN you are still in treatment mode.

God I hate when this happens. Whenever I decide to commit to a generator everyone else is either urban evading in a corner or also commiting to a generator. Yet, when I go to be the altruistic one some Meg just SPURINT BURSTO‚Äôs over and steals my save. 
---
Running cold dirt and the green CD add on got adept first try having played legion twice before really broken
---
This exactly. If you really want it you might as well try to farm with the survivors. 
---
They're angry whenever you face camp them at the end of the match. I also have more times than not at the end of the match whenever I actually have to go AFK that they end up swarming me and I come back and there's two or three of them dancing around me. What do you want? Either just leave, or don't get angry whenever I hook one of you and Stan there
---
It's not useless, and happens whenever you use an item. I absolutely agree that their are much bigger, larger balance issues with the game, but this would be a very fast and easy fix! 
---
ugh. you dislike him so much you can't see my point. I am against injustice and I don't care what kind of person is a victim of it. he can be worst human on the planet, I don't care. I care that it's injustice 
---
Dude posts on Kappa. It's a Kappa thing. Put away your soy and tears of outrage. 
---
But you just know that they won't leave guy on the hook, even if you are Leatherface standing literally near him with Revved up chainsaw, so why bother if survivors will outplay themselves?
---
Don't worry, there's probably just a lot of people busy right now lol.
---
How is freddys best add on a dress, over an iridescent or pill bottle or class photto?
---
Just make it like overwatch, if your in a party you play ranks higher than all of you to help even it out and idk about red ranks
---
ds isn‚Äôt going to be missed by any good player, dribbling only works if you‚Äôre 4 feet or less from the hook and even then is a time sink that doesn‚Äôt matter unless they die on hook because if they‚Äôre unhooked and get downed later they can pop it then 
---
It‚Äôs really not lol. The man was a piece of shit that got banned for breaking the rules. 
---
He hacked in items, he utilized glitch spots, and he ban circumvented. You do those things *which are against the rules* you get banned. 
---
I'm not toxic. but I know people also not toxic getting banned for weirdest shit. 
---
and as I said, he *used to* exploit stuff. over 7 months ago. he stopped. he also doesn't harass anyone anymore. why the ban that states "griefing"?
---
Maybe make baseline version weaker than Kindred 3 and change perk itself to buff baseline version? Here are some of my ideas:
---
* Baseline Kindred only reveals survivors to each other, while perk reveals killer.
---
* Baseline reveals survivors and reveals killer in radius distance within line of sight. Perk reveals killer in larger radius and does not require visual contact (that Insidious Bubba around the corner will get revealed)
---
* Baseline killer reveal is short, and perk adds icon to other survivor's HUD if the hook is covered by terror radius. 
---
Um, says who??? Just because you don‚Äôt see him stream it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt happen. 
---
Solid argument. Honestly this game‚Äôs a mess and impossible to balance for both sides equally. 
---
I called it:
---
&gt; INB4 avalanche of down votes from Survivor Mains spouting the usual Fake News bullshit such as:
---
I know other idiots are going to appear and say the same fucking lies they've been saying since forever. Once again, the perk has zero downsides. Dribbling to hook depends entirely on if the Survivor fucked up and got downed close enough to a hook and a body blocker can easily shut that down. If you honestly miss the skillcheck then you suck dick at playing Survivor. Stop this. 
---
he did them 7 months ago on pc. not the 7 months he played on PS4.

"It is truly an unjust game"
---
Did you run a map offering with it? And this would also take into account your rank. The green stalk add-on or being able to kill survivors is definitely stronger though.
---
There is straight up no counterplay to her. You can't sprint cuz she can pinpoint your exact location. You can't not sprint because she can pinpoint your exact location. She is an invisible, ultra speed killer with no downside. As for the needing a brain thing, I'm a filthy survivor main scrub who can barely scrape rank 10 with killer and I have never had a spirit game where I didn't 4k. Either I'm suddenly a god at killer or she is just stupidly powerful. 
---
In my personal opinion, she is worse for the game than legion. As for the waifu material thing, I'll let you be into whatever you want. 
---
Consider yourself lucky. 
---
Thanks I'll look that over then. :)

**Well This Isn't Exactly Romantic**: It's obvious, that guy with the mask and knife is WAY too into you. Or maybe it's that weird British rugby guy with the mullet? Either way, you'd prefer it if this took a lot longer than it usually does. If the Killer remains in a 16/20/24 meter radius around your hook for over 12 seconds their Terror Radius is increased by 28 meters, ignoring any of the Killer's stealth abilities, and your hook progression slows by 50/75/100%.
---
*"Dumping me* ***on*** *the first date? Really?"*
---
**What's Sleep?**: You're very tired, but that just increases you desire to get things done! All skill checks lose the chance to be great, and the successful skill check bar is reduced by 30%/40%/50%. Additionally you may trigger skill checks while cleansing totems, opening gates, searching chests, and running in a chase. Failing these skillchecks results in you leaving the totem, the gate making a notification for the Killer and losing 10% of it's progress, the progression bar being reset, and you stumbling and being unable to run until hit or for the next 2 seconds. All your action speeds are increased by 9%/12%/15%. **Hex: Ruin** and **Hex: Huntress Lullaby** both effect the user of this perk.

truth
---
I dont agree with your nerfs. Ds needs a nerf i get that. But your ideas are...use ds and you cant use anything else. Or use ds and be injured for the rest of the game. Even deliverance has a time limit. You shouldnt be injured for the whole game. Maybe for like 120 seconds or so
---
mething like that. And your last idea...just remove it. No. Then laurie wouldnt have 3 perks. If anything it would need a rework not just remove it from the whole game. And i play killer a lot. Enduring does counter it. Not heavy counter but still a counter. 
---
Lmfao at people downvoting because it's Legion.

It's great art, well done and thank you for sharing.

Where else would people share their not-so-friendly opinions about Tru3 if they'd get timed out in like a second in his chat, then bullied by his viewers?

Zekeo went straight? The hacker guy who openly mocks the devs?

How about something like a growing song when you get closer, like Michael's in tier 3?

You don't need to try to put down others to try to make yourself feel better dude. Didn't you learn that in grade school?
---
Your point is: a strawman
---
My point is: If he has pronounced weaknesses he should also have pronounced strengths. The bell still exists as a mechanic, so he's not unavoidable or uncounterable by any means. You might say: what if he runs the add on that makes the bell silent? In that case, I'd say he's just as annoying a Huntress running insta down hatchets, or a tombstone tuft of hair Myers. That's just the nature of red add ons.
---
I think it would make him more viable, it just wouldn't make him overpowered or horrible.
---
*Our sex life 
---
I decided not to bring my rank into the equation because it barely matters, but I'm talking about red ranks. I did not run any map offerings, I and did not feel like it was nececary. These are just the addons that work best for me
---
No it isn‚Äôt. It happens once and then it‚Äôs gone and you get s five second stun. If you miss it tough luck. Any decent killer will utilize noed in the time for which they have it. It doesn‚Äôt need a nerf at all. 
---
I play both killer and survivor pretty equally and I can clearly see both perks have their strengths and weaknesses. They‚Äôre both pretty powerful perks. If one gets nerfed so should the other. If one gets buffed so should the other. They balance each other out (assuming every player in a match doesn‚Äôt have ds). 
---
Dude could you be more of a troll? Edge lord over here. 
---
Actually I got some in high school so no, just his sex life. And yours too, I guess?
---
Took me a minute.
---
Still feel like it's far fetched, when I see trapper, dynamite isn't one of the things that pops up in my head
---
Man my boy Quentin always at the bottom of these lists
---
Go on the DBD discord. I don't have a link, but a Google search should give you a link
---
Ah thank you for the insight, that explains a lot! xD And thank you for the compliment as well! :) 
---
A lot of people seem to have an obsession with nerfing perks, in this subreddit. 
---
Just accept the fact that Ds exist. You‚Äôre not the dev of the game.
---
I enjoy playing against the nurse the most since I get such a rush. I can‚Äôt even be mad when I die because I have so much fun playing against her. 
---
On the flip side legion is fkn annoying to play against. So is the doctor since he has more ways to locate survivors than any other killer. 
---
I‚Äôm a pig main, I love playing her. Her cute stun noises make pallet stuns not hurt my soul as much and whenever survivors have RBT‚Äôs in their head they freak out and run around the map trying to get it off, leading to easier downs. 
---
I also like the hag because I set her traps further away from hooked survivors and totems that players would expect so they always run into them 
---
IT'S A SPECIAL KIND OF BULLSHIT THAT IN A MATCH WHERE I DID 2 1/2 GENS &amp; UNHOOKED TEAMMATES 4X, I GET NEITHER THE 17K BLOODPOINTS OR THE PIP I "EARNED" PER POSTMATCH SCREEN BECAUSE THE KILLER DC'D WHEN HE COULDN'T FIND 2 OF THE PEOPLE HE'D SLUGGED &amp; WE EACH HAD LESS THAN 25 SECONDS REMAINING ON OUR BLEEDOUT TIMER.
---
The killer can't see the glitch happen. In his eyes the Nea was just standing in the corner they chainsawed
---
&gt;iridescent
---
Does Freddy have an iridescent? I don't know what Iridescent means, but none of his addons have it in their name.
---
&gt;pill bottle
---
Handy addon to almost guarantee a free hit, but I prefer to deny survivors an escape out of the dream world.
---
&gt;class photto
---
Cool addon, but to have full use out of this addon, you pretty much abandon the person you just put to sleep and without a dress, they'll wake up by the time you get back to them. Also, 2 extra seconds of transition time is a huge downside.
---
The 2 ultra rare addons: the box with pictures makes your obsession start in the dream world. Handy, but only affects the start of the trial and unless you have dying light, this won't help you much.
---
The Red Paint Brush reduces your speed from a 115% killer to a 110% killer, so I have a hard time putting this as best addon
---
I would say I'm shocked that people complain about this, but I've seen it firsthand many times unfortunately. I've even seen someone who was taunting the afk killer by teabagging and not leaving get downed right at the gate and the killer actually got the pickup, the guy misses DS and gets hooked and to top it off, the hatch isn't too far away. Oh. My. God. The babyrage. Luckily the killer just kept responding with lol said gg and left but I'm sure that behavior does wear killers down. I mean, it's so ridiculous to expect a killer to  NOT resort to camping when the fkn gates are open. It's not even a guaranteed kill depending  on the killer. I've gotten plenty of saves as long as my team was coordinated and sometimes I get myself killed for those saves but oh well. 
---
Sounds like a shitty marriage. Don't forget, sexual compatibility is something you should really look for. 
---
Ye seeing as skill checks are kinda vital as long as I had those I would welcome a game mode of no hud.. not knowing who is even injured or dead made it feel scary playing solo. After 1,600 hours it was great to get that again! 
---
HAHA HAHAHA! sniff.
---
I think a lot of killers would stop playing if this happened, no thanks.
---
I mean, Legion was designed in a way that literally removes survivors' mechanics (pallets). I'm also still not a fan of how Nurse turned out to be as she neglects the same exact thing. I feel like many killers released recently have degraded in terms of quality/originality. The recent maps are also not very interesting.  
---
My friends and I run a squad of all Feng Min at least once a day just because it's funny. It's only slightly surprising how often the killer DC's when we join. Glad to see some killers can see the humor in it haha
---
Thats mainly to go trough very hard rock, pickaxes are more common. Also, I feel like dynamite is just too far away from the trapper. I'm all for ideas that involve his ability, but I am not a fan of spawning an item out of nowhere just for a certain mori, also a head exploding seems like too much trouble
---
So what should be done about the unfair imbalance to killers SWF presents?
---
And base kit Kindred would be OP. Anyone who plays SWF would know that. Solo really is fine.
---
Do you want to exit the basement on the first try after going into it? If the answer is yes - don't uncap it. Yes, it sucks, no, I have no idea why is it so. Signed, 144hz monitor owner 
---
I could easily see 200 being legit if they were just addons they dont use often.  But i was thinking of the players with 850-999 of every addon and offering and run ultra-rares and mori's every game
---
i‚Äôve hit rank 1 on both sides, and have the halloween dlc for decisive. The problem is decisive is a 4 second stun that effectively heals you a full health state (dying -&gt; injured) and with any good looper that has any pallets nearby that can turn into an extra 15 for sure and up to an extra 40. if you miss decisive you literally are rank 20. On the other hand noed is a small speed boost and 1 tap ability that is mirrored by other perks (make your choice, rancor) that only occurs for 5-10% of the game and can be purged through farming the dull totems or popping the hex after. additionally killer perks are way better than survivors on average so noed is competing against perks like ruin or bbq or nurses that have effects throughout the game. noed doesn‚Äôt even come into effect if there is a hatch escape while decisive triggers every game in which the survivor is downed (every game the survivor wasnt going to win anyway) including the hatch escape situations. The reason noed is an aids to the game and needs nerfed is because it‚Äôs the only perk that interacts with dull totems and can be used to great effect to gain one surprise kill the killer didn‚Äôt deserve. Decisive operates the same way by giving a survivor a free escape they didn‚Äôt deserve, but has the added effect of being incredibly effective because rather than only cucking 1 out of the 4 survivors have it‚Äôs cucking the one killer. The only reason decisive isn‚Äôt more largely used is because it‚Äôs dlc only, in fact the attempts to make decisive less useful when not the obsession actually irrelevant because of the surprise factor of being able to decisive when not the obsession. 
---
tl:dr decisive and noed both need nerfs because they‚Äôre both strong perks that grant excessively large benefits with little effort or skill, however decisive is better, while noed is more irritating to play against 
---
As someone who plays killer and survivor frequently, swf is not as bad as people say. I hope this doesn't sound like "get gud" but I rarely come across a swf group that gets more than 2 people out.
---
And a larger penalty for killers that DC. At least when a survivor is dumb enough to do it it doesn't make the match end and make everyone lose their offerings.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you even asked for the worst killers. It‚Äôs obvious. Doctor and Legion. On the other hand if you want my 2 cents I have to go with Trapper and Huntress. If you face against a good Huntress or Trapper the feeling of dread (like the dread when the game was first released and everyone hid in lockers) washes over you. Huntress relies on skill and is extremely fun to play. Trapper on the other hand doesn‚Äôt take to much skill but is really fucking hard to master to make him as powerful as billy or Huntress. Several perks completely counter his ability and if you aren‚Äôt paying attention you will never use your power. The satisfaction of landing a hit or trap is great. If I had to choose between the 2 I would say Trapper cause games are much more interesting with him. A good example is when a survivor was crawling to the hatch and I had no choice except to step through my traps to get to him before he could get in. I ended up losing but damn was it tense. Another story is when I was half blinded when picking someone up and stepped in to my own trap. Huntress just doesn‚Äôt have those crazy moments other than snipes and hits through windows or stuff like that.
---
There‚Äôs no DS/NOED = OP, the killer is Nea, is camping bannable? (or other super basic questions), or what streamer is best/worst ‚Äúnearleh‚Äù posts.
---
Nurse... People who play as it deserve toxic survivors team. 
---
I love going up against a nurse. It's the only killer that makes me think about my juking. Myers is prob the scariest if he stays in tier 3. Leatherface will make me contemplate a dc. 98% of them have the same playstyle and it's just annoying to go up against. Doctor is a close second but he wont make me dc, maybe suicide depending on how my teammates play.
---
Same. I only get pissed if they camp from the get go or gens aren't done
---
It's not about playing with your friends, and anybody who says so is either being really thick, or is blatantly avoiding what everyone knows is the real issue: SWF commonly uses voice comms.
---
Why would having a totem counter stop killers playing lol? 
---
The only way for kindred to be baseline is to buff killer to the level that allows them to deal with swf and I don't think that is even possible to get done correctly.
---
‚ÄúScout‚Äôs honor‚Äù
---
He‚Äôs not as weak as Freddy and you can see a sort of foggy figure when he moves while he‚Äôs invisible and it takes a second to come out of it but his ability lets you get the drop on people pretty well
---
"Most killer mains just want easy, unfair, and fast games." Found the survivor main.
---
I kinda wish there were more tombstone Myers out there for this reason. I make it a point to try to always say gg to the killer but then I'll think, "what's taking so long?!", and when I click spectate I see some idjit pointing and teabagging at the gate but as soon as the killer take a step forward, they run in and do it some more until they are forced out. It's so obnoxious!

Im a red rank killer on console and i really dont mind DS. I usually try and get them to use it on me in a shitty area for them to get out of and then just tunnel them back down. I mean they only get it once and then they're fucked. I honestly see it as a waste of a perk that just buys them a tiny bit more time before i beat their  cheeks again

Freddy's best add-on is probably Nancy's Masterpiece.

Watching Ochido beg on Mcote‚Äôs stream is the sugar in my coffee this morning

I‚Äôve never played SWF comms until about two days ago and it‚Äôs totally changed my perspective. Anyone who says SWF isn‚Äôt a big advantage is being disingenuous. The sheer amount of information you gather and relay and coordination you do when in SWF is wild, even when you don‚Äôt go in with the explicit intention of using a lot of coordination 
---
I hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as ‚Äúget gud‚Äù but I rarely don‚Äôt escape unless I say fuck it and attempt more galaxy brain plays than I should
---
Frankly, the people complaining that solo is too hard probably never learned how to play properly and instead learned via SWF crutch

PRAISE DEATH METAL JESUS!

Holy shit why so many reply‚Äôs?

I like him because he's really positive and just generally seems to have fun win or lose. Plus I've learned a lot by watching him.

When you see a Nea squad all named the same thing then you know... it‚Äôs not going to be a fun game

Wtf Reddit just died sorry about that. XD

Na what about Susie legion skin tho ???

This is just all my personal opinion though I‚Äôm not a master of the meta or anything

Borrowed Time only takes affect if you unhook within the killer's terror radius
---
You just lost all credibility agreeing with that stupid comment.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you can refrain yourself from spending it all every match. 
---
Wow good job! I know a lot of people joke about her being thicc but she gives me the creeps. It's the cut up parts and the way she twitches. I kinda wish I had never seen the waluigi meme because that's all I hear now when I play with her, but oh well! c:
---
Very nice art piece! &lt;3
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content
---
No comment about the commodious toolbox + instructions + scraps?
---
Alright, jokes aside, there is a lot of counterplay - though the fact that you were playing against rank 10 survivors probably meant you didn't see a lot of that.  
---
 Run back on your trail as soon as she haunts. Bait out her ability, walk behind something, then run back when she comes out. Be so unpredictable (including purposely running tiles wrong) that she can't even use her haunt or she'll lose you, making her a slow M1 killer. Actually use stealth because she's a killer with good chase. Basically play like you'd play vs. a less mobile Nurse that's harder to track.
---
As you can see, this is literally all mindgames - her ability makes it so that whomever reads their opponent better, wins the chase. That's all it does. And the fact that you main survivor, means you can probably read them pretty well. But the counterplay is still there.
---
That's literally the opposite of what you should do lol. If you clump up, everyone is in range to get hit by Legion's frenzy. 3 people will have to waste time mending up and maybe healing too while another person is being chased, leading to no gens being done for that time period. Also speed efficiency decreases the more people you have on a gen. You'd get more total charges needed done faster with 4 survivors working on 4 different gens separately than 4 survivors working on the same generator one at a time
---
I get not reading chat but to go to the extent of spamming my steam profile is  extremely toxic.
---
And I did. The killer just hit them right after I get them off the hook. 
---
So, Freddy with no lullaby, then?
---
The first one for the shape looks a lot like the one from the pig imo
---
That's definitely a bug then
---
He did. Youtube started to shut down channels that promoted hacking, so now he streams legit.

But they have to make an offering to the entity to mori people.

&gt;Tru3Ta1ent did the same challenge and it took him many days to do that. It was kinda emberassing and hard to watch because he made so many mistakes and always blamed the survivors and game unbalances. Especially when he exclusively played nurse at the end he failed so many easy blinks, missplayed heavily and depip/blackpipped because of that but it was always the survivor's fault.
---
I understand your point of view, and congrats to ZubatLEL! But I think you should take a look about these facts:   
---
\- ZubatLEL did it with only Killers.   
---
\- The game is unbalanced. It's a fact. You would be annoyed with it as well if you would do this challenge. We can see that Tru3 did some mistakes. He was stressed. I would be stressed.   
---
\- Nurse is hard even when you do it without perks. Addons doesn't matter at her I think she is strong. He could do it with Legion but he didn't because it IS unbalanced. At least Nurse has more counterplays.   
---
\- He did this challenge right after reset. Nobody were on higher ranks sometimes he had to wait longer queues or purposely depip/1 pip.   
---
\- Tru3 didn't mean to make a speedrun from it. So time is I think doesn't matter in this case.   
---
\- Instead of making others look worse you should enjoy both content. I don't have any problem with ZubatLEL but as I read these comments it feels like people judging too harshly others. 
---
He could buy another PC and use a VPN if he really wanted to play.
---
Haha, I tought of it myself when writing that, however, I feel like michael makes up for it. Out of all michaels addons, I feel like Scratched Mirror is the most usefull one. However, I can't deny that this takes away from his chase potential and pretty much makes you rely on catching survivors by surprise
---
Definitely, I feel like a Trapper buff is gonna be high priority after chapter 11 and Freddy. Doctor is fun for the killer (unless you don‚Äôt like his power just being m1 and m2) but he just isn‚Äôt fun for survivors. A bad killer can do fairly well with Doctor. I still have no idea why he is considered ‚Äúhard‚Äù difficulty though.
---
Okay 
---
I am still undecided about Nurse. On one hand, juking her whole blink chain is one of the most satisfying things in DBD, but on the other, she's a killer who bypasses the main line of security that the survivors have - and overcoming her massive advantage is why it feels so rewarding, IMO. 
---
That's reasonable! Glad you finally figured it out. Don't worry, I have patience dealing with people who have more difficulty than others in processing basic concepts. Keep at it kiddo!
---
You know the Wraith's bell exists right?
---
Spirit with prayer beads can pop up out of nowhere, with no warning, and deliver a blow, then use the good chase potential on her power to do it again and end a chase fast. Wraith on the other hand, still needs to ring his bell, and be slowed the whole time he is doing that, and if he wants to recloak, do that again and repeat the process. The counterplay, like the counterplay to Freddy, is his weakness in the chase. That's his weakness. But the ringing of the bell also gives ample indication of his presence, enough to sprint burst to a window, pallet, or attempt to outplay him.
---
Wow these are actually badass! Very good job!
---
Or just don‚Äôt use self care. If you‚Äôve gotten hit, and have to heal, then you‚Äôre awful and should just take the loss.
---
Using self care shows that you suck so much that you can‚Äôt use teamwork to make sure you don‚Äôt depip. Just let go of the damn pip and they harder next game.
---
~~~~~
---
Camping is part of the game, even the devs have said they condone it. If you don‚Äôt like that, either stop playing the game or play with friends who run Borrowed Time. Killers who camp on the first hook are assholes, in this context you‚Äôre just trash.
---
Dedicated servers will fix this for survivor.  Killers still get the worst end of the deal when it happens to them
---
Hope is fun. One time the killer asked me why I suddenly turned in to sonic endgame lol. Apparently not many people use it. 
---
Or maybe we could just be a healthy community filled with respect and that just wants to play a game that we love. But who am I?
---
Or just don't get caught as a survivor. If you've gotten to the end and have been caught out by the killer, then you're awful and should just take the loss.
---
Just let go of the damn pip and try harder next game.
---
bless mathieu, he's such a nice guy, his response was so kind "this is my day off".  You can tell he doesn't want to deal with it lol
---
It is. Just because a horde of assholes keep insisting that something is true doesn't make it so. Facts are facts and it's obvious you live in fantasy land. 
---
&gt; Twitch TOS also state badmouthing streamers outside of Twitch is bannable Scott.
---
Not the best choice of words when he started this by randomly calling us out and badmouthing us outside of Twitch 
---
This is my favorite comment section ever
---
Sure its different, its definitely worse. The survivors can just finish up and leave, it sucks for the one left behind, but 3 of 4 are happy. But then again, you just need to get better, put pressure on the killer and not get trapped there to begin with. There are plenty of tools for that. Meanwhile the killer has a huge map to cover to find a single troll hiding in some dark out of the way corner.
---
This dude speaks the truth and gets down voted. Typical behavior for this sub. 
---
Ok?
---
? I'm memeing this dude's stupid comment, I don't think Zubat's achievement was any more impressive, simply because ranking up is NOT hard. I mean 20-1 with 1 loss is pretty good, but I do not think that it still is something to celebrate over. 
---
While I think Zubat is a better player than Marth, I consider the Iron-challenge way more impressive because the game was genuinely imbalanced when he did those.
---
Yeah 200 bux on Paypal
---
&gt; Also never said that swf isn't advantageous. You like to misquote me don't you?
---
And I never said that I have trouble with SWF (unless I play naked. I struggle with that), yet your initial reply indicated that I do. I'm purely talking about mechanics, but all of your comments were centered around personal skill.
---
&gt; And give me a break... "Mirror your language" üòÇ
---
Are you just going to blatantly lie now?
---
Me:
---
&gt; I hope this doesn‚Äôt come across as ‚Äúget gud‚Äù but I rarely don‚Äôt escape unless I say fuck it and attempt more galaxy brain plays than I should
---
You, in the previous comment:
---
&gt; I hope this doesn't sound like "get gud" but I rarely come across a swf group that gets more than 2 people out.
---
I can't understand people DC'ing like that, for real. It's usually SWF and they can be toxic? Yes, but sometimes it's just people wanting to have fun! It's harder to keep track of hooks during the match, but I still think it's pretty funny when it happens. In this case they even had the same name, so it really cracked me up
---
200 pokedollars on paypal
---
That's cool if you're playing Billy and are literally flying all over the map, other killers cannot allow themselves to put so much space between themselves and survivors.
---
do you play with headphones? sound is big thing when it comes to chasing/finding survivors
---
I don‚Äôt think this is necessary. Firstly, this is a bit excessive. Restricting certain perks would be wayyyy too OP for killers and would break the game even more. Secondly, I don‚Äôt think we need to nerf SWF by making them unable to use perks or use anything. I think we need to limit the amount of info they can get. We just got the killer hidden load out change which is great and I think we need more of this. Limit the amount of info they can get, because if one person knows they all know. Right now, the biggest issue is if one person finds a totem, they all know where it is. Communication is the biggest reason why SWF is powerful, and I have no clue how to fix that. Maybe make it so hex totems Respawn after a certain amount of time, like 90 seconds. Perks like Devour Hope that are based on tokens Respawn with 0 tokens or something. Haunted Ground, I‚Äôm not sure. Make it so the totems Respawn in different locations as well, so survivor‚Äôs can‚Äôt just camp the totems. I have no clue. 
---
You can literally sit there and shock them while they attempt to unhook. You can't perform actions for 1-2 seconds after being shocked.
---
You don't even need to M1 anyone.
---
It can't be a hack, or at least I doubt it. You, as the killer, are the server host. If this happened, your game bugged out.
---
This happened to me and the killer thought i was afk and my teammates bullied me post game
---
Lol now you're blaming the victim haha. 
---
Or just don't go out in skimpy clothing. If you're in a bad location and get raped then you were just dressed slutty and should deal with it.
---
Yikes dude. Get a life and learn to play.
---
&gt;Freddy
---
&gt;kill
---
hmmm
---
&gt; The whole "get gud" was meant for killers, not saying you need to be better at swf.
---
I know that. I, as killer, do not have trouble with SWF. You were implying that I do. Again, it does not matter if you and your friends don't get out as SWF. It does not matter whether I have trouble with SWF or not. It is objectively true, in a game play mechanics sense, that SWF offers a huge advantage outside of standard game mechanics. That's literally all I was saying. The reason I brought that up is because it's so odd to me that people perceive the balance issue being between solo and SWF when that isn't an issue.
---
&gt; And yes, thanks for showing me exactly how you mirrored my language. Many people call that mocking.
---
Again, you need to do some self reflection.
---
My favorite real survivor build is Detective's Hunch, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and either Urban or Lightweight.
---
My favorite meme survivor build is Sabo, Breakdown, and No Mither. I'm not mean enough to use it anywhere but KYF, but if all four survivors do it it's hilarious.
---
Everyone hating on my guy Quentin. He has the best P3 in the game though, change my mind.
---
Lol now you're blaming the victim haha.
---
~~~~~~~
---
I don't care if the devs said it's fine, it's still a dick move, and still toxic. If you have to camp the final survivor because you've failed at killing a single one, you're just awful at the game. 
---
I get it ... and judging from your reply you get griefed a lot. Toxic survivors love to grief shitty killers.  It happens ... there are plenty of YouTube videos that can help you play better. 
---
Himself, yes, the reverse Ivory mori

Bruh it was a shitty communism joke I wasn‚Äôt calling anyone out. Also r/ihavesex.

It's to make the grind to R1 more interesting. The games aren't going to be as good since the other players aren't that great, so instead streamers add something to keep their viewers entertained.

It's not my fault you are bad at the game. Just don't get caught.
---
Ya I dunno, bit of a butterface...
---
Myers is one of my favourites, as or against. Even in his babby form, he's terrifying! Repairing a gen in the middle of the cornfield, him just showing up outta nowhere to jumpscare the fuck outta me! And the tier-up mechanic actually makes him a credible threat instead of some goof in the distance. Also, gotta respect his aesthetic- no nonsense, a big, masked guy with a big knife, kinda refreshing break from all the supernatural stuff.
---
Wow, awesome play negated by the games awful broken bs.  My condolences. 
---
I was wondering if this was the case.
---
I always have. I think the main issue is the frame rate cause trying to hit juking survivors is awful too.
---
that number seems familiar

That‚Äôs a lot of words to confirm what I already said. It‚Äôs sad you actually believe false accusations are that prevalent, but that‚Äôs your choice. I hope you educate yourself more someday.
---
I think wraith‚Äôs terror radius is fucked as well,he‚Äôs he only killer I play and sometimes I uncloak and people seem to not get alarmed even though I‚Äôm very close,allowing me to grab from gens
---
Yes but that‚Äôs not the way to play legion
---
Never said the video was a great video in of itself, simply listing it as a piece of evidence to the accusation which eventually does deliver itself within the video. You can also look in the comments for ScottJund and Noob3 which also back the claim of pedophillia.
---
Might not be safe but you could‚Äôve left a long time before EW3 instead of trying to hide behind the truck...right? 
---
Why do you type so edgy.

There are multiple comments explaining it in the thread. Please read them before you make yourself look like an idiot. &lt;3

That sounds heartwarming lol

Great song selection.

I love bloodhound,sloppy butcher,NOED and enduring

First, I wasn't interested about dead by daylight. I saw on the YouTube in Teo funny moments from dbd. It was looking good but I knew this is not for me bcs none of my friends wasn't interested into this. Later I saw stream about DBD from Sovietwomble. It was so funny but still I was thinking this is not buying for. 
---
Once the time I saw Ochido channel. I started to watch his funny moments and i saw so many tactics how to play juke etc. I wasn't watching his streams only what i watched it "epic escape from face camping bubba". So thanks to him I finally buy it.
---
Finding that spot in the corn field where u can stalk the survivor but neither of you can see each other üòÇ
---
welp the camping/tunneling narrative has been demolished 
---
losing your hex 3 minutes into the match a little over 50 percent of the time isn't terrible. 
---
You are the idiot here. Because you made a mistake and get angry over people correcting you.
---
Wow never knew that. That‚Äôs cool! Gonna go look up which one.
---
&gt;we should give survivors more information like number of totems
---
&gt;and kindred
---
I do like the idea of killers getting some kind of buff when survivors do, but, I am not a fan of this idea. The totem counter should defenitely come into play but I don't  like the tought of one of my favorite perks to run (both with SWF and without) to just become part of the base survivor kit
---
This is a really infuriating bug that needs sorting out.
---
Don't forget PS4_and_Ipad_Lover commenting on everything that makes fun of survivors and says "Killers do x" 
---
Just make DS obsession only. Plain and simple. I personally can live with a single DS user. But when survivor stabs me without any way to know that they had DS ready, this is bullshit. Yeah, I know, this will hurt random teams more than it will hurt SWF, so this change is bad. For now. When we get dedicated servers, devs will probably make some changes to UI and lobbies. They can add ability for survivors to see loadouts of each other. Then this type of DS nerf will be good to go.
---
And if we need an immediate solution, introduce special marks in bottom left panel that indicate all survivors (including obsession) who have active DS. To both killer and survivors. 
---
Yea it‚Äôs usually the random teammates not the killer. Also no0b3 seems to think healing against legion is pointless just fyi, idk if his opinion matters to you tho ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And if we need an immediate solution, introduce special marks in bottom left panel that indicate all survivors (including obsession) who have active DS. To both killer and survivors. You can hit the killer, but the killer knows you can hit him and plan accordingly. 
---
I want to say something but it will make him
---
angry and I don't want to be banned 
---
In fact I do! Like I mentioned, Nurse‚Äôs calling is very good on her because when crouched you look like a survivor and have no TR so you can easily sneak up on people and ambush them. 
---
Standard perks are good on her like Ruin, BBQ, and Overcharge. But, just like most killers, suffers from loops and pallets, so I recommend standard chase perks. Bamboozle and Enduring are probably my go-to perks. 
---
However, my absolute FAVORITE perk on her is Shadowborn. Increased FOV allows you to see more while crouched, which is great because you can‚Äôt see much while crouched. 
---
Plaid Flannel.
---
"Golden experience Requiem"
---
Because dead hard basically dodges one hit or get you a little momentum to reach a window or pallet loop. Adrenaline essentially saves your butt at endgame if you are in a chase. Dead hard is useful however adrenalines benefits are huge if it works right

A change like adding baseline Kindred would also entice killers to use Third Seal more often, as it could negate the aura reading for everybody else. 
---
Spam much?
---
0-0 Well, that tells me a lot about how stuff is moderated here then. 
---
This has happened to me 4 or 5 times today, I didn't go for the chest, just the unhook in the basement trying to be a good, altruistic, team mate.
---
This is what happens when you are nice to people.
---
He's both, with certain add-ons and abusing the mechanics for no counter play he's op, but if you try to have fun and just use his ability with ok add-ons he's weak. He is also pretty much unfixable with how he is cause he's in such a fragile state that tweaking numbers will drastic throw him off balance.
---
Hes not very good, people hate him because he wins every single chase hes in as his power is uncounterable. However it takes him so long to down one person that he has no map pressure. Hes weak but awful to go against
---
Well... Wasn't expecting to see any of that today, escuse me while I throw myself in a tub of bleach
---
"He insults people, QUITE FREQUENTLY." There is your lie.

Mastermind: Your ability to think of any and all possibilities, despite their probabilities, prepare you in a battle of wits.  While in a chase and escaping the killers LOS, you can read the killers aura when they change directions 3/4/5 times or 4/6/8 seconds (whichever happens first).  Causes the *Exhausted* status effect for 60/50/40 seconds.  While *Mastermind* is in effect, you move 4%/3%/2% slower cause fat.
---
"You must have contingency plans upon contingency plans upon contingency plans.  That way, you are never surprised".
---
Scrutiny:  You strive for perfection in all things that you do and adore the pressure.  Dull totem and hex totem cleansing speeds while not in killers terror radius increases by 1%/2%/3%.  Dull totem cleansing speed while in killers terror radius increases by 4%/5%/6%.  Hex totem cleansing speed while in killers terror radius increases by 6%/8%/10%.
---
"The stress and added pressure makes mundane and boring tasks more exciting don't you think?"
---
Dominance:  Your observant ways allows you insight over others and allow you to assert your will.  For each 15 seconds you are standing with the Killer terror radius and not in chase, you gain a token up to a maximum of 1/2/3 tokens.  When *Dominance* has at least 1 token and while performing a vault action, you force the entity to block that vault location to killers for 8/12/16 seconds.  Only 1 vault location may be blocked in this way at any time.  *This perk cancels out Bamboozle if the killer has the perk and the survivor vaults a window and uses a token first*
---
"The trick is to give the illusion of choice while guiding them to the path that you want"

You‚Äôve obviously never played with old billy. He was one of the funnest killers to verse and there was actual mind games to be played. Now his hit box is the size of the map and offers the killer less room to show his skill. 
---
My friend, you clearly don't know Freddy. 
---
Nancy's Masterpiece (green drawing) is hands down the best addon. Blue (green) dress is also worse than the (yellow) dress. 
---
Class photo is definitely the runner up for strongest, but usually only when combined with a range addon. 
---
Lol
---
Not in red ranks
---
How is Blue dress worse than the Green dress?
---
Not nice sportsmanship. I'm new.  Don't be an ass.
---
He could maybe have a slight black fog or more wind or something. Just running from him blindly is a bit much. 
---
He can only see you in his terror radius while asleep? Thanks! 
---
Not nice sportsmanship. I'm new.  Don't be like that
---
What I think you're realising is that you and him effectively do the same thing 
---
Fact: the devs admitted in a stream that the perk was OP. 
---
Fact: Survivors can win games without any perks or items. 
---
This is a fact proven multiple times over in the ill-fated E-Sports tournament and Marth's fuccboi squad. So with that in mind, that Survivors can get all the gens done in under 5 minutes and lose maybe - at best - 1 or 2 Survivors then why in God's Balls do they need a perk that lets them get away for free and has zero downsides?
---
Denying facts means you live in your own reality. It's as simple as that you goddamn autist.

Impressive :^)

And Im not trying to be nice, Nurse doesn't need any positive changes to her, it takes like 10 hours to get the blinks down, just practice.

Is it that long? Seems like everyone wants him tweaked a bit. It would be cool if he was even a bit of a fog or wind. 
---
Obnoxious and toxic content creator, watch any single video of his and you‚Äôll have seen most of his content he can offer. Obnoxious earrape over EBIG gameplay that he can rehash over and over without tiring his relatively young fan base. Truly the worst kind of youtuber 
---
Hey fuckface, I main Billy. The hitbox is fine aside from the (as mentioned) phantom hit glitch that negatively effects him. 
---
&gt; Now his hit box is the size of the map 
---
It's time to shut the fuck up now because it's incredibly obvious that you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. And 9 times out of 10 Survivors got hit with the chainsaw because they got greedy and just didn't throw down the pallet sooner. 
---
Lol I mean I have a blast playing as legion. He‚Äôs fast as fuck. Also if you don‚Äôt get found and try for stealth as a survivor he‚Äôs not that hard either. But the glitches that came with his update are still not really fixed which is a pain in the ass
---
Well no one wants to leave their teammates behind so of course theyre gonna try. Youd probably feel bad if it was you on that hook and no even tried to save you.
---
What? Where you quoting this from ? 
---
I just said that you have used Noed not seriously so technically Tru3 was not lying or badmouthing you. He also apologised for said tweet because he did not know context of when Noed was used. 
---
Noed is a bad perk, like DS. But I am not on about that. I am on the fact that you made this about hating on Tru3 instead of congratulating both on doing this challenge. 
---
He mentioned that no one should compare killers and that all streamers in this game are very good players, he has also said that theres no best player, theres several very good players. 
---
And yes Noed makes anyone a bad killer as it teaches them to rely on noed to actually ‚Äúwin‚Äù. 
---
You have used Noed on your reddit killer and negascott runs. And Zubat has used noed at viewers request, that was not a lie and that was not badmouthing you since he did not know the actual context. You, Zubat and Tru3 are all very good players with knowledge of the game. 
---
We are all human including you, please act your age and learn to respect a fellow content creator. He did a mistake on that tweet and at least owned up to it. No need to drag it on a hate campaign. It only shows that you are petty and unprofessional about this. 
---
The devs said to don't report dcs.
---
Kate at that level? Clown not in top tier?
---
Blonde Redhead has decent songs other than just Evil Morty Theme. 
---
Maybe im in the minority but most of my camps dont go like this. Ill loop the killer a few gens usually when im not being a shitter and get camped when theres like 1 or 2 gens left. Then if i say in chat why did you camp me the killers just usually say oh well theres only 2 gens why would i let you go :/ sucks but i mean what can you do.

Your idea is dumb and not going to happen. Get over it crybaby, and while you‚Äôre at it, grow up.

So, you don't dispute anything and just call me "toxic" like a true soyboy.

Again, I don't know why or how "Yikes" and "toxic" became catchphrases for soyboys but it somehow did. The NPC meme was right on the money. 
---
There's an addon called Plaid Flannel that shows you where the blink will take you. Honestly it's better to just continue using her and learning on your own
---
I run unlimited evil with in 3 on Myers, that is league's worse than a 1 use addon and slower movement speed
---
You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs whining over ds like a child kiddo. Methinks you‚Äôre just a bad killer. 
---
It's not a tattoo OP is a fraud
---
Hes just a broken unfun mess of a killer. Don't waste your money on him, hes not fun to play as or against.
---
Idk I took it as a joke and it did make me laugh
---
I just have my teammates pull me and then make  a wall like they're apart of the trump administration
---
Its pretty easy to 3 gen lock on certain maps though. I see a lot of trappers set up this strategy and its annoying :/
---
Well I mean, just like with pallet location perk, it helps to teach you....
---
three survivors dc'ed right when the match started one after the other (swf maybe?) so i was working on the gen i spawned next to expecting to die until Michael found me. cue the farming and runarounds we did before getting that spicy mori once the gates were open

If Rank1 is what your aiming for, then you might want to switch. I spammed Huntress until about rank 5 before i switched to Ataxic Nurse for Rank1 (butwhatdoesthatmatteranyways). I would use Ruin instead of Lullaby but the build is good my guy. Getting past skill walls may take just sheer hours or game knowledge but you might be able to vibe with a killer you've yet to try.
---
This is the part where you DC because you already know this team is way too coordinated.
---
Like I said, that's the entire point to Freddy being invisible. 
---
&gt;Yes, he can see you forever until you get into a locker (why would you do that?) or wake up somehow, if you're **outside** of his terror radius and you're asleep.
---
I said *outside* of his terror radius and asleep, not inside. He can see you from across the map if you're asleep.
---
when killers stop camping
---
I mean he does. He sings a "These survivors are terrible" song pretty frequently, even if jokingly. I really dont' wanna scour all of his VODS but you have to have seen it too?
---
I stay at rank 1 all the time, bud. 
---
I didn't realize I need Legacy skins in order to earn the approval of random fuccbois. Your argument now consists of:
---
"You haven't been playing the game since day 1 so you don't get to have an opinion that matters REEE!"
---
Some say he looped him till his kids grew up
---
Dude your suggested nerfs are stupid. Like they‚Äôre REALLY dumb. Second you‚Äôre a funny guy if you think the devs would listen to you anyways. Third the fact that you‚Äôre so insecure that you have to insult me just reveals how childish you are. Again I say, grow up. 
---
Yep, pretty much.
---
Actually it's husband material, excuse me pls. ;)
---
My confusion is when I get tunneled when I‚Äôm wearing a reverse bear trap. I‚Äôm like why? Lol. 
---
I see, thanks for the data
---
I've been playing for just over 2 months now and hit Rank 1 survivor twice. At first I thought it was hard, but really that was just struggling to find a game for 5 minutes and hoping to have at least 1 other person with common sense. Stick 2 gens, run a killer around for a bit and you've got Rank 1 in a few days.
---
Thank you soo much but I can't take the credit like I said I don't know who the artist is but thank you anyway 
---
Legions in a pretty weird place. They're not OP (unless you run certain add-ons) but they are annoying to go against. Survivors don't like them because you can't really "mind game" the legion like you can with other killers. Pallets, windows, legion can pretty much counter all of that with their ability to fast vault. Nurse can negate these types of things too, but its a lot harder and requires practice and even then it can still be juked. Then there's the deep wound effect. If a competent Legion player hits you with the deep wounds status effect; you're pretty much already dead. If you get hit with the deep wound status effect, you have to stop and mend, which gives the legion time to catch up to you, which means you have to get away again, and then you have to mend again, which gives the legion time to catch up to you again, and so on and so forth until the legion either hits you or the deep wound timer runs out. 
---
On the opposite side of the spectrum, killers don't like legion because legions not a very effective killer compared to other killers. Yes, legion is very difficult to lose in a chase but chases with legion take forever. If survivors aren't screwing around and know what they're doing then they can easily get a gen done in the time it takes for legion to down one survivor. Compare that with other killers: Myers, Billy, and Leatherface can all end a chase in seconds. Huntress can down survivors from long range and I've already touched on this before but if you're good with nurse, there's really no reason to play legion. Basically, If you're good with any of the top tier killers there's really no reason to play legion if you're looking to win. 
---
Me personally, I like legion. I like they're aesthetics and I like the idea of the super agile killer BHVR wanted legion to be. I like the idea, I just don't like the way it was executed. 
---
I never understand why people call others trash for using a perk, please clarify how using noed makes you a trash killer

If you want to know the situation in the specific game where they were bashing me for using noed, I had one slugged, one hooked, and one dead, and the other dude finished the final gen so he didn't have exit gates open, so lets assume I didn't have noed, I could've easily got the first hit in because the gen was right next to where I was, then what? He can't unhook the survivor otherwise I down him then the other person maybe has a 2 second lead in an area where all the pallets are burned, and same goes for the slugged person.
---
Because in end game the killer probably already knows you have dead hard so they will wait for you to burn it and down you. Adrenaline is basically 2 sprint bursts, unless noed, you get the first burst from adrenaline and then another burst if the killer hits you. I like running both because they are great for mid game then end game. Lately though I have dropped dead hard and added on hope cuz it‚Äôs fun. 
---
More pips is an incentive, not a punishment.
---
Did Requiem get you or something?
---
That's one hell of a killer perk.
---
woop woop 
---
i hear the sound of the POLICE
---
Yup this has happened countless times when setting the controller down while waiting in the lobby 
---
I'd put Trapper a little bit higher, but i agree overall.
---
Why? And in which way? Am I missing something?
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking, someone would‚Äôve taken a hit but it would be considerably less of a disaster than what happened 
---
the same guy banning people for the exploit LOL
---
BINGO! 
---
Oops sorry I didn‚Äôt see the comment xD
---
Sculpted it up then covered with plaster strips. Added a couple layers of woodglue, 3 different base colors, then did some shading, weathering and mixed acrylics to look like blood :3 I then added net on the insides of the mask (that is removable) and cut apart a wig. Cut up tiny bits of wefts and live-streamed when I hotglued all the pieces of wefts on the back of the head. Started at the bottom and went up. It was very fun actually! :D
---
Every killers nightmare
---
unrelenting
---
OOF
---
Why is laurie above meg?
---
Are you into chest-height trousers?
---
last year i got into d&amp;d for the first time and its become one of my main hobbies now, and dead by daylight is one of my favorite games too so i absolutely adore this! i think you really nailed the classes and races too!
---
And before anyone says, no. It was not huntress lullaby. I checked afterwards.
---
This actually happens often for me too, appealing to the psycho killers humanity is a viable strategy lmao
---
Currently using my K70 ability to macro. 
---
Macro to wiggle by holding the grave key.
---
Macro to struggle.
---
Easy game easy life. 
---
Wait the glitch can work with goddamn offerings... how the fuck 
---
Thank god, it took long enough.
---
thats been an issue before the 2.5 update, i've run into it more playing against the doctor.
---
the skills check disappears mid circle and i'm pretty useless the rest of the game
---
similar to the no mending bug option 
---
The fact that you called the killer ‚Äúthe monster‚Äù upset me more than you sandbagging that dude
---
But then I wouldn't have seen the No Mither combo and laughed for a while before actually focusing on the game-- All worth it
---
You are the survivor all of us killers love to play against. Good sports, positive attitute and willing to blame yourself before trash talking the killer.
---
"And this is my other brother, David."
---
This only happened on that specific gen. It didn't happen until I revisited it later in the match. It wasn't doc either it was Mikey. Just before this clip he scared the shit out of me and a meg.
---
I don't like Meg that much, but even I can see she shouldn't be that low. Like around Feng or something
---
Goooooodddd loops, gg
---
Ideally your team would make sure this didnt happen. The survivors are going to pop the first 2 gens 90% of the time so if they just make sure not two dont right next to each other this wont happen. you are right though this is a very strong tactic if given the opportunity exploit as killer.
---
So I found out today that Noob3 uses Dead Hard and Balanced. Fungoose uses it as well.
---
It just so happens I'm running perks that some of the most informed players(with 5000+ hours) are using and it's working well for me too. 
---
If you don't try it you won't know. 
---
Depends on how you buff the killer, and it needs to be a very good buff. 
---
Jesus, this hurts it‚Äôs so true.
---
I know about the hitbox change and said it was better despite the phantom hit glitch still being a thing. I didn't miss out on anything. Seems like you just want to bitch about whatever to make up for your faults in life. 
---
Okay that all makes sense. I'm not really much for playing the killer I always loved being the survivor in these types of games, I've had him once and I mistook him for another survivor (which is dumb I know but it was early into me owning the game) so me he just didnt fit the esthetic of all the other killers, he just doesn't stand out like the others do
---
I don't agree with this fully, if the killer has to put on a perk to see how many totems there are, then the survivors should have to as well. Why? Even thought the killer doesn't really have to worry about dull totems, they already have to put on a perk to see how many totems are left. If they were to implement this then the killer should be allowed to see each dull totem highlighted in a different color (or you know, allow the user to change the color of scratch marks and auras from red to something else because colorblind people)
---
The duplicating bug works with all items on the bloodweb lol
---
What if the last charge of a flashlight is going to save your teammate? 
---
No. It‚Äôs not hard to pay attention.
---
Always 
---
No ones saying base legion is too strong. And anyways, in this video the legion made a lot of bad choices, a good player would have gotten at least 2 out of that mess. 
---
FBI, open up!
---
Nah, I realized that long ago. When someone compared me to him back when I did not know who he was. He probably had similar motives to mine. Really making sure you become part of a community, really putting yourself into whatever people talk about.  
---
Back in the day I commented on EVERYTHING. Currently I don't comment much, but before that I changed my ways a little. Still commenting a lot, but not commenting if I really don't have anything to say about a post. Maybe cause it's a really shit meme that still got upvoted. Maybe I just don't have anything to say. Worked fine for me.  
---
Though I admit that I do slightly regret having put a twtv at the start of my name this time around. It can make me commenting looks disingenuous, trying to get people to follow my twitch.
---
The eyes look too far apart
---
Wish they'd update Trapper's and Wraith's. They're so boring. 
---
Survivor salt is such a pathetic thing when its unwarranted. The other day for example I got called a tunneler camper...when at one point I went across the map to check a generator when someone was in the basement as Myers, and then proceeded to chase after the person who freed them instead of going after the former hooked survivor when they got a pallet down. Like...what's the definition of those two again?
---
I've had this happen to me once against a pig. Only ever seen it on PS4 though. 
---
My experience was that all skill checks where invisible to me.
---
As you would have expected I died quite quickly to the bear trap.
---
ok but have you seen quentin in the movie? damn üò©üò©üëÖüëÖ
---
Playing on Haddonfield as Billy / Huntress
---
as survivor playing against legion, camping / tunneling Pigs
---
I thought it only works for prestige. Friend did it and said doing it with items glitches out the bloodweb for a minute.
---
Where is what?
---
Okay, so it's not really the end of the world, but it's such an unnecessary and unhelpful change that you have to wonder why they did.
---
Particularly since it introduced those exploits.
---
Hence why my 3 gen strat AROUND my hex totem with doc with Ruin, Overwhelming, Distressing, and Overcharge with calm add ons breaks any tactic survivors may have.
---
I see it on here everyday. 
---
I totaly agree
---
Why u throwin down pallets against nurse tho
---
as a p3 Quentin I don't appreciate this slander

It just makes me wish the standard PS4 controller had bumpers over the L2 and R2 triggers, like Logitech's PS3 controller did.
---
Nah, but you may get him hookedüòé
---
Yeah if you don't do it right you'll glitch the game out but ultimately if done right everything works well and you get unlimited items as long as you have the blood points to keep purchasing the items

That zoom at the very end lol

How did you get a volleyball from a perk named we're gonna live forever?
---
He's obviously playing basketball, smh
---
Goddamn...
---
Well maybe if you ask him nicely..
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
what you apparently quoted to Denichan.
---
Meg being anything but S is a travesty. You ever been with an athletic chick? It'll change your life.
---
Me
---
After seeing shirtless David I stopped looking at girls
---
It is. EW1 Myers is only 105. Hope's 107 is 2% faster than him.
---
Yes I‚Äôm asking you :/
---
The one thing i find scum about camping is that in a tournament I watched a face camping leatherface won since survivors cant get points off camping killers so the camping team won money
---
^ follow this format OP other perks to add to your meta collection include nurses calling, sloppy butcher, and monitor and abuse.
---
Gates are open you're free to go lol 
---
Three mediocre killer perks and a survivor perk. I'm guessing that this is  a joke, but I don't wanna make no assumptions.
---
It is real tho, you can't save everyone every time. If they are camping, cut your losses unless you have borrowed time, otherwise you are just wasting time.
---
No he calculated the probability, it says in it the title of the graph. "Chance", so I want to know how he got the probabilities for it. You're right it's a function of time but I'm asking how he figured out a probability for time intervals 
---
Well camping isn‚Äôt reportable and if they did report it, they would actually risk being punished themselves 
---
I had a brain fart, Hope is a perk that no one uses, but is a pain in the ass if they do
---
so now it is a he said she said thing. Ok so I cannot take you seriously then. At least Denichan is actually being constructive where you just wait on an excuse to shade on Tru3. I see.. disappointing I might add.
---
And circle gets the square.
---
His father did. He was lined up to inherit it before murdering everyone. 
---
My last three games. My first two games I was face camped. The third one I ran the killer around while everyone was doing gens, which was fine, then I finally went down bc no self care and I was face camped again. All three of my teammates didn‚Äôt even try to help and I watched someone hide in a locker. It‚Äôs so fucking infuriating. 
---
I've 100 percent given up trying to keep survivors happy with how they're treating. No matter how i play i get rage. I even got accused of camping by one guy because he died on his first hook. He didn't even notice that i hooked another survivor on the other side of the map while he was hooked. I made it back in time to stop him getting rescued but i see that as a failing of hes team to unhook fast enough 
---
Word. I just had a game where all 4 survivors popped BPS and then farmed me to a tunneling Wraith. He had Make Yoir Choice but only wanted me. 4 streamers and a BP total of 19k. 
---
Needless to say, I am going for a long angry walk.
---
When I try to do those loops I get chainsaw‚Äôd through window, guessing he had meh addons
---
Snitch
---
It be like that sometimes 
---
Toxic trash gotta stay together in the can.
---
It can be worth it because legions with no cooldown will punish you hard
---
I was the third upvote. I feel pleased
---
I've been on this subreddit since almost the beginning and played since beta. No, no other killer has made it for this long. Sharp hand Joe's had a device between "He's op" and "You just can't adapt" but that only lasted till the Nerf where suddenly people agreed that he was weak. This has gone on for much longer.
---
Actually thank you, man! Appreciate it!
---
Neck power.
---
Damn meg should be way higher. To the top!
---
Stop commenting my neck. 
---
Happened a while back but was playing a game where two survivors either didn't join or disconnected. So it was me and someone else against a Spirit.
---
Not going to lie, it took me a lot longer than it should have to realise the Spirit was farming bloodpoints with us. In the end both of us escaped and we all ended up with many bloodpoints between the 3 of us
---
Getting facecamped at the start of a damn game, then getting tunnelled. 
---
Make sure you reported them 
---
A lot of hate for me here, but I'll just say congrats to zubat and check my vods to see what I was actually doing. I was using a rotation of all characters till rank 3 (plus survivor) then used nurse for 12 games (mixing in survivor after each game) and got to rank 1. But yeah, no idea why this thread was about me...
---
Check the vods for the reality of this all, don't just listen to hearsay. Cheers!
---
Jesus christ what even is that video? It doesnt make any sense whatsoever
---
But seriously who tf doesn‚Äôt respect the 4% 
---
I haven't played a Freddy above rank 10 at all actually so I haven't seen him at his best. I really thought he was only viable to get one or maybe two kills if you have NOED because he has no chase ability to lend him a hand so ALL the power is in the survivors hands.
---
Freddy is exceptional at tunneling and is what he is built for. You just need to accept that that is part of the game and play on. I play both sides btw. 
---
no ed
---
 no ed
---
 no ed 
---
LOL
---
I would only camp in that situation if i had profiled the team as a bunch of wanna be heroes. When i see whole teams bolting for the hook instantly well then they deserve it for being that predictable.
---
But otherwise then i would go gen check and the moment i get one hit i disengage that chase and return that way i get a hit and the rescue party who thought i was busy
---
lol, I think you mean no one wants your toxic bullshit in this game. Games are a lot more fun when people are respectful.
---
Your rank matters if you want good teammates.
---
I have no idea but this is definitely my experience as well.  Its pretty rare that I get an easy kill to start the game even as a rank 13 killer, but on my rank 1 survivor it seems like every other game I see someone go down in the first minute of the game.
---
Hidden MMR maybe?
---
Im demonstrating the flawed, victim-blaming logic you're using. GG.
---
I only run the duration and speed addons because I think they work best for the "Run around and spread the pain" mentality I usually have when I play legion. I typically combine this with thanat and M&amp;A because people typically don't heal against legion when they run this kind of build because of how fast they can injure you. Thanat is good for that because of the obvious, but I think M&amp;A is slightly better because it will lower your terror radius to just 16 meters making sneaking up on injured survivors working on gens very easy. They usually don't have enough time to react to you and get to a safe spot even if you do only move at 110% because of how small your terror radius is.
---
What I don‚Äôt get is why can‚Äôt we change which buttons do this function? You can remap your controls in the settings for everything BUT this. Like...why? 
---
Especially as L3/P3 would make way more sense!!!!
---
It's not my fault you're bad at the game. Just catch the survivors.
---
If you are patrolling in the same map they will call that camping 
---
Long enough to know that you‚Äôre trolling me right now. This game is so in favor of the killers especially with our new event coming soon in the game. I don‚Äôt wanna hear it. 
---
Hey, I'm all for a good skill-capped killer. I actually main Nurse Huntress and Billy. It's just that The Legion isn't that either. He has a skill-cap so basic that after 10 games you're at max potential skill. The Don't seem to be going for power however. They keep trying to add "Fun" mechanics to the game. The most recent powerful killer was The Spirit, then you have The Clown, The Pig, The Nightmare and The Cannibal..  They're viability ranges from "You MAY win" to "Literally the weakest killer in the game". Those Killers don't feel like they were meant to be "Good", they feel like they were meant to be "Fun" gimmicks. Or am I missing your point?
---
As a killer I prefer immersed players rather than bold players. I hate when they are clearly not scared, ruins the fun of the game imo.
---
Just how I like them. Pls no kink shame
---
Says the person that actually shamed someone on your 64k follower Twitter, a streamer with 20 followers and you clipped this yourself, why? because one of them didnt like the way you played? who cares? Every streamer gets hate, but what you doing both on your Twitter and here? it is not ok. 
---
https://twitter.com/ScottJund/status/1087994183284084738 
---
As a very wise man said once: "My freedom stops where yours begins"
---
I recommend you stop. you are making a fool of yourself as I previously stated.
---
You're missing out
---
Im a rank 3 survivor, never used DS or Adrenaline once since Ive had the game because I havent touched Meg or Laurie. When the gates are open and noed is up, Im leaving. SWF or not. The Killers objective is to kill. Survivors objective is to survive. *When will people learn?*
---
That's okay, I know the difference between patrolling and camping and I guess that's all that matters.
---
Spirit is understandable because who would want to smash a dead girl but for the doctor whoooo you are missing out
---
My point was simply that the person you agreed to barely makes any sense and is just full of shit, yet you agreed with him/her. The game will not "fall" because of legion existing...
---
Happened today with Hillbilly.
---
Ended a game on autowreck where I did pretty badly (I can't deal with the tiles on this map without Bamboozle), I get a hook near one unopened gate, they all tried to save him
---
Ended up all downed and a good 4k for me.
---
Called me a camper.
---
I actually didn't agree with that part. I elaborated further in that comment.
---
song? very intersting.
---
Lol you started playing this game like what, 2 weeks ago? And yet you talk all big like you magically found out how everyone ia supposed to behave and call killers bad 
---
it‚Äôs annoying since it‚Äôs one of my dailies ;(
---
When I'm playing eithier side it's always when people take the game to seriously. Like playin with friends clearly trying to have fun with the killer and they just immedialty down and hook. Or when all surviovors are extremly immersed to the point where there's no point in even attempting to find them
---
Said the rank 17 crouches everywhere guy who started 10 days ago
---
I responded to your claim that he possibly disconnected o the loading screen, and said it was clear he did it on purpose, his name being the dead giveaway. I‚Äôm not sure what good asking me to re-read is going to bring, but either you‚Äôre just 200 iq for everyone or you‚Äôve done a really bad job of explaning your point judging by the downvotes.
---
Why should killer be givin the option to see items to decide perks. That's like survivors knowing they have bbq so they can run distortion. 
---
Not a joke, just went against a 4 man SWF and won
---
No idea, it's a bug since the latest patch. Re-capping the fps fixes it.
---
Nah I just don‚Äôt see an issue if anyone uses any perk. That‚Äôs what they are there for. I haven‚Äôt played as much since last patch so I actually don‚Äôt know about the exploit. Unless ur talking about the moonwalking mend thing but yea I don‚Äôt do that unless I get a Michael Jackson skin then I might just for the memes
---
That‚Äôs how it is now. They see the items. 
---
Leatherface will shut it down, but a good huntress will take one down by the time they're off the hook, so the others either escape, or the huntress keeps hooking them to death.
---
Yeah, it takes some time to get used to it, not shit talking but I have 300 hours on DBD pc and tried console, and it's easy just for the fact when you try to hit Some1 your fps drops like crazy, and I've experienced both sides and I never let any escape as killer and almost never died as survivor and I hate that my game play in console is eZ because of fps drop, I'd like them to upgrade optimization withing the game, now on pc is another story, and it's worse because it has more free weekends and you get new players, now imagine my white ass not playing for a month or 2, going back to see I'm in rank 20 basically, get a shit team where I save every1 but when I get hooked no1 even tries to come close to me to save me and get totally rekt by a killer that can't even use his ability properly 
---
A Dead Hard turn
---
Many wraiths ran sloppy before the bug.  Some went in to abuse it, others were just using it because it was how they played and made use of increased heal times giving them more pressure.
---
I remember last time I suggested a totem counter killers said that was overpowered and down voted me
---
It kinda is, because you 1st mention you quote from twitter and now it is from his stream? See how you are not being very consistent with your statements? If only you were human correct? 
---
If you agree with him then what is your beef here? 
---
Like you were moving between 3 points (the only 3 points that matter at end game) and that's a problem? In a survivor main but that's ridiculous.  What are you supposed to do just pick one and let them sneak around you? Get good at stealth patrolling is a legitimate strategy!
---
***^(WERE'S THE SATURATED PICTURE OF MYERS WITH +69 ON EVIL WITHIN)***^(?)  this screenshot asked for it, lol
---
Everyone is annoyed by/(reasonably) hates the the dude but did that many people on here play against him? He was only on PS4 at the time but I see people saying thank God theyll never have to deal with him again.
---
Did people on here actually play with him?
---
I've never played a game where ranks were as meaningless as they are in DBD.  Between how common it is for people to derank on purpose and the rank reset every month its so random.
---
Would literally not affect SWF.  All it is is counting to 5 and then you're done
---
I agree with your definitions, not sure why you're being downvoted 
---
If only there was spirit. Still, great job on this!
---
Happened to me on Haddonfield.. against a Myers who knew I was stuck... annnnnd there‚Äôs T3
---
I have a good time and try to be fair, but still lots of shitty people on both sides
---
do you even understand the sentence you just wrote?
---
You actually just said "If you agree with him that only bad killers run NOED and then he said that I need NOED WHATS THE BEEF AMIRITE?"
---
Yepppp, lots of people having the same problem. Just stay out of the basement for now until it‚Äôs been fixed
---
Oh, I was referencing a meme.
---
Wondering the same!
---
Meh.  
---
Had this happening too - apparently a vsync related issue on latest patch.... Had to turn vsync on for now
---
No kidding. On the rare occurrences I play killer, I don‚Äôt care about the hatch. I get a lot of BP for it. I‚Äôll look around for the survivor for awhile and try to kill them. I‚Äôd rather search than stare at a whooshing sound in the ground. 
---
Yeah, no thanks. I don‚Äôt think we need witch hunts here.
---
That's gotta be a F from me chief.
---
I mean, just practice.
---
Huh. Never thought a game dev would get fangirls/boys.
---
Shame licensed killers can‚Äôt get cosmetics.
---
I‚Äôd buy this in a fucking heartbeat.
---
Imagine thinking someone is a generally good person and than having someone call that person a fanboy. 
---
I went up against a michael on mount ormond and i barely saw him when i was doing a generator behind 2 snowy rocks stalking me and it was one of the few times ive been scared from this game
---
or you could just report them 
---
Posts picture on the internet for the whole world to see... gets mad when someone makes fun of her... NA logic 
---
as if this works. BHVR too busy doing skins and patches to ban exploit user instead of stuff we really need in this game. Reports are useless.
---
You're under arrest for.... for something.
---
Oh
---
*Survivor found*
---
‚ÄúHuh?!‚Äù
---
Was it that the person that camped everyone
---
thanks whoever added this, now I switch my character by accident and face infinite syringes or franks mixtapes....10/10 experience on console. barely runs at 15 fps on toaster tier graphics, everyone has OP shit.
---
Hope vs a 110% killer is just brutal.  It nearly quadruples how long it takes them to reach you unless bloodlust procs or their power can enable a catch.  Also makes it harder on wraiths who go for the super-lunge after a quick uncloak.
---
So is it just a short clip that loops or does the killer really go through the same actions
---
calling someone by what he is- an asshole- and revealing that is instantly a witch hunt? do we live in the same world?
---
First off, no one should make fun of others lul. Who has the right to? We‚Äôre all humans. Is it that hard to show some decency towards others? I just wanted to make a fun meme. 
---
Also I just said I don‚Äôt wanna hear it and if there‚Äôs no point in the comment, if it doesn‚Äôt tribute to anything but to possibly be mean, why even put it there in the first place? If it‚Äôs the intention to make fun out of somebody, it breaks dead by daylight‚Äôs sub rules. 
---
Yeah basically why I run it, also sometimes run adrenaline so I get real fast at end game
---
https://youtu.be/3XvbpWr6UV0

Me neither
---
Put a little hillbilly face somewhere and it won‚Äôt get removed
---
if he did 1000 games he noted each time at what time ruin was cleansed . If it's cleansed between 0 and 30s for 100 match then there's 10% chance that your ruin will be cleansed the first 30s into the match.
---
simple

You wouldn't be banned wtf

It's a joke not a dick dont take it soo hard... or maybe take one so you can chill the fuck out and loosen up 
---
The reason the last one was removed was because it was ochido related
---
At least on my computer it doesn‚Äôt have the same problems I keep seeing posted about the console version. And I heard Huntress and Nurse are way better on PC. But again never played the console version to compare firsthand.
---
&gt;What if he plays quietly?
---
Are we still talking about ochido? 
---
This is Laurie Strode slander and I wont stand for it ( though i do wish she was rendered better :'( )
---
i switched from ps4 to pc and have no regrets. ps4 version is a trainwreck and only getting worse. i'd say go ahead.
---
It‚Äôs not a joke if you purposely make fun of someone. Joke on your own behalf then or something that‚Äôs actually relevant without hurting others.  
---
Jesus Christ getting so mad because I said I don‚Äôt wanna hear comments about my body xD
---
Yup. Happens when I unhook or mend. Especially mending. It just makes me stand back up instantly. 
---
No I think he‚Äôs implying this could start a witch hunt
---
I got 4 neas with no mither and the names were   OwO oWo UwU and lOwO/
---
Noed and Ruin.
---
Usually the plebs will pipe up about noed, it‚Äôs not asking much to cleanse 5 totems between 4 people. 
---
Yup it happens when I sabo with toolbox but let's me with perk just fine
---
What about comments about how much of a fucking cry baby you are 
---
Thats exactly what happened to me once, the guy refused to see how his teammates were at fault and was saying how I camped and tunneled him lol 
---
Tmw Dwight *isn't* S++
---
Bitch you took me there
---
Sure when someone calls you out on your bs, you are memeing : ^ ) 
---
This is why I never took you seriously. 
---
huge F 
---
and they end up being a red/green rank duo
---
Yeah I know right? She‚Äôs like a D or F.
---
Omg lol that would have been too easy to escape minus bad luck/timing! Sounds like a player who just isn't that good and wants to blame you. I say this as a regular rank 12 (usually never higher though once I got 9) so I'm not exactly amazing either
---
that is a great deal! omg, i will definitely get it when it‚Äôs on sale, lol. and i don‚Äôt have many problems with her - there are a few where my swings don‚Äôt connect when they should be, and recently her dash is getting a bit laggy for me. it shouldn‚Äôt be my internet since it‚Äôs pretty strong :/ idk what it is. oh and sometimes  when i use bamboozle it doesn‚Äôt work (it‚Äôs only with her) and it just started happening.
---
There CLEARLY isnt a totem.
---
But seriously,  they need to implement a change where your totem power shall reside, kind of like a "Spell" when you get to your dull totem of choice...maybe give you a map overlay as the game starts, and you pick a totem where you can see its position to gens, exit gates, etc...
---
Honestly if I ever tried to be like that I‚Äôd die within 30 seconds of the game xD
---
I‚Äôm better at being stealthy with the killer around :3
---
When the wraith got buffed they gave him the force
---
#good bat
---
Srry, meant the other person lol
---
"Pretty good job so far"
---
Ah! Yeah they probably are too!
---
Hope they find a way to cope with it and improve it so they don‚Äôt have to go around saying stuff like that to others ^ ^
---
Accurate xD
---
You'll have one week after you get back at least
---
Than what about not being able to really effectively hide from doctor T3 madness slows the game down and prevents you from doing certain actions 
---
"Get off my swamp"
---
I considered legion as a ghostface tbh
---
How does it look inappropriate?
---
Sadly enough, after being featured in some Rick and Morty episode, For the Damaged Coda became known for most people just as "Evil Morty Theme". If you google "Blonde Redhead" up, you'll see ton of evil morty themes before any other song.  
---
I love almost all of BR's songs and it's just disappointing for me that most other songs got eclipsed by good, but totally not the best, theme for some movie character. :(
---
I never watched ochido but seeing positivity in the dbd community is amazing so I‚Äôm alright with it 
---
Ignore him, Cookieh.
---
Don't let these "Nice guys" push you down! 
---
You're amazing :D
---
How would they know you used the glitch tho
---
So is Ghostface being a future killer impossible? Idk how they'd balance him or what his perks would be because he's a slasher and he mainly uses phones.
---
Would he be similar to the Legion?
---
Link?
---
&gt;Frick
---
NO FRICKS
---
This is at rank 5-1 where most people don't mind just working through it
---
first Noed, then someone claimed enduring and fucking Iron Grasp?
---
Whats next Spies from the shadows?
---
Lol what?
---
Keep it up hun!!! I hope to see you on Face Off one day, I'd be rooting for you! :)
---
Killer propaganda is real, if the subject matter was reversed it would've been downvoted to oblivion within 5 minutes.  1.3k upvotes wtf lmao 
---
Does this mean 1 person can get a gen done faster then 4 people 
---
I have this issue too
---
Especially since half the time the survivors end up being absolutely horrible, and the other half are super optimal showing that the ranks being "fair" didn't even matter. So you basically sit there waiting the time it takes for a full game for... nothing... yay
---
Sex when your parents arrive in the driveway: Adrenaline 
---
This was a problem before 2.5.0, and if you read the patch notes. They are currently working on this problem. *This is BHVR though. So that may mean absolutely nothing.*
---
This subreddit dick rides killers so hard
---
No. If you have more than 1 person on a generator, it can still be done faster than if 1 person did the gen
---
Freddy is boring as hell to play against. He isn't fun because if you're being tunneled it's a full game of running and if you're not the one being tunneled you're just doing gens and walking out the door. Most of them tunnel the same person all game letting everyone else gen rush if the person being tunneled is good at running.
---
Wait what map addon? 
---
Separate out, kite and do gens as fast as you can. The longer a game goes for Legion, the better. 
---
For a second there I thought that you had found another glitch.
---
No joke a survivor that has a perk to attack the killer would be awesome. 
---
Why don‚Äôt you make a case instead of trying to be witty?
---
Unrelenting is next
---
The one thing I hate about legion is his wipe animation... it's just so gross, his sleeves must be so crusty and sticky
---
I just want to mention something as well.
---
I assume all the things such as survivors GG as 1 example is tallied if 1 survivor says GG.
---
If that is the case, then there is a significantly better chance that survivors will have more times that they say GG, get salty, etc. Just because it's a 4:1 ratio of survivors to killers.
---
Very big brain indeed. Much skill
---
Yeah it's basically to be expected that the killer is gonna camp if you are the only one on the hook when the doors are open. It's up to a coordinated team to do something about it. Tbh even an intelligent individual can pull off a heroic save against someone who isn't Leatherface
---
o7
---
Shit happens to me all the time, chase music blaring while I didn't even know someone was around me and I still can't find them anyways 
---
Ace and fang are getting brand new outfits 
---
I had a match as a rank 12 killer and went up against what ended up being 4 man swf that where rank 5 and up.  It was the worst match as killer I've ever had.
---
10/10 would oink!
---
Save the Best for Last is godly on any m1 killer who doesn't have an insta-down in their kit. It works especially well for m1 killers who have a power that can affect the obsession while the killer ignores them, like Doctor and Freddy.
---
You can get the hooked and savior pretty easy you just hatchet throw the hooked as soon as their off then hatchet throw into melee the savior. Shes widely considered better at basements then leatherface for this reason. But yeah when the hooks not in the basement and in the open assuming you can charge chainsaw and get in range before the unhook yeah lf can shut It down, but if a huntress is in range shell do the same thing from melee range and has a better chance to at range.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say he played exclusively nurse and billy
---
If you have all 4 people alive by the time the gates are powered you had plenty of time to cleanse the totems. It really isnt that hard to find them, except one or two placements on a couple maps.
---
Sounds like a true killer
---
Love that stare at the Gen like, "Well... Fuck that then." 
---
can you get banned by de ranking ?  (going in game and immediatelly dc to get -2 pips )
---
Chapters are roughly every 12 weeks.
---
Granted, Chapter 9 (Spirit) came out 14 weeks after 8 (Clown), but there were issues with the Summer Event iirc.
---
However, Chapter 10 (Legion) came out 12 weeks after 9.
---
Oh. I get that feeling. :(
---
I'm sorry to say I've only listened to Blonde Redhead's Album 'Melody Of Certain Damaged Lemons' ('Ballad of Lemons' being my favorite song), I've heard 'For the Damaged Coda' in some Dead by Daylight related videos and thought it'd be an appropriate song for dying on the first hook.
---
That is... quite the long arm on Frank
---
TIL this was read
---
woo!
---
Pc, console, everywhere honestly. Best just to drop a gg and leave quickly or block messages from people not on your friends list.
