1. If you really want to learn the killers reach the hard way, play it dangerous and go around for another time. If you're actually looking to escape or play a little better in matches, I'd almost always say its better safe than sorry with pallet dropping.
---

---
2. I wouldn't worry about this too much. Especially against killers who know what they're doing, 360's won't buy you more than a second or two of time. I wouldn't worry about trying to master this particular skill.
---
3. For most characters, the terror radius indicates how far away the killer is. (obvious tip alert) a little experience will let you know how much time you have before the killer gets there.
---
4. Just read the game. Aura reading perks are helpful here. Try to be mindful of your teammates. Are all three of you on the same side of the map? You might wanna spend a second seeing if anyone is going to unhook them. I wouldn't run towards every hook you see though, particularly ones that are across the map. Any generator you start but don't finish is progress that is liable to be lost when the killer damages the Gen.
---
5. Depends on the killer. Hillbillies, nurses, and other chasing and power heavy killers you should probably play cautiously. Against stealth/trap killers, you may have more time to stick around. Just a general rule of thumb.
---
6. Just the obvious. Don't teabag, and don't farm your teammates off the hook. But keep in mind there's no way to please everyone and a killer somewhere will be displeased by your playstyle, and vice versa.
---
7. If you're leveling survivors to unlock their teachables, go for the cheapest items and let the entity take more expensive ones. If you're playing your main character that you want to keep, I would always take items of the highest rarity first.
---
Also, always always ALWAYS get a perk, first thing in the bloodweb.
---
8. David King and Claudette are good picks. Any survivor with an "easy" rating will have perks that don't take much time or experience to use effectively.
---
Killer tips:
---
1. When you need pressure. Dead by daylight is a game that tends to snowball. Especially at high ranks, the best chance for you winning is to apply a lot of pressure, and take a survivor out of the game ASAP. Leaving all four alive is a recipe for failure. Remember, you'll never break a chain by evenly applying pressure, only by breaking the weak link.
---
2. I'd say when you've met 3 criteria. 1. You've injured the survivor. 2. They've just dropped a pallet. And 3. You have another, reasonably close target to chase.
---
3. I'd advice watching videos of both killer individually. They're both stealth killers, but their play styles are wildly different. No way to generalize perks there.
---
4. Scratch marks are the least reliable way to track survivors. If possible you should focus on blood, grunts of pain/breathing, footsteps, crows etc. Pay attention to the scratch marks, but note that they are misleading and try to find a better trail to follow.
---
5. Killers I would advise finding out the best add-ons and stockpiling those. Also note that unlike common survivor add-ons, most common killer add-ons actually make a big difference, and you should definitely focus on stockpiling charge time add-ons if there exist any for your killer.
---
6. YES! If there's a perk you'll never use, and it's the third tier, get it off the web. With the exception of when you prestige, you'll never have to buy it again and the pool is smaller allowing you to get better perks.
---
7. Once the gates are open and the time begins, you can just wait them out. They'll either leave or die, you don't have to subject yourself to embarrassment any more luckily. If they don't open the gates, you can do so by pressing space when they're powered and leaving the area.
---
8. Trapper, and hillbilly would be my two.

Spoiling as in giving a ton of stuff, not as in saying endgame spoiler in r/expectedthanos
---
Whether or not you 'guarantee' it has no meaning to it. There's no studies, no trends, no other games that can significantly support your viewpoint. Therefore, it's difficult to talk about it because we have no basis to go with other than our own game.
---
Every game is repetitive. MOBA's, single player, GTA, etc... all of these get boring from time to time. What makes people continue to play some more than others is the notion of ranking up. People continue to play MOBA's to reach higher ranks because they find it rewarding and fulfilling. Does that mean rank is responsible for their toxic community? Maybe... maybe not. 
---
In DotA, there's a game mode called 'Turbo'. It's basically a steroid version of the game that a lot of people play online. It has zero meaning in terms of rank. You can't rank up with it. You can't have a badge next to your name, nothing. However, people still take it seriously even though it's meant to be for fun. Why? People like to win and they don't like losing. This is why I don't think taking off rank will do anything, because there is a win / loss aspect in the games we play. You died? Loss. You escaped? Win. Whether or not a rank is attached to it will not matter, people will still be upset that they died in the game.
---
Can relate.
---
The game is literally only as big as it is because of licensing.
---
and immersed claudette’s, don’t forget them
---
Dead hard gang rise up
---
I definitely agree but at the same time there’s new players that leave due to a lack of understanding. The tutorial is great for a newer player but some people will still be confused. I know multiple people who uninstalled DBD after only 5 matches or so just because there was no chat and they had questions. I think BHVR isn’t required to follow all of our wants and requests but I think some form of mid game chat other than just a wave would be a little helpful.
---
Alright. This is a general new player guide so I'm going to assume very little and give as much info as possible.
---
Let's start with the base strategy: finding survivors. You're playing too passively, and as the killer you have to put the pressure on them. Search generators, and if you can't ever seem to find a survivor with a generator running nearby, check the lockers at ranks 20-15, and around the corners of loops at ranks 14 onwards. Often times survivors will do 1 of 3 things when a killer grows near their gen at the beginning. Hide, juke, or run. Some players will have urban evasion (base walking speed while crouched, meaning they can sneak away a bit faster) so when searching a generator give a fairly wide radius but don't stay too long. Kick it and move on. More gens they have to do, the more pressure they have. If you can get 1 hook before a gen pops you're doing fine. 
---
Perks: most perks are personal choice, aside from two. Hex: ruin and BBQ &amp; chili. Ruin slows the game down just a little bit, thus more time to hunt survivors (who at lower ranks will usually search for the totem rather than repair generators)  and win with more gens up. BBQ is godly for the bloodpoint grind that is DBD, as well as moderate tracking (shows survivor auras beyond 40 meters for 3 seconds) so anything goes, but those two are king while still learning
---
How to attack as killer: (incase you or whoever else reading this doesn't know, you can lunge attack by holding down the attack button) now, always think about where a survivor is going, and their next move, not what are they doing right now. Sure, know what they are doing but always try to anticipate what survivors will do. A window nearby? They'll most likely jump through. Pallet around the corner? Don't swing unless you know you'll hit them before they reach it. Looking behind them and watching your every move? They most likely have dead hard and will dodge your next attack, so bait it out by getting close ( or delaying the attack as nurse after a blink)
---
The Killer mindset: always be in a proactive reactive state. Don't fall into a pattern, and always be on the lookout for clues of survivor perks. Someone unhooked then healed shortly after? Medkit or we'll make it. Getting unhooked with broken status effect? Deliverance. Obsession symbol around their name, but not running any obsession perks? Expect decisive strike or object of obsession. You More Often than not can exploit these by denying them these. Always focus on gen defense. Don't focus on getting a 3 gen strat, but if a gen is about to pop then stay around for an extra couple seconds before leaving (Pop goes the weasel is great for this, as instant gen regression is amazing)
---
Killer specifics:
---
Trapper: deny loops, and proxy an section of the map. Don't leave much, and with him the basement is your best friend.
---
Billy: vroom vroom, you're super fast and instant down people. Try and get a saw off but don't be afraid to simply chase and down.
---
Wraith: easily the weakest, but still viable. Stealth near a gen, and if you hear it being repaired, get visual on the survivor and try to body block them. This guarentees the first hit and makes the chase much easier
---
Nurse: always be blinking. You're basically hillbilly but with an easier time going from A to B, and can simply ignore survivor defenses. They will try to juke but so long as you get close enough with the first blink the second is your correction blink and gives you an easier time getting a hit off.
---
Meyers: stalk out of tier 1 ASAP. You're weaker than a base killer and will get stomped if you can't get past tier 1. Distance and line of sight are your best friends here, as well as walls and even height. Like in team fortress 2 nobody looks up. In a chase, stalk until you're almost at tier 3, then when you're about to hit the survivor pop tier 3 and insta-down them (biggest pants wetting moment outside of seeing a billy right behind you fully revved up)
---
Hag: trapper only you're the injuring mechanism
---
Doctor: my boy. Best tracking killer with his restraint add-ons making it so illusionary doctors aura's are visible in madness 2 not just 3. Starting the game, get as many people into tier 2 as soon as possible, but prioritize hitting a survivor over tier 2 madness. Also for perks, a big terror radius all the tine is the best, so ignore monitor and abuse, and get distressing. Also, a restraint and calm add-on is an amazing combo. Everything else is a kind-of. In the chase? He can stun a survivor from dropping a pallet or vaulting with timing, but the delay between shock, switch forms and smack is hard. Shock when you can't get a hit, and hit when you can. 
---
Huntress: she's basically got a much longer lunge. Use her hatchets as such, with the occasional 360 YY no-scope cross-map tomahawk toss.
---
Cannible: best defensive character. If someone goes for an unhook in front of you, rev and let go when the other person is on the ground. Rev when near a pallet to either insta-break it or down the survivor.
---
Freddy: use his dream traps to slow down survivors at loops, or dream pallets to mess with asleep survivors. Teleport to a gen when you think a survivor is on it, or use it to get survivors off a gen and chase as normal (this is his mind-game)
---
Pig: use her crouch to sneak near a generator, and then chase as normal. Only lunge for the dailies. Put a trap on a survivor when you chase them away from a nearly done gen or after the first gen pops. That extra pressure of the trap removes that player until they get it off. Especially if a gen pops when they have the helmet on.
---
The clown: he's the herder. In a chase, throw his bottles at windows or pallets to either punish a survivor for running through it or dissuade them from going there. If a survivor is in the open and you can get a free hit, throw the bottle at/on them and then hit them. Less speed from the post:hit boost.
---
Spirit: she's the big brain player. Pallet loop? Go still and maybe they'll run at you. If they don't, phase and slap them from the other side, or just run to them and slap them that way. Also, her "husk" is a physical entity, so if you get to a pallet before a survivor you can plop your body down there and spirit walk to them for a pretty easy hit.
---
Legion: cry a lot
---
Plague: vomit. Only grab corrupt if they aren't cleansing much. Break them with vomit before hitting them. After kicking a gen, puke on it.
---
Ghost face: T-bag and stalk
---
Bloodpoints and iridescent shards are literally the only rewards you get for playing the game, there are no rank rewards, pips literally just make the game worse the more you acquire for both sides (good swf teams for killers, god nurses for survs at rank 1) also I still consistently pip at higher ranks despite not playing the upper tier killers. Either way, you may have a point if ranking rewards were currently an implemented feature, but since it's not, I want you to think about what you're earning by hitting higher ranks. Bragging rights possibly, a red/purple number can look nice. Bloodpoints are kinda the only thing that matter in terms of progression for now, so....
---
What about a multi-pass?
---
just hold on and let your team do gens while he loses for being stupid, uness your team is dumber
---
And apparently fuck your teammates, too. Nice one.
---
Far too little text
---
BHVR is partly responsible by allowing toxic play styles to persist in the game.
---
I always love hearing people’s reasons for DCing. 
---
Recently I had a guy dc while I mori’d him, his reason was because it’s not fair to mori when he was only on the hook once.
---
Just let the cowards be cowards
---
Oh no...here bud. Take all my F’s. You need them more.
---
Nice
---
If I was a dev, I'd make a seperate matchmaking area for players new to the game that locks after a certain amount of time played, where new players only face new players, and the survivors could have some extra form of communication exclusively in that mode.
---
At all ranks it seems the scum mains can't handle the only killer that isn't a guaranteed escape for survs
---
Protect me
---
New Nancy perk, you see your scratch marks and walk faster
---
I do this every time I SWF with my friend. One screams at the other to give them the WGLF stack and one tries to kobe before they get saved. Absolute blast.
---
Thotslayer Ahoy
---
That is... fucking hilarious. Good job man.
---
Your game strategy is completely rigid, you refuse any forms of concealment what's so ever that you refuse to hide in a locker for 5 seconds just so the killer doesnt know where you are and can finish the gen you're working on
---
I like that idea, something similar to the Newcomer mode in R6 would probably be helpful.
---
I’m not so sure about that, NotOtz plays in red ranks as interesting perks and killers, and wins the games. Seems mostly like it’s about being smart
---
Let me tell you about a time I run almost a full circle around the map without getting hit in a chase.
---
I have data on my last 350+ games on Xbox and you are indeed correct based on my experience.  Plague and clown lower than everyone else.
---
Ok, what's the latest major survivor nerf again?
---
No clip? Lol idk
---
I see your lack of brains wasnt just for show, its empty all the way down. I said old DS, not new DS. New DS is great. And I guess we're done here. You're too rabid and stupid too see past your own "injustice" and honestly I've lost the will to argue with stupid people anymore. Have a good day, if you can.
---
I also do it for people I see having bad luck. Especially when I see their teammates essentially screwing them at every opportunity. 
---
I also sometimes will roll dice at the start for each survivor. Highest number gets to live unless they are a toxic shit.
---
I dont see anything in this clip that would make her death your fault...

I love when people use meme builds and do well.
---
What I hate is when they use meme builds, then get all preachy in the post game chat because you used BBQ and they think that means they won somehow.
---
Chapters like this attract many people to the game and bring money in, that makes the game survive longer. Stop being an asshole and enjoy being pallet-looped by Steve.

If the game is still doing well by the time this ends, we could very well get Jason. F13 The Game is dead and will never get new content only updates.

You're definitely preaching to the choir on that one.

I fucking loved hoodwinked as a child, the scene where the rabbit monologues his plan and leaves red trapped on the tram gave me chills

To be fair that child was Eleven. A kid with telekinetic powers. The demogorgon is still a terrifying killer just like the rest.

No, clearly you enter the exit gate in order to exit the game.

would it be mean to stalk to Lvl 3 Myers and get a down if they are T-bagging?
---
hey r/EmojiPolice you better not use that emoji again
---
You can see he tried, and that's why I'll never run Self Care anymore. He tried to open it a few times but he got the self care prompt instead and began to heal himself. The amount of times I've started self care instead of dropped a pallet has turned me on the perk as a whole.
---
Tech me your ways
---
I need this to be a thing.
---
I mean, you had to know she has Franklin's by that point in the game... lol
---
I'm a more experienced player, but I'm reading this immediatly after playing my first ever actual game as billy, which was also a 4k BUT IT WAS A DISASTER. Ace kept watching me sprint into a garbage can 2 feet infront of me.
---
Ive watched this like 12 times and it still keeps getting funnier
---
Yes recently this happened in the Ghost face Patch.
---
BBQ
---
Same for me. It took a couple of chainsaw sprints to get the turning down but after that it was great
---
That’s  how the meme (guy) spelled it
---
I will make it my personal mission to save every baby I meet in game. A small sacrifice for a larger picture.
---
Before or After it's opened? If it's after then that's mega powerful for a Last Man Standing build,
---
True true and I wouldn't levy anything at killers who close the hatch not knowing that the Survivior was gonna get hit by the bug
---
Nancy is the new dwight
---
Please put that in the DBD store
---
Its a risk I am willing to take. Plus I needed to get it off my chest how I feel. I could do the same for Doctor
---
Imagine thinking you’re edgy
---
BBQ. You can get Plague with I shards for corrupt.
---
Being honest the most people sre really toxic (on xbox at least) i started playing again loke 2 or 3 weeks ago and the amount of messages calling me trash or stuff like that is so stupid
---
I'd go with BBQ as it's usually a must for most builds on every killer.
---
For the longest time I thought the cowering survivor was a ball
---
Then don't play stealthy against doctor.
---
*exposed status intensifies*
---
What is "Urban Immersion"?
---
What rank are you?
---
The hash marks were also jumping to a heartbeat.
---
run it with borrowed time for redundancy, we must protecc
---
Id do no ed personally.
---
Spirit is just really strong. All killers should be strong
---
The problem is that the baby survs won't know what the "endurance" status effect does and will waste it by running from the killer when it's about to run it
---
And Gollum
---
Fuck this dude he used to be new and suck too, he probably still sucks
---
PS4 has about triple the amount of PC players iirc. Xbox is the lowest.
---
I am! I happy it’s in the game day one.
---
Yes but yet the playerbase being under 20k (in all regions) on PC is fairly small for how matchmaking works.

---
i play mostly killer and don't usually run hex perks except ruin. on some killers (nurse, billy, spirit), i don't even use that. hex perks aren't very good because they can be found and taken out easily so if you want hex perks you either run 1 game-slowing hex (ruin or huntress lullaby) so you can use it as bait to catch survivors, run devour hope and just hope that no one finds it before you get your 3 stacks, or run hex perks in all 4 slots with thrill of the hunt and a character with a fast movement ability
---
This one looks like it came from The Bible.

Get back to us when you've ranked down.

Public Test Server it’s a server to test new additions to the game before completely adding them

I actually like his costume design for the game, oddly enough.
---
So because I’m ok with pulling agro ti relieve my teammates, and promote cooperation over selfish strategies...you concluded that I chase the killer chasing someone else....
---
I swear this sub.
---
because nobody expects killers to play like human scum.
---
Yep. That trap is the most horrific of the entire series
---
It’s okay but it’s not Ghost Face

I mean but did it cost money?

Seriously done to death

---
Probably not enough for it to make a difference either way to be honest.
---
Believe it not, most people online are not helpless and naive. They have already been exposed to the toxicity of the internet. Maybe they have played other games that have rampant toxicity, maybe they have iron-skin and will just shrug it off, or maybe they’ll laugh it off imaging a sweaty basement dweller telling them to “kys”.
---
I get what you’re saying; maybe some people will think the game is too competitive for them so they leave. However, to say the game is so toxic that it will drive many people away is a big stretch. DBD really isn’t that bad. Every once and a while you get someone being awful but I don’t think that that’s a problem solely belonging to DBD and these new fans are in for quite the shock when they learn that a game about online multiplayer is not sunshine and rainbows. They probably have a general grasp on how bad things can get online and they’ll (probably) manage.
---
TL;DR they’ll be fine lol

---
Don't worry mate. The PTB is the Public Testing Beta. It's where all the new killers and survivors go so people can try them in extremely long queue waiting lines. As for how to open it, I currently forgot since I'm not at my computer atm, but you can also search it up online. I learned how to find it from watching Monto.
---
Yes I am coming clean but like I said my friend warned me that it might just be all killer mains who respond to this so I was a little on edge about the meaning I obviously took it the wrong way and I apologize. I’m also new to this subreddit
---
He's about Meyers tier with good add-ons and a player that mains him more often than not. I may be a doc main but there are some that put me to shame.
---
Seems easy to fix. Matchmake based on the highest rank survivor. Killer mains complain about long matchmaking ques, this would help out good players as well as new players. Obviously wouldn't be perfect but a hell of a lot better than what we have now.
---
it'd be that way if not for those rank resets tho.
---
Expect the 360 and don’t let them try it. Maybe back up a little ?
---
Thatll change soon enough lol
---
Pig is my favorite killer to just mess with survivors in a fun way. I remember teabagging an ash that dc'd with a nea and letting her live cause of it.
---
Low ranks and when you're able to just body a survivor. Also, when you see someone get into a locker for their head-on and just decide to trap in front of it with quick-trapper. The salt is delicious.
---
That's Meyers not a Billy, silly.
---
So many campers trying to figure out how to use this perk and God bless them, they are trying not to camp, and are getting destroyed each match since they don't know how to play.
---
Thank you Sir! But as I said, never experienced that in any other multiplayer. So it‘s not an Internet thing in general.
---
Careful with the “X main” talk, often leads to squabbles. I’m a killer main myself and agree spirit is bullshit, the only real requirement is basic game sense and some headphones
---
It doubled in only a 40 minutes? Lmao
---
They probaly put bbq on there as well so then survivors wont have enough for new cosmetics
---
Clean the toxicity of the community
---
Yeah once I get up there to the dedicated players it’ll be way tougher with all the builds that float around and all around high skill than me but that just makes the kill feel way better
---
U.S. dollars, or just 12 units of your currency?
---
Because this is all they have going for them.
---
I just try to follow them as I swipe. Usually works. Most 360s fail in my experience.
---
This really isnt the best chapter, boring and or annoying perks that provide boring lick bassed un fun gameplay for both killer/survivor, Indoor maps are just ResidentSleeper zones too, Just a simple cash grab so the developers can bait in a bunch of idiots into buying dbd, instead of doing anything creative them selves. God that livestream was terrible the devs just seem awkward and confused half of the time, this game has honestly turned to cancer.
---
Oop sorry
---
In no other game it‘s that much as in dbd. I know how salt, internet and mother insults work. I‘m just curious why the amount of all that is so damn high in dbd.
---
fucking, i feel this so hard because legit 2 days ago i spent 550k bloodpoints on a lvl 50 claudette and i only got lithe in the next few matches after dumping all that in, it was painful
---
not if you keep it an exhaustion perk but limit it to 2 uses per match
---
This is amazing!!! ❤️
---
You need to be a Twitch streamer with a steady following.
---
I get it, you get off from downvotes? I'll oblige.
---
As they’re being a dick about it I’ll say the correction they’re going for. If the next word starts with a vowel sound then you would use “an” instead of “a” the same way the French use l’ instead of le/la
---
Nbd my guy. Tone is hard to convey over screen text. Enjoy the fog 🤙🏻
---
By the entity...
---
Brilliant!!
---
It's a map add-on that allows you put down these markers by pressing Space while using the map. Only Survivors can see it.
---
I found out how to do a report and I submitted the image to dbd. I feel like the person deserves a ban, especially since my ps account is shared with a child, but ultimately that's up to the dbd team to decide.
---
OK.. All those games are huge, too.  There are thousands upon thousands of multiplayer games, 99% of them barely see a few hundred concurrent players.
---
I've never had an issue with DBD queue times that weren't server based issues.

Look at literally any IO game, they rarely have more than 100 players but there's tons of them and have typically short queue times.
---
Dunno , I assume it's just lot more egotistical ppl in this community or something. Also feel like this subreddit is mostly killer mains ( waiting for the wave of downvotes) complaining or commenting about something that happens in their game
---
Otz is running auto-didact right now and other survivors thinks he's cheating because it's so good for healing lol
---
It's probably because the game sizes are small and everyone stands out more as an individual. So basically if you do anything that someone else thinks is stupid or whatever, it's a lot easier to remember who it was and be a dick to them.
---
So if a letter is pronounced or spelled with a vowel right at the start then a single use would be “an” not “a” 
---
for instance; 
---
“here is *an* ice cream cone,” 
---
“here is *a* doughnut” 
---
“this is *an* herbal remedy,”
---
every time dude, you're not alone
---
I wouldn’t say they are a nood, it’s just most people use toolboxes or flashlights. So seeing a map is kinda rare, let alone a map with that offering.
---
It is of a man being forced down and having his mouth opened as another naked man shits into his mouth.
---
I hate this mentality. 
---
"WHY U PLAY GAME IF YOU NO PLAY GAME BEFORE?!"
---
Do you want your online game to die? Because this is how you make it die.
---
The infinity gauntlet. If you ever see it's beam of light you're supposed to go grab it so you can be thanos until you get murdered. Or murder them all. THE END IS NEAR!
---
Just make fatigue shorter. Not a single cc should last longer than 3 seconds in this game. There's nothing worse than staring at a mostly black screen for 4 or 5 seconds.
---
You can compare DBD to every PC game to ever exist and sure you can say it's top 1% for activity
---
This game is toxic as hell, its full of try hards who expect to escape every game.
---
I had a game yesterday where my BL didn't activate twice during a chase and I wasn't Exhausted. I ended up getting downed shortly after dropping from a fall.
---
It might reset, we have to wait for PTB. I imagine it works for both unhook states.
---
I haven't gotten hope once, throughout my entre time playing as Survivor, which, granted, isn't quite as long, but I feel it on the other end of the spectrum, I always get Monstrous Shrine in Killer Bloodwebs, it's so bad.
---
9000 chilean pesos, which translates 12.51 dollars
---
I love how inner strength is simultaneously strong but not broken and also gives killers a geniuenly good reason to play around lockers and use perks like iron maiden
---
It doesn't help that Gun had all that content ready AND knew about the upcoming lawsuit, and instead chose to withhold tons of new content and just cancel it altogether, a lot of which was pretty much done.
---
Just don't defend Gun, it's a shit company that did horrible with a great license and ruined their own game.
---
That's still being instantly stunned 8 times a match. Pass.
---
The answer to that is
---
"To see how long it takes"
---
Funny enough, the survivors kinda start throwing after a bit and I have to force them out the gate.
---
This is the power of Requiem
---
Me and the bois circiling the demogorgon
---
Yep, that sounds like David.
---
Yea that's true
---
Wtf
---
Ah okay. I didn't see the video. Thanks for the information
---
But Amanda loves being high
---
Oh dear
---
IMHO to fix legion either increase their speed significantly during frenzy or make their terror radius silent during frenzy. Honestly they were supposed to be confusable as a survivor from what I heard, and they run like a spastic coked out mule which doesn't look like a survivor at all.
---
Hey fortnite used to be great back in the day. It's shit now but it used to be great.
---
It's literally just you holding a stick why did you post this
---
We're gonna farm forever* FTFY
---
I took party inspiración on SH, though I was thinking IT moringa Luke the bobblehead nurses. Also, she would have a gimmick like leather leatherface, where she needs to kill 30 times a survivor (Meg, Claudette,  etc) to wear their basic clothes.
---
Try ubisoft mutliplayer games and u will see what toxic is... :/
---
Just run Distortion
---
Same. If I’m just doing a daily I’m more inclined to let more people live.
---
TBH I just wanna see the picture
---
"Burns by daylight"
---
The dev response is amazing
---
Damn can we just talk about how the it follows soundtrack is a big booty banger
---
"This community is so toxic" -Every community ever
---
If you go into a locker to get health you'll get the exposed status and we will know which locker.
---
Wait so you don't need the lunge to make the hit, unless it's to a window or pallet, something they have to do that you can take advantage of the lunge with.
---
&gt; True, but we aren't all good players. Those of those that stuck around are.
---
You actually think that everyone browsing this subreddit is a "good player". What defines a good player anyway in a game that hardly requires any actual mechanical skill?
---
Dcing against a legion, he's not even one of the meta killers (not that it's ok to DC against them either) x.x that's just rude
---
Yehha.
---
Now, I’ll challenge you on one thing here: Scratched Mirror on Haddonfield.
---
Now, many say SM is only useful on Gideon and Lery’s. And true, it’s best on those two maps. However, I have found a lot of success on Haddonfield in the past.
---
You see, the backs of the houses provide excellent cover to ambush survivors and cut them off. As a Tier 1 Myers in a normal match without SM, keeping to the backs of the houses to remain undetected is heavily encouraged anyway- but as SM Myers, it can be very useful. 
---
Of course, Myers does struggle on this map if you’re up against survivors who figure out your strategy early on. But most times I’ve done this I’ve found a lot of success here, and I think it’s heavily underrated as a Scratched Mirror map. Is it on the same level as Gideon? No. Is it on the same level as Lery’s? Hell no. And is it on a similar level to the new Stranger Things map? Even from what little of it we’ve seen thus far, of course not. But Haddonfield can be pretty good with SM Myers.
---
And as usual he's on a twitter rant about this, why is he so unable to take a joke?
---
Its not even that far from the truth, he accuses people of sniping way too much, either he's the most sniper person in the history of streaming or he thinks he's more important than he really is
---
If you're running quick and quiet or not that close to the killer you wouldn't know at all.
---
It is pretty exciting. horror was never my genre so I didn't watch Halloween or scream until after playing Dbd. Still never watched elm street, saw, or chainsaw, but stranger things, I ate that right up.
---
Guess they didn’t wanna get Mori’d
---
Predator would make absolutely no sense because it’s considered dishonorable among yautja to kill defenseless/harmless creatures.
---
She would have a gimmick where she can switch between 4 bodies scattered around the map, with a 20 second cooldown. With addons, she would have more abilities build up to this, like detection of survivors when one is near, a little less cooldown time, etc.
---
I just see Koichi.
---
what
---
No. But I wasn't speaking on them. I was speaking about the game.
---
"You shouldn't end up with new players if your ranking is high enough"
---
TELL THAT TO THE FUCKING MATCHMAKING SYSTEM
---
Some people might not even play it but they would buy just because the like the source material.
---
I know i few people like that.
---
Thats the koichi pose
---
Scratched Mirror and Dead Rabbit (SM makes it so you can’t go past Tier 1- Dead Rabbit only affects Tier 2 and 3). Haddonfield is a very unorthodox map for Scratched Mirror. And, to top it off, he’s running two aura reading perks with Scratched Mirror.
---
Pretty typical behavior amongst a PvP community honestly.
---
Yea She's Annoying But She's Not That Hard To Mindgame. And Nurse Is Worse.
---
Oh no. The locker's aura is shown on the map for a few seconds. Don't let it be a quick killer either
---
“I’ve illustrated my opinion onto a meme, therefore it is valid and superior”
---
Ok...
---
I'm going to end up watching Stranger Things purely for DbD now
---
Three things:
---
1) Gun said that almost immediately after the Horror Inc told them they would authorize new content. Gun isn’t a huge AAA publisher. They can’t afford to keep a developer working on content they can’t release. Nor can they just hire a developer at a moment’s notice to kickstart development at a moment’s notice. 
---
2) Since then Horror Inc has said that they are interested in continuing the game once a settlement has been reached. Gun said that this statement was the official statement with regards to the game. This suggests to me that Horror Inc probably floated the offer to subsidize development once the settlement is reached. 
---
3) It’s been a year. Over a year since the first statement and almost a year since the second. Horror Inc has since abandoned the settlement process and gone all in on an appeal. That appeal won’t receive a ruling until 2020 with the possibility of it being sent back to a lower court and pushing it until 2022. Even then, the final ruling might leave the franchise in such a murky state that a rights sharing agreement might still need to be reached. At this point, there’s really no argument: Gun was right. No new content is ever coming out for that game and it’s not even their fault.
---
Mine is Plague92106, rank 15 David main
---
Personally, if you don't like him why talk about him?
---
that would be savage if they actually had a ranking system that worked and was based on any sort of skill or ELO instead of the bullshit they pass off as one.
---
Please remove this post and ban this account from the sub.
---
So what everyone thought legion was gonna be based on the trailer.
---
Thank you for your comment and feedback! Yes, even though I may not have specifics on how it could go about, I would think that some more options for interactions for both Killers and Survivors would add more depth to the game and the gameplay, could be simple things like hiding under beds as mentioned. I wouldn't expect more advanced mechanics like Deathgarden's Scavenger climbing over fences and dodging abilities to take place before perhaps a sequel to Dead By Daylight in which they would perhaps implement something like that, together with making noises on command besides the stone-throwing perk the Survivors currently have.
---
Yes, even though what I present is basic for the new mode, I do hold it would be great if they started testing around with this mode. I know there are many players requesting the mode for Dead By Daylight, and they already test it in Deathgarden. I think it could be awesome. Yes, I also think there is so much more to explore with new game modes in Dead By Daylight, the basic concept of the game has a vast scope of potentially awesome twists and turns!
---
I am aware there would be people who do not approve of a Nazi Zombie Officer cosmetic for The Doctor. I think in any case they could modify the armband which has the Swastika symbol to instead have an Iron Cross if they would prefer, or maybe blood covering the symbol(s) or even no armband and simply the rest of the outfit.
---
What I was thinking about regarding Ghostface is not exactly the original Scream outfit, but an outfit that takes more of a dark medieval-fantasy style with black ragged robes and a large hood, like the Nazgûl or the Gold-Hemmed armor of Dark Souls :)
---
Did The 75% Less Stagger Apply Or No?
---
You guys really undervalue the disrespect perk, its hidden feature is tilting Killers most of the time, then they get dumber
---
Disasterpeace kicks Assterpeace.
---
I'm a killer main literally look at my account and you'll see. These subs wouldn't be about hating on the bad killers/survivors it'll be about whiny survivors/killers hating the other side
---
One of the things that dictate a good killer is their ability to suppress their anger. If you just chomp on the bait that the survivor who’s supposed to distract you has thrown out then you’re just wasting your time.
---
Well you see there’s one scene in the movie...
---
They already exist lol
---
Gotta give the upvote, but what's he gonna do when he needs to hook, just drop the head on the ground?
---
Why do you run Bl and lithe Lmao
---
Personally, I would replace Rancor with I’m All Ears. I’m All Ears is a very good perk, and not just on Huntress like I’ve seen some people say. The ability to see exactly what the survivor you’re chasing is doing during a loop gives you fantastic intel on how to end it quickly. The survivors bank on you falling for their jukes- they want you to only have an assumption on what their next move is. I’m All Ears removes that and gives you the intel to shut them down.
---
I do get your point, tho survivors are unbearable in the post game chat.
---
I always heard of Stranger Things, but never really tried it out, though I wanted too.   
---
After the DBD crossing, I think I will give it a shot. Dead by Daylight is getting me to become a Stranger Things fan.
---
I sorta disagree that anyone using decisive strike should have a target on their back. I run it just in case I do get tunneled for instance. It’s the people that run at you with it active just so they can dstrike you that deserve it imo
---
The F 13 (RIP) community wasn’t like that in my experience but maybe I was lucky? It could also have been we were allowed to communicate via voice and not just text.
---
Keep in mind Nancy shot it a couple times before that and it barely flinched. Steve only managed to hit it and push it back into the bear trap where it was then set on fire. Getting shot, hit with a nail bat and set on fire and he’s still alive? I think he can at least withstand a pallet.
---
If you still DC to a Legion in 2019 you need a huge reality check

I never knew this meme template was from Stranger Things. I've never seen the show so now I know. Feel like I'm out of the loop.
---
Same. Running BT just about shows you aren’t a shitty fucking teammate, it’s so rare that when it happens I’m surprised and have a sense of loyalty to the tm8 with it (unless default Bill). I’ll usually sacrifice myself for them, people don’t understand that BT literally wins games.
---
I know, I know... but Evil Dead has that tree so...
---
I know someone else has already said this, but I’ll say it again; 
---
You’re a fucking idiot.
---
Found that guy.
---
I'm aware, I'm talking about BEFORE this came into effect. People datamined most of the future content that was planned and saw that tons of it was literally near completion or just outright finished, the 2 most notable things being the pajama outfit pack and Uber Jason, Uber Jason had animations, kills, his own weapon, and was able to interact with the map like any other Jason with the only thing missing being his music I believe. The Pajamas were datamined to be finished for all except the 3 new characters.
---
This was found several months before the lawsuit even came into play, Gun's biggest goal was to get dedicated servers out which I agree are important (though how they're fucking over PS4 players right now with them is a whole different dumb decision by the company), but that is not new content and they could've worked on that after the lawsuit came into affect.
---
The problem, at least in my view, isn't that no new content isn't coming to the game, it's that they already had tons of content ready to go, chose to trash it, and promise a bigger focus on bug fixes. Though so far it was found that the new content was a lot more finished then they led us to believe, the bug fixes are still coming at a rate of like 1-2 a year, and said fixes are doing more harm than good to the game.
---
Just add that to the pile of dumb shit the company did, along with accusing a fan of their game a pedophile, accidentally releasing new content on the Switch then pulling it, lying saying that there aren't bugs in their game that have been there since day 1, allocating bandwith from their most populated system to one of their newer ones, the whole Savini code scam where someone made literal $1000s off of selling an infinite amount of codes, and probably much more I can't remember off the top of my head.
---
Oh and watches.
---
I'm really confused by the caption.
---
I want the game but will have to wait so some of these terms are entirely new to me. I also didn't watch Stranger Things so I'm also very confused when people make references to things that happened in the show :P
---
Hawkeye mains Huntress. Change my mind
---
Hackysack?
---
True, hey maybe the bat wings from 2
---
Wait untill they do it, then don't lunge
---
Phew glad to hear
---
The dude in the middle needs to shut his mouth we were all once shitty players.
---
They are noobs if they haven’t experienced the game to the fullest.
---
Damn you for stealing my comment idea lol take my upvote
---
His addons have always had lore. Like, since release.
---
Don’t believe me? How about [this Monto video ](https://youtu.be/D83XuGtwQQg) which came out a matter of days after Freddy’s release.
---
Lol I couldn't resist when I saw that face
---
Yup
---
It's never appeared until a few days ago. And in Monto's Gen Protector Freddy Pt. 2 vid which I think was yesterday didn't say anything on his Red Brush.
---
I WANT THAT SHIRT! WHERE? Please...
---
Look at my edit.
---
My irl name is Claudette. Just a funny coincidence really and I ran with it
---
Probably 10-15 USD for the full chapter. PTB might be this Tuesday so we’ll know for sure by then
---
What is BI?
---
Why does it matter if you're good? Why can't we just have fun playing a casual hide-and-seek game where you run around in circles around a piece of wood?
---
The skill fetish in this game's playerbase is fucking disgusting. People who are slaves to the meta have no understanding of fun, myself included.
---
If you tryhard in this game you're just too shit to play a game that actually requires half an ounce of skill like CS:GO. I'm sorry to say it but running around in a circle around a piece of wood is to video game skill as making a grilled cheese sandwich is to cooking.
---
Don't shame people who just made their first omelette because they're not an "expert chef" like you.
---
Imagine doing obviously terrible as a killer and instead of understanding that you're new and not very good or having a bad game, you get to the end screen and its three people calling you garbage.
---
I'm really enjoying getting back into this game but there are some really toxic players.
---
Haven't seen it but now I need to. Maybe I'll do another one. I'm working on another idea already.
---
Bro, I thought I was fucking hallucinating, thank god I’m not the only one who remember the phone.
---
I think he got upset because i spawned at his hex and took it out at the start of the game.
---
Rant about what? Lol
---
Yeah. I had to put down the game for the rest of the night.
---
And then they proceed to claim you camped or cheated or that you’re trash because they insecure bout their own faults
---
Wow. I remember an Ace that thought he was invisible just because he was crouching. The thought of killing him felt horrible. I had to let him go.
---
Wait this is a thing?
---
The skill fetish in this game is fucking laughable. So many Bronze Overwatch Genji mains who think they're hot shit because they can run around some crates in a glorified hide-and-seek video game.
---
As someone who frequently gets to Rank 1 as both Killer and Survivor: this game takes no skill. If you have even a vague understanding of how it works you can break it. Stop fooling yourself that you're good at the game because you pallet stunned a Wraith once.
---
I love this
---
I don’t get it, what’s the joke here?
---
That’s a lot of reportable people there.
---
&gt;on PS4
---
Yeah tell that to the PC games where I queue by myself and my Rank 6 ass goes up against some poor Rank 12 Huntress with a bunch of level 1 perks.

Not Otz is the account he plays mainly DBD on, though.

do i have to change my flair now
---
So overcharge?
---
Take my soggy downvote!
---
If people are going around telling others to kill themselves on post game chat, thats an easy report and easy ban. It doesn't make much sense to complain about something that can be easily punished for, it takes 3 clicks to report post game chat. The problem is, most people don't report when they should but they always make sure to report DCers (which is not even reportable to begin with).
---
Go figure.
---
Sadly yeah it is
---
Thank you so much for existing. I'm perpetually going to be a casual player for this game. I love the game, I just don't have that much time &amp; energy for it. There's effectively no place for people like me in this community, but I'm still here.
---
Scottishness intensifies
---
If BHVR was Blizzard we wouldn’t even be able to win as killers by now when I think about it, unnecessary nerfs that only make it impossible to catch survivors ever...
---
Not only that but they help keep the game in the public eye. If we didn’t have licensed killers the game would probably be dead.
---
You won't regret it. I started watching Stranger Things because of this cross-promotion. Ended up binge-watching season 1 and 2 in over a week. Almost done with the third season. I will even buy the Ahoy skin, just because I enjoyed he show so much, even though I never spent more than $2.49 on virtual cosmetics.
---
If you haven't started yet, I recommend watching at least the first two episodes. The first one didn't hook me until the very end (kept pausing like every 10 minutes to do something else), then by the second episode I couldn't stop wanting to see more.
---
You put that thing back where it came from or so help me
---
??
---
Legion can be fun when you get those chain feral frenzy hits, but most of time you are going to be frustrated at how slow the movement speed Feral frenzy has, they need to buff it. but still get them for discordance at least, great perk.
---
Even if you don't care about Stranger Things are you saying you won't use or are not interested in the new perks? I wasn't that fussed about Ash but I saw it as a good thing for the game. The more content that can appeal to more people the better as it means the game will grow and be improved upon. Even if I don't like everything about new content their is always something I can find to enjoy.
---
DBD is right though. We shouldn't end up with people way better or worse than us. Problem is that we do pretty darn regularly.
---
People defending legion. Please enlighten me how you play versus them.
---
Just finished season three a few minutes ago. I didn't understand this at first, but lets just say I understand this a lot more now, and agree with it as well.
---
*when I get this game, I will appreciate this meme more. For now I dont have it and I assume a suck at it*
---
Nothing truer. My heart used to race and I died because the huntresses’ mori was so scary to me at the time.
---
I wish I could find the reply but I remember once when I made a post telling people not to harass new players I had someone tell me that they came to Reddit to ask some new player questions. The first reply on their post was someone telling him to "fuck off and learn the game yourself you're not a real gamer if you need someone to babysit you."
---
Again don't remember the exact wording but I remember him saying that he was called "not a real gamer" because he was asking new player questions as a new player.
---
End game collapse was something that was needed. I remember playing killer before EGC was introduced and some survivors would really waste 20+ min just hiding to hold the game hostage. Playing survivor during EGC makes the game feel a lot more intense at end game, which I find fun!
---
Tell him to stop eating it and start throwing it.
---
i put hundreds if not thousands of hrs into the game as killer, and my rank is only 17 or so, but not because of deranking but because my way of playing is much more fun, for me and everyone else:  just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
Read his comment explaining what it was, it’s above this one somewhere
---
I never knew what button to press to make the add on work so I never use them
---
*happy steve noises*
---
It's funny. I played last night on a whim and the killer was insanely good. I dont know how I ended up being the last one alive but he found me, stopped in front of me. I was too scared to move. 
---
They turned away from me and ran in the opposite direction. Stupidly I followed. Was I about to die? Be trolled? Nope. They found the hatch for me and backed off. Still do not know why they did it, but it was appreciated. Funny as fuck to watch them stop, turn around and make sure I was following them.
---
I've encountered a few people like this before. Two cases in particular stand out. There was a Huntress with 5k hours and had the rank 1 killer achievement in a rank 10 match. She brought iridesent head and just face camped two people to death with the me and one other person did gens and escaped. They told us "to choke on their fat cock" then directed us to look at their profile. Literally years of -rep comments for face camping and the profile description called it "the salt mine"
---
Another was a ghostface who also had thousands of hours in the game and the rank 1 achievement in a rank 15-10 match. He brought an ebony and tunneled everyone and moried them. His profile had hundreds if not thousands of screen shots of him moriing people. 
---
I'm sure there are plenty of others out there.
---
Ever since I watched JoJo's I cant help but see [this](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/274/tumblr_o5bwsfIVeZ1qzzsolo1_400.png)
---
Not in gaming, it's not.
---
In most general senses of the word, a Crutch is something to help people yes. A Crutch to help you walk, for instance, when you get injured and can't walk unaided. The crutch is there to help you until you get to the point where you can do it on your own.
---
In Gaming, "Crutch" is often an indication that the player can't win without whatever is considered "Crutch", and that using said mechanic/perk/item is keeping them back from learning the game. It's a First Order Optimal (FOO) strategy that players use because they either don't want or can't get better at the game (Politely, due to time-to-play issues)
---
To stay away from DBD (Because I know people will get hung up on *what* the example is rather than an example in general) the Noob Tube is a crutch in Call of Duty because it allows people to get kills without having any skill in the game whatsoever.
---
“Ranking” 😂😂😂
---
Youre right.  Lets never talk about anyone we like ever.  Oops! You just broke your own rule
---
I’m literally this person
---
Tbh I thought of that as a gimmick for chucky, the whole body swap idea I mean.
---
Except you could risk it and sabotage a chucky doll to remove it for a few minutes as a survivor. I thought that because she would be small, it would be hard to find the dolls sort of like traps, but they could make noises to alert players that it’s nearby at the very least (apparently the doll Chucky possessed came with a voice box, so it has lines it’s supposed to say).
---
I literally said in the fucking title I like him.  Can you read or?
---
This is the best meme I’ve seen on stranger things yet

Get it here

Vigo’s shroud, Alex’s toolbox...those guys escaped
---
I am not a "good" player, but I've been playing the game for over a year simply because it's fun. People take the game so seriously sometimes that they forget to have fun, and that's a damn shame.
---
I just kill myself on first hook when they have mori lol
---
I love this meme from Jimmy Neutron, but right now I am too **steamed** that this meme makes it onto the subreddit but not mine of The Shape offering you a boof 😂
---
So it has an eye patch and drinks alcohol while it’s mother continuously demands it get a job?
---
As killer main with almost 500 hours in this game I can say for sure that this game has the most toxic community I´ve seen in all the games I´ve played.  
---
  I swear to god, 95% of my post game lobby ( does not matter if I win or lose the match ) is filling with insults and cursing directed at me. Thats what we get when we give the player base complete freedom to say what they want with 0 repercussions, ppl are just awful.
---
It’s probably only a matter of time, lol
---
There is, but only spontaneously. It costs money to change your name so most people will do it if their friends are, but they aren't as dedicated as the PC cults.

Hey! Not true! I'm horrible and I still play!

Thats some good Bleen-g Bleen-g there

Bad things were a brewing lol
---
63 bloodwebs in on Huntress - still stuck on rank 1 Whispers and rank 1 Ruin.
---
In my experience the low ranks especially those above 15 are a nightmare for solo survivors filled with people who instant DC for just about any reason. Downed first? DC. People miss a skill check? DC. Killer they think is OP because they got spanked by one appears in a game? DC.
---
If they look like they are about to 360 wait for it then swing
---
I'm like the opposite, I've always been a classic horror fan but I have yet to watch stranger things. Probably will start in the next few days.
---
A compitent doc main can deny a loop almost as easily as a tier 3 meyers, in a different aspect. Shock to deny a window or pallet with timing, or (like with t3 Meyers) cause the survivor to panic and drop the pallet early. Sure no insta-down outside of MYC or devour nope on the doc, so less chase ending potential but if the survivor can continue to loop meyers after the tier 3 pop, the doc wins out.
---
 With loops they're fairly equal with meyers winning out because of the insta-down in his kit, but overall he lacks any real tracking in his power. Sure perks can kinda help out with this, as well as skill, but with the doc he can use his power for tracking AND in the chase, making him a bit easier to use, albeit not as good for the chase. Meyers only has that godly chase ending potential upon the immediate pop, and it diminishes after that once the survivors see the skull pop up on their HUD, and they start playing more stealthily to prevent their asses from being mowed.
---
They're about equal, with the doc winning out in overall potential and meyers winning out in chase potential.
---
Ok here lemmie just buy dbd then and start with 3 prestige characters because that's how we all were when we got dbd
---
That insidious is very suspicious
---
Holy shit imagine if this was with a bloodhunt. (What did you use btw)
---
I mean, shouts grunts and screams yeah. If you mean Ash style VA then no.
---
No, you would have to get a character to level 30, 35 and 40 to unlock their perks for everyone else.
---
Nope
---
Yay, new meme template
---
That would actually be pretty cool. Just a little, "a new challenger approaches" sort of thing to set the tone for the chapter.

CULT OF THE PEBBLE UNITE!

Based on what I can tell, Horror Inc caught them off guard one random day in June by telling they would authorize no more new content. I mean think about it: if they had been given any window or warning they would have rushed out whatever finished premium content they had (outfits and kill packs) the very next week and squeezed a little more money out of the product. The only reason I can fathom them not doing at least that would be because … they’re mean?
---
I know you want to paint Gun as the villain here. The thing is, there’s already a villain and it’s very much Horror Inc. They brought on this lawsuit instead of negotiating with Miller like every other company that has had to deal with this law. They were given two years to reach a settlement with Miller but they didn’t because they thought they had a contract and were sure they were going to win. Then that contract fell apart in the eleventh hour and they lost. [Then they put out a press release where they said they wanted to reach a rights settlement but Victor Miller just wouldn’t return their calls. ](https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3525391/horror-inc-statement-future-content-friday-13th-game-exclusive/) Meanwhile, Miller was absolutely interested in said agreement. After more than half a year of trying and failing to reach that settlement, Horror Inc decided to pursue an appeal anyway. With apparently no new evidence. That means they’re basically hoping the Supreme Court will declare the “Starving Artist Law” unconstitutional. At every point in this case, Sean Cunningham has acted arrogantly if not spitefully. You want a bad guy? He’s the bad guy.
---
I mean, Me and my Friend had that same Idea back during spring. A Killer with Ice and a Killer with Fire. Bad Ideas all around.
---
Ikr? I main survivor but when I play killer I just can’t stop playing
---
and btw, in 500 hrs playing this game I´ve never made a single friend here, I usually end the month at rank 1 as killer and at rank 17 as suvivor because i suck ass as survivor, it would be nice to find some good ppl to play with to show me the ropes.....
---
Behaviour doesnt take that toxic shit and im here for it
---
Honestly it looks like they tried that with his walking animation but it doesn't sell
---
At least she escaped.
---
SWF can completely counter it though. It's a cool idea, but It would need something else to it.
---
If im a killer and i end the game really quickly, as in down everyone with only one generator done, I'll usually head out to find the hatch and bring the last one to it, i dont mind pipping or not.
---
Shut up Jonathan actually looks good
---
Scam link
---
BBQ + DOC + Blood point offering + Bad survivors= Big Stonks
---
why dont you just play Steve and then pump all your BP into Nancy?
---
Agreed but swf counters tons, but the idea is that you see him but you don't register him as dangerous immediately, allowing him to get closer.
---
I love how his account is obviously centered around dbd and he got dogged on by the twitter page for the game he is a fanatic for

#Who would win?

Beautiful
---
As a killer i hate when people try to farm their teammates off the hook, as a hag i can still grab them off the animation anyways so it's fine but damn... if i miss then ive got a hit in on the farmer so i go for them if i can
---
This is why this game should have never had any form of leaderboards or ranking.
---
He's making us Pig mains look bad.
---
No shit
---
I concur. If players who play as killers are so good, then why do they do this? Because they’re not as good as they think they are.
---
Not really. They tend to stand where downing them will knock them into the escape zone.
---
Thank you!
---
wait, no... what's the opposite of that?
---
Lmao, getting banned for dc’ing
---
Not being on pc I wasn’t sure if it happened much to you guys.
---
Being good often times is a mixed thing given that, in order to consistently "Win" you need certain things good players have:  Think things like Ruin; near mandatory on practically all killers outside of the fastest ones and when you don't run it the game can be over in no time so you have no fun, while perks like BBQ and We're Gonna Live Forever make the grind easier to get such things.  This then loops back into a problem of how the "Best" players are the ones who simply have the biggest time investment as they have the "Right" skills unlocked to make the game easier so they can win consistently and be good.
---
I'm not even talking skills as it doesn't really matter how skillful you are because having the right stuff will bump you up rankings quickly, especially if you are winning consistently.  People like being competitive and being "The best" and that's their fun, let them have it.
---
I'd argue getting hooked and face camped every game feels like complete ass just like how getting only one kill in a 3 minute game before Survivors escape isn't fun either.  The game's pacing and skill level and all that is all out of whack.
---
Well it does
---
My whole point was that the lawsuit wasn't the biggest issue with the game ending up like this... thought I made that clear.
---
Ngl, I always thought it was just David playing football.
---
Laughed aloud
---
Couldn't quite tell, those were the only words we shared. Wouldn't surprise me if was 12 though.
---
Just further proves the point that they are completely oblivious to their own game. Sigh.
---
Be a change for the community. If a new killer or survivor gets owned in a match. Reach out to them, if you can, and give advice or words of encouragement.
---
We've all run into those new players who pick Nurse and get bullied all over the map. I've sent messages apologizing for the other players and trying to explain its difficult killer to start with. Unfortunately sometimes they turn off their messages, but my go to advice is always to look up videos to help. 
---
It will be rough, but we can help what little we can to help grow a good communuty.
---
It's probably going to be her Risky Business Halloween Costume from Season 1.
---
We could really use a less serious casual ladder.
---
"nah" haha
---
Disappointed oink
---
Maybe try reading.
---
The guy said the grind to get specific meta perks on each killer and maybe a couple survivors ends at 50 hours.
---
He then said that getting P3 on every character and unlocking every perk on each of them takes thousands of hours.
---
Look, I'm all for a seriously unreasonable witch hunt where we disregard what people say because we don't agree, but let's try reading their comments  properly before gaslighting them into next year.
---
Isn't the demogorgon sensitive to light?
---
The hag has eyes, tho. They're just sunken in.
---
I didn’t understand a thing, and I don’t feel stupid
---
I want the Starcourt showdown outfit so bad on god
---
What?
---
I’ve always thought that if they just took a page out of how Overwatch does things it would improve the game. 
---
Limits to ranks doing a swf so that rank 1s cannot que with rank 20s to bully lower rank killers. A casual que and a more competitive que.
---
Lmfaoooo wild
---
Twat
---
I really love what you did with Claudette's hair.
---
But it takes too long for pebble 🥺
---
It was bad, then it got worse, then the last guy just decided you needed a hug. Unfortunately your hammer didn't.
---
This looks eerily like the League of Legends streamer Hashinshin.
---
Unpopular opinion: This game *shouldn’t* be balanced
---
Thematically, it’s a horror game. It should be skewed fairly heavily in favour of the killer, because they’re, you know, terrifying horror movie killers
---
Sure, that kind of thinking ruins the competitive spirit of the game, but I play survivor just as much as killer, and I think it would be great from the survivor POV to actually be *scared* of the killer, not just because of how spooky they are, but because of how difficult they are to play against. It’s the same with Outlast vs Alien: Isolation - Outlast is spooky for the first hour, then you learn you can run past pretty much any enemy, or hide under a bed to shake off the ones you can’t simply run past. In Alien: Isolation, not only is the alien spooky, but it’s legitimately difficult to play against (particularly in Nightmare mode), and that makes it scary throughout the game. Dead By Daylight should be the same way - make killers spooky to play against, not just thematically spooky, and the best way to achieve that (other than with stealth killers) is to make killers harder to play against
---
Even so, she has clear eye sockets while the Demogorgon has a mouth.
---
&gt;The statistics they posted on the official site were collected from only ONE WEEK of gametime. I guarantee you that over longer periods of time survival rates skyrocket and 70% chance is being conservative.
---
The real stat was 43% survival rate. Confimed here, among other places: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bjzbi5/data_sheets_community_requests/emf6bzr/?st=jzowm4a9&amp;sh=24f4a0d1
---
Peanits has recently doubled down on that, saying **"They're still below 50% even if you exclude DCs, for what it's worth. The average kill rate for- according to kill rates- the weakest killer on the worst map at rank 1 is only 54.90% (45.1% escape rate). That kill rate only goes up from there for stronger killers and more killer favored maps."** - https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/621461/#Comment_621461
---
Hear that? The *worst* kill rate of rank 1 killers is about 55%! No, that is not only Nurse and Spirit, that is *all* killers. Even Wraith and Leatherface! And this is *without even taking into account disconnects*, which obviously only make that number grow.
---
The global escape rate across all ranks and all platforms is also below 50%. It does not matter whether you look at a week or a month or a year, killers consistently do better in the stats than survivors, and always have when BHVR presented any.
---
&gt;If the SWF population was really so small they would have nerfed it a long time ago.
---
But BHVR's stats tell us what the SWF population is: around 50% solo, 30% duo, 15% trio, 5% quad.
---
I don't care about your problems with pipping, because I don't care about pips as it is an arbitrary and in some senses absurd "rating system", but as for killing, no, killer is not that hard. Even the worst killer character on the worst map will more often than not kill at least 2 survivors. It has to be factored in that being a rank 1 killer does not mean you are necessarily being matched against rank 1 survivors, but you are certainly more often matched against red rank survivors than anything else. Good killers have no problems winning most of their public matches (winning as in killing 3-4 survivors).
---
seriously that’s the saddest thing I’ve ever read lol who cheats on dbd?? I mean  if the killer is that good get a safely pip and call it a day lol
---
except that the ranking system isnt really an indication of skill, jsut how much you play. You can get truly pepega survivors in rank 1 that play constantly, or godlike survivors at rank 15 that rarely play
---
iv been playing as Feng
---
Honestly I don’t get people who are like this, do they not realize new players are what keep a game alive?
---
This comment left by Hypertension Gang

The only downvotes you got are from killers who camp and tunnel.

I went with tapp initially. Until i read the rest of the perks.

There will probably be a sale on DLC around Thanksgiving if you can wait for some of it.

Survivors will always be pissy. Get used to it.

Benevolent Killer 8000 Blood Points
---
I'm quite excited about it. I finally found a TV Show, that at first, I'm sure I'll enjoy. I tend to be very picky when it comes to deciding which TV series to watch, and most of the times I end up watching films, because I don't have too much spare time. So that's a good start.
---
Idk if I'll even have it in me as a killer main to kill scoops ahoy Steve I love Steve in the show too much ;(
---
3rd: Playing Ash to get those groovy points
---
DCing on Bubba doing that only means he wins. At least make him waste his time.
---
Ugh. Same. It’s like we’ll fuck you too.
---
I would be a decent doctor if i wasn't so shit at guessing 360's
---
Yea, even still it can drag on for the killer but it works well in general.
---
Lol if I see him in that I'ma tunnel him just to scare him then let him go
---
Nancy has a perk that lets her heal one Heath state after she cleanses a totem, every time you do a totem you get a token then at max level you jump into a locker for 8 seconds and you’re healed, run this with quick and quiet and you can try for clutch heals in a chase/escape, borrowed time then maybe head on if you’re feeling froggy, this kind of build will focus you on cleansing for the heals and it means that you’re more likely to break noed before the end of the round.
---
get those 3 mentioned perks, easily the most useful in the game
---
Babysitter is a pretty good perk, however camaraderie is only useful once per match and second wind is basically like inner strength but worse
---
Not forgetting that fixated allows you to see your scratch marks (so you can see where will the killer see the scratch marks)  and walk 20% faster and better together allows you to see all survivors once a survivors is downed to see whos going to go for the rescue. But in all honestly it just depends on how you play so not everyone will prefer a perk
---
Not necessarily, I haven’t played very much myself ( Xbox ) but I’d say I’m atleast fairly well versed because I watch YouTube videos on the game and learn about meta perks abs gameplay strats.
---
What if noed was assigned a totem. And if that totem is broken during the trial, then noed wouldn't happen. And them buff the speed?
---
“We’ll be DBD because they’re safe
---
That’s the only map that doesn’t fully follow that rule, as they will be near corners but either down or upstairs
---
I've stopped complaining about noed most of the time. When I learned totems give 1000 points per clense and i can find all of them in the first 2 minutes with small game its not an issue ever.
---
I'm gonna start trying this! Sounds amazing.
---
They only hunt at night and their skin is sensitive to light
---
Playing with like half of the ultra rare add-ons and offerings isn't fun for survivors. They tend to just be DC machines. Probably thought you had the ebony mori. Like it literally removes up to 4 needed hooks to get a 4k. Really not fun.
---
Watching my friends fall for the same shiz I do 😂
---
When it comes to parking space or going across it, yes
---
faith in BHVR has been restored
---
I think you must be mistaked, legion used to be able to spam his power to down you which was super boring since there is no real interaction happening and it takes a long time for the killer to down you. 
---
New legion now can only injure you with his power, meaning that if he wants to down you, he has to actually down you with an m1 and mindgame you in a Chase
---
Lmao how are they purple ranks?
---
Let’s be honest: Regardless of if it’s OP or not, it’s just not *fun*. And that is what it boils down to. I can’t really think of any other Killer perk that isn’t fun to play around.
---
Nurse is scary so I don't blame you. Screw those assholes who gave you a hard time
---
i’ll try lol
---
r/murderedbywords
---
BBQ is currently available in the shrine of secrets if you have enough shards
---
Wouldn't help on two fronts;
---
- People don't currently cleanse anyway so it would still activate no matter what.
---
- Due to that first part, buffing the Speed would just be a flat out buff to the perk when it doesn't need it.
---
Also, that's not going into the fact that we've seen how "randomly assigned" stuff works in that you can try to take off a RBT only to have it be in the last Box every. Damn. Time.
---
That's what I've heard. Can't wait to start Season 1.
---
Flayed Billy would be cool, but he redeemed himself so i don't think the entity would have grabbed him
---
Yeah, I’ve been realizing this. I have been playing freddy a lot lately and it is actually rather uncommon for pallets to really do anything. It’s better if I run his pink addon that has everyone in dream world, but still not great. 
---
It’s funny when I get a cheeky hit because they thought the pallet was real, but it’s not nearly as consistently useful as snares.
---
Bro you just posted cringe... You are going to lose subscriber
---
So the reason the doctor is OP to low level players is because they tend to rely on stealth and not being good at chases. The trick to the doctor is to be good in the chase, as the doctor is not very effective in chase. When your a rank 20 and being emmersed is your go to and you die 20 seconds into a chase, welll.... good luck
---
And all the teachables unlocked
---
Probably the same reason silver and asthma inhalers hurt Pennywise/IT
---
Oof.  I play Huntress a good amount and I said out loud at :14 "CHARGE A HATCHET PLS ;\_;"
---
That's like the easiest hatchet throw ever - you're running in a straight line and there's basically no cover AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN LOOKING BEHIND YOU AAAAAAAAAH
---
When a survivor unhooked another survivor right in front of the killer to farm for points or two save them from getting chased.
---
Wait if they are in they own realms, how can exist wraithxnurse?
---
Ruin is free, no strings attached. Get 9000 iridescent shards, buy Hag, level to.. 35? I think. Same with PGTW. No gen regression perks are licensed at all yet. Other game-slowing perks like Thana and Sloppy are also on free killers. If you want the licensed perks for free, just wait for shrine and earn the iridescent shards in the meantime. There is nothing you cannot get through playing the game, sans the licensed characters themselves, and BHVRs hands are absolutely tied when it comes to that.
---
The actual licensed killers and survivors themselves forcing you to spend money is inevitable due to royalties. It's not really BHVR that needs your money for those, directly. They're forced to charge you for those so they can negotiate these deals with the property holders. I would rather they add iconic horror characters than not, even if they are forced to charge for them.
---
Point to anything that is locked behind a paywall that is not purely cosmetic or licensed from an IP holder. The cosmetics are, additionally, designed to not give a camo advantage (more than that, they are mostly quite flashy). I can only assume you just do not know what "Pay to win" means.
---
"Pay to win" implies that, by paying, you are able to access in-game features that give an advantage over **all** those that did not pay. Since all content is available to both paying and non-paying users, sans the licensed killers themselves, unless you feel like one of the licensed killer powers are unbalanced ***by design***, you have no ground to stand on. I emphasize "by design" because if a paid killer being OP is temporary and accidental, the game as a whole is not "pay to win" as bugs and other issues are not inherently part of the game itself.
---
I hope this helps you to understand.
---
More true that you know
---
Sounds like something a little kid would say honestly. I really can't wait until dedicated servers so DC'ers can just get bans already. It's the worst.
---
the survivors just never get the fact that theres no benefit to passing the trial
---
Honestly I think some killers like Demongoron should have some sort of unique built in perk to protect them from certain actions like say Demongoron is either immune to flash lights or have a built resistance to it.
---
I mean it has No Eyes at all so it wouldn't make sense
---
Looks like I'll be buying a cosmetic for the first time then
---
I winced at that first pallet - he gets hit and STILL drops it... then doesn't take the safe fast vault so he can fail to make the pallet he shouldn't use in the first place.  Man, what a clown fiesta.
---
- stated the scrool of truth
---
How does someone whatabout a video game
---
I'm still happy with the demogorgan but billy would've been my personal pick
---
I mean keys are as fair as moris pretty much
---
I find those are usually the only ones who talk so much shit. Puberty I guess.
---
any terms in specific? would be glad to help
---
Not the one you replied to, but i can just do something else for 2 minutes. It sucks but eh, it happens.
---
I FeEl PeRsOnAlY aTtAcKeD rIgHt NoW.
---
I don’t see the problems with survivors using keys
---
Dude like literally every game has toxic players
---
Pretty sure that last guy thought he could drop the pallet but got bodyblocked.  Even if he could have dropped the pallet the killer has Enduring and could just turn around and grab him off the pallet if he tried to slide across.
---
Keys and *ebony* moris are about as balanced as a democratic president
---
Sometimes if the killer is just too good for me, I’d rather take the hit for them and go down.
---
Maybe beside cooking mama
---
You don’t have to have skill to have fun. I can’t think of one game where you need skill. I’m complete garbage at Dark Souls and Cuphead, and even this game, and I still love them. I don’t care if I lose or my teamates suck, because it doesn’t matter. I just queue for the next game. And if the same thing keeps happening, I play a different game and then play DBD the next day.
---
You can’t dictate how people have fun
---
i'd personally rather have people searching for my totem and to be able to use my hex totem as bait than it do nothing before getting accidentally found after a few minutes like d hope does in most games. i don't think good survivors would run around cleansing dull totems for the first few minutes because the beginning is where the majority of matches are won or lost depending on if the killer's able to build enough pressure or not. that's why i run ruin, because there's almost always at least a couple of people who are gonna go look for it instead of doing a gen. if a totem counter was added and survivors did run around looking for totems at the beginning like you think they would, that would be great for killers because it means survivors aren't doing jack shit for generator progress and you'd be able to get someone on a hook before anyone even starts a generator.
---
Ok. I’ll just suicide on first hook.    
---
It’s not like I DC to just anyone. It’s the fucking cheap ass bubba build that guarantees me a depip, and minimal bloodpoints. As well as my entire team.
---
Not from Steve
---
I agree, the playerbase(more on console)doesnt have a huge playerbase, i usually always get matched with the same people 80% of the time at high ranks
---
If there was a Jason chapter it would’ve been the 13th one
---
I’m not, you can’t tell me it’s not frustrating getting paired with inexperienced players because of rank reset or the shitty rank system
---
do we have to buy this one or is it included ?
---
We need a larger sustained playerbase for that though which is the problem. Id love two queues, one that gives bloodpoints and XP and one that gives bloodpoints and shards directly instead of jist through the XP system.
---
The thing would work as the spy from tf2 basically
---
It’s not. Because I can just play another game that I enjoy and have a chill time, and later come back. Not every teammate is bad, so It’s not always going to get me to change games for a little while.
---
I like it
---
Gen - Generator  
---
DS- Decisive Strike (perk that allows survivors to stab a killer when bring dragged to a hook)  
---
Loop - Running around to waist killer's time, buy survivors more time to repair  
---
Mori - Nice lil kill animation you get with special add ons and certain conditions are met  
---
Toxic - 90% of the community  
---
:\^)
---
God Pallet - The pallet located inside the Killer Shack.
---
Mori - A special offering that can be used by killers that allow you to directly kill Survivors in the dying state if they've been hooked at least once.
---
Bloodlust - A mechanic that Killers have where, if they chase Survivors for long enough, their movement speed will gradually increase over time.
---
The 4% - Getting yourself off the hook by attempting escape, which has a 4% chance of working normally.
---
DS - Decisive Strike, one of Laurie's perks that allows you to stun the Killer if he picks you up within 60 seconds after you were hooked.
---
Slugging - Leaving Survivors in the dying state on the ground instead of picking them up.
---
Just a few. Are there any you want to know specifically?
---
Id love for there to be new players. Love showing them the ropes and helping them improve.
---
the movie would last 5 and a half hours and then abruptly cut out due to the killer disconnecting
---
starring: monto hatch king
---
this is so good
---
Face camping- when a killer hooks a survivor and stands in front of the hook watching them die; frowned upon
---
Tunneling- when a killer focuses on one survivor to chase and hook repeatedly without attacking any other survivors; frowned upon
---
Sandbagging- when a survivor causes another survivor to get hit and/or downed by body blocking or throwing down a pallet while they are being chases; frowned upon
---
Hook Farming- when a survivor unhooks another survivor while being chased by the killer or while the killer is close enough to hit them back down; frowned upon
---
That sort of person is convinced that they have never once been the reason, or a reason, for a loss, however. They have always played perfectly, and it is always their shitty team-mates or a camping killer that caused them to fail. You will not convince them otherwise. :/

Stranger Things' uniqueness comes from its characters. Everyone is so well-rounded and well-written and it's very refreshing. It may take a little while to get into, and the second season is a bit of a disappointment (though some people really enjoy it), but it's truly one of the best shows on tv
---
Nope. It explodes the gens and begins regression but that does not mean you are kicking the gens. Read Surveillance and PGTW. The gen must be kicked.
---
Just appeared at lvl 3 on my spirit.....
---
I agree with the strategy, but not being an asshole for no reason is even harder.
---
Ash would like to know your location.
---
That’s basically all PS4 players when Dbd came out in 2017. We were all bad including the killers. Dropping pallets without looking behind. Doing gens but sometimes not hitting skill checks.
---
Happy cake day!

Agreed
---
Not so much.  There's a lot of people that having fun and winning are pretty close to the same thing.  Every once in a while I'll meme it up but I like to win.  Even if I only get a 2k as long as I played well and earned those two kills (and the survivors actually earned their escapes) then I had fun.  Sucking at the game is massively unfun for me.  
---
Stop trying to think that you're better than someone else because they have fun in a different way than you do.
---
The statement that it "isn't fun" is a silly one.
---
 Just like it would be silly to say it "isn't fun" to miss an attack because of dead hard, or instaheals "aren't fun", borrowed time "isn't fun", DS "isn't fun". 
---
All of these things "aren't fun" if they catch you off guard. If you predict a dead hard, expect an instaheal, dodge borrowed, avoid DS.... or cleanse totems, then you feel a sense of accomplishment because you've outwitted your opponent and defeated their strategy.
---
So please stop using the "not fun" argument, it's supremely lame. This isn't a rainbow and kittens game where everyone works together to "have a fun time". It's an asymmetrical horror game where one side tries to kill, and the other tries to escape.
---
It's definitely worked on me more than once!
---
The killer are not more than toys to the entity, she always can have more
---
Freddy's new rework is alot of fun and hes really good too the spirit takes skill but is top tier and is my personal main and the plague I've heard is high tier as well
---
Spirit is more effective in every way.
---
But legion can be really fun.
---
Part of me going "BOOM, toasty" the other half is pitying the new player who will inevitably get stuck against camp killers who can't rank up because they suck at anything but camping.
---
You're not kidding about the messages, man. Before DBD, I played overwatch religiously and i thought that game was toxic... how simple i was back then
---
Leatherface for BBQ and Chili and Spirit for well, everything, are pretty good choices. Legion as well, but only due to my favorite killer perk, Discordance.
---
It is a valid argument when there’s so many people complaining about it. I wonder why that is? Let’s not forget the old Legion who was nowhere near overpowered but was just cancer for the community to the point no one else wanted to play.
---
It was a simple joke that was... and somehow still is being taken too seriously. Got people lighten up.
---
I dont know if this is a problem for any other platform, but here on xbox if there is a lag spike while struggling you'll just die. It kinda sucks. But yeah it's kinda just an annoyance and doesn't really add anything to the game.
---
My first (old) Freddy game I was running *Overcharge* and got called a tryhard. 
---
Some people are just born with their buttcheeks on their shoulders.
---
if we got hopper we wouldn't have got steve and I'd say thats a bigger loss than it is a gain. Hopper would have either been a stand alone survivor or maybe Joyce if they really wanted to do two characters for the chapter
---
Same here, but some toxic little bastards who shouldn’t be playing this game and mommy protects them from being called a little shit for the toxic behavior! You know when it’s a kid all by their profile pics!
---
Why NOED, though?
---
Freddy is fun and has good perks.
---
Not all of us. Most of us actually just want to have a good chase with good mind games and skilled dead hards, maybe one or two good ones. 3 kills and a race to the hatch. Or that LAST MINUTE kill out the door to just get your team screaming to "crawl buddy! Crawl!" 
---
GG. Fucken WP.
---
Occasional mori when it's gotten a bit frustrating. Feels good and cathartic. Sorry not sorry. 
---
I just hoped I made you jump or scream once. Makes this fun.
---
Where do I sign in for this gang? I think rank 13 is the lowest I've ever gone, but I'll be damned if I don't have a great time playing as Feng and my lil' baby Trapper. I'm also trying to put a dent in the toxicity by praising people after games. Some people are just a delight to spectate and it feels really nice to be able to play with and learn from them.
---
Not sure what the hostility is for? Never said I was better than anyone. If winning for you is the most fun part, that's cool. But not everyone plays that way. I brought it up because the original post said that being "bad" would cause people to leave. I gave my point of view that shows that no, not everyone cares about winning every time. That's all. You gleaned some secret meaning from that somehow.
---
But he needs to leave the locker to cleanse a totem and we all know that isnt happening.
---

Hmm I'm sensing you are new here, you could use survivor privilege 4 months ago but nowadays it has little impact as survivors have grown more toxic leading to killers being so aggressive they end up taking it out on people, ik I have done this once or twice, but I try to not be a toxic killer where possible
---
This is the new... "Look who's shittin' in the tall grass" isnt it?
---
And I'll keep that smile on my face as I'm getting murdered, as long as I made decent BPs.
---
Ramen is 25 cents a pop
---
Don’t tell Pug this, he’ll throw a bitch fit
---
It's not a valid argument when it's entirely subjective. Using Legion as an example is a logical fallacy, because you're equating a counterable perk (do dull totems) with a fundamental killer power that had no counterplay. Just because you personally don't find it fun doesn't mean it needs to be reworked or removed.
---
Jokercc_04 ps4 just cool people who wanna play some dbd have a mic also
---
The devs have addressed this. Dedicated servers are slated for later this summer, and once they are in place, they'll be able to deal with people who DC repeatedly.

David King for survivor. Blood points from his perk We're Gonna Live Forever are essential for grinding
---
But the original killers weren't movie killers. Plus, if it does end up becoming really bad to be found by there killer, they would need to nerf killers tracking perks since stealth is very difficult against see perks and just certain killers

r/watchpeopledieinside r/murderedbywords. This is getting posted.
---
As a rank 20 killer, in one of my recent games a survivor let the timer run out without mending, while I was chasing someone else.
---
This was also the game that ended with all four survivors hooked in the basement. But that's just the rank 20 killer life.
---
You get less blood points for camping than if you were more active instead of guarding a place such as the hook for the whole match since you would do more actions rewarding more blood points.
---
hell yeah it's ballsy, I'm just a total chad all around if we're going tbh.
---
I have eight of each Judith's Tombstone and Fragrant Tuft of Hair, and I don't dare use either one because I know if I do, I'm going to Lery's

/u/nwordcountbot /u/malchyom
---
That is a good point.
---
Upvote for you sir!
---
Just don’t take it personally. I’m a decent killer and get teabagged no matter what rank. Play with ghost face or pig and just teabag them back. Also run endgame perks such as blood warden. It’s always fun seeing them teabag until they realize they can’t escape.
---
"shitty ass new players"
---
*Looks and sees they are a survivor main, sees them running a toxic build*
---
They are downvotes. They dont matter and I wouldn't pay it any mind. You're entitled to your opinion, same as everyone else is entitled to disagree. And just because you dont like ST doesnt mean it coming to the game is a bad thing, that's probably why you got downvoted. Regardless of your personal preference ST is very big rn and a collab with DBD mean a huge influx of new players. That's great for the game and the devs.
---
Demolished💥
---
I don’t get why people hate on newcomers when they join during a new update, like you were all bad at the game, you will just some more, if you don’t like it, simple, just wait it out

The new face of fear
---
Ive been trying to watch it finally. Made it through most of the first season. I enjoyed it except for the countless scenes with incessant flashing bullshit lights. It got really old and boring because of that, so I didn't watch past episode 8 or so.
---
Nah, eat some clown crust. I know I will.
---
god himself
---
Noed isn't op. :NOT ONE BIT"
---
I look at it like a surv who drops their first pallet without looping and its god pallet or cow tree etc. It's not the end of the world it just shows how bad that surv is (obviously circumstances can occur). The same way I see killers using noed. It's not the end of the world (could easily cleanse) but most likely indicates the killer needs one hit downs plus bloodlust to catch survs. You said you can play at red (kinda idk) but when when I see ( pretty sure other players think the same) you using noed, I automatically assume that's the only way you got to your rank.
---

---
Dbd mobile lookin good
---
I agree. But as others, I am having concerns about how long the new players will stick around. It's not an easy game to pick up and friends I've recommended the game to gave up very quickly. As a new account, I guess it's just concerning to see -14 Karma attached to my account. Doesn't sound like a good thing.
---
Oh yeah, it was still great. The shift towards comedy was just weird.
---
I don't know if you watch anime obviously, but attack on titan was the same way. I was actually terrified the first few episodes, then the monsters were just...silly.
---
I prefer consistency. Though I suppose that may get stale for most people.
---
That last survivor's name made me chuckle.
---
Imagine getting so little attention in real life that you're only form of validation is ruining video games for others.  Go do some charity work.
---
I felt the same in Dark Souls. I loved the active PVP areas, *hated* fight clubs. I don't give a shit about an honorable duel. My goal is for you to die, I really don't care how. I'll use every scummy tactic the devs allowed invaders to use. That's the point.
---
Gonna need some ice for that burn
---
I get the idea behind their message, and I agree players shouldn't be dicks, especially to new players who keep the game lively.
---
But yeah no. The ranking system has always been trash, is too easy to rank up for most, easily manipulated by playing with friends, and resets constantly forcing you to play with newer players all of the time. It's very annoying, and I hate that they tried to act like they have any semblance of a real ranking system.
---
Lmao I also love these kind of messages. Make me laugh my ass off too. End game chat logs are the shit. You should see my steam profile back when legion was busted. Loads of hate comments lmao.
---
I had a game this Monday as a lvl 1 rank 17 Killer. This was against three P3 Claudettes, I wrecked their shit but they were doing somes serious high level circles around me. Ques are pretty fucked.
---
my thoughts exactly, this is me
---
I think I gave it a chance for 4 episodes... Just not my type of show.
---
we get it your were bullied in high school.  Go back to Angrypug's stream
---
Why do people freak out when new players want to experience the game? They may be bad at first but they will get better AND there will be more players.
---
&gt; Many are going to realize how toxic the community can be
---
Just the game itself allows for survivors to be toxic with crouching.
---

I only watch True. I dont even know who angrypug is my guy, lmfao

---
Karma means nothing, man. Fake internet points. Half the people with high karma just get it through easy "karma farming" bs, I wouldn't worry. And when it comes to player retention, that's how every game works. You have to be willing to learn how to play a new game, and some people just aren't up for the uphill climb DBD is. I've also had some friends leave fairly quickly citing the difficulty, but that's up to them to decide if they enjoy it enough to stick with it. At the end of the day it just means more money in the Devs pockets, which as far as I'm concerned is a good thing considering the amount of effort they put into this game.
---
What resolution do you play on? I used to use on 125% but after I turned off V Sync it made the game choppy but going to 100% fixed it.
---
I had an assassin build in DS3, and every time I invaded someone they would pm me (PS4) and tell me they will disconnect if I don't face them "LIKE A REAL MAN" and to stop trying to ambush them.
---
Dark Souls pvp community ruined that series for me, it used to be fun to invade and be invaded, then the death threats started coming in. Thankfully, I have more than just videogames in my life, I have never wanted to dox or bully other players, especially for playing as intended.
---
You know what I see when I look at We're Going to Live Forever?
---
Trash
---
Its not a fix tho. The problem is having to smash a button nonstop. Changing the keybind doesn't solve the issue. The only fix would be using a macro. 
---
Removing from spacebar makes it slightly more comfortable and less noisy to tap but the core problem is still there.
---
Aight, boys and girls im maining steve AND NOTHING CAN STOP ME well camping can but NOTHING
---
You rack up comments pretty fast for playing killer in a standard manner if your profile is open. Mine for example is just 10 pages of people copy pasting one guys salty comment.
---
don’t need to downvote since it got removed :)
---
Thank you for sacrificing your karma so I, too, could learn what the joke here was.
---
Nope, there's a steam setting to enable playing on test servers. You will have to download something for each game though.
---
They said they wanted it to be uncomfortable, hence the need to keep hitting the same button. To them it makes the player have a sense of urgency and intensity about the situation.
---
Wah wah
---
***I hope***
---
Well the game is dead. By daylight.
---
Nope. And I hope you know your comment comes across are very rude.
---
Dont do it
---
This is intentional gameplay sabotage, but if it’s worth the temp ban, go for it.
---
Its ok dude....we are here for you. No need to lie to fellow gamers.
---
I like stranger things, guess I’m cringe as well.
---
spirit, duh, because of her sexy
---
toxicity starts and ends with the individual. everyone can contribute to make a better community. just sayin
---
Eh. Some of the fanbase. Not all Ig
---
Thanks for being so cool and open for discussion dude. But Reddit clearly isn't for me so I'm logging out.
---
Nah m8 ill plead the 5th. Better yet ill make an alt account, do it till im banned, then just go back to leather face. Thats a better idea.
---
Lerys is counter productive because it makes your teammates hate you also.
---
I'm on PC and I get this issue too, not because of my platform though just because of my internet
---
To all the new players: Don't buy the game, 99% of  this community is atrociously toxic. :/
---
*but buy the game tho, I guess*
---
Not lying my dude. I get genuine joy from others misfortune in videogames.
---
Maybe saying that a chapter with two survivors great perks fun creative killer and bringing a lot more traffic to the game is something bad for the game what are people not allowed to disagree with you it’s ducking 14 down votes you’ll live
---
&gt;Scroll wheel. Literally easiest thing to use.
---
Still a repetitive and extremely unnecessary movement. If you play this game for a good amount of hours per week, it is almost impossible not to feel the effect caused by this.
---
Why would it be such a big deal to remove this feature? As far as I know nobody goes around saying "*I love the struggle feature on DBD, it really puts me on the edge*".
---
neither should exist tbh
---
As killer i will fuck you up so hard if i see that.
---
As survivor i'll let you hang on that hook till the cows come home.
---
Fuck you.
---
99%? I heavily disagree
---
As I said, I don’t care what you do. If I meet you in my games I’ll just dc and move on. I’m just saying that what you are doing is against the rules, but I’m not saying I’ve never bent a few rules...
---
Both outcomes can be expected, and I wouldnt blame you. But man will I be laughing.
---
I agree, I like the idea because then you could actually use some of these low tier perks and not be at a disadvantage.
---
Or maybe they put back in the more sophisticated perk tiering system (Red, Green, Yellow, Brown) and you can only use a low tier perk in the 5th slot.
---
Michael jordan makes every shot in the game but the game winning one, lost. You make one sloppy shot against Mike, win. See the difference. As a surv, if you camp me, I won. Trust me. I know you feel like you won and in your mind you did and that means I lost...but TRUST ME (as a surv main with thousand of hours from rank 20 to rank 1,consistently...and if you don't understand rank 1 then 100% I definitely win) you face camping me is not a loss. Maybe some survivors but you really shouldn't brag about face camping a rank 18 dwight. Even the killers will laugh...with survs... js
---
Im sure killers are just as bad. But I hate toxic survivors, usually its a whole night of shitty games, most of the time its fine. I always try to play fairly and politely but someone always has a problem with SOMETHING. Two of their friends are tbagging and flashlight clicking by a hook so I dont walk farther then 10 meters away? Apperently I'm a camper now. What do you expect me to do? Just walk into a corner and let you unhook? If you just hid I would have walked away. I hate camping. Its extremely unfun but now I have 3 survivors occupied instead of just one.
---
My favorite is when the game just isnt going my way, but I dont to anything that would be considered unsportman like behavior and I still get messages calling me names. I ALWAYS go out of my way to do "nice" things to survivors and usually let the last one get hatch, purposely not tunnel even though sometimes its the best option and let people heal up or drop chase when the games going too quick.
---
It really sucks, I like this game but the community can be awful. Looks like I'm spending the next few games 3 genning just so I dont get bullied, and thats not really a fun way to play.
---
Ok play just like normal game as surv (gen rush cleanse totems help other etc) and when exit opens u just run away.
---
Other funny build i play is no mither resilience sabotage and boil over (just destroy all hooks and bait killer to the corner 99% u just struggle away and u doing that again again again...) 
---
Other build but the worst or meme build is flip flop boil over unbreakable and tenacity (just play it like u want this build just sucks XD)
---
Sweet man, Dc's are what Im going for.
---
No, of course not, but you’d better keep running afterwards!!
---
i downvoted u because ur a bad man. but if u wanna ruin the experience, just focus on one survivor til theyre dead, repeat with next one, etc. thats when i dont enjoy a killer, when they seem to just focus on me and ignore anyone else til i'm dead. they should spread it out more. by the way, being a troll says something awful about you: it says that you're weak and that you're a coward. it's the opposite of a good thing for you. needless to say, you are anonymous, though, so your rep is safe. just saying, being a jerk is like telling the world that you're weak and cowardly
---
Did the killer let her go?
---
Keys and Moris  both need nerfs there both compete utter bullshit
---
The devs have already given their reasons as to why they won't remove it. Bitching on Reddit is pointless.
---
And I was starting to actually like this community
---
You can change it through game files.
---
Derankers and people who defend it are fucking scumbags
---
*Meg looks at Jash in disgust*
---
That was pretty cute Anna. Adorable even. Thanks for the tip tho. I normally already do that with Leatherface, just down and then insidious camp the hook, but I appreciate your input regardless.
---
Barb echo fighter skin pls
---
I’m giving you silver because what the fuck am I reading
---
Then you have serious psychological problems and I sincerely hope you get the help you need. Good luck and I wish you the very best in your mental health.
---
Lmfao that gave me a good laugh Johhny. Good on ya.
---
Imagine the mindset someone has to have to think new players joining a game is a bad thing. Like how fucking short sighted do you have to be?
---
4th: playing Ash because Buckle Up is OP
---
How would dedicated servers fix the dc issue?
---
 i never saw it. i never saw any of the licenses the game has used. maybe because im not  a fan of horror movies/shows. i watch sitcoms
---
The only acceptable DC
---
&gt;The devs have already given their reasons as to why they won't remove it. Bitching on Reddit is pointless.
---
I don't even know how long ago it was since they gave that statement. I agree that complaining on reddit isn't very effective but we do have many community moderators around here, perhaps they could raise awareness to the devs once they see that people aren't satisfied with the mechanic.
---
Lmfao!! Thats the best one Ive heard all day!
---
I hope they fix the matchmaking tho bc I’ve gotten a couple games in a row of just rank 20s on both killer and survivor. I was rank 12 tier 3 Myers and had multiple games of new players.     (I asked them+ let some win)
---
the worst is when, as killer, one survivor disconnects, then another gives up too. a game is more fun when its faster (without being too fast/gen rushing) so when u only have 2 survivors left im waiting for them to finish up since i never kill/sacrifice
---
Most people dont care. It isnt a huge issue and I cant see them catering to the minority over such a non-issue.
---
Yeah, but guess what Killers use their powers for? That's right? To gain an advantage! And I'd certainly hope the supposed "power role" would have their power favored over the number role's perks!
---
I love new players. I chase them around the map with Billy and "miss" them by just a little bit so they can see me run past them.
---
When I hear one hide in the lockers I try to open the locker next to them to let them have that rush as they leap out and haul ass across the level while I am closing the locker.
---
Plus they are predictable! It's great. You can do that horror movie thing here you chase them, and every time they look back your shambling after them, they turn a corner and don't see you come around so they think they've lost you. Meanwhile, you go around to the window and walk through. The survivor stares at the corner for a while is certain you lost them, then turns around and sees you lurking right behind them!
---
You get to reenact all of the horror movie tropes without just outright crushing them, and without getting some asshole trying to make himself look good.
---
BBQ it’s an over all better perk and it’s cheaper
---
Lol, rude? Bro that is so tame compared to other things you hear on reddit, lmao
---
Scam
---
I hope our toxic community pushes away new players. Lmao imma laugh
---
dang ;-;
---
You stab me in the back and imma stab you in yours
---
I like him too just know that he literally hates players like you and would tell you that you are part of the toxicity that ruins the game and community.  It's just weird to see you're a fan of someone who speaks out about your exact type of player.
---
It came with that outfit that has the sequin top and skirt I think
---
I would honestly recommend any new players start with survivor, for just a few hours of playtime. Just learn how the game works while your team hard carries you. Then once you feel that you know the basics, you can move to killer if you so choose. There is much less hate playing survivor since there is only one opponent.
---
It's the one from her chicken-hooker outfit.
---
Why do they look so happy getting stabbed
---
Id shrug it off. Hes not an idol or anything. Just someone I enjoy watching. Doesnt make his opinion of me damage me anymore than yours possibly does.
---
Perk boost idea: at level 3, cleansing a hex totem grants you immunity to the next hit. 
---
This would counter NOED, Haunted Grounds , Thrill of the Hunt, especially against anal beads Spirit.
---
Make an alternative account to help show thrm the ropes whrn theyre new
---
Nope just English, but if rhyming is your only way of understanding communication...Nah, I thought about saying I'd try but to give you more then a half thought is wasted.
---
When the gen explodes, you can't progress the gen. They do that bc that's how long it takes for the cooldown
---
I mean if thats the case, you shouldnt even be replying to me then my dog, lmao
---
Dude dc's should refund all offerings
---
i don’t understand
---
(Uses part 5 Jotaro like a scrub)
---
I mean...
---
I don't want others to get the game because I think tge game is bad. Yet I play it
---
But I liked the phone :( , couldn't they just show it when he moris people with a certain skin?
---
My dog? So rhyming is your only way of communicating! Those rap videos really did a number on you.
---
As long as you also have no problem with killers using moris than that is completely valid.
---
Try making a post somewhere like on Reddit or the official forums, that show I met my SWF
---
I was on my iPad at the time
---
Thats my "sorry I'm distracted watching forensic files and fucked up the skill check" dance.
---
At first it was funny, but after the leader got banned it got weird
---
Just take a look at this guys post history. He's about as boomer as it gets lol, no wonder he thinks that licensed characters are lazy.
---
Hard to take a guy seriously that doesn't think that EA's treatment of Apex's fans *isn't* a problem.
---
I had a hard time believing some of the SAW traps, I remember one with actual crowds watching and no one bothered cutting the victims free and faking that one of them died for the mechanics.
---
Others seemed like you could tamper with them and Jigsaw himself would have to come down to stop you, or they were the kind of thing that only killed you if you panicked (crawling out of barbed wire with a path left intentionally open, for example).
---
I think one of Amanda's other traps was more horrifying, the angel I think? Key in acid you had to dip your hand into, the trap actually implanted into your ribs, meaning even if you could escape you'd still have metal in your flesh.
---
I thought the survivor was a ball david was about to launch at the killer
---
So much purple.
---
Personally I love it. It kind of makes me think of a more robotic kind of killer which should definitly be an addition to dbd at one point or another! Nice wip.
---
I dont see anyone flexing. Are you flexing? Im not. Im just tryna find ways to make those same kids not have fun with the game is all.
---
Oh c'mon guy, you can't be done already! We barely got to the part were you keep trying to insult me back and then say something like " I have a girlfriend and what do I care about someone on reddit. " lol ok fine, I would noticed if you died...but really only to take your rare pokemon cards out of your velcro wallet.
---
This is a pic of part 4 Jotaro
---
Peppa
---
I mean it could be like a Trickster/Loki/Gabriel thing. He shoved them into this reality and made them powerless to mess with them. He killed Dean like 1000 times in Mystery Spot so it’s not that far-fetched.
---
I love when I run iron will to counter the killer but the killer has stridor
---
Only buy him if you love ash.
---
Yeah, but you’ll eventually catch up to me. I can’t outrun you.
---
This is some of the For Honor fan base. You have your select few who really love helping new players instead of using them to rank up or blaming them when they lose a game.
---
So much this.
---
You know how long it takes to crouch all the way down the stairs, to the hook, unhook them, and crouch all the way back out of the shack?
---
Especially if the Hag is using trigger range addons, or traps the doors and windows too.
---
Hag can just come back - she can just come back from like fifty meters away and you will still be in there because she moves 4 times faster than a crouching survivor. She'll be there, and have gotten Make Your Choice on you and a Devour Hope token for the unhook and just smack you both down.
---
I *really* hate how trap webs can be large enough that even Urban Evasion doesn't help you get out before she reaches you, and you can't even flashlight the traps because that notifies her too. You have to sprint out of the basement and hope for the best.

“dude cmon, remember 4 years ago when I bought you McDonalds that one time?”

It's alright to lose pips. Don't focus on rank because it's literally pointless. Just look at how to improve for next game.
---
Lolz I used it cause he that is what he wore in part 4 won’t make much sense if it was him in the past
---
Oh shit, you're right. They even had a scene where Max scared the kids while dressed as Michael, so there's a very good chance Steve could recognize him. Season 3 also takes place in 1985, one year after the release of A Nightmare on Elm Street, so it's possible he could recognize Freddy too.
---
Dude 100 % that's part 5, the colors aren't bright enough to be 4

Probably no buffs. It needs to be reworked entirely because it's design is unhealthy from the get go.
---
I actually like Lerys! But I get where the hate is coming from. 
---
Put in ‘The Game’ as an offering. Had a friend, who burned it, disconnect cause he got triggered that we got triggered.
---
Don't stand in the open gate.
---
She is going to come to the gate, if you're just standing in there, everyone else will die.
---
Get out of the damn gate.
---
"Oh she's at the gate I have to leave now, sorry."
---
People just want to play at their best, there’s nothing wrong with that. If they could improve the ranking system it would fix a lot of problems
---
I mean they also need to keep the lights on and paychecks
---
Don't get me wrong, i really couldn't care less what you want to do in game. Play however you want.
---
But real talk...that's pretty clearly socipathic.
---
It's called Schadenfreude. Taking pleasure from other peoples pain or failure.
---
It's usually caused by low self esteem,anxiety,depression, or lack of validation in one's life.
---
I know you claim to have a great life and all, but if that's a big source of entertainment and pleasure for you, maybe you should really consider therapy. There may be something deep seated that you don't want to admit, or are unaware of that is affecting you.
---
them when you eat their finger: \*goes to the nearest trash can or toilet\*
---
Well the strangers things monster is coming to the game, makes it seem that some kind of communcation is happening from BHVR and Netflix.
---
He’s not even our Freddy
---
Gg ez baby killer
---
And that’s why you play good killers, so BM isn’t necessary and the survivors can flame the fuck outta ya if you loose. Everybody Wins!
---
Tik tok is Vine 2, plenty of good content on there. You just have to let others watch the trash for you to filter out the good stuff.
---
I've had some really funny moments where I shake my head no at the rescuer while camping. 
---
If they shake their head "yes" then I let them get the save and escape
---
Why though?
---

---
This. I was a rank 10 survivor on PC and ended up with red rank survivirs and a red rank killer.

God-tier meme
---
"I dont know how to spin this in my favor so I'm just going to throw out some insult to make it seem like I'm still right."
---
Can you hear that? It's a crash followed by a long whistle. What is that? Oh, it's the last bit of credibility you had, along with the last shred of respect I had for you. How odd.
---
more cursed than blessed
---
Thats just a license.  Not a partnership
---
So what’s your valid counter other than “they’re not the same” Mr. OG Console master
---
You deserve nothing less than a lifetime of vitriol and scorn for this creation.
---
I think we've all had the moment where we t bag the exit gate without realizing how long the exit path actually is. We t bag, killer hits us, we go down and realize we're still 5 feet away from the exit. Oops lol. 
---
And one time I locker stunned someone and got so excited that I went back into the same locker....it actually worked too lol.
---
Yes but whos to say this couldnt lead to something more in the future.
---
What about the story of the Spirit who had their rice burn
---
Cause why not?
---
A roomba
---
The only urgency and intensity about the situation is the fact the killer may lag and I die.
---
Tbh the most fun I have in this game isn't whether I live or die, but if there are ups and downs throughout the match and I feel like a bunch of cool shit happens during a match.
---
Its a game. As I stated somewhere else, if someone came up to me, and told me their dog died, or something else horrible, id show empathy. It wouldn't be funny. But this is a videogame. Who cares if I ruin someones fun? Its inconsequential, and gives me a good laugh.
---
ur literally a weirdo
---
28 STAB WOUNDS
---
Demogorgan is here to stop them
---
Eh, whatever, i'm not gonna try to argue against you.
---
Yeah if he’s a high rank then he is a sh**y a** new player 😂😂
---
Old DS&amp;MOM: instant reward, with no previous effort needing to be put in.
---
Cruel Confinement: _possible_ reward with, admittedly, no effort put in.
---
The difference is DS and MOM were guaranteed, Cruel Confinement is just the possibility of a smaller reward. It has the potential to be strong, which is fine as a Killer perk. They are meant to be stronger than survivors. It's not supposed to be "ez." Maybe you should take a break if you expect the game handed to you on a silver platter everytime. Escape is not the default outcome. Some people need to remember that
---
Smart man
---
I think that’s a pretty good idea. If you’re running two different hex perks (for instance thrill of the hunt and ruin) you’re going to prioritize your ruin since it has the most effect, but currently it’s impossible to know exactly which totem is which. To be fair though, I’m sure behavior didn’t expect people to be running so many hex perks since they can be destroyed so I can understand why it’s not a priority.
---
You act like it's all fun in games but there must be seriously mentally wrong with you if you get off to causing people pain and anger. No matter how good your "life" is there is something wrong with you. That's why people are suggesting you seek help. It isn't some joke.
---
Huh it's almost as if half the streamers do this and everyone supports their choices to do so. Odd.
---
Thanks, I guess
---
I tried joining my friend while loading out of a match and I had killer perspective over me, then I tried joining him again and that happened
---
If people get angry enough at a videogame...a videogame, then I think they might have some issues of their own.
---
Is it just me, or does that girl look a little like Eleven?
---
*Cackles in Nurse*
---
*Cries in low rank*
---
Also going back to edit an actual counter into your argument is pathetic. I'm done talking to such a vitriolic little shit lord. Learn at least _something_ about game balance before you spout bullshit online please.
---
It’s when the killer is right behind you and you make a hard u-turn into them and trip them up. It’s a legitimate strategy!
---
same here , played for two days, now i got a error 8013 code
---
Eleven survivor confirmed
---
I'd like a Frankenstein monster type cyborg that got created by a mad scientist and was forced to do darker and darker things until the Entity snatched it. It would fall under the category of the "pitiable" killers that weren't truly evil.
---
 An AoE spin attack that hits everybody in lunge range would be there for just countering close range jukes and grouped up survivors. A less jukeable Leatherface but only one damage state and no instadown. Imagine blades for arms and the killer charges up and then spins. 2nd ability would be sensors, placed like Hag/Trapper traps (or cameras you could place on walls) that track survivors and reveal their auras when they enter certain areas. 
---
Might not be strong enough since it would just be an M1 killer with strong tracking, kinda like old Freddy but less counterable.
---
Why would it if its not a partnership?  Theres a stark difference between a partnership and a license.
---
Accurate. The amount of times I have had to delete BM comments that get left on my steam profile after I play a casual killer game doing dailies .. the salt is real.
---
dude im not here to argue.
---
I had a meme like this  I love that clown sucks fingers
---
Don’t even chase, just sneak up and grab them. It’s way more fun that way.
---
That's like saying you have a chance at a romantic relationship with your babysitter because your parents paid her to babysit you.
---
i like this too. were you thinking of the movement from one to another being similar to freddys gen teleport?
---
I got lucky with that because it happened right as I was making a huntress build so I got it anyway :]
---
Possibly.
---
Mmm no, that's WAY too strong. That's like a killer being able to multi-instadown people across the map
---
Just finished watching season 1-3 with my wife in two days just to get ready for the chapter.
---
No I want this game to grow and your being toxic go away it's people like you no one likes ingame you might be nice in real life but not in game
---
Sadly that won’t happen until they seriously (and I mean SERIOUSLY) start focusing on game health. I realize dlc is their primary revenue bringer, but there are reasons why other devs have essentially killed their games by setting these tiny dlc deadlines. COD is basically a joke now, and a big reason why is because instead of focusing on quality they just want to push out as much product as they can. 
---
Do people want dlc? Yes. Of course we do. But I’m willing to bet we would have more people interested and appreciative if they slowed down a bit to ensure quality. Console ports are getting to be virtually unplayable levels, and yet they want to release to another console and now are on mobile. You can say they have separate teams for those but you can’t keep spreading the team thin, and expect everything to be perfect. They need more people working on development, and focusing only on game health and bug fixes.
---
Exactly my guy! Finally someone with common sense. Thanks Doge. Only a meme would understand
---
&gt; a videogame
---
Is this really the only justification you have? This is your excuse to being a toxic pile of garbage? You know I don't get why you think it's so simple to "not get mad at a video game lol" it's like you don't even understand emotions to begin with. 
---
This game is a salt mine, in otherwords get off your high horse about not getting angry at a video game. And why would they have issues? You are essentially telling every single person who gets mad they have mental problems, while you are a person who ENJOYS making them angry. There's no motive, you just play this game to make people angry and miserable. And you have the nerve to call those people mental? Yeah, no wonder you have mental issues. Most of the time people try to deny it and they blame it on other people.
---
You're messed up.
---
Can we get that as an ingame cosmetic for Steve? So we can play as him wearing a shirt with himself on it?
---
Okay... really really *really* strange analogy... but i guess i see you're point. Doesn't exactly mean it will never happen, which is literally all i said. Sorry for some optimism, i forgot this was reddit and everyone is shitty and pessimistic.
---
I can’t wait to play as Nancy!
---
Lmao
---
I hope he has some seriously transformative addons in general since his ability doesn't seem like it can get any real addons besides statistical improvements.
---
Pretend to be afk the whole game then noed everybody around you. Have bloodwarden equipped. Hook someone if they open gate. 
---
Try to get all 4 slugged eventually and let them and let them bleed out. 
---
An idea I had. Never tried it myself but seems like it would be funny when it worked. Probably have to be patient and get the right game but maybe you’ll get lucky idk
---
How old do I have some big ass dogs
---
I’m getting rank update error every game, I’m only pipping in like a third of the games where I should. It feels weird bullying a billy who backs like fifty times at one pallet and honestly it stops being fun
---
I feel like even new players realize how fucked the balance is.
---
I swear I heard in the developer update that they said theres an indicator for the killer. Like the bar flashing or something. 
---
Cause I remember thinking "wtf really?" 
---
Atleast with it pausing it might not be noticed very fast but an indicator just promotes camping. And also means they come back to look for the person nearby and now the others wont want to risk trying to save you
---
Youre very quick on assumptions. Simply being mad at a videogame shouldnt make people have issues, mental or not (didnt even specificy mental issues, so if you wanna keep shoving your agenda in my mouth, thats your problem). People getting so easily triggered, upset, disorganized, flustered, whatever word you wanna use, over a dude standing at a hook for 5-6 minutes in front of them, thats the issue. Thats scary. No backbones, no ability to shrug it off and just move on. A post must be made, a comment must be typed. You can find the same attitude in LoL, Dota, Overwatch, R6s, CSGO, ect. 
---
Also very bold to assume my mental health at all, given how few facts you actually possess, but Ill commend you nonetheless.
---
I got a near perfect game during a bloodhunt with 5 Bps and got around 300k Bloodpoints
---
Looks like someone had a few frustrating matches against the doc.
---
https://youtu.be/7_yixIT0p58
---
Loads of people. I see this complaint in almost every community, regardless of size. It’s baffling.
---
Or... Hear me out.... We can farm blood points together.
---
Not really just a joke
---
That actually sounds fucking brilliant lmfao!
---
Just started playing this a week ago. My friend said the ranks reset once a month which would mean for like a week the best players are paired with the worst?
---
Neither am I?  Just pointing out that dbd has much of a partnership with netflix as it does with the halloween or nightmare on elm street creators.. Or leatherface etc
---
Which killer?
---
 post why they keep nerfing survivors  and noed bad nr584839388 has arrived
---
Total Rebel and Fuck This Place would give you a max +45% sprint speed. You would be faster than the killer
---
It’s a shame this game’s player base is so fucking toxic. That being said if you put in the time to practice and get good, it’s rewarding spanking those shitlords.
---
I'd be interested in a one-shot dash with a longer stuff and/or one that changes his portals into something more useful
---
I’d like his ability to be a chain that could automatically pull downed survivors to hooks and like a charged ability that if timed right could be used to damage survivors using vaults.
---
Once had a survivor struggle the whole time, even though the Bubba was obviously waiting at the top of the stairs. We we able to do the gens and escape because of their sacrifice.

No

---
Devil's Advocate - Pallets within 9m of you is a tiny range, they almost cannot spawn that close together.
---
Hair Trigger - Just to confirm, good skillchecks would then REGRESS the generator?
---
Total Rebel - Just not being currently doing a co-op action permanently disables BBQ and Chilli, seems balanced.
---
And for both Total Rebel and Fuck This Place, before even considering they stack, YOU MOVE FASTER THAN THE KILLER. There's no stipulation of being disabled in a chase, in proximity to the killer, and it hardly matters since if you see a killer across the map and run in a straight line away from them, they actively lose ground.
---
Yea i understand that But the difference is Netflix is a production company. They literally make movies and shows. Literally all i'm saying is " you never know" but i guess you do.
---
What was that robot from Futurama that likes to stab people?
---
&gt;Youre very quick on assumptions. Simply being mad at a videogame shouldnt make people have issues, mental or not"

Oh that's funny, you outright said: "a videogame...a videogame, then I think they might have some *issues* of their own"
---
I was talking about mental health, if you weren't talking about that then why would you bring it up? Nice try there dude.
---
&gt;  so if you wanna keep shoving your agenda in my mouth, thats your problem
---
What agenda? Me, asking you to get help means I have an agenda? Okay sure, then my agenda is for you is to show some compassion for once in your life. You have to lack basic human decency to play games to ruin people's moods.
---
And yeah I'll assume your mental health considering nothing seems in favor of you being a good person.
---
Don't take everything so seriously, it's a joke.  I'm not saying it's a 0% chance just unlikely.  It seems to be far more likely that the license just gives BHVR the ability to use the likeness of the characters and whatever other content is agreed upon. But honestly,  who really knows?
---
Something that boost his warping maybe make it so an ebony add on let's him warp a will with no cool down and have his pounce once shot survivors and let him change directions during the pounce or increase distance
---
I could see them making portals instant, making the lunge pull then into the upside down, attacking out of portals, or portal traps.
---
Oh this will never happen, trust me. Just having fun with ideas tbh. Life is Strange in DbD? Yeah fuggin right.
---
Not like... we have Nea and Meg or anything...
---
who has this much hatred in their heart? lol
---
AGI is fine. If IG didn't exist, it wouldn't need any changes.
---
As things stand, with both perks existing, they just occupy the exact same space, which is a problem.
---
Thought process is like so.
---
1. IG's identity is something to help you carry bodies a long distance.
---
2. AGI's identity is something to help you transport bodies quickly, but because of flawed implementation it encroaches on IG's indentity, making it so IG is never used (except on top of AGI) because AGI does its job and more.
---
3. Change AGI so that it reduces carry time proportionate to its increased carry speed.
---
4. If you changed it like that, it would be complete ass with its current modest values, so crank that shit to 11 and see how it goes.
---
5. Now that IG is the sole carry distance perk, buff it up a bit to match its former glory.
---
6. Fix what's broke, if anything.
---
Okay?  Same chances as them partnering with disney.  Licenses have nothing to do with partnerships.  It "could" happen the same way they "could" get beyonce as a killer.  Why would it just because it could?
---
You always have a plan Dutch
---
Oh, I’ve never done that. I usually just run in circles.
---
When the perk name fits better than you thought...
---
Good point but dude,  I got a quota to hit.
---
It's not a bad animated movie but for some reason the kids in the schnitzel scene... aren't normal.
---
I've been wanting that black hat outfit for David King but I just can't justify the price.  Especially with how long it takes me to save shards(I still can't afford it) but if I'm going to spend real five dollars, I might as well buy proper DLC for the game.  
---
Can I buy DLC in game with shards?
---
I wonder if I play so late at night that there isn't enough traffic to cause this to happen.
---
Dead by Blackcat
---
Well it is nowhere near a leap in logic as big as your beyonce example but sure give us Beyonce as a killer, we need some truely terrifting. I am however fully aware that licensing has NOTHING to do with a full on partnership, but is it so far outta left field for a production company to show intrest in a game filled with cheap orginal characters? If you think so than okay man, i just don't think it is.
---
CRINGE !
---
Generally survivors, but killers have better situational perks.
---
Noed is insanely strong, and a lot of survivor perks can be very strong.
---
Its usually a case by case basis and survivors are getting more balanced
---
This is completely unrelated to anything of value in the conversation, but: fazed.
---
Prayer beads spirit. Eboni Mori. Literally any 4 perks you want. For full toxicity get Franklin's/noed whatever suits you. 
---
If you realllllly wanna do it right tho you gotta throw games until you're rank 20 again. Get the noobs and non tryhards. 
---
If you wanna tunnel one survivor until they die that always gets people angry. 
---
Let's see you said you were over camping... Oooh pretend your gonna give them the hatch and then shut it in their face that's a good one. 
---
Ask if they wanna farm and then use bloodwarden or slug at the very end. 
---
I'll let you know if I think of any more.
---
Never has that happened and dbd probably wont be the first place it does
---
Congratulations, you’re a prophet.
---
No dude he’s gotta win HoH.

Shit man thanks. Appreciate the help

Why would you ruin a perfectly decent meme with an emoji in title

---
I'm just trying to think of what I hate lol. I'm no good with Billy but if you can use him or nurse that's some quick DC's usually.
---
It's a great homage to the 80s definitely worth a try even if you don't end up liking it
---
Feel you. I think I've had a similar idea on David where I want to run No Mither and all the perks that take effect when you are injured, but I realized I only have level 1 No Mither on David and it isn't showing up.
---
I don't watch the show but I like it cause he's got a cute sailor boy outfit.
---
Lol @ people talking about the "community" being bad. I promise you it's not DBD's community. These sorts of people exist in every single online orientated game. Gamers in general have tendencies to be some of the shittiest people you will come across online.
---
&gt;&gt;!'tis a daily, nothing more!&lt;
---
Did you run out through the exit gates and out of the map, or did you run to the end of the exit gate to find big black entity spikes blocking your exit?
---
Me like these.
---
The terror radius one sounds more like a purple, strong, but nothing interesting.
---
Pallet break is something we've seen before, so i could understand this, though with a bonus effect (legions was a lot better)
---
Blood trails seems like a purple, less so than a pink
---
The upside down one makes a lot of sense, but it'd be stupid broken if the killer just decided to not use portals.
---
All 4s sounds fun, though im not sure how well you'd balance it, maybe give the portals a longer cooldown and give him legion-style sense?
---
Roar sounds interesting, maybe on hit it'd apply status as well?
---
I dunno, if I go down with the gates open it's a death to camping, a mori is at least more cinematic and fun than that.
---
There are no rank rewards, I would switch lightweight for adrenaline

They actually did take a lot of risks and people hated it. The duffers have talked a lot about that.
---
I wish Pig had some cool addons that completely changed her bear traps. I.E. Rules Set #2 could be a shotgun collar that gets progress on it for whenever you're doing interactions. 
---
That, or fitting with Amanda's perverted views on Jigsaw's game, have an Ultra Rare that actually makes the trap inescapable. I.E. NONE of the Jigsaw boxes are the correct one, and you only get one trap (And a HARD cap at 1. You can't combine it with Last Will for two inescapable traps.).
---
Probably would be deemed OP since it's a literal death sentence for one survivor unless they can grab hatch. Then again, it completely deletes your stall (Well, besides the trapped survivor who will likely check every box only to find out none of them have the key) and there's arguably other more powerful addons like Prayer beads spirit, Tombstone Myers, Iri Heads, etc.
---
I haven’t unlocked it yet. Right now I’m trying to get bond with dwight
---
"if you get hooked you can't loop"
---
You can buy any character before ash for 9000 shards each
---
At least I can take NOED out of the standard lineup now... jk I don't use NOED they barely ever make it to the endgame anyway!
---
I'm not speaking for the OP, but I'd assume it's the same scenario. For me I've had it where I ran WAY past where you lose control of your character and have escaped, only I still had control and nothing changed. I had to return to the map to find the hatch but I couldn't and got game ended by the end game
---
yep.  Exactly my point.  Low tier university and Dead end job 😂.
---
If you look it up, the original video is literally 30+ mins of them dancing, it's actually amazing.
---
Who’s the killer?
---
Is there a rule that u can't talk about people that you don't like?
---
If you really want to do a toxic build:
---
3-gen Doctor with Distressing, Unnerving, Overcharge, and a Forth Perk. (I use BBQ but you could use Dying Light, Franklins, etc.)
---
Use a jigsaw piece. 
---
I mean if you're going to be "toxic" I find facecamping boring as shit. If you're going Insidious Leatherface at LEAST do the basement chest protection strat because I find that more engaging than simply facecamping everyone one at a time. 3-gen doc is at least engaging gameplay. 
---
Endgame build isn't exactly toxic but super cheesy as survivors expect a relatively easy escape only to get stiff-armed at the end if everything falls into place correctly (Which it often doesn't, but it can sometimes happen!) Rancor, Remember Me, NOED, and Blood Warden. 
---
Get your Remember Me stacks on the obsession, and just follow him around once you're full or be near him when the last gen is about to pop. Instadown and Mori him with Rancor so he can't get the door, and "We're In The Endgame Now." With the obsession dead, clean up with NOED and Blood Warden. 
---
Hag with Franklin's is another funny way to annoy survivors as you can trap their flashlights or other dropped items. 
---
I can't think of any other real "Toxic" or asshole strats/builds but facecamping/tunnel-mori is pretty boring. At least try and be original. 
---
I will say Doctor is the best facecamper in the game though, better than leatherface as you can spam M1 in treatment mode at the hook and you'll auto-grab rescuing survivors.
---
Too bad
---
If you teleport to a trap they are working on it automatically injures them, maybe
---
Not sure if witch hunting. But here goes. Ther'es at least some positives in here about him. 
---
Normally he fits into the "toxic but entertaining" gropu of streamers that every game has. I've watched him for a while, don't like the way he treats his chat who don't THROW money at him, but he's still entertaining. He normlaly doesn't sandbag too often, he DC's against almost every single Nurse possible and as a DBD player, I don't blame him for that one, a good Nurse is going to 4K and there's nothing you can do about it as a player, that's how powerful the Killer is with a littlet ime spent on her. 
---
BUT...I will say, Friday Nights he does his big BBB shindig, avoid taht shit at all costs if you don't like him. He becomes a lot worse of a person, especially towards chat. If you aren't someone who has subbed to him for more than 6+ months, he treats you a lot less of a person than he does other people who just throw money at him or sub to him for a long time. There's stories all over reddit about how he'll tell 6 month subs that he doesn't care at all about their money, ban the person, call them names, say rude things about the person, tell them to have a good life living in mom and dad's house, etc. The guy literally tells his own subs that he doesn't care about them, and bans them if they haven't been subbed long enough. 
---
The worst part is that he is TREMENDOUSLY strict with his chat. If you say ANYTHING that he doesn't agree with, you're banned from the chat permanently. There's only a few exceptions, and tha'ts if you're DEBATING with him on sports without pushing too much against his opinion or getting any information too wrong because he'll accuse you of knowing nothing about sports and ban you, OR if you're a long-time subscriber of a big donator, then he'll overlook it once or twice, or just 24 hour ban you. I've seen him ban for an hour or so sometimes. Usually a ban from Pug is followed by a statement such as "There, you can shut the fuck up for a night" or "Now nobody has to hear your stupid bullshit" or "Go to bed, it's past your bedtime you manchild." 
---
The most recent I've seen was tonight, to be fair he was fairly drunk, but it's Friday, which is also why I'm saying to stay away from Friday's if you want to have an opinoin at all that isn't taking PUg's side or harmless emoting. Pug is known to play music while he plays a killer, and just derp around with Insidious and catch people, or just run them down for the entire game, whatever. Tonight he delayed playing music for a bit, and the subscriber went "I need some music my man!". Pug got angry, banned him for 24 hours, and said he has no right to come into his chat with a one month subscription, that he didn't care about at all, and demand Pug do something. He said something along the lines of "For 5 dollars you don't get to tell me what to do, it's 5 dollars, now you can shut the fuck up for the night". 
---
The worst is probably when it's a GIFTED sub. He really goes off on gifted subbers, saying stuff like "Had to get mommy's wallet just to be able to say dumb shit then get banned, nice use of 5 bucks kid." Like I said, the worst of it is Friday's. His chat fully enforces it too, his mods will ban people for the smallest infraction of arguing, or joking, or trolling. Now he has a right to do that of course, but it's a bad look overall. 
---
BUT, I will say this, it's because of this incredibly strict chat , he has probably one of the most close knit family-like communities I've personally seen on Twitch. Albeit, it's because everyone who doesn't agree with Pug or is like-minded as pug is weeded out. Even as an outsider looking in, he's still entertaining, and the energy he puts up for a Friday can still keep you watching even if you hate the guy. You can not like someone as a person and still watch their content if it's entertaining. 
---
I'll also say this, he's REALLY good at survivor. He can loop a killer for the entirety of a match. At least when he shit talks in game, he has the skill to back it up. Can't say that for killer because he normally only plays Killer drunk, and only plays Leatherface with Insidious to meme on low ranks. 
---
He also used to play a lot of horror games and that was very entertaining as well. He has donations set up to make jumpscare noises at certain amounts. There's more I can say but I think I've said enough.
---
I finally perked-out Freddy fully...  
---
Now it's time to collect BP for when Stranger Things hits the scene so I don't loose to much time on that Demogorgon leveling.
---
“Later ni-“
---
Yeah, that sounds about right.
---
there’s literally so many things from that show that can pass as a killer, whether it be a monster they hunted or a main villain. the killer scarecrow from season one would be kinda neat though, could fit the game too
---
Still think it's a mosh pit
---
lemme just say that u suck at balancing.
---
Yes it is but they arent killing with will. The entity forces them too, like it forces every killer.
---
This is fact, not fiction!
---
And if all else fails don't forget you can always camp the hatch like a sissy!
---
People in the lowest ranks aren't very good. Shocking.
---
That rage quit tho
---
That's definitely a basement dwelling 30year old who will be cocky and DC when they go down for being cocky
---
&gt;You shouldn't end up with new player if your ranking is high enough
---
[Well that was a fucking lie](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/027/528/tyler.jpg)
---
I don't really think the is a benefit for the killer either, it's just an endless loop of pain, fear and depression for both parties.
---
yeah you better delete your comment calling a top 100 university impressive lmao.  Maybe worry less about video games and study so you can actually go to a decent college 😂
---
(Don't do it. Don't reply. DO NOT REPLY...they're an idiot...don't do it...) ...exhales...shit.
---
Yall genuinely salty that the worst killer in game uses some bizarre and easy to counter perks to win and offer a game that is unique to most other killer perk builds
---
you can use knowledge from one side to play the other one better. that's why playing both sides is so important
---
yeah that UCF education isn't doing you any good :/ Can't even read rankings

Shit alright lemme crunch more numbers then.
---
That means UCF is currently in the top 3.2% of Universities in America.
---
People from my high school with straight Cs got into UCF.  If you think your university is impressive you're lying to yourself whatever you need to do to sleep at night :)
---
Same difference
---
No.  Not "same difference".  Big difference.
---
Lmfao youre a trip dog. You must have something against UCF or something, for wanting to bash it so hard.
---
I've never heard anyone say "Whoa you go to UCF?!?".  But when I tell people where I go to college they are definitely impressed :)
---
Ok bro. Cool beans my man. UCF denied your college resume. Its cool man shit happens. Just gotta move on.
---
I go to Yale.  I wouldn't go to your shitty school even if I got in LMFAO
---
Console I imagine?
---
Ohh cool man! A fact with no evidence! Very cool man. Hey man Im applying to Harvard next semester! Bro you oughta come join me!
---
You wouldn't get in lmao.  Do you want a picture of my student ID lmao?
---
Sick, but why not just make an image post instead of linking it
---
The difference between a game where every survivor is a threat to the killer vs a game where they all die trying to unhook their swf in front of leather face is extremely apparent.
---
I can honestly say I have more fun on both killer and survivor if I'm placed with people of my own skill level. Though saying that my own complaint is the killer emblem system, if they find ruin early you can say bye bye to gate keeper points
---
Frankly I dont give a fuck where you go. More power to you. If youre really in Yale, congrats my man. You mustve worked your ass off to get in there. Were all just trying to get an education. Not sure why you gotta take shit into a personal attack regarding where I choose to go to work, or where I go to school, just based on something that has nothing to do with yourself.
---
$12 on top of dlc price...
---
Your last idea is amazing tbf, really hope they do that sometime in the future.
---
Get out
---
Read the title again.
---
Welp, I'll had another 1000 hours on just as soon as I get the chance.
---
Oh, you didn't hear? Playing in your underwear is meta now, all the pros are doing it.
---
Yeah, I'm killer main so whenever I play survivor and this shitty matchmaking places us against a poor new killer I feel really bad for that guy. I mean rank 20 with one single killer specific perk against team full of survivors with the best perks and on higher rank. Where's the fun in that?
---
I can't imagine starting the game now as the new killer, seriously it has to be insane and all respect to those guys who haven't uninstalled after the few games.
---
Try your best, see you in the fog!
---
It's...beautiful...
---
Fair enough
---
Eh I'd say you're both right. The recent perks for both sides have been pretty underwhelming. 
---
The only perk for Ghostface that people use is the gen stopping one, and that's very rarely seen. Same with Plague. The last solid perk that's used a lot was Discordance, back with Legion.
---
Survivors had MoM from Ash for a while, but that got nerfed. Poised and Head On from Jane are niche, but have their place. None of Jeff's perks are meta, but breakdown + ds is a nice synergy and distortion is used for stealth builds fairly often.
---
I think that's why everyone is so frustrated. We haven't had big meta shaking perk changes (excluding MoM) since at least further back than last December.
---
That guy should have been banned. Actually there's a lot of rude and obnoxious people who should be banned. I'd rather be a survivor playing with a Stranger Things newbie than an asshole like that.
---
Not a Legion main, but I like playing them because of the design of the character.  I also think feral is fun, even if it't not the most efficient.  really hoping that there's a buff to Legion, but I'm still going to play them regardless.
---
it works the same way on PC sometimes
---
They’re way different in the sense of pop culture. All of the things you mentioned have died down, before social media I might add.  and stranger things is in the midst of our preset time. Wildly different comparisons.
---
Yeah, I run spine chill often. (Check the background of the pic!)
---
Medieval art its so cruel and funny at the same time
---
Fucking LOL!
---
Someone needs to tell that dumb cunt running the twitter to play the damn game and see how fucked the ranks are right now. There are plenty of screenshots of the rainbow rankings. We’ve all had it. No matter how high you go it always seems to pull in complete noobs.
---
Unless you play killer. Then its different.
---
They mean that each gen unlocks a prison cell. So 2 survivors can finish a gen to unlock the 3rd cell and 3 survivors can finish the gen for the 4th survivor.
---
Wake Up MVP Kappa
---
Agreed, there should be a "give up" button
---
Not to mention it is really annoying when you die because the killer lagged
---
Camping means sitting by a hook instead of finding other survivors and by letting someone go I think they wanted you to give someone the hatch
---
Crying?  Its a meme my guy
---
really shouldn't buy the game over the inclusion of the series they will probably just quit after the hype wears off making it a waste of money.
---
Yeah, survivor mains typically are chill likenthe rest of us, but then again there are toxic players on both sides. Earlier today a David  (who did nothing, was by himself and had a key) was teabagging me. I being a sentient killer decided not to get mad about it and continue killing. About 5 seconds later David gets M1'ed down by a leatherface (me). After he died while he was the last one left and I was bm chainsawing he decided to message me and tell me to kill myself. All I had to say was "Is only game, why you so mad?" He didn't say anything back. So you toxic survivor mains out there who seem to think that we killers have to follow you "rules" just remember that we really don't care about said rules and if you teabag and flashlight click you deserve in-game death.
---
But you can I play survivor and I hear them all the time
---
It’s not that “everything” is going back to the 1980s in horror it’s just specifically the show. It’s just not that great no matter what subject they’re trying to do because the creator and director are a bit shit. I mean look at all of Netflix shows. It’s just not good
---
Thank you for posting, this response gives me some insight. The issue I have is where the fun factor comes in with legion. A solid nurse blink is satisfying and a well placed trap always feel rewarding when you push a survivor towards it. Huntress’s hatchets, etc. With legions frenzy, you just seem to chase after someone until you put all into mend state or isolate one to m1, and legion just doesn’t seem to exciting in that regard. I guess the issue I may have is his mind games are limited.
---

That's fucked up for real though, i Hate negative people like that.

Of course the manipulative person thinks the other person is paranoid. Is that the next step. Clever ;)

I mean, the game is already $20. Always goes on sale for $10, and has free play weekends quite frequent compared to other games. I say go for it, sure- some people WILL leave. But the game will definitely grow on many people, just like it did us.
---
Ah, thank you for taking the time to respond. You gave me a fairly clear idea.
---
imagine gatekeeping a fucking video game about trying to escape through gates where a psycho killer is stalking you and putting you on hooks. lame
---
Half the game?
---
It’s only half the game against solo survivors when they run around looking for 5 totems.
---
With 4 man swf 5 totems is negligible.
---
Inner strength is a nice QOL improvement for solo survivors as they had the most issues with NOED, and it’s OP as fuck with swf because 5 totems mean shit to them and now they get ultra fast heals, and can co-ordinate who gets the totems.
---
You could say the same about Ash Williams. According to in game lore it’s the Ash from Ash VS Evil Dead which is set in the 2010s, thus he would recognize all the current licensed characters. 
---
Not an issue for him, won’t be for Nancy or Steve (or Demo).
---
Im rank 1 and i have never had problem with snares tbh
---
Decisive strike is bad because it teaches new players that they can make stupid, risky plays after being unhooked because the killer literally can't do anything to them for a whole minute.
---
I mean not every streamer does that. I stream just for the fun of it, and I’ve met some other really cool streamers as well. Sadly not everyone is that nice and there are a few... really, *really* high-profile shitheads though, unfortunately. Two examples I can think of are abbreviated as AP and JD...
---
Bad players who blame their teammates.
---
jesus at the end, right when you entered the hatch i had to clench my butt cheeks because holly shit i was scared af.
---
legion is weak as shit I can agree but is sorta fun to play
---
It's just the adrenaline + endorphins talking, especially if they're new to the game. Just play it off, and try to give compliments or joke around in post-game chat. If they're doing this, it might seem mean but really it just means they had fun. They are BMing the killer you were playing as, not you personally, so try not to take it personally.
---
Hmm, bug/lag aside its freddy with 5 complete gens so if he has fired up he has 20% increased drop speed which might have caused this if he mashed drop immediately.
---
Just ignore them, saying that isn't manners on their part. 
---
I have found a lot of survivors tend to have some kind of holier than thou mentality. They feel like it's okay for them to run around in front of the killer and unhook people and you as the killer should just leave them to be. Now, not all of them are like that and some killers are "toxic" as well. No one escapes death (noed) or overpowered perks (Mori, multi blink nurse, iridescent head) It goes both ways really.. 
---
I try and keep in mind it should be fun for both sides and that balance can be hard. Just try your best to kill everyone, that is your objective. You can be "nice" if you want and let one go after stomping the others but it's in no way required. 
---
You did a good job and played well if you killed them all. Just keep hunting and killing!
---
If your looking for a good example of fair killer play, I'd check out hybrid panda. He tries to make sure the game is fun for all.

If camping is the way you can win you should most definetly camp 
---
You should rather analyze what the survivors are doing if you notice that everyone is going for the unhook or more than 1 guy camping can end their game very quickly if they dont you dont reallt need to camp 
---
Survivors are the underdogs they need to adapt to the killers strat to win all the toxicity comes from groups of players because they cant change tactics to unhook them or just simply ingore the hooked and complete like 4 generators till he stands next to the guy wich is a easy win
---
Thats the spirit ! I believe this is what the game was built to be like for survivors
---
Yeah true, I'm not gonna be salty about it.  If I wanted to win I wouldn't have gone for the save :P but it was still annoying
---
I would say it depends on how the match is progressing. If not a single gen was done...then what was the hurry, but if they were popping those gens.....you do what you gotta do.
---
I think that only happens from grabs.
---
*”this gun is very expensive to shoot” -Weighted Arsenal Man*
---
Typically, camping is being within the survivors radius when hooked. It’s common courtesy on killers to mainly avoid staying in the survivors hook radius. It’s often frowned upon because the killer will (more often than not) waste time there and survivors are unlikely to be able to unhook without “farming” their teammate. It’s a lose/lose. My personal advice is to try looking around for the person going for save and chase them. It keeps the killer active and you will most likely get another down before another survivor can come to save. 
---
As for letting someone go. That’s a personal decision on the killers part. Don’t feel pressured into doing so as it mostly varies from killer to killer. I personally like to play different mini games depending on the match with my survivors to see who lives. For example one match I may down the last two survivors close enough to one another, let’s say a Claudette and a Nea. I’ll pick up the Nea and drop them til they escape. If they go for the save they chose their own life to live, and if they run away they chose the Claudette to live. Depending on the selflessness of that player, they decide their fate. I try and be as “fair” as possible per match. But the decision is ultimately up to you. Just play what feels the most fun, but it’s nice if you keep the survivors fun in mind!
---
In my own opinion, this game isn’t about winning. It’s about the experience of each match.
---
Legion mains never change
---
Sry if it was a lot to read.
---
Huntress is one of the best killers.
---
I usually give hatch to last survivor and still some people send gg ez
---
How the pallets suck? U always take a hit if you think that its real pallet. Both can be still countered easily but still i would say dream pallets are better even though everyone disagree.

There are several problems about gens speed.
---
1. Non-swf casual players are actually struggling against better killers. A match against good Nurse or Spirit(both are perfectly fine for me) is a race against time. From the other hand a well-coordinated MLG SWF team is gonna smash gens in 3 minutes, even against a good Nurse(I'm not talking about 3+ blinks/omega blink, that's broken). 4 MLG solos will also smash gens. So, should we balance the game for casuals or MLG players? For me, it should be MLG players, because this involves more skills, but from the fun-aspect side, new players may abandon the game thinking that winning as survivor is imposible. One suggestion towards SWF is giving a debuff to repair speed, dependant on party size.
---
2. Holding m1 for even 80 seconds isn't too fascinating. Increasing gens speed even more can make it just unbearably boring. It would be also a huge buff to gen slowing perks, like ruin or PGTW. The solution is easy - give another objectives. This is super obvious. What can the objective be is the real question.
---
3. Maps size - balancing maps size isn't too easy. Mother's Dwelling or Mount Ormond Resort are just humongous, even Hillbilly or Nurse can struggle to apply pressure on those maps, pressuring Mother's Dwelling as LF is almost imposible and even potato teams can easily genrush you. From the other hand, I'm not sure about it, but Father Campbell's Chapel is too small. Rescues can be done really quick and gens are quite close to each other making genrushing easier. That's more accurate for MLG players, against casuals this map is great.
---
4. Kicking gens. It takes around 2 seconds to kick a gen, it takes about 0,0000001 seconds to stop it from regressing as survivor. Honestly, this is bullshit. Killer looses distance and precious time to kick a gen and make it regress, and survivor looses absolutely nothing, especially if a kicked gen is on the loop. This really needs some changes. It would also make sense lore-wise. The gen is smashed, it's sparkling and regressing, why would just touching it automatically stop the regression?
---
There's probably more points I can write, but lets end it here :D
---
No he is irritated at the comment hate section.
---
I mean I knew they were going to be bad, but they just let themselves just die. They either let the killers pull them off of gens, or run straight at the killer while injured. Then there are the plethora of Megs sprint bursting through the corn fields. When I go against ppl their rank as the killer, I encounter teams that are much better. Teams that actually know to work on gens lol
---
Um so you messaged the killer kinda sad
---
If you're playing Plague you actually depip with two kills and barely pip with 4k, since she doesn;t get chaser at all(everyone is one hit).

---
How do you know
---
That’s does make a lot of sense now, didn’t know she connected the Entity to Kramer
---
While it's good that you don't want to facecamp, if you have the feeling survivors are near the hook you can check the area, and if you go away and they unhook and you have nothing better to do you can go back to the hook.
---
Unless you are already in a new chase, or see other survivors sitting on a gen somewhere else why would you wander around on the map not putting pressure on them?
---
With stealth killers like ghostface in particular if you have no idea where anyone else is sneaking back to the hook and stalking both the hooked and unhooker while they are healing up can snowball easily into a win.
---
As long as you are not doing pointless things just to make sure others are not having fun (like facecamping, or sandbagging someone in a corner the whole match) it's ok to play the game, even if survivors feel treated unfair.

Try to be as effective as possible. If you have like 10 seconds of doing nothing at all, you're probably wasting time. Get on a gen.

you also know what the killer sees, so keep that in mind when playing survivor.

I feel like I'm a genius for watching stranger things right after Paulie did the first vid about stranger things being in dbd. That vid was right when season 3 was released.

It's actually just one of his kills from the movie. The mori almost looks identical to his same kill in the "Nightmare on Elm Street" remake. Look up the jail scene from that movie. Freddy's mori is legit my favorite just because of the accuracy lol.

While working on the DLC, they communicated closely with the people at netflix. They got renders for the demogorgon which they could use, talked about a few things in s3(Production was during s2) and also discussed the perks and survivors that would be in the game. Netflix employees actually knew the game and were eager to partner up with BHVR. So yeah it was more than more a license. Doesn't necessarily mean that a series will happen and all that, but still. (All of this was mentioned during the chapter reveal)
---
I love it!

Same applies to survivors who derank

1. It wasn’t my intention to come off agressive or rude. That’s your interpretation, and conversational tone is easily misunderstood via online text. It also isn’t my problem or fault that you misinterpreted it. That’s a you thing.
---
2. Because YOU are so rude and aggressive I now have no desire to even finish reading past the first rude ass paragraph. 
---
3. I’m so glad you apparently have a perfect game with no flaws, but even some of the bigger content creators are saying this game is turning into a shit show with the level of bugs and issues it has. There is a REASON why the community is getting smaller. And it’s not just because of how toxic the community can be. It’s because this game is literally walking down the same path many others (EX: F13) have. Developers that show their community they don’t really care, continuously bullshit or outright lie, and take forever to even acknowledge problems never go very far. Have another example: Ark (The Fun Pimps). And another example: DCUO. 
---
4. I will scream from the rooftops until it’s no longer true or changes:
---
BHVR is one of the most negligent, lazy, blind, and egotistical gaming developers I may have EVER seen in my entire life. Their stupidity is astounding. 
---

---
Rank 1 survivors that de rank and are toxic are the worst.
---
Had a game recently where a 4 men swf joined my lobby (im rank 10) they were really toxic, flicking their flashlights, teabaging, but i still managed to get 2 of them. After that they called me a baby killer and noob. (Wasn't using noed, camping,or tunneling) they just felt like being toxic.
---
I checked their profile and they had pictures of them being at rank 1.
---
This ruins the experience 4 a new player and its really sad beacose the game has so much potential.
---
Lmfao thats genius

Why do I have to be Adam? He's not funny, he's not even a scientist, and he joined the survivors super late!

fookin' dead 'ard

That's right that's me baby

You are a fucking cunt if you farm bloodpoints.
---
Ruining the game for everyone who wants to play in that trial normally
---
It's not toxic, but usually in Purple/Red Ranks a lot of the time you'll either de-pip or black pip.
---
This. I like this. Very well said.
---
I said me and my friends meaning swf verse a killer who wasn't there. Don't jump to conclusions you douche.
---
You can definitely hear her footsteps, it's just quite hard to be able to in certain areas of the map.
---
Not really. She’s slow, add-on intensive, perk reliant, basically a m1 killer with some added flair. No comparison to Nurse, Sprit, or Billy.
---
They say I tunneled the hooked people, but if patrolling my hooks is tunneling that's news to me.
---
In an alternate Universe they are real
---
Enduring, BBQ, Whispers and Nurse's is standard. 
---
I run Enduring BBQ Knockout and Infectious Fright personally. 
---
Other good options are Bitter Murmur, Discordance, Brutal Strenght  or Deerstalker.
---
Spirit Fury is also VERY good BUT it makes you play the game differently and can cause you to become reliant on it.
---
Tell that to the devs
---
Sounds good, I never have seen it as well. I am in the UK and to be truthful I never heard of it until DBD mentioned it lol. I will have a watch later on if it is still on Netflix.
---
He looks kinda happy
---
What happens when I que trapper and last second switch to nurse since all the console players are allowed in?
---
My first game on xbox I faced a rank 1 killer because I joined into a self of two rank 20’s and a rank 1
---
Plot twist Nancy’s gay
---
Yes, Im a happy surprised when I see that.  Or myers for that matter.
---
You must be gay at everything *get fucking owned*
---
Legion is literally the worst killer for securing sacrifices.
---
Are we gonna be here *all* day?
---
Thats not more than a license though.
---
Love it when new players do poorly in game and then get called a baby post game. Like yeah, no shit, some rank 20 Meg with one perk is likely new to the game, why do you have to be toxic about it?
---
I never said it was wrong to assume its a sniper when he deals with it as much as he does.  But ive seen it lol
---
Yeah it’s not that bad lol. Don’t know if it’s related but I find t funny when people say what happened to their money when steam has a summer sale. the whole point is to save money on games you want to buy instead of splurging your entire wallet on every single game that has a discounted price
---
Boobs

*Laughs in electricity going trough your brain, making you shit yourself*
---
SirRodion's "hero" build will see action again, updated with the new perks. We'll make it, BT, Babysitter and maybe even throw botany knowledge into the mix. I will give my life for the babies.
---
Demogorgon: *peacefully kicking gens, trying to stop the game from progressing*
---
Adam that hid behind the tree with a fucking pebble in his hand:*”Oh, I don’t think so.”*
---
I love it when it happens and I get rage from the team saying I suicide and should kms irl
---
That’s why I said if they’re getting bullied, because there’s some killers purposely deranking to scare off the new players because they don’t want more people like you described
---
It's your finest hour.

That alright man, fun varies from person to person. Most people hate the Legion but I love going up against one. Something about a survivors biggest sanctuaries (Pallets and Windows) and the Legion saying "Nope, fuck those" gets me hyped. Either I mess up and he hits me or I run as fast as my legs can take me and I avoid him.
---
I repaired the bathroom gen in The Game at the start of the trial.
---
ive seen it, not everyone has. quit being an asshole, it's just common courtesy
---
*literally any killer main:* Oh god Oh fuck Oh shit Oh no
---
how to download?
---
Furtive chase is the most pointless and useless perk in the game, I would get rid of it immedietaly.
---
Make your choice is always nice, especially for stealth killers. 
---
Remember me is kinda shit after the nerf.
---
Rancor isn't too good either.
---
Oh sorry I thought you said survivor, in that case, don’t be an asshole and ur all good

While that sounds hilarious, this thread is exactly why I set my account to private before playing DBD.
---
I’m not being an asshole and again it’s been 2 months so people should have seen it by now if not too bad
---
I know.
---
Just giving a logic response to everyone. Not directed just at you. I know I replied to your comment but it is just a general response.
---
It's as good as people think. You can use the perk only 5 times per match if you're lucky. For me this perk is kinda meh. Steve's perk is way better,
---
I'm hearing lots of people looking forward to Fixated.
---
Apparently they're supposed to be very good at farming BP like Doctor according to some people, I'm not sure about it myself
---
Lmfao nice one dude
---
Its a Baby dweet HE probably didnt even know what happened
---
r/cursedImages
---
Inner strength seems like it would be decent, especially if you combo it with other perks
---
r/blessedimages
---
like the other guy said, GENERALLY the better perks just feel a bit more fun. dead hard is interactive, which makes it more fun. most of the exhaustion perks in general are fun due to the way they change how you interact with the game and how you can control them differently. borrowed time feels satisfying when you save someone w/ it, which is fun. adrenaline is satisfying because it's neat if you get saved by it. I don't find something like Vigil or Wake up or Self Care fun, because it's just meh. it doesn't FEEL like anything. botany knowledge is just a stat boost. 
---
I suppose killer has a harder time with "fun" perks, ruin isn't exactly satisfying to use at all, it just exists.
---
It's funny though if they forget the hooked person can throw them out of stealth, and you just de-power them from the hook.
---
I always try to keep myself busy whether it be unhooking hooked survivors, doing gens, hunting totems, I just tend to either get downed right at the beginning of the game or being the last man standing lol. Ive been trying to recreate what the survivors would do to me. I still cant 360 lol
---
"you shouldn't end up with New Players..." i am rank 10 and most of my games i get rank 20 survivors and rank 1 killers

I dislike using Mori's myself but gotta do those dailies man.
---
&gt; Go to any post game that with a swf where they lose and they'll complain about every single thing you do. 
---
In my personal experience, it’s the killer complaining about literally anything excuse they come up with post-game when they lose. 
---
&gt; They made hooks come back because hooks staying gone was fair I guess? They took away some infinites and double pallets cause I guess that was fair? They took away the ability to stun or flashlight the killer at any time during the pick up animation, cause that was fair I guess? 
---
Yes, thanks for proving my point. I agree these are fair changes. But what led to these changes?  *Complaining Killers*
---
&gt; Have you seen the posts on this sub? Constant complaining about camping, tunneling, slugging, 3 genning, ruin, noed, bbq, spirit fury, like come on. 
---
This is where your bias is. Objectively speaking, the only real complaints from survivors are about NOED (which I think is a fair perk) and face camping (which is a legitimate complaint). Show me these threads where people are constantly complaining about.....Spirit Fury. And no, finding one obscure thread from 3 months ago isn’t it.
---
&gt;  I see that killers complain I can be objective, but can you?
---
So what’s the purpose of this thread? Where’s your thread about the killers that will inevitably moan about the new survivor perks? Where’s your thread about the killers who got MOM neutered? Where’s your thread about the (literally) tens of thousands and threads/comments about over-sensitive killers getting t-bagged? How can you claim to be objective when you are clearly biased?
---
&gt; They nerfed legion cause he was unfair and unfun to play against.
---
This is the only legitimate argument you can make.
---
But like I said, you are so worried about survivor complaints getting these new perks nerfed when there is literally no reason for you to. Aside from Legion (which never deserved a nerf at all), every update has in one way or the other favored killers and hurt survivors. Just look at the most recent update with the new killer status changes. Something nice for killers but nothing for survivors. You said it’s for balancing. Ok, so wouldn’t you agree that if they nerfed the killer perks (which they likely won’t), then it’d be for balancing and not to appease survivor complaints?
---
I’m on X1 and I just bought the game for my friend, I’ve only been playing for a little while and I’m not sure how to introduce him without making things too complicated. Planning on starting him out within the next day or two but I really want to do this carefully since I make things way too complicated. Does anyone have a short 10-15 minute video recommendation or just tips to help me get him started?
---
I had that keep happening to me and then the killer would be right behind me
---
Likewise, brochacho.
---
that's the nicest outcome i've heard of
---
&gt; p word (the one concerning minors)
---
Which one?
---
Also can people stop doing this as a non-native english speaker I really can't keep up with all these letter-words.
---
Ability Power and Jack Daniels?
---
I had a game like this once, messaged the Killer after to say "Bro your internet is so bad how do you live like this?" and he responded with "am from Russian, have good Internet but far. apologise"
---
Couldn't even be mad after how hard he tried to apologise in English 😂 since then I've thankfully never had a killer that far away... it's a nightmare.
---
Don't worry it's usually randoms.most swf are decent people
---
I think theyre seperate because blindness is only for seeing aura’s whereas oblivious is stealth killer oriented
---
He is garbage, that's true. I hope the update will make him better.
---
Just use spinechill.
---
Depends on how dexterous you are with a controller. If you play PC, it is no too hard. You can watch this video by Ohtofu, it has a lot of tips for becoming a good Billy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn1Znvdifx8

THIS ^
---
Spelt Groovy wrong.
---
For bloodpoint bonuses, BBQ, Thrill of the hunt, Survivor pudding and someone also brought bloody streamers
---
Let's be honest here I was going for the make your choice but got unlucky, the guy had more then enough time to find a pallet or 2 or a window.
---
Not my fault he's bad, dude would be running from pallets more than he ran from me.
---
The guy would just give me free hits he once came right at me.
---
If I was in his shoes I would have found a pallet or a window.
---
I even have proof as I have saved his comment on my profile.
---
I messaged the killer as well asking if they knew that they were really laggy, they didn’t respond.
---
Yes hopefully, fingers crossed!
---
the p word? what the actualk fuck is wrong with you
---
Very cool! The old school PS symbol in color is a nice bonus
---
I play him because he feels like a psychotic killer should. Plus he's short and fast, and great at farming BP.
---
It’s the worse.
---
If the person who’s running it knows how and when to use it, it can be a strong perk. Unfortunately most of the people who use it are rubbish and will Self Care at the most detrimental times, causing everyone to die.
---
Omg never laughed that much on a meme. 
---
(Btw I laughed just like 4 seconds, that’s a lot)
---

https://undeadgaming.co.uk/ looks like he put it on the website, I got it as a one off from a con but the popularity spike seems to have helped
---
I watched the Nightmare remake to understand who Quentin (my main) was
---
Depends on what you did. If all you did in those games was being selfish like: self caring with sloppy butcher, cleansing against a plaque, camping the hatch when you still have a chance to get more people out, leaving when the exit gates are open and someone is on the hook or camping the exit gate not intending to do anything for the last survivors. If you always get messaged then that is probably deserved no one playing for the team gets messaged a lot.
---
Good luck getting that license at a sane price.
---
But the ranking system is fucked anyway, so new players could end up playing with people like them
---
Gotta get ya, get ya head in the game
---
Who cares?
---
Obviously sexy plague mama
---
You could always play killer if you think survivor is too scary to start. The game usually isn't scary after you've played a few times and know the general pattern of the game
---
WHAT NOW?
---
I dont see the problem... explain to me cuz im probably an idiot
---
im a killer main but alright weirdo
---
yes and i don't know for what reason, it doesn't work if you use No Mither
---
Ok thanks
---
Sorting by new in this reddit is 50% people jerking of to their own score
---
well… still got the time to find a good loop point since MyC only activates if the killer isn't nearby. it's not that bad.
---
Why not both?
---
Imagine if it popped haunted grounds
---
Demogorgon.
---
It takes *literally* two seconds to find the name on Google...
---
Yeah. I'm tired of both of my haunted grounds totems being the ones in hidden spots and my ruined being right next to a generator. I don't know which totem is which and what to protect. If I use an all totem build I could lose haunted grounds first or I could lose it last because I'm protecting those totems while leaving ruin and devour hope or Thrill of the hunt unprotected. 
---
They should each be a different color that is standard for that totem( Example ruin is purple while devour hope is green or something) or they should have their logo on the aura
---
it's just like people now bullying children over liking fortnite, though they're fully aware of how they were bullied over liking Minecraft just a few years prior.
---
What are you, 12? Grow up.
---
In my opinion: play normally. Don’t go super easy but don’t camp, don’t run iridescent add ons and moris, etc. Just let them get used to the mechanics of the game and die while they learn without having every match be 30 seconds of getting instadowned and camped.
---
Jajajaja, ¡pero hombre, al menos haz la foto con ángulo para no salir reflejado en gayumbos!
---
Sorry just stating facts. Considering survivors now have a perk that interacts with totems, it’s only fair to nerf NOED with inner strength because we can’t use the “totem counter” excuse anymore.
---
Lmaoo i just rewatched that video, i really hope that claude saw the video
---
I made a comment about these type of people in another thread, and a bunch of people downvoted me for pointing out because they got offended and were most likely guilty of doing this type of stuff.
---
&gt; surprised you're not being down voted into oblivion. a lot of killer mains on here are definitely suffering from some sort of superiority complex where they intentional try to ruin peoples day and be a dickhead, the same killers you'll see who say something like "GG EZ 4K TRASH SURVIVORS LOL U SUCK" when the survivors all rank 15 and have no idea how to even play.
---
The Entity snatches weaves from across the multi-verse. I'm not under the impression that in Dead By Daylight canon all these franchise's characters co-exist on the same Earth because Bill's backstory acknowledges the zombie apocalypse so there's no way any other Survivors or Killers were pulled from a world where Left 4 Dead happened. The idea seems to be that the Entity exists outside of the universe. It's beyond everything. It reaches into different worlds to find dark souls, living and dead, take them, and recreates locations of tragedy. As an example, when Amanda was killed in Saw 3 the Entity saw potential and took her soul to its realm, recreating the meat plant where a lot of "games" took place. She's one of genuinely dead characters but the Entity will go after the living as well.
---
Good on you for sticking with the game and not quitting
---
i wasnt. i started at rank 1 with 1000h playtime.
---
Who doesn't love some new adorable baby dwights in the game? Not for bullying, don't bully baby dwights
---
I hit red ranks four days after reset. It's really not enjoyable to straight punish people who want a decent game and 4K in 3 minutes or less. I just try to give everyone 2 hooks, easy to count if people aren't wearing the same clothing or defaulted out. If I'm playing against better survivors and I catch them out after 2 hooks and its a lengthy game then it's on them. t-bagging pallets, farming team mates on hooks, sandbagging will get you tunneled and killed quick. outside that, I'll let most people live and if not the last survivor will almost always get hatch or a door escape.

---
SI-
---
Legion is fun to play, one of my favorites. Also good if you know how to play them
---
deranking is not easy at it used to be, especially as killer, as a reminder, you can't depip anymore when you DC, so you have to wait that those fellow survivors stop pointing at you to depip ONE Pip at at the time

I have been trying to find an actual figure on if thats even true and i could never find a thing

You can normally tell if they’re new by their play style
---
In what way? All it lets you do is see other Survivors' auras within 32m...

SWFers already have this info.

I mean it's still one of the best perks in the game

---
Ability: Sister Snatch
---
When Sister Snatch is active, you go into a 60 second phase when you are able to go on a rampage. Action speeds are increased by 30%. Successful attacks cool downs are reduced by 30%. If you landed a successful attack, you power is replenished for 5 seconds. You move at 125% movement speed while on a rampage. When downing a survivor while in rampage, killer instinct reveals survivors within a 20 meter radius. (Looking back at this, this seems like a combination of Michael and legion, but im too uncreative to think of something better)

You are able to damaged a fully repaired generator back to 90%. This generator can not regress below 90% and can only be used once per generator.

I love playing Ghost face. And it bugs me when people camp as him, because even though I've leveled him to 43 so far, the only "good" perks ive gotten are NOED, bitter murmur and sloppy butcher. So I run unrelenting, thrilling tremors, sloppy butcher, and bitter. And I do pretty well (rank 10 killer).
---
But I do have to say, I dont see camping Ghost face on Xbox nearly as much as I see LF and wraith.
---
If you're going for a medic role, sure, it certainly is I willn't argue that. But if you're trying to worry for your team AND yourself, Botany + Self-Care is better.

Well, think of a killer u want to play (because of the power, if the perks are good but u dont like the power, then dont buy it), or if u are more a survivor main, buy some with interesting perks

The backstories of the killers would be cool. Not enough to make multiple seasons but just a mini series.

Swf dont exactly have this info. I still run bond sometimes even with my swf. Mostly when I don't want to run self care, or if i am running prove thyself or trying for FL saves and don't have empathy on the character. It's true swf can tell eachother roughly where they are at but can't really pinpoint exactly where.
---
I don’t think that’s required
---
I mean, I like tru3, but it's hard to disagree with this. He tends to find a way to blame everything that goes wrong or can go wrong on something. Even his own bad plays.
---
The mind flayer isn't a killer. It's an entity in and of itself.
---
Losing one chase shouldn't equate to being outplayed and losing the game entirely to your fault, tunnelling and camping can significantly shorten a game and ensure that the survivor didn't play to his full potential, and was not really outplayed
---
When I started watching Stranger Things I couldn’t remember the name for the first few episodes so I referred to the Demogorgon as a Flower Faced Fuck
---
The killer mindset in this game astonishes me.
---
The killer is given every advantage in the game, but they all act butthurt as soon as anyone mentions giving the survivors ANY leeway.
---
Killers get:
---
The game is run off their connection for the time being
---
Faster base speed
---
Bloodlust
---
If a window is used too much its blocked off,
---
 survivors are stupid loud unless they waste a perk slot to counter it.
---
The grass in this game crinkles like you're wearing tin foil clothes.
---
Crows can spawn basically ON TOP of a generator and keep flying off while working on it.
---
They have a BP doubling perk that coincides with killer gameplay even making it easier whereas the survivor perk forces you to change your play style in most cases so noone uses it.
---
Killers get more BP out of a match easier than survivors do.
---
It just astounds me how much the killer mains in this game want to be babied. AS A KILLER MAIN.
---
Apparently, they think you absolutely must buy the cosmetics along with the killer to play them?
---
Ironically enough I was watching Tru3 the day of the Stranger Things DLC reveal (last Thursday) and he went into a long talk about how deranking and playing SWF to go up against low rank Killers ruins the game, especially if you're a streamer. He made a big point about how playing against low ranks when you should be at a higher rank and then streaming it gives new players a false impression that the game is easy, which misleads them into either not learning how to play cause "lol gg ez baby killers" or not playing because the game isn't challenging enough.

I have a lot of friends at low ranks and I feel awful playing with them. Thankfully I'm more of a stealth gen jockey but sometimes I play with No Mither or something just to handicap myself.

---
Angsty teen detected
---
Me too! It makes me feel bad forcing my friend to face good killers, but it also makes me feel bad for playing against new killers. There's no way to win
---
Just because some people are a expert in a killer, doesn't mean that it would bump up the killer in tiers. It takes a lot less effort to win a game with S/A tier killers than Medium tier killers and huntress is one of them.

Of course I'm not talking about rank resets. I'm talking about the people who intentionally ruin matches by playing like ass in order to ruin more matches by being way overskilled.

But not in pure mass.  A sky scraper is not the same size as a two story house, even if each floor has the exact same dimensions.  The game has much more playable area, and is two levels.

It can. However at the same time the game was still pretty small at the time. The problem is that during those time, they actually were focusing more on game health because they needed to. DBD has always had significant issues with bugs. There was a period of time when it was getting better, but after The Spirit was released I feel like the game started changing and going down hill. Legion’s dlc and the issues it brought with it brought DBD to a very dark period of time. After Legions release I saw a significant drop in players just on PS4 alone. The problem with that is there was a point several month before that release where the game was free for PS Plus members as a PS4 monthly. That month brought a huge influx of people, servers had issues as a result obviously. Between that, all of the bugs that were present at the time (Spawning in front of the killer to name one specifically) and then afterwards Legion’s release, it was like all of those people were suddenly gone, except it felt like even more than those people left as well. 
---
Plague was very underwhelming in terms of popularity on PS4, and I firmly believe it’s because of a specific issue that has been present since her release. (Her power has a tendency to just straight up not land/hit/work despite survivors literally reacting audibly to it.) 
---
Ghostface brought in some traffic, but that didn’t last. The vast majority of people on PS4 (in my experience) that have quit, say the same thing. “The game sucks, is boring, and is too broken.” A lot of them also compare it F13, and say the same thing for both games. That the games were fun at one point but between the horrible communities, horrible bugs, horrible que times, HORRIBLE connections, and repetitive game play: it just wasn’t worth it anymore.

Hes part if the plant gang but Hes on thin ice
---
I'm not even streaming and my ruin gets sniped every game, goddamn streamsnipers dood
---
That is exactly why. Theres nothing special to it. I usually point at the guy sitting at the gen with me
---
I want to do this one day. This is a goal I've set for myself. Congratulations!
---
Dwight is out of locker😱
---
I rest my case.
---
This is true, however OP is complaining that more experienced players are slipping into his (new friend’s?) games, and they are being toxic to him.
---
and a cameo of a claud ''doing gens, you''
---
Mint rag with people in the basement is nasty. Add myc to it and it's insane
---
Imagine being this fragile. Good lord. I’ve never seen anyone else who streams full time and takes every single negative comment so personally.
---
I just thought it was funny, but yeah this thing could rip David to pieces
---
No, I never played a video game long enough to care about something as dumb as someone else having the same skin I do. I do however play lots of hours, I just care about getting better
---
Dribbling was a legit counter. It was as reliable as cleansing all 5 totems on solo queue
---
I actually think Lerys is much worse than game because of the intense disorientation you feel when getting chased. It’s not like I’m just bad or whatever because I can have every other map memorized but I just get lost in Lerys.
---
U can disarm the trap...
---
And it works exactly like the terror radius for the killer
---
Yeah I was called a cunt when playing my third survivor game ever. And then the guy wouldn't even tell me what I did wrong just laughed and said I was and idiot.
---
&gt; [Babysitter] : Additionally the unhook notification and aura reveal is delayed by 3 seconds. {Allows you to go into a locker in that 3-second delay}
---
I don't see this being enough to beat decisive strike or borrowed time
---
&gt; [Camaraderie] : While on the hook with both the Killer and another survivor is within 16 meters of you, slow the sacrifice progress by 30/40/50%. The struggle phase is paused for 10/12/14 seconds if a survivor is within 16 meters of your hook.
---
Let me suggest this instead:  While on the hook with the Killer 32 meters of you, slow the sacrifice progress by 30/40/50% if there is no other survivor whitin 32 meters of you.
---
My friend got the game yesterday and it’s so funny watching them drop every pallet when they hear the slightest heartbeat
---
if spirit and legion were there too then it would be more accurate
---
I hate stealth killers/perks for this reason. While they can be cool and offer different gameplay from the standard killer experience, nearly every stealth killer I face just uses their power to facecamp and it just makes for some of the shittiest matches I've ever seen.
---
He may complain a whole lot. Looking for excuses, etc. But he'll never be as bad of a streamer as Angrypug. He's on a whole other level of shit personality. 
---
Also, protip: if you're not having fun, your viewers are not having fun. Even if it's your main source of income you might want to take a breather from it. Play something you enjoy.
---
This was really just cheese. I’m grinding hag for ruin and got her pink add on that lets you teleport from anywhere on the map on command. They all went down there and I was just constantly teleporting down there to catch them unaware. If you’re looking to do it I’d suggest a basement build and huntress. Her territorial imperative is really good for basement control and her hatchets are good for hitting them while they are on the stairs and then following up with just an attack.
---
If they are on a hook they can still see/hear you do that and tell their team.
---
he said git gud
---
It used to be different but that was the groundwork for dedicated servers since now they have to make the killer and survivors mutually connect to a single server.
---
Because it matches you with survivors now before you actually "create" the lobby.
---
They can't down anymore with their power, so you just loop him, like any M1 killer.
---
We don’t have dedicated servers yet though
---
The meme isnt an insult or criticism, its a joke. Hes talking about the comments on the post, not the post itself. 
---
"Creates a circlejerk of lies" referring to the abundance of insults on that post which ARE in fact slanderous.
---
And I. Am. Dwight.
---
Welp there goes my idea
---
That doesn’t make too much sense. Why not create the lobby and have people at my rank find my lobby when they are searching for a game?
---
Mr. Ego can't take a joke.
---
They did do a few dedicated server tests on live servers, but as I said, this is the groundwork for them to come.
---
Honestly, just being able to see the trap door would be good. Not OP but possibly worth running.
---
I would argue that the meme directly calls him out for blaming the amount of stuff he does (stuff that happens to ALL killers) on stream sniping. In that, it's criticism.
---
Yeah you are right. I think the problem with survivors is that there are only 4 ultimate perks for you(even though each survivors has a different opinion about these 4).
---
As a killer all the perks depends on the killer I play which increase my pool of perks I use to 12 or something like that.
---
"Not many people can do that, but I can." because he's special and better than everyone else, haha.
---
Don't camp, don't tunnel. Believe it or not, most survivors just want fair play not free escape.
---
That’s messed up.
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Vigo](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Vigo) at the ending, btw he says that he isn't there anymore, not that he exactly escaped.
---
I never thought about doing that. Super silly. What’s even the point? You wont get better at the game by so
---
I got called a monkey n****r the other day for getting a 4K fairly :)
---
Christmas tree
---
You are joking.
---
and since everytime you die in the entity realm you get weaker and weaker, he may be in the void (doesn't make much since since it's still on the entity realm)
---
I stop following anybody who deranks and I immediately consider them irrelevant. Whether or not the ranking system is bad, it will never improve unless people play at the ranks they belong at
---
Now to get it to pop up in a web for a killer I DO enjoy.
---
I love my Trapper, I enjoy Hag but the Bloodweb HATES her. I've got no tier 3 perks on her except Thrill of the Hunt and running all hexes is a nightmare. Need Haunted Grounds or another USEFUL perk.
---
Freddy's good too, I've got Spirit but I feel like I'll need a lot more practice with her.
---
So many killers, so little time.
---
(I also adore Legion but against survivors who know what they're doing I have trouble sealing the hook.)
---
Yay, rambling!
---
Aridis.
---
Doesnt get much more toxic than.this game lol 🤣
---
And there's almost no way to discern between people who do that, and people who don't tryhard for rank between resets.
---
Or people who don't play for a bit and end up in low ranks, because it all ends up the same result in a game whether abuse was the intent or not.
---
It makes no difference whatsoever in terms of time spent waiting.
---
It is still 32 seconds between 2 of you to heal, without time spent looking for a team mate
---
*Adiris
---
Just be sure to buy killer that is not buyable with shards.
---
If it's anything like the intro for the game then yes please.
---
Nope survivors have immunity frames when they unhook eachother anything’s fair game
---
I kept telling my friend to not try to kobe and stop using Slippery Meat yet he still was doing that. What's worse he was often dying in struggle phase, because he pressed space bar to fast/slow (idk).  He eventually stopped playing because of "dying too much".
---
Because shards are free not everyone can buy there way though a game so it’s helpful advice
---
How do I get that perk.
---
I see it's a pig perk(by viewing the wiki), so what do I have to do to get it for Hag?
---
I’d like to see that especially for the killer. For example what perks you used, how you performed against certain survivors, what maps your good at and how much you’ve improved.
---
So sad, the War Agaisnt Memes needs to stop
---
1. I didnt downvote you so I dont know why youre responding to me. 2. Wow what a dumb fucking thing to say.
---
Not if the trapper is decent, he won't let you do it.
---
But he has 500 auric cells I don’t see why he wouldn’t use that for spirit and save shards. Shards are free which is why it’s better to save them I’d rather use 500 cells and save my shards if perks like hex ruin are in shrine than use them on spirit
---
No-one would ever lie on the internet.
---
It’s just a random perk, then it keeps appearing until I level it up to level 3, wether I buy it or not, it won’t swap out for new perks unless it’s lev 3
---
Especially if they’re in a SWF group, fuck those guys. I once was playing a match where they were clearly in a SWF group but they sucked at it. 
---
Oh you’re teabagging me after I hooked your friend well I’ll just take a look around the corner and what do you know there’s another survivor just waiting to free the hooked one!
---
I mean that’s rank 20 tactics right there.
---
I think what the poster meant is that since this meme was posted on reddit and he reacted to it, he was reacting to the reddit
---
Will check it out ty!
---
That would be too scary
---
Well, it's not funny. Do you see anyone laughing with you?
---
I'm telling you why you get those messages and what not to do if you don't want to get them anymore. 
---
Or you can continue the way you are and accept the consequence. I don't give a fuck what you choose.
---
Wait for it to purchase it at the shrine or get the pig and lvl her up till it becomes available for all killers.
---
Toxic survivors as usual
---
No, I agree with that guy, when I like a game I like for it to die, who needs new players anyway.
---
Did 4 gens solo with Ruin while my team went down in 5-10 seconds every chase against Huntress
---
in post-game I got called a 'typical dwight brainlet' who does nothing and told to die LMFAO
---
moral of the story, sometimes it really is a 'doing gens, you?' moment :'(
---
Idk if youre playing devil's advocate here or if youre being serious. 
---
There are a lot of comments which are flat out talking shit about him. Be honest with me, do you think hes mad about the criticism or the defamation of character?
---
Ahhh one of those survivors.
---
&gt;Level her up till it becomes available for all killers
---
What level would she have to be once I get it?
---
Sorry if these are dumb questions.
---
well, I'm still waiting for her to puke. Let's see how good is she!
---
Will check em out to see what level of toxicness we're talking about.
---
AIDS guy
---
Honestly I love getting mori’d lmao
---
I’ll play killer and have the survivors get four generators in 2 minutes, then grab someone and face camp them so I get 1 sacrifice... at the end of the game they message me like I’m hitler
---
Lvls 30-40. The perk is a special teachable perk that makes it available to all killers
---
*Excited Oinks*
---
Presumably, in case someone's immersed all match and still needs a good barbecuing in endgame
---
He's a cool guy, just needd to learn how to ignore stuff that annoys him.
---
Criticism he’s Clearly not pointing out why it’s wrong and if you generally believe he scrolled down to the comments that talk shit about him you’d be mistaken
---
You either buy the pig and unlock all of their perks by getting them to level 40 or u just wait for it I. The shrine of secrets which will unlock it for all. 
---
After u have the perk just upgrade the hag until u have it on them . That’s it. Might take a while but it’s the only choice.
---
Got it, I think.
---
So I unlock the perk and then level the character to 30-40, or is it one of her starting perks and then when I hit 30-40 that's when the others can potentially get it.
---
I don't understand?
---
You are
---
I don’t think it’s gonna be $8. I assume $10 because 2 survivors. 
---
Also another $12 for ONE cosmetic. What if you want one for Nancy? That’s more money.
---
Good  idea!
---
Yeah!
---
He keeps commenting and deleting lmao.  He claims Dbd is a dumpster fire of a game with only a few dozen hours at most.  He can’t even comment anymore because we downvoted him to negative karma.
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Repost
---
If they play it as you said then it's their own fault. If the rescuer sets off a trap performing a rescue, he/she should take the hit for the rescued survivor, especially if he/she is at full health when performing the rescue. Rescued survivor is also at fault for not quickly running in the opposite direction to create distance and make you go for the rescuer instead.
---
&gt; slanderous
---
&gt; defamation of character 
---
Shit like this is exactly why people make fun of tru3 and his little army of nerds
---
But we don’t deserve
---
For the PTB, not for console players though.
---
Yeah Nancy is the new Locker Queen!
---
No it was in live build on pc, not ptb.
---
Face camping constantly is a dick move, but if the survivors play cheap I have no problem being a dick and getting someone... People in this community seem to forget that facecamping, and using survivors as bait, are actual strategies for killers who’s only goal is to sacrifice survivors! Me hooking someone and patrolling the area is cheap, but using flashlights while picking someone up, running in circles and jumping through a window over and over, and all of the broken survivor perks aren’t? K I guess I’m hitler.., fuckoff
---
Which video?
---
And fuck the lower rank killers right?
---
Generally what I do in that situation is leave the person who was hooked down on the ground. Unless they have Unbreakable it still forces someone to come pick them up, and keeps them out of the game actively, effectively getting the same as hooking them. But, I only show them that mercy once.
---
Just apply map pressure by making them go for hook saves and scaring them off gens
---
I wish they’d added Hopper too, sad days
---
I feel like that would be abused in swf
---
Hmmm but if I focus on gens, don't I also get a pretty high score on the "survival" category? That would/should balance it out? But yeah, it seems people are more prone to just play full altruism and have objectives as a optional thing since you pip from going full altruism but you don't pip even if you smash all the gens for the team.
---
[this video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
---
Luckily I’ve been a fan of both so I’m guaranteed the best experience
---
Doing gens is safer.
---
Always when i play ghostface its going to be coldwind :/
---
Having their profiles means nothing lmao 
---
Everyone who plays at red ranks on PC plays against the same people all the time
---
Nobody likes you
---
Likewise.
---
What consequences are there besides some salty teen commenting some nasty things, after all it's a video game do you understand?
---
If you don't play it to have fun then why would you play it.
---
How exactly does it ruin the game?
---
Please it should come with the bat aswell.
---
That’s actually totally wrong. I never form the lobby with players in it already. Once I’m in the lobby I wait 10-15 seconds and then people join into it.
---
We call her Vommy Mommy round here.
---
it’s not true
---
this is has to be among the most ignorant things i had the pleasure to read here
---
Not really got anything to do with them tbf.
---
*I'M MAKING FUCKING MASHED POTATOES AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME*
---
Hitler noob
---
I'd buy that immediately
---
I've only ever escaped once with no mother an Freddy left me next to a hooked survivor then walked away. The other survivor killed himself just as I got up and Freddy was just walking round randomly and never came back
---
Holy cow. I haven't seen survivors that dumb in ages
---
There's 4 survivor/killer dlcs including the Stranger Things one, and Ash, Leatherface and Ghostface are all standalone characters.
---
There is one
---
Strider is actually much weaker than you think on her, as it can lead you to believe they are closer than they actually are. And Calm Spirit is her strongest counter, makes it near impossible to track properly without Fathers Glasses.
---
He didnt call anyone a circle jerker. He referred to what was happening as a circlejerk, which if you look on urban dictionary is a pretty accurate description. 
---
&gt;He never said what he was offended by and why it’s false
---
He was probably offended by the people making out that hes a narcissistic streamer who does nothing but complain. If you watched his streams youd know that what people were saying stems from their own bias and is untrue. 
---
&gt;he never even addressed the legit criticism
---
So? Thats not the reason why he made that tweet.
---
Survivor: "You can't stop me"
---
Plague: *points to rock* "I know, but he can."
---
Survivor: *confused screaming*
---
Worth it.
---
TFW I main OoO and will start using this perk.
---
OOF
---
I swear my team is shitty at rank 4, but I guess it’s because I’m a console scrub
---
I get you, it really is dependant on the situation, it's best to try and get max in all 4 but that's quite hard.
---
Green ranks you tend to get a lot of what you mentioned, people try to bully the killer and fail miserably.
---
He looks like Isaac Clark from Dead Space
---
I agree with Esq_Schisms
---
Bond isn't essential for solo play. Sure it makes life a bit easier but you can definitely do without it. As to teammates "getting you killed", its probably a good idea to stop what you're doing and move away when you hear a heartbeat anyway
---
Well, it *is* Tru3 we're talking about.
---
A LOT of people hate the ANOES remake. I personally thought it was okay- yes it overused jumpscares, yes a lot of the actors really don’t give a shit, and yes it replicates shots from the original too much- but visually it was great, JEH is very good as Freddy (Kyle Gallner and Clancy Brown were also good), and I like some of the new ideas thrown in, such as microsleep.
---
yeah i just got this game not long ago and I'm trying to teach my friend how to play. we're getting outta the rank 16-20 zone rn, and we see nothing but ppl with maxed out perks and top tier add-ons facing newer players. it's always the same few killers too: Ghostface, MM, Nurse, and Wraith. it's been almost two weeks after rank reset too!
---
Keys aren't used as much as Moris though AND killers have franklins as a semi-counter to keys.
---
Still, I'd rather not have either.
---
you’re obviously wrong but okay
---
It’s time for bhvr to give surv mains some weapons
---
YOU'RE TOO LATE
---
Lemme get into a game with this guy as Scratched mirror myers on lery's
---
Awesome stuff, you weren't kidding when you said you're a fan of Doc :D
---
They were a 4-man swf, just went back to rewatch the game from one of their streams though it's probably against the rules to shame them here
---
Its just fucked you havw to have a little hwart to heart and stare into each others eyes for wrro and you will
---
*SCREAMS OF ETERNAL PUPPET FEAR*
---
What ridiculousness?
---
Nobody: 
---
Noob3: *360s hook*
---
Thanks! Yes I’m a big fan of him 😁
---
Umm okay?
---
They should add a progression bar to opening the hatch with a key - it shouldn't be an instant open.
---
Mori's should trigger after the 2nd hook, not the first. The Mori would essentially replace the 3rd hook to kill them.
---
Just bring a med-kit, man. If it’s not just a no-addon brown one it gets you two self-heals much faster, and you shouldn’t need more than that.
---
Trapper could be one of the 12" and all the survivors would be regular sized
---
Dwight is in Nancy ?
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
bro yesterday I saw a rank 19 spirit with haunted grounds, ruin, devour hope, bbq, and prayer beads
---
fuckin *rank 19* dude
---
It’s also not helping that legit everyone who replied was supporting him on it he’s like passive aggressive xqc sometimes
---
It's not sheep mentality, i got rank 1 with killer/survivor and i can guatanree you, there is way better people than tru3talent..his mindgames are basic stuff every killer goes..he actually does those so many times that you can notice sometimes survivors just run away. He also commits to chases for so long then patrolling the first guy, just like every other high rank killer does. This game requires very litte skill and if you think the opposite you probably havn't played anything like cs:go/LoL.
---
How is survivors doing their MAIN objective 'playing cheap'? Sounds like you've only got yourself to blame. You've got your killer's power and several perks to help you out with pressuring gens. 
---
No one said the survivor perks and tactics you mentioned aren't cheap. Like I said, if survivors are popping gens left and right it's all on you, not the survivors. And face camping doesn't help with applying pressure either and doesn't make you good at the game.
---
Locker Queen, young and sweaty, only rank seventeeeeen oh yeah
---
Franklins demise Clown?
---
yeah lol, and i bought it with the halloween bundle while it was on the 3rd year aniversary so it was at like 6 or 7 dollars
---
[my bad here is the actual video](https://youtu.be/_MvbUqOVJic)
---
Tru3 is how I learned the basics of killer. He has lost it since then. I couldn’t believe it when he joined in with his mods to harass me in his chat after I said it isn’t fun being slugged
---
Has he seen his own chat lmao
---
I like how everyone complains about balance in a casual game. Sure, there are games where you want you want to uninstall the game because you're playing Huntress on Lerys or something against a ridiculously good swf, but at the end of the day not every game will be like that.
---
Yes, but since survivors don’t have powers like killers and I don’t have a ton of survivor perks, unique perks are what give survivors their flavor.
---
Darn :(
---
He was fully healed... before I hit him I smacked other 2 survivors hoping they would be the make your choice they got away because of the speed boost and as a trapper you can not afford to waste time.
---
Also blood trails don't last that long and generally are pretty hard to see on some maps.
---
You need to think a bit more closely though. That raises even more questions. If there is an Evil Dead universe out there, how did the people in Stranger Things become aware of it? Or does the act of creating a fictional universe create a real universe? Even if so, if - and I suspect there are - now multiple universes referencing another universe, how did they possibly communicate that information or is it a coincidence? So let's say that Evil Dead and Stranger Things both reference Texas Chainsaw. Evil Dead did it first, so created a new Texas Chainsaw universe. Bubba is from there. How did the people in Stranger Things ALSO coincidentally create a Texas Chainsaw universe? Are there two Texas Chainsaw universes? Which one is Bubba from?
---
Why is he “obviously” wrong and why do you accept his answer when you think it’s wrong?
---
Freddy with his highest lunge range: “pallet loop this, BITCH!”
---
Demogorgon: *gets released*
---
Freddy: “why do I hear boss music?”
---
Neither
---
Why am I wrong? I'm giving you actual answers that explain the problem and you're giving me "acrually you're wrong" and "you're obviously wrong" with no explanation to actually back it up.
---
Obviously this would not apply for killers and survivors at low ranks, since they still need to learn how to play
---
I know flayed billy is from the show, but I can’t help but think about flayed hillbilly when I see it.
---
*Rank 20s would like to know your location*
---
wow damn that hurt.
---
But seriously, if you dont play against new players, 3 seconds is alot of time
---
I was hoping for original but like one dude said, content is content. Not to mention the influx of new players from such a popular franchise will bring more money and more notoriety which in turn will help the devs. More money and popularity means more killers/ survivors, better servers, more chances at licensed people (for people who like that), cosmetics and a slew of other things. People may not be happy with the decision but it’s far and away the last killer we will be getting. Let’s just be happy we’re getting quality content and they still care as much as they do about their fan base
---
Thats really bad bait.
---
Your not being hated for this mate, no one has said they had an issue they were just addressing an incorrect point of yours, if you can’t take criticism then don’t post anything on the internet
---

Nicknames are fun.
---
Obligatory "don't know why you're downvoted"
---
But I agree, DC out of rage is for babies and ruins it for everyone else.
---
I want to watch Stranger Things too, but not alone. Sadboi hours.
---
To be fair, it can be extremely tilting to be chased and funneled the entire game and then leave with like 5k bloodpoints because you weren't able to do anything else.
---
"Oh boy! All gens are done but at least the guy that ds'd me is dead!"
---
Just place 1-2 traps no need to go over because then that’s considered being a jerk. If the person that was just unhooked is pretty far away as in they’ve vaulted a window or they’ve left you then there’s no point in going after them. Just hook the person that just unhooked them and continue on patrolling gens
---
*okerrrrrrr*
---
“Yo Claud, how the fuck am I supposed to do a gen when that red thingy comes up on my screen?” 
---
-My friend who got the game a weak ago reacting to Ruin
---
cuter than
---
I mean you could break LOS, or break him out of stealth correctly, or do literally anything to evade him. It is fair gameplay, you're just not that good.
---
Yeah but first off (going off of what i'm hearing, I haven't seen season 3 yet) don't we need the mind flayer to control Billy?  And second the demogorgon is more of a staple i would think aince it's showed off on the first season and anyone most people would think off the demogorgon if you asked people about the stranger things antagonist.
---
I may be wrong but this is, to my knowledge why demogorgon was a better choice
---
I’m only going to address the last one because everything else is willful ignorance.
---
But yes he does.
---
I can look for it later, but the very day I knew tru3 had lost it was when he uploaded this game titled something like “toxic 4 man FAILS” 
---
Not only did the team do literally nothing toxic, they obviously weren’t SWF. They were not coordinated at all. He just had a bad map (haddonfield) and a tough match 
---
He does this constantly
---
Hahaha definitely should have just said it
---
He probably didnt even give u hatch when u couldnt escape
---
So you hit 2 people and instead of following either of them, you chose to stay around? Yeah I can see why he was pissed off. That means instead of hitting 2 times to down someone, you had to hit 4 times to down someone. And that someone was the one you just hooked. You are being inefficient with your time and made someone's game unpleasant.
---
If you had set up your trap correctly,  you wouldn't worry of sprint burst as you can herd them to that specific trap.
---
Ooh, that's really good! I especially love the detail in the Pig mask (face?) and the eyes. Great stuff!
---
I'm taking about the boost that you get from getting hit so you even know what make your choice does? Come on now google it
---
cant wait to bully all the new players
---
Discordance is a very useful perk so if you don’t want to wait for it on the shrine yes. Otherwise no; legion is a crap killer.
---
Yes buy legion
---
Like I said haven't seen season 3 so I don't know much about the mind flayer.
---
But, being human isn't going to mater, the devs wanted humanoids not humans.  I may be wrong about that but I'm pretty sure on this one
---
Left Behind is already in rework progress. No point of working hard for this posts. 
---
Still good idea tho
---
No don't do that
---
Watch season 3. Then come back.
---
Altruism - Hooksaves, Healing.
---
Objective - Doing gens, hitting skillchecks, and doing gens with teammates give coop action points, that's how you can get the most out of it.
---
Boldness - Getting chased, escaping the killer.
---
Survival - Surviving the trial either through hatch or just escaping through the door.
---
Explain pls
---
Dude I LOVE new players. They increase the player base, generally reduce matchmaking times, and it’s sometimes fun to stomp a noob team (not too much though or I start to feel bad for them)
---
Shame that he's seen as a insidious basement camper and overall toxic killer in the community.
---
I would but I'm not watching nine 30min episodes to come back to this thread.  I'll watch season 3, just in my own time.  Anyways, my second statement still stands so disprove that for me and I'll agree with you.
---
&gt;I’m only going to address the last one because everything else is willful ignorance.
---
Convinient.
---
Anyway, this has gone off track, its clear that you have a personal issue with him and youre always going to have a skewered outlook on the guy.
---
Hmmmm I thought it would've been a killer with add ons that give you exhaustion
---
When the killer does his objective
---
Hooray! A killer who isn't fun to play on either side.
---
legion is wack. his discordance is good though
---
Kate!
---
No. We are suspecting it to be 12 dollars. You don’t need to buy it to play the game, but if you want to play as Nancy or Steve or the Demogorgon, you will. You can still be in a lobby with them, just not directly play as them.
---
The map is free though.
---
Thanks, I didn't know that. I just knew the perk sucked and I thought my idea suited Bill. Still, it could always be an idea for a future perk!
---
Honestly I derank a shit Ton when I take breaks, and that can drop me from rank 1-7 to 17, so when I get back into it I stop on people who just bought the game, but not because I wanted to, and if I do I always try and give tips, and tell them the strengths of my killer, and what they did correctly In the match to try and help them get better, this games a toxic shithole, and I just like trying to give a little bit of positivity rather then just shit on people who just bought it
---
god i hate new players
---
Couldn't have said it better myself. I was worried that the dbd playerbase was dying out but seeing that the stranger things teaser reached #1 on trending made my day
---
I had autistic students who could string together basic sentences.
---
Maybe there's a Hex: Incoherence totem in the forum.
---
&gt; I personally don't think this is very fair AND I don't think the devs will change gate spawn locations to opposite ends of the map SO...
---
Do you think that it's fair? the killer already did his job killing everyone, so the last survivor gets a free escape chance from the hatch, the killer finds it first, so then he gets an unpatrolable gates?  why not make it easier and when the 3rd survivor gets killed the last survivor automatically escapes?
---
I would! People don’t like him because they don’t really see his power for what it is, and thats pressure/information. With certain perks you can make him a big annoyance. 
---
I would either save up shards for him, or just buy him outright :)
---
Can’t wait to run Borrowed Time, Babysitter, We’ll  Make it, and We’re Gonna Live Forever
---
What is the difference between the two? I haven't noticed anything consistent
---
Shhhh im irish it explains it all
---
most perks are shit. and the ones that arent are overshadowed by the META
---
Ah thought it as 60 thx but still the answer is no
---
Discordance can be used on almost any killers, it's a very good perk.
---
If Inner Strength turns out to be an insane perk, Iron Maiden will also be pretty good to counter it.
---
And yeah, Legion is a ton of fun, so I'd recommend buying them.
---
Ah, drunk before noon. Top o the mornin to ye!
---
I had to wait to come back home and post this from my PC but holy shit did this edited webm made me burst laughing, I had to probably rewatch this a few twelve times until my lungs hurt
---
Wish I could give you gold for sharing this but I can't, but thanks, OP
---
Why do people downvote posts that make sense or are funny on this sub? So annoying.
---
Luckily we have Otzdarva now who is both really good at the game and he goes over what he did wrong or right and what the survivors did wrong or right. Add that to his noobie guide videos and you got yourself a really nice youtuber/streamer.
---
I think some of his fans think the same thing about this subreddit being a circlejerk.
---
They've got to add Smirnoff next
---
Okay.
---
With Inner strength coming out Iron madien is gonna be strong. So yes
---
I have effectively countered your entire post.  You may have missed my spoiler filled edit.
---
Then why aren't the lobbies immediately populated with 4 survivors?
---
Would love for them to incorporate mechanics such as the Friday the 13th game, but I know it’ll never happen
---
I literally just had this happen to me on PC. I've been playing on PS4 for years so I figured I'd go back to PC since I never gave it a fair shake.
---
First game was a level 20 (I ended up at 16 from rank reset) hag who had maxed out perks and their profile showed over 1000 hours of playtime.
---
I would give the benefit of the doubt about the perks, since I level a killer up to at least 30 before I play them, but they were genuinely very good in a way that a pure survivor main wouldn't be able pull off if they had literally never played killer before.
---
if he just chews at the survivors chest it would be too alike hag, i’m certain it contains the demogorgon using his teeth
---
You're getting two survivors, 3 perks each (decent), a new map (we haven't got one in a while), a killer that has chase potential and map pressure, and new cosmetics for those licensed survivors
---
He's sad because left behind hasn't been fixed
---
But he is using his teeth
---
Yea, figured it was too much. Fell for the first worm tho
---
Exactly. Even when showed it's aura mid match you can still forget when you are the only one left. Damn I forget where the gates are sometimes.
---
Yessss praise be the pebble of DOOM!
---
so wholesome
---
Depends on the rank tbh... If you are in purple or red ranks, people won't cleanse and you'll just be an M1 killer after you put them all into the broken state, but if you're in lower (or higher? never knew how to call it) ranks, where players are worse, and they cleanse, it's fun.
---
So worth it. What I’d give to experience that show again for the first time.
---
200 iq.
---
I love the Plague.  With add ons she can make people broken incredibly fast and if they end up cleansing you get crazy hit range with her blood puke.   I usually run Ruin Monitor and Abuse. BBQ and infectious fright.  Different play style with the sickness but I think shes a really different type of killer. 0h and a horrifying mori
---
You right
---
i don’t find her that fun cause she’s just an m1 killer, but if they cleanse corrupt purge is fun
---
Probably because he's in shock?  Maybe he thinks too highly of you?  That you won't play dirty and target him again when there are 2 other players. Who knows? 
---
I'm more interested to know why you think catching someone with speed boost is hard? You accuse your opponents of being bad at the game but the same thing cam be said about you.
---
I've never seen this before, how did that happen? LOL
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cuuk7z/exit_gate_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
sorry steves and nancys and all new survivors its judgment day and im the judge
---
but even if they dont cleanse, have a pretty much permanent insta down
---
Haemorrhage is only useful really with bloodhound. Coincidently one of my favourite perks are bloodhound
---
It shall be vomit time
---
got the short sprint boost from getting hit, then vaulted and i guess the game gave me the boost until i got hit again.
---
This makes sense.  Still sad we didn't get Billy.  The demi does little for me.
---
Top one is supposed to be hook sacrifice, the bottom one is supposed to be Mori or bleed out. 
---
However, DBD wouldn’t exist without a few bugs so they sometimes show up wrong.
---
I don’t think you no how to actually fully utilize the perk then if that’s all you think of it lol
---
I mean you dont know what the Killer was until the end game screen so the only way to do this would be to do it to ALL low rank killers. Not that there's anything wrong with using your perks but yeah it would suck for low rank killers
---
As far as I know, the first image is a death on hook, and the 2nd image is a death by any other means
---
PM'ed you the link :)
---
I find Legion really fun! Plus the cosmetics are really good.
---
Haunted grounds intensifies.
---
It's not about being butthurt, it would make no sense for killers to be at the same speed/lower than survivors, because then the killer would never catch up without bloodlust, which you also listed as an advantage. It's just a weird thing to put on a list that's apparently pointing out how killers want to be babied.
---
Okay now it's my turn to repost this 5 minutes later! :)
---
I mean Kate has TWO WHOLE PICKAXES
---
I may sound ignorant arguing about something while half imformed but a point from the first season shouldn't mean i need to watch the third one for it to be valid.
---
Along with that, if the demogorgon is no less controlled by the mind flayer as billy was than the entity could definitely make the demogorgon do it's bidding if it could do the same with billy.  It may look weird at first but we'll get used to it.
---
If it's the fact that billy has some good in him left is what you think is what makes him fit the lore better than look at tbe doctor, he literally lobotomizes his teacher so he can try to control his mind.
---
Like i said, i'll admit that I may be ignorant for not watching season 3, but based off your spoiler demogorgon could still be a killer just as much as billy and still fit the lore for being humanoid.
---
Can't watch clowns Mori....I turn off the TV when it happens
---
I know now
---
Or playing Nancy cause she's a cutie
---
Advertises their stream - Complains about stream snipers.  
---
Dickwads.
---
in before Survivor Mains complaing "why do I need to waste 15 seconds cleansing? I just want my free 9 Second heal"
---
Question
---
I still want to know how survivors can play cheap.
---
Well, if you're going to talk about bitching in general, don't pick a side like that. Every Killer is allegedly a camping tunneller who is wrong to ever slug.
---
But I'm not talking about toxic claims; I'm saying that genrushing is a real thing that disrupts the balance of the game. If it isn't real, why is NOED tied to a hex and Hex: Ruin mandatory meta? The devs themselves have basically acknowledged it.
---
It probably wouldn't be an issue if toolboxes didn't speed up gen progress, though, and were only for hook sabotage.
---
Don't forget have sex without consent too
---
Though it may seem dumb and the blood points categories work out pretty well, it's  just riskier to go for saves it happens less often than gens so it grants more points, this of course can lead to people making dumb saves or even worse hook farming but it works out I feel.
---
PS4

Killer will pick up survivor right in between a pallet and when it is thrown on him he will slide away from the pallet and not suffer any stun at all. Has happened 3 times for me in the past two weeks.
---
Visual Bug on all platforms
---
Nea’s Prestige 1 and Prestige 3 have no blood on her neck and her beanie.
---
She uses Small Game in general back then to counter Ruin's and NOED's because she was always Ran 1 or 2 and Solo Q'ing.
---
Since she didn't stream snipe, she didn't know it was Tru3 who as well know doesn't rely on NOED.
---
She doesn't watch him anymore, she watched FunGoose instead but they both have become quite toxic (unexpected from FunGoose as he was doing so well with his streams). Now Noob3 is the best, especially when he does drunk collab streams with others.
---
imagine facecamping because somebody used perks
---
Even here, I fall victim to this...
---
Happened to me once. I did four of the five generators all on my own as Meg. Coldwind Farm vs Clown IIRC. Everyone else is juking him the entire time. Pop it and open the gates. This is before Endgame. Someone gets basement hooked, i go in to save. Get them out, I take the hit, and another guy runs in front of me and I can't move out of the shack and i go down. Killer hooks me, another guy farms me, and again i get sandbagged and go down. Everyone leaves because fuck that they all got hooked already. Mind you the gate is literally outside the shack. Post-chat: "lol meg deserved it." I say I did four gens on my own and saved someone,why does that mean I die? Someone says "occupying the killer is more difficult than holding down m1", which may be true, but it was literally just me doing the gens past the first one. Fucking dumb.
---
The "thinking it's a stranger Things game" hit me really hard idk why
---
Why would they do anything about stream snipers? It's explicitly not against the rules: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
I seem to be the minority here in that I actually like tru3 (although admittedly I don't watch him a lot), but he does have his quirks that are easy targets for meme *along* with taking things a bit more personally than he probably should.
---
Wasnt he already in pretty bad shape? I don't think 3 Tanks were the minimum I think whatever God is in the L4D Universe just went overkill on him. Pretty sure a Boomer could've killed him at that state
---
I've watched the first two seasons since DLC was announced so far. I'm hooked
---
Yes, but Remember me doesn't affect the obsession. So if you don;t kill the obsession before all the gens are done, the obsession can just open the gates without any penalty.
---
Shut up boomer
---
Spirit main, low level survivors and solo survivors are the easiest to beat in chases. When I got against red and purple ranks they know how to counter me pretty well. SWF groups I usually cant 4k. Every killer has a counter and for the spirit you cant just loop, when she is standing still you either crouch walk or just run away. I think you might just be complaining to complain.
---
That's always it. Literally anything Survivors do is "their job," with no regard to how they did it, but Killers are wrong if they ever camp, slug, tunnel, use NOED, use Insidious (a perk literally for camping), don't let someone get hatch after a D/C...
---
if you're playing on haddonfield as ghost face chances are you won't be able to get a single exposed effect on a survivor
---
I didn't learn about scratch marks until my first killer match I played which was like a month after I bought the game
---
r/Oinkers_
---
But if you're just getting hooked, you're accomplishing neither.
---
But yeah, that's the top meta. One looper, 3 gen-rushers, right?
---
We need an ultra rare item called baseball bat. You can hit the killer to slow him for a set amount of time
---
And if we go into the comic series, he’s even scrapped with Freddy already
---
*happy oink*
---
The rare times that I'm able to pull this off someone has to 4%
---
So basically think of him having a hit box for revealing. Spent some time in a KYF testing it out recently and it’s actually pretty small with just his vanilla setting and no add ons to protect him. Here’s some tips for VANILLA Ghostface with no addons to reduce his revealing range: 
---
- He can see/stalk from some pretty incredible distances, farther than you’re able to reveal him. 
---
- Hiding entirely begins cover can actually prevent you from revealing him for some reason. Often times I have to stick myself out partially to get the right angle. Sucks but after testing it I showed me why I previously used to have such a hard time with it.
---
- If he’s leaning while stalking you might as well just take cover and try to get around to a better angle on him. Even on vanilla settings he is significantly harder to reveal while he’s leaning. 
---
- You CANNOT continuously move your camera around. Once you start the reveal try to keep that exact sight line as steady as possible. 
---
- Think of his detection/reveal box as a hit box. The farther he is away from you the smaller the box gets. Revealing him is best done at close to medium range. However also being right on top of him can sometimes weirdly glitch and just straight up not work. This of course can change when he uses add ons to reduce his detection range, which are usually pretty obvious once you figure out his vanilla hit box. 
---
Things to remember:
---
- On top of having incredible stalking range he also can stupidly stalk people from the tiniest bit of the survivor’s body being exposed. Over times over sightline blockers where like a single HAIR is visible. (Infuriating but good to know and also explain how and why I was exposed sometimes)
---
- His Detection/reveal box is slightly inconsistent I’ve found. It has a tendency to “start stop” at the slightest movement, and when trying to reveal him from awkward angles. 
---
- If you manage to get the reveal before the expose remember that your exposure bar DOESNT go away. So just assume you’re 99% after winning the face off and leg it. 
---
- Even on vanilla settings he can stalk faster than you can detect/reveal.
---
Rasputin killer when?
---
He's the hot head apprentice
---
I agree to this. But survivor bois need to also do the same for new killers and let em get a few kills.
---
Nobody really knows the price of this chapter because it's such a unique situation. All i know is the Scoop Ahoy outfit will be $10 and that i will buy that amazing cosmetic.
---
No joke don't buy Corsair mice
---
Yeah, but BVHR doesn't mind because it's often easier to smurf instead of deranking by buying a new copy.
---
sorry meant to say but after the comma, yea but he’s gotta use them in a way that’s not like hag
---
Even when they loose you they don't stop running like crazy so you find them again xD
---
He was also playing ugly Quentin btw
---
I don't think they would ever do a Practice/Vs AI mode as there's KYF.
---
I WOULD appreciate the tutorial section getting updates to teach players the basics of playing as each Killer and how to play against each Killer.
---
Yup, I was always wondering why the killers were finding me so easily haha
---
I normally avoid rebooking survivors if they were just on hook. I like to give them a fair chance ;) so I just slug them, instead of eliminating them from the game, because their teammates put them in a bad situation.
---
I hate to ruin a survivors game, and make him feel hopeless like I specifically targeted him. I'm talking about at the very early start of the game.
---
Demi HAS never sacrificed people on hooks, but if he could be controlled by the entity he would.  It woild be the same has billy. If they're both controlled by the mind flayer and they could both be controlled by the entity, then they would both sacrifice people.
---
I'm sure there are other reasons for it, will likely find out in the next stream.
---
Gotta love the edgelords who go "Everyone is salty and my irreverence somehow makes me not the asshole here."
---
Ghostface may have just had a fetish for the mori screencaps.
---
I’m having the same issue. I either steam roll or get steam rolled. There’s never an in between when I play him.
---
Finally the game would be scary again.
---
Naw man, you gotta welcome them properly with an insidious basement camping Leatherface. The scariest jump scare of all.
---
I by no means am a game developer and I understand longer gens might be boring, I'm just ham salading my ideas like a handful of darts at a board of topics my brain could bring to a half boil. I appreciate you're into the game enough to properly debate ideas and such, even on such a small topic like mine. I just hope BHVR will take our gripes into account some day because the game is dying.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Visual, I hope
---
Description: Hex: The Third Seal still only displays 3 tokens, even if you've hit all 4 survivors
---
3D MOVIE MAKER MEMES?! YES
---
We found the headless chicken xD. 
---
If you still didn't learn that there are moments in which you shouldn't be running, especially when you've lost the killer and you have Iron Will; then I'm not surprised as of why you don't understand this meme. Also, if you've ever played killer you should understand.
---
Just waiting for BT in my bloodweb...
---
Well, kill him then. 
---
Not really. The easy solution here is to just slug him. You'll look like merciful God to him for not hooking him immediately, you stop the immediate threat to the gen, and you have a chance to bait another person to heal him. If you put trap around him, you may nail another one.
---
Yuuuppp
---
Since that style of mouth is a ‘Flowering’ mouth you’re not TECHNICALLY wrong...? 
---
I’m hoping he eats the Survivors like the Demodogs do to their victims in S2.
---
If Ghostface took a bigger penalty when he was spotted, like being slower during recovery, he'd probably repel cheesy players a lot more. Between his 0 stalk loss rate and full speed stealth, he seems unbalanced and overly simple.
---
No. Its on the list because it IS an advantage at the very definition of the word. That WHOLE LIST is meant to be taken together.
---
Explain why in the PTB, when they tested punishing hook camping an overwhelming majority cried that they couldn't camp anymore?
---
Or even now when anyone suggests camping and tunneling should be punished, theres a sea of tears funneling from killer mains?
---
The killers in this game are a bunch of babies who need every crutch they can get. There is ZERO reason why camping and tunneling can't be punished other than not wanting to lose their crybaby killer base.
---
Whenever people could use sprint burst on command due to that glitch or whatever, BHVR fixed that within a week. Survivors were glitching and couldn't heal or be healed? Let's take a month to fix that.
---
How many killer perks have been nerfed recently as opposed to MOM, DS, and a few others I can't think of off the top of my head? Lets give all killers instant down abilities or add ons that all instantly down survivors. Moris to instantly take someone out of the game on a whim. And then perks that ALSO give one hit downs. Ive played games where bad killers get gen rushed, just to have NOED get them all 4 kills. This game is embarrassingly easy for killers. And if you think survivors dont need more viability outside of SWF, then I have to believe youre just garbage.
---
Nice fighting toxicity :)
---
I always miss my ds when i really need it
---
Hoes mad

*oinks in excitement*

All I want is the Pretty Woman outfit
---
Gates are opened, anything goes.
---
Damnit already spoiled. Guess I better go finish the binge watch. Hope he gets his ass beat.
---
Ohhh I see! Thank you so much.
---
Here’s something, the killer looks boring
---
They’re both pretty terrible, blindness could be good but it’s completely countered by swf and if they’re not using an aura perk, it’s kind of pointless.
---
Is he supposed too?
---
Did they mention one jw? If not probably halloween
---
He was trying to counter ds.
---
I was letting you off easy but okay.
---
Punishing hook camping just encourages Survivors to loop the hook; the intention to camp isn't a factor and most campers are either inept enough Killers to not be worth picking on or deliberately spiting someone toxic enough to warrant it. Unlike most cheese, camping comes with a severe penalty implicitly, anyway, so QQ.
---
Tunnelling SHOULDN'T be punished because it's a viable strategy for rapidly eliminating Survivors. Just because it hurts your feelings, you can't act like it's any sort of an exploit without admitting the fundamental design of the game is mediocre. I just covered camping.
---
Your Sprint Burst argument...isn't an argument. BVHR fixed one Survivor-aiding bug faster than a Killer-aiding bug. It was probably easier to fix. If they wanted Survivors to not heal, they would make more things apply Broken.
---
Moris aren't on a whim; they all have conditions. Instant downs all have conditions. Every perk takes a perk slot that denies other perks. Have you ever played Killer? Go ahead, give Billy a whirl. Let me know when you're red ranked.
---
Yes I agree. Upvote given. Well said
---
thank you for keeping the tradition alive
---
An if you’re a killer main it’s not fair that survivors get 6 new perks while you only get 3
---
Nah. Demi is feral IMO.  maybe intelligent feral but feral regardless.
---
And tell the killers that ignore these people to go check behind the wall in the other corner of the map and get me. Never lucky.
---
Tossic survivors how dare you use perks amirite?
---
I am
---
I don't think so. those "bots" in the tutorial are either 100% scripted or (the meg that runs away from you when you're the killer/the trapper that's behind the black wall) are just going toward/away from you in a straight line
---
The Plag bester
---
Deep wound causes survivors to bleen out
---
I mean that depends if you did or did not camp...
---
If game glitches and u cant escape bc of that then yes. If u wouldnt its pure toxiety
---
Not what hes tweeting about.  The meme is silly (his words).  The comments it spawned are not.
---
It ain't a bad movie, I just don't remember those kids looking like they got deep fried by Satan
---
Oh they definitely can. Usually killer benefits from it tho.
---
She can be pretty tough to go against but as others said, Spine Chill can help. Also, when you’re in a chase with a Spirit, watch the shards in her body. They’ll glow a bit when she’s phasing.
---
Everything is updated and this mouse is just garbage and the software is garbage
---
That’s not quite how statistics work, you can’t just add the percentage chance of something happening together per attempt. 
---
If that were the case, then flipping a coin (50/50) twice would result in a 100% chance of getting heads once
---
might've been /s, but you still called them trash with all caps
---
also, not everyone gets what /s stands for
---
Saw's a saw, m8.
---
I always play against bots.
---
Hopefully not soon. I want to enjoy the game.
---
Only if you're a survivor tho. Only survivors are toxic.
---
Fuck I lost again
---
Well, that's true, but it's only a general idea.
---
Of course, Whispers seems to appear fairly early, so it's a temporary issue, anyway.

Her passive is a Boombox that follows her around blaring her music. This forces survivors to go into a channel where the rip their ears off. If this action is not completed within five seconds they will automatically commit suicide.

---
your processor might have some problems with sending commands to the game. do you have stable FPS? try lowering your settings or reinstalling the game
---
people say its bad because there's other things you could be doing instead of healing, but nobody ever wants to fucking heal me after saving me from a hook, they just run away from me and then i don't know what to do because nobody has bond. In SWF it could probably be replaced with something else like empathy or bond so you know where the people who need healing are.
---
Honestly, looks more like it's Kill Count themed than DbD, aside from the tally.
---
Still cool, though.
---
Its affected by the heat of the flashlight
---
All good mate
---
You may have a 4% chance of escaping the hook

*but you have a 0% chance of escaping math*

It’s hard to tell from his POV but I turned my head as I carried the guy down the stairs and I saw him  get in the locker as I was falling

Ok thats a little far
---
#NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE
---
Hes already in the game tho
---
You tru3 fans ( and tru3 himself)  are exaggerating the hell out of these snipers.  Not only were they terrible but he had Moris for them most of the time. And on top of that the most they ever did was get rid of whatever totems he had. Seriously guys.
---
so you just suck, ok then
---
Tru3: it's a silly meme that spawned stupid comments.  Those comments are bullshit.
---
People in this very thread: Tru3 needs to stop being butthurt over a meme!  Hes a bad streamer!
---
Good job, guys.  You're proving his point very nicely.
---
One second later and DS would have run out. 
---
Thank god you didn't miss it - I probably would under that pressure!
---
Whispers actually often works better for finding survivors btw. I mostly use BBQ for points
---
essentially it just depends on how much you can rely on your team

all 4 of them

I'm referring to his tweet, you goof.

I thought this was tru3 talking about like, comments not the meme?

But that's stream sniping /s
---
I know right!
---
Great meme. See you in hot
---
I used to enjoy his streams a long time ago but not anymore, he’s gotten so much more defensive, whiny, condescending, and egotistical as time has went on. Not to mention his chat and his mods will crucify anyone who doesn’t agree with him, which has happened to me a few times. Not a fun stream to be in if you have a slightly different opinion on something. I want to be understanding considering the man probably has his fair share of troubles when he streams, but it really is ridiculous the amount of negativity there is in that stream.
---
The demogorgon looks like an uncircumcised penis while it's mouth is closed.

Yes but if something is being mind controlled they're forced do what they're told to you, can be the most intelligent and feral creature alive but if you are being mind controlled you aren't consciously making decisions to do something you are doing what some higher power is telling you to do.

Crazy noisy bizarre town
---
DLC survivors might not have that but for people like Nea and Feng,  they come with the game so why not add them to Leatherface’s collection or f faces
---
Not if whatever preventative put in place says UNLESS IN A CHASE. Thats easily debunked. Try again with your edgy "QQ" comment.
---
Tunneling is a garbage strategy. And you're garbage if you do it. Plain and simple. I just finished 5 games in a row where i didn't tunnel or camp and 4 manned all of them. Playing as trapper and bubba. (This btw answers your "have you even played killer" comment.)
---
My sprint burst comment IS an argument. Because the heal problem was around before the sprint burst. But they fixed something survivors got an advantage off of before the disadvantage.
---
The "on a whim part" is more about "Oh I hooked you ONCE, well bye." Lets just bypass the other hook they get to not die on, and the possibility of a shoulder save on the third. And as for the perk slots, who looks at NOED and goes "nah something else is better"
---
Also. Youre recommending i play Billy. AKA one of the killers everyone bitches is used too much in high ranks. Why? HE'S TOO FUCKING EASY.

As a survivor running like a headless chicken, I can confirm this accuracy.

fookin dwight FAIRFIELD

As a killer main, I am going to have a hard time bringing myself to hang up a strong, single mother of 6. I mean Nancy is going to be hard to string up too, but not as much emotional baggage.
---
He's talking about the toxic little teabag at the end (which the Freddy didn't see, he was still stunned and facing away).
---
i gotchu
---
I respect your admiration of single mothers.
---
I got banned because they THOUGHT i made a thread about him on the subreddit. It was hilarious but funny at the same time.
---
So I thought. 
---
I guess the lesson is - never assume your joke is obvious. It only takes one (two including the Mod) person to not understand it for shit to go down.

Performance-wise this game is a god compared to Friday lol
---
You think Bond isn't a strong perk? What are you on
---
What the hell kind of title is that
---
Just to clarify, he said the meme was silly and fine, he just got upset over the comments
---
Bamboozle is one of the most important killer perks in the game, namely for M1 killers to be able to deal with long-wall windows efficiently. Since it can also be used on every other window, it's also one of the strongest killer perks in the game.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel is the second-best stalling perk after Ruin, and can be used alongside the latter to great effect.
---
Clown itself is a solid mid-tier killer that at latest with his add-ons can be considered high mid or even high tier. He's not riveting to play or anything, but doesn't get boring either, due to the interactive and chase-centered nature of his ability, and there's a rewarding learning curve (literally) to mastering the bottle throws. He has pretty cool cosmetics too, if you're into that.
---
Sad how we can all agree she doesn’t need to be nerfed but she’s been nerfed 7 or 8 times
---
I need this with her P3 head
---
*The Plant Face*
---
As a novice killer, this something I've still yet to do.
---
Imagine rage quitting because somebody used addons, perks, or a particular killer. Survivors have no room to talk lol
---

---
i mean ghostface was a killer only dlc
---
k
---
Well I doubt you’ll get Jason since he has his own similar game but we’ll see if your right
---
I mean you could just live your life and let him have his no? You don’t like him ok. Go watch those you like and let him be. As for “kinda reasonable to see WHY Tru3 gets so much hate.” Theres no reason on hate. I get what you mean but that aint it chief. But why should I expect people on the internet to be decent human beings? If youre mistaken by a troll he is always open for a chat on twitter dms if youre banned from his channel. So you know everything is fixable. Hate isnt. ;)
---
And that's a fact
---
I mean tbf he said that the meme was silly and that the comments were circlejerkey. He doesn’t seem offended by the meme, but the comments get verrry insulty. I would be a lil hurt too in his shoes but 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah i doubt they don't think so, i think they wwre just thinking about killers when making this because they were remembering ghost face
---

I'm interested in replying but I'm very busy atm

Just FYI Freddy’s lunge is the exact same as all other killers, it just looks longer because he’s a manlet and is like half the size of the other killers
---
Yeah
---
Yeah but why would you care about survivors going for unsave during patrolling? It's a good thing they aren't sitting on gens
---
Hiding in lockers is like ~10 seconds, I wouldn't say it's a real pressure on gens. Besides, you can just hide besides the gens or use aura hiding perks. Overall, I don't consider it a pressure if they are still working on gens, but yeah at least if they know I have BBQ and are hiding in lockers it's better than nothing I guess
---
Well there are a lot of them...they just aren't as big or as good. (For that matter, Tru3'e sub count is in the top 50 of twitch and by "big" I meant sodapoppin and bahroo who occasionally play this game but aren't great). He gets a lot of "press' because he is the biggest streamer now.

"I imagine you to be like a Gothy Feng Min i saw in a Dojin" some creepy-ass shit like that.

The seller of these does Xbox controllers to, so there could possibly be one for it.
---
I'm actually rank 10. Its funny you're assuming I'm just garbage. So im playing at decent ranks with "bad killers" 
---
Lets go with the green mori. Its ANY survivor you've hooked. That ONE DEATH that can be achieved within 5 minutes if you're good is enough to doom a team.
---
I rarely use NOED. Its mostly on my killers i havent leveled up yet and i dont have other perks on. I also dont run ruin unless I have nothing better. I actually run thanataphobia. Or a combo of both.
---
Can't play nurse. Console controls are ass trying to play her. Its why noone sees her on console. My Billy is level 1 and will stay that way. Nurse is only level 40 for calling. And I'm not buying spirit. I main ghostface. And so far, I've never been shut out as him. Killer IS easy. The problem with "high ranks" is that ONLY SWF play high ranks, to counter the fact that killer is way too easy. Just look at the killers in red ranks. 
---
Billy - one of the fastest killers in game, cross map sprint, instant down
---
Nurse - fuck all your loops, obstacles, pallets, and distance.
---
Spirit - I will be honest, ive only played against spirit twice. My knowledge comes from videos. She plays mind games and is a genuinely hard killer. I respect spirit players.
---
Would be cool if he roared, and summoned baby’s to kill for him.
---
Im pretty sure the devs said they wouldn't do a shape shifting killer
---
Platform: Xbox one

Deliverance sometimes work despite it being active and showing the clover in the bottom left.

How much did it cost? Was it around $60 or $70?
---
Double blood points start September 5th-9th
---
Yeah I mean The Doctor is quiet a shock to watch
---
I tend to adapt my style once I've gauged the survs skill to make for funner games. Facing four potatoes?  Maybe that dwight can chill on the ground while I investigate that lone gen approximately 23 miles away.  Stronk SWF obviously using comms?  Hope you like the basement.
---
If you can get a chain going by properly predicting an unhook, it's a valid strategy. Though must Survivors get wise and don't try to save the second person.
---
It's really all circumstantial. If they have aura-hiding perks, BBQ is just for the BP, but if it's an altruism-hungry team, Whispers is too vague. They both have merit, but BBQ always does because of that thicc BP bonus.
---
This seems like a decent design. The only real issue I have is that swf playing with discord will be a hard counter
---
Introduce them to Game Hag
---
Every surv that uses Iron Will while he uses Spirit
---
Oh yeah, I figured grouped up survivor players would be a pretty hard counter to the idea.
---
yup, exactly
---
First level Nancy for perks, than prestige Steve
---
I got that too wtf
---
apologies 💯 will you forgive me?
---
I think reinstalling will do the trick then. if not, make sure your drivers are all updated
---
I am very open to suggestions/criticisms, always like improve on my concepts.
---
 Well played, just don’t stand close to the hook after hooking a survivor because it makes you lose blood points

I'm not familiar with Solidworks, but that reminds me of Kseniya Simonova's sand art.  Looks really nice!
---
SWF doesn't have in-game voice chat. I didn't say SWF was cheating, and it's not implicitly (although it does offer an advantage). Voice chatting is cheating.
---
Some Killers are less impacted by the chatting, like Freddy. They all are to some degree.
---
Fair enough.
---
Unnecessary negativity from someone who probably isnt even the best themselves if they're worried about new players. I love it 😂
---
Need a rank of 11-15
---
I had this glitch earlier too lol, it kept going even while i was walking and all
---
Holy shit I actually never noticed that! Also sweet mask!
---
You're $8 to me get outta here ya weirdo.
---
I mean if those morons use Twitch name as their Steam name, what do they expect. At least someone is watching their shitty stream.
---
Definitely. They’re really trying to make the game more fun for survivors, which is great because unfortunately there are still some people that think camping and tunneling is an actual good strategy.
---
jake is based off alex, the doctor’s voice actor and namesake of Alex’s Toolbox.
---
4K = camping, right?
---
One of the best feelings.
---
I think by mesh he means the 3d model, so the cgi model they used in the show will be the same as the model used in Dbd. Not sure about the cg he's talking about tho
---
Is this a certified bruh moment right now?
---
How about slippery meat🤔
---
I read it as the shitter
---
Yeah, Steve and Nancy aren’t cg lol
---
This hurts pigs feelings :c
---
"some of the DBD playerbase"
---
Yeah I've some bad news for you..
---
They can’t use that either, vegans can’t beat their meat
---
I've barely played for months. I can finally pay it forward. :')
---
Infectious fright and Monitor..
---
For a moment I thought he was healing The Pig which would've been even funnier
---
A basement party? Without inviting me? How dare you!!
---
ok hear me out  
---
on the stream, the devs which are the dwight guy, the bald guy and the 3rd guy I forgot, they said that Netflix gave them the mesh model for the flower guy BUT they did NOT give them the mesh for the 2 survivors  
---
so that means the 2 survivors that are in the show might actually be actual people and not generated by the computers at netflix!
---
For little girls and boys to eat?

I would love to have less time to wait to play as the killer on ps4

If you get stressed playing ANY game, you need to sort your life out.

I vow to uphold this code, godspeed baby Steve's o7
---
Remember when there is one perk that counters an other perk then the perk that gets countered can never be used again...ever...
---
So this is a meme question, ok lol
---
Sorry :(
---
I love good Pigs tho, if they’re struggling and haven’t played scummy then I’ll give myself up for them. Don’t like bullying people using non-meta killers.
---
well, that would make me wait less to play as the killer on console, so yeah, great
---
No one's going to make that mistake. The fact that the announcement was clearly emphasizing it being Stranger Things in the first place kinda tips them off.
---
It’s chaser emblem, not BP. But in any case, you have a short window before the game counts you as being in close proximity so you can admire the work at the very least.
---
And Ash was only survivor. Your point?
---
A lot of multiplayer games didn't have in-game voice chat back in the days and were still played with it. Honestly I think voice chat is implied as a possibility in any multiplayer game in which you can match with friends.
---
Also I don't really get an argument about if in-game voice chat is there or isn't as a way to define cheating. It's the game design that changes tables. I mean, if BHVR would just add in-game voice chat to DbD, it wouldn't change people's mind, it would just made game worse, because imo in-game chat sucks
---
But yet again. Don't you get benefits as a team with comms basically in any game that has competition and matchmaking with friends, like Dota or CS?
---
Even if, again, it was that much game braking. I often have much easier time with SWFs because they tend to be more careless.
---
I already had it and bought it in the shrine just to flex 💪
---
I'm gonna consolidate answers on alot of your points. SWF is literally the only real advantage survivors have over killers. And you ALL complain that SWF is too hard to fight. All of you.
---
Heres my answer. Git gud. With all the tools at a killer's disposal if you can't walk out with at least 2 kills, you're just bad.
---
Once again insinuating I'm bad. I got my own rank 10, mostly without ruin or NOED because I'm determined to rank up without them. I use them when I want an easy game or I have to do something specific for a ritual.
---
I'm not getting spirit because I refuse to use the "overused killers". Hence why I said billy is still level 1 (while I have hag, doc, ghostface, and bubba all level 40+) and nurse is only level 40 for her perks as well as doctor for overcharge.
---
And as for what I said in the first 2 paragraphs, to sum it up one more time. "Survive with friends is too hard. I need more to help."
---
But remember, not everyone always has 3 friends on. And the more bullshit killers get to combat high ranks, the less new people want to play a game so brokenly killer sided at low ranks because youre crying you cant get a 4k at red ranks every game. Stop crying that you're losing to the ONLY thing survivors *really* have.
---
How is this supposed to work?
---
Well, BHVR shouldn't have rank reset, either. Or they should offer rewards for being a certain rank per season.
---
Right now, the biggest punishment for a killer DCing is they are forced to play easier games. What a punishment.
---
Sometimes they line up for you. They'll accuse you of camping when in reality every time you try to leave you spot another survivor
---
Just read the post dude, I doubt you care *that* much about someone’s ‘tone’ online.
---
Trying to be sneaky? Is that new?
---
When I had this happen none of them were sneaky about it but still called me a camper XD
---
^(cries in corner of the basement)
---
Scratched mirror is better
---
as sad as it may be I actually asked myself for a few seconds before making the post why netflix only gave the mesh model for the killer to bhvr and not the survivor ones also lol
---
Tbh, its not a massive nerf but it is a slight nerf to noed and hopefully people will stop complaining now that they have a reason to do bones
---
Same
---
I never said it was appropriate, but you did make it sound worse than it is
---
Exactly!!!
---
Haha, Steve and Nancy are played by human actors as stranger things isn’t an animated show so there wouldn’t be a mesh for them.
---
Can you really expect anything more from the steam forums?
---
Claudettes legit are so useless.
---
Does this guy ever NOT act butthurt over something? Everyone's a stream sniper. Can't take a joke. Bloated ego. I'd rather watch Monto, who acts like a black hole of happiness.
---
Technician reduces the sounds a survivor makes while repairing, not the gen itself. A good killer will always come near a gen if he hears it. That's why Technician is a useless perk
---
What about Sloppy Butcher?
---
You should said domething like just a milisecond away and i would have watched it wondering if you wpuld escape or not, i would have felt anxious too 😔
---
It can be really useful to juke/lose killers like Nurse and Spirit.

I'm sorry, but boobs make it for a clear winner as far as I'm concerned.
---
I wouldn't have been so harsh, but it does prove me when people just buy a game and then ask people how to play.
---
It's a video game. They're designed to be accessible. It isn't really rocket science to learn some basic strategy after a bit of trial and error.
---
You're not allowed to make jokes on this subreddit
---
Yeah! That would be cool! But with him not for him. I will be so happy if he just puts survivors head in his mouth and eats it xD
---
Hmmmm but fanboys and salty cunts downvote the truth buddy, they dont wanna hear it!
---
Watch whoever you want. This is not about that. I was just being reasonable about the situation. It wasn’t personal any of that. Even I, his mod, have versed him several times and chat calls out sniper. Its silly and at this stage its a meme. Don’t take it so badly. 💚 Im glad she plays safe with small game like I do. Enjoy the game and have fun.
---
I 2nd this motion, more fun and more appropriate to Patrick stars face and my face when I get a 4K with 5 gens left still :,)
---
I'm a survivor main so I knew when I started playing killer I should get ruin ASAP, I'm new to killer but not to dbd
---
Hey, need to blend in any way you can, right?
---
...
---
do survivors even need to eat, let alone use the bathroom in the entity's realm?
---
I want a werewolf killer but let's really mix it up. Whenever there's a werewolf killer the start in survivor skin with no terror radius looking like one of the four survivors. They can do gens and everything for the first 30-60 seconds. Then the full moon comes out and the killer is revealed. Would make for some awesome oh fuck moments when Dweet explodes into a furry monster right next to you on gen
---
I've never used Corsair mice, have you tried a different mouse to test this theory?
---
Killer picked him up right as he got to gate tho
---
Looks good but could use tweaking. Though the PTB is for that. Anything that gets us more players, fun, and variety is good
---
So none of the things I mentioned ever happen in the game? I must've been playing the wrong game then, I guess, because the game I'm playing is mainly about killing people in various ways vs. avoiding to be killed in various ways.
---
What’s your GT or email?
---
Tbh, when everyone is hooked in the basement, it looks like a Christmas tree mixed with the holloween spirit.
---
But if they don’t have scoops ahoy for Steve
---
Platform:ps4
---
Type of bug: either noone is playing or it's not matchmaking. Been waiting over 10 minutes
---
I pretty much only watch Bricky at this point
---
Existing is toxic
---
It's kind of just a numbers game unless there were a better way to more accurately measure individual player skill.  If you think there is the same percentage of skilled players at ranks 15-20 as you do 1-5, then I respectfully disagree.  Absolutely there are players that are ranked in that 15-20 group that are more skilled than some in the 1-5 group, but overall the matchmaking leads to more fair/balanced matches than if there were no rank system at all.  It's far from perfect, with more than a desirable number of outliers, but it's disingenuous to say there is no skill gap between ranks whatsoever.
---
With new players joining all the time, having some sort of rank/method to separate veterans from brand new players initially is very important.  It's not fun to be matched against people significantly better than you.  The current system doesn't prevent it 100%, but it's much better than throwing them straight against the rank 1 players.
---
So play Nurse
---
Dope concept. Maybe a little adjustments for the perks and power, then it's good.
---
Wow thx
---
The perks were inspired by Ghostface and endgame killers
---
people knowing about you is toxic
---
I managed that against a streamer using old Freddy. he was so pissed.
---
Not yet but I'm definitely tempted to.... Money is tight yo
---
I'm pretty sure if you don't know how to stop it from continuing you'd probably not get banned for magically becoming faster through no fault of your own. 100% would literally just Mario Kart lap the map for funsies.
---
Dwight deserves better than that awful recreation
---
SAME
---
This hurts to watch
---
This build is garbage. Monitor with Infectious Fright is pretty much a waste unless the survivors are all right on top of each other.
---
This doesn't make sense, so survivors derank ed for rank reset but killers derank ed on purpose? It should be all the other way around
---
Or Game Nurse. Ignores differences in elevation entirely.
---
Corrupt intervention looks pretty good. I've seen some people use that over ruin.
---
Well that’s cool but I’m just reminding people to be nice on both sides, is there something wrong with that?
---
I'm not familiar with that. I made the model and 3d printed it, so that's what's posted
---
It's already been confirmed, theres a picture to prove it
---
So you manage to play a few hours every week but still can't get past brown ranks during the whole month? I call bs on that
---
In the sacrifice level itself there are multiple tanks and that’s what he has to dodge to start the last generator
---
Michael has been shot and lived just fine, I doubt a throwing a pebble at him is going to do anything at all aside from maybe make him angry
---
What? If you're in a fight, and your opponent has a random cramp that's not his fault. You're gonna take advantage of that and Knock him out. It's the same thing here. Except instead of The cramp it's the glitch
---
You know survivors can be assholes too right?
---
Never heard of vegan BBQ or vegan chili? Both exist and are delicious.
---
Due to his lack of mobility, I feel like thrill is an underwhelming perk and would probably replace it with bbq eventually. Otherwise idk, I only just started playing him
---
Too bad the main bloodpoints perk for survivors does nothing else while the one for killer lets them see almost everyone after a hook
---
Corrupt Intervention is good, but I'd say just get Plague cause she has multiple teachables that are good. I've seen Distortion used pretty well, too, so it's probably worth picking up.
---

I mean if Kate wouldn't have a bikini but a nice cowgirl corset would've been perfect
---
This is so specific but so relatable at the same time
---
Very un self aware guy
---
But your terror radius is 8 meters larger than normal in a chase.
---
I had him to prestige 1 the first day and took a pause from dbd later but the only reason why i have thrill is becouse my ruin always gets destroyed and becouse i don’t have any better perks to replace jt
---
I've had a few games where I just get stuck on a gen and can't do anything until the killer pulls me off
---
I kinda see his point this game is toxic and sooner or later you have too deal with it
---
Bro he checked their steam accounts they were the same people
---
Yo dude that skenario is so different to video game glitch. Play fairly so everyone has fun
---
Lose
---
This whole comment section is another circle jerk
---
Probably because you just left them down.
---
Hey I'm not the only one that used those two add-ons. BTW Nice nurse plays.
---
Because PC Nurse is incredibly unfun to play against when the Killer is good. Also the head shake, while not totally uncalled for (it was their fault for clustering against a Nurse who can obviously land her blinks) probably didn't help. Add in a dash of "I can't stand to lose" and you got yourself a stew.
---
I have to fight the urge not to dc against nurses
---
Does feign hook allow you to unhook yourself?
---

I like her playstyle too. She's not the worst, but she definitely needs some help.

Choke me with your big BIG flashlight daddy UwU
---
It's just that I feel like he wouldnt be able to reach the totem on time in 50% of the cases. Using haunted grounds would have a similar effect of increasing the life span of ruin, but also give you an effect you can actually use efficiently
---
Survivors get salty when you have more than 2 blinks and when you slug. Survivors being survivors, shame on you for not following their rulebook!  /s

It is actually game breaking. Was playing SWF yesterday, for instance, and we knew where the killer was at all times. Wasn't fair for him at all.

I feel like haunted grounds does not fit for ghost face. Becouse you just can stalk them while leaning and if you use an add on it take like 2-4 seconds mabye
---
Changling Mist should only last for 20 seconds with a 60 second cooldown. Remove the survivor location in Lock Chest. Generator sabotage should only remove 25% of the current progress and not be entity blocked. Remove Killer in Survivors Skin. Remove the perks Lost Lamb and Split Up. The seconds in Last Light should be 2/3/4.
---
Is it on amazon forest?
---
Shhhhh, you should know not to go against killer hivemind here.
---
I think that Sheriff Hopper should have been in the game
---
I'm just saying that if it happens, record it and report it too, as a single report from a killer perspective recording could certainly result in a ban.
---
Not to be a downer or an ass or anything, but is it legal to sell those? Since they profit off of it?
---
&gt;don’t be an asshole and ur all good
---
Are we talking about the killer or survivor now?
---
I've already depipped back to base rank 16, because that totally means I'm ready to take on rank 12-7s, all of the time, with a whole team of flashlights. I'm still getting the hang of everything; I just had a couple of lucky games and made it to 16...
---
I’ve had the same happen before, it sucks.

Oh god I completely forgot at that. This happened to me a couple days ago. The killer downed me and I healed myself to be picked up. The other survivors came to try and pick me up, but they couldn't. I was like omg these toxic trolls are just going to let me die. 2 of the survivors were standing next to me trying to pick me up, but I thought they were messing with me. At the end of the game they said they couldn't pick me up. I cri T.T
---
i remember watching this movie as a kid, loved every second of it.
---
I think people are underestimating the demogorgon. It can place portals very quickly, but it takes forever for survivors to break them. It has the new buffed stealth status after travelling through a portal, and survivors have the new oblivious status while working on a portal. The lunge is kind of just icing on the cake
---
The little crouch at the end made it
---
Ok. If u have hard time against flashlights try lightborn perk
---
I mean, I'm waiting so I can have some fun with scratched Myers, which is one of the most unique and enjoyable experiences in the game on either side of it
---
Depends, first movie maybe even though she's a glorified space trucker. Second movie then I demands the suit xD
---
Yes
---
Stab that pedophile right in the eye through his glasses!
---
Isn't one meter from the window a normal lunge?
---
Did you make this post hoping for people to tell you you’re good? You know why they DC’d. A 3 blink nurse who’s BMing and slugging knowing it’s not balanced, hence devs working on changing her add-ons. Come on, dude...
---
Bro I used to play with this guy and after a game where he lost he told the killer that there are children in Africa that are starving and him (the killer) eating is just denying them food so he should do the world a favor and kill themselves. 
---
Probably the most toxic player I’ve ever played with.
---
I recently just started playing and yeah I’ve gotten used to it. 
---
Got a 4K in one of my early games was called a baby and told one day I’ll grow a brain and have enough brain cells to be considered an actual living organism.
---
They were all rank 20-18...
---
Also kind of combats gen rushing without the need of ruin so that's another win
---
As far as I could find he was #50 (lul). Even if the numbers are inaccurate it stills suggests a dwarfing of others.
---
Absolutely no idea why anyone would dc against a 3 blink nurse with noed...how dare they, they should get banned!
---
“Damn it not again”
---
I know it won’t solve the problem and people have already addressed they will be better capable of seeing why they dced and hopefully take care of it for people that do it constantly but...
---
They have said that if a survivor dc’s it will leave behind a husk so the killer can get all of the points off of that and the other players can possibly still get a little extra time while the killer hooks them. And the survivors will get bigger bonuses then what the game offers for a disconnect.
---
Also if the killer disconnects then the game will be “simulated” that you escaped and you will earn appropriate blood points.
---
Again this won’t solve the issue but will make it not as big of an issue for the people that stay.
---
&gt; Changling Mist should only last for 20 seconds with a 60 second cooldown.
---
What about meeting halfway at 60s duration and 75s cooldown? Whenever the mist isn't up, it would make the killer pretty easy to pick out if the survivors' paid attention to who they were in a game with, right? You'd notice if there was suddenly a laurie in your game when there wasn't one before, y'know? and for the rest of the kit to work, it kinda relies on going unnoticed.
---
&gt;Remove the survivor location in Lock Chest
---
That's fair I suppose.
---
&gt;Generator sabotage should only remove 25% of the current progress and not be entity blocked
---
The sabotage just seems like a pretty hefty time investment to me to not at least have it blocked for a little bit. You're sitting on a gen effectively doing nothing to hinder the (up to) 3 other survivors who could each be doing their own gen. So I'll concede on the 25% progress reduction form what it started at, but what about blocking it for only 25s?
---
&gt;Remove Killer in Survivors Skin.
---
Could I ask why? What if they were no longer exposed and it locked you out of disguising yourself as a survivor for a longer period of time, like 60s?
---
&gt;Remove the perks Lost Lamb and Split Up.
---
These are what I'm actually really interested in, why straight up remove them? I thought they weren't too bad, but I could see their numbers being a bit too high.
---
I mean sure if you never wanna get good at the game
---
No clearly you should be mindlessly rescuing people, no matter how close the killer is, and almost guaranteeing I get hooked again.
---
Proof? Because that's simply not true.
---
I am going to pick a side, lmfao, because gen-rushing is what we were initially talking about. Did killers get an update where they can repair generators now? I'm not gonna suddenly start switching to the killer's perspective in a conversation about something only survivors can do. I'm aware a lot of the shit thrown at killers is unfair, but that's not what we're talking about, now is it?
---
The dev's didn't acknowledge shit, lmfao, meta is what the players make it.
---
I also never said gen-rushing wasn't real. It is. But I'm so tired of hearing literally the smallest thing being called gen-rushing. Survivors working on separate gen managing to pop two or three in a short period of time? Gen-rushing, super toxic, even if they aren't in a SWF!
---
Killer chases one person off a gen and another person follows behind and keeps working on it? Gen-rushing, super toxic!
---
It's one thing to call a four-man SWF with toolboxes and BNP add-ons across the board with shit like Technician to make it easier toxic for gen-rushing, because that is pretty toxic. But this culture of 'no matter how they're doing gens, if they're doing them quickly, it's gen-rushing' is fucking stupid and needs to stop, lmfao.
---
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
And, to humor you, since apparently it's a new rule in the killer handbook (that was sarcasm, for anyone who can't tell) that I absolutely have to mention killers in a discussion that has literally been about survivors the entire time...
---
Camping and tunneling accusations? Absolutely stupid 99% of the time. Survivors usually use camping to mean 'the killer did literally anything within 32 meters of the hook after hooking me'. Checking lockers when they have an indication a survivor is near/are playing Huntress? Camping. Looking around when, again, they have an indication a survivor is near the hook? Camping. Kicking a nearby gen? Camping. Coming back to the hook after an unhook only to discover the unhooked survivor has decided to heal directly under the hook/in the open somewhere near the hook? That's an easy down, it's not tunneling if the survivors don't want to make an effort. 
---
That's part of the reason I'm tired of the community. I've had games with survivors who were legit angels and they make it worth it. They're the reason, despite all of the toxicity from both killers and survivors, I stay in the post-game chat long enough to at least say 'gg, gl with your games &lt;3'. Because they make me want to be that change, to be the reason someone stops immediately skipping post-game chat or the reason they keep playing DBD when they were about to get off due to the toxicity. They make me wanna be better. The killers who went out of their way to have mercy on me when I'm the last one? They make it tolerable. They didn't have to do that. I've played with a Piggy who carried me around the map for damn near ten minutes so we could find the hatch. She could've hooked me, and I wouldn't have minded it one bit. She earned the 4k, she downed me, she deserved the hook, and she carried me to the hatch. Killers like that make me want to be better killers, both skill-wise and sportsmanship-wise. 
---
But the thing is, in this sub especially, it's an echo chamber. So seldom do we hear the kind things that survivors and killers did that they didn't have to that we forget that there are a TON of people who go out of their way to do these things - to cheer others up, to lift them up, despite barely being acknowledged. It's common and even encouraged to mud sling and talk shit. The survivors have a 'handbook', the killers do, even if y'all wanna deny it. We have this culture where we criticize literally everything. Playing killers with m2 abilities with our m1 because it's fun? Trash. Playing Claudette? Trash. Running self-care? Trash. Running literally any perk that's not in the meta? Trash. 
---
TL;DR: Gen-rushing is a thing, but not nearly as common as y'all want to believe it is. Tunneling and camping are also a thing, but y'all throw those words around WAY too often. It might cost $0 to be a dick, but it also costs $0 to not be a dick, so... Don't be a dick?
---
dang thats gotta be toxic stuff
---
What?! Did you make this up? Did people complain about being mori'd at the end of the game? They need to grow some thicker skin. If you see the person who complained again, you Mori them after one hook and let the rest live. It's your game, you Mori as you please!
---
Kinky
---
Definitely has nothing to do with 3 blink Nurse.
---
idk if they were all streaming, but the one i recognise is actually a really cool dude, so i'm surprised to hear that. was it Dad or someone else that accused you?
---
Wait so hatch doesn't spawn at beginning of game? Is that to prevent locker Dwight?
---
I've also wanted to do this so bad. I've only been able to put up 3 people on the hook. The remaining survivor just camped hatch. Good job
---
I did not make this up. I've seen this a lot. In fact, some of my friends bitched at me because I started doing the moris after 3 gens.
---
well one is a walking disease and the other is a Adiris so take a guess
---
If only people knew that the MET gala is just an esoteric party, and this is meant to be Babylonian in nature anyways.
---
Well, you can count on her coming out of it sometime.
---
Beautiful Christmas tree mate. Trust me it'll happen a lot in the lower ranks. Higher ranks too now that I think about it. Basically if you play your cards right it'll happen.
---
You must be a fucking normie to think that REEEEEEE
---
This is the PS 20th anniversary edition controller, nice! Did you keep the original gray chassis aside? Or was it painted over it?
---
I am excited for a lot of reasons.
---
Demogorgan means nonhuman creatures are open for being added
---
His abilities look fine to me. Map pressure and something to help with a chase. Depending on the range and charge time of pounce it could easily trump the D and C tier killers like clown and plague who get destroyed by little things like LoS. Of course the pounces we see are in fairly open areas and I really wonder how Demogorgan is going to work on a jungle gym or infinite loop.
---
In my experience 80% of a chase survivors cling to walls and corners. Is pounce going to be useful there? I dunno. 
---
I like his perks at least from a theoretical level. I want to test them out and try out new combos like surge+PGTW 3 gen strats or Tinkerers and cruel confinement.
---
Plus I really want to know what his add ons will be. If they did this well with the perks maybe his add ons will be actually interesting and good.
---
I dont know, I honestly thought it spawns at beginning of trial, I've seen it closed halfway through the trial but never seen it just spawn like that.
---
People also need to realize that 3/4 of these SWF squads NEED all of that to even have a chance of surviving. For every 10 SWF squads I run into maybe 2 of them are actually competent groups.
---
First off who drew and wrote this a four year old and second way too op
---
everytime I get stunned I have to shift my legs to hide my chub 😩
---
Actually yeah
---
I helped a 6 yr old draw it
---
How are you so blind tho
---
That could be cool. Maybe just some extra bloodpoints or xp
---
Damn! I’ve seen a couple of spots on other maps that work in a similar way, it sucks!
---
Rewards, no that's a bit too much.
---
But letting them know they've received a thumbs up (or report for that matter) should be a basic feature.
---
Nah
---
As survivor you can go commando, most killers needs at least 2 green addons to be even playable.
---
The demogorgon recoils in disappointment as you try to blind something with no eyes
---
When did they confirm that?
---
Shitty Genetics!
---
Alright, so what if Lost Lamb no longer revealed them to the killer, but just put some sort of status effect on them? I made some changes to split up, but if only one perk should reveal, I'd like to have it be that one(I like the idea of a "reverse" discordance).
---
Thoughts on the powers you had brought up that I tried to make changes to?
---
so glad to see florpus memes on this sub now too
---
Are you wearing flashy clothes? You probably stick out across the map. 
---
Use spinechill to avoid the killer. Don't run or you leave scratch Mark's. I like running a lot so I use lightweight personally.
---
You don't play fairly so nor do they and they DC, what are you mad about?
---
Hey. Sam here. Nothing has been written yet as I need to finish Stranger Things, I stopped in the middle of Season 2. I can say that it will most definitely include Demogorgon, Steve, Nancy and Freddy's rework. We will also see what happened to Tapp after the wedding. Since I'm currently working on a full-blown animation parody of Links Awakening that won't come out until late Sept, DBD8 will be a bit late (as always). It'll probably come out sometime in early October.
---
It was on sale for $15 like a week ago. Damn....
---
I would like to see more killer dull totem perks to encourage cleansing them. I belive it further will encourage survivors to actualy do them. Even better if a counter for totems is introduced.
---
It’s the next DLC, lol.
---
Not lucky
---
Ugh I hate statistics hoped to avoid them during the Vacation but now here we are once again :(
---
Que Hello Darkness My Old Friend...
---
It was Dad’s stream but I should’ve clarified in my earlier comment that it was his chat calling me a sniper, not him if I remember correctly. Nothing against the streamers that I played against
---
The only way that game is getting revived is if an entirely different company buys the license or if it gets entirely remade.
---
Gun has completely cut and run from that game. No new content is coming and it's still broken with a paper thin lifeline of a playerbase.
---
The game isn't coming back. It's more likely that DBD gets Jason than his game ever making a comeback given how completely unwilling Gun is to continue work on it.
---
Or they could bank on the new players, and won't have it on sale anytime soon. They recently had it on sale for $15 a week ago. 
---
That would suck...
---
your style is so fun! any chance you have an Instagram we can check out?
---
Survivors are assholes, that's why you kill them. Don't follow their rules kill them as you like. I also suggest playing survivor and build your own personal rules based off what you do and don't like that happens to you.
---
Toxic Misty main
---
You are just whining tbh. Flashlights sucks ass nowadays. I would understand if there was still instablinds.
---
You gotta just look past that. I get a lot of games against SWF groups. They all do the flashlight spamming, teabagging, hook blocking, and taunting. I constantly get harrassed by those groups and get told to uninstall and that I'm the worst player ever. Which is not true, but whatever. I still say gg even though they say all those things. I just think it's a cultural thing now. People get off on being assholes towards others.
---
I see a lot of streamers get sniped and trolled to death. Then the survivors apologize and say it was for the memes. I just feel bad for the non streamers or your average day Joe that doesnt get the apology. They can be having a bad day and just want to play a game. Not get harrassed and told to kill yourself because you're not the best player ever. Or because you couldn't get kills against an organized team.
---
One time I just started the game I was survivor and the killer was freddy (before rework) i started and freddy already when I was at got down, he face camped me, and got unhooked by a dwight, then moried and that game happened at 30 seconds
---
Wow I'm just really unlucky lol I'll just either wait till it goes on sale again or get another PlayStation card
---
Wow you’re good! Is that the attention you wanted?
---
That happened to me once while i was being chased
---
He's a pedophile.
---
Honestly i love it when someone new joins it means more players for matchmaking and a new experience for them
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cuwfw4/bug_the_hag_stuck_in_a_pallet_after_teleporting/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Don't immediately run when you hear a heart beat, figure out what killer you're playing against first, then make notes of pallet locations where you could run to loop a killer if he does see you, if you drop a pallet or pallet stun leave that loop once he breaks the pallet unless it's an unsafe pallet i.e. the killer can easily walk around to your side of the used pallet.
---
Getting good at looping doesn't happen overnight and sometimes the hit boxes screw you, but don't DC and ruin everyone else's experience
---
Wait I always thought that it spawned at 3 gens left
---
Skill fetish in general has killed so many games for me. I understand the desire to win and to prove that you're better than others but it's when people use a virtual badge as a gun and badge to shoot others without consequence it becomes disgusting. I quit Overwatch for a number of reasons &gt;!(devs balance the game around whoever cries the loudest as opposed to what actually needs balance, since they know people will stop watching OWL if their favourite characters aren't played. The state of heroes like Mercy, Bastion, and "It's Nerf or nothing!" Symmetra prove this)!&lt; but one of the big reasons is that the community will flame you if you're any rank other than Grandmaster, which is ridiculous cause it's been proven that most people are around Platinum anyways. I think being high rank has its merits but Dirty Bomb's Rule #1 of ["Don't be a dick"](https://youtu.be/YuCMOtIostE?t=82) translates to online discussion as well. Don't be a pompous asshole who wears their virtual medal like the Queen's badge of honour. You can click on people better than others? So what? Doesn't mean those people aren't worth talking to. Even geniuses can get ideas from the common folk.
---
Also happy Cake Day.
---
Wow you really researched this topic for a Reddit comment 
---
But I still believe he’s not going to be in the game and if he is you can have that I told you so
---
This is just a reupload of a really old post :(
---
For real. Survivors can do anything and everything to make sure they all escape, but killers should have to close their eyes and count to ten after getting a hit. Ya know. To be fair.
---
That's very cool. I like it better too than infinite universes theory, especially since 'infinite' doesn't mean 'all possibilities exist', it just means 'no numerical limit'. It would still be a huge coincidence.
---
So yeah your theory is my headcanon now. It stands to reason that the Entity may focus on harvesting from adjacent universes that may already be influencing each other, rather than travelling further afield.
---
God I hate seeing survivors make idiotic moves, and have the outcome like this. I've never had this happen to me and never will. 3 dudes down near basement means STAY AWAY sheesh.
---
Whenever you down anybody it always acts like a chase so you always get the increased terror radius except for locker and gen grabs
---
It often goes on sale, so I wouldn't doubt it. Probably worth the wait then.
---
Also credit to the ranking system: it does usually put people where they belong based on skill level. If you're not intentionally trying to stay at low rank you'll probably move up the ranks pretty quickly.
---
1st and third should be switched
---
Things that survivors do, dont stop the killer from playing the game and literally give them no chance.
---
It doesnt work together the chase Ends the second u Down a Person
---
yay!
---
Completely unnecessary with a 3 blink noed nurse..
---
... Small game and detectives hunch already exist.
---
lol. How fortuitous! No, the best way I've heard it communicated was that toxic (broken/OP/downright rude) killer behavior leads to toxic survivor behavior, and vice versa, causing this downward, unpleasant spiral. Yeah, sometimes perks and situations coincide just right and the other player is just left with jaw dropped. But theres no need for a killer to carry someone to the hatch judt to close it in their face. Theres no need for a survivor to intentionally get downed just to use decisive strike and teabag circles around the killer before bailing. Yeah, those are legal moves. But asshole ones. Which results in the other player going "I'll show them" and being awful the next round.
---
Ok but he immediately makes up for it since HE FUCKING SCREECHES AFTER HITTING SOMEONE
---
They're a species, they go through things like puberty, the adults of the species are the ones that will be in the game (though I think the one that is coming in game is a little smaller than the average), the dog version you see is a younger version. Im pretty sure when theyre born theyre like leeches
---
Generally speaking evading a ban will result in another ban yes.
---
It's beautiful, good job fellow baby killer !
---
I have an oddly high amount of basement parties on my hag at 400 hours. I got 2 in consecutive games and another one later that week. You definitely need a lot to come together 
---
Good job getting your first!
---
I still find it hilarious that cardi b isn’t in prison

https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-you-re-either-part-of-the-solution-or-you-re-part-of-the-problem-eldridge-cleaver-5-79-54.jpg
---
Everytime I win as a survivor I get the message "couldn't update rank" and get kicked out and it hinders me at ranking up completely. Any fix for that?
---
The actual percentage of at least one person succeeding (after all 12 attempts) is around 38%. This is without any luck additions or perks that will increase that percentage. Still not too shabby.
---
yep make another accnt, and never confess you had a banned one before?
---
PS4, Wounded Healer trophy still bugged.
---
Their staff told me I can open another account. They said If It was a hvid ban then I couldn't open another account but If It's a perma ban I can start another one.
---
I even told them I opened another account after my ban (we spoke on private) There was a problem with my new one and I asked them something about it.
---
That killer messed up perhaps the most unsafe pallet in existence lol
---
Seriously this. I don't particularly like the guy, but the amount of unnecessary hate he gets is unreal.  If people don't like his content they can just not watch it.
---
It has nothing do w the type of cloth or her eyes. Her and Wraith (and most likely Demogorgon) are effected by lightburn. It’s a function that has been in the game since day 1. That’s why you can blind wraith out of cloak and nurse out of blink. I am assuming the demogorgon will work similar.
---
happens to me too. a good tip is to hide in a locker for a minute at the start of a match. though sometimes a survivor will keep opening the locker with u in it, thinking ure not participating instead of just compensating for your usual bad luck
---
Tbh give them Shards. Shards = cosmetics = people wanting to be at high ranks.
---
And honestly even Bloodpoints are fine. It's *an* incentive at least. Currently all high ranks gets you is tryhards. In a way I sympathize with derankers, even if I think you're a jackass for doing it.
---
After the August savings sale. Which ends September 3rd. Right around the time the dlc drops. Or on Friday if theirs a flash sale perhaps.
---
When ST dlc comes out, it should also go on sale. Unless they withhold it from the sale to bank on new players. Although it should go on sale before the ST dlc. It most likely will, since u would still have to buy the ST dlc.
---
Anywhere in the next 4 weeks, u should see it on sale. Check every Tuesday to see if the game Is discounted. 
---
Sometimes it doesn't appear on the sale catalog.
---
No offense but what about all the killers running tinkerer tier 2 so they get no terror radius for the entire game?
---
In any game that I see a twitch tv name, I always try extra hard to fuck with that person
---
Where was the toxicity?
---
10 pallets ...
---
does blood hunt happen before or after dlc?
---
I already did with their staff and they said I can make another account.
---
Using Devor hope makes it harder to double pip because you get less chase time due to insta down and less hook points because you kill them instead of hooking. Also some people like being in low rank to bully newbies.
---
Then that should be enough don’t buy characters for perks because you’ll be pissed when they get changed
---
Why the downvotes?
---
Interesting. Is it after the DLC release or during?
---
We don't need every perk to "beat" ds and bt. Babysitter isn't trying to replace anything, it's trying to be a different perk
---
HENDERSON
---
Before the DLC so its pointless :/
---
*w u t*
---
I love stranger things, but you're not going to see people pick any of these perks over borrowed time or any of the other mid to high tier perks
---
Oh I love his content now. He seems way more down to earth and honestly I cant blame him entirely for the shit he talked in 2017. Loops had double pallets and vacuum back then. I'm surprised a lot of Killer Mains who stuck around til now dont have PTSD
---
That doesn't really matter. There isn't a problem with hitboxes. Only the visual feedback of hits that connect.
---
Absolutely agree :)
---
Yup pretty much and also when you manage to hit every one with frenzy it’s so satisfying because it’s really difficult to do.
---
I couldn't play for past 3 months and now from rank 1 killer I'm rank 20
---
Okay, so you completely ignored the link lmao. Right after that block of text there’s a block that discusses the stun in the blink animation. Great job.
---
Me: provides a link to the exact wiki page with the exact information while also leaving the important text in the message 
---
You: completely ignores all of it to say you “think” it’s not talking about that when you literally have the link right there to read
---
I began watching stranger things today, and I can remember this scene perfectly
---
The devs have said many times hitboxes work as intended, but the visuals showing it mess up sometimes.
---
The fuck?  Emmm no?
---
Can you actually read?
---
Even outside of that, the hitboxes are inconsistent though? It’s been an issue for a while? Lmao
---
We also had leather face as a Solo killer
---
And Bill as a solo survivor to match that.
---
Right? Who even uses perks??? Let's just not use anything. In fact, screw it, don't finish gens too quickly either. Pretty toxic to do gens too quickly.
---
No you’re not doing anything wrong, but keep in mind that for the survivor being unhooked and hooked, it’s incredibly frustrating and feels hopeless. The unhooked survivor could do nothing to prevent that, and nothing to counter it because in that moment, they’re at your and their teammates mercy. 
---
That’s their two hooks in the spam of a minute. They’re dead on hook if theyre unhooked, when it happens to me, unless the game is nearly done, the match has now become a waste of time and I don’t care if I die.
---
They were true yellow ranks, but the killer wasn’t. Buddy had Tier 3 Ruin on Ghostface so probably a deranker.
---
Thank you, glad to hear! I do have an instagram, I post a lot of random stuff but also art!

why not both?
---
I joined around the same time and hated when ghost faces would abused new survivors. Most don’t pay much attention to their surroundings when working on a generators so then can stalk them while standing right behind them.
---
A recent update this summer has messed with the timing of those grasp save stuns. wait a half second longer than usual, even if it means it gives the killer opportunity to look up.
---
Flashlight saves for example won't work even if the killer has just began moving.  The blind/stun happens before it registers for some reason. This is why youll  noticea flashlight save also happens even if the killer turned around at the last second and their head is facing away from the flashlight. I'm not really sure what's wrong, but something messed it up this summer
---
I said that I've never heard that you can stun her if she isn't charging a blink, and I also said that I'm almost positive that the nurse section is referring to when she is charging a blink. The little text just says she can't charge a blink when being flashed, it doesn't support the prior claim that she can be stunned without interaction with her blink.
---
Also it's kinda funny. The trivia part literally states that other killers don't interact with the spirit world, and thus they do not suffer from lightburn, which is kinda what I originally said. Look at your own link please.
---
I only got 9k shards
---
If thats the case, he doesnt and its just luck
---
Imagine thinking tru3 is a killer main
---
Otz does the same thing literally narrates every single decision no matter how small while he plays the game.  I prefer his NotOtzdarva channel on YouTube it's more informative than his more meme based primary channel.  He plays out of his mind as a killer and has some really brilliant mindgames and tricks for advanced players to try out too.
---
Ugh that AngryPug video was disgusting to watch, I would have tunelled the shit out of him is I was the Billy in that vid. Now onto the other one.
---
Metal
---
Dude. Come on. Just because someone is new or not experienced in the game doesn’t mean they’re “morons”; they’re simply inexperienced. Try to be more encouraging.
---
You put it on a med-kit as an add on and it will heal you max healing states. If you’re playing on console while you start using the medkit hit L1 and it will instantly heal you. Same thing on PC, hit the quick/alt healing action you have binded.
---
Second Wind and Inner Strength have potential, both of them are big time savers, but they'll live and die by their activation conditions. Surge is a cracker, and Mindbreaker would be nice against the early Dead Hards that can sometimes extend a loop for a bit too long. I don't want to judge any perk too heavily until I've played with them though.
---
Had this happen to me as spirit yesterday :(
---
Wait, what!? different survivors are louder? whos the least and most noisy? I didnt know
---
I can understand when the totem spawns are shit and such, but you can’t run a perk that blocks a certain number of gens for 80 seconds or whatever, and then get upset when all the survivors do is do totems in that time.
---
You’re right but I don’t mean it in a bad way. I was a moron too until I got better. And I’m more saying my thoughts mid game, I’d assume I was in a game with players my rank at the time, though before reset I was rank 6
---
That's not a siren
---
Came here to say that. I avoid slug builds (I personally fucking hate being slugged, so I adamantly refuse to do it to other people—only time is in situations like the vid), but if survivors are stupid enough to keep swarming around the hook and being obvious about it, they have no excuse. 
---
If OP was slugging all around the map and shit, I’d understand the vitriol in the comments.
---
He forgot to read the "shitpost" part. Yikes.
---
Then the devs fix the visual issue or change the hitboxes to line up because this shit is ridiculous
---
It heals you 2 states so if someone’s dying on the floor you can use it and they’ll be on full health
---
It's not the meme he's complaining about, it's the comments bashing him. Like they are now. Again.
---
Everyone here is making fun of him because “he can’t take a joke” when he was saying he hates how a meme devolves into people making stuff up about him in the comments. They’re literally proving his point.
---
Spirit unless you are lower ranks, then plague. Higher rank survivors won’t cleanse on plague but if they do you can use the corrupt purge to down at least three survivors ( unless you waste it) before you need to reload.
---
I just saw, RIP wallet
---
They didn't remove the "only uninjured" condition to fixated. Damn, I don't think it would be overpowered without that and it could synergize better with Iron Will...
---
Yeah, but that only gives you 1mil for 3 characters. I don't see why they wouldn't do it on release of the chapter.
---
the camera steal has killed me too many times
---
Yeah its called swf, kinda bs but its part of the game so nothing we can do about it
---
360 them flashlights. Doesn't always work, but it breaks the flashlight stun time long enough for them to just waste battery. TBH pallets are the reason I've been playing Legion as of late. Survivor drops pallet, teabags and taunts, then I frenzy, leap the pallet and slash their ass.
---
You are fast.
---
Clicking that link gave me the Exposed™ status effect
---
Demogorgon is more threatening than Billy, I just can’t see Billy outright killing someone with a mori. Also the Demogorgon is more popular than Billy, he is an obvious choice.
---
Yes!! It's so annoying.
---
It doesn’t read like a joke at all, where’s the “joke” part?
---
Other than that yes, people over react hard, a very small fragment of the player base will actually keep this perk as a 4th of their build. Most the player base don’t step out of their comfort builds I.E. d strike, self care, adrenaline, sprint burst.
---
Anyone that thinks something could be stronger than nurse has no idea how to play the game.
---
One of the worst perks you can possibly see on your teamates loadouts.  It means you'll be getting Iri Lightbringer if you want to make it out because they'll be wasting a minute a pop running to the corner of the map to self care instead of doing gens.  It went from meta to meh overnight with the healing speed nerf update a while back.  I have seen countless gimme games thrown by self care gamers.  If anyone reading this runs that dogshit and wants to improve as a teamate instantly swap it out for Adrenaline.  That will change your priority to repairing instead of being a non-factor for nearly a minute at a time everytime you get an ouchie.
---
Isn't gen rushing and flashlight spamming considered cheap?
---
I've only had the game a few days and mostly play surv but on the very few occasions I play killler, I always get genrushed.
---
I had one game where there was a SWF with a rank 2 surv and 3 flashlights. They bodyblocked me and flashlight spammed me. 
---
It went pretty bad and when they saw I was a level 1 killer with no perks and rank 20 - They even said "Oh wow matchmaking, Sorry for being toxic with flashlights and rushing."
---
Lmao good job
---
No need to overreact with a twitter post though. Him doing this will also just attract trolls to do it even more just to get a reaction out of him.

The Demogorgan looks like bad hag and is pretty uninspired as a killer.

So true!!!!

Have to get those MoM stacks somehow!
---
I mean if Kate wouldn't have a bikini ~~but a nice cowgirl corset~~ would've been perfect
---
I been using a bit lately but then I really sat down and thought how many times did I as a killer care about hearing repair sounds and the answer was never. 
---
Obviously if I hear them, I know someone is or was there but if I hear gen, imma check regardless either to regress or check if survivors are around it.
---
I'm door #3! Just found the game through this very post being linked in another sub, and it looks great. :) Going to give it a go for the first time once it downloads on Steam.
---
I found Dbd through *this conversation about how you guys found Dbd.*
---
Now that's just meta.
---
Its sort of funny. When I encounter SWF with a red rank or two and some potatoes its usually so incredibly easy to pick out the weak links.  Anytime I run into someone who seems to know where every vault and pallet is and loops incredibly well I assume its a red ranker. Sure enough theres at least one other person in the match who is comparatively ass at looping or escaping.  Most of the time it looks exactly like this screen. Red ranks escape, potatoes are dead.
---
Poor newbies ): hopefully they'll learn haha
---
This is how people want the nurse to be nerfed.
---
I don’t think it’s actually canon, it’s just a cool crossover
---
Its hard to even play a full match with him.. I tried him a few times with shards and people DC'd the second they saw a bubba.
---
Rapid
---
oh no not that war flashbacks
---
Sadly bubba players tend to be extremely toxic fun-haters, only trumped by frosty-eyes wraiths
---
I would like Nemesis more, but any of them sound cool
---
The running counterpoint is what is genrushing? Say as a killer, you find someone fairly early on and chase, and by the time they go down, 3 gens pop. Oh no, that's Gen rushing. Now say each of those 3 survivors instead cleansed a totem. That adds probably only 14 seconds cuz it's not hard to accidentally find one. So that just means the gens pop right after the hook and not during the chase.
---
What on earth do you expect survivors to do except the one thing that helps them escape?
---
As for the bodyblocking and spamming and bullying, that is the only other productive, time wasting thing a survivor could do.
---
I have had considerable success as mid ranks as a non killer main by not committing to long chases. Get a hit, and find a Gen and chase them off. You literally just have to play differently. Manage your time better. It's not worth chasing that Meg around that infinite loop for another 30 seconds when you could be injuring someone else
---
I don't have a shit ton of shards
---
This is the 4th one of these I've seen on this sub
---
When Bill is the killer the survivors play as Tanks.
---
Ok now i want that yee haw Kate hat and her Pants, the bras ok but i can be without it
---
I know ;)
---
But Im pretty sure this perk will have many moments where it screws a Survivor over :D
---
And the effect that no Exhaustion goes down while on the under 50% Gen, means you either have to waste time doing nothing or work through it :D
---
100% agreed
---
I think its definitely in my top 3 of most fun games i've played. At 1400 hours i'm still improving and not bored.
---
&gt;  from both the survivors and the killers (balance, toxicity, bugs, general rage/venting, ect...)
---
There ARE balance issues for sure. There ARE toxic players for sure. Bugs isn't too bad tho.
---
Yeah, Barbecue had that visual bug for a while, so I assume it's the same.
---
It's really funny how triggered you got by me trolling you.
---
but for real, chill, I got you to act all defensive, passivaggresive, all by being obnoxius and your ego wanting to prove me wrong.
---
Now take this as a lesson about not being mad when people call you names on the internet and just brush it off as a a rando being stupid because you should assume people you speak to on the internet is eaither. 
---
A: trying to troll you. 
---
B: trying to force you to act a certain way. or
---
 C: just being stupid.
---
But thanks for acting like you did it really makes me smile :)
---
Im boutta cross the fuck out of this machete wielding asshole
---
Idk why but when i have party with three members it finds games fast🤔
---
I don't hate it, but I quite dislike the show and fanbase. My only problem with the DLC is that I was really hoping for an original killer and Carl the cashier, but maybe the next one...
---
I want to be without the bra as well :)
---
It does a decent job. I’m sure it can be improved, though it keep people in roughly the right rank
---
LMFAO
---
🙄 kindly see yourself out.
---
Sure was
---
I am still getting blood points and it also saves the items I escape with, its just annoying that I get kicked to the main menu everytime without being able to see what everyone else had/says after the game :(
---
I said this before but I thought it would be a very cool legion skin.

While I am happy for the people that enjoy this.

I can't help but shake off this feeling that Stranger things just feels like some hype that'll die out soon enough and leave us with this content people just go "meh" about.
---
Had a dream two nights ago where I was on a large, flat chunk of land. I forget the details of what was happening, something about fighting monsters and saving someone I knew, but I remember one detail the most. 
---
The Entity's claws were *humongous* and ominously looming overhead the entire time, almost watching and waiting to pick me up and take me away. Twitching every so often, but otherwise keeping a, not very comfortable, distance away. 
---
I remembered this detail late last night before going to bed and decided to remake what I saw in my dream. I still couldn't quite capture the same eerie essense in the photo, but I still like the simplicity of it and thought some of you fine internet folk could appreciate it.
---
A Nurse with 3 blinks ? Yeah, I’m not sure why the survivors DCd
---
Rip, Camping Bubba is worse tbh
---
It ends when one of u dc. That has happened twice to me
---
Yeah it's getting kinda stale just like your relationship before he cheated on you.
---
It depends on what console
---
Still -11, -2 and -1 man.
---
Why are you so salty about that? Didn't you notice it was a joke? That's the point of memes, right? That's why you "made" that image, right? Do parents ignore you all the time so you have to look at upvotes to feel appreciated? Man, get yourself together and find a purpose in your life other than upvotes.

“Great perks”? What dev stream were you watching?

Plague because she can step all over me (but spirit tbh a better killer)

Doctor is easy to play against, and he had a strong build. Just get better at the game is all i can say.
---
Well yes there is a lot of toxicity, it is actually more rare than youd think. It's a really fun game, and if you do play dont worry about your rank, getting a 4 player kill, or anything else really. You will have good and bad games, but just remember to have fun. And if you ever do get it, hmu and I'll attempt to teach you how to play killer
---
You have my respect. Here's some karma
---
I like playing him, but mostly because it's fun to be dumb.
---
You are just lying at this point
---
thats just sad. Billy doesnt even need to camp. In fact he may get a free chainsaw hit in if he leaves an opening and times a charge right.
---
Yeah, did it work just a little?
---
No.
---
See that's why technician is OP 👉😎👉
---
At least it sounds like the match was over quick.
---
I'm a Doctor who uses the 3-gen build and let me tell you, matches can last so long you'd be glad if I bring a Mori as a form of euthanasia.
---
I honestly would pay for that Kate skin. They should do a bikini outfit collection for like Kate, Feng, and Claudette.
---
ironically it probably makes you more of a normie to use that word
---
I've been playing a week and already witnessed my fair share. 😂 I don't think survivors realize how much they are screwing their team by DC. Even if the killer was on you the entire time, your team may have been able to accomplish a lot of objectives. You're always going to have some rounds where you're the first down, but there's no need to DC. There will be other, better trials. Also, a lot of people seem to be complaining about killers camping first hooks, but when I watch my team immediately go for a teammate who just got hooked...of course the killer will be in that area. The teammate has time. Please for the love of god, work on gens. 😭 Otherwise you end up with one person left with 4-5 genes. Interested to play as the killer later after I finish leveling up the survivors I like.
---
The only right thing here is the description. It's easy to change a string, it's not that easy to change whole code and make it work as supposed to. If it wasn't spaghetti code, they would've just changed the description, but they don't know how to make so that only killer hears survivors as louder, whilst they hear themselves normally. It shouldn't work like that, maybe we should just give both, survivors and killers ability to see each other's perks during the match?
---
The [sequel](https://i.redd.it/1osgg24o96d31.png)

Uhg...in the show they are sensitive to light. It still makes sense itll probably just make a burn noise like wraith.

Damm you must be used to some morbid shit, prayers.
---
&gt; Thankfully, most of the major balance issues (Ghostface, for example,) have largely been ironed out, so the game is... mostly well balanced
---
What do you mean by this? GhostFace is in a good spot balance wise. The biggest balance issues are Nurse and Spirit.

You have no idea. The vitriol that get said to women who play.

I have been playing this game on a 4k monitor and I found that when I am playing with windows scaled up so they fit the screen better sometimes my mouse inputs don't register. It seems like its when my mouse is at certain parts of the screen as when I move my mouse around a bit sometimes it will start to register clicks again. I do not get this bug at all as soon as I lower window scaling back down to 100%.
---
An issue literally days away from a potential solution. With dedicated servers people might realize their lag is a problem.
---
A lot of the time when I'm having nothing but bad games, I go straight to my friendly ghostface. I let people pallet stun me, blind me, etc. Makes me feel a lot better
---
Comparing Dark Souls, a action game that can be played offline and the invasions are not nearly an issue since there is a delay for how often you can get one AND a totally online ""survival"" asymmetrical game where knowledge is key and the individual is been spotted 24/7 due to communication and a team to rely on.. welp, it's kinda different than just saying "GitGud". It's like comparing a soccer game to CoD search and destroy.
---
SWF is a problem but most importantly deranking, since new players can't "GitGud" if someone who should be rank 1 derank to play with friends at yellow ranks and destroy the killer. He won't get better, just more prone to unistall or rely on more toxic things since he doesn't have the opportunity to get better. At first I had a really hard time for the same reason, while now I can play both sides at the same level and many others does the same, I just can't stand who derank for it.
---
The new wave of players should get a good experience, regardless of winning or losing, just put them in an environment that's suited for them, isn't a big deal is it? since this giant wave WILL help the game itself by supporting the devs that would have the money and the support to push them forwards with new reworks, maps, contents and fixes
---
where’s that
---
Uhm yeah?
---
They play maybe 10-20 games in low ranks before they are back at the decent ranks. Can't blame them, rather blame the obnoxious rank reset that for some reason has to happen every month.
---
They have 2 options either let them win and keep doing that because you will remain below decent ranks, or play to win and get to your deserved rank so you can actually play the game. (with people of your own skill level).
---
Also I highly doubt this is what makes people turn away from the game. When I started playing I've never been salty cus someone was better than me or had "OP" perks. I've played competitive games for years and they all have 1 thing in common: You will get absolutely slaughtered when you start as a knew player (LoL, CSGO, Rainbow6), that's part of learning.
---
What did make me salty and definetly drove me away from paying survivor for a while was all the low rank killers who facecamp as it is no-fun no-skill and is not even a good strategy (considering you will lose as a killer) but the killers who do that are often bad themselves otherwise they would just down me again once I get of the hook (and thus get more points+rank).
---
Oh! This happened to me on PS4! The Jane after i hit her just speed off :/  Funny to see it happen on the other side tho

Fave game. I don’t mind the bugs or glitches, I find a lot of them funny or endearing tbh. I don’t care about rank or “toxic” stuff etc. it’s just fun. I recommend trying it out for yourself. It’s on game pass on Xbox, but if you have PS4 idk if they do anything similar to try before you buy.
---
I'm not the one who's pointing out upvotes, so you'd better get a life, not me. You're so dumb, first you point out upvotes of the comments, then you insult me saying that i only care about upvotes. You're such an idiot
---
You’re comment is exactly what I would expect the community to say. They assume new perks are either:
---
A: overpowered as shit 
---
B: weak as shit
---
C: Immediately considered meta
---
But the survivor perk meta barely changes each time.
---
Well... that's not what I thought you were talking about. :|
---
yeah apparently a simple screenshot can surpass all the good memes and even the stranger things announcement thread. #1 upvoted of all time now so that’s pretty cool I guess.
---
It was obvious sarcasm and adding an /s would just lessen the joke
---
Much like you, I live by spine chill and suck in chases but I've started scouting the map before I jump on gens to sort of know where abouts I should be heading if a killer finds me. I try to get at least two extra routes before I start a gen so that if a killer comes from one, I have my backup. I hope this helps a little bit :)
---
“Get good” is not a tip. Try giving some constructive feedback.
---
People are SLEEPING on Head On + DS.
---
well all their friends are in other games now so this dude clearly doesnt want to dc xD and i am watching Netflix now

I should try that some time, a lot of times I seem to hit a wall around 7-8 ranks as a killer and I get destroyed a lot, and I end up taking a long break from DBD lol

Yes.

I'd hate to be that killer but it's awesome

👁👄👁
---
SWF?
---
but isn't surge by far better for gen prot? like surge+surveillance and you can 3 gen for days
---
Sometimes it's good to just unwind and play how you wanna play. Jumpscare Myers is my go to for that. the moments where you get the drop on someone and they spasm out of control then sprint into the corner by accident are just so satisfying
---
huh, i have never seen that kate skin before, kinky
---
I think thats what they were saying.
---
There is nothing else like it. Thousands of hours in this game and I've been both over the moon with it and vehemently wanted it to burn in hell. It's a great game that sucks you in and keeps you, for better or worse.
---
Not today
---
I got a few questions,  which perks do you use? I need to know so I can say which ones will and won't approve the chase and how long you can keep the killer busy. Do you just refuse to drop a pallet even if the killer is in lunging  distance? Do you looped walls big enough for killers to mindgame you often?
---
I like playing killer more but as a survivor I play Adam
---
Ehh insults about them guessing how I look, how I don’t know how to play the game, women shouldn’t play video games, misogynistic comments how I should be bare foot and pregnant while cooking,  threats about raping me, one guy even said he’d find me, come and strangle to me death and kill my pet. Eh just normal days on video games for me.
---
Unhook people and take a protection hit for them if killer chases. If you do that twice in a match plus do a gen you will pip no need to survive. Instead of looking for a chase try spine chill Lightweight and Dead Hard. Use dead hard to make it to the pallet if killer is closing in and you can run over traps with it unscathed.
---
Anyway about not being chased. Jump thru a window then scurry off before killer gets there and let lightweight cover your tracks. Then after the killer has come and gone do it again in similar place or in a completely different area. You can distract the killer a bit without getting into a chase. Slowly climb into a locker, then rush out and run away, it will seem to the killer that someone just jumped into a locker so they will waste time looking in it.
---
If you need points in the chase category you can do totems.
---
"Diva" would be a more fitting title.
---
Gee, I wonder why.
---
No he’s not
---
nice to see none ruined it before you got to see that, most games at least 1 player would dc.
---
Honestly losing chases can really annoy me, but just having even a rough idea of what you can do if a killer chases you is always useful :)
---
With how little information they gave besides "fuck doctor i dont want to play against him" and no gameplay clip there is nothing i can give constructive feedback. Literally the closest thing to that that i can say get better at skill checks.
---
Obviously
---
The one where they showed all the great perks coming in chapter 13.
---
Those kinda people just wanted to talk trash. You could do all 5 gens, open both exit gates, save everyone from hook twice, in that order and that guy would still have somethin shitty to say. Really whatever you did doesnt matter to 'em when they decide to open their mouths.
---
But when you see them, chasing them is the only reliable option, even if they SB away. Let's be honest - **most** of them will SB away. And abondoning most of the chases is never the smartest idea. When you see someone at the beggining of the match - you have to chase them, unless you see/hear someone else. You just need that map pressure, you can't afford to just let them go, even with ruin.
---
And you don't need any exhaustion perk to run away from the killer when you're near the gen. Just look at all the DH users. And if you happen to play against gen rushing survivors - you won't make any use that perk at all.
---
It may not be useless at all, in some cases it can be used to get very, very, very little advantage, but you can say that about every useless perk. Hangman's Trick, Monstrous Shrine, etc. There will be too few situations in which you could use that perk, it's not worth running. 
---
It needs buff. Remove the "only up to 50% gen progression" condition and increase the time to 10 seconds or more. Then this perk will be much more useful in way more situations, even though it will still be mediocre.
---
That's oinking good!
---

---
Yeah, it's not ideal, but I guess you'll just have to spend some on other characters. At least, even if you have a break before the DLC, you'll definitely have enough points to level up the new characters. Not everyone plays enough to easily get 1m quickly.

This is three days late, but you're still an idiot. Here's how the video game industry works: A company has many different employees that need to be paid, these different employees are divided into different areas of work, bug fixing, testing, new content creation, etc. The company cannot reasonably constantly push out new content that impacts gameplay, both for balance and time constraint reasons, so they need to come up with simpler means of generating things that people will pay for, to continue paying the developers of the game. So they keep making the game. So the game doesn't die. It's a cycle, you see? So, no, they don't, "spend so much money on making new cosmetics." That's just how people get paid. That's what funds additional support for the game. But yeah, "just have more people" is entirely unrealistic. I'd suggest taking some business classes while you're supposedly studying game design.

Tasty
---
Is that true? The largest group of dead by daylight players play it on PS4?  If it’s true, it makes me mad.  They need to optimize this game on PS4 if that’s where the majority of people are playing it.
---
I think before they said no because he is a real killer with real victims who have families still alive today who wouldn't want him in a game.
---
I hate it, as I have 1k hours and continue playing
---
Sure we have a toxic community, but hell, so does every other online game.  I'd say pick it up and put messages to friends only, that's what I did to avoid annoying messages from toxic players.
---
monitor and abuse for sure makes it better, but I dont actually have it on him yet myself, ive been profoundly unlucky. It helps, but he works pretty well still without it.
---
PS4, not getting the prompt to wiggle when picked up by a killer, also ran through the exit gate and was able to control my character still/didn’t count as a win
---
That's up to us to fix. Would you rather play with a "gg, good fun" sportsman, or a whiny snot nosed teenager in his moms basement who uses this game as their only outlet to feel like life is actually in their control?
---
Dark Sense so you know which way to run from
---
Heh, I did this once as ghost face because there were a bunch of default Dwights teabagging around me (Ghostface) so I exposed ALL of them. They all tried to run away before I slugged all of them and they all crawled into the basement, where I simultaneously hooked all 4 of them and watched them all die.
---
It is a joke though. I see it as a joke and alot of other people criticize him because he does have flaws. Some people take it too far and hate on him for petty shit and thats not cool. I personally cant stand his ego, dont hate him, actually watch him quite abit.
---
He had trash ping on top of everything.
---
Fuck off with this bs. I dc’d cause I dont want to play games that make me angry. I’d rather have fun
---
This new Clown skin is sweet.
---
It """"counters""""" it
---
Im surprised to see someone else play bitter murmur
---
I've been playing since 2016, and yeah. I can play one or two.. but I feel like I need to decompress after a few. The game makes me anxious these days or something.
---
No man can simply escape from clowns hunger for fingis
---
Honestly Plague.
---
Gotta wait til PTB
---
When i want to unwind i play friendly pig who helps with gens. I also tried acting friendly as huntress and then betraying them with the good old iri heads and got some DCs needless to say
---
Surprisingly I watched a video about lightweights usefulness and was shocked at how little difference it makes in the time it takes for scratch marks to dissappear, I hide alright, I just want to be good at a chase so I don't burden my friends when I happen to get into one or when I have to take the killers attention for/before/after a rescue but that locker juke is clever, I could never come up with it so thank you :) my ping is dodgy sometimes so I prefer lithe/sprint burst/urban evasion to dead hard, but the I've never gotten a chance to run it in an online game because I got way too greedy with the grind so now I have all survivors leveled but I only run the most vanilla perks online as I wanna prestige Meg after I can get all the perks on her :D
---
Im assuming itll be abot 7-15 dollars
---
Can’t tell if you’re trolling but you are a 3 blink nurse. Bhvr will get rid of additional blinks soon :)
---
More so that its a waste of an addon where something better can be instead like freddys z block for example. They couldve made it where survivors fall asleep 15 seconds faster or something like that but instead im bleeding
---
What is SWF?
---
If you see the pig start to crouch at a loop you can just run away
---
That's exactly how I feel! Love the game but hate playing it
---
Depends how the games go. Getting camped/tunneled as survivor, or gen rushed as killer obviously sours the experience. But sometimes I can play for hours and enjoy myself. Even if I die as survivor the games can still be fun, and when you get survivors that make you tryhard on killer it's fun.
---
How many gens can you do with that?
---
I always wonder why survivors always try to crawl into a corner somewhere like a lost puppy, I see now they're just trying to cheese the game as usual.
---
What does /s mean
---
I guess, but I dont see a problem insta p3 people.. I always get someone to 50 and use all good offerings and items they have and then prestige them..
---
I think I heard somewhere it'll be 11.99 but i'm not sure
---
I'd go with this. If you use all the charges of this i think its already a red emblem and ur better off doing other things anyways
---
u/uwutranslator

People making these comments are the ones who are actually streamsniping and their defense goes just like that "dont broadcast your gameplay if you dont want people to snipe" or "add a delay to your stream.
---
Using a 3rd party program (google chrome) to gain an unfair advantage over another player is pretty much the definition of cheating, however you justify it to yourself.
---
Source: have streamed a few times on Twitch over the last 8 years
---
I for one welcome new players
---
Demogorgon if you are not planning on buying Steve and Nancy, if you are going to buy the chapter, buy Ghostface (He came without a survivor, so you aren't losing anything and he he is really fun to play) since BBQ &amp; Chili is in the Shrine you don't have to buy Bubba.
---
Survive With Friends.
---
It's a mode where you can literally play with your friends!
---
It's pretty fun, despite killers hate it.
---
Well Sprint Burst is probably the worst exhaustion perk for chases so I'd recommend replacing it balanced landing or dead hard as balanced completely denies the drop stun animation allowing you to run instantly plus you get a mini Sprint Burst kinda and dead hard can make a killer miss and extend loops,dodge traps, hatchets etc.    self care is just bad,takes too long for healing just bring med kits or bond to find teammates, urban evasion is actually good won't judge it too harshly as it could allow you to sneak away if the killer loses you.   For pallets and you dropping them early try holding off on dropping them unless the killer is really close, I'm not good at T or L walls so can't give alot of tips on them but if a killer tries a mindgame just ditch it if you get caught by them easily as ditching a pallet is unexpected which will throw them off(it doesn't work all the time but a 50/50). That's all I got.
---
I love watching Otz. I love his reactions, how friendly he is to viewers and above all the galaxy brain gameplay analysis.
---
This is god tier huntress gameplay.
---
I get out of chases all the time with Lightweight. Try comparing it with yourself instead of a video so you know for sure. I run Dead Hard, Lightweight, Self Care, and Botany or Spine Chill. I know it helps me keep killers at bay and in check. Most killers will take the bait for about 2 minutes but that 2 minutes will give time for gens. 
---
If on console rotate your left joy stick while running and at the same time hold the right joystick to the right position. That is the 360 juke.
---
I do that, what's wrong with it? Get rid of my junk
---
SWF is Survive With Friends.
---
Nurse still has eyes
---
It's not the real life one, read the post.
---
I'm just saying, take it with a grain of salt until the ptb.
---
Grab yourself a $20 Steam card and call it a day
---
I'm just letting you know, don't believe everything you read next time. A fictional, inspired Jack would be perfect. Like Leatherface and Ed Gein. I like your Jekyll and Hyde suggestion tho.
---
Dude I think that was me playing Freddy 😂
---
Ofc when I cant play 🙄
---
im guessing 10 bucks since the usual is 8
---
We have an average wait of about 2 minutes of wait until matched with 2 more survivors.
---
Mildly frustrating, so often Rocket League get turned on - immediate matches made!
---
I mean every new killer gets 4 perked survivors. I know because the game likes to toss level 20 killers at me with 1 perk.
---
Alright than
---
On a side note, I believe we get wholesome thread day on Sundays. Keep an eye on pinned threads on the weekend. :D
---
WHEN SURVIVORS DIE DIE DIE
---
BIG BRAIN
---
It was from BHVR response a couple years ago but you don't need to believe it.
---
My friend tried to convince me that premonition was better than spine chill. He now exclusively runs spine chill haha. Using map landmarks is always a good idea, try and get the gens in a bad location done first so it's a bit easier late game
---
Are you still in the game or did they DC
---
I did the pig one before when we had 5 BPS, I helped with the gens and in the end one survivor let me hook him, unhook himself and popped his trap at the exit gate. It was the coolest 140,000 bloodpoints I ever got.. but damn that last one sounds totally evil lol
---
Ey I know that dude
---
likely $10 since the usual is $8 and 1 character is $5, hence $5 + $3 + $1 = $9 but with not as much savings likely round out to $10
---
DLC with only one character (with exception of Bill) are around $4.99, DLC with to characters (with exception of A lullaby from the dark and The Last breath) are around $6.99 so therefore a character is around $2. So it could be $6.99-$8.99 depending on if the add an extra $2 for an extra survivor. The Scoops I assume will cost from a little over $5 to a little over $10.
---
Not to mention iron will is actually a decent perk for general use too. Easy jukes.
---
Well, I apologise that you see things that way, but people are allowed to have opinions. Yes, reddit turns into a circle jerk, but have you also see his stream chat and the replies to that one tweet? It goes both ways.
---
And I have a personal gripe with him because he ended up calling stream sniper on me once before, and I had people harass me for a few days over that. So I'm sorry if I "vomit out" my "bad take", but there is some truth to that "Bullshit" that is said.
---
I never streamsnipe. I've also streamed. I have standards of decency and fair play. Don't be accusing people of doing it just because I point out how easy it is to bypass the whole issue of doing it.
---
I know this but I was in coldwind and lockers were not viable. He tunneled and slugged from the beginning, hooked 1 person after he downed someone else. So he could pop bbq and chili and keep seeing everyone.
---
Plus ping was ass, I kept rubberbanding the whole time.
---
Could be a good luck charm?
---
I'm on PC unfortunately, can't execute a 360 to literally save my life, I'm not a new to the community or jukes at all, I'm just too bad at running to do it. Also damn 2 minutes, I will sure try it, that's more than a gen worth of time, I play a shitton of kyf so I'll try it for sure to see if I can troll my friends a bit , thanks
---
The new Invader Zim movie on Netflix: Enter the Florpus
---
So what? Your objective is to do gens. You're not directly contributing to the objective by acting as bait. You cant escape if everyone is acting as bait but you can escape if everyone is doing gens. By having more than 1 person looping the killer you're just wasting time and increasing the risk of dying, which is why 1 loops and 3 do gens. Thats how this game works.
---
Yeah and waste my time waiting to get into a lobby the whole day. I constantly get brazilian players for some fucking reason and it takes a whole 10-15 minutes to find a lobby.
---
I know, I just need to vent.
---
I got that recently as plague.  It was so satisfying.
---
I like access to both. This is more entertaining but raw footage is fun too
---
Well you see my friend, ping is a bitch. That's all. Thanks bhvr.
---
Bro this looks really cool and matched the stranger things pic nicely
---
As long as the killer is my girl susie XD
---
Yes, as always.
---
I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having an actual historical person who killed actual none fictional people. But yeah I could probably see it if they did their own original character who just has inspiration around them. Like the Doctor for example or LF in yours. I'm honestly down for anything as long as its done tastefully.
---
I mean that doesn't excuse survivors spawning literally in line of aight of active totems. Like... if you start walking to your totem immediately upon the trial starting, it should never be destroyed before you can attempt to defend it. 
---
Literally no one thinks totem spawns are fine. They're better, but they still have a ways to go.
---
I'm aware. They were referring to the real life killers. As I've said multiple times, this is NOT the same person or a real life killer. But one inspired by him, again, just like Leatherface and Ed Gein.
---
There is nothing more infuriating when you finally get that damn toxic pallet teabagging survivor, only for them to DS you.
---
Nah I just want that Kate skin
---
Cosplayers sell a lot and buy a lot of non licensed materials.
---
To be honest, I hadn't even thought about Stranger Things, but that sounds like potential for something sexy. 
---
Once someone ports the newest gear on the workshop, I have some thoughts for something neat. Mmm, good inspiration, friend.
---
Yep, agreed. My idea is an original killer that is completely inspired.
---
Oh yeah, I will always try to do the central gens sneakily at the start of the game so we don't get 3 genned as that's such a pain.
---
The PLAG wore it better.
---
I think they should just remove the exhaustion effect, whenever I try to dead hard a second time it won’t let me!
---
Jesus fuck thats amazing
---
This might work on low rank killers but not past Rank 15. Killers can see gens partially repaired from a great distance, especially with BBQ and will know right away if you have Q&amp;Q after the first chase. Poised is obvious too and with only 5 maximum uses a match it's not worth the slot
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
"great perks"
---
lol 2 hour babies will literally think anything is amazing
---
Personally, i dont think those changes are enough. I think the range of Suge and Cruel are just too small, though otherwise fine. That Exhasution perk would be super op if it worked like it saids
---
There's this thing called splitting up your development team correctly. They have too many people in the cosmetics department and too little people fixing the game. And $10 for one outfit is fucking ridiculous, yeah some games are worse but there are a lot of other games that don't charge that much for a shit cosmetic. They aren't even that good half the time.
---
Dead hard is still bugged for me. I used to think I would just press it to late, but sometimes I press it pretty early and I still get hit. I know it's a big because everytime it happens I just get stuck on the floor gittering without being able to crawl for a few seconds. It doesnt happen that often because lithe timing is pretty precise, but it gets really annoying. You have to use dead hard after they swing, but before they hit you.
---
Late note:
---
I use 'sexy' as an adjective for something super cool or awesome. 
---
But I guess I can pull together something with Demogorgon x Entity .-.
---
Or PSN or XBOX Live Card.
---
Awh, I didn’t know that :) Thank you for letting me know!
---
I mean, changing the killer's objective to be "kissing" and "giving flowers" to survivors would be the same to hooking them. You need to give three flowers each survivor and you win, just like hooking a survivor three times.
---
You know the higher the rank, generally the better teammates you will have.
---
Awh, you’re so nice. :) That’s nice of you to do these things!
---
Can I get the link as well?
---
That’s very, very nice of that survivor! It sounds like you might have made a friend as well?
---
purple rank still not getting unhooked
---
It’s actually suprisingly good
---
I agree with the other guy spine chill is probably the best awareness perk for survivor and I will pretty much always run it.
---
You say that like either of them are actually worth using or are viable alternatives (also blatantly ignoring NM’s main purpose); any killer with two brain cells to rub together (and aren’t just memeing around or goofing off with the NM survivor) will know to never slug the NM user. Unbreakable is so specifically situational at best, and is only one use—there are far better perks to use for survivability. 
---
Now, all that being said: I love using NM just for the challenge of it all—it’s quite amazing how focused one can get when running it.
---
Oh you’re right, that is an even better strategy!
---
Add the teabag at the end and it’s perfect.
---
How?
---
You should put Hope in there
---
That’s very nice of people to keep an eye out for each other as survivors. :)
---
So play Nurse then
---
That sounds like it was fun! :D I’m glad she let you go too. :)
---
Utterly useless
---
I see you were playing hag at the time. I'm a hag main so I appreciate this.
---
Last night a David who was dead on hook came to unhook me when the exit gates were open and the killer was camping. He didn’t make it out. I salute that man
---
wooo, this means i'll have to play the shit out of Spirit and Ghostface because i have like 30 cakes on them
---
So the continuation of this chat, went on as "Targeting the rest of my family" and also some really...interesting words that I never thought could be in a sentence.
---
all ive seen you post is dwight is a pedo.  Why? Dwight's existence is wholesome.  You sound like a survivor who got bullied by some random Dwight
---
Why would anyone run a perk that makes you leave a huge trail behind you lmao /s
---
I’m glad you kept the helpful circle open! I didn’t even know you can crouch hag traps. Could I ask why not cleanse?
---
Shrine RNG is random. Sorry
---
What a brave soldier!
---
That's what they wan't you to think!
---
oh, okay, phew! glad to hear Dad himself wasn't being a jerk. yeah, stream chatters are notoriously goofy. sorry they were being butts.
---
Nope. When the dlc drops you're gonna get a lot less games as killer
---
You getting picked up within the time?
---
Speed and duration add ons, dont know their names but those ones.
---
from my experience they can, its just kind of difficult.
---
Awesome movie
---
You Mori'd everyone without a Mori? How!?
---
Even harder to swallow pills: You can't complain about getting tunneled off the hook if you're trying to run DS anyways.
---
That's how this works, right?
---
I bleed everyone out.
---
Yup, and I'll try to miss on purpose too but it just spins all the way around
---
Found the toxic survivor that reminds us of the whole circus lol
---
Thank you Entity, very cool!
---
Its a strategy beyond our comprehension.
---
No. The Devs can't even fix bugs over 2 years old, let alone code competent AI. Everything in the tutorial is scripted - No AI
---
It will, because I’m pretty sure it always did from the start (albeit text was weird). As I said: It’s a super effective for something small. It’s going to look op, but some people don’t even run exhaustion. And what happens, when no one is repairing or the progress went over 50%?
---
Not cross platform, it means that rather than the killer being the host there is a centralized server that does all that processing. It means less lag, more reliability, better matchmaking, etc
---
Y'all are overly optimistic on the impact of the new perks. People have been running Self-care long after its become trash, and swear never to touch a dull totem for as long as they live. That cuts out Inner Strength. 
---
And healing others for a free heal? Forget it. Most off these jokers are assuming we're all as dumb as they are and run Self-care too. They'd never activate Second Wind.
---
And those are the perks that can make you somewhat tankier. The rest of the survivor perks, forget it. They don't make survivors harder to kill, so they don't dislodge Exhaustion perks, DS, BT from the top spots.
---
The people who were already running different things now have some more perks to try out, but the sweaty tryhards out there aren't changing their builds for this stuff unless it turns out to be grossly overtuned.
---
Same. I usually always go for sacrificing myself if it means my teammates get out. I've got Borrowed Time for them, I'll body block the killer if he tries tunneling you, you need a distraction? I'll be a bit toxic and get the killers attention, might get me tunneled and killed but are you safe? 
---
I might be a P3 Claud with a flashlight, but I'm your teammate not your enemy. I apologize if I can't save you. 
---
I'mma get Mettle of Man to replace my Adrenaline so I can take those protection hits and get some benefit.
---
just another killer main that gets himself off by making fun of survivors. quality post dude, you should go back to face camping then acting like youre a super pro killer before you wear yourself out
---
Today at post game chat I noticied the killer had a cute dog pic. I said cute dog and my friends followed up, and then it led to us and the killer talking about his dog. His dog's name is Patches, he is such a cute dog
---
Less lag? Lol, i was take hits mile away when dedicated was in test. And u can't check killers ping. So killer can abuse it to lay ez hits. Dedicated server is a crap. For now.
---
I already know I'm gonna be that asshole with Inner Strength/DS/Head On/Quick &amp; Quiet.
---
The meme build literally writes itself
---
Oh I know it is, it's just what I got atm and I need the help, I personally like lithe better than balanced because it has more spots in the map where it can be used, some maps have only 2 spots for balanced and that's scary to me, potato tendencies and all, another good pallet juke it to pretend you're gonna run through a pallet and then just kinda run to the side of it, similar to pretending you're gonna vault, it works about 90% of the time, provided the killer doesn't respect pallets.
---
The Spirit walks on the etheral plane
---
Nurse and Wraith use the Spirit world
---
The Guy is right
---
Scammer get scammed
---
I'm down with getting a kiss from the killer on the way out
---
please tell me how a perk that heals you while your inside a locker is not countered by a perk that makes you one shot when you get out of a locker
---
i can feel the adrenaline flooding you when the hatch door open.  Lucky escape!
---
Idk about 100% of my brain but I always use 99% of an item
---
I’m not saying that, I’m saying that killers facecamping is the equivalent to flash lighting a killer everytime they pick someone up, and that they’re both aspects of the game that people can stfu about and quit complaining... idk if you saw my previous comment on the thread or not but this is an ongoing dialogue
---
is flower = girl ???
---
That hatchet 100% got you reported
---
Average survivor main really.
---
Ok thank you I had no clue what they meant when they said that.
---
unfortunately there's not much we can do. a few people telling an entire community of toxic players isn't gonna stop it at all. especially not in games with a competitive side like dbd. people will always want to win so ther will always be salt, anger and toxicity. that just comes with games that have a competitive element. as long as new players stay casual and don't try to rank up too high they should be fine
---
Got a downvote, guess not. Double standards are a trouble, eh?
---
Man dude.... I'm sorry.  I SWF all the time and we take losses in stride. More often than not I see killers being this toxic... (let's face it SWF teams suck... but im also not that good of a killer...) but this is just too far. 
---
They most certainly deserve the loss.
---
**L U N G E**
---
I would love for DBD to get a report system similar to Overwatch
---
I'm guessing they're some child who recently played one of the Welcome to the Game games and now think they're a badass deep web expert.
---
I think her power is a little bland and boring. It’s basically bloodlust forever and nothing else. Most of the time survivors don’t look at the killer for more than 2 seconds. Just a little glance when running to ensure their dead hard is used properly. Maybe add in a new function or an active ability instead of 2 passive abilities. Just my thought in this
---
I just switch platforms and that works for me. 
---
The current Ranking system needs to be scrapped and completely redone. The quest to be a red rank can bring out the absolute worst in players on both sides. I know that there are players that don’t care about that and I respect that, but they are the exception to the Multiplayer rule. I’m not singling anyone out here either. 
---
I think they are on the right track with the player level, and should build from that. I play a variety of MP games and you do need some type of grind to keep interest. The experience alone will get boring if there are no rewards. And taking those rewards away each month and placing players back to square one (almost) is not the way to do it. 
---
It’s hard to find another experience to compare this to. It’s not like any other game. But there are ways to make changes and this is an area where the community should have the final say. We play it just as much as BHVR does ...
---
Only time I think it’s justified to do it is when you see a survivor sandbag or legit screw over another survivor, at that point idc if everyone else gets away I’m gonna make sure you suffer.
---
Have you seen a Pulcinella clown yet? I run that costume, but I hardly see any clowns when I play survivor, let alone Puppet clown. I bet people really double take.
---
They said with the possible nurse rework in September, or at least I heard on a stream
---
This happened to me on cold wind on a L shape wall. Didn’t know what to do so I just left them there until someone came along and picked them up.
---
Gifted Bamboo Comb/White Hair Ribbon (charge time) and Origami Crane/Rin's Broken Watch (power recovery) are my go to lows. Go into phase faster and power recovers quicker to keep on phasing. I only use duration and speed add ons when they're green or higher as I don't see much of a difference with yellow and brown
---
On PC anytime I do a 2 man SWF we get into games almost as fast as solo queuing. I dont think I've waited more than a minute to find a lobby
---
Ran a game as Spirit. Two people DC’d not even 2-3 minutes into the match. I killed a David and only a Jake was left. I signaled him to take the door and leave because it felt absolutely unfair for a random to suffer because others couldn’t deal with the Killer. He made it out just in time and we’re now friends on Steam. :)
---
Such a chad
---
He does ALL sort of wonderful things with those hands
---
At least he did t have ruin... hahaha
---
I know. I swear I was about to just quit the game entirely.
---
Thanks, Lord Hircine.
---
If I spend bp in PTB does it get rid of them both
---
I’m saying though in that situation the best tactic is to facecamp so you at least get someone though! I play an extremely mobile character and my main tactic is to hook someone, check out the nearest generator, then travel back when they unhook and track my hooked person, rinse and repeat... I’m trying to bring to light the double standard that people in this community have about most things killers do being cheap, while everything survivors do is “part of the game so it’s fair”. In that situation facecamping is understandable, I’m not saying that i do this or that it’s actually happened to me, I’m trying to explain that every tactic a killer has in their arsenal has a use in a specific scenario
---
Hmmmm thats around the time the demogorgan is gonna be released
---
Grow 5 more lungs
---
In that situation you either face camp, or get no sacrifices, so facecamping becomes the best tactic you have in that specific situation... idk if I made it unclear that it was hypothetical but let’s change the scenario. The gates open, you have someone on the hook, and everyone else is obviously gonna escape unless they’re coming to save the hooked guy... in that scenario face camping is a smart tactic, and although it’s cheap it’s the smartest move for a killer to make... even still the survivors will act like you’re a total piece of shit for it, when it’s the smartest move you can make in the situation. I don’t facecamp unless it’s extremely situational, and even then I’m more likely to patrol the general radius for players, but it is a tactic that in certain situations is smart, and the best chance at a sacrifice in that match... My main point being that no matter the situation the survivors react the same way
---
ive had so much trouble getting bloodpoints, but since i got bbq and chili in the shrine i get ~60k per game so this is just icing on top of the (escape) cake!
---
Lmao y’all want Shirtless Myers or Shirtless Kate. Nah fam i want Shirtless Freddy
---
This is the chocolate cake of Killer. All 4 on basement hook, Ruin still up, and no gens done. Toss 4 stacks of BBQ and it's a masterpiece movie.
---
Too bad the Entity doesn't like it very much.
---
Rare? Sounds like you're just bad.
---
A soul for a soul
---
Ik but i see this question posted a billion times on different media platforms thats all. Its not a bad question just repetitive one.
---
Well I got 9k shards rn.. I usually spend shards on killer perks that I dont have yet (that are good).. Plus still have like 1 Lauries perk and Quentins perk that I dont have on survivors side
---
Fandom good in r/fivenightsatfreddys
---
Does this mean our flashlights are like hyper charged halogen truck lights? How much heat comes off of a normal flashlight?

r/wholesomebydaylight?

when i’m survivor i feel like such a nice guy doing it and when i player killer it pisses me off so much
---
No. Tunneling just makes logical sense. The un-hooked survivor will go down in one hit. I don't try to go for them but if that's the first person I see and they're not near loops/pallets then yeah, I'm going for you. Especially if you act like a twat. 
---
Survivor Mains have no sense of logic. They live in some alternate bizarro world reality.
---
I know right! 
---
Good thing tough lads like us are emotionless shells of human beings with no concept of empathy.
---
They prolly think you are being toxic, since that’s the whole community.
---
Survive With Friends
---
Honestly the rank system is just a time lock to begin with. The only thing that makes it somewhat accurately record skill is how fast you can rnak up,
---
Now this is very wholesome.
---
He is using a Common add-on. Veterans know better to use browns with anything unless there's nothing else to use.
---
Show me on the doll where that bad killer touched you.
---
Preety good job so far
---
Nah Myers is where it’s at
---
I call it an It tbh

That scene was wack all around

I love to see a fellow Adam user - very rare

The problem I had with it is that it establishes he can do anything he wants in the dream world. He isn’t bound by physics.
---
Then he spends the rest of the movie chasing people on foot through the dream world.

Trying to be funny when you're not even close to correct.  Sounds like you're jelly you're not uncircumcised.

**Tombstone Time**
---
No it's just my game broke, so I can't play at all lol
---
You will always be remembered, Dweet. (Plays taps)
---
Nope, I haven't even bought bbq in the shrine of secrets left cause I lack shards. I don't even know how long I've been waiting for it yet my playtime is too low to afford it.
---
Kobe, lol /s
---
Yes but if they had a target to go after then they would be preoccupied instead of having the option to tunnel by being close by
---
I mainly posted this for experienced player who purposely deranked, if the killer is new then try not to bully the killer too much
---
the grotesque oozing monstrosity lost by a landslide. obviously plague wore it better
---
I've been at 1 mil for months now, I guess I'll finally p3 Ash 😂
---
In my opinion they are thinking very short sighted.
---
If gens times are balanced around a completely broken killer like the nurse, that you simply can't loop around, that's not very fun. Would be more fun if killers's strenght was more like Doctor, LF, Plague, Trapper, etc, but gens were slower. Then survivors can enjoy looping around the killer but the killer still has a fighting chance even if he's not ending all chases in 20 seconds.
---
I don't mind Tru3, but he has a certain side to him I can't stand.
---
I find it painfully obvious that he's a killer main and not always the good kind. ZubatLel is the kind of Killer main I adore. He's godlike yet actually knows that Spirit and Nurse are stupid which is something that Tru3 doesn't really show that much
---
so...the entire post is designed to mock people? that's the problem in it right there. what is the point of the post? what does it contribute? it contributes nothing. it's only purpose is to spread toxicity, rile people up and bother them. that is my problem with it. 
---
and even if i am those things(im not but let's pretend i am) what is wrong with it? you see dozens of posts every single day on this sub of people saying(especially to killers) "play how you want" "just ignore the stupud RULEBOOOOK XDD" but if a survivor does anything remotely toxic it will treated as if it's the single worst thing that ever happened to anyone ever. it's ok to tunnel and facecamp, it's ok to drop a survivor at a closed exit gate, let them 99% it then down them and spend the entire egc tbagging them as ghostface until they die. but if a survivor tbags a single time they deserve to be downed, facecamped until death, then have a nuclear warhead launched at their house
---
my problem with this post is not just this one post. it's with the attitude of the sub in general towards survivors. i saw someone say before this entire sub is a killer circlejerk, and theyre honestly right. dont like the way something works in the game? want to try and have a legitimate conversation about it, why you think it shouldn't be in the game, etc? too bad buddy. you're nothing but a crybaby survivor main and you deserve to be mocked because this game FAVORS YOU HAHAHA stupid crybaby survivor mains
---
tl;dr fuck you, and fuck you thinking it's okay to bully someone in any way shape or form
---
/rant
---
nah just ace. dwight probably got his speedos nicked by his coworkers

On Xbox/PS4, don't read messages. On Switch, there's 0 communication. PC has a &gt;&gt; next to the chat window, press it.

I just think there neat

Oy
---
What you got to say about us blue haired fengs
---
This is really stupid. Makes no sense. 1m will not make 1 of the characters through level 50.
---
Same, that’s why I said I had to deal with toxic killers, ghostfaces would always expose me and face camp
---
While I agree, it should also be noted that there are plenty of times where I will walk away as a killer, the person will get unhooked and I will come back to engage in chase with the person who unhooked and instead I will see the person who got hooked still hanging around.
---
Killing off a person fast is very give and take. Granted there is less people to be doing gens but also there is less things to distract people from gens, because there is no save to made on the third hook. Going after healthy survivors to spread the pressure is more beneficial but it would be dumb to see a hurt person and not go after them if they are the only one you see.
---
I love Steve and his scoops outfit don’t get me wrong, but I’d trade it for either of the other two in a heartbeat
---
Surge looks like it's going to be a great perk on most maps, especially The Game if it affects gens on both floors.
---
NOED will surely be a thing of the past with Inner Strength giving even more incentive to cleanse dull totems.
---
Looking forward to this chapter shaking things up!
---
#####IS THAT A DEAD BY DAYLIGHT REFERENCE
---
If they run to the other side of the map because of bbq and chili to pressure someone on a gen then its pretty tough to tunnel someone off the hook
---
My friend he wasn't even running the most annoying doctor build. That's called a basic bitch killer build.
---
I liked all besides babysitter and one other but I forgot
---
How am I bad if I'm not able to bring every survivor to the basement every single game all at the same time
---
The flashlight is an effect that the entity allows. The physics fall into the the realm of "this effect is a representation of what blinding would do from your universe"
---
I hope more killers will stop running that perk once the new chapter comes out. It will save a lot of stress from survivors who say “No Ed bullshit” and the killers saying “do bones”. Over all I think it will make the game a little cleaner
---
You were warned
---
Sounds like an acceptable camp
---
Wasted God pallet
---
Yoooo! Basement party!

I feel this post in my soul

---
“Why did you t-bag” - I was not attacking, spinning in circles crouching and uncrouching and running to a pallet and back... how is this not asking to farm?
---
Well spirit beads aren’t really that bullshit because they are rarer than fucking ultra rare items in the blood web. Devs plz this is a cry for help
---
So thats the gas in the Clown's bottles...
---
Everything is unlocked in Kill Your Friends ..
---
Fully aware, just...why the "using" part? I get that Dead By Daylight has some fucked up backstories, but they can't just put in a character that r\*ped woman and then killed them!
---
And I cant see the Demi hanging someone from a sacrificial hook.
---
The demogorgon is a (debatably) intelligent, hive mind and feral creature.  Defend, attack, consume.  I can't see it making offerings for praise to a greater power.
---
And I can very much see Billy strangling someone to death or worse.  He tried as much in the show after all so I really dont get how this is far fetched for you.
---
Billy hits all the classic markers. Human, torn soul, looking to appease a dark God.  Besides he would have way better cosmetics.  Life guard Billy,  shirtless Jean's Billy,  etc.
---
I mean the developers made their decision,  clearly my opinion means little.  But I have seen or heard no arguments that make Demi a better fit than mind flayed Billy.
---
The rational that season 3 wasn't out when they made the DLC seems to be the only worthy argument to why they would not have selected mind flayed Billy
---
They confirmed this happening soon?
---
I’m sensing sarcasm
---
I mean not really
---
Literally just finished a game where that happened to me
---
You want achievements also, maybe?
---
Again, you're not using logic. If I find you first, and you go down in one hit, I'm going after you. You're way, way, way over-thinking it and just not seeing the obvious.
---
Y’all are usually toxic
---
“I’m so proud of this community”
---
I was trying to use as many words as possible without saying... that
---
I love it when I get accused of camping when the entire SWF is within the BBQ &amp; Chili radius and I can see two of them.
---
I want to give Dwight a “locker bed”, where he can go and close the doors behind him to hide from all the bad people.
---
As a Blue Haired Feng I approve.  👍
---
Yeah, that's clearly visible from your original post.
---
You see that’s a great idea and all but most people wouldn’t bother do the cleansing or praying cause they’d rather do gens
---
Yes, just something I can earn with my friends instead of toxic pubs. I played a few and they aren't fun.
---
This looks really cool, great work on this.
---
I know pc master race and all but the game is super popular on Xbox due to it being on gamepass
---
One of my fav scenes from the movie
---
A weeb pleb talking shit what else is new?
---
The story was a little longer at first...... then I ran out of words I could use
---
If you run to the other side of the map for your next target because you have bbq and chili then you wont have the option to tunnel unless you choose to camp
---
People on here have been suggesting small game should tell the specific survivor who runs it how many Totems are left, similar in a way that Thrill of the Hunt tells the killer how many Totems are up. It should happen.
---
Honestly I'd love a killer or survivor from the 1920s or 1940s
---
Excellent meme
---
Lol why did RepostSentinel mention me in this?
---
You do realize that it would be exploited like there's no tomorrow, don't you?
---
PC, bug In-Game
---
Ranking up past rank 15 drops me back to rank 16.
---
If I achieve rank 15, and get a pip or double pip that will send me to rank 14, I will go back to the main menu and it will reset me back to rank 16.  I should rank up past 15, but instead, I get deranked to rank 16, which shouldn't even happen if I had depipped.  It happens every time I try and rank up.
---
Why are they so butt hurt about someone not leaving? We’re they the killer?
---
It's the next killer getting major work done, the new routine seems to be to do these during midchapter patches
---
/s or no?
---
Coming from the toxic Freddy that slugged themed
---
Thad looks ominous as fuck, geez
---
Pretty much confirms the ptb will be next Tuesday and will end on the Monday with DLC dropping Tuesday 10th
---
Lol so true
---
Still havent done that, they kill themselves too fast
---
I'm no killer main, so this may not be right, but I think that for the achievement you need:  
---
A. To get at least 2 pips  
---
B. To get 5k bloodpoints in every category  
---
Anybody that knows the requirements by heart can feel free to correct me on this.
---
Not seeing anybody on bbq definitely encourages camping. Because you dont have a target and if nobody is on gens then nothing is lost
---
Soooo can anyone explain what a blood hunt event is? Nevermind it just means double BP. I thought it was like, a different playstyle or something /edit.
---
But not everyone utilizes an Exhaustion Perk nor is everyone going to be on a Generator all the time. And what happens when the Generator is over 50%? Because of this, I give it a 2.85/5, but my view might change.
---
Edit: I now give it a 3.2/5.
---
But even if they don’t cleanse they got broken  and injured so if you vomit them all you can end chases with one hit I think, and if they cleanse you become a huntress with a minigun
---
Because they prolly played eight other games that day where they got toasted with hate mail for playing the killer, so they may just assume it’s always like that.
---
The game has a game manual built in that details every status effect, including icons.
---
Crutch perk my ass NOED is a crutch perk but you seem fine with that
---
always nice to see ace attorney fans
---
Oh wow, I knew your YouTube pfp looked familiar. You are that summoners war player who transitioned to dbd. Nice
---
While we are at it, there’s a bug in my games. Someone who can actually hurt me? I thought this was gen repair simulator?! Wtf Behaviour, plz fix this game breaking bug....
---
Her name rhymes with leg
---
She moves fast with her legs
---
She sprints in bursts...
---
And that's why I always bring monitor and abuse on my P3 Hag. Probably one of only 2 killers it makes sense on due to the 22 meter TR.
---
But they don't, I play both sides and survivor feels pretty damm chill. What ruins things for survivors isn't how easy or hard it is when playing solo, its whether or not your teammates are stupid potatoes, or if killer happens to be a toxic asshole. Not that being good at survivor, and having 3 other good survivors guarantees escape, but the same goes for killer guaranteeing a 3-4k. Map rng can play a big role too.
---
She's 18 in season 3
---
They dnt make eggs. Eggs r ferterlized by a male than the creature is born. They are like a virus. They plant some of themself into a host.
---
That outfit is from season one so people would assume she’s season one Nancy then
---
First of all, fuck off with the downvotes only because you can't have a conversation without taking It as a competition
---
Second of all, then what's your point? You acknowledge she doesn't enter the Spirit world and that she enters the Etheral plane (If you don't know the difference Just look for It) right?
---
Therefore the dude's statement is completly right,  in this moment, only those who use the Spirit world can be lightburned
---
This doesn't mean we will be unable to blind the demogorgon and that he won't have a lightburn mechanic as well tho
---
ASS: C L E N C H E D
---
R/wooosh? Idk but calm down, it's Just a shitpost
---
I think he should get a momentary speed boost when he uses his chainsaw because you have to be in dick slapping range in order to hit somebody. Kind of like wraith
---
He needs the face
---
Nah, scratched mirror and lery's just for the jumpscares
---
Big Barbecue
---
I wouldn't complain about that Kate skin tho.
---
You complain about the toxicity as survivor?
---
First, get used to it, you will experience it A LOT in this game
---
Second, if you think salt from killers is bad, then try playing killer not according to "RuLeBoOk", you can swim in the amount of acid and salt coming from the post game chat. I recommend Billy with NoED for "better" experience
---
Of course, Im not saying that ALL survivors are toxic and killers NEVER are toxic, I just say that you experience WAY more salt while trying to win as killer than as survivor
---
Yup added to my friends list.  Nice guy, he even helped me figure out what other DLC killers I should consider investing in.
---
So play nurse then
---
Oh ok thank you. Damn that’s a lot of work
---
I stoped playing seriosly. I can now go on forever and my blood precior is lower HECK i enjoy messing with the last 2 survivors more than actually getting a 4k. (Basicly farming but BECAUSE they suck)
---
No way Xbox is lowest its on grandpas and in top 12 Xbox games played
---
&gt;I mean you could just live your life and let him have his no? You don’t like him ok. Go watch those you like and let him be.
---
He literally said he enjoys his videos wtf. Just because he criticizes him doesn't make him a hater who isn't a decent human being. Omg You guys seem delusional.
---
BBQ, Distressing, Thrill of the hunt, Beast of prey, pudding. Im getting those fucking bloodpoints
---
Man enter the florpus was such a good movie
---
The music is perfect, too.
---
I think she then went on to kill all of those people. Iirc
---
Where did the wiki get this information from? I can't find any official source.
---
New self heal animation for that skin, dwight opens the box and eats a slice or two
---
I had a game versus a Doctor where I popped the first four gens by myself and managed to stay out of tier one until the very end when I went for an unhook. Worth it, though, all of us got out but one.
---
Didn’t know about terminator either, huh. Leather face was a blast in 10 though
---
Big Cock No Shock Doc skin when?
---
I know that, you're correcting someone who didn't say anything wrong.
---
He was saying that it is more than likely that every licensed character will stay cash only. Not that most of the licensed characters will be cash only.
---
What's worse is they kept saying for months and months that they couldn't sort out bans on PS4 but the moment an exploit became apparent that allowed you to swindle the bloodweb and rank up through the prestige levels without having to play they had the ban system in place within 2 days lol.
---
I wish we had perk and cosmetic interactions like this tbh. They could just be little Easter eggs
---
Why does it have to be after school starts WHY
---
Why can’t we just simplify tunneling for what it really is? The killer intentionally going after the same survivor until they die. Ever see a killer with Dying Light? THAT is tunneling.
---
Anything else is just bad plays.just because you got caught twice in a row doesn’t mean the killer is tunneling, it just means you were caught twice in a row. No need to DC, just accept it and don’t get caught a third time.
---
Ruin doesnt make m1ing a generator any less interesting
---
no, it scans their library not yours.
---
Why not buy the game pass? It's literally 10 dollars
---
Yeah I never got him but he looked crazy fun. I did really like Freddy and predator though.
---
Oh yeah I never even mentioned that spawn is on his way too. There just so many cool guests.
---
I ain't got no damn money..
---
He never said he was new too killer; just new at hag.
---
Something smells like projecting... and dickcheese.
---
Then why not get job or do some chores around the house and see if your parents will give you some?
---
So a Baby Dwight can run it and turn DBD into a typical video game escort mission?
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Really?
---
This also happens to me while playing as the Plague if I not charge her M2 completely (if you charge the half of it, you are still able to puke but it has a shorter duration than a fully loaded attack)
---
If its a mandatory objectives they will do it :P
---
Ive not seen anything of stranger things, wasnt crazy for it either cause i felt it was overhyped.  It coming to dbd though has made me want to start watching the show.  This chapter will be amazing for dbd.  Lots of publicity, TWO SURVIVORS, 9 META SHIFTING PERKS like this is one of the healthiest licensed chapters I have seen for the game (looking at u DS and MoM)
---
Yeah but who spends that many blood points without even playing a killer on a killer
---
Most compliments I get as a killer are followed with some version of "lol jk you suck"
---
If a character is allowed to be in a game where they get brutally murdered, then they must be AT LEAST 18 years old. I'm sure an observer with simple knowledge will realize that.
---
Inner strength is just self caring in a locker, it's not op, you still have to spend time breaking totems, so really you're not only spending 8 seconds to heal
---
As a Spirit main who uses 99.9% of the time only brown add-ons, my favourites are the Gifted Bamboo Comb (decreases activation charge time) and the Zōri (increases movement speed). The Origami Crane (increases power recovery) is good too.
---
The only one I don't recommend is the Shiawase Amulet (increases duration), since it doesn't really make much of a difference in my opinion.
---
Ah that’s hot
---
Like I haven't tried doing shit for my parents all damn day already..sorry I'm just frustrated as shit right now because I've tried getting money from them but they're kinda douches sometimes.
---
My mind has been expanded holy jesus.
---
I would have ds’d her anyway
---
&gt; Considering totems are a secondary objective already
---
Maybe i didn't explain it right -&gt; this would become MANDATORY in addition to gens. You have to do gens AND the secondary objective.
---
&gt; I fail to see what this means. My apologies, but can you explain?
---
A rushed action is when you fast vault or fast enter a locker. Essentially anything that alerts a killer.
---
&gt; Maybe actually a ritual to appeal for the entity would fit better... 
---
Good idea
---
&gt;  But theres already the offerings you burn
---
I mean the idea is to have a secondary objective :P
---
&gt; Like, theres a survivor inside. Will it just sit there for the animation that is 3x slower? He will be just stuck for more time before being grabed
---
Yes exactly, but if there's no survivor he just wasted time opening a fortified empty locker that takes time to open
---
&gt; Instead of lockers, you would find material inside the lockers to reinforce pallets. A reinforced pallet will take a little more time to be droped, will stun for longer (2 times maybe), and will take longer to break (3 to 4 kicks to break)
---
Could be a good idea for another secondary objective
---
and i oop
---
Y e s
---
Dude just kill the survivors and they wont finish the gens ez
---
You no can heal while you haves broken
---
His lunge is the exact same as every other killer.
---
&gt; they argue against it because it ruins the fun
---
And it's not the other players job to make sure that everyone is having "fun." Conversely, it's not fun getting gen-rushed or dealing with a key or Instant Heal or DS (even after you've left the hook and really gave the guy a chance to get away) or Adrenaline. That's not "fun" to deal with either. But the instant the killer breaks one of the rules survivor mains have made up there's this just immense ree'ing that never ceases.
---
Pray to God? You mean the Entity?
---
That’s what the devs want you to think ;)
---
Just do bones
---
Cruel confinement looks like a bad perk, the vast majority of gens getting completed are not done while the killer is near
---
No many countries have different ages for things like that it’s the SAFEST to make all characters 18 but because moms and Karen’s are looking for things to damn games need a safety net like the time gap between the end of the new nightmare movie and Quinten appearing in dbd it wasn’t necessary but it’s for safety against controversies it sucks but with the media now it’s necessary
---
Well offer to do work for your neighbors or offer to babysit for relative
---
He knows what a rushed action is, he doesnt see the point of forcing survivors to do rushed actions to escape.
---
ya :P
---
I want an Xbox version
---
Any level, depends on luck.
---
Jokes on you head on is the superior exhaustion perk
---
that’s a loooooooooooot of downvotes
---
Because he needs them to be afraid and he also likes fucking with him. He does dumb stuff all the time throughout the series lol
---
Rancor is a perk you ignore the obsession with, and although the obsession switching furtive chase gives is cool... it's a really really really bad perk, and building an entire build around it isn't great
---
The Doc starts in Punishment IIRC
---
I heard console nurse is hard, but short blinks around objects are very hard to learn, even on PC. I suggest that you run no add-ons at all until you got the hang of it. Practice makes perfect.
---
Yep, it stacks with other bonuses too. And with 5 bloody party streamers on double blood point events you can get 250,000+ a match
---
This is parody at it’s finest. Thank you.
---
He was hella fun to play in mkx though
---
"Trolling me back" lmao well said!
---
that single teabag was just the icing on the cake, good job
---
This is an ass subreddit apparently
---
Killer queue times are bad even now, they won’t be better because two new survivors release because the people who play exclusively killer are not going to switch to survivor for very long, if at all.
---
That’s right wait em out
---
Oh damn I need that! When do they have double xp?
---
Michael is so good against toxic survivors and it's one of the reasons why I love him. If they teabag, you stalk them. if they instant heal, you have your tier 3. His ability to mori without hooking is the beeeeeest &lt;3
---
Oh really? Would’ve never known.
---
you aren't very smart are you
---
Omg this would be amazing. Make her like Michael Myers (no sounds) and works so that when you have your back to her she gets closer to you and stops when you're looking in her direction.
---
That's a really stupid perk, you might as well dc when you load in if you ran this perk, it would have the same effect, any killer would simply ignore you and gg you threw the game
---
I mean this place is mostly lawless, if blatant cheating is rarely punished and toxic behavior is ignored then that's what will continue to grow as people who aren't amused will just go elsewhere. When we have moderation we'll be able to purge out people who don't know how to show respect. Until then, it's free for all and only the strong and tenacious will survive.

Updoot for highest of efforts

This shitpost started a full fledged war. Guess i’ll join in then

You’re 17, buy it yourself. I’m also 17 and have been paying for my own games/dlc since I was 10. The game is like 20$

Thank you I'll look closer I appreciate it

Oh ok. Thanks
---
I know I'm butting in here, but for me it's neither. I have the in-game chat turned off. I know better than to try and interact with this game's community (in-game, that is).  
---
If you wanna try to fix the community, by all means you're free to try, but you'll be pushing a boulder up a mountain for quite some time. Don't be shocked when you realise it doesn't work.
---
What do the props even do? Does the player get to read them?
---
If your parents won’t get you an allowance then get a job, or babysit, or mow lawns. You’re 17, you should be getting a car soon and moving out in a year or two, time to start being an adult
---
Ok...? Why post this
---
So Mindbreaker is Haunted Grounds’ little brother now?
---
There’s an official dev response that says basically at the moment it does nothing but they want to find a way to reward it
---
He still got a lot of bp for that too wtf lol
---
Saying something is "hilarious but funny at the same time" makes no sense
---
I want a summer cosmetic dlc with swimsuits for all of the characters.

I did message him and tell him that he wasted a tombstone but he hasn’t responded.

A half destroyed sattelite floating through the cold depths of space. blood is scattered everywhere, what could have happened here?
---
New Killer: The Android
---
The Android is an alien robot which mysteriously  crash landed on the Observer Satellite. It proceeded to murder every occupant it saw with no mercy. It was eventually dragged into space through an airlock on which it crash landed once again into what seemed to be a forest. I heard screams and knew there were more targets to be eliminated. He has 115% speed and tall height.
---
Power: Body Switch
---
Throughout the trial you will notice two auras of other deactivated androids spawned randomly on opposite sides of the map. If you look at one and use your power you will teleport into that body where you will get up and wreak havoc in another location. The body you teleported from will deactivate and kneel on the floor like the one you teleported to. The deactivated androids are physical objects and as such can be used to block pathways.

It’s BhVRs fault! They are the ones who have let this shit go on forever and have never once lifted a finger to curb the toxic shit in this game! So if it kills off the new players coming in and them quitting so be it, because they are the only ones to blame, since they won’t say or do jack shit about the toxic bs that happens! To busy righting spaghetti code and dumping out another dlc or getting a new tattoo...

He probably died from a loss of brain cells

Can anything be done? Can you both move around or do objectives? This is super weird.

I don’t know what my team was doing. I fucked up in basically getting down by tanking a save.

I'm a baby Huntress and I'd need you sa bad in my games:((

No problem. hope youre liking the game so far.

sekiro/soulsborne games are single player pve for the most part with possible coop and pvp with similarly leveled and/or equipped invaders. Very different from an asymmetric pvp game where the only thing affecting matchmaking is rank (false SBMM) and connection (maybe.) So the difficulty depends on player skill and their loadout. Meaning that new players can run into players who deranked and have high level builds. Which greatly affects difficulty. (e.g. noed ruin destroy newer survivors.) True SBMM is difficult to do and dbd cant really implement build based mm because of how u can change loadouts in pregame. Only realistic way is to change MM is to take best inventory possible into account which again would suck for anybody trying to do a daily for a lvl 1 character. They do need to git gud but you cant expect them to be good right off the bat.
---
In any game smurfs/derankers hurts the inflow of new players. Best we could hope for to have a larger playerbase is that they face other new players. Which new players tend to play survivor so...
---
and we want a larger playerbase. that'll give the game more money and more development.
---
tldr that person comparing soulsborne git gud casul to dbd get good... smh
---
Maybe people want to save their stealth mode? Who cares?
---
I just played with this guy yesterday lmao, unironically found myself saying "god dammit dwight" at a couple things he did tho
---
Death metal meme that can also be applied to Amanda? Nice
---
Green rank is pretty casual on ps4 idk what you mean
---
They all the time on PS4, either they camp, tunnel or both! So anytime I get into a game and it’s GF I’m just waiting for the camping to begin. Fucking bs when you have a stealthy killer and you gotta sit on the hook like a cock stain!
---
If it was inspired maybe. I despise the idea of having any real life killer in the game however, but if it was like you said than I dont think it would be all bad.
---
Why don’t killers just add and message one of the survivors in the lobby their intent to farm?
---
IM DA GIANT RAT WHO MAKES ALL OF DA RULES
---
true but no matter what a killer shouldn't spawn literally RIGHT next to a survivor.
---
Seems that way.
---
The fact that you still don’t understand is simply mind blowing

I like Barbecue because I'm Hungry

lol this always happens to me, hella annoying :/

MUHAHAHAHAHA!

Okay dumb question but who is Susie and why is she not her own separate character apart from Legion?
---
I mean if you want to waste all your bloodpoints be my guest.
---
Awesome !!
---
Or it can be good if you’re injured/asleep and need attention. This is the kind of Perk I like since it works as a reverse Bond. 1 can run Bond to see everyone possible, but everyone can see you possible if you run Better Together.

I’ll easily get it back with that BBQ

Platform: Xbox
---
Type: Bug In-Game
---
Issue: Almost during every chase as the survivor, my y-axis controls get inverted randomly and don’t go back to normal for a couple minutes which usually ends up with me getting hit ://
---
This bug happened to me the other day. I had fun running around in circles on the other side of the map.
---
The scariest one of them all.
---
What? You just complained about deliverance working?
---
Why do people think that after 3 years of this community being toxic shitheads everyone’s going to decide to change just because of one licensed chapter? It would be nice to not have to have the shittiest playerbase in all of gaming, but it’s not going to change just because there’s going to be a bunch of new players. There’s a lot of sad people who play this game that have nothing better to do in their life than be assholes, unfortunately. Also, a large amount of the playerbase are grown ass adults, and they’re not going to change because they feel entitled to do what they do, and if anything, the flood of new players is just going to make it worse.
---
Here I go again to Nurse

Awhh, we should make a little group :)

I paid 40 on my Xbox for it last year, plus dlc money. Pretty cheap honestly

---
Why would robin replace a already established character?
---
Susie is one of the members of the "Legion", technically she didn't ever want to kill, however i believe the Legion's entire design was kinda failed and she ended up as a cosmetic - Just like Joey, the other Member of Legion that's essentially locked behind a paywall.

I edited one of the flairs to say steve harrington main
---
Would this be coming to console aswell or is it a pc only event?
---
Starting out of stealth allows you to save it. As Night Shroud goes into cooldown when it is broken, this forces GF players to avoid detection from the start. Many people do play him that way, myself included, but to not even *allow* other playstyles is positively ridiculous.
---
He wasn’t in the trailer for the dlc though
---
This is fucking killing me. Path of Exile launches on the 9th, Borderlands 3. My GOD SOMEONE SEND HELP

That's it?

It put me into an infinite loading screen and didnt give me anything for the game
---
Thanks I got it now
---
That's interesting I never knew that! Thanks
---
Toxicity and asshole players are synonymous to DBDs identity. It really sucks that’s the fact of it and it’s never going to change because the game is a tug of war, where one sides fun is always at the other’s expense.
---
If new players can’t handle that, and I hate to say it, they should leave end of. Besides there’s nothing say newbies won’t end up toxic themselves, a lot of them will.
---
Kind of an asshole move to laugh at poverty. Not every survivor can afford a yellow toolbox. 
---
/s
---
Agreed. People rely way too heavily on perks it's honestly sad.
---
That's like 99% of SWF that would fall under your definition as they use Discord or other 3rd party Voice Coms which give them a massive advantage, unfairly in comparison to Solo Survs. Hell they even had to start blocking the ability to see a killer's loadout upon death because of these players using a 3rd party program.
---
So essentially you're calling a massive portion of the player base cheaters.
---
Why did you watermark it?
---
As a Freddy main even I say it’s true.

That is hilarious lmao

Jesus I have never noticed how much he enjoyed it.

I know this is old, but how the hell do you order from Fun World’s website? I can’t find any purchase option. I wanted to order a Ghostface costume and I just can’t find the “buy” button!
---
Yeah, I agree, but it's even worse when survivors find it first, I play killer and I have literally seen people not save 2 - 3 people who are on the hook, just so they can wait for the hatch to open, which they are right next to. I swear all the toxic kiddies from fortnite and roblox have jumped onto this game after hearing about the stranger things DLC.
---
Baby survivors don't know how borrowed time works
---
LMFAOOO
---
Booty shorts Dwight when
---
Yeah but spirit is better than non-cleansing survivors. The huntress mini gun thing is deferentially more powerful than both the spirit and cleansing survivors.
---
He face camped cuz he taunted. If you taunt its like literally an automatic face camp rule #32 in the killers guide for survivors
---
Bitch
---
You've done an excellent job demonstrating that the endgame is in the killers favor, but you never stated what your problem is with the endgame. What is the issue?
---
Yes i could run about the map while they just sat there and they could look around and get me out of stealth mode
---
yup, it's been making the rounds lately. It's the new bottle flip challenge.
---
Demogorgon's perks are kinda meh in my opinion.
---
Steve is a mixed bag; Babysitter is awesome, Cameraderie is straight up detrimental, and Second Wind is a good concept that needs a bit of work.
---
All of Nancy's perks are really good.
---
You’ll actually be.
---
It’s a dice roll for you to leave the game after your team have already failed the trial? Sounds like a pretty good deal to me imo.
---
not spy from tf2 but instead the bootleg version?  T R I G G E R E D
---
Shouldnt the pics be seapped because being moried would seem like the "im better" kinda thing
---
It's also impossible to do if the team isn't playing ultra-altruistic.
---
5 Gens up and 4 basement hooks? it's mostly the survivors fault for feeding.
---
you can take a screenshot on xbox and upload it to a onedrive I believe. Which is linked to your xbl/microsoft account. For better quality.
---
Rank 10 Shirtless Myers vs Rank 10 swf Sawdette, Shirtless David, Bikini Kate and Marine Steve

They said the issue is that its a complete coin flip on 'who finds the hatch first' and OP doesn't like that aspect of Dbd

Go with Adrenaline. Medkits are faster than selfcare and selfcare ruins the feeling of being in danger since you can infinitely heal. Adrenaline does offer some clutch moments

I've been doing it for health reasons for a few months. LDL, HDL, etc. all way down, lost 20 lbs of basically fat, better energy levels, feel great. People think you need meat for protein, but you don't. So many high protein plant foods like quinoa and many others. Making a cheese sauce that tastes better than any nacho cheese sauce I've ever had out of pureed cashews, nutritional yeast, and various spices, and it's healthy to boot. What can it hurt to investigate it yourself, right?

Well that sucks. Have you tried maybe putting one of those "colorblind" transparent plastic layers on your TV or wear colorblind glasses while playing. I'm not an expert on it, but that's my solution.

That’s sweet :)

My survivor matches fill up in about 10-30s. Killer matches are significantly longer for me to find. Xbox
---
Memes
---
That must've taken a lot of weeks.
---
This game is hard. There is alot of difficulty in it. And my first game was awful. Still love it still play it. Honestly these guys are speaking the truth.
---
Because 99% of the times it’s the killer tunneling after the first hook to get the mori.
---
https://i.imgur.com/0SQMaVm.jpg
---
She...clearly took you to the hatch on purpose? You realize that right?
---
Why are you so mad? 
---
It’s really obvious when you’re against a new player, so don’t bully them. Pretty simple?
---
It'll never get reworked tho, might get a new perk that has some similar mechanics. Noed is cool tho, just not to you and some.
---
These seem like balanced perks, nice work.
---
Mostly because people who have played 1000+ hours just DC out of unfun games and end up deranking
---
I'd go bananas if they ever decided to throw in a wendigo killer
---
Welp, u actually CAN find a hatch
---
Will do when I get my new computer to play Dbd again
---
Yeah I guess but it really sucks for people who are new or people like me who are hella rusty or just plain kinda suck
---
Ikr! I was so proud like “ I got to be on a team with this angel
---
No, what he was implying is that if you get stomped time and time again then you should just quit, instead of maybe giving advice or being helpful he was instead reinforcing toxicity, which 90% of this community loves to do
---
"Say cheese"
---
No assuming at all. I specifically said without knowing how good you are in a chase and talked about my experience with survivors who end up doing four gens while the other three are doing the hook dance. Why are you so defensive about this?
---
It happens to everyone even some pc players to a extent it’s just dbd
---
You're right that it's a bad overall build but you're not getting out of that basement if LF doesn't let you out. It's a troll build that deliberately ruins the game for the survivors.
---
Came here to say this. Well done.
---
Man it'll suck when Ruin goes from being cleansed in 2.5 seconds to 1.5 seconds
---
But it didn’t do that before so this is concerning.
---
But thats the thing surviving or killing all 4 ppl isnt "winning" theres no winning in this game. In dbd tournaments you win by points not escape. Ive pipped twice to camping tunneling killers. It just makes the game less fun. Like if ur not gunna play the game why play. Destroy gens interupt healing. You cant do that if your camping we know your at the hook it takes away the pressure and adrenaline apart of the game. N it goes the same way with survivors so fixated on surviving instead of actually doing the objectives of the game. Its like telling your friends your gunna play basketball with them and you sit on the bench drinking water the whole game.
---
Shouldn't you have gotten an Achievement/Trophy? I got one my first time I did this?
---
Have her tell killers she's actually a man. Fixed.
---
Spirit, if you get good with her you'll be unstoppable.
---
Laughs in sprint burst
---
Wow if only that actually worked
---
I'm on console, does that make any difference?
---
Perhaps
---
So have they made any mention to any sort of restriction or cooldown on this perk? 
---
If not it’s gonna be a real problem for killers once gens are powered if they have someone hooked
---
They’ll probably just make it to where the killer can’t see the progress of the bar anymore, kinda like how BT works now
---
That's been going on since endgame collapse has been released.
---
The vug under the rug.
---
Not really no only thing is FPS but it’s really not as bad as people say
---
No the only killers that get affected by the different platforms is Huntress and Nurse.
---
They’ll probably all be included
---
PS4... It can be around 10 minutes for both Killer and Survivor.
---
No difference, Spirit is top 3 and easy to play on console, unlike Nurse and Billy
---
He could've just picked them up and got it over and done with though tbh.
---
Thanks :)
---
You won't be able to purchase The Pig with Irri.  Shards since she is a licensed killer.  You have to buy her with Auric Cells or the Saw DLC.  However, you can buy The Spirit with Irri. Shards.  Don't be surprised when survivors DC when you're playing her though.  Especially if your running prayer beads bracelet as an add-on.
---
You know, I actually think that Hircine and the Entity might see eye to eye on some things. Their end goals are different, but they both believe in giving the prey a chance to succeed.
---
Pig is great man just need to learn how to use her well it's not that hard I'm a piggy main
---
the framerate isn't capped at the loading screen, so its tryna do... sumthin, look i know that its not overheating but that's it
---
Xbox or ps4?
---
Xbox
---
Nope sorry not powerful enough
---
Bruh what, I thought they patched that?
---
It’s not fun at all having a killer who wants to farm and by farming as a survivor you are encouraging more killers to farm
---
Mmmmm, how many times this happens.
---
A great and often extended endgame was trying to lure the killer away from the hatch long enough to escape. If they wouldn't budge I would do a gen. Or miss a check to see if they would come over to get me thinking I didn't know where the hatch was. There was so many possibilities. 
---
However, this was rare. The it's over already ... you've lost response is bullshit. You didn't lose anymore then the killer did for not hooking you. 
---
The reason endgame was added was because assholes wouldn't leave the match when the gates were open.
---
Way too often
---
Then why was DS nerfed?
---
Yikes dude
---
burger king myers
---
Yeah, the issue is that it still hasn't ended lol
---
You're 100% right. 
---
As a killer main with multiple p3 max perk killers and rank 1 achievement locked away I will also add that the game is no longer about points for most killers, it's about the chase. If you BM or show off doing cute spinnies after a pallet or vault, flashlight clickies or teabagging, most killers will very quickly shift from "fun chases" to "ensure jackass dies" as their primary win condition.
---
the fuck
---
What's the name if you don't mind telling?
---
I asked a killer to farm because my screen was glitched and i couldnt do anything in thr game that reauired skill checks. He actually said yes n wasnt a dick about it.
---
Of who?...
---
It really doesn't.
---
Whew friend I got some news for you
---
Well I guess my idea is just try hard and make them regret giving her any leeway.
---
I think Ebony's are a little overboard, but hey as long and moris exist, Instaheals and brand new parts are fine too
---
I kept the original faceplate, it wasn't charging, so I went inside to check the connections and thought I'd put the faceplate on whilst I was in there. And yeah it was an anniversary controller
---
For the part where they can tell she's a female.
---
oh YEA! Rush that gen BABY!
---
Spirit is really strong because you can’t be looped. Also with the new chapter perks coming out haunted grounds could become very strong.
---
Ok but can he talk about how he also had insidious to make the scratched mirror/tombstone combo even more terrifying
---
I had the sams glitch happen to me except i was fully healed.  I was running around the map floating in the air as meg.  Idk if the killer can see that glitch tho
---
Why do people see insta heals as OP?
---
::Haggy screeching::
---
Purple rank is where most players are, you get about a 50% chance of having at least one competent teammate
---
What are you talking about it needs a buff make it so that completing one generator opens the exit gates instantly without triggering noed
---
God damnit, take the upvote
---
Tht really is yall. I dont disagree.
---
-50% proximity to hooked survivors entity displeased.
---
People can’t be helped, I’d say block ‘em and carry on with your day
---
She made the account when she was little so it's her dogs name
---
... You don't want low levels of HDL. That can be a very bad thing.
---
Steve rocked that demigorgons shit
---
all, just keep grabbin perks till it shows its wallhackin face. if you get other perks first, it will increase the chances of it spawning in your b.w.
---
So do I if you exchange hag with LF
---
This is truly a controller that I personally love.
---
Might as well toss down trapper too lmao
---
It’s our duty to our community
---
great to hear
---
Obviously a female name for her dog
---
I’m boutta cop that strat
---
Pizza time
---
Bet
---
Today I fucking hit the skillcheck but it wouldn't let me free. I even heard the god damn skillcheck sound.
---
So they're both niche perks, I agree that's what makes them terrible
---
Oh I try to tell people at those times when he is wrongfully accused of tunneling or camping, as a 50/50 players it's really annoying to get called tunneler or camper when in reality you have hooked atleast 3 people before the first death.
---
At least they gave you a reason... when I got banned from the Headlander forum for saying "When are you guys going to finish Spacebase?" they didn't even bother providing a reason and permabanned me.  Sore spot I guess.
---
They prey at night, they stalk at night
---
Hag and plague
---
Surprised it wasn’t nurse who was knocked down
---
almost as smart as running no mither and self care
---
True although if the devs are going to stick to what they usually do the dlc will drop either the last day or the day after the BP event
---
all i said was "don't be a dick and spoil people." if u take offense to that, your the one with a problem
---
It was like 1 second between life and death
---
How does a dog's name tell people someone is a female? People are quick to assume that it's a female without knowing the person
---
Hey there, I appreciate the feedback. I just recently started playing the game and have only played as a survivor, so I'm unaware of the difference between playing as a survivor and a killer via the salt. I disagree with survivors being salty and teabagging all day, definitely seen my fair share of people get what they deserve while teabagging and I escape like you're supposed to, lmao. I'm not taking a side on which is worse. I've had teammates sabotage me quite often, so trust me you don't need to convince me that both sides are bad. I was simply expressing my opinion on what I've experienced so far playing as a survivor. Thanks for the Billy tip as well ~
---
Claudettes are the queens of salt, they go alongside nea
---
Let people do what they want.
---
 delete and download again?
---
Lmao should he just have picked her up right after downing her and get ds'ed?
---
Kilers: Survivors abuse meta perks and SWF
---
Survivors:
---
I've seen a lot, but as much as Nea
---
Yeah its freaking horrible
---
Why would they use the god pallet like that lol
---
Lol is that meg mixed in with the killers?
---
Yeah the situation that concluded this must have been the other survivor grabbing them without borrowed
---
Because a dog can have a female name :/ so they put 2 and 2 together assuming the person is a female because there's a female name
---
I've made it this far only buying Ash and Ashy Slashy.  
---
And now I gotta buy EVERYTHING in the ST DLC when it comes out.
---
Not complaining doe since I got my steam key for 5 bucks third party but damn.
---
I've always wondered if the Devs have tried to make a deal with the makers of Until Dawn. 
---
Like I know the Wendigo isnt copyrighted or anything, but Until Dawn definitely made the history and stories popular again. I doubt it will happen but it would be cool if we got an Until Dawn chapter with Hannah as the Wendigo and maybe the Stranger (I think his name is Jack Fiddler) or even Beth as the survivor.
---
Like I said, I doubt it will ever happen, but it would still be pretty cool.
---
If they do a Wendigo killer I wonder what their power could be?
---
yep, probably, but you can always put one more perk in :D
---
You are correct. The perk really doesn’t make sense by design, it should work the reverse way. Killer inside 16m, all survivors outside of 16m, timer pauses. 
---
With it being the way it is, the timer for the killer end should definitely keep ticking down as if there were no pause. If they don’t do that, it’s very stupid. Should also be a little longer.
---
So im legally blind in my right eye. And i thought it was a guy with a basketball for the LONGEST TIME.and i didn't understand why till two weeks ago i actually looked at it n realized my left eyeball lied to me MY WHOLE LIFE
---
Because it was an unfun and unhealthy perk. Also it was changed not nerfed. It's still an incredibly strong perk.
---
Babysitter is really nice to stop Killers from tunneling tho....Actually thats Steves only good Perk imo
---
explain pls)
---
Oh gee, maybe being able to fully heal yourself in chase or fully heal a downed survivor (with 2 health state syringe) instantly is a bit OP. To be honest, if the devs got rid of Ebony and Ivory moris in exchange of removal of both instaheals, this game would be a lot more fun for everyone.
---
They said once per match.
---
If it's their lucky toolbox, they wouldn't need to worry about dying with it
---
Someone almost did this to my team, but as the last survivor I gave em the ol' flip flop and got to the hatch.  
---
Great job pulling this off.
---
Bruh so blurry
---
you already lost if you reach endgame ( as in last survivor) it shouldn’t be an absolute win, it’s a second chance.
---
## bruh 🙌😤👌👌👌
---
Your the one getting pissy I was just saying it had been out for two months you fucking cunt
---
Werewolf killer confirmed?
---
Dude itd never end tho so whats the point?
---
Oh well this is dbd where both sides are toxic as hell
---
What's this from?
---
\*Bamboozled\*
---
How about, we bring a white ward.. but no item🤯
---
Then she should definitely just lie and say she is a male or just ignore them if they keep bugging her
---
I feel like at the End Game Collapse, you escaping if your team/you, haven't done your goal, then you escaping is a courtesy (one that can obviously be withheld). You shouldn't really live in the first place since technically you've already lost.
---
Ah, nice, panic averted, I must have overlooked that
---
Thanks
---
It can only work once, as in only one pause is possible while someone is hooked.
---
Both make you forcibly vomit.
---
I unironically kind of want this but I wonder if Burger King would be willing.
---
Wow you were extremely lucky that pallet stunned her lmao
---
I think so finally someone with enough sense I would get rid of Mories for insta heals happily
---
Then the nurse is for you
---
Oh shit its the meme maker himself
---
and all i was saying that so what if its been out for two months? obviously not everyone has seen it. it's common sense. lmao why are u so mad?
---
Safe to say that isn't the case on ps4 (typically)
---
self care is garbage. it’s such a win for killer side, it’s like a third of a gen, if the killer has nurses you’re fucked. ofc it gives you a slot, but a good perk&gt;an item. get adrenaline
---
I also see a lot of Clauds that are actually altruistic and shit too though, kinda balances it out
---
Behold, peasant.  A god
---
ye true but streaming with a delay is fucking stupid and people shouldn't be expected to do such things just to stop themselves being harassed. 
---
The issue is not fully fixed by a delay and it is a significant detriment to the stream and the streamer, and also the sniper assuming they have ill intent are also winning because they got you to fuck your stream up due to their actions.
---
I personally prefer 99.89%
---
I'd give Ace his own tier as I have seen Ace players fit every survivor stereotype in existence.
---

"be my guest"

Bless me patter
---
NOED is unfun and unhealthy but it remains a lot of things in this game is unhealthy and unfun but they still exist
---
Looks about right.
---
Oh yeah, but this ain't anything new with the PS4 version. I've experienced it myself when playing on console, but I dont play seriously on it.
---
Would be the Tuesday after, if that was the case. But this DLC is there biggest yet. They’ll want to get it out ASAP. One week of testing will be enough.
---
You are blessed
---
You’ll never catch me krabs not when I go into MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE
---
Its funny because I was \*this close\* to getting him since Im new and wanted just one killer to focus on.
---
But then they revealed Demagorgon and let me buy BBQ+Chill so I see zero point.
---
The other item is a key btw.
---
This is the only game in existence wher people call playing normally "bullying" lmao
---
That would actually be amazing. His power could give you the exposed status effect if you sneak up on a survivor and give them a whopper.
---
I heard you talked with tru3 lol what did he say
---
This bothers me
---
Had similar issues on other games online so I made a new account. I mostly got BMed for being female and just got tired of it.
---
Bubba : I didn't tunnel the baby Dweet, I swear!
---
Ace: ***OBJECTION!***
---
Judge Entity : What is the meaning of this?
---
Ace : You see, the person who saved him had borrowed time equipped. The Dweet was affected by the Deep Wound status effect for almost 3 gens!
---
Judge Entity : I see... Well, if no one has any other evidence to go against this. Basement Bubba is-
---
~~GUILTY~~
---
**ENTITY DISPLEASED**
---
Everyone is talking about how close was to running out but no one is looking at the endgame timer with a few seconds left...
---
Nea
---
Shit
---
I want something nautical themed. Sunken and bloated sea captain or something
---
Nurse is forever going to be the most unfun killer in my book. She ignores core game mechanics, fuck that killer lol
---
Just joined/started playing DBD so it's great to know this sub is cool with fanart.
---
*BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE POSTING ALOT OF IT.*
---
Protect Steve’s phalanges
---
I remember getting 3 in the basement before which made me want to get all 4 at some point. 3 is enough for the achievement so I got it before
---
They dont even have to use the Until Dawn one, the Wendigo has plenty of history and lore as is that they could use without having to pay for any IP
---
*1 match has passes*
---
He specifically mentioned you by name and said you were a nerd.  His words not mine
---
You could always just not go in the basement.
---
Camping is a bad strategy, but that's why it's absurd to compare it to Survivor cheese, since cheese offers benefits and camping offers detriments.
---
Yeah, for camping a gen. You can camp things that aren't hooks.
---
That's the main problem. People still consider it slugging whether it's just attacking another person while you have momentum or when you risk Unbreakables out of spite.
---
I don't think it's ever wrong to tunnel. Tryhard, in some cases, but never ethically wrong.
---
I've gotten complaints about NOED before, and heard of a great many more, so I don't know about "majority."
---
It really feels like he has extra range
---
Whoops! Fixed that.
---
Super shitty man. My other friend was very into siege but it got to a point where guys would tk her because she's a girl. Happens a lot in that game actually like "oh gimme your attention or I'll tk you" kinda shit
---
Huh, looks like I’m gonna give hag a go
---
thanks! thats why they play ace
---
White ward is a cursed offering.
---
It summons Franklin's demise and a team of disconnects.
---
depends if that is what Netflix wants. I am pretty sure Netflix is in charge on this one

yup because every basement hook is because i was in the basement
---
It's still time not being spent on Gens. It may not seem like *much* time, but it's still time. When the two things that determine victory are the resources of Health/Hooks and Time, it's a bit of a hard sell, ya know?
---
Moris after the very first hook are gonna bother people, it ain't even that surprising that survivors get tilted from it lol
---
I for one enjoy making survivors lose rare items they thought they wouldn't.
---
**ENTITY DISPLEASED INTENSIFIES**
---
Yea we go way back hahaha
---
In addition to Broken and Exhaustion, there are a few other negative effects which are less often discussed.
---
Blindness, which prevents you from seeing auras.
---
Mangled, which increases how long it takes to be healed.
---
Haemorrhage, which causes you to bleed much more frequently when injured, making it easier for a killer to track you through your blood-pools.
---
Oblivious, a *new* status that will prevent survivors from hearing the terror radius (the heartbeat) when the killer is nearby.
---
Deep Wound, causes the survivor to enter the dying state unless they can mend their wound before the timer expires.
---
Exposed, causes the survivor to take double damage from attacks, so basic attacks will take you from healthy to dying immediately.
---
Hindered, slows the survivor's movement speed.
---
Cursed, indicates the presence of an active Hex perk.
---
PRETTY MUCH
---
Nice, and what’s that bar on top that shows up as soon as the doors open signify? I stopped playing around the shattered bloodline chapter and started playing again like last week
---
This. Your best bet is to try and get through the game screen in the beginning as fast as possible. It will still be kina loud but not a jet engine
---
He was playing doctor and got “genrushed.”. He spent all his time chasing a Laurie and passed by a generator with someone on it and complained about generators being too easy.  As doctor mind you.
---
Wait, you went to FDR with him?
---
Would the survivor be a prostitute?
---
Just have fun man. I notice when I try hard, I dislike playing killer. When I don't try, I do a lot better. Since I'm not anxiously making mistakes, and being more patient. 
---
I have more fun when I don't try too hard.
---
Membrane didnt get enough screentime IMO.
---
At least they can update his speedfeats on r/whowouldwin now.
---
Yeah thats my dawg from 20th
---
I fucking hope so. My sides.
---
Girl imma have to call you back
---
It probably will keep ticking down on the killer side, but rather than the survivor dying when it hits 0, theyll still be alive and struggling.
---
Bro you do realize one of the newest perks HEAVILY relies on lockers right? Anyone who runs Nancy will probably be using it to heal, having a marker and Insta-Down on anyone running it is good.
---
Heard he was 2A
---
I've played about 60 games today and I'm playing atm so I'd say about 100 games on a nice day
---
And here, I present to everyone: the type of person that made me think of this meme.
---
Yea boi tru32A
---
None of us have leveled up Claudette to level 30 I guess.
---
also my name don’t check out lol
---
Still have to down someone. Within the terror radius of a gen too. This won't happen easily at rank 1 without ruin.
---
Ah, maybe my memory  is just messed up, good play then!
---
Glad to hear it! Hope you're having fun
---
Imagine literally anyone reading this
---
Console seems so broken on this, see this a lot.
---
I kinda have fun when it's like that honestly, it's like a race to find the hatch before the killer finds it and closes it. I've had some real adrenaline rushes from these moments lol
---
Nothing to do the whole summer and they bring a grindy event when it's time to go to work again !
---
pretty good job so far.
---
i would say because it is very annoying to die in the first 4 mins of a game because of most just tunnel and first hook mori. I can understand why ppl do not like it
---
Ahhh. Classic Kenny
---
That’s ´cause he is much smaller than other killers, but they have exactly the same lunge
---
I understand 100%. I very badly wanted an original killer as well, and before, I was one of the ST haters. But after hearing about the positive game-changing perks, it changed my mind.
---
Yeah I've seen Tofu do it too. DS and head on is becoming a pretty common "stun build" right now
---
Trapper can't teleport, its also way easier to see his traps
---
But I've been where you are right now so I understand you, sometimes it is so frustrating
---
I reinstalled EAC and it works now.
---
I thought David’s were one tier lower
---
I meant from the standpoint of the killers not gonna purposely hinder themselves by avoiding the injured survivor, that’s the survivors fault for unhooking so close to the killer. I agree about the bum, but I definitely feel like some people will confuse looping and being overall good in chase for bm.
---
ima feng main and ive never been toxic and i havent insulted anybody (there have been 1 or 2 times when i got farmed or facecamped but it im sure everybody would be salty in these kind of situations)
---
Imagine that he has 1 of every item in the game common, rare, very rare, etc and if he gets another1 of the same item he immediately uses it
---
I've been playing since release I used to play 50+ hours a week but not so much the last couple years.
---
*Autistic Bubba Noises*
---
And then you realize it was actually just two brown medkits
---
You'll hit that 32k real soon, no doubt about it. It was about the same point you're at when I finally got one, If I can you can I promise lol
---
But luck only lets them kobe
---
Oh absolutely, I've been trying to play ghostface because I find him really fun but its pretty hard when the entity decides to give me shit perks
---
you cannot buy him with shards
---
F
---
Exsqueeze you, Nurse with pocketwatch and bookmark is my favorite build. Nearly vanilla Nurse is best Nurse.
---
Hag, nurse and sometimes freddy
---
they have a list of bannable offenses on their site. thankfully it only has to do with hacking-related stuff. different ppl have different ways of enjoying the game, so you just have to shrug it off when u meet someone who does something unlikeable
---
Huh. I could've swore you could. I remember being confused about it
---
A few hours every week adds up to about 10-15 hrs ,if even that. that's the amount that people that play this game regularly can get in a few days
---
I see a beautiful spot for bubba right next to basement time 
---
Also that is really good
---
Yeah you can tell by the roadmap itself that they are not only working on dlc killers and survivors but also on balancing the game and fixing big problems like tunneling and shit like that
---
I call it the christmas tree. Its the best feeling ever
---
just a heads up they are going to start punishing DCS when dedicated servers come out and they should come out when the stranger things DLC comes out
---
Umm isn't this a 50 cent song and not Drake's.....
---
No, you can’t. Licensed killers you need to buy, thus, why the splinters exist.
---
I was playing as Micheal on a Cold Wind farm map, got to tier two and chased someone into the killer shack, where I popped tier 3, I downed her and heard a chest in the basement, the other 3 were in the basement. 2 minute game where all died in the basement. :P
---
I would do it myself but I suck at drawing but, can anyone draw Trapper with the Demogorgon as if it was his pet? I had in mind this since the trailer, Trapper just finds the Demogorgon and puts a leash on him and he's all like "I found this puppy, I will take care of him and name it puppers" or something like that
---
Being honest, I just 100% thought of Samination trapper in this idea
---
Also please more art of the Demogorgon in Dbd, this is just great

All the licensed ones have, up till now. Originally ALL the DLC killers had one but they stopped doing it for their OC ones. GF is licensed though, so it's odd.
---
You look like a bad hag.
---
i do think rituals that u recently got (recieved/switched to another) are brown while after you exit and go back to rituals they grey
---
You look boring.
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I’ll definitely try to add him in. Thx bro
---
I may be wrong but I don’t think you can derank back to 19.
---
several maps have plenty of generators near the basement, that and there are 2 perks to aid you in carrying someone further.
---
Nobody is saying basement camping is op, it's just not fun for anyone in the match.
---
What planet do you live on? You’re so wrong 🤣 get out of here man
---
Non stop circle jerking when a toxic survivor gets their comeuppance, the same happens to a killer playing with his food and we get comments like this.
---
Sucks to have that happen as killer. Poor dude almost had the kill
---
Okay, you must not be a very high rank lmao
---
Play Deathgarden, they don't have the time to buttdance even if you're bad cause you always about to clap their ass
---
why.
---
can we make a locker queen cover together?
---
Big whoop.
---
what in the hell. that is pretty damn creepy lol
---
Ah El Generico. May he rest in peace
---
The next Cool Killers Club meeting is going to be quite something.
---
Do you even know what the fuck you’re talking about? You must still be a rank 20. Please leave.
---
yup. they both sure are black....
---
Or make his blind girlfriend a survivor but she is ya know, blind.
---
its butchering, so no
---
I’d easily pick some of these perks over “meta” perks. They’re boring. It gets repetitive only bringing the strongest perks and nothing else.
---
If you’re playing to win then keep picking the meta perks, but if you’re playing a video game to have fun (shocker!) then pick whatever u want.
---
How does cleansing dulls help your game if there isn't noed? You spend time to prevent nothing.
---
ya only cells im afraid
---
Imagine still calling DS crutch in 2019
---
Ah feck
---
That you are racist?
---
They hated JARAXXUS_EREDAR_LORD because he told them the truth
---
*"they uh, uh, Steve looks like Quentin boom argument over"*
---
* This image link is either dead, deleted or broken. Please resubmit with a better link.
---
You can do that, but it doesnt really help whe  she goes through walls lol
---
Let’s get some crutch perks
---
“Counterplay” doing totems don’t really help seeing how you can’t keep track
---
I’m not attracted to men either but daddy Myers is an exception 😍😍😍🍆🍆💦💦💦💦😖😩😩😩😩
---
Not even death is an escape.
---
Oh for sure, but how often is it just chance that you're the first one to be found a 2nd time unless they chase ya down from the hook?
---
Haven't played Killer in like 3 months, but I played a lot of Nurse and Trapper. Full builds, but Rank 20 because of how long I haven't played and how long it takes to pip.
---
Yeah, because it's totally like I forgot how to play Killer in 3 months and need to be versing the poor baby dweets.
---
yeah tis is big brain time.
---
How else do you play this game for hours without getting frustrated and go play something else?
---
omg skodkdpslsl
---
I'm saving iridescents to buy a new killer because I'm getting tired of the actual ones a bit, tho I'm a main survivor which I find it more amusing
---
The License killers have them, Black Splinter, Bone Splinter, Smoking Splinter and Glass Splinter. The rest jumpy can buy with shards.
---
BBQ in shrine.
---
Blood hunt next month.
---
Oh yeah. Its all coming together
---
Sure! Maybe behind freddy’s finger knives or somethin. Thx for the suggestion!
---
What would they name the splinter anyways?
---
This is every killer tbh
---
just spam the x button to start the game as soon as possible the fan will calm down. it is normal because for some unknown reason the startup on dbd has no fps cap and since it is just smoke and shit you can see the issue
---
Personally I find survivor less fun. Especially solo, but on the other hand playing killer makes me really anxious
---
You’re right. Shame on people for shouting out their favorite streamer on a cool technique they do.
---
Maybe I'm thinking about him being the first liscenced killer to have cosmetics
---
Background. Just played a wraith game and pretty easily took care of a SWF. Basically hook one and let bbq tell me where they were rinse and repeat. Post game I get this. Note I hate doing the gg ezy and get good stuff but I was honestly mad at that random fuck you
---
Oh my fuckin god, she fuckin dead.
---
Not necessarily. Since it's better to not have connections to the real one.
---
Wraith for me, cant stand him. Literally cant eacape from him cause he walks so Damn fast, no matter how many loops. He still catches you.
---
I'm not going to follow the same tired script of every NOED debate on this sub. Nobody will change their mind and it'll just be a big waste of time.
---
"Mmm, bait! Don't mind if I do..." - r/deadbydaylight
---
A good leatherface player scares me (mk)
---
Oh my god seriously? I just had the same exact problem in the boiler room area when they were up against the wall. That map is problematic
---
Yeah. I hate playing killer cause it's not really my thing. Plus I often get destroyed by good survivors. I pay no attention to the 4K, and i mainly feel satisfied hooking all survivors one time  as my goal. I also learn a lot by just practicing on good survivors even if they give me a hard time. I kinda hate how some survivors are too easy. So if someone gives me a good chase, I'll be glad if I can catch them. 
---
I don't take the killer side too seriously, since I'm mainly a survivor farming BP'S. If I play to anxious , I get destroyed. Each time a survivor taunts you. It's a mind game. Once they get u irritated you'll start making more mistakes being anxious to win. 
---
That's usually where the game goes downhill for me. As their taunts have tested my patience, and I'm now making a ton of mistakes while getting a bit upset. 
---
I haven't really had much of those games where playing killer makes me angry. As I'm more aware that the survivors are taunting me, to play with my feelings. I know better, and just enjoy myself, not letting it get to me. Overall I'm just more composed to think clearly, and maybe, maybe get lucky or outplay them.
---
I understand from most games that playing with anger only facilitates more mistakes. Stay composed, and have fun. You'll learn from those games, and with experience you'll naturally get good at the game.
---
I wanna see a futuristic killer something that uses super advanced tech to hunt survivors or a Medieval Knight
---
yea that's the thing, I always play survivor with a friend, if he's not online, I play killer but I'm not as good as survivor and whe I reach rank 9 or plus I get fistfucked by those bloody Clauds
---
They said something about them coming out on the nurse rework in September but no guarantees cause I heard about it on a stream
---
Literally just played one, got tunneled by pig, and immediately got off
---
