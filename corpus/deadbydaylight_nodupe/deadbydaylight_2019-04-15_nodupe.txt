That works too.
---
---
---
I can’t even get into a normal game as killer! What’s with the 30+ min wait? Is this across all platforms, because on Xbox it’s shit
---
Am I the only one who has a problem with Evan's ear? The inner ear is like a black hole for goodness sake.
---
For controller It’s hard to get right. I’d say make it a sensitivity where you can look all around you easily still, but in a way so you can move your camera slightly in prep for the 360, then quick while you’re doing the 360. Watch the PC 360 tutorials and just look at the speed they go at when they do it and try and get something like that coz that speed is perfect for console too. I have mine at max sense on DBD but I can 360 with keyboard and mouse too so it’s easier for me to figure out.
---
Hag, Spirit, and Legion can all use their powers in loops though, Hillbilly can't. In loops Hillbilly is just an M1 killer. In loops, Spirit, Hag, and Legion aren't forced to just M1, Hillbilly is.
---
1. I don’t see how your argument on the whole veteran and new players make any sense. In any video game- such as big sellers, you play with anyone. Regardless of rank. Now, if DS fixes it all, keep rank since people obviously care. I don’t think your point of new players and veterans is really your concern. I think you benefit self wise with rank. 
---

---
2. I’ve been on this game since release. I’ve seen downfall on this game. Whether it’s people quitting due to the incompetence of the devs, the rank, the wait, the bugs, the lies, etc, there has been downfall. You’re only looking at steam. Which isn’t the only place people play this game. 
---
3. You’re right. It wasn’t a multiplayer game, however you said they are a small company. So are a lot of people who product better games. BE is Canada’s largest video game developer. Like I said.. I love this game. Shockingly this game came into my life at a really dark time, and it helps with my anxiety. With that, I won’t say I have supported a lot of the choices in this game. Hence why I am still playing it. 
---
This can go on all day. Let’s agree to disagree. :)
---
I don't troll but I HAVE been face camped against baby killers for not rolling over and dying for them. I'm terrible at chases so I'm sorry if you can't catch me.
---
Dude, try 30+ minutes! I’m still waiting as I type this!!!
---
Charge 10k BP if you DC via the menu.
---
That literally will never work against a spirit with ears
---
A good number of others stick around as a vague form of insult, so some killers take it that way. You should play however you want to play, as long as you don't cheat. I would prefer all survivors leave as soon as they are physically able to, though.
---
Okay so after waiting until after rest, I am still having this problem... any idea why?
---
Don't post this here, you will offense the killers circle jerk. Only whining about survivors is allowed here.
---
ok lmfao once they pull the pallet early the loop is useless first of all, ds counters tunnelling and they can just slug u and ds is gone. Also youre making it seem like good killers simply dont exist. Like as soon as you queue in to a good swf its gg -1 pip you will never catch a single one and in 3 mins the exit is powered and all 4 escape. No swf is that good, not u or ur "god tier swf" that never loses to any killer ever
---
I don't disconnect because all it benefits is the killer. Sometimes I'm really tempted to disconnect but I know that the only people I will be hurting are those in the exact same situation as me. The only time I will disconnect is if the killer slugged me and the other survivor has a chance for the hatch.
---
They used clips from DBD around 5 times though I like how they stayed away from the licensed characters, because if they see Michael Myers in it they get the point of the game
---
It all comes down to personal preference honestly
---
It sucks in all forms of sound much like a black hole sucks in all form of matter. 
---
How else would he hear those immersed survivors rustling the grass?
---
Was asking personal preference of the community.
---
Yeah, I agree. If someone unhooks right in front of me, I'll go for the injured one. Also yeah, if they're dive bombing hooks, fine too.
---
But I'm talking about those butthurt killers who somehow perceive you as a 'toxic survivor' for daring to run away for longer than they want you to. Then they proceed to face camp you, nodding their head up and down furiously, until you die. Those are the kinds of killers who need a reality check. I see this happen all the time, and fellow survivors have done nothing except be good at looping.
---
Sure, camp the toxic little shits who teabag, flashlight click and point at every pallet. But simply trying to survive doesn't warrant it.
---
Facecamping, or just camping in general is a waste of the killer's time. But it is situational, as you mentioned if there's only 2 survivors left, or when you've noticed the team is very altruistic, like a survivor being unhooked mere moments after you leave the area. In those situations, take a look around nearby forms of cover.
---
A complete rework is fine by me, as long as they replace him with Robert Englund &amp; make his power [THIS PLEASE](https://horrorfreaknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1-Long-Arm-Freddy.jpg)
---
Go to u/jens56004 he has donne all the killers in the same style
---
I understand im not saying its impossible. Im just saying I was 100% sure I thought someone DCd and he had twitch in his name so I went to his stream to see why he was mad. And his stream showed him just getting booted mid chase as soon as the killer hit him once.
---
Insta death as in death on first hook. I think he did it to either give hatch to last person or cause he knew there was no chance both of them would survive.
---
Hag, legion and spirit all have different ways to close the gap or mindgame at loops. Ending a chase with a 115 killer without using your power is very difficult. Not to mention 110 killers without their power cant even mindgame a simple double pallet that spawns on macmillan.
---
And here I thought nurse was supposed to be the one with good hearing...
---
That's the Entity's bedroom &amp; it's trying to get some damn sleep, so KEEP OUT, KIDS  &gt;.&gt;
---
Whoa! You a cop bro?
---
Maybe they had to leave to go to the bathroom or something? That still weakness?
---
Still takes effort to check. I rarely look at profiles unless they’re either very cool or very uncool.
---
when you unironically think that's the way racism works; which even if true, there are tons of countries where white people aren't the majority of the population.
---
The greatest punishment for a face camper is the sound of the BING BING of two gens popping while they sit idly. (I just wish the survivors I play with realized that)
---
yeah i turned off vsync and capped my framerate to 70 and it never drops below 68 no matter what so the problem is solved yaay and the game also feels more fluid thanks to the lower input-lag i believe  
---
but i made some research and  people says Easy anti-cheat might get alarmed because of that  
---
do you have any info if i might get banned or not ?
---
Exactly you don’t see them enough, I’m rank 5-10 both sides usually I don’t have a whole lot of time to play with where I work
---
I’ll give u benefit of doubt. I’m still a bit skeptical as I am a killer main after all. Just a word of advice, Bodyblocking is probably one of the best ways to tilt a killer. That’s just my perspective on the matter
---
I like this idea, for example when my mate is running We'll make it and gets his unhook stolen by some random. Thats annoying
---
How dare u play nurse
---
Are you seriously comparing T-bagging to nazism? lol... wont even bother discusing with someone THAT smart
---
Yup, the game started with 3 survivors and 5 gens, the game was super laggy.
---
I am also a killer main, and body blocking does not tilt me whatsoever
---
I don't see them because people know they aren't viable against a good SWF. Obviously it's possible to get a 4k with every killer, but by and large you will not win against good survivors who know what they're doing unless you're using a top tier killer or Legion.
---
This image is pretty brutal
---
That's why i'm saying reserve bans for serious toxic behavior like game chat harassment and cheats/exploits.
---
but minor offenses like body blocking or working with the killer or accidental or non d/c's shouldn't be so extreme when those behaviors can be conditioned in a game jail.
---
and for people with unstable connection, i don't think its just "some" people, there's a lot of people that don't have the best internet and punishing them to the extreme extent of bans is just unfair.
---
That's my signature move
---
r/flarecheckout?
---
Wow, you're insanely lucky. I've only played 200 hours and nearly 70% of matches is Survivors calling the Killer out for just playing the game or having NOED despite getting all killed with 4 gens left. It is undoubtedly the most toxic community I've ever seen.
---
Survivors made the world this way.
---
U r a rare specimen to behold!
---
I did it over a month ago and have played over 100 games. No problems. Most games come with that as a setting so idk why it would be
---
Backrevving is a good way to end the chase faster if you catch someone out in the open (and against more expirianced survivors that almost never happens). At a loop billy has very few options. I guess there's also curving but quoting quixoticgreen a 2000 something hour billy main.
---
&gt;An average player cant curve consistently enough to consider it when nerfing billy

If you see a game startin with only 3 survivors in a lobby there is a second killer in the lobby. The game is insanely buggy the last week.
---
Because it’s what you signed up for when you hit the ready button and joined the trial...
---
It’s literally a couple minutes, you’ll live.  It’s a playstyle to slug, accept it or not
---
That’s like saying, “if the killer has a slug build to win the game, and he gets 3 of us slugged in the first 5 minutes of a match, I DC... 
---
No, that’s lame
---
It’s a Peace Lily! Nigh impossible to kill
---
yeah i feel like they should add that to the settings  
---
i really don't like vsync in any game as it makes it feel kinda weird/delayed  
---
and suprisingly i didn't saw any tearing even without vsync   
---
which makes vsync even more pointless
---
Honestly I would rather have legion removed than freddy reworked

---
Here's a few tips. If they call you a baby killer, call them the babies. Because they sure do fucking whine like them. If they call you trash even despite 4k or 3k, say that "this piece of trash just beat your ass". And finally. Lock your DMs to friends only if you are on PS4 lol
---
Then clearly you have been luck but now it has run out.
---
The only time I ever died was in the middle of a mori animation within like 1 minute into the match and I thought. Well I'm not getting any points might as well give them the quitter bonus
---
Acceleration does nothing atm. Save them.
---
Absolutely nowhere near what DS was. One free insta-escape per survivor on their first chase, plus it gave almost 30 seconds worth of distance the killer had to make up before you even needed a window or pallet. Mettle usually just gives a couple more loops wherever the survivor is hit, and only triggers mid-late game.
---
Mettle is strong, but the difference in strength between it and the OG Decisive is similar to the difference between a rowboat and an aircraft carrier.
---
Honestly sounds like a match I was in earlier, I was Bill and got tunneled as soon as I saved one person... wasn’t even the obsession
---
Settings on your TV and ingame can fix you brightness problem. The other problem is one I have no solution for.
---
You don't get it do you?
---
My idea for the corn situation is to make the corn shorter rather than remove it.
---
Essentially It would let killers see just fine and also act as a way for survivors to hide in but at the same time they can't hide in it without crouching so they can't rush through without risk of being seen
---
Lmfao, does that actually work?
---
Can't you just quit the game or do they still get points if you do that?
---
 Lmao but it's for that Nea that gen taps that final gen literally infront of your eyes, just to Mori her immediately after, so fucking good
---
Meg needs to lose some wrinkles
---
Ah, the weekly post pretending self care is bad. Lovely.
---
Here’s what I do. I see that they’re at the gate but I act like I didn’t see them and run to the other exit gate. Or toward it anyway. Then I just find a spot on the map to just chill. Then I go do things I need done around the house. I’ll take my dog out. Unload the dishwasher. Brush my teeth. Etc. You get the idea. Then after I’ve done all that I return. If they are still there (usually about 20 minutes later) then I’ll just open up my laptop and do whatever on it. It’s an extreme rarity that they’re not gone by the time I’m back though. A few times I’ve had them leave right when I get back and I’m like perfect. Very rarely I’ll have to play on my laptop for a few minutes then leave. Always ensure they waste their own time and not yours.
---
Also if you were wondering, the killer was a legion.
---
throw on Thrill of the Hunt and it's a party
---
I knew where it was but i did forget it for a few secs. I think you can even see my struggles trying to figure out where it was in the video
---
Make a perk that forces survivors to leave after entering the exit gate for 2 seconds
---
Yes had it last night and my wife had it earlier today while I’m a game.
---
A unique case that was caused by apartheid. Not saying it’s right,but the oppression of whites there seems to be a result of years of them having power despite being the minority. That’s completely different from races that have never had power and are oppressed due to their skin color.

Wraith best killer

Person who won't disclose their race here for no reason except to say, being a certain race doesn't change how stupid this whole argument it.

I remember how disappointed we all were in Overwatch when they nerfed crouch speed, it was the end of a teabagging age.
---
Wow. A butt hurt, faggy, fan boy, dick riding dev boi. The devs have literally banned top youtubers for no reason at all. People that have played 5K plus hours for no reason. When people have told the devs about issues they have banned those people immediately on a twitch live stream and have told people that criticize the game to “stop playing our game.” Those are shitty devs. But a dick riding, cum guzzling, fuck boi that will always eat shit. Well... I’m not surprised. It’s also hilarious that you were hurt and personally attacked from my comment. You should take a walk fat ass.
---
That sounds really cool but I think the devs map designers need to be fired, don’t get me wrong they make nice maps it’s just they have no idea of balance, get someone who knows balance. Y’know?
---
Yes it is... because you give the killer a little more time
---
It’s apart of the game...
---
You’re not entitled to a free hatch, friend or not. That’s why it’s possible to slug and go for that 4K...  then it becomes a game of hide and seek for 4 minutes (which usually is already much lower by that point) 
---
This is the exact same as a slugging killer from the start. It’s still as you describe... but wait, that’s ok? No, you just think you’re entitled to the hatch at the end for free even though the killer still had a chance to capture them.
---
Xbox messaging: set to friends only. It's a whole new game, congratulations tho I literally got my first hate message my first ever game cuz I camped hard cuz I was so new.

Guess what, singular they is grammatically correct and has been for centuries: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they, https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they.
---
Don't lecture me about giving a shit about 'enhancing' gender dysphoria or 'the mental illness'. If you did, you would respect the wishes of those who request they, or other pronouns. Non-binary genders have existed for as long as humans have been around, they aren't new.
---
Haven't had much fun with the game lately considering most of the time it consist of camping, tunnelling killers.
---
One of the few exception was this Nurse. This was a good nurse on console, considering how hard it is to play her there. I like that there is a challenge in trying to dodge her but on her end I understand it must be difficult as well. 
---
All in all I found the match to be tense but fun, especially towards the end. Which is sadly a rarity these days.
---
True. Standing there for one hit is one thing. Standing there and spamming that fucking light is a whole other thing.
---
literally same situation as you but with myers
---
At the very least, the killer can get some sacrifice points. There's no way to punish people if they just kill themselves in the game just to leave but at the very least it will waste some time for the other survivors to do stuff.
---
Me and my brother did the same with part streamers... we encountered a huntress with iridescent axe heads, an infantry belt and a ebony morri.
---
They make you play as a perkless Freddy. It's the worst add-on in the game.
---
Lol
---
Dude ty! This is very helpful
---
That's crazy.
---
&gt; Idk why Self Care gets so much hate. 
---
Because it's very commonly used and considered good by many, people think they are innovative geniuses for saying it sucks

I can if you want

Someone tried doing this to me earlier with thicc I mean jane while I was using myers..Except I don't think she realized my tier 3 was about to be activated so I quickly stalked and ended that bodacious latina
---
His power allows him to stall the game more than any killer in the game, on top of that the aura reading allows him  to see how the game is evolving and act accordingly  which helps him waste the survivors time while not wasting time himself.
---
The aura reading also allows him to leave his victims at almost any time and come back for them when ever he wants to.
---
He can also get an easy first hit almost every time he encounters an awake survivor.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So in short he has the best vision on what the survivors are doing combined with the ability to slow them down immensely if he makes the right decisions, which are easier to make since he knows what they are doing.
---
On top of that he can get an easy first hit do, other things while the survivor is trying to wake up and when they wake up come back again and get the last hit which will down them.
---
Of course if you are just going to play him as the wraith walking up to people, smacking them and try to down them after wasting time on loops you will not get results.
---
He forces players to make decisions other killers can not make and really gets rewarded for making the right ones and gets punished when he makes a bad decision
---
While you do not need much mechanical skill the dreamtransition mindgames and the decisions he needs to make makes him a killer an high skill high reward killer.
---
He is more than just an m1 killer.
---
People should not take the memes seriously.
---
As an exclusive killer, I make a concerted effort to punish shitty teammates. Don’t ruin the spirit of the game because you wanna get greedy with the bloodpoints 😡
---
And whenever he’s wounded because holy fuck he’s loud
---
Jake and David sure have interesting fashion choices. Those shoes look expensive.

Good troll lmao, that’ll get some people’s gears going

---
They hated Jesus because he spoke the truth
---
Lmao bro you do understand that you have been playing against noobs most likely, if you are rank 15 and you are playing against nurses you are playing against baby nurses. If you check most lists of best to worst killers freddy is almost always on the bottom. 
---
Not trying to be an ass but literally just watch a few vids on freddy and learn how to counter that shit, it isn’t impossible and it is not some crazy difficult task.
---
Also you might think you are a god but just wait until you get close to the level 1-5 area.
---
yes, you are certainly a rank 15.
---
Have you considered just fucking leaving?
---
Difference against Freddy is that you basically cant really stealth against him. You HAVE to get good at being chased. That means you need camera control, map knowledge and have to know how to loop properly. These things will come with time and the more you play, the easier Freddy will get
---
So if the killer puts me on the hook, and I suicide, it's fine that the hatch opens according to you, but if I leave I've committed some cardinal sin because now the remaining survivor might get the hatch?
---
Eeyup
---
No. Thats just a overrated sentence. Self-Care is one of the best perks if not the best, for non swf players
---
Being punk means being a punk so I only half agree with you. So being punk is literally implying that you rebel. Using "punk" as a style of clothing is literally being a poser.

Please, just leave

You had her to close when you put it on I think

Therefore Unbrakable isn't good right? Unbreakable wouldn't work if you are instantly hooked.
---
Had a legion body block the basement stairs as he camped a random. Why is it when I try to body block the basement as a survivor they can walk around me but I cant walk around them?? 
---
 He then did the same thing to my friend on the house with stilts in grim pantry. He blocked the stairs and I couldnt get her. I think this game is bullshit and very very killer sided anymore. Like how in the fuck is that even remotely fair?  We all reported him but doubt it will do anything.
---
You clearly don't know how it works. They prevented scummy people from doing that, and good thing, too.
---
Can’t wait

Cute.

This is 100% bringing race into this for no reason.

Tell me how race matters to this joke. You could have just said "moms".

Are you really this much of a NPC?

Ah yes, only white moms can say bringing race into this is unnecessary...
---
Sure, Jan.
---
That doesn't sound like he was being toxic on purpose. Just sounds like hes new to the game and doesn't know better. "  I gave him a cheeky, lengthy teabag before escaping last through the gates " 
---
You just admitted to being part of the problem... Even if he was toxic you were not the better person, you're spreading toxicity back and being just as bad.
---
The implementation of the change is not worth the effect and the drawbacks.
---
Any killer will generate a ton of points if you are good at them. Doc isn't any different than the rest.
---
As a Freddy main on lower ranks, people who know how to loop or have teammates that can distract me while I'm trying to get you will get away. Also break out of the dream world asap if you do get away. If you are out of Freddy's terror radius, you can be seen from across map and they will come after you.
---
Read map or wiggle... both mostly useless in this situation
---
Oh no, a college student.
---
The world that contains Africa, of course. Where "white" people are a minority and "black" people are a majority, government plus president is racist, president pubically sung a anti-white song, genocides aimed at white people happened only a few years ago...

America is not the only country in the world, Karen.

Reading comprehension wasn't your strong suit huh

Incorrect, there are records of 'third' genders across the globe in countless cultures. One example is the two spirit identity that has been identified in many Native American cultures.
---
Being trans isn't a mental illness, and coming out and starting my hormones has only improved my life.
---
Both DC at the same time
---
I can't wrap my head around the fact that the devs keep breaking sound which is a CORE FUCKING MECHANIC TO THE GAMEPLAY. Like if they test the patch and the sound is fucked, Don't push the patch out fix it. I would rather wait longer for a working game then get a broken one with some other new changes.
---
get tunneled for 5 minutes.
---
0 gens done.
---
Freddy's a stall killer, that's not a bad thing. The problem with his stall being RNG, however, is. Hopefully these changes are good for him.
---
What?
---
#I’ve been chased for 5 mins for absolutely nothing.
---
Dress up as spirit
---
The difference is the hatch instant opens on a DC whereas you need to wait for the entity to finish on a hook (suicide or not). I'd the killer knows where the hatch is, he has a couple seconds to get to a camper.thats just how the game is designed.
---
I'm at 2200 hours and I still can't so don't act like you're tough shit cuz of your time played
---
"Apartheid"???
---
Years of them HAVING POWER IN AFRICA? Since when, NPC?
---
And white people are facing government level oppression based solely on the color of their skin.
---
Ergo, by your own twisted definitions, it is racism. As a result, your entire ideology falls apart because it assumes white people = oppressor/bad guys/always bad and black people = oppressed/poor innocent victims/can never do wrong, even when a anti-white hate crime is committed and nobody will say it was racism despite the culprits saying as such/always the victims, even in other countries
---
Get your head out of your rear end.
---
A perk that unlocks the option to heal at any time makes it great. You’re thinking about the perfect game of never getting hit so why waste the slot? But to the average player who is getting wrecked by Freddy because he is invisible it’s a godsend. Stop talking out of your ass.
---
Maybe someday I'll get to give props for that exact reason...
---
Until then, I'll continue being a crop for my teammates.
---
Just one buff in the right direction. No need for a big one.
---
It'll probably be just nerfs though.
---
Read a book, I don’t have time to educate you. You’re not going to convince me that white people are victims.
---
I see... interesting stance.
---
But they won't listen to me anyways, since this is a unpopular opinion. No need for worry. ;)
---
As a survivor main, I believe they should give totems a spawn point in the basement to incentivize survivors going there besides just a chest
---
I'd rather bring a medkit and have an extra perk slot.
---
That's $2
---
This post is labeled "Looking for advice" instead of "Shitpost"
---
And as for your "sources", we both know Wikipedia is the first place your college professor *not* to cite. And your other link is only referring to proper use of the word "they" in context of unknown gender, and it still must follow proper sentence structure. In the context you're referring to, the article itself says that this is a new use for the word. Now, I could go into the details as to why the use of it in the way you're suggesting is still not proper if you'd like. This is something I actually know about and have credentials for. I studied under one of they most harsh and hardcore English professors I've met, Professor Tina Blue out of KU.
---
Because they don't want you to get the points. Survivors are the true servants of the entity, they're the real monsters.
---
Selfcare users annoy the fuck outta me.. they act like they cant do shit until they're fully healed. Dude get on a gen. Bring a med kit. Although when I'm a killer I love stupid healing constantly survivors they arent doing gens and i see them with my OP nurses calling.  I dropped self care when they nerfed it back in November and havent used it sense. Such a waste of time.
---
I think Ace’s yellow outfits are pretty good, especially the head with the beard.

I believe what they're trying to say is he's not all he's talked up to be. When does that Cry Baby perk come out though? Lmao.

Doesn't mean it can't be interpreted as a insult without prior knowledge. It CAN be read like that.
---
I have also never seen this before until now, and I've been checking the comment sections.
---
Well, perhaps people shouldn't use comments that can very well be read as a insult then. If I asked others who didn't know what this was either, it could be read as a personal attack. That's all.
---
No consequence? You sort of missed the point. We are referring to doing things in the game that convey a bad attitude and unsportmanship. Teabagging is innappropriate and hitting survivors while they're on a hook is also. One of your points is "It's infuriating for the killer." You don't think that it's infuriating for a survivor when you do that? You're CLEARLY biased.
---
Also, there is a consequence. Doing things like that can get you RIGHTFULLY reported. There's literally an option for it when you try to report someone. So while you're sitting here thinking it's just fine, don't be surprised when someone reports you for that and you get reprimanded. You know it's not cool to do that. You're just biased.
---
"Read a book" Ah yes, the excuse everyone uses when they can't prove their claims.
---
And absolutely ironic that you tell me to read a book when you are completely oblivious to oppression white people have experienced over the centuries.
---
You obviously live in America. They don't teach oppression whites have experienced in American History.
---
YOU need to read a book, Becky.
---
Wdym the Chapel is amazing even without Balanced. You also just used my argument that the map is good without Balanced. The house on preschool is literally just a better Haddonfield house, and Ormond is just as good maybe even better than Dwelling, Ward, and Haddonfield houses, so you could easily make the same argument that it's "anal for killers anyways".
---
Your statement can be read two different ways.
---
And you're wrong, it's just moms. Not "white moms".
---
Maybe you mean "Christian moms" instead? That matches the "video games cause violence" ignorance in the older decades.
---
I'd love to see that sort of thing be a separate game mode like Big Team Battle in Halo. The game could be like 3 times the size (3 killers, 12 Survivors, etc.) and have different maps. It would also give killers the chance to communicate and use their own teamwork--in fact encouraging it--which really wouldn't hurt.
---
No I mean just white moms
---
Because they suck and dont wanna work for kills.
---
Nice flair lol
---
Why is this downvoted?
---
If he was 110 he would be absolute garbage. The other slower killers have a way to end a chase, Billy may move fast across the map but if he was 110 he would never be able to end a chase. He slows down when charging the chainsaw and he has to charge it for a while then he needs a clear straight line to get to the survivor. being 115 is the only thing that allows him to get right behind a survivor and get the chainsaw hit.
---
Repeat offenders should have the character they dced with get reset entirely.
---
Yeah I hate reading the map
---
I was wondering too, body blocking isn't the first thing to come to mind when i hear the term sandbaging and seeing as there is already a term for it i wonder how we ended up calling it sandbaging.
---
Its like getting flipped off. Or your brother being killed by genocide by few lines
---
When once person DCs I assume and following DCs are just because they dont want to deal with a 3 player survivors team which is fair enough. The whole game being ruined is all on the first survivor to DC
---
Keep going about how many perks I need to equip to counter **items** that are brought into a trial, and then tell me about what perks i also need accommodate my build for.  Bloodlust stops stacking when you're forced to break pallets, and if you dont need to break a pallet to catch a survivor then theres no need to wait for bloodlust, since it's unsafe.  It's either completely safe or it's unsafe, no inbetween that Bloodlust can fix
---
Nobody is complaining about killer perks other than noed right now, which has been happening for months, whereas the killers have moved from DS where they got their way onto andrenaline and MoM
---
This. I say this to myself every time, really gets me in the mood.
---
Well, you're wrong. It's moms, not just white moms.
---
You gonna keep repeating yourself despite me understanding what you're saying now and responding to you as such?
---
Sure, I mean it's funny as shit, but don't kill the survivors unless they're in on it.
---
Idea: Make an add-on that makes the traps start ticking once the player if off the hook. She needs better add-ons anyway...
---
I was on a generator in a corn field earlier with 2 others and I was waiting for my spine chill as we hadn’t seen the killer yet. Well I space out, then look around wondering where everyone went, turn around to Myers literally towering behind me lol
---
If you sit and wait for him to chase - isn't it buying time for the other survs do gens while you distract him?
---
Or am I missing something - he can't go t3, soooo hes not attacking you, so hes just sitting and...waiting?
---
If he is actually sitting there waiting for you (like a bad player I might add) then it is good for you to sit there.
---
I’m talking about if you don’t know if he is there.
---
i just got wooooshed
---
Pls no put me on that subreddit.  It’s boring and sucks
---
I personally don't think ebony mori should be in the game and iri heads are just insanely too strong, but also survivors get insta heals and super fast tool boxes. I don't imagine that this is "Every game" build, Just when he really want to put the survivors in the dirt for a day.
---
Keep bitching about something that’s making the game harder for you so can’t get easy games. I love playing killer it’s the most enjoyable time I’ve had. But I’ve never heard anyone bitch about perks and things that the developers implemented to give the survivors a chance as much as you are. You are literally complaining and bitching because the survivors can put play you with their perk builds. Yet killers have some of the most broken perks ever. BBQ, NOED,Nurses,Ruin,huntress,devour hope, rancor
---
Oh lawdy no don't do it to them have mercy
---
Ok
---
Are you going to wiggle that ass or not?
---
Definitely, but this is bhvr they're about as incompetent as it gets. Its a real shame too because its an amazing game concept. If a studio like cd projekt red got ahold of this title it would be sooooooooo much better in every aspect. Sadly most people are complacent and just keep buying up the garbage they keep putting out in terms of microtransactions. I don't get how lowering the music volume to something reasonable is so fucking difficult.
---
I’d say since this has been highly requested that if they make a dead by daylight 2 they’ll make that happen with some kind of 4th overlay slot or something. That way they can do more then just blood like covered in vomit, entity corruption, mud, etc. like what I mean is now we have head, body and legs so I think it would be cool for a 4th slot called ‘overlay’ or something. But yeah the devs already said it would take too much work atm for what they have going in dead by daylight right now. So dbd2 let’s hope.
---
Exhaustion hatchets are the devil!
---
I appreciate the thought
---
Or just liking the clothing style. You can like how something looks and want to wear it, that doesn't affect who you are as a person and doesn't mean you are pretending to be something you aren't.
---
Especially if you see someone else get hit. As soon as I see someone else get injured I take off into a full-on sprint
---
Just played a round of hag, 4K and they did 3 gens. I got 4 Iridescent and 30kbp and 2 pipped. I still dont really like the emblem point system but eh
---
I LITERALLY JUST WATCHRD THIS XD!
---
Liking the style and wearing it is one thing. Like the style and pretending to be one is completely different. It's like comparing cosplayers who just like the character vs someone roleplaying. Similar concepts but completely different in their intentions.
---
This is SO great!
---
It could potentially allow the unhooked to get away with that extra 2 seconds of survivability, which makes hook rushing actually viable instead of an asshole move.
---
I'm just upset that he says $100 while handing her two $1 bills...
---
/r/cursedimages
---
Oh just to make this clear I never disconnect. I want to get the blood points from the match. Sometimes I would kill myself faster on hook if I see no hope for us but that’s about it. Just making sure you don’t think I’m bias or whatever.
---
I’m sorry I don’t understand your perfect word argument, however I do agree camping is a legit strategy. There are many situations why camping would be a legit good thing to do. It’s unmoral because the poor sucker has to either wait or kill him self/DC but then again “killers job is to not let you escape”. 
---
I don’t know why both survivors and killers make false rules and then get mad when neither of the party follows them. Listen, the killers job is to not let you escape and the survivors job is to escape. Anything is fair game imo as long as there are no hacking or cheating at all.
---
There is zero counterplay to Legion. He ignores pallets and vaults as fast as a survivor. These are game mechanics put in place so a 100% speed survivor can have a chance to extend a chase against a 110-115% killer.
---
People will bring up nurse, but nurse takes skill to land a hit. Legion just spams frenzy which takes no skill. Nurse is punished for missing, Legion is not. If you do manage to lose a Legion in a chase, you won't get far with the mend timer and if he catches you mending you just die.
---
Don't even get me started on the add-ons.
---
Honestly, I’m gonna start doing this when I saw 2 or more survivors T-bagging at the exit gate. If they are that desperate to teabag, they might as well wait a decade
---
That’s true however it’s mostly likely always is.
---
"I'm rank 15" 
---
I don't mean to be rude but really dude? When you're that new please just ask how to counter, don't say there isn't any, he's not legion
---
I'd certainly hope you would if you're as committed as you are to your cause. And you haven't really provided any evidence beyond your own opinion that you do indeed 'know better'. The truth is, no research exists. You know literally as much as I do. I'm simply not willing to jump off this metaphorical cliff without looking first. Until research on non-binary lifestyles is completed to a reasonable degree, it will forever remain in the realm of progressive trend and ideological propaganda. As an older gay man, I can tell you that it's a hell of an uphill climb into acceptance. You're going to have to step up and prove your case just like we did. You'll have to prove in the arena of both science and ethics what you state is in fact truth. And when/if that day should come, I'll be happy to acknowledge and support it. For us, it took proving the biological connection to homosexuality and proving that homosexuality isn't amoral through ethical discourse. If you want to be taken as seriously, you'll have to present similar evidence.
---
Yup literally anyone who says Ez is frustrated behind their controllers otherwise they'd just move on to the next match like everyone else. It's like a psychological thing to vent their steam lol
---
It's especially funny when the killer says "EZ" and immediately disconnects. Congratulations?
---
I always that noed though so whatever.
---
I dont get pigs that go after the trapped people. This person is wasting a good time to remove the trap on his head why not chase someone else who could be on a generator?
---
Sadly, this is an exploit. People are doing it on purpose for the laugh of it.
---
It ain't funny when it happens to someone else though.
---
Or maybe, just hear me out, maybe we can not be douchebags, and set the expectations higher?  I know that's asking a lot from people, but maybe not having our default being taunting assholes?
---
If you are tank 15, then I hope you realize that you are going against noobs. Not trying to be rude or anything but just saying
---
That’s aids
---
You know I had to do it to em
---
Look, can't I post something fun without you know-it-alls delegating things I already know? I'm not promoting my YT and TTV. This is sharing a fun moment. Geez!

She looks kinda sad in the left one. Did she lost her balloon? :(

Roxxy Andrews, I think about her all the time, especially in the morning... at the bus stop.
---
Exactly
---
Someone had fun ;)
---
Your opponent has left the match
---
But have you considered the free bp?
---
I've seen just as many survivors complaining about BBQ and Ruin as I've seen killers complain about MoM and Adrenaline.
---
Wait, I have pig. Should I teabag them back?
---
So you're that swf team.
---
Omfg!! You explained me as a P3 Kate lol
---
That's just contradicting themselves wtf
---
quality post. thank you for your service.
---
There is definitely a link between media and violence. I used to be dogmatic about opposing this mindset but study after study shows even just something like Fox News can warp people's perception of reality and their behavior towards others.
---
you tunneled him. But thats what you were supposed to do.
---
So Freddy die nothing wrong, the survivors brought it upon themselves
---
Play as billy, stand slightly away from the exit gate and rev your chainsaw.
---
Stupid survivors will inch further and further from the exit line. Fill up your bar and down them. Suddenly they realize their too far away to crawl out in time.
---
Works 7/10 times, much better than you’d expect.
---
You shouldn't worry about things like that. Your objective is to get BP and win the game. You didn't tunnel anyone, and even if you did tunneling is incredibly effective to get a person out early in the game if they're a weak link and caught in bad places easily. Just like how some survivors are awesome at knowing the best loops and when to throw a pallet. Sometimes both can be annoying but very effective.
---
High ping? I would’ve dodged that lobby.
---
[removed]
---
that works too lol
---
Each time you prestige there is a greater chance to get better items/add-ons
---
FUCKING SAME. I was high as shit and I was so freaked out, I thought I was hearing voices.
---
If you're past the pillars in the exit gate, the trap won't trigger, next time just walk out the gate and chase them down from there
---
Little Ashy Slashy. No matter what the circumstances he's always has that goofy smile when the Entity comes to devour me!
---
Nah, you got downed way too fast.
---
Padded Jaws add on. They don't injure in exchange for more points for the Trapper
---
Well they gave me a bunch of crap for it like I should just back off and let them do it. I got called a garbage killer for getting a 4k as Freddy by punishing them for that mistake.
---
A game earlier today in The Game map. I pass the stairs and see Myers go after Claudette on the first floor. I move along on the top floor only to turn and see him walking with purpose towards me. Scared me shitless. I actually screamed and froze on keyboard. Just let him nab me. It was amazing. Great scare.
---
I had a piggy that had devour hope and she camped a trapped survivor. I don't understand some people lol
---
So true, I remember this one pig who realized we got like 4 deadzones on groaning and she ended up letting us go, but at one point we made a conga line as she lead us as we all crouched around the map haha funniest thing ever xD
---
Freddy isn’t nearly as bad as people make him out to be. He has the same effect as Nurse. In bad hands laughable and good hands surprisingly good. Obviously no where near Nurse but just meaning it’s one way or the other.
---
Hell yeah I love bullying baby killers, oh wait that doesnt take skill lol
---
hahahaha Pigs teabag is HYSTERICAL. they never expect it. so when I give it back to them once they're on the hook, I know they're seething lol
---
You're both acting like toxic players.  Doesn't matter what 'side' you play, you're just normalizing being a dick.  Don't be a dick, and you won't be called toxic.
---
Does every Claudette use urban evasion and self care
---
This happens too often anymore. Good luck in a chase. I think the game has had so much new content in a short amount of time they need to just cool it and fix all the new problems like this
---
git gud
---
Maybe, I was at a consistent 93 ms in the lobby.
---
Toxic. Glad when these people get what’s coming to them
---
This. I thought getting 4k was always fun. NOPE, turns out if they are really bad, and getting that 4K is really easy, you just don't enjoy it at all.
---
Thanks
---
I dont think you can patch back the fear. Any game when you learn enough about it will stop being scary. Once you learn it beyond the basic aesthetic level and start understanding optimal strategies and exploits it's no longer an experience, it's just a game.
---
bruh
---
Using NPC as an insult, I see where you come from now

---
Yup, I've got over 3k hours and SC is just bad.  A lot of killers have an instadown so you being at full health hardly matters any ways.  And yeah, the time it takes to heal yourself you could have knocked out a gen with a teammate, or literally anything else.  It USED to be a meta pick, but you're definitely not top tier if you think it's viable now.
---
they also denied doing it on purpouse and said they dident know what happend (the killers)
---
Interesting. I think Humming Brackets should just provide a flat 50% regression threshold. You install it and then you know--no matter what--that gen isn't going below 50%. That way if the gen is in a hot zone and you need to keep circling back to it, there's assurance you won't have to start all over again (been there, done that). This way killers can kick the gen and feel like they did their job while providing a safety net of sorts to survivors. Maybe the percentage can go as high as 70%, but I wouldn't make it higher. Maybe make the installation window between 50%-70% and whenever the add-on is installed that's the percentage it sticks at. There's no point in installing it at a lower completion rate but it feels a little OP higher than 70%. There should always be some risk in completing a gen, especially in a hot zone.
---
As for Bloodstained Battery, I'm not sure I understand how that would be useful. Why would you transfer all progress from one gen to another?  I mean, I get trying to avoid the 3 gen patrol, but you're not really gaining anything and risking a lot with the Broken status. What if the battery slowly charged as you worked on a gen and then 50% of gen progress after the point of installation could be transferred to a new gen? Essentially, it's a Brand New Part that has to be charged up first. So maybe the survivor still suffers Broken status for 60 seconds but the battery itself remains charged for the remainder of the match (use it or lose it). So there's still some risk involved but you don't necessarily have to rush to a critical gen right away. OR, the battery stays in the toolbox (so to speak) and can be charged over multiple generators before being installed. So half of whatever progress you make over any number of generators will be added to the battery and it'll fill up to a max capacity of 100% power for a cold gen. Only when the add-on is installed would the Broken status effect begin. So essentially you'd have to repair 2 full gens to charge the battery to max and insta-complete another gen (but it could be installed earlier if desired).
---
I think you've landed on some cool ideas either way. Good job.
---
As a Hag main:
---
Hags with Black Hag skin: 100% chance of m&amp;a. Will almost grab you off a gen if you aren't paying enough attention.
---
Reddit is just harder on women gamers in general. I mean Reddit loves noob3 and I swear I couldn't go 2 minutes today without hearing him whine about how bad/boosted/dumb the killers he was facing were. Eventually had to turn it off and am likely to stop watching in the future if that continues. Jen isn't remotely that bad (at least that I've seen) and still people here act like she's Hitler incarnate.
---
Thaaaank you. I think this perk is so overrated. The builds you can run with an extra perk slot when you stop thinking this perk is necessary are incredible
---
Idk if he knows how to do that. Based on his lore he seems like he like catches small animals and eats them raw and alive lol. Pure animal in the form of a man.
---
**Mending**
---
**[||||                       ]**
---
She's only an ensign
---
And this is why DS needed a rework.
---
Ik that any new content will have bugs, I said that -_-
---
I'm not "asking" them anything, and I never once said they have to completely stop making new content. HOWEVER it would be NICE if they slowed down with the new content in order for the bug team to actually get rid of the bigger bugs. 
---
Honestly idk why ur saying "maybe" and "minor bugs". U call infinite wiggle bar minor? U call multiple killer lobbies minor? I'd hate to see what u consider major. And for your information me and my friend play from 5pm to 10pm that's 5 hours worth, and we both get a wiggle bar bug at LEAST twice a day for each of us. That often for just two ppl in that time frame. 
---
Also if they were fixed in two weeks tops then wouldn't the wiggle bar bug have already been fixed considering it was there when Plague was released? Plus there's countless other bugs like infinite load screen and blood points/level loss that's been around for a long time, so that statement about "2 weeks" def isn't true.
---
As for that "dumb" statement, if ur gonna resort to calling names or using demeaning language then I'd appreciate it if u would stay clear of my posts and comments, that is rude and uncalled for.
---
Then it turns out to be Haunted Grounds and the survivor who is getting chased gets fucked over.
---
They would have to put it behind a first time prestige wall or something because if not there would be literally zero reason to prestige.
---
They are really convenient though, because unless you got sprint burst, your situational exhaustion perk (besides Adrenaline), is gone, so your play style has to change.
---
I personally lost it laughing when he said “learn to aim” but I hit all my hatchets on him.
---
the DCs are out of control lately. jesus.
---
Using "fragile" specifically in a comment about anti-white racism... I see what beliefs you have.
---
"SJW" is for children, NPC is more accurate to be honest. :)
---
Staying awake to avoid Freddy...
---
Also, the devs couldn't get my movie likeness from Kyle Gallner...
---
I know...I look like a methhead, but its either that or to die by Freddy
---
someone said it's a bug/glitch and not an actual hack
---
The killer still gets a bonus for you quitting. No matter how many downvotes I get.
---
well if you do it as Pig you completely destroy the point of her power since the traps timer pauses while in a chase. I imagine pigs in particular do it because no matter how bad you are, if a survivor has a trap on their head their only hope of escape is through the hatch  basically guaranteeing you at least that kill no matter how much you get punished for tunneling 1 person.
---
And then face camps you on the hook and continuously hits you with Mad Grit like their cool.
---
You lost me at “the pig wastes a few seconds”
---
I’m done with this argument. It’s very obvious that it’s impossible to change your mind, but what can you do, reddit will be reddit.
---
Well maybe if they hadn’t have lowered the healing speed so fuckin much with their bullshit excuse of “extending game time” 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
---
if you say ez or baby killer or both in the same post-game chat message, on behalf of all the killer players and all the survivor players:
---
Congradulations, you give stupid/autistic people a bad reputation!
---
Because the cringe was intentional
---
^
---
Wait, where was my comment saying anything whatsoever about white nationalists? You realize not all Trump supporters are white supremacists right?
---
Are splinters just a PC thing?
---
This very reason is why I have dear stalker
---
I know how but I'm not gonna tell you how
---
So it's ok to stereotype people based on sex but not race. You're a genius, absolutely brilliant
---
Yes, but those 32 seconds coast games. Can most people honestly say they can run around nurse, billie or spirit for 32 seconds for it to be worth a heal? Against pig, hag or wraith yes, heal, because you can get hit from thin air. All in all it's all on a person, most will heal of course, because they are terrified, but most of the time you loose 10-15 seconds of gen repairing time, and how many times did you had last gen almost done but didn't manage to finish it?
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. To explain the appeal though...
---
A lot of people like watching him cause he doesn’t bitch and moan all the time like a lot of other streamers. He explains what he’s doing and answers questions. He’s also really good so people learn a lot from him just by watching him play. He’s one of the few streamers that doesn’t play toxic.
---
Most streamers only put good compilations together. He puts up full matches so you can see the good and the bad. You can learn from his mistakes as well.
---
I know sometimes he can claim a “dead arrd” that clearly wasn’t, but that doesn’t change the fact that you can learn a lot from him. I agree he is slightly full of himself which is off putting even to me sometimes. The good outweighs the bad for me though.
---
Most reasonable people think that NOED is OP, regardless of the side.
---
Just like most reasonable people said that DS before the rework was OP.  
---
The game (from what I've seen) is in a much better place than it was in the past, but that's not to say that it's in a healthy state.  There are things that can be done that would improve the health of the game, but that's not what I've seen the community wants.
---
The girl from Orange is the New Black? She's technically an ensign she's only acting captian cuz they're stuck in the gamma quadrant , idiot.
---
Queue "Smack My Bitch Up" 😂
---
well, they can check profiles, or guess based on the name/who they're playing like people tend to do in other games
---
This is my favorite. They always blow a gasket when I let them know they single-handedly lost the game for the survivors by doing it.
---
i don't see it, sorry. as far as i know she's infectious, not toxic
---
&gt;Also, there is a consequence. Doing things like that can get you RIGHTFULLY reported.
---
Bruh... you honestly think they ban people for hitting hooked survivors?
---
Dutch from Predator or Ellen Ripley &gt;
---
Yeah that's a more comparable situation. And it can actually get the player banned (bodyblocking/holding the game hostage).
---
I've already done a p3 survivor stereotypes, but I love to see what other people experience in this game. &lt;3
---
Yeah, fuck that guy. The only reason I’ll stay at the gate is if someone is being chased, and if they get hooked I roll the dice and try to save. The toxic bullshit is lame imo.
---
I play solo all the time and pharmacy or bond is simply better 99% of the time. Not to mention you get a tonne more points because 1. You actually contribute to the match even slightly, and 2. The team isn't cripples by your presence so there's more chance of an escape.
---
“EXPOSED?! THAT MUST MEAN THEY CAN SEE ME!”
---
ah thanks for telling me. still a stupid bug tho
---
This happened to me a couple nights ago with Feng Min. I couldn't see jack. I managed to find my way to a gen but the graphic glitches made it really difficult to see the skill checks so I was pretty much instantly found and hooked. I just let myself die on hook because I knew it wouldn't get any better. Thankfully, it was just that one match. I have no idea what caused it. Sucked though, 'cause I brought it a fancy item and burned an offering. Oh well.
---
Big yikes sis
---
If youve never had a claudette who self cared in the corner for 32/40 seconds doing nothing just to go down right after in 10 seconds then you dont understand the pai
---
When Chucky plays aura perks, he only sees feet.
---
But seriously, line of sight is a valid concern and I'm not sure how you make it work with something the size of a doll. He'd be worse than a P3 Claudette when it comes to visibility. What about his terror radius? Object of Obsession would seem almost a requirement to keep tabs on him.
---
The only way I can maybe see it working is if Chucky works a little like Michael Myers and has tiered forms. So T1 he's a little doll with a little terror radius that can't really do much vs a survivor. T2 he possesses an adult body and chases people around like a standard M1 killer. T3 he becomes a life-sized demon doll and terrorizes survivors for 60 seconds. I don't know. It all seems awkward.
---
Losing points is the penalty -_(°~°)_-
---
And I'm that random.. 😂
---
The game was so scary when I first started playing it. It's not scary now but I still find it very exciting. I like playing this game because I go through a range of emotions while playing a match. It is very thrilling
---
It’s not that SC is ‘bad’ but it’s not efficient anymore by itself. If you have another perk to help with it Botany for speed or Pharmacy for and extra heal or even Iron Will to keep yourself quiet and allows you to heal in more places than the corners of the map, then it can be used effectively. 
---
Honestly in my Solo survivor experience, people are just afraid to either experiment with other perks or are too scared to rely on someone else. I recently got Solidarity up to T3 and honestly I’ve never felt this happy to heal someone else since Autodidact was released. Also speaking of the useless teammate SC in the corner, my last game was me running Pharmacy and Empathy and I saw someone break chase with the killer and start healing. I ran maybe 40m to heal them but they didn’t let me so I ran back, found a nearby chest, looted my Green Medkit and ran back to them and set it in front of them cause they were still healing.
---
I hate doctor mains, love monto tho
---
I've never even fully processed the fact the place had a ceiling.
---
They should lose the points they got for hooking them, if the survivor died then they should lose points for hooking, summoning the entity and the sacrifice
---
Not to be rude or anything but that should be the least of your concerns considering what the game is rn
---
You will loose chaser points for standing next to a hook for too long. Of course if you dont care about ranking up this doesnt matter.
---
If all of you don't commit to getting the random out and sandbagging eachother, you're just wasting your obscene meme potential.
---
Considering how killer sided the game is now with all the wall hack perks like Nurse's and BBQ... yeah, you fucks all deserve a t-bag or 100.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Wow
---
Where did that come from
---
lol
---
How tf are there 2 killers
---
It's very broken. Several maps and structures are plainly unfair to killer
---
The crows is because the killer needs to find afkers, not really the same as face camping. But it's basically impossible to rank up if your camping.
---
m8 I have 500 hours in this game. It has made me so dead inside that I have learned to completely ignore how bad this game is. I however, cannot ignore the 3 minutes it takes for me to enter a match and how I have to stare at my non-perfect Meg during that time. (No but seriously, this game b a d)
---
that lit doesnt do anything tho? and just "gives" them more power anyway knowing they made u rage quit lol?
---
Look at me. I'm Michael now
---
Note that the NOED is teir one
---
If I see that a killer is just going to stand on the hatch, then I'll move across the map and make some noise. If the killer doesn't take the bait, then I'll work a gen. If he does take the bait, then I'll try to beat him back to the hatch. Either way, it's boring to just sit and wait for someone to make the first move, so do it yourself.  gg, new match
---
this map and the coal tower are wildly annoying , and im not gonna equip bamboozle just so i can have a fair loop :-/
---
It came from the dev's doing a pretty good job.
---
everyone was running along that loop so i had to camp my hooks because there were 2 gens left and no one dead. i felt bad but everyone was running that loop so
---
Yes, the rules are just too strict.
---
Shame on you
---
I cleansed a different lit totem later in the match and it was ruin so that totem was probably haunted grounds
---
Coal tower is actually a weak spot for survivors. Or at least well balanced. But it's like a soft dead zone
---
would be fun as fuck
---
Have always wanted this. It would be awesome.
---
Oh I didn't know that it was an exploit. I thought it was a bug that accidentally happens in the game.
---
I was just told that the game map was killer favored, i havent felt so much pain in my life
---
i also got teabagged lmao, some people in this game are just so attention seeking
---
stares with the nurse
---
10 gEnS
---
Oh so it's a one shot down? I thought the killer knew where they were
---
Nice
---
We’re gonna live forever be like
---
There's a list of things that the match making tries to find, if they can't find someone 
---
A. In your rank bracket. 
---
and
---
B. In your general area (good ping)
---
Then they by default just try to fill your lobby with who ever is available. That's what causes matches like this. It's so you don't have to wait two hours to play a game.
---
My guy, visit /r/The_Donald  real quick and click on a few posts...
---
I don't mean to make you look stupid or anything, but knowing what you're talking about doesn't hurt
---
Didn't they say they were working on a new gamemode?
---
The penalties are: 3 survivors without pressure to power through gens, loss of chaser emblem and low earning of bloodpoints.
---
would be too broken, killer is all about patrolling and moving so stopping that would be broken, also yeah i know they arent moving when they camp..the best thing to do is 99% gens then pop them all and escape so the killer depips
---
Can’t get facecamped if you die last *head tap*
---
They are mixing up the endgame.
---
with balanced, a popular perk ppl run, it becomes a near infinite
---
It would be a 1:1 so it wouldn't be 8 v 2 (for the same reason that a 3 person game isn't better because there are 4 gens to do) but I think having friends play killer together would be quite fun and would equalize the power of SWF comms
---
lol, hopefully but the more important things should come first
---
Oh, lets see how it broken it's gonna be lol
---
People blindly follow their favorite streamers/youtubers
---
Lol killing yourself is something that some people believe can get anyone banned?
---
I actually do try to make it a priorty to go after sandbaggers. There was one time during a chance where I was going after someone and they pretty hard threw down a pallet right into someone's face. Even I felt baffled by how blatant it was.
---
People just love to win in the easiest way but hate when they are on the other side. Just hunt. You’ll get so many more points that way.
---
If I knew it had an impact, I would. 
---
I had plenty of awesome matches were I was killed and would happily kudos the killer.
---
Protesting against the players who can't do anything about it. If you really want to protest the devs (who already said they're fixing legion) you'd stop playing the game until they fixed it instead of dc'ing like the whiny crybaby you are.
---
Oh come on we're not that bad we just love laughing . how about you try playing him , you'd be shocked with how fun he is to play.
---
I just want some extra blood points.
---
Yes, that’s exactly what it means. 
---
/s (if it wasn’t obvious)
---
He’s annoying in my opinion
---
Rest in pepperonis man. Feels bad.
---
This game needs killers like you and me and not tunneling bitches who punish me when I get unhooked at the wrong time.
---
It's very very rare.
---
The Game is definitely Killer-sided, but it punishes certain Killers and playstyles pretty hard.
---
Killer-sided:
---
- No pseudo-infinites.
---
- Blood trails are super visible even at a distance.
---
- Multiple floors lowers accuracy of the Terror Radius.
---
- Totem placements generally favor areas away from gens and tucked away in nooks.
---
- Doc has his "Mr. Worldwide" build.
---
- Confusing layout can lead inexperienced survivors to waste large amounts of time doing nothing valuable.
---
Survivor-sided:
---
- Nurse's blink accuracy needs to be much better due to the floors.
---
- Hillbilly can't crossmap and must use roads.
---
- Lots of nooks to hide behind.
---
- Killers bad at tracking tend to lose you between rooms if you get a headstart.
---
- Hex totems have a 2/5 chance to spawn in the open.
---
- Bodyblocking is very efficient if you know where to be.
---
hehe 
---
check out my mew ama for quentin again
---
"Killer-sided" tell me another joke.
---
I think we did a pretty good job, so far.
---
Your concern was already addressed earlier, that this would only be OK if they did like overwatch where you cannot vote or endorse someone on your friends list. That way it cannot be abused.
---
I once did this as Trapper no tunneling 4k and got nice comments.
---
Lot's of shitty streamers who play DBD , im not talking about skill wise but their personality . Lots of them are hypocrites and many of their actions contradict what they say but like you said their "chat" just sides with them and if you actually call them out your probably going to get banned from the chat .
---
Yeah. Like if I’m playing a killer and someone points to a locker. I’ll slap them down, open the locker, and if someone is in there, I’ll let them go, and hook the pointer.
---
plus the added time of even finding the survivor while you're doing nothing
---
I love this more than i should
---
You do understand that voting list is extremely old and at one point yes, self care was a top tier perk. With the healing nerf and the prevalance of things such as instadowns and mangled status effects, it's simply not worth healing most of the time.
---
It’s “garbage”, but for some odd reason it’s an insta pick in 90% of survivor builds. Odd...
---
I know they are boasting but I always saw it as they were also waiting for me to get there to get some free points before they left.
---
Like, how else can survivors communicate?  They generally let you hit them before they leave.  Sometimes the are squating to get you to take the shot.
---
Situational and the fact that it's bugged sometimes makes it even less reliable .   
---
(Vaulted shack window with bamboozle lvl 3 , not even 5 sec past and somehow the survivor managed to vault it. It was still blocked on my screen and when i asked the survivor how did they vault the window they just said it wasn't blocked on their screen.  )
---
Mad Grit only works when you’re carrying a survivor and only gives you no cooldown on missed attacks. 
---
I’m not saying you should t have your feeling about it but you’re just referencing the wrong thing and it’s funny you call someone’s lacking intelligence but you’re phrasing is off too. 🤔🤔🤔
---
Oof, bullet dodged
---
I dont see anything wrong with it from either side tbh. It always gets me a few extra points either way. And I think it's understandable to wait for teammates--you're supposed to be a team.
---
It's different when they hold the game hostage sneaking around and not leaving. I'm much more okay with them waiting at the exit gates and then leaving--there's only two to check.
---
And he has sloppy butcher
---
SpRecial?
---
They have so much things to fix lol they barely fix like 6 last patch.

Game favors some killers really hard and just shuts some of them down.
---
I usually either go to the gate and hit them to end it. But if I went afk and they're still there after 15 minutes I just force  close the game, they'll at the very least lose their items and will think twice next time before doing it to the next killer.
---
I don't think they get the idea from anywhere, it's just not fun to play against yeah you can do whatever you want but that doesn't mean people well enjoy it now if you care or not that is up to you
---
What if that 2 killer bug is caused by some left over test stuff in the files
---
If you need a perk to be able to counter a loop then that loop is broken and needs to be balanced by the devs
---
The amount of puns are electrifying
---
Hatchet someone for her. She seems to really enjoy that! (Anyone else watch Samination?)
---
Well I would've started running when I heard her singing as I entered her terror radius....
---
So out of curiosity, if you see a swastika what is your kneejerk thought? Nazis? But they were only around for a few years and the symbol was around forever before them and has absolutely nothing to do with their message or ideals.
---
But yet the most salient use of it in modern history was by the Nazis. Therefore even though only 0.1% of it's existence was spent with the Nazi party it's still instantly associated with them.
---
No, this isn't comparing republicans to Nazis, it's strictly the clearest parallel I can think of and type about while driving around. Yes Reeeeee has been around since back when I was 11 browsing around on /b/, but nowadays conservatives (specifically Trump supporters) have adopted it and use it just as they do oxygen. It didn't originate with them, but it's the most salient use in modern history.
---
Just figured in case you were being genuine I would explain my point a little more clearly
---
Sure the "freeze" I mentioned might be broken, I just meant there should be something at the very least, it doesn't have to be that. There's not too much of a way to know a killer is camping unless the killer is straight up standing at the hook, so we can't have 3 survivors doing gens while the guy is on the hook, unless all survivors are doing SWF and on call telling each other that the killer is camping so they can just do gens. Maybe if killer stays looking at hooked survivor for too long his aura shows to all other survivors so they can know to start doing gens and leave the killer be? lol. That won't be TOO broken will it?
---
Better yet, just delete the perk, it’s too powerful to have in the game.
---
I thought this was loss.
---
We will have sex like bunnies...
---
Yeah, Legion changes should come this week.
---
I won't. I haven't been banned by anyone for it... yet but I call them out on a lot of things a lot of the time. You can hear the anger in their voices when they talk back to me and try justifying whatever X thing is they got called out on or questioned about. Some of the fog streamers are the worst offenders of whatever X may be.
---
You do this... for me?!
---
They've fucked the Spirit over for almost 6 weeks now. Sounds are vital to her more than anybody. Indeed, every new chapter release the audio for killers gets screwed up, then we have to wait 6 more weeks to get it fixed in the mid-chapter release, only for it to get screwed up again when another new chapter is released. Never fails. Been that way for the last year.
---
I’ve had a streamer (a smaller one) get mad when I asked why he thought I was stream sniping. He demanded me for money to get the question answered because I was apparently a troll for asking a question. Sad how streamers like those 2 have viewers
---
No, Freddy's the worst. I'd rather play Wraith. And Self Care is his ***absolute*** kryptonite since it gives Survivors free skill checks. 
---
Like, do you know where you're at right now?
---
*"Rules for thee, but not for me."*
---
Negativity bias or whatever. It feels a lot shittier to have something shitty done to you than to do something shitty.
---
The buildings in almost every map? Ormond, Haddonfield, Badham, Mother’s Dwelling, Temple of Purgation, Disturbed Ward, the swamps, I’m not gonna go on. 
---
I mean you don’t need any exhaustion perk to play survivor well, it’s just a nice bonus.
---
Wraith
---
We all love it rank reset, don’t we?
---
I occasionally will shoot them a message after the match and ask what they do for a living that grants them so much free time to be an insufferable ass.
---
I can't tell you how many times in solo my teammates don't heal me. IDK why, but for some reason, it's always a Dwight. I do a gen with them, teabag and they just walk off. It's very frustrating.
---
Wonderful thread. What's your current rank?
---
I go as far from the exit gates as possible. It happens that the survivors become overconfident and start looking for you. Then they get chainsawed and hooked. Last time this happened I went from 0 to three kills
---
mistress*
---
pardon?
---
True. But also PSA:  the hooks are based on a 3-strike system. You're meant to be downed 3 times, not once. Tunneling someone doesn't qualify here for re-downs. If you're going to be a tunneling jackass you might as well just sit there and camp them since it's the same damn thing - not giving them a chance.
---
When I stream I just say "I'm not afraid to tunnel or camp. If I want him gone, I will. NO regrets" I also brainwashed people to hate Dwights xD
---
T bag her as i loop her around the infinite
---
Sloppy butcher, everyone just runs it now and I spend a eternity healing my teammates.
---
#*STAB*
---
No I’m not, I know how Mad Grit works. I’m telling you the KILLER in particular I’m talking about literally thought that was how Mad Grit works. 😐
---
Like they literally said they were hitting me over and over again on a hook (without a survivor on their shoulder) because,” it’s funny with Mad Grit.”
---
I literally was like...LOL WHAT?! That’s literally not how that works...but this fool was convinced it was or just trying to troll. Then again he was a face camping Legion who face camped literally the first person he downed. 
---
I think you might have just misunderstood what I said because I didn’t word it well.
---
&gt;!haha looks like she has to pee!&lt;
---
I'd reply with "It's not that I need noed or tunneling. It's just that I want to"
---
Lol. Who the hell DCs just for their buddy to get the hatch? Real friends don't let friends lose their points just because they want a hatch.
---
Their next bloodweb on their character taking longer to complete, less bloodpoints on their next WIN.
---
Oh dont get me wrong I know what you mean and I can understand it, I really just meant this one sentence about 2-3K with a bit of luck.
---
Tbf it was good. I wonder how the gaps changed now. If dbd ever went off time played it could ruin the game for the OGs and kill its popularity. Rank doesn't seem relevant either. Sad
---
Pick one character and stick to it, so you can spend all bloodpoints on addons for that killer. Also give no fucks about what is 'right or wrong' in survivor eyes. Play smart, not nice.
---
Im pretty sure They dont get the 5k survival points.
---
Does it no longer stop them from getting 5k survival?
---
also i dont care what they think lol
---
A normal, m1 115% **one hit down** killer.
---
Read the post again, genius. I'm pointing out how diminishing something to sound harmless while ignoring the problematic part of it is stupid.
---
In fact I specifically point out that teabagging isn't anywhere near as bad as nazism, so yewh, try actually reading.
---
I have many 'best moments', for me they're memorable moments. One is Killing a toxic claudette, getting the usual insults from that Claudette in the after game chat, starting a new game....And SEEING THAT SAME PLAYER enter my lobby.
---
well, you seem to be new. means you don't play with experienced players who know how to abuse current sound muffling changes, scratch marks that go crazy if you walk for a second after breaking line of sight and i don't know what headphones you have but mine are real good for the game and i used to be able to distinguish people getting in lockers above or below me while i was in chase with someone else injured. whilst right now i can barely hear the injured behind the chase music. also the fact that corn muffles everything as if it's a wall... 
---
you'd anyway notice if you played a lot of Spirit that scratch marks overall appear ~0.5 seconds after sirvivors sprint. therefore when you phase towards them, you don't know which way they can actually go cause scratch marks are delayed. 
---
i have a side account with low ranks, i go there when surviving and killing gets unpleasant on my main and i just observe and goof around. i do dailies, however, and sometimes have to play at least a bit for that and i've never had a problem tracking people there. brown, yellow and early green ranks are so much different from purple and red.
---
Agree with Sloppy Butcher. Perks that just make shit take longer are fucking awful
---
I especially love it when you have survivor teammates that do this when you are on hatch waiting. Which then forces you to run to the eat gate past all of your teabagging teammates and leave
---
They wiggle? I will sandbag a survivor for research.
---
That is fair, it’s just significantly more frustrating against a killer that pretty much has no counter-play, because their power is so horribly designed that you can literally abuse it’s flawed mechanics to ensure there is little to no chance of counter-play. But I do see what you’re saying.
---
Yeah no you literally just wasted your own bloodpoints from what I can only assume 80% of your games roflmao, "fuck em" he says x to the d.
---
Does Freddy's add-ons that decrease skill check chances even affect SC? I don't own him and I haven't seen a Freddy in about two weeks now and I'm pretty sure I have never seen that yellow icon while SC'ing out the dream state, while on generators it is pretty commonplace.
---
doubtful. i’m sure the trigger works relatively same as the adept survivors.
---
The amount of tunneling and camping is absurd. Why can’t people just play normally
---
I dig it.
---
Callum Keith Rennie as Ace, Rose Leslie as Meg. Any other casting suggestions?
---
I have ttv in my name but I’m not mean T_T it actually helped me once cause I was streaming and ended up being the only survivor against billy when the match started, so he joined my stream and we ran around helping each other. He wanted me to take the hatch but I let him hook me instead
---
Doubtful but hopeful
---
I'd respect her.
---
im amazed she even has 2 friends to SWF with if she acts like that holy shit
---
I was wondering where the good comments were, as usual downvoted by the salty killermain circlejerk.
---
I feel like they over perform in low ranks and under perform in high ranks. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gotten a killer running ruin and I’ve spent a solid 2-3 minutes trying to track down the damn Hex when I ask myself “how has no one found it yet?” And discovering myself being the only one looking for it. 
---
You could imagine how unsurprised I am when I check the ranks at the end of the game and find my randoms to be rank 15+. Not that I wanna shame them we all start somewhere and I always send them a message saying to look for the Hexes, especially ruin. But I feel like that’s one reason that they get such a wrap is that they tend to work reeeeeeally well when no one is looking for them or doesn’t know the spawn locations.
---
TL;DR Low levels don’t look for hexes all the time and high levels find them in a minute flat so the opinion on it is polarized from what you’ve experienced.
---
It’s more putting their head into their normal position. It looks like they look up, or forward.
---
The game lasted long enough for me to get 4 pebbles charged and thrown and 3 gens completed without Nurse winning any chases lol

---
Ruin, seems like every killer is running it nowadays.
---
Yeah, that's an issue I didn't consider but I suppose that may drag out for an entire survivor team in general. That's a toughie.
---
Yeah it has happened to me multiple times
---
So Legion is good because he let's you be petty as a Killer, against other petty Survivors? Well at least he's good for something
---
I think people would just use it do dodge good killers/survivors.
---
Lol I'm mostly playing survivor nowadays, though I was 50/50, but never killer main
---
Those things are fine as they are readable most of the time and it creates rapid decisions. Sometimes it's better to drop pallet earlier so killer won't be able to land a hit through it, and sometimes it's better not to drop pallet at all and use hit sprint to run to the next pallet.
---
Also, what are you so agitated about? Yeah we have different opinions, but it still isn't reasonable to say random stuff you actually don't really know about, like calling me killer main
---
1. Yes, many games do match you with anyone. This leads to endless frustration when someone with more experience amd unlocks destroys you. Also, I'd benefit more if rank were ignored since I'd have shorter queues and easier games (as Killer).
---
2. Again, the game isn't dead. It has only gotten better as time has gone on. Compare DBD to something like F13, and you'll see it is nowhere near dead.
---
3. BHVR is Canada's largest *INDEPENDENT* games developer. Studios like Ubisoft Montreal and Bioware are far bigger than them. DBD is the only truly successful asymmetrical multiplayer game on the market, at the moment.
---
["Hooked on a feeling"](https://youtu.be/NrI-UBIB8Jk?t=33)
---
I wish that played when we got hooked :P
---
I’ve been in that situation, it’s annoying as fuck and there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s not fun and it isn’t worth it at all. 
---
I don’t even participate in games against Legion in general anymore because I don’t feel like giving them points they didn’t really earn.
---
I have played killer a number of times and it usually takes at least some skill. 
---
With Legion you just go into frenzy mode and hold down M1, there’s no skill to that so I’m not giving someone who does nothing but that points they didn’t work for.
---
100%. The only other one I can think of is a Wraith that hasn’t found anyone yet and that’s extremely rare.
---
Low-priority, not a block, with a limit on how many players it can hold. (OP suggested 3.)
---
 Thoughts?
---
pigs doing this annoys me
---
It’s more about not wasting time, I couldn’t care less how the legion feels. Have fun with your dc’s if they really make ya that happy
---
I always wait in a locker for a short while before cleansing because you KNOW that killer is going there straight away.
---
I wouldn't say there is a balancing issue, but the survivors main objective sure has a lower skill requirement than the killers.
---
As a killer you have to find people which is harder than hiding,and then you have to win chases and put them on the hook 12 times in total.
---
While most of the survivor gameplay is holding M1 when not in a chase.
---
I don't know how to fix this without completly reworking how gens work, which would be a way to big task at the moment.
---
But if you had to go and find stuff to bring to the gens to fix them it might be more skill related.
---
Haven't played the game in awhile so can anyone fill me in on why legion is so hated? When I was playing last she seemed bad compared to other killers.
---
I find legion fun to play against, but for the 10th or so time this thread, it’s not about that, it’s about not wasting time in a match only to find out it’s some pathetic kid that get kicks off DC’s so they run bugged add ons.
---
I've tried so hard to get up there, too. You can get so damn close to the edge of the staircase, it bugs me so much.
---
What would have been better is if he had haunted grounds and insta downed him.
---
All of the exhaustion perks have strengths and drawbacks and situations in which they’ll be more or less useful. It’s okay for me to like BL and you not, we don’t all need to run the same perks.
---
After rank reset? 6 on killer and 9 on survivor, was 3 and 10 before that. And thanks, I think it’s turned into a pile of shit, so pretty normal for any thread involving an opinion, legion, and DC’s.

The Game map is weirdly balanced. Pretty much every pallet on that map is safe...and there's a lot of pallets. On the other hand some doors are closed and that can hurt an unaware survivor, at the same time if a killer tries to cut off a survivor and a door is closed that hurts them in chase...it's really weird but I will say Killers have a slight advantage on it.
---
Eh, I disagree.
---
Yeah, it's pretty solid for Myers, Hag, Doc, Plague and Legion. They all have decent map control and can play with their terror radius in such a way as to really fuck Survivors sense of killer direction. I've also had some solid plays with Wraith using either of the two sound changing addons. I imagine that Spirit could also really take advantage of the sound direction difficulty.
---
Did that, but with how effective the devs are at fixing issues, I’d hate to know the effectiveness of reporting lol
---
and there's that survivor with Deliverance but without BT, WMI or WGLF
---
oh fuck me
---
copy paste was wrong
---
correct link is up there now
---
fixed link
---
Unplugging your internet as a killer keeps your bp and before the update to DC pips, it didn't depip you. As a survivor you only lose your offering. You keep BP and items.
---
Undress and bend her over and you know what's next ;)
---
Erm what about accidentally dcing, i mean I’ve had times were my game crashes or my WiFi cuts out and I automatically dc. So I’d be punished for nothing?
---
Ew please no
---
Her two friends act the same so I can only assume they are all hateful together.
---
If I get destroyed I don't even go to the door. I stand in my corner of shame in the basement, facing the wall.
---
Delivery Boy.  Run Across in the Hole, Bond, Plunderers, and exhaustion perk excluding Sprint Burst.  Bring a coin for extra chests, and then spend the entire game searching chests for items and giving them to the other survivors while running everywhere.  If you bring some friends everybody can bring coins and you can have 8 extra chests!
---
Only problem with #1 is Head On and Lithe can't combo, but some neat builds
---
Myers with scratched mirror sure. Hag 100% cuz of choke points being plentiful, Doc cuz the small map, Plague isnt too effective in my eyes cuz the plentiful safe pallet locations, with corrupt yeah but in vile purge shes just as exploitable to the safe loops, I completely Disagree with Legion, he cant do anything on the game theres too many pallets..I hear you saying jump over the pallets..yeah but the thing is if your not running cooldown addons as legion on the game ur fucked they can reach pallets and stun u with them just in time forcing you out of frenzy and due to the sheer shit ton of pallets they can do this constantly, effective survivors on the game against a legion will absolutely destroy him. Like I had a game I was playing how i play normally and I basically was only able to get one survivor down and hooked mainly due to how effective and resourceful with pallets these survivors were..legion maybe with bad survivors could do okay on the game but with good ones? not at all.
---
Everyone knows the addons are bugged, its been in the game for awhile, and im just saying reporting helps them know whos abusing the bug so might aswell do it
---
Whoever uses it (myself included) if we ever run into each other then salute with butt dance
---
People already report for non-bannable offenses.
---
I can't see anyway to stop people from just reporting someone Everytime they get salty nor can I think of a way to make sure reports are authentic instead of false.
---
If you watch just about any twitch streamer who maina survivor, you'll see them get salty an report killers for tunneling and camping, both recognized by the games own devices team as "viable tactics" yet there they go, slapping that report button anyway.
---
There's just no real way to fix the toxicity in this community, your either in it with a smile, a snarl, or you stop playing.
---
Leatherface to get bbbq and chilli. After this, i'm gonna use them on pig to get her prestige 3
---
Me, a killer main: "It can't be as bad as survivors say it is."
---
Me, trying survivor: "It's exactly as bad as survivors say it is."
---
Myers is such a noob stomper, I love it.
---
Tbh, I've only ever versed legion on Game, I don't own them. So i can't speak to his getting destroyed by good pallet use. The main point I was making about Game is the sound games you can play due to the vertical nature. No other map lets you mess with survivors ability to hear you coming, especially with Monitor. The killers I mentioned can all take a lot of advantage in different ways of that ability.
---
Googling "dbd susie" at 1 am
---
in my first match against Myers i thought he was a survivor and i didn't know why wasn't he working on a gen with me until he pulled me off the gen, that crap scared the shit out of me
---
Good eye! I guess this is debunked, in the heat of the moment I didn't pay attention
---
EVERYBODY NEEDS 100% MOAR BP ALWAYS XDD
---
bcs bloodweb is rng potato bonanza.
---
So did the person get the 4k?
---
Tbqh I dont really know. I *think* I was kicked off CoD BO from false reports against me, but I play single-player 99.99% of my life and haven't played a multiplayer game/mode since BOIII, so I can't be sure if Sony actually does that.
---
To my knowledge, I dont think PSN even allows reporting easily. If you pull up a players profile you just get the option of browsing their info (games, trophies, friends, etc), add them as a friend, send them a message, or just BLOCK.
---
I tend to go with the good ol' BLOCK on the rare occasions I feel like never interacting with particular people again, or for obvious trolls (ex: FIESTYZOEY, zero trophies, zero games played or owned, sending random poeple messages about how lonely "she" feels? = BLOCK)
---
Is that the start to a letter?
---
I used to feel bad for targetting sandbag victims when I wasn't that confident a killer, and wanted to make sure I killed someone. Now I always go after the sandbaggers.
---
Beautiful.
---
I like to try and be chill with rank reset, but there's always so many players who dial their sweat to 11 for it, it becomes something of an arms race.
---
Haha, "Hooked on a Feeling" 😂😂
---
cringe
---
I had this one game with a hag where I was her rancor she downed me and stood over me every time a teammate would get me up she immediately downed me again and after the 5 gens were done she moried me.......
---
I like talking to the killer and/or the survivors and when people auto-leave or only say gg it makes me sad...
---
Uneccesarry hate here. It used to be good but then surveillance got reworked and corrupt  intervention became a thing Ruin shot from S+ to F- because it usually gets cleansed in 30 seconds or survs literally manage to hit all great skillchecks with this fucker.
---
Who that in the bottom right
---
The unholy trinity doesn't exi-
---
Can be nurse
---
Because he's an original killer and back then they all had the same movement speed.
---
Monto is the best
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Imagine thinking eternal NOED on a 115% killer isn't powerful. And if they bring any of the apples, y'all are in for a real rough time. It just takes one person to cleanse, then it's all over.
---
I would rely on others to heal me. If they didn't all run away when I was trying to get a heal. I love experimenting with builds. They just don't always work so I go back to my usual. Last week I tried an anti slug build....noone slugged me so it did nothing.
---
Thought, now that I think about it Solidarity and Autodidact could be a good combo. Assuming you get the skill checks anyway.
---
It is pretty strange that Tru3 gets more shit than most even though, like you pointed out, there are people far worse than him.
---
yeah so if nobody fucking cleanses then it’s fine, which is why everyone should get a brain and stop cleansing like morons.
---
You have to unlock the perk from claudette blood web and unlock her teachable perk. Then you can find it on the blood web of all the survivor.
---
And its the same for all survivors.
---
If you want a perk from a survivor, you have to unlock the teachable perk first.
---
same, i wanna get all the perks on my Kate, i need to get Jeff's, Quentin's and Ace's teachable first tho
---
You have to unlock it as a teachable for Claudette first or grab it when it pops up in the shrine of secrets. Also, yes, you have to unlock each characters unique perks in order to equip them onto the other survivors.
---
Gdi Monto lol
---
But morons will always exist, hence why plague prevails
---
:c
---
not in swf.
---
Ashen apple = profit
---
they use it once, everyone hides until it’s over, and now she gets gen rushed + looped harder than trapper, wraith, etc.
---
When you phase :
---
Face the opposite direction from the one you're going in, for your husk to deceive the survivors.
---
Pay attention to grass moving when survivor is silent, otherwise try to catch their moaning.
---
Generally, when at a pallet loop, stand still for about 2 sec without turning, (so you basically fake you're phasing) just to check what the survivor is doing, then phase as soon as possible to catch them near the pallet 80% of the time. If they went away during those 2 sec try to predict their next move (jungle gym, shack, window... ?). Spirit is a lot like Nurse, she is a about predicting the next survivor's move, and the more you play her the more you will see patterns among the ranks.
---
Also, Spirit's vault animation looks like she is phasing, so when you're at the shack's window, you can either stand still looking at the window (about 2sec) then catch them at the pallet (where they generally feel safe going), without even phasing. Or you can decide to vault the window and possibly get a hit before they choose where they wanna go. Apply this strategy at unsafe windows too (T walls for instance). That's all about mind gaming to be honest, and it will vary from one survivor to another.
---
I just put in here what others already said in the past, and also what I do in my games, cause i main Spirit. She is very powerful once you manage some of the tricks, survivors will just hate you (yeah I hate her when she is played well and I'm on the other side).
---
I may have forgotten one or two things, but I hope it can help. \^\^
---
Real easy to hide from plague when everyone leaves gas trails and vomits every .2 seconds, along side a blood trail and injured noises.
---
yeah, she’s not gonna check the corner of the map lmao, she’s gonna check gens. hide away from gens. i hate hiding but i hate being vomited on by corrupt purge even more.
---
Tis why whispers is a staple on her
---
by the time she tracks someone down with nothing other than whispers, it will have run out.
---
You may be wondering about the extra e in his name. It stands for evil (within)
---
You see how big huntress is? More like she bends you over
---
Trusty ol hatchet beach ball hit box.
---
You sir, were too fast for me
---
I hope they make this a feature
---
You should off seen the rest of the comic then
---
You cant improve the toxicity of the playerbase.
---
You used the best character to do this
---
Source?
---
It lasts a full minute, she would definitely find someone by then
---
People would still leave, people DC for stupid reasons, for example when they get downed pretty fast in the game, what has this case of a DC to do with fixing the game?
---
I cannot imagine the difficulty he must of had in communicating the event, it's sometimes so hard just to communicate that you're chill.
---
Sounds like a rad time, congrats on not coming last yo.
---
Call child services, jk would smash
---
Happened to me when they first released big booty Jane on PTB
---
Pebble is op. Please nerf.
---
ok, maybe 1, now for the rest of the game she’s a trapper without traps.
---
I get the same as killer, makes me so sad when no one speaks, or they gg and leave instantly, even after a game they won completely. And I don't even know when the survivors leave, so sometimes I'm just talking to myself before realizing they're gone.
---
Oh yeah
---
Tru3ta1ent has the biggest bumlickers I have ever seen in history
---
The BP i earn on killer goes into my current killer (atm nurse because of rank reset, otherwise doc)
---
The BP i earn in survivor goes into my current survivor (david atm)
---
Until either of them hits 40 then i move to the next (feng and probably legion).
---
What type of degeneracy is this
---
We just want points bro sorry. It's much easier to miss with ambush than a normal lunge though, so it's got a better chance to help you rather than hurt you.
---
He is hated because he has next to no counter. He is still innately "weak" but I've found that survivors often wont abuse his weaknesses. People complain about how he can cancel a chase to make your deep wounds time start which is really the only way his power is useful. To counter this I always let him hit me twice and then use his stun time to escape because there still isnt scratch Mark's during this time.
---
MORE LEGION POSTS YES FUCK YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Pop.
---
Only when they pass the pillars at the exit though, so pig can drop you on the other side of them and you can get out free.
---
I had a similar one and it was even my first hook like jesus man some people are assholes
---
Reminds me of the time I was playing a really good clown game, killed every survivor expect one. I searched around for the bit, turns out they opened both gates but didn't go through them. What made thing's worse however is that one of my friends was waiting for me to join their party. Searched around for ten minutes and eventually raged quit. I don't know how I couldn't find them, regardless it's scummy to waste someone's time.
---
I'm sure he'd understand why you needed to get the totem first.
---
Why do you think he's running so strangely?
---
When I first started playing I really thought Michael was the most OP character because he could just walk up without  you hearing him and pull you off the gen. I was too scared to look around lmao
---
If I was the killer, I would not even hook her just so I can feel it.

Levelling up Feng to get teachable Alert and Lithe. It had already helped me in countless situations. Gonna upgrade Leatherface after Feng to get BBQ.
---
Ahh the Legion rework that we all low key wanted.
---
Isn't this part of the list of features they said they dislikes about MLGA?
---
I’ve had great success without it for months, but I would love to try it, damn game just won’t give it to me.
---
I always give it 5-8 days, cuz wow it gets bad
---
You also waste nearly 10 seconds if you just turn around and follow them. If you immediately back up and just follow them from a safe distance, or even smarter, use Bloodhound, you'll be set.
---
Generally - I will down the person who got sand bagged but then pursue the absolute shit out of the sandbagger. Usually - the sandbagged will get picked up from the ground by the team and the sandbagger will get to taste the beautiful hook.
---
At rank 3 it applies to 4 survivors, so it doesn't recycle.
---
i haven't played the game in quite some time now. But i keep seeing videos and especially hybridpanda's shrinewatch to see if bbq &amp; chilli is up for that week.
---
I'll probably be the trigger to play again.
---
Not even CJ can be arsed with Legion.
---
I swear to god the fact people think this is funny amazes me
---
I do not often do this because I don't want to waste extra time waiting for the survivors who are waiting for you. Depends on how salty I'm feeling.
---
Heard about a lot of 3v1s. Never seen a 5v1 before.
---
(like it has always been)
---
  
---
it wouldn't change Spine Chill's usability, it'd just not force you to look away all the time
---
All the gens get done and the killer loses the game.
---
Working on P3 Freddy. Starting playing survivor a few months back so spent the last few months getting them all to 50 so I haven’t touched killers for months except Plague.
---
Side-effect of all the toxicity I guess. For every nice Killer/Survivor in the aftergame theres 9 who will chew you out for "camping" or "bodyblocking"
---
It doesnt work the true tech is after hitting good skillcheck or failing you let go of the gen so while you cant repair you are not able to get another one and therefore you avoid even further regression
---
Lmfaoo
---
Because some people can't accept that they made a mistake, so they call the killer names instead. I don't know why people think I'm just going to go to the opposite side of the map when I just saw 2 survivors lurking nearby.
---
It's like being called a 'tunneler' if you bump into the same unhooked survivor a minute later. Derp.
---
Time to handicap yourself to using garbage perks :D even that loses out after a while though.

---
Pig her traps are not great.
---
Let's assume that you put the reverse bear trap right before a gen is compleated each time.
---
You will compleatly waste 20-40 seconds depending on rng which is good if you want to put a lot of pressure in a short time but not great for stalling.
---
This is assuming the timer starts once they get unhooked.
---
It does waste some time but it does not waste a minute per trap.
---
This is assuming the timer goes off right after you put it on.
---
Survivors that work togheter will take note of who has a trap on and will work around it so the person does not waste too much time walking to the jigsaw boxes.
---
The pig her main power is her dash and while the rbt do help it does not do as much if you look at how long games take against a pig vs games against Freddy.
---
&gt; Killer is within sight, but hasn't spotted you and you're just waiting to see where they're going to go?  Self care.  Killer blocking where you wanna go because someone is looping between you and the rest of the map?  Self care.  
---
I feel like I'm giving away some killer trade secret by pointing this out, but you do realize you're louder when you're healing than if you're just crouched and injured, right? Both of these scenarios you're making it easier for a killer to find you. Bonus points if the killer is using Nurse's Calling.
---
now i wish i had mained Ace but i didn't have him back when i chose my main so i'll just carry on maining Tapp.
---
and as far as i know, Tapp mains are usually not horrible people, right? i only encountered one annoying Tapp and he was prestiged so i'll just assume that people covered in blood and gore might not be fun.
---
oChIdO iS cOmEdY kInG oF dBd CoMmUnItY!!?1/!?!
---
it speaks the truth
---
Noob3 is better
---
Like the other person, you can save a lot of time by finding a nearby ally on a gen and completing that before or after a heal making more efficient use of your time than finding a place you think the killer won't see you for minutes at a time.
---
It also doesn't CONSTANTLY deny benevolence and altruism to your team, and by finding injured allies you also don't get denied the same by their selfish care.
---
It also benefits from healing perks more like lingering We'll Make It that lasts for a LONG time, as well as allies who use med kits etc.
---
Learning to play injured is also important as well and often leads to better time management, where the mentality of selfish carers usually defaults to "I took an injury, priority number 1 is do nothing in a corner."
---
Small Game
---
No survivor can find it easier survivors are just skins nothing more. You can learn the perk small game to find totems easier though
---
carrying her like a fucking bowling ball
---
Try to understand the Emblem system so you can answer all your questions yourself. If you still dislike the Emblem system after knowing how it works at least then you know why you didn't 2 Pip.  
---
I have some spare time right now so I will explain to you what you can read on the Wiki any time.
---
Your second Emblem is gold because you managed to kill everyone but you failed in getting at least 9 hooks out of the Survivors. No 9 hooks = no Iri emblem.  
---
3rd Emblem needs hits hits and hits also hook stages. So second emblem and third emblem go hand in hand. Not enough hook so not enough hook stages and also not enough hits.  
---
4th Emblem, Chaser. You ended your chases pretty fast okay that's great but how many hits did you make? Iri hatchet addon maybe? So you only one hitted everyone? Also the game probably did not last long so Silver in Chaser is pretty ok then.  
---

---
I believe you get a bonus for the first killer and survivor game of the day. Then its just based on ingame time.
---
Nope, unless they jump in first you can't stop them.
---
An they can't leave safely until you hit them, wether it downs them or not because they can escape during your blood wipe animation.
---
Either let em have it an don't sweat it or be prepared to wait it out
---
I thought this when I first discovered it, but all it does it remove the sparks.
---
Perhaps... I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if that was true, but Bricky has his own set of mannerisms and phrases that he doesn't usually divert from; I don't think he makes references all that often, but if he did I feel like it would be someone like Monto he'd reference. He says it in a slightly different way, and he says it seriously, so I have a feeling they both just coincidentally have used the same phrase, albeit Monto says it in practically every Killer video and Bricky has only said the exact phrase a handful of times.
---
Whooooosh
---
It’s not a must pick but it is a good perk. Some killers will camp you for using it, but if they don’t it can definitely help you out.
---
If you play the game more you will know some totem spots, but for now your best option is small game
---
it doesnt take much time to become ''good'' Nurse.
---
Susie's head is harder than a Nokia cellphone, she didn't even got scratched.
---
"The orange" killed me lmao
---
"The fairy" too xD
---
How do you even get less than 20k bloodpoints playing Legion?
---
I hope so, it was really nice to see that you guys listen to your community, keep it up!!! :)
---
&gt;Learning to play injured is also important as well and often leads to better time management, where the mentality of selfish carers usually defaults to "I took an injury, priority number 1 is do nothing in a corner."
---
I agree with this. I personally don't use SC but the main reason it is "bad" is because most people (without situtional awareness) just blindly SC everytime they are injured no matter if they could finish the last generator etc.
---
I my opinion SC isn't as good as many people think but it isn't so bad many other people make it seem to be. In some situations perks like Bond are superior and in some situations SC is superior (in 1 v 1 scenarios for example) or generally if your team is a bunch of potatoes.
---
I would say Bond is superior overall but for healing purposes I don't think it is so clear cut.
---
The game went really quick
---
Lol, basically said “go off sis”
---
Preminition tells you where killer is  
---
Spine Chill tells you what killer is up to
---
Not really, he taped is bottom eyelid too
---
Mainly because despite those addons, and the mori, and MYC, he still camped and tunnelled.
---
I tried to signal to the other two remaining what I was up to but it didn't work, 
---
RIP
---
Comon dbd gays , change your outfit , CHANGE IT AROUND.
---
*watching any horror movie with a chase
---
I had this happen tonight!
---
I was in a lobby as killer, decided to try Freddy with the blessing. Entered the lobby, 2 survivors readied. Timer said game starts in "0:00". I readied and it started. I spawned along with a Legion and Pig, still 2 survivors. I couldn't sleep either of them and was just invisible to everyone.
---
What is this bug lol
---
Like when you get up as close as possible and chainsaw them?
---
You don’t need agitation if you know how to get people to hooks, but people still use it.
---
He had some sexual assault claims at one point
---
Self care went from "We use it because it saves time in the long run because people don't have to risk looking for one another" to "If you run this perk i hope your family burns alive". Jesus people.
---
You definitely didn’t word it like that in the first place nor did you follow up with it afterwards. Like, you corrected me and disagreed with me only now to change up your whole flow of explanation. Just say “legun bed gib 3 karma” next time and it’ll be a lot faster.
---
P3 Tapps are my favourite mythological creature. It's like that comet, you can see one every 176 years.
---
It'd just result in people getting no games since they've blocked all players playing killer x or using perk y.
---
"Where was this audacity mid match?!"
---
P3 Aces are the most impredictable teammates, you never know what you're gonna get.
---
Oh yeah I know that. Yeah against good survivors that never happened and I get looped like any other killer...
---
Prepare for downvotes
---
I swear camper/tunneler is just a common insult at this point. Even most survivors i face come defend the killer like "wait, he didn't camp and everyone was on death hook"
---
And I’m doing this too. If I can physically see that both gates are open, then I’m just exiting the match if it has been more than 5 minutes and they are still there
---
I'm glad to see my boy get some popularity, :)
---
Not the worst, not the best. With the right addons i can perform better with Freddy than let's say Doctor with his good addons.
---
That bitch really needs vaporub or something I swear
---
I'm fucking tired of memes about legion
---
Nothing says terror like being ripped off a gen right after you’ve checked behind you.  Some of you Michaels are straight up ninjas!
---
That is a person using the perk poorly, they use it because they can and not because they have to, those people are what is wrong with the perk.
---
Whatever she's wearing, it needs a good iron.
---
Nea's more attractive sister.
---
It isn’t involved with blinking all, just your top eyelid moves down.
---
That is quite true actually, it does work in a psychological way and turns you into a more selfish person, i myself am guilty of that, though i have improved on my mistakes for the good of my teammates.
---
I'm so glad you do.
---
Snu Snu

Random Teabagging survivor - "Killer LuLz! Lame! So gaaaaay! Me much better at game. 200IQ - Infinite loop - gimme em hatches biatches!"  
---
\-Blood warden - survivor doesn't realize- Killer strolling in casually-  
---
"WAAAAAAAH! Camper noob! How dare you? SRZSLY! Killaz sux! Tunneling! Reported AHAHAHAHAHA! GG" -DC-  
---
Entity: "Whoa man! Calm yar tits! Not cool."   
---
\-Displeased-
---
P3 Ash here, pretty accurate!
---
Don't do it. Its not worth the suffering.
---
You did an even better job with the killer stereotypes compared to the survivors. 
---
Such a satisfying feeling to uncloak and watch the survivors run for the nearest pallet, only to pause in horror as they realise you’re already there, anticipating it. And promptly teabag for mercy
---
If only this sub knew where this come from lol
---
Woah there no0b3 calm down
---
And then other times you hit a wall but Meg gets hit anyway
---
Not sure why it's being downvoted, cause it's the truth. Look at Monto's videos, ruin gets down within a minute unless it's a really low rank. Even than, in my matches, it would be down pretty quick.
---
Unless you want me to just camp ruin
---
... no, I just told you that people will forget what it means and default to what they THINK it means. Why oppose my suggestion when it makes sense?
---
NOOOOOOO! NOT SUSIE! dick.
---
I agree Bond is superior overall. I was just talking from the perspective of getting healed and I think it is debatable which one is better in that aspect.
---
Step 1: Get 3 friends. 
---
Step 2: Easily SWF your way to rank 1 to get that achievement. 
---
Step 3: Never worry about rank again.
---
Step 4: Enjoy DBD.
---
Thank you very much
---
Honestly, I feel like this is too similar to huntress. The gun just works like a worse huntress. And usually you dont throw down a pallet on a huntress right after she misses her shot, so the same would happen with the pistol, basically removing any aspect it has over huntress.
---
 The perks feel underpowered too. Not with the numbers, but their concepts are weak. 
---
STBFL is better all around than the one perk, and unrelenting seems like the same thing but withought the token hassle. 
---
And the hex perk seems like it just wouldnt effect the game much. 
---
The chest one is pretty interesting though. Mabey have an audio cue when a survivor grabs an item. But the 25 second timer needs a buff. Haunted grounds is about the same thing, but last longer and effects every survivor. 
---
Just my thoughts, reply if I missed anything. I love these fan killers. Keep up the imagination.
---
Here I thought this wouldn’t be accurate at all but damnit, my boi Bill is spot on...
---
If only
---
Great question. An update means we are keeping the character mostly the same and tweaking certain aspects of it to make it more fun. A rework is much bigger in scale and involves changing core mechanics to that killer (basically back to the drawing board).
---
It should make a lot more sense once the information on each is released, you'll notice a difference in how much they are changing.
---
Someone needs to do this, but have like 4 hags put max traps around, then have the survivor run thought 40 fucking traps so there can be 44 hags!
---
Because it doesn’t make sense
---
But it does make sense. Being exposed means you can be seen, yet being vulnerable would hint that your defenses are lower and in DbD, would most likely mean that yes, you can be one shot.
---
Thanks, mate. Will do!
---
I can’t help but feel like I’m the only Jeff main, I’ve haven’t seen a Jeff besides myself since he came out
---
I queue up a ton of afk killer games so I help the people climb so after a week or so I can kill regular survivors and not loop gods.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
Style points
---
teabag them when you're putting an RBT on their heads too. especially if they've been douchey the whole match and you finally catch them.
---
Will be. Thanks
---
I keep meaning to buy Ace and level him for his legendary super-quiet pain sounds. It'll be nice if I don't have to run Iron Will.
---
Course I did
---
Do you see me spamming it on reddit?
---
No, because if you make good content you dont need to spam reddit with your shitty channel
---
But whatever you getting salty over me calling on your bullshit
---
But seriously, why in hell were they arguing over the flashlight
---
Quickly checked out your first video.
---
Not too bad but...18 mins long. 
---
Everyone has their own style but I personally would have been able to edit that down to between 5-10 minutes long. Pick your highlights. 
---
Sitting on a full gen isn't that engaging for a viewer.
---
That's just me though. 
---
Good luck.
---
Again, I’m pretty sure you misunderstood me because I worded it pretty shit. I’ve always known what Mad Grit was and how it worked. I acknowledged what you said and tried to explain better and it didn’t work. Literally what do you want me to do. Go back in time and word it absolutely perfectly clearly for you? Excuse me for not being perfectly articulate. 
---
But I cease to see why you feel the need to be rude and accuse me of basically being a dumb liar. You’re the one who misunderstood me. 
---
Go bug and misunderstand someone else.
---
Oh hey, a fellow Jeff main*. Neat.
---
^^^^*IalsoplayDwighttoobutJeffismyusualgoto
---
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
---
Will do
---
I hate D O C T O R  M A I N S
---
And if they didn’t open the exit gates and are looking for a hatch, Ik this is probably gonna sound a bit toxic but I’m going teabag them till they die if they are the last survivor
---
I can’t *not* play the loud man
---
It’s just the best being able to hide from killers while all I hear is **OOOUUUGGH**
---
Dude don't call his channel shitty haha he's just starting out lol
---
Hahaha, yeah, sure dude.. Whatever. Are you seeing anyone else throwing crap here? Nope It's just you. Think about it. ;)
---
Could you imagine if you could make custom rooms like that? 4 Hags, 1 survivor, suvivor must take 10 hits before going down, hags have 1/2 run speed. 
---
Or something even cooler that someone spends more time thinking about. I'd never play normal mode and grind points again!
---
...Oh that's why they won't make it.
---
I encountered a Legion using Third Seal once. It was so strange.
---
That was damn perfect lmao
---
Frustrating.
---
He would be so crap with 110% movement speed. He would just get bullied. I wouldn't mind the possibility of a cooldown on his chainsaw but he would probably be low tier at high ranks with a speed nerf. However, I'd say he is balanced right now at high ranks but a little strong at low ranks.
---
no problem good sir
---
I feel like the settings are mostly for the texture quality.
---
What happens when rbt goes off while stuck in a beartrap?
---
Don't listen to this crackhead. Keep up the good work, dude.
---
We can test that now with the multiple killer feature
---
Dont be like Claudette guys, be like Ace.
---
This is so spot on, especially now when most of the rank 1 survivors were around rank 8 this month. Being a new player/casual player and going for killer games for the next few days is probably going to be a pain in the ass.
---
In my opinion, the best buff to Trapper is to make games last longer.
---
Yeah, I use aftercare and usually medkits as well.
---
Always the Claudettes
---
becoming a M1 Killer at 105% Speed isnt really a buff tho...unless you get a Wall hack with that
---
The meat hook trope is older than the chainsaw massacre.
---
That isn't a buff! She can't blink with the add-on.
---
Damn, where are all these useful Aces hiding? I literally only ever get paired with the derps whose poor choices get them and/or the team killed super quick.
---
I guess I’m not a real Claudette main cause I only hit the “uses meta perks” and “dark clothes” points ): I can’t use a flashlight to save my life... literally.
---
I don't know if it's helping them though. It should come naturally. If they rank up they'll go against more experienced players that are going to bully them even more often. If you're a high rank survivor just maximize your points and use your potential to the max even against weak killers, so you rank up as fast as possible and start going against more experienced opponents. That's the optimal thing to do IMHO.
---
Yeah, you're right honestly.
---
Literally been against a very popular youtuber by sheer coincidence around 5 times in the last month. He's used footage of me in his videos now A LOT (not sure why he likes using replays of his plays against me over and over). The first time I encountered him and lost to him it was a super fun match any way, so I subscribed to his channel. Then when I saw he'd put footage of me in it seemed really suspicious (heavily edited to make the play seem a lot better than it was). The last time I went against him he got matched against 3 rank 20s brand new to the game, and me. He was rank 2. It was such a weird match up. He played super scummy and camped every hook from the start of the game so it was a GG on having any fun whatsoever. After the match all the survivors were nice but he left a salty comment which seemed odd? He then used that footage in his latest video but edited out the part where he was facecamping and it was essentially a montage of him whacking people. Insta unsubscribe.
---
Any good?
---
"nea" lmao
---
They're either mechanically trash and toxic lil shits, or just trash.
---
And not to mention leatherface is camping in that part of the movie SMH
---
I main Tapp and I’ve noticed quite the mixed bag. It’s a mixture of really chill and also kinda sweaty. Usually the sweaty Tapp mains go full P3, though even then they’re usually alright, and the chill ones usually go Bloody face and pants with the suit jacket. I run all kinds of weird perks though. Meta is hella boring considering how easy Survivor can be. I’d rather just try my gimmicky builds and hope for the best like No Mither gen jockey or Deliverance distraction (Empathy, Deliverance, DS, and We’ll Make It).
---
100% agree
---
The unholy hex trinity - Ruin, Thrill Of The Hunt, and NOED. Ruin to slow generator progression, thrill of the hunt to alert you when a hex is being worked on, while also slowing totem cleansing a tad, and NOED because every survivor main despises it. 
---
I could use this, but I won’t.
---
Pug is not one of them. hes always rank 1.
---
he D/Cs when hes tunneled or not having fun.
---
and he is an asshole, but he admits that he is.
---
not everyones cup of tea
---
Holy molly
---
"If you enjoy my content, consider liking and sub for more content" goes a long way.
---
As a mediocre Nea main who is neither amazing, nor trash and definitely not toxic I strongly disagree :(
---
Jeff main reporting in.
---
Monto should be a fog whisperer no question.
---
There should just be a page that explains each status along with the icons. 
---
Should also be in the loading screen tips.
---
It certainly is an odd word to use.
---
Base camping bubba just a expected.
---
Lol true. But the facecamping is running off new players
---
I think for killer you gotta double pip
---
https://i.imgflip.com/25mbad.jpg
---
that was not an intentional match, i started a killer lobby but then the loading screen started to act up and i thought it's gonna be 3 men game. well, yeah, kinda.... 
---
apparently, i wasn't the host either cause on end screen it was the Freddy.
---
plus i couldn't use Frenzy or hit anyone who's sleeping.
---
Tbh they should do actually put that in the game 
---
Idk if it will be fair or not but think about the leather faces with insidious you can easily tell your teammates where he's at
---
And it was for sure the mori.
---
You ever watch ohmwrecker? Dude does this all the time. And like, don’t get me wrong I like the dude, but in his videos he’ll be complaining about people doing something, and in the next match proceed to do that.
---
Is it on Playstation? The only advice I have is to cut the episodes to 10 mins. \~20 mins is long for that kind of video. Other than that I don't have anything. I like the intro a lot very Marvelish, nice touch! The edit is good, the sound balance and the voce over. Keep it up it will become even better. Good luck, dude!
---
I swear claudettes are always the worst, 85% of the time they just crouch near the exit doing literally nothing, just waiting for the killer to eventually come and teabag him, and 15% will just farm u off the hook and run away without even trying to take a hit, selfish toxic little shits.
---
Hey I still enjoy his content.
---
Game Journalism in a nutshell.
---
Dean Takahashi at it again, trying to prove once more he is not dumber than a pigeon.
---
Ok, I’m out of the loop.  What is so bad about Legion?  Is he overpowered?
---
I’m a bill main
---
I’m not toxic to the killer even if they ran noed and face camped me. Unless they’re toxic to me first.
---
Forget that, any movie with a chase scene! I keep hoping they'll juke the killer by hiding just out of sight after turning a corner. 
---
They never do it though.
---
Good for you, he was mocking the ones that place it on a pedestal and get agressive when they get told overwise
---
Exceptions exist.
---
I love how accurate this is with me and my friend. My friend is a toxic claudette main who only runs meta perks and I am a No Mither using Ace main
---
The post was made on April 12th
---
They said they’d reveal the changed a week after
---
So are we to expect the legion update details around April 19th/20th?
---
Funny how the other one popped in my feed first
---
Thats how I'm going to say it in the next video. Thank for the advice, much appreciated!
---
Breakdown combos really well with dead hard, decisive, and deliverance so you can Kobe off the hook, shatter the hook, dead hard if the killer is camping you or if you were hooked in the basement, and then you have decisive as a backup in case you go down.
---
Pop, Overcharge, Ruin and Lullaby is the ultimate fuck gens 
---
Unless it’s spirit then chuck surveillance and Discordance in there
---
yeah, i have done that a few times but it would just be a quality of life fix that seems simple enough. I'm not sure though, I don't make games.
---
So people say Premonition is good for where the killer is, and Spine Chill is good for what the killer is up to, but.... I feel like I already know what the killer is up to. They're moving towards me if Spine Chill is going off. But if Premonition is going off, then there's a pretty good chance they're also moving towards me (What else would they be doing, coming near this gen? They could also be chasing someone, but I'd see that). At least Premonition let's me know WHERE they're coming from, so I can sneak in the other way. With Spine Chill, 9/10 I'll lend up going exactly where they're coming from
---
mythological P3 Tapp at your service, friend\~ I like to think that I'm shit at the game(bc I am lol)but not a shitty teammate, I'll save and do gens when I can, I'm just garbage at chases. 
---
I usually use the bloody head, and regular black pants+suit jacket. Tapp can really be just a dark abyss that killers walk right past if you shove yourself in a corner.
---
I almost always use tenacity. It's such an underrated perk. I know people think they never get use out of it, but trust me you do. Quick and quiet is pretty amazing too, makes lockers sorta work
---
I also watched it the moment he made it
---
how dumb are you? he was only far when he started revving the chainsaw, not when he started the charge. had he just walked directly up to her he would have gotten there faster than revving the saw and would have EASILY pulled her off the lever.
---
I thought the same thing and I wondered why he wasn't already, then I found out he got banned a long time ago
---
I didn't even realise he had quiet grunts of pain, I just got him for his smile
---
If only there was... alas I guess we will just have to settle for the page that explains each status along with their icons that can be found in help and tutorials.
---
Drink my body weight in booze cause I know she'll be able to carry me like a baby in those strong Russian arms.
---
And get Hex Ruin just to slow things down just a little bit.
---
This is a post about shirtless Myers and legion
---
I’m like Max prestige on Ace and haven’t even gotten within the top 10 ranks. Just for fun man
---
Yes, it's from ps4. I'm starting to get the trend. As [the\_shape78](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_shape78) also said -  5-10 mins. Will make the adjustments for the next one. Thank for the advice :)
---
Very much so but TCM is the only one I can really remember to be honest, one involving a living person at least. Most of the time it is just body parts or "meat" chunks. TCM doesn't shy from the fact that Leatherface doesn't give one shit about seeing humans as food and just tosses someone on the hook and goes right back to butchering someone else without a second thought.
---
That's horror right there! You are nothing but food to him, so you are dealt with as food. Just thinking about it sends chills down my back. Iv hunted, butchered game, prepared meat, cooked my fair share of meals, and more without putting much thought into it. It's just normal life. But the moment I start thinking Im the meat for someone, something, else and they will do everything Iv done to other animals to me? It's pure primal fear!
---
there is nothing killer can do short of wasting your own time. but hey if you really need that 4k feel free to wait
---
Definition
---
Exposed : in a vulnerable position or situation
---
very talented, keep it up!
---
Sounds like AngryPug
---
Funny enough, I'm seeing this sub hate on self care more than MoM and noed
---
I really wish they'd add a timer on the gates. If they don't make it there in time they've got to do another generator, and this time only one gate opens.
---
What was he suppost to do? fuck Frank?
---
Time of the month to bring out The Game map offerings with perma t1 meyers or just plain old slug build nurse.
---
these kind of game mode will be easier then dedicated servers are released. im not expectinng anything till then
---
I see nothing wrong with this
---
Monto XD
---
Yeah you like watching videos made by pedophiles?
---
There should be a perk where if the killer stays within a certain radius to you for over like?  10, 15, 20 seconds? I dunno what would be balanced,,, but anyways the entity makes it so you can see from the killers view, and be able to have a smidge bit of control over them. Sorta like struggling but more powerful so they’re not able to easily control their body until they go far enough away. Makes it so they have a larger cool down time between hits too or something, and disables their ability. Once the perk deactivates you see their aura for 5 seconds, and once you get unhooked they see yours for 5 seconds too. Dunno how long is too long or too little. Just an idea I had, tell me what y’all think we could turn this glitch into 😂😂
---
I have mixed feelings about noed but for situations like this I support noed
---
Ace mains always get the hatch. I mori'd a Claudette in front of an Ace once after she sandbagged him and then farmed three generators with him. Her chat in the post game lobby was the most glorious salt I ever read.
---
If they don’t have knockout, whenever someone gets downed and you’re too far to save them, hide in a locker yo. Can’t see nothing with BBQ
---
Uh, yeah. I know. Literally what I just said.

Jane, I just got her to p3. working on getting a decent loadout
---
&gt; corn machines
---
Combine harvesters?
---
You're the exception. If I see two or more Nea players I bring an ebony Mori. They are almost universally toxic little shits in my experience.
---
Oh lol you were serious, I thought I was gonna get whooooshed because there already is exactly what you just said there should be.
---
Owo who might this be organensaft
---
Wow thanks I’ll try it
---
Go into the config file change the resolution and save it. There you can also disable vsync and turn down graphical settings if you want to. (3 being max and 0 being low). If you're having fps issues I'd turn down effects settings to 0. 1050ti should get you stable 60 fps on medium.
---
Tapp mains are pretty cool folks.
---
A comfy cutie!
---
Thats precisely why it's not fair.
---
Did you seriously lump Monto with Ochido?
---
Yeah lol. I just suggested the loading screen thing.
---
P3 Spirit main, can confirm Stridor is godly.
---
It still makes sense to let go, since staying on it won't progress the gen (while it is still sparking) but more skill checks can appear in that window
---
I just like playing her because she has a pretty skirt cosmetic. Sue me.   
---
I did notice after I started playing Nea killers tunnelled me a lot more. I guess there's always that one survivor whose mere appearance is mildly triggering haha. For me when I play killer its always Claudettes.
---
My pepe hard
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
People should just say the names of which streamers they mean. Worst case scenario you get a fanboy downvoting you.
---
damn I Love those mic noises
---
Lol you only got silver malicious because they all got one shot
---
Sitting at the gate does nothing for your team - if you at least leave the gate area, you have a chance of saving someone/taking a hit for them.
---
Slow the game down "Juste un petit peu".
---
Trapper races are great but super hard to set up.
---
xddd LOOOOL SO LITTTT🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂 THIS COMMENT JUST MADE MY DAY!!!! Xdddd👌👌😂😂💔💔🔥🔥🖤
---
I bet legion câmera from chernobyl for how toxic it can be
---
It’s up to u but NOED is considered a crutch perk for a reason
---
I enjoy videos of dead by daylight being played by the YouTuber Ochido.
---
Ace mains are generally great people ;)
---
I started playing the game with Claudette over a year ago now not knowing she's hated so much. she's the character I have leveled up the most and I'm never toxic but I'm almost always tunneled because of the stigma -_-
---
I feel like they've waited so long for the Freddy changes due to the upcoming changes to the end game. I am cautiously optimistic.
---
Do you know how long it takes regularly for scratches to disappear?
---
I’ve heard great things about this program but I for the life of me cannot get it work properly. I follow all the instructions and nothing happens when I load in game 🤷‍♀️.
---
Tbh as a killer main I wouldn't mind
---
Big **F**
---
I have a eye bags bigger than my chance of surviving. I have the same clothes and I see Freddy Krueger in my dreams (no joke)
---
Islegiontoxic?
---
If you'd like a second opinion - the Doc is the best killer, and resistance is futile.
---
If you wanna get face-camped then sure
---
Lol it’s not that hard just wiggle off the hook
---
Damn u got nice curves
---
Ops my game crashed
---
Exposed and vulnerable are synonyms.
---
Lucky. I waited an hour for survs to join my lobby
---
All I can say is I'm happy I got that achievement before they new ranking system. We're all about to be red color blind
---
Not gonna lie I use bt as an excuse to farm
---
Fuck you and your blendette.
---
Boil Over, Saboteur, Tenacity, Unbreakable + a Lerys offering
---
owo new ama about quentin smith
---
every freaking match
---
Cancer legion mains.
---
No I own freddy on xbox and they still appear in every bloodweb
---
No0b3 and Panda are who I watch the most.
---
I'll check out the other guys.
---
No pipping needed. I depipped yesterday and got my achievement.
---
If they didn't make the maps bigger with it then it would be a nightmare and chases with two killers on the same survivor would not be fun. They could cut you off and trap you so much easier that if they wanted you dead you would be. Also unhooking would be horrible because one could stay closer while the other herds people around the map. I think it would just leave a lot of room for trolling.
---
From where did your mic? The killer shack?
---
That's tunneling?
---
On top of throwing down pallets while not looking behind him yeah
---
Hatch counts got tap done yesterday thanks to hatch
---
Normal clothing for her, I love it!
---
I like trying new killers in rank reset
---
Low settings also makes the game overall brighter making it easier to see survivors in dark corners such as in Lery’s.
---
Or because that takes alot of resources and they're focusing on big issues right now? Do you know how any of that works?
---
So can alot of these killers, but LF can stop them flat out while he can't deal with multiple people on the hook
---
Ardetha is a good one to watch too imo. Recommend checking him out
---
Yep. He's one of the poster children for "Toxic Players" in DbD.
---
I'd rather have a David than a nea on my team
---
unreal engine 4
---
puppers is just enjoying his time in the game every time i see him play
---
monto is really entertaining in my opinion, commentary wise. 
---
but the best is when they all play together and drink, noob has some videos of it i believe (and monto too)
---
It's not the hitboxes, it's your connection.. Kappa
---
I kinda agree. Killer requires you to pay a lot more attention to the game. There is pretty much no free time when playing killer. That being said I dont agree with all the shit you brought up. Gen rushing isnt real, pallet looping is the main mechanic of the game etc. You are clearly complaining here
---
Ace mains go big or go home. Either way, they make for a fun match.
---
Well since you basicly have to play intentionally bad and artificially make games as long as possible to climb, ranks 5-10 are way more of a mixed bag and much more full than it used to be. 3 out of 4 of my last games were 4ks that I barely got 1 pip off of.
---
Time to clean out my registry.
---
All hail fellow Ace mains
---
If a bug of that magnitude happened to one of my programs, I'd call it a feature
---
I left the game in early 2017 before the status effects and when I got back I thought exactly what you told. I was like, "oh he can see my aura now." Turns out after doing some research it's actually the status that downs you in one hit. I would like this change to happen.
---
Pig mains are rebelling against the entity. I can imagine amanda being like" you like THIS emotion you eldritch abomination ?"
---
You need to spend quality time with Herman. I heard he is shockingly funny. You'll both end up laughing.
---
This was supposed to be patched out. Looks like they didn't fix it at all.
---
This clip isn’t recent
---
I think he must be talking about the fields themselves, they are the machine that produce the corn
---
The doc can protect a hook better than hag or billy. Just keep shocking the hook.
---
Those are different, but I doubt that's the case if the game just ends after 3 gens get done and the killer didn't get 1 hook, stands still for a few seconds then /end.
---
Man, that legion stunk, nice timing though. How is that tunneling?
---
You're
---
Bahaha so fucking spot on. And the virgin to chad ratio is like 80/20. Love playing the nurse.
---
Thats one definition. It also means exposed : not covered or hidden; visible. Hence the confusion.
---
Pharmacy, botany knowledge, empathy and then the last is up to you. But it's fun for the green medkit for 2 fast self cares or healing others. And my sneaky beaky build is Quick and Quiet, Dance with Me, Lithe and I forget my last perk I think it's lightweight or maybe Iron Will. At work else I'd tell ya but I Know that dance with me I heavily underrated it's my version of hybrid pandas bloodwarden can't play without it haha
---
Angry pug is a pos person, I'm not surprised people watch him. They must all be like minded.
---
Absolutely right
---
Hey, thanks for the Gold Award, anonymous redditor. :D
---
I always camp near gate in case someone gets hooked
---
Like others have said, it’s because he can be looped pretty easily. There is a technique where you can curve the chainsaw around loops but it’s incredibly difficult to pull off and more often than not you’ll end up stunning yourself by hitting debris or a wall. The only real issue I have with billy are some of his add ons, such as insta-saw, which remove any sort of skill from his ability and makes it incredibly difficult to dodge as a survivor.
---
Thats BP, but you also get about 300xp for your first match each day.
---
Didn't know you get that for both survivor and killer, thought it was only once a day.
---
there are people who still unironically think BNP and insta-blinds are a threat. It still happens, just because you aren't the killer that does it, doesn't stop my messages from getting flooded for "toxic" body blocking and chain blinding, or for having the audacity to stay behind in the end game to successfully save the 1 hook the killer has.
---
Agreed even after the rank reset changes it still isn’t enough. I like your idea and I want to branch out on it. What “color” rank you are you get reset to the previous “color”. And reset should be by seasons. 70-90 day season.
---
What if you’re a Claudette main with the attributes of an ace main
---
Just like getting it for wraith. Basically saying "dont use your power and be m1 and get looped for 3 mins. Cheers!"
---
STOP WITH THE DOCTOR JOKES
---
I hate tunneling but when i see a hook farmer i make an exception.
---
GibsAndPieces, Cahlaflour, and EdgarAlanBroLive are great too. KittyChipz if you’re cool with someone who is very excited all the time
---
i would say the most violent thing is moris
---
we did it with 2. the traps just have this weird burning coming off them so we basically sent the entire area on fire
---
Only if you get caught.
---
Thank you! :D
---
&lt;3
---
Why aren’t we funding this?
---
well its all a matter of knowing your limits for seeing violence
---
I hope they are
---
I, on the other hand, run injured to a gen in a time-sensitive situation and try to get it done with the teammate there, and instead they get off the gen stare at me working on the gen and teabag like it's the only button on the keyboard.
---
Fix the damn gen, heal after.
---
Hahaha I guess you don’t want them to fix it then
---
Might aswell add hand weapons and machine guns for the survivors to use to actually kill the killer ontop of everything else survivors can do to them.
---
I always recommend not running it because it makes people play like idiots. They think they have to heal constantly just because they can. Sometimes, your priorities should be elsewhere.
---
It also makes you play too confident and get yourself killed.
---
Maybe multiple ways to escape like the Friday the 13th game
---
Too much work gg
---
You're just bad at survivor if you think killer is easier. There's a reason most players are playing survivor and it's because it's more casual game play
---
Do you actually pay attention to whether its intentional or bug DC though? because both happen very frequently
---
Unless they slug you and let you bleed out on the ground for 5 minutes while they look for the other guy.
---
Good point
---
well tunneling is a viable strategy theres no point why you shouldnt do it unless your playing a killer who can oneshot
---
puppers is an adorable sweet man i always recommend him.
---
ardetha is a really good killer (especially nurse) and really damn funny so i recommend him too.
---
Aha, I'm a genius /s
---
Don't forget Entity'sLeftHand.
---
Spine Chill all the way. Gives much more precise info with no cooldown penalty
---
imagine thinking monto is the same as ochido skill wise
---
I hope they remember you
---
As a nurse main, I use Shadowborn mainly because it helps me track survivors better during fatigue and also during blinking as I can see more on my screen. I also like how it makes blinking feel soo much better since the base FOV makes blinking feel rather meh. It’s not necessary to play her, but it’s a nice perk to have.
---
It's not salt. I'm pointing out something that a lot of people here seem to be unaware of. Getting hit in the exit game twice doesn't save your team mate from being picked up. If anything, it only proves that the opponent didn't want to pick up Feng Min.
---
That’s my excuse whenever I do something illegal
---
I mean exhaustion hatchets are pretty fucking bullshit/annoying but fair enough
---
P1 Fen Ming main checking in here. 
---
(I've only had the game for like 2 months, I haven't yet had the time to prestige her past 1)
---
I would've done something like:
---
Why is Rin so happy right now?
---
Because she's in good SPIRITs.
---
might as well just try to use the chainsaw pretty stupid if you ask me
---
Username checks out
---
Pretty hot UwU
---
Even good killers/survivors pretty universally agree that survivors and killers are fairly balanced with killer being on the slightly easier side
---
Nothing changes huh lol
---
That's why I cried to myself and leveled up bill to get borrowed time (I hate leveling up characters which I won't play)
---
Its worth it at end games when killers are camping
---
what did the guy with the orange colored name say?
---
Meg for adrenaline, Wraith for prestige
---
Great on a 1vs1,  no map pressure gets rushed hard.
---
Well dont be sweaty or practice with a killer you're not good with so it's not so easy. Use different perk builds other than your meta. Dont use bbq, ruin or nurses. Take the opportunity to try different killers and builds!
---
That's how women are designed no ?
---
Or more like beer pack

This comment has way too many downvotes for literally no reason

Boy Freddie op

i bet it would be good with urban evasion

I just rund Bond or Empathy and Iron Will when I solo. No need for Self-Care :)
---
Movement speeds:
---
Base Killer: 115%
---
Huntress, Legion, or Hag: 110%
---
Run: 100%
---
Nurse: 96.25%
---
Walk: 56.25%
---
Crouch Walk: 28.25%
---
Crawling: 17.5%
---
That's hilarious
---
prove it, because as it stands, I've shown way more proof that he opposite view (that they DO care) is true.
---
You can. The one perk you really need is Iron Will, which you can unlock the teachable version of by getting Jake to level 30. That'll make you silent when injured and make it way easier to stay hidden or lose the killer.
---
Beyond that, the other stealth perks are basically for quality of life. Quick and Quiet and great but not necessary, as is Urban Evasion. You don't even need Distortion to hide your aura, you can just hop in a locker to hide your aura if you can identify which aura reading perks the killer has. Worst case scenario, you can always hide your aura by positioning yourself behind a generator. Your aura will not be visible through the generator's aura.
---
There's not really much more to say: the in-game settings are really rather lacking, and the only way to help yourself is using the .ini files.
---
Modifying the GameUserSettings.ini is not dangerous, because the game itself changes it constantly as well, and nothing in it can be used to malicious ends. In it, you can change the framerate cap (or remove it), disable vertical synchronization (which you should), and even achieve exclusive fullscreen mode (then being able to set your resolution properly). The GUS.ini also has graphics settings, which would enable you to more selectively choose the quality of specific graphical elements in the game, such as shadows, but unfortunately, the "ScalabilityLevel" variable overrides them all, and sets them to the preset values from the in-game menu.
---
There are various Unreal Engine variables that work from the Engine.ini, but messing with this file is risky, since the game does not usually write to it, and it can be used to malicious ends (such as removing fog). This file should be left alone, especially because any variables you would have to add yourself, actively modifying the game.
---
21:9 is already "supported", in as much as the game always scales vertical FOV to aspect rario, not horizontal. This is usually referred to as Vert-, as opposed to Hor+. This is not necessarily an oversight or lacking support, it's most likely an intentional decision the developers made to prevent people from using more rectangular aspect ratios to gain a competitive advantage. I mean, there are literal perks that widen the FOV, so being able to do so with a setting (on any monitor, at that - you can use any aspect ratio on any monitor) would be a pretty clear-cut advantage (gaining more vertical FOV with more square aspect ratios is still an advantage, but less clear-cut so). wsgf.org states that using an Engine.ini entry removes this horizontal FOV limitation, but according to my testing, this is not true (even with Engine.ini set to read-only).
---
Play the character Claudette Morel. 
---
Use the perks Spine Chill, 
---
Calm Spirit(Jake Park Perk), 
---
Urban Evasion (Nea Karlsson Perk), 
---
Iron Will (Jake Park Perk)
---
Just add a 10min ban from being able to play.
---
DO you lose points for camping? In what way??
---
Indeed
---
i guess you are joking right?
---
I dont think it should be used for avoiding toxic killers cause of how the system could be abused so perhaps it couls be used to avoid toxic teammates?
---
That effectively means they're shitting on the floor and shuffling out of embarrassment.
---
"no real counter except for the counter"
---
lmfaoooo
---
Use lockers when someone is about to get hooked. 
---
Distortion is a dlc perk.
---
Lightweight.
---
Learn how to hide behind an unfixed gen when someone is about to be hooked. 
---
Sprint burst.
---
Hope.
---
Adrenaline.
---
Empathy can help you see the killer if he is chasing.
---
Quick and quiet.
---
Those are just a few. I do suggest you atleast learn the looping mechanic and be a teamplayer. You will be sorely disappointed if you play like hide and seek. Good killers will find you no matter what.
---
Ooh okay I had never though about the generator hiding! I will try that. I do currently run quick &amp; quiet to hop into lockers but even then sometimes killers make a beeline to my locker across the map so maybe thats just unlucky?
---
How nice of you to assume that I play in this way just because you don't like being slugged. I got news for ya. Ready? No one likes being slugged. The devs have already said that 1. it isn't against the rules and 2. it isn't holding the game hostage. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's against the rules or that it's even reportable. You can go fuck all the way off now. ✌
---
I try to get in when teammates are hooked now as well
---
Thanos killer confirmed

All killers are virgins though so it balances out in the end.

---
I second Puppers! His stream is always extremely interactive, he has his own currency where you can redeem it to play live soundbites, have him play with specific builds, gamble, etc.
---
This is the only non-serious post I've done! I just felt like shitposting. But I shall downvote it myself and help to heal the community
---
The dude is a huge dick. The first time and immediately the last time I ever watched him was only because he showed up as a "recommended" streamer to watch because I follow puppers and I also stream DBD. So as I'm sitting there watching one of his subs and fans asks how do you make money streaming. I'll just let this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractivePoorHamDxCat) explain the rest. Not only just that, he thinks he knows everyone on the game. His ego is bigger than his head and certainly bigger than the amount of followers and subs he has.
---
Every time I see his name mentioned anywhere online no one ever has anything good to say about him. The first time I ever seen anyone here post about him was that he banned someone after they subbed to him. Fuck this dude and everything about him.
---
Rancor or dying light
---
[you mean this?](https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractivePoorHamDxCat)
---
Im a claudette main and i am proud
---
would 6 vs 2 be optimal?
---
Yeah angrypug is just a middle age unfunny toxic piece of shit, I can’t believe he’s a whisperer.
---
I know that most companies have separate groups of those that design content, those that implement content, and those that fix pre-existing content. So if you know that the BHVR team bounces between design, implementation, and patches, I guess I don’t know how they work.
---
I’m critical on their design philosophy focusing on adding content to one monetized mode. If you’re telling me they’re too busy working on regular mode to make a custom mode, that’s fine I guess but my opinion is that a goof around custom mode can keep people engaged and prevent burnout 🤷‍♂️
---
I started with Nea because I wanted to play Stealth too. I started with Urban Evasion, then worked my way up to getting Light weight, Dark sense and Premonition. So I basically just worked gens and turn around using Premonition to check if killer is coming, if he is then urban evade away, otherwise finish the gen, see killer with dark sense, move away from killer's direction and work on another gen and repeat. After I got urban evasion as a teachable I moved on to Meg to get Sprint Burst and Quick and Quiet instead so I can run off quicker.
---
Buy jeff the survivor. His perk distortion has 3 tokens and blocks the killer being able to see you with their aura perks for those tokens.
---
I’m like a chad ace main except I play nea for the nifty cosmetics and urban evasion.
---
This shits boring.
---
We get it, you can have multiple killers in a game.
---
We don’t need 50 posts daily regurgitating the same ‘joke’ over and over again.
---
Yeah, but when you can't see the person, it can be hard to tell. I've gotten people message me over those games like I rage quit DC'd, and I'm like "dude, I had JUST hit someone like, a tenth of a second before it happened, so it obviously wasn't an intentional DC as I was in an active chase"
---
I ... actually doubt that. 
---
“My private parts were exposed” is not the same as “My private parts were vulnerable”.
---
What do you feel about not leaving at the end of a match just to taunt the killer?
---
No I’m pretty sure by the time they started making unique killers they already stopped because like nobody uses them
---
The new d-strike buff looks good !
---
Make sure to hop in before they are hooked or they will be able to see you go into it if they are running BBQ.
---
They either see a couple scratch marks or a generator with no sign of survivor and just decide to check a locker. I do it a lot.
---
Hmmmmm...
---
I think I wouldn't mind trying that too.
---
Sure. But one shouldn’t restrict themselves, especially if it can result in others learning something new. Also, you gotta think, this term caught on insanely fast, even with people not getting it, it’s simple and not serious. This isn’t an insult, but you are quite possibly one the only people to have ever reacted negatively to it. It just seemed you were on edge and ready to take an insult, you you took that and ran with it kinda. Have a good day.
---
Yet how often do you hear about survivors complaining about Killer's made up rules on forums?
---
&gt; Walking does not leave scratch marks. 
---
Did that recently change?
---
Last thing I remember was that walking leaves a small trail, and crouching left nothing (otherwise why crouch at all).
---
Oh, a DP?
---
I watch Pug's stream when I want to watch someone just fuck around in dbd. He basically doesn't give a shit and plays however he thinks is fun. Some of what he does can be considered toxic, but overall I think he is just enjoying himself. I personally don't really care if he's toxic or not. While it's not how I play the game, he can play it as he wants. His teammates have every right to and SHOULD report him if they feel he ruined their games.
---
It would actually need to be more survivors. I think 10, it's the number of generators I'm uncertain of. Then there's the issue of map size. Most current maps simply could not accommodate this.
---
I play claudette but I've only played to have fun soo
---
Because it’s time to be happy not salty
---
Legion rework coming in bois! Yayyy
---
maybe have separate hooks for each killer. the point goes to the one who died to the other killers hook
---
Not a bug, this "hide behind gates and NOED em" exists for a long time now
---
I hope you are good at evading and looping 🙂 With over 500+ hours I ve seen only 2 survivors been really good with this perk. You’re eventually going to be found and in that case you better be a master looper!
---
Me too. I've met some Clauds that are shitty like this but I try to just do my objective and leave? I don't have fun trying to taunt the killer or some shit. Mostly cause I'm not good enough to back it up and will just die. Haha.
---
Children? Nah i dont think so, teenagers = the legion.
---
Or just looking down while using bloodhound oh God... I just accept defeat and die on first hook against moonwalking legion.
---
Adorable!
---
Perhaps if Laurie Strode is the same age as in the movie and also according to her in-game lore
---
"You never know what really matters in life until you've realized it might end soon. Laurie is one of those who just wants a quiet life in the suburbs, hanging out with friends, family and maybe go on a date or two. Laurie is a typical teenager. You could pass her on the street and not think twice. She does her homework and is liked by her friends, teachers and family. A simple night of babysitting turns into something that will forever change the course of her young life. A knife swooshing through the air. Screams from afar. Noises that plays tricks with her mind. But not Laurie, she’s made of something stronger. Something that won't give up."
---
No. It specifically takes people over 21 so DBD is allowed in other countries with laws against showing violence against underaged people.
---
So you can just hide behind exit gates? Oh wow
---
Thats probably should be fixed? Or... I don't know isnt it a bit too extreme tho? Just blink and hit them
---
Especially if its God they slandered.
---
God me either. I've only ever gotten a flashlight blind like twice in 700+ hours. Such a loser. Haha
---
It's not a bug, it's totally intended. If you want something fun, give NOED and Insidious a try. You won't win, but you'll give someone a good scare.
---
Thank you!
---
u//w//u
---
Haha alright then
---
#NO
---
Is it hard to believe that survivors with probably 10x your hours are so much better than you that they consider you bad? It has nothing to do with the relative strength of the sides, and everything to do with how your personal skill level matches up against yours.
---
That said, I don't understand why people bully baby killers. It doesn't make me happy to do, so I'll always defend the new killer in postgame.
---
Laurie Is not 21
---
Botany Knowledge, We'll Make It, Aftercare, and Pharmacy for a cool medic build.
---
F*****g hell i was! Just got home from work and was gonna accidentally destroy my remaining data. Thanking you.
---
Points, especially cooperative dailies.
---
Do not! This is a masterpiece
---
Nah, its good for the jumpscares.
---
This exists since she was added, i think.
---
Otzdarva also did this on one of his DBD videos, you can go and check it out!
---
Immersed Gen Jockey Feng main reporting in.  I hate BMing killers, although I jokingly call myself toxic because I just do the gens.
---
Groovy.
---
Ruin is almost mandatory if you don't want to be stressed af. Until gen speed is fixed I don't mind it.  
---
I hate NOED. It lets horrible killers with no skills to higher ranks and it's super unfair. And I am not a survivor main ;)
---
Rare Tapp main here, I can confirm. I run AITH and Plunderer's most the time and give people the items from the chests I search, or I run a gen jockey build if I'm wearing the jacket. If I'm wearing the vest, it's WMI, Borrowed Time, an insta-heal and bodyblocks inbound. 
---
Source: My steam name is Detective T A P P for a reason.
---
Legion is both op, but at the same time weak. With the right perks and the op add ons (franks mixtape, stab wounds study, etc) legion is impossible to beat, but without that and against good survivors, you're probably going to have 4 escape or be lucky and get a kill. That is if people don't dc the minute they see you playing legion lol
---
Thanks!
---
I think people just don’t encounter good Freddy’s that much. Like it amazes me that people complain about Frank’s Mixtape on Legion but don’t complain about Class Photo on Freddy. You can literally just always keep everyone asleep unless they are on 4 different corners of the map. Even then it’s still extremely helpful.
---
Legacy Jake takes that title, probably.
---
They also give so many BPs
---
Mori rituals are the best
---
Nope. Happened to me and my friend. Blood points and character levels reverted. I'm gonna send a support ticket I think
---
Yea I do switch back and forth from time to time depending on how confident I feel on skill checks and getting away, thanks for the tip still :)
---
Yeah, if a Tapp doesn't wear the hat, the chances that they'll be an issue to you as a killer is mighty slim. They are not enlightened. Now, if they're wearing a bloody vest and they're bald...good luck keeping your hooks.
---
Monto is a wonderful man. An absolute joy to watch, truly.
---
I cant stand him. Everything about his personality irritates me
---
Go with HybridPanda or Puppers
---
Sucks if played as intended, good if you funnel and abuse chase mechanic. Even with scummy tactics you’ll get a max of two kills.
---
How is it a trope before TCM if it happened in real life? Real life doesn’t have “tropes”.
---
If a claud wears the beanie and jacket, they're probably cool. If it's one or the other, it's shaky.
---
How dare you hack on console! It’s people like you that ruin the game for everyone!
---
IKR! I love his meme builds, like burger king myers.
---
I’m sorry 😪😪😪
---
Legion is not very good. People are frumpy because he's "not very fun to play against", a.k.a. he can quickly jump over pallets and over windows. The only real strategy against him is to stay alone and far away from others and hide, and people absolutely despise that. He's nowhere near comparable to other killers, unless he abuses bugs.
---
Unforgivable!
---
It is a lot of fun with Sole Survivor :D
---
She went to a university so she's 18-21.
---
Nurse with NOED. I have no questions.
---
Was this today? im not home rn, so i cant check my game.
---
Why do you want bloodpoints nerfed? I agree that we should have five now but I dont know why you'd want less bp
---
Just noticed the legion mask on the lamb
---
I love playing as clown, he is my favorite killer. Like others have said his map pressure isn’t the best so I like using surveillance so I know which gens people are working on so I waste less time. Pop goes the weasel and ruin are good too on him. 
---
Lately tho I’ve been using surveillance/pop goes the weasel/spirit fury/enduring and occasional swap out pop for ruin. I feel like that set of perks helps with his weaknesses and plays to his strength at the same time.
---
Quinten, Laurie, and Legion are all under 18. Quinten could be slightly above 18.
---
Yesterday around 9:30
---
Not everyone has that mindset though.
---
none theres no perk in this game that doesnt have a counter.
---
...17 year olds can be gay lmao
---
Or they can keep them but make them activate after being hooked twice. If anything I'd prefer getting mori'd on what would be my death hook.
---
Purely for the points/emblem score, unless the killer is nowhere close and someone might need to be saved, of course.
---
Don’t be foolish of course they can’t
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
They’re a different breed
---
As an Ace main, I can confirm that this confirmation of a confirmation is 100% genuine. Well done.
---
Nurse is top tier solely because she breaks the game in the hands of a skilled player.
---
A tier would consist of Billy, Hag, Spirit and Huntress.
---
B and C tend to shift between tier lists depending on the person writing it. Legion falls in C tier on most (I think).
---
D tier usually has Wraith, Leatherface, and Trapper.
---
F tier is always Freddy.
---
I’ve only been playing the game for like 2 months and don’t have every killer, so take this with a grain of salt. This is just observations from the multiple tier lists that pop up on this sub every other week &amp; youtube videos.
---
i personally like going against a ruin because i feel like it makes me a better survivor learning how to land great skillchecks but i dont go against hex ruin that much on survivor because i usually stay around rank 10 to 15 or so
---
*hehehehe!*
---
She still had Twitter for a while but it was private, but looks like that's gone now too. Very odd :(
---
Lmao back when I played that game I was playing nurse and I did the same thing and watched videos on my phone for like 10 mins and they didn't leave so i quit the game didn't care like really going to wait 10 mins for me to chase u at the end get the fuck out!
---
Wait feral frenzy stacks on third seal or no? If it does then it's probably really good but legion being shit, he can't really protect its totems
---
Okay so now i need to inform you people who love to jump on people for USING A WORD. Let me ask did you see anything that looked REMOTELY like i was being tunneled? NO. This was a 52 second video of a probably 10 min game. But because i used a word you had to freak out. It's people like this that make this community so salty and annoying. I was tunneled off the hook twice. I managed to escape and that's why i was injured on the gen. The dude wanted me bad and for me to escape like this was impressive to me
---
Salty much  you get called out due to toxic play and your salt shows
---
I think i have tried that and all it does is just make the game smaller. With the desktop all around it.
---
Pretty impressed with BHVR for reworking Freddy and I'm looking forward to see how he turns out. I assume they're just testing the water with Legion for now because they haven't been out that long.
---
I'm excited to see what the changes for end game will be. Hopefully fun and engaging stuff for both sides.
---
Really happy they are adding cancelling games with less than 5 people. It's just not fun with only 3 or 2 survivors.
---
As a Jake Main, I can confirm that this confirmation of a confirmation of a confirmation of a confirmation is 100% genuine. Well done.
---
Just gonna copy and paste my other reply for you...
---

the truck escape is to OP 
---
i mean sally clearly lost the chase at the end but kept running even though she got hit more than twice! 
---
thats not fair to the killer and she didnt deserve a free escape in the form of a truck 
---
someones gotta nerf that
---
its unfair to the killers
---
i solo queue alot so sometimes i do, but sometimes i bring hope instead
---
I think it would not work,  especially a KWF would be too OP, imagine 2 killers chasing you, one on one side of the window/pallet, the other on the other.  one hits you the other keeps chasing you.
---
I more mean killers. No ones going to recognize him as the guy from Saw.
---
pasted from other reply:
---
  I was tunneled off the hook twice. I managed to escape and that's why i was injured on the gen. The dude wanted me bad and for me to escape like this was impressive to me
---
Is it necessary to post on here? This community is toxic from top to bottom. No need to spread it further or try to ge sympathy
---
Yeah, been thinking this, or maybe it is not a bug and they just want to know how it goes.
---
If we're going to keep suggesting DBD content creators, I cannot suggest Farmer John enough. He's hilarious, friendly in-game, and his voice is beautiful. Criminally underrated, go check him out.
---
Yeah got lucky. and i got tunneled off the hook twice, was dead on hook but i managed to escape him, that's why i was injured. he wanted me bad. the whole game lol
---
Yeh, I'm sometimes the one behind the Killer's screen and I appreciate people that play the game, not be jerk.
---
Ill go ahead and post the whole reply i gave to someone else for ya:
---
Is this what “digital blackface” means?
---
Legion isn’t bad unless they’re being scummy.
---
really love this video , some good tips and good explanation about choice 
---
for me who just start play seriously at this game, this a good exemple of what to do.
---
The Leatherface using Insidious in the basement is a legitimate strategy
---
😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
---
Lore-wise, that may actually be true...? Except Freddy. \*shudders\*
---
(oh, and Nurse was married)
---
OH MY GOD
---
Fuck those guys.  I don't get it either.  They have to be survivor mains, because once you feel that pain as a killer you realize just how asinine it is.  Stroke your e-peens with someone who's actually impressed, I just want to play the game.

I attack the sandbagger instead of the one just unhooked and i recently got an angry message from a sandbagger lol

It's beautiful, wow!

I'm crying of laughter

They called her a thot because they wanted to attack her for being a woman. But she is pretty hypocritical and whiny and has done some questionable things like encouraging disconnecting

Uh we posted basically the same thing

The only one salty is you because you can't accept the fact that it isn't a reportable offense.

Of course, because parents wouldn't allow it.

You're trippin bruh and you make some really weird assumptions about people. Anyway i'm just gonna cut this short cause your halfway valid points don't bring any value to really anything. Particularly my kinda cool clip of adrenaline timing just right. Good luck out there dawg

Not for me, I keep losing pips. Also I thought once you’re past 15 you can’t get lower but yet I’m at 16... it’s like it’s punishing me for DC’ing when I didn’t...

The same rule applies to the survivor as well. The problem is the two, stubborn-ass people who just stand there and stare at each other for absurd amounts of time.

I love Duking Killers

I may be wrong, but I believe that we’ll make it doesn’t stack with other healing bonuses anymore.
---
The only killers that can consistently deal with 4 man SWF squads are Nurse, Spirit, and Billy. You'll always be in a time crunch against those squads, so you need a killer that can apply constant pressure and not get stuck in loops.
---
That’s rank reset for you lol
---
Oh yeah. I forget what emblem it’s under but you get deductions for “Proximity to hooked survivor.” Not blood points but it’ll hurt your ranking eventually. You’ll usually get at least a 1-3% deduction just because there’s usually a pallet or generator near a hook.
---
Bro not gonna lie that walking 360 was nice lol
---
It’s so satisfying
---
I got really close like 2 years ago (if the RR had been like one day later...), and still kind of want to get it eventually but, besides being mediocre, I just don't play enough games in a month. It's stressful, man.
---
But he is trash at loops, he needs that speed.
---
exactly. saying that someone cant do something because they have specific genitals is sexist.
---
Let me start by saying (of course), I'm a survivor main. I don't think items (medkits, flashlights, etc.) should be in the bloodweb. Don't know what would replace them, and I don't like add-ons either. It's more fun to play without items. Only have items in in-game chests. (Before anyone says it, I know it would cause hell with balance.)
---
Ah well, I'm gonna keep running it anyway
---
I've never been burned like I have by a legacy dwight with dweard.
---
i see, i see
---
People who use mlga to block pings of \*Even legion players, don't get me wrong - fuck Legions but they are apart of the game and if someone wants to play it? It's their right to do so.\* are scumfucks, the whole point of MLGA was to block hackers/exploiters and generally toxic people, not someone who gives you a hard game.
---
Just hide in a locker dude
---
Why is it always survivors get the hatch? Lol 
---
I usually just give it to them but the few times I’m like ok let’s see how long they will last and sure enough they will sit there forever like it’s owed to them
---
Haha cheers mate.
---
Don't know how that happened if I'm being honest.
---
Personally I use borrowed time instead of aftercare it's so fun and satisfying
---
He is super loopable. He has no anti-looping, the only thing that make him not a complete garbage at loops is that he can get to you faster so sometimes you can;t skip pallets to leave them on later.
---
Don't they though? Only for the killer to suddenly appear/burst through something and grab them.
---
When I first started the game, I thought Exposed meant that the Killer could see me, not that I could get downed with one hit. It’s a bit too vague I think.
---
My favorite is zubat and edgar, edgar have a lot things to entertain chat, and just nice man, and zubat is just awesome player, lot of fun on streams, kind person, 99% of time talking with chat, great emotes he is just my favorite, also watching puppers, someone always gifted me sub on him lol, but i dont like so much positivity, im adult to believe in such positivity, but still nice bald streams, emotes are great and cute too, vincentvega is nice kkona man too, enjoying his police brutality as bubba always
---
Really really nice,i especially love the boot and shirt, the red and yellow blend very well.
---
true but it is what it is
---
Mount Ormond Legion Country, worst place in the world.
---
What are you trying to show me? This is OC and I haven’t seen that post before.
---
Then go legion
---
I have two Myers offering on Myers lol
---
&gt; but it’s almost positively the story they took the idea from 
---
So you're a mind reader? TCM didn't start the trope and meat hooks have been around longer than that. You have no reason to believe this other than your feelings.  
---
&gt; considering every single character in the game is based on some horror film trope/character or another. 
---
Yea putting people up on meat hooks and treating them like animals has been a trope in horror for a long time. It's 100% taken from the trope.
---
What if your internet just randomly shuts off because thats what happens to me once every week?
---
&gt; Real life doesn’t have “tropes”.
---
I thought "trope" just meant basically "recurring pattern or theme". Not that it was limited to fiction.
---
I have two. 
---
1. NOED is a penalty for not completing dull totems. If every survivor cleansed on sight, they wouldn't deal with NOED 90% of the time. 
---
2. The definition of tunneling is too broad. Teammates are partly responsible for safely extracting the hooked survivor from the area. If the killer keeps finding you and downing you quickly, you're an easy target. A killer isn't going to keep going after someone that leads them on long chases. Improve.
---
I prefer watching the whole match from start to finish. I cant watch the people that just cut around.
---
It's great, props to them for this level of detail.
---
Only if there was a rule (rule 7) to remove these shitty self promoting posts.
---
Welcome to red ranks
---
That's fair.
---
Only person I watch who does full matches is Hyprid Panda.
---
I love Mikey Mike but he is sort of like the doctor, his power is amazing, but wow the add ons are a whole new level. Scratched mirror and lerys is just something a lvl 1 Micheal can't appreciate, just keep trying it's worth it
---
This is a video I made for fun with one of my most funny/wtf games (that I happened to record by pure luck). The most crazy thing about it is that is was SWF.
---
I hope you enjoy :)
---
im in green/purple ranks
---
Not really, only if they use the exploit
---
Reddit probably not the place to ask about this. try the official DBD forums, or submitting a support ticket.
---
I got plunder, ace in the hole, ds, and self-care
---
I did and sadly they responded saying they couldn't.
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight
---
I watch tru3talent he does killer and survivor full matches
---
THERE we go
---
Enduring, for pallets and decisive, nurses calling bc pig can crouch and has a small trope radius anyway, ruin to relive some pressure and slow gene down, BBQ and chili to locate survivors on far away gene and know when to pick a chase and if survivors are close (if nobody shows up on BBQ all survivors are close so stay around the hook)
---
Yeah in all seriousness, the devs are hopefully working on it. There should be major system changes by the end of the year, in some form or another
---
She gets the dick in the next panel.
---
*juke
---
God no.
---
It's sentiments like this that gets in the way of improvement. Being a little more positive wouldn't hurt. 
---
I really think a DBD jail would really deter bad behavior cuz no one wants to be placed in low priority matches that can sink you further into low priority.
---
This is beyond science
---
At high ranks most people work through ruin gens anyway. I've had a lot of games where ruin wasn't found but 3 or 4 people still escape out the gates.
---
It’s just a visual bug. If you brought in an item and either used it up or switched it for a new item during the match. 
---
If either of these happened that’s why it says item lost.
---
Fam I am trying to main nurse too on pc, it's so hard plus with these bs match making, I a rank 14 killer is getting matched with rank 8 and 9s, the bullying never stops.
---
Do what I do
---
For nurse you basically have to play addon less if you don't have any BP oriented peeks like BBQ or distressing or anything which increases your BP, just DC when both of the exit games are opened and they're bming you while sliding over the pallet
---
Until the exit gates just practice your blinks
---
Happy hunting mate
---
Her base perks like surveillance and make your choice are good for her. Overcharge paired with surveillance is also good. Either than that the meta - BBQ and nurses. Beyond that, depending on what you build, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin, NOED.
---
I’m trying to show you just remade a meme for karma. Also you must’ve seen it since you commented on this subreddit the same day the meme was posted. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/avblls/end_game_chat_salt_is_just_great/ehee5qd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
More meant that you should replace botany knowledge. Kinda redundant together
---
The few people who’ve downvoted this post are probably the sandbaggers. If that’s any indication.
---
At this point most survivor mains are expecting ruin and if they have at least half a brain they can work through at least 1-2 gens while someone is hunting down the Ruin.
---
Why do you know baby shit is soft?
---
Yea pretty much lol I don’t have the patience to stand there that long and I’m pretty sure the survivor would wait all day then say I’m holding the game hostage
---
Dont forget the bass boost.
---
Awww shit I didn’t even realise I want to die
---
You are giving them the right to jump on conclusions though,with you providing no context in the comments from the get-go to avoid confusion. Also, if you have actually been playing this game for some time you would know people playing it  freak out and use words incorrectly, so people assumed (rightly may i add,due to you failing to provide any info) that you were such a person, miss-using the word tunnel.
---
In my opinion ruin ,bbq , save the best for last , sloppy butcher, are good for him especially save the best for last you need to try it 
---
My opinion on him is he's good fun to play not much to say about him other than that.
---
He’s gonna be my side killer.
---
Fun to use, but he’ll never be my main
---
how dare tunnel me with your very existence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Add we’re gonna live forever instead of deliverance
---
🐷🐷🐷
---
I fucking love you and your way of playing, TEACH ME SENPAI HOW TO GET  GOOD AT NURSE.
---
Me cause I'm bad, not a high rank though.
---
That's a good and fair point but I'd say it's because they're fun and cool. Maybe the first person can be mori'd right away like an ivory mori, but the others have to be on death hook.
---
COLDWIN FARMS - "*There are no children under the stairs"*

Any changes to matchmaking wait times? I wait over 30 min to get a half full lobby! After an hour I can’t fill a lobby still!
---
Same but also gah damn right there for anyone to just see.
---
Admitting it doesn't excuse it though.
---
To acknowledge you're a shithead, while continuing to be a shithead...
---
Yeah something it’s glitching. You’re right about not being able to go below 15, with the exception of rank reset of course. Hopefully they fix so you won’t quit losing pips :/
---
there should be an ace cosmetic without his glasses
---
This just happened in a random match. I joined, heard a chainsaw and a Bear trap go off together. What's happening?
---
Thought that too. It's confusing, they mean exposed as in unprotected, rather than revealed
---
The ability to see blood is an ultra rare for a reason: It's super powerful. Don't do that.
---
Thought about it but I'd rather the added benefit of helping the match over bonus blood points.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/49456/optimization-status-update-road-to-60fps
---
It's one shot down. Killer has no idea where you are while exposed
---
A bug to do with KYF I’m pretty sure, apparently someone called Paulie Esther made a video on it, which you can check out
---
FUCKING RUN FOR THE HILLS
---
It's still good for when I bring a medkit into the match though.
---
well i think the prayer beads should be ultra rare because they are easily her most powerful add on and it makes no sense to make it purple to me
---
console happened
---
Since no one is going to watch the full video, it should be pointed out that the person who asked this question had “thestreamer” in thier twitch username. Blatantly obvious this persons intention was to advertise themselves as a steamer in Pugs chat. He got exactly what he deserved.
---
nope, always.
---
Yes, the hatch is super broken. The Killer is punished for playing a good game with the existence of the hatch. If the Killer finds the hatch first, they are punished for it. It's a broken mechanic that they tried to fix at one point, but all the whiny crybaby Survivor mains didn't let the change go through.
---
If He's doing this as bait to lure in curious survivors then it's a Trapped Trap Trapper Trap.
---
Thanks buddy I have bbq so I don't want to lose the BP and even with it I think about it sometimes.
---
Yeah I think both are great and I switch them out regularly. Aftercare just synergies so much with the build and I usually safe hook more often so it fits better with my play style over borrowed.
---
Because I commented on a different post I *have* to have seen the other post? How am I remaking a meme for karma? If I was, I would’ve remade it the same day, not two months after the memory of it has cleared from my mind. What you’re saying makes no logical sense.
---
Yeah with bloodhound you'd never get away.
---
trap feng
---
1. Frustration makes you better. Not everyone gets a trophy. Not everyone wins. 
---
2. No one said the game is dead. But this game will die if things aren’t fixed. You can’t really compare DbD to F13. F13 didn’t die due to bugs, wait times or anything of that nature. It flopped due to legal rights. The only problem F13 had that was major was the server crashes when the game first game out, but that was because no one expected it to be as popular. Mind you- when it was playable, it soared past DbD.
---
They will. They always save the best for last.
---
Dude I would love some causal matches instead of the usual ranked ones if devs ever develop that or just a kyf version where you the killer is only present checking out the map or practicing
---
Nah it'll lose sometimes regardless. 
---
I once lost a purple key with the add on to keep it on death. I escaped while holding the key through the gates. Never put it down or hit by Franklin's. The key and add on were gone from my inventory.
---
As stated above, this person brought up a streaming question because they were a streamer (or a wannabe streamer I should say). It’s a method of advertising. Perfect example of what I was talking about.
---
Well I’m also taking into account that one of their original killers was very very heavily based on Leatherface.
---
Looks good. Keep it up!
---
So you're a mind reader. Okay dude.
---
Strange. I could’ve sworn this was only a visual glitch.
---
Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound is unnecessary as the blood is already glowing hot red in the spirit world.

---
The fact that you said ‘oh god’ makes part of me want to know, and brain and stomach not want to know.
---
I dunno. I kinda support the idea of needing to hook everyone before mori's activate. It discourages tunneling, gives survivors more of a chance while also being pretty strong.
---

---
This motherfucker is moring me &gt;:(
---
Pls take my flashlight
---
Not mine
---
Yup my bad for thinking people might understand that there's clearly no tunneling in this video. i should've known this is a perfect opportunity for people to call me stupid for using a word. I've been in this community for awhile, i know how unreasonable a lot people can be. i'm hoping people will one day be reasonable and hopefully ill be the one leading the revolution...pipe dreams /:
---
I'm Claudette main because of the invisibility yet I'm aiming to be friendly both as killer and as survivor. As survivor I really like mixing builds and trying perks synergies.
---
Good meme tho
---
I can’t even fill a lobby, much less load into a game. I’ll wait hours as killer and get at most 3 survs in the lobby, not in game!
---
It's not mine, but I'll tell her
---
What colour is it?
---
Thank you! I'm really glad you like it! I think my favorite part is the boar mouth. :3
---
how about 6 or 10 seconds
---
Dude, run smallgame. Now I know what you’re gonna say 
---
“You’re a killer main, of course you say just do totems.” 
---
But trust me, since I started running it on survivor NOED has been an absolute joke to me
---
The latest Drunk by Daylight where Monto found 4 keys and they got sloshed...  Good times.
---
maybe survivor streamers should not have started their disconnecting campaign that the community went all in on
---
"One of the hardest" =/= hard. 
---
1 out of 10, which is an exaggerated figure you made up, with a sample size of, say, 100 Nurse players (I'm allowed to make up numbers too) still means 10 players will absolutely shit on your day no matter what you and your team do or bring. That isn't balanced. 
---
Stop making excuses. Difficulty and rarity =/= balanced or fun.
---
10 games , 9 games with 3 or less survivors. Fix your spaghetti code already.
---
that would be actually somewhat useful for mindgames. a small improvement.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Myers was really rough to use at first and still is if you take a hiatus from the game. But GAWD DAMN do you feel powerful when you get him figured out.
---
On Lerys when Noob was looking for the hatch and just finds Monto sitting there.
---
I mean in the same way The Pig is The Wraith except crouching instead of invisibility, then I guess?
---
“Ha! I found the hatch first! Oh... you fucker.”
---
We could, but it's in a pretty good place right now. As a survivor, you have the power to stop it from ever activating by taking some time to cleanse the totems. If all five are cleansed before the gates are powered, NOED will never activate.
---
some small changes i'd like to see (outside of infinite load screen and whatnot)
---
* allow last survivor to struggle, or give them a BP bonus for being the last hooked survivor
---
* fix hatch standoff (annoying)
---
* have a daily for killer AND survivor. this would promote play on both sides, and help people who refuse to play one or the other
---
* two dailies on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (promotes more players)
---
* Lower prices on customizations. $10 for an outfit? i just can't justify it.
---
I love Monto but he camps and tunnels A LOT.
---
Fake phase at a vault. Sometimes the person will think you're phasing and will vault to you for a free hit. Things like that. Doesn't always work. I'm sure you will get better tips but mind gaming with any killer is just about watching and predicting the survivors and making moves they don't expect. Usually best to use line of sight to your advantage and hiding your red stain helps. Not really spirit tips but just trying to help :p
---
Bro, he said TCM was the inspiration not the origin.
---
&gt;The movie where Leatherface originated from and **served as inspiration** for Hillbilly plus sacrifices by meathooks.
---
No need to flex your obscure serial killer knowledge.
---
Yeah it's just a roll back I had my p3 pig lose her bbq &amp; chilli rank 3. I Had it at lvl 34 and didn't get it until about 12-17 bloodwebs after lvl 50. It's dumb.
---
YESSSSS
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Mouse button 2, right click. It's the killer power activation key on PC, just a shorthand way to refer to using your power
---
what happened to your screenshot?
---
Thanks for that
---
&gt; i think the add on for the spirit to see blood while using her power should be apart of her kit.
---
too strong
---
&gt; and for a trade off make prayer beads an ultra rare add on
---
prayer beads should be changed so that it flips - you hear her phase in her terror radius but not out of it. devs will have to fix the breaking glass sound first, though
---
&gt; sole survivor now works the same way as thanatophobia mixed with how the perk works now
---
not sure what you mean
---
&gt; beast of prey is now activated the same way as deadhard but lasts for 3 seconds
---
Should be a little longer
---
You get more points too
---
His fight against Pitou during the Chimera Ant arc.
---
What a kind lad
---
Yeah that happens to me too, like I can't be woken up by a teammate vs a Freddy, but that's rare. I think some people play like "evil Dwight."
---
These are the same players that crouch in corners and wait for Sprint Burst before moving and camp at pallets. 
---
The vast majority of this game are fucking garbage. Less than 50% are halfway decent. Even fewer are solid players. And then there are a handful of GOOD players. 
---
The amount of people good at survivor and the amount good at killer are actually pretty even. Which is funny since there are far more survivor players.
---
I mean ANY chase scene. I was watching a jet Li movie the other day, and I kept seeing spots where he could easily juke the baddies chasing him. 
---
It took me weeks to stop doing that on she's and movies.
---
Okay? Will do?
---
The fuck? Lmao
---
Noob3 farmer john monto and hybrid panda
---
Sloppy Butcher seems to be the general consensus, and I'll agree with that one. Franklin's is on the list a lot too. I've noticed that no one has put Discordance. Which is very annoying. Especially if you're a solo and you've figured out they have it but no one else has. A rando walks up to the gen you're on and starts working with you. Usually that's a good thing, but now the killer is on their way and we aren't going to finish this gen. Thanks Dwight.
---
oh damn that's dark
---
You just told me the Pig was like the Wraith. Im done x'D
---
Just git gud newb
---
&gt; Bro, he said TCM was the inspiration not the origin.
---
Bro, he has no reason and no ability to know where the idea was taken from specifically and it's not obvious where it came from because it wasn't near an original idea.
---
&gt; No need to flex your obscure serial killer knowledge.
---
If you think bringing up relevant information is just flexing serial killer knowledge, then I can already tell you're not getting anywhere here.
---
Which youtuber? I'd like to unsub from that shit if I'm sub'd. Fuck that shit :(
---
Pretty reasonable actually. Every time i run this people still get the trap off before the trap even activates. Seems reasonable to me. Boxes really aren't that hard to find, especially if you've already traveled around the map a little bit
---
It's not about perks here though, it's about experience. A more experienced player should be able to handle low rank survivors running self-care and UE without even needing perks. (That's also a giveaway that you're not facing SWF squads. No one takes those perks into a SWF game.)
---
Just focus on your own play, focus on improving as a player. Don't let bully squads get to you, tell them you are new. As long as you work to improve, you won't be bad forever. Perks and addons help, but ultimately it comes down to how well you play the game.
---
i see this at mid ranks too. somedays i can hit the skill checks with enough regularity to continue, other days i can't hit shit so i just bail and look for the totem.
---
if i'm feeling really lazy i'll tap. though i don't like to do so.
---
Not always.
---
/r/dbdgonewild in the house
---
Just ignore them man. They will still call you that no matter what, and if you play like they want (hooking a survivor then going to the other direction, far away and not hit him after they unhook him even if he is the firsr one you see) they will say "gg ez baby killer, l2p...etc." just enjoy their cries lol.
---
Just cleanse totems. 
---
With all the second chance perks nowadays, I dont blame killers for using it tbh. Downvote away.
---
yep, unless its a farming game, every single fucking legion ive ever played against had been a boring little prick.
---
Bruh I just David Duke’d the shit out of this killer
---
That's a good idea! A lot better than mine.
---
tunneling is going after the unhooked person and not the person unhooking. tunneling is the equivalent to working on different generators, it's playing efficient.
---
Yea I just like him enough to look past it that I just never notice
---
Oh, is that so? Have you read it? Try again. And on the way read Read rule 1. ;)
---
Well that's an individual basis. My point is that there are made up rules that some killers expect survivors to do, it isn't just survivor exclusive...
---
Of course.
---
At this point man just cleanse the totems.
---
My me and my buddies get to the last two gens then we break the 5 dulls to ensure there’s no noed.
---
If your solo queuing just take a few minutes to hunt down the 5 totems. 
---
No offense to anyone but if the killer gets noed it’s your fault for not getting the dulls.
---
Don't even need it. If every survivor just took the time to cleanse each totem they naturally came across the proc rate of NOED would drastically decrease.
---
Run Pharmacy and Ace in the Hole with Plunderers and set up shop in the basement
---
those are good changes but i think it would be hard to change hatch standoff since most of the time its better to  just let them escape because waiting half an hour for it is annoying and its just a waste of time and it sucks when your team is so bad they die within 5 minutes of the game starting.
---
the reason why prestiged tapp mains are annoying is because you trigger their vietnam flashbacks
---
Because his power is annoying at base. With certain addons he becomes OP and the devs take note of this, with the right addons and mindset, you can’t escape a legion. With just his base power, it feels like a chore to chase and hit people 3 times to down them with FF. Mine as well try to hit everyone with Feral like his power was SUPPOSED to work.
---
Omg I was, 6 gb!!!!
---
Or they can change ebonies so they allow you to kill 2 survivors instead of all 4
---
“ the controller has been disconnected “
---
A lot of killers cry way to much
---
Cool animation
---
Pig, Pig is the best for everything
---
Noo pig :( she’s trying her best
---
Haha I also play as Ace and Dwight.
---
&gt;  I could use things like facts and logic but no 
---
You really couldn't because the facts are that the devs have never come out and said their inspiration, meat hooks have been used in horror stories for much longer than when the TCM came out originally, and have been featured in other films before.  
---
The fact is none of you know where the inspiration came from and you can't know unless the devs that made it a feature in the game came out and said it. You only have feelings about this, no facts.
---
Agreed. Then make the add-on hide the auras of the boxes when it's powered unless you're within X meters of the box.
---
That's interesting way of looking at it. I like this but also it's not fair to guy getting hooked. he can't do anything about some brain dead teammate saving him. He didn't choose that teammate lol and now he gets hooked again and doesn't get to play
---
It is their friend's.
---
Make sure to put a tile of dirt blocking your doorto keep the zombies from breaking in.
---
i agree with all this but as a frequent solo queuer we can't help the teammates we find :'(
---
Your punishing the farmee.  They can't control the fact that a toxic troll survivor farmed them in front of you.  Some of us killers actually make a point to down and hook the trash farmer because that behavior has no place in this game and we don't need troll survivors to gift wrap our kills for us.  Some of us have the integrity to earn them ourselves.
---
Doctor and Legion are the best for farming you some blood points. Wraith can also give you a lot of points.
---
I used to use mgla, back when I cared about my rank and losing two pips. For yes, hackers/exploiters, but lagswitchers and campers. I ain’t talking proxy, strategy camp, I’m talking full on, straight “fuck you facecamp” because they remembered my name because I shit on them as a killer.
---
And it’s funny because look at the other comments, and people talk about how exhaustion hatchets should be gone, because they render a perk completely useless.
---
What is: Hex Perks...?
---
Claudette IS wholesome 😤 Do not confuse a Claudette with a prestiged outfit Claudette. Two different beings
---
Who says they can’t? Survs are stronger than killers if in a SWFs. You can’t tell me they weren’t SWFs they all joined at the same time
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAX-vHejHV4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAX-vHejHV4)

I knowww i feel bad doing this to killers but i'm just doing my job lol no teabags or BM just doing my thang
---
You don’t have to be sorry, you did nothing wrong by posting a meme.
---
You tryin to fight, huh?
---
"SARAH CAN YOU GET THE FKIN BABY I'M OVER HERE GETTING FKIN WREKT"
---
Tough to play as because he gets gen rushed so often it hurts. That minimal map pressure comes back to bite you so if you don’t get a couple early hooks then you could be in real trouble quickly no matter what you do in chases.
---
tbh? thats godlike
---
Exhaustion perks are pretty powerful to a certain degree, ability to distance and lose the killer, especially if in a crucial chase for the game.
---
Oh I love your idea.

Doc, Legion, and Freddy are BP whores.

To increase blood points use BBQ, Distressing, ToH (optional its a bare bones BP increase) if you have them.

I’d recommend using doc because he’s easier to use and way easier to cheese blood points also people are less likely to dc.
---
&gt;Because survivors get 7k for a hatch escape. Killers get ~1k in a match they already won. Why be greedy?
---
&gt; Get off this "everything the killer does is just and right" high horse you always preach. Jesus dude.
---
Is this what having no self-awareness looks like?
---
No one is any more entitled to the hatch than anyone else. If the Killer wanted it, they should have found the survivor first. If the survivor wanted it, they should have found the hatch first OR did a generator instead of rushing the hatch. If they both made it there they are both equally entitled to fight for it. It's a poorly designed game mechanic but no player has any obligation to give up the hatch.
---
&gt; high ranks
---
Reason number ∞ as to why it doesn’t matter.
---
I feel you. I only queue solo when I play survivor. A lot of players don't have good game awareness, unfortunately. Solo survivor is often painful.
---
I'm a P3 Claudette, wish I had done a P3 Feng or David though. The cosmetics aren't great on Claud. I am guilty of accidental sandbags. My viewers clip them and never let me forget. xD
---
I've been playing nurse on console for awhile and at first it was rough but i finally got pretty decent with her.. I love the panic those same survivors get when I land a blink and hit them and the panic sets in... they tend to be less cocky after that happens lol
---
I don't necessarily think he's as weak as people say but it's shit like this that just makes it so sad to be a freddy lol
---
She's adorable! What did you make her out of?
---
She is the best.
---
600 hours on PC and 0 on PS4 to be exact.
---
If you're going to abbreviate something as "OoO" At least let us know what it means one time. It's not like it come up every day.
---
I didn’t downvote. I only downvote idiotic comments. But hex perks can be taken away just as easily as exhaustion perks.
---
Ok, then they are trash SWFs or they aren't trying very hard. Is that what you want to hear? I don't believe you have the experience to make that determination accurately. 
---
The point of the post was to advise you to improve your own play and not worry about whether or not you're playing against a bully squad. 
---
SWF with good players trying hard is difficult to beat, but I guarantee you aren't going against that, because you didn't list their perks as Adrenaline, Dead Hard, (BT/DS/MoM: pick 2).  You aren't going to see that very often, so don't worry about it. Just play for yourself to get better at the game. ...Or don't, blame others for things outside your control and get frustrated. I don't care, really.
---
All camping leatherfaces are really just hardcore roleplayers.
---
Oh yeah, when he DCs in the loading screen you loose your offering but not your item
---
wtf lmao i'm not gonna go into who's wrong or right here but you brought a basement insidious leatherface, is that not just as bad as a toxic swf? Again not saying one is worse than the other but they're both trying to achieve the same outcome which is, pissing people off lol
---
Sure. 
---
Good luck with that on console though.
---
Or mavey like a jumpscare pig that mutes or significantly lowers the volume of the charge up, while increasing the charge time or something.
---
Great Work! But when it came to the story I honestly envisioned her as the shy but deadly type, did I just misread it?
---
They just need to add a totem counter to make this officially an objective because as it stands now randoms all ignore dulls and SWF's already have a totem counter in comms anyway.  Soloqueue needs a reasonable means to counter NOED and for all the babykillers that do run it and insist that taking totems out is our objective I'd say make it official and give us the counter.  If they truly think dulls are an objective they should have no problem with this and it will encourage survivors to pop gens slower.  This is literally the smallest balance change they could make to the crutch and still appease everyone that hates the perk.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Boy oh boy is this a treat! Very well done friend.
---
Just use deliverance lmao
---
Even with getting 2500 points for killing all survivors and placing all 4 traps on survivors that gets you 4500 points. You get 100 for dashing and 500 for landing an ambush. So you'd still have to land 6 ambushes to be able to max deviousness with the pig. 
---
Idk that seems like a lot of work compared to just playing the Doctor and shocking people.
---
Exactly.
---
What perks would you recommend I run (bbq,
---
Shadow born , ruin, nerse calling)all level 2
---
Okay
---
1: All in stating is why you shouldn’t play at Rank Reset
---
2: You’ll either get me, the bubba basement
---
3: SWFs who just want to shit on low tier killers
---
Recognised this from watching that vid today 😂
---
I couldn't save anyone, he was chasing me from the beginning :(
---
Yea, delete NOED from the game and make Mettle of Man, Adrenaline and Dead Hard basic/standard abilities for all survivors. No longer needed as perks, just already built in. I can't tell you how fun it is going up against SwF time and time again all running these 3 perks. I'm already playing by their made up "no tunnel,no camping" rules. Time of my life hooking all of them, chasing them all again and have one of my hits mean absolutely nothing. All it does is waste more time, continue the chase (rightfully so, because, hey, survivors deserve to take an extra hit because they're so skillful to not get caught in the first place) have the rest of the team go through difficult skill checks and slow speed of doing a generator, only to watch all the injured survivors become fully healed when all the gens are done because they totally deserve getting that boost. I mean, they took extra hits, held down a button and timed an extremely hard skill check perfectly. Nevermind using that extra hit from that skillful perk known as Mettle of Man to take 15 seconds to hold down a button and cleanse a totem. Just get rid of NOED altogether.
---
Calm down dude. All I’m saying is don’t play at rank reset cause 
---
1: You’ll get me, bubbas basement
---
2: SWFs who just want to shot on low tier killers
---
Hi already, Make sure to always have a friend to push you while you longboard!
---
F, rank reset it aids.
---
I didn't know that was a thing, thanks!
---
Imo op didn't fail at anything (expect not cutting the clip shorter) but people failed to think with nuance. No where in the video title is it said that the legion was  tunneling when the adrealine popped. Isn't tunneling an adjective?
---
I think on my nurse I run ruin bbq sloppy and thano all level 3 I only had nurses 1 so I dont run it but I a lot of games I get more pressure with my sloppy thano combo than I do my ruin so sometimes I'll take ruin off when i was first starting out i use to throw on franklins if I had a group with flashlights in my lobby
---
 I'd think breaking the law would make him a sexual predator by now and I wouldn't be able to watch him on YouTube anyway. He'd be in jail.
---
I’d buy one
---
I was stuck at rank 4 for the longest time and I just used all my Iridescent add ons on hag to get to rank 1 lolol,,,, just wanted that achievement boi
---
Tbh it's not that big of a deal if noed is activated.
---
If you are cautious and good at chases it's not different than being injured. I spend something like 80% of matches injured so noed doesn't really bother me too much.
---
Yeahhh i know just saying. It's viable. I farm with LF sometimes. seems like a lot but farming games give you enough time to hit enough chainsaws/dashes if pig
---
Killerd in this game are soft as baby shit. Especially on this sub the amount of whining about survivors is comical
---
In between the two trees behind the generator
---
This is the justice all legions deserve. (Stumbled across the original and I really wish I hadn't. O.o)
---
Not sure why you'd think I'm not calm. I'm just trying to help.
---
Hi not, Don't forget to pay your rent!
---
I enjoy the full version more tho
---
Darn.
---
Simplistic, but HELLA cute!! 💖💖
---
Yuuuuup
---
Because you can't use teachables, so technically this post makes no sense.
---
*laughs in latoya* after seeing the dv.
---
Girl look how fucking orange you look.
---
You're playing insidious LF and complaining about the most balanced item in the game?
---
I've played a good legion before and the match was fine
---
You can use teachables. You just have to unlock them.
---
You wanted crazy, you got it now.
---
The amount of Nostalgia this one image brings
---
No, _yass gawd._
---
I was just at a bus stop.
---
The issue in soloqueue is you have no way of knowing how many if any have been touched by your teamates (the answer is typically zero).  You can count how many you took out but being forced to look for a tiny amount of broken debris in random spots of the map is hardly a system.  I take out 3 minimum myself every game and still get rocked by NOED constantly.  I play almost exclusively soloqueue as swf queues on PS4 simply don't work.  Even Small Game fails to help with this.  The issue is NOED gamers want to have their cake and eat it too.  They're perfectly fine with the fact they gain the strongest buffs possible for killer as reward for losing their objectives which are numbered lol because their answer is to just cleanse totems those are your objectives too but they don't want us to have a reasonable means for tracking this so called objective.  A lot of the playerbase wants to see something done to the unbalanced mechanic of the haste plus exposed combo itself.  What I'm asking for is considerably less than the changes they are asking for.  After watching how they found middle ground and rebalanced Decisive finally all I'm asking for is a small logical change to the killers equivalent.
---
This was a weird one, i thought someone found another exploit :p
---
I haven’t seen anyone mention Morf yet, definitely check him out. Probably the most underrated streamer, doesn’t get mentioned often in these types of threads. His commentary during games is top notch, very funny guy.
---
Pretty true on my end as an ace main.
---
Start unzipping
---
Because you just likened any form of stealth killer as just The Wraith like a jackass, so yes I sure the fuck did?
---
Tell her to draw some Susie for r/dbdgonewild
---
My boyfriend is an Ace main. I can absolutely confirm all of these to be true. Although, he does get salty at killers sometimes.
---
Honestly, I sigh so fucking hard when I realize my rancor obsession ran into me AGAIN after purposely trying to ignore them. Lately, I've just said fuck it and hooked them, even if it's their death hook. Face camping like this is just dumb though.
---
No, you had enough of this conversation before it even started, considering you don't know what you're talking about. 
---
Bye now.
---
I've had way too many of these Caludettes over the past week. I've just stopped playing for now, probably will come back after the Legion update.

---
Some of her hatchet throws are incredible.
---
Your description was literally the Wraith. Have some originality. Ohhhh fog! So spoopyyy!!! Great concept.
---
I'm hooked
---
You're telling them to run deliverance against a facecamping Bubba lol.  Dude it requires a safe unhook to function.  How are you fulfilling that against a facecamping bubba lol?
---
he's in a catch 22, you skill check wake up and get out or he hits you before the skill check you get downed and you get hatch while he twiddles his fingers
---
I’m telling NEW players to NOT play at the start of rank reset because you’ll get Bubbas Basement, and or SWFs with very good perks and add ons
---
Nah, you're wrong. She was a captain the entire series, idiot.
---
Grow up snowflakes. Sorry that I don't want to watch streams with constant w or r donation spams
---
I really enjoy damn no html
---
Just the tip. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Read my responses I clearly outlined why the current system isn't a system in soloqueue
---
if i use rancor i just hit my obsession or down them and leave them, gotta get that mori boi.
---
What do you guys think about killers having 5 perks or a “Hex” perk to give them a little buff considering survivors have 16 all together.
---
Typical day in the life of killer tbh. I’ve never gotten more direct messages playing any other game. I don’t mind the attention though
---
You gotta bring play with your food and get three stacks then body block a window as someone goes to hop through and pop T3 at the same time.
---
Quite a bit considering the frequency I rehook survivors who thought self caring five feet away from, or directly underneath, the hook behind a small rock is a good idea.
---
What am I supposed to be looking at?
---
Watch some high level streamers and take notice of how they kind game the red stain. Mind gaming the red stain is very important against good survivors.
---
OoO is Object of Obsession
---
Yeah but playing killer would knock your rep down for no real reason.
---
Lmao, I at most lose 1 or 2% of "Chase" progress, while garnering points towards other medals and trophies. What in the actual hell are you even talking about?
---
In my last match I wiped all of the players. I even let them get unhooked twice by just stepping a little bit away just to draw out someone else I wanted to down and hook. Got Red rank Malicious medal and whatever other 3 I earned were all gold.
---
Camping is only counterproductive if you legit just stand 2 inches from the hook and dont pay attention to anything else going on. If you step away just enough to keep a close eye and counter a rescue, while also paying attention to gens being started or backfiring (or various other sounds and indicators), then it actually can be very useful. Instead of wandering aimlessly with no real idea of where to go yet, you have not only a good excuse to stop and regain your bearings on the wider picture, but also can use the opportunity to set a trap (either by countering a rescue attempt outright, or laying literal traps if you are trapper, for example).
---
Survivors bait and tease all day long, and I say more power to them. But to act like its a big "no-no" to take common sense steps to ensure your goal of successfully sacrificing your prey is just *dumb*.
---
oh booy i remember that feeling so well. played on a crap pc for like 10 years of my life, mainly console because most games didnt even run at all. got a job, saved up money over the years and finally bought a med-high end pc. the feeling when i was finally running games smooth as butter 60fps and had mod support for singleplayer games was so godly. this was about the time that i also started playing dead by daylight religiously, now that i can finally hit skillchecks and react quickly to the things that happen. hope youll also have a ton of fun with dbd and all the other games youre going to play man!
---
Horror movies in the 60s were really graphic, just not as advanced in the effects department. That decade is full of grindhouse and exploitation films. Stuff that would make Saw seem tasteful.
---
Thank you for the info, I had no idea it would be that soon.
---
I love being a Chad Ace. Back in the early days I was definitely a Virgin Claudette (minus SWF because no friends). I've grown up.
---
yup but screw hatch standoffs, just sounded like you and ps4_and_ipad_lover did not realize that you were safe.
---
Hmmm.... yup. You made the whole thing up. And you clearly need a time out, buddy.
---
Lol no they aren’t, but the ones who use those blade add ons and know they’re bugged sure are.
---
Wait I think I was that nurse, was there also a meg with green hair and one with pink hair?
---
yeah no you can't just complain that the system is broken because you have potato teammates. that is not how it works and it's literally your only argument.
---
I do just fine on console. Typically hit great skill checks accept the 4 o’clock checks.
---
no, 9/10 legions are actual fucking scumbags.
---
I'm a P3 Ace main. You get saved and presents and maybe I'll waste the killers time for a couple of gens. I will die for you. All of you. Probably.
---
Would you mind expanding on that?  I’ve been watching True since my friend got me into the game a little over a month ago but I just watch his highlights on YouTube mostly.  
---
Generally though he plays very fair and he plays both sides a lot so I feel when he’s being blatantly honest people think he’s being a jerk.  I’m just curious as to why some people seem to dislike him.
---
i dont watch a whole lot of streams so no
---
Splash a little red on her! Or not its your plush
---
What's up man :) with rent as high as it is in NJ, I think about it all the time :/
---
Well first of all he moans about everything and his fans worship him especially on his YouTube videos, they talk like tru3 is one of the seven wonders of the world.
---
you'll need at least 2 people to do this
---
one guy creates a swf game, invites the people who will be killer. none of them joins though.
---
the killer player creates a game swf also, readys, and as soons as it says 'searching for match' you instantly unready. if you get it right you'll get into a loading screen and be in the main menu. wait and do nothing unti the connection error shows up (there is a network error as well as connection. the network connection error shows up first, you will have to wait for the connection error). dont press anything ingame, just open steamoverlay  and join the first swf. 
---
you should still be in the main menu with noone at the campfire and no killer weapon on the right. the first swf guy invites you again.
---
press kyf, nothing will happen. then press play as killer and join the invite. now you should be a killer like in kill your friends. just ready up and queue for a match. when everyone is in, there should be one less survivor for every killer in the lobby this way. the killer player should see the killer perspective of the match. just ready up and its done
---
hope you understand. im sorry for bad grammaer or unclear writing.
---
can we please not start this discussion again? it's pointless
---
A killer who DCd No add-ons, left as soon as the game started.
---
He he
---
The thing is that I'm not. I'm being nice. I'm trying to help you understand.
---
Those are yellow rank survivors. Green ranks at best. They dont understand how flashlight addons work, they don't have synergistic perks, they got caught by a new basement bubba for christsake. They aren't SWF, their builds don't make sense for SWF. 
---
Just don't worry about whether or not you're playing against a SWF. Don't even think about it. Worry about your own gameplay. Figure out how to play the game better, so that you can stand a chance against the real SWFs and so that you can crush players like this. Suck it up, take off noed, stop camping hooks with insidious. Eat the losses and learn how to run tiles properly. You'll be a much happier killer for it.
---
because i used a lery’s offering as pig with crate of gears and last will, and everyone tried to unhook in the basement, and i slugged if i accidentally tunneled someone, im a slugging, camping, tunneling , op addon using, map abusing killer and that survivors are weak rn and that new ds is trash lmfao
---
Yes, then one of two effects happens, either all survivors get broken for the rest of the trial, or two living survivors die. Changes with his perks, you have to use at least one of the two, his third perk causes a slight increase in sacrifice speed and has a chance to prevent hook breakage, if the survivors find a gem their aura is revealed and they get exposed, his mori is he stands over them and snaps them out of existence
---
by not being biased as shit and realizing that this shit happens with players everywhere, not even remotely only with russians
---
I though the same that it would be too weak for ultra rare, but in current state they seem a bit too strong. Thanks for your support anyway!
---
what a waste of time
---
SC is not a bad perk lol. Just stating that it does allow hem to heal themselves thus making it not plausible to slow enough time down on generators since only no one else needs to heal them
---
And what about the boldness and altruism categories? Saving each other and being hunted is literally half of the game for the survivors and in most of the games the killer will find someone eventually and then the game is just over for that survivor? In games where the killer is camping no one really gets many points and everyone gets a depip. If every killer would camp no one would be playing survivor anymore.
---
Thanks again. I will try those tips, however, I already lost my motivation around this.
---
Lol yup. I have so many from bloodwebs that I never use, they just sit there. Maybe I'll give them away in game. Haha
---
Yeah, don’t wanna leave rank 15. Not until these guys push up a little more and then I like to sit at rank 10
---
Idc about the offering. I keep losing items after the match starts and they dc
---
Getting gold and red rank Malicious medals while losing only an average of 1-2% in the chaser category (while still managing to earn that medal in gold or silver, mind you) sounds just fine by me.
---
Aren't skill checks client-side
---
just level up some more thats the easiest/only way to do it so why complain
---
There’s 3 pictures of very strong add ons and perks while being in SWFs at rank 15
---
Commas, son, you need them.
---
Umbra is awesome. Funny and ridiculously good at huntress.
---
Oh cool. So I need to use a specific perk for a useless-otherwise add on to work. Lol. No.
---
reserving the entire month of DOCtober for my baby thank you op
---
He was afk permanently in his example lol.  That's a free pass for survivors to take every totem open every chest and farm bps best they can against an afk opponent.  Surely you're not that dense that you can see this Hex?  Don't be thick and petty for petty sake.
---
Killer.exe has stopped responding.
---
I use BBQ/Tinkerer/Haunted Ground/Blood Warden
---
Out of the two you listed I would go with Monitor
---
This was weird, I was so confused...🤣
---
💀
---
You can’t tell me these guys aren’t SWFs. I was the one in the lobby when they joined not you. I was the one who faced them, not you. I don’t want to make it past green ranks cause then survs who know how to play have to mess up for Bubba to win. You cannot win against SWFs in Red ranks unless the Survivors mess up
---
excuse me, I prefer to blindly run around the map for several minutes until I find the hex totem.
---
.....I know who that is. The gamerpic gave it away. They throw salt literally every game I play with em.
---
Claudette for the P3 and achievement.
---
I get this sometimes and I didn't even bring an item lol. A little frustrating if I wanted to see my points/pips but eh

Anybody got some Adam main "facts"? I wanna see if I'm a scumbag or not

---
The 2 shapes were creepy as hell..
---
No joke the dcs are so bad that my first deadbydaylight dream was playing the doctor. Hooked one person left the fresh unhook alone to be nice and go after the 3rd person(only 3 spawned in) soon as I hit the 3rd person he didnt get hurt. I hit again and nothing. Then it went to end screen because they all dced at the same time. I remember typing "wtf bunch of bitches I was gunna farm".

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG1NrQYXjLU)
---
the first thing i thought of when i looked at this
---
Ive seen them say gg ez when they hatch escape because 2 gens got done and I 3hooked their whole team and even they were on their death hook.
---
Just make a distance requirement to actually get the one shot. Throw in a couple extra hatchets to compensate. Huntress players get rewarded for a more skillful throw, and survivors don’t feel completely cheated.
---
It does make it loud but they don't hear the Whoosh sound effect if they're in your terror radius. So if you get close to the edge of where they'd hear it, and teleport towards them, they'd have no way of knowing you're actually coming.
---
Yet you’re still having a “petty internet argument”. Let’s recap, you can’t back your claim on what devs said, and you can’t follow your own statements concerning your internet conduct, and you don’t understand what apathy means, nor will you practice it.

Let’s add in the fact that truth and logic slide off you like rain on an umbrella, and that’s one ignorant piece of shit right there!

Wraith is a favorite for most new people cuz "invisible racecar"
---
He's got the best jump factor of all the killers. Was playing with a friend and he was saying "I think Myers broke chase I don't see him on me anymore". 
---
And I go oh ok guess I'll be on the lookout and right as I say that I turn left and he is just staring at me. Near shit myself.

The current only prestiged Survivor I have, is ironically Claudette, when i first started I liked Self Care so I got her to P1, then I started playing other players, But because of her already being P1 I kept Putting points in her to get the P3 Achievement lol, But I havent used her since she was like a bit pre P3 Maybe? I hate Claudette mains now because Im usually a surv main But playing Nurse is fun and I often get flashlight wielding P3 SWF Claudettes, luckily not Squadettes.
---
Also, I FRICKIN LOVE ACE AND ACES MAINS But I havent had Time to buy the Dlc, I LOVE Ace and I think it would be fun trying to play Hag!
---
Ps: If i had Ace i would play Him, Jane and Ash mostly, not to mention My fun little Bill!
---
I agree with what you are saying here. But i feel like a nice improvement to NOED or just any hex perks in general would to add a totem counter that both killers and survivors could see.
---
Do you play fort nite ?
---
...which one? Answer carefully.
---
of the album cover?
---
Troll elsewhere no more feeding the ducks from me
---
If that's what you're referencing, yeah.
---
Had the same thing happen to me, I was playing Clown and I had a Piggy by my side :D
---
Genius
---
Been in the same boat, you HAVE to do a certain amount of gens.....which is impossible if you can chase a killer for 3-5 gens. Also can't get saves if you're the only one who gets chased. Also lose iridescent evader if you get downed once. So if you are the only one who gets chased, only one who gets hooked and you escape you are guaranteed a no pip..sometimes depip

---
When I first started playing I tried to main Nurse and I ran into this issue as well as the fact that after my first three games being all 4-mans I couldn't get a single kill and kept messing up blinks lol. I started playing other Killers to find one better for me and I found the Huntress and haven't looked back since. I'm tempted to try ol' Sally out again though, but playing Nurse on PS4 is really hard thanks to the lack of precision compared to a mouse. Mad respect to PS4 Nurse mains.
---
Tbh I'm a Jake Main 100% (But Ace and Ashe are hella great and I play like the Ace listed above. Woulda put more BP into Ace first if he was unlocked from the start.) But I can't trust Clauds. There's not many games I play as Survivor where Clauds are actually being... well, helpful. What's worse is that they'll usually get hatch, even if they haven't touched the objective all game...

If you’re talking about end game once gates are open sure I usually just go stand on a hill or something idc anymore but if I stop you before all the gens are done why should you get the hatch. Personally I don’t feel like standing there all day waiting but I just find it pretty funny survivors just think it’s owed to them in that situation and they definitely are the ones who will wait it out more often then killers will. I’ve never had a survivor say screw it im just going to let them hook me, it’s always the killer just letting them go
---
w h a t  t h e  f u c k
---
This is me but with Nurse as Pig and Pig as Myers. I love Pigs ambush and stealth but I always get steamrolled as her.
---
No0b3 wouldn't want us comparing streamers and saying one is better than the other !!
---
No it's not. Also just crouch
---
Im not talking about the perfect game. Self care is just a time waster. I love when people run self care when I play Killer. Its better to run something like Iron Will/Dead Hard and do a generator than it is to heal yourself for 32/40 seconds while someone is getting chased, *then* start working on a generator. I do it all the time solo and its the only time I’ve seen solo’s get all 5 generators done against a decent killer. 
---
Telling someone new that it’s better to use perks that synergize with being injured is actual good information. Telling someone that self care “is meta” isnt good information. They simply rely on Self Care as a crutch and cant do *anything* while injured. So many teammates I’ve unhooked do this exact thing. They get unhooked, Run to the corner of the map and start self caring. You arent applying any pressure to a killer by doing that. 
---
You can stealth around still while injured with Iron Will, and you can still prolong chases while injured with Dead Hard. There’s no excuse anymore. 40 seconds is almost half a generator so stop healing yourself through sloppy butcher and actually do something.
---
How?
---
why does he keep respecting the pallet?
---
lmfao someone who says that mt ormond is not good for looping calling anyone else a troll is fucking rich
---
Would love to find survivors that aren’t SWFs while having strong arse perks and add ons
---
I understand the fur. So many hand cramps.
---
...
---
that's what I fucking thought
---
I’d say she’s mid tier. Her vomit can be avoided by carefully looping tall structures, and she doesn’t have any real anti loop in her power. 
---
Like a lot of killers, it depends on how much survivors mess up. If they’re caught in the open off guard, she can basically get an insta down like billy, but good survivors won’t let that happen, and they’ll limit how much they use fountains, which really hurts her
---
Killers like you won't be satisfied until the opponents begin the match in dying state.
---
Then go play another game. If you aren't having fun that doesn't mean you should ruin everyone else's fun....
---
how did you do this?
---
Just use pharmacy, it's much faster.
---
I like him. He knows how to entertain and tells it like it is. Downvote away.
---
I would say she is top mid tier. 
---
 
---
Vile purge is really useful for acting as both a weapon to break survivors &amp; as a time waster by heavily pushing survivors to use the fountains to heal themselves. 
---
It can be used to monitor the activity of survivors via puking on gens &amp; if the survivor is caught out of a loop, the vomit acts as a insta-down similar to Leatherface. 
---
Corrupt purge is amazing for quickly eliminating survivors during a chase if you catch them out of a loop. The corrupt is also amazing for destroying hook saves by allowing you punish them while using corrupt. 
---
What stops the plague from being top tier is that she is the weakest killer to loops.
---
Her height removes all mind-game potential from her as survivors can usually see her head.
---
She loses corrupt purge if pallet stunned meaning survivors can abuse her need to respect pallets.
---
Her vomit is useless against tall wall loops unless she vomits on a pallet &amp; forces the survivor to drop it. 
---
The need to travel to gain corrupt purge means she loses all her pressure while she goes to collect the corrupt. 
---
Overall I think she is a decent killer but nowhere need the likes of Hillbilly or Spirit. She is one of the strongest Mid-tier killers with her power being hard to counter but since she is so weak to pallet loops, it brings her down significantly.
---
Ok let’s see what parts of rule one I apparently broke. 
---
“Be respectful towards other users. While arguments are bound to happen, do not harass or insult other users.“
---
I didn’t insult you just your post because it self promoting garbage.
---
“Do not post hate speech, bigotry or use slurs. We want everyone to feel welcome on /r/deadbydaylight, regardless of personal identity 
---
or status.”
---
Again I don’t think I fall under this for insulting your post.
---
Do not post flamebait or troll. Don't be offensive for the sole purpose of being offensive. This includes fake or misleading submissions (fake leaks, fake news) and abuse of the “News” &amp; “BHVR Official” link flairs.
---
Didn’t flamebait/troll was just being honest.
---
“Do not bring your personal drama with another player onto here. /r/deadbydaylight is not a vector for multiplatform harassment.”
---
Again I said nothing personal. 
---
“Do not be creepy towards other users. This goes doubly so for cosplay posts and photographs.”
---
Again I don’t think I fall under this category since I didn’t say anything about you. 
---
Remember people are allowed to criticise your content especially when you bring unwanted advertising on this sub since the vast majority of people don’t like.
---
Idk, we're both average player and i don't play killer.
---
YES. Agreed.
---
I ve been through all the ranks, seen plenty of useless gentapping but not the most sensible thing: stopping for 3 secs once you trigger a ruin skillcheck to minimize your chances of getting another. Brainless but I ve never seen anyone do it.
---
“Sorry my finger slipped”
---
New glitch, you can get as many as 4 killers in one game
---
My post was purposely only pertaining to the aesthetics. If I wanted to list out detailed mechanics for the sake of appeal, I would. But I just wanted an outlet for a killer I'd like to see. 
---
That said, I don't owe you any kind of explanation and will continue to post whatever the fuck I want, so if you don't like it, you can get fucked, cunt. Lmao
---
I remember the first time my friend found the hatch. It was our first time playing and we stayed up all night. I died and he was the last one left when the hatch icon appeared. I looked up what the icon meant on my phone while he tried to stay alive. We found out what it was and tried desperately to find it. The killer found him and gave chase during the chase we heard the noise and tried to loop the killer long enough to discern where it was. It was in a shack. My friend gets hit and makes a beeline for the latch. He jumped in and we went ballistic for about half a second. To our horror, we found out the hard way the killer can grab you mid jump and prevent you from escaping. It was a roller coaster of emotions!
---
I like him but I find he John's so much. Gets caught and hooked? Watch him complain about his team, or the killer, or add-ons, or lag.
---
I’ve tried, but on Xbox right at the moment of being unhooked the killer kept spawning, it’s like he knew the trick
---
Claudette mains are humble nice people.
---
Aces are toxic af. Someone has been watching a lot of ochido, am i right?
---
Have to agree with him. Even though you crouch to not set off the trap at the hook. They have 3 other traps around the hook so you have to crouch to avoid those two and then by that time the killer is already walking back over to tunnel the person off the hook
---
Not going to down vote cause you like the guy.
---
The killer usually gives me hatch afterwards as a return of good faith which feels good
---

---
Tunneling doesn’t really exist unless the killer is literally solely focusing you down each time you get hooked and purposefully ignoring other survivors when they are far easier to get, which in that case it’s just as bad as face-camping. If the killer goes after you after getting unhooked and they happen to find you first that’s not called tunneling, it’s called them actually being smart and not wasting time finding another person and committing to another chase while they heal up elsewhere. NOED does not annoy me even mildly, maybe somewhat at my fellow survivors for not helping cleanse totems or if they refuse to save me so they can t-bag if I end up being on the receiving end of it, because by the time the killer actually gets a chance to use it an exit is almost always open. FYI is coming from a survivor main, especially after Ash was released.
---
I always wanted a wave emote so I can say hello to my fellow survivors ): Friendly teabagging is fun but a wave just feels more personal
---
We dont need more toxic Aces.
---
I'm not reading any of that. Lmao Please leave like you said and stop making a liar out of yourself.
---
oof that sucks, maybe the hag had mint rag?
---
All PRAISE!
---
I thought my ready up thing glitched out but didn't think anything of it. Readied up without me pressing anything. Thought it was the survivors memeing tbh 😂
---
&gt; and really damn funny
---
Not really for mature audience though.
---
You can report him for verbal harassment. Dont know if it will do much but its something.
---
You can also close the post-game chat box by clicking on the arrow box next to the chat box. 
---
I usually do this just because it makes playing killer so much more fun when you don't have to deal with survivors screaming at you.
---
And my point was simply you hear a LOT more from survivors than killers.
---
tbh, it's likely the same people though, but as Killer can be more stressful (Killer is always pressed on time and in chase, some survivor games you just M1 gens all game) they may just play survivor more often, if they even play killer, resulting in survivors being seen as the more whiny when it's just bad actors.
---
Both sides do their fair shair of bitching, not just one side
---
Teachables are orange, when you use them they are yellow/green/purple, depending on the rank. The ones in the picture are orange and not usable.
---
Is this picture from the switch version?
---
Wow. And you're the one who called the FBI on *me* in that other post...
---
Thats a great combo. I kick it, you touch it and eithier fail the skillcheck or i can see the gen turn yellow Nd come back and kick it again
---
You are. Those are all pictures of regular survivors without strong perks or addons.
---
Real tryhard shit is:
---
*  One full tankbuild survivor with a purple flash, double battery. 
---
*  Two Gen jockies with commodious boxes and action speed perks.
---
*  One utility class to offtank and get saves with BT. Either flashlight or InstaMed.
---
You will never see the gen jockies except in the distance to distract you. The tank will be in your face all game. Utility guy will be there to run intercept when you eventually give up on the tank, before disappearing and leaving you with the tank again. 
---
At red ranks, you won't even see this kind of class specialization, because it doesn't work on smart killers. Everyone's just a tank with second chance utility perks. That's the most efficient way to waste time and guarantee the killer doesn't have the means to take control of the match.
---
These builds you've posted above are just... builds. And the players are just players...

Stop dcing. Learn.

There used to be splinters for doc and hag too but they retired the offering.

---
what do you mean by sandbagged?
---
Very childish...but also hilarious and deserved. I wish i could get this lucky lol woulda gave him a lot more hell than that
---
Personally i like hag on ps4 but thats just me.
---
Well, you're talking about a pretty old video. I'm not sure he's necessarily changed, but I find him entertaining. It's sort of like Tyler1- it's *funny* to watch a meltdown, or impossible to look away from a car crash. Angrypug is like a less repetitive, though still formulaic, Ochido. He loops, he screams, he *pigeon tongues,* he whines about urban evaders, he laughs his ass off at misplays. It's more entertaining than *most* DbD streamers in my opinion. And he escapes consistently, from what I've seen. 
---
Then, we've got the other half of the stream where he's completely drunk, playing Basement Tum Tums with the most bullshit build you've ever seen. Chat is laughing at the insanity that takes place, making song requests for songs Pug hates, and it's just general mayhem. It's pretty great, I gotta say. 
---
Yeah, he's toxic. Don't care. 
---
- Killer Main.
---
i cant even . i Just wish i had gays and dbd friends to share it with .
---
So what’s been happening is right as your getting unhooked it activates before I’m even touching ground even if teammate was crouching before unhooking, and let’s say you do pull it off, killlers got the whole place plotted so he’s already on his way back while your trying to crouch away, point being made is it’s the camping killer lol
---
Don't worry man. I slay with Myers but then whenever I try Pig I feel horrible, everyone has this sorta situation.
---
Oh I see. Well then for a more mature audience i’d suggest zubatlel over him, even though ardetha‘s laugh is so damn funny to me
---
You’re correct. Lore states she was forced to kill
---
He facecamped, too. Baby leatherface l2p noob
---
Well I mean provided the killer wasn’t near the hook when it happened killers usually still go to where they were unhooked and if they don’t tunnel they’ll go after the one who saved like you said. All I’m saying is I can see how this discourages survivors from unhooking and helping team mates unless they are farming. Survivors unhooking in front of the killer just for the BP definitely deserve to be killed, but I just feel bad for the ones who have good intentions.
---
I'll fight you too
---
This also inspired the Devs to let the Killers put the Survivors on a hook :)
---
Black and Blue face, Be the Target torso, and Everyday Office Slacks
---
How the heck is Hybrid Panda not even mentioned? Monto is too cocky to the point it's hard to watch, tydetime is great just has a very monotone voice that is hard to watch without falling asleep, Hybrid has great gameplay, is confident without being bullyish, makes fun of himself and actually entertaining on a level that makes me want to watch instead of just wanting to play myself.
---
Yes but for some reason they can sputter for some reason
---
yeah but this is dead by daylight a mature videogame so why are you complaining why dont you complain about how violent the mori is then
---
I don't do hatch standoffs as Killer because there's a pretty low chance of victory- you'll just look like a fool if you lose. As Survivor, I ***love*** hatch standoffs. I'll do it every game. It's like I've already won.
---
You don’t move. Because the wraith has you pinned against the wall. You leave when he wants you to
---
ahhh okay i understand yaaa that makes sense. Yeah like i said it really depends on which killer im playing and what kind of survivors they are. I go back if i know i'm not gonna find anybody. I don't camp or proxy but as a blind killer i have to take a chase when i get the oppurtunity
---
What would a good anti-loop Build be? I'd be excited to try one out.
---
What are you gonna do ? Bleed on me ?
---
I agree with you but I think an easy fix would be if the killers were competing for hooks
---
Wrong. There’s also a chance it’s afk killer or basement guardian bubba
---
it's always the anime pfp
---
Throw a hatchet at your face
---
It really is.
---
Yeah everyone's mind set is to bitch an moan... whining about every little stupid thing in the game.
---
You missed an opportunity to continue the Monthy Python dialogue, you lost my respect.
---
I like Spirit's mori, I find the face she makes as she pushes the survivor from her katana, down on the ground so amazing
---
Its been a long time since i watched that masterpeice. I apologize for my insolence
---
Yeah, I understand going for it. I play killer and survivor equally so I get a little too empathetic towards survivors.
---
I can tell by the anime avatar
---
I'm 99% sure you don't lose points when another survivor is within a certain distance(16m?).
---
Fuck that guy.
---
Yes
---
Mixed bag right now. Half go into Hag so I can get Ruin and half go into Dwight so I can get Bond on my other survivors. 
---
I just got BBQ so that was exciting! I just got this game about 2-3 months ago so it's been a pretty rough slog.
---
The spirit. I like how she just goes ham with the katana then screams! She don’t give a fuck!
---
Saw this movie for the first time shortly after playing dbd for the first time. I was extremely disappointed when i saw that his outfit at the end of the movie wasn't used for a cosmetic. woulda been a instant cop
---
Oink
---
Billy looks so happy!
---
Console?
---
Agreed... seems like reddit is full of trash killer mains, that will make ana excuse for everything killer does good or bad and make it ok.
---
I hate hatch stand offs
---
Aww, thank you! xD
---
Regular ol dbd since launch.
---
Haha, thank you for the feedback! I'll make sure to make some more lightswitch covers. xD
---
Top 3 faves: Huntress, Leatherface, Hag.
---
Top 3 Least favs- Trapper, Nurse, Plague.
---
However, the bitch slap the plague does is one of my fav things about her.
---
I'm a pig main. I agree with this
---
Me too! I love 50/50 players. They understand this game the best. When i first started playing i realized i was TOO empathetic lol had to make some changes so i can actually win. I think i found a good balance. I never get hate mail so i must be doing it right
---
Haha, pretty much! Also, zooming out, realizing my past hour only got me about 1/15th of the fur, and seriously thinking about picking up a different hobby. xD
---
I had a Legion daily recently where the survivors wouldn't take the hint and just leave, I wish I could have paid them to fuck off. It was Legion's Deep Wounds four times one but I really didn't feel like doing it and I'd already used the reroll so I just wanted to get it over with. We were on Freddy's map and I got what I needed early and then went AFK facing one of the cars in the street. I expected them to very clearly see me standing there, get gens done, and just leave.
---
I sat there surfing on my phone and I can hear the nearby gate open so I figured it was almost done. A few minutes later I look over and see that none of them have left so I decide to look around, expecting the usual tea bagging at the gate or I'd have to chase them out BS. Instead all four of them are gathered around me against the car gesturing at me to come at them or gesturing towards the gate. It took downing two of them and tossing them out the gate for them to finally get the damn hint and all get out...
---
In the post game chat they apparently felt bad for me and were trying to hang around so that I could get a couple hits in. I had to explain that I got what I wanted, just fucking leave next time so that I can carry on with playing who I actually want to play.
---
Lightweight, spine chill, self care *debatable imo I prefarmacy over self care* and then some sort of exhaustion perk balanced landing or lithe is nice. This is a good build for new players it has a nice balance of stealth, sustainability and of course a exhaustion perk and the spine chill is good for getting you bearings on where the killer is.  Doing this on the phone else I'd go into more detail. KINDRED is super nice for new players and solo play in general. Giving the team information of the killer and let's them see if you are being saved or just dying on the hook.
---
You haven’t heard of Anti-Looping clown?
---
Perks: Spirit Fury, Enduring, Brutal Strength, Save the Best for last.
---
Add ons: Solvent jug, Flask of bleach.
---
With this build you can ignore pallets, get rid of Dead Hard, and get insta cool downs on successful hits.
---
&lt;random eyebrow motions&gt; Bop!

---
I really thought you were joking with that sub.
---

---
No I'm stuck in Rank 15-18; I'll have to get Michael and Spirit to level 30-50 but otherwise I have the rest of those perks; Thanks!
---
Pig's and Nurse's
---
I think nurse is fine
---
Thanks for the obvious response do gens...  obviously we did that.. but that's definitely unfair to play that way. Killers are ruining this game. I use to really enjoy this game and now it's just becoming not fun.
---
As far as utter brutality goes I'd say Leatherface's is up there. Getting hit with a hammer to the head would probably hurt like hell (if you're even still conscious at that point), but then getting impaled by a chainsaw and having it grind upwards would be horrible to experience.
---
Yoink. -Spirit with prayer beads.
---
I'm a rank 4 pig who hasn't played in a few months. And I hate playing against bad players. It's just not fair.
---
Yes! I love how he raises his chainsaw in victory afterwards.
---
I’m still trying to find that balance. but at least I know that I will give survivors a fun game. Being 50/50 is definitely great! Kind of gives you a bit of an advantage knowing how the other mind works.
---
Honestly stealth ain't my style to be honest I am using atm a bill with adrenaline borrow balanced and wglf
---
bruh that's scp-001
---
Or just have David one punch K.O the scrawny 19 year old
---
Aww... With her sad she makes me sad :(
---
The Shape’s is definitely my favorite, me being a huge fan of the Halloween series. I love how simple yet brutal it is, and how the survivor tries to realistically fight back but to no avail.
---
We’re basically opposites
---
Unless you’re in my games where literally everyone drowns in holy water and there’s me getting downed for not drinking
---
I would say wait for the Legion rework, and see what his rework would be, and if it makes him a better killer than he is now, then buy him.
---
I wish I could slay as nurse
---
As an Ace Main, I can confirm that this confirmation of a confirmation of a confirmation of a confirmation of a confirmation is 100% genuine. Well Done.

:)

*joyful oink*
---
I always seem to be "The Not So Lucky Ace"
---
Lol I don’t know if this a sad attempt at satire, but if you don’t think that is true than you’re crazy. Look in any thread mentioning MoM and Adrenaline. The killer mains have moved on from DS (after they got it killed) and are on MoM and Adrenaline. Once they kill a perk they’re right on to the next one
---
Demi is my favorite DbD youtube, but Farmer John is also really good\~
---
I doubt they would change his perks, though. Discordance isn't like DS, it is a decent and fair perk.
---
you know what, that should be a perk
---
I run BBQ/Ruin/Save The Best For Last/Nurses Calling
---
Its not only that, but when I grind I dont like to waste items, but when I want to do well you kinda have to, but items can take 2-3 games to replace.
---
I love running the chest build and leaving keys scattered all over the map
---
You're right, I totally could do that. Alternatively, I could do this same thing that I did. I'll go with the latter. And will continue to. So if you don't care as much as you say you don't, then act it and leave, dumbass. Either way, enjoy seeing more of my threads because I'll make them about literally whatever the fuck I want, as I stated. 
---
Bye bye.
---
Praise him for pursuing his dreams even while crazy

Using them as some sort of barricade
---
i *THINK* i saw a dev on a reddit post about the statement they put out regarding transparency that they dont have any concrete plans at the minute on how to tackle it &amp; dont wanna promise anything
---
I think this would mostly work, but the buff to progress speed might be too much.  Doesn't spine chill even cap at 4 or 6?
---
This shows you how small are playerbase is, and why, in general, I try to be a swell guy. Someone you facecamp could become the survivor you need to pull you off a hook when the gates are open :p
---
[Ace in the Hole intensifies]
---
Yeeeeeah another dead meat enthusiast :)
---
I feel you. In a game, even if he survived, a guy began to say "I hope you will die, you will get cancer, all your family have to die" and so on. Just because I wasn't so good with the killer (just a few games with Freddie). I reported him, and in the next game I was against him again.
---
Sometimes there are very shitty people.
---
Haha my build is lithe, dance with me, wglf cause fat stacks by and the last varies honestly pharmacy though it's two fast self cares with it. And let's be real how many self cares are you gonna get in 1 game anyways.
---
mmm i dont think so but alright.
---
Isn't the spirit M1 as well? If anything, the plague is less M1 than the spirit.
---
Yup.... he wanted me.... not Thicc Jane :[
---
Can confirm I do all of these things.
---
I just hope she's ok.
---
Same, but I had Deliverance and was hooked right next to it. Tbh I was hoping to make it before I fell asleep to avoid the stand off.
---
It is situational
---
Yeah, it caps at 6. Maybe I should just have it be a 1% increase instead, since it buffs repair speed alongside everything else. Good catch!
---
This....this is adorable....
---
No Ninja without Q&amp;Q
---
Pretty much the same over on Twitter.
---
Yeah, I'm actually very worried. Hope she is doing ok, cause I've seen a few people who have just left the internet and then committed suicide, and I pray that's not what happened to her.

Well I mean that in the sense that you really just walk as an M1 Killer. Like your power doesn’t help you traverse the map in any sense. I’m probably using the term incorrectly

**Heart Monitor Trigger** \- **Ultra Rare**

Reverse Bear Traps become active with no timer after a survivor with an RBT is unhooked. Once a survivor with an Active RBT is killed or sacrificed, all other active RBT's Trigger.

Tremendously increases the time it takes a survivor to search Jigsaw Boxes.

Considerably increases skill check difficulty when a survivor searches a Jigsaw Box.

---
Reassurance is a little strong, especially since there's no reason it wouldn't technically stack if everyone in a full SWF team used it. My counter idea would be as follows:  
---
&gt;Years of hard work have taught you that effort begets fortune. For every generator completed, gain a token, up to **3/4/5 tokens**. Each token grants a 2% bonus speed to healing, unhooking, sabotaging, cleansing and searching chests.  
---
This will make sure survivors, especially SWF, won't just be able to snowball the objectives.  
---
And then there's Integrity, which I also find is a bit too powerful. However, in this case it's the very core concept of it that's too strong. It basically punishes the killer for eliminating loops. I don't think a perk like this would work too well in this game.
---
Good luck catching anyone when you’re slow af.
---
Unpopular opinion: they were right. Let’s face it. Sometimes we really don’t deserve the 4K and we should acknowledge that. And since ranking system means completely nothing anymore (not like it ever did) it won’t hurt us to let them go, really.
---
The traps around the hook are to make survivors crouch and take longer. If you're barreling through the traps as fast as Freddy eats pallets then you're playing against her wrong.
---
Them together really do seem like they’re just fucking around while the killer is nothing but an inconvenience. You could put them In a map game with no killer and I’d still probably be laughing
---
I literally just beat 2 swf teams with this build, although iron maiden is useless. Gonna use third seal instead
---
It's kinda crazy how people continue to do that even as you approach rank 10. I was rank 5 before the reset and got put to rank 10. Got matched up with a bunch of rank 11 - 14, and it looked as though they were brand new. Now I have to go through this gauntlet of players before I get back into Legion, Billy, And Nurse. Either way, it sucks lol
---
This farm ain’t big enough for the two of us pardner
---
Move on and play next game you wont have to wait hours in lobby
---
Even worse when he has the add on that makes you NOT hear the bell lol
---
only your aura
---
Nurse.
---
I got a free hatch frm killer
---
K thanks
---
strip
---
Oh yeah. I'm enraged.
---
It happens at that skill level is the thing.
---
It's easy to get stuck there if you are bad at the game.
---
I got the same thing the other day using billy
---
Idk why I see it like this but it looks like a giant spider crawling around the map lmao
---
my braincells oh god
---
This! Gotta get my Devour tokens xD
---
The main guy complaining is running Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Self Care, and Empathy. That’s all the information I needed to know. Were they playing Claudette??
---
i faced a moonwalking legion today and he acted like he outplayed me 😔
---
As a killer I apprive of this message. Support your local Chad Ace Main
---
Lmfaoooo when the adrenaline hits and you hit adad while sprinting forward😂😂
---
People always assume it's a joke until they click it.
---
Btw you can actually see gonewild under the "other subreddits" section in the middle of the banner.
---
They are a disgrace to the legion, I'm sorry for what you've gone through
---
Michael is the only one not in a hurry.
---
Mostly for the BP, but it also tells me where to go next after hooking a survivor if the survivors are smart and spread apart.
---
Nea's a killer; ho ha hee hee!  
---
Freddy says darn when he displeases the entity.  
---
Michael Myers without a shirt, we all call him daddy.  
---
And Legion is bad so give me karma a plenty.
---
I love how those are now considered toxic perks
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
All I want in this game is balance, I play both killer and survivor I have said some dumb things in past, but all I want is dbd to be balanced and to have fun on both sides.
---
Gen rush = doing survivors MAIN objective
---
I explained why ruin is useless on this build in another comment
---
Let me guess, killer was Legion.
---
I play Claudette, and cant remember the last time I used a meta perk since I started to unlock teachables. The only one I did use was self care anyways
---
The rules are the rules for a reason. They won't go back on them and make anyone who has been banned at any time, for any reason, a Fog Whisperer.
---
i feel ya the  ranking system is garbage anyone that is new to the game can get to green ranks with ease and is frustrating during the reset because this is a team game and when your team is non existent than whats the point i played a game last night and all my teammates got downed within the first 5 mins of the game trying to save
---
When a killer pauses for a long minute you know they’re about to DC.
---
Isn’t this stolen? Seen it before
---
I’m pretty much aware when I deserve a kill/hit and when I don’t. If, by any chance, I downed a survivor with a hit that only landed because of chungus hitboxes, I usually let them go. I didn’t get better nor I gained anything from it. I downed them because of faulty game. Same with Mori’s to “farmed” survivors etc. I don’t agree with some plays this game imposes or treats as “normal”. And when I don’t deserve the hit in my opinion, I let them go. I lose nothing by doing so since the ranks are so meaningful in this game and they get more bloodpoints by escaping than I get by killing them. It’s just a game in the end. Spread the love, since we’re pretty much surrounded by hatred and toxic “killfun” attitude.
---
Items, yes. Offerings, no.
---
As a Claudette main, I can say that Ochido is an asshole
---
That shit be feeling so damn good too.
---
Getting hit by NOED = what happens when you decide to do literally nothing else
---
tunneling off the hook = doing killer's MAIN objective
---
"Bad idea... Great idea but bad execution".
---
nowadays it feels like Ruin does nothing, maybe it's just me but recently everyone has just been powering through Ruin like it's nothing.
---
i know i have
---
I DC if they use Slippery Meat and Technician.
---
you can also wait and see if they show up on the shrine i would suggest you max out clown getting all the perks the bloodweb has to offer then rank up the other killers  that way when u go looking for the perks on the blood web it pretty much guarantees it will give them to you
---
you personally having trouble with something doesnt make it unbalanced
---
I almost never get a hate mail from a killer but when I do,it's easily 10x more stupid than a hate mail from a survivor. 
---
The other day I had a Nurse with Noed call me "Beby Srfaif" (baby survivor) for escaping with the hatch.
---
wat
---
How did I know your ass was gonna comment on anything I say. Tunneling isn’t the main objective of a killer. Nobody was talking about Noed so you literally avoided the original post in both “points” you tried to make.
---
Wouldn’t surprise me
---
Have you never been in Clown gas before?
---
Survivor: literally goes to hug killer because XDDD  EZ GAME 200 IQ PLAYS BB KILLER PRO PLAYER T BAG CUZ SKILL XDDDDD
---
Killer: *kills survivor
---
Survivor: wait... That's illegal
---
I'm a claudette main as well, and the only thing I can sort of relate to is the meta perks, since I used self care until I unlocked other teachables. Now I just take in a medkit
---
I understand its a little lame with them just being skins. However, adding all this so they aren't skins means they would have to balance it.  They would never perfectly be in balance and would just mean you'd basically see the same survivor x4 every game
---
Same tho
---
Nobody said it wasn't. Why do some of you love burning this strawman so much.. ? "Gen rush" complaints are virtually always directed at BHVR and the speed matches can end, not toward survivors repairing generators.
---
I went up against this once. We lasted 5 minutes tops.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bbi49o/my_allies_when_i_unhook_them_also_mettle_of_man/
---
&gt; Tunneling isn’t the main objective of a killer.
---
Killing survivors is tho and tunneling off the hook is killing survivors
---
&gt; Nobody was talking about Noed so you literally avoided the original post in both “points” you tried to make.
---
Actually, it's directly relevant :) if you want to only do the primary objective, then you're going to be punished for not doing the secondary objective. Just pointing out the consequences of what you were saying after you got really mad over OP's post
---
i don't camp either (unless the gates are powered and i wanna secure the kill) but i wanted him to take a taste of his own medicine
---
if you don't think the ability to do half the gens in under two minutes isn't a problem then u are a troubled tumbleweed 
---
&gt; 3 do gens the other search and take out totems. NOED gone
---
oh fugg tho a ton of survivors were telling me that this is literally impossible oh fugg you should inform them
---
You’re right but also wrong. Tunneling is apart of the killers main objective (Killing)
---
DJ Khaled played DBD now???
---
Yes, but you still camped. You can't justify it by saying "but HE did!", be the mature one and deny him the right to say you camped.
---
I don't even get mad. That's usually a good ass chase.
---
I'll take the first chase I can get, or let someone trade out.
---
Hex: Mechanical Downfall
---
While this perk is active, surprise attacking survivors on a generator permanently kills the player
---
yeah he's toxic but he's toxic to everyone equally I guess
---
he called me "darkwing cunt" once and honestly i cherished that moment
---
You really just go out of you way to be a toxic troll don’t you?
---
I mean... idk if lobbies like that are Russian. I do dislike that most Russians just speak Russian in post game chat though. You can't communicate with them at all.
---
When I first started this game I only played survivor and whined about killers all the time. I also pretended to play killer to try and advance a narrative because I knew that devs paid attention (and so I always know when other people do it now, ya'll say the same shit I did. I see u). 
---
My opinion totally did a 180 when I actually began playing killer.
---
really do you wear contacts or glasses you might wanna go to the eye doctor and get checked out i used to get motion sickness from playing certain games and it turned out that i had condition that was causing it
---
Just don’t let it get to you. Go watch a video on your phone or computer until they leave. They will realize after a while that you aren’t even there anymore.
---
"Hey, look! Laser beams!"
---
Huh, maybe I should. Interesting, I never even considered that. I do wear glasses.
---
No I just don't like you in particular
---
I did not forget
---
this n*gga just call you a DUMB DUMB!??
---
Thanks, bud. :P
---
Cow tree?
---
theyre messages like this, messages where people are just saying gg back, or people being weird.
---
I mean he loses regardless. There's actually no way for him to win.
---
It’s not Impossible, depends on how well the killer applies map pressure, if it’s a horrendous killer gens can and will get done very quickly. If you’re gonna bitch about generators being done in 2 minutes remove toolboxes from the game. Behavior already decreased how fast multiple survivors on 1 generator gets done. What more do you want
---
i hate the high ranks as well its just so boring as survivor and as killer
---
I knew he hooked someone before the dead meat video, but because of dead meat, I now know the full movie
---
&gt; What more do you want
---
I don't want anything. Just stating facts
---
You just need to stop being a toxic troll and literally commenting on anything I post
---
honestly when I'm killer i'll just smack them and give it to them and if I'm survivor i'll either do a gen or just jump in in their face and let them grab me like whatever man I got shit to do
---
I don't lil guy. I just sorted by new and happened to see you breathlessly screaming at a common phrase
---
I've walked to the hook before on a hatch stand off several times. I'm not entitled to get the hatch anymore than the killer is entitled to be given the last kill. But I cant be bothered. My time can be spent doing other things and I'm sure the killer is thinking the same thing. 
---
And I've actually had a few cases where the killer would knock me down and carry me to the hatch anyway. We reach a mutual respect or something lol
---
What would do more damage to the human body?
---
A 95 (estimate) kg hillbilly running you down with a chainsaw at 10 m/s?
---
A teenage girl with a sharpened ruler?
---
It’s not a fact, they put toolboxes in for a reason to speed up the generators completion progress.
---
Screaming now? Really hmm news to me you toxic troll
---
The only think that comes to mind when people mention Marth88 is the first time I hopped into his stream and he was shoveling spaghetti down his throat. The slurping and sloshing was so bad, never again.
---
Also his cringey nurse video. Other than that he's pretty irrelevent
---
Mid ranks are the most competent fun 
---
It's decent players that know how to play but aren't totally insanely good usually. Also variance in killers sometimes
---
A decent balance, not perfect but better than nothing
---
whoa but you guys are always screeching that survivor frens never get stuff :O
---
The BMers are evolving. Have they...learnt how to form coherent sentences instead of just random phrases?
---
turn down the volume fren &gt;.&lt; the neighbors can hear you
---
usually, i don't really care if i get camped but the LFs who camp ik they're doing it for that shitty meme, ik, it was really immature from me for what i did and i can't take it back but i don't have any regrets 🤷‍♀️
---
Try out Devour Hope. With BBQ the speed boost after hooking is nice, plus you'll get the added mori chance. Everyone loves Ruin right now because of Monto I guess, but I think DH is a better fit as far as Hex perks go with Scratched Myers. It helps you gain your instadown and some speed back and also grants you a free tombstone/ebony mori assuming you get a good Hex spawn &amp; can defend it. Also consider using Jigsaw Pieces when you're out of Glasses offerings; the Game is a great Scratched Myers map.
---
Lol imagine being so bad that you have to DC because the games not going well for you. Keep giving up anytime something gets tough for you in life. You'll go real far bud.
---
That's means they're really good at hitting great skill checks, which means without ruin they would be done in no time at all.
---
i HaTe WhEn KeElUrS UsE NoED.
---
I'm not convinced that Marth and Friends couldn't re-create it, the skill ceiling on 4 good survivors is still much higher than a similarly-experienced killer, maybe justifiably so. I think the major changes since then was a nerf to Exhaustion regenerating during chases, slowing down healing speed, and applying the debuff to repair progress when there's more than one survivor working on it. Pallet numbers have increased and decreased multiple times since then, I can't keep up.
---
I’m never complaining about that? I don’t complain about anything involving survivors doing anything. I don’t agree with killers thinking any perk a survivor uses is toxic and OP
---
This actually isn't funny. Like at all.
---
I like the bone clapper for this too, it psychologically works the same as the coxcombed as constantly hearing the bell ring not only annoys you, but makes you unsure if he's uncloaking on you or not, not to mention you can also just endlessly bing bong for everyone to hear at all times.
---
\*HEAVY BREATHING\*
---
I left as soon as the match started. Bad pings. 
---
Life advice because I left a lobby in a video game.... wth are you on?
---
Legion's is pretty spicy, I'm a big fan of it. I feel like only a handful of killers have interesting ones tbh
---
Damn I'm disappointed. After Jane I had high expectations. Now Jane only Carrys around 4 or 5 c's while ash only has like 2..... c'mon bhvr
---
It's only survivor sided in the fact it gives you a way out if you don't get all the gens done. Other then that what makes it so survivors are entitled to it? Just because there is a way out doesn't mean you should get it with no effort.
---
If I down you and it took 5 gens, I'm carrying you to the door. I didn't earn the kill.
---
Whenever I pull this off my first hook is also my last. Either the mentioned face camp or no one even tries to save me.
---
Dude, this is a meme build. Again, I was just letting NEW people that this is what they’re gonna face. They won’t be facing similar people to them.
---
Are you sure? Ask hexohjeezohno
---
It’s rank 15, they shouldn’t be here. Plus, those perks and add ons at this rank is just a little too much
---
MoM, Dstrike, Dead hard, adrenaline aren’t strong perks?
---
yup and the more you unlock the harder it is to find thats why i wont  perstiege  people i play until i got p3 eveyone
---
I'm pretty sure that different players can load in at slightly different speeds. I've seen it too where I spotted a survivor running during my spin, this is definitely the most extreme case I've seen though, could be an exploit.
---
So you'll either get a Bubba basement build aka one of the worst builds and basically an instaloss for the killer or good players?
---
Totally agree
---
But moreso for survivor perks
---
I wouldn't mind more perks like Mettle of man if it wasn't for perks like sprint burst or urban evasion. Crouching around is meant to be a double edged sword, sure you're harder to spot but you also move slower combined with sprint burst which means you can't run conventionally without using up the power but allows you to gain masses of distance with no counterplay from killer. By negating the negatives with such powerful perks it just makes it all so boring when it's all they do. 
---
I also really dislike self care. It's such a crutch perk. It's a team based game, you should be working together to survive.. self care lets you be fully self sufficient
---
I dunno balance much but honestly I'm just sick of seeing the same perks constantly. There's a lot of perks that are fantastic but only situationally and don't help in every game or are shadowed over by perks on a much higher power level or are just powerful effects but are underpowered so that they aren't overpowered..
---
idea sounds cool. perks are broken.
---
seriously how come every idea for a killer some has includes op as fuck perks? every killer doesnt need a fucking exposed perk stop with this shit
---
These nightmarish creatures can be felled, they can be beaten!
---
Just curious, what kinds of things did you used to say and defend?
---
That's just a Twitch meme.
---
Also Ace looks so damn sexy in those purple pants
---
Mmk
---
I see that now! Thank you! :)
---
Did he call you trash for rushing gens or something? Doesn't seem so. But one person who for sure didn't call you toxic for rushing gens was the OP.
---
I just feel like at least 1 ultra rare for each killer should alter how their power works, Like with the Shapes or Hags add-on's. If this were implemented It would change the way the power works by tying every RBT'd survivor together. "Don't unhook me yet, mine's not active, and she just downed that guy over there!" It changes the mechanic so that survivors have all the time they need, but may suddenly lose simultaneously if one of them dies, which would definitely increase teamwork and altruism in my book.
---
This is on PC, you can see on their steam profile. Since DBD seemed to be one of the only games they played I assume the ban was for DBD. He wasn't using the infinite mending just the standard frank's mixtape.
---
Killing a survivor who got 'farmed' is not bad - it's not your fault the teammate was so damn stupid they decided to hook when they can hear their heartbeat beginning to beat out their ass and see you rounding a corner.
---
You’re missing the fact that he comments on anything I say calling me a toxic survivor
---
Or when they use Deliverance seconds before you get to them.
---
changed to aura only for ball and chain
---
Yea if I had just spotted them in the distance then they started running it wouldn't be as suspicious, but the loading screen for the game was a long one and it looked like he was already on his way to us for a while since you can see them running at the 3 second mark. It was very weird.
---
That goes in your butt?
---
Wil probably replace lightweight with q&amp;q
---
I elaborated and agreed.
---
 Are we fighting now? 
---
 Please say we're not fighting, because your opinion on this meme is very quickly becoming valuable to me.
---
Yeah between the infinite loading screens, people crashing on game starts, people who have this whole mentality of "if its X Killer, or they're using X perk, I just DC" and what you're talking about, it's hard as fuck to find a full 4v1 game that actually gets played out. They really need to up the punishment for DCs or something because it's getting hard to stomach trying to play DbD right now.
---
So what about killer mains who hate corn which is a survivor sided thing and the community have voiced it to be fixed many times? Oh my bad it’s just a me thing it’s not like if you look it up you’ll find 100s of threads talking about what is talking about now.
---
The original post is clearly pointing towards “I can’t win a match as a killer without hex ruin due to the fact of survivors doing the generators.”
---
Even if he really believed that he can't win without Ruin, that isn't the same thing as calling you toxic for rushing gens.
---
&gt;You can’t deny that ergo saying the survivors are either 1 being toxic or 2 he/she isn’t good at this game unless ruin is being used
---
You're right I don't deny that, he's literally admitting the second one, that he relies heavily on Ruin to stay competitive.
---
My favorite is when I see Bubba enter the basement and never come up. Only happened once or twice. But I just cleanse totems, do gens, then leave. If I see someone got downed and hooked in the basement sorry buddy you’re on your own.

---
You complete four totems that can be easily found. NOED spawns in the one that is most  hidden. Otherwise there is a 4/5 chance that it spawns in a far worse (for killer) place.
---
Also if you cleanse 4 totems, once NOED activates you’ll spend much more time crossing the map searching for the last one. If you never cleansed any of them, there’s still chance it spawns in that inconvenient place, but there is also chance that you’ll find it earlier.
---
Genrush.
---
Billy that camps with NOED
---
I’m not projecting, when everyone makes a post talking about survivors doing gens using pallets,toolboxes or flashlights are all toxic and needs to be nerfed. That’s not even counting the perks that killers think are broken and OP. But the moment anyone says anything disagreeing with a post talking down on survivors all the killer mains pull out their pitchforks and torches and call you a toxic survivor main or low rank trash.
---
As much of a fan of Scream as I am, I find it hard to figure out what exactly they would do to implement Ghostface into DbD. If they do announce that it's happening, I'll be hyped, but also pretty wary.
---
I’m pretty sure  I’ve met that guy he tried to mass report me
---
? O_o
---
Not sure how i should feel about this tbh...
---
That's why the Entity chose him. Bubba has some experience hooking people.
---
good for you guys.i don't like playing on the game or lerys but theyre not gonna change them. there's maps naturally favouring survivors and there's maps naturally favouring killers. get over it
---
3 years of survivor nerfs and killer buffs can do that.
---
Jesus Christ I wasn't expecting that!!
---
I like playing Killer more than Survivor, though I find both really fun. Even though going against really good Survivors can be really stressful, there’s no better feeling in this game then getting a 3K or 4K against a really good SWF group. Especially since I mainly only ply Doc and Freddy.
---
You’re not seeing the point I made, literally 90% of the people that comment on posts like this always say the survivors are toxic for gen rushing. I beat them to the punch this time by getting that comment out first.
---
NaCl
---
We're all over the place 😎
---
Bill with a gun and the SWF squad about to finish off a killer.
---
Wouldn't bottom of top tier and top of mid tier be the same exact thing? :thinking:
---
It’s not the player bases’ fault it’s BHVR’s for not disabling/patching a well known exploit for over 5 months now.
---
[Us right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI7DPrUPAvo)
---
You can hold the attack button to lunge, newer killers don't know this. The lunge will hit the survivor if you get close to them while lunging.
---
OG LF!
---
Wow funny meme hahaha its so cool you should delete it so it wont get stolen :)
---
it's unfair for survivors to derank in this manner, seriously it's so toxic, survivors loooooove to derank to bully lower rank killers, it's not fair, not fair, waaaaaah why does BHVR allows this? they're hurting the game so much, it's not fair, not FAIR, probably all of this deranking survivors are streamers, and I bet some of these, are WOMEN, hmph they probably don't show their faces cuz they're ugly but they're blue balling their audience who are white knights to them, and praise them for them deranking, survivors should never ever ever ever derank for no reason, heck they should double pip every match, to avoid them deranking, that way we'll keep the toxic survivors from bullying poor killers trying to get a 4k, which is their right, I mean, stop looping, and get hooked, you're so toxic if you don't let the killer get a 4k, so awful.
---
\-some redditor who is in noooooo waaaaay salty
---
Put a stacking buff on ash where every time he heals he gains another stack of mettle of man, ad infinitum. That’s legion right now, but in reverse.
---
yeah this is ancient, Ive been the Michael as my discord avatar for a long time. Worst part is I think he's trying to sell it in a link above
---
I play the Wraith for the jumpscares. It's fun seeing the survivors scramble away when I uncloak. And then I chase them down and kill them.
---
He better change his user. We already got the fbi heading to his location because of this terrible, terrible attack against humanity. He better also change his name in real life because this joke was just so horrific that he is being tracked as we speak
---
Lmfaooooooooo
---
Did the wigglemeter stun the killer once completed?
---
You may have lost the battle, but they just lost the war &gt;=), lemme see your face of disappointment and face camp me daddy.
---
Normally how the little troll in my head sounds XD
---
Whose seen this movie and forgot this scene?
---
You did tunnel though. Page 33 of the survivor handbook on game rules CLEARLY states that after hooking a survivor you must go to the opposite end of the map, only to be followed up on Page 34 with *Once the survivor is unhooked you aren’t allowed to hit them again until all 3 other survivors have been hit, 3 generators are complete, and they’re fully healed*
---
Imagine not following the handbook smh my head
---
I'm proud of you for gaining some perspective by trying the other side and glad you found yourself enjoying it. The game is a lot more fun and sportsmanlike for everyone if we have Survivors like you in our lobbies, who actually understand what it's like to play Killer and show appropriate humility regardless of the game's outcome. &lt;3
---
gg 
---
*The killer has left the lobby
---
&gt; Plague is not an M1 killer, but spirit is
---
Wouldn't that make a Nurse an M1 killer as well?
---
Every game with what I'll call "edgy" or darker themes have some people who power Trip while playing it. I remember playing day z back in the day and some people literally speak like they do in the walking dead. 
---
Other times the killers swing at Survs because Survs were taunting.
---
Ok I’m going to say this once corn is complete unfair and if everyone had you shit attitude nothing would ever get fixed by arising a problem it becomes noticed now I don’t care for whatever you have to say have a good day
---
Screams a great movie but not because Ghostface is a great killer. This would be bland af.
---
Praise!

---
Evil Eye and Frail status are insanely broken. It removes all the survivors have to prolong the chase, which basically guarantees a down within 10s if they turn back to the hook, which they will. 
---
You dont specify a time at all either, and the spreading effect doesnt make sense, and adds to how broken it is.
---
I just picked her for the cute hair...
---
Well, you should begin by specifying if you’re on PC/PS4/Xbox haha
---
I thought lagswitching, but that's assuming they could have a point
---
Agree. I have always said that either tampered timer or rule set no. 2 should be baseline but now that I think about it rule set no. 2 is probably more balanced. The fact that you can see jigsaw boxes auras before the trap even activates was always dumb to me
---
Not necessarily. It's still quite valuable to heal against a killer that is overextending to create more pressure than they can reasonably project. If everyone stays injured, a snowball can form sometime in the last three gens. Unless your whole team completely outclasses them in a chase, you can expend a lot of resources to still be hooked before reasonably getting to adrenaline.
---
For that matter, it also has value against the chainsaw killers, because it opens up looping opportunities that may be cut short otherwise. Kind of a gamble there though.
---
(Also I don't use adrenaline, so I like being healed at some point if I don't think the killer has noed.)
---
To be honest, I don't care if I pipped or not. If I ran someone for 5 gens that means I outplayed my opponent. I rank that higher than a PIP.
---
Does anyone have the source artist ?

Embrace it

He's only weak when it comes to any exits.
---
This is an interesting concept! The numbers could use some tweaking, though. Also, the perks are kind of crazy good. Imagine running Ball and Chain on a 115 movement killer; there'd be no escaping any chase with them.
---
A possible change you could make is that the perk itself makes the killer slower when in the chase with them, too? That also would play into the Ball and Chain theming.
---
What image is this?
---
As the pros would say "it's also the reason your team got destroyed" because you spent a trivial amount of time healing yourself.

You cheated not only the game, but yourself. You didn't grow. You didn't improve. You took a shortcut and gained nothing. You experienced a hollow victory. Nothing was risked and nothing was gained. It's sad that you don't know the difference.

Make it a software ban if they leave 6 matches within 2 days.

Nah facecamping as leatherface is 2000 IQ
---
Yes it is!
---
&gt;I don't mean to make you look stupid or anything, but knowing what you're talking about doesn't hurt
---
I can almost touch the irony.
---
Gen tapping is slower, but tapping optimally only takes about 30% longer than hitting the checks (getting 20 repair points on a solo repair per tap, with no toolbox). The conundrum is that when you are gen tapping you are avoiding the practice you need to get good enough to hit the hex checks. Then again, that skill check needle can be a laggy bastard sometimes.
---
You can still lose your pips, but you wont derank to rank 16, that whats the wiki means.
---
So if you are rank 15 with 3 pips and you DC one game, you´ll end up with rank 15 and 1 pip.
---
But if you DC the next game, instead of going to rank 16 with 3 pips, you will just go down to rank 15 with 0 pips.
---
I'm pretty sure that's from a guy commenting on an article about someone needing to use cheats in the final boss of sekiro since it was too difficult to do in one go, and this guy got all pissy at them for doing it. I've personally never played sekiro so idk how hard the final boss actually is that you would need to create artificial checkpoints for yourself but I've heard it's tough as hell

Monitor and abuse, dead rabbit, and vanity mirror
---
You see people thru wall at a shorter distance but you can go into Tier 2 and still have no terror radius
---
This is a very good idea.
---
"It's a meme build so I am in the right for facecamping people I am the victim here"
---
Worth it every time
---
When you play killer with an average IQ.

---
Wow. This is in awful taste.
---
I agree with that statement but sometimes people get good placement or are swf
---
Not to be rude to the one of the best girls in the game, but what's the point of wearing a mask if you have hot pink hair. Who is gonna see that and say, "Oh I wonder who is vandalizing that truck" because they will know exactly who she is because it's a very small town in Canada. You're gonna know everyone
---
Maybe his power could be to switch between 2 different killers you control. When you switch, the one you were using can crouch in place and lose the terror radius. You would see the aura of your inactive Ghostface so you could try to chase survivors to it then switch for surprise attacks. Don't know... just thinking.
---
Sounds like me, brother.

I can't really help directly as I suck at Survivor, but I could try to either reverse-engineer some mistakes I see Survivors do a lot against me and compile a list of it for you, or (if you're on PS4) go into Kill Your Friends mode with you and give you some more experience in the chase? It wouldn't be the same as a real match, unless we could get others to join (who could also give you Survivor-sided advice) so you can also practice teamwork and altruistic actions. Just an offer :)

I'm gonna need your cell number right now, I'm gonna be taking you for a three-course fast-food dinner.

I, hopefully, will get Frank's this bloodweb

As an Ace main I absolutely love this post.

My job as a killer is to kill. If your teammate's stupidity makes that easier on me, so be it.
