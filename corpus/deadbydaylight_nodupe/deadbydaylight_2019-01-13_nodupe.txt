The only problem here would be that if your Adrenaline procs and then you immediately get downed by NOED it seems a little unfair since its less tit-for-tat. 
---
---
---
woH?
---
Not DC, DbDC. 
---
Maybe, but I think this would go a little over the top. Speaking of hex perks needing a buff, why do survivors know the killer has huntresses lullaby before the killer has hooked anyone? Doesn't seem fair to me.
---
1/10 meme
---

---
Not a single photo of SuperFreddy anywhere, smh :(
---
Nice, I've been considering picking up Nurse myself actually.  I definitely agree that his disengage and re-engage game is actually very fun, and his Dream Transition Mindgame is a surprisingly satisfying maneuver.
---
Maybe op had a bad monitor before and thought that since his pc could run on it he switched? Maybe he never used to play on 1080p+ and had to lower res on his new monitor to hit 144fps
---
*Discussion*
---
I play usually Huntress, Doctor, or Bing Bong.
---
This is true for all DBD players. Even pc. Trust me.
---
It depends. If you dont want to spend money save for killers. I would recommend getting all the DLCS on a sale and using shards for shrine.
---
If it makes you feel any better, in the most recent dev stream they said they were aware of the infinite loading issue that was causing 3 man games to happen a lot. And they're planning to fix it of course
---
No. This is my only account.
---
Because BHVR is bad at consoles.
---
You use R1 for healing and dropping pallets.
---
The Touch Pad which I touch during games by accident can make me miss a hit.
---
And the Analog stick may be because you move the killer left and right a bit.
---
Rotating the stick works rather well, it doesn't even need to be fast and can easily be done with your thumb.  If the bar is progressing, then it is going as fast as it can go and the speed in which you move the joystick has no impact on the speed in which you wiggle free.  Just rotate the stick in a circle at a comfortable speed and it works perfectly and isn't a hassle.
---
Also I don't see why we shouldn't be allowed custom bindings for literally everything, and BHVR should also allow for sensitivities higher than the current maximum as an option.  More options is never a bad thing, and since they already allow adjustments of some of the controls I don't imagine it would be very difficult to open it up a bit more.
---
I feel slightly better :|
---
Waiting for news regarding re-implementing the flick, as they promised in one form or another. :)
---
I agree, but then again, I feel like NOED needs a rework itself. I'd like it if the movement speed got increased to 7%, no longer gives the exposed effect and no longer is a hex perk.
---
If that doesn't go trough, at least let everyone know that they have the exposed effect, don't make it hidden for the survivors
---
SuperFreddy would require an ascension beyond the limits of mortal man, to the point where one might even say that Freddy's top 6 killers in the game.  
---
I've never cared if people use either, they're just perks in a game I like and they make for more interesting game play. But with the facts shown so clearly like this, it's very clear that NOED is much more of a crutch perk that most people shouldn't need and is way stronger than it should be for the people who do need it. All DS does is extend the chase like 90% of the time and only very seldom does it lead to an escape because it's not hard to counter at all.
---
Know that feeling.
---
I didnt even lvl for Franklin  because I want to keep my Perk Pool somewhat clean. 
---
Its sad - the game is really fun and original but the player base are mostly whiny babies. This sub in particular is a total echo chamber of people rehashing the same posts and arguments over and over.
---
Everyone thinks they know best, not much to do besides try to ignore it and stick around for the sprinkle of good posts and memes lmao
---
These high rank killers shouldn't *need* NOED. Yet nearly 1/4 of them do.
---
That's only 1/5 of survivors using DS and the only reason it becomes a 'problem' is because there are 4 survivors. You also have to take into account that high ranks are full of P3 Nurses where survivors never even get to the endgame. 
---
I just had a 3 v 1, i let the last survivor live like real gentleman
---
So basically, they didn't buff prove thyself, they nerfed repair speeds. GREAT. 
---
I think the worst is a key, a map, and 2 toolboxes
---
Mission passed; +5 respect.
---
Billy is the best killer next to nurse. Change my mind.
---
Don't put him on Night Watch 
---
You mean so hot am I right 
---
Who ?
---
I agree that both perks are a hassle to deal with. However as a survivor main I feel that the game is allready favoured for survivors. A ds is a huge tempo swing. As a killer you need your time so badly. If the obsession is the first one you find and you chase them (ds users are often skilled players) you already lose so much time. By the time you down them again, two gens have popped. Then the game is basically lost because there is no pressure.
---
NOED gives a bit of tempo back, but only once it is too late. It usually gets you one more kill if you're lucky. To say that it rewards a bad player is incorrect I think. Yes less skilled players can get an additional kill maybe, but that is just it. Why should you not have perk that helps out a little bit should you have less skills then others. You could easily just be not very good at the game, but still enjoy it. No need to be harsh about just needing a little bit of help.
---
I feel both perks are unfun and therefor decide just not to run either. Sometimes it costs me a game when I come across more skilled players, but i'm fine losing badly every once in a while :p
---
I got this.
---
truthfully if this is how i inevitably go out, i wouldnt regret it at all. 🤷
---
The only issue I have with him is when there's 4 survivors on the one gen and if you put them all to sleep, they just sort of take turns waking each other up and putting you back 7 seconds (on average). You hit one and chase them and the others wake each other and go back to the gen and then you have to choose between losing your hook or going back to try and scare them off the gen.
---
With other killers it can still be a pain in those situations, especially in SWF, but I always feel like I at least can slow them down a significant amount and that they have to go find another gen to work on or try and lead me away significantly.
---
I dunno, that's just how I feel. The rest of his gameplay feels pretty fine though so I'm not sure how it could be balanced in a way that doesn't make the rest of it too easy without drastically changing his power.
---
Old DBD legend.
---
its an economy but with actions
---
She’s a lot of fun once you get her blinks down. Give her a shot! 
---
Doubtful, if this legion truly didn’t even get a single hit they were either farming or very very bad
---
Both need changes imo but no matter what I say people think I'm just shitting all over NOED and saying DS is perfectly okay. Admittedly, DS doesn't cause as much of an issue to me as NOED does, simply because NOED causes you to rely on your teammates who are probably going to leave you or get themselves killed while DS is just down to you choosing to tunnel a good survivor instead of putting pressure on gens and finding someone who isn't your obsession. 
---
except NOED is a crutch and unbalanced as fuck while ruin isnt LMFAODOSFOSDFKOPDSKFPAGIDFHOIOGUH
---
This is me when I’m killer,
---
If it’s 2/1 man either from loading issues or d/c I’ll let you guys farm. Shouldn’t be punished for other people leaving.
---
Same here. I bought it on pc just before clown was released so I could play ptb and stuff. Realised how much smoother and overall better the game ran on pc. Been on there ever since. Still dabble on ps account if it's switched on and I wanna quick match but pc is much better. Worth the regrind IMHO. Plus ptb. 
---
I also took my knowledge from hundreds of hours of playing and applied it to who to level first and the best way to maximize BP etc. Whereas ps4 I was freshly noob so made some horrific choices which set the grind back a bit. Think I've put in about 260 hours on pc now and have pretty much all teachables across survivor and killer. Bar a handful. But I left them on purpose to reduce the crap perks showing in webs etc.
---
You don't need to let anyone go.
---
Never heard of him. Also fortnite is making more money.
---
Agreed :(
---
Both of them need changes to make them more balanced but everyone would just complain no matter what happens. 
---
One thing that I would really like to see is being able to do something to the exit gate early so that it opens faster when it's actually activateable.
---
So for instance you could do something on it that takes 30 seconds during the midgame and that thing shaves 5 seconds off the opening time at the end.
---
That way it would be entirely optional, but would slow things down while also being a worthwhile objective if you're not already getting fucked by the killer
---
I feel that it is balanced but it's down to opinion. See how you feel 
---
The reverse of this is that you can't block pallets during pick up. Freddy is so weird in that he has many strengths and serious weaknesses. The problem is that sometimes his downsides are just too damaging.
---
I used the word 'experience' to avoid saying good and bad. Two kills is a decent amount but if you need NOED to get that then I'm sorry but you didn't deserve them. 
---
If you are planning on playing with friends gl buddy. Games so broken that it takes about half an hour to find a game.
---
I dont think you get it. Im talking about FPS games. why arent you playing fps games with a controller like everyone else is? Because using a keyboard and mouse is basically cheating lmao
---
They were making a general comment. The fact you took is as though it was talking about you really does say something. 
---
I'd love this change to be honest. I hate it on both sides.
---
Well, people like bulldogs
---
*Written by someone who prefers to play killer but finds NOED more frustrating than DS. 
---
Just don't always run, you're leaving scratch marks behind you when you do so. I've got caught so many times because of people who aren't aware of that.
---
I also started playing a short time ago, so welcome to the club!
---
might wanna add /s
---
This gets an upvote purely for the fantastic thing you did with this meme. Plus it's also painfully accurate.
---
Back in the good ole days
---
I actually do think DS and NOED are comparable. Both let you skip an instance of health. Which saves time and makes things take longer. So I don’t think ruin = DS. Is NOED stronger? Probably. But it is a 1v4. 
---
I agree with all the points except "hard counter, dribbling, slugging" lol, those arent counters they are detriments.
---
"Anything ever happened in this game 'Chuckle I am in Danger' xDdDdd"
---
I agree. The whole 'just cleanse totems' is ridiculous and you can't do that every single game against a decent killer. 
---
Old brand new part. It would trigger a series of diffucult skillchecks that would reward a lot of progress, but when you got off the gen, or failed a skillcheck, it would consume your toolbox.
---
Yep, I'm surprised it didn't get 0 votes on it tbh. 
---
What did he do? 
---
The ultimate 15 fps experience
---
Not all survivors should escape to begin with. Besides like I said everything is irrelevant with bad players. 
---
[deleted]
---
You know damn well what I was saying, which is why you gave a smart ass response rather than trying to argue the point. 
---
Yeah it's insulting the killer for using a crutch and not even getting you killed with it. A good killer does not need to run NOED. 
---
Dude, I feel the same way! The hovering over create a lobby and all. Somtimes I have had a very good game with very nice survivors ( I know right!) and still hover there... Do I want to get rid of this good feeling by risking death wishes again.. 
---
Damn dude she coulda grabbed that hatch too lol. 
---
in the situation i'm talking about at the appropriate ranks on PC, it is an issue.
---
1 will be chased, the other 3 WILL be working on gens. 
---
if that doesn't happen you are vsing shitters
---
Dwight best boi
---
How cute!!
---
r/everyfuckingthread
---
A bad killer using Noed may still not get a free kill, bad survivor might get to a safe pallet and escape. It's all situational, idk why you assume one is possible while the other is not.
---
&gt;Wrong.
---
Wrong
---
The first comment was right.
---
Working alone on a generator gives you a speed of 100%
---
Working with 2 people on the same gen gives you 180% speed (both players get a -10% penalty)
---
If the killer shows up at the generator, then that is imidiately 2 people doing nothing.
---
Being together isn't a good choice in this game and I think it's funny that spawning together is a survivor offering instead of a killer offering since the killer benefits more from it.
---
I agree but you should earn more than just a slight bonus in shards earned per lvl up just because reaching devotion means putting in time to the game, don’t know what else the reward could be though.
---
you are completely missing the point.
---
if you are worried about NOED you cleanse totems while doing gens, if you don't, it's the definition of gen rushing.
---
jfc!
---
damn that looks groovy as hell
---
Nobody who's any decent at the game considers NOED overpowered, check this opinion with top streamers of the game.
---
Perk's ability shouldn't be a balance argument. Once it's in the game, you are facing it.
---
Yeah but they can't just leave the servers broken till then. 
---
Yes officer, this comment right here. 
---
I had one survivor yell down my throat when I let him go because of my internet a while back. 
---
My bad bro not trying to downplay an experience you have, I personally would play with 1 FPS if I could just get in a damn match. 
---
I bet this is probably it but the husk of The Spirit has a hit box and can't be ran through
---
Yeah I completely agree. When I play survivor I play alone or wth my gf but mostly I solo que. that means I have to hope that while I get totems as I see them, everyone else is too. It’s annoying that that’s everyone’s “solution” to noed, “jUsT cLeAnSe” it’s like yeah but do I have to do all five? I also wanna do gens, get chased, save, heal etc. So if you’re not a swf it’s a bit of an unknown when the gens pop if mr noed is around the corner.
---
Ds is a pain, it can really be frustrating as I said with a good survivor. But you know a good survivor after chasing them for a short time, you have to decide if the ds is gonna hurt you in the long run but atleast you have that option. Noed is hidden until some poor fucker gets one shot, then it’s a whole new game because what do you do? Try find noed and potentially get screwed yourself? Leave? Go for a suicide rescue?
---
I’d say 90% of killers run noed since the buff. I encounter it almost every game and I play a lot. My real problem with noed users are the Myers and Billy’s, like you can already one shot why are you using it?! It’s lazy as hell. And like I said bad killers who don’t get any kills in the game because well, they haven’t done well, then get free kills because of one perk, especially on maps like the game where totems are a fucking pain to find, if noed pops on the game I’m out of there.
---
Got it after 2 tries lmao
---
I'd be happy with increase of shards alone. Even if it's only a 5% increase per devotion point
---
Just got it. Only been trying for 10 mins too
---
For all them? 
---
There's an amazingly dissapointing amount of them on Reddit. They even defend the stance.
---
Dislike because NOED
---
Nice, how many achievements you need until platinum ?
---
It says killer.... not Claudette. Nice try kiddo.

Agreed. But i think their brains are working differently 😅🤣

You have to buy them in level order.
---
Getting so many puddings and streamers while levelling him up made me play bubba. 
---
Turns out I actually like him. If you aren't relying on your chainsaw for downs and just M1 some people he isn't terrible. 
---
I've played some bubbas that would refuse to smack me so you can just run around loops forever. 
---
If you get level 2/3 BBQ on him early its probably better to just play him to get more BP
---
Well, to be honest, I feel like the base bloodpoint gain needs a buff, and having a 20% increase is... not much. BBQ n chilli gives you a better boost for only hooking 1 guy.
---
Spirit and Legion
---
My comment was in response to the OP using TOTH and saying "just cleanse dull totems", showing a totem guarding build. Their comment told me not to use TOTH with NOED, and told me to use Ruin instead of TOTH. I don't even use NOED.
---
Yes I said I cleanse dull totems against TOTH but I also said it's obvious to me when a killer is setting up for NOED, i.e. defending/patrolling totems.
---
[removed]
---
I don't feel like the game should be canceled, I do feel like everyones items should be refunded
---
WAIT ITS NOT WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE!!!
---
Ace was already released XD
---
I think Freddy's trying to tell us something 
---
I got it on treatment theatre. I didnt use a map offering but use either that or the game. Then just sandbag nurse

Looks like this is not happening making the great zone larger as well as unnerving presence making the skill check as a whole smaller.

Lmao

---
Dang well what if we received 1,000 shards for reaching Devotion 1 ? And as you reached let’s say Devotion 2, it increased and gave you 1250 shards and so on ?

you do realise a general comment can be applied to anyone right?  That's why it's called a general comment...

Exhausted reset, no. Everything else seems solid though

Noed and DS aren't really the same thing.

i was legit excited for a second :(
---
I think it could work, but I would like a collectathon gamemode more
---
Thanks mate. I might give it a go in the morning as I just got into bed. I think she's the only killer I have not adepted so far. 
---
Wait, since they retired them what happens if you buy it?
---
I have leatherface freddy and nurse
---
wow rank system fucked up and a person running OoO
---
Are you sure? Both sides on this reddit seem to get so butt hurt about it that they feel the need to make several posts a day complaining about one or the other. Meanwhile I'm just over here waiting for my pebble to be buffed again.
---
Maybe you should try deranking. Oh, wait, that's the worse thing you could possibly do in the game. Just have to deal with the long ass wait times. Waiting is fun.
---
The only incentives to ranking should be a cosmetic only, and probably something really bright to not give you a stealth advantage. The reasoning is that earning more BP would unbalance the economy worse at higher ranks so when the reset hits you have people who were at rank 1 now at rank 10 with OP addons and items.
---
Personally I would suggest a cosmetic based on where you end the season. Each rank grouping gets their own cosmetic (you dont want rank 1 cosmetics since people will just get rank 1 then afk at the end of the season, and people will purposefully try to derank others to lose rank 1). You can use your cosmetic until next reset where you rank is reevaluated and you can lose your current cosmetic or get a new one.
---
I think thats a step in the right direction.
---
Your stream sucks
---
What’s the point of having NODE if they’re all dead before the first gen gets done?
---
&lt;3
---
osu is aids and very boring
---
OP missing out on Bubbas basement fun
---
I deleted it  last week to make room for Red Dead Redemption 2. I hope to come back when it is fixed. The Legion update really screwed up the game on my PS4. 
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
I'll swap it out for suveillance in next patch ;)
---
SWF is game breaking. If I sense a particularly sweaty SWF, I'm out. Don't want that? Don't cheat with comms
---
Time to climb some trees
---
1 extra kill is the difference between maintaining rang and pipping, or alternatively depipping or maintaining rank. 1 kill wins a quarter of the game for the killer.
---
That doesn't mean never use your chainsaw though. The ability to still be able to instadown anyone is huge. 
---
At least they're entertaining, I really don't give a fuck about your rank I come here to look at content made by fans of the game not their progress. "OMG I hit level 10 today!" Who cares.
---
Ironic and hilarious how youre the hypocrite in all this. \^\^
---
Evil Incarnate-In a public match, kill all 4 survivors with the tier 3 Evil Within.

---
Hook system was best
---
&gt;but then don’t complain about gen rushing
---
Says the one who calls any solution to the problem op
---
I've had a game where a freddy player had yet to hook me the entire game and had 0 kills, at the end he had NOED and ended up getting a 4k... trust me, as someone who plays both sides, NOED is more bullshit than DS. 
---
I have mixed feelings. Dead by Daylight is not fun, it's very frustrating and unenjoyable so sometimes it's best to just leave before you die of stress. 
---
One less SWF cancer? Sounds good to me!
---
Sorry I thought he meant the 4 moris in 1 match, I forget the name. Blood on your face? Sorry got confused
---
At this point,yea its impressive.I've always given the advice of waiting until we get a new map released so totem spawns are unknown and hoping Ruin isn't in plain sight.
---
Bravo to both you and the survivors who didn't dick you over
---
The one he gets at the end of his healing
---
I think the main reason Killers lobby dodge is because of SWF and people that they know or look like they are going to be assholes. 
---
You forgot to add a "shit post" flair
---
And using your whole hand is silly, too. Just a light rotation is all you need. The thumb works fine.
---
&gt;Waste a perk slot
---
Yep, 'cause Enduring is such a garbage perk outside of countering DS.
---
Well the killers that aren’t shit will acknowledge the fact that noed is complete shit and honestly dstrike is to
---
I wouldn’t call the movie “bad”, but I sure wouldn’t call it “good” either. It’s definitely an overhyped “meh” kind of movie. 
---
Oh wait, you mean at the start of the clip? I  didn't even spot that because it shows up only a fraction of a second
---
I mean, why should Leatherface and Hillbilly use their chainsaws? I refuse to use anything that halved the effort to down someone.  /s
---
It’s obvious that this is meant to crap on NOED and say DS isn’t so bad. If that’s your opinion then fine, but announcing it to Reddit and expecting everyone to agree with you is risky. 
---
Sometimes I use NOED, sometimes I don’t. I’ve gotten and stayed at rank 1 (I know, not a huge accomplishment) without using it, because I thought it was scummy. Now I just don’t care. I don’t play by the survivors rules. I have my own ethos personally. I don’t like camping or tunneling when I’m the killer, but NOED can be fine if I don’t bring Ruin, because I know the gens will be done quicker. 
---
I’m not good enough of a survivor to make DS worth it, but I know that it can be hell for a killer. 
---
So, long story short, not everyone agrees with you, get used to it.
---
You'll find that Freddy tends to get "free hits" just as survivors fall alseep.
---
I love survivors that are injured and awake.  I find they're in the most danger when in that state
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the Doc, but Freddy just feels better to me.  I'm sorry if I offended you, just putting my thoughts out there.
---
Do totems?
---
This is a really plan
---
Then the game would last about 30 seconds lol
---
When was DS buffed to automatically complete a generator with no outside help and halfway open a gate?
---
Same tbh.  Honestly if they just made Dream State's action speed debuff apply during Transition, that alone could do wonders for Freddy.
---
Thanks.
---
Okay.
---
NSFW
---
I feel this. I'm not playing Freddy right now because I'm trying to get all the teachables and I like playing the killers I level up, but I think he isn't that bad, or at least can be played well, and I'm really worried he's going to lose what makes him interesting.
---
Seeing as it's flaired as gameplay rather than shit post, I hope there's more to it than that.
---
You are in a very small minority of players who like Freddy in his current state. The vast majority of players both killers and survivors dislike his kit.
---
I never denied making fun of the killer... you however made the claim that I did not make fun of the Claudette and only did so towards the killer which I quite clearly did not do as I poked fun at both sides equally.
---
I apologize to your parents for raising someone so dumb they couldn’t even understand basic English phrasing.
---
Because it’s the best feng outfit 
---
I’m trying to find the article, but I know I read somewhere that the game only really took off and became popular because of swf. I play  solo a lot nowadays, but I wouldnt have played in the beginning if there was no swf as I liked to play with friends after work. Maybe the mentality of liking to play by oneself is why a killer chooses to play as the killer. 
---
The new match making system is supposed to put all survivors into the match at the same times. If you have a private profile it’s going to be harder to guess swf. 
---
When the game is sick of these flashlight using noob survivors so it becomes a flashlight itself
---
That's so not calm but even then hide behind a gen hide in a locker fake it there's so many counters to it but still funny though

Mate the killer gets a big axe too. So unfair!

1 tree 1 rock, enjoy my fellow balanced landing players.
---
That would be so little! It wouldn’t even make players want to rank up in my opinion.
---
The No Real Scottsnea Fallacy I see. 
---
If I’m Doctor then I put them into Madness 3 and hope they miss the skill check (I also run Unnerving on him)
---
If I’m running an Obsession perk, then I will kill them ASAP or try to leave them alive (depending on the perk I’m running)
---
If I’m not running Doc, Unnerving, or an Obsession perk, then I will dribble if I’m close enough to a hook, try to get them to fall off an edge and pray they don’t have Balanced Landing, or move my camera wildly and swing my weapon in hopes of distracting the Survivor. If they hit the skill check, then I’ll just chase them again. 
---
No
---
You're a far better Michael then I then
---
So?
---
Sure thing!  If you need a different PoV to record things like Freddy's blinking in and out during Dream State or something I'd also be willing to be the Survivor dummy if it means awakening a wave of great Freddys :p
---
I got it while getting blood on your face trophy for platinum
---
please stop i’m in tears
---
as a p3 rank 1 freddy, one of my favorite addon combos is class photo with pill bottle, survivors never know if you're going to chase them or leave them to sleep someone else, they end up wasting a lot of pallets, and its funny to see them run around like chickens with their head cut off thinking you're about to smack them but you're just walking away from them, or they think you WONT chase them and they stay on a gen so you grab them/get a free hit. btw class photo makes obsession perks more viable, because the obsession cant really ever hide from you/you can sleep and ignore the obsession to find someone else. you just get a lot of information with it. and that's always good, also its good to run enduring with spirit fury, hes an m1 killer after all, and its great for loops and for decisive strikes if you're tunneling the obsession. and spirit fury really synergizes with the addon combo above, because they waste and throw down pallets you can break to get spirit fury. sorry this is just a big wall of text fredrick rant. there's a lot more to freddy but I think I wrote enough.
---
Ddosed? 
---
I got both at once
---
lmao what were you getting repercussions for? these geeks and their egos are wild
---
I play a mix of solo and SWF but mostly it’s me and 3 friends I made playing a different game. We enjoy playing together and we aren’t really all that toxic (none of us are good with flashlights) but after a certain time in the night we can’t find a match because we keep getting lobby dodged. (PS4). It stinks because with the long waits we never end up getting a match before one of us has to go to bed. (Like 1am!)

bbq is less necessary for him if you are using class photo, because odds are someone is still asleep after you hooked someone if you've been sleeping multiple people, or at least know their general location and you can sleep someone to find everyone.

Met someone whose name was "Killer Helper" fast vaulted a window at the start of the game until I came over then tried to point out other survivors. I chainsawed them and they suicided on hook. But yeah. Some people are fucknuts.
---
I killed him and i was doing well that game. I'm a rank 1 killer and got nothing from that game because he did it before it was over.
---
Because they don't want to be in a game where they can't be a troll. If you won't be their friend in this game, they'll find someone in the next game. 
---
I giggled more than I should have at this.
---
I will

"When did the apocalypse theme start?"

Yes it’s a perk that exists, and yes it requires the killer to tunnel the obsession to shit. If it’s really as BS as you think it is then why is it not meta? Oh yeah cuz you have to use a Mori every time you use the damn perk, and there isn’t even a guarantee the obsession is a total fucking numbskull and will just hand themselves over. In the majority of games in high ranks, the obsession knows how to loop the killer for at least 3 gens and when you finally catch up, they use DS on you and loop you for the rest of the gens, adrenaline pops, and you lose them. (Yes it’s a made up situation but I’m speaking from personal experience). 
---
If people didn’t use mori’s to activate dying light, all the gens would be done before the obsession can even be on the second stage. The obsession would just run around giving fast heals and unhooks like motherfucking Oprah. 
---
What if they reworked the ranking system where if you are Rank 1 you get reset to Rank 5?
---
class photo is a direct upgrade to the black box, because you can find the obsession any point in the game by sleeping a survivor and looking for your obsessions body shape.

Only through the Shrine of Secrets. If a perk is in the Shrine that you already have unlocked as a teachable, you can “buy” the perk with Iridescent Shards and get Bloodpoints in return in place of the perk.
---
Only one way I know of. If you've unlocked a teachable perk, and then buy that perk again in the Shrine of Secrets, you'll get 150,000 BP. But that teachable perk has to be available in the SoS for you to do it. 
---
True 30 seconds game is hardly worth a 30 min wait between matches 
---
Bahroo ran a great Myers build earlier, NOED/Haunting Ground/Iron Maiden/Devour Hope with perma-T3.
---
Dying light was basically made to be a counterplay perk with decisive strike. Killer plays dying light and targets their obsession, so decisive strike gives an extra life to avoid dying light paying off. But dying light is hard to pull off unless you are using a mori, so it is no surprise it isn't that popular.

godspeed to you sharp hand joe advocate

its salty trash talk, they will call you bad no matter how you played because they are mad and want to upset you.

I do purple ponytails with sweater and purple shorts, is that toxic?

I’m not sure if there’s a list of terms anywhere but I can help with a couple!

Immersed survivors are those who crouch around, hide in dark corners, run away when they hear the faintest heartbeat, etc. They’re people who are nervous and fearful playing the game. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this playstyle, it’s a horror game and most people start out playing this way, but unfortunately people who are “immersed” are often not very confident or good at being chased because they never practice it, so if the killer can find them they will die quickly. They’re also very risk avoidant. In contrast, there are very bold survivors who will deliberately try to get the attention of the killer so that they can loop them around the map. Having a full team of either immersed or bold survivors is usually bad because generators will get done too slowly, either because the survivors are too scared to come out of hiding or because they’re wasting time chasing the killer around. 
---
Gen jockeys are survivors who will attach themselves to a generator and stay on it whatever happens, then move to the next one once it’s complete. They often won’t try to save people, do totems, loop the killer, etc. They’re useful for getting generators done but sometimes can be frustrating if they make no attempts to save their team. 
---
The best way to avoid Freddy is to try and be a bit stealthy at first; his world is filled with mist so he can miss you if you’re sneaky, but he can see your scratch marks when you start to run so try not to panic when you hear the lullaby. If he starts to put you to sleep, though, run for the nearest window or pallet and start looping him around. You can see him moving through grass and hear his footsteps if he moves towards you, so keep an eye out for that. 
---
K. We already played a few rounds and they left, so it's jist me and this other dude
---
no dont rework him, dont want him to be dumbed down to be more like the other killers, 
---
Yeah i dunno ..it was literally like Nea just replaced the spirit. I didnt even see nea running to me,so i started singaling that the spirit was camping me but then all of a sudden turned into nea and grabbed me off the hook.
---
Now we are talking 
---
Is it possible for a killer? I was in a match and I ran out of the main house in Ormond and all of a sudden I was downed and the killer was no where around me. All of a sudden I was picked up by the killer but we were back in the house. It was a legion killer. 
---
New Harry Potter chapter confirmed. New Killer: Voldemort, New Survivor: Harry Potter, New Map: Hogwarts.
---
The only reason I played leatherface was to get this perk lmao, never touching that killer again
---
WRONG AGIAN FOOL! Clearly I am not the illiterate one here. I never said that you did not make fun of the Claudette. You make yourself sound stupider with every comment.

I have a theory that the majority of idiots I meet on the internet voted for Trump. For research purposes, please confirm or deny.

Yeah. It's fucking terrifying to see nurses with moris

That's dope!

I mean there are other games in existence console so one can just compare frames from those.This has nothing to do with pc
---
Original 100
---
I really hope you’re joking
---
you seem like a terrible freddy player if you think that lol, theres so much to learn about freddy, you're not supposed to play him like a standard m1 killer.
---
In the approximately 10 times I played vs Freddy, the one time I didn't get 4ked one of the survivors said, "and that's why Freddy sucks" in the post game chat.
---
Rip. I hope you brought Enduring.
---
Billy*
---
I demand a new survivor perk. YesED. Where if one surv has it, everyone escapes death automatically. Insta-loss for killer. 
---
You’re comment doesn’t really make sense if the game is only 2 years old 
---
Imagine Skidrow from MW2 in DBD.
---
Distributed Denial of Service. Basically, you have a bunch of "zombie" computers flood a specific IP location with way more traffic than it can handle, thus clogging up legitimate traffic and lagging people out. 
---
Xbox Live and PSN get hit with them somewhat often, especially over the holidays, and they're often used against other big companies to crash their websites and services. In recent years, though, a bunch of Script Kiddies have been using them to crash online games. Has been a big issue with Minecraft lately, as well as a lot of competitive online games.
---
Now I actually really want slenderman as a killer.

Isn't it myers' and not  myers's?

Menno-chan is dat u? OwO
---
Nothing but super fun endgames for me and the survivors.  I've seen some of the best in people during a NOED and endgame.  If course, I make sure nobody is dead yet so that they have a full team to make the save and cleanse the totem...
---
Ooo more salt, not surprising coming from someone who doesn’t know how age works. 
---
I mean, thanks glad I taught you something today 
---
Console or pc?
---
Deserve?  What do you mean?  I've been killed by NOED by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Fuck it.  If you die because of NOED and you haven't pipped yet, that shit is on you for playing a shit game as survivor.
---
what am i looking at, a pixel?
---
That's how mafia works
---
Jeff did some art for the legion
---
Serves 'em right. I came up with a perk that well expresses the killer's rage at being stunned. 
---
Almost completely negating dead hard.  You're assuming everyone is healed up going in to the endgame...
---
You taught me that there are people much more stupid than me. And you used yourself as an example! Brave attitude.
---
I'm not a nerd ass who knows the exact day this game came out. I just counted the years, if that bothers you so much, then you have serious problems.
---
I think NOED is op, but I think it's pretty fun still.
---
&gt; or my favorite, hit them and they vanish right before my eyes.
---
That would happen to me from time to time even when I was playing the game a ton but I tried playing again after about a month away and... yikes.  I think I got like 4 hits as killer and every single time the survivor just fucking disappeared.  I may have just quit and gone back to Blackout after that (you know, a game with 100 people per lobby, helicopters, boats, trucks, ATV's, running at 1800p/60fps on the same console that can't hold 30fps on this game).  I keep checking here hoping for some kind of news of real optimization because I really did enjoy the game.  I just can't justify playing it or spending any more money on it until the devs start taking console seriously.
---
Also you can sometimes use the basement staircase to trigger it, you lose a little bit of distance due to having to move farther, but if you're enough ahead to not get hit when you reach the top of the stairs, it's a net gain.
---
10/10
---
What's up with these I've seen a few on reddit and stuff but is it like a glitch or something 
---
Is he not supposed? I don't understand
---
New skins coming out had a full splash art showing Wraith and Nurse together iirc
---
Damn, you don’t know how to use google either huh? I have no experience being a dunce like you but just keep trying one day it’ll get better
---
Based on what I see, she’s standing still and you’re making a lot of assumptions about this match. There’s no real way to tell they weren’t gonna leave and op didn’t just walk back for a quick screenshot before escaping
---
It's a fucking disgrace
---
You get easy access to a steam community page.
---
But, Tapp.
---
B...but hes a doctor...with 5 stacks of devour...is this a joke?
---
Agreed. Screw it, survivors should just spawn in with a gun so they can kill the killer. EZ.
---
Myers can't if he isn't in tier 3. Huge difference.
---
That, and absolutely insist on killing the jackass with DS or crawling out with NOED active 
---
Yes, I definitely didn't mistake them.
---
thank god for that /s at the end no one would be able to tell this is sarcastic if it weren't for that important piece of info
---
Jeff/legion is the best.
---
And the survivors who do that shit know exactly how it affects killers.  I still salivate at the idea of the game being truly optimized and all the trash survivors who just crowd the killer getting destroyed for months as they try to learn how to actually play survivor.
---
Since almost all of the streamers who play this game are on PC that's how I modeled my play.  I would never think to do some of the dumb shit console survivors do to take advantage of bad optimization.
---
Now that's what I'm talking about. DBD should just become call of duty
---
The only problem would be getting a good line of sight, but I agree that like some torn up buildings would be nice 
---
Well you meet certain people who can’t read flairs so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I have better things to do with my time than searching meaningless shit. Why the fuck would I care about such stupid crap? You really need to improve your arguments. Last reply. Shut the fuck up now.
---
Oh, yeah, that might be important.
---
I'm on PS4
---
Lol, just did this trophie too.
---
Im also amazed i managed to get 5 stacks in a r1 match in ironworks of misery as doc.
---
And also assume that you will be going up against assholes who will hardcore tunnel or camp your ass. Yesterday, when I asked a killer why he tunneled me like a cunt, he asked why I looped around pallets. 
---
dtothewade14 let's go
---
Yeah as the title suggest you HAD an idea. This is a salty killer main disaster. 
---
I wasn’t even here to watch him live when he was into DBD but I wish I was, also wish he still did it. Have watched all his old videos and montages. Seems a lot more entertaining than a lot of the streamers today. Most of the streamers today (besides like 4 or 5) are shitty players who got shout outs and became popular more for the kind of vibe they give off more than skill. Tom looked like he had both and more. Would have been very entertaining to watch today for sure!
---
Well done. People bitch about the Legion being difficult to counter, but they're just as difficult to use effectively. 
---
Definitely was.
---
They said dedicated servers in summer 2019 soo....
---
100% agree
---
Rank 1 is so easy to get that all it really amounts to is playtime. It would make the ranks even more trivial to reset them closer to rank 1. 
---
There is a mandatory rank in a casual, rng game. I dont know what they can do to make it fair.
---
I'm not sure why he quit tho. He most likely got tired but I saw a dude saying he was sick of playing due to lots of people asking him to do the big spins ( he was partly known from his 360s) but I highly doubt that's true. He definitely just got tired
---
Decisive Strike*
---
I believe the developers have said that Wraith/Nurse is canon in a livestream
---
Why didn't this get more upvotes? 
---
FeelsBadMan
---
I need this!
---
r u dumb queues would be longer bc no one would pay for that 
---
80s Killer! 
---
I would stop playing if it was subscription based...
---
What about freddy?
---
I turn to see them. Chase and hit them again. Put them on a hook. No more decisive strike.
---
Could you explain a little more what you mean? What does a survivor having the obsession (DS) have to do with you not having an obsession perk? I don't know if I understand too well so I apologize if I misunderstood your point. 
---
I want tier 3  kindred that only shows killer's aura within a certain distance from the hook. I want this as  default feature. I also want borrowed time as a default game mechanic.
---
You are on a roll.
---
I feel like I won’t even be able to tell where my aura dudes even are. I have an incredibly difficult time trying to look for totem and generator outlines with the new lighting update. 
---
But that does seem like a very effective strategy if you don’t have any issues with the Dream world.
---
Your opinion is not everybody else’s opinion.
---
Outfit 'em all with L4D though, please 
---
I'm sorry
---
Literally stumbled across it without even trying one match, just happened to have devour hope XD
---
No you fucking melon the one mid way through, he's not even asleep at the start of the clip
---
Each time a survivor uses the game mechanics to their advantage, get rewarded for your own misplays. Good idea.
---
Frank and Julie for sure 
---
If this is true
---
This is fucking horrifying
---
Detroit: Become Daylight
---
maybe a new perk concept? Just smash kick the totems?? 
---
Yes, clean them up, make them shine! Entity is pleased when her totems are properly dusted and waxed.
---
Just flooded with great ideas
---
Sooner or later this is going to turn into a reception for million dollars, but...
---
Decisive Strike (Thank you u/lenesy) has two "modes"; If you're the obsession, the moment you get picked up you get a skill check to see if you can stab the killer and escape. If you're not the Obsession, you have to fill the "Wiggle Bar" to 35% before you get the Skill Check. The thing is though, is that Decisive Strike increases your chances of being the Obsession, which seems to work even if the killer isn't running any Obsession based perks.
---
So any Killer could have an Obsession despite not actually taking a perk for that, if the Survivor takes Decisive Strike. Which means that rather than having 35% of the usual time to get them on a hook, the Killer just gets screwed because of something completely out of his control.
---
Imagine one lady is attending 100 customers. She can't. Shitty example but sums it up xd
---
Overwhelming presence is actually pretty good depending on the killer.
---
Yeah, that's common, but you're not fooling anyone when the party has green ping, and sudden lag causes you to hit 2 survivors that are running in completely different directions and teleporting behind them.
---
Missing generator skillchecks should cause the generator to explode and kill the survivor and delete that gen for the rest of the match.
---
I guess death is an escape...
---
The Entity is watching you debase yourselves! Repent!
---
Stfu swf scum. You use ds as a crutch /s
---
Sweet catch. 
---
Bad comparisons that read clear as day as a survivor, simply due to how you word your NOED vs the DS
---
It would be big

So by 5 tokens, you get a non-Hexed NoED, even faster movespeed in a chase, AND an action speed buff?
---
What's to stop someone from using this to down all 4 people and THEN kill one? What's to stop a Killer from hooking people and keeping the bonuses because they only go away if you kill them by hand?
---
Holy crap, I'm transitioning into a Killer Main and *I*'m sitting here telling you to settle the hell down.
---
Yes
---
I really want these perks!!!
---
Decisive isn't the only survivor perk that makes them the obsession though. And I don't relent see how the killer is getting "screwed" here
---
Run rancor and cleanse all totems easy enough for me 
---
Isn't that the whole point of DS, though? To use it as soon as you get grabbed? Like, that's how it was intended. It would actually be awful if you had potentially 4 survs with 35% wiggle DS with no obsession, because you wouldn't know if anyone had DS. Plus, the whole reason people pick DS is so they can use it instantly, so I can't see from either killer or surv perspective how no obsession DS's would be ideal. Like you said, it's only a 1 time thing, and in fact 35% wiggle DS is way worse than obsession DS when playing as killer.
---
Except everyone would still play because the really killers would get them if they didnt
---
It would be balanced if once a survivor is it, lose 2 tokens
---
Same thing happened to me! Except even though it said I escaped and got the 5k survival the killer was able to pick up my body and up me on a hook lol. No idea how. 
---
Okay me literally bought him for his perks and have never played him even once. Even looking at him makes me angry.
---
Gets mad at you for correcting him 😂
---
The Killer is being screwed by having drawbacks to perks they aren't equipping.
---
It'd be like the Killers having the ability to randomly afflict Broken on a Survivor at the start of the game. How is that fair to the Survivor?
---
Tier 3 kindred would fix 2 problems: facecamping and a huge chunk of the imbalance between randoms/SWF. Making it a basic mechanic would probably justify giving killers a general buff as well but it´d be worth it.
---
So we're going to balance something based on the fact that only one person may have it, not four? We're also going to balance it because every killer that plays the game 100% has NOED? Oh wait, killers don't have that "May have the perk" they just all always have it. I got you.
---
Ah I see you have Left Behind. That pretty much cancels out Dying Light. Could have come in handy for me.
---
Who doesnt love paying more money for low quality services 
---
Lol yea he’s not the smartest redditor I’ve come across
---
You're not making any sense. One of the survivors being an obsession doesn't have any drawbacks
---
Same for me, all friends I play with are EST (NY, NJ and Florida) and at night time (11pm and later) it can take forever to find a game if an event is not happening. Worse when the killer doesn’t want to play against a SWF group and disconnects as soon as we enter the lobby. Daytime games (10am - 2pm) are nonstop. After 2pm it can slow down but still happens.  
---
Add me im “slashing_zombies” ill message u when i get on
---
 Oh and is there a preferred age group?
---
To your first point in this comment, I was saying how it would be awful if you could have 4 survs with DS and not know if any of them had it. So, you're going to waste time playing around 35% wiggle ds by dribbling them if you carry them for a certain amount of time? And yes, a lot of people use DS, certainly not 90% of survivors.
---
Your second point. If they get downed right under a hook, what does it matter if they have ds or not? How often are survs getting downed right by hooks anyway?
---
Your third point. Let's say you have a game and you see someone has the obsession. Most likely, it's because they have DS. So, you down them, and you either dribble them or they DS you. Now, you're going after someone else. You down them (probably not right next to a hook as someone with 35% wiggle DS would avoid close hooks). You're going to a hook or to the basement, and they wiggle for 35% and DS you. What was worse?
---
The reason why 35% wiggle DS is worse is because you have no way to play around it. At least with obsession DS, you know whether to dribble them or to just leave them on the ground. 35% DS is so much worse because you don't even know if they have this pretty powerful perk; therefore, you don't know how to play around it.
---
The game can’t even run 4v1 half the time lmao how would it run with 100 people
---
Killer is so fun. 
---
You must be really good then. Because for me it's the opposite, I'm on Rank 9 and I can't ease up for a second and every match feels like torture. I only get 4Ks when people try to troll me but I get the every once in a lifetime good match where it's back and forward. And Hex Ruin sucks, mine always spawn out in the fucking open.
---
So you're just mad at DS in general? Like, I agree. It's one of the most op perks for sure. I just don't think we understand your point of like it would be better to make it wiggle DS with no obsession. Like, I don't think anyone here likes DS as a part of the game. 
---
Even if that were true, it doesn't counter my point and you still have yet to establish yours.
---
You say it doesn't have any drawbacks, but I'm pretty sure "Instant" is much better than "Slightly Delayed". So how doesn't being the Obsession benefit a Survivor with Decisive Strike?
---
Trapper as a backup plan if they’re good at reading traps, Freddy for the bloodwarden combo, and then nurse because I’m a mediocre nurse. I pretty much feel anyone with an instadown doesn’t need it, and the other m1 killers I prefer other builds on 
---
Survivor, I like sneaking around and getting chased. Hearing that heartbeat when I pull the gate switch.... ahhh so fun!!
---
He has such a strange argument about this perk. Like, we can talk about whether or not it belongs in the game, if it should be taken out etc., but this thing about making it not an obsession perk is weird to me.
---
We need those dedicated servers
---
Anyone can get to Rank 1 with any killer. If you can at least get 1 kill a game, and hook every survivor twice you can get a pip. It insanely easy to pip with killer, and that one of the problems with this game. inexperience killers get to rank 3-10 and aren't experience enough to be able to match wits, and at the beginning of every Rank reset the killer queues are extreme long because killers can get to level 1-5 easier. 
---
I don't know where all the defense for NOED suddenly came from, people used to call it out for what it was, a cheap perk that just rewards failure. I never thought that as a killer main if I had the chance to remove a perk from the game I would choose NOED over DS. 
---
10 doctors, 10 nurses, all on The Game. 
---
I do it to scare you away from the boxes so it'd be hard for you to get the RTB off, to hook you so when you get the RTB off I could kill you easier later, or if you're the only person I see.((I'm leaving without a kill)) I also enjoy slugging a single survivor with the RTB so someone get off of gens and help that person and the person being helped wastes their time trying to get the RTB off.  
---
That aside, I don't usually tunnel people with the RTBs on. 
---
My point was that you were making it sound like having an obsession had something inherently wrong with it. You weren't clear about the fact that your issue was with the survivor being to instantly jump off. The way you worded it was just confusing honestly.
---
Anyway, sure, DS is annoying. But you can play around it, and if you're a good killer it shouldn't ruin your whole game.
---
Distortion should make the survivors invisible and unable to be seen by killers and aura reading perks 
---
“You made fun of the killer,” 
---
Quite clearly insinuates that I did not make fun of the other. 
---
Your a lost cause, I’m done with arguing with you over a mistake you made yet refuse to admit to. 
---
Also, did you really just bring politics into this? We are talking about a video game, how desperate must you be to talk bad about who I would assume is your president to bring it up in an argument that has nothing to do with anything political? 
---
You also went on to say that I voted for trump before you said, “whatever country you are in.”
---
Make up your mind, am I American or not? 
---
The benefit is that the killer doesn't know you have DS, and therefore doesn't know that they should play around it. Then you DS the killer at 35% when they thought they were going to get a hook.
---
Walk towards the light.
---
Bloodhound, STBFL, bbq, and ruin/thanantaphobia
---
Yeah he worded it so oddly
---
I would kill for "The Wolfman"
---
Killer ability could be a running pounce? Kinda similar to Piggy's ambush, but maybe with nerfed-steering like Billy's chainsaw? It'd be neat to say the least
---
no
---
My only problem with playing against freddy is that the best way to play is to stall, and sometimes i just wanted one last quick game before going somewhere, and now the game is gonna take forever
---
Oh no no no, I'm sorry if I wasn't clear.
---
Keep the Obsession portion of it. Keep the Non-Obsession portion of it. Allow it to steer the Killer's Obsession to that particular player. Don't allow it to force the Killer to have an Obsession if they don't have an Obsession perk equipped.
---
So if the Killer doesn't have Dying Light, PLay with your Food, Rancor, Remember Me, or Save the Best for Last the Survivors *can't* be the Obsession.
---
This is the longest "expanding brain" meme I ever have seen and the end basically repeats it all over again.
---
What's the Moonrise Event?
---
Finally, someone else who understands that you're not supposed to play Freddy like the other killers, and that his playstyle is actually quite enjoyable once you manage to fit all the pieces together.
---
When you get *Ruin* teachable
---
Screams in *Hag*
---
Are they really nerfing leader? "We're not finished with legion yet". Then why the fuck did you release him? I like legion but that it idiocracy right there. I see why people trash the devs.
---
You can if you feel like they deserve it. But remember the sweetest kills are the ones most heavily salted.
---
That bun would make me think you're a Jake main
---
you cant see the auras? I don't have that problem, do you happen to be colorblind? maybe you should get checked, I heard that colorblind people have trouble with auras in this game.
---
Enduring does jack shit for the fact that the survivor still gets off the killer's shoulder. 
---
Oh huh weird...Ive never seen that, I hope it clears up because thats very odd
---
That sounds about right though, since if you're going to zone in on one target that target *should* get bonuses to fend you off.
---
Also, you're kind of arguing over yourself; you're saying way less people would use DS with this change, but also that Killers would be punished because they aren't as good as DS is while Obsessed.

If less people are using the punishing perks, then that means that the Killer Obsession Perks just got buffed.
---
Better than Bunny Feng being released?
---
I would like to know this too please
---
Because it covers the somewhat recent drama. Which is more meta than another "Freddy is weak" post.
---
Except survivors are just lazy and entitled and don't want anything to impede their genrush or punish them for focusing on just gens.
---
It's not cheating. It's a desync bug with the latest patch. I had the same thing against a Leatherface. I was at a pallet healing, but the LF swung somewhere near me (far, but not so far that I couldn't see him) and it downed me and then it teleported me to him when he picked me up. There's a HUGE desync bug with the Trapper's traps, but there's also one that has a really small chance of happening with (probably) every killer, like I described. 
---
Shows how easy it is. Just play a lot.
---
Ehhh... Doc's got a great 1-off with Madness 1, but after that he's pretty easy to stealth barring a Doc that has mastered the art of Restraint.  Both of them are tracking snowball killers though, and I would argue that Freddy's the overall better of the two.
---
Also, as mentioned in my initial tl;dr post I'm also a bit annoyed about Doc right now.  I love playing him but I get real tired of the pitiful range on his baseline zap.
---
Nice username op
---
But both scratch mirror and vanity mirror prevent you from reaching tier 3... So you can't use tombstone...
---
I wasn't aware of any drama with deranking. Mind linking me?

Ikr

*Me, an intellectual rank 12 killer main*: gets a match with 2 rank 5s and a rank 2.
---
Excusemewhathefuck
---
Dribble doesn't always work. The hook has to be close. You can always cleanse totems.
---
decisive, adrenaline, sprint burst, iron will
---
l - l - l - LAG SWITCHER
---
Did anyone have No Mither? If they did, then you’re pretty much screwed unless the hook respawns before someone can break it. No Mither lets you heal yourself out of the dying state an unlimited amount of times. 
---
If they didn’t have No Mither, then just slug them to death. If you see a hook nearby, then try to hook them and if it gets destroyed before you get there, then drop the Survivor. 
---
New cosmetic please!!
---
i usually do one slow crouch so it's kinda like "i could teabag you, but i'm not gonna so i'm gonna do it differently"
---
In the chat after the game. 
---
... so they'll come out in Spring 2020 and battle royale will be 3 years after 
---
I hate Thrill of the Hunt on principle and almost never run it because of that. And NOED is just a perk I use when I don't have anything better as I'm leveling up the bloodweb. I drop it as soon as possible. It's good, I just don't like it because it relies on people finishing gens. I base my playstyle around that not happening at all. 
---
Nothing would be better than bunny feng 
---
Seeing a normal doc, young huntress, and a teenaged clown would top my list
---
          Did you not hear *Waste your time trying to get them*? I know how mindgames work, it’s just that they don’t work on half the loops because they’re too big to try and get the survivor to fuck up. You HAVE to rely on the survivor not knowing how to properly loop, and if they do know, welp, might as well leave them. Good survivors are almost ALWAYS more powerful than a good killer, because there’s a skullcap on killers, but there’s practically none on a survivor. 
---
            Shit, I’ve gone entire games without even seeing a certain survivor because they know the best hiding spots and most covered routes. The game is biased heavily towards survivors. If you can’t see that, I recommend playing a few dozen matches as killer to see what I’m saying.
---
never in my life have I ever played a game on console where people would purposely go and message you just to be salty, the community is quite toxic and idk why
---
The Pebble is our one true savior 
---
it's a blessing as a survivor when killers run lullaby. it's really easy to hit skillchecks, even at 5 tokens. You just gotta pay attention and really focus. Waste of a perk slot IMO.
---
No need for TOTH to be honest. Ideally you would run nurses and ruin instead of those two.
---
Plug a second mouse in to get a second cursor, play DbD in windowed (bordered) mode and shake the screen up and down to cancel out the bobbing 
---
What are you going to do when dedicated servers get here? All survivors will join at the same time then. Even if they aren’t swf. 
---
Got it. 
---
Hold up what’s going on
---
Oh, I don't know the Ps4 version. My bad. 
---
These are both unsafe pallets lol
---
So true LOL
---
Yeah I dont get if OP knew that and that's why it's supposed to be funny or if he really thinks this is a good build. I'm confused.
---
Be some pretty cool purple skins
---
Good luck.
---
This subreddit HATES us twitch streamers, so you're gonna get this downvoted, buried, and removed by moderators.  
---
And maybe even some hateful messages beforehand :(
---
It's not countered by slugging. 
---
I think more of a Silent Hill vive would be cool for a map. Like a small town not a suburb
---
as someone who plays killer, that's overpowered, you could totally intentionally get those token and become god.
---
You don't know how mind games work. There are cases where there is no room for mind gaming in DbD, for example, Nurse. Can't really mind game a nurse. Distortion is another example. There's nothing a killer can do about Distortion.
---
Looping, however, is certainly a part of the game where both surv and killer can mind game. You are just not good at it right now. And there are plenty of killers who loop successfully. And honestly, sometimes the most successful "mind game" at a loop for a killer is to just keep going. Don't double back, don't respect pallets, just chase the survivor. You are 15% faster than they are. You can keep saying how a good survivor will almost ALWAYS loop more powerfully than a killer, but that is just wrong. I think it is more correct to say that good survivors will almost always lose YOU in a chase. Not every killer/player.
---
If you've gone entire games without seeing a single survivor, try out different perks. There are plenty of aura reading perks for killer. Maybe even try out Doctor. The game is no longer biased heavily towards survivors, it's the most balanced it has ever been excluding legion. If we take out Legion, it's pretty balanced, and a lot of people would even say that it is in the killer's favor. 
---
Thank you for the heads up! I’ve played against him before, glad I didn’t get hit off.
---
Nah I’m just saying that’s pretty funny Christ even in the photo you can see me revving my chainsaw in preparation to destroy them 
---
Dude im actually deranking right now before rank reset so i can go even lower as i read this. This actually made me turn off the game ill stop deranking for now
---
I mean, this isn't a place to just plug your content without ever taking part in anything else in the sub.
---
the killer actually tries to kill you? outrageous. but yeah they should fix queue times if that's truly a problem
---
Well together they can loop pretty hard and it also still two potential stuns and they are right next to a window 
---
Two windows actually and an up stairs window which can be looped with balanced landing

Of course prediction is the number one thing, going up against higher ranked survivors it becomes less about pallet looping and more about predicting where nurse will be so being one step ahead will help, as a nurse on PS4 (I don't main her but I play her every once and a while rnk 3 killer) 2 things I say will actually serperate a great nusre from a good nurse, mind games the other thing is you relize at a certain point you don't always have to use your teleport,  you don't teleport to a survivor if there out on the open and you know theres no pallets near by. When you teleport with out a central point of prediction (I.e pallet ,door, window) you really are just opening up more mind games for yourself. Im sorry if this was a bit jumbled but I really just typed my thoughts as I went 
---
What? Stealth is a core mechanic of the game when survs are screaming while injured, there are tons of aura reading perks, etc? Stealth is certainly a part of the game, but the core is chases. And I wasn't at ALL complaining losing to killers, nor was I calling on the devs to nerf killers. And the game is fun, so that's why I play it.
---
I really have no idea what you're even saying.
---
Exhaustion needs nothing,but reseting ? thats a giant no.
---
The only reason I care about getting tunneled is when i'm playing SwF, because I know I then have to wait an extensive period of time to get into the next game.
---
Lol I started playing 2 weeks ago during winter event and he’s all I used and leveled at the time. Love him to death and got all his teachables but no one else. :p Working on Nurse and Hag tho.
---
Still it’s quicker to kick it 
---
"thats not lag, its fps drop" shut up you're not smart you know what he means.
---
I was adamant to learn her first when I started playing, she is my main. It was a tad rough going into the game like that and her being the only killer I’d play lol but it was worth. Don’t be afraid to teleport often, use it to get to where you think you’re prey is at fast, you can cover so much ground with her in a short period of time. Anticipate the moves of the survivors, you can catch them if you are able to anticipate where they are headed, especially if they lose sight of you and aren’t in your line of sight. Anticipation tends to be a friend when playing Nurse. Nurse calling, thanataphobia are keepers for sure as far as perks, mixed with any other great perks. Nurse can be tough at times, definitely a learning curve that can really throw you off if you get survivors who are able to get away from you. Do not tunnel vision! I feel like with nurse it’s easy to do and can really screw you up and trigger you lol. If someone eludes you often, go and teleport to others. Have fun and I hope I can help some, she’s definitely a blast to play and catch people with. 
---
For a sec I thought you were posting this on my ACTUAL deranking post. But this response here made me chuckle.
---
On the end game screen where it shows everyone's points, pressing X on someone's name will bring up their PS profile, and from there you can message them.  It has frequently been bugged lately though and not bringing up profiles like it should, if that happens you would need to search for them manually by typing their name in search after making a new message. The latter is much more hassle so if their profile doesn't get brought up, I'll usually just move on but it is an option.
---
I don't give a fuck about people being toxic. I care that they break the game with comms
---
are you implying dying light is a crutch? man what isn't a crutch to the dbd community these days.
---
And if you have no perks?
---
I seem like the type of guy who "intentionally refuses to use it?" You mean, the type of guy who just chooses not to? "Intentionally refuses to use it" implies like I'm not doing it because of this moral position, or to advocate for something. I just don't like stealth, so I don't do it. 
---
Stealth is a real option that several people use. The whole point of my original comment is that it's wrong to think that pallet looping and 360'ing is being a pretentious dick. And that relying on stealth won't help the group survive, nor is it all that fun. You may find it fun, and that's super cool.
---
Also, you're somehow educating me while simultaneously not really giving any points. And honestly, I don't want you to. I've had too many conversations about how "stealth is actually really good though." And you have offended me SO much. I'm shaking.
---
&gt;Make 2 queues 1 for free and 1 for subscribers.
---
Have fun playing with the same 4 other people every match.
---
There should be at least 1 more before dedicated servers. They're always working on the bugs. Isn't the release of dedicated for "summer"? remember that the BBQ event happened "summer."
---
I understand your pain, but tis the nature of the game really, you just have to play around it. and hey, if you're playing sfw, tell everyone to play as the same survivor and skin, killer will have a hard time tunneling then.
---
You misunderstand me. I love the game but playing as killer feels like a chore. It gets worse when you rank up. It ceases to be fun and it becomes stressful. I have to take long breaks. 
---
Because they have a set schedule.
---
Every 3 months a killer must release.
---
It's a feature, it just takes a while unless the trapper uses hangmans trick.
---
Franklin's is good for flash light spammers because they cant do they annoying pallet blind loop
---
if thats truly the whole point of your original comment then I agree with you, looping and 360ing itself doesn't make you a dick, it just didnt seem that way.
---
This has and always will be a thing. I don't get why all of a sudden everyone is making such a huge fucking deal out of it now. Cause some streamers cried about it? Is that why?
---
Lagswitching is rare but extremely obvious when it happens. I use mlga and when you're sitting at green ping then going from 200-400 the moment the game starts it's obvious what's going on.
---
Random killer lag is bs and you're right about how in the dark you are about it. You have decent ping all game then a spike at a critical moment which can cause you to stop struggling for example. It'll be fixed once dedicated servers roll out.
---
pretty sure the point is if they're using an extremely strong "sweaty" build you won't have time to do noed prevention
---
Isn't the reset based on the time in NA? 
---
Just lag lol
---
I’m not a killer main but I do think that I can offer an explanation. 
---
It’s a latency issue. On his screen you were likely closer. Because the Killer is the host, it’s what’s on his screen that matter. 
---
When dedicated servers get here, this issue should be mitigated. It will likely still exist, but should be less extreme. 
---
Guy saying this post was pointless 
---
I got a down because I didn’t drop them if I broke them I would have lost them the survivor was stupid and fell for a mind game 
---
Being dead ass, i ranked from 20 to 14 with non stop dubs. Either 3 kills or 4 kills, mostly 4. One game I only got 2 but that's because they had amazing coordination. Really it all comes down to how good you are at chases. Typically, I only use the power to initiate chase and guarantee a hit and if I land 2, it makes things a little more stressful for them.   Occasionally I will go for the 4 frenzy strike down, but that's typically only in situations where they are good at running from the killer, I feel it's more worth it to jump a barrier/window to get the 3rd frenzy hit and take the stun than have to plan to move around them. Knowing damn well that your next frenzy hit is a down or that their counter is low enough where you've got a guaranteed knock down is orgasmic my man
---
I do agree he needs a buff with his ability, its main purpose for me has simply been to have a guaranteed engaging first hit. Only like 5-10% of my downs have been from the ability taking place. In a game where most survivors are still alive, chasing someone down waiting for the ability to take place is kind of pointless since they'll knock out gens with ease, but if you get maybe 1-2 dead, that starts to become a viable strategy. It becomes very easy late game cause late game means less gens to patrol and, if you play the legion right, less people to kill. Most of my games have ended with 1-2 gens left. 
---
I have never felt such ease when it comes to knocking survivors down, the original guaranteed first hit only really countered by sprint burst is a sexy sexy thing. If you've got yellow-purple addons, shit just gets a whole lot easier with your ability. Mainly I just love the killer because he's fun. All statistics aside, you're a fuckin cultist that runs at godspeed and can chain like 5 hits in one if they felt like it. Maybe it's just cause i'm a high schooler, but I also love the killer's lore. All of that kind of gives me an adrenaline boost and that makes me play better. 
---
TIPS: 
---
\-Initial hit(s) with ability, chase afterwards for normal hit. Only go for 4 frenzy hit knock downs in barrier / window rich areas since it makes more sense to take the stun than to move around windows/barriers.
---
\-In a clump, hit all the survivors with frenzy. All of them having the debuff will slow things down majorly for them
---
\-Use addons, especially ones that slow down heal speed. 
---
\-Your focus shouldn't be an immediate hook. You can knock someone down and then go after another. It's incredibly easy to knock a person down as legion. Two knocked down survivors + Deerstalker = Profit
---
\-Chase down survivor with deep wound only if gens are doing well for you, there's like 1-2 survivors left, or they're only at like 1/4 bar left
---
Summary
---
A good legion is able to knock down any survivor in the first chase they see them, but the legion is counteracted by a long enough chase time to make gen repairs concerning. Your goal should be to keep the survivors in the game as long as possible so that you can track them down one by one and kill them. The ability helps in the initial hit and additionally gives a nice little slow down for survivors since they NEED to get rid of it, hence the add on that makes healing it longer being important. As survivors die, the game slows down and the ability starts to become far more useful. Time is no longer a worry and you can put in that effort to ensuring a quick knock down of survivors.
---
But you just told me the bleedout time is reset, so if they heal the survivor and I down them again instantly I'm faced with another full bar that I need to wait out. I don't see any other option than camping that. 
---
I agree with both. Maybe his base setting speed should be only slightly faster, but that would make him way more fun to play as and I don't think it affects survivors in a negative way what so ever. Really good buff idea for Trapper.

I agree with you. I can’t even justify paying $20 for PS Now, let alone $30 to play one single game a month. That’s outrageous for one game, $5-$10 perhaps but even then would make me question it. 
---
I completely agree
---
Lol
---
It's rarely an issue. Freddy is one of those killers where you can play 20 games and then that 21st game is just hell. They all have Adrenaline and wake up and just every weakness of his gets exploited.
---
ive never done this as a killer tho :(
---
You don’t know if it would work or not ? I would rather play with the same 4 serious players than some losers who cherry pick matches because they got no balls to play challenging matches.  
---
The bleed out timer does reset, but if you camp it, then the other Survivors can just ignore it and rush the gens. 
---
Right. I second this. Some games are shit but most are pretty decent
---
why dont you just.... snap out of it ya crazy survivor
---
Same thing has been happening to me over the past few days so you’re definitely not alone in this. Happens a lot when I’m trying to heal someone, and then they run off and I’m like, ‘Damn... sorry,’ even though it’s not technically my fault. 
---
le iron maiden time
---
The hatch will only spawn when a certain number of generators are done. The rule is the number of survivors alive + 1. For example, if 3 survivors remain that's 3+1=4, so 4 generators need to be done for it to even spawn. So, 1 survivor left (you) +1=2. You need at least 2 gens done for it to spawn. For the longest time I tried so hard to find it when no gens were done like an idiot lol.

Add me! Been looking for more people to play with in my spare time. My user is: amberperrys. 
---
Yup. Finally decided to bite the bullet and buy leatherface the other day. It was hellish but I played him to get level 40, then swore to never touch that killer again.
---
i get a game in like 3 seconds as killer at rank 1. killer queues are fixed. unless youre like rank 16-20 and if thats the case go learn to play the game a bit more before spewing misinformation
---
then stop bullying dwights

"stupid killers and their stupid crutches smh" \*runs into killers arms\*
---
Hopefully it’s fixed in the ptb 
---
1060 at least, before "optimisation patch". For me 1060 on a new map still drop frames to 40 fps, because of its shit optimization. 
---
And I play at medium, so if you want max, I imagine 1070 at least, for this graphically advance game.
---
Except Doctor doesn't have to do shit to find survivors, makes getting out more difficult, and with add ons has essentially equal tracking to Freddy all game. 
---
if a killer is camping you're supposed to stay up on the hook as long as possible to waste their time...
---
Dead hard, self care, pharmacy, Deja vu
---
I just want like a last man standing game mode where there is no objectives say 20 survivors 1 killer and the game ends when there is 1 survivor left
---
It depends. If you mean in a "I out smarted you in cat-and-mouse so I won" type of way then killer. I like to try and be a few steps ahead of the survs if I can. That also comes with a healthy dose of stress and salt though.
---
If you mean in a "Im goofing off and dont care if I live or die" kind of way then survivor. Its fun to see how close you can cut it sometimes 
---
Oh yeah I thought I mentioned earlier. Red green Deutan stuff. Kinda mild but I guess it heavily impacts me in DBD. I’m actually really glad that the recent update made the aura of hooks and gens way better because they are very easy to see as other killers. But with Freddy it was more of a nerf. 
---
Quick question, is where a way to force certain resolution of the game? Configure .ini file or something?
---
Keep deluding yourself son ;)
---
I don’t get what the picture is related to
---
Instant death on hooks and whenever you are within a certain range you would get a sound prompt like whispers. Perks could be disables bigger maps.
---
Pretty cute to be honest, and I'm not even into dudes.
---
Monitor and Abuse works really well with this strategy, as it makes you more stealthy and it upgrades your aura reading.
---
Huntress Lullaby can also work as an alternative to Hex: Ruin, as you're basically forcing the survivors to constantly fail skillchecks, so this perk capitalizes on that.
---
It is an annoyed irl Claudette.
---
basement bubba would love to play against survivors like you
---
As much as I love playing Freddy in a different way compared to the other killers, the other main reason why he's getting reworked is that he's simply not fun to play against as survivors.
---
Yeah it's a bug, it has happened to me and others.I believe it only counts the time when you're healing a teammate? 
---
This hurts
---
the slower sacrifice progression is a terrible idea, camping is an already terrible strategy, just do gens.
---
I'm saying you can access that screen postmatch while in the escaped/sacrificed/entity displeased screen by hitting start and scrolling over to it. 
---
M&amp;A paintbrush is my favorite to go against cause i usually run OoO and it's double sided wallhacks on each other, the mindgames are beyond real
---
But they are. That one extra chase IS a game changer considering that 3 other survivors are doing gens at that very moment and soon ting ting ting 3 gens are done and they open an exit.
---
oof, they should add some sort of colorblind options tbh.
---
Iridescent Heads + Infantry Belt = Power Level Over 9000
---
Somebody didn't get the fucking joke apparently and downvoted me, XD
---
decisive, self care, dead hard, deliverance or borrowed time. if using deliverance flashlight if borrowed time med kit w syringe. naturally burn fog boosters
---
Came to say this.
---
Oh, well that's handy dandy then. I've had many matches where I wanted to message someone but it wouldn't bring up the profile so I just didn't, though that's usually messaging the killer after a survivor match so maybe that still wouldn't work. I'll have to try it out, good to know!
---
Never even played him, just dumped bp into him lol I might farm next double bp or something since I have a few bps on him.
---
I could see two sides of this. On one hand I could understand getting frustrated by this, I SWF with my sister using Discord and we're not toxic but we get dodged anyway. This has gotten better though, it was really bad back then.   
---
On the other? Playing against SWF could be irritating. There's nothing more powerful than information and that along with time could lead to a killer's downfall really quick. I don't have a problem with SWF or Discord as without it, a lot of players will just bounce but I could understand killers not wanting to deal with it. A lot of SWFs are assholes too so that don't help either. Not to mention, Dead by Daylight is a game and you want to have fun with a game. That's normal. Losing all the fucking time is not fun. I get there's winners and there are losers. I don't mind losing per say but I hate matches that are frustratingly annoying. 
---
I play both survivor and killer, but mostly killer and I find the latter to be more stressful and less fun to play. Not to add to the already high validation of killers in this sub but as someone pointed out earlier, I rather just leave than to enter a match that I know I'm going to get stomped on. It's a waste of my mental health and a waste of my time. But do I enjoy a good challenge? Yes. Survivors come up with some pretty cool counter plays and I love back and forward matches. But I'm not about to spend half an hour getting humiliated. 
---
lmao gatme
---
noed makes the end game exciting, ds makes the game frustrating.
---
I hear this frequently, and if that's truly the case then they need to push back the Freddy rework and deal with the disaster that is Legion ASAP.
---
Or just break all the totems.. And don't miss the skill check. Too EZ. 😂😂😂😂
---
I was gonna guess Coxcombed + The Ghost Mud.
---
Some math for quick fix tier 3:

**1 person on gen with quick fix**
---
Gen time: 61.5
---
**2 people on a gen with quick fix**
---
Gen time: 35.7 seconds
---
**3 people on a gen with quick fix**
---
Gen time: 25.6 seconds
---
**4 people on a gen with quick fix**
---
Gen time: 21.9

It would be somewhat decent if the exposed effect weren't so short and if it was revealing the aura instead of just the doctor-like reveal
---
What makes you say that it would be less extreme? If anythings its probably gonna get worse, queuetimes too
---
if you've played killer enough, you have this game sense where you can pretty accurately predict when a survivor is going to go for a save, going to the hook when you know they're about to unhook isn't camping. anyone know what Im talking about?
---
PepeHands 
---
Agreed, and Iron Maiden should instantly kill any survivor who steps into a locker. 
---
Oof
---
Well, god never gave us a non competitive game mode :(
---
Enduring is amazing, but the fact remains that the requirements for killer are greater
---
Why would it get worse? As it is now, hits are determined on the killer’s screen. With dedicated servers the hit would be determined by what the server is seeing. That may not be exactly what the survivor or the killer sees, but it will absolutely be more in the middle. 
---
I like dying light with the purple add ons. Also throw in a good ruin spawn and begrimed debuff for LF.
---
Well the killers needs more advantages the gen Rush is a real problem and the secondary objetive like the totems help to end with it but the survs dont do the totems in that case the only other thing to do is extended generators time but the survs dont want that to if you want a so easy game the Gates has to be open in the start 
---
Also nice there’s a bug rn where it won’t alert survivors of DH when you’ve gotten to the point people can be instadowned and moried.
---
shhh dont tell them about freddy
---
This is an asymmetrical game, its not supposed to be fair for both parties. Plus, the ds change would make it even easier to for survivors and the noed change is just haunted grounds, but more complicated and is 10x worse. Both of the perks are fine because they both exist, Yin and Yang style.
---
Thank you for legitimately offering advice instead of condemning me. 
---
I don't use mori and dying light exclusively together :\^)
---
🗿
---
Instead of server to survivor its gonna be killer server survivor depending on their netcode this could get really asstastic imaging getting 100ping servers as a killer probably might just wanna disconnect right away also asias gonna get fucked by change like this
---
How often does that work for you?
---
Survivors should just beat up the killer 4 on one and the nurses mori should take 2-3 mins
---
Ha, best one yet.
---
The killer is already stunned when you go out of the killer's grasp. And that noed isn't good. It'd be better if they just take both out.
---
Oh no, the Killer didn't want to deal with bullshit in their game, the horror!
---
*leaves locker* AHHHHHH!
---
Ah that makes sense, I thought the gen we were working on just finished as a bug or something 
---
I miss the days when I didn't own every perk. Prestiging and getting the perk I want is a bitch.
---
OwO whats this? a wittle suwvivow awlll alone uwu, let miss piggy help you owo
---
&gt;Ah that makes sense, I thought the gen we were working on just finished as a bug or something

 Ah that makes sense, I thought the gen we were working on just finished as a bug or something

Playing killer is not always fun to start. You can't see anything. You don't know who is anywhere. And what even are your abilities because you don't know. To top it off, survivors can be rude.
---
Bottom line: when you first play killer, you will lose. A lot probably. But take what happened with each loss and figure out what you could do better. Did you spend too long in a chase while the others did gens? Were you using your abilities to their full potential? Are you being looped for days? Figuring all that out takes practice.
---
So my advice when you're starting out as killer is not to have kills in mind for a game. You're not going to magically 4k. Instead, make it a goal to improve on something. Maybe it's guessing where survivors are going to go to heal or how they may try to juke you. Use how you play as a survivor to inform those decisions. Maybe it's when and when not to use your killer's ability. Just take it slow and don't beat yourself because you didn't kill anyone.
---
Kill other survivors,  cleanse totems. Jfc shits annoying, shut the fuck up.  Im stock of coming to this sub just see you idiots complain and complain about a game that was clearly never meant to be played religiously. 
---
woa! I didn't even have the option to do that, maby they fixed it but not the mori.
---
I had a wraith use dying light. And he chased me for 4 gens. Finally got me down. Then i got off hook and he couldnt catch me again. So he had to mori someone else because he gave up trying to get dying light off me. It shows that you will get tunneled no matter what. He had 2 people come and try and block hits for me but he wouldnt hit them. He would only chase me
---
Ya most of the time I can literally call out loud “save” as I’m in chase or heading somewhere right before a survivor gets off hook
---
The game is one of my favorite maps though :( and OoO is one of my favorite perks:(
---
I dont play pig, but I imagine its smart to apply a trap if another survivor currently has one on and its ticking down, if they have one on and its not ticking down, then dont put it on. the exception to this is the first down you get.
---
The issue was perks would appear by rarity so every brown perk would have shown up before a yellow perk and so on. So getting a perk to red was impossible before getting every other perk to that point too.
---
as Freddy main, I do too enjoy his power as it is. just want the Dream World dark again.
---
but also, I've been playing him for almost a year now and it's more like I *learned* to love his power, you know what I mean? it's like a forced marriage. I only bought the game because of him and still am disappointed how he has no impact on Dream World physics. can't change the look of the things, teleport or create something weird and all the things that made Fred so loveable. there's nothing attached to lore in the Dream World. I'd like to see something of this kind, an addition to his powers, more objectives. like Trapper and his traps, Freddy who could visually close windows and render pallets used, and it's manually, like Trapper. basically at start you would be bending the reality to your liking with your dream transition ability. the counter to these would be Window of Opportunity. or something, you know. it's what I want to see in the rework.
---
amazing
---
Awww thank you
---
Not even kidding I thought that was thanos in the picture

also you can disrespect pallets so its nice
---
Fantastic post. I love players who actually take the time to figure out how to properly play something regarded as low tier. People don't realize killers need to be played differently. Yes, Freddy seems pretty bad if you just chase focus one survivor and break pallets.
---
I never assume lagswitching anymore. But I'm not entirely convinced the latency bar is accurate most of the time in the lobby at this point. I've had good games where the bar is constantly yellow and fluctuates from 150 to 230. No bullshit happens, game is fine. But then I'll occasionally find a Killer who I get a consistent 80-95ish, and shit starts rubberbanding immediately and doesn't stop for the whole game.
---
BAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH You're so mad omg, AAAAHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHA LMAO. Keep reporting it internet tough guy, LMAAAAAOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHaH CRY HARDER LOLLLLLL!!!

I know but at which time? 😂

Lobby Dodge =/= DC though...

And you’re a fucking loser who won’t stop following me and trolling.

Get a fucking life dude.

Probably about six or 8 in the morning

Sole Survivor should instantly kill all other three survivors the moment the match starts.
---
Same, I really enjoy learning the ins and outs of different killers, and while there are certain characters that don't have much to actually pull them out of the low tier, it's inspiring to see the people that are taking the time to learn them try to find something.
---
Welcome to the toxic fog my friend!
---
Yeah I was thinking Exhaustion was too much.
---
A happy ending for everyone but the Entity.
---
Ugh why do you have to try to ruin it for him?
---
Congratulations! 
---
Yeah
---
Manbun gets me, 10/10 😍
---
What’s a Jake main?
---
A nearly extinct species
---
WAIT. WAIT .WAIT. You forgot the part where i didn't use Ruin and by the time i was done chasing the first guy everyone got 3 gens but then he used DS so now i have to chase him again now the last 2 gens are done and exit gates are open and the guy i was chasing for 3 minutes has adrenaline. As a rank 1 killer this only happened to me twice but i am a very good player and its rare for the survivors to get more then 3 gens done but it happens.
---
Lmao I actually bought him for that and that is exactly hoe I treated him when I got it.
---
Actually it was said that with the way the match making system is currently lobby dodging could cause long wait times because if someone dc in a region could be matched up before others.  So yes there is everything wrong with lobby dodging. 
---
the crows are pretty bad still, they dont fly away 
---
I like how you were mori’ing the air and Claudette’s standing there like: “hey, his it going?”
---
If they have the iron grasp/agitation then you aren't getting. If you're near a hook then you aren't getting it.
---
people say this, yet, whenever I play against him, that isnt the case, weird. 
---
How?
---
I've played with him before too, He's really weird he makes LFG posts a lot don't join them
---
Yep - I can see how from a chase perspective that would be very annoying. I think maybe it shouldn't affect Exhaustion either, or at least not entirely debuff it.
---
Frank is original. Joe is black dude with karambit knife and skull bandana
---
why did we have to get the shitty reboot freddy?
---
I'm impressed by your juke but I dont appreciate your caption little miss.
---
Funny thing, I saw someone use a Medkit like this, but it was yellow, I forgot to tell them though
---
It's an online game problem more so. People can be the worst. Survivors will yell at you for camping or having crutch perks and just spout all nasty stuff when you start killing them. And you already saw what happens when you don't get anybody. It's really funny that, like you said, survivors can make players not want to pick killer.
---
We can't change other people's actions, but we can change our own. Gotta keep on keeping on, hun. I'm not saying you have to stick with killer, but I will say that there is nothing more satisfying than catching a cocky person at the exit gate and hooking them as their buddies all leave. Then you just stand with them as they die. The chat afterwards will no doubt be priceless, but be nice or stay mute.
---
literally a perk just for corn lmfao
---
This lets you revive mori'd people
---
This is why I run bond, and why I think it's the best perk in the game. I can almost always tell or have a really good idea when someone is gona try to save the hooked person and resume gen, or do the opposite.
---
The length of that post put me in the dream state.
---
shit can they really hear that shit where freddy rubs his fingers together?
---
I mean it's known that a Community Manager is responsible for the optimization of a game. Imagine if they even dare to try and get something out from the lack of communication within a development team!
---
I think there’s four of us, perfect for a SWF team. 
---
legion wanting me downed and i say "no" and I dont
---
That is awesome, so cool!
---
I don't see an issue with DS or Noed tbh, they are tools to be used. 
---
can survivors hear the wind sound that plays when holding m2?
---
I feel this so much.  Freddy is stronger than a decent portion of the killer cast yet I hear the idea that he's getting reworked and that the devs are listening to the majority and I can't help but fear he'll end up being a boring chase killer, which may end up being an inadvertent nerf because, well Clown and Legion are both really bad, yet they are, according to the devs themselves, "chase killers." 
---
If they truly go through with completely changing him, he'd best be Nurse tier, that's the only way I can accept a complete rework of a fun and decent killer.
---
How is that your favourite map.
---
I agree with you on that but only because I've played this game for so long. I didnt used to think like that and can understand why people feel differently.
---
Only 300?  I’ve had a couple of killers that breached the 1000 mark lol
---
Yeah, the music and overall editing was inspired by otz, the thumbnail inspired by demi, and the toxicness inspired by ochido. You hit the nail right on the head there.
---
When you do well as killer is feels great, but if you are playing against survivors who are proficient in running around a pallet it can really suck.
---
I play how I want as both survivor and killer. I don't play to please the competition. You can bet they're playing the way and style that gives them the best chance at winning. Win or lose, someone will have something to say. I get what your saying though. People can be very mean. I guess that stuff never really bothered me much. I've always been thick skinned. Dont give up being a killer man. Hang in there. You'll get it all figured out and maybe next time, you'll get some payback on players like that. Happy Gaming!!
---
If Freddy is mid-tier, but theres no killer below him on the imaginative tier list, hes still bottom tier
---
Sadly this might be abused. People could burn bloody party streamers then DC to keep it while letting everyone else in the game (their friends) get double BP
---
if you still have any they're faded looking on the last page of inventory and it says something about being unable to use anymore if highlighted, like the event specific items.
---
What else are you supposed to do, run straight and just wait for them to catch up? I never understood why killers get pissed at that.
---
Right click on DBD in Steam and set the launch option (without the “) as “-resx=1024 -resy=768” 
---
The numbers can be changed to your preference.
---
This will only affect the game in graphics (e.g. maps and character models) not the game UI. So if you need to change the UI resolution as well, you will need to force change the resolution in the windows settings.
---
Actual good survivor that wasnt toxic. Kind of like noob3 tbh
---
They are tools to be used, and if everybody viewed this game competitively and enjoyed a challenge then players may even enjoy when these perks are used against them, or enjoy being tunneled/facecamped(since the other players will likely survive, you are being a valuable asset to the team). However, not everyone plays the game to be as optimal as possible and is not looking to go against coordinated 4 stack SWFs or killers who use unfun tactics in order to get more kills.  Most people are far more casual, and are not looking to have the match be as challenging as possible, they just want to goof around and have fun while getting bloodpoints. Sometimes people forget that the other players are real humans who are usually just trying to have fun also, and losing to getting hit by too many DStrikes/dstriked at a very critical time or getting NOED camped at the end of the game is very unfun. 
---
Cuz it's the best map and to should learn to love it before you forget what the color green is.
---
lol I think he was just broken. got in another game with legion and was reminded of the sad truth :( 
---
I completely agree, like I said I don't mind losing as killer, I've been in long cues waiting for a killer. I just think that there are better ways to dominate as survivors that don't discourage new killers from continuing to play killer is all. Obviously it's more complicated than I'm making it but i believe there is a good balance we can all find, and it will ultimately grow dbd as a whole.
---
Since the game has changed since Trapper, his traps should change.
---
Starts with 5, he does not have to go back to pick them up, if they get sabotaged  they disappear  and go back into his stack,  if he lays another trap when he is at 5 placed down the oldest one disappears, if the trap is trigged  it disappears  and goes back into his max total, like the hag.
---
Oh no
---
I only had one game in recent memory that someone had terrible ping. I killed them first because it was easy. I don't think they could see me running up to them.
---
This idea of leaving lobbies just to cherry pick a match is wild to me! I just don't get it. I understand the concept, but what does it matter? A trial shouldn't be that long. How long am I going to spend leaving and creating lobbies until I get a good one? And then I play for a whole ten minutes or something? I'm not about to put any more effort into creating a lobby.
---
Do you understand that cleansing totems with TOTH takes a lot of time.It's not about the insta down in the first place. It's that they'll die no matter what. If they cleanse the totems they'll waste 75.6 seconds minimum. So cleanisng all the totems takes almost a gen and that's not counting ruin or the fact that you'll actually have to find them. Smh
---
I meant it as in the game doesn’t start (ie the killer DCs or all 4 survivors DC before the match). Maybe this will be possible with dedicated servers. Obviously if just one person DCs then they lose their offerings. Or just make it so only the person who DCs loses their offering?
---
I’m taking a break for now. I’ll be back surely, but damn this is hurting me too. 
---
Only being able to carry one trap at a time without add-ons really neuters his gameplay. Base should definitely be two. Give trappy boi a belt loop or some shit I mean jesus
---
I thought it's an old curse summoning Insidious Bubba 😞
---
The fact that it takes hell of a lot of time. 
---
Did you eat the mess you made?
---
Was playing Trapper on Mother's Dwelling, game got down to 2 gens, all 4 were close by. 1 was the balcony gen and I blocked it with a trap, used the remaining 6 (seriously, only 7 traps spawn on that huge map? What. The. Fuck.) to lock down 2 of the others. Then I started patrolling the map, even going out pretty far to look for hatch in case someone found a key, and check the basement lockers, etc. But they just crouched around doing nothing until one *kinda* gave up. 
---
She sabo'd a hook to make a dead zone and let me down her. But I had no where to take her, even with Agitation, and she'd break free and run back. Rinse and repeat long enough the sabo'd hook respawned and I could slap her on that. Other Survivor still hadn't done shit, didn't even try a rescue even though I ran opposite side of the hook because I'd found the hatch and wasn't in the mood to let them have it after all that BS.
---
I agree that if the game never starts you should get your offering back. Sadly coding that might be a nightmare and loopholes could definitely be found
---
They didn't even bother putting a billy in the corner
---
Very true and honest answer, I'll keep playing both sides because I enjoy it! GGs friend!
---
True, but like I said maybe when we get dedicated servers it will be easier to detect if someone made it past the offering screen and act accordingly. We will just have to wait and see.
---
LMAO JUST GET 800 UPVOTES BY MAKING A FACEBOOK MEME: EZ PZ
---
No mess this time. Almost.. too close for comfort
---
Kill
---
Well thank you, u/Vaeldras for your compliment
---
It happens on PC too, but I think it's even more common on PS4 because it's basically no man's land as far as bans go. On console there is no repercussion for anything, aside from reporting vulgar post game messages to Sony.
---
Hence the "+" there, lol. I've had Survivors pushing 1k, also. Had a lobby this afternoon with three green 80-95 Survivors and one bouncing between 700-950. The red ping *still* readied up, so dodged. I'm not dealing with that kind of BS on top of console FPS.
---
I had one where it was only two of us vs. a Freddy and I spawned already in the dream world, that didn't last long
---
&lt;insert eyeroll here&gt;
---
Nah they're just mad they lost. Never hand anybody a free escape. Make them earn it
---
Yeah basically everyone is viable at rank 1 and you just need to be good. There's literally not one killer that can be bullied anymore tbh unless you're bad. The amount of pallets that were gutted from the maps and the loops that got super short makes it incredibly easy to win with any killer especially if you use perks like Ruin and Noed. The 2017/early 2018 days were the pain in the ass for killers 
---
This build is the epitome of either neon hair Neas or the most immersed Claudettes on earth
---
Freddy noed obsession increase to exit gates and warden. Bam hes viable
---
 &gt;They want 4 separate 1v1 chases where nobody communicates and helps each other. 
---
You mean they want to play the actual game they're playing? Who would have guessed!
---
Duuuuudeee, but the 15% gate opening speed is soooo op. They should really nerf that perk. 
---
Quentin would probably die by falling off a ledge. As a Quentin main, can confirm
---
Ah. I play on PC, so I guess laggy survivors aren't as bad. I don't look who's loading into the lobby to change my build either though. I'm too lazy. If I lose, I lose.
---
I had a funniest game where a Feng Min was sabotaging ALL the hooks. I was dying laughing. She was on another level. She had transcended and learned the truth. Forget gens. Sabo them hooks!
---
I want to make the last hit a gif. So great 
---
I have no clue why you're being downvoted. You're damn right, skill caps are a thing.
---
No, she's OP. She can ignore pallets, windows, has great map pressure, and she has a very high skill cap, which means if somebody get very good at her, it's pretty much a guaranteed 4k at that point. Nurse is op. 
---
😂
---
Yes, I choose not to play against bad ping. Like an intelligent person.
---
Please tell my that she didn't use 4 blinks. 
---
Eh that really wouldnt slow the game down, just allow you to escape faster but I do like the idea of including the exit gate. 
---
Yes! Sometimes dbd can be magical.
---
Nea Legendary Thiccness, good work :)
---
I wish (which just means I need to start learning her) that I could play Nurse as most of the time I stress my ass off playing killer and it keeps me away from the game for a short time. Nice to know Nurse is powerful enough where you can mostly slack off and still win especially with a mori
---
Even Billy is like "dafuq is this shit!?"
---
I’m not saying that you have to do this, but maybe utilize the search function next time? That would just help keep similar posts from popping up. 
---
Kind of like how there’s a post every two or three days about what the beam of light in the sky is. If they searched, they wouldn’t have to ask. 
---
So he couldn’t of left years ago lol
---
Yeah it should've been handled better. If they were just transparent and said that optimization is fucking hard and might take longer than they want, everyone would understand. People would still be upset, but they'd understand. What we got felt like  being kicked in the dick then spat on
---
Leave bubbu alone hes a sweet child who wants nothing but to please the ones he loves
---
New killer, hagrid. Hits survivors with his massive girth
---
Caught at exit gate. That's because you didn't immediately leave when you got the chance to leave. You can blame no one for that.
---
Uninstall.
---
I would, but I’m too attached to the game. I still have hope but I don’t want to go through the hassle of uninstalling and installing just because I had a bad time (pun intended). 
---
Alright yeah you’re right. Thanks for the advice I guess.
---
No not really. 
---
I usually crouch down and nod my head up and down, then wait just by the exit border to give them one extra hit. If you wave towards you (the come here gesture) they usually understand you're giving them the punch. 
---
I find it's an efficient thank you because it gives them more bloodpoints
---
What is Sadbaging?
---
Why?
---
-Use Shadowborn, it helps you see better mid-blink
---
-Blink as much as possible
---
-Dont use Ruin, NOED or 3+ blinks, you learn faster by actively pushing yourself without these and any decent Nurse has 0 use for them.
---
-there are 3 add-on sets I would recommend:
---
-White Nit Comb + Match Box, super cheap, don't change much, just a very minor boost.
---
-Omegablink (Horse/Ataxic + Pinecone): the undebatable strongest combo in the game
---
-Bracelet + Pinecone, fly as fast as omega but charge at about the same speed as base, and you get more range, super comfy, pretty decent.
---
My personal build is BBQ, NC, Shadowborn and Knockout/Whispers, but there are lots of good perks for her.
---
Then don't let people get to you.
---
Dead by daylight new map revealed: Florida
---
Please don't give the devs anymore excuses to not accomplish tasks.  Will be hard? Yes. Is it one of those things worth doing? Yes. If they have the right people doing the right thing, it can be done. 
---
Slug?
---
thats how dwight works
---
Imagine unironically posting this
---
Sure, maybe going around the hook isn’t a big problem. But face camping? That’s just outright childish. I can understand walking around the hook, staying a close proximity, but I’ll never understand face camping. However, if a survivor is extremely toxic, teabagging and flashlight clicking etc, I can see why a killer would face camp. That’s childish on the survivors end. 
---
You do need to learn her though as it's a lot of muscle memory. I think I have 700-800 hours on her which is why I'm able to play her pretty well.
---
makes sense.
---
With those garbo add-ons it ain't
---
How is freddy stronger than any other killer? Do explain. He needs the rework because he is quite literally the worst killer in the game atm. 
---
Also an average killer is not really bad, they are just average. Unless you classify everything under nurse as bad. Legion is broken and clown is decent, both are considerably better than freddy. 
---
Also reworking a killer to make them extremely op is honestly the worst idea anyone could come up with. 
---
My friend Donald Exits said they're not real
---
This should be a new meme on its own, so "pretty good job so far" would have competition
---
Nurses are third most popular killers at ranks 1-5 at the moment. Hillbilly is more popular with better kill rate.
---
I understand Hillbilly not needing NOED, but Nurses can absolutely need the help of it. 22% of Nurses at ranks 1-5 use NOED.
---
I came across a michael with haunted grounds a couple weeks ago... hungh.... 
---
Where can one learn about the "Skillcheck Freddy"?
---
Is that the one with "Overcharge" perk?
---
Theres nothing wrong with camping. Its just not optimal, time wise, against survivors that will let you camp. 
---
Legion needs a rework much worse than freddy. Freddy needs it definitely, but his biggest sin is just being ineffective and unfun for both sides. The legion fundamentally breaks the game's mechanics.
---
It would really benefit 110% killers and maybe balance out Billy a little bit, but other than that I think it would be kinda pointless
---
Definitely pig if they dont tunnel the trapped survivors
---
Has a nea flair. Hmm...
---
I'm taking a break until the patch as well, just can't deal with the killer experience being as bad as it is right now, especially in red ranks
---
Not for me I get a guaranteed kill and guaranteed salt :)
---
The Level 100 Über medkit:
---
Revives dead survivors
---
If used on self by a healthy survivor, summons an extra rank 1 survivor into the match
---
Well I’m rank 1 on killer and survivor
---
I can't believe you found a photo of me.
---
Yup. Constant DC's because people are babies
---
To put things bluntly: He has the absolute best stalling in the game, is one one of the best trackers in the game, and has good mindgame potential in chases.  Those at a bare minimum put him mid-tier in the right hands.  I'll admit that his skill curve is a bit harsher than other killers since he plays completely differently from others, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
---
I don't classify anyone under Nurse as bad, indeed I do believe that the only really bad killers in the game are Trapper, Bubba and Clown IMO.  Maybe Legion falls under that category, but I hate them too much to place them.
---
That's how I feel about Freddy to be honest.  If they make Freddy a generic chasing killer like half the cast, that's basically going to be spitting in the faces of people that have taken the time to learn how to play Freddy.  If BHVR is going to spit in the face of Freddy mains, then the least we can hope for is for the whole fiasco to be worthwhile, and while I can settle for keeping him under Nurse, frankly anything less than Billy tier means that the rework might as well have never happened.
---
Yep!  Overcharge is typically the core with other perks like Unnerving or Huntress' Lullaby to supplement it.
---
&gt; OP didn't run ruin
---
WHAT
---
Used to hate the coldwind farm, but now its not so bad. At least for survivor, I still hate it when I play killer
---
But, Billy can insta - down. Also, there's a mori so it won't even get to noed. I don't really know what you're saying with the post. Also, that first bit when you said, "Do you understand that cleansing totems with TOTH takes a lot of time[?]" I thought was overly condescending and really just takes away from your argument as a whole. Like, if I'm talking about these perks, I certainly understand that TOTH takes more time than usual. 
---
Also, it doesn't seem that YOU are the on that understands how long Thrill takes. It's not 75.6 minimum, it's actually anywhere between 74.2 seconds and 82.6 seconds. So, the minimum would actually be 74.2, and that's not counting Leader. Moreover, you only need to cleanse 3 dull totems to get rid of noed, which wouldn't give the killer a notification and would take 58.08 seconds without Leader. So, much less time to get rid of noed.
---
Also, how often do killers even have Thrill and Noed? Not many have Thrill, and of those that have thrill even fewer bring in noed with it. 
---
Like, we all agree with you that Noed is op, but you still want to argue this specific thing about how Thrill is somehow integral in making it even more powerful. We get what you were trying to say, and it didn't work out too well. It's okay man.
---

Is it random which box gets the trap off?  I had to go to three once, but lost my head
---
So, while I am a survivor main (rank one), I have been playing killer quite a bit lately. I am rank twelve and I do not face camp nor do I tunnel. I also only run 1 perk on all of my killers, I haven’t even bothered to level any of them up. I still manage to get 3/4 kills every match, without camping or tunneling or using any type of “Exposed” perks. All these killers complain about survivors and their perks and their flashlights and whatnot, though I manage to get kills just fine without any sort of help. I complain about face camping because, at least for me, getting kills is easy enough without camping, tunneling, running NOED, BBQ&amp;Chili, whatever else. It is stupidly easy to just down and hook someone, therefore camping seems silly to me. It shows a lack of skill on the killer’s behalf, when playing a killer is easy enough without doing anything cheap like that. 
---
I don't think it helps your point regardless of what you're arguing to tell other people that they're "gonna cry...and get all butthurt" about what you're going to say before even listening to them.
---
Camping is really unfun for the survivor who gets unlucky enough to get in your lobby. That's it. That's literally it. So, if you don't care about people having fun, go ahead camp. Easy.
---
It would make the 110% killers op. They're 110% for a reason. Killers are also 115% because if they weren't, they would take much longer to get a surv in a chase. 
---
Best stalling in the game? Pig does better stalling than freddy on average. Also incredibly easy to get out of his power, so no it doesn't stall much. If anything freddy stalls himself because he has to pull survivors into dream world to be able to do anything. Best tracker? Only really helps if you were juked in chase, otherwise doesn't really do much since it's incredibly easy to get out of his power. He does not have any more mindgame potential in chase than a normal m1 killer? So that point is completely invalid to start with.
---
It has nothing to do with skill curve. Billy has quite a low skill curve yet he is one of the best killers. Having a difficult to play killer does not mean that they are good. So no it does not put him mid tier, he is still the lowest of all killers. 
---
Freddy needs a rework. His power is basically just the ability to interact survivors. His concept with the dream world is decent, but the way that it was implemented was terrible. Just because you can do well as him does not make him good. 
---
Also freddy should not be put into billy tier either, why does he have to be op to make the rework good? Why can't he just be average, instead of bad? There's no point buffing him to that extent with a rework, he just needs to be decent, not op. 
---
That looked like the place where you fight Soul of Cinder
---
lmao
---
Maybe overall as a player but personally I enjoy watching noob3 more.  
---
No One Escapes Death, a perk that, after doing every gen, lets killers down survivors in one swing instead of two and also gives them a % speed boost.
---
I didn't even know they was a thing that could be done.  That's so dumb.  
---
just buy another copy of the game ツ
---
That really sucks. 
---
Then what are killers supposed to do? Get obliterated by SWFs so mediocre solo survivors can have things their way? You are flipping things on the head. All you want is comfort for yourself (survivor) and don’t care about balancing things equally. You are clearly not the one to listen to. Good luck in your hard survivor endeavors. 
---
I know, it's absolutely amazing. OP went beast mode at the last minute it looks like.
---
Sure
---
It definitely should
---
I’ve been trying to learn without ruin/NOED because I agree, I want to push myself. I’m honestly just trying to get the blinks down, so I’m not overly worried about killing people. If I’m not doing so hot but I’ve landed a couple of downs, I’ll usually just let everyone go if they’re close. I have been getting gen rushed to all hell, but better map pressure will come with time. Thanks for the add on combos! 
---
Dc is usual on both side, saw many killers dc at the start of the map or leaving the lobby by cherrypicking survivors. Many factors can be make someone dc also such a increased lag in the game.
---
I think their player base would rather them take more time to make a good new killer than to just release one not finished because deadline is due. I like legion but it seems the majority do not so he prob needs fixed. I just dont see the point in making your community play something they think is unfun because you want money for the dlcs. Eventually people will get the shits of it and not play.
---
DS counters you mentioned never actually counter the perk. It is still active. You are not rendering it unusable later by slugging or juggling, etc. And, as it was said above, it is insanely situational. 3 out of 4 times there is no hook nearby to juggle, and slugging is insanely stupid - you don’t hook, hence you don’t progress in killing. To slug DS means to slug everyone in one run or it doesn’t matter. Dropping right on skilkcheck is just a 1/1000 lucky strike, it can’t be done with any kind of consistency. 
---
I get it sucks id someone is hardcore outplaying you but in this situation you can't blame them. 
---
IIRC the devs said ‘we’re on it’ in the latest stream
---
Lullaby - No. Survivors know of it's existence the moment they get their first skillcheck, meaning it'll get cleansed before it does anything of use.
---
TotH - No. Huntress is too slow to reliably react to the notifications. Generally a waste of a slot.
---
Whispers - Because of Huntress' 45m humming radius, Survivors will know you are coming long before Whispers procs.
---
BBQ - With lockers, Distortion, etc. BBQ is far too easily countered these days. Plus, Huntress is too slow to capitalise on it when you *do* see an aura.
---
I'd recommend:
---
Ruin - No explanation needed.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel - The best gen-defence perk in the game, as you can knock 25 charges off of a gen in an instant.
---
Surveillance (ONCE THE NEW PATCH GOES LIVE) - Synergises well with PGtW, may well end up the best tracking perk in the game.
---
Iron Maiden - Lets you reload hatchets really near-instantly, meaning you lose less time and can maintain more pressure on Survivors.
---
Something like that happens to me too. I have equipped my Doctor with the project uniform, the sparky stick and the frosty eyes and when i restart the game, he has the normal eyes. 
---
I think it’s survivors who no longer feel emotion, so can’t feed the Entity any more
---
At the same time since they released a roadmap with a specific schedule the playerbase would lose their shit and call the devs liars if they didn't keep to their schedule.
---
Just look at the December optimization patch debacle as an example people lost their shit because it didn't happen in time. If Legion didn't release because he wasn't fun they'd get shit on for being late.
---
Have it to where if a survivor crouches too many times in quick succession they die immediately and system 32 gets deleted from their iPhone 5
---
They need to put in something against overly immersed and unhelpful survivors.  If generators haven't been worked on and a chase hasn't happened in the past few minutes then the game should give the "AFK crows" over them or something.  
---
LF, maybe. But Clown? Why? He actually has a power that does something
---

And I don't understand why he ddos you. You didn't have noed and when I see the score you didn't tunnel. I'm a survivor main and I can say this guy is really a bag of crap. And he can ddos you because the killer is the host of the game. So he can have your ip easily. Devs said that dedicated serv will come in summer... Finally I wanna say
---
Again insults when out of arguments... let me guess soon you'l come up with what in your mind is a amazing comeback / insult then leave and never come back like you did in discord. Typical coward tactic, I expect nothing less from someone that did nothing but talk negatively with no arguments what so ever.
---
The 2 killers I hate going against the most, well aside from doctor. Yes I know how to counter them. They are just annoying.
---
So I can't play killer any more because my connection is threatened by salty survivors? Great...
---
Saw that you’re a surv main instantly knew you had no credibility
---
I killed 3 of them, nah i had bloodhound, deerstalker, predator and the fov perk. They were swf. I should have brought a mori
---
1. Once a gen is done, it's done. The Killer can't break a repaired gen. But 2 half-repaired gens can have their progressed regressed, albeit slowly.
---
2. Interrupting two people on a gen only keeps one of them off of gens for a brief moment. After this, they are back up to 75% strength, but with one gen closer to completion than it would otherwise be.
---
3. You seem to be under the impression the other person on a 2-person gen, who is *not* being chased, is somehow prevented from judt going back to the same gen.
---
4. If ganging up on gens is so inefficient, why do all high-rank Survivors (especially in SWF) do it? Run Discordance and you'll be shocked how many times it'll proc.
---
5. Here's an example of the effects of ganging up on gens (start at 3:50): https://youtu.be/VMF_xB6GPZw
---
In this match, i was trying to record me getting stunned as freddy for a friend since he dosent have him, this was the result : https://youtu.be/l7dPugRpGas
---
I mean you could use a vpn but that seems like a rare occurrence to begin with and you shouldn't have to
---
The one on the right.
---
Pretty much everything in this game is "toxic" the words overused as fuck at this point installing the game is "toxic"
---
Sorry for the poor quality of the video, but he's on the other side of the hook just bouncing from left to right taunting me. So I stood back and was actually trying to get him with my hatchet. It almost felt like he was using the other survivor as a human shield to stop himself from being hit. 
---
Later in the game he pointed to a locker where another survivor was. I knocked them both down, hooked him based on principle, and carried the survivor he was ratting out to the hatch.
---
Same here but with frosty eyes on clown and spirit every time I come back the next day it’s defaulted again.

You're missing the point of u/TheDankDwight 's post.
---
The point is that killers here on Reddit always have the argument of "just cleanse totems" ready when someone brings up how annoying / stupid / whatever NOED is. (Similar to how everyone always says "just dribble" for DS.)
---
The point of the post is that, in its core concept yes, it is a case of "just cleanse the totems", but it's not that simple, because totems take time.
---
u/TheDankDwight 's post is making a joke on that fact, that the time survivors spend on cleansing those totems can be enough time for them to get killed, hence the mori and TOTH in there.
---
His point was never to argue if TOTH made NOED better or not.
---
DS: there are perks better than enduring and even if you have enduring, they pretty much still have a free out of jail card.
---
NOED: you need to go out of your way to stop something that MIGHT spawn.
---
Both perks require the other side to get out of their way just to prevent the perks from being free out of jail cards.
---
Here is also how I feel the perks should be adjusted:
---
Decisive Strike: make it and exhaustion perk. Can't use it when exhausted and can't use an exhaustion perk after you escaped (except for Adrennaline)
---
NOED: No longer a Hex perk, No longer gives the exposed effect, Increase killer movement speed by 7% once all exit gates are opened (also change hope so that there is no limit to it)
---
No, it's just a preference, was a former pro player on fortnite and always play with this res on Cs/Dbd/Fortnite!
---
Atleast you werent fucked alot by swf forcing you to depip because you played solo....
---
You don’t pip from being a coward and doing nothing.
---
The devs are gonna get ahit on despite what they do it seems. I think the reason is because whatever they do isnt good. I was just basing that comment off of the feedback I've been seeing about legion. Could be completely wrong. 
---
I’m glad the bun was a good choice 
---
When you look at the player history, survivors see all survivors and killers, killers cannot see survivors.
---
Could of used a map offering though :/ also that map is great on billy
---
I really like 2nd and 3rd ideas. 
---
Any pallet you see even when not in a chase, you must throw down.
---
Until you drop mustard all down the front. Cool tho
---
Easy there Satan 
---
Ok, then you must attempt escape whenever you can.
---
Poor Freddy aways getting cucked by everyone 
---
I like both to be honest I just don’t think my fellow survivors will 
---
Good point
---
Be me
---
Try to get evil incarnate

I know my black ass be getting farmed. They water me and everything. LOL

Report this to your isp. A DDoS attack is a crime in many countries and can result in their ISP disconnecting them.
---
I don't get it.
---
Freddy is bad it ain’t a meme so you see people taking about how bad he is and go oh that’s a meme he’s soooo bad it’s really sad and his power is so boring its basically just add 7 seconds to every chase and boom that’s his power he can’t even warp reality in the dream state like in the movies so what’s the point 
---
Yup
---
And I'm over here just finishing a game with 36% and not even a bronze in gatekeeper  
---
More like annoying to look at
---
I thought about something else they could do. Sort of bring back Legacy. However, make it a huge fucking grind. Like you get X of a certain currency. And every day you are at Rank 1 and atleast played 1 game on that day you get a few points in that curreny. And every 1-3 months depending on it you stay at rank 1 you can buy 1 legacy piece.
---
FrEdDy Is StrOnGer tHeN the a Decent pOrtion Of ThE kILleR cAsT like who name more then 1 who’s possibly worse then the killer that all survivors start off with god against and has no chase abilities 
---
LOL, I am dumb. Was too focused on the left one.
---
another question : why he didn't drop the pallet? He had a good oportunity to stun him and he was also injured so why did he took the chance of not dropping it?
---
And for that lunge? Latency. Believe me. Had a kyf with some buddies, 300 ping allowed a hag lunge through pallets and walls.
---
If someone unhooks in your face there is 0 reason to not throw a hatchet at the hook. If they call you a camper ignore it and move to the next lobby.
---
Unless the Killer has Discordance, they have no way of telling multiple people are on a gen at the start of a match.
---
You are statistically less likely to be interrputed in 44 seconds than you are in 80 seconds. Thus, you are more likely to get the gen done before the Killer finds you.
---
If the Killer doesn't have Ruin, and they don't patrol straight to your gen, you can get a gen done before the Killer downs anyone.
---
Plus, the more Survivors spread out, the more likely they are to be found. If the Killer lingers by a gen, you can just move on to the next one.
---
You'd be surprised at what being good at one roles help you do in the other, maybe you should try playing survivor
---
It certainly measured skill in a decent way.
---
My black ass be happy af when the 13th comes around. Call me Old McDonald because I’m farming those chests like E-I-E-I-O.

I hate this whole "d1D yOu kN0w w3 oNlY uSE x% Of Our bRAin. I r3Ad iT On faCEb00k tHe 0ther dy" Like bitch do some research and don't listen to all the bullshit you hear on buzzfeed/facebook
---
I'd think you should just follow the flow. don't be an ass and liability to your team that much on purpose. just have fun and try helping. I mean it's fine to drop a drunk pallet here and there when it's not necessary in chase but just with no reason? nah, that's scammy. I've played drunk, it's already fun. maybe get a friend who's also drunk or just a fun person?
---
What if they have unbreakable or no mither buff suggestions every survivor gets instantly hooked and cannot escape hook even if they attempt escape 
---
No, she really doesn't. If you can counter a nurse, they suck at the game. 
---
Hillbillies chainsaw should kill on hit by just cutting whoever it hits by cutting them in half 
---
Now we’re talking
---
On pc hit shift tab view players box (middle left box) then recent games just weed out the survivor names and boom you have the killer
---
Yep, it’s a trade-off
---
It's not about me not wanting to cleanse when I see a totem. It's about not knowing as a random how much my team did and having to find all the locations just to make sure.
---
NOED + YesED = everyone just gets stuck in the game 
---
It didn't work on my hamster, i demand a refund 
---
That would be the point. Besides DS, basically all the free second chance perks (Dead Hard, Adrenaline, to a lesser degree Sprint Burst) are exhaustion based.
---
It would put more of a limit on how many extra chances get crammed into a single chase. Rather than adding +1 hit to a chase with dead hard or adrenaline, or potentially both, and then still getting to add +1 hit with DS, you'd have actually choose which to use.
---
You're right... 
---
Thanks for the response, and no you were not rude.
---
A lot of people don't use We'll Make It at high ranks because it doesn't benefit them personally. In fact, not a lot of people run Borrowed Time anymore, which was once meta, since it no longer protects the user. 
---
People in this game play selfishly since that's the best way to win. I wanted Vigil to be a team perk, which makes perfect sense given the perk name and Quentin's lore. If vigil isn't your playstyle, then fine - but I bet you would love ito if someone else ran it and removed your exhaustion, mangled and hemorrhage all in one go.
---
yeah killers with average pc's who dont put it on LOW... same thing, someone uses Dead hard... game lags you teleport. They're not lag switching, but the potato isn't working too well like console players see a lot.
---
I do adore playing Freddy and you can see how potent he can get when you use the Photo addon, without it though he can be somewhat of a chore to get the best out of on bigger maps since you have to rely on rng to not have someone wake up quickly and finding other survivors is not always too easy of a task.
---
Why 2 exhaustion perks when you could use self care and be more toxic? :o
---
Yes. My 4th perk is usually WGLF because I dedicate my other three perks to literally trying to help my cabbage brain teammates in solo play. I can’t even pretend like my allies are goal oriented because when you see how they act it’s like.....yikes. 
---
karma roulette is tough
---
I have no idea about game development in general but if they were to buff it in the wrong way then he would be really OP. 
---
It's all about finding the balance and keep it.
---
They did try out a few buffs on the PTB but to my knowledge they did not work properly. (They said it on the stream the other day)
---
Don’t listen to this guy it ain’t camping 
---
No it not camping 
---
Yes, I just started less than 2 weeks ago playing this game. Got to rank 14, reset me back to 17. But all good.. ;)
---
110 is fine.

---
I enjoy playing him because i know he is frustrating to play against but only after playing to many survivor games that tilt me
---
This mantra keeps popping up around noed "it rewards bad play." It doesn't. It helps when a player has done poorly, but no more than if a player has done well and the other team has as well. End game is a part of the game and bringing a perk that has an effect then isn't "rewarding bad play" it's just a power spike close to the end. Not every game is a 4k before all the gens are done, that doesn't mean they've played badly.
---
It gets blown out of proportion because if one person dies in the end game, suddenly it's 'they didn't deserve a single kill, it's not our fault for ignoring an aspect of the game and not touching totems' or everyone suicides to save them and that's the killers fault for bringing noed.
---

---
He follows some scratches, loses the guy he was looking for, gives up on looking for him and just lines up a shot and camp the hook waiting for the unhook. 
---
Also after every skill check, if you miss it take two shots, if you hit it take one. 
---
I think it's gonna be February 5nd. 
---
So long as you're constantly moving it shouldn't be a problem. 
---
Yeah but wouldn't self care benefit more even though i refuse to run it myself :s
---
I understood the point of his post. It's his reply to my comment where he was talking about thrill time and all that shit. His post never made those points, but his reply certainly did. I even agree with his meme post. Just really didn't appreciate that condescension from his reply.
---
It would slow the game down. Just. A. Little. Bit.
---
Purple medkits essentially just have more charges and heal a little faster. Pair it up with the syringes add-ins allow for insta-heals. This load out is just a troll load out for a couple of reasons. First, the perk no mither means that you will always be in an injured status so there is no point in bringing a medkit. Second the perk self care is completely useless because of no mither. Third, the syringe addons work best with brown or yellow medkits as they reduce the amount of charges a medkit has, and heals a survivor instantly instead of using the medkit so there is no point in bringing a super rare medkit in that circumstance. Finally, the perk object of obsession means that you and the killer can see each other and since you are always injured, it just increases the likelihood of you getting downed. Pair that up with self care and medkits which cannot be used because of no mither makes this the absolute worst build you can ever play.
---
Oh and the Game Map is awful for survivors who have no generator awareness :)
---
Lmao there's already a post for this, I assume you just want to farm karma off of it smh
---
I mean, you can't really blame the Survivors here. This would be a Developer issue.
---
Why? Because there's an awkward Survivor dilemma when 2 people are left alive and there are 2-4 generators remaining. If one Survivor works on a generator, they are likely to be found, and then:
---
A) Hooked. In which case, the *other* Survivor has a chance for the Hatch.  
---
B) Slugged. In which case, the other Survivor is likely to be found and killed before the slugged player dies (and this also wastes the time of the Slugged player until they slowly die. That, or the Slugged player is healed and the 2-man scenario repeats itself).
---
Basically, when it comes down to 2 players and more than one generator remaining, neither player believes they will escape the map together. It's too difficult, at that point. If they are at 4 gens, one of them has to complete a generator to enable a Hatch victory, but the person that completes the generator is likely to be the one who is sacrificed. At 2 or 3 generators, the likelihood of the Survivors starting a generator and actually getting to finish it before the Killer appears is extremely low, so they die, and the other one goes for the Hatch.
---
To have AFK crows appear just damages the Survivor experience. So now they don't even get the option of the dilemma, it's just: works on gens anyway, and whoever the Killer finds first is screwed. 
---
I'm not sure the best way to solve this dilemma, though. It just seems needlessly shitty for the remaining survivors to hope that the *other* Survivor gets caught and dies so that you can take the Hatch. 
---
Achievement hunting I would assume, I helped someone with that one a while back. 
---
thanks ;)

---
I STOPPED PLAYING THE GAME. 
---
That screams tryhard on your part. They also probably gave up because 3v1 is not fair in the slightest unless the killer is exceedingly bad. 
---
Or you could use it straight away, insta down lots of people and save a lot of time.
---
try this

Advertising is against Reddit's code of conduct I believe
---
More whining killer mains.
---
(LETS GO BOYS I WANT SOME DOWNVOTES)
---
Yikes I feel for ya. Whenever I play killer I tend to go easy on them if it's a 3 man game and any lower I just let them do the gens and get out. Its just 1 match, why should I try so hard when it's practically an instant win handed to me on a silver platter?
---
or use a dynamic IP and change the mask after somebody wrote sth like this
---
Best you got is enduring to re-engage chase
---
Having the addons on the medkit reduce its charges.
---
40 seconds in 8m range of another surv for a single token to _temporary_ disable an effect.
---
Hatch entitled survivor main says what?
---
These are my made up rules survivor main says what?
---
I am not allowed to die survivor main says what?
---
I'm not saying it's a good idea for them to implement it but when you are on lerys and all 3 gens are in one corner and the last two survivors are on the opposite side of the map with urban evasion crouching away and hiding in lockers for 30+ minutes it gets a little tedious and yes I know you can just leave the game but that is one of the worst feeling you can experience in this game you worked hard for those kills only to have it ruined because people don't want to play. I had to check every goddamn locker in that map 4 times before I found 1 of them granted I had bbq and I got the last person. The hatemail was amazing seeing as how they blamed me for the 45 minute game when after 10 minutes I said fuck it and went ark for 15 minutes came back to none of the gens being worked on still and having to look for 20 minutes in each locker.
---
I CANT BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE THIS.

LEL. Rank 1 killer means nothing to me because Legion exists. Rank 2 survivor tells me you are prob boosted by your friends
---
Are we really concerned about resiliance?
---
How does this show skill? Its just an annoying nerf to something which doesnt need it.
---
You can dribble them, trap them sometimes, make them fall down the drop into basement or slug them to get another survivor off a gen so there is plenty of counters oh also unnerving presence but they still tend to hit it

That’s funny, I primarily solo-queue and run the killer around for the majority of the game, is the little ‘entitled killer main’ assuming things?

Same as sandbagging

3 man game or 1 DC?

Hah when you fail a skillcheck stop doing the fen while you drink because your just going to get another while doing it! Another few are the killer dodges lobby, you waste a pallet, the killer mindgames your and uhh you accidentally sandbag a teammate.

You say the survivors need to go out of their way to cleanse totems but we have two perks and an item that shows totem locations if you’re that concerned about it. In most cases against NOED, the survivors don’t think about it until it’s too late for them because they’ve only done gens and didn’t take that extra time. They literally run into their own demise. If the killer is that bad at chasing people and applying little to no map pressure, then inbetween doing gens just scout around. I know changing survivor builds is like pulling teeth from a wild horse but damn, if you don’t utilize the tools you have, there’s no room to complain. 
---
DS has clear checks. NOED has hard counters.

Good, if they were being difficult to catch at least your screwed them over on benevolence a bit :)

I find personally most people use Sprint Burst and usually end up with time to reach a Pallet/Window, so I’ll just chase them with the Mallet until I’ve broken most Pallets around the Generator they were at.
---
Rank 10 or higher usually wait until you rev your chainsaw to flip a pallet, so you can go for the easy mallet hit just to keep them injured for the time being 
---
I CANNOT FORGIVE YOU FOR THE SIN YOU HAVE COMMITTED. 
---
The Chungtress.
---
OOPS lol super tired my mistake! Fixed :)
---
I actually got it on my first try. There was some salt coming from the survivors though, saying they reported me. The add-on is kinda bullshit, but I just wanted the trophy 
---
Here’s what some killers do:  after a few minutes of not seeing any gameplay, they get up, make a cup of coffee, and come back.  If the survivors haven’t done anything by that point, they dc.
---
Here’s what you should do:  record it and submit the recording in a ticket on the official DBD web site.
---
The perk that reduces stuns doesn’t counter a stun? Odd. 
---
But he starts with BBQ and when I was leveling him, I got tier 3 by level 12 and the grind sped up significantly
---
The game is amazing for Doc as well.
---
Idk why even complaining about this. Every single killer perk is and will be minimum 2x stronger than any survivor perk. Typical example: Boil over vs Iron Grasp (+ reduced wiggle speed) and WGLF vs BBQ (+ giving vision). Decisive is one time thing, NOED lasts way longer.
---
You forget the first point I made, running that perk just to make shure that one perk the killer MIGHT have doesn't come into play is pretty stupid and you still need to go out of your way.
---
And who says the killer is bad at chasing and applying pressure, you don't know what state the game is in when the final generator gets completed, there might only be 2 survivors left both on their last hook and one of them in a chase who now suddenly has to outrun an even faster killer who can also instantly kill them. Survivors symply don't always have the luxury to go and find all the totems.
---
Same goes for killer, they don't always have the luxury to juggle or slug a survivor.
---
You still get looped if theyre near a loop, shack etc. Thats not a counter. 
---
Yeah maymay is too funny for u/saiiyu
---
Because 1 survivor with a ticking trap would have no other chance to escape since the killer could just go to the jigsaw boxes and pull them/chase them off. It's just a last resort really.
---
Funny enough I did, I just also wanted to post it here cus if there are any other new players I would like to leave a friendly post about good times with the game instead of complaining or something negative 
---
Swf takes 2 hours to coordinate....killer dodges lobby.
---
Do a KYF lobby and just mess around in controls
---
That...is the saddest thing I’ve seen all day. Like man, if someone gets salty enough to go hacker and DDoS they SHOULD NOT play any multiplayer game. Cause I’m pretty sure that that is an offense that can be reported to authorities. Like who on earth gets salty (and petty) enough to go through that amount of effort.
---
It's really helpful for us lower ranks, as in my games pallets don't last very long and when I need them, they are gone. All I am usually left is a lot of anger towards my teammates who burned through pallets in the first 3 minutes in the game. Thanks for the tutorial! I'll drop by your stream. 
---
I agree. I bought him for BBQ but after a while one-hitting survivors just became so fun
---
I've been in that situation a bunch of times and sure, it sucks, but I just call it a loss and try to gain as much BP as possible before I go down. 
---
Spending a couple minutes on repairs and then a chase is way better than literally doing nothing but hiding in corners and lockers for 20-30 minutes. Just end the game and start a new one. 
---
When I'm playing killer, I feel like I have to quickly hunt down the last guy or herd them to the hatch just to keep the game from turning into 30 minutes of hide and seek 
---
You’re bringing into account something that is situational and not related to the two perks specifically. If you believe the survivors are running DS, you can bring Enduring and counter the long stun. I wouldn’t even say full counter, but seriously check that stun. Also that’s a very specific if you bring up. We can add so many other ifs to showcase DS being a bad perk if you don’t look at the interaction between the only the two perks. 
---
Don’t get hooked first. Obviously when the killer comes back they go for the injured one, you don’t “courtesy” hit the uninjured one and let you go, lol that’s ridiculous. The point of being killer is to get kills. Maybe run faster 😂 (I’m a survivor main btw)
---
That’s amazing. Sleepy bois best bois.
---
Distressing, unnerving presence, overcharge, huntress lullaby with “calm”-carters notes and calm 2.
---
Everyone talking bout Dwight, yet nobody talking how well Roundabund and chase music goes togetheter
---
Situational where? It happens to me all time. Most of the time when you down someone, youre near a pallet or some kind of loop. The problem isnt the stun time, its the fact that they get off of you after youve already spent time chasing them. 
---
I run distortion constantly just because of bbq. Same shit. 
---
It's a shame I can only upvote this once.
---
This is a the mother of all crossovers. Can you imagine the totems made with Ornacia? I wantbit so bad now
---
These are from around 20000 survivors.
---
Even Freddy is somewhat viable since people think it's going to be easy mode and that can be punished
---
Yeah, see? Dwight is a fucktard even to their own kind.
---
Found the noed user.
---
What is this about ?
---
You are so generic
---
You want to complain about things? Let’s go. You are so grammatically impaired.
---
If you want to buff vigil then make the temporary cleanse time longer, say 30 or 40 seconds, and make the time needed to collect a token shorter, maybe 30 seconds. But Vigil should at least do something.
---
Get better at survivor. Get better at killer.
---
Thanks for your opinion! Yeah those things are definitely the two biggest detractors, though as long as I can get the SAW Chapter when I first buy it (Pig main) I'm not too concerned about getting them over a period of time, just gotta bust through the grind.
---
So Jen did it while she wasn't streaming?
---
dribbling is dumb. So is body blocking. You shouldnt have to slug to find the last guy. None of those are counters...that is called unintended game mechanics. (ie. exploiting)
---
lel Spirit/Freddy main. Taking the top and bottom like its a joke.
---
I bet you do. I don't assume; I state facts. Disprove me with hard evidence :)
---
Definitely seems that way, especially where meta is concerned. Oh Lord I'm going to have to survive God-tier nurses, aren't I? Well, that's the price you pay for a better experience overall I suppose lol.
---
I agree that this is not a BM. However as a killer I saw somewhat similar behaviour that falls into bad manners category. Maybe the killer just generalized things.
---
You stay at the gate, don't leave -&gt; you want him to come and chase you out -&gt; you want your chance to taunt the killer -&gt; you try to BM him. 
---
Something like that could've gone through his head. And I've seen my fair share of games where survivors did act like this. 
---
I don’t have to prove anything to a salty killer main who can’t see two sides of an argument due to their lack of experience or general knowledge of the game. Goodbye, little one. You have many things to learn. 
---
Killer main here.
---
Are folk really that bothered by either of these perks? I've got a couple sacrifices thanks to NOED because survivors wouldn't just leave or tried to save a friend at the end of the game. Equally I've had survivors DS off my back when the gates are open and they've escaped.
---
Perks are meant to let you do something you can't normally do. They both seem to do that.
---
RuIn Is MaNdAtOrY, no it's not and it's mid tier at best. I would recommend swapping out Thrill and Lullably tho since huntress doesn't have the greatest map pressure and hexes are a mixed bag when it comes to effectiveness. You can go for Pop Goes The Weasel to delay gens, Bamboozle for annoying loops, Iron Maiden for that little bit of a reload increase and any survivors hiding cause of BBQ will get revealed, Bitter Murmur since they aren't hiding if they just did a gen so you can see how many and where they go, or go real OP and slap on Fire Up
---
It probably helps that Panda is one of the nicest and friendliest streamers out there with little ego issues for mods to "protect".
---
No, No, Not a counter (thats for only one guy who is O), no, no (that doesnt country DS.........,enduring is not a hard counter it only allows u to stay stunned less time
---
Is it all of the time or is it most of the time because it cannot be both. Either you down someone at a pallet loop 100% of the time or you simply only choose to remember it as a negative experience and focus solely on that experience, so which is it? 
---
Also your personal experiences or at the very least the negative ones you choose to focus on doesn’t change the fact that Enduring exists as a way to counter DS’s stun. Every variable that you pull into it is not a cause for it to be changed. 
---
I prefer being impaired in grammar (because obviously it's not my native language) than an edgelord with an ego higher than Mount Everest. Flexing with rank 1, like, really? 
---
Oh dang I didn't even think about the PTB, that's a nice bonus too! I feel you on the choices too, pretty sure I prestiged Dwight twice before I decided to learn sprint burst or urban evasion or just something USEFUL (I love Bond though, just a busybody when it comes to my team) so I can definitely use that to my advantage. Thanks!
---
I get called a lagswitcher. mate it's just this shitty BT internet :I
---
I dont know its annoying as hell...and I suck at nurse because my DPI is 4000 and I refuse to lower it for one game....i dont play nurse or billy normally because they are hard to control.
---
I’m not flexing with rank 1, I am simply stating a fact. I am not your rank 17 killer main like the OP. Now, run along little one, I am done arguing with people who use similes to compare ego to a mountain. 
---
BBQ, Ruin, Deerstalker, Brutal Strength
---
Pulling the Ethernet cord out of the computer could be a counter.
---
NOED...you can destroy the totems that spawn in your asshole when the game begins and are not hidden at all....sure...really needs a rework....
---
Vigil is used to get rid of Exhaustion faster while all the other things are optional at best. Similar to how Sloppy Butcher is used to delay the game through Manged, but in some rare occasion there is some usefulness to the extra blood on the ground.  
---
Your version of Vigil requires to be next to another survivor for 40 entire seconds total to do anything at all. And even then you have to specifically get into a situation where you can be close to someone to use it. If he is mangled you will save 4 seconds with that perk by going to heal him. And only once. And only if we were close to another survivor for an eternity.  
---
On top of that your perk would outright not able to work properly in the first place. Say two people run this perk together with sprint burst. This means once they have a token and start sprinting you suddenly can run around the map for 20 seconds at 150% speed? Because Exhaustion is temporary disabled? Lets give it the benefit of the doubt and say any new effect reapplied won't be removed.  
---
Now if that is the case, the perk is shit. Since you can only ever use it to block an exposed oneshot or reset exhaust. To reset exhaust you would have to abandon whatever you are doing and meet the chase guy in his chase (where you would be better off just doing a gen in that time, even with another actual perk). What about Exposed? You have to be lucky enough that the killer is actually using something that applies Exposed, while not using anything that applies other status (else your tokens get eaten up by that), get into range of who you want to give immunity (while not going into range of someone who doesn't need it) and have one of this 40 second cuddling tokens at the ready.  
---
You need 15 and a half stars to align for that Vigil to do something good. 
---
I just did that and it took my shards off me and didn’t give me any bp 😂😂
---
Just give Vigil the effect to recover Exhaustion while moving at any speed and maybe also in chase. EZ fix.
---
LOL, I am rank 1 killer kiddo. What did you say about assuming? LEL
---
The Gen Z kid calls people little one...cute
---
Even using the same phrases for different people, so sad you can't see how pathetic you look trying to look like an intelligent cynic badboy.
---
See you at next double bloodpoints event :) 
---
Thanks, tried to picture how that would play out, I have brain cancer now. 
---
That is because you cant prove it. Salty Gen Z boy lel.
---
Give this man some upvotes! Praise be
---
Okay stop being that way lmao you know that was just an expression. MOST of the time, youre going to get looped again jfc. A counter completely negates something. If I have Enduring, the survivor is still getting off of me by hitting a skill check and i have to chase them again. All while gens are being done and time is being wasted. 
---
These are some pretty good points in favor of PS4, I must admit. Personally I'm not too bothered by high rank wait times as I usually run meme/unconventional builds and just dick around (pretty sure Plunderer's Instinct is one of my most used perks) as survivor and end up hovering in the mid ranks as killer because high rank survivors scare me lol. The 360 dukes is a really good point though, but I guess that just means I'd have to git gud.
---
I play both roles fairly evenly so it seems that PC offers a bit more for me in terms of control/performance/queue time, but I'm definitely gonna have my PS4 version installed in case any of my friends decide to hop back on.
---
I like your thoughts on just buying the base game first, as it's rather inexpensive. I'll give it a try this week and see how it goes, thanks!
---
I knew since the alpha that Deathgarden would fail miserably. Not only cause it is fucking hard to establish a shooter, but Death Garden did not provide true variety in guns and perks to make games different but also had no progression system. Part of keeping players invested and get them to stay with DbD was the inbuilt progression system. Leaving that one out in Deathgarden was an awful decision.
---
Huh, didn't think about that, whilst I mostly get my info from here that's certainly something I'll keep in mind too, thank you!
---
His honesty is appreciated. 
---
can't deny that
---
Whenever a new mmo comes out people will talk "This mmo is the WoW killer!!!" and be wrong about it. Thus the meme "This game will kill WoW" was born.  
---
And it transcended to other genres in gaming aswell. Death Garden quite a few people claimed "would be the DbD killer", but it wasn't. Completing the cycle of that meme.
---
Your average ochido fanboy with double standarts.
---
You could swap overcharge for ruin if you want.
---
Thanks for the better reply.
---
It's not that exhaustion no longer effects them, its that one current particular Exhaustion Status Effect no longer affects them. They can get afflicted with new Exhaustion Status Effect if they decide to run again.
---
If 40 seconds is too long, make it 20 seconds.
---
If 8 meter range is too small, make it 12 meters.
---
You don't need the galaxy to align, you just need a survivor to run within 12 meters of you. Not hard when they can see your aura. Let buff that too, up to 15 meters.
---
Maybe make it recover Exhaustion but not in a chase otherwise survivors will never stop sprint bursting around the map.
---
That's my Doc build, tho with BBQ instead of Lullaby since survivors always destroy the bloody totem in 20 seconds.
---
yea he prob exploits like he does to...sad how some ppl will do anything to win.
---
12m and 20sec would be better ye.
---
What?
---
Enduring or Unnerving work pretty well. Unnerving is especially fun to watch them miss it.
---
It is easy to pip with both, tbh.
---
Big Chungus is more unfunny than Ugandan Knuckles. I don't understand how anyone would think it's entertaining. The punchline is that he is fat and has a funny name. Hahahahahahahahaha so fucking funny
---
Ah. Does the first person to work on the gen get the effect or is it random?
---
We already have two suburb maps. I would want something with high rises, maybe with the first two floors available in each building 
---
Survivor used splinter and changed his killer to no perk Freddy.
---
I just tank it, but I use enduring on fuckin' everybody so I can disrespect pallets.
---
Damn i'm blind. Thanks
---
Big chungus funny because of how unfunny it is thats the joke
---
I didn't know that was possible.
---
"it's funny because of how unfunny it is". No. Being unfunny doesn't make it funny
---
Nah, he doesn't, he just has extra lunge range, and faster vaults. With those combined, it does feel like he's a bit faster than he actually is though.
---
Nurse is a waste of time to play now...almost every map I am running into shit I cant blink through...fuck that bitch
---
OoO is good if you like chases, I sometimes equip it if I feel like being a distraction. Doesn't always work though, and the killer doesn't always fall for it neither.
---
I just started playing since last month and I have no problem if killers want to camp, at the moment, maybe bcus I haven’t encountered overly “toxic” ones yet. But I totally get what you are saying. It’s boring af if the killer wants to play that way, but they’ll get less blood points, and will more than likely get 1 or no kills, so let them camp and either keep playing the same you have been, bcus you will encounter players like these and that goes with ANY game, or just go SWF and have a higher chance of winning w/ the killer getting no kills and your group gets rewarded with more blood points/pips given your doing all your primary objectives. Too much fun to be had with this game to worry about a toxic trial once in awhile. Hopefully, it doesn’t begin to become the nature of the game w/ given future patches.
---
Pig's stall is limited, Freddy can constantly sleep people.  The 7 second Dream Transition has specific consistent point when he's invisible and visible, allowing him to throw people off during Transition.  Also, &gt;Pressure being the gimmick that decides tiers.  Clown's got a power that applies even less pressure, since it's all committed to the Chase and even then it's a mediocre power at best.
---
Freddy has a fun playstyle as he is.  Why should they spit in the eye of current Freddy players and rip out the fun aspects of his kit?  What would you do, make him M1 McGee who's power makes him M1 even better?
---
It'd be like if the Devs said "ok let's rework doctor survivors hate him and he's got bad chase so we need to rework him into a chase killer mmk", removed the Static field, Randomized Madness Screams, and Doc Illusions, but increased the range of the Zap, and removed part of the slow Doc has when he charges.  Would it be a beneficial rework to Doc?  I mean it'd make him stronger in chase, and he'd probably shoot up to upper-mid tiers, but he'd lose that spark that sets him apart from other killers, he'd lose what makes Doc Doc.  That's what I'm afraid will happen to Freddy, and if it does I want him to be top 3 to make up for it.
---
(Repost) First one got removed cuz I didn't erase usernames.
---
Huge part of dbd is also atmosphere. Deathgarden feels so empty.
---
Freddy: Once the ball gets rolling he's got solid game slow and map knowledge.
---
Clown: M1 man that slows himself to slow Survivors by the same amount.  In fact I might call Clown worst in the game.
---
Bubba: Once again M1 McGee, but better than Clown since he can use his power on rare occasion to actual effect.
---
Trapper: Lemme *Gen pop* just *Gen pop* set up *Gen pop* my traps. *Gets in chase, all of the traps are already disabled, or funky hitboxes get you caught instead of the Survivor*
---
Lol wtf
---
How about 60 ping in lobby, but in match the moment you run towards pallet, you start teleporting back into killer /shrug
---
Despite the hassle, it's almost a badge of honor to wear that you got someone that angry at you. I'd hate to see what happens when someone uses NOED, does he send a hitman?
---
Oh i agree, but in theory you kick gens only when you desperately want it regressed.  I'm not quite that ascended yet, but I believe that's the idea.
---
Nah, you can wiggle your fingers even while walking.  If you're hunkering next to the last Survivor, or just really want to smack said person, then holding M2 is the only guaranteed way to prevent finger wiggles.
---
Truth, but I had to slightly meme on how it can occasionally look in-game.
---
Yes, you're just repeating exactly what i said. People find it funnt becaude he looks funny and has a funny name. Comedy gold
---
Survivors are slowed by a LOT more than you think. You just have to be good with his bottles. He forces survivors to drop pallets a lot earlier and he can get a lot of free hits so he's good
---
This is SO intense I can’t deal with this level of wigery 
---
So I’ve been using prove thyself this whole time and it didn’t really do anything? Can you explain a little better?
---
I hsve both ast hundred now. As survivor its quiet easy becuase you don't have to aim really.
---
As killer i miss sometimes but i leave it at 100%. But not for huntress. one time on 100%, never again. 80% for her.
---
What the hell? 2 killers? 
---
My LF is P1. Love me some LF.
---
Holy shit, you play killer at 100%? Well, obviously building up to that right? I feel 35%-ish feels good for now. Mainly when survivors try to 180-360 juke or even don’t successfully manage to I will lose them! I also don’t have a full loadout yet since I just unlocked my favorite killer the clown. Aside from the jukes I’ve had REALLY good games, getting 3-4K aside from one match since mmr is at a strange state putting a rank 17 killer against rank 10s, and I was able to hit each survivor at least once and hook 2 survivors, but it was blatantly obvious these guys were SWF w/ comms, camping while I hook. 
---
But yeah, I’m gonna stay at 35% sens for killer for now, and 70% for my survivor. I want to eventually git gud enough to play survivor at 100% or damn near close to, and eventually killer at atleast 50-60%, so I don’t get pallet, vault, or 180/360 juked and losing my survivor. Lol
---
Oh my god! That shirt (and you) is adorable!
---
"The punchline line is that he's fat and has a funny name" I never stated that he's funny because he's fat, I said that some redditor photoshopped chungus onto a playstation cover with a bunch of wacky things and people make jokes about how they've found him on different games and how theu bought his game (even though it doesn't exsist)
---
I GOD DAMN HATE RANK RESET AS A SURVIVOR. WHY AM I THE ONLY ONE ACTUALLY DOING GENS? I HAD THIS GAME WITH THREE OTHER SURVIVORS WHO ALL EQUIPPED URBAN EVASION, WHICH IS FINE, GOOD PERK, BUT WHY THE FUCK DO YOU NEED TO CROUCH AWAY AS SOON AS YOU HEAR A HEARTBEAT??? ALSO IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO DODGE A BILLY CHAINSAW FROM 25 METERS AWAY, JUST LOOK BEHIND AND TURN A LITTLE. FUCK. AND ALL OF THEM SURVIVES WHILE MY ADRENALINE WENT UNPOPPED WITH ONE GEN TO GO (MIND YOU I POPPED THE OTHER THREE) BECAUSE IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SAVE SOMEONE STRUGGLING IF YOU HEAR A DISTANT HEARBEAT. 
---
Hahaha, take the upvote you bastard.
---
I main Freddy at Rank 1 and he's vicious against altruistic survivors.
---
I can NOT play huntress even at default at the moment. I guess I just have to get used to projectile aim, coming from a FPS background I found myself trying to flick shot my hatchets, lol, and that’s the totally wrong way to play hunter. But that’s insane that you guys can play killer at 80-100% sens, props. 👍
---
It means playing the game more than usual. 
---
To the one guys still playing... thanks for keeping the dream alive bruv ;)
---
Oh my.Pretty good job so far
---
Nice.
---
You will get better with time. Letting the game frustrate you will cause you to make mistakes and do worse in a match. Maybe you should try last year the nightmare though! It's actually helpful to take a break with a different game btw what killers do you main? Also how much playtime you got?
---
Maybe you should walk away from this for awhile. Maybe stuff is going on in real life that parallels how you feel as a "killer" when everyone escapes. If I felt like that I would take sometime away from something that made me feel like that.
---
This is why I love distortion 
---
this is poetry 
---
Yesterday someone made a post like this but explained his plight and asked for advice... and he got it. This post is just you complaining about that one game where you got wrecked, not a problem with the game you want fixed or a broken perk. If you want a reason to keep playing and need some help, make a different post and maybe be less... brash.
---
I’ve been having a lot of fun with huntress, whenever I’m allowed to have fun that is. I’m not sure how much time I have played on the game since I’m not at my computer right now. Also, I’ve heard that game is meh.
---
I heard on the devs stream console optimization was going to happen in the Spring.Finger crossed
---
wut
---
here we go.. more suggestive criticism lul
---
I’ve literally gotten the exact same toxic survivors multiple matches in a row, and they all kept being toxic or being sarcastic towards me.
---
If you're longing so much for constructive criticism, why not respond to my post?
---
On console you can see the name of the killer and even message them before the game starts if you use the menu... but survivors should never be able to see the killer perks dude.
---
Sure thing, its www.twitch.tv/primelink_
---
You can dodge the lobby, unlike the survivors.
---
As a legion main, tunneling is so much fun. Makes for a good chuckle
---
Okay so I dont know why but it wont add the underscore as part of the name. It's Primelink_ on twitch. 
---
I do agree that if you team up and set perks as a group you can win very consistently. I'm mainly speaking from the point of view of random searches where you don't actually know who you're playing with y'know? I will say that it is far more common to find a toxic killer than a toxic group of survivors. Just because you got the blood splatter outfit don't mean you're good haha =p
---
Isn’t there a post on here discouraging killers from dodging lobbies because of certain survivors they see?
---
Honestly, I really should quit. I get told a solution, but then that solution gets me a bunch of flak.
---
That's exactly why I made the video, I'm happy to help!
---
Perfect
---
I did boyo
---
Look, I know you aren't someone that will change their mind no matter how wrong they are but, how does the game favour killers after years of patches trying to make killers viable? A killer can't play distraction while 3 other people do his work. A killer can't just die and tell his teammates exactly what perks and add ons the survivors have. And most importantly, a killer can't get away with complaining every time something doesn't go their way
---
For real though, without bamboozle and everything. 
---
and wot m8 I didn't say you should be able to see their perks at the load in lobby lol
---
He did...That's how he got screenshots of reddit/dbd forums.
---
He felt the need to share the search results for some reason.
---
what I mean is that when you complete a game, at the end, you see everybody's perks 
---
If you mean you can't blink forward while out in the open you probably just look down too much. This is an intended behavior and you can avoid it by just looking a bit more up before starting the blink.
---
Odd to assume my mind is unchangeable and in the way of err. Kinda asserting your own impression onto me. To be clear I made a suggestion to see what the thoughts would be. I also said that I'm speaking more so of random match queues as opposed to having all of my friends on playing with me. Don't even act like playing killer is absurdly hard kid. That's just stupid. A killer can have perks/hexes that make the entire game a pain. Not to mention most people playing killer now aren't some noob bois trying to figure out how to play. I bring this up because as a survivor it is equally as frustrating to have someone just leave in the beginning of the match. When it happens every other match or so that's really a downer to continue trying to play with randies.
---
So that's why she is 110% movement speed
---
Yeah there was a glitch a long time ago where survivors could get those splinters on their web, and after it was patched they didn’t remove them, so now survivors with those bugged splinters can force the killer to play a certain character with no perks
---
I feel like it's pretty common for people to call out killer location in game, but not really in spectate. I don't usually bother once I'm dead since I'm not really part of the game anymore. I do however say perks if they ask for them. Most of the time though, me and my friends can figure out all of the perks they have before we get a gen done though. Personally I always make sure that if I see where the killer is going, even if they aren't heading to a team mate. Then again, I'm always in the Red ranks and I always kill myself to protect my team. So it's not really that big a problem for the killer to get me when I distract 90% of the time.
---
S c h l e e p  1 0 0
---
Nah, people don’t care who makes the game.
---
If a game has any kind of fun/ interesting mechanics it will catch on.
---
No I'm saying it was as big of a meme as it is because of that reason 
---
A survivor seeing the killer in-game and calling it out is completely different to spectating the killer after death.
---
Granted I do agree that swf (at least the sweaty tryhard ones) do have a major advantage with comm callouts like that. But in reality a dead swf is usually not going to be doing much, since the alive members should already be calling out the information they see. 
---
Don’t forget they find hex ruin 1-3 minutes into the game the its gennie rush.

nah it was a P3 Laurie with DS

that's how mafia works

Play a Billy and if they do this, easy basement camp.

Honestly I kinda stopped reading after "Heavily Killer sided" or whatever. This game is built with Rank 20 survivors in mind. I know that, and I'm a 4 time Rank 1 survivor main. If you really think the game is killer oriented, you must live under a rock tbh.

---
Honestly yeah it is.You lost the guy and proceeded to camp waiting for the unhook.If you look at it another way enlighten me.
---
This is actually amazing lmao
---
&gt;But in reality a dead swf is usually not going to be doing much, since the alive members should already be calling out the information they see.
---
It's a different thing to be able to coordinate information from 3 players, summarize it, and provide them the best advice for that joint information. That's a completely additional advantage than merely doing shout-outs. You're basically 'managing the team.' To believe that isn't advantageous is to say that you may as well fire every NFL and NBA coach.
---
Unfortunate
---
You can run enduring and unnerving presence to recover faster and make it harder to hit respectively. It’s only once per game after all, and if you miss, you don’t get it again. I would recommend enduring, so it pays off no matter what.
---
It's not a crap perk, but you shouldn't have to use up a perk slot to counter DS. Besides, some Killers like Huntress and Nurse really benefit from not running Enduring.
---
Nobody is saying Enduring is a trash perk or anything. It's just annoying that we always have to run it to counter DS (which, even then, it doesn't even really counter DS).
---
Thing is, they’ve paid money in order to let me know that they are partaking in toxic behaviour, that’s why I save my Mori’s and add-ons. I only use them in specific situations like that, otherwise I use standard builds. They’re asking for it, that’s what it boils down to. 
---
Always I'd assume.
---
You're gonna help each other out. Tell eacj other if you see the killer and where, just as you solo like to know what the killer is doing.
---
I play 2 man swf and yeah we help each ither out if 1 dies to let them know what the 2 other survivors are doing. If they're being chased, on a gen, hatch camping etc
---
It sucks but that's the way the game is. If someone is hatch camping though while gens could still easily be done then it becomes a mission to notify the killer of that persons location. Had a game recently on springwood , 3 people alive, jusy got it down to 1 gen left. We hadn't seen quentin in ages. I fie, spectate and hes sat hiding in the basement even though the killer is nowhere near him. He stayed there for ages too rather than helping. At that point we start rooting for the killer lol
---
Just take a break. Keep in mind it's just a video game and it's supposed to be fun so if any game get's you this angry you need to step away for a bit and come back later otherwise you just get in a rut that you won't come out of. The other way is to just mess around back if they T-Bag for example drop your head like disappointed or when you get the T-bagger down swing the cam about so it looks like killer is dead excited he got the kill.
---
Yikes
---
I used laugh on the post chat like "lol, unexpected" or "wtf are using NOED, you are Myers haha".
---
Now I cleanse all the totems I can. It's insane how many of them carry it... And I'm starting to think it's worth it just for the speed movement bonus :+
---
I mean, if the free trial a couple months ago only was a bit more optimized, people would have actually kept playing it instead of having 20, spike-y FPS.
---
The hair is nasty but the rest of it looks pretty neat.
---
If you aren't ass as a killer you literally find people in the first 30 seconds whilst you're sweeping the gens haha 
---
From my experience, farming happens at every rank. It sucks but you can't really do anything about it :/ When I play killer and see a survivor hook farming I'll always go after the unhooker cause I know how annoying it is

&gt; Procedural Hook Generation
---
Matt - "One of the biggest things we have in the PTB is the change to hooks and hook offerings. For people who don't know what procedural generation is, it's essentially randomization with rules."
---
Not_Queen - "So how things spawn in the map."
---
Matt - "Previously, hooks were not managed through a density, or minimum distance. Basically that was leading to imbalances and inconsistencies. You could have hooks really close to each other, stuff like that."
---
Cool, how about actually FIXING the pallet spawns now? Because I'm tired of pallets right next to each other. 
---
This is epic 
---
Welcome to arguably the safest loop in the game! 
---
Thankfully there are a few options to minimise the time wasted at the shack. 
---
The first is ‘Bamboozle’, I don’t personally run it on any Killer other than Wraith, but it can work on technically everyone bar the Nurse. By vaulting the window you either: 
---
A) Force the Survivor to use ‘god’ pallet. 
---
B) Force them away from the loop (almost always a free hit) 
---
Another piece of advice is if the survivor vaults from inside to out, follow them over the window, use your red stain to feign chase, then turn and re-vault the window. 
---
If you catch them off guard you can chase them out of the shack or again force the ‘god’ pallet drop. 
---
Try to avoid ‘window techs’, if you vault a window chasing after a survivor, make sure to be wary that they aren’t trying to sneak behind you. Too many killers just charge off in the direction they saw the survivor run after vaulting. 
---
Generally though - any experienced player will still waste your time, unless you’re playing Hag/Trapper/Nurse - there isn’t too much you can do outside of trying to waste the pallet and kill the loop for later chases. 
---
Good luck! I hope my advice was of use. 😊
---
I didn’t think you could moonwalk on console. He was doing 180’s and 360’s to make you miss. 
---
I think they are 2 different things as one is something that you bring in to help you win and the other is a tactic. Items would be more comparable to add-on's so if survivors complained about a killer using best add-on's but they brought in a purple flashlight that would be hypocritical e.g. Killer thinks a purple flashlight is toxic but survivor thinks Frank's mix tape is toxic.   
---
Camping is a tactic just like someone who wants to crouch around the whole map trying to be immersed doing gens. Neither are great tactics although you can get results and wins now and then your gonna get better results more consistently if you play other ways. 
---
Can you moonwalk on PC? It's weird, he didn't appear to make 360s at all, just twitching backwards towards me and then making a sharp 180 when he was right in front of me. 
---
If you aren't ass as a survivor you'll do two gens in the first two minutes while the killer chases one survivor.
---
I think chat should be default off. but if you do want to chat you just click one button which opens it and you see all
---
That's not how this works.
---
rip
---
Well you're going to be disappointed because they never said June, they said end of summer, so closer to August
---
Self care, DS, die hard, adrenaline, borrowed time. And how do us complaining about gens being done and using those perks correlate? They don't stop gens from being done so quickly.
---
It's not about how well they can m2 in order to m1. It's about how effective they are at applying pressure consistently, without taking player skill into account. If you have a killer like freddy where he is literally an m2 in order to m1 killer where he is forced to use his power to interact with survivors. Where his power also doesn't do too much in regards to anything else since getting out of the dream world is relatively easy and usually doesn't take long. And also the fact that you have to constantly reapply his power, otherwise the survivors have literally zero pressure on them, then his pressure generation is extremely low. 
---
We can then look at another killer, let's say myers. He is an m1 killer, but his power buffs his abilities. He has an instadown as well as increased movespeed. With the instadown being a normal hit it allows for him to generate a lot of pressure with it while he is in tier 3, also the fact that he can essentially store the instadown and use it to instantly end a chase that had just started. That applies some pressure to survivors since he has fast movespeed as well as an instadown. 
---
Being able to end chases extremely quickly, or cause a decent amount of stall helps to pressure survivors. Freddy has nothing to help him end chases faster than normal, his stall is also mediocre at best since there are far too many ways to wake up. Although most of all it has to do with the fact that freddy is basically nonexistent until a survivor gets put into the dream world, every other killer can always interact with survivors and attack them without having to wait.
---
I do not get your statement about only playing nurse. If you're only going to play the very best killer in the game, then why are you playing freddy to start with? It's quite obvious that no one beats nurse. 
---
Your doctor analogy was based on your statement that doctor was bad. By simply using facts to show that doctor isn't bad it nullified the rest of that statement. Freddy needs a rework, his power just doesn't cut it in this game. He has needed it for quite a long time.
---
Freddy's power is pretty much just the ability to interact with survivors. It needs to be reworked so that he is actually decent. 
---
The only one I will agree with is borrowed time, that is defo op. The rest? they hardly even phase a killer with NOED, Rancor or Dying Light. You're gonna one hit anybody you come across and the only way to combat that is......????? Die hard or sprint burst lol. It isn't like survivors can see where your hex totems are so them being found early game would be "bad algorithms" right? 
---
Oh I agree I just put that in because some people would argue it's exploiting a game mechanic same as gen tapping can be viewed that way. End of the day if the devs don't care why should we. 
---
No no, I'm not forgetting other option don't worry. We can also play hide n seek but it's not really fun for both side right? Pallets are really tricky to use if you want to rent them, so it's really skilled. 360 also is a tricky thing and can be easily countered, it's just powerful when the killer didn't expect it. 
---
Ability to see my perks ?! That would be ridiculous. Survivors not knowing what you're gonna run and surprising them is an important strength of the killer. I'd be ok with seeing the name of the killer, but killer mains like Jumpscare Myers would suffer a lot from that, so I'd prefer if it weren't included.
---
Oh, thought you meant it didn’t catch on cause of that
---
I love how her toes are ripping through her socks
---
Oh hell yeah crotus prenn was my favorite but with the snow aesthetic and similar layout this ones my new favorite for sure
---
yeah its a weird perk that works in no perk builds it does need a rework
---
Like how can you even say self care is op lmao.... Survivors being able to heal when you can hit them twice and they're down is op? not being able to do that would make the game.... heavily favor the killers no?
---
Do you really think NOED is that bad? The time where NOED is activated the game is mostly over and you can avoid it pretty decently if you use pallets and windows right. And yeah, the totems being found early is bad programming on the dev's side. Some of them are so important, that they fuck the entire game if they're found in the first 30 secs.
---
No callouts are not just location. Callouts also include strategy, but in a game like this location is the main callout since that is the basis of the strategy. If you're working on a gen, or need a heal, or need someone to distract the killer, etc. It all stems from a callout of locations. 
---
The only time there is a need for a callout from someone who is no longer in the game is if there is only 1 person left, or if they died working on a gen. With the only 1 person left scenario the only callouts needed there are hatch callouts if someone knows where it is. 
---
I do not think that you know how proper callouts work. There is no need to filter because they are already short and to the point. 
---
I know right, instead they broke Legion even more, pretty good job so far 
---
There is a way to do it externally but right next to the chatbox is a box with two arrows in it, just clickthat
---
In a 2 man swf I have to pull info from my mate when he dies. I can find out if the killer is in a chase with a random or what perks/mor I might be incoming but other than that hes not that useful. He also doesn't have my map knowledge or game time so any info beyond that I try to feed him is pretty useless also. Not saying some teams arent coordinated but not to the point of punishing swf beyond the current nerf which I see respect and have waited for a while.  
---
What was different about it?
---
Oh nah
---
I do not think in any way that survivors should see perks or the killer they are up against. Merely the gamer id they use for psn or whatever they're playing on lol. I personally love DBD and the anxiety/adrenaline rush of trying to find out who the killer is in the beginning of the game. I honestly just hate having people leave a game because they don't want to play against somebody. Makes the experience kinda meh. :/
---
Re-read my first comment.
---
Boy, did I say self-care is op? I meant it was strong, not op. Why are there medkits in the game, if the survivors can just heal themselves? It removes the skill in holding on to medkits and trying to get hit as little as possible. If the killer doesn't have nurse's calling you can just stand at a pallet and heal up and even if the killer has nurse's you're pretty safe under the pallet.
---
OG Brand New Parts were even more OP. Just hit the one button and the entire gen is completed
---
So in short, you're entitled to play with the kind of players you want in random matchmaking?
---
Not sure if I have this one, but I definitely have others on my vods. I love playing kyf because I can hear them get mad at me. Literally all my friends get salty because they say I'm too good now lol. (It is Kill your Friends)
---
I love it

Thanks guys, I checked it on YouTube and found the thing.

Now this... this I would cry at ingame.
---
This is what I do.  No hope?  Well, let's pop a bloodpoint pinyata and get into a chase.   Won't be a total loss in the match if I can get in a good chase, right?  
---
(RIGHT? lol)
---
I mean, camping in front of a survivor while waiting for the sacrifice to complete is a low blow
---
Killer: *Hooks survivors*
---
Survivors: You’re toxic.
---
Survivors: *Does Gens*
---
Killer: You’re toxic.
---
👀👀🤷‍♂️
---
Thats how mafia works. 
---
Left behined should prevent you from exiting
---
It isn't logical that you escape, goes against the name of the perk.
---
No one left behined should allow the killer to escape as well, it's not logical that you leave the killer behined when the perk has this name.
---
If Left behined and no one left behined are both equipped in the same match, the game should crash because they contradict each other
---
This genuinely made me laugh wish I had gold or platinum to give 
---
damn i commented something similar a while back and got very little appreciation, except for the “if i could gold you, i would”
---
But if it's like 10 seconds til the struggle phase ends and you were getting baited by hook divers, go for it.

The game map isn't bad anymore after the pallet changes. So many safe pallets.
---
The majority of people play in SWF, the game needs to be balanced around them. I'm all for giving a buff to solo players when it comes to that. An indication when a totem has been cleansed would be neat. 
---
Honestly I rarely see killers being toxic more so the survivors then again I’m killer main and haven’t got very big rank with survivor 
---
Have you played high rank competitive? Everyone is doing anything they can to get a disconnect, or a temp ban so it’s an easy win, teabagging, cheaters in nearly every game
---
Still is! Happened yesterday with a Butcher Wraith!
---
Flashlight would have veen better!! Doh!
---
Even nurse has more counterplay than Legion. I dont remember the last time I played a goddess tier nurse that couldn't be juked to some extent. I'll take a more than half decent nurse any day over prebuff legion. Getting hit with no possible counter from legion is infuriating. 
---
You didn't, the reason he is funny is because people make comparisons to other game characters. Also, some memes aren't always understood by all. That being said, maybe you might not find it funny but others do. Some memes aren't made for everyone...
---
Oh crap I thought they fixed that. 
---
It's apparently really moonwalking! There are some tutorials on YouTube. 
---
&gt; a game that heavily favors killers 
---
At this point I assumed this was a troll post, but you seem to genuinely think this and in the comments have tried to backtrack when proved wrong. From launch the game was heavily survivor sided and has slowly become more balanced with time. Now the game is pretty much balanced in terms of killer vs survivors. The individual balancing of each killer is the prevalent issue at the moment, with the strongest killers being a little too strong and the weakest killers not threatening enough. 
---
&gt;Second, you that complain about the DC'ing survivors know exactly what you're doing to incur players to DC. 
---
Like happening to down this survivor first? Or the survivor missing their decisive strike? Or simply playing a killer that this particular survivor doesn't like to play against? Survivors DC all the time for no good reason. 
---
&gt;My simple suggestion is to include the username of the killer in the load in lobby. 
---
While this wouldn't negatively impact me in anyway since I rotate between all killers, many players main a certain killer. Seeing their name in the lobby would tell survivors which killer they were against and let them bring perks to counter them.
---
Siege isn’t nearly as toxic. I play ranked and for the most part everyone tries except for a few cases whereas in DBD survivors and killers see who can be more of an asshole every game.
---
Yep especially today when everyone just CAMPS
---
That is genuinely horrifying.
---
Getting them cheevos. 
---
Wake Up should make it so the exit gates open the millisecond they become powered. 
---
Dbd, Smite and LoL. My top 3.
---
A bunch of testicles.
---
I'm not saying Siege had zero toxicity, but I'd say Siege's toxicity is defiantly lower that Dead by Daylight's toxicity. I have played high elo ranked as well. I was also on PS4 where they don't do jack about anything.
---
People teabagged and cheated there (Mouse and keyboard in higher ranks), but it was *very* rare for me to get any messages while playing. While playing DbD though, I literally got hatemail for a week straight for doing *nothing*. This is the only game on PS4 I've played that made me feel as though I couldn't enjoy it unless I turned off my messaging.
---
Me too, I’m loving it!
---
that's a long head

Wait why do you hate toth? It seems like a good perk
---
thats not what make this juke funny its his friend reaction
---
True, but you can use that to your advantage.  It only takes 2 or 3 Overcharge failures to do massive damage to a Generator, and Freddy can force those failures pretty handily.  It's certainly a niche build, and once that I don't really one for sure, but I've seen it work quite nicely.
---
??? What are you talking about, the game literally ended in a 4k because I didn't escape the moment the exit gates were available??? Like do you know what remember me is?
---
“a while ago” = over a year ago, patch 1.80 in October 2017. Funnily enough that’s when I bought the game so I had no idea what brown map offerings were for months.
---
Want it in all colors!!!!
---
but the halloween event was trash for survivors and heaven for killers. yikes. 
---
This is it chief
---
i'm glad i never got to vs her, 1 of my Friends  randomly qued with her once's and he killed 1 of the swf and got reported for lag switch by 4 streamers,not a prem ban at least.
---
Game if you have nurse's calling and sloppy is the absolute best
---
Thank you :3
---
Oh yeah it's not your that's calling people the n word btw.
---
I was more thinking Silent hill nurse :3 
---
That would be like getting bloody paid skins for prest.
---
Legion other 2 personas just skins
---
Alright, as much as I fucking hate Leatherface, that's fucking funny. And I haven't seen a nice strand since Fortuna 69 on Warframe.
---
That's exactly what I was gonna say, inb4 Silent hill nurse Susie.
---
Amazing job btw, it looks nice !
---
I have also come into a jendenise stream and noticed herself and her team bullying killers. It's really disgusting.
---
This^
---
Also killer perk callouts mid chase as well. Got sloppy? If I het hit my entire team is gonna know about it before they get hit. You took a swing at me 3 times in 1 second and no one is obsession? Everyone is going to know you're using unrelenting, if I'm the first to get a skill check on a gen and it's red, everyone is going to know ruin is active and at what tier it is. Are you using dying light and I'm the obsession, everyone will know about it after I get hit. Are you ungodly and unusually fast after the last gen is done and weren't in a chase before seeing me? Go find noed. 
---
Are you playing any killer that I main? I know exactly which add-ons you're using as well based on how the killer operates with specific add-ons and how they are using that killer.
---
I usually have all of this information and relayed it to my team before my first hook. I have all this information because I play both sides. I don't just only play 1 side.
---
You do the same thing as a killer and if you don't you should start doing it. By that I mean you make mental callouts to what perks survivors have, where their last known general location is, if they'll commit to that gen or not. How often you get baited. Make mental callouts to yourself as a killer. This is especially most helpful against swf groups that aren't a bunch of potatoes.
---
That guy must be getting one hell of a queue time.

&gt; but now they moan in the friend request 'note' section.

Sony will ban an account for this on the first offense.

Yeah telecommunications is held by the federal government and after the anonymous DDOS episodes in the last 10 years they don't mess around when anyone does this. It should be treated as a serious federal crime and fuck any childish person who take losing a game so seriously that they stoop this low

Sadly I’m not on pc :( I wish I could, I like finding people in random games who aren’t salty and grouping up with them.

Well it’s a sci-fi/fictional movie so yeah I’d say it’s not scientific fact, nor was it ever passed off as such. Sure some stupid people believed it (and believe the idea behind it before) but people also think the earth is flat so can’t expect critical thinking to apply to everyone. Do you also call Star Wars absurd bullshit because lightsabers aren’t real?
---
Oh yeah. Voicecomms in the clip. Thanks for clarification.
---
You go into your steam library, find dead by Daylight, right click it, click uninstall and you're good to go! That's the best build for if you want to play spirit, 100% win rate
---
I never said you did. It's just that whenever i see similiar post i just leave link to this
---
The Clown slows for a fraction of a second, the Survivor is slowed for multiple seconds. By your reasoning Billy and Huntress also low tier because they're slowed when using their powers, and significantly more so than Clown. You just have to be good at using the bottles. Clown is definitely high-mid tier.
---
Cheers dude :) 👊🏻
---
What do you play on?
---
I got stuck in one spot and couldn't move. The killer realised (I was spinning around and had crows) so he downed me and let me wiggle off, run away and heal up. Thought that was really cool of him.
---
Appreciate the link dude :) 👊🏻

And at vaults, to stop fast vaults. And occasionally hail Mary bomb them over walls to break up a group on a generator that's still at the edge of your TR. God, that's fun, lol. They don't even know where you're coming from, sometimes one of them will even run at you.
---
That seems a bit drastic, but I'd consider reporting it if one person was spamming my account with it.
---
She's a speed killer. Anything to help with Map pressure would be best imo. Things like bbq, Discordance, Bitter murmur are good. Other perks that are good are chase perks. I like endurance and brutal strength with Spirit fury and Unrelenting. That's a pallet eating machine.

It comes close to Overwatch, the only exception is that I’ve seen a lot less racism, sexism and homophobia here, so as much as Killer/Survivor main entitlement can be annoying as fuck, it’s still better than Overwatch in general.
---
Sweet! Yeah, I’m ENJOYING clown a whole lot. I think I’ve only had one bad game with him and I’m only lvl 10, so working w/ 3 Perks right now.. When I get him to lvl 50, was thinking of lvl’ing up Huntress which for me I definitely need to start at a low sens since she is a mid-long range killer w/ her hatchets. Either her or spirit.. and I know for spirit I have to play at a higher sens from what I’ve seen and heard, and have also seen on streams. Lovin’ this game!

Having 1 bp is way more impressive than 0 btw. 
---
Doing gens. you?
---
Star wars admits that it's sci-fi. People actually believed this.
---
I need that ruin though lol 
---
always kind of wished freddy didn't do those things
---
It always happens nothing can be done about it so it is what it is. Why I love whispers against swf when they do call outs I can at least be able to continue moving around their location and search for them within proximity. Can't wait for the hiding the killer load out. Nice quality of life update
---
all high rank survivors who are bad do it sure, 1 man gens has always been the way to gen rush, so lets just agree to disagree
---
Ugh, as a Feng main as well, I pretty much hate all Feng's that use this outfit. You just know that they are either a huge weeb, or extremely toxic. Either way, I avoid them. No hate to you, though...
---
I am your favorite porn and I approve of this skin.
---
I dont use noed because I like to kill everyone before the gates are powered, but god sometimes yall make me want to use it out of spite.
---
LoL No They are not the same boy
---
Yea, and it remembers the state you left it at. So if you collapse it, it'll be that way until you want to change back.
---
Well sure but you can’t blame the movie for that calling *it* absurd bullshit. Of course it’s absurd bullshit, it’s science fiction. The people who believe a sci-fi film is real are just idiots.
---
this subs a magical place
---
Foreskin Susie
---
Definitely cool as shit. Where’d you get it?
---
The version I've landed on is. "When they flash-light your eye and you want them to die, that's a Mori."
---
This is 100% truth. I'm legit scared of a freddy rework and hope they keep delaying it.
---
gonna be real with you, no one in this community knows what gg even means, when one side gets completely obliterated its not really a good game, by definition, the losing side is supposed to say it first, to signify that "hey even though i lost it was a fun close game!" if you say it after completely wiping someone its really just bragging more than anything.
---
Honestly, the worst that I've ever seen from LoL is only about comparable to the average game on DBD and I played Lol for years at a decent level. The sheer vitriol this game incites is like no other.
---
Etsy! I think the shop is kustomkreations or something along those lines but if you just search dead by daylight on Etsy it was on the first page of results 
---
Yes, worse than any other game, including the really infamous ones.
---
I didn't complain at all, I was just explaining why I loop. 
---
It's been a while since I played the tutorial. Maybe I'm misremembering.
---
indeed it is the worst feeling in the world 
---
I know
---
Thanks!
---
I mean you're kinda true. Despite all the memes Freddy with Dresses is honestly way better than Freddy with Blocks because of the tracking power and game stall. Why play a shittier Wraith when you can have permanent Aura Reading and permanent game stall? The way to play Freddy is to sleep as many people as possible and make the game take 30 years.
---
The problem is that the game taking 30 years is no fun for everyone and Freddy's strength is tied 70% to RNG. That more than anything is why he needs a rework. It's not because he's weak because truth be told he is midway decent even at top ranks. He suffers at top ranks because he doesn't have any of the game-breaking mechanics that other Killers have but he's no worse than Leatherface or Wraith by comparison. Game stall doesn't matter at high ranks because Survivors work through it. As soon as someone falls asleep at Rank 1 everyone's going to hump gens like their life depends on it.
---
The reason Freddy doesn't work at Rank 1 is because everyone knows how to counter him, and the reason he needs a rework is because he's unfun to play against.
---
Yas. It’s supposed to match my skin. Gonna use it for a silent hill nurse :3
---
How to ensure you dont get monopol on a genre. Make another game competing with your older game.
---
why is jake so... big?
---
I think you should look up a doctor if your foreskin looks like this :0 don’t think it’s healthy 🤔
---
gonna be real with you, thats not really a meme, just a general joke, not really a reference to wow in any way
---
Don't use any add ons. All they do is make it harder for you to get used to the ability by changing the timing. Other than the basic +1 blink add on I would argue that all the others are detremental. When is clear someone's going to pallet stun do a tiny blink over it so you're just behind them and slash backwards so you'll catch them trying to vault back over it again.
---
is this a new skin or some fan thing?
---
They need killers like me
---
THEY NEED KILLERS LIKE ME
---
So they can get on their fucking keyboards
---
And make me D-tier, Hag-Li
---
Even with the add ons it is still quicker to kick it
---
As both a rank 1 survivor and killer, I’ve noticed that survivors tend to do it, well, a lot more. Basically whoever something doesn’t go their way, or god forbid they deem something *unfair*, the bitching ensues. 
---
Tbh Bubba's chainsaw is easier to use. I rather like him. 
---
You're wrong. It's much better to have 3 gens at 80% than finish one at the start of the game.
---
I did my Billy "chainsaw three survivors" daily in only two games!  Don't know if I have ever been happier as a killer.
---
For the record, I was NOT waiting for him to unhook. I was throwing the hatchet hoping to catch him as he was bobbing back and forth on the other side of the hook. He just happened to unhook the guy as I threw it.
---
IT WAS RAGE WEDNESDAY SO I HAD TO SHOUT, BUT YEAH THAT GUY WAS PRETTY COOL I WISH HIM ONLY THE NICEST PLAYERS IN HIS GAMES
---
Ok I think the toxicity is way overblown. Since coming back to this game a few weeks ago, I’ve seen 2 toxic survivors, and 2 toxic killers. Not that bad.
---
No mither
---
Well, add me on ps4 then. I play on there sometimes with my brother if I feel like messing around in the lower ranks. MysticDream21
---
I’m not really sure. It used to be The Game but then the hook placements were fucked up. 
---
Hey, were you Claudette and was it against the Huntress?
---
The feeling of getting called a baby killer only to mori him in next game felt so good especially having his friends watch and teabag him. ( I am petty right?)
---
It’s a perk called No Mither. The survivor is always injured but can heal themselves while being slugged. 
---
This is crazy. How long did it take to craft?
---
No problem! Idk where you live but they’re based in Australia so it took a few weeks for me to get 
---
Cabbage brain
---
Found the guy that whinges about noed.
---
Just basic privacy protection so people don't add or stalk Steam profiles. I'd have done it myself because I hate random friend requests.
---
Killer so good he got a hit on the loading screen
---
Alright cool 
---
Ordered an Xbox one for my controller on pc. I can wait a while always a surprise when I forget I order stuff like this haha
---
Yeah it was lol
---
This is honestly why the devs could make so much money off custom mods and game modes created by the community. Like a steam workshop sort of thing once they get dedicated servers. I would love to go against a billy with a claudette hammer. Or a shrek clown skin, etc. just a bunch of cool stuff you could do with this game that would be fun with mods.
---
Greetings traveler, have a look at my wares 
---
This was pc
---
Most toxic build for sure: 
---
Urban Evasion, Premonition, Spine Chill and Iron Will.
---
—&gt; Killer hates you as well as your team :) 
---
May your road lead you to warm sands
---
Looks like killer hit box near pallets
---
Maybe you’re not trying to punish the hooked person, but that’s exactly what you’re doing. 
---
By hiding and doing nothing except keeping the crows away.
---
At least this isn't the Overwatch community. That place is toxic and cringey as a bonus. I'll take DBD salt any day.
---
Ignoremsg in console, you're welcome. 
---
"FUN POLICE" 
---
No, you should've brought a real build. Wraith's weakness is the chase, not tracking, and you *only* have tracking perks. The fact you killed three of them running that makes me feel like they were potatoes.
---
He's not wrong tho
---
&gt; SWF? It's a part of the game
---
the comms they use aren't 
---
Tru3 is one of the chillest dbd streamers out there. He's not toxic and plays both killer and survivor pretty much equally. Doesn't shit talk other players either. Really cool guy. My favorite dbd content creator right next to HybridPanda.
---
My main takeaway here is that the game has progressed a decent ways when the weakest killer can do pretty decently in the right hands.
---
Ouch.. still got rank 1 before it so yay
---
Swamp
---
&gt;I don't have to see their low rank asses anymore.
---
Yeaaaah, about that? They were both Rank 2 on the post game screen. So could have been R1 given that the screen never shows R1 as R1.
---
You're trying to say something about the Spirit but I can't tell what. I know you're bitching about *something* but I can't tell what it is
---
If you do this with any killer perk versus the survivor equivalent you will have the same result. Bitter Murmur vs Dark Sense for instance. I honestly just want them to disable both perks so the sub can find something else to relentlessly bitch about.
---
In the time it would take 3 people, individually, to get 3 gens to 80% (64s); they can potentially get 2 gens completed and guarantee the hatch, if they work together.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
h e  r i s e s.
---
It's latency. Not the hitbox
---
Stop caring about other peoples opinions and just camp. Camping is good.
---
IDK what games yall getting in or maybe me and my friends (and the randos we join sometimes) are never this toxic lmao
---
Oh. Well, umm, I don’t actually know how I didn’t notice that. 
---
Let’s just blame that on me being extremely tired at the time. 
---
Lol, I appreciate the encouragement. Thanks
---
Found the other noed user.
---
Well yeah they are. On PS anyway it's built in. Not sure how it is on PC. I had a couple buddies play with me and we were on party chat. Didn't help us any but it was fun.
---
If you are a killer would you rather get beat by a team or mocked and bullied? Maybe at the high ranks its different?
---
If there was a team tournament would the survivors be able to talk to each other? 
---
It works. I've done it before where as soon as I get the hook I saw the last 2 survivors. Camped, slugged one, got the other and hooked both.
---
If they're not hook rushing, I won't camp 
---
Overcharge, Unnerving Presence, Huntress Lullaby, Ruin. 
---
You can't report them in game because you....GET DISCONNECTED from the game. Thus I can't get their steam ID. What's really stopping me from getting a hold of some scripts, put some weird square block characters as my steam name and doing the same thing?
---
So you're saying we should put Susie in a Nurse's outfit?
---
They weren't bad (very toxic though), i'm just very horrible at spoting people, that's why i run so much tracking.
---
Lmao wake up is so good you can open the exit gate 2 seconds faster 
---
I was 12 but got on today and I’m 15 again, this keeps happening to me every time I get back on, I’m back to 15. So, I guess they want me to be 15 forever. 
---
I love it, not tacky like others I’ve seen
---
I mean, it's the same as if you're in her terror radius, isn't it? 
---
as a p3 Quentin I appreciate this
---
It all depends on your playstyle. For Ace you could use Self-Care,Urban Evasion, Dead Hard/Sprint Burst and Iron Will.You can also use Adrenaline,Borrowed Time.If you don't want to use Self-Care, you can use Pharmacy 
---
For Myers I personally use Hex:Ruin,BBQ&amp;Chili,A Nurse's Calling,Monitor &amp;Abuse. You can also use Bamboozle,Brutal Strength,Enduring,Spirit Fury
---
More like when you play killer.
---
Look like I’m gonna use ruin
---
(sorry)
---
They always make the hitbox either too small or way too large, but this is a connection problem, they threw where you were, but your connection hadn't told the game you moved yet
---
It's quite easy with some experience to have EW3 whenever you want it. I realize NOED is an end game perk,and you're probably not that good if you're using it, but Myers is still very strong. His instadown is reliable, which is why he's such a menace. 
---
Wait, wasn't opening 20 seconds though? 
---
I don’t have Leatherface so...
---
Yeah but if you're in her tr then you are already aware and moving away from the gen so no grab
---
God I hope so. I love playing Huntress but having my own experiences of truck-wide hitboxes as survivor, it makes me not want to play her unless its 3 AM when nobody in my house is taking up bandwidth.
---
Also I didn't purposely do the 3 gen start they refused to go in that corner almost all game screwing them in the end and like I said before I was at a point where I gave them 15 minutes to do a gen.
---
But BPs aren't the reason why you play survivor, which was his point. Killers can easily make +50k BPs each match with nothing but BBQ on and survivors have to risk a 13k game to get to +20k.
---
I switch back over to survivor lol
---
I just move on to the next game or take a break for a while
---
Hasn't their response been that throughout the entire game's lifespan? Could've sworn they said that camping/tunneling has always been allowed
---
why
---
I was just watching all stars s4 and then came here to see new dbd threads and this comes up. Life is good.
---
Pretend half the survivors are toxic and half the killers are toxic, then you have far higher odds of encountering a toxic player as killer than as survivor simply because 4v1.
---
Considering his other posts he did hit a nerve. I guess he hit another one with you. Baby survivor. xD
---
Nah. I remember seeing this live. I think this was about the time when people were leaving bags around and pens that could blow up. I still laughed at this because it's just a damn flashlight. 
---
I stand corrected. Edited original comment. Thanks 
---
“Noed? You’re cancer” I just got the perk 😂
---
You realize I'm talking about people who take games hostage in general right? As in your 1 experience isn't the definitive experience.
---
And besides are you expecting me to believe you 3 gen'ed them and then went afk for 15 minutes right after? You realize that if you push someone to trolling they're not gonna care if you let up right?
---
BBQ&amp;Chili makes it easier to grind those bloodpoints, so you can use whatever perk you like in its place
---
What if I like the screenshot of the in-game model better than those fan art pieces?
---
Now try again and have everyone run Up The Ante and Slippery Meat as well
---
*Revs chainsaw aggressively* 
---
well you're the one that's making out that toxicity among survivors is unbearable, meanwhile i can't even recall a time where a survivor said something this severe to me. however, i can remember a few times where i've received this kind of abuse from killers.
---
Oh my bad b for being good and able to loop him around for so long. Might as well remove windows and pallets, they seem too op for survivors.
---
How is it a survivor bias when I prefer to play killer?? 
---
Well I tried saying what happened doesn't matter who believes me I'm done talking have a nice day and great games in the future.
---
I personally get very upset and internalize it and things like that (yeah yeah yeah, im that kind of person.) but I usually either try a different killer or switch to a different game and listen to music 
---
You can't trick me that easily to give you an annoying build.
---
So what you are going to want to do is...WAIT A MINUTE
---
I usually grind out characters that I want to prestige
---
I grab a drink, remind myself that it’s just a game and that losing sometimes is a part of life for everyone, and think about what I could have done better/differently for next time. 
---
Lmao, he is t at rank one. He's doing it because of rank reset. Playing against baby survivors
---
Hex: No One Escapes Death and Sloppy Butcher are both meta perks that are available for all killers. Clown's own Bamboozle is a very strong anti-looping perk. 
---
Fourth perk is up to you. Could be Bitter Murmur or Whispers to help locate survivors. Clown's Pop Goes the Weasel can be nice perk to slow the game down if you can't access Hex: Ruin.
---
Don't have a video but here is what's [not reportable](https://i.imgur.com/Wc1cSla.jpg)
---
se tonight
---
yes but that's like 99% of games... i rarely see any ggs in my killer post-game chat
---
&gt; Also I didn't purposely do the 3 gen start
---
Never said you did. 
---
So are you trying to tell me that the players went to all the trouble of finishing 4 generators and then just decided not to do the last one and troll because of no reason at all? lmao
---
&gt; and like I said before I was at a point where I gave them 15 minutes to do a gen.
---
It doesn't matter if you're already past the point of trolling.
---
Wits worse around corners
---
Are you really a Freddy main if you don't call him Sharp hand Joe?
---
I have a hard time imagining anything more of a pain than a skilled nurse.
---
For Myers my favorite load out is scratched mirror with boyfriends letter for perks I run ruin,overcharge,monitor &amp; abuse, firm grasp and I’ll usually use the game offering 
---
Sure. But if you know a hooked survivor and one other are within your terror radius there's not much incentive to go elsewhere.
---
If you know there's a hooked survivor and two others within your terror radius you're actively hindering yourself by going anywhere else.
---
Nobody in any computer game knows what gg even means. The actual computer game that popularized it was Starcraft and in that game the loser always said gg first or nobody did. Because that way there's respect on both sides. And this comes from football by the way. There the losers say "good game" to each other after a match and winners respond in kind. It teaches way more and makes the loser feel better for being humble. Right now its always the winners with the "gg wp =)" bullshit especially in games where the opponent gets completely wrecked. And its not just in DBD. It's every freaking game out there today. Only the naive and dumb people think the winners actually mean a "Good game, fellow chap. You were worthy adversary and therefore I had fun and challenging experience playing against you." Its more like "I had fun beating the crap out of you. Gosh it feels good to win against people who are way below my skill. I should compete in the kindergarten 100 meter dash so I can win more."
---
Nobody freaking says that and means anything good with it.
---
And I'm calling out some weird behavior that implies you're leaving plenty of what happened out.
---
If you didn't want a reply then don't reply in the first place.
---
Don't reply
---
I usually grind points for characters I don't play so that I can get teachables and whatnot
---
Never said he was i actually really like true
---
Don't reply if you don't want a reply
---
This looks more like a nurse cosmetic, and goddamn I'd run away from this at top speed. 
---
I think he used to, at release. 
---
I didn't know either, thanks for asking.
---
Farm?Just tell the survivors you need it.Worked first try.
---
I usually switch either to a killer I'm good with or survivor
---
I'm not going to lie, it  was a real bitch to get.
---
It was just luck. Got to lvl 40 with my nurse before getting it.
---
Feng hasn't gotten shit in 5 months. It's about time they're throwing her a bone 
---
Fair enough, well done. I’ve been close but it was two blink aha 
---
Thank you! When I have more, I'll post it.
---
That could also be an option 
---
I always have trouble against Doctor, Wraith, and Freddy. Mostly because sneaking around doesn't work as well against them. 
---
If you have to ask "am I the asshole" the answer is yes.  1000x yes.
---
Killer: Voldemort
---
Survivor: Dumbledore
---
Voldemort has perk "Kill Dumbledore"
---
Dumbledore has perk "YOU BITCH!"
---
gj now go for the platinum \^\^
---
Hahaha i usually only play survivor anyway 😂
---
Hahaha that’s a good one too.
---
All the people that I play with laugh at me for taking small game but I love it so much. I'll take it over almost any other perk. It's hella useful especially when you're just running along and it goes off 
---
Sometime the hitboxes are the size of a pea and other times it feels like she's throwing a truck at you
---
I play SWF every night with 3 friends. Me and 1 friend are rank 1 - 2 (depending on losing a pup) and the other two friends are rank 7-8. Some nights we get right in (and then d/c because the killer doesn’t want to play against SWF. Some nights it’s 15-20 min. Always after 11pm EST. This is on PS4. Daytime games are so much easier. 
---
Min I can relate to being the black sheep of the family and stress of not wanting to disappoint people to the point where you kind of fuck yourself over.
---
ive already rendered her kimono outfit when she was first released .
---
I'm gonna miss the old leader. A friend and I would call ourselves leader squad and we would just crush gens together. It was enjoyable from time to time and we'd do it occasionally. I'm gonna miss having that option. Goodbye leader squad 
---
You truly never understand how many dull totems you pass until you take small game
---
You forgot the third type
---
Everyone gets out: GG EZ BABY KILLER LMAO UNINSTALL
---
What do you call a Trapper who places all his bear traps around a hooked survivor in the basement while patrolling the shack?
---
I close the game and play Bloodborne for a real challenge. The saltiest group of t bag flashing swf cant anger me at all compared to the defiled watchdog and ive beat him with no hits taken. 
---
Ive honestly never encountered more hostile players, not even since modern warfare lobbies in the days of old. Survivors got some real anger issues.  
---
F13 was deemed to be the DbD killer.
---
Deathgarden was deemed to be more of a spiritual successor.

Legion with franks mixtape and 3 gen strat Doc
---
My most annoying killers are the pig and legion. I mean the nurse can be annoying but they can easily be looped.
---
??? This subreddit likes to imagine that everyone who plays survivor is “toxic” and always has purple flashlights and clicks it at you and tells you to KYS but its way overblown. They also like to pretend that killers cant be “toxic”. From my friends experience, from my 1000 hours, from watching tons of twitch streamers perspective, everyone isnt “toxic” everygame like people on this subreddit make it out to be. Its just a circlejerk at this point. 5 posts a day make it to Hot that can be summed up to “le tozic killer/swf tebag me/camp me in basement smh!”
---
Also the word toxic is overused in the gaming community, it has devolved into meaning nothing. 
---
This subreddit has been like this since the beginning of time, its tiring. And I cant believe people still like to delude themselves like this when survivors got hit with like 3 major nerfs in every patch recently, theres not really any challenge as killer even against “toxic survivor pros”. 
---
This is also me. It activates when I don't want it too and then when I am being chased it doesn't fucking work!
---
Tbh I find that the nurse isn’t too bad on console, hardly anyone plays her and an even smaller minority are actually good with her
---

---
Oh i didnt really see it in your recent posts, is it also on reddit? should i look again?
---
I don't know. I feel like the only way killer can be toxic is to face/proxycamp or just play the nurse and/or use a mori. Survivors can literally hijack the game for the killer until all pallets have been spent. I don't think toxic survivors happen nearly as often as it might be seen in posts but if you're against 4 man SWF with 3 rank 1-2 survivors and 1 survivor at rank 16 while you're like rank 5 killer, you're going to be bullied all game unless you have extensive knowledge of the game and are able to run all the necessary perks and playing the necessary killer to counter all that.
---
Saying that there's not really any challenge as killer is just asinine and kinda tells that you don't really play killer at a high rank other than maybe Nurse or Huntress.
---
I think you mean the red and gold one and it was available as an event. If you didn’t play during the event, you can’t get it anymore I believe 
---
Games are 5 minutes or less if survivors play correctly. Gens need to be longer.
---
Use insidious and camp a gen lmao
---
Aha!
---
Are you a good clown player?
---
Bbq and chili + ruin. Then use whatever you want really. It all depends on how you want to play the game. Spirit fury + enduring if you just want to swing at every pallet and hit the survivor 90% of the time even if you get stunned. Sloppy butcher if you want to slow down the survivors a bit more by making them take longer to heal. 
---
What about bbq and chili?
---
I guess a "considerable" increase is only 3%, so we had a 16% chance per escape. I don't know what I expected.
---
Honestly if I ever see someone getting grabbed off with gen I assume one of 4 things.
---
1) Scratched Mirror Myers or at least one remaining in tier 1 for the meantime.
---
2) Spirit with prayer beads
---
3) Combat Strap Amanda ( Also Amanda's letter might be in play)
---
4) Silent Bell ghost Wraith
---
If it turns out that it's none of the four above then I assume the person who got yanked off a gen is an absolute dumbass and I would have more luck relying on tutorial Meg
---
&gt;likes a tweet from [insert group here]
---
OMG LOOK AT THE GUY HE MUST BE PART OF [insert group here]
---
I personally use BBQ&amp;Chili and Monitor &amp; Abuse. But you can also use Make Your Choice and Sloppy Butcher
---
shouldnt dedicated servers fix this
---
Fresh mask 
---
It might work but it’s not fun for either party to camp in my experience. But hey, if camping is what’s fun for you, do you I guess. 
---
honestly with how poor the sales are they should just release the cosmetics in the ingame store (still free for those that bought or buy the game)
---
As a survivor main, you have to acknowledge how absurdly strong that position is for survivors. Assuming the survivor is halfway decent and the killer doesn't have something that lets them deal with this (Bamboozle, Nurse, etc.) you pretty much have two options here: 
---
1) Chase them around for a minute while half of the remaining gens get done. 
---
2) Leave them and chase someone else.
---
It's a really shitty map feature.
---
Legion too, though I just enjoy Frank and Wraith.
---
tfw people don't realize telling people to kill themselves is literally a $20000 fine and if they do it they get sent to prison for manslaughter monkaS
---
lmao this is great
---
Y e s pls
---
It’s supposed to :3 it’s for my silent hill nurse nurse cosplay. Wanted to base a mask from Susie’s. 
---
I play Billy and used to play Spirit before sounds got bugged. If I try hard enough only one will escape from hatch. Also killers can hold the game hostage by blocking basement, Pigs can force death by crouching behind a survivor with a ticked bear trap and following them...there are plenty ways to be “toxic” in ANY game if you try hard enough.
---
If you play against a Rank 1-2 SWF as a rank 5 killer than yes you will probably have a tough time. And Ruin isnt the only way to slow the game down, you can do that by applying pressure by slugging and ending chases faster or with use of other perks like Sloppy Butcher. Of course you need experience and good perks to perform well against survivors who are teamed up and have experience and good perks...what else did you expect?
---
*flesh ;3
---
Jk. But yas ^ ^
---
BBQ, RM, Discordance, NOED is what I run rn on freddy, works pretty well for him
---
Literally half the games i play are against tunneling campers, maybe its a ps4 thing or killers are as toxic as survivors. 
---
Not when the walls are made out of slats. Slats are really easy to see through so the survivor should always know where the killer is. I'd be less against these if they were made of brick.
---
Oh, you touch my tralala,
---
mmm... My bing bing bong
---
Yeah dude totally no other killers in the game that can handle SWF.
---
You don't like events with freeish items?
---
By far the most toxic community.
---
OP said annoying, NOT HARD. Most annoying without a doubt is Legion. 
---
I don't understand, he's not holding anything, how can he hurt anyone
---
Imagine a fursuit legion skin

New killer: The Chungus

That'd be cool if it actually happened

It's funny because every killer (except legion and nurse) has little to no control over the chase and relies on survivor mistakes. So survivors need nerfs now because they can just break the game by being good at it?
---
I've been seeing more games lately where survivors will say gg post-game even if they were all killed, unless this is just something that happens at rank 1.
---
I didnt watch the video and i don't care about the joke all im saying is she sucks...
---
I don’t even know what a good nurse is !!! Literally the only benefit to playing on console. 
---
I like mindgaming with survivors at double t-walls.
---
BUT YOU CAN'T MINDGAME SEE THROUGH WALLS FARM MAPS ARE FUCKING GARBAGE
---
Ah, feels better.
---
You already have it but you have to pay for it again? 
---
Discordance,  Ruin, Sloppy Butcher. Thanatophobia. This works only if you use an addon to decrease skill check probability (green dress).
---
I do understand why these two were reluctant. They'd worked themselves into a corner. The last 4 gens were really close together, and three of them were inaccessible without alerting me they were there. At the same time, though, how is it fun to just hide and hope the other guy dies? I've been in similar three/four gen situations as Survivor and the only chance you have is to try your best. If you die, you die. And you'll get more points being chased and sacrificed than hiding in a corner, being grabbed out of the hatch, and sacrificed.
---
We were paired with a survivor today who spend half of the match waiting for us dying so he could get the hatch.
---
Killer eventually gets him before hooking the other one and kills him.
---
Survivor in chat: TOXIC KILLER BLAH BLAH.
---
We sided with the killer (who played very nicely) and he went completely nuts. There are very sad people out there. I hope they are kids and eventually grow the fuck up.
---
I played a survivor game in which a David unhooked me twice right in front of the killer and essentially wanted me to die. He was farming me for WGLF, I checked once I was deathhooked. This man had DS and a flashlight, but he didn’t sacrifice himself for his team at all. He sacrificed his teammates for himself.
---
That’s farming. It’s annoying for survivors. Every other David does it. They just want points, and they don’t care about their team.
---
I have nothing to wear!
---
And what are your suggestions to make rank 1 fun?
---
They did, although I think it's a word of mouth issue more than anything. People will report others for camping and tunneling, so naturally those who are uneducated will think it's a reportable offense too.
---
Just give us a BP bonus at a certaint rank like 25℅ bonus BP at rank 1
---
Well i mean the nurse doesnt have to worry about most obstacles nearly as often as other characters when she can just teleport through objects and pallets
---
Please down the cunt unhooker and not the just unhooked one..
---
A killer making sure to secure his kill.
---
I mean this Huntress was playing them terribly. Even if they’re see through why the hell would she go back and forth through the window twice, and plus since it’s Huntress, she is one of the best killers to punish these tiles other than nurse since those window vaults are basically free hatchets. 
---
Pamu-Pamu-Pamu!
---
Aww, thank you so much
---
And????
---
I really hadn't experienced frequent disconnects until the past week.  Yesterday, as a survivor, I had well over half my games where the first person downed would disconnect, sometimes followed by the second disconnect.
---
At that point, the game is shot.  As a survivor, what do I do?  (I mean, I usually stay and lose, but what should I do?)
---
lol it happend to me too, my Feng had a Claudette head body
---
Don't stay on gens after she hooks someone, other than that idk, I rarely ever face beads spirits and when they use it I usually get caught once and then I just play more safe and rarely get grabbed a second time unless i fuckup or act greedy.
---
I've been singing "That's A(Mori)" every time a killer has one. No one ever laughs with me :(
---
We all know it doesn't work on killers past mid-rank killers. It's still funny to watch. 
---
I stop playing entirely because my brain decides it doesn't want to play the game when I get a better reward
---
Kate and spirit.
---
Lol I still don't know what it is. The dead by daylight community isn't the friendliest gaming community I've met tbh
---
Make Your Choice is amazing on hag. Personally i use MYC, Ruin, BBQ, M&amp;A
---
Or just add a casual mode
---
Too*
---
Certainly spiritual now.
---
I was like
---
Yeah , I got em  ?? 🤔
---
Survivors bring Dstrike: cancer
---
Killers bring NOED: cancer
---
People respect skill more and legion is the antithesis of skill, I love to play them though!! Feels better to lose to a nurse than it does to lose to cold dirt + frank's mix tape.
---
Sometimes I do a safe unhook but the guy I saved decided to run straight at the killer and just dies again so, it works on both side really, but whatever happens, survs loves blaming the killer for it, bigoof
---
Support like in "proper re-scaling of UI and everything else"? No, it doesn't. Even 16:9 but more than 1080p is not scaled properly.
---
He has more videos of dbd up on his channel and he also makes vid about it on his second channel. Has a twitch too cool guy.
---
This is wrong, nurse and legion ignore all game mechanics which is why they are bad game design. Even hag and huntress have control over loops. Yeah if you have a safe pallet, you're going to need to break it or play a killer with influence on loops.
---
Yeah, that’s what I was aiming at. Aim I doomed to play in a Windowed mode then? 
---
Because it lets me find them, heal them, especially in this Sloppy Butcher meta and keep them from doing something as stupid as Self Caring in the corner of the map for 44 seconds. 
---
Yeah it has, but I encountered someone who kept saying "enjoy the ban" while ignoring that.
---
1. It never even came to my mind he was farming. I figured he was trying to be some sort of flashlight/hook save superhero. I never checked his perks, so idk if he had We'll Make It or not.
---
2. The first time he unhooked, I was charging my chainsaw and faced the other direction. I figured if I tried to 360 turn, I would just fail miserably. 
---
3. The second time, my mind is "Oh, I guess I get a free kill, cool" and wanted to just get her down with a simple hit.
---
Say what you will about how that doesn't excuse it. I wasn't trying to be do anything scummy intentionally throughout the game except for when I camped the David at the end.
---
I mean, juggling is pretty easy when you learn how (as in, not fucking it up and having them get their DS off), but you're still going to eat it if there's no hook nearby. And unless you have Enduring, you can't always afford to take a DS and fuck up your momentum completely. You can't even with Enduring sometimes, since afaik, even Enduring 3 only reduces DS time by 55% not 75%. Fact is, unless they miss it, or get lucky with your hook placement 3x in one game(very rare), you have to deal with it. 
---
Same with NOED. At higher ranks, cleansing all the totems happens a lot more consistently, but it's still hard. Unless you're swf or your team gets lucky, you can 90% forget about cleansing all 5 totems at purple ranks or lower. It's how bad players get to red ranks, by running the cancer perk that is NOED, knowing that by applying some modicum of map pressure, they can prevent all 5 totems from being cleansed and guarantee an extra kill or two at the end. 
---
Both perks are crutch and suck ass. I'm a killer main and would argue that NOED is probably worse, but DS is still cheap. 
---
Can't say, never had 21:9 monitor myself. For higher resolutions you just have to deal with small UI.
---
Killer queen already touched that flashlight
---
I was literally in the same room, so...
---
The creator of the first ever 360, you live on in our hearts you legend.
---
This.
---
Effort 100
---
One of them is french, I am french as well but I have no idea what's he's trying to say, he's talking about you using a banner which makes you play like a "noob".
---
Even if they allow "open" lobbies for KYF, it won't be popular without BP and progress. And I doubt we'll see "casual mode" with everything enabled.
---
I'd go with BBQ
---
To preface: I don't think macros are legal lol
---
I'm unsure how to fix your wiggle issue but as for struggle, just move it to a different key. A lot of people use their scroll wheel rather than mash space.
---
Enduring doesn't counter DS in every situation, but it is a soft counter to DS. It can lead to a fast down in situations where you'd spend another 1-3 minutes sometimes getting looped, which is a lot of time. 
---
Welcome to Lisa’s Emporioum! We have Circlets, Necklaces, Bug Carcasses, Hands, Shoes, and plenty of shackles! Please stop by the Meat Section! Everything is guaranteed fresh! ❤️❤️❤️
---
I agree. Get that bloodpoint generator and eventually ruin will come back.
---
legit reason or not you ruined the fun of the game for them lmao i don’t give a fuck how many reasons you can give
---
I am gonna get it, but the Ebony Mori 😭😭😭😭😭
---
It doesn't devalue my point at all. Saying that being good at something shouldn't reward you is just stupid
---
I love coal tower. This in my opinion is the best map for me to have fun both as killer and survivor.
---
I really feel like Sloppy Butcher should just straight up be disabled on Wraith. Its such an abusable bug/exploit and its kinda annoying. It absolutely destroys your frames after getting hit a few times and it makes it impossible for you to hide. 
---
Whenever I get a new web I try to build up towards the two things I want most but make sure that when the entity appears I can get whatever perk I wanted at that time. Then go directly for a mori for example
---
Spend your bloodpoints! Or I'll continue to run Bond and bring the killer to your Urban Evading ass! I need my WGLF stacks!
---
I'm still holding out for a big Long War-style overhaul mod to be honest
---
Troll lol 
---
It's terrible design to remove those methods of escape by simply playing a character. 
---
Survivors have been nerfed a lot too you know and many methods of escape and chase avoiding are made much more difficult with the use of simple killer perks like Iron maiden or bamboozle
---
Save the Best for Last, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring, with Nancy's Masterpiece and Green Dress for the add-ons. I don't get looped for long with this build.
---
I just assume that gg is good game but a hard GG is for get good.
---
This is what a think if you'll indulge me: they had the chance to use the Scream IP but then they realized "Oh wait, we can't sell costumes and shit if we get another licensed character." So, once again, they motivated by how much money they could get rather than giving the fans something awesome. 
---
When I first saw the knife Legion uses I thought of the Scream series. 
---
Remember when Huntress mains were crying that they couldn't hit someone when they aimed 4 metres above. Aaaa. Good times
---
Bill has so much experience with those zombies that he doesn’t even need anyone
---
Guess we have different morals. I’d feel like a cunt if I’d camp and I don’t like being a cunt
---
try and get at least 2 gens done so you can get hatch really, it's all you can do if someone DCs at the start
---
Top tier
---
I can literally show you I bought this game yesterday if that’ll convince you I’m not a troll. So this community I’m guessing thinks everything is perfect?
---
Little underwhelmed by her schoolgirl look.
---
That could've been it. 
---
I bought legion even though I only play half as much killer as survivor just because they remind me of scream.
---
Do I have to beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker?
---
Spend whatever BP's and then start a new lobby. Sometimes you'll do well, others you won't.
---
That's the point. If that game would go through the roof, what do you think would happen to DBD? There's only so much the same group can do.
---
I give you 2 hints about what would happen. "Paragon" "Fortnite".
---
 
---
Didn't you know? The Huntress is supposed to have heat-seeking hatchets!
---
Im afraid i’ve met a *real man* Bobby
---
I always hate fighting hillbilly Not because he is op or anything, just because I hate the fact that I died to somebody that looks as dumb as he does.
---
Pretty sure killer ones are just more common no matter what
---
I'm down for Shaman Hag.
---
Maybe
---
Hyena doc 
---
Epic
---
I might be bias as a meg main but her giving up on her dreams to look after her sick mum makes her a sweetheart really ! 
---
The huntress is just really sad so I can’t get mad at her 
---
Also agreed for legion, despite everything I love that edgy teen murder cult lmao 
---
Actually this community is known for complaining about everything so
---
Also not sure why that guy thought you were a troll?
---
Anyway I'm not sure why your frame rate is suffering that much :(
---
Mine drops a little but not to the point of freezing. Are you sure it wasn't a latency issue?
---
Imma pretend I didn't read that.
---
I wouldn’t mind the spirit except for the fact that she tunnels just as hard as Freddy and Wraith :/.
---
Getting 0 is easy, just grind to 1 million and then spend them all
---
Ladies and gentlemen, this may be the first arguement to come to a peaceful end since 2016.
---
If you liked this montage then I've made some other DbD stuff on my channel [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDqItEHKH4HaV_cMsBP-hCw)
---
dear god the sweat
---
Was it legion? If so that’s understandable
---
That fucking slick as hell black, red &amp; gold one was exclusive to an in-game event. You can no longer get it.
---
The darker grey one was handed out to people at an event in Korea, I believe. So they are very limited, probably only a few hundred exist. No legit way to get it but you could try people selling codes online. That is sketchy as fuck though.
---
This map is the second leading cause of brain cancer in killers. It's why I run bamboozle on Spirit.
---
Well, this map and the lulz. 
---
That gas station has been a goldmine of fun.  
---
I saw a Myers that would stand there and if you tried leaving with an item he'd chase you, if he hit you you would drop it due to Franklins.  
---
Then there was a Pig who would crouch around and face/stop at the shelves all game.  Their name was "Looking For Drugs." 
---
that clip easly could have been 15s instead of 50 tho
---
&gt; while if you want to play competitive and boost your rank you can just go do that
---
Why would anyone do that when there are no bonuses for rank right now?
---
That’s a lota damage
---
I highly doubt Legion was originally meant to be a Killer with a disguise or whatever. That's shit is weak as hell.
---
Okay, how would you suggest balancing her? Not hostile, just curious if you have any ideas
---
\-Optional toggle to turn SWF off for killer lobbies, grant more BP for taking a SWF game
---
\-Perk Ban system (Killer / Survivors get to ban one or two perks for the other party)
---
\-Consider removal or rework of NoEd / DS
---
\-"Casual" games with no rank, no offerings
---
\-Rank 1 game BP bonuses
---
\-More ways for the killer to counter gen rushing other than Ruin (Perhaps adding an additional gen to spawn and do)
---
\-More ways for survivors to counter tunneling / camping
---
I lowered it from Ultra to high and it made no difference but haven’t tried lower than that. Still though I’ve played the new tomb raider which has beautiful and don’t suffer from any frame rate drops :(
---
I switch to a viable killer.
---
Shit usually happens cause I try to mix things up with a low tier killer and I get gen rushed. It's a nightmare to play as Freddy w/o Ruin (no pun intended) but I still do it from time to time. That is until my ass is inevitably handed to me, and I say fuck it and go back to playing either: Billy, Nurse, or Spirit.
---
I don’t know what nurses you go against but i wish I could loop a nurse LOL
---
I’ll try that today. Thanks!
---
SWFs don't even have to be good to break the game. Just have microphones.
---
Expanding bong
---
No the coldwind farm realm is at the current completed 5 maps per realm. I pray that they don’t extend the completed number just because I don’t want any more corn.
---
Yes but just by the way they did the advertisement with David getting stabbed because he thought he was with another survivor.
---
Nice edits
---
You are completely right.Imo anything over 2 blinks is just broken af.
---
Stop acting like your high and mighty. I was saying she wasnt good and you said i was unable to comprehend your joke which wasnt funny in the first place.
---
They're rare, but they happen. I've seen a few, got wrecked by one, 4k and 5 gens left. She just shredded us.
---
Nope, it was the Spirit
---
I wish there was a Dwaldo skin in dbd
---
“You’re on the list”
---
- TWoSLoRD
---
I mean her best set up is probably + 1 blink w/ no down side + ataxic respiration or just straight up omegablink.
---
what the fuck.
---
What are you talking about if they all get out the post game chat is more like “noob killer ha” “delete the game your soo bad” “gg ez” 
---
Same tbh
---
*M O R E C O R N*
---
Hag slugs by nature since you're kinda supposed to take every TP.
---
And then turns out everyone is a tryhard and plays prestige 3 nurse with Mori.
---
NO D;
---
Sucks 😭😭😭 they should bring it back haha 
---
Honestly, still understandable, would d/c with them  
---
Thats true but I wanted to get that roundabout song with the chase at the very beginning, show that I could have looped the killer for a lot longer had the asshole dwight not come in, and show how useless my teammates were during that chase.
---
stop
---
Do it! I'll just firecracker you! 
---
I mean, have you seen the panda in his streams?
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/TawdryGoodFlyBloodTrail
---
I just go play nurse tbh. With how broken this game can get it’s just nurse or nothing sometimes. And there’s no way I’m getting my butt kicked as nurse, she’s broke OP in the right hands.
---
Damn, are you rank 20?
---
But swf is not counterable right?What is this post op?Did you just photoshop?
---
In my experience, if all 4 survivors escape, someone is going to say "EZ PZ", or call me a shit killer.
---
i can't believe makoto nijima is fucking dead
---
&gt; Perk Ban system (Killer / Survivors get to ban one or two perks for the other party)
---
How'd this work for survivors? Voting system? What if 2 of them voted for Ruin and 2 for NOED? Also, with one perk ban, I'm pretty sure most games would be DS ban and one of those two killers perks... Would it make games more fun? Not sure.
---
&gt; "Casual" games with no rank, no offerings
---
So, no one who plays for fun is at red ranks games... How will this make r1 games more fun?
---
&gt; Rank 1 game BP bonuses
---
More BP = more fun?
---
&gt; More ways for survivors to counter tunneling / camping
---
Such as?
---
Sent ya a friend request, psn is dubsy99. I usually play killer but I could use some friends to do swf :)
---
That's not Spirit, that's stupid players. Especially the tunneling Freddys. Tunneling is literally the second worst way to play Freddy. Only thing he's worse at is camping.
---
The freezing makes me think that there might be something wrong with your computer, but you said it doesn’t happen in any other games, right?
---
She will sell you a purple flashlight with 1 second of use remaining.
---
&gt;Best for slowing the game down?
---
Hex:Ruin w/o a doubt. Sometimes it gets destroyed early on, but when it last... oh does it fucking put in work.
---
----------------------
---
As for other perks to look out for, BBQ and Chili is pretty meta not to mention the substantial gain in BP which significantly helps with the grind.
---
Clown is naturally good at forcing pallets down, so with your other 2 perks you could go for an Enduring (Billy teachable) + Spirit Fury (Spirit Teachable) combo or use Bamboozle and something else.
---
Is.. this a Myers and clown fan fiction...?
---
For the same reason in any game with a competitive mode to play competitively not everything needs some special reward 
---
You got me there
---
*vanishes like a ninja*
---
Anyone else absolutely hate the billy? It’s annoying and not even fun to play as or against. Maybe I’m just bad or salty but every time I spawn in and hear a chainsaw it’s takes everything in me not to dc and just suffer through the match. 
---
More McMotherfuckin Corn
---
I would use huntress more if framerate wasn’t dog shit(ps4).
---
Somewhat.  Everyone still has to "ping" to the server, wherever that may be.  If they have like 2 big ones in the US, that means LA and NY.  If you are central, you're going to get consistently 100-150 ping, but at least it's consistent.
---
Hm. Come to think of it, Lightbringer could be renamed to Talent (as it takes talent to hit the reaction checks - which I fucking lack sorely, sorry, teammates), Benevolent renamed to Charisma (as you're being to survivors and stuff, idek) and Evader to Nerve (it does take nerve to run around with a pissed-off Nurse on your ass), although Uniqueness won't work with Unbroken, sadly.
---
It kinda does, just because something scales with skill and is hard to master doesn't mean it's not overtuned. If the average nurse is 2k, Nurse is probably way overkill. This means the top end is all 4k, probably 80% of the time.
---
Derrr, You misunderstand. I have every perk, all that's left is bloody outfits, but once I get things to P3, I then perk them out, and sometimes getting the perk I want takes forever because I've unlocked all perks. 
---
WTF - who plays vs a doctor or legion?  You need to teach them a lesson - we won't play with you so fucking switch to something fun.
---
Haha I wish, games would be ez
---
Excluding licensed characters (Myers/Laurie would win) I would say Huntress for killers and Feng Min for survivors.
---
Dedication man 
---
It crops and zooms in iirc
---
But how would the killer lose in this mode?
---
You’re the only one that agrees lmao 
---
Nurse main here, 
---
A good nurse will never use more than 3 blinks and even then will rarely use 3. 5 blinks may seem like a lot but think of it this way
---
Each blink after the 2nd has a VERY short time for you to cast another before hitting fatigue, after the 3rd blink you have about half a second to correct your blink before you have to cast it. 
---
Once she has used her second blink, you need to run as unpredictably as possible because she has next to no time to aim and will most likely panic on the 4th and 5th blinks
---
&gt; It’s annoying and not even fun to play as
---
Not for me, as I play her more than any other killer.
---
No?
---
No they won’t. 
---
The game has no possible way of detecting that a macro is being used. 
---
OP, when you make your struggle macro, make it happen about every .4 seconds. Too slow and you’ll die, but too fast and the game won’t register it, and you’ll die. 
---
You can’t do a lunge attack you have to be right on them and a kill option will pop up. You’ll instantly Mori them without even having to down or hook them. 
---
What kinda lööps are you running man you’re abouta catch this bonesaw if you try looping me
---
I mean, Spirit really isn't that hard to play as. Especially with how hard it is to counter her.
---
Did you lunge?
---
From rank 20 to 3-5, clearly yeah. Most games outside of top ranks have the killer getting at least two kills and the winrate of survivors being way below 1. 
---
Survivors are only more powerful than killers when they reach their skill ceiling and start being able to reliably loop killers for a few gens.
---
Hanzo arrow flashbacks
---
Really cool. 
---
Lol really? Why isnt that said on the thing itself. Wasted 7k bp for nothing and everybody escaped. Bullshit.
---
Were they interacting with something when you attacked, that's the counter to those addons 
---
it’s very opinionated on my side lol but it’s just a game at the end of the day
---
That’s super cool
---
The hitboxes have been shit, then they made them accurate, and everyone freaked out.
---
If you didn't know, they're pill shaped, so they reach out further than need be. ***Of course, ping doesn't help***. 
---
They made them a rectangle around the hatchet, and everyone freaked out saying "they broke huntresses' hatchet hitboxes", when infact they were more fair to the survivors, since they would not be BS hit when they shouldn't have been.
---
I think, yes.
---
Im currently leveling him up... 
---
No just running away.
---
To anyone that actually played in the deathgarden beta or early release should know from the dev's twitter and emails, deathgarden was effectively being cancelled and reworked into an entirely new game. They weren't happy with the end result, and didn't get a high enough response to make continuing with the project a valid course of action. They simply decided to focus their manpower on creating a better game than trying to fix a broken one.
---
Yeah I was hoping it didn’t seem too tacky lol 
---
Being good at something doesn’t mean you should have an advantage. Your advantage should purely be from your skill, not your character, especially in a PVP game. 
---
Her to shout STUN after spirit fury is activated?
---
Monitor and Abuse is a must for hag! Along with BBQ/Ruin. Haunted ground is fun with her too. 
---
I think so, I mean I accidentally inverted my controls yesterday so I’d say it works 😅
---
It doesnt work with that. You need to be near survivor and just tap m1
---
No, you can't turn it off, lol. Part of what makes Huntress balanced *is* her song. It makes it impossible for the Huntress to be stealthy, because it'd be broken if she could be via perks and such while still remaining a ranged killer.
---
M1 bitch Best fucking thing I heard in a while lol
---
The obsession condition makes it already balanced around more than one survivor having it tho, so your post is just baseless cynicism.
---
I mean, a lot of people have trouble playing killer. But if you want noted to go off, don’t have another totem, or if you are, only put on ruin or one other  hex totem
---
Update: the shop on Etsy is “KOcustomcreations”
---
Don't have a favourite, but I hate legion's lore. Really doesn't feel like they're very evil at all, just some stupid teens that made a big mistake. Compared to some real sickos like Freddy, Clown, and Myers, they just seem so lame.
---
Make Your Choice on Hag is brutal
---
I actually love her, even if I main survivor.
---
I would use Make your choice and enduring.
---
Make your choice, sloppy, or M&amp;A abuse would probably work best
---
You aren't good though.
---
My question is how she didn't see the blood trail, lol.
---
What are the changes?
---
If I recall correctly I think he complained about my chainsaw as well. 
---
I feel like he just wants me to not hit him.
---
What do you mean? Where in the game itself does it state how it works?
---
Its not holding your hand when its information portraying literally how the add on works. Pretty essential information to give to the user.
---
I just wish when you were removing a trap the timer didn’t go down. Besides that she’s alright. 
---
Gotcha, in that case idk because I never use it for anything other than accidentally hitting it lol 
---
Remove the hatch mechanic and nuke hyper immersed players from this game please. 
---
UglyBetsy no, *N O   M O R E   C O R N !*
---
SWF.
---
I share your burning hatred for the pig. When I get into a game I’m screaming for half the match and the other I’m trying to get a trap off my head.
---
This was fucking great 
---
The old squad days before all these skin docs and store came about.
---
i dont even get mad anymore. sometimes its the map, the killer youre playing, the survivors skill or everything combined and there isnt much you can  do about it.
---
I’m deleting this app
---
Does it seem to happen randomly, or when certain things happen? Like hitting or booking a survivor, when totems break, picking up items, or when you get status effects?
---
Also really odd question, but is your game set to English? I did some light google work, and and it seems like some people have had this issue while playing the game in another language. Switching it to English seemed to fix it. I have no idea if it’s the same as your problem, but it’s an idea. 
---
I like her humming. I don’t like the noise she makes when stunned by like a pallet or something. Don’t know why just don’t like it. 
---
The reason they were pill shaped to begi with is because certain parts of a survivors model had no hitbox. 
---
When they changed them to be smaller it lead to then clipping straight through survivors during certain animations like vaults. The trade off was that it also made them less likely to hit invisible walls
---
Nurse is due for a rework after Freddy is, according to McLean. I'd expect her to have 1 blink.

So this is what My Chemical Romance are up to these days. 
---
I think an abandoned amusement park map would be cool BUT I want more of the red forest tbh it’s my favorite 
---
It’ll help but will never be perfect. Dedis don’t magically make your ping zero but makes it so that the killer doesn’t have a massive ping advantage. Right now you should always assume that you are actually behind where you think you are because according to the server, which is the killer, you haven’t been updated to your current position. 
---
I mean... this game is meant to be an asymmetrical 4v1 horror game, with the 1 being the power role, not the 4.
---
Not happening 
---
You must be fun at parties... TTV BTW HEHE
---
A couple of days ago I was in a game with 3 randoms, 2 of them being SWF and the other being a random. One of the swfs went down by the billy within the first minute so he DCd, then his friend did shortly after.  Me and the last person were able to get 2 gens done, but I got downed and so did they, but once they were put  on the hook, they  DCd, so the billy just picked me up and carried me to the hatch. I thanked him afterwards because he could've just hooked me but was nice to give me hatch escape.
---
First, you did not supply evidence that the use of voice communications is cheating. I play other co-op games that don't have voice communications built into them, but it's not cheating to use them. You have absolutely no basis for this claim.
---
Also, who's to say it won't be part of the game once Dedicated Servers come out? 
---
Personally, I doubt it. Why create a voice system when all gamers know just to use Discord because it's way easier? It would be a waste of their time and money to create. 
---
There’s a huge war between survivors and killers on this sub lol
---
So I play the killer with the bell that makes him go invisible. Today I was behind someone and started to ring the bell and it froze for half a second. Other times I’ll be chasing someone and it’ll happen. I’m not sure if it happens when I’m walking around looking for people. I’ll have to keep an eye out for it better in those cases. 
---
Yes it’s set to English.
---
think it was only for preorders
---
&gt;Especially with how hard it is to counter her
---
Iron Will. Urban Evasion. Lightweight. It's stupid easy to counter her.
---
So like 90% of survivor outfits
---
How can I unsee this
---
I realized that after i posted the reply 😂😂 my bad. And yes, the memes will be much realness.
---
What would you do if deranking was removed? I think most people would play in red vs leave.
---
“Fucking camper kys”
---
Well I wouldn’t be camping if all 3 of you weren’t hard pushing the hook.
---
Ew

Killer's Power: That's How Mafia Works

Reddit Cliches have been observed by this bot 6595 times.

Doesn't matter if its unnecessary. Is there anything that is clearly better? If you played one dbd match for million euros, would you use it? 
---
I could say the same thanks
---
The resources required to shift through open report system like that is immense. At best they can implement a system which automatically deals out punishments after EXTRAORDINARY amount of reports has been received for a player. In some extreme cases where the user actually provides video evidence they MIGHT do something but most likely not. I doubt they record the matches or have logs of the chats. Its all there "to calm the customers" but it doesn't do anything. There are studies about customer satisfaction and it is shown that it goes up if people are given the illusion of channel for complaints. In reality the complaints are almost always dismissed unless there is very large volume of them.
---
1) Something like that.  You'd have to take turns in the vein of MoBAs - They get first ban then they see the killer doesn't want "We'll make it,"  Now they can think about "Hmm, is he going for anti heal? Should we ban sloppy?"  Etc.  
---
2) It wouldn't directly, but enable those who DON'T have fun there another option - so those that are left are content with it anyway,
---
3) Yes, BP takes some of the sting.
---
4) I don't know, I'm just a dude on the internet.  If I worked for them full time I'd have more to present.  It's just an issue for the survivors, I know.  
---
Say gg and maybe have a chat with the survivors, if they're spewing toxic remarks in the postgame though I just leave.
---
Not as far as I know, but I fear that it may very well be a total overhaul.
---
Small Game is nice. Also it helps me against trapper because I'm blind as shit, so I can look ahead of me and tell if I'm about to walk into a really obvious trap.
---
You ok?
---
Oof. You’ve seen em? :0
---
Just fix gens and leave when that happens no big deal.
---
No problem! Hope to see you around 
---
Can someone please explain what is so bad about rank reset since they updated it?
---
Everyone is reset which means those rank 1's you were fighting yesterday are still going to be the rank 10 you're fighting today. People get matches full of idiots and then say "well that's rank reset" and no it isn't. Newsflash, people can always be idiots and you can still get matches that feel like "rank reset" while everyone at rank 1.
---
I get its a meme and but its no where near as bad as the days when everyone was pretty much sent back to 15-20 ranks.
---
I'm not them but I don't think they're telling you that you're bad because you were patrolling. Based on what you said they're telling you that you're bad because out of 4 people you only managed to get one person down the whole time they were fucking with you instead of playing the game. 
---
The only thing you can do is get better at the game or the survivors will abuse you. I'll be honest, after the majority of the game with half decent killers the game is boring for survivor. If I can spend my time abusing the killer it breaks up the gen repair simulator monotony of every match.
---
People who only play killer won't understand this. People who only play survivor tend to get a little bored of the same shit every match unless they go out of their way to be completely annoying the entire match.
---
I love him
---
Yep that's what we did. Just thought it was funny. 
---
Not sure how losing makes the winner a noob 
---
Don't care and move on?
---
Then Dwight would just juke again, the killer didn't seem very good in the first place, either not hearing Dwight or not even noticing the blood.
---
*does gen*
---
IM BEING GEN RUSHED - some killers i think
---
I never said anything about other killer mains, did I? I was referring to survivors quitting if they nerfed SWF.
---
Lobby changes don't mean anything, I can open peoples profiles and check their friend lists.
---
It's not your fault that the David was an asshole you were just playing the game, you didn't do anything wrong this other guy is just a knob head 
---
Oh look! It’s the entire 4 Quentin mains in existence!
---
Hangman's drops it to 30 and then sabo adds on to that 30, so 60 seconds at rank 3
---
Yeah she didn't play them well, but I wouldn't say she's one of the best to punish these. If she's got a couple of hatchets then sure, just gotta hit the hatchets when you get close. The 110% movement speed is brutal if not though. 
---
XD
---
I feel like he's just disagreeing with the fact that you seem to think it's scummy for a killer to complete their objective (kill survivors)
---
That’s stupid
---
Well no. At R10 you get killers from R10-16
---
r/KarmaRoulette
---
I don't think about making rank 1 fun (I don't see a difference between rank 1 and rank 12 games tbh), but I think its more about having a reason to achieve and hold ranks before a reset. Give us iridescent shards depending on rank at reset!
---
Had this happen last night against the Huntress. We were all like WTF is going on. 90% of the hatchets missed yet somehow hit us at the same time. I watched one wiz past me hit a tree in front of me and even made the sound of contact against the tree but I also somehow got hit. My friend who was close by was like wtf hit you the hatchet missed. I was like yep I know. It happened all game against her. We were not sure if it was just lag or if the hitbox was fucked. 
---
Shouldn't it be flashlight beam? Overall good stuff
---
Fun is not subjective. What you enjoy is subjective. Either way, I speak for all players when I say that hook camping is a cheap strategy as well as borderline unfair. It's already almost impossible to unhook oneself, and if one can't get rescued, it's painful just waiting to die while the killer sits in front of you with his thumb up his ass.
---
But I guess as with any cheap strategy, snotty assholes will just ignore all complaints and say "it's part of the game, dur hur"
---
Sigh but thank you! 
---
Nah, don't worry, I'm having pretty good time with this game, I know that there are bad games from time to time etc. but I just needed to rant, since I didn't want to give them the pleasure of disconnect. 
---
Also having the same problem. I'm on ps4, yourself? 
---
Sometimes it takes me and friends 30-45 mins for a 4 man. It hurts.
---
But I mean the killers ranks reset too so they'll be right where you are.
---
Thank you!
---
Ya got any of them girly magazines?
---
They need to make it so its actually a challenge to hit rank 1 and make there be a reward for rank 1
---
Just keep restarting the lobby every 5 mins and superstition says to not fuck with your inventory and immediately ready up when everyone's loaded into the lobby. Lol. 
---
There is a "width" of the ranks you can get matched with. With rank reset it is essentially bigger considering 20 ranks go back to 10. It causes you to face players with different skill set.
---
When when I lose they say “gg ez” not gg good game lol 
---
Yeah I thought they stopped doing that then it happened to me Friday!
---
Hahaha that sounds funny for like the first ten seconds
---
We’re hitting autism levels that shouldn’t be possible
---
for me i don‘t mind playing against a good nurse... but the really annoying part is when a nurse uses noed / mori / ruin with toth or just “soft patrols“.
---
Knock Out and Monitor &amp; Abuse. You know you can check all killer perks on the Internet, don't you?
---
i like using sloppy butcher on wraith but always feel like shit when i do because of this bug. really hope they'll patch it out asap.
---
fleshy i like it
---
It’s still a 40 second hook resplendent for sabo and 10 for sacrifice so if you want to run it still counters sabo by a lot
---
scratched mirror meyers near the gen your working on.
---
??
---
Respectfully have to disagree. I've got more time as survivor and getting camped doesn't bother me as long as we get a team win. This is only my side game for fun though so I don't mind NOED, DS, or camping.
---
Im liking this meme
---
Nobody says he is op, he is just boring af and removes the interesting gameplay part of DBD which are chases.
---
Did a 3 year-old stick these on? 
---
How do i delet my visual memory
---
Yeah but the chances of getting baby killers is much higher. Especially if you do SWF with someone at like R19. Of course you will run into the R1 killers too.
---
I said it once and I'll said it agian: If you want to buff the Wraith effectively, you just need to make him able to land 1 hit before automatically returning into his normal form... 
---
He could cloak himself with the bell like usual by becoming visible again by either using the bell a second time OR hitting someone (note that even a missed hit will de-cloak him for obvious reasons).
---
I only play nurse, so this doesn't happen  
---
\*weird flex but ok\*
---
The after game flame is what makes this game good
---
My boyfriends 25 but if you know any guys that don’t act like toddlers lemme know
---
But really the only ones that are messed up are the ones around the joysticks don’t be rude 
---
Can someone explain to me exactly how Sole Survivor works?
---
Eww.
---
That's not what I said
---
Maybe they could run it like BBQ's and Chilli, if your far away you get a good indicator but when you're close and might accidentally stumble into the killer.
---
I just wanna see Facecamping punished cause its an aspect of the game I don't like.
---
Kindred is fine; but it relies on my teammates having it and specifically I never see it in Pub matches which is where is probably needed most. I think one of the hardest aspects of Pub matches is both being a good teammate and rescuing people from the hook but also someone NEEDS to be working on generators 
---
Get close to a survivor and keep M1 pressed as you would to unhook someone
---
I was under the impression when a hook is used for a sacrifice that hook never comes back. Does it with HT?
---
It kicks the trash down
---
Hhhheheheh! Wwwelcome! Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger!
---
Yup in 10 seconds
---
Exactly, that's what happens when you try to play a bit casual against the P3 last second flashlight switching SWF.
---
Use the boyfriend's memo thing or w/e that gives you extra lunge in t1 with scratched mirror always
---
So to recap: You can't find any explicit statement by Behaviour Interactive or any devs that explicitly state Voice Communication is cheating or a bannable offense. 
---
Have you read the list of bannable offenses? Because voice communication isn't listed there, and it never will be. They'd have to ban most of the play base, and nobody would play anymore. 
---
Furthermore, it was beyond obvious that when they created SWF, that people were going to start using voice chat via third part software. They did nothing, nor will they ever do anything, to prevent that. 
---
I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but swallow it you will. 
---
Its all due to your connection as host to other players. Original Gears of War had this same issue with the shotgun.
---
So, just run Windstorm and cloak and hit someone, then recloak and go hit them again with your 150% movespeed. Sounds fair.
---
Saying you’re rank 1 doesn’t have anything to do with skill. All you’re telling me is is that you have no life and you spend all your time on this game
---
I dont like an event where one side has a disadventage :)
---
Less than that, hit hit 3 seconds for power hit.
---
My bad that I predicted what was going to happen and I’m right anyways
---
That’s more on the player then the L t walls though 
---
I've never seen that much toxic killers in the end game chat. Happened but mostly if they are triggered or anything they just leave instantly. The toxic killers are toxic in their gameplay but less in the chat I'd say.
---
Or maybe he wants someone’s opinion. Newer players ask all the time here if they’re an asshole for defending a hook when survivors are hook diving, and the answer to that is no, 1000x no.
---
Thanks TIL

They keep chat log if you report the player, if you don't the chat log isn't saved.
---
4 paper bags for their heads please
---
I just booted this game up after a break (after reminiscing on my first convention experience and how I got a game key from one of the team members) and everything is all new and improved! Its fantastic to see the love and effort put into this game end up so well!
---
You implied it did. You said that to add to your “credibility” that you’re actually a killer main as well. Don’t be a pussy and back down from your own statement.
---
Yeah from my experience it goes Nea&gt;Claudette&gt;Dwight&gt;Meg&gt;Rest when it comes to likelihood of Dstrike.
---
Thanks. 
---
I've had 4K's on almost every map with this build. Lurking around the edge of the map and attacking survivors from unexpected directions works regardless of where the Entity sends you.
---
Ironically you are one, cunt.

You're right, I should just run in a straight line and hope she doesn't catch up to me so I can be as good as a professional dead by daylight gamer like you and not an autist that uses windows and pallets. 
---
The stickers are r/mildlyinfuriating
---
I enjoyed this game a whole lot and it's a pain that it died so fast... apparently they're going to change all of it? I have no clue. It's early access yet. But it was funny to see how they were saying "this game is going to kill DBD", poor things they always think they can kill this game.
---
Have you read her lore or looked up the lyrics of the song she is humming? Might change how you feel. And she grunts and throws fits because she still has a child like mind, she raised herself.
---
"Im just lookin baby! Aint no harm in that! Ooh i like how you be bouncin up an down like that! You ever been mori'd by a man in a jump suit?"

- Sexual Myers
---
I'm honestly beyond shocked when Laurie isn't the obession, yet alone doesn't run DS.
---
luck is by far the most useless mechanic in the game.  *it doesnt even affect chests*
---
Considering the base chance is 4% you could technically consider 3% a considerable increase since your nearly doubling it. 
---
Only the joystick stickers are bad !! My boyfriend put them on I didn’t do it 
---
Give him a light smack.
---
I played with you several days ago! Me and my boyfriend thought your name was great, lmao! ❤️
---
LMAO. And straight to the strawman because you know you have no valid counter argument otherwise. Go away troll.
---
Awesome I got a skeleton Key with add ons and a Purple Flashlight in 50% discount "at Hag's"
---
I Give her 4 stars because she needs to improve her personal, I get scared everytime they appear
---
how did you get where did they go? 
---
No I don’t wanna make him feel bad 😔 
---
imagine her running discordance and new surveillance?
---
yank city, bitch
---
Btw I tried setting VSync to adaptive and Off; both made no difference.
---
Spirit, Clown, Doctor.
---
That would be a cool map concept
---
Yestrday I had like 8 nurse matches, I dont DC but man I lost the will to play. There was nothing I could do when she finds me 0 chance of survival. Speaking of rank 1 btw
---
Nurse&gt;SWF tenfold. Anyways, nobody said that SWF is what the game is balanced around. 
---
I feel really bad when I accidentally hit the hooked one instead of the unhooker. 
---
You're certainly not alone, that much I can tell you for sure.
---
I figured as much, but I sadly don't have Legion yet.
---
Total Overhaul would be a massive disappointment.  I'm personally hoping for numbers tweaking like they did for Hag to be honest.
---
I actually think its kinda calming when you're running around stressing about what survivors are doing, but I understand that not everyone feels the same
---
You don't chuckle at her stun tantrums though? D:
---
Hangman’s Trick at 3 drops it to 10, not 30.
---
I play with three other friends we almost never survive as a 4 man swf. Should say how amazing we are (sarcasm). We usually make it to red rank long before the reset, it feels too easy to advance.
---
It’s kind of hard to balance a killer that doesn’t play the same game as everyone else lol. 
---
Today has been awful. I dont even know why I bother playing, its not fun. Teammates are less useful than a potato.
---
I mean for all we know, Bubba could’ve taught her a thing or two. Maybe he’s a great teacher! :D I mean he has a daughter~
---
5 blinks isn’t OP, it’s terrible. No competent nurse is going to have more than 3. 2 is optimal.
---
Stop being afraid of getting free hits on survivors or run Mad Grit
---
It takes 32 seconds for a survivor to heal without a medkit. 32 with self care or 2 survivors both wasting 16 seconds to heal.
---
She disappeared....
---
.... Or was she ever even there?
---
For killers with steath abilities, I would recommend the pig or shape. The shape has a very small terror radius thoughout both Evil within 1 and 2 with a built in exposed effect at Evil within 3 that you can pop at will if things are not working out for you. Additionally, he has addons that can facilitate a pure stealth build. Additionally, many of his perks are obsessed based with save the best for last probably being the best overall.
---
The pig has the innate crouch ability allowing her to remove her terror radius during the crouch and for a few seconds after crouching. Can also ambush which is nice on occasion. 
---
Perk wise monitor and abuse to reduce your terror radius outside of a chase by 8m which helps significantly in sneaking closer to survivors. Couple this with the shapes Evil within 1 will entirely remove his terror radius.
---
Insidious removes your terror radius with the expense that you cant move. Not the best perk for stealth unless your trying to mind game survivors or camp them. 
---
thats a bummer aint it
---
lmao just camp pallets! amazing counterplay to a killer who will respect them as hard as possible
---
I'm slowly getting there myself
---
wait are you in the Dead by daylight amino
---
how do you know thats exactly what they're doing
---
Why is griefing even a category for reports if all forms of griefing reports are discarded?
---
Yes. I just recently joined to check it out since a friend told me to :3
---
Life is not an escape
---
Does something cool happen on the 13th . I’m working all night tonight and can’t check 
---
you said what I said but said it better, fully agree with you.
---
That’s just called using your phone as a hotspot then playing wraith with sloppy butcher. 
---
She has become electricity
---
I've seen your cosplays on there 
---
Huntress and Freddy, because their lullabies get stuck in my head.
---
No but seriously Legion, can't forget Legion, because being slashed into pieces is really annoying. Either you don't get found and you might survive, or you get found and you are done. 
---
since when is that a thing
---
Or it's a Seperation Shroud. 
---
Sweet c:  only uploaded one about my piggy and one of my two legions each so far~
---
From my experience, League of Legends is still more toxic, but I haven't played it for quite a long time, things might've changed. 
---
Wait doesnt that spoon add on keep you tier 1?
---
Left them to rot! Lol
---
It might have been lol. I got it off of google:)
---
Huntress would be way higher on my "How Fun it is to play against" tier list if her hatchet hitboxes made any fucking sense whatsoever
---
Be considerate of how sometimes hatchets that should've hit, miss. It goes both ways. 
---
Have you guys thought that maybe you arent great at baiting and juking?
---
going down to home depot for a pair of wire cutters, y'all want anything?
---
I'm all for rounding up P3 Claudettes that run Urban Evasion and putting them in a camp tbh. I'm not even talking from a killer players viewpoint either I legitimately can't stand having these people as teammates.
---
I never inferred you should let the guy win. I'm saying you're not fucking good for looping two windows right next to each other. I would guess that if the Killer used Bamboozle to take that bullshit away from you that you'd cry how unfair it is. 
---
If legion hit someone already injured with frenzy it would already decrease the deep wound timer by 30% and self care would have let you heal at 75% but heal others at 75% too.
---
I just try to have fun with the game, man. I really enjoy it and don’t tend to take it too seriously. Props to the Dwight!
---
I think its only fixed on PTB
---
It just means you are doing it right!
---
F
---
LMAO. And you're **still** doing it. I'm not even sure you realize it, which is even sadder.
---
Kinda hard to answer properly without context.
---
Did they just leave straight away?
---
Was the killer just standing by the hook and made no attempt to hit the other survivors? 
---
How close was the hook to the exit gate?
---
Probably not, survivors are still going to have ping, whether it be 80ms or 300ms, but so will the killer
---
So basically, if this is caused by the survivors latency, then no, it will be the same, but if it's from the killers bad internet, then yes it will be fixed
---
At ease 
---
They saw that I was hooked, one left immediately, the other waited a second or two more and then left and the third waited a full other minute before leaving. They were halfway across the map from me on the hook and the killer was headed for the door. 
---
Could it be that the hitbox is ur camera view? 😂
---
Tinkerer plus some range addons. How I got it at least. Although, I got it before the Legion update fucked up grabs
---
From the title I was thinking he would be running bamboozle and you would have gotten smacked
---
I just assume that
---
I mean, everyone seems to fight tooth and nail to get an edge in the game, so what if killers do it too?
---
"What're ya buyin?"
---
"Not enough cash, stranger!"
---
"What're ya sellin?"
---
"Ah! I'll buy it at a high price!"

Agreed my man glad to see some one else can have fun and not take everything seriously

Patch Update "New Hex Totems put 57% more FUN into match"
---
Gears fan here and I don't want to talk about it.
---
Because nothing got done? It's not hard to notice zero generator progress in 20 minutes.
---
1. not many builds have Enduring.  
---
2. many people are not that bright
---
I like to imagine that they mean “killer of noobs” instead of “killer who is a noob” when someone says Noob Killer.
---
??? It's not "being afraid of getting free hits" lmao, what kind of thinking is that? It's not wanting survivors being little shits and bodyblocking hooks one after the other.
---
The issue the dude has is brand new parts now only get what 15 or 25% max if you use them. Do moris only kill the survivor 25%? That's not going both ways.
---
Why do people hate camping and tunneling 
---
Why would I leave someone on a hook when I know that as soon as I leave they get unhooked it when I tunnel someone who isn’t good at escaping predators go after easy prey first don’t they
---
You're completely missing the point.
---
Had two fkin survivors laggin so badit was like they were dead harding all over the place.
---
Doc isn't bad. He's just another killer(like Freddy) that requires either bad survivors or a good build to be viable. Unnerving, Ruin, Distressing, and BBQ on Doc with 2 Calm add-ons makes him a nightmare to deal with. Same with Freddy if you run SF/Enduring/Ruin/BBQ, with some kind of add-ons that affect dream transition.
---
But better killers don't have to depend on add-ons, which is the point. Myers, Spirit, Billy, Huntress if you can aim, Nurse on PC...
---
Killers and Survivors alike will fight tooth and nail to get an edge in the game, that's never going away.
---
@Not_Queen could you guys please do something about Davids cosmetics the majority does not work with shirtless and I wasted my money on the new punk jeans for david and also his rowdy pants.
---
Wouldnt that make the offering useless? Lol
---
I will laught if bhvr does it, it will work like the broken key you find it but it has no bulb or batteries you have to add them after the trial as addons
---
No? You can hook someone 3 times.
---
Most of your points are that "you don't understand callouts" lol. What a stupid thing to say. My entire OP is about watching people make callouts, and I document how they use them.
---
You just want to find a way to say that the issues I raised aren't real, and you'll find any semantic contortion you can to push that idea.
---
It gives you a notification if you're looking at a totem from a certain distance 
---
&gt; survivor hex
---
I think you are onto something right here
---
They tried to let me do 2 gens to escape, but since there was Ruin it would’ve taken ages. I went to go find the totem, but they just grabbed me and plopped me on a hook. Can’t blame them but I’m still sad that I depipped without a chance 
---
Spine Chill says hi
---
just cheat 4Head

No, I dont play legion, but I dont normally get downer by them. If you go down in less than 3 seconds against legion, your either bad, or standing still.

Whenever I down someone with a bs hatchet I leave them
---
I can tell you guys right now that urban only helps a little bit . But after the experience and time I have , I expect that perk now . So it really does nothing against me . Especially when people do it in front of me in plain sight and then call me a tunneler when it's their fault . 
---
Lightweight honestly does nothing either . Garbo perk . 
---
go back two tumblr lttle k1d! gg
---
Meh considering how fast gens get done and how easy skill checks are I don’t have an issue with it. The killer is still not getting a kill in the time it takes 3 gens to finish even without a brand new part unless the survivors are making really bad decisions which is pretty common. How many times do you go back and watch a rank 1 vid and the survivors are doing dumb shit like 2 or 3 ppl running around teasing him instead of doin gens. Then turn around and complain he was camping the hook with them there the entire time. 
---
Monitor and Abuse and Nurses Calling are the must have perks.
---
MYC, Knockout are good.
---
I really want to run haunted ground for the lols. 
---
Is that game even a thing any more? Kind of stopped paying attention to it after the dev began releasing more 30 minute rants on community stuff than anything regarding further development.
---
Ah you also suffer from a reading disability, it takes 3 seconds to charge it
---
And for realism, wearing the hair should make you permanently blind in game.
---
Dbd in a nutshell
---
This. 
---
Always get this, I could kill three survivors, last one is one death hook escapes and I get spammed with exactly this.
---
Same here, its such a wasted slot for me so i rather use any other perk
---
Nice job jumping straight to insults instead of actually arguing. I misread, but 3 seconds is plenty of time to get ahead and away, especially with the speed boost from being hit.
---
Why should I argue a strawman? It's not the point I was making, so it's irrelevant.
---
Legion’s lore reads exactly like an edgy creepypasta a 14 year old girl wrote like Jeff the Killer.
---
I escape like 40% of the time and am a mediocre looper an even I get r1 before reset. I wish they'd do a rank rework. Make either pip gain threshold higher, or do more negative pip options, or just remove the safety pip. 
---
it takes 3 seconds to charge the power with cold dirt to get back there, are you sure you're not just ignorant
---
I hate Sole Survivor when I can't find my last slug with Deerstalker :(
---
Did you even read what i said? I’m a killer main dumbass. I’m just not a sweaty asshole like you obviously are. There are no rules for dbd, i just like to have fun and i want others to have fun as well. Fuck off with your toxic bullshit.
---
Only if you make sure to cancel the lobby anytime four survivors spawn in together.
---
Better perks: Spirit Fury, Make your choice, Haunted grounds, Ruin, Enduring, Devour Hope, Save the best for last, BBQ and Chili, Blood warden, Discordance...
---
In a match for a million euros I would use any 4 of the above, because the survivors wouldn't get more than 3 gens done against me perk less.
---
Noed either does nothing for good killers, because gens don't get finished, or helps killers that have already lost get a kill or 2, but only if totems are not left up.
---
In a money game, survivors will do the totems, and you would be a noob to think otherwise. 
---
Removed along wither other comments, be civil you guys.
---
You can search all four boxes before the timer goes off. Maybe you're just taking an suboptimal route to each box and wasting time? 
---
well susies mask should also keep you permanently blind, where tf are the eye holes?
---
“No get off,” 
---
Now*
---
Running the perk isn’t smart. The moment you use it then everyone will just stop and that perk slot is wasted. Just like that locker perk. Once someone enters a locker and sees it then poof nobody will touch them.Killers already have so many situational perks. A good amount can be easily countered with simple game mechanics. 
---
Those Clapper buffs, tho!
---
Mediocre you say tell me your secrets! 
---
They're pretty worthless now. I wouldn't mind if it just auto did like 20% or 25% of the gen something to actually help.
---
*uses Insidious to stealth on survivors*
---
Survivor - “you fucking camper!”
---
Or they're going to waste frenzy and not down anyone If you down juke them right. You absolutely can juke him. Again, annoying, not op.
---
As a killer main, these games usually make me crack up laughing.
---
But whats the point of that? Isnt it better to just let myers get tier 3 amd win that way?
---
Fuck know, I hope the mori felt good. There’s no excuse for the shit talking, people should be more careful.
---
I guess it depends on your rank but most maps you will get looped around once they realize its a SM myers and just sit on the open
---
Stopped reading at the part where you think worry wart is an insult.
---
Nope
---
What you said is basically the same concept as the legions feral frenzy. The deep wounds 99'ing makes it have less of a killing/downing ability
---
I had 3 survivors DC in one of my matches within 1 minute
---
rank reset is pure cancer
---
What's best is when you don't run DS, and the killer picks you up and drops you to get you to the hook, not knowing he's filling your wiggle gauge XD
---
Stealth mode ACTIVATE

**The Spirit:**

There's nothing in particular that I love about this build - it's just an all-around workhorse that I've relied on more times than I care to count.
---
Killer mains acting like small game is a viable perk. 
---
Mad grits a waste of time. Sure you may get one smack out of it and then everyone knows you wasted a perk slot and just hit the gens and do saves as normal while the killer wastes a slot the survivors can counter by just playing the game normally
---
Where did anyone say it was OP, you really need to work on your reading comprehension skills, some of the worst I've ever seen. Explain how you can juke Legion when he can vault pallets/windows. Legion is bad game design, the same as nurse as both completely render game mechanics useless by ignoring them. If you'd like I can down you 10 times in 15 seconds with those add ons buddy boy, let's test it right now
---
But then u hatchet 1 and grab him and face camp hook him for the ez kill lol 
---
I dunno what kind of killers you've been facing then 😭
---
Finally someone else gets the fact that they can’t patch in fun 
---
If you hate NOED small game is a amazing counter i always use it 
---
Was it was a huntress on blood lodge? 
---
Only reason why so many people play him. Real LF mains are very rare.
---
All kinds.
---
You were born in 1999. So what do you do when you're a killer? Just let the survivors T-bag you? Lol nice.
---
Killer means KILLING.
---
For one, cant test it right now. If you drop a pallet on them it wastes frenzy and stuns them. They are poorly designed, but they can be countered. And implying they cant be countered is implying they're op. And there you go again saying he can down someone trying in under 3 seconds. It's like you've never even played against him.
---
But why not?
---
Don't get me wrong, I hate them too, but where is the incensitve not to be? take a flashlight it keeps you safe, take DS it's a free escape without even earning it, and if you come across someone whos better than you? just D/C that way you don't lose, and you get to stay low rank and bully the "baby killers".
---
The fault lies with the developers. People will play like this because people are cunts, but there's no incentive not to other than human decency but some people just don't care about that in games or online. The devs need to do more to tackle it.
---
Remove DS because it's OP as hell. Do more about disconnects. Stop last second lobby switching. Buff the weaker killers. You don't see people like this as top ranks against Nurse.
---
Hillbilly + Claudette + Wraith = "where are they"
---
~~let's add Freddy to this~~
---
If they t bag, let them, i try not to let it bother me. What does my age have to do with anything?
---
The real "DBD killer" was the currently-sitting-at-450-players-on-average Friday the 13th: The Game.
---
DBD Killer, my ass.
---
if we got another licensed killer it better be Pinhead or Ghostface.
---
I struggle too, especially after the recent engine update. I've seen many people agree the corn is too much now. The devs need to get off their ass and adjust it.
