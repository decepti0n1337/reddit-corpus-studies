I would be extremely on board for a graphics and sound overhaul. Not sure if it would be great for performance though
---
---
---
It'd be a disaster. I want gameplay diversity, too, but at this point, creating any passive would just make the best one's character hard meta. Then there'd be a whole mess around adding downsides, but some downsides wouldn't count sometimes so there would still be hard metas. It'd basically just be a rolling Survivor buff at the cost of only ever seeing one.
---
I didn't do it on purpose, I just got dc'ed lol
---
Muh split queues.
---
I always just love these common courtesy “rules” for competing teams.  So I’m a 1 man team who wins when all survivors are dead.  You are a 4 man team that wins when you complete gems and escape.  As a killer, why would I not CAPITALIZE on a dumb mistake that YOUR team made?  If you are irritated with being immediately hooked after being unsafely unhooked, then why aren’t you running perks like decisive etc to counter it?
---

---
If we were playing soccer and your goalie was some fucking idiot who only stood in one spot, am I being an asshole for continuing to kick the ball out of his range to score?  No.  It’s played as a team.  You either win as a team or lose as one.  Your idiot teammate isn’t my fault.
---
I'd just say let him set them on windows and gens as traps and reduce or eliminate his slowdown while reloading and throwing.
---
Muh BP economy.
---
Thanks, dedicated servers!

2. Help the community get their money's worth out of the rift.

Hopefully this gets more traction and people who learn of it are willing to participate.

Now that you've mentioned that, the selfie looks even more nice with the moon. :D
---
And I thought 4 traps in a single trial was once in a blue moon for me... Now I have to do it 6 times and/or get every survivor in a trap.
---
Also wtf 3 hooks with NOED in EGC? That's just scummy.

It's only a grind if you think you need to complete it within an unreasonable time-frame. If you break/damage 5 pallets/gens each game, it'll take 8 games. Just put the challenge on, go play your games and be done with it. There isn't a killer out there who doesn't break/damage 5 pallets/gens a game, right?
---
Unhooking 25 survivors is a bit of an issue, but that's only because you're fighting everyone else for those unhooks, especially right now. Just wait a bit for everyone else to complete that one, then pop on a survivor and go unhooking.
---
If it takes you 40 matches to get through the grindy challenges, you still played 40 matches, right?
---
And sure, maybe if you were tracking all unlocked challenges at once, it'd be better. I'll agree that's probably a better way, and I'll admit the tome/challenges aren't perfect.
---
But, the tome isn't difficult or hard. It's not ridiculous or bullshit. And there shouldn't be this many people crying and screaming about how horrible BHVR is and how they're just never do challenges again and so on...
---
There's 40 days left to complete Tier 3 and 4. That should be plenty of time.
---
WeirdChamp probably a weird hotbox because of the narrow space but that first strike definitely should have hit someone
---
Davy Jones, as a concept is well within the public domain. The particular character is still owned by Disney.

Why asian chin is different from everyone else? This picture racist...

They should just make a weaker version of Ruin (Good regresses 1%, but doesn't pause progress) implicit, non-hex, and free up that slot.
---
SURE, CUZ SURVIVORS WILL TOTALLY JUST "STAND THERE AND TAKE IT" WITH NO COMPLAINTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE NOED CHALLENGE. NO ONE'S UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO HELP WITH THESE AWFULLY DESIGNED CHALLENGES THE SAME WAY YOU'RE NOT EXPECTED TO FARM JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE BRINGS BPS
---
When it’s that close I just tap to completion
---
WHY ARE THE SERVERS SO CRAP
---
As a console player, I can say that the recent updates have vastly improved stability. I think it's doable. There don't have to be photo-realistic textures or anything. Lighting is the most important aspect.
---
&gt;and then the killer shows up

With Pop Goes The Weasel. Every. Damn. Time.

PRETTY SURE ANYONE WHO'S CLICKED ON THE INDIVIDUAL PAGES KNOWS THAT BRO, IT'S JUST THAT COLLOQUIALLY "TOME 3" IS SHORTER AND SOUNDS BETTER TO SAY THAN "PAGE 3 OF TOME 1" EVERY TIME YOU REFERENCE IT IN CASUAL CONVERSATION UNLESS YOU NORMALLY TALK LIKE A ROBOT
---
It's why camping unfortunately works a lot more often than it should. Instead of getting punished by being gen rushed people try to save the hooked person and dont do gens. It seems like the higher up in rank people start to understand that although theres still almost always at least 1 even in red ranks that thinks they can stop a camping bubba

I know, swamp generators are safer than in other maps.

It's also a good map for stealth with all the tall grass there is

Oh yea i know, im just saying i wish i knew that that happened to save me a bit of time. I was up till 5 am cranking out rift challenges because i was a whole tomb behind. Im only on tier 15 and im hearing people who are in the 20s being told theyre gonna have to grind all day every day to meet the final rank before the rift closes.

the game USED to be way darker, when people popped moonlight offerings it was hell on some maps. They have made it so much brighter that I dont get the same "feel anymore

Guess what is majority of gamers. Age I mean.

Lol it's funny out of any of the ugly ones you named one of the best looking character models. I get your point it's just funny you name Kate when shes one of the best as opposed to the ones who really need it

---
&gt;Nurse isn't as bad because you can tell when shes using her power and you get feedback on which direction shes going and about where she'll land.
---
Good, You'll get hit anyway tho. Am I wrong?
---
&gt;This lets survivors read what shes doing and try to counter play her. 
---
Try to counterplay a pallet drop against nurse. Or a vault. Is the same thing, it's actually easier since you're locked in an animation and she will hit you.
---
&gt;Spirit's problem isn't that people don't know how to play against her, its that you don't get any feed back on when shes using her power and how shes using her power. 
---
The point is to stay away. She has 110%ms which makes it easier to gain distance and see her using the phasing to catch up. That's a pretty big input
---
If you played spirit more you'll recognize almost immediately when she's going to phase or not
---
&gt;This leaves survivors to have to guess on what the right play is. 
---
Well. Camp pallet ain't it chief
---
&gt;All the while she can see scratch marks, she can see moving grass, she can hear you (especially while injured), and if she messes up using her power she only has a short wait before being able to use it again anyway. 
---
Short wait? If she uses her whole bar is 15s~ cd, that's not short at all. Plus you can easily use iron will which works against every killer, the best one included (Nurse). You can lose killers if you're out of LoS. She can see scratch marks and grass, so what? You're invisible to her and you should take advantage of it 
---
Nurse on the other hand sees you 24/7 and can hit you wherever you are. I don't get your point since Spirit is way worse than Nurse in many aspects. Yeah you can see her charging the blink, congrats it will be the last thing you see tho
---
&gt;Spirit has tons of ways to read how a survivor is trying to play her while shes phasing, survivors don't have any ways to read how shes playing while shes phasing.
---
As I said, also Nurse can do the same and better. While she charge survivors don't become invisible to her and she can easily catch up with you and she will hit you. Vaults and pallets are not a problem for her but they might be for spirit that rely on sound and shitty scratch marks
---
In conclusion, I can easily, not even breaking sweat, make more points why Nurse is way stronger and way more unfair than a blind killer who just rely on sounds and some grass movement. Still, I see more hate towards Spirit than Nurse even if she still the strongest killer in the game
---
I use them a decent amount of time.  Helps knowing which general direction survivors went
---
Nurse
---
I admitted EGC is tough. It's not impossible and we see it happen often enough, but it's tough. You're not adding anything new.
---
And if it's safe unhooks you need, run Borrowed Time.
---
5 traps is easy enough for a person who plays trapper regularly, or just farm it. There's no skill in playing a game as a friendly killer and having a survivor trap themselves X number of times.
---
And yes, Escape while unhooked is going to promote people bringing keys and hiding from the killer. Maybe it's gonna suck a bit, but that doesn't make it difficult. And since enough people do shit like that even without the challenges, you can't really blame the challenge.
---
Also - There's enough times where I've played normally and escaped unhooked. Especially with Spine Chill, which is a great information perk that extends outside the normal terror radius and lets you know when to hide. Is actually a decent playstyle/build.
---
I do kind of wish they added a "Score a certain amount and escape unhooked" to force people to actively play instead of the "skulk and key for hatch when everyone dies" playstyle that will be inevitable... But you can't blame BHVR for their playerbase corrupting the challenge.
---
:-(
---
What’s a teachable perk?
---
I never ever ever teabagg at the Exit Gates. And only if I play with my Friend and then only if he needs time to recover because he doesn’t use Self-Care
---
Oh okay. What’s a teachable perk?
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Monstrous_Shrine
---
It's often considered one of the worst perks in the game since it only affects the basement hooks, and it doesn't have that much of an affect to begin with.
---
Even the decreased unhook chance is bullshit. There was a clip on this sub about a month back of Otz running Monstrous while playing basement Trapper. Someone unhooked themselves and he "rage quit" as a joke.
---
Because people wanna play against every killer like they do with wraith. Weird enough people stop complaining about nurse when she's way worse and isn't blind while using her power
---
I was playing duo and my buddy got it first try. It was a wraith who didn't do to well, we opened doors immediately and I went down so he could safely unhook a feng. Feng was chased, DS'd then wraith left her. She self cared, buddy got hooked she traded and buddy traded for her and DS'd. 
---
All it takes is a killer who gets few hooks ingame, gets one in egc a random who isn't selfish a person who is willing to die, some luck, eye of newt, and advanced knowlad6in quantum physics. See? Easy
---
The 3 perks attached to a specific killer or survivor
---
It's not counter-intuitive for the killer to open the gates because BHVR literally put that ability into the game so the killer can do it.
---
Gens pop, Slug remaining survivors, open gate, hook survivors. Challenge done.
---
**Not Hard**
---
How does kate look bad lol the hell .
---
Ahhhh you are correct thought that was you too.  I apologize for that.  Still the "OK Boomer" thing was you and very very cringe inducing.
---
I play every one of those killers and main Trapper.  You absurdly do not have to 3 gen from second one to play or win with any of them.  I know from lots and lots of experience over several years playing them.  
---
Advocating consideration for the fun of both sides makes me an "entitled douche"......Sorry man but that's absurd.  This community is so much more toxic and shittier than it needs to be.  I just promote ways of playing that you can still win with but aren't pure cancer for the other side.  Again human beings behind those controllers not AI.  After a solid year and a half of survivor nerfs through various balance updates they've lost nearly all their broken cheese.  It's never been easier to play killer than it is right now.  There is plenty of room to play fun and competitive games and still win consistently with salt inducing strats like 30 minute turtle fest simulator.  But you are welcome to think and feel whatever you want.  It's clear neither of us is going to change the others mind on this.
---
What if I look super cute in my carefully considered cosmetic choices??? I spent longer thinking about my outfit than I did my perk set!
---
Crows are good for fakes. Lots of survivors think we don't know where they are and we don't pay attention to the crows but we do.
---
Carl the Cashier
---
I added one of the survivors as friend and asked him if he could help get the 4 traps rift thing
---
on pc it's capped at 60fps not 30 fps... you aren't going to outperform someone by playing w 165fps on pc.
---
and no i won't stop telling people that, because it's true.
---
*Scary doctor noises
---
Did she really get dropped to shit tier after her rework? I have been paying attention to her.
---
The worse one will be doing a flashlight save, most killers in higher ranks will play smart and turn toward walls or bait flashlights if they’re in an open field. Then there’s the issue that flashlights are way harder to use on console due to aiming. Also not to mention the possibility that if the killer sees a bunch of items/flashlights in the lobby, they might use Franklins
---
Me trying to do that challenge would be basically throwing the game cause I would never get it off and I’d be wasting time doing so unless I get super lucky or i get a baby killer
---
I pretty sure
---
Yes
---
I use spies from the shadows as I have really no other perks
---
It’s a perk that is specific to that survivor but once you buy the teachable perk you can get it in any of the bloodwebs for any survivor. Every survivor has 3 teachable perks which are unlocked at levels 30, 35 and 40. It’s basically just teaching their perks to other survivors.
---
Ah, I thought it was just some crazy lag lol, thanks
---
Made it into the gif I wanted!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2pggp/made_the_meme_in_the_original_way_i_invisioned/
---
Most killers are too advance for 360’s anymore. Unless you’re going against a bad bad bad killer you’re better off learning other types of jukes. Pallet jukes, window jukes, hell even locker jukes could save your life. But yeah what I did was turn my sensitivity to 100 and fake turning one way with your left analog, while doing that turn your other one the way you faked and then turn your left the opposite. Defiantly won’t work all the time but depending on the killer you  might get away with it.
---
Indeed I have I shall fix this
---
The issues seems to be that Devs misinterpret Challenges and Jumping Through hoops as the same thing, its not a challenge if i have to rely basically on a act of god to even get the situations where i can achieve the goal.
---
;-;
---
I frequently buy prime access though so I’m definitely one to complain lol
---
By that definition Nurse teleports and she doesn’t have claws
---
This is just me and I'm going to be absolutely honest with you. If they're going to have this battle pass and let's be honest it's a bloody battle pass then they should lower the price of every cosmetic especially for the Killer. It makes no sense that a killer cosmetic is worth more than the Killer
---
Yes, Unhooking 3 is going to be in Tier 4. And fair enough, you're complaining about the Tomes as a whole and why you're glad you didn't purchase. So valid for your discussion. (Been responding to a lot of people complaining about this tier, I may have mixed up a response. Apologies.)
---
-----
---
The NOED challenge is easy.
---
- Generators Pop.
---
- Slug remaining survivors.
---
- Open the exit gate if not opened already.
---
- Hook Survivors.
---
Not too difficult, just requires some set-up. It's not the easiest in the world, but it's certainly not hard.
---
I suck at interrupting people. Having to do it once last tome ended up taking me 6 games. As Ghostface. That's how laughably bad I am at it.
---
Does that make the challenge difficult/ridiculous/impossible, or does that make me bad at grabbing people?
---
Challenges do provide a fun twist. Just because YOU don't like them doesn't mean they're ridiculous/impossible/bullshit as so many people seem to be crying about.
---
As to the grind: If you break/damage 5 pallets/gens a match, it'll take 8 matches to complete the challenge. That's not really a grind when you don't even need to adjust your playstyle to complete the challenge.
---
Just add option  to kill yourself while removing the need to smash button, which is pointless anyway? Qol change that would make everyone happy.
---
The devs don’t understand the game? Once a week they all sit down and play for at least an hour. Online. Against real people. They aren’t going to just give you the BP yeah it’s hard but so was through the fire and flames on expert.
---
I brought up being a Weeabu and you rebutted me by stating three detailed facts about Japanese culture and specifically rebuked it's relationship to Anime and Manga. Points only a Weeabu would make. Heretofore, you are a Weeabu but too ashamed to admit it. I tip my fedora to your cognitive dissonance m'lady.
---
&gt; borruw a quesyij mark  
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
Good killers pay attention to crows and use them to track
---
Plenty of time if all you played was DbD and absolutely nothing else alongside having a job.
---
Constructive...
---
i never asked for an opposing opinion. you're just a child who thinks screaming your opinion will get people to listen to you. I don't care, you apparently do very much
---
The stats are kind of bs imo but yeah I agree otherwise.
---
I was really excited about it at first, very nearly bought it.  Then I cautiously decided to see how I go for a little while.  I'm really glad I didn't buy it now.  
---
The challenges are tough and a few are situational and it out your control.  Like maybe the noed one,  what if it keeps getting cleansed?  Should you camp a totem and let all of the gens go?  
---
Oh idk, would be good if we did a challenge tips post.  I feel that I'd need some nifty ideas from more experienced players to get some done.  Best perks, playstyle ideas etc...
---
Oh so because i cant afford better wifi i shouldnt be playing my favorite game? Wow.
---
You're absolutely right. His kit is so overloaded it's nuts. He's pretty much what Akali was to LOL right after her rework.
---
The Flashlight save one doesn't require the killer to drop the survivor. A Failed save because you started too early will count.
---
Console issues are a console issue, not a tome difficulty issue.
---
Killer using Franklin's is perfectly within their right. If your opponent uses something within the game to stop your challenge that's just how it goes.
---
One challenge you find difficult because of your own inability doesn't make this tome bullshit/impossible/ridiculous. It's your own difficulty.
---
I can't grab/interrupt worth shit. Last tome, doing 1 grab took me 6 games - With Ghostface... That's how bad I am at that. That's not the challenge's fault, it's mine. 
---
Most people finished that challenge in one game. Most people will probably do the 6x grab in 2 games. I'm gonna take about 36 games if my current streak is valid...
---
If you're bad at flashlights, the flashlight challenge is gonna suck a little more than expected. But that's on you, yeah?
---
I just went to play single player story games like Life is Strange, Minecraft Story More, The Walking Dead just to name a few and it kills so much more time than playing this. It’s actually fun and entertaining. You should try playing story games. They’re so good.
---
Oh. You thought we were changing minds. That’s where you made a mistake. I never set out to change your mind. I set out to tell you how telling people how to play the game was douchey. Which is what you are doing. People can play however you want so I go back to my original statement. Get better or DC. One makes you better the other amplifies your douchiness.
---
I gave hatch to a Baby Dwight and they messaged me and called me shit, to this day I never give hatch :)
---
On accident, yes.  Like, if I see crows landing or flying away then obviously I'll go over there to look for the cause of the disturbance, bit I don't actively stare at birds until I detect movement.
---
When you think about it, though, all (or at least not the important ones) this stuff seems to meant to be done in the long run, not in a week. We still have 41 days left.
---
UUAaGh?
---
It gets so confusing sometimes. The one on the hook has Kindred, and we obviously see that the guy is camping, yet someone still tries to go for the rescue. Was I supposed to help and distract??? I got it down to 1 gen left and the 3rd guy is hooked. 
---
I managed to get away by hiding at a corner, and I opened the exit gate when the killer went the other direction.
---
I wish they would do these things but I'm not sure they will. Sounds more like the job for a sequel then this game.
---
Tapp
---
Lol last level I got the challenge of sacrifice survivors to the entity. I was playing survivor and completing the mission lol
---
All of this is practice for the flashlight killer save challenge of Level 4.
---
Sick of people complaining about free improvements to their 3+ year old game. People need to chill.
---
1. Fix the maps. Some jungle gyms are ridiculous and all pallet loops should work like new Badham.
---
2. Remove the Sprint Burst effect from Balanced and Lithe. Have Balanced remove drop stagger, and Lithe guarantee a fast vault, both with a 40/30/20s cooldown.
---
3. Have NOED reveal as soon as it activates, not when someone goes down to it.
---
4. Remove keys and Moris.
---
5. Have Gatekeeper be based mainly on match length, with a big bonus for remaining gens. Basically, Iridescent is either; short match w/ 4 or 5 gens left, or long match with at least 1 gen left.
---
6. Rework Unbroken to be based on match phases, rather than time.
---
7. Ranking and BP bonuses for Killers who go up against SWF groups.
---
I love this I always felt each needed something to stand out I will back  this 100%
---
Yeah they have 2 primary uses. 1. You see them fly off and you know a survivor is there. 2. If crows have not been disturbed, you know that no one is there.
---
What was the window juke again? I remember seeing it in a video but can't find it.
---
I had this last night worse. I grabbed a Claudette off a window, but obviously I didn't. The kicker was that I still had a "survivor" on my shoulder. I could hear everything the Claudette was doing, but couldn't drop or hook the husk. I was left slowed, short strike only, unable to use power or interact with anything. I let them escape just cause but still, it sucked.
---
If anything they need to give a specific amount of skillchecks. Something like 3 skill checks everything 10 seconds or so cause sometimes you go through an entire gen with no skill checks and other times you get 10 back to back
---
Arguably "rushing" gens is what survivors are supposed to do, so i dont get the hate for it by killers other than game taking 3 mins and queue taking 10 mins.
---
In the same note I would dare say tunneling and soft camping aka killing survivors by any means necessary is what killer is supposed to do and doesnt deserve hate any more than "rushing" gens. 
---
If you get downed by killer 3 times in a row and your team didnt take the aggro or help you then there's no point blaming killer for your shortcomings. Many times it has indeed been the teammates that played poorly in those situations.
---
The most extreme case is where killer hooks first survivor after exit gates are powered and facecamps him. Other survivors coordinate together and manage to save him and all escape. And then the camped person still has the nerve to whine about how unfair the killer was. Like bruh... (and this happens very often as most of you are certainly aware)
---
I too play both sides. And no i don't play "toxic"
---
Lmao Nancy's floating.
---
Wow. That's not even cool.
---
Okay this has to be a major issue with the emblem challenge. It is only adding one to my total after each game. But is the second game in a row that I’ve gotten three iridescents and a gold. I should have 7 out of 15 right now, but instead I have 3. What the fuck is this, bhvr?
---
The only thing douchey here is this comment and repeating that personal insult pettiness ad nauseam.  Enjoy the rest of your night, there's no point in continuing this exchange if you're going to resort to that.
---
Your numbers are too big, the exposed for doing gens shouldn't exist or be like 5 seconds. The aura for saving is way to long lasting, no-one would save. The terror radius one needs to be shortened as in going back to the killer as its way to overpowered. 
---
In short your ideas are broken killer fantasies, great for "what if" scenarios but would break the game.
---
Who cares? It's one match. Be nice, help someone out, and move on. Risk? It's a video game. Who cares about the outcome of the match.
---
Because god damn it NO ONE LEFT BEHIND, can't let those killer scum get away with being an asshole! /s
---
HyH?
---
Just got this, and I think this may be helpful: When you install it and start it the first time it hangs on the first load screen, you gotta restart the switch and its gtg. Happy hunting... or surviving!
---
haha what a silly mistake oopsies
---
This all seems super broken. The power is fundamentally busted and the perks are all too strong. Hex: illusion should have the first part taken out, then it would be good. Middle perk, dial the numbers down a bit and remove the second part. Last perk, just lower the numbers
---
What?
---
You could go play at Starbucks or the library if you have a laptop, first off
---
But I mean, yeah, you shouldn't. Should 4 other people have their game ruined because you spend your money on stuff besides internet? How much more a month is the better internet?
---
It’s kinda hard to do but basically you would vault a window and run either left or right out of view of the killer and then run to the side of the window, crouch while the killer is vaulting and kinda go under his feet and slow vault back through the window. A video would help better so look up Ussylis DBD window vault or something like that. He has a video on all the juking actually.
---
Lol, literally the same thing happened to me today. I was playing the Trapper on low ranks, offered Survs to farm and laid my traps. Claudette-8th-birthday comes and starts deactivating my traps instead of stepping into them. When she did it for like 5th time, I tried stepping into one myself to give an example, but she was not  smart enough to get what I want. 
---
Fortunately some Jake wearing last event's full set came by and helped me.
---
(Second attempt because I messed up)
---
A A A G H
---
I mean the free pass is free. And even if you drop $10 for the premium you can still wait till you reach the end to buy it and get those $10 in auric cells right back so you effectively get that for free too. But battlepass bad lmao.
---
Spirit relies on a good pair of headphones.
---
Everyone has their killers ranked but nobody ever ranks the chapters as a whole. This would be interesting

I mostly agree that these challenges are ridonkulous, but to be fair, getting multiple survivors in the basement as the trapper isn't at all difficult if you run agitation. I usually end up with 2/3 people in the basement when I play Trapper without needing to camp simply by setting a trap midway up the stairs. A lot of people run into it when they see me pick up somebody else, and then since I'm coming to the basement anyway...
---
I’ve quit playing the survivor path until BHVR fixes this clusterfuck. 
---
Everyone is running around stealing unhooks with no borrowed time EGC
---
Okay?
---
Gen tapping is 2019. Bye. Downvoted and immediately moving on to the next post in the thread.
---
The first two levels were for the most part perfectly fine and pretty fun imo, but then this bombshell dropped on us lmao. Seriously, this is insane. Two unhooks during EGC? Normally, that would be doable over multiple games, but ONE MATCH? Also, two basement hooks with Monstrous Shrine? So I’m going to not only sacrifice one of my go to perks for the worst killer perk in the game, but I’m also gonna have to basically camp the basement and get called a tryhard for doing so. I love you BHVR, but these are very questionable.
---
Like seeing a long lost homie, and you just go straight crazy.
---
That’s fine. You could have worded that better and then people may have listened to your perspective. “Shut up” was an effectively pointless contribution except to poorly vent your frustration.
---
Honestly their are some. These include Corrupt Intervention, thrilling tremors, and pop. The problem is these are mostly character specific. You’re not going to use trapper with thrilling but you’ll use him with corrupt. You’re not using pop with pig but you can use thrilling with her. Can’t think of any other perks besides Forever Freddy add-on combo.
---
It's not really a choice for the killers at high ranks. They get crushed most of the time if they don't run it and I don't really think their should be anything to counter it. What they should do is change a base mechanic so generators are slower on they're own.
---
It should clear up soon, but the 2 rescues EGC shouldn’t be 1 game. That’s just absurd. 5 unhooks with no game limit would be acceptable
---
Cool art style!!
---
But imagine being a survivor and getting to see this merry group before they try to kill you
---
Thirstvivers.
---
BHVR: “Escape a trial without being hooked while using the perk Spine Chill” 
---
Red rank solo queue survivors:  “Am I a joke to you?”
---
LMAOOO it’s al thanks to you bro
---
I have no clue how you did it, but in that whole wall of text, you never mentioned decisive strike. Any thoughts?
---
oopsie...
---
Shut up
---
I play on a PlayStation so i cant, also im a student with a part time job so paying more is nope
---
I crash maybe once/twice a day (i play about 15 games) so it's often but not every time so no im going to stop playing a game i love because of shitty internet
---
Br0 it's a post on the internet idccc
---
HAS ANYONE ELSE FELT LIKE THIS GAME IS LESS ABOUT FOUR PEOPLE TRYING TO ESCAPE ONE PLAYER TRYING TO KILL THEM AND MORE LIKE FIVE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER TO ESCAPE BHVR'S TORTURE?
---
I’ve had this issue as well so your not alone. This really needs to be fixed since I lose a games worth of progress every other game and it can drive players away
---
It should punish manual dcs
---
The challenges are supposed to be possible in a regular match too.
---
ACTUALLY I'VE DIED QUITE A FEW TIMES TO GET KILLERS THEIR CHALLENGES. THE VERY ILL-CONCEIVED GRINDY CHALLENGES ARE JUST AS BAD FOR THEM.
---
Well that's an unnecessary comment, and some of us haven't been playing this game for that long.
---
She needs to be slow though. She can teleport through  walls, pallets, and everything in between and immediately hit. It’s part of the learning curve.
---
With how things usually go in this community, can you blame us?
---
I actually enjoy tier list post when people are serious. It’s interesting to see other people’s opinions. The memey tier lists were getting old tho
---
All good man, my sons name is Aidan and he plays games too
---
I’ll take your number tf
---
I give them hatch based on how they played the match and how I’m feeling that day most of the time I hook them but if they played well I give them hatch
---
Great Concept!
---
The tapp one 😂
---
I just feel like they might have gone a bit too steep with the nerfs. I saw gameplay of her before and she seemed at least better than she is now.
---
But yeah, she's gonna seem slow to me because I main the pig and Legion 😂
---
I think you are missing the point. The fucking challenges are not very bard, they are fucking annoying and force you to play in stupid ways (unhooks during EGC will generate so much farming for example). They force you to play with fucking NOED and with the totally not worst perk in the game MONSTROUS FUCKING SHRINE. And to get worse, they force you to play with Trapper, so if you are on red ranks and you aren't a Trapper main or simply don't like the playstyle you need to have with him, well BHVR just says fuck you and be fucked. But hey, keep being a fanboy I guess. Can't wait for a challenge like kill 5 survivors in a match or open 3 doors in a match or something, thanks to people like you.
---
&gt;Challenges do provide a fun twist.
---
Because playing with terrible perks is fun.
---
Np bro
---
Yeah this one is complete bullshit. I'm currently going around it by doing killer's first and I'll just keep it for last.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2px6w/iradescent_age_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This is surely a joke lmao
---
These challenges aren't even worth trying. Been playing this game for three years and still wouldn't be good enough to do these challenges naturally. This is literally just a shit attempt to get you to pay to level up the tome. These devs can go fuck themselves, because I'm not giving them anymore money.
---
I mean, as far as I know, this is new, no one ever in this cummunity have done a chapter tier list
---
Yeah I've had a few situations on Survivor too where I try to vault and they just warp right to me and yoink me out of a vault.
---
I died at the claudette Bush part lmfao
---
I used a gideons offering and iri heads, i truly am a monster who needs a shrine
---
Edit the girls face in the last panel to be happier
---
"What color do you want your survivors?"
---
"Red"
---
It definitely ruins the actual objective of the game when a new tome releases, If they branched it out by have 2 survivor and 2 killer branches instead of 1 each it'd have worked better.
---
Like a repair x gens along with the unhook challenge, its funneled to the point where everyones rushing hooks now and just trying to get it done. I'm all for "hard" challenges but it doesn't feel rewarding to do the challenges IMO
---
I MEAN YOU COULD ALSO JUST SAY "PAGE 3"
---
Talia mar on twitch and yt, plus her boyfriend (miniminter) and best friends (freya nightingale and gee nelly)
---
I’ve never seen one
---
Then you all get ganked by NOED and call the killer mean names when you could have just done the bones and prevented it instead of mindlessly rushing the gens
---
What a childish comment.
---
People complain about BHVR not knowing how to balance their own game but then post something like this lol.
---
He just want to wish a merry Christmas to you
---
Davy Jones from the PotC series is probably unavailable (never say never tho, DbD is not a joke), but Davy Jones as a character in general is not a copyright-protected entity. Not even his name. So we can easily have a port/a shipwreck map with Jones. BHVR, could we please have it?
---
Bootstrap Bill as a Survivor could also be sick.
---
They won't because they want you to pay to level up.
---
Wake me up when the Christmas sweaters are here 😪
---
Honestly if we're going for a Killer who uses a hook, I'd rather get the Candyman.
---
Neau.
---
I was suggesting the Fisherman because of the map suggestion, but I agree with Candyman as well
---
The other guy was rude as shit about it, but this guy wasn’t, and he’s right. Gen rapping slows the game down more than Ruin itself actually does. There’s nothing wrong with giving another player advice to get better.
---
So sacrificing 4 people on the basement in one game is easy? Interesting...
---
No
---
Demo doesn’t teleport, though. He crawls between dimensions.
---
Kate is the best looking one of the whole game!
---
Tome 1 and 2 were fun and I didn't really see an increase in farming matches.  However with tome 3 I know for the next few days I'm just going to farm myself.
---
Yes as long as the survivor doesn’t get downed
---
"insert X noises" is barely one step above nobody memes.
---
So does that mean Scarry Terry can't teleport, because they're miniture swords and not knives?
---
You need to dial those numbers down a lot a lot they seem like good perks in all but they need to be legion’d seriously what kind of drugs were u on
---
said noise noises*
---
I never said he was I'm saying she can do what works best for her.
---
sad noise noises*
---
It takes whatever is impossible to get, so yeah
---
Play in stupid ways? Like kicking generators and destroying pallets? Or safely unhooking someone? Or.. I don't fucking know, using Spine Chill?
---
God fucking forbid you have to change how you play for an **OPTIONAL AND FREE THING**.
---
Get over yourself. The challenges are fine. You're terrible. Having a hard-on on hating BHVR doesn't make you right. Just makes you an entitled crybaby that can't understand that not everything is handed to you on a silver fucking plate.
---
&gt; Oh no!!! My game has optional challenges that I can do for free bonus extra stuff, but I have to slightly adjust how I play to do them!
---
Fuck off, crybaby.
---
Yeah that’s normal. Usually I’m hoping for it so I can save BP on a useless web.
---
People downvote it because tHe gAmE faVorS SurViVORs!  
---
When the stats show the exact opposite is in effect.
---
But that doesn’t work best lol, just committing to the gen does. Why are you being OP’s knight in shining armor? The dude just gave advice and he is correct. OP should just stick to the gen, there is nothing wrong with saying that.
---
She's actually a Kate and Nancy main she was being Claudette for a challenge so way to fail on that mate x'D
---
Great, thanks!
---
I’m just going to completely avoid the 2 safe unhooks in EGC. Pretty much impossible and obviously the devs don’t test their own challenges..
---
Ah, your first mistake was not playing as the friendly bing-bong-boi and just cheese the grabs.
---
I feel like level 3 of the first tome wouldn't be so bad IF all the challenges were active since they require a lot grinding.
---
Then it won't be as bad as it sounds.
---
Playing Claudette = all brain cells lost 
---
Playing Nancy = boosted 
---
Playing Kate = Mega Boosted
---
Right! I scared him twice that night so that makes up for it lol
---
What???
---
I never asked for advice.
---
Why dc and ruin the game for everyone else?  Just wait... You think that they have instantly run straight to you?   They can get the gen done &amp; rescue you.
---
They are. Just not very common.
---
Its not about winning, its about having fun :) 
---
I sometimes will let 3 survivors go just because the fourth one was ruining it for them . I want every one in my session to leave knowing it was fair . Although demanding the hatch is a no no . Never demand gifts.
---
Except the killer has literally all the power between the two people so it's actually the exact opposite of 'cat calling'.
---
We love a niche meme!!
---
I was playing as claudette for a challange. Besides i wasn't gen tapping the whole time it was just near the end because i blew it up and didnt want to risk it again.
---
I’m here to agree with you - they aren’t too difficult just require you to maybe try a different play style. Or god forbid, run different perks to help accomplish the challenge.  I’ve actually had a lot of fun changing up from normal objectives. I normally main survivor(who sucks at flashlights mind you) and would play killer occasionally and I have completed every challenge thus far (except the most recent rift). Granted, Rank 4 survivor and Rank 10 killer. Definitely manageable if you just have fun with it and don’t “push” to get it. Just let it happen. 
---
Honestly, I think BHVR has done a great job with giving other objectives. It does suck when another survivor throws a match just to do a challenge, but it definitely doesn’t happen every game in my opinion.
---
For the killer ones, I just message the survivors before the game starts, and ask if theyll help. Only way to remove this boring ass grind.
---
Yea, Silvers are great.
---
Me: *Writes story about a silver dragon, expressly states they're a silver dragon in the story*
---
Teacher: "Did their parents know they were part dragon" (yeah... I swear she's blind sometimes. One story literally opened with a log indicator, like "Log #A17725" and she didn't realize it was a log)
---
Me: You uncultured human.
---
Lol. Baby survivor too scared of skill checks. Git gud
---
What are some of the challenges
---
But there’s nothing wrong with getting it, idk why you and the other person are being so stuck up about it.
---
Not with that NoED
---
We’re gonna live forever is in the shrine. I would suggest buying it if you need more BP.
---
Noed and prayer beads lol...
---
The challenge encourages being a basement camping twat. That isn’t difficult or fun to play, and it’s certainly not fun to play against. This kind of shit is what a ton of players want *less* of in this toxic ass game.
---
They basically added the antithesis of what people wish for.
---
&gt; in an attempt to take aggro; maybe it's annoying as fuck, but it's not being done for the sake of being toxic   
---
This is what most "toxic" behavior is really done for. In fact, the only ***actually*** toxic people are the people who whine about those behaviors being toxic.
---
  
---
Almost always the same people who hurl insults in chat after the match. You know, the behavior most people are actually referring to when they say "toxic".
---
Thanks mate, I always went with the aura on tier up and the increased maddness since i felt the time was too long, ill try em again next time i play him tho see if i do better. :)
---
I just did the exact same thing as your trapper except I had padded jaws so I didnt hurt them and I let em all go no hits. (I am tired and didnt want to play dbd but I was so close to leveling hag to get ruin.) Im glad the david helped.
---
If he would stop messaging on other accounts. Stop inviting mr to parties and getting hisnfriends to message me.... then sure lol. He named and shamed himself.
---
Because he’s a boosted baby survivor that doesn’t learn
---
Is there a way to dirle and coolme back alive? TUESDAY CANT COME ANY FASTER FOR FUCKS SAKES
---
So borrowed time wont count towards a safe unhook?
---
And you don't? Okay 'bruh'. *Cringe*
---
It would be no different then Killers mate. I see no problem with survivors having abilities. I want survivors too have more of a purpose then just perks for the main survivor.
---
You must've been asleep when you pulled them down. It doesnt work when asleep.
---
Queue times are almost instant at rank 1, it's because you just moved over if you are rank 20 you're gonna have to wait a while. Red to green you shouldnt wait more than a minute
---
Freddy is immune to borrowed time
---
Ah, fuck it. I just bought The Cannibal but thank you.
---
I honestly didn't mean to look through your bedroom window. I fucked up while trying to get over your fence. But once there, how could I *not* notice you taking your clothes off.
---
Okay and I understand that. The guy referring to was being an asshole and I completely agree with that. However the other dude was not attacking you, and neither was I. There is no need for you and your friend to be so defensive and stuck up to me or to him. 
---
I get being new to the game because we’ve all been there and I agree that at least you’re doing something. But you want to help your team instead of doing nothing, right? Powering through the gen instead of gen tapping helps more because it goes faster, even if you can’t hit the greats. That’s all that person was saying. To outright refuse a suggestion to help you and your team is a little odd. 
---
You do you. Your original explanation of the gen being almost done and you not wanting to mess up is fine like that makes sense. But there’s no reason to be stuck up about getting tips.
---
That res
---
Are you on pc?
---
It doesn't work if you're asleep against Freddy cause there's no heartbeat, lullaby instead. It's stupid and BT needs to be based off distance I stead of heartbeat based on Freddy and stealth killers.
---
No? Lol I’ve been completely civil with you and your friend.
---
I wish they would buff perks but cancel interactions between 2 strong perks. Babysitter can't be what you suggested it should be because of bt, if you have both survivors with endurance it would be pretty unfair. If babysitter was changed to your suggestion but I couldn't run bt then maybe it would be viable
---
Or we could get a terrifying pirate killer.
---
I think its wonderful I dont have to run self care anymore or bring a med kit because people always rush to heal me. My only issue is some people farm me off of hooks sometimes but that's always been a problem. Occasionally I recognize when someone wants a certain challenge done to and I'll help. Like a claudette that needed to pop another gen before I hooked her. I let her get it then went about my hooking business.
---
If you're asleep, then you are Oblivious. Borrowed Time works based on terror radius and Oblivious removes the terror radius.
---
You literally said the challenges that got leaked (So I guess Tome 4 since they were the only ones who were leaked) were easy. Therefore, you think sacrificing 4 people on the basement in one match is easy since it's one of the challenges.
---
[removed]
---
The challenges are ramping up in difficulty, sure. And I think the unhook 25 is on the higher side, compared to the others
---
I can expect to break 5 pallets/gens a game, meaning 8 matches to complete. I can't unhook 5 people in a game since I'm fighting for unhooks. If I unhook 2 people a game, that's still 13 matches. Think it should've been closer to 15 unhooks total.
---
But other than that, things aren't horrible. The EGC unhooks will be tough. The NOED one will take some set-up, but not difficult. The Spine Chill one will take some luck. But overall, these challenges aren't bad.
---
Not perfect, but not bad. And certainly not worth all the crying and salt that everyone else is throwing out.
---
there's no terror radius when you're asleep so you can't use borrowed time
---
The queues speed up considerably once you hit \~13-15
---
So you think creating and constantly updating a game is easy? Especially when you have cry baby bitches that are always complaining about things when it doesn’t go their way but then expect them to spend their time playing the Gabe instead of fixing it? Lol
---
I smell a survivor main
---
I mean even if he had a reason to apparently read every single post, only 3 of them even mention killer or survivor, and all three are in the same thread. Not to mention that his wild assumption is completely inaccurate. I play killer and survivor pretty evenly.
---
You could probably run Ruin and nothing else on Spirit and win with Prayer Beads. Why NoEd?
---
If you read your last comments quite clearly not 'bruh'.
---
Oh my fucking god... I thought tome 2 was bad
---
So you think creating and constantly updating a game is easy? Especially when you have cry baby bitches that are always complaining about things when it doesn’t go their way but then expect the DEVS to spend their time playing the game instead of fixing it? Lol
---
I felt so proud that DBD was in a TV advert hahahaha
---
Ugh, what are they doing to this situational perk im not aware off?
---
Let me guess, killers that complained that BHVR never listens to them complained about Balanced landing on haddonfield so BHVR decided that rather than get rid of map offerings let's nerf Balanced? That about sum it up?
---
Reminds me of a little bit of irony i noticed with a certain... talanted streamer who complained about it but at the same time uses map offerings to go to hawkins laboratory with scratched mirror Michael.
---
Map offerings are the problem, not the perks.
---
I don’t think I have ever done this in all my hours of playing the game
---
I'm a girl and I was giving advice. Powering through Ruin is good advice...
---
A safe unhook is when the survivor doesn’t get downed 15 seconds after unhooking them. If they take the borrowed time hit and get away, it will count as a safe unhook.
---
I'm not a killer I play survivor 60% of the time...
---
For a while after that meme became popular I'd hear that damn music everytime I watched a teammate suicide on hook.
---
The sprit BELL
---
Damn you sure got him. Maybe spend less time on reddit and more time playing killer.
---
You might learn a thing or two.
---
5% gen speed is too much considering prove thyself is what like 10% and you need another person with you? So if both people were running technician and one had prove thyself that’s what like 20% gen speed? Not to mention the speed reduced when working with someone else. 
---
It should grant 1/2/3% gen speed when working on a gen alone
---
I loled at this comment
---
So then getting a safe unhook during egc will be easy. It takes like 10 to 15 seconds for it to go away right?
---
It's some of that  
---
# 『Sticky Fingers』

stuff
---
Im not being stuck up, but seriously me gen tapping was not the point of the video yet everyone decided to comment about it and like one person saying it is enough thanks, you dont all have to rub in my face.
---
You mean my comment asking why you’re being stuck up? Or the comment where I said the other guy was being a dick and defended OP? Or the comment where I just gave advice? Yeah, I’ve been a real douche in this thread... 
---
As you sit there and downvote every comment I add and continue to act stuck up.
---
C'mon bruh, just focus on the video. Someone already beat you to the punch.
---
Really just smells like someone who wants to keep balance.
---
Any perk that is dependent on a terror radius (both killer and survivor perks) don’t work while in the dream world. So his lullaby doesn’t get changed by things like Distressing or Monitor &amp; Abuse and survivor perks like Borrowed Time or Stake Out don’t work while you’re asleep.
---
u/StrengthToGoOn does people having fun bother you

I'm actually a killer main, been playing for nearly a year as killer only. I've only recently (when the archives started) playing survivor as well
---
Yep so you acknowledged it so you admit it.. Who said I downvoted anyone lmfao?

I never understood how people fall for fake phases. Why the fuck would you ever take the chance and run back towards her?
---
I wasn't talking about you.
---
(user has disabled messaging)
---
Reddit dry as hell man :((
---
imo that’s actually a nerf to calm spirit. the most useful thing about it is countering killers and perks that cause you to scream.
---
Oh yeah all my replies to you immediately getting downvoted is such a coincidence. Lol it’s insane how much you acting like an ass has hijacked this post. Shit would’ve been over and done with if you didn’t feel the need to act like a stuck up brat in the first place.
---
Young punks and their fancy lingo, back in my day...
---
this is probably the easiest way to do it. Im rank 4. noone steps in traps at this rank let alone 5!
---
Does corrupt need strength outside of early game? I think that's its purpose.
---
Because no one asked for your input and I'm a girl so I can't have a neckbeard so once again with you failure to get things right xD
---
Just a tip for anyone struggling with the trapper trap challenges: Just farm and be friendly. Survs will go into the traps to heal and untrap each other. It’s how I’ve done all of them so far.
---
i completed the "sacrifice all survivors in one trial one" by someone d/cing during the loading screen and it just gave it to me. which i was super happy about cuz i had yet to actually get a 4k by that point and thought I'd be stuck on it forever
---
I LEGIT HAVE NO CLUE BESIDES WAIT FOR RANK RESET AND THEN HOPE TO DERANK EVEN FURTHER WHILE TRYING UNTIL YOU EVENTUALLY DROP TO A LOW ENOUGH RANK WHERE THE SURVIVORS ARE POTATO ENOUGH FOR YOU TO STAND A CHANCE. ALSO LOAD UP ON GOOD ADDONS TOO.
---
ALTHOUGH EVEN AMONG THE ADEPTS, SOME ARE WAAAY HARDER THAN OTHERS. FOR FREDDY, HUNTRESS AND WRAITH, YOU MAY AS WELL BE PLAYING PERKLESS FOR HOW USEFUL THEIR UNIQUE PERKS ARE, WHILE BILLY, GHOSTFACE AND HAG HAVE SOME PRETTY STRONG PERKS TO MAKE DUE WITH.
---
Just because it's not likely to happen every match doesn't mean it's impossible. Are you expecting to finish all of them in a day?
---
I would've done a weird Jack Black walk to the fridge for a beer.
---
Happens pretty often with Spirit, really sucks.
---
\^ Probably can only win with NOED
---
I main survivor idiot. I just hate Claudettes
---
Sacrifice everyone in the basement? Incoming toxic basement trapper
---
Doubt it.
---
Wow thanks for every one who took the time to explain me! Helps alot, started this year!
---
YOU CAN'T WIN! IF YOU HOOK A SURVIVOR TWICE YOU ARE A TUNNELER! IF YOU SEE A SURVIVOR AFTER YOU HOOK ANOTHER AND CHASE THEM YOU ARE A CAMPER! EITHER WAY YOU GET TEA BAGGED!
---
You'll get hate for it, but you're absolutely right.
---
bold claims. you got anything to back that up?
---
I understand why other stuff are downvoted but not this. I also go and stand next to killer to die at the end of the game when i feel like they had a bad game and still didnt camp or something. Sometimes matchmaking sucks as we know and its no one's fault so...
---
# Yes.
---
Girls can neckbeard. You sound like a brain dead feminist. I'm aware you're a girl. And I'll quote what you said about me revealing my gender "Congratulations.". "Failure to get things right". You're right! Gen tapping is so meta and super OP. Please nerf.
---
Then clearly you haven’t developed PTSD over having so many Claudettes fucking screw you over in solo queue.
---
Thank you :)
---
Dying light and pop are pretty good replacements. Until gen times get reworked, I doubt we'll be seeing less of ruin anytime soon. Stakeout can sort of counter ruin by giving you 4 great skill checks tokens and they work with ruin active. Other than that, getting better at hitting great skill checks will be your best bet
---
Well the rift pass is different from the Tomes. Based on what someone said in the dbd forums, Tome 1 Level 1-4 are permanent additions and aren't meant to be completed fast.
---
I don't know how true that is because I couldn't find a straight answer anywhere myself. But honestly I don't have a lot of time to play, I bought the Rift pass on day 1 and I still have several pages to go.
---
No one asked for your input either. And you're acting super fucking petty. Typical gamer girl behaviour.
---
depends on what ure wearing. try santa body with halloween face
---
Should of T bagged at the gate
---
This sub disagrees with you. Apparently top-tier challenges should only take one match to achieve and should not require you to do anything except play the game normally.
---
is it not working?
---
I started playing last month and I had quite a few of the more leveled up survivors take me on “gentle” chases to learn pallet loops and stuff. They didn’t let me win but they clearly took it easy on me so I could understand how people would play. It was nice to see randoms play like that considering the games reputation for having a horrendously toxic community.
---
And then I had survivors that completely lived up to that reputation. Fucking sprint bursting away and teabagging my flashlight spamming and acting like asshats just because I was obviously new.
---
Why care about the other 2 members of Legion. Julie is best girl anyway.
---
Time to grind 20k shards to get her day of the dead cosmetics
---
Frayed Rope: A thick and worn rope that mother used to drag dinner back to the cabin with. It’s use is better when tying it to the hatchets
---
Once hitting a survivor with a hatchet, press the secondary action button to pull yourself to the survivor.
---
Sometimes it's fun just to follow the community, yeah? I go periods with not having time to play but I still come to this subreddit most days
---
This also applies to the cucks who wanted/want The Joker in game
---
It wasnt earlier. Only counted 1 iri emblem per game
---
She either blocked me or deleted the post so us non-gentappers win. :)
---
I'm not a feminist either I'm against it LMFAO No girls don't have beards dear unless they have a rare abnormality. I don't gen tap I'm just saying let her do what works for her and don't get triggered when no one wants to hear your 'advice' no one asked for..

I find clown quite enjoyable to play and he’s good at slowing loopers down. Once you learn about aiming the bottles in the right places he’s real fun to play
---
An unexperienced killer will still kill an unexperienced Survivor.
---
Good sfw will destroy you obviously
---
Can you suggest some challenges then?
---
me too. i felt bad doing the kill the obsession 7 times one. try to play normal but when you start to lose, you just gotta tunnel em out :( not fun for the survs.
---
Oh and you also gotta hope they’re not on death hook :)
---
&gt;Escape without being hooked.
---
Okay, come on. That one is literally easier than the requirements to get the Iridescent Survival emblem.

I get that some of these challenges like "two unhooks during EGC" can be reasoned as ridiculous to impossible for most of the playerbase, but if we're going to complain, let's complain about those challenges, not ones that just take *trying*.
---
BHVR big brain
---
And they also had the addon where they could see blood while phasing
---
I'm so heavily downvoted for just asking "Which challenges are hard."
---
Like, people are so sensitive that they'll downvote a question clarifying what they're crying about.
---
If balanced talking about balanced landing it's the only exhaustion perk that still works while you're exhausted, I play survivor but it seems reasonable to me they want them all on an equal level where they don't do anything for you after you're exhausted. Unless you're talking about another perk since you didnt say which one.
---
Yes. Ever since they added the rift dead by daylight just runs like ass. Runny ass.
---
I also once inofficially "married" my ADC in a League of Legends match, just because we had such a great time chatting. Goofy chats are the greatest.
---
Also I don't know if you know this, but the hatch on the swamp map can spawn in the corner of the map
---
I mean i gave u a change of distortion but im not gonna go over every single one bc alot of them do what they are meant to do. And thats the thing you wont be able to find them bc this game relies alot on sound and making it to where survivors are basically muted breaks the game. Also toolboxes,prove thyself, stake out, better together, spine chill, this is not happening.
---
So what will you say when people complain your challenges encourage farming?
---
THANK YOU!!!!
---
But it's glowing before last gen
---
I used to main clown but whenever I play him now at red ranks I regret it. He can deal with loops a little, but honestly it isn’t much even with the extra hindered add on. If you get a big map you’re absolutely screwed.
---
r/nicesurvivors not existing is a hidden joke aswell
---
r/stabbygang
---
You’re nerfing calm spirit in this
---
That’s my profile pic
---
They don't want to answer questions. They want to complain.
---
Why?
---
5 minutes later killer has insta downs and you just figured out that they have devour hope.
---
They only got rid of the abusable part. Now its like every other exhaustion perk, it didnt make since for it to have a passive.
---
The change is so all exhaustion perks work the same now  I personally don't have a problem with the change and I use balanced.
---
Some of them are yes however I'd argue after a match where a baby dweet dropped every single pallet on the map in a single chase that some of them encourage gameplay sabotage. The problem is that we can't do any other challenges while grinding these annoying ones out, that's why people are annoyed by them, because fuck all else can be done until they've been grinded.
---
[if that happened to be I would've done this](https://youtu.be/Ds0vpkvwxzg)
---
It’s not ruined the only reason they changed it was because it’s the only exhaustion perk that does something after doing the main reason it wouldn’t be fair to make it better then other exhaustion perks it’s still gonna be used same as dead hard
---
After the 1st 2 locker jukes he was just potato mode
---
What a cutie. Great job
---
IM SORRY BUT I PLAY VIDEO GAMES FOR FUN AND HAVING A 100% CHANCE TO LOOSE ISNT FUN
---
Obviously you've never played against me.
---
Why would he report? It’s just a joke
---
The problem is it isn't one match. He's not the only person doing challenges. I don't care about winning or losing. I don't care about completeling challenges now or never. I care about having fun. And people only focussing on challenges takes away the fun for me. Unfortunately atleast 1 out of 3 games is ruined for me atm, meaning that if I play 3 hours of dbd, 1 hour is just completely wasted
---
This is a tier three challenge (get kills after endgame with NOED) so this would work again for you, I’m sure.
---
F
---
It's almost like it works and you fall for it 9/10 times...
---
It's honestly better now than with the original idea. Having too much on the screen sort of ruins it. Also everyone on this reddit knows the meme so you didnt really need it in the Gif. The title was clearly enough, as you can tell by the amount of updoots you got
---
I suppose bonus bosses shouldn't kick you in the teeth, then.
---
I feel like either most of the really difficult “in one game” ones should be changed to be overall instead and just increase the number to make up for it.
---
Or we should be able to take more than one challenge at a time. 
---
I imagine if for example we just had them all active then instead of farming people could just play the game and naturally get 90% of them completed and just farm for the last 3-4 of them at the end.
---
Clown is pretty meh, but his teachable PGTW is so good it almost makes him worth buying
---
This is the child’s play compared too tome 4
---
28% movement speed? Bruh
---
While I do agree, I see where some people are coming from. Now its gonna arguably be the weakest of the exhaustion perks and kinda more map dependent. Not all maps have practical use for BL, as to where the other exhaustion perks can be used anywhere.
---
And they wonder why people call them entitled.
---
Snowflakes fits pretty damned perfectly, sadly. Complaining about their free extra in a video game.
---
They’ve been saying it all over the forums. Pretty much any post that tries too use the official stats they say the same thing, “don’t use the official stats for anything specific because there are too many factors.” I even made a post about it and a dev said “the stats are both accurate and broad.” Which isn’t even possible.
---
Its not that we have any other method of communication....teabagging could mean: gg man you got me, well played, it's not necessarily a way to troll you.
---
if only developers add some more emote that work while walking and running, maybe survivors stop teabaging for everything.
---
i don't know man...i think they did a *pretty good job so far*
---
Ok. Good to know. The next challenge I have is the Monstrous Shrine one. If I had that challenge and the perk equipped, it would have been absolute child's play trying to get it in the match I played as Ghostface. 10 basement hooks in 1 game. The entire game was played by/in the shack.
---
I try my damnest to not give away that I saw it. Spoiler alert, it doesn't work.
---
Instead of: *"Arrrhh, that was really painful"*
---
say: *"Heeeh haaaah haaaa"*
---
Now this is pod racing
---
100% using this tonight. The second I get in a game.
---
Why does it matter if you let survivors go though? Yes, killing them after they helped you is a scummy thing to do. But now they didn't get to play the game. I personally dc if a killer farms. I don't care about winning. I don't care about bloodpoints. I don't care about completing challenges. I want to have fun. People sweating their asses of these challenges are just taking part of an addictive mindset that is already shown in games like fifa. Look at the fifa subreddit and see how many posts are about mental health when playing fifa. Most fifa players don't have fun, but are let by those challenges. It's what made me quit.
---
Sorry for the whole rant. This wasn't meant on you. I hope you understand that :)
---
Oh, I agree. The "one challenge at a time" mechanic is arguably the worst, least thought-out part of this entire rift thing. It really intensifies all the anger over difficult challenges. It is what really motivates players to grind and definitely even sabotage games to get a challenge.   
---
No one wants to sit there hoping the opportunity for a master challenge just comes along while "playing legit" and knowing that they could just be grinding out the basic ones. So of course, most people are going to want to force those opportunities to happen.  
---
It's dumb and I don't think anyone will agree that mechanic is not dumb. They could do it in so many different ways. Select one master challenge at a time and one "basic" challenge.  
---
Or, just don't use any "selection" limit at all because it makes no fucking sense in any fucking way at fucking all when you already have to progress through a tree. Why can't I just do any of the challenges my completed nodes connect to??? That already inherently limits the challenges I can do at any time.  
---
God damn it's stupid and I'm red in the face again just thinking about it.  
---
But. That doesn't make those challenges themselves actually difficult. It's slightly annoying to see some people compare pretty straightforward challenges to ridiculous ones like the ECG challenge that make you wonder if a disgruntled BHVR employee was just trolling us. BHVR likely isn't going to admit they did wrong, so if they're going to listen and make changes, we got to narrowly focus what we're asking for.
---
Why not?
---
Using borrowed in solo queue in a nutshell
---
True. A pallet stun removes corrupt purge immediately.
---
I don’t think that just because your in red ranks means you’re good with nurse even if you’ve practiced her outside of red ranks.
---
They are working on maps, though. Didn't they say they'll be doing Haddonfield sometime?
---
My problem is it puts a fucking forcefield around them. They are literally invincible for a full minute. It wastes so much time that it’s not even funny. In a game where the outcome can be decided in seconds, that is nowhere near acceptable. You don’t even have to be tunneling. They get unhooked and then they immediately get on a gen in front of your face. What do you do? Hit them and slug them and get nothing out of it, since they can wait until you leave them crawl to teammates to get picked up? Hit them and pick them up, get your ass stunned and they get a 3 mile head start? Let them do the gen? What makes it unfair is it enables survivors to do the stupidest shit for a full minute with absolutely no consequence. The way the timer works should be changed. IMO, it should have a 20 second timer after being unhooked, when you get chased, that timer pauses. You get downed by the killer it stays paused. You work on a gen, unhook someone, heal someone, or a totem, the timer instantly depleted. You get picked up before the timer is depleted, you can ds. This would turn it into an ACTUAL anti-tunnel perk
---
Try to get any two people to make up what they consider to be "good challenges" and the two will start arguing about how bad the others' are.
---
Heaven forbid any if these people glance over at their gaming platform's achievements page. Nobody complains about those, despite them being about ten times as hard or grind-heavy as the tome challenges.
---
Probably
---
Did you only get 1 point of progress towards the challenge?
---
Brainfarts at 3am starring ~ me
---
I want that meg mask. Is it seasonal? Haven’t seen it on ps4 (I’ve only played for a couple months)
---
Bruh what?
---
Don't you mean a pretty gud...**JOB** sofahr?
---
The difference here is that these challenges will come naturally.
---
You're evetually repair 20 generators while injured. You'll eventually hook 100 survivors, but you have to farm and do specific set of things (farming) to get 4 unhooks during egc, which would basically require communication with the killer.
---
In the event of a good plague, she'll either need to respect pallets hard and get screwed over that way, or commit and hit them and get stunned by a pallet anyways because they run into her and slam it on her face.
---
Then it's back to square one, you wasted the time you took to go get it, you wasted time trying to hit them, and they aren't sick. (Yada yada yada.)
---
The Spirit nerf is looking great!
---
Oni &gt; Billy, for rn at least
---
Make ruin only stall progress, not remove progress.
---
A challenge should be challenging, not artificial difficulty by forcing you to get a nice killer to help you farm.

---
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.
---
Well I know where Darkness Among Us chapter is.
---
It was such a low point for the game.
---
Curtain Call, Stranger Things, or the Huntress chapter are probably at the top.
---
I've been on receiving end of this bug more times then I can count
---
Yes. They can happen. They can happen from the moment you start repairing. It's very unlikely, not impossible.  
---
And if you tap too quickly, no actual progress is made on the repair. The moment you can actually start making progress is the same moment you can get a skill check.  
---
I have seen tons of geniuses sit there and tap on a generator while I completed it, and seemed to feel pretty good about themselves, so I guess there's that.
---
Oni will be getting nerfed before release no doubt
---
The maps havent changed. All the BL spots before the nerf are gunna be the same after the nerf. This just stops the ridiculous god loops the enabled by the passive of the perk.
---
Wait, you can grab people that are standing?
---
Which is YET AGAIN why the don't cleanse "meta" is stupid and only good for the plague! And if she does get her corrupt purge, news flash, stealth exists. Use it.
---
A clown did this to me and some randoms once....with Blood Warden.........we all died
---
Oh of course he will, that's why I said for now
---
But then why do people (like the person I was replying to) complain about things like "Drop 15 pallets during a chase"? Obviously that's going to happen during normal play. How is that different?
---
It can be fun to try save in swf with DS and BT.
---
I'm not interested in explaining to you why NoEd on a Prayer Beads Spirit is overkill.
---
Bubbles looking thicc
---
The basement one doesnt seem so bad with the right build and the right killed. Doing that on Hag, for example, doesnt seem that crazy
---
With a name like that I'd be surprised if you weren't taken . . .
---
That's being said Gamertag is same as on here if you wanna send a FR.
---
Because they've become an important part of the game's experience. They should be accessible to all players. Lore, premium items, that stuff shouldn't be blocked off behind impossible odds, or a grind and a half.
---
You mean how most reasonable and sane minded game devs make challenges or otherwise for their games to make sure it is fun, balanced, and fair for everyone involved with reasonability to accomplish? It sounds like a lot of...
---
100% agree. I think these challenges could be fun. However many people are sweating their asses of trynna get them. The only reason they play is to complete the challenges. 
---
I've seen this happen to fifa this year. The game was (for fifa standards) alright. However to stay competitive, you needed to do lot's of challenges each week. Mang people did it as chores, instead of as actually enjoying the game. If you're interested, you should take a quick look at r/fifa and type in 'mental health'. The amount of posts and upvotes about this are insane. And that just for a game that should bring joy.
---
I know you can't compare dbd to fifa. But the mindset many people have with these challenges really is quiet the same. Let's hope for the best!
---
Well think of the difference in speed between nurse and billy then double it. Its would be ridiculously fast and looping would be impossible
---
Lmfao nice
---
The BOLD assumption here is that balanced landing was balanced. It is the main factor that breaks maps and limits the creation of new ones. Nerf that garbage rather than fix all the problems it creates.
---
I think this game could really benefit from some additional game modes. Everyone talks about 2v8 (which would be awesome) but about some modes that aren’t just repairing gens? How about a mode with several survivors on an altered version of The Game where they have to solve Jigsaw traps? Or an Evil Dead cabin map where the “killer” is someone controlling traps in the environment? An F13-style mode with a gigantic map and multiple objectives/ways to escape?
---
I’d also like voice acting for survivors, in the current fast paced game mode I think it’d get pretty annoying pretty quickly but in another game mode I think it could work pretty well to give the characters more personality. Especially with Ash around.
---
On a normal killer that is 4.6m/s it goes up to 5.8m/s that is entirely too much for any chase let alone 3 out of the 4. Bloodlust 3 is slower than that at 5.2m/s..
---
I’m still wondering how I’m supposed to do three gens by myself in a single trial using dark sense
---
I had a wraith do this to me last night lol, we were chilling and dancing and as soon as the last gen went off I got noed’d and died
---
He actually takes some degree of skill unlike Spirit. If they're gonna rework him at all, they should just fix his insta saw add ons. That's a little overkill.
---
My gt is pretty much the same too lol Mouth2Daneus
---
Hex: Dedicated Server is kinda broken
---
Off topic: anyone know if youll just be able to buy oni or will it be only a whole dlc. Xbox did that with huntress and piggy. Have to buy whole dlc.
---
No not really. Even discounting how it unlocks literal infinites, the problem with BL is it extends chases for free when you use it even while Exhausted. The speed burst is one thing, but every time you land off something and run, you're gaining distance you otherwise wouldn't have had.
---
Sure, it was less useful on certain maps, but BHVR aren't going to rework every single map to fix a single perk when that single perk can be changed and the same effect is achieved. It's unreasonable to assume they'd do otherwise.
---
How does this not have more upvotes
---
He's an original character, so you can either buy the DLC with money or unlock either survivor or killer with shards. Huntress is completely free by the way.
---
I just started watching this show and I'm on season 3. 
---
I love it.
---
Joe is the best legion member, yet i never see him. THE BIG SAD
---
Yeah. Especially if Ruin *isn’t* in play; it’s usually Devour Hope then.
---
Shes not free on xbox
---
He’s not moring someone it’s from the spotlight they did when he was first released
---
Because they like "challenge"
---
We like challenge, which is more than 15, usually, but they like artificial challenge of RNG.
---
Even if they got rid of map offerings when people with balanced landing do end up on Haddonfield it’s still a broken perk.
---
The only two actual fixes would be to nerf the perk or change the map and I’d much rather them nerf the perk then waste time that could be devoted to fixing other issues in the game by balancing an entire map around a single perk. 
---
Plus if they didn’t change the perk they’d have to avoid ever making more maps like Haddonfield and personally I’d prefer one perk to be sacrificed for the sake of map variety. 
---
I fully expect one of the next survivors to get a new perk that gets rid of the fall stagger but doesn’t have the initial speed boost since that would be a bit more balanced.
---
And I’m a survivor main btw before anyone think otherwise.
---
Season 4 is my favorite
---
Wowwwww yes she is. Im dumb
---
I knew I’d seen it before!
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
Um.. okay. Thank you for this, my fellow Redditor.
---
I MUST COOM!!! I'M COOOOOOMING!!!
---
Ah so that's what the trapple was going to be for
---
Nobody is forcing you to do anything. These are all optional challenges. You can either do it legit (which will be rare and difficult- worthy of being a top-tier challenge) or you can cheese it with a friend. In either case, it's optional. Either way you can get all of the rift rewards.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it's for the money honestly. I mean, I like the devs, and I genuinly think they care about their playerbase. But it's still a company
---
Which is incredibly frustrating because they make so many design choices (some of the few good ones) with the idea in mind of making sure it doesn't encourage shitty gameplay ... and then they release these challenges. Like, how can I say with a straight face that BHVR won't change killer pip requirements to automatically grant pips for kills cause it would make the game worse if they're releasing challenges like "hook two people in the basement at the same time with Monstrous Shrine"
---
Search for Lullaby for the Dark on the Xbox store. She is, and always has been, 100% free.
---
This is fucking bad on a meta level. There is zero reason to pick anyone except Meg, ever, then.
---
thanks everyone for your responses! i guess the crows really are useful so i’ll have to pay attention to them more now
---
Yea, but not every single challenge should take a week, or a month in some cases. That's stupid.
---
Only 90s kids remember when no0b3 was able to stream 3x a week :(

---
No problem
---
K
---
Yeah for sure, Insta-Saw is the only busted thing about him right now.
---
Like I said, toolboxes are ridiculous as they currently are and will more than likely be reworked. Better together isn't necessarily a gen rushing perk since the most it'll really do is show survivors what gen you're working on when within a specific range, it's more helpful when your on a gen and all survivors auras are revealed to each other to know who needs to go for the save and who can continue doing what they need to. Spine chill is more of a killer avoidance perk. This is not happening doesn't even work until you're injured and just increases great skill check size (not even by enough to really make that much of a difference).
---
Honestly all you gotta do is go to Family Residence. That map is nothing but tall grass and bamboo.
---
Lol sad little kid
---
I got the self-healing challenge on page 2 by having someone unhook me twice. These are not coded well.

---
He’s going places.
---
Be proud
---
Susie is the best legion member
---
Yes and no. 
---
Against weaker survivors, Ghost face is a terror. 
---
Against good survivors or a Decent SWF, he is weak. He gets dropped out too easily and he cannot do anything to shorten loops.
---
Oh I understand your frustrations completely. I have also felt some of the negative feedback from these challenges. Fucking claudette surge.
---
You can’t be affected by the balanced landing nerf if you don’t make content anymore, amiright haha hah please come back noob3 haha
---
Agreed
---
I am especially since I main wraith myself lol
---
Green ranks are a glorious place of mostly non toxic matches my friend, join me
---
I'm not worried about all these things. If it's a noed killer they probably wont happen to have anyone on death hook. The problem is me having to select the challenge in the Hope's the stars align for me. I'm banking on multiple people being hooked or I'll just try to do a swf and have them get hooked on purpose if I have to. Which I shouldn't have to do.
---
You're all good, you're not the only one I've seen to think that.
---
Obviously! One time, I hooked someone and their teammate came running no less than 5 seconds later, infront of me. I think they wanted to take a hit, then rush to the hook, BT save, the BT fella take the hit, then run. But I just wait in confusion, then when they wanted to save, I just grabbed them. I swear I'm not lying, the game turned into a slug fest in a matter of seconds. Grabbed 2, slugged 1, and another still on the hook
---
"Kick a gen 40 times".
---
How fucking *boring*.
---
The NOED one screams of NOED-Bloodwarden games which is really not what I want to see.
---
You just need to be on the gen when it pops. You don’t have to do the whole gen. (Its badly worded)
---
This is easy to do in a SWF. 
---
Use Bond in solo with perks like Leader. Solo is harder to do.
---
Technically Davy Johns is a folklore character. So they could have Davy Johns as a killer. He’d just not look anything like the movie. Which would be a bummer
---
Yea. But their teammate who would go for the save will cleanse then save if I do that. Not a risk I'm willing to take
---
Huntress, a group of American backpackers visit the forest and get separated from their guide, only to be met with a hulking russian woman with badass hatchets
---
Huh
---
Dude just use you're eyeballs. You could say the same for Freddy. Just because you don't have a blaring siren telling you the killer is there doesn't mean you can't listen for footsteps/breathing for the louder stealth killers or just straight up look around corners with your PoV.
---
Being able to heal myself from the down state when i have a damn medkit in my hand

Like I also said, if you found any of these op I some way, don't just say that it shouldn't be that way, give an example of what it should be like instead cuz then I actually have some way to know what to do instead of multiple people shouting about how I'm ruining a perk in some way
---
....bussy? hahahaha
---
Sorry. Meant for a different post.
---
Well, as the famous poet once said, "if it glows, it goes"
---
Not really, it's because Pig is super effective with zero skill at low levels. People don't understand how her traps work and constantly try to hide the second they hear her terror radius, so her traps kill people constantly.
---
In reality, Pig has a low skill ceiling and randomly effective power. At high ranks she's essentially useless since she has no power that helps chases (and no, before you ask, the Ambush at short pallet loops is perfectly reactable and counterable by any reasonably skilled survivor) and her traps don't slow anyone down. At best, she can guarantee a trapped survivor's death by following them in Ambush mods.
---
Challenges are less trying to implement more varied gameplay and more just "speed bumps" on the rift so that super dedicated players won't clear the whole thing in 3 days. That's why it's one challenge at a time.
---
While outside of some of the leaked 4th tome challenges, I think the single-trial ones are in acceptable shape. I feel that sometimes people forget that challenges are supposed to be, well, challenging.
---
It's those over-grindy "do x things y times" ones that take a century that I quite heavily dislike.
---
100% of the Rift rewards can be gotten without completing a single Tome challenge, or even without winning a single match. All of the lore can be viewed on Youtube. What's wrong with rewarding good play? Do you categorically hate the ranking system as well, as it incentivizes skill?
---
Love the +++ showing that you saved a bunch of screenshots. I do that too and always end up with those +++'s
---
Eh, i wouldn't call him weak. 0 terror radius no red glow is bonkers on some loops.
---
Against a swf hes weak sure but thats literally any killer since they can call out when its safe to be on a gen.
---
I knew that people were going to start complaining after spirit nerf. I swear people can’t mind game killers so they have to be nerfed to the point where it’s laughably easy to juke them
---
Honourable 😊
---
Anytime I see EGC my first thought is egg, so if he wasn’t paying attention to the egg timer he won’t have a very good thanksgiving
---
Late reply but I usually run Bitter Murmur, BBQ, NOED, and I'm All Ears
---
So I'm not the only one who thought + was a good button then?
---
Then give an example of what would be better, quit saying that it's just a nerf and say what SHOULD be done instead
---
Well maybe he's fast, and killer's are all different
---
That’s fine.
---
Making borderline impossible challenges is bullshit.
---
lol i love the """"challenges""""" the emphasis requires 4.5x the amount of quotation marks
---
Good afternoon, what project are you working on today?
---
I'm 99% sure its a longer animation, but its not huge.
---
I did!
---
But people already complain about it promoting grinding. A larger number would promote it more.
---
Well then thats nurfing toxic survivors
---
Is... Is he okay?
---
he's gettin rapped by last minute hero
---
Thanks!
---
New perk:anime speed
---
u only have to bring them to the final 100%
---
I never said keys weren't bullshit. Just that prayer beads are bullshit. 
---
The biggest difference however is that killers get to see before the game starts that a survivor is bringing a key and do not have to play that game.
---
He was recording last night. Check Twitter
---
Even if they have BT or DS it can still be a good idea to whack them if you’ll still be able to go after the unhooked afterwards. 
---
If they have BT it just means they need to waste time mending whilst you go after the unhooker and if they don’t and get knocked down just leave them and chase the unhooker. That way they’re on the ground and aren’t doing any gens and someone else needs to waste time to come and pick them up.
---
Why not? These are optional challenges. Who said they have to be fast? If BHVR renamed them something that implied a longer cycle (like "Gradual Challenges" or something) would that make them better?
---
There's a massive difference between "inaccurate stats", and "broad stats that shouldn't be used in specific cases." This is clearly an example of the latter. In what world is accurate, broad sampling not possible?
---
You're not wrong. Uninspired, lame, meticulous and too many of them rely too heavily on RNG.
---
 Super disappointed with the rewards as well. Half the charms are just recolors, huge surprise there /s
---
Can't use your eyeballs to see him in a jungle gym or in many other loops when there's no red glow.
---
Sure, other killers can hide their red glow. But that requires skill and still gives you more time.
---
I DO NOT!!!!!!!
---
That.. was beautiful 😭💕
---
Looping is toxic? 😂
---
I played a billy and I got all 10 health stayed in one round because he tried to slug but I was there every time with botany and a medkit
---
Get some help
---
Exactly. Knock them down cause it means they aren’t doing gens and someone else has to stop and come heel them whilst you chase the unhooker.
---
That’s three survivors all not doing gens
---
Oh, I’ll be perfectly honest: the Killer challenges seem much easier than the survivor ones. And I am primarily a Killer player. Unfortunately, in addition to not just being an asshole who doesn’t care how hard the other side’s challenges are, I’m likely going to need to complete survivor challenges if I want to complete the pass. There are still five or six challenges I still need to complete from level 2. I’m starting to wonder if I’ll even be able to unlock a second blighted skin.
---
Yes but also where his red light helps him, his lack of tools to end loops quickly and the ability for survivors to take him out of his power balances it out. As well I can see how it'd be a problem when there's multiple people stacked, but solo there's a spot on the gen where you can see him before he gets to you.
---
What is almost worse are the fools who think Oh i HaVe BoRrOwEd TiMe let me unhook instantly after the killer just smashed every pallet in sight, rather than just giving it 5 god damn seconds.
---
This is actually the worst thing about Legion to me. They aren't actually a Legion in game. There's only ever one!
---
Legitimate question: Why doesn’t BHVR just fix the maps that need fixing? I’m fine with the nerf(even though I personally disagree with it), but it just sucks that a once already situational perk has pretty much been rendered useless...
---
With GF, he has no power in a loop.
---
With SWF, you know when to look out for him and where. Killers like him are really weak against SWF. Clown can slow survivors around loops.
---
Hiding the red stain makes him easier to mind game, but good killers already hide their red stain with backtracking. It just prevents the need to backtrack.
---
Bruh, just go watch some Survivor and chill out.
---
haha! even less reason to do that one
---
It’s just a game and if it stresses you that much take a break
---
wrong place, u need 911
---
There are a lot of alternatives to ending it all. Please seek help from someone, the world isn’t better off without you.
---
I use NOED to deal with the toxic pos that tbag at the exit gates, which came in really handy here. And if I got no kills, I wouldn't be a rank 10 killer. It's not a high rank at all, but I certainly wouldn't be *that* high in ranks.
---
It’s happening to me too
---
I have never related to a post more in my life. Seriously tho calm down and get some help if the game effects you this negativity.
---
Grindy != hard. Also, the game has no bots so yeah obviously they play against real people.
---
Presumably in the yellow ranks with that kind of playtime.
---
Well, they currently do neither, so...
---
The stats are aggregates of overall performance which don't take rank or skill level into account. They aren't stratified meaning they're basically useless. 
---
E.g. Leatherface is higher than Nurse in success rate because he's incredibly effective when played against less skilled Survivor as a less skilled Killer, so his win rate is inflated by that skill bracket - in reality he gets destroyed by decent survivors, since his ability offers very little room for a Killers skill to influence his success. Conversely is Nurse - her performance at low ranks in the hands of low skilled Killers is absolutely terrible because her skill ceiling and skill floor are massively high, but at ranks with high skill Killers against high skill Survivors, she's still the strongest Killer in the game.
---
😂😂😂😂...lol...yes could be
---
Man, I've hear at dead by daylight making people angry but not fucking suicidal Holy shit-
---
👌
---
This satiates my Twitch-preferring self. *For now*
---
HOW THE FUCK DO I GET AROUND DEDICATED SERVER LAG? I FUCKING RUBBER BAND IN THE MOST INCONVENIENT TIMES AS SURVIVOR AND KILLER. PING IS 60 IN LOBBY AND I HAVE 40 DOWN/20 UP. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIX THIS SHIT
---
I use them mostly to check back on areas/loops without having to go all the way there. For example, a hook, a gen I regressed, or a totem I chased someone off of, I wanna keep an eye on so that no one comes back. A crow flying away from the place tells me I should go check
---
Finally had a game where I got to Mori every Survivor with a full Devour Hope. It was a truly magical experience that will never, ever happen again. It also helped sink in for me how boring Trapper's Mori is.
---
It sounds like you need to talk to someone. Contact someone who cares about you. Or contact  https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/
---
I was enjoying the challenges as a fun new objective to keep me more engaged with the game, but this tier is just plain stupid. I'm okay with challenges that are hard to do and take a lot of skill. That's not what these challenges are. "Unhook 2 survivor's safely during end game collapse" 100% will not happen unless you are running a full swf group. There is no challenge here. Its just "can you get your friends to do a bunch of bullshit to help you complete the tome?"
---
People can be toxic but looping definitely isnt
---
Also: please name a challenge that takes a month to complete. Are you only playing one match a week or something? If so, the problem is your schedule, not the challenges. They clearly did not design them for people with as busy of schedules as you (nor should they have).
---
1-800-273-8255 
---
Even if you are only exaggerating due to rage give them a call, it’ll do you good and might even help you with coping techniques so you don’t have to feel this way in the future. 
---
Take care and feel free to send me some PMs if you want to talk about things, even if it doesn’t have anything to do with DBD.
---
Tome 4 is going to have "Buy Auric Cells" as a challenge at this rate.
---
The thing is, BL is not even a guaranteed usage in most games. If you get coldwind farm or azarov without hills, when are you gonna use that perk? Basement staircase? It's just a useless perk occupying a slot. I think they didnt do it justice by nerfing it that way. I know one specific large streamer advocate on the daily that BL doesn't "follow" the other exhaustion concept, but where is the rule that says that? It's made that way because the devs knew that BL doesn't work in most maps. So yeah, instead of removing infinites, they nerf it instead
---
You're thinking of the level 4 dark sense challenge which requires more generators than 3. Requires 4 or 5
---
The lack of a red glow helps him and chases quickly. It's easy to get a first hit with him and for him to end chases quickly.
---
nope that’s speed i think
---
wow everyone is answering him so seriously, i figure he's joking?
---
Actually, Haddonfield is the problem, but they nerfed Balanced instead.
---
THE GHOSTFACE DLC ISN'T ON SALE WHEN ALMOST EVERY OTHER DLC IS ON SALE, SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DLCS WITH A KILLER AND SURVIVOR. ALSO THE STRANGER THINGS DLC IS ONLY 20% OFF INSTEAD OF 40 LIKE EVERY OTHER DLC, ALTHOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THE NEW CHAPTER STILL HASN'T RELEASED. I ALREADY HAVE LEATHERFACE DLC BUT THAT'S NOT ON SALE SO I FEEL FOR EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT YET.
---
She's still S tier. People seriously overreacted to her nerf.
---
I don’t know if you’re trying to joke because of the game being frustrating or not but if you truly need someone to talk to I’m all ears. I have felt this way before, but  not because of a game.
---
Go for it, get freddy too!
---
Oh yeah you're right, I just googled it and the sunglasses make it so you can see blood
---
Can we not
---
Once one survivor quitted right when the game started, less than 2 minutes after the other survivors started quitting too, is also counted for the archives, lol
---
They could make an OC pirate.
---
yup
---
Then kill yourself and be done with it lol.
---
If they stay immersed for two minutes and you haven't caught anyone, that's on you. 
---
Corrupt forces people onto your side of the map and means you're almost guaranteed to get into a chase before anyone's touched a generator. 
---
With how long Ruin lasts on average in my skill bracket, Corrupt is a better choice than you think it is.
---
Dude no way. Everyone knows ghostface is next on the list
---
Everybody has to assume he’s serious because a joke about that is poor taste.
---
meg should only have like 1% speed boost
---
This happened to me on Thompson house as the wraith, near was upstairs injured and searching the chest, when i grabbed her I froze long enough for her to finish looting the chest which got her a med kit (no pharmacy) and heal on side of me before I heard her BL out into the corn
---
Completely reset the whole game for me
---
I'm a survivor main. Those don't seem hard to me. 
---
Also, you can do the Killer track and then come up the survivor track backwards, so you don't need to start with the "2x Unhook in EGC" -- Which, admittedly, the hardest challenge there.
---
25 Unhooks isn't hard. Hardest part is fighting off your fellow survivors for them. 
---
2x EGC Unhooks is tough. Not arguing that one.
---
Hope + Escape is straightforward.
---
Blind x5: Well, you know how easy that is, since you're on the bright end of the flashlight enough times.
---
Blind when carrying survivor: Again, you've had to happen enough times. Also, it doesn't specify saving the survivor. A failed Blind save will count.
---
Deplete 8 keys is just item use. Use an Add-On and press M2.
---
Heal 15 Health States is any survivor over multiple games. Run Empathy to find wounded people or self-care and injure yourself. It even counters Inner Strength, Adrenaline, and Plague Fountains on yourself!
---
Heal 4x in one game is also straight forward, since it counts yourself. See above.
---
Escape 10 games is straight forward.
---
Spine Chill escape Unhooked is challenging, but do-able. I don't think I'd have any problem with it, but if you don't really ever play Survivor then it might be on the harder side. Still, if you're high rank enough you should be able to get lucky.
---
All that said, I can at least respect your take on this since you're not just crying "Oh BHVR is horrible! These tomes suck!" You're admitted it's more on your end than otherwise.
---
The Tier 3 challenges are more difficult than Tier 2 or Tier 1, sure. But none of them are impossible, and none of them are deserving of the sheer level of hate and crying they seem to draw out.
---
I cannot possibly imagine Joker in this game. Hopefully that will never come to fruition. DBD and Mortal Kombat don’t need to share all their guests
---
Sitting ur ass and doing 4 gens is skill? The challenges don’t reward good play
---
Imagine calling the least deformed of all the survivors a crack head.
---
Thanks for proving my point again.
---
so you should understand then that it's really rough to play with weak killers
---
PGTW isn't mandatory for Freddy, as he applies pressure well. If you see yourself playing Killer at all, it's good to have options, and they usually sell Killers at way higher prices. Look at the Ghostface DLC.
---
That was me but with the botany knowledge one
---
...........you mean the hobgoblin?
---
No just hit the skill checks 4head
---
I like that I have more things to do but I'm not doing it for rewards because i dont care. I'm doing it for the lore. I'd like it to be changed.
---
*insane laughter stops*
---
If you need someone to talk to I'm here for you. In all seriousness.
---
How? Are you implying chess doesn’t take skill? Chess is just mind games so how is that proving your point
---
I thought queue times are longer when there is more killers
---
Killer is meant to be weaker. I play it for the challenge.
---
I lost brain cells reading this
---
This is going on the front page tomorrow, lmao
---
Git gud
---
The killer (who queued as huntress) spawned in as steve. What have we done.
---
Demigordon, Demygordon, Demugordon. I don't care I'm annoyed about how often I see tjese memes.
---
I honestly play him alot. I have him p3 and it's really a joke half of the time to catch even good survivors without camping or tunneling. They just seem to put themselves up on the hooks.
---
Thanks for your well-thought-out contribution to this discussion.
---
https://youtu.be/MfJesiEM82M?t=339
---
10/10
---
The opposite, hence you proving my point.
---
Like I said originally, giving killers powers that makes them not need to mind game takes away the skill needed.
---
You can’t buy him with shards
---
BBQ is the most important by far. After that, I'd say heavily prioritize the licensed character perks you want, as you can shard-buy anyone else. Given the choice, I'd always unlock through BP over the shrine (which is part of why BBQ is so important).
---
Totally agreed
---
-Re-texturing all the default skins for the older characters. Some of them look really low res compared to what we have now.
---
-Give all the killers their own unique chase music. Doesn’t have to be dramatically different for all of them but just subtle changes would be nice. Like giving the Clown a bit of a circus vibe or the Legion some electric guitars thrown in. Basically like what the do to the menu music with each new chapter.
---
-Update the moris for some of the original killers to make them more unique and creative.
---
No problem mate!
---
Don't quote me on this, but I always thought killers were out numbered by a lot. Idk if that's something you can check tho
---
Nah that's TimTheTatMan
---
you can still mind game him tho, it's just harder. Plus his power can be deactivated in a few seconds and has a thirty second cooldown, so no, he is not op
---
Yes, it's too easy to get kills with Ghostface. Not even a challenge. So idk what your point is.
---
Should I get back into DBD I loved it but after you get all the perks you want there’s nothing really left
---
are u serious? After that sentence i can't take u serious anymore... holy jesus u don't understand the concept of killer vs survivors at all
---
He sucks anyway
---
You should...but I cant say for sure. If the game doesnt run smoothly, then watch a video from the low spec gamer on dead by daylight (its old) but teaches you on configuring it. If your computer is really that bad then it's a gamble of money but I havent seen gameplay of any games on your computer so I cant tell. I use to own a really shit lenovo laptop so I know horrible lag.
---
Nah, you’ve got a decent buffer there. I think we have 42 days left (I’m at work so I can’t verify) so you would be on pace if you were only level 28. That’s an eight day buffer. 
---
I, on the other hand, just hit tier 30 last night. I don’t see my buffer lasting much longer. ☹️
---
ive tried man its not helpful
---
500 IQ Survivor plays.
---
Yeah, after finishing a chase by using his power and hooking, you have your power back.
---
Too op.
---
Yeah, you want all the killers to be equally bad.
---
It's the right of passage.
---
honestly all of his perks are pretty bad.  pharmacy is okayish i guess.
---
I’m nothing without good spelling.
---
Depends if you like playing killer too. But Pharmacy is the second best healing perk in the game (behind IS). Vigil is only good if you’re carrying an exhaustion perk. I wouldn’t really bother too much with Wake Up unless you have Adrenaline unlocked. Quentin is definitely underused, would be nice to see another!
---
r/iamverybadass
---
It's 4 v 1. You got nobody to support you if you make a mistake as killer. It's part of the game design.
---
I fail to understand how you don't see this.
---
From a killer POV, Freddy and Hag are both instant teleports. It clearly shows Demo traversing the upside down when he teleports. But I can see your point.
---
Look man playing a competitive game while you're stressed out isn't gonna help this stuff takes time so take some time to focus on your mental health okay?
---
Yep 100%
---
?
---
If it wasn't in a single trial it would be fine.
---
All to be equally good?
---
Yes, that's what balance is. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
You should try to learn how to play against him before crying for a nerf. Hes literally an m1 killer that can just hid his tr every like 20 seconds and he loses it whenever he attacks or gets stunned. How is that op?
---
Sometimes I think this subreddit just flies into a blood frenzy and gets too carried away with downvotes to read.
---
Because there's a time limit on doing them.
---
i pmed you
---
Fyi every killer and survivor can be purchased separately in game. The chapter needs to be bought on the respective store of whatever platform you are on if its console.
---
u/VredditDownloader
---
I play him a lot. It's to easy to win with him.

---
if only we could care about the 7 or so characters that are almost never used in red ranks, but no, we have to nerf every remotely powerful killer. I guess killers aren't allowed to have a good power because that would make survivors think too much.
---
Nah. I like survivor diversity, however I wouldn't mind introducing this as "passives" that you can apply to survivors like perks
---
They can. Just as long as those things dont make survivors have to think or work for a win.
---
Time in a day is precious. If you wanna sit on your ass and waste your time away in front of a screen doing challenges that are overly hard because they're "rewarding", that's on you.
---
And if you think the ranking system requires skill to hit reds, then I wonder how long you've actually played. I am a GARBAGE survivor, and I'm consistently in reds.
---
yeah making money short term is so worth it, when ppl wont buy season passes anymore, because of how bullshit the whole challenges are
---
Even those who play constantly are still going to take a long time to complete it. If you can only play on the weekends, then you have a lot less time than most. Probably the 4 unhooks during etg in 1 trial is the example.
---
I don't know how to i feel so hopeless like im ready to just fucking end it because i have nothing and i never will
---
steam has a refund system so you can test the game as long as you dont keep it for more then 2 weeks or play it for more then 2 hours.
---
This game is, not hardware friendly. its honestly crazy that 3 years in we still dont have better optimization and more settings options. 
---
if you need help, there are guides on how to edit the settings at a more deeper lvl.
---
Bro those are my exact specs aswell or around it i can run on windowed at low fairly well as long as there arent any fog offerings
---
Psst... he’s saying you spelled “balanced” incorrectly.
---
I'd be fine with a Dark pictures anthology crossover.
---
Maybe the monster from Little Hope
---
Sam from Until Dawn
---
And Conrad from Man of Medan.
---
&gt;!I personally feel that Emily is 100% that bitch and would be amazing in Dead by Daylight but she is heavily overshadowed by the designated final girl, Sam!&lt;
---
Nah my dude, survivor main here - survivors are definitely the bad guys 😂
---
What rank killer are you?
---
Fuck shit mc’cock
---
BHVR claimed those were just placeholders and they'd listen to feedback.
---
Of course that's a blatant lie.
---
Damnit. My bad
---
From a dead game called Deathgarden.  It's going free soon before they kill it off entirely, so you can get the mask for owning both.
---
If I were you then buy the game and test out one normal match. Keep yourself to less than 2 hours of dbd playtime for steams 2-hour refund policy
---
Who’s Storm?
---
I’m that guy
---
I main killer. Sounds like your a surv main.
---
Oh. So he gets the initial hit or flails around it counts as multiple hits?
---
Oh shit you right, but that's if they're on sale or not
---
I hate licensed killers, a random muscled woman with an hokey mask would be fine for me. We could have cosmetics and everything without any problem and license fee.
---
Ah killers. Bitching about the possibility of RNG for a map but when it comes to 'muh hex placement' want the absolute best RNG for them
---
This one is easy. I use it in a toxic build of mine.
---
Is there a mic requirement?
---
That would actually be easy... get 1 sacrifice midgame, down two survivors, bring knock out and deerstalker and bam all done. Nurses calling also maybe
---
Wow, that clown is truly evil.
---
I dont know the last time i laughed that hard. God that end game chat mustve been fun lol.
---
I got a 4K during endgame as Doctor with NOED, Blood Warden, Remember Me, and Bitter Murmur a month or two ago.
---
It's not that brutal if you do a full Endgame Build. Like it'll take a few attempts but down first guy, wait for door to be opened, hook to activate blood warden, down others at the exit gate, hook them too, etc. and you should eventually get it.
---
When hatch was still not closable grabbed a survivor from gen then it changed to a hit and they got out the hatch that was next to gen :/
---
Yes I do, I’ll have to try that
---
Nonono... You must've misread the memo..
---
The entity *hopes* on filling the quota of getting people's *dicks* up and them smashing them.
---
You switched those two words. Much different quota.
---
Unless"completely repair" means 0-100
---
My friend who has been playing dbd for years said they do, so enjoy! 😊
---
Ok so it’s a weird thing. During the day, there aren’t enough survivors to compensate for killers. Which is why chunky queue times exist. However in the night more people want a spook so killers get up in about 20 seconds of ur lucky
---
When you think about it, Demo is straight up copying the Xenomorph. Really, think about it.
---
If you exit this dimension in one place, travel through a parallel dimension, and then re-enter this dimension in another place... I'd give you an honorary teleportation award.
---
Awesome. I like his streams the most. I really don't like watching try-hardy killers with purple and green add-ons. It gets really boring.
---
I will,ty!
---
I am Storm
---
Checkmate, atheists!
---
I feel for them, I don't know what the Devs did but at some point The Game became SO FUCKING DARK.
---
maybe your kind off very wrong (instead of MAYBE Darkness Among Us)
---
&gt; And this would be a paradox, since the kill rate and survival rate cannot both be above 50%. And before you say "you don't need to survive in more than half of your games to get to nor to maintain red rank", then right back at you: "you don't need to always kill at least 2 survivors to get to nor to maintain red rank".
---
What? But that's *literally true*. I'm a rank 1 killer and a red ranked survivor (haven't gotten to 1 yet). Me living or not isn't a key indicator of whether I'm going to pip or not. With killer, 2 kills is usually a depip, 3 kills is the most varied, and 4k is usually a single pip occasionally a double pip.
---
I'm not sure what you were trying to get at by calling it a "paradox". Killer pips are much more heavily related to kills than survivor pips are related to surviving. That's not a paradox, they are literally two different, unrelated pipping systems.
---
&gt; I agree that these stats do not tell us a whole lot about balance, and even less about core game balance (which I do think is survivor-favoured), but they do outright tell us that killers in red rank do kill more than 2 survivors on average. So even if I were to agree with you and say "well of course, to get to red rank they have to do so to begin with", the killers that are there do perform that well - they outperform the survivors there, on average. So it is entirely valid to use these stats to say "it is possible as a killer to perform well in red ranks, most of the players that get there do". Which breaks with the idea around here and elsewhere that playing killer in red ranks means you are getting bullied and lose all the time. If you get to red rank as killer, chances are you will perform well there, since on average a killer that gets there does. It can also be stated that globally, the game is statistically killer-sided.
---
Great, then we agree on most counts.
---
&gt; Which breaks with the idea around here and elsewhere that playing killer in red ranks means you are getting bullied and lose all the time.
---
I never said otherwise
---
&gt; the game is statistically killer-sided.
---
Sure, but being killered sided on a single statistic isn't super meaningful (e.g. nurse is so low statistically despite still being one of the most powerful killers)
---
Or the off-chance of a daily. Sometimes I need to open an exit gate as my least played survivor...
---
Really wish those dailies were Perk based instead of character based. I'd much rather a "Open an exit gate while using [X perk]" than "Open an exit gate while using [this character who has 0 bloodpoints invested"
---
At least I can still run my main with a decent 3 perk build + the 4th required perk.
---
I believe everything before stranger things will be on sale
---
killers all have a rough time
---
u shoulda flashlighted him instead of using the pallet, but that was some good fucking food.
---
Better animations for all survivors and killers 
---
Maybe something like changing stances when in and out of chase like ghostface 
---
Mainly I just wanna see better and cleaner animations and straight up new ones
---
I feel the best way to fix the legion is something about deep wound itself. Like why can I mend a life threatening injury alone but being slashed by a knife requires someone to help me heal
---
i give ur dissertation an A+! im curious why fifa is addictive. i'm 0% into sports games
---
My friend already got the st dlc and well he wants a new killer to play because of the legion nerf
---
The funny thing is, his addons aren’t even that good compared to the rest of the others
---
Freddys a great pick :)
---
Get rid of rotten fields
---
what happens if u escape real life? theres probably a copy of dbd under there
---
Good luck healing with no locker. Those are all Dwights!
---
\#DwightSupremacist
---
I don’t like some of the challenges but this wasn’t isn’t bad at all, just bring an Endgame build. 
---
I brought Remember Me, Blood Warden, and NOED along with Pop just to slow the game down a bit. I had one person dead before the collapse and killed all remaining three during the collapse. I downed them all, opened the gate myself, and then hooked. Didn’t even need to use RM or BW.
---
Or wack the unhooker and don’t let them get extra distance. If you go for the unhooked person you’re increasing their heal time by like 10 seconds at most. during that time the unhooker and easily get to a loop that could last atleast 30 seconds. Aswell, downing this person who just got unhooked is going to be slugged for 60 seconds anyways, you’re essentially allowing the person who unhooked poorly to get distance and potentially get to a safe pallet loop instead of closing the loop quickly, denying the 15 seconds of BT and then going after the person who got unhooked.
---
Legion with the new incredible nerf to them, imo, is worse than Bubba. Bubba is very good at defending hooks, camping, and can potentially insta-down people. With perks that increase his speed, PWYF, he can get pretty scary. Even if you still think he's the worst, small changes could make him viable: make the chili add-ons actually increase speed, maybe make the chainsaw like hillbilly's so the animation plays the instant you fill the bar, and maybe remove the insanely long stun for missed chainsaws. If you want to make Legion better, you would need to completely change their power because all it's good for is info and getting the first hit.
---
AND hope that the killer isn’t close enough to the hook for it to count as a safe unhook TWICE during the END GAME. 
---
Fat chance.
---
You know what? I'm gonna go ahead and say it, I'd like some single player experience other than the tutorial. I have had the problem of other survivors looping the killer around the gen I'm working on, the locker I'm in because I'm on fucking death hook, or around my fucking hook more times than should ever be expected by a fucking pessimist and as a killer, I've had it with meta perking immersed SWF that will go several minutes without making any progress and just hides the entire fucking match. I've had it with chaotic stupid players that unhook infront of the killer, just give us the option to say "Fuck it, I'd rather have AI on my team." or you just want senseless murder.
---
I know I'm not disagreeing with that, I was just saying that the passive part was a trade off for not being able to use it as much as the others.
---
I just started playing again, the last time being the day before Stranger Things / Dedicated Server update, and I've been randomly disconnected from 2/3 of my games so far. My guess is it's just an issue with the servers. Hopefully they fix it, because I've never been one to DC no matter how bad things look; it would be a shame to get banned for something that's out of my control. I have 500Mb/s download as well, so I'm guessing it's on BHVR's end. In those games, I've had teammates randomly dc too, even without ever being spotted by the killer and while we were on our way to victory.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I've seen a lot of posts recommending punishment for DC'ing, and while I would have agreed in the past when the game was P2P, nowadays, it seems that it's most likely not even players leaving due to salt. I would like to see the servers get up to a stable state before any punishment for frequent DC'ing is implemented.  
---
Side note: if anybody knows a possible fix for constantly getting disconnected or if the devs are even aware of this, do let me know.
---
I never kill anyone with billy, so I take this kinda seriously.
---
Don’t do it, it will send you to the campfire then your stuck there forever!
---
Probably just forward your bills to the hatch.
---
5% increased movement speed holy fuck what the fuck
---
Rotten fields has more pallets and looping spots than swamp but the corn is trash
---
Oh shit!
---
The Entity probably knows already considering it killed them.
---
Yes, and if someone gets stuck on a wall and get hit a second time while getting that burst of speed from being injured, the enduring effect was for nothing.
---
Demodoggy, dedogorgo, demegorbo, dedegorgro, dedmorgorgron

Anyone who uses Balanced Landing knows there’s plenty of maps/loops where BL is overpowered, Haddonfield is just the worst offender. You could run some nasty loops on:
---
The Game
---
Grim Pantry
---
Pale Rose
---
Mother’s Dwelling
---
Temple of Purgation
---
Ironworks of Misery
---
Coal Tower
---
Hawkins Lab
---
Badham Preschool
---
Father Campbell’s Chapel
---
Disturbed Ward
---
All of those maps have at least 1 spot where Balanced Landing is too efficient at extending loops. And you can say that it’s only one spot on the entire but a smart survivor who has BL is going to run to that spot every time and abuse the hell out of their perk. And sure you might get a map like Groaning Storehouse with no hills or places to use BL but having a perk either be useless or overpowered depending on the map is bad design. I think most people can agree that the perk will now be useless for the most part but you should also be able to agree it is currently too strong on certain loops. This myth that Balanced Landing is only overpowered on Haddonfield is just wrong.
---
There could be noed but they are exposed from tier 3 unless its forever myers
---
It’s more of a killer perk, wastes so much time whilst you could be on a gen, plus wastes a slot as majority of time you have access to heals. Not worth it.
---
I also like to do locker jukes like these but never taken it as far as this. Kudos to you good sir.
---
Yeah the does sound like a oversight. That needs to be fixed.
---
Isn’t that the definition of teleportation?
---
Never use self care
---
I'd play him but the fact that he shares Frank's voice is off putting so I avoid it
---
You got a splinter? You should really be more careful around jagged pieces of wood.
---
Distressing and that one terror radius addon
---
It’s glitched and only counts one per game. So to do it, you’d actually have to play 15 matches. 
---
I’ve gotten 10/15 but the game has only counted 4.
---
This is my first night back on the game since the day before the Stranger Things update and I've been randomly disconnected from 2/3 of my games so far (on PC, 500Mb/s connection). These servers just don't seem to be the most stable unfortunately. I hope the devs are aware of this and have a priority to fix it before they implement any punishments for DC'ing.
---
Ordinarily I'd agree that makes sense, but it's Leatherface landing what should be an instant down technically twice. Cut him some slack.
---
Yeah, because fixing the game is absolutely free. It’s not like all the devs need money so they can keep working. That’s preposterous!
---
She's just smiling because thinking about puppies, kittens, cinnamon rolls, flowers, and making new friends; you can't convince me otherwise.
---
You should get a better game. And maybe support.
---
Me and the killer waiting for the last person to die on the hook so he can give hatch
---
It just nullifies a game mechanic that applies to every other killer. I see it as an exploitation tbh.
---
Look at what you titled the post, mate.
---
no
---
Eh, it was still early in the game. Figured I’d conserve some charges and slap em with a pallet. And it’s Giorno’s theme from JoJo’s Bizarre Adventures.
---
O.J. Simpson - The Juice
---
even better: convince them that ure just playing around and theyll let u trap them. just dont hit or down or hook anyone, or it wont have the playing around effect. also use hex ruin and cover it with traps. thats the zone u can then play around with them in, as theyll all gather around ruin and see that ure not hitting anyone
---
This is too cute! I love it! :D
---
Oh, this is why it takes forever to find matches!
---
Nononono, you mixed up the manager’s name. You’re thinking of the Entity’s brother, the Hentaity. He runs r/dbdgonewild
---
I mean she DOES kill people at some point doing that enough destroys your innocence

“As long as you are in a chase with a survivor for 70/60/50 seconds with a survivor, Spies from the shadows activates

---
Can someone fill me in? Did BHRV nerf balanced landing?
---
I believe it’s okay as it is right now. I do like your other ideas though
---
how tf will kate work and tapp/ sleepy boi might be a main
---
I only ever solo queue but I got into a lobby with several other rank 10s about a month ago. We completely dumpstered this person playing killer. I could tell something was not okay when I noticed they weren't lunging at all. In post game I finally saw what was up, the dude was rank 19 and probably didn't have more than 30 minutes in the game. He said it was only his second killer game but was really upbeat about the loss. I wished him well in learning the game and apologized that matchmaking had done that to him. He said he wasn't bothered by it but I told him that enough games like that would really ruin his taste for the game (and especially his positive outlook). I hope that guy is doing better now.
---
on the other end of the spectrum i think i somehow got negative karma for that because now ill be rank 9 getting lobbies with rank 15 and 16 survivors, please stop this bhvr.
---
Y'know, You and your team have to seriously fuck up to all end up in the basement against Bubba. Usually once you know the killer is bubba hanging out in the basement its best to just gen rush and gtfo lmao. How did this happen?
---
Looks like at least one of the Survivors got camped, left onhook, or killed themselves.
---
It's alright, we shall grant forgiveness :)
---
rj/ Toddposting at this time of year at this time of day in this part of reddit localized entirely within this subreddit?
---
uj / Hello fellow r/Gamingcirclejerk user.
---
:)
---
Agreed. Some of these could have been more creative instead of leaning on the tedious side, but there's nothing unreasonable and the idea for most of those is for them to be done naturally as you play the game.
---
Unfortunately they are limited in what they can ask because certain perk/build combinations would place newer players at a disadvantage as they don't have many perks.
---
Necromorphs, Dead Space
---
Stats say the game favors killers after sooooo many months of killers complaining on the subreddit that "thE gAme FaVORs suRVivoRS!".   
---
Hard truths when they realize they were wrong all this time.   
---
For those who understand the stats, then only thing vague is their understanding of game balance, and the only thing pointless is continuing to argue otherwise.
---
The one for dark sense in the second one says completely repair and I got it having only been on gens when they were completed.
---
I've actually been making a document full of fan made ideas, and some ideas like this are on there. Dm me your email and I'll share it with you
---
Thanks, that’s what I was thinking just wanted to see other opinions
---
Sacrificed 1 found the last 3 working on a gen together. Hit Laurie, she runs, hit Claudette, she runs, get body blocked by the bill and hear the hatch sound. Hit him, and they all 3 jumped in. Fun mechanic.
---
They’re going to. Basically, the passive won’t be able to activate while exhausted.
---
I agree. I hope that BHVR buffs it back once they fix map designs, because Balanced landing was a perk that saves a potato like me 5 more seconds of surviving. :)
---
Wait.. Now see... I always get Hentaity with Hentality mixed up...
---
Which one is the death by chickens?
---
Just being Iri Head and hit one hatchet and you complete the challenge
---
Ohhh shitt. Well thanks for letting me know!
---
Here’s what’s EVEN shittier about how hard they are: the rewards do not scale. You get the same BP and Rift Shards per challenge as you do T1. It’s fucking stupid.
---
throw rank in the garbage where it belongs and move to an hour based matchmaking system, there is quite literally no point for a ranking system when it means nothing and even complete braindead survivor players hit red ranks by just stealthing around
---
as a solo player, i get matched with rank 16s and 15s despite being rank 9 myself and they are almost ALWAYS sub 50 hour players that have no fucking clue whats going on, its infuriating
---
id rather get matched with other survivor players that are within 100-200 hours of my survivor playtime and play against killers that have roughly the same number of hours in killer playtime
---
Sadly. Hope they buff it back after maps are fixed. One idea they could make is that if you are exhausted the recution only gives 50%.
---
It's not disappearing from on spot and moving to another, it's running quickly through a tunnel. The Nurse isn't teleporting either, she's just moving insanely fast from point A to point B- as evidenced by the fact that we zoom when blinking as the Nurse and you can see her disrupt the air from the movement. Hag and Freddy are instantaneous, though my original point was that *maybe* Hag was moving **really** fast through the ground to her trap like Demo, since she sinks into the ground and rising back up to inhabit the illusionary body, and she can't teleport if the illusion isn't sprung, making it a sort of gateway like Demo's tunnels
---
I'd say more rework than nerf. He has advantages he doesn't earn, particularly seeing players who reveal him and not losing stalk making it more reward than penalty, but he's not excessively powerful at higher ranks.
---
Not sure if it's broken or not, but the Iridescent Age challenge (earn 15 Iridescent quality emblems) is not recording correctly. Played a few games now where I have earned two but it's only counting one. Not a huge deal but it makes the challenge much more grindy if it's only counting one per game. Has anyone else noticed this?
---
Yes. Basically, you still can land and get the sprint burst with the 75% reduction, along with 100% noise reduction, but the passive has been removed ;-;
---
A werewolf
---
Farmer John when he plays surv
---
Concept and suggestions should be removed if the reposter doesn’t give credit to the original creator.
---
Dudddeee you could've played around him, Idk why you're complaining, you could've like used your stalk mechanic and went through bill then closed the hatch, Honestly you're just a cry baby (I'm kidding by the way I'm trying my best at acting as a survivor main that doesn't understand the pain)
---
If you like him just for his clothes the buy the full chapter, you only get his second outfit with the beanie if you buy the full chapter, it’s an exclusive for not buying it with cells
---
Agreed. Especially since lots of perks/builds are behind locked characters. It'd be unfair to include anything like "DS the killer x times."
---
Of course, there are people who don't play one side or the other that will have a hard time on the opposite track, but that's more their own choice than anything.
---
How are you getting downvoted for the exact statement everyone wanting Spirit nerfs was making?
---
I am a Killer that uses blood-pools.
---
Fuck you.
---
There are very few killers where that isn't the case. Also if you don't play both sides you really have no grasp of how hard/easy it is to get hits off or avoid hits. Ghostface is easy to get that first hit off, but so is every other killer, save for trapper, billy, doctor, leatherface and demo. As well every killer can end chases quickly if they know what they're doing. Hiding the red light isnt the only factor in finishing chases. Compared to other killers he has nothing in his kit to quickly end chases.
---
Had me in the first half not gonna lie.
---
Reworks are either nerfs or buffs.
---
But yeah, his stalking power is useless. I never use it.
---
It's not the challenges, but their implementation. "Do in one trial" combined with only selecting one at a time makes them very grindy, and so common and pressuring for completion.
---
Most of it is damn near impossible as a solo survivor
---
Can someone post all the challenges? If someone already has send me a link please
---
2nd person went for a save, didn't realise he had insidious. 3rd person went for a save, didn't realise he had insidious.  
---
so I decided to go for a save too because there's literally nothing else to do in the game other than go next lmao
---
One time I had 3 people dead, found the last person before they got the hatch. I downed them and them shut the hatch so I could get the bp from it and then hook them for the "late sacrifice" and they had adrenaline and reopened the hatch. Yesterday I had the bug where the hatch is open for survivors but closed for me and making no sound for me, I found the survivor near the hatch and they pointed at me t-bagged and went into it.
---
It'd be nice if they buffed Huntress' Lullaby to not be a hex. Then it'd actually be a viable rival.
---
Oh I forgot you get exclusive clothes if you buy the pack, I'm gonna wait until Friday and buy the pack bc of the black Friday sales
---
been killing myself on first hook vs these types of people
---
if the game ends fast enough they wasted more time waiting in queue than they spent playing the game
---
i take my personal wins where i can get em
---
It's okay, You only lost one game theres way more to come!
---
Next 50 games: *4 survivors escape using key*
---
Because the community is full of many hypocrites.
---
Probs only freddy then
---
Oof. F
---
It can be okay in the low levels when your team plays super immersed and doesn’t heal each other but once you get to the higher ranks where your teammates are good you can look to them for heals and depend on Adrenaline instead.
---
Hiding red glow is really powerful.
---
Use Inner strength.   
---
1000 BP for cleansing a totem.

Oh it will be worse with tome 4

It's just a fucking game, bro. I can make you angry but how the fuck it can make you commit suicide? Take a break and chill.
---
What’s infectious do again?
---
Don’t you put that evil on me
---
I just want a werewolf killer. All these killers keep coming out, like the Pig, Legion, Demogorgon, and now the Oni, and I keep thinking how some of their abilities would have been fitting for a werewolf. Now I'm not sure how they would add one while keeping it's power unique, but fuck I'll still take one.
---
I honestly don't see what the issue is, they were obviously just testing out the new prayerbeads on the ptb.
---
Yeah I understand that. My montages I've posted showed me that sometimes simple is better. I posted a short montage of Dwight and it did well. I tried to post a more complicated montage that went from the original 3 mins to 7 mins and almost no one wanted to watch it.
---
SCP 682 or any SCP
---
YEAH I DON'T LIKE THE CHALLENGES AND THE WAY THEY'RE INPLEMENTED. EVEN IF I'M NOT GOING TO FARM, MY TEAM WILL AND GAMES ARE GOING TO BE FUCKED FOR AT LEAST A WEEK.
---
THEY'RE ALSO FUCKING DIFFICULT OR MONOTONOUS FOR NO REASON. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY PUT IN NO THOUGHT BEHIND THEM AT ALL.
---
IM GUESSING THEY MADE AN INTERN COME UP WITH THEM AND HE HAD TO DO IT IN A "SINGLE WORK DAY."
---
Spirit is OP and especially with certain add ons damn near guarantee a 4k unless like me, you just farm and 2 hook because you feel bad. The speed of which she moves undetected and with certain perks it's not even worth trying. I don't blame people for DCing and anyone that disagrees is a killer main like most killer mains that don't think any killer is OP. I'm a solo player so I'm speaking from solo perspective and I also think SWF is different all together. I really think DBD needs to just allow communication between survivors since killers are balanced around SWF teams.
---
Your team really dropped the ball there by assuming a LF wouldn't have insidious, sorry to hear it. Feels bad.
---
If you notice a key, either bring a mori or defend those gens like your life depends on it
---
It's also something every killer can do without effort.
---
I was made for this challenge
---
I'm here to remind you to play you're daliy does of huntress matches.
---
Can we at least get the survivors and killers challenges separated or like.. have one of each set at the same time so i dont have to keep switching back and forth when my wife and i swap off every other match?
---
something like this doesn't make me mad or anything, I enjoy the gameplay process. sometimes you stomp, sometimes you get stomped.   
---
I posted this as a meme as I am absolutely sure there are others experiencing this fun with the new challenges.  
---
that, and this is probably the 20th leatherface I've vsed today hahahah
---
Nerf Ebony Mori, and then we can talk about keys.
---
Stick to the montages
---
Honestly its hard as fuck to see keys when survivors are carrying them. They really need to stand out more so I can bring franklins or a mori beforehand. I'll inspect every lobby before readying up and swear I saw no key, but according to end game results someone snuck one in.
---
I usually hate using moris but I’m really starting to consider it
---
They're very easy to miss without Spies from the Shadows.
---
And a Hi-diddly ho-diddly Hydra Dominatus to you, too.
---
No, it requires skill. And you sacrifice your vision, which survivors can exploit.
---
I’m not going to lie I played a match as wraith and I was only in there to get the kicking gens and pallets 40 times and a Jane teabaged me. So I killed her and farmed with everyone else
---
I will gladly trade moris for keys. Only bad killers use moris
---
Am I wrong or could Monstrous Shrine apply to every hook and it still wouldn’t be a very good perk.
---
Piggy, I’ve got your number,
---
I need make you mine.
---
Piggy, don’t change your number,
---
867 - 5309!
---
You really dont even need to play the game to get it. Realistically 9/10 survivors will say yes to challenge farming, so you dont even need friends to do most of these. Especially since the entire community seems to hate the challenges I doubt many people will say no to farming
---
Great editing! I’m nervous tho did the dude mend himself before it ran out?
---
40 generators? Even if you repaired all 5 gens in one game and you would need REALLY shitty teammates for that which are probably gonna end up dead, thats gonna take 8 games.
---
Survivors:
---
 
---
- Rank 1
---
- Rank 16 (paired with Rank 1)
---
- Rank 14
---
- Rank 13
---
Killer: Rank 5.
---
Killer catches the Rank 16, who is Hook-rushed by the Rank 13. Both go up on the hook. The 16 dies to struggle phase while the 13 kills himself.
---
The killer then finds the Rank 14 and hooks them. The rank 1 saves them, but the killer finds and hooks the 14 again. The 14 goes to struggle and ends up dying.
---
The Killer finds the hatch before the Rank 1. Killer then finds the Rank 1 at the exit gates, but before the gates are open. Rank 1 Loops the killer but dies to the EGC.
---
Killer killed all 4 people! And it's a Red Ranked Killer in a Red Ranked Game. So this counts for your statistics that prove so very fucking much, doesn't it?
---
Matchmaking is shit. Your stats prove nothing.
---
Honestly I wish it was either "stuff you do anyway" (see: "get bloodpoints" challenges) OR these hyper difficult super challenges. Just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when its trying to be both
---
....you don’t need to do all challenges to get epilogue?
---
If you're moonwalking correctly, you wouldn't be able to see the survivor anyways, so it really doesn't matter. Plus if you know the surrounding area then you can just navigate muscle memory.
---
What’s the nerf, or at least patch notes
---
I hate using mori's too, but if they're using big boy stuff then theres nothing stopping US from using big boy stuff
---
Nerfs and buffs are number changes, or very slight tweaks.
---
Reworks fully alter major mechanics, and often have both upsides and downsides.
---
Stalking seems completely usable; he just also doesn't need it.
---
I know right?
---
Then someone will complain about the devour hope they let me get 5 stacks of instead of looking for it when it was 3 stacks.
---
Fair point.
---
I hate this argument so much considering to be able to mori someone you have to meet the requirement of already catching and hooking them. Keys have no such requirement, just wait for your team to bang out enough gens or fuck off and hide in a corner, then escape with no effort. Killers atleast have to put in minimum work to mori, one survivor can just hide all game while his team does the work.

Aw, damn. Well, u guys get it (?

Got a 0k because I’m awful
---
Ghost boy should be up there
---
Yes, that makes it require a lot of skill. Something Ghostface completely removes.
---
When a survivor is downed, all other survivors in your terror radius scream and you get a noise alert originating from them
---
 Tunneling people with key's. Small price to pay for salvation
---
Reworks either make the killer better or worse than he used to be. He is either nerfed or buffed.
---
This sadly is plausible
---
&gt; A perk that allows infinites on one or two maps  
---
2 out of 33 maps yup.
---
&gt; and but is basically useless on others should not be in the game 
---
Balanced landing has been meta without infinites forever now. It's only useless on like 2 maps and then really limited on some others. You're completely lost here.
---
Now putting 2+2 together. We see that BL is more likely to be useless than OP
---
It helps if you don't wait til The Last Minute.
---
See what I did there? Because the name of the challenge is The Last Minute Challenge, but I used the phrase the last minute in a joke about a meme referring to The Last Minute Challenge, which is funny because waiting until the last minute is what The Last Minute Challenge refers to while my joke also refers to this...
---
I'm so lonely.
---
Use plaid flannel of pc, if you're on console then increase you're sensitive and prediction.
---
Unhook 2 survivors in the endgame collapse. By the time the collapse starts most people are gonna run for the exit gates and not look back. And you have to pray no one else goes for those unhooks or that people aren’t dead on hook. And this needs to be completed in the same trial
---
Most people don't think it needs a nerf.
---
Gamers helping gamers! Thanks dad :,)
---
Haddonfield is actually a pretty good map for Trapper, in my opinion. Lots of potential for trap placements due to the narrow pathways and the windows that lead to the balcony. Got that challenge done on my first try thanks to that map.
---
As a survivor main I say he doesn’t need nerfed
---
That’s 100% different then keys or ebony mori. To just even consider Devour Hope up there is stupid and people don’t have a problem with it. Most the time the perk doesn’t even get to the mori stage unless you’re playing with bad survivors. 
---
Don’t even bring it up next time in something like this....
---
Other than the requirement of completing generators? Are you okay?
---
LMAO.
---
You: "Keys have no such requirement"
---
Also you: "bang out enough gens"
---
People hate keys due to their ability to create multiple escapes, such as the rare instance in the video above, and you're here complaining about the idea that ONE survivor can escape once their team is dead? 
---
Gens aren't going to do themselves, bud.
---
I have legit gotten hatemail over devour hope. He’s not wrong
---
You're adopted

It'll never work. You can't make these too strong cus it'll make everyone main the meta character and if they're small differences then they may as well not exist
---
Wasnt the perk bad before they added the stun decrease? What do they expect to happen?
---
this is cool and all but wtf is the pig’s cloak doing?
---
You don't play killer do you?
---
***BLEND***
---
That's one. Not disagreeing with you there.
---
Now, for my question of "Which **ONES** are hard?"
---
Cause you said "There challenge**s** are harder than their achievements. I figured since you used the plural that you had more than one challenge you think is difficult.
---
So unless you just think that one challenge is hard, I'd expect you have more, right? Cause if 1 our of 19 challenges is hard, I think the challenges are pretty okay, right?
---
Coward
---
Ooooo that hurts, that’s why No0b3 and why I used it mostly
---
It’s only a small amount of people. Even most survivors I’ve seen claim Devour Hope isn’t bad because you have to hook 5 people for a mori which takes longer unless you play against idiots. 
---
And lastly it’s a hex totem once they know you have exposed everyone tries to find it. 
---
Only people that really complain about it are the ones you shouldn’t listen to because they complain whether they win or lose.
---
that's a reed richards level stretch, surely
---
Speaking of loadouts, being able to save "x" number of loadouts would be nice. Even like 3 or so would be enough, I've always wanted this.
---
Usual dlc price is 8 dollars
---
Hi Dumb-Person-onReddit!
---
Pyramid Head.
---
To be fair to him sometimes the one that escapes is the one that did the least
---
I main killer, do you not?
---
Or, now pace yourself with what im about to say because its going to be a lot.
---
Or you could play both however much you like and dont need identify as one or the other.
---
H m  m
---
Even that's super sketch if you're not in a SWF.
---
It is pretty legit ngl
---
Which can be done by hiding without a key.
---
Ah I see. Thank you btw.
---
With this type of perk setup you pretty much always know where they are if your in your shock therapy, ima try this build out now.
---
Ah ok thnx
---
I only Mori for that sick 60k daily ritual.
---
Trueeeeeeee
---
I’m jumping in, boys! I’m saying goodbye to everyone right now!
---
Oh I totally agree with you that most don’t have a problem with it. But I’m not surprised by what some people complain about anymore. And I stopped listening to what my opponents had to say a long time ago
---
You could colour in the drawing with wax then just wash dye or something over it all, super quick.
---
One of my first times playing trapper was because of these tomes, I found he was rather easy to 4k with and today I even got my first perfect with him! (Side note, been playing Myers for a month with no perfect score, played trapper for 2 days and got the perfect score)
---
Agreed. Just playing devils advocate
---
Ima try this
---
It happens to me all the time on Xbox
---
Yea I’ll bust one out for that. Usually only a green though. Ebony is too busted to feel fair
---
Exactly and the small minority that have a problem with it are usually ignored by everyone including the devs, unless a dev is in that small minority group.
---
Np
---
For stealth killers it works well. The crow is scared and tells you where they are if they fly or you use spies
---
Zsaez from DC comics. When he moris you he carves another tally mark into his skin
---
Those statements are just, like, your opinion, man.
---
Pick rate is because of the archive challenges. Pretty sure last time he wasn’t top 5.
---
But yes, that aura reading is immensely annoying. Especially on Ormond and when you use Black Tar, it’s like I can’t even see it lol
---
Original image from [this Tweet.](https://twitter.com/ascie/status/1197987469746196481)
---
Got it this way as well. In addition, for every challenge I did afterwards until I turned off the game, I got an extra point counted towards it for no reason.
---
Are a GF main, only good one is the night shroud recovery. Everything else is a joke - considerably decreases getting scene barely works. I get caught out by people still outside my terror radius wtf. I don’t know why he needs to be nerfed ugh
---
I’m on Xbox too. I’m not sure why it’s happening.
---
I just assume the ones that complain about it don’t play killer and don’t realize how hard it is to keep it protected to pull it off.
---
Slug everyone, then open the door yourself works too.
---
Yes yes yes!
---
Ok, if it’s a final rebuttal you want. 
---
I know a bit about japanese culture because I’m interested in all cultures. 
---
Did you know Mayans had a sport very similar to basketball? 
---
Or what about Buzkashi, A dangerous sport in the Middle East that involves men on horseback trying to capture a corpse of a calf
---
Or what about Orishas, spirits from Africa, blue colored ones are calm but red ones are angry and aggressive.
---
I know about kitsune masks and kappas because of my interest in worldwide cultures, not because I’m a weeb
---
Surge/Surveillance combo on stealth killers is already run by top players like Fungoose; I'm not sure if it needs a buff. If it caused faster regression it would be extremely powerful with Thrilling and/or Pop. They have to tap it and give you additional pop regression on top of Surge regression, or it regresses super fast? It would be a very powerful gen stopper.
---
I had to use botany knowledge for a challenge, so I equipped empathy, botany, self care, and we'll make it. I also had a purple med kit with increased healing speed and extra charges. Felt like an actual medic lmao
---
How long have you been playing the game?
---
Predator
---
Earlier all 4 of us spawned next to the hex ruin, like it was just sitting right in front of where we all were. Killer gets looped for a bit so I tried to destroy the totem, he ends up giving up the chase and coming for me but in the time it took him to try and catch me the ruin was gone. So he relentlessly chases me for the duration of 3 gens getting done. Hooks me, and just sits right in front of me. I get unhooked because two people made a play to unhook at the same time and had the bill perk so I try to run and he just tunnels me instantly again. I get chased for the last two generators and the exit door, with a scoops a hoy trying to body block the killer for the last two generators. The wraith just wouldn’t swing at all at him, just wanted me and I wasn’t even the one who broke the totem. Shit like this infuriates me
---
They already don't use likenesses from actors so for once this would be a positive. Looking forward to the copyright immune "Dark Waters" with off-brand Davy Jones.

Thank you! And yeah, everyone recovered.

I just it’s the terrible Xbox servers
---
Is this a reference or something?
---
"the hardest ones are really fucking borderline unfair hard for anyone not red rank" hell it'll be hard for red  ranks as well
---
I still feed bad about it. Sorry but it was a touchy subject.
---
What the hell about lore...? This BS ......
---
GHOSTFACE IS UNREVEALABLE! STAND STILL LOOKING AT HIM AND HE STILL EXPOSES YOU! FUCK GHOSTFACE
---
While I agree with the sentiment and all, I will upvote mostly 'cause you took the time to paint Meg's hair purple.
---
^
---
Well, he is getting more kills than Spirit. Therefore, he technically is overperforming and should get a nerf. That is, if we follow the same logic, which I don’t agree with
---
Notta clue
---
The red glow mindgame potential is a big part of his power, and grab animations in general are completely hit or miss for killers.
---
if you think like that then you also think moris are balanced then?
---
The screwed up part is that you can do like a 'unhook 3 Survivors as X' daily for 35k BP.  
---
That unhook challenge is over 8x as grindy and rewards 5k less bloodpoints.
---
What. The.  Hell. BHVR.
---
Its not like haddonfield is the only map that balanced landing busted.  It opened up infinites on a pretty decent amount of maps and it also made mounds ridiculously safe places to heal
---
It doesn’t really help if you can be canceled out rom ur power at many given time. And the ultra rare addons are bs. See the aura of survivors outside of your terror radius for 4 seconds doesn’t really help that much, since I don’t slug
---
Do you not get sarcasm? I guess it’s a bit hard to detect it when reading
---
I agree. Each time you complete something it should web out two different ways for the next challenges... one being a simpler one like a daily with appropriate BPs and one being a more challenging one that might be worth more points. Once you complete one, the other option goes away. I think they should have survivor rifts and killer rifts too, not have it integrated. But that’s just my opinion of course. I love to play the game but I don’t care much about the difficult rift challenges. It’s supposed to be fun!
---
This. This. You summarized all my own thoughts beautifully
---
One thing that gets me is the lockers. They're all copy-pastes of each other. It's the same pattern, the same color, the same grungy textures. It's so sad to see this potential forgotten
---
It’s clearly subjective, so I’m not gonna rebuttal your opinion. I’ve played a ton of games with him, and they are not OP to me.
---
Its not even worth the time to even rank up. And whats the point of having ranks in a game like this?
---
They need gens done to even get the hatch to spawn, and then have to find the hatch. Just like Mori needs a survivor hooked at least once. Sounds like you're complaining just to complain.
---
Oof I’m pretty sure people use “/s” when talking sarcastically idk
---
I feel that
---
Again, I didn’t think I would have to clarify, but that was sarcasm
---
100% agree.
---
If he wanted you to step in his traps then do it to get it done and over with. Only needs to do it 5 times and if you were all there you can all heal each other and just keep going. Is that so hard?
---
\&gt;:(
---
Which ones are hard? Other than the "Unhook 2 survivors in EGC."
---
Like, really... Which ones are difficult. Write them down. Put them in a list. Because I want to know exactly what to laugh about when I'm laughing at you.
---
- 40 Gens/Pallets: 5 gens/pallets a game is 8 matches. Is passive. You said you're fine with those.
---
- 15 Basement Hooks: 3 a game is 5 matches. Is passive enough, made easier with certain perks. Assuming you're fine with this.
---
- 2x Hook Obsession: Just as passive as any others. The survivors will even provide the Obsession perks for you. You're fine with this one, right?
---
- EGC Sacs with NOED: This one is real easy. Gens done, NOED on, slug remaining survivors, open door, hook survivors. It just requires you to play NOED. Restricting 1 perk while letting you play your build otherwise isn't really that bad, right?
---
- 6x Interrupt: Passive again, although made easier with certain killers. Remember that Vault Grabs (Windows/Pallets), Locker Grabs, and Unhooking Grabs on top of Generator Grabs. So you're fine with this, right?
---
- 5x Bear Trap: Passive with Trapper, who is free. So you should be okay with this. Of course, this is the easiest to farm as a friendly killer, so shouldn't be an issue either.
---
- 25x Unhooks: Passive. You mentioned it yourself as fine.
---
- Escape with Hope: This is passive enough, isn't it? I mean, you're trying to escape anyways... You're just restricted on 1 perk. You can still play as your normally would, right? So you should be fine?
---
- 15 Iridescent Emblems: You're okay with this already.
---
- Kill Obsession 7 times: These include sacrifices, so it's as passive as they come. So you're okay with this one, right?
---
- Unnerving Presence: Restricting 1 perk but allowing normal gameplay is still okay, right?
---
- 5x Blinds: Well, most survivors know how to do this. Just bring a flashlight and it's passive play, right?
---
- Heal 15 states: This works on you and other survivors. It counts Inner Strength, Plague Pools, and even Adrenaline. This one's passive, right?
---
- Heal x4 in 1 game: Like above, but 4 in a match. It's simple and straight forward enough, right? You're normally healing others or yourself anyways, right? So this one should be considered passive enough, right?
---
- Blind while carrying Survivor: This happens so often for anyone carrying around a flashlight. Note it doesn't specify needing an escape, just the blind while carrying. A failed Pick-up flashlight blind will count.
---
- Deplete 8 keys: Equip item, Equip add-on, hold M2. If this isn't passive, I don't know what is.
---
- Escape 10 trials: You are trying to do this anyways, right?
---
Not okay with:
---
- Monstrous Shrine: This one requires some specific playstyle along with a pretty useless perk. So I suppose this one isn't as passive as you'd like it to be. It's certainly not difficult, since most any Basement Build will have 2 people hooked in the basement at once at one point of time. And I suppose even non-Basement Builds will also do the same through some luck/set-up... But it's not passive, even though it's not difficult, so you're not okay with it.
---
- 2x EGC Unhooks: Okay, I'll agree that this one is tough. You don't control the EGC easily and you need to fight with both the killer trying to stop you and your fellow survivors also trying to unhook.
---
- Escape Unhooked with Spine Chill: This one requires some luck. I wouldn't say it's tough, but I wouldn't call it easy either. It definitely needs set-up and some luck, but it is do-able. But it's not passive, so you're not okay with it.
---
Is that all of them? I think I got them all.
---
3 out of 19, right? 3 out of the 19 challenges are "tough." And I put quotes around that because the EGC is tough, but the other two just require a certain build or playstyle.
---
But maybe I'm wrong. Any of those up there you'd like to disagree with? Or should I continue laughing at how wholly absurd you're being with your temper tantrum?
---
Well then don't go message randoms if you dont like how they respond lol
---
So maybe if you don't play dbd a lot you aren't suposed to complete all the challenges? You know, so maybe for those who play a lot to actually have something to do. If you made let's say all the challenges completable for somebody who plays a couple of hours a week, someone who spends 1 or 2 afternoons playing dbd would just complete them and they're done and have no more gor 38 days
---
Is that a thing? Guess I’ll have to do it more
---
PC and I believe I am a rank 18 killer.
---
I would say that's the case for most of the time but a lot of the time the survivors will wave at you and then wait for you to hit you then DC lately it's been happening alot and I've called some people out on it and they act like total jerks
---
Just thought it's funny how they think ruin wins games.
---
They didn't actually say that I don't think I was just making a meme.
---
At max level it cuts a mere 11 seconds off the total time to sacrifice a Survivor. (A little under 6 seconds per stage.)
---
It’s been like this forever, the switch IIRC released after the spirit dlc which is why they get them for free. Don’t quote me though.
---
Except they don't need gens done for hatch to spawn...
---
WHEN DID THE STANDARD OF SURVIVOR GET SO FREAKING LOW IN THIS GAME?
---
NO BALLS URBAN EVADERS, PEOPLE STILL DCING AGAINST LEGION, ABSOLUTE DONKEY DICK DUMBASSERY EVERYWHERE. I'M NOT ASKING FOR TRYHARD BEHAVIOR, JUST GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER PEOPLE.
---
I call pandering to the subreddit with made up bullshit tomorrow.
---
I had one completely camouflage into the snow it was on. So weird.
---
I'll never forget the time I went up against leatherface. We were 3 gens in, Noone injured, I initially tought we are up against afk wraith or something. When I came by the shack, I decided to go down into basement for the chest, and he... He was standing down there, in the corner. Not afk, he was simply waiting. He cut me up and threw me on that hook like I was nothing, and simply went back into his corner to wait for his next victim to arrive. One wonders, what truly goes inside a mind of....
---
*insidious bubba*
---
I heard that, and when I do get a game; its not fun at all. Either I get 10 pallets dropped and have to break them all, or 2 people leave and its too easy of a "win".
---
Like, it’s better to see their auras after you hook them with BBQ. cause you’re right, why slug? I don’t. It just encourages it.
---
I totally agree I don't play wraith alot but I've noticed it alot with a bunch of different killers I own all of them so I try to mix them up a bit here and there but I main micheal myers
---
Its easier if you run noed + blood warden
---
Yes they do, unless they do all gems or there’s one survivor left.
---
I honestly think if constant T3 Myers and insta mori exist, then GF (a killer only chapter) should get instadown permanent/ till 2 more gens finish if he stalks the survivor twice around or something
---
The first couple sentences clearly came off as sarcasm. But then the last 2 sounded “normal” so I thought you were being serious lol. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Its worse today because of the archive challenge for using keys
---
Ah I see, fuck that noed challenge, though can't wait for when most of the playerbase gets to it.
---
Hatch only spawns if number of gens completed = number of survivors alive+1. Or if there’s only 1 survivor left.  So if two people escaped that means they got at least three gens done.  Sounds like a prerequisite to use the key to me.
---
That’s amazing!
---
I get all the filters, but why does it take sooooo long just to create the lobby itself for people to join? Like as soon as you hit ready, you should be in an empty lobby waiting for people to join. But noooooo, you need to wait 10 mins at least just to create the lobby and 10 more minutes to get it filled. Idk. I play R6S mostly, and DBD is my non stress game. But if even DBD gets me pissed off I can't really call it my non stress game lol.
---
it is absolutely no ones fault. the game gives you rewards for playing like this, you do not need to be sorry.  
---
but doing it literally all day gets god damn old hahah
---
If you actually want to get to the end of the rift, you have to do the challenges. If each challenge takes a month, or say 2 weeks, the time limit makes it impossible to complete them all.
---
Id love at least the brown bag to be base and it would also be nice if he could get his traps from a locker instead of having to find them all over the map.
---
dude... if it's glowing during the match then it isn't and won't be noed
---
I rarely have anyone be mean to me when I play pig. Its a strange phenomenon
---
Something something people want challenges that arent challenging
---
Stupid question but do you mean a survivor walks up to you and point at you, is that what boop the snoot means? I would like to live and want to be ready if this happens to me lol
---
Bullshit he’s pointing out a flaw with what the guy said. 
---
That doesn’t mean he thinks they are balanced.
---
This worked way better before the killer could close the hatch now its almost too risky you might as well get your struggle points
---
# Screaming intensifies
---
Better get rid of HG at the beginning than later when you realise that Devour or NoED is in play.
---
If it glows, it'll have to be snuffed out.
---
thank u
---
that's it
---
Yeah, I wish there was a bigger punishment for facecamping, not like a ban or anything but maybe not rewarding vloodpoints or even taking them away would maybe work
---
To the David King perk named 'were gonna live forever'
---
I really like this idea. If you're ok with it, I would like to use this in a compilation of fan made ideas. You would be credited, and if you do me your email I can share the doc with you
---
Didn't you just post something about this? Dragging it out are we? 🙄
---
1. You can get to the end if the rift without doing a single challenge. I've seen people already running around with the final rift rewards, and we're not even halfway through the time limit of the rift.
---
2. If you're taking a week or longer on a single challenge you are doing something terribly wrong. You keep throwing out these figures as if they're true; you're just making a strawman (strawchallenge?) argument and you keep hammering on it.
---
If you don't have the time or skill to complete the challenges but still think you deserve the rewards, you can pay to unlock everything. Or you can just not unlock them. (They're incredibly minor cosmetics.) I don't know what's so hard about that to accept.
---
We need to balance the game at its current state first. Then we can talk about this
---
I'm maxed out on every killer and have got three of them to prestige 1 - 50. I play the game plenty and even I find these challenges bullshit. There are people who play barely any of it and people who spend every hour of the life on it, challenges should sit somewhere in the range of compatable by somebody who spends more time on this one game than any other but still has shit to do like a full time job.
---
Survivor, his wife.... ngl that was a little too dark.
---
I read soon after that they commented I changing them and listen to the feedback people give, but after seeing 3, I honestly am all the way annoyed.
---
Jack from the shining
---
I get how the other stuff is toxic but how are loops toxic? You expect survivors to run in a straight line and keep running when they could waste your time and not get hit for a while? Looping isn’t toxic, just find someone else and hit them.
---
If you are going to make posts complaining about the game at least learn how all the mechanics work first.
---
Can someone explain this meme to me, please? I didn't quite get it.

If you get to red ranks playing Nurse without Omega or 3+ blinks, u were a good nurse.

If you get to red ranks with current Nurse, addons or no, you’re a good Nurse

I like the Companionate Desire perk, and I was wondering if I could use it in a fan made ideas compilation. I would credit you as the original creator
---
Running Prove Thyself and Better Together with a Green Toolbox, 180 charge one, the coil addon with instructions got me through 4 gens on my first game. It's not awfully hard :)
---
I did it in 2 games using Surveillance and Brutal Strength. I just set up a 3 Gen with trapper and went back and forth kicking every gen that lit up.
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
You’re crazy if you think haddonfield will become not bullshit. It’s not BL that makes it unplayable. BL is just the cherry on the top of a disgusting moldy cake.
---
i saw a suggestion once of seeing the other three around the map just lounging around and watching and i really liked it. it'd really create the feeling of being up against a group without any mechanical changes. i can see how it might be difficult to put in but it'd be cool.
---
Actually it’s DBSHSSG.. honestly I though you’d have a little but more respect for perfection in a horror survival scary game. smh /s
---
You legit don't need them done though
---
Pulled a Golden Experience Requiem on him.
---
How shit dude you remind me of myself when I play csgo and rb6 on. A short laptop and yes you can play it just run the game in window mode with low settings 
---
But for real now a good time to invest in a PC there's plenty of bare bones and basic set ups
---
Man, we must be playing different games. That, or you don't understand how the hatch actually works.
---
I mean if were gonna do that add a minute or two. Two minutes to open the door with decreased speed and a killer that will patrol those gates is rough
---
Uh yeah ya fuckin do mate.
---
Amen
---
Hell yeah! I like vigil with bl and dead hard pretty fun perk combination
---
I did that one. As others have said, perks to help you locate teammates and repair builds are helpful. You don't need to completely repair the generators, just finish repairing them and you should be good. Also... luck. I had, like, 2 games where I did, like, only 1 generator then the next game I got into I managed to repair all 3 gens one after another.
---
I just run Franklin's as a staple to all my builds. I memorize where they drop their key and check up on it once the gens start popping
---
The Legion trailer?
---
I've been watching u for 4 years man, it'd be hard for me to be actually upset lol. Sorry I didn't watch the preview beforehand, I hope everything works out how you plan it to, and totally understand how my question could be annoying. No harm done.
---
Some of them are very stupid, 20 or 25 save unhooks, that’s like 7-12 games on average, but now everyone just thirsting hooks. Some of the challenges are just very time consuming. But the battle pass is for people that play a lot and have time I guess
---
I swear I’ve been in a match with that jake guy
---
The thing is I didn’t have that. A dying Kate was crawling and a stupid Nea was outside the gate even tho she was injured without iron will like she could pull a great escape or save on me
---
I would love to.
---
I did this for the pure enjoyment of delivering on an idea.
---
Send me the full compilation when you are done would ya?
---
Yes. I see it happen across pallets a lot
---
Only against bad survivors, if they can’t hit skill checks or find totem. But that means ruin users are bad killers because survivors lack basics
---
do you usually get 18k per round?
---
It is absolutely undeniable that if four survivors who are very familiar with this game do their best against a killer (barring spirit or nurse) that has equal knowledge and does their best, the odds are completely in the survivors’ favor. I’ve played and seen countless games like that.
---
Honestly I feel like half of these challenges you need a 4 man swf to pull off
---
Dm me your email and I'll share the doc with you
---
I just did this to a survivor when I had 5 stacks of devour hope and they broke my totem. I didn’t camp but I tunneled and I’m proud of it.
---
Omg i couldn t stop laughing
---
I got a 3 sacrifices in EGC, it’d be good if challenges were “harder” in some ways but we could select more than one. Just make some longer e.g kick 200 pallets or gens but you can do it with a few other. Be a lot more fun
---
Yeah, no. This sounds terrible
---
Maybe don’t talk shit if you don’t want to get talked shit back? Keys are keys and Moris are Moris. Be happy you get to play the game and try again. You’ll do better every time and you’ll be a better person for not carrying hate and anger around
---
I'm very confused by your comment, and it makes me feel like you either didn't read or didn't understand the original post.
---
Then they should change the map structure rather than the perk, the perk is fine if used as intended, the reason why it’s not used as intended is because the loops being ran are too safe if ran by a good survivor, in a good loop that you can run 3 times, you can prob run it 6 times with BL, but it shouldn’t be able to run long loops 3 times in the first place... the perk is not the problem, it’s the map structure of some maps, and most infinites are just either blocked or not blocked, it’s up to luck, BHVR should fix all the infinites instead of nerfing the perks that help run that loop more times, since BL is not the only perk capable of doing so, they are just lazy and blame it on a perk that is good on concept
---
Survivors alive+1= gens that have to be done. So there are requirements. Just like how Moris can be just 1 hook.
---
I was just addressing that one part where you said that tunneling is toxic and that paragraph.
---
What do you mean, everything was perfectly clear in the manual. You *did* read the manual didn’t you?
---
I never understood the purpose of these post if I’m being honest. Why even bother to message people ? Just play the game
---
Ye.
---
Oh man, instead I'M laughing just thinking about the fact that I don't care about you enough to read your comment AND make a list for you, and also because you wasted so much time creating this useless comment. Well done. Hope you accomplish something with your life someday
---
But if I try and do this and they locker ds me they are so dead
---
It's gratifying to hear that it's more of an inside joke than how (most) people actually feel.
---
It reminds me of strategy games where people who aren't very skilled at or don't understand the game will complain about the game balance or follow some self imposed set of ethics they feel is ironclad. Instead of thinking about what they could do better.
---
Frustration is understandable when your team's victory comes at the expense of your own player engagement but after seeing it pop up so often, and hearing people take it so personally.... just wowza.
---
Hopefully just be able to get tier 70 even without completing all challenges, then it’s not a big deal. If not it’s gonna he difficult as you literally need 1-3 hours daily to get it
---
# BURN
---
Im sorry i dont follow, i haven't been around the community all that long
---
Ok, let be real there's some shitty totem spots. I play both sides actively. It never feels right having it next to a gen on either side for me.
---
How exactly is fucking davey jones like the demogorgon,in anyway?
---
&gt;I camped a hook as Myers at EGC
---
All I needed to read.
---
Gates are open, EGC is ticking down, anything goes.
---
I didn't even know until the notes that the stagger was always gone. Either way, it's fine to change the perk but Haddonfield still has it's window problems.
---
The 15 emblem challenge only counting one per game is complete bullshit
---
I play 1 to 3 hours and I grind on challenges but it just doesn’t work out. Plus challenges only give you like 1 page honestly maybe 1 and a half.
---
Looking back at this before my nap I was thinking about his face for some reason
---
Ghostface is next, literally had a game at red ranks with a fresh p3 GF, 1 perk, hit someone with exposed downed them, DC, then swf buddy DC, one girl stands still for me to kill her than the other guy just runs at me. No one likes going against him so everyone just throws.
---
I don't know if they stack. Like, if you get better medkits with addons. Could be wrong tho
---
There are some Ripley concepts out thwre,
---
I know right, the same thing happening with me.
---
Don't even bother. That guy is borderline brain dead. It's like talking to a brick wall, I've had a debate with him before
---
If they're not licensed dlc yep!
---
Jeeeesus christ the entitlement. "Everything should cater to me and be exactly the way I want it. I want the perfect amount of challenge so that it feels rewarding to me, but without requiring any serious time investment."
---
The game is basically designed for Balanced landing. You are so crippled as a survivor on that map to start with thanks to the small size and the large landing lag from any drop, on a heavily killer favor map.
---
There is a massive difference between broad and accurate stats, but you can’t go around saying that they are both accurate and broad, it simply doesn’t work that way.
---
Hex: Dedicated Servers
---
Mate if we get a PotC survivor that isnt jack sparrow someone didnt do their job
---
I mean if you call these challenges fun in the slightest then you're a sadist
---
What about not purposely avoiding them? Like if the unhooker was an immersed p3 Claudette and the Meg sprintbursting away injured.
---
Anything goes at any time in a match except cheating or working with a survivor.  Hey if you wanna camp someone? That's your choice. It's frowned upon but your not there for there fun.  But yeah like others said once end game starts you do you
---
camp at it, it may open soon!
---
Mate now you've made me want this more....for science
---
Level 1,unhook 5 survivors safely, Level 2,unhook 15 survivors safely, Level 3 unhook 25 survivors safely. Can’t wait till further passes and seeing how many thousands of survivors we’d have to unhook.
---
jump to freedom!
---
Thought it was just me.
---
Technically the killer would win more if he left the farmer alive to double his hooks. Not that he should
---
At the very least allow us to select 1 Survivor Challenge &amp; 1 Killer Challenge so players don't need to manually swap every time they want to play the other side.
---
I agree with everything except #4. I feel like both of those exist to counteract trolling, and the game would be worse w/o them. They’re also pretty expensive items to use, so most people aren’t really abusing them.
---
Ah makes sense. Thanks!
---
Welp time to play coxcombed clapper and the ghost wraith
---
r/uselessrecircle
---
Situational? Where? Shelter Woods? BL is consistently the best exhaustion perk only because Dead Hard actively plots to kill you by making you exhausted with no movement.
---
Did you buy them through in game? Or through dlc
---
I don't understand how people can say this. Nurse is still one of the strongest killers and yet has some of the worst stats.
---
People are making *way* to much out of that tiny amount of information.
---
Its Scarry dude not scary. It will literally leave you wounded.
---
I was just asking if I was being an asshole, Christ dude.
---
r/whoosh
---
It's moving the needle of Haddonfield being downright impossible to win, to highly unlikely to win. 
---
With BHVR, I'll take what I can get.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
You don’t know how to use r/whoosh , makes no sense in this situation
---
You’re doing great
---
That sounds like a reasonable tweak- thank you @golden_spider
---
You know you could just... not comment on here, if the only thing you're going to do is be a dick.
---
New map: SCP 3008
---
Yh it’s totally gone over my head
---
Balanced landing didn't get removed. It still works on the game's drops, you just can't drop loop with it anymore.
---
Just to clarify, are you suggesting perks like calm spirit get one of your suggestions or all? Overall tho I think buffing stealth survivor perks would be nice. The value you put out are alittle high tho
---
Open hand is not reliable. It's related to his movement speed. You can use a controller, move slowly, and his hand will be open. 
---
Likewise a Myers with a tombstone piece can mori you with a closed fist.
---
For real, the first two levels were... alright. But this new one seems problematic at least. 
---
I wish you could slowly grind away multiple at a time
---
Trying to give you some advice, just move on. Literally it’s a game and you’re over here writing essays on whether it’s okay on what you did. Literally play how you want, fuck what others thinks like cmon
---
Literally the first one is “get 25 safe unhooks” which isn’t hard, except for the fact that everyone is trying to do it, and the number is super high so it’ll take hours just for one challenge.
---
As for the “single game” challenges, you have to get two kills during EGC, and on survivor side, get two unhooks during EGC
---
That's what you get for playing immersed and hiding for one bloodpoint.
---
We don't want the best RNG. We just want it to be consistant.
---
It's because people want to put it in your oinker
---
Imagine being deaf
---
But my title is making the statement that killers with claws can teleport, not that killers that can teleport have claws.
---
Off the top, Its probably why I died alot, weak looping skills. A good killer will find the weak link and hunt them down.  Try running lithe or sprint to help perhaps?
---
It would be cool if you could switch legion members through the game like a teleport between the 4 members keeping feral frenzy AND giving him a new teleport ability along with new members to watch during chases giving you the feel of being chased by a group of killers
---
How Oni gonna use his power wheh he can't even hit him? I'm sorry to say he may have him on that so he could hit it then quit it and be out fast af

---
Here is it posted on RedBubble. I'll hopefully get a few more done in the next weeks before Christmas. Any ideas on who I should add next on the list?
---
I completely agree with your ideas for Lightweight, bothers me that the perk says it makes footsteps light but doesn’t actually change the sound at all, quite frustrating
---
Its these Killers I hate sometimes especially when they let the Survivor that didn't do jack shit the whole match escape through the hatch but instead sandbags the entire team and fucks everyone else until your dead and the killer shows them mercy because they don't know the sins they caused.
---
You'll get nowhere trying to reason with these people. They just want to complain.
---
Might as well hang that on this post:
---
I had a Doc game a swamp map (the one without the boat) against 4 good survivors. I managed to force a 3 gen ca. in the middle of the map, effectivly forcing them to either sit around wasting time or come at me. I need to mention i managed to get 3 of them to their Death hook, with one being already sacrifised
---
Now there was that one Meg who luckily found a Key, gathered the Survivors and slipped through the hatch that sat in the middle of the 3 gens.
---
What transformed this entire thing from unlucky to rage inducing was the trashtalk in the aftergame chat, because luckily getting a key must be the highest of skills appariatly.
---
Oh gawd, imma put a bear trap on you now.
---
I assume you’re playing as David King, his perks are ok (except No Mither).
---
Some perks that are available to everyone that I’d recommend are Spine Chill, and Dark sense. They give you information about the killer’s whereabouts.
---
Maps with a possibility if windows are blocked and RNG sucks. It is possible no mounds spawn.
---
- groaning storehouse
---
- sheltered woods
---
- suffercation pit (if the drop window is blocked)
---
Can spawn with no mounds or drops but rarely happens
---
-wrecker's yard
---
- resting place
---
- gas Haven
---
Basically most starting maps if you get unlucky if no mounds, cranes, or tractors tiles spawn. I seen it happen on fractured cowshed once.
---
Tell me, which individual challenge took you a month to complete?
---
Man, Friendzoned!
---
It’s always had the stagger reduction, it just got buffed to always have the stagger. Before balanced would be just using a drop off to reach the next loop, and then it became abuse the map design: the game. Now it’s back to being a “turning a dead spot into a speed boost” albeit a bit better thanks to the new muffled sound.
---
This
---
It’s similar to the Distressing challenge from level 2. All you have to do is what it says (while having the perk Unnerving Presence equipped)
---
Where you are going, none can help you now.
---
Please don’t remind me of that game. I bought the stupid power armor edition and it’s probably my biggest regret in life.
---
r/tworedditorsonecup
---
The gold one from level 2 challenges didn’t have that problem wtf
---
lol wow, whole lot of Nintendo fanboys here downvoting.
---
imagine being such a cunt that you need to disrespect someone whilst he experiences a bug
---
No you dont, because the only way for it to be truly consistent is for the hexes to be placed in the same spots every time.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again: As a billy main, instabilly is fucking boring. I want fun gimmicks, not stat buffs
---
Indeed
---
I mean, I wrote it while waiting for a match, but go off I guess.
---
Oof i read all those toxic survivor mains here lmao. In killer games I don't really care about what survivors 'feel' since I am a KILLER and not a 'omg let's all have fun and make it super easy' type of person. You will always encounter people like this claudette, that was complaining about your way of playing. Just imagine you would have showed mercy or whatever... 10/10 that claudette would have called you out for being bad or some other bullshit. Make sure you have fun in your match.It also helps to leave the post-game chat before someone can type a rant.
---
For the most part, the ones that need a buff of some kind from the perk being really underwhelming
---
You should already know. If you were intentionally doing it to piss off the survivors then yes you are an asshole. If you weren't then you wasted your time writing this wall of text.
---
Shelter woods is 1 of the 2 that it's useless on (I'm not counting basement stairs as useful)
---
Suffocation pit has mounds
---
Maps that have cranes on them always have a crane, just like the busses. Tractors sometimes won't spawn but can also spawn mounds.
---
I don't know how much you use the perk but you get creative when you use it 90% of the time.
---
then you get 1 hit and they unhooks B) I'ma just use pantless myers B)
---
I mean, I already can’t play two games as survivor or killer without someone crying about something
---
I'm saying I want a ruin-tier slowdown perk that isn't a hex.
---
Burn!
---
Definitely an awesome anime, and even better manga too. I dig this idea.
---
I played ghostface on the game for this challenge, still had so many phantom grabs, it always cracks me up because the killer slowly stops reaching out, at least on PC.

Hopefully 4K escaped too right hehe

Maybe add a background? I think the black works well but maybe add the basement or even ormound
---
Okay this made me chuckle, get your UPVOTE you fucker!
---
How can I get those perks? I have spine chill on my meg
---
I think that could be good but they would need to fix it since traps, from what I understand, randomly move after being used/disarmed.
---
Why don't you just not comment? Follow your own advice of "if you're trying to piss someone off, you're an asshole". I wrote it while waiting for a match, and ultimately that shouldn't matter when I make a discussion on a *discussion based forum*.
---
that is tunneling in its final form, holy shit
---
Yeah I think anyone who plays the game at all, regardless of which sides, knows that some totem spots are ridiculous how easy they are to find. I'm perfectly fine with it being a little bit inconsistent to add to the high risk, high reward nature of totems. But the totems that spawn next to a gen and not in the slightest bit of cover that can be seen from 18 angles and 200 feet away are absurd.
---
I really liked how it was before, however it clearly was too strong on Haddonfield. I think they should reduce the penalty for dropping down overall a bit though since balanced was nerfed. Everytime you fall without it it feels like you break your ankles.
---
BHVR would rather nerf the perk than fix the haddonfield infinite though which sucks.
---
None of them have taken me a month. I am using educated guessing to say that these fourth tier rift challenges will be for some people a month long quest.
---
Lithe, Sprint Burst, and Dead Hard are consistently more useful and less situational in 80% of the maps
---
Otzdarva?
---
Stronger than billy? That's news to me
---
The ones that are clearly grinds are a prime example. Sure, I'll just play 10 games in order to complete this one challenge of breaking/damaging 40 pallets/gens.
---
Suffocation pit has a chance to spawn with no mounds. It has happened.  Same with the others. They are not garenteed spawns, just high chance.
---
Not all game? I mean I get it but until you hit them you can’t be torn out of shroud unless a stun that isn’t flashlight. You just have to stalk and unlimited until you hit them. It would give players the warning to be careful constantly
---
What do “accurate” and “broad” mean to you, then, that make this statement contradictory?
---
Better be a full rework and not the current one all they did was ruin my boy/girl(s) even more then before
---
Personally I like to engage in post game because most of the time it's wholesome. I've had a lot of good tips or good laughs come from them and only a few toxic ones. This is the first that made me think that I might be the asshole so I thought I'd get some other opinions on it.
---
Don’t do anything to my boy Wraith. I rarely come against Wraiths, so it isn’t much of an issue to me.
---
Don't be! It's all a journey, and perhaps I would do better if I stopped trying to drop down and attack people like Edward Kenway.
---
What a dumb decision to make honestly
---
5* man swf. Including the killer.
---
Yes, the mounds but most of the maps have drops baked into them that aren't up to chance.
---
this is happening to me right now
---
To nobodys suprise it sucked
---
Yea
---
I’m not making any statement on the implications of these statistics. “Unreliable”, and “not valuable” are vastly different statements from “inaccurate” and “impossible”.
---
Half are just shit that doesnt happen 90 percent of the time anyway and it's some dumbass shit. Im only playing for the lore since im already tier 61. Unhook 2 times during end game collapse. That'd be cool if shit like that actually happened
---
35% piggies unite!
---
Anything that requires actual aim will be better on pc. The mouse is far more precise than a controller.
---
Yes make Ruin slowness the general speed on all gens. No hex no perk.
---
I had that realization earlier today. Maybe it's because I've only played one side for ao long but I feel like I can't just take a break because the rift will end after a while and I'm only halfway.
---
I get the frustration but don't fight toxicity with toxicity.
---
Accurate means that all factors have been acccounted for, and added too the data for precise numbers, Broad means that the data has very few accurate numbers, and the data is not true.
---

---
The issue is that the only reason people bring bl is because of the stun reduction. Nobody will use it bow, because it will objectively be the worst exhaustion perk. They could've fixed the loops, but that would require a small amount of effort. Tiny adjustments to a couple of loops and its balanced. But fuck it, let's make another perk totally worthless.
---
Also on Xbox. I have to restart my game after it starts doing this. I let it run for 4-5 games like this once and then it happened on one game and actually prevented me from getting my WGLF post-match bonus. That wasn’t usually happening but if the disconnect happens at the right moment apparently it can. 
---
Restarting the game worked for me though.
---
Its entire utility is the stun reduction. Nobody will use it now because it's simply the worst exhaustion perk.
---
If you do, wait until the 28th and get him for 250 cells instead of 500
---
Im all for buffin stealth, but buffing Technician with a repair boost would just add fuel to the fire that is generators being done too fast.
---
Then my only concern would still be adding so much to 1 perk. It dosnt balance out well.
---
Yeah same, only counts 1 per game.
---
I highly recommend you try out other killers. Its good to have more then one main, it keeps things fresh though you shouldn't pick a killer because they are top teir, you should pick one you enjoy.
---
I mori'd 3 people and then the last disconnected when I downed them, but I still got it too
---
Challenge: get a job at BHVR studios and fix the god forsaken challenges. Reward: 5000 bloodpoints
---
Yo, can you do the hag with her dripping the blood into her mouth? Maybe with like the swamp as a background?
---
I’ll give it a shot. Seems like the better choice.
---
Found the bhvr mega fan. Everyone hates these challenges dude.
---
huntress is wayyy easier on pc
---
Only if they remove NOED and Ruin
---
Powering the gates doesn’t fail the challenge but it does increase the odds of failing.
---
I did it yesterday two times so Im ready
---
Wait wha? Is ruin getting nerfed?
---
In my region and platform, judging by queue times, there are more killers during the morning and day, and more survivors in the evening.
---
The only one that is complete bullshit is the surv one where you need two unhooks during endgame. The rest is alright and just grindy.
---
Every time people want to nerf noed killers say survivors will immediately want to nerf another killer perk. And here we are, after they nerfed ds, and destroyed mettle, and nerfed the syringes, now wanting fucking bl to be made useless, instead of fixing the maps. How much do you wanna bet that they're gonna nerf adrenaline next?
---
I don't mean permanent, I thinking something like corrupt intervention where it would end after a period of time.
---
PEOPLE CAN TELL WHETHER YOU DCED OR PRESSED "LEAVE MATCH" BY THE SOUND IT MAKES WHEN YOU LEAVE. EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE CAN STILL CLOSE THE GAME TO GET THE SAME EFFECT, KNOW THAT PEOPLE WON'T AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME YOU LEFT ON PURPOSE.

Thanks, I just finished it and I love it

If they're the last survivor, I like to bully them for a while and then give hatch to assert dominance.
---
Im working on those nexst. The point is that i finished, but i still got side quest's. And i nead more lore.
---
Fun fact: this exact thing happened to me a couple days ago lol
---
No, but this post would get heavily downvoted if it were reversed.
---
Oh, another idea: there could be an increasing cooldown between survivors who jump in the hatch. For example:
---
- Survivor 1 (key user): 0 seconds (instant)
---
- Survivor 2: 5 seconds after Survivor 1 escapes
---
- Survivor 3: 10 seconds after Survivor 2 escapes
---
- Survivor 4: 15 seconds after Survivor 3 escapes
---
Yes. The whole point of my original comment was a reply to yours on how there was only 2.
---
There is more than just 2 due to the way RNG works that can end up with no drop points other than killer shack.
---
You mean killers and survivors cannot get them done without "Help" because they suck ... kind of sad tbh.
---
I don't think you know what "101" means...
---
MY FAVORITE IS MR. CATMAN BOWIE!!!
---
Yes but i think the fact you have the perk is all you nead, it dosent nead to be lit. Idk game therory. I save one on death hook befor i killed him i opend a gate whit blood warden and then whit play whit your food i rushed and camped the last doode, at this point it was him and another. Soo you know sad for him, i sad sory after but arcives bro.
---
If all three of your teammates died and you couldn’t even find the hatch first, why do you deserve any other benefits? You lost. If the gates are far away, you get lucky and maybe escape despite being outplayed 2-3 times over. Why do you want more? Are survivors just never supposed to lose, ever?
---
note: Demogorgon died on the way back to his home dimension
---
See, I don't mind that idea and it has counter-play in the form of toolboxes and/or brand new parts. That said, I don't know why killers dont run corrupt intervention, as someone who can hit skill checks most of the time, that perk + pgtw are a lot stronger than ruin imo.
---
Literally every game I play is a 4k for the killer unless they feel bad for us and let us farm. I've been playing for like 80 hours and am rank 8. Killers have it easy
---
This is happening to me right now, not playing survivor for tomes though, just plain sick of having to go full try-hard against red rank survivors who know how to use loops properly and loop you for ages and then t-bag at exit gates.
---
These challenges are so wack. I have to throw the whole game to do them
---
Only if survivors are very stupid...
---
It worked for me a couple times too, restarting the game, but at times it changed nothing. 
---
I hope it is an issue that will be fixed any time soon
---
I think it's because corrupt intervention isn't consistent either. Depending on what map you get and where you spawn, it can either block key generators or block useless ones. 
---
That said, it's more consistent than ruin, so I don't know why people don't run it more.
---
I like it. Very cute.
---
What system are you on? I’m on Xbox.
---
Trump won the election too, doesn't make the popular vote right.
---
Just cause you don't like the challenges doesn't mean they're hard, doesn't mean they're ridiculous, doesn't mean they're impossible. Just means you're a crybaby that doesn't want to have to try. Especially if a person is not even willing to defend their argument when called out.
---
God fucking forbid your video game adds extra free stuff that makes you work just a little bit, right snowflake?
---
Yeah that’s gonna be different but i have a solution i think for and plan
---
I got a Freddy basement build just because of this challenge and BT not activating on him. Theres no other possibility to do it fast without camping
---
Na no thanks since I'll just end up walking into that shit
---
Puppers is just so chill and wholesome to watch.
---
Maybe. I just think that the hard part is finding the middle ground, since it really depends on tbe RNG of the exit gate spawns. If they're really close together I'd imagine my idea would be cancer and your idea would fix the big issue with it, but if they're on opposite sides of the map then my idea would work and your idea may or may not be too lenient.
---
Pls dont take those bhvr statistics to heart. They actually dont tell very much.
---
They better not nerf anyone else. Buff atleast a few damnit. BUFF LEGION OR REWORK HIM YOU LAZY BASTARDS.
---
Someone mention to restart your game. We’re on Xbox one, so I’m not sure if it will change anything on the PS4.
---
It sometimes gets rid of the issue or it changes nothing. From my experience this happened.
---
If it fucking glows, it fucking goes
---
I can't help you there, but best of luck
---
exactly, lets do a test of all red ranks playing EVERY killer and see how that goes.
---
Not good is my guess.
---
They made them faster, button addons are now usable, they mend mend times shorter (as if they werent already usless), they made frenzy stabs not count as main attack (so no stbfl) but they made up with it for nemisis being able to fuck people's deep wound timer.
---
Dude what is actually up with matchmaking. There’s no reason we should be getting paired up with full ass groups that are 4-6 ranks above us. Like even if you’re experienced, it’s kinda bullshit
---
I got it by killing everyone with 2 gens left. The last person got hatch too so you dont have to get a 4k just dont let the game get to the point where people open the gates.
---
I am just saying I can’t figure out how to properly blind yet
---
Ok boomer
---
how are green addons tryhard?
---
There will be a penalty for leaving in the next chapter :3
---
That's never happening. Survivors will DC.
---
Wraith op
---
Wraith isnt so powerful anyway so its not an issue. Also any survivor with eyes can see him before he even uncloaks. Spirits logic with prayer beads, (dont see em, dont hear em, but you died anyway)
---
Context: wraith who I hardly play but am good out went for a walk. Great game. Nobody found the ruin until only 2 were left and 1 gen was done (why?) So a Meg and Claudette were left. Neither wanted to die so they both just existed. The Meg was frustrating. She hid in the very corner of the map. After downing her like 5 times and she kept returning to her corner (hooks were too far away to hook) I decided to look for Claudette. I knew she found the hatch because she was camping a shack with nothing inside. So I killed her pretty easily. Then I tried Meg again after she was rescued. No. I went back to Claudette. Still lurking the shed. I downed her (her 2nd hook and almost all were dead. She dc as soon as I picked her up. Frustrated because I couldn’t get 32K. But I thought I could get a late sacrifice point. So I closed the hatch in the shack and went to Meg. She ran to the gate and back to let me know she wasn’t giving me her kill. So I downed about 3 times, trying a new strat with each. Once she got cocky and decided to take a vault around to the corner. I downed her as soon as she vaulted. After I decided to basement her since it was pretty close, bam DC. No full points
---
Everyone is crying about it being nerfed but I see no difference in the change, it still good.
---
Yup from rank 9 down as killer I'm never surprised to see red rank survivors. As a rank 4 survivor I seem to get teamed up with alot of green ranks.
---
This this this
---
Lmao, accidentally did that tonight while getting basement sacrifices. They were all hooked at the same time because whenever one tried to save the guys in the basement, they’d step into one of my many traps in the killer shack. Was pretty entertaining.
---
Give Billy an addon that makes him run backwards
---
Yup, his chill is definitely why I enjoy his videos. He pretty much never tryhards unless he has a specific reason for it and tries to make it a fun game for everyone.
---
"Entity displeased" oh yes my bad, i should waste a perk slot for franklins each time. So sorry entity. *you entitled shitty creature*
---
They should remove m1 too
---
They laughed at me for not immediately buying the premium pass.
---
Oh my god, thank you so much for this info.
---
Sorry, I'm not hip. Have no idea if that's supposed to be some weird attempt at a insult. Yikes. Maybe try something original?
---
Thought they were gonna change that? Who knows you hear so much shit in this community you could hear the dev team personally shot a dog and half the reddit would believe it I’m probably no better
---
Killers will literally never care about survivors sooo...
---
Fair enough on that admission that it's a self-skill issue and not the challenge being difficult. 
---
I can't grab/interrupt worth shit. Last Tiers "Grab 1 Survivor" took me 6 games as Ghostface, that's how bad I am at it. With that streak going, I'm gonna need 36 games to grab 6 survivors for this tier's challenge.
---
But that doesn't mean the challenge is difficult. That means I suck at it. And that's okay because there are things I suck at and there are things I'm good at.
---
The flashlight challenge isn't difficult, you just kinda suck at it. You might be a god at hitting skill checks or have great gen pressure or what-not. But flashlights ain't your thing and there's no hate there.
---
But don't go saying the challenge itself is hard when you mean to say "The challenge is hard **FOR ME**."
---
Big difference between "BHVR doesn't know what they're doing! These challenges are impossible!" and "I'm not good at the skills needed to easily complete these challenges, it's gonna be tough for me."
---
Cause, hell... Maybe BHVR is putting these challenges there so you try something new and develop better skills? You start flashlighting and I'm certain you're gonna be a flashlight pro by the end of the tome.
---
Also - Aim just above the neck. Flashlighting when they start a pallet break is easiest. If you're going for a Flashlight save, wait to start the light until they're midway through the pick-up animation.
---
You don't have to go on, you lost your *argument* when the stats provided by BHVR proved you wrong already.  
---
Don't *try again*.
---
I could legit see that as a purple/red addon you activate mid-sprint
---
God damn this is the gift that keeps giving.
---
&gt;3
---
Degenerate!
---
Wrong sub dude
---
I have only added one thing (or just simply tweaked how a couple of them worked), as well as giving a numbers for certain perks that don't normally have any for a specific part (like calm spirit).
---
I feel that the fervor over unhooking will die down over time as others progress past that mission. But that doesn't help you now, sadly. 🤔
---
Unlike how different Susie's and Julie's voices are
---
Oh shet-
---
el mao
---
I only did a very small boost to it, as well as making it so it only applies said boost when doing the gen alone
---
You can say that all you like, but the stats from May back up my claims pretty darn well.  
---
There's no point in giving you stats because you'll just ignore them the way you're doing already.
---
Take for example finished the unhook during EGC game crashed in the after chat. Try and redeem challenge cause its done. Says i cant. Try again nothing. Cant progress it due to the fact its locked on done.
---
I do the same. But I'll  slug and ignore the person off hook if they don't have bt to deny the safe unhook. You aint farmin your teammates for the rift if I can help it.
---
It would be interesting to see what ultra rates they would give him
---
My mistake, i meant to say 
---
“it can still be a good idea to whack them if you’ll still be able to go after the unhooker afterwards.” Not the unhooked.
---
I’m specifically talking about situations where you can hit the person whose been unhooked and still hit the person who unhooked them before they reach anything (for instance if the hook isn’t near any loops and all the pallets near it are gone)
---
These stats back up fuckall.
---
there is no argument
---
People paid money for this Rift Pass shit and it's almost impossible to max out rewards without doing challenges. Stop being a fucking apologist for this company's constant fuckups
---
3 Rift fragments
---
I think the problem is I am on ps4 and I can’t aim properly with the analog. The solution have to a a programmed move where I just have to learn to position myself a distance from pallet and just do a learnt move.
---
And for me I prefer the killer challenges hehe. Did gen grabber with 1 try, 5 traps too. Basement...I always end up with only survivor challenges left then I start crying lol
---
Actually I don’t mind not completing a challenge that much. I will just continually go back to the 2 blind until I do it one day. Else it’s fine too lol.
---
I sure as hell hope so. Just feels a little hopeless sometimes trying to squeeze a bit of joy out of the game when every match is just me getting obliterated. Then watching noob3 toy with killers to remind myself the game isnt entirely broken
---
Pallets are not unlimited though
---
I am so thankful that survivors were willing to farm today to help me with that god damn trappers challenge. I’m not a good fucking trapper, I needed that so much. Whichever saints out there did that, thank you.
---
Hard to blame people tbh. Most people have limited time for games, you gotta do what you gotta do to get these bullshit challenges done.
---
Praise be to Nea and all hail the pallet loop
---
Before archives came out I was strongly against that because "Imagine wanting to play the game and you have 3 people with 'Open 2 chests' battlepass challenge"
---
Then I saw the open 5 chests and open 2 chests in one game. I was mad
---
Now I see this shit. This is above my expectations of shittyness.
---
The only maps where you can’t use BL is Shelter Woods and Suffocation Pit and honestly on most maps you can get hella value out of the loop areas around where you trigger in like on Lery’s. Even calling Sprit Burst more useful when it’s clearly the worst exhaustion perk choice makes me think you’re almost trolling about how good BL was and how obviously better is was compared to any other exhaustion perk. But you wanna believe BL is niche so I don’t really wanna attempt to change your mind.
---
Oof that must've hurt when you saw that
---
Don't forget escape using Spine Chill without being hooked once. Get ready for the immersed Blendettes with keys!
---
Purple ranks are harder to play in as killer than red ranks in my experience. I play console btw but during rank resets the hardest part of getting back to rank 1 is getting through 10-4 once I'm back in red ranks I two pip easily. Idk why though.
---
The gate must not open at all let them get hatch but no gate
---
it's the opposite for the rest of the community. 
---
Guys is struggling? well he makes it harder for me to carry him to the hatch, so on the hook you go!
---
to be fair, learning console nurse was always gonna be a challenge, nerfs or no
---
Go fuck yourself, shill :/
---
I usually give it to my obsession cuz they are the ones that survive the longest (not gonna lose my STBFL stacks ya know)
---
They said their range is up to 6 ranks in both directions for match making
---
With slippery meat it increases to 24% the first time you get hooked.
---
Killer mains are salty I'm pointing out their bullshit
---
Trophies are permanent. This rift is only open for 3 months. Fucking idiots.
---
In 80% of maps, you are forced to run to your only spot where BL will be useful. Sprint Burst is garbage, but I can get more consistency out of it by playing around it as an "at-will" perk.
---
I said farming is "boring" and I don't want to every match. BUT if killers expect our help,  they should show something in return. I do my challenges,  as I said with running borrowed time just fine,  but that doesn't make it ANY less annoying when EVERY killer is camping.
---
He's not though. His power resets upon pickup and needs to be charged, Billy can just saw away at any moment's notice
---
The rewards are not higher, what the fuck is this bullshit?

What rank are you playing? Cause red and purples are leaving people to die, they don’t even second guess they just continue the gen or stay in their crouch positions

---
Thank you,  even tho I STILL don't understand what "boomer" means.
---
I do gens, but there are enough people in post game chat asking "why didn't you save me?" and getting mad...  
---
Save them, they'll complain, don't save them, they'll complain, too. Or they tell me "I had DS, you should have farmed me"... 
---
It's not easy to do the right thing, when you can expect a "-rep useless teammate" after the match.
---
And there is a strange misunderstanding in "hook gymnastics". At first flapping your arms meant "I'm getting camped, don't come, do gens". Now some people do it to tell "Come here right now!".
---
People confuse me. &gt;.&lt; (and scare me a little, sometimes)
---
They caught him a second time becuase he was live streaming his PS4 gameplay. So it was easy for them to get him. As long as he does that, it will be very hard for them to catch him again.
---
I wasn't saying it didn't happen, I was saying it might be what happens at their ranks as I don't see it in my ranks.
---
You *monster*
---
And 10k Bloodpoints
---
Nice!
---
Why message him?
---
The easiest blind to get is when the Killer breaks a pallet.
---
So... waste pallets, i guess.
---
In my case, everyone runs around like potatoes and steal unhooks from each other without borrowed time. So nobody gets a safe unhook.
---
If pick and play rates increased with challenges, then that means there is more data on him and if he’s doing well, then he doesn’t need changes.
---
I must have been really lucky then.
---
I dont play because its fun anymore. Im playing because im an idiot who brought the battle pass. These games just make me... well, angry. I havent gotten "angry" since I first started playing this game. It really sucks
---
Not really.  
---
I mean, i worked around it by just painting over the wich is WAY EASIER than actually drawing from scratch.  
---
The perks also have low resolution, so you dont need any attention to detail, just the rough part.
---
Tell em to get the fuck out of your stall, or lock the door.
---
Yo...contact Bethesda right fckn now
---
Rank 15 - 20 has shit queue times. Green ranks has the fastest.
---
Read that in Samination voice
---
Must have to be able to say you haven't had "any" killers camp,  especially with the amount of hook rushing going on because of challenges.
---
Yeah. I just haven’t had luck with being able to get two. Either people are on death hook by EGC so I can’t take them off. Or I get one off but die and never a second. It just seems super difficult. I think a more manageable challenge would have been 5-8 EGC safe unhooks across matches.
---
More emphasis on stealth. What I mean is as the game is now, there is more of an emphasis on wasting the killers time so that others can do generators. The killers should be feared and survivors should want to hide from/avoid the killer not have the urge to pallet slam them for 5 loops in quick succession.
---
Uh.. sorry, but no. Killers have never been in a better spot in general than they are now. Worried about Dead Hard? It used to be usable multiple times in a chase. DS? You used to be able to able to use it instantly whether you were unhooked less than 60 seconds ago or not. 
---
Flashlights used to instablind, Trapper used to be meta because of how many infinites were in the game pre-bloodlust, insta heals are gone, BNPs used to do 100% of a gen, saboing was a nightmare because hooks wouldn't respawn, stacking certain healing perks gave insanely fast heal speeds, pre end game collapse used to force you to pick between a 30 minute stand off or just letting the survivor go. 
---
This is the best time to be in for a killer main as the game didn't used to have killers in a power role, it used to have survivors in a straight up broken role. I never played killer in the first year or so of the game because I couldn't imagine how killers could deal with some of the BS that used to exist on the survivor side.
---
Stolen
---
They pretty clearly back the claim that the game favors killers. 
---
You just don't like it, and not liking it doesn't automatically discredit it. 
---
You talk a lot of smack about data and valid arguments for someone who moves the goalpost, uses ad hominem, and even the texas sharpshooter (and no, that's not a complement). You're only willing to accept anything that would prove your claim and immediately say anything otherwise is false, between two sets of stats provided to you by BHVR.   
---
I suggest you take a look into the logical fallacies you're performing, learn a little more a statistics, and stop trying to dominate the comment section by your use of insults.
---
I main Clown, and he’s really fun to play in my opinion.
---
I honestly feel the same way. I play way more killer (probably twice as much) and invest way more BP into killers, but I'm always higher rank on survivor because it's just so much easier. Idiots call me a 'BiAsEd KiLlEr MaIn' when I point out how easy it is to pip as a survivor as well, compared to the killer pip of 'All right, run away from hooks, always kick gens even though the survivor ram away, chase as much as possible, only m1 attack, never end a chase early (not that you can), 3-hook everyone, slug, slug, slug for the 4-man so the 3-man doesn't halve your points, OH GODS I GOT A HEADPOP/BLEEDOUT/DC/HATCHET DOWN/CHAINSAW DOWN/VILE PURGE DOWN WELL IM SCREWED NOW, BLACKPIP IT IS'
---
Ye I believe so
---
Aww, cute! Very well done :)
---
I only heard this, but you have to mori each Dwight Meg Claudette and Jake like 5 times each I think
---
How ?
---
Wow, your ideas are really good, especially having different types of pallets, lockers, and escape methods. Hope some of these things come true!
---
And that's on the off-chance survivors don't actually do the gens
---
Stolen by the game? The grab?
---
Played 1 match
---
Ight imma head put
---
Lol
---
What rank are you? I'm rank 5,  almost 4.
---
Yeah, fuck people who try at the things they love!
---
I'm still doing tome 2 challenges...
---
RIP
---
Tgis is perfection
---
I find myself swapping between roles all the time. Some weeks I want to play as survivor sometimes I wanna play piggy/trapper. I think people focus to hard on maining things but you can have fun on both sides.
---
I mean that's on them then, they choose to crawl away and bleed out. I've had times were I'm just crawling towards the killer and they just do things like set an pick up traps
---
The only thing he needs is his reveal mechanics being fixed. Now he stand in middle of a field and you can watch directly at him, nothing happens... Many times I stood behind him while he was stalking someone else and couldn't reveal him.
---
thats bug abuse and bannable lol
---
I'm experiencing the same thing. It makes things worse with my bad luck tonight. Trying to do the unhook 15 survivors challenge but getting pretty unlucky and getting found first, so I end up spending the whole match running with the killer or on the hook.
---
I'm one of those people who's completed the Rift already but i play the game a stupid amount. To complete the rift you will have to get one tier per day minimum (70 days, 70 levels). Anyone with a life will struggle to complete the Rift in time.
---
My problem is, the current tomes promote farming and throwing the game just to get them or they require a very specific scenario that has nothing to do with you if it will ever happen (like the 2 unhooks during EGC, even with a full SWF the killer can just camp and prevent unhooks) and most of these "if stars align in your favour" challenges hold lore pieces which is what i'm after (it's not that well written but i'm a completionist), and you can't buy that stuff.
---
Killer: Survivor bad
---
Survivor: Killer bad
---
Redo all the killer’s moris! Ghost face, Demo and the Oni have badass ones. My poor Trapper smacks the survivor a couple times in the back, come on!
---
You need 3 sheep and some virgin blood
---
Oh my god, you survivor mains always find a way to complain about somethibg that you cant complain about, shut the fuck up, no, islf somebody is nearby i'm not going to leave them. This has nothing to do with camping you moron
---
I find these challenges super easy....
---
\-Add variety to survivors. At the moment they are just skins. Even if it's just some slight passive abilities.  
---
\-Let killers see when they face SWF so they can prepare. If you go against solo survivors you might try out a weaker killer. If you face a 3 or 4 man squad you better bring a mori.
---
\-Speaking of which: Rework moris. Currently they make you kill stuff too easily, while still making you lose because of the pip system.
---
\-Rework the pip system.
---
\-Give survivors more objectives so the game isn't a skill check simulator.
---
\-Make tiles/pallets more mindgame'able.
---
\-Rework keys.
---
\-Buff weak killers/balance killers arround Billy/Freddy/Addonless Spirit tier.
---
\-Rework hex perks.
---
\-Slow down gen speed when swfs are playing, or let gens take longer the higher your rank is. (Red rank gens could take like 15-20% longer, meanwhile brown rank gens are 10% quicker, and what we currently have would be fine for yellow/green ranks).  
---
\-Make the game scary. I know, I don't really know how. Maybe rework the terror radius and/or force survivors into the same pov you got as killer, but give them an ability to look over shoulders while running etc.
---
\-Rework crows.
---
\-Punish DC'ers and Verbal abuse. Not sure how effective my reports are.
---
\-The game is pretty expensive if you want every killer/survivor. The quality of the game isn't good enough for someone to pay $$$ just to get the full experience. Yes, I know about shards. But still.
---
LOL, once again this isn't about MY challenges. It's about the challenges in general. Wow. You really don't read anything, just run your mouth. Ha. I seriously said I've been helping killers non stop, TONIGHT mainly,  and I've only been helped twice which was only 2 unhookings because there's four of us on a team. So that's 4 unhookings out of the 20 I've dont that I have had "Help" with. I'm saying if killers WANT/NEED help with THEIR challenges maybe SOME of them should quit the camping or surviviors will quit helping that's all. Or if we help them in a match, they shouldn't go stand in a corner and not help us. I'd rather NOT farm if that's the case because then guess what I get NO unhookings/heals or any type of points. Not ONCE did I say,  aww man ALL killers please farm bc little ol me cannot do a challenge. You're REACHING. I see 30 posts a day about how ridiculous challenges are,  let me post one and I get attacked. Wonder why I didn't see your name on any of those post reddit farming police?
---
Good looking out mate, much respect.
---
No, not how short the unhooking is, just how survivors can teleport throught the hooked player and how big the hitbox on hooked survivors on
---
I am joking
---
And the value you get out of BL on most of those tiles results in much longer chases than simply shifting from pallet to pallet. Areas with decent BL spots, not just Haddonfield/Gideon, can result in much longer chases the killer only has bloodlust to fall on if the killer can’t interact with the area well.

Probably best to use We're going to live forever perk for this for additional speed, if someone is running Leader then even better odds. Sadly this is only possible if someone gets to survive till the end then get hooked, either friend or random player for legit go. And expect to have a hard time succeeding doing this twice without Killer camping or going for you or  bringing No one escapes death.
---
Or be lucky to find a friendly Killer...
---
Nice one buddy.
---
How are you complaining about this? If this makes or breaks the game for you, then you're a terrible killer.
---
It isn't the killers job to help you. Please quit helping killers, it is a bannable offense.
---
She’s a good killer she’s just not that easy to play.
---
Will this nerf completely eliminate BL from being a perk worth using though? Because after  this nerf it seems to me all the other perks are better in use as they are all able to be used in common jungle  gyms and loops. Whereas BL does not  have that privilege thus why i find the exhaustion effect to be a good addition to the perk. BL by far is the least  used exhaustion perk to get away from killers in loops and now for the very rare loops that do need BL they will be completely useless now. Me personally i dont see a need for running BL post patch i dont understand why we are killing perks because of 'infinites' if we could just rework the loops

Lol, they sound like a butthurt moron. I'm surprised you were upvoted, this sub is mostly killer mains who behave like that Plague did.
---
Did Fungoose fall out of favor with people?
---
Not enjoying 2 out of the what is it like 20 seems a bit harsh to be trashing it as hard as you are imo
---
I wouldn't consider it a tunneling perk, at most you have to hit them 4 times for a benefit that you may not even need if the last gen doesn't pop
---
So, I clicked on your page and the first post is you crying about disconnects and t bagging,  yikes you're a hypocrite lolololol. I forgot, it's only aloud when you do it right?
---
She's an interesting killer to play. I play her kind of like legion. Infect as many people as possible as quick as possible. The thing about plague is you have to be good with the corrupt purge or else there is no real punishment for survivors cleansing.
---
They mean 400% gen progression. So it is perfectly fine when the kiler has ruin so you can work longer on gens
---
Back after 4 hours of sleep.
---
If only lvlin up was more interesting, 'packopenin' style content would be a thing... When doing the bloodweb
---
Your joking right? Cause its a part of the game that can change an entire match, if you dont understand how bad it can actually be your a terrible player. This alone can make the killer lose map pressure, causing gens to get done faster, causing the killer to get punished cause fucked hitboxes. And how the fuck are you actually against complaining about broken hitboxes?
---
Jesus Christ kid go to sleep and quit stalking me. Why don't you go through and downvote everything I've ever posted I'm sure that will make you feel better. It's a fucking game, get a life.
---
Wait what? You’re saying that if someone is hooked, you stay next to them them, correct?
---
Oh dude wait till u see level 4
---
I hate when people think they’re entitled to a hatch. It’s entirely up to the killer and you don’t need to rant to the killer about it. Back when I played I usually gave the hatch if someone DC’d when they wouldn’t die otherwise.
---
I hate playing as survivor always have probably always will. Killer is way too fun.
---
Now what you say in my mind depends on rank. Im easily able to get to rank 1 right now if I wanted to again. I have over 600 hours as pure killer.... that being said Red Rank is toxic as fuck and purple aint all that better. 
---
I dumb down my gameplay to have more fun because in RED its just a try hard fuck for all that will get you BMed every match.
---
Honestly with DBD it aint about winning since the Entity doesnt care if you get them all or not. Hell if you get none and it says Entity displeased it doesnt matter because It loves false hope.

To have more fun run a joke build go down to green or yellow and just enjoy it.
---
True, true
---
I wonder this could be used as an exploit, a way to lose connection to the match but not so much connection to be sent back to main menu it’s weird but maybe like what people do in gta online they stop the process of dbd and it makes you lag out and then reconnect maybe????
---
I mean when you cant progress cause of shit game bugs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
And he's also fun because of the "forever Freddy" build lol
---
My first 10 or so games after they dropped were killers farming for the gen breaks. Didnt even get to play a normal match for hours. And still haven't even gotten 25 unhooks because I'm having to fight every single other survivor for unhooks atm.
---
Im saying if soebody is hooked and another person is obviously nearby then i stay near, if your against that then you are exactly the entitled survivor people make fun of. You cant expect killers to just let you unhook people cause "camping"

Oh, it isnt even a good bug, but thats ok i guess. i have 1800 hours, so im ok calling it quits at this point.

Reminds me of my first basement collection what a lovely day.

Plot twist: he did however loop the killer around for 3 minutes and destroyed ruin in the beginning of the trial
---
I'm literally leveling up Bubba now to prepare for basement challenges.

I don't think I'll ever get to red ranks, let alone purple. I'm not that good at the game in all honesty. Is he fun to use?
---
Lolololol, that's hilarious. You're aloud to comment of my post but I cannot look at yours? Again, hypocritical. Aren't posts on reddit mean fo be read? So everyone on here is just a bunch of stalkers? Weird flex, when you get called out on your fake ass bullshit. Go post more crying over being t bagged and your crutch perks not working, and stay off my shit then. Also the kid comment always makes me chuckle,  so thank you for that. People really think that stings,  if I'm a kid what are you? Maybe you should be the one getting a life.
---
Thank you for making a post about this. I’ve been playing for multiple hours a day just to get done song challenges and you made me realize that maybe it’s not such a good idea.
---
Done it plenty of times super easy.
---
Blocked.

She's a decent killer, but it's really hard to rank up with her because her ability hurts her points (win/loss points, not blood points). Infecting people does almost nothing point-wise, the broken status does almost nothing point-wise, corrupt purge does almost nothing point-wise. Pipping with plague is like m1 chasing with huntress: you can do it. In theory.
---
Also, I actually didn't down vote a single one of your post on your page. Just your whack ass comments on mine.
---
Yay, I win.
---
Been using a macro to just hold a button instead since the games release :v
---
It's collisions. Either time it well or try to earn your kill back as a Killer. If you know how to manage.
---
You don't need all gens done, but you need to complete at least 3 gens for the hatch to spawn unless there is only one person left (in which case the hatch always spawns). If the survivors finish 3 gens, the hatch won't spawn unless there are only two survivors remaining.
---
&gt;Back
---
Ok boomer.
---
I misread your post. I assumed you camped. It is common knowledge to locate nearby survivors you suspect of hiding to get an easy unhook once you leave. But for the sake of it, what IS an obvious hint, other than scratchmarks etc, that a survivor is nearby?
---
That isnt as easy at it sounds especially with DS and barrowed time. And timing it well is overshadowed by them teleporting and the hooked survivors hitbox bieng so big sometimes you hit them throught the one unhooking
---
Fine, go an have your fun.

I'll be the bad guy, and Ill be the baddest guy them all!

So relatable. After many wasted games I started to run Object Of Obsession for the "use 15 pallets" challenge and let the killer see me all the time, and spine chill for gen jockey challenge to avoid being found.
---
I'm not at the 5 trap challenge yet, but I got the 4 people fair and square.
---
Honestly it is not much of a difference between getting 4 or 5: either survivors are smart and then it is tough to get more than 2 or 3, or theyare pretty dumb an step into a lot of traps
---
As for changes, remove the broken status and replace it with a movement/action speed debuff that forces survivors to cleanse after a certain (like a minute or two) amount of time or be completely worthless in a chase/repairing gens

&gt; Or, just farm it
---
And you don't see this as a problem?
---
Wraith! I love your style
---
Ya just gotta get in there
---
She's not bad at all. She's just not rewarded properly for using her power so most people would rather play killers who are rewarded for using their powers.
---
Wait like two days and everyone will have chilled out
---
Hearing them run by, them being a swf and constantly saving the second you leave every time previously, failed flashlight saves commonly follow but just hear for footsteps behind you at that point.
---
And even if you managed to complete all these insane challenges, which let's face it few people can, you still only completed half the pass and have to grind a ton for the rest
---
Looks pretty well-balanced to me. Two kills two escapes. Not really much to complain about here.
---
Its looks like you got to go through killer challenge in order to do survivor challenges.
---
lmao xD
---
Here's an idea: you could use lockers to get 1 bear trap (only 1 trap per locker) and make no traps spawn on the floor. this would make it so the trapper dosent have to spend half his game getting traps from the other end of the map.
---
the fuck is wrong with wanting joker in the game?
---
ignore him...he probably is complaining about iframes and animation delay....pfff some killers r they real gems of reddit.
---
Patience is also a key. If you tried your upmost and didn't work out then retry, fix your mistakes and improve.
---
You can also watch other players and see how they play and learn few things.
---
Ya PC.
---
Her power is more of a detriment if survivors don’t bother cleansing and just rush gens even quicker. While being exposed and loud and coughing sounds like a good trade off, I guarantee you it’s not. Plague’s at her best when one or two cleanse, so you have a projectile that downs anyone, and exerts so much pressure on the ones that are smart and didn’t cleanse.
---
she can be very strong it is just like legion u need the right addons to make her work which isnt very fun
---
L E A T H E R F A C E
---
he’s a good boi. I only got him because of BBQ, and now he’s my favorite killer... even though his add ons are useless and he gets bullied.
---
Or when there are only two of you left and you know for a fact that second survivor is just chilling instead of doing gens
---
I'd say both are true. Personally there isn't a killer I would recommend more than Freddy. He's one of the stronger killers in the game and I find him incredibly fun to play as (especially with the dream pallets). 
---
You can make some good plays with his teleport as well by either faking a teleport to have survivors run right into you, or teleporting to a gen the survivor your chasing is running towards to unexpectedly cut them off.
---
Poor boob3
---
Keys are pretty much meant for stealing killers pips. There should be like a 3 second channel to open the hatch to make it more fair and realistic.
---
Even so, it's very hard to be at 3 gens when they pop in a single game unless you're camping them and solely hopping on them at the end. Or just pretty much the only one doing them in the first place.
---
Idk I've never had a problem revealing him, even while running forward. If you point your camera directly at him it has a pretty forgiving hitbox. Unless you're only running into Ghostfaces using Driver's License, you probably just have to aim better.
---
So that isn’t an “obvious hint” that’s just another hook I’m my cases. The trick is to keep pressure on gens just after hooking which will give them a false sense of assurance in their save attempt. Then you just return to the hook shortly before you suspect a save. Trapper main btw, helps when they take longer to move from their area
---
If you even look like you want to win the game you're a tryhard!
---
You dont know killer do you? Patience isnt as good as you think, its how gens get popped, its fucked hitboxes. And i obvously watch people better then me and learn new things but fucked hitboxes and vacuums have nothing to do with skill or patience, you have no clue what your talking about
---
Same lol
---
Shes just an m1 killer if no one cleanses. Itd be cool if she had a way to get her power on her own like maybe make the 1 add on that spawns 1 corrupt fountain to start with or maybe make it so once 4 survivors are at max sickness you can trigger corrupt purge yourself. She needs something because it really sucks being at the mercy of survivors for whether or not you get to use your power because 9/10 you wont use it at all.
---
It’s okay me too. I’m still doing the dropping pallets down during a chase as survivor. It’s hard for me because I usually never drop down pallets that quick and would rather take a hit :/
---
Basement Trapper &gt; Basement Bubba
---
In terms of fun atleast
---
Gonna be seeing a whole lotta bubba for the next few weeks.
---
Yikes
---
if anything can actually change current meta I am all for it there are other perks out there
---
I will agree Balanced is strong on Haddonfield and The Game but I can't think of any other maps that are extremely affected by the perk. On Springwood it is strong as there is a house but after 3 times going through the window up stairs the loop becomes closed.
---
I think balanced landing has always come into the design of maps otherwise there would not be any point of hills. 
---
The opportunities to use BL are often limited compared to the other exhaustion perks so without the passive there would be no point to using it,
---
I never said the other exhaustion perks need a buff rather a rework so they are more consistent perks. (not being hit with dead hard or hit through a window after using lithe) Or is making perks how they should work a buff?
---
My whole point is to make it so people have more opportunities for different game styles so less people are abusing and then figure out a way to counter. Often people considered the combine to be over powered and have no counter but now there is counter play as killers can lunge across the gap. Just removing this perk from meta would force survivors to become better without it, and then would make the game more survivor sided. I don't think just one perk can dictate whether the game is one sided or the other.
---
Sorry sweetheart but I never complained about bhvr &lt;3
---
Rly? Only half? I feel so dumb I spent 1000 auric cells in this shit
---
Dead hard + BL one of the most disgusting builds, use DH if you can't get on a high spot, BL if you can use it
---
Dude, wtf are you going on about. Yes its obvous when survivors are nearby, and faking going away doesnt fix hitbkxes or vacuum, are you even a high enough rank to see people do this?
---
The game absolutely IS BROKEN if you have the survivor skills of people like Noob3.
---
The problem with this game is that matchmaking is not really based on actual skill and experience at the game.
---
I am a killer main and there are games where I just completely crush survivors even with weak killers and there are plenty games I just get face raped but survivors that are hundreds of times better than me
---
Yeah you're right, but you get my point !
---
No... Console Queue times for survivors is fucking garbage.
---
I'm on the Monstrous Shrine challenge. 
---
I'm doing it for lore, not for fun. Besides, I love playing Bubba
---
time to camp as bubba for easy mode
---
Guess if you take decisive strike and can't swallow 5 seconds or outsmart borrowed time then you're not playing this positively or knowing much.
---
And I'm just giving tips, instead now you're just insulting me at this gag.
---
Good to know you're being mad about this with such tone.
---
I think there is going to be a shift from balanced to dead hard which i don't know what one is would be worse to go against
---
Ruin isn't that hard to push through, even then there is small game or detectives hunch.
---
Ah yes literally 0, or how to completely lose credibility instantly.
---
And nurse have NOT been hurt by the changes that much, as the "before/after" statistics clearly show, the killrate went down by around 5%, so the rework is not to blame. At least not a lot.
---
That would be unfortunate after they came out with Billy 2.
---
You need to sacrifice the corresponding survivor 25 times each (the original 4) . Really fun challenge IMO :)
---
Can you explain why? I've been playing for like a month and don't know what's what just yet xD
---
Better than the tier 3/4 archives
---
That happen to me but in killer side, like it’s too ez idk why killers complain that much lol
---
Like Kate would be harder to hit when she 360. I was thinking about that, or she could sing a little song and that would be her own radius that survivors could hear to find her.
---
Tapp would scratch his neck everytime the Huntress would try to throw an hatchet, or everytime Spirit phases. Just a small indication to warn you
---
On annual leave, haven't seen tier 3 yet. What are the highlights?
---
Anyone who breaks my devour gets camped for a whole ass 20 seconds. I honestly don’t see the point in camping, like I rather put my focus on survivors that are trying to pop gens than sit on top of someone’s face securing  a kill. 
---
That’s just me tho
---
Otz did it first
---
I am. If I know they’re getting free I just let them do it. Borrowed is whatever, it makes the game more exciting. If they don’t, the hook timer advances. And then you get another survivor to chase. Basically if they’re in the animation just wait for the unhook to finish. It’s speeding up your kill
---
Legion rework: remove him from the game.
---
Except he didn't use his ability while they were in his terror radius, he used it and then charged at them which then instantly changed into a multi- insta down attack.
---
Sorry man, I guess my sarcasm got the better of me again lol
---
Again, you still dont know. That 5 seconds is nlonger then 5 seconds cause there is the unhook the down thw pick up, then the 5 seconds stun, then the chase, down, pickup, hook. And you cant "outsmart" barrowed time with every killer, you can with pig, wraith, and ghostface and even then you can only do it whith ghostface if your ability isnt on cooldown
---
Man, I was called a sweaty killer while I was aying Doctor because I 'slugged for the 4k' (after I knocked the 3rd survivor, an injured survivor screamed), 'tunneled and camped' a Steve (they constantly went for safe unhooks, swarmed the hooks, and at one point, Steve casually slow vaulted out of a window in front of me after I let him go purposely. I even gave the hatch to the last survivor, but no, I'm definitely sweaty.
---
2016 bois rise up
---
&gt; Will this nerf completely eliminate BL from being a perk worth using though?
---
Before it was buffed to always give the stagger reduction it was consider a fairly mediocre perk that was hardly used. They are adding in that it'll remove the grunting noise you make when you drop (while not exhausted) so it might be usable for some stealth builds similar to how people might run Q+Q. Dance with me, and lithe. Outside of a stealth kind of build though I don't think it will be worth running anymore.
---
I dont care about barrowed, i care about rhe vacuum and MASSIVE hooked survicor hitboxes
---
I was really excited to play when it came out was disappointed but definitely not as bad as people say it is but would still rather play fallout 4 or fallout 3 hopefully they are coming out with a new fallout (story)
---
Man, true, really cant progress that shit without those extra 5 shards
---
Last time I watched him he was tryharding and upset that people were able to do 3+ gens..
---
Killers get ranked on mostly 3 things imo 
---
Map Pressure 
---
Chase game 
---
Stalling the game 
---
Old nurse excelled at Chases and Map Pressure to an amount where stalling wasn’t necessary. Playing her ideally basically negated all options survivors had. 
---
The problem mostly was if you restrict her chase game  it’s gonna dump her right down to shit tier since you can’t buff her speed with an ability this strong. 
---
IMO what the devs did was a really good option to get her on the right edge since currently Billy seems to be one of- if not- the best balanced killers in the game base ability-wise. 
---
It feels like by having her choose between Map Pressure or Strong chase game and not offering both at the same time, she ended up at an as close as possible level to that balance state.
---
I feel whoever designed the entire game doesn't actually play the game at any normal frequency. All the balance changes are filled with complete lack of understanding about fundamentals of the game
---
Meg should only be 1% alright.
---
Tapp would be THE Spirit counter dude, yall missing on him like that but I did him really good B)
---
It's not very hard. People leave gens at different stages all the time. You do one by yourself and then you look for gens someone else has started but didn't finish. It took me 3 games I think. Could take more if you're unlucky but let's not exaggerate the difficulty.
---
All he had to do was chainsaw. Even the tantrum can instadown. Works more often than youd expect
---
Yes lmao killer challenges are less harden than survivor ones and only because you can actually farm lol
---
For the last two I honestly started walking around and smacking generators and shit until I gained trust and started farming.
---
Imagine if BHVR would test their stuff, we'd never ever have "fat-shaming" spots
---
Its just rough when you play against survivors that know how skewed things are in their favor. Like they dont even pretend to play against you. As soon as the match starts they spread out and hop on separate gens and when you find one they just run forward and waste a load of your time, dropping every pallet immediately knowing you have to give up chase on them cuz you cant afford to commit to a chase for more than 30 seconds. And whenever you hit someone they just use their speed boost to easily make it from literally anywhere on the map all the way to the central god loop because again they know you cant follow them there or you lose the game. Honestly this game would be unplayable if survivors just 1. Worked on gens when not in chase 2. Just threw down pallets because really theyre a more plentiful resource than people think 3. Ran in straight lines more often. Like if you run in a straight line as soon as you hear tr it takes the killer 40 sec to down you through the speed burst.
---
It's chill, I personally don't care, I was just scrolling through an thought I'd try to give some insight as to why people are taking your meme so seriously lol
---
Yeah we should delete the hitboxes from the hooked survivor so there is no way to rescue that person as another survivor when the killer camps. Bro camping is way too hard already. Everyone is running borrowed time... How am I supposed to camp ???
---
A Trapper did the same to me. End game chat, he said he did it because I was a 'troll'. Ya, breaking the totem is not part of the game it seems lol
---
I would suggest an add on which slow the action of survivors when infected to counter the not-cleanse strategy. 3 different add ons, slightly, moderately and tremendously.
---
That was pretty much it's main use. The speed boost didn't matter as much. Hell it could have that removed. It was the stagger reduction that helped.
---
Oh and yeah, drop loop onceon the game. Basically the most killer favored map till the lab was released.
---
Oh wait the lab also focused on a lot of drop loops to even stand a chance.
---
Yea that happens when you have enough time in the game where you stop caring so much about whether you win or lose as long as the game was fun. Running into people going full try hard sucks on both sides.
---
Sometimes I just want to mess around with Diversion and see if I can confuse a killer into checking empty lockers, but I get a prayer beads Spirit who sucks the fun out of it.
---
Sometimes I just want to play Santa Clown and get enough hooks for my BBQ stacks, but then I get a super try hard SWF that would rather spend more time searching for a game than actually playing in one.
---
Personally I try to stick to purple ranks as much as I can on killer and survivor. You still run into try hards here and there, but that's where the majority of people seem to be that care more about fun than winning at all cost.
---
I get the hitboxes is your problem, that's why I mentioned them in the second half of my comment.
---
Thank you. To be more specific:
---
2-person SWF = 1.5x BP; safety, 1 pip and 2 pip requirements decreased by 1 point.
---
3-person SWF/2x 2-person SWF = 2x BP; safety, 1 pip and 2 pip requirements decreased by 2 points.
---
4-person SWF = 3x BP; safety, 1 pip and 2 pip requirements decreased by 3 points.
---
None of this negatively affects the Survivors, who aren't punished for playing with their friends. They aren't even aware this is a thing. It merely makes these matches less stressful for the Killer. Win-win.
---
***Doubling blood points!***
---
Congrats, on the 2nd most stupid comment i've seen on a dead by daylight post
---
Not even worth talking about tbh. A Max of like 12xp from them
---
Incoming 4th survivor running to the opposite side of the map and teabagging.
---
Again, they have a vacuum that you cant do anything about, so that doesnt help either, its a bug that needs patching that will be abused until it is patched
---
&gt;That's not a paradox, they are literally two different, unrelated pipping systems. 
---
I'm usually red rank both sides myself, and while I admittedly only very seldomly pay much of any attention to my Emblem/pip performance, I'm pretty sure I could maintain red rank with below 50% rates on either side. If I don't camp, tunnel or slug but play a "hook-it-and-book-it" playstyle, get around 8 or more hooks, and maybe end up sacrificing 1 survivor, I am still very likely to pip, or at least safety-pip, certainly not depip.
---
Regardless, it's obviously not a paradox, I just used that argument to highlight that I don't think it's accurate to assume that killer pips are in such a strong correlation with kills that kill rates of at least 60% are a necessity in red ranks, while survival rates average around 30-something percent without invoking a survivorship bias there.
---
&gt;being killer sided on a single statistic isn't super meaningful
---
I think what it primarily shows is that when both sides are not so good at the game, or only mediocre, killers have a clear advantage, and most players fall within that not-good-to-mediocre-at-best range, from my experience.
---
This happens to me about 95% of the time when I go for a grab. Shit pisses me off so bad, because I get them so rarely as it is.
---
I think that this is true? I really don't understand what you commented😂😂 I'm not that smart rbh

Can you start a new challenge without collecting the reward of the previous challenge then?
---
Well Trapper can be one of the most fun killers to play if you play your cards right. But then again, SWF's and OoO are a thing
---
Yeah that might work, but it's not fun for anyone, at least not for and once you have the 3rd person in the basement the 4th might not even bother so you'll have to slug the 3rd survivor making this a pain in the butt. Anyway that's just my opinion.
---
Yeah... I just got 4 red emblems and it only counted 1.
---
The best possible joke for this situation. Bravo good sir
---
Yeah. You're absolutely right. Kind of bolsters the point that some of the challenges encourage toxic/stupid behavior.
---
Oh i'm absolutely farming every single one of these that can be farmed, simply because the challenges are either a boring grind or waiting for the stars to align for you type of thing which adds nothing to the core gameplay, just distracts from it and not in a good way.
---
+ for this, also are the challenges time based? Will they not be obtainable after some time? Because the recent challenges is not gonna be possible for casual gamers to obtain. I noticed some of my buds are stressing there asses of to get these done, and explains their frustration of how they didn’t get a sale unhook last game. It’s sad because a lot of people were addicted to this game before the challenges, and when new stuff releases they want to be first on the ball.
---
Hot tip: play Doctor, injure a survivor, and go into treatment mode for the chase. Hitting M1 still counts as a potential grab action but you don't have to wait for the attack cooldown if you miss the grab.
---
You can do stuff against the vacuum, I attempt to do that everytime someone hook rushes. If you played pc when they were testing dedicated servers on it they made it so the person on the hook had no hitbox and it's staying that way until the update on the 3rd, so you could've gone and seen if you really don't like hook hitboxes.

I’ve seen your other post. Pretty unimpressive. No logic, no stats to back their claims. Very sad.

Is there a reason why?

Im on xbox, and i dont get why they didnt add that, did it rake something away from survivors cause i havnt heard much from that except saw it quickly

None of my friends have xbox :^/

Thanks that was my plan lol. Nice way to stack for new chapter
---
Totally agree, all survivors are just reskins of each other, so it sucks that you basically have to play with a specific skin just to complete a challenge
---
Get good at disappearing into the map bro
---
Well it's 750k bloodpoints for free. I ain't complaining.
---
I agree the survivor on the hook should have a smaller hitbox slightly but it's definitely counterable, especially if you know someone is abusing it.
---
💕
---
How entitled can one get? No one forces you to do them. They're entirely optional and I for one don't mind at all that I have some other objective than just trying to escape or sacrifice survivors. Bitching about free content has always baffled me...
---
Reminds me of wonder woman
---
I bought it but idk i liked fallout 4 better but maybe it’s because none my my friends play it :(
---
IT HAPPENS A LOT WITH LOWER RANKS. IF YOU ARE A HIGH RANK KILLER, QUEUES ARE ALMOST INSTANT, AS THERE ARE VERY FEW TO GO AROUND. I ALSO RECOMMEND QUEUING UP WHEN THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE PLAYING(USUALLY EARLY EVENING), AS THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE LOADING TIMES.
---
Are u dumb or somthing?U first said 30 fps then u compare 60 fps with 165 fps??30 fps and 60 fps is heaven and earth difference.Regardless of either survivor or killer,console dbd players would get rekt by pc players mainly due to fps
---
that's exaclty what i've been doing. No way in hell i'm competing against people for the unhooking right now.
---
And indeed, the killer games procced so fast, it was incredible !
---
Don’t let them brain wash you
---
These challenges that are cumulative grinds would be ok of you could have more than one on the go. 
---
It's like the artificial padding added to Modern Warfare when you have to equip your missions now instead of challenges.
---
Oh you didnt have the challenge equipped for the really fucking hard feat but actually managed to do it? To bad.
---
How about let me earn a little bit of progress towards a few? Would feel less grindy then.
---
The only instances I've teabagged at the exit gate that I recall are when we're talking super-hard-facecamping by killers with an instant down or occasionally one that stealths to avoid BT in some fashion.
---
Like I've teabagged Leatherface's who just rev their chainsaw for two minutes in my friend's face, or Ghostface's who camp every single hook even when no one is nearby and are still there, crouching in a bush outside the basement when you go for the save, 45 seconds later.
---
Playing killer can still be fun.
---
"Back in the day" you were probably just new to the game and didn't understand things that you now do. IMO ofc
---
It needs to be matching with the visuals, cause i hate trying to hit a survivir that is unhooking in front of me and the hit going through them and hitting the hooked survivor
---
I mean, do you give them the totem afterwards? Also, if you want to get a grab challenge, might I recommend a regular farming round? First just ask survivors to drop pallets on you for a while and later, while they're doing gens, just grab them off and drop them on the ground right after.
---
Take your upvote and leave (￣∀￣)
---
I can already smell the basement bubbas in the air
---
I tell you this, I would love to buy it, even with all these problems cause the handheld factor is always extremely nice, but, as a veteran player it **needs** to have cross progression, they are insane releasing this without such a function. Who in their right mind starts all over there without all the bought dlc, cosmetics and trained characters?
---
Nice for all new people but for someone like me, completely uninteresting.
---
And to the "support" point, as far as I know it still doesn't have the archives and battle pass and that's really ridiculous, shame on BHVR for that one.
---
By that same logic, isn't Noob3 running a purple flashlight with a red (odd bulb) or purple (that lens) and green addon (battery) also really boring?
---
No he didnt
---
BHVR can't even fix basic unhooking animations after 3+ years, let alone any of these changes
---
At least once more lol
---
I WANT ALL OF YOU FUCK HEADS TO HAVE A NICE THURSDAY. I MAY BE LATE TO THIS THREAD BUT I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT YOU’RE LOVED BY THOSE AROUND YOU AND YOU SHOULD STAY POSITIVE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THIS GAME BULLSHITS YOU
---
They need to make second wind not be fucked over if an urban evading claudette comes in and snipes the last 1% of the heal you're working on.
---
1 (and 3): That's not how any of that works. Scenario: 2 baby survivors, 2 god survivors, 1 god killer. 
---
All that's gonna happen is that the killer will basically have a 1v2, since 2 of the survivors he chases will be piss easy to down, pressuring the other two to pick up the slack. With SBMM, it tries to keep the skill disparity fair. Emphasis on "tries". Yes it doesn't always work and yes yes rank =/ skill, I know, but it's better than throwing darts at a wall and pairing whoever with whoever. 
---
2:No, it does not. I am in red ranks. Both sides. As much as I hate bringing the "I'm so-and-so rank" phrase in arguments, this is at least appropriate. 
---
I equally get as many games as killer against super sweats with socket commodious / ranger or emergency medkits with addons, and every 2nd chance perk in the book as I go against 4head survivors who don't know how to play a loop, read a mindgame, be unpredictable, etc.  
---
I get equally as many games as survivor against Trappers going for dailies or rift, killers on survivor sides maps, memester killers, funny builds as I do going against moris, stacked BS addons like forever freddys or re-setting, injuring traps, etc. 
---
These super sweaty players are not rampant. And if you FEEL as if EVERY game is against super sweats, then with no offence, you may not be that good as killer / survivor.
---
4: I totally agree with you. This game is not, and never will be an e-sport. Hell, the recent "tournament" was mostly hijacked by memes. I get it. 
---
But these ranks still give some roundabout assurance that those who are better or worse at the game get matched up with similarly skilled people. Rank =/ skill, I know, again. But it does in a very loose sense. It helps. Thus, helps the player base not be bored going against morons, or be frustrated going against the sweats.
---
GOOD LUCK GETTING ADAPT WITH HAG IF YOU ACTUALLY MAKE USE OF DEVOUR HOPE THOUGH.
---
 #1 and 4 shouldn't be there.
---
All of the new Badham pallet loops fall into two catagories. Insanely safe and not mindgame-able by the killer or extremely unsafe and barely mindgame-able. Meanwhile some of these 'ridiculous' pallet loops that are really safe are only that safe it the killer holds W. As soon as you mind game and don't have eyes on the killer you have to react, and moving in the wrong direction will make you take a hit. Sure some loops are really safe but its nothing a decent killer cant mind game.
---
I definitely find keys bullshit at times, but at other times I have also played games as Huntress Plague Bubba Trapper and Hag where I have a 3-gen where I have Line-of-Sight on the other two gens when standing at one, and could easily get to the other one before it progresses far even if I am at the furthest generator, making it literally impossible for the survivors to win until they either brought a key or plundered every single chest to find one. Sure they could have just payed a ton of attention to the gens they were completing, but I don't think being expected to do that should part of the game until red ranks (and even then its absurd).
---
And hope that no ed isn't still active
---
They first need to rework perks that let the survivors be invulnerable for 60 seconds after being unhooked.
---
&gt;make the 1 add on that spawns 1 corrupt fountain to start with 
---
The apple addons do exactly this
---
There could be points on the edge of the map where one can climb up and tap out while another hops in.
---
To be honest, if the last survivor alive turns out to be someone I haven't seen all match, I become very hesitant to give them hatch
---
Nice spelling btw
---
Yeah... I know I fucked up spelling balanced
---
DEVOUR HOPE WAS ACTUALLY WHAT CARRIED MY SORRY ASS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT, BUT THAT WAS PURELY FOR THE INSTADOWNS, I DIDN'T MORI PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE I GET THE FULL 8K POINTS FOR SACRIFICE.
---
4k challenge triggers on the 'no-one survived' trigger I think, so it makes sense you get the 4k challenge for that
---
Julie sucks, Susie is queen
---
Honestly it's the fault of those guys who came on Reddit and posted how "the challenges were too easy" to the point Behaviour actually responded. I saw this coming a mile away.
---
This wouldnt make them any less broken. It would just stop more clutch escapes.
---
I feel them and moris are unbalanced but they keep the game a bit interesting. They remove much more and this games gonna get more and more stale
---
The correct answer is "anything not neon pink nor weeby."
---
I agree with this post 100% because I love playing both killer and survivor and I just kinda get mad when I play killer and this happens lol
---
As a killer main Im loving the nerfs! Please continue, i dont like using overpowered killers. I only got to enjoy Nurse after the nerfs
---
I don’t see this really. Other than buying the game and it’s DLC (all for half price) I haven’t felt pressured at all to spend more money on the game. It seems like they genuinely do take feedback from the community to implement positive change without paying for it. 
---
How does having hard challenges help them make money? If anything I thought the game was missing something like this that added more variety and challenge to a repetitive game. Also, the only battle pass I’ve seen where you can basically get double your money’s worth by getting it. I’d agree if it was like a lot of games where you had to get a loot box and pay for a key to get the skins, but a lot you can earn with shards  or through the Rift now. 
---
We have like 40 days to finish the rift. I’ve played for 27 hours and am almost done with Tier 2. How is that so bad? Even if the last two tiers are difficult, we have plenty of time to complete them.
---
You're the type of monster killers check their closet for.
---
I wouldn't say all.
---
Hag literally eats people alive and its beautiful and horrifying.
---
Legions is insanely brutal and the emphasis on Legion and the survivors being similar in stature with the fighting that goes on during the Mori is amazing.
---
However, things like Trapper and Wraith hitting people a handful of times is pretty lame.
---
If you really have a shit about your community, fix your times. Your veterans don’t like them, what makes you think newcomers will. Fix your shit.
---
So close Cut?
---
The funny thing is most of the people I talk to on dbd who want to play killer tell me they don't play killer because the cue times are too long so it's a self fulfilling prophecy
---
its fine if the challenges doesnt require the stars to allign. its fine if its easily doable. its fine if it doesnt make you want to rip your hair out. they are optional but who would want to miss out on getting the rift fragments to level up their rift? rift owners are basically forced to do these hard challenges to even get close to finishing their rift without grinding too much for xp.
---
Doh Doh Doh
---
Me but with survivor
---
You bet. My build of Babysitter + Borrowed is the ultimate bro build. I’m actually pretty decent at looping, so when I run that i usually will get facecamped.
---
&gt; Not sure how effective my reports are.
---
One of my favorite things from League of Legends was when I reported someone and they got punished the next time I opened the client I would get an 'Instant Feedback Report' telling me that recently, someone who I reported, was punished. This alone added weight to the supports. That means that they are looked at, even if just by a bot.
---
Buff Legion, nerf DS, remove NOED, and Jane jiggle physics
---
He’s so chill and I love the fact he vapes, because me and my friends do it while playing dbd and it’s kind of like our thing lol
---
He... he‘s an idiot xD He walked straight to you while you were flashlighting, not even tried to not get blinded
---
From those options, I suppose.
---
*moonwalks to exposed survivor*
---
You’ve been hit by 
---
You’ve been struck by 
---
A smooth criminal
---
Also rework moris
---
&gt; Sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement. Complete in same trial
---
This one's nothing too special though. Go Trapper or Hag and hope basement is in the Shack. Set up a 3 gen around the Shack (with basement) and run Agitation (maybe even territorial or monsterous but I think meta perks are more usefull). Trap the shack and the general area, chase someone in there, down them and quite often survivors will be overly altruisitic and you can kill them in the basement. 
---
The other ones I agree are semi impossible.
---
.. **FUCK**
---
What if they crawl out or bleed out before the timer runs out?
---
My flair doesn’t help
---
Imagine how smooth that daddy dick is in this form.
---
Nice to see Meg getting some love rather than being bullied
---
Survivor Rulebook, remember as killer you are their for their entertainment and nothing else, you need to provide a little bit of a threat, but nothing too hard or they might get sad.
---
If you ever are facing a killer that is unfun, just remember to disconnect and eventually the devs with nerf it /s.
---
Lets be real this game is still quite far away from killers really being a power role in 90% of situations and thats more because of underlying gameplay issues that effect both sides and make both sides have unfun gameplay loops.
---
Nerfing survivor again, but letting killers hit you through a window, after vaulting and already running. When I play killer sometimes I lunge at a window knowing it shouldn't hit, but sometimes it does.
---
The game is just way too easy for the killer
---
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED SOME MORE FUCKING PRACTICE AT HATCHET-DODGING, IT'S NOT EVERY TIME, BUT RANK 5 HUNTRESSES HAVE STILL MISSED ME WITH ALL FIVE.  
---
IRI HEAD POINT BLANK IS SCUMMY, BUT THE RIGHT-CLICK LEFT-CLICK COMBO OF HATCHET+ATTACK IS BASICALLY THE SAME THING.  
---
NOT GONNA LIKE THE ADDITION OF AN EBONY MORI MAKES GAMES AN OVERLY IMMERSIVE DRAG, HOWEVER.
---
&gt; anyone struggling with the trapper trap challenges
---
How does one struggle with those, just set up traps around loops, vaults and hooks and pray it's not a SWF with Object and it's super easy to get.
---
I don't play Trapper much but I got both of those in 1 try.
---
That would remove all doubts that legion is a ghostface ripoff
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;#Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;#We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;# If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
Never said it was. I'm just saying if you flipped this meme around if ruin was getting nerfed then it would he massively downvoted.
---
I skipped that one and went the killer route. Now on the damn bugged iridescent emblem. Kinda BS this is broken because it will take 15 games to complete it.
---
It's not so much as they are difficult it's they are too time consuming! They intentionality force us to do them separately instead of making them all active at the same time like with Fortnite weekly challenges..., some of them have great synergy like "pallet stun killer 2 times" "flashlight killer 2 times" instead od beign able to stack them you have to play at least two different games for that and THROW a game in a sense since you NEED to focus on certain challenge...
---
And some are just stupid hard like safe unhooks during end game....
---
Nah, but ideally you’d complete one that branches off several ways, then complete and don’t collect the branches so you can have 2 to 3 saved.
---
a survivor that's able to predict killer's movements ...
---
imagine smth like I'm All Ears (not sure if it's the right name for the perk) but for survivors, after killer vaults a window ya can see his aura for some time or smth like this..
---
If you're bent on just grabbing that one survivor, you could just wait a full minute before opening the locker. Or you can open it, get ds'd, then chase them for a minute. Either way, you are purposely going after the person just unhooked rather than turning your attention to the survivor who did the unhooking.
---
Yeah, I remember one time, I DCed as killer (earlier back like 2 months ago, I regret it now), because I wanted to try a perkless and addonless Trapper, but that was no fun at all. Had people message me GG EZ easily and made fun of me for being a baby trapper.
---
But whenever a survivor dcs, their excuse is always, "they werent having fun" or "i dont like playing against sweaty/specific killers" and its really annoying.
---
You broke him lol
---
God yesterday got a game where a Tapp did shit the entire game like sell me out, body blocking and waste all the pallets. Thank God we all died.
---
And here lies BHVR's masterstroke, they are gonna be rushing hooks in order to finish their 25 unhooks challenge.
---
Iz  meee open ur door
---
*Violently Torture Dances at the exit*
---
Everyone is farming everyone, and every hook is in the basement. Enjoy.
---
Did you get Leg or Ion?
---
The only challenge I haven't been able to do in tier 2 is blinding the Killer twice in a single match. It doesn't matter how powerful by flashlights are and if I use them while the Killer's breaking a pallet. No success, ever. I find that challenge particularly annoying because it requires me to even go look for the Killer just to do it or stop running during a chase.
---
The issue with farm matches is they do 8 hooks before gens are done, there's no endgame hooks to unhook.
---
I don't really watch many movies nor maifa films for that matter but am looking forward to watching it this weekend.
---
Fucking degenerate, you forgot the Trash Man!
---
I haven't had too much trouble with 3 so far. I've done the first few challenges no problem. Looking forward though some of these challenges are fucking stupid. Why in the hell are they encouraging basement bubba?? The fifteen basement hook challenge made me do a ton of "patrolling" but the two basement hooks at the same time is fucking stupid since Insidious camping will definitely be the easiest way to have two people in basement at once. I'll do it then place nice for the rest of the game.
---
True. It often depends on the available challenges, whether I play as killer or survivor, even though I currently don't want to play the role I'm queueing for. Sometimes I need to do things as the killer that I don't want to do (I never hang people in the cellar), apologizing afterwards to the survivors. Or I spend half of the match as a survivor hunting totems and chests instead of helping my team, also giving me a bad consciousness. 
---
The last one is also noticable when you actually try to focus on the objective, but your team doesn't do anything.
---
In the beginning I liked having a new motivation besides just getting points, but the challenges are the worst thing that could have happened to the game. I actually uninstalled it to prevent me from grinding all night, which I did for the first tome.
---
Dude no one cares

It will be dropped 18th of december

I find solo survivor is ass compared to killer BUT playing swf with a buddy or two is way more fun.
---
THE RIFT CHALLENGES ARE SO FUCKING FRUSTRATING, THE FACT THAT YOU CANT CHOSE MULTIPLE AT ONCE IS STRAIGHT UP TO WORSEN THE GRIND, ALL THEY ARE DOING IN THEIR CURRENT STATE IS PROMOTING FARMING OR PLAYING LIKE A TOXIC ASSHOLE

CURRENTLY TRYING TO DO THE 15 HOOKS IN THE BASEMENT AND PLAYING LIKE THAT IS SO FUCKING BORING AND I KNOW THE SURVIVORS ARE HAVING JUST AS MUCH FUN AS I AM WHEN IM BASICALLY CAMPING THEM

Hopefully those are just placeholders

Pop go my braincells

True true

The game is way more killer sided now lol.. You're just fucking bad.

Annoying as survivor too when lag leads to hits that should have missed. (I play both killer/survivor and both are annoying)

I am just asking, what exactly are you trying to show here with this screenshot?
---
This Rift closes on the 8th of January 2020, 70 days after it opened on the 30th of October 2019.
---
Assuming the 14.5 mid-chapter patch goes live on the 14th of January 2020, the next rift will open at the same time.
---
However, this would likely mean the PTB would start on the 31st of December 2019. This is unlikely because;
---
1. BHVR will be closed for the holidays
---
2. Having on Rift on live servers and another on the PTB would likely break things.
---
As such, the 14.5 PTB will likely start on the 14th of January, with the patch going live on the 28th of January.
---
TL;DR - The next rift will start just under 3 weeks after this one closes.
---
HONESTLY YOUR BETTER OFF SURVIVOR SIDE. IT'S A SCRAMBLE TO UNHOOK. I SEE 3 PEOPLE RUNNING AT ME THEN 1 HAS TO SEE THE FIRST AND THE LAST THE OTHER 2 BUT THEY ALL COME ANYWAY. KILLERS CATCHING ON AND PROXY FARM. I'M SURE YOU WILL SEE WHAT I'VE BEEN.
---
wtf this shit ??
---
I got called toxic for playing default doc with tier 1 overcharge. I asked what I did, and the guy just told me that default doc is toxic. Apparently doctor’s cosmetics are toxic now
---
Seems you are the one who is triggered. Just chill out man
---
Or replace it with STBFL or something to help kill.
---
Monstrous Shrine just sucks in general. It’s not worth even for a basement build.
---
lol sounds like someone whose never had a hobby he enjoys.
---
I had the “ sacrifice 15 survivor to the entity” .
---
I did it while playing as a survivor. I think every sacrifice in the march counted for the achievement because I finished it really fast without actually playing as a killer...
---
All four matches I played yesterday had me getting a 3K only for the last survivor who I never seen near any gens, hooks or totems find the hatch within two milliseconds of it opening.
---
'cause before BL was in the same state as it is in PTB right now.
---
That good. Playing your favorite daily for years can fuck you up.
---
PSA: On PC if you check the game files, you can watch all 4 movies that should be unlocked at the end of the rift.
---
#Look who's shittin on thw wrong toilet
---
Yesterday I (rank 6) was queueing with my 2 friends (rank 14 / rank 10) just for some casual games, we are all relatively similar skill but due to not having loads of time I'm higher ranked than they are.
---
But the other random we got was rank 2 and we had a rank 4 killer, how does this happen?
---
"just cleanse the totems against a prayer beads spirit"
---
I think it'd be more fun if you could either teleport and/or strategically move them around so they could do different things.
---
Example: one Legion member hides in a locker.  If a Survivor goes to that locker, that member will make some noise to draw the Legion player's attention and grabs the Survivor.  The Survivor just has to do a quick struggle action to free their self (maybe with an addon it could be harder than one attempt) and there are two different scenarios that can play out:  one, the Legion player was already close by so they can stab/grab the Survivor; two, the Survivor breaks free and the Legion player can swap control to that other Legion member.
---
Could also maybe have them position near window vaults so they can catch someone mid-vault and do a similar thing, or near pallets and they would basically just keep that pallet held up so a Survivor can't throw it down.   
---
Or basically each Legion member has their own unique behavior akin to that (Susie hides in lockers, Joey holds pallets, Julie lurks below vaults, Frank does a mixture?), and they move around with fixations on different Survivors.
---
It'd create a whole new dynamic and kind of give that feeling of a pseudo-4v4.  Yeah it'd require a mechanical rework, but it'd be one that's more fitting.  
---
Then they could try to figure out a better Killer to have a retooled version of Feral Frenzy.  Or just scrap that all together because it's such a balance issue.
---
Carl the Cashier strikes again
---
WHY DO I KEEP FINDING HIGH UP GREEN RANK SURVIVORS WHENEVER I PLAY KILLER!? IM RANK 16 THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
---
Honestly just remove the dark clothing on claudette. Cosmetics giving no competitive advantage my ass.
---
I love playing against demogorgon cause its one of the only killers who are actually scary. His chase music is also really tense.
---
You can watch Otz against such a group with Freddy if you'd like...
---
They might be doing it to get the unhook challenges done which is just sad.
---
Dead by Daylight is a very psychologically punishing game. I would highly recommend reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dostqx/udbdanalytics_wrote_an_interesting_article_about/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), where someone analyzed the actual psychological effects of the game and suggested strategies. Unfortunately not everyone can take the stress of the game and cope effectively. That’s why you have people moaning about keys and loops and being boosted and moris and anything that they can’t directly control. It’s just a game, with a ranking system that means nothing, but humiliation fuels anger and feeling vulnerable. This isn’t to say that each side doesn’t have their own issues, but sometimes people on here forget that they’re still playing with real people, and usually decent ones.
---
Actually, Freddy is next in line to get nerfed. Billy needs a rework, as he doesn't have the right number of add-ons.
---
Vaping isn't a hobby lmao I've played baseball for 13 years, drums for 9 years and piano for 6 years so thanks for caring about me enjoying hobbies
---
I feel like it needs a lot of things to improve it. Obviously, graphics could be improved and variation in graphical design to make it feel more unique. I also think custom chase music to make the game more scary and perhaps more atmospheric noises and music to suit when a survivor is not in a chase to keep the terror throughout the match. A real problem I feel survivors face is after playing for a while and getting to a decent rank, killers just aren’t scary anymore unless you get jumpscared. There is no long lasting ambiance that keeps survivors scared and engaged. The second a survivor determines who the killer is, all fear is gone as they know what to do to counter them. I know that the more you play, the more familiar you get with the game and therefore it doesn’t scare you anymore. I also know the devs don’t want to add a ‘scared’ meter for survivors because they care about how scared the player is but maybe it would help. Perhaps if a survivor has spent a long time near the killer, they breathe heavier and cry making slightly more noise. Maybe they are extra jumpy when they hear a noise, etc. 
---
It would also help to flesh out status effects more so they aren’t just a buff or debuff on the screen. If a character is exhausted, they should breathe heavier. If a character is inflicted with madness, they could twitch slightly. If a character is broken or mangled, maybe they could be more slumped or more injuries are visible. These effects may only appear to the survivor or may not make any noise on the killer end but it would definitely make the game scarier.
---
Unbuckle the damn belt! God :|
---
Survivor toxic playing with friends bad
---
This is not as hard as it seems
---
All they have to do to make these challenges okayish is remove the idiotic "in a single trial" requirement. 
---
Tome challenges is the worst thing that happened to DbD.
---
BHVR actively promotes toxicity with these challenges. It promotes excessive farming, extra sweatiness, camping, frustration and all kinds of BMs. Instead of playing the game normally each player just tries to do their own thing. Game is now a shitshow thanks to BHVR and their genuis challenges ideas.
---
I had to pick a survivor back up so they didn't bleed out before the hatch opened. Their survivor friend would have killed them if I didn't intervene
---
Mask should leave when oni is released
---
Bubba can hit Borrowed Timed person twice with one use of his chainsaw
---
To me it happens for most of the challenges, even from level 2
---
but I hate playing Bubba😂
---
&gt; challenge
---
Sacrifice 13 survivors counts if you are the survivor :D
---
Not kidding there
---
Maybe Trapper, but not other killers.
---
It has a 56% kill rate, meaning killers still have a slight edge even in the worst killer map in the game
---
Don’t worry forever killer here. I enjoy getting abused
---
pretty much or a swf or a farming match
---
Why didn't you try to run out after she hatcheted you? Granted, you gotten far enough from a melee attack due to her short hatchet cool down, still worth a try to the nearest pallet on the boat.
---
It is situational, but when it's at its strongest, you get balanced landing only infinites.
---
Well in the afternoon they'll have the black friday sale in game
---
Steve, Nancy Demogorgon 30% off with cells
---
Check for legion with Joey black outfit and half blooded mask running the basic legion build in Europe
---
Killer main. I concur
---
As a trapper main I feel left out!
---
PC also
---
Shit really? I though Ace has super powers or something
---
For the pallet/ generator one I'd probably just run surveillance on Freddy, along with spirit fury enduring.
---
You just need to reach the end
---
Only realistic nerf they'd do to it is make it so it doesn't proc off hooks or saves
---
Keys are easy to counter. See someone with a key in the lobby? Run Franklin's. Of course it's not 100% foolproof but at least it makes it harder for them to use it.
---
Moris are a different breed altogether. There's no counter for it except maybe running to a closet with DS but even that only delays it for a few seconds. If the killer decides to mori you after the first hook there's pretty much nothing you can do about it.
---
Same
---
ECG 2 safe unhooks is just too dependent on chance. Don see it happening anytime soon in a solo survivor queue.
---
Should’ve just finished it..
---
we did and we all escaped i can send the clip of me finishing it
---
He’s been moved for over a week and now he’s having “issues” with running dbd. IMHO he’s just burnt out and doesn’t want to hurt his audience by admitting he’s burnt out on the game
---
Could you imagine Bubbs in dbd with his outfit being the green bastard? Just running around fucking clobbering megs
---
YEAH GOOD POINT, THAT'S BULLSHIT TOO.
---
No I meant you should have never got off it in general. But it’s good you guys still escaped.
---
Keys and moris both need hard reworks/nerfs.
---
The 15 red emblems is broken as fuck right now too. It only registers 1 red even if you get 4. 
---
But just start going backwards. Might as well try. The rest of the challenges aren’t really difficult.
---
i use the jiggsaw piece offering.
---
Understandable. A lot of us won't even complete 10% of Level 4 when it drops. BHVR was smoking crack when they made up these later challenges.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e2wbyn/are_the_archives_in_general_extremely_buggy_or_is/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
If they fix the issues I’m ok with one challenge at a time. But the iridescent challenge is bugged so it will take more than 15 games to complete since it only gives you credit for 1 even if you get 4 ireidesent emblems. I’ll most likely get through the entire rift since in at the end of the 6th page but for folks late in the game it’s BS
---
This fucking game
---
I'm already level 60 in the rift without even doing a single challange in the part 3, so basically you don;t need to do them
---
what about the challenge of doing three gens in a single trial?
---
that means that you need to do more gens than the rest of your team combined, right?
---
Just run Borrowed Time lol
---
Yeah I’ll just change my username to “Killer, Add Me” and hope to god that I can do a single challenge
---
I don't get why people are complaining lol. It's not that hard. Well at least to me it's not.
---
Its the fucking demodog. Get it right
---
Wait, really?! Oh my god, I thought I had to get a fucking SWF to distract the killer for me while I genrush!
---
I too am looking forward to [Fallout 3](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Van_Buren)
---
Idk I’ve never seen Licensed things get a discount. But they may have before so I guess we’ll see.
---
It is probaply a bug
---
But if the entity knows people can hide in lockers because it has seen them being used, can’t they just create a character or background story that involves hiding underneath a bed? Like a lake creature who terrorizes a summer camp and the victims hid under the bunk beds. 
---
I just don’t see how the entity can provide chests of toolboxes, flashlights, etc. and not know you can hide underneath a bed.
---
Yeah I’m down for a swf, add me on steam (Sorry, still a noob)
---
These challenges promote farming I mean 2 safe unhooks during EGC ? Ok there meant to be challenging but this is based on luck
---
i knew we were gonna esc anyway she only had one hook that game
---
I played a game as survivor.
---
Never again.
---
I hate survivors more as teammates than as killer.
---
Alright, makes more sense now that you said why you think it's a mind game. I honestly thought you are one of those spirit mains that think she's okay the way she is (I'm simply sick of those), that's why I was slightly mean with the way I said stuff, sorry.
---
That was my point. You added to the original comment without notifying of an edit. You did this after I specifically said -
---
&gt; You literally ignored everything I wrote. 
---
making me sound dumb and incapable of reading. I truly am grateful I took a screenshot of your original comment. Nobody gets away with taking cheap shots like that.
---
For a second language you're doing great. I don't care if we're in an argument, I just wanted to point that out. But remember; because is spelled as 'because', not 'becouse'.
---
The Adam to the left was only was seen after he moved his camera. Either you or someone else in this thread mentioned Demogorgon is unable to move his camera after hitting a survivor with his shred. I don't know if that is true because I don't own demogorgon and barely watch any videos on him but if that were the case, he wouldn't of been able to turn around and see the Adam. Also, like I was saying before, the Adam was trying to hid behind the shed. He was watching over the demogorgon. Granted, he clearly did not know what he was doing. From that position he couldn't of possibly gotten the save without getting downed himself. 
---
You are kind of correct, the demogorgon has three separate animations. One is when he uses his actual ability to place down a portal, another is when he goes through that portal and the last animation is both used when hitting a survivor normally and shredding a survivor.
---
I was not the only guy on Reddit who saw this clip as it is. After all, the parent to this entire thread was someone agreeing with me.
---
a real fucking settings menu.
---
What sucks balls is that when you do the harder challenges that require chance or some nonsense you're literally rewarded the same shit you got for the "harder" bits of tomes 1 &amp; 2. iirc it only goes up to like 5 fragments and 50-60k bp for difficult ones. Not very gratifying at all.
---
Maybe because its supposed to be hard ? What a bunch of crybabies honestly
---
Meh doesn’t matter, still got a 4K and closed hatch right in someone’s face.
---
Concept is great, maybe there are some different better abilties, but I like the work
---
looks nice!
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
I agree great post. This is the only game I play so I’ll most likely complete the rift. As weird as it sound I play this game to relax my mind since this is my favorite form of entertainment ( I don’t want news, sports and I’m not addicted to any shows) But yeah guys these cosmetic are not worth the stress since most seem like reskins of similar outfits.
---
They're standalone. No maps. No music. None of that. Just a character &amp; whatever they come with so BHVR would probs lose more than they'd gain if I had to guess? Can't say I've ever seen LF go on sale, either. But you could always check G2A prices, if anything. Everything else but those &amp; the charity case go on sale. Considering Stranger Things is on sale and GF isnt (especially LF), it probably won't, not anytime soon atleast.
---
It really didn’t, holy shit
---
I have a very similar feeling like you.  I used to enjoy this game a lot but recently not as much.  However cuz of the battle pass, I keep playing to hopefully finish it before the rift ends. But reflecting on myself and this situation I can tell you 110% that this is my first and last battle pass purchase.  I supported the devs by buying all the DLCs ( except legion) ,  bought cosmetics for 6 Survivors and 7 killers,  overall gave them a decent amount of money.  Of course I got enjoyment in exchange and I'm not complaining,  I'm just saying that this is the last time I'll invest in such a thing called battle pass.  This game is fun but I'm not gonna sink so much time and money in it,  especially since the time I have is finite.
---
You’re only looking at the results and ignoring what it took to get there
---
I would probably say huntress and nurse, although I cant play nurse lol.
---
That one shouldn’t be that hard though. A lot of times the killer will be in a fixed animation where you can do it. Pallet breaks like you said, also vaults (not recommendable tbh), flashlight save attempts, right when the killer is hooking someone etc.
---
she’s the entity
---
There's hard and then there's downright impossible unless all the stars align correctly. If these were simply "hard" so many people wouldn't be upset because they'd atleast reasonably be achievable. Some of the challenge requirements don't even happen naturally every hundred games, you have to farm to have any hope of completing challenges like unhook 3 people during end game collapse safely and unless you have some form of communication with the killer its still difficult even then.
---
No not always it just gives u a higher chance of being the obessesion read the perk
---
The way you connected meg's(I think it's Meg) hand to the Jake's(I think it's Jake) hand made me laugh
---
I would just like to say having a single mind for the challenges I was able to do 20/40 pallet and gen brakes in one game and I spent many games fighting for the unhook and have over half to go.
---
These challenges aren't equal. Unless you CAN play with friends every survivor is fighting every other survivor for the chances. I'f we could at least see the perks the other survivors are bringing before the match it would help level the field.
---
I did this too with a david when i was fucking around with... Demogorgon was it? Either way, some of them got it, some didnt
---
A lot of his videos are at red rank too. By the way, you need to have some skill and be at the right time to use flashlights but the killers don't need extra skill or timing to use the add ons. They will be used all the time regardless of of what you do. And there is a life to the flashlights. Killer's add ons stay till the game is over. Not a fair comparison.
---
If there is no obessesion that means there are no obessesion perks being used such as Objective Of Obessesion, DS, Sole Survivor, Play with your food, save the best for last and more 
---
obessesion perks don't make u the obessesion 100% just like a map offering isn't 100% it is high but not guaranteed
---
No offense but I totally cringed to see billy here haha gg though
---
Two green add ons make a big difference. If you disagree, try paying without them.
---
Dude you’re so rude! You come here crying about how tough the challenges are and this guy took the time to write them all out so you can realize the challenges are not as hard as they seem. He was trying to be helpful and your response was childish and selfish. You’re probably the type of player that DC if they get caught first.
---
We have been waiting years for that, i personally want to see again Benedict Baker, but no luck so far
---
* Discussions primarily about games similar to Dead by Daylight (e.g. Deathgarden, Identity V, Friday the 13th: The Game, …) are considered offtopic and better suited for /r/coldwindfarm or their respective subreddits.
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
This was me with Blood Warden on Huntress yesterday for the bullshit NOED challenge. I'm just thankful I had to deal with the justified salt only once while doing it
---
Well u kinda need the obessesion dead bc remember me doesn't affect them
---
Last time I checked he hadn't made a video in a month
---
The first time? None of them. Bubba came easy to me though.
---
the ghostface with nurse's calling and sloppy butcher.
---
100 auric cells per tier while on the rift page. Doesn't get you the archive lore though
---
I had over 500k bp already so maybe I'll be awarded the bp later or something.  thanks for the confirmation 👍
---
Unless you want the lore unlocked
---
Actually no, I was left 4 dead lol. Pretty sure I was the random to their team of 3, because they’d do the dumbest of altruistic things to keep each other alive, but I got left on the hook while they opened up the doors (despite they only opened up one). One came to get me with like a sliver of time left and I was immediately tunneled off the hook. Couldn’t even get a body block or anything.
---
No love out here in DBD, I’m telling you.
---
It was my first time trying out hag yesterday and I didn’t expect to be good at all but I got a lot of 4Ks and DCs from salty survivors that were mad that I had 5 stacks on Devour Hope.
---
I was having a hell of a time with the "interrupt 6 survivors" and then realized I could use Spirit (I hardly ever play her) and got all but one grab so the last game I got all the survivors to farm and just grabbed one. yay teamwork! 
---
One of them commented afterward that the last day he become a farm-fest because everyone is trying to do the challenges and they are not easy so everyone is abusing the system currently.
---
Personally I was trying to get all my blight vials and finally did so I can just do challenges at my leisure now.
---
What's the point of challenges if you reward everyone equally without having to complete them...
---
Dude the same thing happened to me! I brought out the best add-ons so I can get at least 3 iridescent emblem. Game turned out great and I got 4 with the extra effort of slugging, kicking all gens etc. then I see only 1 and I get so pissed. Then round 2 and same shit happens!!!!
---
Not a single one bc I had no idea how to loop how to not get juked how to apply nap pressure how to switch targets.
---
In short not a single one.
---
I later learned nurse and spent way too much time on her got good got bored and started learning how to play killers again it wasn't. 
---
Now I just play trapper he is simple fun to learn and fun to win
---
I'm more okay with this than I am with the ridiculous grind of the over time challenges from level 3. Feels like the challenges might as well not be there and they'll pop eventually
---
Rub McCote's feet 0/2.
---
*well played
---
My first game I ever pre-ordered, and my last one.
---
I still play it sometimes, but damn, it was not worth the full price.
---
Sure there is. Just hack it to add his character model then enjoy about 2-3 games before you get banned.
---
As a trapper I dislike overly open maps and inside maps
---
DbD needs new matchmaking choices. I want one where survivors can only play their inherent perks, and the opposite, perk draft, where survivors and the killer quick fire their perks to counter each other.
---
It’s satisfying seeing people step in traps. Some killers come by surprisingly easy for me and some are hard like spirit or nurse.
---
Nah, these were datamined a long while ago.
---
Iron Bill
---
Don't bother. The survivors will just disconnect, making it impossible to complete the challenge.
---
I have a fair amount of friends to play with.  I’ve been playing since the Myers release, so I’ve met a good number of people over the years. Plus there’s always LFGs. Just sometimes I feel like playing solo, listening to music, or watching YouTube in between lobbies, and I don’t feel like talking much. Just relaxing and playing.
---
Yea I somehow got "stun the killer 2 times" while playing as killer so yeeeeeaaa
---
No offense taken haha, I totally understand
---
Its clearly broken.
---
Alert exists already
---
Very but it's in dbd fashion so I won't bitch about it lel
---
You must be the one usually on the receiving end
---
Totally agree with that, sometimes it’s better to just chill and multitask, but just having a crew that you know and trust should improve your gameplay. Even if you’re not communicating they’ll still be more likely to save u off a hook asap compared to being rando queued 
---
Been playing since the OG 3 killers but my computer is trash so I can’t play so much lol
---
Depending on your rank, but Freddy is a 4k generator for me at almost any rank -- without op add-ons.
---
Just as shitty as a hook right outside the shack with basement and taking more then 3 tries to get out of trapper's trap.
---
Such a Meg. ... but nice fanart. :)
---
Noed, deer stalker, Agitation and irongrasp
---
A lot of the survivor mains on this subreddit (Most of the subreddit) act over privileged. I still stand by my words.
---
Why should I go out of my way to give the survivors an advantage, when they messed up by doing something so stupid? I already have a disadvantage by being the killer at high ranks.
---
Comes down to personal preference, play them all and find what you enjoy playing the most.
---
Just finished the monsterous shrine with hag and agitation. Wow the team is so altruistic that they save in cycles each other with occasionally 2 hooks. I think I did 6 hooks in basement in the round lol. It’s fun so i let them all go
---
alert shows aura when killer performs a break action, which is borderline useless in a chase since you're not going to be looping the killer around the place where the pallet's broken.
---
prob spirit
---
Same.
---
I did the last one by pretending to be afk, some survivors ran around me, then when the 5 gens were done, i hit em and another one and hooked them and hunted the other 2 to the gages and so they died
---
probably spirit
---
In what way?
---
Its common decency to censor the names.
---
I swear BHVR doesn't understand how playing survivor works. I'm a killer main but I have played enough surv to understand how bs this is. I'm already done with all the killer challenges but these surv challenges just seem to take too much time. Like all Killer challenges can be done in one trial. Meanwhile the Survs need a lot of extra grinding and hoping for the best to get matched with a killer that isn't also trying to do a challenge of their own. The Tome 2 Surv challenges were giving me enough stress with the do 3 gens. Since I'd do most of the gen but killer eventually comes my way and I have to escape. What do I get when I'm running around? The gen I was working on gets done.
---
###KEEP WONDERING
---
Is this OC?
---
It's like 10 or 14 it's hella early to expect a lot of players to be on right now
---
I wonder which one doesn't count towards the challenge. It's good to know BHVR tested challenges prior to releasing them.
---
Nothing beats having everybody at Madness III while playing the Doctor.
---
Context, I had 1 before the game, it only counts 1 emblem per game
---
ikr, it's actually genuinely distressing when he's approaching and I love it so much
---
It only counts 1 sadly, had 1 from previous game
---
Sneaky peeky
---
I'm totally in. (killer main here)
---
I wish the killers could join the pre-game chat too. 
---
Sometimes nice killers and nice survivors can't help themselves with a daily, achievement or challenge just because they can't find the other side wants to be nice and help.
---
Windows + Shift + S next time pal
---
The problem is with the maps, it's not the perk. They're making the perk useless instead of fixing the maps where it was actually used. The only reason it was used was so the killer couldnt down you in like 6 seconds. Another nerf to help the powerhouse of the game. I wonder when will BHVR realise that survivors aren't the powerhouse anymore
---
That could be seen to be actively discouraging people from playing with their friends.
---
"I am aliiive!“
---
Queuing in EU is always slower than normal to me, so it’s probably just because there aren’t many players at this time.
---
He makes internet content.  
---
Imo life should be more important
---
Nah, It's usually spirit tbh
---
For someone who judges others as not bright, you're pretty dull.
---
Oh, even better /s
---
Dopamine I need trapper I main
---
Skillchecks are client side
---
Anything with ~20 minute episodes since that's my average queue time.
---
I just watch some anime fights or new ep if there is one
---
Interesting sfm, maybe add more to the back ground as now it's just a head and a hook. Plus if you add some stuff in the back, you can use the camera feature to add focus on the shot, making the background blurry, also I think I. This shot you could maybe used forced perceptive? It's hard to describe, just search it up. And final point, if you don't make a back ground and keep it to a head and hook, maybe make it a dual tone poster, where you make the object have two vibrant colours. may be useful for the poster. I used to do sfm too as a hobby, keep it up. You might get to do commission's some day :)
---
Malcom in the  middle
---
I'm uncertain if I'm right here, but  I read somewhere that the devs would implement if a survivor dc'ed, the body would remain in the game as like an actual survivor, so points could be earned off of them. 
---
I would honestly love to see that.
---
I can relate to him. I had to use Prayer Beads gen/totem grab Spirit to speed through the 6 grabs challenges and I feel bad every second of the match.
---
UUAaGh
---
The comments by biased Killer Mains hurt my brain
---
Literally the easiest way of doing that is just wait for a survivor to vault a pallet and grab them ofc if they are hurt any moment I could mind game a dropped pallet the grab was hella easy
---
This happened 3 times and he caught me on the 3rd try. I 100% deserved it.
---
I'm still in level 1 :)
---
It isn't that hard with bubba,I did it first try lmao
---
Their lore is genuinely kinda shit, no idea how they were picked up by the entity when the 4 of them killed a single guy.
---
I pretty much just log on to do a daily and then fuck off again.
---
People say you can have more as survivor, but a lot of matches end as a 4K by like a Trapper or Wraith in 5mins because of my potato teammates.
---
It's true, look at Friday the 13th. They couldn't balance for shit and the game kind of died even before legal troubles.
---
For me, I closed the hatch and pretended to let the last survivor open the exit and I just grabbed him off it and killed him
---
This is me all the way, didn't expect Survivor gameplay to be that 'easy' with a spice of Challenge and rewarding
---
Susie is looking hot as ever
---
AS AWFUL AS I AM I FORCED 20 GEN AND PALLET BREAKS IN ONE  GAME GEARED TOWARDS GENS ALONE AND MANAGED TO STILL GET OVER 30K BP AND 2 KILLS.
---
ALSO JUST GOT TO 9/25 SAFE UNHOOKS BECAUSE I HAVE TO COMPETE FOR THEM. THIS SHITS FUCKED.
---
&gt;of where we all were. Killer gets looped for a bit so I tried to destroy the totem, he ends up giving up the chase and coming for me but in the time it took him to try and catch me the ruin was gone.
---
Ok.
---
&gt;I wasn’t even the one who broke the totem.
---
Huh? I thought it was you.
---
Mate, i go doctor sith distressing, deerstlaking , noed and bloodwarden . Be afk until they finish all gens, they will play around you and then you kill them super ez with noed  ( distressing is for more bloodpoints ) it actually works and its fast ...
---
I had my first experience with one of those the other day, I got a tasty self unhook and made it about 3 steps before realising he was at the top of the stairs.
---
Buy the battle pass they said..it'll be fun they said..
---
Why are the prayer beads so powerful, exactly? Killer main so I never experienced its effects.
---
It is a legit strat but it is an ineffective one.
---
Okay, so say you get hooked or the killer is carrying you when the last gen is done.
---
 Instead of cancelling out adrenaline, it saves it. So when you get unhooked or saved. It procs automatically putting you at full health of which could be over a minute after it was supposed to proc
---
I don't have a problem with each of the challenges on their own, but yeah, having 3 challenges active at a time, or even just 2 would certainly reduce frustration, considering the total grind that you have to do per chapter.
---
Do you have some video proof anything to backup your claim that the hooked survivor is any bigger than normal?
---
or he's picking up a trap.
---
I'm a killer main, but I must agree, a lot of people behave like this. Like, fuck. How DARE survivors break the totem, especially when it spawned in a bad place. Smh my head.
---
_Pnumonia intensifies_
---
I hate the fact that you have to run iron will so the killer can't hear you from the other side of the map on some characters
---
This is probably my last replay becouse I'm going to work. You said yourself that you don't play demogorgon and that you have only watched a coupple of videos about him, so why are you so sure about his ability animation? He moved the camera after the 1 second camera lock was over (as soon as the scream is over).
---
Hitting a guy on the hook doesn't even play the "weapon clean" animation for any killer, yet he screamed, which is the succesfull ability hit animation, since the ability, differently from the standard attack, plays the animation anyway even when hotting a hooked guy.
---
I edited the comment by adding stuff way before you replayed, so I don't think it is a cheap shot. If you replayed first, I wouldn't have edited it, and the meaning of what I wrote is still the same, just more detailed.
---
I am reading all your comments, I'm not ignoring them at all. I don't adress everything you said becouse this things are long enough as they are without the need of me disetting everything you wrote. I'm just having fun writing stuff on reddit, I'm not writing a thesis.
---
OH NO LOOK OUT! THATS AN ENEMY STAND USER! I WILL USE MY [neutral special]
---
But why
---
Not to mention but oni can also down more than one player with a swing
---
The relaxing side is often more fun but at some point survivor gameplay becomes a bit too braindead
---
Now that you say it, it'd be really interesting to see the legion as sort of an ice climber style killer, however every action like vaulting and picking up survivors would alternate who was the "leader" aka the one the killers controls are attached to.
---
It does, I tested in a kyf when my friend and I were testing stuff
---
As a piggy man I can only say
---
And if its the hag they'll trap the shit out of it.
---
Gorgon will place a portal down
---
The others will literally just materialize if you go anywhere near it.
---
As in, I was the one now being chased and running while the guy who he was chasing immediately ran to destroy the totem. All 4 of us saw it we all knew where it was.
---
You confused “Hard challenges” with grindy as fuck challenges imo
---
OP got arrogant so he/she got what was coming to em. Though since they still have their arrogant believes, they satisfy themselves by posting it on Reddit so that they atleast can get some gratification out of it.
---
You sont have to do all at once so its not that hard with a Faster killer, agitation and iron grasp, i did it with trapper, it helped that i got the traps
---
Ah alright, saw your other post and it makes sense now
---
He is the best at camping outside of 99% Myers, Freddy, and maybe Billy
---
 You can't unhook to proc BT to save people, and you get instadowned
---
Shoots both
---
Why are people downvoting they just don’t get the joke?
---
What do you think about the nerfs will they change your view on spirit?
---
&gt;Plans to follow this with all the killers..
---
pls do it, I loved it so much
---
Scratched mirror myers is the most satisfying for me. Heaps of scares :)
---
Tbh about time, I don't think i heard anything about her ability to hear while phasing which I would of wanted over the ability for her to stealth mount but the collision was a big thing for me
---
This is how BHVR wants us survivors and killers to come in peace.
---
you're already using the nurse. Master it and this post would be reversed!

Wraith buff: Can now initiate the grab action from 10 meters away.

Man that high of a zombie level, shit I forgot how to do that lol.
---
OK boomer
---
Knowing bethesda we’ll only get rights to half the body so we’ll see a half body person floating around.
---
They actually do have the budget to create actual gore and graphic violence but the moment someone a limb goes off the game is banned in several different countries, so devs can't allow that
---
Monstrous Shrine is a horrible and a useless perk, there is no niche for it. Oh? Basement builds? You mean the ones made to get and corral survivors to basement. Well, monstrous shrine makes them die faster on hook, making it harder to get all them there
---
Better together and Prove Thyself is top tier for this challenge indeed.
---
May he be reborn as a fish feed next life lol
---
Wait, they're calling it black week?
---
I cant switch. My computer lags the moment skill checks pop up and no other time. I have to compensate by hitting it up to a second early.
---
Same lol. I am enjoying The killer riffs in 3 then. If I don’t get the flashlight....whatever lol
---
Well technically this is true because all killers play solo and playing as killer is a terrible experience even if you win.
---
Looks like Bill also has been struck by the invisible man.
---
I hope you're trolling man. Barely any of the high rank killers run it. The only ones that really benefit from it are killers that can get to a location in less than 8 secs like nurse Billy or freddy. And you can hard counterplay that perk. I'm a survivor main btw. I've never been like damn I hate that the m1 killer saw me for 4 seconds. Meanwhile swf used to constantly run the dark vision perk that let you and the killer see each other. Cuz seeing a survivor cross map isn't that strong cuz all you do is run to a loop
---
Accused of tunnelling because I chased everyone else instead of my obsession who kept trying to bait me out.
---
While running STBFL.
---
There is official video made by BHVR about Freddy's rework.
---
We miss noob3
---
Observationally better than that other DBD streamer with the 3 in his name.
---
Lol, I had a game exactly like that but I was playing Bubba.
---
&gt;So why did BHVR decide to inflate the difficulty and frustration by  making you have to specifically select which challenge you can complete  at any given time? 
---
They want us to spend more time in the game, so we are screwed. xD
---
Can I see it?
---
Oh God... Its the goon! The Rapscallion! He's here and he's ready to mess you up!
---
I ran a full nea build with Adrenaline most of the time. RIP 😢
---
Hmmmm
---
He can now lay traps, teleport to gens, pull up fake pallets.
---
No, i just called it that, my bad
---
No.
---
yep. i killed 3 of them, then found the last in a locker and put them in the hatch. whatever u do jsut dont close the hatch or it gives the last one a chance to power a gate
---
The fuck.
---
What is a machine gun build?
---
When you go to characters you can still buy them. So you dont have to worry about them changing the featured page.
---
People gloss over the addictive aspects of the game.
---
A lot of challenges are becoming a dice roll, instead of an actual change to gameplay. Which turns the grind into a wall you just smash your head at until it cracks (or you crack open your wallet.)
---
Thanks man
---
What’s the shared one in the middle?
---
Pills he-*coughs uncontrollably*
---
I'll give that build a go
---
Who is the moody fuck down voting our discussion?

I had 3 farming games yesterday. That's more than i get for a month or two

fun = basement camping and relying on the killer in order to get unhooks in the endgame? ok
---
Oni, getting your blood fury and scream across the map, knowing the survivors can hear you. And also bonking sound :3

Did somebody say basement Bubba?
---
When did he get wholesome?
---
At least wait 48 hours before reposting ffs
---
We shouldn't have to farm!
---
Because everyone is doing the same challenges and that completely throws the game. Every game I have as survivor there will be 1 guy on hook and 3 people racing to get the unhook first. Every loadout consist of healing and unhook perks as well.
---
40 pallet/gen only took a few games. 5 bear traps I did first try. Basement stuff just takes one hook and insidious. Not denying that some quests can be a pain but I havent hit any walls yet. Sorta fun having extra goals to chase tbh. I expect to complete level 3 tonight and I am a fairly casual player.
---
I can use Dead Hard
---
Myers with Deerstalker, which is pretty funny since now i find him almost unplayable
---
Morons who didnt understand how strong the perk was. It's been amazing since release, and after the exhaustion nerf it became the uncontested best exhaustion perk if we don't count adrenaline
---
I mean, he *did* say gg.
---
Lol its not about 5 shards but nice input m8
---
Put in Surge instead of BS. Mixed in with pop its just unbelievable. Regress 2 or 3 gens at once if you down in an optimal spot.
---
Yeah i'm sure you played since launch bro. bbq purely for BP, yikes.
---
if a single perk restricts map design so much, it is not fine
---
yeah a half decent team of soloq players isn't supposed to fall into a situation where they're all hooked in the basement because of face camping. no excuses here
---
Idk but some people really don't want to change their playstyle in the slightest,that's what I've seen in this thread
---
Thinks bbq is OP when it's not even the best tracking perk on most killers, yikes
---
Pop, ruin, bbq are the best. Thrilling tremors instead of bbq might be slightly better for super try hard. I usually use enduring instead of brutal but the 4th is whatever you prefer.
---
Also you refuse to explain how you think bbq is OP proving you don't have a real reason lmfao
---
I wasn't. I just wanted to know the reasoning behind his comment.
---
I shit you not, yesterday I cancled a chase because I very clearly could hear a bill cough and groan in pain and I went to look for him, it wasn't until after I couldn't find him that I realized there wasn't even a bill in the game :T
---
Don’t worry though, the recent stats prove that the game is too killer sided. /s
---
You probably played a really boring game. Most people do and most g's are not g.
---
"Escaped"
---
Fix those maps since most maps have terrible design. BHVR needs to do their job. Do you know why the entity blocker mechanic was introduced?
---
1-800-867-5309
---
??? BHVR "fixed" infinites by introducing shitty things like the entity blocker and now nerfing BL. They cant design maps for shit it seems.
---
How did that happen
---
More like: Clown after hitting a survivor
---
Sooo basically what you're saying is.... bbq is almost useless on me? Lmao :)
---
There was a single bit of him claiming that after testing he didn't see any shards, scott jund however on low settings found out that the shards glow in his debunking spirit myths video, int3ract made a comment guessing that it's probably because he plays on low settings. If that's true, console players have no access to shard glowing. Even if they did, the shards only apear to glow when you're very close to the spirit and why would she phase then and not hit you? So yeah, glowy shards exist but they're useless to help you know she's phasing in most sutuations.
---
Maybe this time it counted the other game for whatever reason
---
My big problem with playing Killer (other than queue times) is the fact that some of them are add-on dependent.
---
Especially since I don't have all of my characters to level 40 yet, so my choice is either play a Killer I don't like to take advantage of having add-ons/offerings, play a Killer I do like but not have the right add-ons or offerings anymore, or play Survivor and be inefficient with the grind.
---
You have fun with that
---
playing killer has always been a chore for me so thats why i never really do it . i even trash killer dailys because im not having fun while playing killer
---
TLDR was enough to earn my upvote
---
Yup, I had two people escape right from my grasp via the hatch and the last person DC’d and I still got it. Haha
---
Because having an opinion in 2019 is one of the worst crimes to be existing.
---
Also, is not like BHVR is unable to do this since players can already complete multiple dailies in the same match.
---
Escape as Dwight. Unhook 3 times as Dwight. Be chased as Dwight. 
---
Do all this in one trial and all 3 dailies are completed.
---
Wait that's not Ace
---
I run bond, kindred, and open handed, I’m really excited about the upcoming buff.
---
haha
---
epstein joke

haha 
---
society is fucked up
---
we are alle to blame 
---
we are all hypocrits 
---
especially me cause I killed epstein and no one knows 
---
I actually struggled to find a good thumbnail. There is tons of good artwork out there, but most are centered around specific characters, or have a very stylized appearance. Just search for DBD wallpapers online, and you're bound to find some great images.
---
One word, Cringe.
---
Not from my knowledge.
---
I don't want anyone to misjudge me. I enjoy his streams and love his personality. I wouldn't call him WHOLESOME, however. He can be quite toxic. I neither have any complaints nor issues with it, but I wouldn't call him wholesome.
---
He has an amazing community and loves his viewers. He's a great streamer and I really enjoy his content.
---
honestly i feel like these challenges are unrewarding for how difficult they are . also its going to cause farm lobbies like no tomorrow
---
So they get free BBQ?
---
I want more ultra rares like amandas letter that make a killer play differently, I'm tired of the add-ons that exist only to make a killer unbeatable.
---
Both of the above are correct. Both STBFL+Unrelenting and huntress add-on combo with tinkerer were referred go as “machine gun”
---
I’ve never noticed it here either tbh and I’ve ok been playing about two years
---
Hopfully
---
&gt;I played enough games to know that only cheaters get banned from in game reports, no one really gives a shit about griefers. Is there any way to record the griefing and tweet them somewhere?
---
Your footage is useless without the in-game report because it generates logs that BHVR can look at. Unlike most games, the "shitty in game option" is actually the most important part of the report process.
---
As to sending them extra evidence, you can do it here: https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests
---
She floats, it is easier to her do some parkour moves. xD
---
The video is literally me watching them run through the exit gate while I hang on hook.
---
You dont need to be there for the full repair. You just need to be there when it’s about to be finished. I did it solo
---
Equip prayer beads and ring on spirit. Enjoy free cross map grabs.
---
Fuck is that ring OP, it really makes prayer beads difficult to handle.
---
The police
---
Yea in their leaked faces only Susie is smiling but I think that’s more of a design choice to make her seem like a good girl who snapped, because I’m pretty sure that’s exactly what happened to her
---
This is the hottest nea skin I’ve ever seen btw
---
Ace got some sick juking skills.
---
I was doing the challenge where you had to hook 13 survivors. I’m a survivor main so these killer challenges are always a grind for me. Half way through, I switched to playing a survivor to ease the grind and when I’d finished playing that match, I’d completed the challenge. Weird.
---
Bc it's not against the dbd rules to play like a cunt bc the community can't decide on what is actually not good and what is bad. Unfun players don't deserve ban just like nobody deserves a ban for complaining about it
---
so nl valid reason? Alright.
---
For being time limited it's a bit nuts to 100%
---
are you complaining?
---
Right? I always see this constant battle between killer mains and survivor mains, when I play both and can see both sides of the argument
---
Instead of saying: You look nice today.
---
Say: AWOOGA
---
Edit your comment before you get downvoted. Don’t worry, we’ve all been there.
---
What they nerfed it?
---
There's lots of people that play both sides, but once you point out a weakness of one side you often get labeled as a 'that side main'. I'm always getting called a killer main for pointing out the ludicrous win conditions killers face but I'm usually a much higher rank as survivor.
---
Same exact thing with me like I said I’m in the purple ranks and I recently had a game where 2 of my teammates were rank 16 and the other was rank 10 but the killer was rank 4, how does that happen!?
---
Just check the stats instead of pulling numbers out of your ass : She went from 72.71% to 65.80% in the red ranks (and 56.47 to 51.20 in all ranks). 
---
As I said, around 5% down, which is not much. She would still be middle of the pack without the nerf, about the same killrate as trapper and bubba.
---
I mean if you're hooked half way across the map are you still expecting to be unhooked? Cause I'm not. If it's a hook fairly close to the exit gate yeah be a good teammate and try to come unhook me but if I'm on other side of the map I'm not expecting to be saved
---
I mentioned that :)
---
This happened to me for the Self care twice in one trial challenge. Not gonna complain lol
---
Fucking clown world.
---
I think it's the get 15 iridescent emblems but right now people say it's broken and only counts one per game
---
Yeah because killer gives more BP. Outside of that it's usually very quick (variety of rank outside of red on console). Especially later into the evening when all the SWFs are logging on. Meanwhile if there's a double BP event survivor wait times are fairly quick but most of the time, especially evening, it's slow as hell.
---
What if baby sitter gave you the user endurance and also made the unhooker survivor make no noise in addition to no scratches and blood?
---
and please dont get crazy about the pallet breaking, killer friends, it will happen eventually. no use messing up every games structure for days just bc youre desperate to complete that challenge :)
---
I wasn't going to comment on any of these but I have seen u/desdomen on here posting this exact comment over and over again and s/he keeps getting downvoted which I think is good. It's okay if you think these are okay or easy but clearly you are the minority here. Most of us don't have time to grind these out. Full time jobs, school, children, other entertainment that isn't dbd. I just want you to know that you are being a silly goose lol
---
I had one guy recently tell me that I’m pathetic for playing Myers, who is a cheap and OP killer. 
---
I thought he was joking at first, but he was serious.
---
Because I have other opportunities I like more. Prostitution doesn't appeal to me at all. Why would I work for a job I don't enjoy when I have other offers.
---
 Also, what the hell? You talk about immaturity but why the fuck do you think it's so simple and fast to sell your body? Prostitution is a very dangerous profession not only because quite a few governments have it outlawed, but because there are multiple cases of murder that happen to prostitutes. They are considered easy targets for serial killers for a reason, the only real bar they have is either in groups or a pimp. Both can end up you getting abused anyways, with no legal protections for the job.
---
 And yes, it's a video game. There are two teams in this one, a group of four survivors pitted against one killer. Both working against eachother as enemies, the only goal is to either
---
 A. Escaping the killer for the survivors which is doing gens/assisting each other against him/her through various ways
---
 B. Killing the survivors for the killer which is hunting them down, killing them as fast as possible.
---
 While yes, both teams enjoyment is equally valuable. That is what developers are for, to balance and fix the game to give both a fair and fun time. Each can and *will* use every tool the developer has offered them. One for the killer is to hunt the hooked, and if the killer wants to, they are allowed to.
---
 The fact that you not only fail to comprehend that, but think if people use the tools handed to them, suddenly they're either mains of them, immature, childish, selfish, or a piece of shit. Wellll, pot calling the kettle black, mate
---
The player admitted to assisting the killer post game chat and helped the killer multiple times throughout the match. If this was a subjective issue, I wouldn't report it but he was intentionally letting down the team.
---
If devour works it doesn't matter which killer you use.
---
Sadly devour rarely works, and even if it does it's mostly against teams that you could have beaten without it's help.
---
One of them is stupid hard like safe unhooks during end game, but we all know that unhooks during end game do happen. The hardest part about 2x Unhook during EGC is that you're not in control of when it happens, the second hardest part is that you're fighting both the killer and the other survivors to try and get them.
---
Past that one, there's 2 that are definitely harder than the others, but not really that difficult. The rest are fairly straightforward.
---
But that doesn't make the tome ridiculous, or impossible, or bullshit, or anything that everyone seems to be crying about. The challenges aren't hard, and they're not too time consuming as you claim, since a lot of them are passive enough to be part of normal game play.
---
Could they be better? Sure. Having all challenges be active and tracking would be better. But just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean BHVR deserve the sheer levels of hate and vitriol that's been spewing out of this subreddit the past 24 hours.
---
Also - If someone is throwing the game for the challenges, that's on them. If someone DCs after failing their challenge, that's on them, not the challenge. Don't blame the challenge for what amounts to be a bad player.
---
Some players want to belong to a group and feel superior to people outside that group. Ingroup/outgroup ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ *of course, it’s only those filthy survivor mains whomst make a hussle n bussle about this*
---
Oh I know it's doable. It's just so tedious.
---
thx
---
If you like to loop not a big deal
---
Pig. Them rare headpops hurt the points, but it just feels so goooood. Especially of the survivor was BMing.
---
It's funny that people would rather assume I'm whinging then someone be toxic in the game. Don't comment if you're going to disguise your argument as advice.
---
I never said to hard tunnel? I just said that the killer killed. Most survivors can't handle this fact that killers can out smart or our play them. And most killers cant handle the fact that some of their powers are broken or that some survivors are better than them.
---
Oopsie

---
It's like selecting wich achievement would you like to complete in a game barring your for organically "achieve" the achievements, is a dumb mechanic in order to inflate the time it will take for people to complete tomes
---
BUT THE SURVIVOR ONES... THEY REALLY ARE! ESPECIALLY IF YOURE A PROUD LONER SOLO SURVIVOR LIKE ME!
---
Dbd fornite dances confirmed x,d
---
Yeah but playing every game with a Mori is unrealistic and even if it was, I wouldn’t want to be that guy.
---
You’re probably right on the keys; I’m relatively new and haven’t used/had on used against me before. I still disagree with the moris. I’ve been on the receiving end and performed them, and while they can cause gameplay to be short, they also force survivors to make better decisions, which makes it more fun in my personal opinion. Again though, I am lacking in experience.
---
dick move yes bannable not really I think mainly bc DBD devs can't see what was on purpose or not and trusting the community to use reports in real matters is just off the table since they had to go out of their way and say "tunneling isnt bannable, dribbling isnt bannable *back before the DS changes*" and so on idk what they are gonna be able to tell with dedicated servers but for now there isnt fuck all u can do about it
---
The passive, not the sprint.  The passive was the primary reason to use the perk in the first place.
---
The clown is already in the game
---
EDIT: Nevermind, I think I got it.
---
I just think you're overreacting. It's not like someone hacked or hijacked the game. You're going to such lengths to try to report this person when everyone else in the lobby probably forgot about it already.
---
like an iron will for the duration of the perk? that’d be cool
---
i love playing claudette. her cosmetics are awesome and she’s just a cool character overall. i main her and feng min equally.
---
i prefer a stealthier playstyle so it just adds to the drama. when people see me running urban evasion, self care, iron will &amp; bond they probably think i’m crouching around the map. but in all honesty, i just like helping my team and avoiding chases with the killer.
---
Like flashlight clicking or blinding?
---
You should actually try playing killer sometime.
---
This. Just because I play stealthily (which is only sometimes tho 👀) doesn’t mean I’m being useless
---
I had that with the huntress humming once.
---
I ONLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE TWO UNHOOKS DURING EGC. THE REST IS ALRIGHT.
---
The dragon prince
---
it’s the best feeling in the world to down someone while they’re t-bagging and get there just in time before they crawl out.
---
Babysitter, bt, breakdown, and we'll make it for ez  unhooks
---
Kill = Mori
---
Sacrifice = Sacrifice
---
By any means necessary = either or
---
The altruism GOD
---
In the in game report menu helping the killer is under the report for trolling section. This isn't a controversial topic like tunneling.
---
exactly
---
Thanks.
---
I don't think there's any killer that will guarantee you a win every game. And I kinda think there shouldn't be as it's a multiplayer game not a single player rail shooter on Story Difficulty mode when NPC will do your job even if you do literally nothing.
---
Btw I'm fine with Bubba in high ranks. Surely he's not top tier, but I think he's fun.
---
And maybe deliverance for some good karma
---
Prioritize the closest cluster of 3 gens. Trapper works best mid to end game.
---
So today I learned all scientists are straw men. An educated guess based on past experience is not a straw man
---
Is he really thought loud? Does he make clanking noises too
---
It looks like someone frustrated because they can't finish their plate of food
---
Kill my any means doesn’t just mean mori it means jut let them die even a dc counts
---
You're still doing it. Why are you blaming the victim? And it's a straw that broke the camels back situation.
---
I don’t mind the humming but that shit is haunting
---
I honestly haven't noticed.  Which character are that loud?
---
Sundowave was never seen again after he vanished into a fog upon finding the rock
---
Leatherface. Getting a multi takedown is always a good feeling.
---
We need an MK chapter. Killer is Goro. Survivor is Lui Kang. We also get Sonya, Johnny, and Cassie Skins.
---
Here's the thing you'll learn with experience;
---
Being tunnelled f***ing SUCKS.
---
It's frustrating as there is little you can do to stop it. This is why Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike exist. If you're teammate doesn't have BT, you're only hope is a D-Strike.
---
Moris completely bypass that.
---
Plus, as you go up against more experienced Killers; you'll find that there is little you can do to avoid going down, on occasion. 
---
In either situation, a Mori simply removes yiu from the game on second down, with little counterplay. This often causes you to depip.
---
For the sake of the animations, I would still allow Rancor to maintain its Mori-like effect and *perhaps* keep Ivory Moris in the game. Ebony Moris, however, have no place here.
---
Because you are not basing your "educated guess" on any actual education. Nobody anywhere in the entire world has taken an entire month to complete a tome challenge, yet you're using that made-up statistic as proof. A scientist you clearly are not.
---
Ahh okay. Well that glitch sounds dam annoying
---
Sorry for reposting it was an accident
---
Damn ninjas!
---
Doctor is fun and since he is considered lower tier it’s oddly satisfying to stomp
---
You smack the nea on my time it's personal
---
FYI I despise autocorrect
---
Hag*
---
Yes but it's a terrible opinion
---
You should definitely report these. The same thing happened to me rn and I’m pissed.
---
Dont be an asshole you know what i mean, being a toxic tryhard aint "trying to play the game well" its BM'ing at every opportunity and disconnecting when the killer starts to gain momentum
---
This is also the same picture as the post right under it lol.

HOW? NO MF SERIOUSLY HOW THE FUCK? ITS BEEN 10 FUCKING GAMES AND IVE ONLY GOTTEN 4 SAFE UNHOOKS. I WONDER HOW MANY MORE STUPID GAMES TIL I MANAGE TO GET 25 UNHOOKS, just to unlock the challenges that have the fucking more. ITS STUPID, I REGRET BUYING THE RIFT PASS

---
Same boat. Never again.
---
You didn't reply to the answer
---
Had one game as Pizza Dwight where it was hillbilly on Lery's. No one in green ranks can hit ruin skill checks so we had two dead or DC'd by the time two gens were done. I looped the Billy for a solid 5 minutes or so and found Claudette juat kind of...walking around. Hiding. While I was being chased. So I waved at billy after dropping a pallet and let him saw me down. He wound up carrying me around until he found Claudette and killed her, then brought me to the hatch.
---
I just wanted to get hooked so I could die and move on, but the end result was hilarious. "Yes, Billy! Chase her! Kill her!" While shouldering me around.
---
THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS  
---
WHO THE FUCK THOUGHT THAT HAVING PEOPLE SIT IN THE QUEUE FOR FUCKING 20 FUCKING MINUTES AND THEN GET DISCONNECTED IS FUN  
---
I DONT GIVE A FUCK IF THE PLAYERS ARE BETTER THAN ME, I JUST WANT TO FUCKING PLAY WHY THE FUCK AM I RANK 16  
---
WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL RESET TO BE ABLE TO PLAY FUCKING CHRIST
---
Killers have fair and balanced add ons just like survivors have fair and balanced items
---
*DCs*
---
As already stated, you only have to be on the gen when it finishes, and tbh doing 3 gens in a trial is not some heroic feat, it just takes the right match with the right play.
---
Otz made a chart/video
---
https://youtu.be/P0aFo4lPARw
---
Give me a killer turkey ahah
---
Even if they let you pick two challenges, so you could have a passive luck challenge one selected just in case and one of your grinding challenges (like gain 200,000 bloodpoints) it would be so much better
---
I also think these challenges are great. They're tough, and it feels great to finish them up :) I haven't had any problems with them yet, at all.
---
The whole point of balanced was that it provided a useful effect even when exhausted but now its just a lithe thats harder to activate.
---
Nice legacy skin on that rock
---
Eh, they get to have fun while I just hang there, I can’t even do something else because I’m stuck here pressing a button. I could be watching a video on my phone or browsing some memes but nope I’m stuck here... that’s not worth it. They don’t even take notice of this and Half the time they hook dive themselves into a 4k
---

Why do you want ebony’s deleted? Just because it happened to you doesn’t mean it will happen again the next game. See how stupid your comment sounds?

Those are the type of survivors I hate

Thank you good sir

All his videos are this now, he’s such a hypocrite. He even deletes his VODS when he’s being a toxic fuck. He gets triggered then tries hiding the evidence. He’s done it for years. Like he even called another fog whisperer a hacker on nurse, calls community “fucking morons”.
---
Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine, Insidious. Here we go.
---
The fuck
---
I have a full time job, a 4 month old, a elderly parent that I’m taking care of, and it’s the holidays.
---
I get it. You may not be able to complete the challenges.
---
That’s a YOU thing. Not a “The challenges are impossible! BHVR SUCKS!” thing.
---
Similarly, some people suck at certain skills within the game. Some people can’t flashlight, some people never play killer, I can’t grab/interrupt to save my life. Took my 6 games to get 1 grab last tome.
---
That’s a player thing. Not a “The challenge is too hard!” thing. There’s a difference.
---
There’s also a significant difference between 
---
&gt; “I wish these challenges were a little easier, they seem pretty tuned considering the expected grind. 25 unhooks isn’t hard, but that’s probably 15 games or so since there’s 4 survivors fighting for unhooks and also the killer trying to stop them.”
---
And
---
&gt; “These challenges are bullshit! They’re fucking impossible! Fuck BHVR! Don’t they play their own game! This is just a fucking cash grab to force us to buy rift levels!”
---
I’m not being an asshole to the reasonable complainers. I responded to you perfectly fine because you brought up valid points and seem reasonable. I call out the tantrum throwing crybabies.
---
I’ll fully agree these aren’t perfect. A few of them are too highly tuned for the expected grind, a few of them are too easy to grief, and other issues. But they’re not impossible and they don’t deserve the sheer level of vitriol.
---
I mean balanced dead hard combo is pretty broken... it's basically a NO U for the killer out playing you in a chase and denying them hits they could have normally gotten... theres no counterplay to dead hard for distance or balsnced landing... soooo
---
I'm happy.
---
You sir, are a certified basic bitch.
---
Don’t insult meh pebble
---
Good achievements, nobody is being toxic with me for trying to hook them on basement, or running away to the other corner just to not let me reach there /s  
---
P.D: Yeah, as a newkiller i dont have agitation or the other one to just go straight to the basement, neither have so much killers leveled... its been a unfun tome (and i was looking to complete all this level 3 too ...)
---
Oh that's cool, didn't know that
---
Honestly not that hard m8 I'm playing at reds on PC so maybe its cause the game usually comes down to that and borrowed time exists.
---
We are done here. You don't know what you are talking about
---
I get you and understand I agree that they are supposed to be burned at stake for this..., but neither they should be praised...
---
Tome is great addition content vise but let's be honest it's also additional revenue stream for them..., some of the tasks are intentionally made to be grindy and not beign able to work on more then once at a time additionally adds to the grind..., also DBD for Behaviour is ONLY proper income stream if they have better one please correct me xD Ofc they will support and implement new stuff in game that brings them $
---
I used to think that too “Why aren’t there any Plague killers in high ranks?” Then at purple rank at this rank reset I managed to get 4 plague matches in a row. Was with one other person but we knew not to cleanse but the randoms didnt. So once they did it was Game especially since they in one of the matches they slugged. Had about a 50/50 sacrifices/escape rate lol.
---
FUCKING FLASHLIGHTS WHEN YOUR JUST TRYING TO HAVE FUN AND A GOOD GAME BUT NO THEY ALSO TBAG YOU AND SAY GGEZ AFTER THE GAME. 
---
ALSO AS PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT FUCK THE ADAPT KILLER ACHIEVEMENTS SOME ARE JUST IMPOSSIBLE.
---
Bruh killer isnt OP they UP but they can sure be a fucking piece of shit.
---
He didn’t find an excuse for losing so he made a new one
---
It took me a minute to get the teabags. Actually had to say it out loud for my stupid ass to realize what it meant
---
Right. The majority will prize players that do not play the game as intended, which is only making more entitled players that makes the community more toxic.
---
I will not do that.
---
You don't have to actually use the perk, just have it equipped.
---
Yea and I told you rng maps aren't completely useless.
---
Get it yet, you going to the extreme one way is the same as me going to the extreme the other way? You get maybe 1/4 of a map if you get bad rng lol not 5-6 maps are useless
---
And you were trying to feed me "most of the starter maps" which is 100% untrue
---
Typical neckbeards being assholes on the internet?
---
Imagine my shock
---
Honestly my biggest complaint is adept killer challenges. Gen rushing makes it practically impossible to do because even if you stop them from doing all the gens, you will still fail the challenge if they do 3.
---
Many killers don't have perks that slow down that aspect of the game and with the common use of toolboxes and the ease that players can nail skill checks you are practically screwed without: Ruin, Overcharge, Surveillance, or Discordance to buy you time. In fact many killer specific perks actually suck with Tinkerer being the only perk that Billy has that is actually decent.
---
As I see it, the ones working on my gens are the bad guys. Get out of my yard!
---
Can I please use this when somebody is being too salty post game?
---
Nice thanks.
---
Brother just take off fucking ruin and swap for corrupt, pop, or whatever and stop bitching about your crutch ass perk getting clensed so you dont have 3 years to make constant fuck ups anymore.
---
I get why they removed moonlight tho, it was really fucky with the lighting on indoor maps
---
I also had to set profile comment from "everyone" to "friends only" because i had 4 salty insults on it after my first week as killer.
---
In the end the very main issue of the entire Archive (with an exception of the "overkill" challenges) is that it forced two different dimensions together that simply can't co-exist in that manner.
---
And when I'm saying that, I'm not even attempting to throw in some sort of "high rank tome" or something as random as that.
---
I think it's very important that a good part of the challenges stays as simple as they currently are, just so newer players have a higher appeal on the challenges and don't experience them as too frustrating.
---
On the other side, the fun and motivation is important. So I came up with the following idea :
---
Instead of adjusting the tome's in a huge manner, make a "hardcore tome" that is available to everyone by default. These "hardcore tome"'s will be released at the beginning of every Rift, meaning that the HC tome will remain the same from the Lvl 1 tome until the very end (Lvl 4 tome).
---
This tome is actually no tome to begin with but just three rows of demanding challenges (one for Survs, one for Killers, one for both), that are tough to perform but definetly not impossible.
---
Obviously, since these challenges are very limited but also harder than the average ones of the normal tome's, they award thrice the amount of Bloodpoints and twice the amount of Rift Fragments in comparasion to a "normal" lvl 4 tome challenge.
---
This would not just reward the more experienced players, but give them actuall challenges while also supporting the entire concept of "rewarding the most loyal customers". Ofcourse they're not supposed to be designed in a manner that they're literally ONLY do-able by experts, but simply directed towards players that ain't as new to the game as others might be.
---
This gave me such a great laugh lol thank you xD
---
I laughed so hard at this. U p d o o t

This is what a bad killer sees when they lack the experience or presence of mind to remember these perks and things exist.
---
Same. Didn’t buy the pass, and couldn’t be arsed to grind for the lore when YouTube exists
---
Lol how is this lore?
---
The entity knows lockers can be hid in because she has seen them used. But we can't use other things because the entity can't see us using them?
---
Ofcourse they could add in variations of hiding... we already hide in and around lots of static features.
---
paint.Net
---
Its like paints older brother
---
It comes with layers wich is really good but has some quirks that require getting used to, like how everytime you finish a text it gets imediattly rendered into the image.
---
Its a bit frustrating at first but you learn how to work around it, otherwise its great (and less taxing on your computer)
---
I play friendly killer (hook them twice, let them go) but sometimes I forget if somebody’s gone into phase two, so I apologize for killing them not because the community has shamed me into it but because it goes against how I normally like to play. Maybe they’re the same
---
I get more annoyed with my fellow survivors than killers most of the time. Solo queue is awful
---
What is an incel?
---
The reason is because the people that are both are more indifferent than the killer/survivor mains. While they never shut up, we just kinda say nothing most of the time
---
*cough cough* Nurse *cough cough* Spirit * cough cough* Freddy. His bottles are just low budget dream snares, they don’t force slow vaulting, medium vault speed has been increased,blurred vision in not big of a threat , Clown suffers 1 sec slowdown after throwing bottles(ironic)
---
I disagree with removing customisation and uniqueness
---
Instead of just trying to make sure you get a kill I would go after the people in the area, but still staying close to possibly get even 2 kills or more from that. Just face camping could easily get out played by the survivors taking hits. Just like how this kill was trying to just get one kill out of hatred i’m assuming.
---
Bill hey wake up hey bill
---
"Not play the game as intended". lol. You're last. unless all the hooks are far away, wiggling is pointless.
---
if you see that as "not playing the game as intended" I don't think you giving anyone the hatch is "playing the game as intended"

I can't agree that intentionally throwing the game is a legit strat

So I only have about 80-100 hours in this game. And i think the challenges are a great way to mix up the game, and ive even changed some loadouts because I tried a perk or a strategy I never would've tried before. 
---
That being said, its annoying when a teammate isnt doing gens because they need to cleanse 8 totems or unhook me in a stupid situation because they need to unhook X survivors
---
Nice
---
Just smile and keep walking. XD
---
Stridor is bad. In terms of design, any perk that you run with the hope of countering another perk is bad.
---
I purposely leave my comments open because it's always hilariously pathetic that they try to fight someone who beat them in a video game
---
I dont consider maps with every pallet being ultra safe to be a killer sided map.
---
best tip i can give is do not shine at their face, shine on his upperbody and don't stand to close.
---
You'll have to unlock it on bill for it to level up
---
A trapper helped me with the blind a killer twice in a game, I love you trapper out there whoever you are. 
---
As someone who plays like 60% killer I HATE flashlights cause they A) are annoying to go against and B) never work when I use them no matter what rarity or add ons. 
---
Also I never use them against killer cause I know they ain't fun to go against.
---
Wait, wait, wait...The Stranger Things chapter on Steam is 20%, but the discount for them in-game is 30%. Is it cheaper to buy them using Auric Cells or is it cheaper to buy them through the Steam page?
---
I'm gonna feel ripped off if Auric Cells are cheaper after buying the whole chapter through Steam
---
More of a Marvel guy myself anyways

Because of the blood dummy

Dang im too poor for that all my points go on my baby dweet

*against potatoes
---
doesnt do much if all my traps are at best just denying one or two loops when they could trap someone and end the chase faster. I dislike it and it is not very fun

The game isnt that bad some of the strongest tiles in the game are there survivors just hate not knowing exactly where the killer is 24 fucking 7
---
 I understand the point that survivors are reskins, but they only really are like that once you get all their teachables imo.
---
They’re interesting concepts but feel they’d detract from the direction the game takes personally, like blinding killer for 3 seconds after a hit and stuff like that seems much more “superpower-ish” imo. I rly like these ideas tho!!
---
yeah same here wth
---
Hag is one of the most flexible killers out there in terms of build. My personal favorite is Corrupt Intervention, Infectious Fright, Monitor and Abuse, and Save the Best for Last
---
Right? I thought it was just me...
---
The issue Clown has is that while is power is extremely consistent due to almost having no counterplay at all, the said consistent value isn't that high to begin with.
---
Don't get me wrong, by saying no counterplay I don't intend to say he's OP, busted, a sleeper pick or whatsoever. But simply that aslong as the Clown doesn't get a cramp during mid-throw, the Survivor will never ever be able to receive at least slight penalty. Being slowed by 15 % makes juking just harder than it already is, leaving Survivors literally no choice but to camp the pallet and attempt to orient on the red stain in order to not get downed.
---
Clown is a extremely good chaser. But that's about it. He has some very slight anti stealth capabillities (the coughs) but in the end being a good chaser ain't enough to succeed as a Killer. Especially when literally every other Killer who's good at chases as well (Nurse and Spirit for example) have so much more to offer than just being good at chases.
---
Clown on the other hand has no tools to utillize his consistent chase capabillities in any way. He's no mobillity to snowball a slug fiesta, and thus also can't apply any pressure in general. SWF's violate Bubba and Clown extremely, simply because their where being can't be overseen while they also don't have the Terror Radius or mobillity to make up for that.
---
So, just like neicooo said, Clown desperately NEEDS map pressure.
---
How however...Is tough. His abillity just lacks a extreme chunk of utillity.
---
That.... and the fact they are just sweaty chavs who look like they go round neighbourhoods stealing hubcaps, and aren't that scary
---
Is that Feng Min
---
Does that mean the chapters are 50% or their auric cell prices?
---
You should have enough traps where those 3 gen areas are a minefield. I personally.dont even put traps anywhere else (besides maybe at the exit switches)

I meant mine xd

Funny how he is the one that has iron will as the teachable
---
No, it's just that doing that takes too much time and effort and it's easier to kill off the only perk that gives survivor a chance to loop around the killer. And dont forget its only an infinite if the survivor is incredible. If not bloodlust will make the killer get to him either way. So now, with the BL nerf there's only a few places to loop around in some maps. If you have a new player or a not so good player using all the pallets, congrats you dont have pretty much anywhere to run off to
---
The new lab map with balanced landing is actually horrible. It's somehow managed to be just as bad as the few remaining infinite windows.
---
THE SALES ARE ACTIVE NOW. REEEEEEEEEEEE

But boy did I not have any hopes up after we had gotten slugged and I knew that pulling this off vs Billy would be difficult. :D
---
the point is the map goes against the power bc the traps work best when hidden
---
Holy sheet the necro. Well, it’s really just a weird sort of etiquette that’s developed. Sometimes the killer gives the last survivor the hatch, and it’s more likely of the survivor doesn’t struggle.

What is that and how do i get 1
---
It's very commonly used at high rank. Not for its benefit, but for that sweet, sweet BP.
---
If anything needs to be changed related to BBQ, it's that survivors deserve an equally good BP perk. Killers getting double BP for basically free is a little silly. (I say this as a killer main.)
---
The seeing survivor benefit is helpful, but negligible.
---
I like the way you think
---
If you use sprint burst, you can have ghetto balanced landing
---
Team then betray
---
I managed 4 people in the basement at the same time about twice in hundreds of hours and it always was on shit ranks against new survivors. New rank reset changes will make this impossible
---
Who owns will?
---
When are you going to write me an apology for playing the way you did? Idk you or how you play but I don't like it, so fucking APOLOGIZE.
---
I was not disappointed
---
It’s still somewhat relevant
---
No it doesn’t anymore. Undetectable removes the ability for survivors to see your aura, but I suppose if the survivors also see your aura beforehand then I guess it doesn’t work. Also Dark Devotion still showed your red stain with no terror radius, but now it doesn’t so that’s good I guess
---
When I first got the game and has only Myers with like 3 perks at rank 19 ppl used to scream how I was pathetic playing such a busted OP killer. And I was a PoS for playing him. Obviously the power of salt did nothing but fuel me with the energy needed to terrorize even more ppl with Myers.

Pretty smart in a way

It’s gotten a lot worse lately. Before, I’d get into a lobby within a minute, while waiting for a killer lobby took an enternity. It’s the opposite now. So annoying

Commonly used doesnt equal op.

---
why the instaheals tho? They became trash
---
I’m late but I’m going to say a few things. First, you said this nerf would damage the meta rather than be good. Second, BL is really stupid but not for the use in haddonfield, that map is just good for BL because it can be used much more easily. The biggest issue from BL came from it giving survivors one of the most toxic advantages that still exist in the game: infinites. Coal tower, most of the other Macmillan maps. Stranger things map, and some house loops in preschool. BL gave survivors a new exploit that killers can’t do anything about and are just forced to abandon the chase because they could run you around it almost forever. Dead hard is being used so often because people either A; don’t want to be a toxic infinite user, or B: they don’t know how to run the infinites. Balanced landing will become probably on the same label as lithe because they are both situation limited but give you a chance to lose a killer. There aren’t as many options as you think and this is probably for the best in all honesty.
---
I guess in a way kindred is still good against face camping, as id you see someone stand still close to the hook and their aura disappears than they’re obviously face camping and if they move then they’ll show up again
---
Michael really did Jake dirty with that one
---
You posted this twice, just thought I'd let you know.
---
Plz, tell me this is true. I need a completely sincere answer. U r not trolling me right?
---
Maybe the Clown was running stridor?
---
I've faced her quite a bit as Survivor but never tried her personally and have yet to see one of those go off. I think next time I face her and she puts one on me I'll just let it pop cuz I'm really curious now.
---
Or you could just not be fucking trash and actually be good enough to complete them fucking duh
---
Wait why is the discount not on the ps store? Is it only in game? Please don't tell me it's only in game, I wanted the nightmare on elm street dlc
---
Well they were dead anyway and I’m not gonna give them a free escape
---
I believe its like Bills perk were on console, treated as just regular perks that appear in the bloodweb
---
If you have this post saved from years ago, I would assume you could defeat 1.5k hour swfs
---
The only change it should ever have is that it should only proc if you’re actually in a chase when it activates. Everyone else to tries to do gens instead of heal get no benefit but the person who’s actively holding the killer attention gets the benefit.
---
People should be complaining. Adept killer is obnoxious to get at higher ranks and is much harder to get compared to adept survivor achievements.
---
If I down the rescuer, mabye with a hit before she unhooks and a down after, then the unhooked goes into a locker. The alternative is I search the area and only find the unhooked, who jumps in a locker. Waiting a full minute is awful, I would rather eat her ds and take a 60 second chase where she uses pallets.

There's no disrespect, just a normal chase.
---
There are no bugs in this game, kind sir. Remove your comment or face defamation charges
---
yep theyre 250 each
---
While both is true, if you adjust the maps for BL loops, then you’re nerfing every survivor who doesn’t run the perk, making the perk needed further. I use BL a lot and its a staple in all of my builds, but I will say that the issue was balanced landing. Most if not all maps are designed without Balanced Landing’s passive in mind, so I do agree with the devs that removing the passive and buffing it in other areas is the way to go.
---
Then, they can maybe adjust survivor’s natural fall stun if they see needed? Chances are they would adjust the maps again with the BL nerf
---
Try restarting your game ;p more like slow people blaming game companies for themselves not doing basic stuff

I don’t play killer much and I’ve never played Legion, so I really don’t understand what just happened, LOL. How did he do that? Is it an add on? (I died after this and didn’t stay in the lobby so I don’t know what perks/add ons he used)

I am sure u r, but still have hope

I tried looking for it when it first popped up, but I couldn’t find it. Then i unhooked one of my teammates and we ran to a door but the gates were blocked. My heart just stopped.
---
 I think we did a pretty good job so far.
---
Thing is, you don’t get much in the way of points
---
That happens to me all the time when I’m actually playing “fairly” to the survivors but still get accused
---
I'v about 760 hours, I'v other games with their own battle pass systems. The challenges were doable and further push you forward in your battle pass.
---
The tomes have been confirmed to get harder each time which is cool and all, but they've funneled every survivor into doing the 1 challenge to begin with. 25 safe unhooks has resulted in everyone dive bombing hooks for the challenge, making it take even longer to complete. Once you've finally completed it you get, 3 rift tokens and some blood points, the same reward for cleansing 8 totems challenge and previous safe unhook challenge.

I got more tokens from just playing trying to do this challenge. Its fine to make challenges "harder" but they're progressively worth less as a reward. 
---
I'm dreading some challenges like unhook 2 people during the EGC considering killers run perks that slow the game down to avoid getting to that point, and survivors 99% gates. Challenges are beginning to feel like they encourage disregarding the objective and compete with your teammates
---
It’s at least a 4:1 ratio..... eh? Eh?! Ok I’ll see myself out.
---
As long as you credit my work, I'm a-ok with it. Prefer if you credit my twitch account however https://www.twitch.tv/ceptzlive
---
Tome IV will probably have 50 at this rate
---
Chapters come with exclusive cosmetics
---
tome 3 sealed my decision to not buy any cosmetics or rift pass ever again. I bought a lot of cosmetics in the past and liked to support the devs but these challenges combined with how they setup the rift completion and 'buy tiers' just makes them look greedy af... I don't like supporting greedy companies so I'll pass on everything they have to offer from now on.
---
Most matches aren't even fun anymore because every game there are just people grinding. Right now I don't even see a point in playing the game anymore even if I don't care about challenges/rift

Wait what how does that work?

I thought impossiburu was done and dusted as a meme jesus
---
Ive got a question about the statues on the new map, say for example one survivor is standing on one side of the statues and another survivor is on the other side - will the survivors see all the statues looking at them on their screen or will half of the statues look at one survivor while the other half of statues look at the other survivor?
---
Ño
---
Oh, I was talking about that first Master challenge at the beginning there. Thought that's what that one was.
---
It's not OP at all, I didn't even say it was. It's a beautiful BP fountain with a small perk attached.
---
WHY ARE YOU COMBINING MY TWO FAVOURITE SUBREDDITS. I DON'T LIKE THIS. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
---
Is the attitude really necessary? And you're wrong. It's still not up.
---
Hey theres a huntress, im happy
---
My initial argument was that it wasn't op
---
It was an amazing escape! But you could’ve put the exit gate at 19% so the red light wouldn’t show, but it has progress. Then you could’ve avoided that last encounter altogether
---
These fuckin videos are always gonna be my favorite thing on this sub. Smooth ass Myers
---
It's client side from my understanding so only you see look towards you
---
I have the same schedule. When I get home around 4, still slow as killer
---
What is the passive???
---
survive with friends. When 2 or more survivors can communicate with each other
---
This is basically how I have been doing them and I find it is working well for me :) Slight alterations to perk or play style perhaps, but otherwise these are just goals to work towards while still doing what I want to be doing, which is just playing the game and having fun with it! :D

Yea I know

Ace has Iron Will built in standard. Lol.

Pharmacy alone carries Quentin out of trash tier, I do like wake up tho
---
I never minded playing against a Mori. I take it as a challenge actually, and if I'm downed twice and killed, well, tough luck. There are a ton of things in games that are not "fun to go against", but those should be overcomed as a challenge, not condemned and shame the people who use them.
---
DS helps where you hide in a locker to force a DS or they wait for it to end and get a head on to the face. If you have dance with me there will be no scratch marks after head on
---
without challenges you need much more than just an hour per day.... Well you can pay your way through the tiers for 1 hour of work per day I guess....
---
Only good perk she has is head on and pairing it with quick and quiet is usually the go to
---
And fix camping. A simple solution to fix camping would be to have the bar decay slower if the killer is near the hook.
---
head on , quick and quiet, decisive strike for a meme build. Other than that her other perks are quiet useless
---
Not only does surge rarely apply on 2 gens, its usually 1, at most 2 if you got a really good spawn, it fucks over your pop potential because your usually guarding the gen that is close to completion and now you did 8% regression instead of popping it. This isn't even to mention that if two gens are close to eachother they usually aren't both being worked on unless its the beginning of the game.
---
Sure, you can tp and use pop somewhere else but it wastes it on a small % instead of the near completion one. And if you have two gens near completion already in a 3 gen situation you already lost.
---
Does he still stream on twitch
---
I'm just honest when some can't find the difference between a Totem made out of bones and a big Boulder with a skull and candle on it then yeah.
---
Oh lol I guess I didn't use it at all
---
You forgot the DC symbol :/
---
It wouldn’t be massively downvoted if ruin was actually getting nerfed
---
Not really? If you use it right after pallet slamming the killer and run away, it's basically like the old bottle still
---
Quick and Quiet Synchronizes well with Head-on.
---
Empathy with solidarity (I don’t recommend Solidarity)
---
As for Poised you could pair it up with Dance With Me to be extra elusive perhaps A Lithe, Dance with me+Poised combo will eliminate scratch trails when proced
---
I believe it's only full sets that are 30% off, individual pieces of cosmetics are still full price.
---
OP said it was her 4th time playing cut it off.
---
and its not like you didnt do stupid things in your first 10 hours of play lmao
---
You understand perfectly on what he needs
---
Only if they're in the way i believe, so you can leave up the branch challenges
---
You seem pretty cool. Don't come to Falador tomorrow
---
The giant's weakness is a sword that he willingly gave away from him, as a sign of trust, so that he may be killed.
---
Does that mean, ultimately, swf's kill themselves?
---
I mean the trappers first mistake was camping the locker, obviously scared hed escape the trap... easily giving the remaining survivors alot of time. The survivors mistake was doing DS dive on trapper anyway.
---
I have this in my games alot and it's funny as fuck especially when they have inner strength and they heal only to be instantly trapped upon leaving.
---
Hmm, Laurie, one of the survivors I planned on buying, is still showing as 500 Auric Cells, Myers is 250 though..
---
Killer brings thrill of the hunt to counter totem cleansing + camps a dull totem all game

Depends on country and currency. 5 € for 500 AC if my calculations are correct.

Ok thanks. I’ll do the rest first...but it’s in the middle hahaha
---
0800 001066
---
You have to press M1, not hold, a lunge won’t trigger the grab
---
It is a little bit, but it’s really not so much that you can blame every miss on it. It’s just a little less smooth. General console lag makes it harder than the fps being lower IMO
---
I do this sometimes. Hilarious.
---
laurie is too classy a lady for that sheeat
---
Yeah nerf noed while you're at buff hag to 120%ms and let her teleport to any trap place without removing the trap so I can pressure gens.
---
No? Then we leave noed where it is.
---
Usually killers will bodyblock a dull totem while they wait for the gens to be done so that they guarantee NOED stays up for at least a little bit. There's a rank ~4 guy in my area who does this all the time as Clown, even before Archives came out. That's why if there's an AFK killer you leave immediately. Don't wait around long enough to find out they are actually doing Endgame stuff.
---
The more I play on the game the more im starting to like it on survivor, pretty much every pallet is ultra safe and guaranteed to spawn there.
---
nothing is ever unsportsmanlike. THIS IS SURVIVAL
---
This ^
---
What flavor
---
Dude you are obviously not using it. And where are you getting it rarely applies to 2 gens? I literally just exited a game where I'm popping 2+ all over the place and then you follow with theorizing survivor behavior to justify why you think its bad... 
---
But I'm not wrong. Try it. It is a ferociously strong build. I'll take a total of 41%+ gen regression over breaking a pallet 20% faster any day.
---
Nah it’s better than DCing. If they really cared they would’ve gotten you sooner. I do the same thing so I can get in a match where the other survivors aren’t potato’s
---
Buy a copy of DBD on every platform during a single trial
---
I don't mind if they're all on gens and if they pull me before second. I'm also ok with going second if they're committing to power the gates since I'll have Adren. But if you let me go second on my first hook with 3, 4, 5 gens left...yeah, I'm letting go.
---
I appreciate the recognition
---
She gets one cosmetic and it goes straight to her head smh why laurie why
---
Can't unsee it
---
happy holidays!
---
My main problem is not knowing I’m exposed you had the perfect solution
---
certain challenges are taking like 4-6 games to complete
---
No, I do the same... unless someone was running at me and just didn't get to me in time. But if they're all just sitting there, then...
---
I don’t understand why this was posted
---
your not wrong that surge is way better then brutal strength, im not argueing that part. I'm saying that rather then surge i'd use thrilling, surveillance, hell corrupt intervention might even be worth it.
---
Try Surge. I did it on a whim trying out a build and never looked back.
---
Same for me but I also absolutely suck at aiming them
---
Yep when you say so.
---
So can i get the list of discounts or do i have to look at it in game?
---
thanks!!!
---
\+1
---
You owe "White squares dude" a key...
---
Remove his slowdown while he throws a bottle, there's no reason he should be slowed for a sec while it leaves his hand.
---
Also hitting a survivor directly should have bonus effects like longer blindness or maybe even injure them that way there's a reason to be accurate.
---
Yes, you can get Nancy on her own for 350 AC (regularly 500).
---
I like this one
---
sorry i understand that i mean how does it work?  like people are talking about tier 3 and idk what that is :\\
---
Neckbeards/Legbeards
---
My plan is to bring a key, give it to someone in front of the hatch and the killer near, let the killer close hatch, and use BT and bond for the EZ complete.
---
I got lucky and had a farming killer who only hooked us after EGC was activated. I believe we helped him with the 40 kicks on gens or pallets because we all stood around a gen and tapped it after letting him kick it.
---
Better still is that I really want it to activate on EGC so Blood warden would pop off super hard
---
i’m assuming you have laurie’s teachables so you should definitely go for head on &amp; decisive strike.
---
good perks to put on this build would be:
---
- unbreakable (if they slug for decisive)
---
- dance with me (no scratch marks after stun)
---
- object of obsession (go in locker &amp; annoy killer)
---
- inner strength (quick heal while charging head on)
---
Yes, I took it from its corpse and escaped through the hatch
---
farm, get them to trust you, grab them off the gen, drop them and repeat
---
I most likely just imagined it or maybe one of the other male survivors was nearby for a second. Idk. I was just very confused in the end lmao

Yeah Ik but it would’ve been nice to get 2 characters for the price of one, I’m kind of over it too because when I max out my rift I’ll have enough aurochs for the new survivor so I’ll be fine
---
Check out [this Otzdarva video](https://youtu.be/IDxP5RwuFEs). Skip to about 11m if you just want the money shot.

TL;DW: Otz gives the last survivor the hatch, gets hit with this immortal line. Amazing.

Thanks :D

Yes NOED is a crutch and is designed to be ran by new players or simply bad/casual players who don't possess the skillset or game knowledge to get their downs without it.
---
That being said babyraging about it this hard isn't a good look man.  Comes off as really immature and kind of annoying.  If the crutch bothers you this much just run Small Game which is a free perk you can get on anybody.  Even soloqueue that perk makes countering NOED easy and bonus you will constantly find their Ruins immediately.  
---
Instead of raging on reddit just punish the baby dudes with some Small Game action.  It works.
---
Jane's a fucking screamer, I swear. I was in a match where she got hit by a demogorgon and I couldn't tell who was louder because they were both looping close to me while I was popping a totem (it ended up being haunted Grounds, unfortunately. You all can guess what happens next).
---
U seem fun to party with. Chili party

Yeah that's cool, let's make these ridiculous challenges harder for people trying to complete them. Good idea.

Do trapper and claud have voices in their cutscenes? I don't want them spoiled though I just wanna know if they do

depending which hand u eat/drink with gotta hold the front of ur controller like this 🤘with your pinky on R1 and ur index on L1 or vice versa woth the other hand.
---
Great job!
---
Grinding for bp may be the best thing to do depending on what you have for killers. I've played since around January this year, I think the game was free as a PS Plus deal, and so far I only have shape p3-50. I think that playing to win can be fun but it's difficult when you don't have the optimal killers or perks to do well. At least with the new system of the tome you can have other things to do that aren't just hooking people.

It was the magic of Lerys memorial institute where some survivors got downed because they couldnt find the exit gates. Everyone got out safely though

Wow.....what a weird unrelated tangent you crafted there.  I had to reboot the ol' brain attempting to connect the dots on that one.
---
you should be! i don't know how tf i'm gonna do that one
---
Nah save those cells for the next battle pass!
---
You’re the wise one
---
Either a person plays both sides or you're gonna be biased towards one or the other. I placed red ranks in both, tend to be in purple most times, but never have I really been that upset at a Mori. Unless he hooks survivors twice before using it and chases, hits, kicks gens, breaks pallets, he's gonna get shit for points and more likely then not depip. This is generally what goes thru my mind when half my team is dead to an ebony mori, even if it's me. It eventually evens out. And if it is upsetting, switch games.
---
Skip over it. Go the top route and worm your way back.
---
I'd main him for sure if he got this cosmetic
---
Ham’s good as fuck
---
I tried repeatedly pointing at it with a Trapper. He downed me and hooked me in the basement. 😨
---
WAAA
---
Thinking the same thing with the new cod game as they are doing theirs challenges the same way. I think they do it so it takes longer for the event to be finished. That way there’s no possibility of finishing two challenges at the same time

How is gf better than freedy? He is easily the best killer behind spirit, I'd even consider him better

Myers brand sterilization. Lol

🤷‍♂️🙇‍♂️
---
The sales are in-game only.
---
Recently had a Leatherface that was afk for around half the game. Iirc, there were like 2 gens left and he finally came back and hooked someone; LF then camped that person to death and managed to down someone who had the bright idea of trying to unhook someone being camped by a LF. I worked gens and just left. If you know the killer is camping, your best bet is to just leave them.
---
Can you draw Kate for me? 10/10 drawing skills btw. Great job.
---
This is spot on.  Instant survivor lobbies all day and 15 minute killer queues.  Post 6 or 7 pm it's almost opposite.
---
You’re so damn right. I got 600k bp in the game from trying to do the 25 unhooks. Yet the archive is only like 59k bp. I don’t even feel rewarded.
---
Do you not read my comment fully before replying? Yes it is a strat but it's ineffective. I'll repeat the key word. **Ineffective.** 
---
Just because a strat is ineffective, it doesn't automatially mean it isn't a strat. 
---
Think of it like this. You are playing as suvivor and try the stragety of using a stealth build. The killer notices you and blah blah blah, he/she kills you. Your stragety of using stealth didn't work. Does that mean that since that stealth didn't work, it's suddenly not a stragety anymore?
---
Nope
---
I collect the salt comments on my profile. People have stopped leaving lately though and it makes me sad
---
One challenge. That is one challenge that **everyone** is saying proves all the challenges are hard.
---
That one, singular, individual challenge.
---
There is 1 hard challenge, 2 medium difficulty challenges, the other 16 are easy.
---
Unless you serious think 1 out of 16 equals “all are difficult” then the challenges are easy.
---
it looked like a glitch. as the first time it ended, it suddenly flashed back on fullforce, that's not how it's supposed to go.
---
Basically, that's what I've heard. I heard one time you can call and get a one-time refund, but I've never tried that myself.

---
Thank you Amanda here a boop.
---
I got downvoted for encouraging to learn nurse. I guess negativity is the real meta huh
---
Well I mean if you want to play stealthily you’re not gonna wear a silver prom dress that looks like a target to a huntress on the other side of the map
---
Was actually thinking about which survivor to try drawing, so I'll give her a go!
---
So I've been a Survivor main for a while, occasionally just totally shitpost whiny killer things.  Well I've been doing killer only nights and let me tell you -- It's so eye opening.   Not only how shitty people are on the other side, but of how silly people can be.  I just have to laugh when survivors literally run right into you.

Having an opinion and smugly acting like your opinion is fact are two different things

This looks great, Thank you for showing us! :D

The top comment in this chain is calling this an straight-up cash grab where BHVR is purposely creating a problem so people spend money.
---
Your anecdote isn’t really believable when this chain originated from one of those such comments.
---
And when I’m only really commenting towards people making unreasonable crying posts, I’m not really in the wrong for calling them out.
---
Oh shit I'm pumped!
---
Survivors cannot make the main building EVERY single chase.  There are plenty of spots you can catch them on that map near gens where they will have no chance of making the building.  Don't over exaggerate the situation.
---
I play a ton and I was still surprised with some of these challenges. 2 safe unhooks while EGC is active? Like cmon lol
---
Edit: Good luck on the Tome my friend

I agree. Buy the actual DLCs containing the characters.

Or Jane. Gotta draw that thickness. Lol

But the last one wasn't.

Dudes over exaggerating, Fungoose is still pretty cool and clean.

I get it, yeah. If they didn’t know you had iri hatchets somehow they probably were trying to give you a couple extra points. But this game’s community is a toxic wasteland so I doubt it

You just followed the "Playing M1 Killers during the EGC 101" handbook man. Gotta do what you gotta do. Much respect for a fellow Myers Main in 2019.

And yeah, god forbid a company try to make a profit. How dare they! :-P

sorry I’m new to the game and the sub, I just made this while in class this morning
---
? I don't really play Killer because I've yet to enjoy it much. Not concerned about ranks
---
I would get Ghostface. Grabbing people off gens is really fun.
---
You could also throw Fortnite in there, but the beauty of Fortnite is that they have a mode called “Team Rumble”. I’ve been a fan of their large team modes ever since they started to be released more consistently, and the latest version that has been in the game for like a year is pretty much now part of the core modes. The sweat is initially taken away as you are on a team with 19 other people VS a 20 player team. You have 5 minutes to pick a spot on the map on your team’s side and loot rather than be stressful about anyone landing anywhere. When you die, you respawn instead of the traditional 1 life.
---
It’s pretty much become the mode for doing challenges in. If they didn’t have it, I would have quit Fortnite ages ago. What also makes it great is that you can do multiple challenges in one go. If they did that with the archives and rift here, it would make everything a bit easier.
---
I barely use both but I’m thinking you’ll get more fun with Ghost Face
---
Do you play PC or console?
---
She's got that stink finger for the children. Basement timeouts imminent.
---
PC
---
Pretty good job?
---
A Dead By Daylight meme in the SCP Foundation Amino?
---
ScP-173 cOnFiRmEd As KiLlEr????????
---
then id say ghostface. hes a stealthy killer, unlike the demo. so it depends if you like stealth or not.
---
He wants something that's not gonna happen. I want something that's not gonna happen.
---
How is this a drawing?
---
Is demogorgon more aggresive?
---
cursed image
---
If it’s really too much of a struggle message the survivors before the game starts and ask if they can help you if you let them escape it works most of the time
---
yes
---
The only busted killer is New spirit and old Nurse
---
Not a peep about Nurse or Spirit changes?  
---
Are you....are you being for real right now?
---
I've seen countless posts on this very sub complaining hard about those nerfs with many saying they were completely unnecessary and were the result of "whiny survivors"... 
---
Theres been PLENTY of salt over both those changes killers absolutely did not take those changes in stride, not on this sub.
---
Aight thanks.
---
*with friends*
---
Dont sound like fweeinds to meh
---
But you don't get exclusive cosmetics if you're buying not a DLC but a character using shards.
---
Not that those exclusive skins are anything really good in particular, but I kinda like ripped sweaters for Steve and Nancy
---
I don't play killer very often. I was using the perks I had. What are some good perks for her? I bought Iron maiden and I'm trying to get Bloodhound now
---
We're currently in tome 1, that ends in 41 days. You can still get Rift progress from previous chapters in the same tome you're currently in.

As intended.

I feel this would make the game more like Friday the 13th

Is that really your concern here? Just get out.
---
Lmfao
---
Not to mention the new Tome of the Archives, sheesh. Why even bother playing
---
Yes but I would like this to be far more difficult than it is this game. Like even after you have found this item you still have to try and trigger the killer which will be hard enough for some killers considering the nurse and the hag can teleport, Billy and bubba are superb in close range, and the huntress can get a hit in from across the map. The only killers I could see this being easy with are killers like clown, trapper, or wraith
---
Yea its this
---
I mean I wouldn't do it immediately but once I see the time on my hook meter is less than the distance they're able to run (i.e. once it's physically impossible), I let go
---
Purple and red ranks get matched up all the time.  This isn't broken matchmaking worthy.  Just work on improving and learning from your mistakes when you get matched up with better players.  There's something to learn every game you play.

There was a guy a while back who made a bunch of JoJo perk icons, I actually use them and I'm quite happy that We're Gonna Farm Forever was in the Shrine this week so I get to use the Koichi perk.

Literally me. Made it to rank 3 in only a week of solo que. It’s very relaxing doing gens and satisfying as fuck to loop killers. I also learned to hate spirit really fast. I now understand why people hate her so much.
---
I would want this to be far more difficult than in f13 tho
---
No way! Hype!!!!
---
YOU CAN SWITCH PERK ICONS?!
---
Lol, but yeah it was on an scp amino
---
the add ons there's a common one so you should have them
---
Ah, just found it. Is it the garden rake?
---
0/3. Must be completed in a single trial.
---
Yep
---
Ghostface for both fun and tryharding, in case you get bored
---
Ty!
---
Look up a video you can download it now
---
I mean, I use moris for fun sometimes but alright
---
Can you link them? If love to use it
---
Just bought 2 killers yesterday, not realizing its balck friday tomorrow....
---
I would be great as a solo player but it would make it even harder to play against swf
---
Unfortunately don’t know any friends who have the game :(. Thanks for the response
---
Looks fantastic!
---
Yea I did agree for an exchange bc they’re both dumb. Much like your argument.
---
Mom: Time for your bath honey
---
Survivor: Hold on mommy, I'm in the middle of a match!
---
Mom: Just pause it.
---
You're using exploits to reach parts of the map the killer can't reach, effectively holding the game hostage, and teabagging to boot.
---
You're not just the clown, you're the entire fucking circus.
---
Ace is included in the "special" edition(only one on console)
---
I didn’t fully look at the level 3 challenges (because I saw how they were progressing to a grindy mess) and while playing today couldn’t understand why survivors were farming unhooks, not doing gens and why killers were tunneling and basement camping (also at red ranks) but it all makes sense now. The challenges translate to:
---
For survivors: do absolutely anything but gens
---
For killers: camp and tunnel the living shot out of survivors
---
Thanks a lot!
---
The killer got up on the rock in the clip, so idk what you’re talking about you 🤡
---
You are not praising but you are defending them with vigor like you have shares in company ;) ;) 
---
They are supposed to make profit but they should file down the grind a bit and enable us to complete more then one task at the same time...
---
Imagine a fisting session with her
---
I came to the comments to see "ok boomer" once last time.  Im disappointed.
---
So is laurie why is she not on discount
---
Right, as survivor I see a Mori maybe once ever 10-15 games. Keys I see probably 1 in 4 and they completely change how the killer has to play the game if they want to win. Also can't find a mori in a chest.
---
Hey, at least you didnt get messaged:
---
"Tunneling peice of shit I hope you kill yourself"
---
Yes, but, I think they should also make killers stronger
---
They said some time ago in one of the Dev streams that the chainsaw addons are on there list of things to review. Both Billy &amp; Leather Face's
---
Please someone explain this
---
Spongebob narrator voice: “*3 months later*”
---
Why is Laurie not on discount
---
The argument about the chest is absolutely brilliant! I agree!
---
When you join in a lobby and notice all of your teammates are blendettes
---
Yes, they are just texture files, easily replaced, most streamers of DbD use different perk icons and such.

Cool, thank you. I will try this today.

Did a similar thing for the free grab. Just that I kept bouncing him about until he got back up and let him open the gate afterwards.
---
It's a very solid way to get an assured grab.
---
Jane: *gets hit*
---
also Jane: *air siren sounds*
---
Use adrenaline so you can at least run in a pallet or safe spot..killer can't really counter that unless you are on his face
---
Or just break the totems whenever you see them
---
Jesus Christ, that’s so specific!
---
the stranger things dlc isn’t going on sale. it’s dlc released before the stranger things chapter.
---
Sam and Old Mr Kreeg from Trick 'r' Trick would be fun to have to
---
I always feel bad for bringing a mori and always apologise for it. Regardless. I play both sides so I know what it's like to have my game cut short by one. I always act how I'd like to be treated by a killer.

Jason can teleport, go into an invisible rush, sense where people are, and mute his terror radius. You need to sneak in his house, grab the sweater, knock his mask off, call Tommy, use the sweater, hit Jason while he is stunned, and have Tommy hit him with an axe or a machete. In no way is your idea the least bit harder than in F13.
---
Yeah I feel like whenever I'm trying to do unhook challenges I get the deliverance curse

Didn't it say everything before the Stranger things DLC is on discount

A killer can’t find an op add-on or a mori in a chest

Yes Laurie is way before stranger things. Michael Myers is on sale.

Can’t find a mori in a chest

I'll tell mom you're browsing Reddit instead of doing homework

Not attacking you, but its a little unsportsmanlike and bad strategy to stop struggling. Just because your teammates are all on gens and not coming immediately, doesnt mean they intend to let you die. Its often the best strategy to let you hang, and pop a few gens while the killer is patrolling your area. The game is all about time management, saving you with 5 seconds left keeps you just as alive as saving you with 1 minute left. My friends and I use this strategy a lot, and often times a save is easiest at the end of the struggle because the killer has already written you off and left the area. So yeah, dont assume teammates are letting you die when theres still time, because good players will use your struggle time to get the gens and still save you last second anyway.
---
Not its not. But thats not the point. The point is giving the hatch to the survivor who tries to the end is better than giving it to the survivor who gives up. If you're giving it to anyone give it to the one who deserves it.

I’m still trying to figure out what exactly these survivors did to him. And he has so many videos like this
---
):
---
Why do killers make that tires screeching sound?
---
Ehh, gimme dem bbq stacks then
---
That’s not why he got downvoted and flamed. Having and expressing an opinion is fine, expressing it in such a rude way is not.
---
Thank you, this helps a lot
---
Basically, even when you were exhausted, your stagger reduction still applied at 75%. It is gone now, which is sad :(
---
Honestly they are made out of clay.But we can imagine they are cherry flavored for survivors.
---
hE iS gEtTiNg sNiPeD eVeRy gAmE
---
Nightmare is amazing when used correctly, and DS is a good perk to waste the killer’s time, either by forcing them to wait it out or go on another chase. Dead hard is only good when you don’t waste it, but it’s a monster using it right. Also, this may just be console but I thought the david + huntress dlc was free?
---
By instead creating a whole other tipe of misinterpretation.
---
What would be the sixth one, assuming the 3rd one was the schlong, the other two ones being his hands?  
---
His head? Do I have to pat Cote on the head for some BP?   
---
Not saying *I wouldn't* but ok.
---
There are 3 add-one that give you dream pallets, btw. 2 of them show auras
---
So it's only PTB?
---
Also having absolutely zero personal hygiene? 
---
Double shock.
---
Yeah he ment next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next Saturday
---
Ah yes agreed good non todd sir, what a flawless game with no flaws whatsoever
---
He is such a crybaby I swear
---
Why learn how to play optimally, when you can just complain. /s
---
Lmao toke me like 10 mins to type all that out
---
Blood Warden takes so many people off-guard, especially low ranks. I've had one person think the exit gate was bugged.
---
sometimes you just gotta *REEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
---
For the 4.19 price, is that on the steam store only, or on all stores
---
you don’t find a key out of a chest every match
---
Thanks and back to you
---
I’m saying he doesn’t have six feet goddamnit lol
---
I hate that these are basically making us play claudette and the trapper. I hate playing both of them
---
I believe you forgot a 0 there.
---
Can’t complain if your going to be toxic to the killer
---
I saw that one said fuck this and switched to killer
---
How long do these prices last?
---
One week
---
Thanks fog pal 🌫
---
Cool thanks for quick ass reply!
---
why frank gotta be so DUMMY THICC?
---
That's the way she goes boys
---
It would actually be great for camping at that point, since campers don't use much besides NOED anyways
---
What other killers do you enjoy playing?
---
Lol. 🤦‍♂️
---
Freddy is very powerful and fun to play as, he went from F tier to my favourite killer when the remade him.
---
I'd say the nightmare, because he's way better now
---
There being so many fellow JoJo fans in the DBD community makes me really happy.
---
Calls something cringe and then immediately follows it up with the phrase "dare I say" lol.
---
Laurie sounds the worst though. Its like shes screaming with her mouth full.
---
it's impossible to do unless killer helps out and doesn't kill us all!
---
My dick just got super super hard for some reason.
---
We don't have any info on why this is happening as far as I know. Someone else mentioned something similar in a recent topic, but I can't find it, so I don't know if it's cross platform.
---
You are correct! Haven’t tried to DS dive a trapper since this happened. I can only imagine someone using inner strength thinking they’re gunna be all healed only the become instantly injured upon leaving. Good times, good times. I’m still waiting for inner strength to become a meta perk.
---
Damn daddy stab me.
---
Well it's called a challenge for a reason. What's the fun in ''challenges'' if you can complete them without a lot of effort ?
---
Just use top tier killers, it’s the only way to have fun as killer.
---
I prefer to play the game instead of watching people style on players of lesser skill than them. But maybe I'm weird.
---
Oh I misread it, apologies

Just had someone in a Discord I'm in post a match where they went up against all rank 3s and 4s. They're rank 13.
---
6 rank difference max btw
---
It's always one just trashy looking shirt. Nothing else.
---
Check the store page of each recent DLC and compare it to the clothes you possess on that survivor, you likely have them.
---
That's a big yikes.
---
So apparently BL is now at a point where it had been back when he first liked the perk. He's still planning on using it for the most part.
---
Dcs counted for me thats odd
---
With Exhaustion perks, they can. 
---
And 99% of red rank Survivors run Exhaustion perks.
---
Love how weathered the mask looks instead of just pure white. Great cosplay!

"Lol they're supposed to be challenging just don't do them if they're too hard." - The official forums. [Actually.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/107804/we-heard-your-complaints-about-the-rift/)
---
Ah. Typical.
---
Well there's still some outfits I've been meaning to grab.
---
Ngl it would be sick if we got a vault suit cosmetic
---
It will earn them a lot less money because the game wont be as grindy and Leatherface wont be a must buy for people who wanna get a decent amount of BP from killer games
---
God forbid survivors do what they're supposed to and are actually good at it.
---
Aren’t most streams delayed by at least 30 seconds though? How would they do it in time?
---
I‘m a console player too. But pretty sure that other people have said so :D
---
gen rushing isn’t a thing, you’re just a baby killer buddy
---
&gt;Im also thinking of buying nightmare what yall think?
---
Solid as fuck killer. His perks aren't the best but they pretty still fun!
---
Perk wise from top of my head:
---
Bubb for BBQ.
---
Myers for save best for last and play with your food.
---
Plague has two cool perks. 
---
Ghostface has I'm all ears and thrilling. 
---
Hag has ruin and haunted grounds.
---
&gt;I dont own Decisive, is it worth buying her characters just for that perk?
---
Not only that, but she has has OoO and it op as fuck in SWF if you in those. But you not, ds alone is worth.
---
If you ask me, I would say get what you think is best for your play style. For me myself, I would have got plague, myers and nightmare. Those perks are pretty fun to play with for me still decent perks as well.
---
Did you even read what it said, it said that there is little counterplay with having to grind for it (like levelling up the hag or getting it in the shrine)
---
Or playing a killer with low mobility. 
---
Pretty big difference.
---
Very wise and great propositions, I hope BHVR see’s this.
---
At long last, now you can actually do real challenges
---
Me:doing gen *itchy af*
---
Me: *scratches head*
---
Skill check: it’s show time
---
Happy Holidays to you too!
---
Play nurse
---
Also works with Link
---
The trapper’s traps are bullshit for both sides. Is the survivor going to get free first attempt? Or still be stuck six later? Who knows!
---
It would benefit both killer and survivor for the RNG to be removed and have it take a set time to escape (I’d say about as long as it takes to search a chest). 
---
It would also act as a minor buff to Slippery Meat since it would be changed to just decrease how long it takes to escape by certain % instead of just increasing odds
---
Most streamers have no delay...
---
I thought it was worth putting, as it is the irony of the complaint. 'lol'
---
I didn't want to fucking bother with the "sacrifice someone in the end game" challenge on Rift 2 so I just equipped NOED and nothing else as Wraith, went AFK by an exit gate, and then downed and hooked the first person who came close.
---
Now I have to do it to two people.
---
Man I'm going to get so much salt.
---
As a killer main the survivor challenges are bullshit. I can do all the killer challenges easy except the trapper one (which I just farm) I'm gonna take one for the team and try to message the survivors before every couple games and see if they need help with a challenge. I think they should just go for more long term challenges instead of single game ones.
---
Well sucks to be you, I would recommend you go follow r/LeaksByDaylight they leaked that this will happen a long time ago so I held off buying anything. Might help you in the future.
---
Yeah I might be wrong
---
Shoulda bagged more
---
It's a game, friend &lt;3 If it's not working out for you or is causing you frustration, it might be a good idea to consider taking a short break from it? Sometimes coming back with a clearer head can help :) In any case, there are numerous things you can to do prevent generators popping very fast, such as Ruin or Corrupt Intervention, among many other slowdown perks. Additionally, keeping good pressure on generators is something I find is very important in order to maintain a longer game. Picking a good 3-gen setup to bait the survivors into can be great and lead to lots of success as killer! 
---
Play smart, play both sides, play different killers and perks, and try different strategies!
---
Anyway I hope you have a good one and I wish you luck in the Fog :3
---
I'd say out of those three The Pig would be the best.
---
Both her and The Legion share the same base movement speed of 4.6 m/s (The Huntress has 4.4 m/s).
---
The Pigs only advantage would be, that she can sneak up on survivors, so she would already be really close when the run and eventually vault from you.
---
Personally, i did this challenge with The Nurse.
---
Injure a surivor and chase them to a pallet loop.
---
Once thrown down, just wait on the other side, cause survivors tend to vault back, fearing you might teleport  on their side of the pallet.
---
She is so cute &lt;3 love the glowing eyes!
---
Bold of you to assume i have balls
---
I think they should completely get rid of Ruin, but increase gen times for SWFs.
---
For a 2-man SWF, gen speeds are slightly reduced.
---
For a 3-man SWF, gen speeds are moderately reduced.
---
For a 4-man SWF, gen speeds are considerably reduced.
---
The blood points compensate for that if they are master challenges I believe
---
Happy Happy Holidays, friend! Awesome mask :D
---
Did you have a backstory, or appearance in mind?
---
No, he doesn’t. Fucking Christ.
---
People counter his perks because he runs the same build every game just like everyone else and people talk shit in his chat because he is extremely sensitive and easy to rile up
---
He and Jane are gonna be leading this year's CLAP-A-THON, so he had to thicc it up!
---
Spirit has Haunted Grounds tho not Hag
---
After the fog, investigators searched the scene only to find molten rocks and scorched earth that was still warm to the touch many days after the disappearance, these spots are now a famous tourist attraction along with a haunting tale of a disappearance.
---
I feel for you if you were playing survivor
---
Fuck.
---
Imagine defending tru3 while complaining that anyone else is touchy goodness gracious
---
But in some instances it may take said amount of games just to get one, since it's all in the hands of the RNG, plays, if there's a DC, etc..
---
Anyone who spends a lot of time on X killer can make them work really. Without the meta loadout.
---
Is this a Dr. Stone reference
---
Thank you a lot, that's really helpful
---
Yep, same. Those kinds of games suck and I’m sure it’ll happen again lol, but don’t feel bad for them just move onto the next game
---
You bet I was. 3 Iri’s and a gold. I should’ve been done with this challenge last night if it weren’t for the stupid glitch making you play 15 games and get one each. 
---
Now I’m stuck at 12/15 since it’s not counting *any* of my progress.
---
They aren’t master challenges. And no, it’s not about the BP. Anyone who’s been playing a while doesn’t even need the it. 
---
PLUS, escape 10 times, 30k BP. That’s fucking weak. 
---
So no, the BP (even if we needed it) isn’t close to scratching the surface.
---
*cough* Trapper *cough* give him the ability to carry 2 traps by default you dumb dumbs at BVHR *wheeze*
---
We can't have something offsetting the balance like that.
---
I don’t get paid till next week :)
---
Statistically speaking moris aren't that rare. Especially ebony moris given the bloodweb must give a ultra rare and killers only have two ultra rares they can get for their add ons sometimes less. Ebony moris are quite frequent.
---
BHVR, do ONI includes a fix?
---
nice flair
---
He’s also going to tweet about this post within the next 10 hours
---
I wish we got an option to message killer in the lobby. I get that people are probably gonna be toxic or ask who the killer is but it should be am option in my opinion
---
💛
---
Small Game is rad for totem hunting :D
---
Why does this sub hate true all of a sudden, like wtf
---
For me, my queue times are long af playing survivor, and almost instant as killer.
---
Tbh i had more of a hard time with the pallet-stun the killer two times in one game, cuz everyone just decided to respect all of them...
---
“I won’t be taking another three week break”
---
Rank 14 here often against 10-8’s, yeah what the frick BHVR?
---
Just break the totems before all the gens are done
---
Thanks for sharing and understanding.  I think that's the issue with no voice chat in DBD.  If they want to spend my first hook and struggle phase doing gens, I might be ok with it if I knew but from my perspective, it just looks like they have zero intention of saving me.  I did not consent to being the "staller."  I play DBD to have fun and I'd rather have it take 3 hooks to kill me than 2 (or potentially even 1 if my teammates are real jerks.)
---
Ngl i was still with the first one
---
This is why I quit playing killer lol
---
Dude that's great
---
If they haven’t moved for a bit when they do it plays that sound as a jumpscare sort of noise like in a horror movie (believe it or not DBD did start out intending to be a horror game). I think it was originally meant for when they come out of Insidious
---
GO FUCK YOURSELF
---
Looking at this made me hear the generator exploding sound...
---
Because he is such a toxic man child
---
Yes actually Sony has been know to refund games and things if you buy them right before a sale I do doubt they would refund a small purchase like 3$ tho
---
This is the funniest thing I’ve seen all day
---
if you stand still for to long crows will do that
---
Ah that’s why I have it then
---
They appear if you stay still for too long or if you don't do anything
---
Is this on PC only?!?
---
I love doing silly stuff like this!
---
What I like the most on ghostface is the no tr which can be really powerful
---
If you dont do anything like gens, totems, hook, being chased rescue or heal
---
the Game spawns crows when it registers that you are not moving,to prevent afk-ing
---
I have it for 30% off on xbox
---
ITS JUST FLAT OUT BORING!
---
If your idle you get those crows so the killer can find you. If your getting them while not idle your doing something really wrong and must be staying still for over 3 minutes
---
🤣even more accurate
---
That's a nice rock, but you better run to the Exit Gates soon! You don't want to be trapped inside and lose it (along with dying), right?
---
The only ones who need a rework are Trapper, Wraith, Billy, and Nurse tbh
---
It doesn’t say that, you literally just have to get 5 survivors stuck in a trap
---
True has a long history of being streamsniped, i admit he does call snipers a little easy but hes been targeted a lot solely because hes anti toxic i dont get why people dont like the game being less toxic
---
Everyone I think will say nightmare. 
---
Stranger things isn’t really that good. Nancy has a really good perk, and that’s about it. 
---
Gorgan isn’t really that fun to play. But I guess freddy’s rework is fun.
---
And also toxic hes literally anti toxic
---
Lmfao!!!
---
PS4 definitely hating I just checked no deals! 🤦🏾‍♂️
---
Lol I'm dead 😂
---
For teachable perks alone? Definitely Stranger Things. Neither Freddy nor Quentin has a good perk. For the Stranger Things DLC, only Nancy has good teachable perks. 
---
Freddy however, is a very powerful killer. Demogorgon is like mid-high. So it depends on which killer you want.
---
I would personally buy Nancy and The Nightmare. You get good survivor perks, and a powerful killer
---
Visconti too
---
Karma 100
---
You forgot to put dc symbols after their first hook then a chat log of them cussing you out at the end
---
Well the first sentence isn't entirely true... still agree though.
---
Yeah that's quite the stretch man but sure.
---
Lol good bait, mate
---
Ahaha, I wish there was a 2K vs 8S mode. 
---
It's a bug in customs!
---
RUN BT AND RUSH EVERY. FUCKING. HOOK.
---
EVERY BT UNHOOK IS CONSIDERED SAFE I THINK? AT LEAST THEY HAVE BEEM FOR ME.
---
Slight judgement for using insidious. I can’t see how that would work well on Billy, though I’ve never tried.
---
Redrum seem a bit overpowered. If someone were to get that perk with The Huntress, problems would definitely happen.
---
I used wraith with bone clapper and the addon that lets you see survivors while cloaked (I can’t remember what it’s called) and went to badham and grabbed the people in the house on the upstairs gen
---
Totally sensible! When you're playing solo, you just gotta roll with it and sometimes that does mean getting left behind by potatoes haha &lt;3
---
It's the reason he has it
---
What do u think smh means?
---
Few realise it, but there actually are swathes of baby survivors who genuinely believe that Micheal is ludicrously overpowered.
---
Demogorgon isn’t that strong of a killer and has terrible addons and perks.

It doesn’t help that her injured noises as well as running noises sounds like she’s being ploughed by a horse.

"gen rushing is real" \*sniff\*
---
TrU3Ta1ent toxic? that’s actually funny.
---
You answered your own question at the end of the post
---
US survivors less coordinated and optimal than EU? The bar is already pretty low, so I can’t even imagine.
---
Why do both sides say the same thing?
---
First off, give us the cosmetics from this concept art picture.
---
I was playing legion last night with brown addons and offering. My build was thanataphobia, bbq, sloppy boogers, and ruin, because this is my favorite build to use while farming for BP. For three games in a row I got messages calling me toxic/bad for using an OP legion setup..... red rank survivors are incredibly salty
---
Spoiler: it isn’t fun
---
What stream?
---
I mean, the killer looks a little insane, definitely like S tier
---
I love playing Myers, stalk stalk stalk, stab stab stab, jump scares, different builds with different add ons.
---
I mean there is still wakizashi left so...
---
*Perhaps.*
---
I try to sneak it subtly and you enter like a screaming drunk gorilla
---
I mean... Same with unhooks but everybody is getting farmed in front of the killer every match. Even if red ranks.
---
Look's like red skull to me
---
If you want and you play on pc, there is a colour blind setting. A friend of mine uses it and it works for him, look up colour blindness on this sub and you should find a guide.
---
It's a system setting, not a game setting.

The bar can’t be that low. Dead by Daylight is an extremely easy game for survivors. You can literally throw down every pallet on the map and waste them and as long as your team does gens that’s all it takes. Do US survivors not know this?
---
I KNOW HOW TO HATCHET DODGE BUT YOU CANT DODGE EVERY TIME AND WHEN YOU GET HIT YOU INSTANTLY GO DOWN. 
---
AT LEAST WE AGREE ABOUT MORI’S
---
Not really
---
Bruh I'm just hungry for some totems.
---
Balanced, as all things should be
---
Did you read my post? I said make it so survivors have more ways to escape too. And you exaggerating way too much. Like chill the fuck out
---
Thank you so much! This coat was my favorite to make, it was all about balancing proportions and materials ^^
---
That's a big rip lmao
---
Playing as a solo survivor is anything BUT easy.
---
Hope it gets fixed in a ptb build soon
---
Hey got a smokers cough
---
Oh, so it affects both survivors and killers. Interesting.
---
Meta-defining :D
---
What do you mean?
---
Honestly I would be fine putting it to 5% and doing every gen on the map. With surveillance that would be amazing
---
Yes because 80 second minimum gens are so fun to go against.
---
Ruin is RNG, pop is your reward for hooking a survivor and sometimes you can’t even use it.
---
Of course, Farmette is everywhere
---
That wasn’t even bad lag and you were hit bud killer swings take priority so swinging through a pallet will still hit also you are pretty toxic as well
---
Must have been a gay mod lolol
---
It's named ironically, pretty obvious as we have 20 crows haha
---
KILLERS OUT THERE I WILL DIE HOWEVER YOU NEED ME TO DIE JUST LET ME UNHOOK TWO OF MY HOMEBOYS DURING EGC PLEASE!!!!!
---
Good way to power creep PGTW hard
---
You can already do that on Ps4 not sure about xbox
---
When you're in the lobby and you hold the ps button and go to "currently playing with" you see all survivor names and killer and can message him beforehand or create a group chat with all 5 players as long as they didn't change the default privacy settings
---
Meanwhile I'm just yoinking people in the basement with Ghostface
---
And what about the demo ? :D
---
If it’s hard for you to focus on doing the objective.... please back out if you join a lobby with me....

* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
haloween chapter is better overall imo.
---
Demogorgons playstyle can be mimiced by alot of other killers, myers not so much, especially his fun as fuck scratched mirror. Not to mention the perks you get are actually usable.
---
Then when she will press the button, she will start moving by herself. My brain just got damaged right now.
---
God this is an old meme
---
This is also to say nothing for her addons - that's a whole other bag of mud! When it comes to her addons, I recommend keeping in mind *what* the addon is changing, and adapting your perks and play style to work with those changes. There are so many wonderful and dastardly combinations!
---
When whole team runs to hooked person and try to unhook them even tho killer is there.
---
Hook bombing is when you rush to a hooked survivor to unhook them when the killer is still right there it’s pointless and just gets you or him killed don’t do it
---
I'm still new to the community and game, what exactly does sweaty mean?
---
If killers had the option to decide if they would allow swf, the game would lose a lot of players.
---
casual games dont happen at high ranks. solo survivor is the worst experience in the game by far.
---
Instead of more BP for the killer, why not actually balance the amount of BP killers get to survivors, then start giving bonuses.
---
I had a pretty fun encounter with a salty Bill on the Stranger Things map. I was playing Trapper and having a bit of a rough time finding anyone but noticed that someone was working on the portal room gen (not sure what else to call it, the one with the yellow lights, catwalk with stairs, and hole in the ceiling). The gen was right at the top of the stairs but every time I went to kick it the person working on it was gone. Vanished out of thin air with no scratch marks to be found nor a peep from them dropping. I’d leave and start to hear it being worked on again, make my way back, and sure enough it was being repaired but the survivor was gone again somehow. This happened three times before I got sick of it and put a trap between the generator and wall on the catwalk. So I leave and *hear it being worked on again*. I’m thinking, “What the fuck? Where is this guy?”. Turns out he was hiding in the dark spot behind the oil drums and I had walked right fucking by him every time. He never actually left the generator. I just didn’t see him behind the drums. It’s the Bill I mentioned.
---
I get an idea and come up the stairs to step into my own trap. But instead of him taking this time to run away he starts teabagging and flashlight clicking me over and over in the apparent glee from not only having me walk by him repeatedly but that I was also “stupid” enough to trip my own trap. I make my way to him after getting out of the trap and hit him while I’m blinded. I expect him to drop through the ceiling and run but then I hear it...
---
**snap**
---
He didn’t drop through the ceiling while I was blinded. He went to run down the stairs, likely to bait me into dropping through the ceiling to cut him off, and went straight into the trap I had set and tripped. He forgot or didn’t know that Trapper resets the traps he steps in. I barely start to pick him up before he DC’s. 
---
I have to say it felt better than sex.
---
Genrushing isn't a thing.  There is only one single objective for survivors to complete before escaping, it makes no sense to not do objectives for fear of being called a gen rusher.  The thing is they can't really add more objectives because any alternate way to escape would negate all the exit gate related perks.  Not only that, if they add something else that must be done before being able to escape in addition to gens, a lot of killers would be stronger as game time is extended, but some killers would be absolutely unbeatable in some cases.  
---
They've kind of painted themselves into a corner here.  Gens can be done too fast for some killers, but increase the time to completion and Ruin and other slowdown perks become so oppressive on high mobility killers that the best bet becomes just sneaking around waiting on everyone to die and hopping in the hatch.
---
I made the thread, why would I not comment on it? 
---
I have been following (I was following) for over 3 years and sub for over a 1 year.
---
The signs of him being toxic is in 9 out of 10 games, just look at his Youtube videos because you certainly dont watch him.
---
it is a strat, not if used at like the start of the game, but its amazing against camping killers during endgame
---
Imagine hating on someone enough to post about them on Reddit but you still watch their streams and monitor their chat. 
---
Truly surprising behavior.
---
"I try hard not to be toxic."
---
*Proceeds to be toxic towards someone toxic*
---
You're both toxic.

I see what you did there
---
i dont think it would be a very good shag anyway
---
I have been watching his stream, stopped couple of days ago.
---
No Xbox
---
Back for more is literally surveillance😂
---
Honestly, that's still pretty dumb, as it punishes higher rank killers.
---
I'M TIRED OF TOXIC SURVIVORS AND KILLERS IN EVERY GAME. YOU SHOULD ONLY TBAG AND HOOK SLAP THE PLAYERS THAT DESERVE IT
---
FUCK THESE RIFT PASS CHALLENGES NEVER SHOULD'VE BOUGHT THAT SHIT ESPECIALLY DAY ONE
---
Being a tryhard
---
checkmate.
---
I love me a good Basement Hag
---
i love her
---
Run BT and DS. It is dark times when you have to fear (stupidity) your fellow survivors more than killers
---
...also I had game last night (albeit much lower rank cuz PS4) where it rescued 2 people with BT active and took a hit....
---
One of the unhooked stayed in basement and died...while the other fell after mend timer went off trying to open exit gate
---
.....what the actual fuck
---
Lmfao I've been on twitch twice in my life XD
---
Try again bruh cuz this is funny as fuck
---
nobody:
---
trutalent fans looking at this thread: time to downvote everyone
---
I’m doubtful it’ll happen too since most licensing things seem to fall through over horror characters. I’m merely relaying their stance.
---
Imagine a double killer mode. You could have nurse and clown for extra asthma and wheezing.
---
Newborn baby: \*is male\*
---

---
I play on switch so I can’t get any perks on the Leatherface or Nightmare chapters but thankfully Franklins just came out on the Shrine.
---
For me a survivor main turned into a ghostface main real quick. Those killer challenges were pretty easy ngl.
---
Solo survivor at higher ranks is way more chill than high rank killer. Don’t know where you got that from.
---
"At age 6 I was working in a coal mine. While other kids were learning their alphabet, I was contracting the black lung."
---
(Please tell me that video is why you said black lung.)
---
It's his lung cancer from always having a cigarette/cigar(I don't know which) in his mouth.
---
Oh? I haven't played or read too much on him. I thought he only gains power from blood?
---
&gt; hehe for the one about killing the obsession 7 times, since theres no way to do that (that i kno of) other than to have 7 matches, no less
---
You can use Furtive Chase + Ebony Mori to get up to 3 obsession kills in the same match. 
---
It will be boring as hell for the receiving end of the mori but you can complete this in 3 or so matches.
---
At lower ranks everyone and new players still want the killer power fantasy.  At higher ranks they realise how unfun facing 4 stacks on comms is so there aren't as many killer players so queues are faster.  SWF would be fine if there were a way to stop comms outside the game, because the game becomes completely broken with voice communication which it was never designed for.
---
Bill is so GD loud but I love him
---
SWF is a cancer and I agree it should be nerfed. I think there should be a nerf on gen speed x how many SWF there are. It wouldn’t be a ridiculously high Debuff but enough to feel it. Wouldn’t affect the SWF that plays just for fun and would affect the sweaty non casual SWF. 
---
Casuals always get mad when I propose this, but if you’re playing for fun with friends it shouldn’t matter if you die.
---
If you’re playing with friends to win, then yes, you should all be on an even playing field. It still baffles me how SWF hasn’t been nerfed.
---
I don't think you know how latency works. I hit the input it did nothing a few seconds later I get teleported backwards and then I get hit. It has nothing to do with priority here. Also not toxic just not keen on overly rude comments
---
One way swf could be balanced is to let the killer use extra perks and add ons.
---
Might be a bit busted though.
---
Redrum alone would make me buy this killer
---
Damn, I guess yeah, but mine is more conditional based I guess
---
Just doing their job as white knights
---
Your string of words is toxic to my eyes. AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!
---
The duration of babysitter is shorter than Borrowed time.... why?
---
Freddy is immensely more fun imo. I bought stranger things thinking I would main demo, but I played him a few days and haven’t touched since release. He’s not bad. I just don’t like his prep and style. 
---
I get SOOOOOOO much more satisfaction with Freddy. I swear there is no better feeling than chasing someone to a pallet that you know is fake. I grin every time haha.
---
But that’s him as a killer. His actual perks? I rarely use em. 
---
Surge is the only good perk imo from both killers. Freddys CAN be used for fun, but eh. 
---
And I don’t use any perks from any of those survivors. So I can’t help ya there.
---
Old tinkerer made your charge time addons better. Negatives took less away, positives gave you more
---
Out of curiosity, on that last image were you up against a Leatherface?  This looks very similar to a game I had as killer a day or so ago.
---
It sucks.
---
Because the Soulja Boy Console version runs Far Better than other versions therefore everyone should go buy that version instead.
---
2v8 please
---
Fak you dude
---
E. Laky dude
---
I fucking loved this episode 
---
Big ole bouncy balls!
---
Freddy is good and demo is not. That’s about the only answer you need. Also, survivor perks are all garbage from ST chapter.
---
No Mixer is a streaming site .. a little less toxic then twitch
---
You realize for SWF the most busted thing in the game isn’t perks, it’s gen speed. There’s simply nothing more powerful than saying “he’s chasing me, do gens”. Eventually you have to commit to chases and they’ll all be on gens forcing you through all the maps non-mindgame loops and god loops. Few killers or perks can save you from this and knowing the killer’s location at all times is the benefit of SWF that breaks the game.
---
Also, god loops are the strongest thing to a survivor and still exist on many maps and DS is stronger than it used to be so I don’t know how the survivor cheese is balanced.
---
im out of the loop. what happened??
---
You can get all non licenced killers for free with shards that you earn.
---
But I would buy 1-2 licenced characters after some time, because only myers and Ghost Face are the both stalking characters for example
---
Oh boy, I need to check out that deal.
---
I have some AC left and with the discount I might get Freddy and maybe something cute for a survivor.
---
Mm I love Pork, bring it on xD
---
Why are u doing this
---
I just hate survive with friends.
---
Hound Mask.
---
At least to me and any other EU player this was well known
---
Plus don't take into consideration the latest data. It's a mess, they are not specific like April's data which is way more accurate. By April's data on PC survivors at rank 1 have 80% survival rate and console around 60%
---
They also take into consideration DC as kills.. so I take their statistics with a grain of salt.
---
Anyway back on topic, in EU people are *very* competitive. Even if it's "just for fun" they usually play to win and I'm not much different. I've seen us gameplay and gens takes forever to be done, even playing with some US friend, when he hosts, we just find potatoes who takes forever to do gens. Something that feels weird, used to gens popping in 5 to 7min max
---
It’s got to be the Ashy Slashy puppet for Ash.
---
Me too.
---
I was about to turn a 1k into a 3k,but I could do nothing.
---
Or just give bonus BP for going against a SWF to make it less cancer. Also, no. Survivors can roll through games faster than Killers.
---
OH FUC
---
Do you mean the one from huntress?
---
He's not twisting your words. You said the challenges are fun and the challenges involve having to basement camp and rely on the killer to let you unhook in EGC so therefore those two things are what you stated are fun.
---
I am okay with gen speeds as they are, just give me more BP for dealing with the cancer which is seal team six voice comm coordinating SWF's breaking immersion.
---
I got Nancy for 380 cells earlier.
---
I like bad perks on my web. I use them to manipulate the web later on.
---
Second Wind. When it works, it saves you a lot of time healing and lets you rush gens even quicker. I just love how when it activates, you can do literally anything you want, and as long as you don’t go down or step in a trap, you'll be healthy.
---
1 guy had enough battery for a whole minute?
---
You dumb.
---
Take a loan, mortgage your house, sell your first born! Anything to get into these sweet deals man!
---
It’s Frank but his feral frenzy only works for 2 seconds and with a cool down for 3 hours.
---
I bought it a couple of months back and cannot get enough. There are still plenty of players
---
Iron will
---
So what?  
---
Maybe the SWF would then solo queue.   
---
I would go against the SWF ONLY if they gave me more BP to deal with the annoyance. As it stands, it is the SWF which turns this from a tense cat and mouse game into a match where they have perfectly coordinated body blocks and taunting, ruining the game on my end.   
---
Allow the option.  
---
Fxck SWFs.
---
You’re legit dumb
---
Even if you do that, they can go to your Screenshots and spam there. It’s super annoying, and unless you make EVERY screenshot you’ve taken Private one by one, they have complete freedom over there.
---
I killed one person during EndGame with Hag and “camped him to death” so he commented over 32 times all over my recent screenshots. Shit is annoying.
---
I mean have you seen Myers Mori
---
Exactly!  
---
Just give us the option to opt-in or out of hosting SWFs and give BPs for doing so.
---
Do you by chance play Planetside 2 at all? Im pretty sure Ive seen an clan or w/e on their by the same name
---
Idk people here have an hate boner for tru3..
---
This isn't the first or last time posts like this with a hate circle jerk pops up. It's pretty sad
---
Haha yeah its an fun one
---
Yeah, if people want to see how unbalanced the game is they can simply watch EU survivors play. Like a totally different world honestly. I never would’ve thought this but I’ve had the experience of the EU meta and having all gens done in 5 minutes. Never had this experience in the US.
---
how many hours do you have?
---
Even if they did do this it should be like a decisive strike skill check, not a loading bar with multiple skill checks
---
In his new vid he said hes gonna stream Saturday on twitch
---
Bruhhh keys are barely used anymore from what ive experienced in my games
---
She cute!
---
I love demo, but I think he is not the easiest to play. I would say you need nearly aim like a huntress, but the hitbox is bigger.
---
Myers is very fun for me and I like him more than Ghostface, because I play him differently and no one can stop my stalk
---
I'm a level 4 that started 2 days ago. I need tips
---
That’s my point, not to disregard his point, but to point out both sides have fun breaking things for them.
---
Yeh
---
The two arent mutually exclusive and I'm not exaggerating
---
Hes a cool and clean dude but he also sweats the hell out of some 4k's lol
---
I think the hatch should go back to old school rules first and not even spawn if you dont do the requisite number of gens.  Then yes.
---
Its not, I appreciate if survivors do that, if they try to 360 me, I don’t appreciate it
---
and what licensed character should i buy(that is fun to play amd somewhat decent)
---
Man o man, seeing all the tru3 fans mald in this post is making my day amaizing.
---
Such a magical evening
---
Why doesn’t he hide his lobbies before each match. 🙄
---
No idea, I’m playing on PS4. I play at least a couple of hours most days.
---
Firstly, I'm a huge fan of yours Waifu. Just wanted to get that out of the way.  I'm a 50/50 player and I use ivory mori offerings occasionally. It doesn't make me less "empathetic" for using it either. I'm not hacking, I'm not camping you, and I'm not going out of my way to make your experience worse. I'm using my offering to kill a survivor faster. Period. Does this end your game faster? Yes. But it also frees you up to queue again. It is not like being moried bricks your computer or something. It's a freaking video game. People need to honestly chill the fuck out. Some of the comments I've seen on this post have sincerely irritated me. Since TIL that this community has "empathy gatekeepers". I.e., " if you're using moris then you don't care about the survivor experience !" style comments. Bullshit.
---
If it is in the game, don't let someone shame you about using it. Downvote me if you want, I can name the ones who will, but I'm sick of people in this community trying to perk/item shame everyone else. This is the most neurotic, irrational and entitled community I've ever had the displeasure of being part of.
---
Edit: Spelling.
---
Yeah, I don’t do that. I just let them hit me
---
oh, ok
---
It’s not, just be careful for NOED, I caught a claudette that way.
---
I like the idea of the skill check. maybe make it like totems tho where if you stop working on it, the progress bar starts over if you restart.
---
I play a lot of Hag/Pig because I like their mechanics, although naturally I have better luck with Hag because of the Map Control/Gen Defending. 
---
Even if I 4K, or wipe the floor, I still don’t feel like I had “fun” if the Survivors were BM’ing and teabagging the entire time. Just a sour taste in my mouth.
---
I almost wish more people played immersed and focused on the game, because having a Hot Pink Nea dance at me with a flashlight during chase really breaks the feel of the game sometimes lmao
---
Thats.... still how it works though. Unless you mean when theres one survivor left
---
Exactly
---
It be like that sometimes
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e341cy/is_borrowed_time_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah if you didnt complete any gens the hatch shouldn't spawn in but it does.
---
Not that many people snipe him, he just wants to have an excuse when he gets shitted on in a match.
---
Mmm.... seems fair. Its a twist and a turn to open a lock after all. Should be as easy. I like this.
---
Art
---
If losing a game upsets you so much, you might want to find another hobby. Killers and survs do not have etiquette rules outside of not being a dick(camping/sandbagging), and not hacking. And those two things go for any game. Stop shaming people just because you don't like "unfun" things. Fun is relative. Get over yourself.
---
Yeah even when uninjured she’s incredibly loud. If she is injured and working on a totem it sounds like she’s having intercourse.
---
If you faced these “god squads” and don’t main killer, I doubt they were really god squads. God squads are the one who can end games in 5-7 minutes. Doubt you’d be getting 1-2 kills there.
---
Yeah and then what the fuck am I supposed to do against them, go to their house and gouge out their eyes so they can't see me with Object?
---
That show is actually hilarious sometimes, and it's all because of this guy not believing in ghosts but doing things to humor his co-host.
---
&gt;Bruhhh
---
Pyrocynical is that you? And i do agree but personally, fuck the keys. They are stupid how you just press one button and get out.
---
I'm rank 8 in both.
---
I usually switch when one side gets to stressful.
---
They both have add ons that make you exhausted so idk if it was that
---
I dunno anymore. Everyone can’t wait for the rift and archived just to shit on it when it comes out. Basement is not fun but there are so many parts that is. 
---
This is exactly what twisting my words is, by giving a specific item that’s not fun and ignoring the rest.  For the basement challenge I use agitation and I hunt them down, although I end up with a hag game that they chain rescue and hook them tons of time in basement, and it’s fun so I let them go
---
It’s up to you to make it fun. Eg in the noed challenge that I just completed. I use no ruin no bbq just purely speed up items and bloodwarden. I  kill the key holder and I hook the rest x2. Then I wait for them to finish last gen and I hook one, then it’s over.  
---
It’s not perfect but I appreciate their effort. I have seen many games who put way less effort and care to keep the game going
---
Don't do it if you aren't having fun! :) Games aren't much good if they aren't providing enjoyment and entertainment &lt;3
---
I think I just wanna avoid the player who plays the game solely for the hatch and doesnt help his mates
---
It’s not that. That’s the first thing I assumed but I checked their addons and they didn’t have them equipped. Plus, it happened since the beginning of the game. Before I even saw them. Also, no mindbreaker
---
Bubba: *Happy basement noises*
---
Survivors: *Happy to help noises.*
---
Is the spirit of the holidays.
---
Breaking dull totems for bp
---
With the nerf of keys there must be the nerf to the green and ebony mori. I would think a good nerf would be to make it so survivors have to be on last hook.
---
So I played 2 games with this challenge on
---
The first I got one iridescent emblem, seems fair enough
---
The second game, as shown in the screenshot I got merciless with 4 iridescent emblems... but the game only counted one
---
What is this nonsense? I’ve restarted and it still doesnt update to show it properly. I bust my ass off trying to get iridescents for this challenge and it doesn’t even count it?
---
Hmm then it’s just dbd acting like it usually does
---
I'd be fine with a BP boost as long as it wasn't announced until end of game screen to prevent lobby dodges which is a full blown epidemic in this game.
---
Also fuck babyraging out of games man.  You're better than that shit man.  Toddler raging out of games is among the lowest things possible in this game.
---
It works it’s best if you run it with a healing perk. Empathy is my favorite, will help you find injured survivors who are likely working on gens alone. It will also be useful for flashlight saves once you learn it.
---
This reminds me of when the schoolgirl Spirit cosmetics came out. After I 4k'd I had one survivor ask if they could "spread my Spirit legs uwu"...
---
inb4 tome 4: "Escape 2 times with Claudette, must be done in a single trial"
---
wtf are those missions?
---
Yeah, just grind it out... It's not like BHVR has a record for fixing anything in a hurry!
---
You dont have to apologise but any reasonable player knows there bullshit and apologise for using one
---
*He moves through the death and decay of the void.*
---
Because using data from all ranks is smart, right? It’s not like back in April, red rank survivors had an 80% survival rate or anything.
---
Why would the survivor get BT when there’s no heartbeat as you’re unhooking? On that note I think BT should be proximity in meters
---
sorry for the misspell, supervisor.

'Scuse me BHVR I would like to petition for a new emote

... yet \**Dramatic music plays*\*
---
It's very strange that in a game designed to escape from the battlefield the side that needs to escape gets items to instantly do this. These days you can't even pick the survivors out of the hatch if you're close enough if you closed the hatch once or if they find it it's a guaranteed escape... That's just bad design...
---
Female girl leave.
---
Nah, Demodoggo is just *fucking ripped*
---
A snort is like a laugh, and i'm happy to make people laugh. Great to know mate
---
I'm here to have fun.
---
If the SWF is flaunting their coordination in my face and ruining my experience, I'm out. I play games to have fun, not to hate life.
---
Yeah because your points are pretty shit. I play both sides of the game. I’ll take longer times for a true asymmetric PVP game instead of the sad state we have now.
---
I wish i didn't care, the lore sounds like some badly written teen fan stuff, but i *must* have it all at 100% :/
---
I did this with trapper   Wasn’t as bad as I expected. But it still sucked
---
That’s funny.
---
A lot of these ppl are toxic survivor mains who cant stand to see a killer thats better than themselves
---
*must be done in a single trial*
---
Just focus on one irridesant, just chase 'em all game as killer will earn you one... if needs be! Or with Survivors just don't get hit, use Spine Chill and dodge the killer all game!
---
But thuth be told, all these quests look like they are designed by devs that don't play their own game! Instead of making the game more fun you gotta go out of your way to complete bullshit quests, that aren't really worth the time or effort, I just go for the item and then I drop the entire rest of the archive level and I did that (doing all killer quests).
---
Can confirm. You made me laugh too.
---
-rep I don't realize that the person whose profile I write this on can easily remove it if they want to.
---
Damn. That’s just asking for trouble. But I know it’s for better interactivity with the chat room.
---
But it's just a mori
---
oh my.. what a big knife you have :)
---
GG. POS.
---
Survivors have way more “clutch” perks to complain about. Your survivor bias is showing. Just get out if they have noed
---
Feeling down 'n' dirty, playing Billy's mean
---
Instasaw add-ons are kinda extreme
---
This time my hex totem got broken right away
---
I'm so mad at this Nea I can't see straight...
---
why are you trying to make leatherface EVEN WEAKER. did you get fucked by a leatherface recently or something? lol
---
Freddy and Ghostface are in a good spot right now. I personally thoroughly enjoy playing them
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e31306/yeah_totally_makes_sense_but_actually_whyy_those/
---
So trying too hard to win is considered being a sweaty killer? I'm just confused because someone called me that last night haha.
---
So what should survivors get extra bp if there is a mori because both are what people consider really toxic parts of the game. They won't award a pity bonus for either killer or survivors. This is from a killer main btw.
---
Wasn’t April before the MoM nerf? 80% is not surprising lol
---
the dlc is 4euro , right?
---
I just don’t have the time or patience to play 15 games like that. I wanna play for fun :(
---
Swf are annoying even as survivor, everyone not involved should get a bonus!
---
"Pretty good job so far"
---
I've played hundreds of games as killer and I've seriously only had ONE match i can remember where someone opened hatch and left, and even then it was only him, the 2 remaining people still died, I don't know why keys are apparently such a big problem for people, I guess I'm just lucky.
---
Also keys are unfair, ebony moris are unfair, its balanced, both sides need to stop complaining.
---
Looks like he couldn’t escape The Clown’s gas or The Plague’s illness
---
Must be completed in a single trial.
---
how much do you have to grind to unlock a killer in game?
---
Yeah I played against a ivory mori but I ain’t complaining cuz it’s a part of the game and it’s kinda my fault that I lost a chase twice.
---
If your daily's are empty then you can do it in the way you mentioned
---
Thats about right
---
I’m not biased towards survivor . I play more killer than survivor and I know they crutch perks as well and I do complain about them.
---
Since when has he been weak?
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
By this logic, we should make mori's require skill checks. And if the killer misses, the survivor gets to run away and can't be mori'd again. 
---
If a survivor needs a key for the hatch, then the prerequisites for the hatch spawning have already been met. The survivors already completed generators, why should another check come into play? This just sounds like another killer main complaining that survivors need another nerf.
---
We have weeks to do it for a reason
---
thanks!
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Before EGC was implemented however many months ago there had to be at least 2 gens done for the hatch to even spawn for the last survivor.
---
Heard survivors like it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I've versed it once, nobody plays him :(
---
I'm fine with legacy being added to other killers and survivors, but never again for the original.
---
It was an incredibly long grind. No double xp events. No double perks or offerings. Less BP per game. Matchmaking took forever (very buggy). Actual infinites. Actual jungle gyms. Tons of pallets, vacuum vaults, vacuum windows. Bugs galore, hooks did not respawn (sabo squads...). Bloodweb was a bigger lvl 50 bloodweb than the one we have now, which started at like lvl 15. 1 perk per bloodweb. More expensive.
---
If you really wanted the old legacy you would have to play through a lot of... annoyances to get it. And spend hundreds and hundreds of hours playing, if not thousands. 
---
Kinda like what I went through... Before I lost my legacies! :)
---
It is too late.  Your post is lost.
---
Because he is a hypocrite, he is preaching how anti toxic he is even tho he is toxic af
---
I'll try not to. :P
---
Yea, really contributing to the community with your basement hag build!  What a credit to the game you are!
---
You have to be a survivor main to not like Tru3?
---
🙄
---
Storm is reddit evil now
---
Well I had ham today, am I banned from booping the snoot now?
---
I thought this at sight
---
Restarting the game updated the prices. Doubt anyone has the problem anymore though.
---
Swf.
---
It is your idea, maybe you weren’t the first, but it’s yours. 
---
And like I said. There’s a major reason why they changed it. Just bring franklins if you’re so worried about keys. 
---
If you nerf keys, moris should be nerfed just as much.
---
Seems like the devs have been sitting on this one for a long time and it really shows. The Oni feels much more inspired story and looks-wise than most other killers.
---
I use surveillance on most of my killers. It's great for slowing the game down.
---
Hello, I have come to downvote your posts on opposite day

And that was cancer.
---
I still get stressed out sometimes but that's the nature of the game really.  You kind of have to let go and just mess around if you get stressed out.  Then again if it is making you that stressed you might need to play something with singleplayer to unwind because it seems like the multip2lsyer aspect is what's causing you stress.
---
Exactly, killers on average have to work way harder with the odds against them. Even after a sweaty win, it can be denied by a key without any thought or counter play.
---
I love how the nurse fatigue synched up with the dc. Like she was disappointed herself
---
I don’t usually mind if someone brings a mori cuz it’s my fault for losing a chase twice and it’s a part of the game. Does other survivors apologies when they swf all having a green tool box with faster add ons and proof thyself what finishes a gen in like 10 sec? No they don’t. Usually if they say something they say gg ez or bad killer hahaha.
---
 E V E R Y O N E D I E S
---
4 man swf ok! But 3 or 2 swf team you are just ruining the match for the others random!
---
Realize that it’s just a game. It’s entertainment with no real life consequences so worrying about it so much is just futile.
---
Morris ruin the game because it changes literally every aspect of the objective - they need to be removed not nerfed.

^^^^downvote ^^^^to ^^^^delete
---
Well they already nerfed them once, but you cant make the moris too weak, then they lose all purpose. I personally have not the slighest fucking clue how they would impliment that, but i do agree on a small change
---
Boop and all shall be forgiven
---
Being sweaty = not letting the salty people win basically
---
That's what the description of the perk means then
---
In that case, absolutely buy her, even if you only use her a few times.
---
No, they need to be nerfed. They change literally nothing about the objective. They are just to powerful and ruin games early on.
---
Uh maybe I’m deaf but I’m pretty sure there was zero terror radius so yea...
---
I shall boop, forgive me pig for ham is tasty
---
Lol. Facts called I got 1 take it or leave it on 60 min cooldown
---
Or instead of complaining about the survivors, maybe complain that the devs made using keys as part of the tier 3 challenges. That's why there are so many keys running around.
---
Now y'all are making me feel happy goddamnit
---
... now that you mention it ,a Naval officer outfit for Bill would be soooo dope.
---
Lol imagine wanting to play the public toxic build
---
#THE CONSOLE GANG DON'T GIVE A FUCK
---
If you want to have fun in the game, don’t play killer. Seriously it only gets worse as you get even higher.
---
they were even throwing the match off. lmao.
---
Get yer BP, shards, and dailies ready. Maybe even have a challenge ready to complete.
---
Swf all using green tool boxes with faster add ons with proof thyself. Yeah if it’s in the game doesn’t mean it’s fair or fun. (Those items and perks with swf complete a gen in almost 10 sec.
---
the cannibal has always been bottom tier. worse then almost all the killers in the game. he's good at camping, but not much else. no map preasure, barely above average chase, etc
---
Oh my god I’m so fucking sick of seeing these posts on this sub. Same complaints every time. Quit your bitching lmfao. We all hate keys we get it.
---
Yeah fuck people for having friends
---
Sir ye sir
---
You must not understand irony. How embarrassing
---
I do understand and in no way would I suggest team working with the Survivors and just get he Killer quests done fast, cause that would be unethical \*\*wink\*\* \*\*wink\*\*.
---
You shouldn't get their attention help them as the killer, and in return get your own quests done... No sir, you should never do that!
---
If the players are good, 2 or 3 man SWF is still very powerful.
---
Me using green keys
---
HE'S BACK. BOW DOWN BEFORE OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR
---
Oh no, poor survivors are forced to use op shit, oh no, I should feel sorry for them for not playing fair.
---
I am almost never using unfair offerings or addons on killers, only against obvious 3-4 man swfs, while all I see on trashred rangs is that in every game survivors run a key. So fuck them
---
But which one was sacrificed and which one was gained?
---
All I learned from the tome is that I am a decent trapper player. Thanks ortzdarva
---
Except survivors need to do +1 gens for each survivor alive to spawn the hatch. So if everyone escapes, then all 5 gens would be done, and you didn’t do your job right.
---
God I hate this scenario
---
Claudette shouldn't have been there shaking that ass till daylight.
---
No offense to you, but I despise iri-head huntress.
---
Not saying you cant play her, but I hate how you can have up to 3 insta-down hatchets.
---
Shirtless David
---
I really like Blighted Plague.
---
Thats the most braindesd thing ive ever seen, he does rewuested builds u 4head ahahahahah
---
I forced myself to use bad builds and gimmick add on's an just played for fun for awhile.
---
If they died they died, if they escaped they escaped. I focused on *fun*.
---
However this is subjective, as if you can only have fun when you have dominant wins then your just never going to get full enjoyment out of the game.
---
After awhile of playing like this I found my balance, I play to win but losing no longer bothers me in the slightest. Hell I'm more likely to depip because me and a survivor are having a funny situation an I don't want to kill them because they made me laugh.
---
I've been to rank 1, I've p3'd the characters I want to p3, an now I play the game because I enjoy it without being competitive anymore.
---
You just gotta find your balance man, if not, then maybe it's just not for you. This game has more fans then players, after all.
---
-Visuals all around need work.
---
-Older characters don't look nearly as good as new ones (Meg has eternal constipation Nea looks 30% Neanderthal, and what even are her default pants?)
---
-Remove finding downed Survivors from BBQ so deerstalker can have a reason for existing.
---
-BHVR needs to know they can release perks without a character. Some of these new perks would have been nice to have a long time ago.
---
-Add small bluffs to weak perks to make them useful so we can have more variety.
---
- I know the dev's are working on DC punishments but there needs to be camping prevention. Kindred showing Killers if they stay nearby should be a default.
---
Definitely worth it if you enjoyed it on the free weekends.  The playerbase is still extremely healthy at least on PC, I assume the same for console.  If you play it as a fun horror themed game you will have a good time especially if you kind of get into character.  But if you can't take losing or want to play it like an esport it will feel a lot more stressful more than likely.  I have around 275 hours and have been playing since the bloodhunt before Ghost Face release.  I still enjoy it.
---
Amanda is arguably my favorite killer just for game mechanics alone, and all her perks are solid though situational. Make Your Choice is good if you're playing a killer that can cover a lot of ground quickly like Hag, Freddy, or Demogorgon; Surveillance is great with other gen related perks, and I've found it a good idea to bring Hangman's Trick if a four man with all toolboxes join your lobby. Both dimensions of her powers are decent, sneaking like Ghostface without being broken out of it and lunging at high speeds won't do you wrong if you know when to do it, and the traps are good for stalling the game out, especially with the right add ons.
---
So you DONT remember when Joker came out in theaters and incel culture flooded it with public threats of a theater shooting? Since Joker represents a repressed lonely white man, The Legion is the closest you'll get.  Yet here you are trying to stan for your incel idol "The Joker" to come into this sacred game...
---
I think that add on needs to be changed.
---
Yeah, as everyone has said. Michael T2 has a very very small terror radius
---
The braindeadness of these guys is actuslly laughable
---
Basically going all out to 4K. Using meta perks, strong addons, playing “mean”, slugging for 4k, making sure no one gets hatch, etc.
---
The degree to which you do this and be considered sweaty varies wildly from person to person.
---
Beautiful portrayal of a Meg head.
---
Ok this makes sense. I was aware BT’s activation was based on terror radius but didn’t realize the measurements used for that metric was based more on an audible distance and not a physical one. I knew Myers was on the stairs and thought BT would activate since he was so close. Anyways, the use of the perk is more clear now, thanks for your explanation.
---
OP has such an INSANE hate boner for tru3 lmao.
---
I'll admit, he is quite whiny and easily jumps to conclusion and actively defends it (even if it is wrong). But he was streamsniped badly a couple of times. I think it's fair for him to kinda vent. This is also an old video when one of his main sniper TJ was quite active.
---
Lol people complain about people complaining about survivors when we get a constant flow of reasons to hate them
---
I like you, you’re a good sport
---
No, screw voice comms breaking the game for killers and subverting the experience for killers.
---
If a group is coordinated enough to plough through that shit that fast, good for them. They planned, coordinated and executed a really solid play.
---
Agreed.
---
Actually the easiest way is to ask nicely. Worked first try for me lol
---
No violence occurred during the Joker screening you fucking moron.
---
Aah, so you're just complaining to complain. Gotcha.
---
Even I hurt from seeing that.
---
Its not a "pity" bonus.
---
Its a bonus for voice-comm coordination breaking much of the balance of the game and ruining the experience for the killer.
---
😂😂
---
You are the glowing meditating guy picture
---
Learn maps, know where you’re going to run if the killer comes to you, learn counters to each killer, practice practice practice
---
I agree, really loving this game on switch. Runs beautifully
---
Just keep playing. Eventally you'll get better at looping. Maybe try to be less agression in your play style in the beginning of the game.
---
Learn survivor enough that you get the general game sense and learn how to loop every tile. Honestly that is all you need as survivor.
---
Iirc average delay is about 3 seconds, but twitch does give the option to add more to that.
---
Same; I took a break to play TBOI:A+
---
Repost???
---
You can get plague with shards so I’d recommend pig
---
Btw BT is bugged so freddys “la la” radius does not proc BT
---
I had the same exact feeling with lithe.
---
I can't believe keys have this much power over you!
---
As a main survivor I wish they nerf this strategy. When 3 survivors(clearly swf)  do that, the killer should automatically have noed for a few seconds.
---
they made no effort to dodge though...
---
But I'm saving my shards for oni 👹
---
excuse me 
---
what the fuck
---
I’m sure the MoM nerf is the reason I’m escaping 75% of the time at red ranks now. Damn, it sucks so bad.
---
Spirit nerf: needed
---
Balanced landing nerf: needed
---
Don't play killer then man.  You're obviously not built for it with that childish mentality.  Survivor is a bit more chill if you can't deal with the challenge of killer.  Also there's always Candy Crush.  Available on all the major app stores for free.
---
I'm just more annoyed by the fact all they did was put in previous challenges, increase the requirement and give out the same reward.
---
I wish they had branched stuff out more at the start for survivors, 1 unhook path and 1 complete gens path, that way at least some games someone does the bloody objective. I don't know what their design process was behind the Rift Pass, make stuff as difficult as possible? they can link them later but I'm still annoyed that "hard" challenges are just very niche scenarios . I honestly wish there was a proper way to give feedback or suggestions. 
---
On the oni ptb i filled out the survivor survey thinking i could do the killer later but to my surprise no, and no comment section for additional feedback either. I want to give feedback but it just seems difficult to do so
---
I have over 1.2k hours on my DBD on PC, been playing it since Dec. 2017, pretty much non-stop.
---
The exception being this year when I went about 6 months without even touching the game after some frustrating experiences, plus some other releases I had to focus on. Still, I just got back to playing DBD, and I'm having as much fun as I used to back in my first few months of playing the game.
---
My trick is: I don't play Killer and I dont go over my limits. Playing Killer is ridiculously stressful to me, and honestly, I suck at it. I do give it a shot every now and then, but over 90% of the hundreds of matches I've played have been as a Survivor, most of them solo (I don't like doing SWF because I lose focus and immersion).
---
When I'm having a bad day and I can't seem to do anything right, I just take a break, stop playing for the day, and come back the next day. Don't push yourself, it'll only lead you to more stress and frustration.
---
Additionally, being altruistic helps me a lot. I enjoy playing an unhooking-focused build that allows me to sacrifice myself in order to save others. It's high risk, high reward, and if I end up dying, at least I find solace in knowing I helped save someone else's life.
---
I main him and absolutely hate how I had to pollute my bloodwebs with his perks. But boy howdy is he my guy.
---
Ah, well then I can’t really give an opinion as I’ve never played as pig (I also main plague so it’d be biased lol)
---
When you get your devotion level to lvl 100 you'll have enough shards to get 2  dlc killers an still have almost half for the next one.
---
So depending on how much you play, you could get em pretty quickly.
---
*"This breaks muh lore."* Oh toss off with that. 
---
 These are the kind of comments I hate the most. How do you know what the entity understands? Who are you to dictate what it can and cannot do? You don't. You're not a writer. Lore dictated that the entity "only took humans" and then the demogorgon happened. Face it. The lore changes depends on BVHR's whims and it is not static nor absolute. Stop using it as a crutch to shout down good ideas. New tutorials can be made. This game isn't that freaking complex. And if Lore does stand in the way? Change it. Lore should never get in the way of fun or engaging gameplay.
---
 And why do you "but muh entity" types continue to gender a giant eldritch spider? Unless I missed a stream, the writers never gave the entity a gender.
---
Threats ARE violence...but yes lets still go on saying Joker doesn't influence incel culture.
---
Finish the tome you must, rip out all of your hair you will…
---
Thanks for the help anyway
---
A rly solid play when a killer gets gen rushed so hard that the exit gates are opened after like 3-4 minutes
---
Edit: And how the killer can get 2 people? Hoe can the killer can even get one without camping
---
my life is ruined.
---
Not this clip again
---
Cleansing lit totems hoping for haunted grounds while your friend is being chased to fuck with him
---
Thank you
---
They're kinda hard to spot, but it you really look at the hand survivers hold add-ons with, you can spot them in lobby. Any time I see one, hard dodge.
---
Happy Cake Day buddy!
---
I consider it a way to counter exit gate camping, If the doors where to far appart then survivors could always get a free escape, usually they camp the hatch but since the endgame is a thing shitty survivors camp the exit gate and start opening it asap when you close the hatch, by putting the doors closer together you at least get a chance as killer to stop them, not all maps have this gate placement though.
---
They did do something about keys. They made it a tier 3 challenge to use keys X amount of times for challenge progress. 
---
If you only killed one or two survivors, then they still got enough gens done to spawn a hatch. Which means the keys are functioning exactly as the devs wanted them to.
---
its not, you're talking about the manga yeah?
---
It's a controversial topic but moris are just as strong as keys. I'm also a killer main btw.
---
Ok I get it now. So what confuses me is that if I'm playing as killer, isn't it my goal to 4k? Why does it seem to have a negative connotation? Or is it just because people get a little too salty when they lose?
---
When you have survivors that bad, any killer is good and yes, billy is balanced.
---
Map chimes for all maps (realms) would be cool. But they really need to add new chase music. The unique lobby music is nice but the games theme could improve greatly from a new soundtrack.
---
Doesn’t matter, you can still use shards for plague. So why would you waste auric cells on plague?
---
Quite a bit it's around 9000 iridescent shards
---
Lol okay man good talk.  20 minute queues WOOT!  Part of me wants to see you people get your way on this just so you can see how truly awful an idea it is to separate swf queues and the effect it would definitely have on queues.  Also consider just practicing killer man.  For every one actual skilled SWF depip squad out there theres 5 mediocre groups of friends just playing together.  They aren't unbeatable.  At some point in the games balance we as killers need to eventually start accepting responsibility for the outcomes of our games.  I've been beating swf squads for years and the game was 10 times harder for killer back then than it is right now.
---
This is so old that it references machinegun
---
💛😂
---
I haven’t played in a while which killer is this and how did they not make it out? Looked like 2 survivors were at the freedom gate.
---
Clicking is fine. Blinding me for a save is fine too. It when you just wanna be a dick about it at a pallet. If you want my attention... now you have it.
---
I had someone with an insta-blind yesterday who turned it on as they dropped the pallet before I even thought about breaking it. Let's just say they left that unearthly possession is now in the fog somewhere.
---
If a myers has been attempting to stalk all game as tier 2 and took him that long.....
---
The LAST thing you do is tbag at the exit gate.
---
I feel like the scout would work better but I don’t even think I’ve ever seen that one
---
Hence my use of the words "some".
---
That we KNOW of.
---
Certain even take like 12-15 games to complete
---
You shouldn't dodge keys my guy, you don't learn how to counter them if you do, same with SWF. Put on franklin's and tunnel the key guy and facecamp him to show dominance.
---
I play alone as survivor. Good or not, I don't want a nerf just because they are playing together. The game require a dynamic autobalance system. If the system detect that survivors are repairing generators to fast, it automatically slow the process or increase the number of hard skill check.
---
Package it with a mori rework and I'm game.  Those two have to be addressed simultaneously though or not at all.
---
Well do you like tall vomit Lady or sneaky Pig head Lady more
---
Is this bait? These survivors clearly weren’t very good and he’s a very experienced billy. I think billy is balanced and fair as is
---
Bro it takes 80 seconds to do a gen. No matter who the killer is, if the survivors have one brain cell, gens will pop. It’s not “incredibly” difficult to do gens against any killer.
---
You made me feel even happier!
---
I like both 😥
---
Biker Kate, hot and badass looking
---
How are keys OP
---
It’s okay, people can like things and you don’t have to like them, that’s the beauty of liking things.
---
Clicking is annoying. Blinding can be but like just look up

It’s a must have on huntress i find it’s so fast to get hatchets back

'Wow fuck this game.  Remove that shit immediately, BHVR.'
---
Everyone was excited for the Rift and then they revealed that there would be challenges that have scenarios that almost never occur in normal games, force people to waste perk slots on perks such as Monstrous Shrine or have a large number of the same action required to complete the challenge whilst also hoping that, if it is a surv challenge, no one else is running the same challenge and trying to complete the same task as you.
---
All of Claudette’s clothing is now bright neon colors in the next bhvr nerf
---
Which killers do you play/main?
---
Then what type of bonus is it then because it's not one that you earn through skill. Also the same thing could be said for NOED for "ruining the experience" by have a crutch perk to carry you. I am rank 8 and there are SWF everywhere however they are ways to counter them for example use make your choice to punish altruistic SWF or use PGTW to kill gens because the dev try to do these things to balance the game to not seem on one side so just stop complaining.
---
Thxxx
---
Myers is extra Chad in this picture and I love it
---
That would be so OP u would just be able to constantly get out of the killers grasp
---
It's double pip, not necessary 4 iri
---
\&gt;Keys are unfair and ruining games
---
\&gt;I write a post about them, so there's more chances devs will finally do anything about this
---
\&gt;complain to complain, yeah, right. 
---
Sorry, I forgot that I as a killer player am not allowed to complain, because I have no rights and my only purpose is to be a whipping toy for survivors, my fun which has been constantly ruined by cheap and unfair things doesn't matter.

This is me. I am still only on Tome 1. But having an actual task to complete besides “Avoid Killer, complete gens” helps me stay more engaged.
---
I watched him once and whenever he got a donation or subscription he didn't say anything. Such a turn off for me in terms of streamers.
---
Depends on your side, are you killer or survivor side?
---
Im presuming you are talking about a 4v1 situation and not a 1v1 situation. Cause you said 
---
&gt;survivors
---
Then isnt this how the hatch works already? You do gens, find it, ta-da. Out. In a 1v1 situation with 5 gens, its a different story and you know it is. And how many gens should it be, 2 or 3 that needs to be done? The old system just wont fit.
---
Oh no, they have to DO a gen, geez. 
---
Compare it winning chases, c'mon. Sit and press M1 and sometimes SPACE and chilling, or trying to do your best to win chases as fast as possible, as survivors' objective takes MUCH less time than killer's. 
---
And even if survivors somehow fail to do the simplest thing in the game, the survivor with a key still can escape through the hatch without any effort and without any way from killer's side to prevent him from doing this if he is not a complete jackass
---
In EU high ranks there aren’t “chill SWF” like everyone talks about. Literally doesn’t exist. 
---
The SWF squads you play aren’t good or are fucking around. Gens are done in around 5-7 minutes where I play. I’ve been playing killer as long as the game has been out so learning to play killer is something I know how to do. Survivors can literally throw down all pallets on the map and complete all gens in that time. So I take it you don’t play at a high level? You would not be getting kills in a 5-7 game without facecamping and don’t even act like you could.
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE? LIKE BRUH THIS IS MY FIRST HOOK AFTER 5 GEN LOOPING THE MOTHERFUCKER. THE LEAST YOU ASSHOLES COULD DO IS TO GET THE NOED AND THEN UNHOOK ME. I'LL DECISIVE MY WAY TO FREEDOM. JUST FUCKING UNHOOK ME JESUS CHRIST. THEY ALL LEAVE LIKE MORONS AND SOMEHOW I HAVE THE 2ND LEAST POINTS. MUST BE NICE SITTING ON A GEN AND GOING DOWN IN LESS THAN HALF A GEN'S TIME BUT STILL GETTING MORE POINTS. JESUS CHRIST

No mither, second wind, self care, and inner strength with a ranger medkit for good measure
---
*Red ranked Survivors in this clip
---
nope, I think in general when survivors are performing actions they drop more blood orbs, crouching is one of those actions, so if you rapidly teabag you drop TONS of blood orbs.
---
client sided, you see what you see on your own screen regardless of what your teammates do
---
Does this scenario happen to you often?
---
Billy isn’t even top 3
---
Can't we all just...get along?
---
Red rank Survivors.
---
More like, everyone unhook infront of killer and hope for the best simulator.
---
*surprise, everyone dies*
---
I was kinda looking for a functional build that isn’t insanely memey. Lol
---
But I might do it just to fuck with swf I get grouped with.
---
What mask is that, bud?
---
&gt; If it’s in the game it’s fair to use
---
no. 
---
i just made as much sense as you using only one word.
---
 Both are pretty fun to play, but Pig has better overall teachables, and Freddy is a more effective killer. So whichever you prioritize is the better choice.
---
I would say pig, both are lower teir killers, but pig has some better perks
---
Exactly. Playing killer is no fun when you have to sweat to even stand a chance against optimal survivors, while everything they have to do is m1 gens or m1 hatch if something went wrong. So sick of it, the game must be sweaty and pressing for survivors, not for killers.
---
That doesn’t mean they’re good, it’s so easy to pip and rank up these days
---
This weekend's gonna be FULL OF DEATH!!!
---
It’s legit. Movement while injured spawns Blood Orbs for his power. Doing gens and running around while hurt will actively feed his power. Because crouching is a movement action, T-bags will generate more orbs. Once people learn him and stuff, people t-bagging him will actively be hurting their squad since his snowball potential is still impressively high.
---
You can show a clip of Otz playing almost any killer and you can make an argument that it's broken based on that footage.
---
It's really brutal. And something you wont notice as a survivor: your corpse keeps making squishy mutilated noises for minutes after the RBT pops
---
“Instadown killers should be removed”
---
Freddy he's really good at anti looping.
---
So like swf would clap her cheeks like a national football game
---
[Lmao how wrong you are.](http://imgur.com/a/JHzlc0a)
---
If it glows
---
Wow, so serious. It’s fun, that’s why.
---
They got all 4 gens, and got slugged.
---
I just found this out too and was pretty annoyed about this bug
---
In a 1v1 with 5 gens left, the survivor has already lost and that’s how it should be.
---
Survivors have to complete gens in order to get the hatch to spawn. For every survivor alive +1 is the amount of gens needed to spawn the hatch. If you don't want the hatch spawning, then you need to put more gen pressure.
---
Remapping skill check saved me so much
---
I feel this would be a bit too strong. Ruin / Pop is a very strong combo. Now combine them with Surge for maximum regression. 
---
Reduce the regression to 10% or have it affect the 3 closest gens to you and it would still be a solid perk.
---
My friends (all four of us)'a experiences with the second rift is as evidence as we are going to get. What kind of evidence do you want?
---
I'm going off personal experience too. Billy is still stuck in 2016. He needs balancing.
---
He pretty obviously rubber banded on that hit but aight
---
The return of the king
---
Just started tome 3 and crying inside
---
Remember kids, bad survivors? Pshh, op killer obviously
---
People can get along and the world would still be just as interesting as ever. Would truly be a better place, but that can sadly never happen.
---
Claudette was needed elsewhere
---
I almost did, just needed my last hooks. Both of the last survivors dc. Meg because I wouldn’t let her die by EGC or on the ground (in the corner far from hooks but I caught her after she wrongly vaulted) and Claudette dc because she couldn’t get the hatch
---
Freddy is #1, and Billy is second-- plus he's more played. Ghostface is mid-tier lol.
---
Have you been playing DBD very long or are you newer?
---
Not trying to be pedantic here, just looking to understand your thoughts as I have a different view!
---
They got 4 gens.
---
The rework hurt nurse mains a lot , of wasn’t because of her high range addons she was amazing the charges hurt her a lot. Unless you’re precise at you’ll lose the survivor instantly. Ever since her change I’ve seen really less nurse player and seeing them get trashed is really painful. If they give billy the nurse treatment it’ll be dreadful for him. I can imagine them making him like a weaker bubba where his chainsaw has a time period of use like 10 seconds before he can use it again like how bubba chainsaw works . It’s scary not knowing what the devs might do
---
Yes please, it would make my killer games more interesting to hear a Steve screaming fuck at another survivor so I don't have to tunnel the poor guy
---
Now if we think this lore wise, the entity lives from hope of them escaping one day, it wouldnt make sense lore wise and its completely unfair. It has to be a 50/50 for both sides. Not 100/0
---
Now I know what that pathetic toxic guy looks like irl, thanks
---
But I think it would be cool if there was an in game chat with your fellow survivors
---
SWF is not balanced, is not fun to play against, and ramps up the difficulty to absurd levels. That alone warrants a Bloodpoint bonus. You can have your imbalanced SWF if I get a BP bonus for playing against you.
---
Nah. I appreciate Survivors giving me the free 300 Brutal points and the 200 Chase points at the end of the match. (+ ant extra points in Deviousness if I'm playing LF, Wraith, Huntress, w/e)
---
Now Survivors that wait there and then don't let me hit them are a pain in the ass. I don't understand why they need me to watch them leave, but whatever.
---
The survivors played like ass
---
Those stats are not very accurate to how good a killer is since it depends on the player entirely but NEW Freddy is pretty good definitely not the strongest though
---
SWF are just as annoying as Billy.
---
Nah dude. Main killer. 
---
SWF is cancer.
---
Should be completely optional. 1000+ hours played. Its pure cancer.
---
Gonna miss seeing baby bubbas at rank reset
---
Only reason I watched ochido is because of his montages of other players, but his own game play used to be filled with toxicity.
---
the only time I ever use a Mori is if I want to see the animation because it's new or I have an itching to watch it in game rather than a YT video. Or if I have a Mori daily.
---
Regardless of either reason I always make sure the Survivor has been hooked twice, never Mori off first hook that's a dick move.
---
I mean In a way that sounds fun but that’s probably TOO much communication like jokes aside I still think communication should be forced to be vague and not completely clear all the time
---
Well give Jim the name of the original and he'll credit him. Otherwise, don't comment
---
I want to see this lmao.
---
Discord: "Me lol#1136"
---
Gone for Thanksgiving though
---
Its called friends only dipshit.
---
What if I’m having pork for thanksgiving
---
I didn’t know too until this round when it takes too long to save 25 guys on hooks :)
---
Question: Isn't No Mither just a better Unbreakable?
---
Good joke, had me rolling for ages.
---
I should probably also warn you before you find out the hard way that it won't work against Freddy if you're in the dream state, as the lullaby doesn't count as a terror radius.
---
You can just delete the files and verify the cache. Hell, if you just try to start the game im pretty sure it will auto gen a fresh one
---
Babyraging out of games and closing app is pure cancer.  You should avoid usage of that term until you cease the incredibly toxic behavior you are currently doing.  There is zero justification for ragequits.  You're part of the worst problem in this game.
---
Can confirm. Was there.
---
Hopelessness
---
Be the baby dweet and run locker build
---
DS. Quick and Quiet, Head On, Inner Strength. The locker is your home. Don’t make the killer get in. DS to leave if they like you. Quick and Quiet are your keys so you don’t break in and make a lot of noise. Head On is your old angry man to chase the bois off. Inner Strength is the fridge to feed and heal you
---
Yes, flashlight clicking is toxic. Idk how you don't think so
---
Jane won't be outdone by *anyone*. Demogorgon got nothing on her.
---
Well, they had a lot of time, because last 2 chapters were licensed, so they didn't need to put much thought into them, how they gonna look etc.
---
When my mom and dad find me playing on my 3DS past bedtime
---
Stalnks
---
Gangbang
---
I’ve had games without ruin, noed, add ons etc went out of my way to 12 hook and 4k’d, and still being called a toxic tunnelling camping pos. 
---
Fun.
---
So they got 4 gens done without anyone being killed and you somehow think them playing like potatoes at the end means billy is busted?
---
lmfao
---
Spirit is still better than Freddy lmao. They didn’t even nerf her that hard. 
---
The mid tier Ghostface claim is false btw.
---
You have to work to make some use of the mori. 
---
I am calling keys unfair not because that survivors can escape before completing all gens, whatever, I can deal with it. I call them unfair because there is no way for a killer to prevent survivor from escaping via hatch using key. I call them unfair because they take no skill or effort to use.
---
To be continued
---
The devs should just get rid of keys. And mori's. And gens. They should get rid of anything that helps or hinders either side. Maybe then you'll quit bitching.
---
Second most played.
---
I watched youtube vids when this game was just made and bought it like a year later. My game sense is quite good and I’m more of a thinker than a good player example. I suck at huntress/nurse but I’m super good with trapper and other killers where u need to think more but have less ingame skill.
---
This is why i prefer jake
---
Laurie strode frantically searches a chest for a gen rush toolbox whilst somehow not realizing she’s being double stalked
---
I try not to dodge, but I'm thinking about starting. Just had 3 more games with keys :(
---
Nope. Spirit is now pretty balanced.
---
I wouldnt p4 cause i literally just got all the perks on my stevie
---
I understand. I'm just saying that taking out of context clips from any streamer is silly to use as an "example" of anything.
---
Otz is a great Killer and a chill dude, but I'm saying that you could find a player without as much time/skill/game sense/whatever and find out of context clips of them 4k-ing as a perkless LF, that doesn't mean LF is OP and needs a nerf.
---
When you earn XP for your overall Devotion level it also progresses the rift pieces (the blue thingys). When you get ten blue things you advance a level on the rift. 
---
Now the Tome itself is the challenges. Completing a challenge will award a couple of the blue things, BP, and maybe a lore entry.
---
I don't even care about that. Just make me immune to my own traps.
---
You mean when you go to break a pallet and the animation forces you to look down? I'll get right on that ha ha.
---
You are not just wrong! You are stupid!!
---
Holy shit, that's a fucking awesome cosplay.
---
A father/son bonding sesh.
---
blursed image
---
alright i shot you a friend, i'm tico
---
This is,strange,gross, and I hate it,but somehow,I like it too. Help
---
I can’t wait for DC penalties the most. Fuck that shit.
---
You could say the same for morris because it promotes tunneling and camping and make the killer sweaty to get a 4k mori so should survivors get bonuses if the killer has an ebony mori.
---
For sure. They're both pointless.
---
Maybe if the key works for the individual player only and the Mori is on 3rd hook?
---
So what you're saying is it encapsulates the feelings of playing leatherface.
---
Spirit would like a word.
---
I just planned to work around it
---
You have to work to use the key as well genius. Mori takes no skill or effort after hooking a survivor either. Once again, you're just complaining to complain. You have no actual argument.
---
Apparently they’re reworking tome 3 soon, hopefully this will be fixed as well.
---
It's just a game. Play how you like, have fun, don't be a jerk. Done :)
---
THAT SAID! Playing only one side does mean that you are missing a part of the picture, and it can absolutely be beneficial as a player to play both. If you just plain don't like survivor though, then just don't play it! There's no sense playing a game you don't enjoy :)
---
Baby Claudette running only self care is mad baby Myers won’t let her go out the exit gates because he needs his 2k
---
Have you ever watched his stream or you're just dumb? O.o
---
Can't out fox the fox... Err pig
---
\*5 mins into the match and 1 gen completed\*
---
Tru3 : wow, gen rush. buff hex ruin
---
I'm not taking one side over the other. In just saying both need changing.
---
Fair enough. Also in this clip the survivors only needed 1 more gen to get gates, and all of them were still alive till Otz swept them.
---
Just pause it and do another one
---
Teabag and you get the Dbag
---
Why not all of them?
---
Where did they say that? And are they charging Level 3 because of bugs or... ?
---
Did he camp the whole game or just end game if it was just end game it's not a big deal he's not gonna let you just leave
---
Nope, sorry haha
---
Welcome Perry the Platypus, I present to you my Cockandballtorture-inator!
---
You know, every patch comes out with what seems like a myriad of bug fixes and improvements. The list is so long every time. Yet still, it isn't enough, but at least we know that they're working on those. My problem is the speed at which they balance the game. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever why there are so many worthless perks in the game that just need simple number changes that they won't change. How hard is it to at least change some things, get feedback, then adjust further? It'd be nice if we could at least get an acknowledgement. It's like they change 2 things out of 200 once a month.
---
Please stop arguing it's not worth it
---
“I tunneled a good survivor all game and I disconnected because I wasn’t going to win, and now I will go on reddit and complain that doing generators is toxic and the devs need to nerf gen speed”
---
When the 2 male pornstars are ready before you
---
I’m fine with them as are, if they want to just Mori everyone quickly that’s their Blood Points on a offering they wasted
---
I regularly hope a hex totem is Haunted so I can unintentionally sandbag my friend when they're being chased.
---
Also free points.
---
Im a new-ish player, I only have one teachable perk for a survivor because I bought it from the shrine. I only own ghostface and demogorgon, I don't even know how to get ruin without buying hag. (Besides waiting for the shrine)
---
I'm trying to get to the Level 3 rewards as quickly as possible while also only playing The Demogrogon and the only way to do that is by doing this challenge.
---
Nah, it should regress to 8% on the whole map, without cooldowns and postregression
---
Mori punishes killer. Key rewards survivor.
---
Are you being an asshole on purpose? If no, then you're fine.
---
Dude, I wanted to know if I was in the wrong. I didn't want people to reply with crap like this. Im new-ish and was conflicted. Dont have to be a jerk about a question.
---
It's a competitive game so it's natural to get a bit heated, I just don't understand the tantrums people throw when they lose. I mainly just play killer and it's impossible to win every game, but when I lose I only really have myself to blame for that.
---
when you’re eating and someone unhooks you as you’re taking a bite
---
Good on Behaviour for listening to their customers
---
If it stops the killer from hitting you it's definitely not wasted, however It is a waste to instantly put it down, you should loop it at least once before hand (if you can).
---
Nah killer main here
---
Augeeh 
---
Ooh 
---
Aaaahhhhgayaah
---
Guh! 
---
*gets hooked*
---
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
*gets hooked again*
---
OOWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOAH
---
R E M O V E  P I G
---
I wish some people replied like you, a precise, you were wrong, not a smart assed response.
---
It was fantastic on a few killers and mediocre or useless on the rest.
---
They got rid of it because they didn't want to balance add-ons around it and machine gun hatchets and insta saws were legit busted (but somehow fun, much better than busted ones like prayer beads) with Tinkerer but meh without it. Similar to them getting rid of the Moonlight offerings so they wouldn't have to balance maps around 7 different light levels.
---
I miss both sometimes, but it's definitely a good thing they got removed/changed.
---
Yeah he is totally so OP and has zero counters right? His chainsaw should have like a 25 minute cooldown or something.
---
Keys are what should be changed in exchange
---
Nah that would make a killer’s job living hell now knowing that the second a single surv sees his ruin EVERYONE knows where it is now
---
How can you tell the video based just on the thumbnail
---
He would puppy guard every time he got someone. So annoying.
---
I wouldn't be against a Mori bonus for survivors.
---
If you are running a toxic 4 man swf and are bullying the killer, that's more toxic.
---
As you said, throwing pallets is fine so long as your team does gens in the meantime. Problems arise when teammates need to accomplish other things, or if you’re playing solo survivor and lack any communication. The value of a pallet increases significantly when all three clauds are selfcaring in each corner of the map.
---
i know where the video comes from LOL
---
Low ranks will forever complain about Freddy as they always have. But as you get higher ranks people learn what Freddy’s true counter is.
---
Freddy with snares is easily punished by putting down the pallet early. There’s no mind game and Freddy is forced to break the pallet. If all the survivors do this, you will lose as Freddy even with the map pressure. Gens only take 80 seconds and there are more than enough pallets on the map to waste your time.
---
Of course, this is all hypothetically saying the survivors know the counter play.
---
Freddy’s bass kit is very strong, he is a higher tier killer and a lot of people don’t know wtf to do when they are up against him but as soon as you hit purple ranks that changes and you’re going to have to be tricksy because survivors aren’t way more skilled even as randos.
---
Lucky bastard
---
Survivor rule book for killers page 1482 - The killer must never attack, hook, look at, or chase the survivors or else they are toxic
---
Never mind. I forgot everyone is playing like an idiot this week.
---
Love the concept, but i prefer the caretaker
---
back when I first started playing I hated killer and only played survivor, now I find both extremely fun. I have some friends that never play killer or never play survivor, it’s really just personal preference
---
he's a chode
---
No I'm talking about ones where it's rescue x amount of survivors from hooks during the endgame collapse
---
My apologi- wait GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!
---
Thank god some of those challenges seemed near impossible
---
Depends on killer. Freddy is a good example of killer you should be throwing down pallets early with.
---
The Virgin Meg vs The Chad Shape
---
Annoying survivors (teabagging and flash light spamming) and people who I suspect to have ds.
---
Survivors have stupid shit and killers have stupid shit, oh well
---
On a serious note, any quick tips for countering ruin?
---
You will never reach the truth
---
If you are not enjoying this game, do not play it. Games are for fun and entertainment and if you are not getting any enjoyment out of it in any way that is meaningful to you, nothing anyone is gonna tell you will change that for you, friend.
---
I enjoy this game because I have fun playing it as it is. It's a fun game for me. If I get stressed or worked up, I put it down. 
---
Think about what you enjoy in a game. Just any game. Why do you enjoy the games that you enjoy? What about them makes them fun? Find those elements in other games, or create them where you can (DBD or otherwise!).
---
In any case, I hope you have an awesome day :)
---
He has a very high opinion of himself, and a low opinion of everyone else.
---
Rule book page 1483 - should the killer do any of the actions mentioned on the previous page, they are to wait in the corner of the map and then apologize profusely in the post game chat.
---
I was literally just thinking about how amazing Jack would be as a killer! Wendy as a survivor would be interesting too
---
I use it on m1 killers instead of ruin.  I find it’s more consistent at getting shit done
---
Alright. Set up the event badass. Make sure to have legit blood screening so you don't try to give me aids after I get your blood everywhere and I look forward to you buying my plane ticket there and back since you want it so badly. Don't forget the legal waivers and all that fun stuff.
---
That’s exactly what I did first time I went against Myers as a survivor when I hadn’t ever played survivor before. I just sat there while the Myers sucked me thinking “what is this fool doing?!? Doesn’t he know to chase me.” I def fed him tier 3 and died really fast. Then I read what his power did and realized I was a total fucking dumbass.
---
There is nothing wrong with dedicated servers. They work fine.
---
Would be much easier if I had friends
---
Its getting to the point where I'll have to. It just sucks, I do occassionally have decent conversations with people.
---
That's what I'm saying! lmao
---
Ooooohh I like it, would be better than back for more since I now realise it is too similar to Surveillance
---
I was getting mad at killers today because of all the tunneling and basement camping then I read the tome 3 challenges and now I’m just mad at BHVR :)
---
Challenge webs that provide rift fragments which level your rift. They also give blood points. The rift is a battle pass with 70 tiers. It includes a free and a premium path.
---
I felt like a bit of a dick running basement trapper and NOED spirit for challenges today.
---
oh right, thanks
---
I’ve never waited longer than 5 minutes for a killer match
---
Against a Freddy you drop the pallet and run to the next one. I’ll just wait at the pallet for the stun and run to the next. Gens are done in 80 seconds. You keep chasing me, 3 gens are done. You drop the chase, you lose all momentum, my team will do the same thing. You injure me? I run to the god loop and waste your time as much as possible.
---
Did you not see the quotation marks...?
---
are you sure this is a cowgirl cosmetic and not a Lisa Lisa cosmetic?
---
But please keep making concepts i love it!
---
And?
---
what about two safe hooks at end game that shits the real issuse
---
Upvoted so hard I think I injured myself.  Quality entertainment.
---
I like how their stain makes a heart
---
I'll make sure to tbag my next killer in this nea's honor.
---
I’m always one for a challenge, but this game isn’t built for it.  The game balance is way too fragile for people to be doing random crap that throws the game.
---
Her face is all fucked up?
---
I never said that, I'm talking about when you're already struggling. Obviously for 1st hook you try to save before second phase, but again, there's no need to rush. Saving someone just before they start struggling is just as good as saving them after 10 seconds of getting hookes. Just be patient and try to not to assume your teammates have left you to die
---
Locker reload
---
Tru3 is very good at the game and can play both sides very well.
---
He calls out what’s fair and unfair and a lot of the Survivor mains can’t handle the truth so they complain and have a hate train on Reddit about him.
---
If you want to learn basically anything about the game, watch him and you’ll be a much better player.
---
I'm curious, why do a lot of the devs speak French during videos like these but in the streams they speak English?
---
I guess it'd be because they feel more comfortable and have the time to subtitle it, but it still seems odd to me.
---
All I can think of with this image is "moisturize me".
---
Funny, you say "trash" and I hear "balanced".
---
Must be a survivor thing.
---
...
---
World’s first! Congrats 🎊
---
I don’t chase that long if I am under that much pressure. Obviously the better your rank gets the less you see people tossing pallets and wasting them left and right.
---
Console
---
WHY DOES OUR FREAKING MED KITS DEPLETE AFTER ONE HEAL? NO MATTER WHAT COLOUR MED KIT, IT STILL GOES AWAY? IS THIS A BUG OR WHAT?
---
Thanks! I’m gonna try and have a Wendy concept for survivor out by the end of the week, got loads of ideas!
---
I play solo survivor 90% of the time and idm if teammates use pallets without stunning the killer or looping as long as the team is doing gens. it's very rare that I get a team that focuses on the objective rather than hiding in corners when they hear a heartbeat. (I sit between low red and high purple ranks lately.)
---
Repair 4 gens using dark sense in 1 trial wtf do they expect my teammates to do?
---
Thank god. Any challenge that requires more then 2 attempts is stupid. These challenges aren't even skill intensive at all, they are all just grindy, luck based, and/or experience based.
---
I put my messages to friends only and while they can't message you directly, I've had a few send me messages attached to their friend's request. So its not a total loss and I made some good friends along the way too
---
Groovy
---
I find it pretty much irrelevant how many bloodpoints or pips someone earns. I just want to play balanced and fun games in which you can show skills and improve. Keys, Mories, and also Noed remove the skill-aspect from the game.
---
If you're a good spirit, you can listen for footsteps
---
i don't play him. because he's weak. and boring. he essentially has a worse version of billy's saw, except slightly easier to control. if i wanted that sort of playstyle i'd play billy. or new oni, actually.
---
It's definitely glitched. Played 15 games to complete it regardless of multiple iridescent emblems per game.
---
If you’re getting absolutely destroyed in a match, it’s a good opportunity to take a step back and learn from it. Ask yourself “what was my mistake?” “Did I apply enough map pressure?” “Did I commit to disadvantageous chases?” Instead of DC’ing, use your failings as opportunities to learn and get better. Before you know it, you’ll be really solid at the game.
---
Thank you.
---
Some of then are just ridiculous but others aren't that bad. I'm about to finish the whole top row of Killer ones, though I had to make a lot of survivors have terrible games against totem grabber Spirit on the process for the 6 grabs one.
---
The survivor ones in particular though are just straight bullshit. 25 safe unhooks is as bad as grinding fucking Azerite in BFA. 2 unhooks during EGC can just sod right off.
---
I'll be the one to say it: I already completed the hardest ones, so I'm actually feeling shitty about this. Oh well.
---

There used to be someone that was borderline stalking him. Sniping him for days on end, last I saw it was a streak of 12 days. It wasn't nice sniping either like he just wanted to play against him, the guy was intentionally trying to ruin his experience.
---
My whole point is you CAN drop all pallets immediately and still easily win if your team is doing gens. Also chasing a survivor and getting nothing from it can be the difference between a win and a loss. Are you a rank 1 killer?
---
These comments really make my day much brighter ❤ It's basically Dark Souls and invasions all over again. People just don't want to git gud and they find it easier to complain.

What show is it called?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e35hz3/wow_what_a_crossover/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I was a fan of his for years but unsubscribed from his channel a month or so back because I just can't take his pompous arrogance anymore.  He went from making sensible critiques of the game in my opinion to beyond biased noise.  He thinks everything he thinks is right even when it's objectively really really stupid like his newest gem from the other day "Good survivors toss pallets immediately".  "It's observable" he says.  Only dumb players think pallets are supposed to be conserved......like I don't even know how to even start addressing that one.  That comment needs to wear a helmet to go to the bathroom it's so fucking stupid.  He was super obnoxious with his steadfast stance of Spirit needing absolutely ZERO changes too which is about as tone deaf as it gets.  He blames opponents for his losses and uses way too much clickbait in his titles too.
---
I kinda don’t, I think it would be messy. But I do think we need more than just, pointing there, and come over here.
---
Thank the lord, 25 unhooks and 15 generators is just long and time consuming
---
It’s still a 1 shot if they do or if they get out anyways
---
I think players are allowed to make decisions best for them. Players shouldn’t have to handle and deal with a toxic community— rather developers should implement more strategies to prevent toxicity. Toxic behavior obviously will always still exist but if a person feels like quitting because of the behavior it’s their call. While I am personally against DCing in any fashion I do understand why some people do however I advise against it. 
---
I just think we can’t place all our blame on a players decision in how they handle toxicity, rather advocate for more developer intervention if possible
---
the dude literally said /s
---
Neon hair and .ttv
---
Didn’t realise it made you open locker quicker seems op
---
He also thinks that every missed hit was dead hard
---
i have that perk at 3 because i would always get tons of basement hooks
---
i cant tell you if it helped me but i can say that survivors died on-hook while people where running downstairs
---
So cool! If anyone is wondering about the actress who seems to be the inspiration of Yui at 3:44, her name is Dichen Lachman.  She's from Altered Carbon and many other shows.
---
this is it.. this is the best video on the internet
---
My whole point is that if you have a team that can do gens, you can waste every pallet on the map and be just fine.
---
the survivor main side is missing a few 2, 3,  maybe 7 perks lol.
---
I think Freddy is just super fucking good.
---
I’m a pretty decent killer, but I can easily get beat with some mistakes. I feel like Freddy is the absolute easiest killer to recover from mistakes with. 
---
I suck ass with Billy and Nurse. If I play a low tier killer, I definitely need some add on help. But Freddy is just so simple to use and very effective. 
---
He can obviously be beat, but I absolutely stomp with him compared to every other killer which I’m only relatively decent with, save for a select few. The dude is just really strong.
---
I hope he doesn’t get nerfed. At least not his base kit. He’s very fun, very strong, while still being counter-able.
---
That’s the whole point of the perk is opening lockers faster the other stuff is like so small you don’t notice it often
---
I mean to be fair he's a better killer than Monto for sure, but when it comes to survivor Monto smokes him.
---
The problem is that no matter how good or fair you play, you won’t get your deserved kills. With Mori you could fix no gens/do nothing and be killed, no biggie; with a key the situation is the following: you dedicate to chasing/hooking = actually play the game how it’s supposed to be played and invest in it, but get no result in the end. In case of a key in the lobby which you can actually see, it forces you to tunnel the key holder. And as someone mentioned here: if you being a mori survivors are notified in the beginning. You can’t “switch” to a mori midgame as if you would find a key. That spontaneity leaves the Killer unable to react appropriately. And I agree that survivors did their job well by fixing the gens, however since I didn’t know about the key they found during the match I was continuing to play accordingly: defending the last three gens, looking for survivors, trying to get final hooks. All the while they escaped without having to do 5 gens as originally it’s supposed to be. My only balance change for the keys tbh would be to make it personal, e.g. only the person who has the key can open the hatch and escape through it.
---
4 man tryhards almost always ruin the game for killers
---
You can’t block
---
I love it
---
Maybe tear off a sleeve or something. Or make the jacket sleeveless.
---
if that's the case and you're running BT, then your teammates aren't getting farmed
---
Seeing them after getting out of lockers and lets you 1 shot is small to you?
---
Not counting Survivors available for shards.
---
IMO Worthwhile perks on DLC Survivors:
---
Laurie: Decisive Strike
---
Quentin: Pharmacy
---
Tapp: Detective's Hunch
---
Ash: Maybe Mettle Of Man
---
Nancy: Inner Strength, Better Together
---
Steve: Nothing really tbh
---
You used to be able to check recently played with but because of the dedi servers you can't use that method anymore
---
It’s broken. If you get 4, it registers 1
---
It's bugged, they're fixing it.
---
It's so hard watching him these days. I used to obsessively watch every killer video of his to learn and soak up everything I could and honestly, I think I've learned everything I can from him without the diminishing returns of his toxicity making me uncomfortable.
---
*Every - single - video - he repeats the same, tired spiel about imbalance.* If two gens get done in a chase, he loses all his enthusiasm, it's fucking bizarre how his mood changed and it's honestly such a shame, I was a huge fan.
---
It's even worse because he can't just enjoy the game and I don't know why. I play this game for fun, even as killer... *shudder*, I know, and I do it as a Pig because I think her skill-set is very unique, if not pretty low-tier. I get to rank 1 every season, simply because I played Pig and got good with Pig (I've heard you don't see many around at rank 1, which is a nice badge of honour), as well as facing SWFs etc. but it seems he can't play the game for fun  - every time he gets outplayed, it's because he's playing a weak killer, every time there's an issue, he complains about imbalance and how killers are oppressed.
---
I don't know why he repeats himself in every video instead of creating an interesting commentary on what's happening. Yes, you will see a lot of (sometimes toxic) SWF at rank 1 but that's the atmosphere of DbD, if you're at the top, you face the top and it's a shame he feels entitled to making his content all about excuses and partiality.
---
RIP True. I think he peaked a long time ago and personally, I don't think his *talent* can carry him to be entertaining anymore.
---
There’s nothing wrong with camping at egc but yea that is frustrating :c
---
They hated him 'cause he told the truth.
---
*Spam charges ambush in approval*
---
Yup. It’s actually even further broken than what you described. I had (I think) two games earlier where it didn’t even count my Iridescent. I had to play 17 games just for that challenge. Very annoying.
---
Idk how you would change the mori in a way that seems fairer to survivors but still gives the killer a reason to use them.
---
Ok. Next let's bring back old Freddy and make GhostFace not being able to do anything while on stealth mode. Oh and just for a bonus, reduce the number of Hag traps, reduce the number of Huntress hatchets and make Trapper traps not hurt survivors. Did I forgot any killer that is capable of facing 4 good players and "needs" a nerf? 
---
Survivors love to complain about only Spirit being played in red ranks, but then want to make every other viable killer worse or much harder to use. Billy just needs a add-on rework and hit-box fixes. The rest is fine.
---
I know right lmao. Like God damn OP needs to take a chill pill. You can dislike someone that's fine but OP goes to a level that's almost obsessive.
---
I love it. I want to upvote more than once
---
You seem like a fun person
---
Honestly the top row right now is the best and easiest way to get to the Epilogue to get the 10 rift tokens and charm fastest. They're all killer challenges and most aren't mega difficult. Worst one so far has been the 6 grabs but they can be spread out and aren't too bad with Prayer Beads Spirit (though you're gonna make a lot of people have a bad time in the process).
---
After that just focus on the ones that can be done in multiple trials until they sort this nonsense out.
---
I see what your saying because you are right SWF can be really not fun and the same can be the survivor however they can't change these things without ruining the experience of the casual player base and the gameplay and lets be honest the devs are sadist so they won't give free bloodpoints for something that can't be controlled.
---
I agree with that. this is why I would much rather play swf. not as much risk in wasting pallets.
---
Looking at your post history, youve complained about small stuff, firecrackers and legion hitboxes, you dont really have a right to complain that i made a dumb post. (Although the leigon one is true)
---
More like sub 2 minutes 3 gens done. It's like every other killer video he puts up that gens get done stupid fast.
---
He is just the only one who calls out the BS rather than sucking BHVR dick *cough* paulie *cough*
---
"/s"
---
OP should have cropped out the joking response. The official message is that challenges will be changed. We don't know which yet.
---
No no I meant like commentary wise
---
I was the Killer. I asked if he was solo or not (They were a 4-man BTW) and he didn't respond. They then decide to Gen-Rush me and then acted cocky in messages afterwards. Funniest part is if they had told me they were a 4-man I would've farmed.
---
Uuuuuh coo?
---
r/justgetmarriedalready
---
Cool, good job.
---
I'm jealous
---
that doesn't mean shit
---
As someone who watches his channel almost daily, I find myself saying "What are you talking about? Shut the fuck up" extremely often.
---
He's extremely good at the game, he's very fun to watch, and he's extremely knowledgable of the mechanincs of the game, but he has the thinnest skin imaginable. If he loses a chase, or if he hasn't hooked many survivors, it's not his fault, no, it's the game's fault for being fundamentally survivor sided.
---
Lost a chase and a gen just got popped on the other side of the map - "You really think this is okay behaviour?? You think this is fun to play?? Game is broken"
---
Someone runs counter build or cleanses hex quickly - "Stream sniper, boys"
---
Survivors all bring items - "Nothing I can do against these fully optimized survivors"
---
Everybody needs to flood this man with love on Saturday.
---
No kidding. Playing killer feels like playing babysitter in postgame chat as of late.
---
In high ranks EU the meta is rushing gens and dropping pallets immediately. Good survivors can toss pallets immediately if the others are on gens. Tossing pallets isn’t a big deal when there are so many on the map. Especially when most pallets are incredibly safe and the killer has to destroy it. Seriously it takes 80 seconds to do a gen.
---
Theres not more oinker nerfs coming in is there?
---
stay strong, brother
---
That could be said about a flashlight. You weren’t prepared to dodge a flashlight when picking up a survivor and they find one or two or three in chests. Or if they bring med kits you don’t know if they brought insta heal. Or if you play Myers no one knows if you brought the mori on him or an infinite. And survivors can escape just as easily out the door even if you get all the hooks, you don’t have to get the kills for the game to have a result in the end. It doesn’t force you to tunnel the holder because if they die someone else can pick it up. Just like with any item. You could be doing a 3 gen strat only for all of them to have a brand new part and you didn’t know.
---
And if all 4 are getting out by the hatch then they do have to do all the gens. Finding the hatch can take the same amount of time as opening the door.
---
I'm no dev, but if I had the choice, I would see into how many generators people repair, altruistic actions, time chased, etc.
---
Freddy is definitely easy as shit to play and win with as long as you know the fundamentals.  That being said it could be a little of column A little of column B thing here too though.  You very well could be good as well the two concepts aren't mutually exclusive.  But yeah Freddy definitely makes life easier.
---
Not having a perk called  **All Work And No Play**  would be unforgivable.
---
The one thing I think they missed with the Oni design is his big swings in game lack "weight". A large dust cloud should billow out when he swings and misses, to give that feel of heaviness. Right now it's a large mace/club, but it just kinda...glides through the air, you know? Other than that, great design!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e35li5/can_not_take_credit_for_this/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
A whole theme of western items would be pretty cool.
---
Nope. Not until that annoying, poorly-designed twerp is nerfed into the ground.
---
I would honestly rather survs take flashlights and the new syringes rather than toolboxes
---
*Uhh... Dude? It's clearly just an observational remark of causality and effect.*
---
Actually yeah. True plays following every single survivor rule, does loops right and tries his best not to tunnel.
---
He even gives tips on how to beat him at loops
---
I'd rather go against Spirit than Plague any day of the week.
---
Killer main here. I’ve never once used Ruin, and only used noed when I had no other perks. And I like bbq more for the extra BP and sometimes forget to check around after hooking. I never run Moris either... am... am I not actually a killer main?
---
RIP to thee people who already did most of them 😂
---
I can see that being a plus, but the problem you'll face is making sure the initial killer they go against is matched appropriately.
---
Legion was bullshit and everyone knows it, and the firecrackers were a concrete nerf that made them literally useless, and I had hundreds sitting around in my inventory. Imagine if all the flashlights you had suddenly became broken keys.
---
Same. Especially when you’re playing solo and the swf you got stuck with abandons you for hatch in a match that was already easily on track for escape.
---
see you in hot ;)
---
Oh fair enough I'd be inclined to agree with you on that one.  Monto is more enjoyable to listen to and keeps things more lighthearted and takes a bit more to frustrate him than it does for True.
---
To be fair, was it dead hard or a weird connection. Sometimes I rewind and still cant tell
---
except bbq and ruin arent even comparable to what survivors have :)
---
This right here is why there’s such a massive difference in balance between solo surv and SWF. The game was never meant to have survivors being able to communicate like a SWF can, that’s why there’s no in game chat to begin with. If full voice chat becomes the standard, killers are gonna have to get one hell of a buff to counter act it, the problem is that I have no damn idea what kind of killer buff could fairly counter balance a survivor communication buff
---
I get what you're saying. But at the same time if more people just take responsibility for that reaction to toxicity, would not the game/community be a better place for the new people?
---
That's my point.
---
I get a new killer, dont quite know how to play them, send-up with gates open, and one person on hook, obviously I watch them. I feel that's what most people would do, especially new people. Anyways I get messages for the next 20 min from a guy raging about me camping. Sure, not the best move on my end, but come on!
---
I'm not one to facecamp. I don't dodge sfw usually. Only keys. Also, not everyone has franklins at their disposal. 
---
Also, I'll dodge whatever I want to. If you don't that's fine. You play differently.
---
In the defence of **everyone** who plays this game.
---
It doesn't matter what you do, it'll be toxic. The same list you created can be and has been compiled in regard to the killer, it's such a redundant argument at this point.
---
Facts.
---
But, you didn't have to be a dick in your first post. I asked a dumb question, but look, I wanted a answer that would help me improve, not a smart assed response.
---
Spay or neuter your survivors people.
---
"My little bro here says you called him a weenie"
---
Keys are usually the only reason I lobby dodge, or if I'm just not in the mood to go up against three+toolboxes
---
I got Sloppy Butcher 6 bloodwebs in a row. On Plague.
---
5-7 minute games are good? You are idiot if you think the killer will rank up even if he plays good. I seriously doubt you play 5-7 minute games.
---
Then why don't you like tru3? To many helpful tips?
---
Both keys and moris need nerfs. They are unfun for the other party.
---
Lmao butt-hurt Billy mains. Your sprinting tard will be dealt with soon enough.
---
If y'all follow his Twitter he gives constant updates, he also might start streaming soon since he has better Internet
---
Why did you got so many downvotes?
---
Yes we must hopefully he does stream
---
*Okay, game's over, it was good but we're playing [insert weak killer] so we didn't stand a chance any way.*
---
Leather face if you don't have bbq and if you have it I would get hag
---
Hes easy to use
---
What a fantastic game
---
If they're changing 3, you would think they would also change 4. They're probably going to review them right after these changes.
---
I am all for an art book. And the props around their office
---
You are lucky. I'm still waiting. I made this meme, posted it, and am still waiting for a game.
---
nah nah nah now i want emotes in the game this is lit
---
It's not just bming the killer but other survivors as well from time to time
---
Yeah but Mori good, key bad. /s
---
The best case I can see against keys is that it doesn't require you to have significantly participated in the match to use. Though that is probably a niche case and will be reflected in the final score.
---
An activation time for the key might be warranted. Allow some counter play (beyond Franklin's Demise) so survivors can't just pop and drop during a chase.
---
Not /s
---
Delay is based on internet connection and streamer settings
---
All the killer needs is to have ruin or abandon chase occasionally and you will have a complete void in your map.
---
HEY SAME BUT GOOD NEWS
---

---
Remember that Billy is the 2nd most-played Killer, and the 2nd best as of now. He hasn't left the top 3 best Killers since the game's launch. In other words, there are a TON of butt-hurt Billy mains out there who don't want their free wins challenged.
---
Because he doesn’t actually want to stop being sniped. He gets to spam post YouTube videos with clickbait titles about “wrecking bullies” and so on. Those videos are his main source of views on YT.
---
wonder what they'll do for tome 4. that one's even worse
---
My question to you then is why in the fuck wouldn't it make more sense to do that exact same thing ie one gets chased others plow gens but like actually have the person being chased try to use pallets intelligently to waste more time.  There is plenty of room to safely avoid hits by tossing pallets when you need to without leaving perfectly good loops on the table by prematurely wasting the pallets.  There's zero benefit to just immediately wasting the pallet when there are safe loops available beforehand.  The more pallets available the longer in the match the easier and free af your games become.  That whole concept is just nonsense to me as someone that knows how to loop.
---
While I agree, it isn’t fun to do chases on certain maps because of their design. Having to break off certain chases or else throw the entire game isn’t particularly fun.
---
Lmao nope. He's the most braindead easy Killer. Stop trying to defend his broken ass.
---
No just in general its annoying and rude and they dont deserve it
---
One the exit gates are powered, a timer appears on the top of the screen. If the survivors don't escape the trial before the timer runs out, they are automatically sacrificed. This keeps the game for going on longer than it has to.
---
O M G
---
Yea, they need to make challenges super broad and non-gameplay effecting tbh. They should only have stuff like "Win 1 game with trapper", "4 K a game", "Escape via hatch 1 time", etc.
---
HOW
---
this is wrong. it's actually
---
Demogorgon: BOIIIIIIIIIIII
---
She is still one of the best killers even on console once you master her. Ik someone on ps4 who users her at like rank 1 and crushes
---
If thats what you think, i hope one day we can get a game together.
---
Yes that is why you take chases to already repaired gens.
---
Survivor is way less stressful than killer. Definitely the fun option
---
Ups the chances of saves a lot too, lockers near doorways are super generous and theres always lockers near hooks.
---
I mean If they jumped in that locker in the first place they probably have head on or DS to use plus once someone does it and people realize they have it nobody jumps in lockers
---
It's a biiiiiiig map man.  Also one that is known for some particularly rough dead zones where there are no defenses of any kind.  OP made the argument that no matter where you are you can ALWAYS make the building and that is pure nonsense.  Between broken pallets and bloodlust there are plenty of spots you can initiate the chase with them where there is no way in hell they can safely make the building and it's window without eating a down.  If they're anywhere near the building sure they will beeline it for there but there are a lot of areas you can catch survivors om Crotus where they simply won't make it.
---
Spare some bloodpoints? ;-;
---
Oooooh. Ok yeah I can remember there being like 30m games because people look for the hatch and shit. I’m happy to see they did something about it.
---
Question though. If they get auto-sacced by timer and you’re playing killer do you still receive the sacrifice points?
---
Perhaps all the gens in the terror radius rather than just one.
---
I'm a Killer main. It's okay, butt-hurt Billy main. Your favorite tard cosplaying as Leatherface will be dealt with soon enough.
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
I try to save it for the most epic, fun chases. If a survivor and I had a particularly exciting and fun interaction, I'll end the chase with my mori to cap it off
---
(Though I do make my best effort to make sure the mori happens after they've had ample play time and got to enjoy some meaty chases. The mori has to come after I've gotten to know them &amp; we've established our rivalry)
---
As weird as it is to mori someone and push them out of the game, for me it's kind of like a gesture of.... respect?
---
clown for his perks or spirit for her power (and some good perks)
---
Ummm...
---
There was a time when I played Nurse on PS4 for about a month. I was starting to get really good. Made good blinks and was getting a lot of praise from others in messages. I ultimately decided to give her up for a few reasons.
---
1) Controller. It's no surprised that it's very difficult to blink accurately with a controller. It took many hours to get the "feel" when playing her on my ps4. Tbh the controller wasn't too bad to use for her. With sensitivity maxed you can turn really fast. Still manageable but takes a lot of practise with a controller.
---
2) The frame drops. I know the frames have improved greatly since I last played nurse but they are still bad at times. You could sometimes blink and just get a massive frame drop completely making the blink useless. Until random frame loss is dealt with nurse will continue to struggle on console.
---
3) She plays differently then other killers. This one was a big deal for me. For the time I was playing her I could completely ignore things that other killers had to deal with like pallets. It made going from her to another killer rather annoying. She just plays so differently. I guess that's not a bad thing  but for me I like to play all killers.
---
In closing I would suggest not playing nurse as a new player. She's very difficult to learn and eventually master. I would say to maybe try her out when you get some good teachables and are looking to play the game differently. She can be a force to be reckoned with.
---
Can we add emotes into dead by daylight for killers and survivors?
---
This is how I try and do it. They made end game saves a bottleneck though, that's a douchey choice.
---
"Reeeeeeee-"
---
Says the one who gave me shit about Billy a couple days ago, claiming to not be a Billy main lmao.
---
My God, Billy mains are the sweatiest, most toxic people around.
---
Freddy can counter god loops with his snare, my first reflex is always to put some of them here. 
---
If you do that you'll run out of pallet very quick. With Ruin, his addons and pop the gens don't take way more than 80 seconds to do and as soon as someone is downed, you loose the momentum since someone has to go save him.
---
I agree with OP Freddy is borderline OP. I'm red rank and have never lost with him but I still loose with Spirit although she's my main.
---
And if like me, you don't break the pallet, you'll likely won't make it to the next one since I dodge the stun.
---
Face the wall when you pick up a survivor or wait a second before doing so. Instaheals are not a gamechanger that allows you to escape. Toolboxes and healing in general can be affected by perks for example discordance, sloppy, addons for making survivors broken and again - not an instant escape guarantee. Facing a Myers, let alone with infinite t3 is so much rarer than facing a key + if you see him, you know that this addon is a possibility + you can figure that out when his t3 lasts longer than a minute. I, and many others play Killer to get kills and it’s the ultimate goal no matter what, just how escaping is for survivors. Defending the last three gens IS NOT a three gen strat. It’s what a Killer does at the end of the game, even if the gens are not a three gen situation. Yes, finding the hatch can be difficult, but not if you’re on comms and three ppl are looking for it. I understand using a key when the Killer has NOED and the going to the gate is too dangerous, when you’re the last survivor, when Bloodwarden is active, when you’re in a chase and have no way of getting to the exit. What they did is well... not toxic, illegal, bannable. Just unpleasant and unfair, which I still believe. Just like a Killer using a mori, which I never said was fair and balanced. Make moris single use only, have other/additional conditions, make it so that you can only mori whoever is dead on hook anyway. Both of these are unfair and unbalanced. But tbh as a player with 60% survivor 40% killer games, I come across keys more often than moris. And there’s no way to counter them except well killing everyone early, which honestly doesn’t happen so often, that’s why you get five gens time to do so.
---
You will never know the fun that is Bill Squad.
---
So? They always play under the same conditions and dont determine the entire outcome of a match by using 1 single offering. I agree that keys should not exist.
---
Unironically? Get good
---
That's legit it, just get better at skilm checks or run small game to hunt ruin
---
Which the killer won't continue mindlessly chasing you towards if they have half a brain in their head.  Smart killers recognize that obvious bait and break chase and force the pressure towards the remaining objectives.  That strategy only works against mindless tunnelers and probably NOED gamers.
---
Yeah I remember that guy too. Not gonna give him the satisfaction of mentioning who it is. I've seen other streamers get sniped before. Pace22 in Sea of Thieves has to leave servers because people will say "oh shit it's pace!!!" and ask for screenshots with him and stuff. What true deals with is not that type of sniping. It's clearly a malicious attempt to ruin his experience in the game. Anyone who's witnessed any of the toxic assholes I'm referring to (yes this has happened more than one occasion, it's unclear whether it's one person coming back with new usernames or multiple different people) knows how obvious it is that these people are not fans. 
---
It's sad honestly. You can disagree with a streamer and their personality and opinions without going out of your way to ruin their in game experience. It honestly makes me feel bad for this community. Ive never seen anything like it in any other game. Even streamers who get caught aimbotting in competitive games like CSGO or Overwatch don't get this bad of treatment. They get hate messages and trolls just like true, they dont get people trying to sabotage their games (beyond just forcing a draw on the game they get caught using the aimbot).
---
*bloodlust one kicks in*

ah fuck ah fuck my game is frozen

Boop the snoot and all will be forgiven

Yes, you do. Perks like Freddy's Blood Warden are made to try and kill survivors by the End Game Collapse timer.

Right, cause it's sooooo hard to win 2 whole chases as a killer. Wow.
---
Why are you disappointed? There was one posted 6hrs before your post.
---
They also come with a new set of bugs and some how break haddonfield audio
---
You absolutely cannot be “as good” as you can on PC. Console cannot move the camera the way PC can. It’s pivotal
---
Even if NM allowed you to avoid dropping blood for Oni and prevented slugging, being one-shot the whole game would still be enough of a handicap to not make it worth your time. If you run 4 NM’s, though, any killer will be so intimidated that they pretty much have to let you win.
---
While we're making changes, can we require that people need to at least safety pip to get the challenge? I'm tired of all the people who either farm, only focus on doing the one thing they need to do and not play the game, or go and get themselves killed once theyre done with theirs.
---
RIP old friend, you will be missed :(
---
Oh then a personal favorite of mine is demo
---
She was always bad on console, but on PC her red rank survivor murder rate dropped from 73% to 66%, which puts her at the 5th lowest kill rate. You can still argue though that in the hands of an excellent nurse, she is still one of the best killers.
---
 The thing is... FNAF is very old and really nobady remembers it, so novady would be excited for a FNAF chapter.
---
This is an old template
---
Thats so dumb.
---
Lol i say bruhhh alot I actually forgot about pyro haven’t watch him in a hot minute
---
You leave the one shitty perk on your web. When you unlock all the others, keep that one there. It’ll show up every time you get a new web. That’s the first thing the entity will take from you. 
---
So from there, you can make 2 branches away from it to grab the items you need. 
---
Either that, or it could be positioned to take out half the web, so you don’t need to waste BP.
---
Easy refresh.
---
How is he toxic?
---
This is something I'd like to know aswell
---
Oh! I didn’t even think about that. I used to play Freddy as a main but I quit because he always felt so weak at higher ranks. I feel like the game might be worth coming back to! Thanks for the help identifying the stuff here! :)
---
And when he does badly with a killer he’ll spend the entire game bitching to chat and convincing his followers that the killer he’s playing is a shit killer and he always knows exactly how to fix that killers problems. Like just admit your faults
---
Saying she’s one of the best killers on console is laughable
---
I too prefer to be spoon fed.... Really more than 2 attempts is absurd?
---
They really aren't that difficult that you shouldn't be able to get them all done by the time the next tome gets released.
---
Yep, I am rank 6 surv and we just got balanced against a guy rank 15 that had 1 perk on his Legion
---
Ever since I started playing DBD again a few weeks ago I've been saying that Freddy is sleeper OP (pun intended). His base kit offers both ways to quickly end chases and high map mobility for pressure on top of automatic game slowdown. He's by far the most overloaded killer and his add-ons just crank that up to 11. He synergizes with just about any perk build you want to throw on him too. STBFL? Spirit Fury Enduring? Game slowdown and gen control? Freddy works with it all. Overcharge Freddy isn't even a meme anymore.
---
Well, now the numbers actually back it up. Freddy is legit the most powerful killer on the game even beyond our "beloved" Rin-chan. I'm guessing he's going to once again be up on the chopping block soon, so enjoy wrecking with him for now.
---
Damn, this is actually badass
---
Survivor mains up in here claiming nurse is totes super strong on console. Lmfao
---
I had Bond on I saw what he was doing
---
I mean if you master her she is as she still ignores survivors one defense but it’s all a matter of opinion anyway
---
Fuck off
---
It's not toxic but personally, as killer I usually prefer if my survivors just leave. The "free hit" takes me out of my immersion and by that point I just want to take my loss and play a new game as quickly as possible
---
back at it again
---
By law I'm required to downvoted any ok boomer memes and comments. It's a dead meme
---
It’s amazing. Nice cosplay. &lt;3
---
Just one thing: Next time you take pictures, make sure there’s nothing in your pockets. It just looks better and more aesthetic.
---
Yeah, they are. Survivors have to do enough gens to even spawn the hatch, and then they have to find it. And if the killer has Franklin's demise, they could lose the key. Then again, you're the dumbass from the other thread that thinks winning 2 chases as a killer is extremely hard to do and that makes mori's ok but keys not ok.
---
When I do cleanse HG, I usually let out a little inhale through the teeth and a quiet "oops", even if I'm a solo
---
I think it’s more along the lines of he wants a chance at winning. When Tru3 played fighting games he never really complained if a person was better. He accepted it. In DBD there’s things that are unbeatable like 5 min gens and in EU this is very commonplace. He also uses player builds so I think he wants to give them a good game. With a 5 min game you can’t win at all.
---
Exactly, "yes, but actually no". But as a killer main if I see 4 no mithers I'm hiding in the corner
---
I don't know if you know this but they've reworked Freddy and he's now statistically the most lethal killer in the game in all ranks. You should definetly come back!
---
You used to able to block all basements. Now you can only block the basement in a couple places
---
Bill as a gun slinger would be incredible.
---
Describing unoptimal play as a meta is just really shocking to me.  Again there is a football field of middle ground between wasting pallets immediately and safely looping them to make them offer more value.  These are the types of players that hand games to me when I'm playing killer.  Wasting pallets isn't meta it's just lazy selfish play.  Any good survivor should know when it is safe to continue the loop and when it is time to toss.  If you use pallets optimally in that same strategy with the others plugging the gens there's no chance of the killer regaining momentum on the final 2 gens where all the defenses are gone and they can safely win a war of attrition against you.  This just sounds like rank 20's trying to troll the community into thinking their use of pallets is the red rank meta lol.
---
So true...
---
Thompson House can be blocked as well I believe
---
Yeah, I noticed that right after the photo, lol. Didn't bother me too much though since we were about to leave the convention shortly after the photo was taken
---
Lmao that's why he's never left the top 3 best Killers since LAUNCH, despite being a vanilla character.
---
Does anybody know when this DLC will be out?
---
&gt;butt-hurt Billy
---
Damn. Do you know something I don't? Because last time I checked, my last 100 killers game probably 1 or 2 were with Billy. 
---
I'm a Piggy main, but I'm tired of devs nerfing the only killers who can deal with very optimal 4man swf.
---
The one who didn't ready up in the lobby.
---
&gt; Against a Freddy you drop the pallet and run to the next one. I’ll just wait at the pallet for the stun and run to the next.
---
People like you are why I run SF/Enduring on Freddy. I'll break 2 of your pallets, teleport to your friends and double hit then with the auto break. So yes please keep throwing pallets at me like a rank 20 Nea.
---
This is a top quality shitpost. Thank you.
---
I don't know him enough to even care or  mind anything about him yet except why does he wear that stupid cap all the time?
---
Chillin... killin’
---
buying at full price without even realizing there would be a sale the next day
---
Wow! Really? I haven’t played is ages but I used to be pretty good if I do say so myself hahaha. I’ll definitely check it out! I played on PS4, but have been looking at going PC recently if I came back. Thank you so much!
---
"That's the way she goes"
---
I actually have a google doc I’m working on which is for a concept shining chapter. Not finished the whole chapter and just finished Jack, I went all out with him and even did all of the ad ons and described his animations. I based his ability on The Shine but it’s awesome to see another concept for Jack
---
He is most wanted licensed killer by far
---
Dr is a black man also, right?
---
In b4 this gets to hot
---
I find him insufferable and whiny. He takes a party game way too seriously. He makes shit up about people. He allowed his mods and community to bully me for a solid half hour because I said it’s lame when killers camp a hook and a slug
---
*COUGH COUGH* Bethesda *COUGH COUGH*
---
He never says that though? Idiot
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e35xts/should_i_spend_shards_on_spirit_or_wait_for_oni/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
All good survivors will run DS. I really don’t know how it’s not optimal when games literally go faster this way than any other. It’s not like the other meta never existed here in EU, it’s just that survivor is so easy you really don’t have to do anything advanced to win.
---
Like really man, it doesn’t matter if you toss pallets if others are on gens. If you break chase you lose momentum. Remember you have to hook me 3 times. We can do gens faster than you can break pallets. And we will force you to break every pallet we can.
---
3 gens can be done in 80 seconds and if that happens, you already lost as killer. You really think there’s a “war of attrition” when it comes to generators lol. Gens will be done no matter what if the team is good.
---
Ahhh okay. Then it’s fine lol. I thought it was an actual photo shoot or something. Not to mention, you have a very pleasant and photogenic face to look at. You were born to cosplay. 
---
And I just checked your Twitter too. That Leatherface mask is sooo good. Good shit!
---
Nice hate bandwagon
---
And there's me, at the beginning of the first 1 xd
---
 No problem! Hope you have fun if you come back!
---
What's the show?
---
sorry for the awful quality of this “video”
---
BHVR is a french canadian company, in french Entity is a feminine word. when talking about the Entity they would use french
---
They would also constantly say She and her when talking about the Entity.
---
The entity is a she. Cry about it.
---
Thank you so much!!! That really means a ton to me 😭
---
Damn I wanted to do add-ons but it seemed like a lot of effort and I didn’t have enough space, but I would really like to see your doc when it’s finished!
---
Honestly a little bit of a activation time I'm fine with, though that doesn't seem to fix the supposed problem that I'm still unsure what even is
---
Didn’t you see the stats? Trapper is just the most popular killer, obviously.
---
How do I actually get an iridescent thing. I don’t understand that whole system.
---
It’s always worth trying! After playing her a handful of times a couple months ago, I played her again yesterday and I ended up getting a 4K on my first game (plus the adept nurse achievement). She’s fun to play and it’s rare to see her. (Edit: It is annoying that her blinks are limited to 2 now unless you have an add-on or something, but I love her mobility regardless. It makes it more of a fun challenge.)
---
Yeah, and what about solo survs?? Sounds to me like SWF is the real issue, and having only like 3 viable Killers is the result. Pig mains are usually among the most chill players. What's your story? Billy is fundamentally broken, complete with bugged hit-boxes and absolutely no cooldowns. I say this as a Killer main, who mainly plays surv solo.
---
Here's one that gets me cracking up saw this recently.  He's playing Ghostface against solid survivors and they were making good plays against him.  
---
True - "You're just lucky I'm not running my build right now"  (blames the viewer build he's running for his troubles) okay fair enough sometimes they give him terrible perks.
---
I look down to see what they gave him and see Ruin, PGTW and Dying Light.......dude how are you blaming the perks for this match right now?
---
Nah, I did it for my Inner Strength.
---
Took me like 30 games to drop 15 pallets
---
So where did the "ok boomer" thing come from
---
Yeah buddy welcome to DBD.
---
I mean i guess if you enjoy slamming your head against a wall repeatedly like that, it does at least explain the brain damage.
---
not to mention most onis are gonna run thana
---
...this is absolute nonsense. I don’t believe for a second people play this way. It isn’t more risky to loop a pallet a couple times before throwing it unless you’re injured, and then only maybe.
---
Utter nonsense
---
Why the down votes? Lol
---
I agree it's too close to Doctor
---
Not to mention that disgusting Grammer
---
I'm only three comments into this thread and you're doing a good job of proving him right lmao
---
Weird, but in two games I was complement for playing the hag well and for a match being fun.
---
I guess, people just don't face the hag often.
---
4 matches, and all 4k D: 0 hooks outside of the basement.
---
It was actually fucked because killers base powerals were all generally really bad that you needed tinkerers or you were an idiot, example, trapper setting his traps used to take 5-6 seconds each, maybe more, and disarming took 1 second.
---
It's not that she isn't.  It's just unbelievably difficult to actually use her. The controller makes it hard enough but your frame rate tanking every blink is just the worst
---
Doesn't make Stridor bad on her. Especially if you run into a lot of iron will users.
---
Classic Shroud for ghosty boy once they fix it
---
If you turn up the sensitivity it’s really not a big deal. You can look up Nurse Console players on youtube and you’ll see they play VERY well. But it takes a long time to get that good
---
\*Laughs in Francis\*
---
Looks like Hotline Miami sprite.
---
I’m gonna be the guy. You capitalized and misspelled grammar. &lt;3
---
&gt;about solo survs
---
Sadly the game just can't be balanced around solo survivors (and this affects me since most of the time I play survivor, I play solo too). 
---
And Billy isn't broken. For example, Spirit with Prayer Beads was broken. They just need to fix hitboxes and maybe, add a very small cooldown. The rest is fine.
---
I feel like if they got rid of master challenges and made it so they can be done over several trials and allows us to have multiple challenges at a time would be a nice fix
---
Found one of his subs
---
On the 3th of dec it will be fixed 🙌
---
Now that's entitlement
---
Edit: just seen your flair. It definitely checks out
---
This subreddit is mainly killer mains, you can see way more posts about killers than survivors, unless they’re posting a clip. People don’t like Tru3 because he complains and complains and it makes his content unfun. He may be good, but he’s not fun to watch.
---
Whatever, It just looks cool. The game itself hasn't aged well, yet it is good visually and some characters are really terrifying.
---
thanos nea is kinda hot tho
---
It’s coming.
---
it's really not but ok
---
Relax bro, wrap up tome 2 in your own way, tome 2 is getting reworked so by the time you get  there it should be less work
---
Crap, auto correct got me with the capital, I did misspell grammar though
---
Again how do games "literally go faster" when the other 3 are just as free to rush gens in both our scenarios with the ONLY difference being I advocate using your brain to get more out of each pallet when the safe loops are there.  Literally the only difference between both scenarios is I'm not wasting pallets and thus eating up more time while my 3 teamates continue repairing the gens.  Do you understand my disbelief and why I question your claim that somehow immediately tossing pallets equals faster gen repairs?  Gen repair speed is identical in both scenarios the only difference is I'm not going to throw the game later with my strategy if the killer turns out to be good and can make a comeback.  Pallets should be used when they are needed, not sat at and camped.
---
You're welcome mate
---
mine is Tico#8949
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight
---
For killers its literally cruches because without them you're handicapped
---
Awesome though lol
---
Sounds like you just need to get used to the swing of Killer :D I am no master, but I have been playing this game since day one and having a fabulous time with it.
---
Keep in mind that as this is an asymmetrical game, the Killer has 4 enemies while the survivors all only have 1, that means you have a lot more to juggle and balance as killer and to be honest, you simply won't always keep all those plates spinning perfectly ;) Sometimes you're gonna lose! Sometimes horribly! But that's OK as long as you are able to take those losses in stride and still have a good time.
---
Keeping pressure on generators is essential. If the survivors are on top of gens, then they can really bang through them quickly if you leave them alone for too long. 
---
Sometimes you can set up a "3-gen" which is where you find three generators that are close to one another to protect most. When the survivors have 1 generator left to do, there will only be 3 generators left on the map total and if you are in control of those gens, you'll have them pretty well trapped. This is never a surefire bet, but it's a sensible strategy to keep in the ol' brain bank while you play.
---
If you are a killer with great mobility or map presence like Hillbilly, then be sure to use that mobility to zip around to generators and whack survivors off them! Again, if you simply focus on chasing one person for a long time, you are allowing everyone else in the game to do generators unchallenged. 
---
Know when to give up a chase! You won't catch every single survivor you find, and sometimes abandoning a chase is the smarter play. Maybe they are too quick, their moves are too good, they're in a tough looping spot, whatever - you are not required to chase everyone you find all the way to completion. If a chase is taking too long and you don't see yourself catching them in a reasonable timeframe, fuck off and find someone else. 
---
As already mentioned, you can always make use of perks to help with generator pressure as well! 
---
I encourage you to keep playing with a mind open to learning and figuring out how to play better and better :) You might want to check out a few tips &amp; tricks style videos, but ultimately your gameplay will improve most with practice! Also, don't disconnect just 'cause the game didn't go how you want, that's silly ;P You don't get points if you DC! 
---
I really hope you have a great time with future games, and I hope that this advice has been helpful at all!
---
If someone says "sweaty" what they are really saying is "wanted to win"
---
It's just annoying to deal with.
---
&gt; "Good survivors toss pallets immediately"
---
Most of my teammates must be good survivors then
---
Trapdettes all day
---
I will say this once, and say it again. Fnaf does not fit.
---
What would the map be? a chucky cheese?
---
Who would the survivor be? 
---
FNAF is not relevant anymore, its been done to death and sure its cool ig, but it lost its flare back when the 2nd game came out. 
---
Also the power you suggested would legit just be legions moonwalking exploit 2. it would force survivors to gain "panic"
---
amazing cosplay but damn is that shot gun tiny lol
---
What you’re going to find, OP, is that people are going to just whine that people who don’t like him are survivor mains who don’t like the truth or something. He has primed his army of neckbeard losers to say that.
---
Bought this a week ago....wish I waited now.
---
Yes he’s very enjoyable, a good guy, positive, and an amazing killer
---
Survivors who know if they wear default dwight outfit they will get special treatment. 
---
Killers are are to nice
---
This would result in Foreverer Freddy.
---
"Okay game's over, it was good but we're playing Spirit so we didn't stand a chance anyway.,"
---
Big oof my dude
---
Lol she’s like the second weakest killer in the game
---
I agree! In addition, if you have OBS or another way to record your gameplay, it can be helpful to re-watch your own games to identify where you could have played differently and inform your future games.
---
Im not talking solo survivor here and I didn’t even mention perks. You hook someone and then they can do a gen freely for 60 seconds with DS. You take the DS and lose time. You leave me go I do a gen. 
---
You have to hook survivors so you will be eating DS all game as well.
---
It's a little larger looking in person (weird angle in the photo) but it's specifically based off of the Evil Dead 2 boomstick, which has a pretty damn short barrel
---
I find the grinding ones are fine they just need to raise the points up. Seems stupid to have to get 25 hook saves for a measly 3 rift fragments. Some of the challenges in one match are pretty brutal unless your really lucky. I’m also not a fan of the ones that require you play a specific way. I don’t want to be a basement dweller but would have no choice thanks to a challenge that requires hooking in the basement. It shouldn’t be challenges that force you to play a certain style, should be more focused on maybe perk challenges instead. Will be curious what kind of changes they make.
---
huh?
---
The hand is the icing on the cake
---
Clowns or legions. I know people say legion suck but if you play him right he can be really good but that honestly goes for every character. Legion and clown are both really fun to play killers at least I believe and they both have some decent perks.
---
Sure, I’ll play with my team and do the tactic that allows us a 80% 4 man survival rate.
---
Why would an oni run thana?
---
He’s totally right to do that. There are certain survivors who are boring as shit. It’s fine to dodge boring as shit people, especially if you’re a content creator
---
Who wants to play against people who do a gen until the first second they hear a terror radius then urban evade away until the killer leaves so they can come back and resume the gen until the killer comes back and just urban evade away again?
---
&gt;Lmao that's why he's never left the top 3 best Killers since LAUNCH, despite being a vanilla character.
---
Why did you delete your previous reply and replied again? You continue to look just as fool.
---
What is so difficult about them? They should definitely increase in difficulty with each tome, we have til Dec 18th for the next one. Do you really think you can't finish them, or is it just the impatience to get it all done ASAP? It's just sad to think people think these challenges are nearly impossible. Saving 2 people during endgame is fairly common and not outlandish. The only one I know I'll have difficulty with is in tome 4, the 2 flashlight saves in 1 match. Other than that it's all just pretty regular shit you do every game anyways. I can't see what's so hard about tome 3. I can only sum up it's people's impatience.
---
Gotta give them props for this- they coulda just ignored the problem entirely and we woulda continued on with the challenges anyway (albeit a bit grumpy about it)- but no, they’re changing shit.
---

nice i haven't seen the movies i only know him from dbd still tho amazing cosplay that hand and the puppet look top notch
---
Saw that live. Priceless.
---
Was on the gane
---
There's a lot of dickheads on this game. But that's why I strive to be as friendly as I can. No matter what. I literally got SWF teabagged flashlight etc earlier. Just said ggwp you guys play well together and moved on. I wouldn't do it to somebody but if some people want to that's their choice.
---
At the end of the day. If you paid for this game, you can play it however the fuck you want.
---
Thanks, I’ve actually been trying to find the name of the artist that makes these
---
Basically just be really good. I realize that is vague but each category has different criterion. Basically just break a lot of pallets/gens. Chase and hit a lot of people and sacrifice all 4 if possible. That will give you your best outcome. You can also read what each badge requires at the end of each game if you just hover over it.
---
I hate all his clickbait titles and thumbnails.
---
Ugh i started to hate that word because of him, O P T I M A L
---
They most certainly aren't free to repair for 60 seconds.  If you got a D Strike user trying to cheese you like that you don't pull off the gen you simply lunge and slug their dumbass.  This pulls one teamate minimum off gen repairs to have to pick them up creating pressure while you chase your next down.
---
He gets a huge boost for injuring people right? It’s half his charges, thana would push survivors to heal and punish them further for not doing so. Either eat the penalty or potentially give oni more dash
---
This subreddit is absolutely not mostly killer mains. Please back up that assertion
---
I am the last survivor, he asks me to jump into his traps, then asks me to stun with pallets, then hooks me at the end
---
Seriously if someone helped me with my trap challenge I would thank them not kill thwm
---
Originally it was a meme about being nice to new players during the demoskagin release
---
But now survs have learned that if they wear the default dwight outfit killers will go easy on them because killers are push overs
---
Surv wears default outfit = special treatment
---
Surv drops item and crouches = usually let out for free
---
And bunch of dumb stuff like that
---
didn't plague go to school with mosses
---
Look whos shittin in the tall grass!
---
Huntresses will finally get maybe one kill from irid head
---
Me and my little brother waiting for my older brother to get off the xbox so we can play Minecraft
---
We forgive you.
---
It’s why I pointed it out.
---
When no mither says fully recover from the dying state what does that mean? Like adrenaline?
---
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in your killer matches because it sounds like you make serious mistakes if you honestly think it's that easy for survivors to survive against you.  There are major holes in your game that need plunging if you feel this powerless against them.
---
What a fun concept! Man, I would LOVE the Overlook as a map. Gimme that hedge maze!! ;P
---
I always get stupid survivors who don't get i need them to step in trap
---
The blind while carrying one is pretty rare. I can count the times I've dropped a survivor due to flashlights on one hand and I've played for 1.5k hours.
---
60 plus games just to finish 1/4th of a season pass is absurd. I know most other games are even worse, but that doesn't change my point at all.
---
Sure, because teleporting to a gen gives you a free hit. It’s not like there’s a big indication for a survivor to run to a pallet or anything. And if you hook us we have DS, borrowed, ect. Good luck doing everything when gens are done in 80 seconds. We can make you eat pallets all day, you’ll hook us sure, but we’ll still win.
---
So is balanced landing bad now or..?
---
A cooldown would honestly be fine.
---
Yea well I don’t have a lot of gaming time to play with sub optimal teammates
---
Nice 2 year old reposted meme
---
Lmao anyone remember when that happened to No0b?
---
Monstrous Shrine = S Tier
---
That doesn’t even get close to giving you the same level of control as pc players at all
---
And the existence of like 3 people who do well does not change that lmao
---
And make it work with over charge and pop
---
Let me put it this way, instadown and instaheal are two sides of the same coin
---
Usually someone being sweaty isn’t necessarily just getting a 4k, but when you tunnel people off the hook or play in a way that makes other people unable to play the game then it becomes an issue. Don’t automatically give people mercy or anything but if someone gets unhooked, go for the guy that unhooked them.
---
It moves too!

I don't really care about keys. They did gens to get towards their goal of opening the hatch so they deserve it.
---
You can’t “master her” because the hardware limitations do not allow it
---
It's so accurate, it's perfect.
---
This, to be honest I can’t stand seeing all of the bitching on this sub about keys lmao. Yea they are sort of annoying and the mechanics of the hatch are dumb but it is what it is. I definitely do not think that a key = a free win like every salty killer on this sub. Even though on average killers get 2-3 kills every game at red ranks they still have to find something to bitch about if they don’t get a 4K 💀
---
Oh ok it wasn’t me.  I had a game like this and they helped me do my trap challenge but I had this daily get a 4K. I let them farm and we got my challenge done but they started to mess with me a bunch. I messaged them before the game asking if we can farm and stuff and they message me fuck you. So I remembered my daily that I had and I was like “I’m done being nice”  and I decided to get some extra blood points.
---
Sure thing! Just gotta do Wendy and The Overlook. Been having the most fun with the music, haven’t made any of my own but mostly just described how it would sound with links to the actual music. The first 6 seconds of the shining main theme would play for when you load into the overlook (like haddonfield) and his menu music would be a mix between the default killer theme and the Doctor Sleep remix 
---
Also I called him The Maniac instead since there is another deranged killer who’s in a movie of the same name with The Psycho ;)
---
where are these pushover killers when i play?!
---
You should check the movies (or at least the show) out! Haven't met a single person who's tried watching the series who hasn't liked it. You'd have a ball!
---
Why did you change it from 40 to 60? 60 still isnt even a lot. That's only 6 games over 10 days, we have like 3 weeks. Why the rush?
---
I'm glad the changes are coming but after the backlash from the leaks, I felt like if they really cared, they would've adjusted them earlier and this was just for some easy goodwill amongst the community. That's the cynic in me. 
---
The optimist thinks it was just an honest mistake and I'm happy it is changed so fast! Either way, I'm glad it's changed.
---
Freddy is not borderline OP because he still has to follow pallet mechanics. 
---
If you manage to get a person, cool, they’ll have DS. Which means a free minute of doing a gen or the killer eating the stun. Do you know how strong this stuff is with coordination? I can last 30 seconds in a chase and all gens can still be done.
---
Are we gonna be here... all day?
---
But you just explained why she isn’t super strong after saying you think she may be
---
Way to strong
---
I always do that, except when the killer's camping.
---
When you're downed you can recover and get yourself up.
---
The survivor challenge in rift 3 that says escape through the exit gate while using the perk Hope also completes if you escape through the hatch.
---
The killer challenge in rift 2 to sacrifice 13 survivors counts up if you are PLAYING SURVIVOR. Your teammates getting sacrificed counts towards your own sacrifice count.
---
I guess, but people will want to heal quickly anyways, so I really don't think it'll make a significant difference.
---
still, the game is cool and was revolutinary when it got released, but apart for being a dead game with no content and no one talks about it, is just doesnt fit in DBD.
---
Welcome to the kill count where we tell you all the victims from our favourite horror movies
---
Is that why when I go to certain areas theres just a mass amount of blood, was it just the survivors teabagging?
---
Only sith deal in absolutes
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGOaX8poTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEGOaX8poTE) There you go
---
I nearly pissed myself laughing at this
---
Riddle me this....if someone is running JUST noed, can you tell by the amount of totem spawns?
---
You realize hooking survivors is your objective too, right? How are you going to win if you don’t commit to chases
---
What? That doesn't sound like an argument to me. Billy main salt.
---
It's an auric cell discount only? So on ps4 are the discounted characters still only $5? Like pig for instance?
---
Oh god the first few seconds of [this](https://youtu.be/g_nsZ8yt1KA) being played at the start of the match would be terrifying.
---
Ah ok. Me and others seem to think so. Its like she is making a fish face imo
---
When tome 3 comes put but your not done with tome one
---
I feel like it started in call of duty. Noticed people started saying it in rainbow six earlier this year.
---
Basically it you’re playing to win, you’re sweaty.
---
[also, this](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2019/11/06/trying-hard)
---
I wish the  fucking Devs would get off their ass and do something about mass DC's that have been happening well on 6 months now. Shit is worse then fucking ever. Playing 5 hours today.. not 1 single fucking game with out at least 1 DC most of the time it's 2. 
---
Nice to take a month or so off to come back and find not only is shit not fixed but that it's worse then ever.. But hey.. at least there's a bunch of shitty ports nobody asked for and more DLC to buy. Honestly probably just time to move on.. 3 years and shit is just fucking awful with no fix in sight.. unless it is going to make them a quick buck they have 0 fucking interest in handling it. This shit should just die. 10 minute killer queue times.. and survivor games where honestly they should just make not DCing a fucking daily or Rift challenge.
---
Yeah but Spirit cute af, so...?
---
Hm I would think so. Hadn't thought about that.
---
I play creatively. I choose Killers who interest and fascinate me, dress them up in cosmetics that evoke a theme or that I find particularly frightening, and select perks that further tell a unique story. I playtest my Killers to see how they each play individually and how to best synergize their perks. (The same for survivors -- I create characters builds that revolve around stories and themes, then challenge myself to get them out alive). Then, when I'm playing them, I like to see how they interact with the others, such as athletic Megs, altruistic Dwights, cutthroat Mins, etc.
---
The theme thing for me is fun because I focus less on technical standards of winning (though I do love a 4k) and more on whether I was able to achieve a particular mood or see a certain story play out. The imaginative potential of DbD is so great, on top of just all around being a fun, adrenaline filled game of freeze tag.
---
I really like the social element of DbD: making characters and putting them through survival situations together, building trust, working together, building and breaking hope. I love the tension and the small moments where just one perfect hiding spot (or perfectly aimed hatchet) is the difference between life and death.
---
Even though the technical gameplay is fun (completing gens, getting the unhooks, pallet stunning), to me the game really blossoms when it all comes together to create epic, tense and horrifying moments between characters. Those are the trials I stay for and hope to make
---
Oh he ded
---
Do you even know what SWF is?
---
They just sent out a tweet saying they were gonna adjust the difficulty of the time level 3 and 4 soon, so it could be changed to something easier
---
I have a full time job, 60 is already absurd. I have 2 days a week I can mabye play. 
---
I changed it because I brain farted and put 40 down thinking that's about what it was, when in actually its 60 or more. 40 or less is the goal to me, and even then tbh it should be less.
---
Comparing chainsaw sizes for Laurie Chode
---
I used to watch him all the time before i got the game for myself. Over a year later and he seems painfully average compared to many of the other players I've seen. Most of the time he messes up nowadays i think, "why would you do that"? He constantly clickbaits his videos and blames the game for his obvious mistakes.
---
It's a disruption to the regular flow of the game that's heavily based on RNG. It's not really something that's heavily unbalanced, just jarring when it happens. I feel it's more of an emotional response to the effect of "I would have won except for X bullshit" than anything else.
---
It does sound like that. I can't explain it how I want I can't find the words
---
GF:Yo, you want a piece of this?
---
MM:No
---
Come on, I figured you for a freak. 
---
That's my sister
---
-_-
---
I guess if you have no life and all you do is play DBD maybe
---
Oh so like unbreakable?
---
TBH I find keys more annoying when I'm playing survivor solo than while playing killer.
---
The Entitled key urban evasioners just creep around doing absolutely nothing until they have their chance to escape.
---
We all run unbreakable for this reason. It doesn’t pull a team mate off the gen. You seem to be getting confused here. I’m not talking casual play. I’m talking sweaty matches.
---
Well you are a killer, you are supposed to kill
---
So do I, I have a 50-60hr work week. A lot of people have full time jobs, that's why they gave us soooo much time to get them done, these aren't weekly.
---
Fucking finally im not the only person who thinks this. I replied to somebody on twitter about him and he shows up and says "what have i ever said that i wasnt able to back up?" and some other stuff along the lines of that and he blocked me before i can even reply.
---
He's good at the game but his opinions are fundamentally wrong and he doesnt even invite discussion. He's brainwashed his followers into constantly spamming "hurr durr survivor op".
---
So pretty
---
Yes teabagging is bs that deserves tunn5not looping or flashlight blinding that's just trying to survive teabagging is for tiny dick people
---
She’s so OP though
---
&gt;positive
---
you are out of your fucking mind
---
You literally do not need to play smart to win. If I had to play smart to win I would but the state of game means you literally don’t have to play smart. Survivor side isn’t really about skill, it’s more about team and map knowledge.
---
You have no counterpoint but to just say pallets “should” be used a certain way. I am a survivor main with 3k hours and I used to play that way. It’s a real eye opener when you can play like a rank 20 and beat the best killers.
---
the counter would to be just throw the pallets down early so the killer doesnt get stunned, making it so the killer has 3  perks that dont do anything
---
Lmao as if it is so time consuming.
---
I’m a killer main and if I can beat rank 1s I should be fine. I will just use my characters that I’m really good.
---
Oh boy, another tru3talent hate train incoming.
---
Yes but the whole point of perks is that you’re limited to how you play. Letting killers run around with an extra perk defeats the whole purpose of only having 4, because that could allow for way too much perk build diversity and frankly it would make the killers op in most cases
---
me and my boy watching the forks spark in the microwave
---
no, Plague works a little differently. Crouching and walking are the ONLY actions that don't increase your infection. Like you don't gain infection at all. Running repairing, vaulting, looting chests, totems, healing, etc. all make your infection go up.
---
People who use moris dgaf about bloodpoints.  Survivors can just die of first hook or use a DC to leave the match already to avoid wasting their time.  A good change would be to require hooking each survivor once before they can start moriing people.
---
See, if the totem spawns with his hand open, THEN you know. If it's closed, you're safe. Easy.
---
I’d smash
---
Keys should be deleted altogether, or at least require all gens to be done.
---
Ah yes because let’s make all killer suck so survivors can be idiots all game and not try
---
Maybe make it whatever they remove from tome 3, so 2 EGC unhooks for tome 4 and just 1 for 3?
---
It's a YouTube series from Buzzfeed called Unsolved
---
I'm not even done with tome 1
---
Most likely it is an emotional impulse but to this degree is strange. Especially on something so unlikely to even happen
---
Buzzfeed Unsolved
---
Depression&amp;Anxiety
---
what did they do this time?
---
What if it was based on rarity? Perks should be changed because it's kind of dumb how their rarity changes based on minute changes in their numbers. If they could rebalance perk rarity, I think it would be fair to give killers a free yellow rarity perk on top of another 3.
---
Your right. Forgot they changed that. Prove thyself would be the one to want
---
I just threw on borrowed time, dead hard, and WGLF and threw myself fearlessly at my hooked teammates.  Usually meant taking a hit, unhook, dead hard through the next swing and they will hit my teammate with Endurance.
---
his power is injured based, people are going to run Thana sloppy on him. its going to force people to waste a lot of time healing.
---
They made the timing so hard. Someone tries to flashlight save almost every game against me and it’s only worked once. Getting that challenge would take a lot of time and effort.
---
But I work midnights........press F. 😭
---
I very much doubt you can do all the higher tier challenges within 3 weeks working a full time schedule while trying to fit other hobbies in your life. DBD is the game I play 65% of the time at least, and the fact I can barley keep up is absurd.
---
Lol for me I just can't take you seriously because you're painting the picture of these "immune" survivors that are incapable of being downed.  They can just mindlessly without any thought or skill run and toss pallets and automatically win.  I've been playing for years and our killer games have never felt easier than they do right now after a year and a half of balance updates to decheese survivor.  For me it just makes me ask what more do you need personally for you to finally take responsibility for the outcome of your matches?  What more could they possibly nerf on them for you to finally own the outcome of your games?
---
I give you that, he’s very good at what he does and he’s enjoyable to watch at times. But you have to admit that he does place blame where it isn’t due sometimes.
---
Yeah. Same here. 
---
After I got it though I pallet stunned the killer multiple times.
---
How do I delete someone else's post?
---
It's fair imo because killers only get 3 since ruin should be a given
---
After the NOED archive challenge I had to apologize to the 2 survivors I sacrificed. I blamed Behaviour.
---
I was using BT and DH with WGLF too but with everyone trying to complete the challenge I couldn’t get the u hooks because everyone would swarm the hook
---
Lets be honest, we all like idea one more. I think there might be a better way to go about it, mostly because what the devs might consider really good or just underused is pretty different to what pro and babies might think is bad or good.
---
Generally speaking, in theory it sounds like a good idea, maybe a better change would be to make perks feel less like a glass canon, thats why the better perks are ones that work without you really needing to do anything, ruin, bbq, noed, franklins. Otherwise, i feel like killers can be buffed via making perks feel like theyre apart of your kit, like play with your food being more of a chore list and less of a advantage.
---
But im green rank garbo and I main survivor. So i cant say much
---
What’s listed here was what the challenges were during the test build a few weeks before official release. I put it together for those that didn’t have access at the time as the PTB was only on PC and people, like myself, only play on PS4 or other consoles. So I put this together for people to get an idea of what we could expect when the official release happened. Now that it’s widely available there really isn’t a reason to post updated challenges as everyone can see them now. Also the challenges are going to get changed again so even if I did post the updated ones they won’t be accurate till the change happens.
---
I bought legion at 10 pm yesterday
---
Jokes on you I use M4 for for skill check. Itching is an anytime activity.
---
Exactly! It has to be a must, I really want them to take full advantage of the soundtrack if they do a shining chapter like they did for Michael. I really wish they did more for Bubba, but the Demagorgon was perfect. I also wanna do some unique things to The Overlook to make it different. Like the typewriter on the desk constantly typing, the two girls in the hallway occasionally appearing (though this could be a bit much, it’s just an idea) and something with the ballroom and bar as well. A generator in room 237 is a must
---
No, no, no. Billy would be "Depression and Anxiety" and Leatherface would be "Being a dumbass" and Laurie would be "Me"
---
Hahah true and then they bail and leave you on the hook lol
---
Here let me save you the hassle. I can just block you!
---
Killers have 6 perks, your 4. your power, and bloodlust.
---
You cant buff all killers. buffing every killer would be literally the worst idea ever. you cant honestly think billy, nurse, freddy, spirit, and oni need more then 4 perks.
---
If you have no perks for gen slow down, don’t apply enough map pressure and commit to a chase too long, you will lose gens. Just take it as a learning experience and see how you can play differently. Make sure you don’t forget to go in Night Shroud after it’s cool down to mind game survivors. Good luck in the future. :)
---
Why does Meg have an Adams Apple?
---
I will "bitch" if I lost not because I played poorly or was simply worse than survivors, but because I lost as survivors got deus ex machina.
---
Thanks! Doesn't get me my 43 seconds back but it will work.
---
A survivor can't burn an offering to skip 66% of their objective
---
Another week, another "ha ha lets pick on Tru" meme. We get it, you don't like him. Move the fuck on.
---
Why would you even waste time typing this out lol?  What are you hoping to accomplish I'm genuinely curious?  Of course I know what a swf is.  I know what they are and what they aren't.  And they aren't infallible.  They aren't invincible contrary to what you and others on this sub might say.  If they are someone never sent me the memo because I've beaten countless sweat squads over the years.  I must be using hacks or have a sweet gaming chair I guess.
---
START TUNNELING AGAIN
---
You're one of the good ones.
---
I thought about the girls appearing like the doctor, but as you said it might be a bit much, and you could get an achievement for repairing the gen in room 237 and escaping as an addition to the series of achievements in that vein
---
I wish I could tell you that Laurie fought the good fight, and the Sisters let her be. I wish I could tell you that, but the Fog is no fairy-tale world.
---
*For a good time*
---
I rushed to the end of 2, but didn’t 100% it, and now I’m rushing to the end of 3 before I grind out 2 and 3
---
Empathy as well, be there before the person even goes down lol
---
Remember when unrelenting was good
---
&gt; you are out of your fucking mind 
---
lmao
---
he is annoying, but hexy is much much worse. People should hate hexy much more. his fans are so fucking annoying, and he literally reports billys he plays against. he reports them for playing billy.
---
He is a shit player and a shitty person.
---
Unbreakable is not an assumption on EVERY survivor that is completely false.  There are a variety of meta perks that regularly claim that 4th spot in place of Unbreakable.
---
Yeah I hate having to work at challenges, damn.
---
Missing the legion mask
---
Sorry I can’t get you those back. Here’s a great idea: get a life! Based on your comment history, it’s obvious you need one! Have a great day fellow redditor!
---
It's not that bad, of course won't allow anymore to keep the killer busy for minutes without wasting pallets, but it is still a decent perk in my opinion
---
They are introducing a matchmaking penalty which I believe increases with every consecutive dc
---
Yeah sry to say he’s right.  Nurse can be fun on console but not nearly as good as on pc.  Same goes for huntress and billy.  (Some may disagree with billy.)
---
Probably survivors crouch walking slowly. 
---
5 steps running vs 10 steps walking slowly to make the same distance would be the best way to explain it.
---
I want sooooo bad
---
r/deadbydaylight says Ruin, SWF, Decisive Strike, I just want to grill for God's sake!
---
Thought you were going to block me not stalk me. What's with people now days? You mad that nobody likes your boring rank 20 video of nothing. Here I'll save you the trouble.
---
Working on gens to spawn the hatch so they can use the key they brought is not "deus ex machina", it's fucking tactics. It's what they planned on doing before they even got into the match. Deus ex machina would be the key falling from the sky and into their hands while the hatch appeared directly in front of them while they were being chased by you.
---
I'm not sure you can really "try" Nurse - you kind of need to put the time in to making her work in order to judge how you feel about her. Your first half-dozen games are likely to be constant whiffs, at least until you get some Spasmodic Breath or Matchbox add-ons so you can make some attempt at applying pressure between lucky hits.
---
Nurse is as powerful on console as she is on PC - your main stumbling block is controller sensitivity being weaker than mouse sensitivity (this is common to ***both*** PC and console - it's been tested), with a potential (doesn't seem to happen as much anymore) secondary effect from frame rate issues.
---
The former can be adjusted for (avoid trying to do 180s while Blinking) while the devs work on improving the issue (announced fairly recently), the latter is just bad luck. Bear in mind that Nurse can end chases *fast*, so if a frame drop kills one Blink then all it's done is just add a second or two to the chase - it's not like whiffing with a regular killer, survivors can't outrun her Blink.
---
She is very, very different to Shape and Pig, although you may feel some similarity to Hag depending on your playstyle. If you're the kind of Hag that constantly moves between Traps then you've got an idea of how your Nurse games are going to go. She fast travels, she makes a decision on whether or not there's a survivor nearby, she goes for a hit or she moves on. She has a cripplingly slow foot speed, harsher than Hag's, so she'll be using both information perks and slowdown perks to buy time to sniff out a survivor.
---
My personal advice is to rack up some Plaid Flannels (these give a visual indicator for aiming and charging a Blink), a good set of perks (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfnmZvK4l88) or either of [Otzdarva's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_yixIT0p58) perk [guides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFF0iMH9oTU), and get ready for probably the worst games of your life since you got out of random ranks. Don't rely on additional Blinks - always aim to make your first Blink the one that hits, and don't try for a hit if you're not 100% convinced it'll land.
---
When it clicks, it clicks, and everything after that is gravy. At that point you can decide whether you want to keep on with her, or just use her sporadically when you feel you need the extra help.
---
*Good* console Nurses are thin on the ground, but they're brutal [when you finally get to meet one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXZcJbiF2xk) (note that is from the Bad Old Days for PS4). If you find her too difficult then consider learning Spirit - almost as powerful but ***far*** easier to learn.
---
Good luck!
---
I mean, did you not have attitude towards game developers that are doing something nice?
---
Is your reddit similar to your gamer tag? Pretty sure I have a friend request with a GG message from you haha
---
That’s why they watch streamers and have fog whisperers. Plus if something’s too strong they can take it out.
---
You aren’t beating a team that does gens in 5 minutes. It’s nice that you never encountered this but in Euro this is meta.
---
SWF is stronger than any killer currently and I really doubt you’ve beaten countless sweat squads because that means they messed up and killer can really only capitalize on survivors mistakes. True sweats playing in a squad really don’t lose and it’s fact. Like, have you ever heard of the depip squad? Chances are you wouldn’t stand a chance despite your massive skill.
---
No idea why you're downvoted. You had a good in depth explanation with mathematical proof that its possible.
---
If you buy the characters you don't get the extra outfits, do you?
---
Interesting tactic of calling a streamer toxic by using a public space to slander him. FYI he was maliciously stream  sniped
---
You cannot play like a rank 20 and beat the "best" killers.  Terrible or mediocre killers sure.  But good killers will destroy you wasting pallets like that.  I triple dog dare survivors in my killer games to waste pallets against me.  See how well that works out for you guys lol.  That's literally a killers wet dream.  Some of the most free wins I've ever had.
---
Yep but there’s unlike unbreakable you can do it more than once.
---
Must be done in 1 trial
---
Like when 3 people escape through the hatch when 4 gens are done and one died
---
It's bs and make the killer depip because you pressed one button to escape. I don't see your point.. especially when I see more keys than Moris overall
---
Yeah, the OP needs to move the fuck on. I suspect he can't, though, because he has nowhere to move on to. People with empty lives have to fixate on something or else they implode, and I suspect the same is true of the OP.
---
Hey if I switch challenges in the time will I lose the progress on the one I have selected already
---
If you want good perks, get the Clown for Pop Goes the Weasel and Bamboozle. Freddy, Spirit and Plague also have decent perks.
---
I would personally go for The Doctor. He's fun to play as, easy to get use to, and great for getting a lot of bloodpoints.
---
If you look at all the posts in the last hour not counting memes or shitposts, the majority are killer mains or killer posts. I’m not gonna go count them all but this subreddit is most definitely mainly killers.
---
I 100% NEVER thought I would be telling anyone in a game to GIT GUT SCRUB but I am feeling those git gud vibes a lot lately &gt;:(
---
I understand what you're saying, but I'm pretty sure that you're not quite understanding how the perk works. Lightweight just makes the scratch marks disappear faster, not make them smaller or harder to see (I tested this with Fixated just in case), they just disappear so fast that they give the impression that they are smaller than normal
---
I mean i agree that he certainly complains too much but the game is pretty survivor sided at high ranks.
---
Using this logic, survivors being able to vault windows and throw pallets are perks
---
I don't use it because it sucks. Game is either over before it activates and it might not even activate. I'd rather have a perk I know I can use.
---
I’ve somehow gotten 1 before
---
The timing itself is the easy part. The hard part is being in position, avoiding fake outs, having no walls around, and not throwing the game while you're at it.
---
I got banned twice for sending them a meme picture of the doctor saying "gitgud" with his beautiful smile
---
Just block everything, also friend requests. Isn't worth it, they wanna shit talk you but if you reply by any means (even sarcastically) they report you like lil bitches
---
If all of your points are going into Dweet, doesn't that mean he is no longer baby? 🤔
---
well I wouldn't bother coming back unless you enjoy 10 minute killer times and constant IMBA games from your teammates DCing because they know they can do so with impunity because BE refuses to implement any sort of punishment for it. The state of the game is seriously shit tier.. unless your goal is to just buy stuff because they keep cranking that shit out for ya.
---
Any killer that follows any rules
---
Bricky the only killer I've seen that openly says dont abide by any imaginary rules
---
The models.
---
*whispers in your right ear* Just let it gooo (?
---
 I honestly can’t tell if this guy is being serious or trolling anymore. If you think key is a free win you are honestly brain dead.
---
Definitely.
---
I based Jack’s ability in my concept as more of an aggressive doc. When he finds a survivor in lockers, he breaks the locker permanently and grabs the survivor. His ability is whenever a survivor enters his terror radius they are inflicted with The Shine. When they have The Shine a ghost or spirit of any survivor appear. They can work on gens with survivors and make the progress bar vanish and drop fake pallets and fast vault windows to alert Jack. When they leave his terror radius it takes around 30 seconds to lose it. If they lose it then it takes another 30 seconds for them to be able to gain the status effect. He also has an active ability that’s similar to yours where he rushes them down. He can fast vault windows, break pallets faster and has a larger lunge range as well as an increased terror radius. Cooldown of 20 seconds, duration of 10
---
(I have ad ons that make him give the mangled effect during this mode)
---
This community has gotten very toxic, sadly, and it's full of bullies like the OP who have a hate-boner for Tru3. It actually wouldn't surprise me if the OP turned out to be the guy who has been sniping Tru3.....
---
Prepare for trouble...
---
Imagine it on The Nurse... That would be one evil killer.
---
And make it double
---
Take your son to work day.
---
I’m 40 games in and still have not been given the chance to do this.... it’s not even fair
---
THE GAME IS STARTING TO FEEL A LITTLE TOO REPETITIVE
---
If the survivors finished x amount of gens and then had the time to find the hatch, open it, and escape. Yea that means you got outplayed. They’re just better than you
---
Get off my Swamp!
---
On PS4 killer matches are nearly instant but survivor takes forever. 
---
For me at least.
---
It’s new to the platform and was on bestselling so MANY people play the game. But the time does go up when you rank up like at red ranks it’s like 3 minutes for survivor and like 7 for killer
---
You just ignore the shitty perk?
---
Wow, seriously, you’ve gone into way more effort than me, I absolutely love the fact that you’ve introduced the shine, and breaking lockers is such a cool feature. Seriously good job
---
You aren’t getting kills in a 5 minute game with multiple survivors running DS. So what, killers should just play to kill and not rank up? Then just bring a mori every match so they can kill.
---
I have absolutely faced sweat squads before.  This isn't unique to Europe bro. 
---
The difference between me and you is I improved month after month because I own the results of my matches instead of deflecting blame to "unbeatable opponents" which is pure fantasy.  You'll never win your killer games consistently because you enter in assuming the loss.  
---
Imagine watching survivors lose everything they have over the past year and a half of solid nerfs and STILL thinking they're stupid OP free win machines against the best killers lol!  I'm sorry man but with each passing comment it is becoming more and more apparent how raw and undeveloped your personal play is.  Do they need to spawn in on hooks at this point for you to accept that you have the power to win or lose your games?  You need to stop blaming your bad play on game balance.  Watch videos man learn.  YouTube is amazing for this that's where I learned.
---
oh god i hope this is a troll post
---
I think you should still play both. As a survivor you learn new tricks when you pick killer again and the opposite is also true
---
Still, there's nothing wrong to prefer playing one over another but I think is kinda of a waste playing just 50% of the game but you so you man. It's a game, enjoy it however you want
---
Wish the sale also extended into Iri-shards rather than just Auric Cells
---
Yes.  Get all the perks except for the one you’ll never use. Then just avoid it. Helps filter through bad webs sometimes.
---
This sub is not mainly killer mains mate. I’ve seen more survivors and entitled survivors then I have killers or entitled killers.
---
I've never played FNAF, but their worldbuilding is very interesting and would be very cool to see in DbD. I could imagine Dwight or maybe even Meg getting an employee cosmetic for the pizza joint
---
The potential for cosmetics would also be pretty cool, like with Legion; we know there are multiple animatronics
---
you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
I see he made a meme... but I literally don’t see anything else about OP obsessively hating on tru3? 
---
I watched tru3 like two times and he wasn’t my thing but I don’t see how OP is being insane or having a hate boner for making a meme.
---
Now you know how survivors feel when they are being tunnelled.
---
Who T bags against a huntress with iridescent heads lol
---
Toxic
---
Or you can also get down from your high horse and see that people who complains about them, usually, are replying to people like you who only complains about moris, ignoring keys that are way more common
---
Just sayin'
---
He's not. I suspect the OP might be Tru3's stream sniper and is trying to stir things up.  It's kind of sad.
---
Wrong, my game only sometimes (about 1 out of 70) freezes when I get hitted
---
very nice 👍
---
Sure, we’ll put on a farm map offering and bring toolboxes. I’m sure you can defend against 60 second solo gens.
---
Like do you not understand it’s not a killer problem at all. It’s a problem with gen speed and comms. You can literally play you best game ever and still lose.
---
I do it all the time. I get points for closing the hatch. We both get points for chasing to the gate, and they get points for opening the gate. 
---
We all get more xp
---
Well red ranks escape rate is about 35%, what you have to say about that?
---
Thats true :/ I think it might be a bit weird to get used to, especially spies from the shadows, iron grasp or third seal (do people use those perks i havent had a game with them in a while) or perks that are considered good but underused, theres also perks that are so broken, people dont use. Theres other criteria but i think it might be deemed unfair for survivors, I guess theres totem but those are on an optional to-do list, not really required to do.
---
I think just number changes or add on buffs, heck even making totem spawns harder to find could be good. Im terrible at advice but I think its an okay idea, but changing the entire perk system would be weird. Maybe you have to be a certain rank and prestige to do so.
---
Killers can also go through windows and break pallets. So going by your logic, those are perks too.
---
The boys staring at the package of beans at 3 am
---
while that's probably true for a lot of incels, there are people out there who for various reasons are just hopeless when it comes to getting laid. Like 99% of them still end up being bitter cunts with completely warped worldviews, but I'd say at least the bitter part is understandable.
---
Its very strange in a game designed to kill survivors the side that needs to kill gets an offering ti pretty much unstantly do this. Thats just bad design...
---
Bull, and might I add, shit. I've been a rank 16 killer against rank 8 survivors. Granted it was a Wednesday night and probably a swf but still.
---
Why is ruin a "given" a lot of higher ranked killers don't even use it.
---
Yet the posts show evidence, count all the posts in the last day or even the hour not including memes that show both or neither, and you will see there are more killer posts.
---
Ive known that and that's exactly why i dont do it even though sometimes it leads to a depip. I had a nurse daily and i suck with nurse. It took 3 games to do it since i was in huge maps and only found the same people but didn't wanna chase them
---
Thank you! This means a lot. I love making these concepts. I’m converting them to docs since most of mine are on paper. I’ve done Jason, The Thing, Alien and even done a Resident Evil chapter. Surprisingly I’m having a lot of trouble with doing one for Candyman.
---
I can tell you the perks I came up with if you want
---
I really think you’re underestimating the fan base behind the series. The VR game was released, then an AR game this year. Plus a movie, novels, and two or three new games.
---
but im definitely not saying that it belongs in DbD, because it doesn’t really
---
Well firstly recompiling the shoes off of the legs would be a massive undertaking in of it’s self many man hours would have to go into making them separate, then they would have to do their best to prevent the inevitable clipping all the new combinations would cause, and they would still have to add more detail like socks and calves to many of the shoe models to ensure there aren’t any kinds of seams around the ankles, all of which would be a case by case per survivor. All this to say, a lot of work goes into making sure the cosmetics look  good as is, and the current design was chosen deliberately since the beta of this game as a compromise between efficiency and customizability.
---
I have to do 3 full gens in a single match...
---
Hiding lobbies doesn’t work in any game. Ppl always find a way. How do you think OW, Fortnite and apex streamers get sniped so much? Plenty of ppl tried hiding their lobbies and eventually just gave up.
---
Edit: not defending him, just pointing out hiding lobbies has been tried in many games and it doesn’t work.
---
Your welcome
---
After watching good huntress players like Umbra, it’s hard to watch him play as huntress lol.
---
D ë m o n ?
---
Its mostly for some perks to see some use on top of an experement. Balancing can be a slippery slope, so what if this little nudge makes it easier to buff, or negate the need to buff. Not all killers are created equally.
---
Point out in my post where I'm complaining about Mori. Maybe read the full post before replying.
---
It's not impossible, 1 hook is simple, and if a second person goes down it's your time to shine. It's just dumb that it's the 2nd required one. 
---
It's difficult but far from impossible, Would much prefer these actual challenge ones to be on the side branches.
---
Workin on it :( I wish there was an online DBD discussion community that wasn't flooded with these sorts of complaints. It's fun chatting with people about games we collectively like so I'm just slowly making the switch to not doing that anymore. It's tough &gt;.&lt;
---
Easy solution. Ebony Mori lets you kill all survivors who would be on death hook, green one lets you kill 1 Survivor when you have hooked every survivor at least once.
---
If you make keys to weak they lose all purpose.
---
I have a couple concepts for some licensed and original characters, specifically Billy from ‘Silent Night Deadly Night’, but I’d certainly love to hear about yours if you want to pm them to me
---
It is if you’re referring to me and my team’s play style. You can’t slug us, you can’t hook us, insane gen speed.. how would you win?
---
I agree with u/Nerdherder72 - I don't mind the "grind" ones, since I'm free to damage gens/pallets or make unhooks without having to make it my whole focus. Sure, it'll take a few games, but it's a 70 day Rift and things like unhooks and Basement hooks are just a part of normal gameplay. Some of the Master challenges are fine too - playing a normal game but with the addition of Spine Chill, for example.
---
My personal issue is with the Master challenges that required *everyone* in the Trial to act a certain way. The NOED one is virtually reliant on a specific build with a mobile killer, and furthermore requires that the survivors don't rage quit due to it. Likewise, the EGC rescue is reliant on the killer not standing beside their hook. Imagine the hassle when these two challenges interact? The killer has to sit beside their hooks with NOED, the two remaining survivors will likely need to find and break the NOED totem or pray that the killer will follow one of them while the other makes the unhooks. With a SWF, it could work - but with random players? The average player?
---
I feel it's important to separate the Rift from the Lore - these Master challenges are what unlocks the lore, there's no way around it. If you just want to finish the Rift then you can just play more games each day - but if you want the lore, you're stuck with the Master challenges.
---
I really welcome the changes. I've said elsewhere that I wasn't happy with the current experience, and that it discouraged me from spending on the game (I don't really do cosmetics, for me the Rift is something to tempt me after unlocking the lore), but if the changes are fair then I'd have no issues continuing to support it at full price. I just really need more lore!
---
My entire point is that the original commenter is saying something ridiculous, so I totally agree with you
---
Says truth, DoWn VoTeD. Don't even try, the sub is so survivor sided. Ever wonder why everyone likes sucking otz's dick? Because he doesn't bring up the root issues with this game. Yeah he's fun to watch and I don't fault him for anything, but it's obvious why people love him and hate tru3.
---
Iron Grasp isn’t a perk I would put there because that makes the killer much stronger. 
---
But perks like uh deer stalker etc. perks that don’t do much that if it was added in as a 5th perk it wouldn’t be bad. 
---
But I’m also very iffy on this idea as well.
---
I honestly don’t see much NOED. Way more Ruin/Pop/sloppy combos, and sloppy is way more annoying imo
---
And it’s not like survivors don’t all use the same small handful of perks too
---
Depends on the map. With ruin gone immediately and essentially none of your slow down perks coming into play, some maps have enough pallets to waste and still finish gens before you get a hook.
---
Okay count the countless times I have been on Reddit and seen mostly entitled survivors or survivors. 
---
Oh you can’t you haven’t been here long enough, you are only counting a small amount of time out of well let’s just go with 365 days.
---
ok boomer
---
There is no daily to get a 4k 🤔
---
Yeah I was just thinking about the new time that requires you to get two sacrifices with noed during end-game collapse
---
This is only right answer to questions like these.
---
I think another idea is to add more slots while also making ‘better’ perks take more slots similar to the notches and charms in Hollow Knight.
---
My kink
---
Auric cells only. Instead of 500 for a character it’s 250, not 50% off a chapter
---
Please tell me the killers you play in red ranks that have 0 map pressure since you seem to have every game last only 5 mins.
---
Who tf cares about ranking up, you get kills, or you survive. you will prob pip if you are good. but if you dont, who tf cares? what do you gain for ranking up?
---
I’m not talking just survivors here, it’s SWF that needs the nerf. Do you not understand that this is game you can play perfectly and still lose as killer? 
---
I can tell you don’t play killer as much as you say because you say killers have the power to decide games. Against SWF killers do not decide the game and there’s many things I can show you to prove this.
---
Oh yes that be awsome
---
From my experience, I seen the opposite.
---
Which is why they're weak or unused perks. Sure it will be salt city at first but after maybe a month it will be clear which perks should and should not be there, or changed to be there. Also killers are ment to be threatening, so this is a small nudge for the most part. Do you really feel that every killer is equally threatening in every match?
---
That still doesn't address the times the game randomly drops you out of a match for no reason
---
Killer: what are you running survivors? 
---
Uh deadhard, adrenaline, bt. 
---
Point is there’s meta in every fucking game and people will always play what’s meta.
