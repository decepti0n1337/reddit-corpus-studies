Ok then
---
---
---
Whining. Thats pretty meta, ngl.
---
I play like this too and I gotta say that it doens't matter how you play. Seriously, if you do this because you like it, props to you, I wish to play against you. If you do this however to seek enemy validation, just drop it. People are shit to oponents just cause they can and I highly recomend you to report them. As far as i read, the devs keep the chat log so there's nothing to worry about.

By the way, GG and keep on

I think I brought it a good luck baggy but it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal. But yeah I‚Äôve had that happen to me so many times 
---
&gt;Numerous nerfs to survivor, completely gutted DS, map changes, newest killers have strong and near unstoppable chase gameplay, addition of spirit fury
---
&gt;survivors get one perk that gives them another health state ONLY against M1 killers IF they took 3 M1 hits prior
---
&gt;I just cant play killer anymore its too stressful and unbalanced
---
Give me a break. Talk about overreaction. How come no one made these posts about Spirit Fury? Maybe because people realize its okay for both sides to have strong perks. Do you just want every perk to be iron maiden/breakdown tier so everyone just runs the same old builds every match? Not to mention Ash also released with two meme tier perks that no one will ever run unless they‚Äôre joking. 16/18 of the most recent DLC survivor perks have been trash meme tier garbage. 
---
This MoM complaining would be valid if old DS was still a thing, because you‚Äôd down the obsession, they‚Äôd DS, you‚Äôd down them again and hook them and then next time you hit them they‚Äôd MoM you. *That* would‚Äôve been obnoxious but thats because old DS was ridiculous.
---
Ash has some really nice perks but I think you got the really good ones already
---
If they honestly nerf ash after him being the one dlc that brought me back to play this cesspool game because its ash I'll just quit playing again I'd play killer but that shit is totally unfun and I got high rank with killer and then there's survivor which isnt fun unless theres somewhat of a chance to punish targeting killers which is p much the only time the perk comes useful to me when I solo. Combine it with DS it really is a fuck you to tunneling killers
---
The piss babies won't stop crying about Legion until they get their way. Simple as that. When the next killer comes out (please god let it be either Pinhead or Jason) the piss babies will still cry about Legion and shit out half-hearted shitposts for those upboats. And the comments for said shitposts will consist of:
---
"i hate Legion xd"
---
"OmG i hate legion too. I disconnect all the time!" 
---
" Everyone hates Legion. How could Behavior do this to us? We should all ragequit until they listen to us!" 
---
"Legion is fine (comment hidden)." 
---
I think a good way to fix this is to make skill check zones colored in a meter-like fashion - red to green. The closer you are to the green (currently great skillchecks) the more the gen progresses. But if you go into the orange zone (middle) it does not progress, and red it loses slight progression. Something kinda like this:  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/aWUv5iq.png](https://i.imgur.com/aWUv5iq.png)
---
(I know i know, i'm an amazing artist).
---
So green would give as much progression as great skillcheck does now, and yellow would give normal progression. Orange would give none, red would decrease normal amount, and missing would lose 'great' amount.
---
Plague has some amazing perks and is easy to play but o think you got the best ones already
---
Thank you! And ikr I was so happy when I saw it. The lady who made it did a really good job.
---
Virtually the same since you've stopped playing, minus Decisive Strike which can be swapped with Mettle of Man. Killer meta hasn't changed, it's still Ruin/BBQ/Tracking perk/Pallet perk. 
---
Please tell me you got it for Jeff Johansen. Legion isn't that good in his current state. 
---
My game freeze in the loading screen pre game. I can wait 8 minutes and it doenst load. Only happened today but I didn't play much since 2.6.3
---
Did they nerf Decisive Strike? And why Mettle of Man? (Appreciate the responses btw)
---
Don't hug the edge of the map. Be proactive, learn to run from killers and utilize pallet slams and running around in buildings. 
---
Expect to die. A lot. It can sometimes be quite pleasant.
---
DC'ing is the meta. 
---
&gt;I really want to see more aggressive, offensive-type survivors. Not just hiding and running.
---
There's other games that do that, I'd be disappointed to see this turn into Friday the 13th. No thanks.
---
Some killers are, others are fine. The lower tier killers are getting worse, but the higher tier ones are doing alright.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In terms of toxicity it really does suck, but the best thing to do is hide chat and just enjoy the matches. Go in to them to enjoy them, and not have any expectations of pipping etc.
---
They dont say anything when you mention Spirit Fury, the strongest killer perk in the game to end chases quickly that synergizes with another meta perk, Enduring. Imagine if there were posts everyday talking about how Spirit Fury is ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù because theres NO counterplay to it!! Lmao, its just as ridiculous as MoM complaints.
---
They probably dont understand that Spirit Fury is even good because they respect pallets and are deathly afraid of getting stunned.
---
That's not a reason. You don't have to play Bubba to get BBQ, just throw points at his bloodweb.
---
No just a long friendliness pellet 
---
Thats speculation. Just look at crime rate. Its not a minority. 
---
Not sure if those are ‚Äúbugs‚Äù because they are listed as ‚Äúblink strike‚Äù for nurse after a blink. 
---
I wonder if it works against phantasm attacks from the hag. 
---
As much as I respect Tru3, I agree with the way the devs handled it.
---
Its only now that I can see more of the angle they are coming from with the design of this game.
---
The more perks they add, the blurrier the line gets between the killer/survivor arms race.
---
One thing I would add would be an offering effecting distance between generators.
---
I‚Äôm kind mixed on MoM. On one hand, when bad survivors run it, they barely extend a chase and they essentially down one less perk. Instead of using a perk that would actually help them, they used a crutch perk that didn‚Äôt do anything for them. So it works against them.
---
On the other hand, if a really good survivor runs it, they can make a chase last *forever*. One decent survivor can already run a decent killer for 3 gens pretty regularly. Add MoM on top of that and it‚Äôs even worse. In the right hands MoM can be a fucking nightmare. But I don‚Äôt believe the average survivor is this good.
---
On the grand scheme of things, I think it balances out with all the shitty survivors using it against good survivors using it.
---
I‚Äôm still kind of mixed about it though, so just gonna have to continue to play against it for awhile until I get used to it.
---
It's bad for both killers and survivors since it encourages tunneling. Hit someone fresh off the hook to down them in one hit or let them heal and have it take three.
---
Celebrity MoM contrarian here: It's not really "bad" per se against the killers with kits that circumvent it, since it forces them to use it if they're concerned about MoM and takes the M1 option off the table. Even in my Billy matches where I'm rollin', I'm not chainsawing *everyone*, there's plenty of times where you want to get in a hammer swipe before they can vault a window or pallet.  
---
No one cares
---
Then there's this post that is complaining about the complaints about legion being bad posts 
---
Lol you‚Äôre trying to suggest that the bulk of the population are the ones adding to the statistics... are you‚Äôre saying IM speculating? üòÇ You just said everything I need to know now about this conversation. Try google sometime since logic doesn‚Äôt seem to be your strong suit.
---
OP got down voted because survivor mains (AKA twats) got triggered by the sight of NOED.
---
Dude your latest post got removed due to nobody caring üòÇ try again little kid üòÇ
---
He‚Äôs a legion with a teachable called Mad Grit it‚Äôs HIS(or her) perk and that‚Äôs probably the best situation to use it.
---
lmao this is worth it to get eac banned
---
It was heavily talked about before it released by some youtubers. 
---
Ive always been interested in games where you can play the villain. (Hitman (if that counts), Dungeon Keeper, Prototype) When I saw the game, I became interested and the killer that finally hooked my interest was the wraith.
---
I thought it would be a fun game to play with friends on halloween. Still haven't gotten many of my friends to actually play it but Ive enjoyed it nontheless and I keep coming back to it every few months to check out new features.
---
Its the new killers that keep bringing me back. 
---
Playing as them or against them, the killers are what keep this game fresh.
---
Then show some proof? The moment emojis come out you look like a troll who just wants to argue. The debates not worth it to me. You cant debate with someone whos immature. Goodbye. 
---
Honestly tho, Evan Peters could get it. 
---
https://giphy.com/gifs/deck-io9-observation-Q2LRWdJDq9xy8
---
Bro don't be thick, you just proved his point, they work differently but both increase the power of the player, thats how they are related
---
Survivor Offerings can override Killer Offerings. 
---
If someone burns a Coldwind Offering while you burn a L√©ry's Offering, there's just as much a chance that you'll go to Coldwind as there is you'll go to L√©ry's
---
And yes, while it's always on you to understand the potential drawbacks involved with add-ons/perks/whatever, I don't see why the Killer becomes pitiful or pathetic because of situational circumstances outside their control.
---
This is great but it won‚Äôt get as many likes as a sponge bob ‚Äúam I a joke to you ‚Äú daily meme that gets posted on here 
---
Lmao
---
Yeah that was weird, that dude [bailed on a chain we were talking in](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b9fr4v/wow_i_knew_mom_was_good_but/ek46z54/), starts ranting to another dude in the thread about me instead after I got him tilted, then calls me out directly and accuses me of avoiding *his* posts, lol. 
---
Would be nice if they did Double BP one a month at least.
---
it keeps me awake at night knowing that you could be around the corner at any moment and shout condescending redditor buzzword #15 at me when discussing a meme video game sweaty
---
This sub is getting dangerously close to a Myers fetish nsfw page.
---
But it's all good when BT, DS, DH right? RIGHT?
---
It depends on how badly they counter it.
---
The killers in the middle list are in a pretty good spot regarding it MoM, since they can get around the perk with good play but won't be able to if they get outplayed.
---
The really problematic ones are in the top list.
---
* Between her Broken status and Corrupt purge, Plague might not even need to M1 any single survivor more than three times per game.
---
* Nurse only gives stacks if she attacks *without* blinking because BHVR did a pretty good job so far.
---
* Not only does Legion's Frenzy not give stacks, Mettle can't proc off of Legion downing you with Frenzy.
---
Picks nurse whines survivors are salty
---
Right! If i see noed I kinda try to find a totem. You know. Don't leave scratch marks and be sneaky. 
---
Tbh, I don't mind going against nurses. It takes alot of skill to actually be good with her. When I get absolutely destroyed by one, it's probably warranted 
---
Welcome to the Fog!
---
Bulli made a lot of good points so I‚Äôll try not to beat a dead horse. 
---
Despite all survivors being the same other than initial perks, Meg is a great starter! I also thing Feng is great for beginners as her perks let you do gens quietly, get away distance from the killer, and keep tabs on where he is. 
---
People will tell you to get the Self-Care perk from Claudette which is nice but slow so I prefer a good ol‚Äô Med-Kit. WGLF is a perk from David that grants survivors extra BP for saving hooked friends. It is definitely advantageous to get it early as this game is a grindfest. 
---
In my opinion, the most valuable perk for new survivors is Bond, from Dwight. Honestly I used it when I started and still do to this day. It allows you to see nearby survivors. This gives you so much awareness of the game, as you can finds friends for heals, see friends getting chased so you know where the killer is, and work on gens together. Knowing when it is safe to do things and when it isn‚Äôt is huge in this game. Dwight‚Äôs other perks are quite good as well so I can‚Äôt recommend leveling him enough. (:
---
It think they should hit them with a hard ban if they are getting consistent reports. Like 10 or more. 
---
He also got out
---
A new era

they've said they're working on the startup crashes, but then in this thread - https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/52528/crashes-at-launch-access-violation-code-c0000005-first-second-chance-not-available/p7 - many people have received emails from support saying that it's a graphics card issue on our side ? what's actually happening, does anyone know ? support has taken a while to get back to us.
---
Noed with nurse
---
He‚Äôs not holding the game hostage.
---
He‚Äôs blocking 1 person for a noed kill. 
---
Yes, it sucks. 
---
*Wipes tears* It‚Äôs marvellous, I also almost can‚Äôt believe you went through the effort to catch me attention(!) ‚ò∫Ô∏è In all seriousness, kudos to the artist! Really like the remorseless, ‚Äòservant of death‚Äô feel to their wraith. 
---
Some killers act insane (Not pointing any fingers...Herman), others are almost child-like in their mental capacity but Philip as the wraith just seems...emotionless. All of it captured in one image 
---
Your thinking scrathed mirror, which is quite decent on larrys and the game, im talking about the mirror shards.
---
This is how my experience has been exactly on PS4 recently and is mainly the reason why I don't even play this game much anymore. 
---
I honestly don't doubt that I keep you awake at this point lol, I'll let you get back to your conversations about me :P
---
Awesome! Really cool idea for a cake.  
---
Glad you shared &lt;3

I'd love to switch but we can't cloud save and transfer profiles. I have a lot of doc paid that I don't want to buy again.

the sound fuckin jumpscared me oh god
---
Where is she? 
---
Edit: oh there I found her. Nice eyes
---
When does Brittney start singing Toxic? It fits DBD so well.
---
Could you imagine the plays here? It would be fucking awesome. The amount of power two killers could have to. If you coordinate it right my lord.
---
I'm really happy that you like it &lt;3
---
Ahh, good point. I didn't think about that. Even then rank 1 version of the perk is a decent boost.
---
It‚Äôs equal between Nurse, Huntress, Spirit and Hag. 
---
Camping in itself is salt, so congrats?
---
Meg: Nani?! Is... is that Deliverance?! But how Claudette? How did you get this perk?
---
Claudette: MUAHAHAHAHHAA! FOOL! Letting me open this exit gate was your last mistake.
---
New people?
---
Literally everyone runs BBQ because they cant use their eyes and ears to find survivors.
---
Yup. Did Survivors have Balanced Landing and a brain that map is hell for Killers
---
I think the perk should get a quality of life change where as soon as it‚Äôs activated, the perk counts down by three seconds, similar to how sprint burst works with it‚Äôs timer, and then has a timer that shows how long it takes to recharge. 
---
Then stop using the chainsaw so damn often lol
---
Adapt.
---
IMREALLYHAPPYYOUMADEIT
---
i am SCREAMING! Firstly, it scared me. and i cant stop laughing ommggggg lmao
---
No but we also see their point.
---
[removed]
---
You forgot Adrenaline. That perk is "totes situational and very weak. Oh, and NOED counters it because maths." To quote twats. 
---
deadass?
---
I second this. Too many of the ‚Äòaggressive‚Äô perks are simply second chance crutches, which just promotes making mistakes and getting away with it easily. Would love to see an aggressive perk that rewards quick thinking and strategy
---
listen here bub, stop pretending it only activates when you tunnel, it activates plenty of times when you dont, its not a magic "only gets used when the killer tunnels" perk
---
I understand where you coming from but I do disagree 
---
[Tall grass??](https://youtu.be/r-qZ9Qn6Csc)

"BOOSTED HACKERS HIT ME THROUGH THIS OPENING IN THE WALL LARGE ENOUGH TO JUMP THROUGH!"
---
Aye m8 I agree with that one 
---
I'd change that to Ash. For some reason, a lot of Ashes in my games tended to drop the killer on me. Doing a gen in peace? Ash comes zooming through, I hear the heartbeat and start leaving, killer latches onto me. Annoying shit.
---
We‚Äôre the party streamers bloody? 
---
that‚Äôs exactly the point of killers mate, to kill the survivors
---
Yeah, they are far and few in between. I pretty much mained him solely before Legion dropped, and I think I got him to P2. He‚Äôs a lot of fun, mainly because you can do so many builds with him. I also don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs nearly as terrible as people say he is
---
Idk, with three add-ons you could be seeing a lot more scary killer builds. Frank's and cold dirt? Why not chuck a stab wounds study or etched ruler onto that too? 
---
Add-ons already have a massive impact on most killers, giving them even more would be a mistake and I haven't even mentioned how fast gens would be done if you could run 3 add-ons on a toolbox, yikes...

[Freddy walks into Behavior studios, holding his hat in his hands]
---
‚ÄúMr. Developer, did I get my rework this patch?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou got nerfed, Fred.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh.‚Äù
---
[Freddy lowers his head and walks out]
---
I dont want a free escape but literally every other game everyone has escaped besides me and the killer has made sure just ash dies. But when I ain't playing ash and someone else does it's always the ash that gets offed
---
You think deliverance is a great perk? Mind if I ask why? I‚Äôve found the perk to be disappointing at best honestly. 
---
I barely even use that perk but that's the equivalent of saying let's target a laurie or David just because they MIGHT have a perk.
---
maybe i'm just crazy and never saw it then one day noticed it
---
Free unhook. That‚Äôs pretty strong on its own. Only real condition is if you don‚Äôt get found first. 
---
Becomes even better if you‚Äôre playing SWF. 
---
During the time I was getting the unhook achievement, I‚Äôve pulled off miraculous things with that perk. 
---
They're looking at the numbers, Mason.
---
Don't think it's unreasonable to believe that someone running a survivor less than a week after release is running that survivor's best perk.
---
PS+ freebie. Liked it enough to rebuy on PC, and have now put in an ungodly number of hours. 
---
What do they mean!?
---
MoM isnt even one of his best perks. At that its either Flip flop or buckle up for me. Mostly because I'm not the person who's aggresive and fights killer for hooks and such I'm more of the support and gen jockey person. I mean for others though I dont think they want another DS. For me MoM is eh situational at best. Depends on killer how good you are at prolonging chases etc. 
---
Depends on how long they blocked the staircase for, and DC‚Äôs aren‚Äôt reportable, we‚Äôve been specifically asked not to report DC‚Äôs. 
---
You bet yer ass.
---
Honest question.
---
Is this Photoshopped, or are they quadruplets? They all look exceptionally similar.
---
All my PS4 and Xbox killer mains say whatup

NO THANKS GO TO THE TEAM MATE WHO USED A KEY AND NOPED OUT WHILE I WAS BEING CHASED BY THE PIG. BIG THANKS GO TO THE PIG, WHO, ALSO RECOGNIZING THE HILARITY/CRUELTY OF THE SITUATION, GESTURED FOR ME TO TRY TO GET THE TRAP OFF MY HEAD. YES, THE HATCH WAS RIGHT THERE, BUT WE WENT ON A WONDERFUL ADVENTURE TOGETHER TO ALL THE JIGSAW BOXES BEFORE SADLY RETURNING TO THE HATCH TO SAY OUR GOODBYE'S. THANK YOU, MISS PIGGY, FOR BEING A BETTER TEAM MATE THAN... MY ACTUAL TEAM MATE.
---
Shhh don't let they know about the exploit
---
He's a mace salesman! Ding Dong Bing Bong! 
---
Welcome to the club fam
---
Yes
---
It combines nicely with Mettle of Man as it better ensures that you're at a full health state when the perk activates, therefore granting you 3 hits instead of 2 if you happen to be injured when the perk is active.
---
But in all seriousness, you're right. Wraith is the only killer that really seems devoid of emotion or initiative. No rage, no sadness, no fear, no immaturity, no madness, no Obsession... nothing. 
---
Damnnn Jane thicccc. Me love 
---
I think its a bug with this new patch.
---
just because she's thicc doesn't make her attractive. she looks like the ugly stepsister from Shrek
---
Had a camper do this to me. I mean trapper lol. He camped this poor survivor so we did gens and opened doors and he quits. 
---

---
Iridescent and Pinky are pink so from those three, only Beads are actually purple. And there is a big difference between purple and pink add-ons.

Good sir you have offended her honour how dare you prepare to meet the end of my blade lol she‚Äôs not even that bad üòÑ
---
So loop them?
---
Who wouldn't hes a good looking stud he can get whatever he wants. 
---
No
---
Pretty sure the Pig thing isn‚Äôt a bug. 
---
Spirit is interesting too, since she‚Äôs clearly in physical pain but if you look closely also seems conflicted and emotionally hurt too which fits with her lore, really nice touch from the devs. 
---
Gameplay-wise survivor a good trapper is fantastic, since you can genuinely feel like prey. Having to guess if he‚Äôs herding you into a certain spot, watching out for traps nearby. The impression he‚Äôs one step ahead of you. Just need to give him a pack of hunting dogs and a whistle, give the survivors a permanent fox outfit...
---
I can agree with that then, I just have trouble finding use for it in the average game. 
---
There's a lot of things to see oof
---
*Uncloaks next to a full manned gen* You guys look like you could do with a weapon..‚Äù *Quickly recloaks as Nea approaches*

actually not that often. maybe once every 5 games but other than that she's pretty uncommon in the lobbies i've been in

I like how the statue pose is Wraith looking on depressed af after being cockblocked by MoM for the 500th time today...
---
god as someone who plays killer and survivor this shit pisses me off lol
---
Flair checks out
---
I agree too
---
TIL
---
Thanks
---
Thats a new one
---
Oh same I tried everything, it works sometimes. I never play toxic, but if a quick teabag triggers the killer after me for a teammate to get a save then its worth it
---
People have strange... tastes 
---
Honestly i like virgil rework idea, also making it not be able to cooldown while in a chase is a great and would make sprint burst a but more viable
---
"Black Darkness of doom summer from the year 3 is a classic, he should be in the game!"

The hash slinging slasher is next you dope
---
I meant to say I was about to post this on Reddit when I saw a post beating me to it
---
And one other thing: if someone accuses you of it if you play killer ignore them, some people get angry when they die and try and find an excuse for it
---
I like the idea but I feel like it‚Äôs exploitable. Take the game hostage and force the other side to DC so you can take their points. I bet you could get a lot more points that way than from escaping or any singular kill. Now, if they added a timer I‚Äôd go for this in a heartbeat but that‚Äôs now two things you‚Äôd have to convince Behavior to do. 
---
"THE GAME IS DEAD"
---
Should it ever be at the cost of someone else‚Äôs enjoyment?
---
The Nurse thing is a bug sadly
---
OP followed through and encouraged the cheating, then participated in it to get the person because they were ‚Äúannoying.‚Äù
---
Honestly We survivor mains have not gotten a single good perk since david and now ash, While almost every killer we have gotten since has had at least 1 really good perk
---
It used to be the most cancerous thing of the game when blinds took less than a second
---
Even after all the nerfs they're still good, but the old bitter resentment is still there I guess
---
Hmm, I know it was a special mask released for the Game Awards but I assumed it was available for everybody even if they didn‚Äôt log in around that time. Maybe I was wrong
---
I played the nicest clown main when I was first starting out; he wrecked me but kept letting me get back up after my second hook. Cornered me once and shook his head like a disappointed father.  
---
I've gotten better, nice clown man!!
---
Wasn't the TR mechanic changed a bit with Plague's release? I think I remember seeing one of the notes say that the TR's volume changed depending on the killers distance, vertically and horizontally.
---
Why are bubbas the killers that are 100% guaranteed to be assholes?  This is a serious question.
---
Well done!
---
If I could make a request, good sir, would you be up to tackling "Press X to Doubt"?
---
I feel you, it's awful. I wish i could afford a decent gaming pc

Ha!

It's not a bug it's a "Feature".

It just works.

Is that a handsome David I spot?

God damn that‚Äôs elegant

Guys looking to the right. And guys looking to the left

The contents of the center folder is the topic of much debate

Good for you, I guess. Keep in mind the rule about censoring the names if you plan on shaming them.
---
But it's ashhhhlehhhh
---
Insta-saws are green/yellow. Omega blink is green yellow too. My point is that just because it's rare doesn't make it the killers best add-on. 
---
Hm she‚Äôs in all my lobby‚Äôs 
---
I like the thought of that. 
---
I'm actually planning to stream tonight and do several to post over the coming weekend. If you join the Discord, you can take a look-see earlier or make more suggestions. ;D
---
This is amazing
---
Yeah but nobody else is complaining that they cant collect it, seems im the only one struggling.
---
That‚Äôs Jeff‚Äôs sweater
---
Let me just assume you are talking about the part about using up the perk, what I meant by that was try and activate the perk as quick as possible to prevent the player from using it again and down them to deactivate. It‚Äôs difficult to do because it can be time consuming but then again you could just save him for last.
---
I don‚Äôt think you should get downvoted, of course I‚Äôm the OP, so these guys are gonna think I‚Äôm just being biased. IF the Legion player isn‚Äôt playing in a toxic manner(which any killer can do in all honesty), staying separated makes the game incredibly difficult. Also, people say gen rushing isn‚Äôt a counter, and I see the argument, it is especially effective against a Legion player, at least in my opinion. The one guy in particular who keeps bashing anyone who says anything positive about Legion comes off as just ignorant and whiny. At the end of the day it‚Äôs people honestly complaining about the mend action, and in most cases it‚Äôs just because it slows the game down. However, gens get done so fast normally, it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue that a killer has a means of slowing it somewhat, as least an issue as big as people keep making it out to be
---
As dead as an ass can get. I ran the double blade add-ons a few days ago and it took me a moment to realize that people were mending for an insanely long time.

You‚Äôre about to get your ass rule 3‚Äôd
---
Perfectly groovy, as all things should be
---
baby killer duuuud
---
I can't believe people are crying so much about this perk. It's one of the few survivor perks that are good on it's own and don't need an entire build to maybe make it work once(funnily enough that's how Ash's other 2 perks work though), but it still has wonderful synergy with other perks and can be super effective, YET it still has ways around it. It is completely useless against several killers and also made WAY less effective against exposed perks/add-ons.
---
Guess I missed that, but it makes sense now.
---
They did, there was a tweet 4 days ago I think, where they reverted back to the old match making system and it will be a few weeks before they reimplement the new match making system again because they are trying to figure out the algorithm for it. 
---
"The way he's meant to be played" so to counter all in game mechanics, and to remove all skill that either player has, and give the survivor a boring mechanic to heal out of, everything about legion is bad by design he's a monster that should have never been, if you think otherwise, then you are not healthy for the game the same way legion isn't healthy for the game.
---
Nice, but it bothers me when people are listening to music while playing. How do you hear game sounds to know where the killer is?
---
What about having a cooldown like dance with me and making it so that it could only activate once per chase?
---
Im rank 3 and yes, they do.
---
I prefer it.
---
This picture of a cake sure looks real. 
---
How can you "distract the killer" when the guy has literally said he wasn't going to move from them 3 generators? It's one thing to switch to that tactic during the game, to just decide to plonk yourself in the middle of 3 generators and just ignore them doing the other 4 is pathetic. 
---
I offer a dissenting opinion; Do not rework Freddy.
---
Because I ate her peanut ass.
---
Well now you probably want to hurt yourself even more 
---
Screenshots can be doctored. Anyone can say, ‚ÄúSoandso did X to me‚Äù whether it‚Äôs true or not. And some people go way to far with it with doxxing and hacking. 
---
Friend told me about it when it released for free on ps plus 
---
His tracking is the best in the game in my opinion. The 7 seconds sucks, and if gates are open it‚Äôs GG, but the goal should be to win before the game hits that point

Jeff is my main survivor but he seriously is loud af lol
---
baby myerinooo XDDDD
---
Holy cow. I would put this on my wall!
---
enjoy your indigestion
---
Love the game, and I love me some Legion. I‚Äôve gotten messages too saying it was a fun game, simply because I didn‚Äôt play him in a toxic manner. Not everyone thinks he completely shuts the game down 
---
Agreed
---
Yeah, they defs need to decrease his audio along with ashs, what is it with male survs audio weird, i remember when ace legit had built in iron will my boy was so quiet
---

Groovy
---
I tend to have it a lot quieter than this, but in the case of Halo 3's final song I had to absolutely blast it. I'm pretty sure it's the law.
---
Just looking to get my hands on a Halloween flashlight and Halloween medkit now if anybody has extra I will give you a ultra rare item or two or 3 for all I care lol. I had someone from on here nice enough already to help me acquire the fire crackers :) so thanks to him u/alex197770
---
Man just hearing Jeff fall is like having someone scream in your ear lmao
---
Wow, your lucky if you're only waiting 10 minutesüòÇ I'm over here waiting 30 mins to an hour only to get a lobby and the killer dodges it.
---
I guess on this we have to agree to disagree, but let me say this, thank you for at least being respectful. I‚Äôm cool with different opinions, but it‚Äôs no need to be an ass like most. Glad some players are like that 
---
ayyye ahahaha
---
I would love a nick cage killer!
---
I would say Doc comes close in the tracking department, but I‚Äôve never put a whole bunch of time into him 
---
THE NEW RANKING SYSTEM MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER, UNLESS YOU MANAGE TO DO EVERY ONE OF THE EMBLEMS TO GOLD OR HIGHER, RUNNING A JACK OF ALL TRADES BUILD RUNNING EVERY FIELD IN THE GAME, YOUR ODDS ARE PIPPING ARE LOWER THAN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN CHERNOBYL. 
---
You should also play Spirit, so that you sound like a Deadite.
---
I got a match earlier that said I had 100 ping and promptly had a two second delay on everything. Me and my two friends were constantly teleporting back a couple feet.
---
It's always fucking Seamus 
---
Gladly* anything to bring the Nurse down :(
---
Yeah, have a good day in the fog my d00d
---
It's the same thing with pallets. Survivors think the game is just going to give them god mode the instant they tap space, even though you can clearly see that the pallet throw has a wind-up animation they have to go through before the stun.
---
"Should I have thrown the pallet earlier? No, it's the game that must be wrong."
---
Do you know because you're seamus
---
yea public lobbies, just not "ranked"
---
AT THIS POINT THEY PROBABLY THINK THEY'LL GET SHIT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, BUT THE TRUTH IS THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DESIGN A GAME PROPERLY, THIS MISTAKE IS SO BASIC THAT THE ONLY THING IT SHOULD CONJURE UP IS LAUGHTER. MAKING SURVIVORS PERFORM EVERY ACTION IN THE GAME TO PIP IS BEYOND STUPID, EVEN IF A PERSON OUTPERFORMS THEIR TEAMMATES ON AVERAGE IN OVERALL CATEGORIES, THEY CAN DEPIP JUST FOR THE SIN OF NOT DOING EVERY GODDAMN THING IN THE GAME THERE IS TO DO IN A SINGLE LOBBY, IT'S FUCKING INFURIATING. 
---
24 seconds is a very long time to not be on a generator, yes. In op's example he was saying they die at the same time, if you self care 2 and some extra time that was a full generator.
---
How dare you say that madarchod
---
Compared to a teammates 16, it's not horrible. But yea being one shot does not help your team. And there's always time to self care, two dying is not an appropriate time.
---
You're probably right.  I'm sure  BHVR has had this conversation a million times on how to make it work.  There's probably not a realistic solution to make it happen, otherwise they would have done it already.
---
*laughs in Nurse*
---
Your wallet.
---
‚Äúlegion fuck‚Äù he must really be into legion LMFAO 
---
What happened?
---
120% is not a slight increase at all lol. This guy would be op af just from that.
---
Lol whatever you say man. SC has been used on every survivor since the game started. 
---
and they still haven't changed him at all...gj bhvr, 
---
No, it looks like the way to deal with them is to get hit
---
JUST LIKE ME a loser :(
---
D A R N
---
Removed as they reverted to the old matchmaking system.
---
Yep, if you get downed as survivor DC.  If the survivors finish all 5 gens when you're killer DC.  Also DC if you don't like the killer you're facing or any of their perks or add-ons. It's also meta to DC as killer if a survivor has looped you for longer than you'd like.
---
No. It's a motivational board. 
---
r/DBDgonewild 
---
Oh
---
We have no idea that it's not his first account either thats speculation. What's not speculation is he knows people say it's op and he is new to reddit so where did he come up with that idea. 
---
Ashley has the Gauntlet.
---
r/hornyteensgotothatsub
---
When I was a new player, I used to like it.  But I probably haven't touched it after my first month of the game.
---
This perk is a huge fucking issue. Most survivors I get already have it and its really gonna ruin this game of its not changed. There needs to be some other downside or condition to it. 
---
Fuck you betcha, this is hot
---
"You're probably wondering why I've gathered you today." *Pets cat*
---
Just remain calm. Probably had a bad game. 
---
32 seconds? Unless 16 is not the base healing speed for teammates, it's 24. 16 √ó 50% = 8. 16 + 8 = 24.
---
Then why are all the red ranks running self care in all of my games? And in games where survivors aren't self healing they usually die quicker (noted when games end too fast with Hag and Myers)
---
And yes, I stated I run Botany so I can also heal my teammates quicker which helps us get on gens faster. It helps with my self heal.
---
I am assuming we are both aware of what is "going on" right ? xD 
---
You know thats for balance right OP?
---
Fun fact, during the time of creating ANOES, there were tons of cases in California where children were abused sexually. So, basically , Wes Craven said "Yeah they may think we are piggybanking on this soooo, lets not" 
---
Guess not
---
Leather face was a good guy in one of his latest films. why can't we have "good" bad guys?
---
I think it might have just been a limited time thing.
---
I still have mine.
---
I popped Hope on my Ash and it's been great with Mettle. Even if I'm hooked across the map from an exit gate I have enough time to get over there. I got a hatch escape on the cusp of being Rancored because of Mettle and Hope. 
---
Sure just go ahead and give EVERYONE their money back...
---
You say this like this is a bad thing...
---
G R O O V Y
---
Enjoy the ban for dcing :)
---
Yeah kind of
---
I hope we get more Ash stuff down the line... Maybe I‚Äôm just greedy but c‚Äômonnnnn... Bruce would probably be quite supportive and the devs probably realize how much we love Ash!
---
This is normal for games. Every game i play has this problem, usually. They usually are designed for you  not to notice. If you are standing out in the open, you dont even know he shot that bullet 1.2 seconds ago. 
---
Dude its way worse for survivors, survivors have wayyyy more absolutely useless perks AND they make way less BP flat out (not even counting BBQ) 
---
The lag causes what the Survivor sees vs. what the Killer sees to be quite different. It's not about Survivors not thinking they can get hit through windows. It just straight up looks like you get through the window, take several steps away, and then get hit by a weapon that's so far behind you. Reasonable thing to get salty over, just like I get salty when my weapon clearly connects with a Survivor but the hit doesn't register. Game's fucky.
---
He had to prove how good he was somehow. 
---
You can always play the doctor since he can make people scream without him being revealed
---
Yes, it is a bug.
---
But no, it is not new. I've noticed it a few times over the past several months (maybe even a year?). Usually on the Harvester in Cold Wind Farm maps.
---
I like to make a survivor vault to the haybale side, move around to get them back, then go back up to have them vault a third time. The vault is blocked and they either run then or get confused about why Spacebar doesn't work and I get a free hit. 
---
However, because of this bug, sometimes they just hop right back over despite the Entity blocking it and I'm forced to follow through the vault. 
---
I really just want them to rework a shit ton of perks for survivor honestly, they keep releasing meme perks Like pebble and head on but continue to add Amazing killer perks, My main perks are BL and SC, but you would think i would have fun changing my other 2 perks up but no not really, all i have is worthless garbage or just shit i feel bad for using 
---
It was free multiple times, it‚Äôll be free again in several more months.
---
I might not have the best answer, but for me I always went straight to using claudette so I could get self care cause teammates are really unreliable most of the time and they'll even purposely miss the health checks if they want the killer to come for you,  its gotten to the point it's a necessity for me as I keep getting sandbagged just often enough that I have a hard time even trusting the survivors anymore.
---
It's a part of the bigger issue of the audio being buggy since legion was released.  Footsteps are almost impossible to hear, certain maps have quieter or louder sounds. It's really messed atm.
---
I think we're talking about op's games here, he was saying they die around the same time, so not running sc is not optimal with his logic. I am saying if you are not running the perk and dying at the same time, you are spending more time on the gens. I personally don't run sc because I am one of those players that does gens even when injured, but that's irrelevant to op's scenario.
---
I'd personally argue that as someone who plays both Killer and Survivor. Survivor has more low tier perks but Killer has more perks that don't do much for given builds. Even a perk like Left Behind or Deja Vu has its uses: meanwhile if you're not playing the likes of Billy a perk like Tinkerer is completely worthless.
---
I'd argue that, due to the fact that all Survivors are the same all Survivor perks are meant for the same base toolset. Meanwhile Killers have a wide array of toolsets at their disposal and as a result certain perks will function poorly or flat out won't function on certain Killers. This is also why generalist perks that work on most if not every Killer (BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, Enduring, Discordance, Sloppy, M&amp;A, Bamboozle, Make Your Choice, Rancor, Surveillance, and Corrupt Intervention) ~~(Literally just listed all the S tier and A tier Killer perks on this [tier list website.](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/killer/))~~ are ranked so highly while other situational perks (Stridor [only good on Legion], Unnerving Presence &amp; Coulrophobia [only good on Doctor], Iron Maiden [only good on Huntress / Doctor], etc.) find their way into low tiers.
---
I find that tier lists for Survivor perks are generally just ranked on power. Self Care is always on the top with perks like Adrenaline, Balanced Landing, and Borrowed Time also coming out on top. Then at the B tier you have the likes of Urban, Deliverance, and Alert. Then at C you have Diversion, Calm Spirit, (new) Decisive Strike. And at D you have Wake Up, Boil Over, and Sole Survivor.
---
But when you look at Killer perk tier lists they seem to go general use, somewhat niche use, niche use, and shit perks.  
---
S tier is the god perks: BBQ, Ruin.  
---
A are the perks that are always good: Sloppy, Discordance, Bamboozle  
---
B are the perks that fit most Killers with a few exceptions: Brutal Strength (not needed on Huntress / Nurse / Legion), Whispers (not needed on Doctor), Remember Me (bad on Instadown Killers)  
---
C are the perks that only work on specific Killers: Insidious (Leatherface), Hangman's Trick (Trapper), The Third Seal (Legion)  
---
And D is just generall bad perks: Predator, Territorial Imperative, Monstrous Shrine
---
You do good ting brudda.
---
I dunno, part of the chase is having bad things to avoid. It is annoying that there's some survivor perks that feel mandatory, exhaustion perks are a great example. I like leveling up a new survivor and trying out stuff I get randomly in the bloodweb. That's how I found out I really like Stake Out even though I never would equip it once I had a solid 4 setup.
---
That being said, due to the pitiful amount of bloodpoints you get in this game (Unless you farm survivors with WGLF for no benefit to the team, or use an AMAZINGLY GOOD perk BBQ on killer) I only level my survivors to 40 then desert them to level a new one for unlockables.
---
It looks like he saw you man lol
---
thats my point, play whats fun for you and ignore people who want to control your gameplay by calling it "toxic" to use a certain killer/perk/addon/offering
---
I put 350 hours into Friday and i switched over. I prefer fridays combat system but im sick of the super bugs and how they are content locked and even then if they released all of the content it would be finite to the movies. 
---
I feel like they semi-randomize a rough order of unlocking perks each time you start a fresh bloodweb (New Killer or new prestige level) and then inject new unlocked teachables into that.
---
I need to play more Hag.
---
Im not your buddy pal! 
---
That last sentence actually made me laugh, thank you.
---
F
---
Thats the point. Gamebreaking? Lol.
---
Your contribution to this community/game is 10/10
---
A super gen slowing perk so i can post up on a piece of wood 
---
So billy is always a solid choice controls are harder on console. I would stay away from nurse its just annoying. I would also say myers people on xbox arent as aware so you can sneak up on them.
---
Seems like you're the one that gets triggered.
---
Yah Teabag Yah Die
---
Yep, good stuff!
---
I certainly wouldn't mind it - I think the stories given about most killers aren't particularly deep enough and the romantic part of me can't help but wonder how the survivors' families reacted to their disappearances. In particular I think the Trapper, Plague and Legion backstories are a little too thin. 
---
Only ones that were a satisfying/conclusive read were the Clown's and Spirit's, IMO.
---
I consider crotus a pseudo, and lerys isn‚Äôt really an infinite because the killer can chase the opposite direction of the windows which kinda negates it. I do see what you mean though, it‚Äôs still horseshit and should be fixed.
---
Nope, The Legion‚Äôs frenzy attack doesn‚Äôt trigger Mettle of Man, it has to be a basic attack that grants a stack on Mettle 
---
I'd say start with claudette and unlock self care and the go to david bc David's got dead hard (which is useful if you can time it correctly) and we are gonna live forever which gives more bp.
---
  
---
If you get caught, run to a pallet but don't throw it down until the killer is in lunge range, keep looping around it. If there are no pallets nearby run to jungle gyms. They always have a pallet (if it's not an l-wall t-wall). If it's an l-wall t-wall, that's great. Those contain two pretty safe windows back to back, which can keep you up for quite a lot of time.
---
 
---
If you get hit next to a pallet or a window, don't throw it down or vault. When you are hit, the killer loses all bloodlust and you get a speed burst. Don't waste that by doing things other than running. And also be careful with your vaults. You have to run into a window (from 3m or so) to get a fast vault. You don't? Boom, you're hit. You try to vault sideways? Boom, you're hit again.
---
Btw keep line of sight with killer. They might try to  use mind games on you.
---
Don't try to get great skill checks until you're sure you can get it. There are many sites that let you practice skill checks, so go check out one of those.
---
DONT RUN NO MITHER. Yes, you can pick yourself up but you have an icon next to your name that says:"Hey killer, if don't pick me up, I'll pick myself up."
---
Most people go for the cheapest things in a bloodweb to level up faster. You might not want to do that. If there's something rare, go for it.
---
If you have problem with chases, watch people like No0b3 or Tru3. You can learn a lot from them.
---
That's all I have to say.
---
Alright, but you asked why he was easy to loop. His power is a detriment to looping, so he ends up being just as easy, if not easier to loop than an M1 killer.
---
DO WANT
---
Not like giving away your position matters when your getting rid of loops and they are more likely to see you than vice versa and less loops means more hooks in the long run
---
Love this!
---
What are you gonna do? Sit on me?
---
Its a maybe from me...
---
Happy Bday from Me aswell! And 16!? Im STILL just 15 ;-; (Turn 16 next February)
---
Ps: Whoever made the cake is a God
---
I did not ask that. I am someone else entirely.
---
No one is gonna talk about the old DS being broken? Im surprised
---
Are you rank 20 or something?  
---
RNG for killer is awful. I had a Fire Up for like a month and 500,000 BP later and still don‚Äôt have it for any killer.
---
Lmao Im a killer main. Keep crying. 
---
It was a waste of money, but Jeff is amazing but he is no Tapp!
---
Well either that or just bring a health kit. Which is the more common strategy now.
---
I never had this problem with others until the update on PS4 recently and now it seems like at least 2 a game DC on their first hook.
---
"If you're having trouble winning in combat, try getting better at the game."
---
people like u seriously need to commit suicide
---
Yes. Vaults are rarely safe for survivors anymore due to them changing the mechanics of it as well as the latency. Combined, those two factors have made vaulting basically useless for survivors now unless the killer is like 10 feet from the vault. 
---
is there a gun in the inside to escape 
---
I'm told that nobody will stack it. That this is a completely made up situation. Very adamantly, in fact. 
---
i am what i eat
---
Shit, I did watch that video, forgot to reply. I think some editing might have helped since raw footage is a little boring, but it's sick to find another mongoloid running Dead Hard / Balanced Landing.
---
Yup. 
---
Delete all your nonsense. I'd be embarrassed as well
---
looping noob
---
I'm on the side that the lore is kinda ass, but I watched Into the Dark and Black Mirror, so fuck me.
---
*zooms out to see Sakura Swim Club*
---
Cheers, mate!
---
Yea, totally rank 20. Tell me, what does rank mean in this game besides you play a lot?
---
Buying unlockable DLC's with real money? u stupid?
---
From what I can tell Myers EW3 works exactly like Billy's chainsaw attack. It doesn't increase the stack or trigger it. Willing to be corrected on that though.
---
Ok so you've been running after this survivor for 5 minutes now, better give you a 1% extra ms buff, aaaaand its gone when you break a single pallet
---
Whatta douche
---
The way you looked at that tree, I swore you thought it was the killer.
---
idgaf what ppl think i just dont wanna lose karma idiot loser shut up
---
I don't know how that would help ?

HAPPY B DAY DUDE! :D
---
yep. Which definitely will prevent them to pip. They could try to save the day by chasing again to  increase their devious emblem and maybe get one more hook.
---
Not much.  But pretty much exclusively bad survivors who can‚Äôt loop, don‚Äôt focus on objectives, etc., use self care.
---
I dont play killer much. More importantly I dont whine about perks. Tons of things can be op on both sides. Whining gets things nerfed. I hate killers for getting my ds nerfed. Like right before they announced it was getting nerfed i bought lorie. Such a waste of my damn time. :/

---
I just love how people go nuts when you do that haha :)
---
I understand. I personally think MoM needs some reworks like making that it cause exhaustion or even acting as a BT. Something that doesn't fuck killers as bad but makes it a good survivor perk.
---
Chase someone else bub
---
I get tons of flashlight saves. One trick I use is to wait till the killers arm touches the ground before I go for it. Also it helps to stand slightly offset since it's faster to get to the side of the killer. You can actually aim at the killers ear and still get the save 90% of the time. 
---
I genuinely get saddened 
---
Sole blocks your aura to the killer, MoM shows your aura from 15 meters and further. Since MoM is usually an end game perk (unless your teams been getting swamped) they‚Äôre really useful when used together.
---
Red light. Green light. Red light. Green light.
---
That was so fucking satisfying to watch with the music lmao.
---
It's just that I've been seeing people being overly concerned by MoM and I feel like people don't realize that it's not that strong. I wanted to make that list for a while and it landed on your comment
---
Bubba can saw and it will activate however you need him to swing at you three times before. That doesn't happen very much.
---
After getting unhooked, don‚Äôt run across the map to hide behind a rock/tree to heal.

Well if it's a bug then it's all good. I'll just wait for a few months before they fix it like Lithe

Good thing this Ash survived Freddy üòè
---
Failing a self care skillcheck would've woken him up. Freddy would've then had to wait out the dream transition to prevent him from getting the hatch. 
---
I got chills owo
---
Fucking awesome.
---
Is this a post complaining about posts complaining about "stabby man bad" posts?
---
Wowe
---
How the fuck is it bad against Pig? Literally everyone considers her charge attack useless.
---
Myers doesnt counter it either. As BillyMurrie said you aren't going to be downing every single survivor in EW3 all game. You can do it to the obsession but you have no idea if the other survivors have MoM or not.
---
Some of these "counters" are retarded and are just survivors trying to justify the broken perk. Just because something is technically a counter it doesn't mean that it's feasible. Hell I've even seen "grabs" listed as a counter....fucking GRABS. Yeah let me just follow this survivor around for a few kinutes until they decide to use a vault right next to me.
---
Theres no point in considering bugs since they will be fixed. Your only killers who have a legit chance of bypassing this perk are Billy, LF, Plague, Huntress and Legion. Trapper requires them to fall into traps so its ultimately out of his control whether he can avoid it or not.
---
Now out of those 4 we all know LF is shit so he doesn't count, and good luck getting 4 survivors to stay in the game if you play Legion. Funny how they rage quit about legion because he has no counter yet expect you to stay and play against MoM which had no counter. Petty little bastards.
---
So you got Billy, Huntress and Plague. Plague id a shit tier killer anyway. Best thing is to just play Billy or Huntress, bur survivors cry their eyes out about how common Billy is and how he's broken so....guess they'll get him nerfed eventually too.
---
For what its worth I always considered Billy a cheap piece of shit. With the introduction of MoM however he really is balanced now. NOED too. Funny how that works.
---
You're fucking 10-ply, bud.
---
Despite what it says, he's definitely not hard to play. He's really fun though =&gt; buy him, you won't regret it 
---
cant be that due to the fact it wasnt plague :o 
---
You'll find a lot of survivors get ragey and quit when they go down. Ruins the game for the killer and the other players.
---
If you can't handle dying then don't play survivor.
---
thats a good looking escape cake. 10/10 would eat
---
You say this is not edited? Insane!
---
Alright but she‚Äôs not another legion which is good
---
I played nurse all day today because i don't feel like getting looped all damn day by people who take 3 hits to go down.
---
I‚Äôm waiting on the post release cries for a nerf atm

Aww tragic! You wanna nerf Adrenaline and MoM too? Or just say fuck it and delete them both

What is the point of this post? The killer isnt an AI mate, its an actual player. If they "find you in 20s and lead you to quit" it means that theyre doing their job at being a killer. Now i wander how you feel about the nurse if you DC because a killer killed you??
---
I thought we said: Legion bad [Downvote]
---
I really don‚Äôt think another survivor perk needs to get nerfed into the ground. It definitely shouldn‚Äôt cause exhaustion, and I don‚Äôt really know about the deep wound thing, it could be ok 
---
Tbh, kinda, yes. But ONLY IF its a good Nurse, If its a bad one, then Even Me, at my poltry rank 14 can bully her into hell.
---
Your post doesnt add anything new to the table. Did you vent? Great. 
---
And, yes my post also doesnt. 
---
Except the survivors who are sick of getting nerfed but most of us just gave up because BHVR doesn‚Äôt listen anyway 
---
You have made me stare at a man's naked chest for a lot longer than I'd like to admit
---
Yeaaaah it just made killers besides billy and nurse even worse against people who actually know how to play. 
---
Now if you dont run ruin you're completely fucked playing anyone else.
---
So, you dc cause the killer found you first? 
---
I'm not quite sure what the point of this post was. Basically, when you were winning, the game was fun, but now that you're starting to lose the game is not fun anymore? Yeah, it's called losing sucks. The point is to learn why you lost to improve. If you want to play party games, go play Mario Party, but if you want to improve then play games that challenge you. This game challenges you because there's no computers or anything like that, it's real humans playing against each other and the skill level in this game can get ridiculously high.
---
"the reason that kept me from getting the game was losing" - What in the world?
---
An extra health state once per game isn't extreme to you, especially when a team of 4 can run it and it fucks over a majority of the killers? It buys an extra two minutes a game, which is a gen and a half of time. It's almost a form of entitlement that survivors should have an easier time escaping when it's already easy as is. I'm guessing you haven't ever played killer because some games can get extra frustrating with how quickly good teams get gens done when you don't use Nurse, Billy, or Spirit.
---
This post is the embodiment of how to fuck the killer super hard and I'm the one complaining as I should be. You should probably go through my DBD posts, I don't complain about the state of this game as much as you think I actually do.
---
Average player wanting to be rewarded for being average. Nah. Stay in your lane.
---
From what I see the worst of both sides complain the most because they can‚Äôt understand it ain‚Äôt the game that makes them lose its their own skill. I regularly see atleast 2-3 survivors escape in half my games and games where the killer is decent no one lives 
---
At least you understand the case of Infinites (who are back ingame btw, the window blocker is bugged atm) your case isn't hopeless.
---
Every legit veterans of this game  (i mean those who actually care about it) are asking for years to remove every bits of bullshits mechanics.
---
From the "insta-x or y",the map layout, game breaking bug that became features, mori,...
---
Bullshits and trollish mechanics has to go.
---
But no, devs and peoples rather bath in toxicity or make money on it.
---
Yes! He's  a fun killer, he just scared the shit out of me lol now im on hook atm
---
I can‚Äôt stand her. W her range ass sniper ass 
---
Pleeeeeaaasee
---
Is this the Halo soundtrack? 
---
I know!!! When I bought ash the other day I was so happy, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to play him! But I didn‚Äôt find a game at all! Sucks that I spent some money on a dlc and cosmetics that I haven‚Äôt even had a chance to play. I thought maybe everyone was playing ash, so I waited a day. Yesterday I played 3-4 games within 5hrs üò≠üò≠üò≠ 
---
Well I‚Äôm just gonna flat out disagree. The survivors have definitely endured a lot more nerfs than the killers have, and even now, with the new survivor, people are already complaining. Like every time something good happens to the survivors, the killers beg for a nerf. And they get it too! In addition to that, it‚Äôs so hard to pip as a survivor these days (and I know it‚Äôs bad for killers too) but even if you‚Äôre a good survivor, chances are you won‚Äôt pip unless the game is long and you escape, or the game is long and you do a lot. Many of my games where we gen rush the killer we don‚Äôt even pip. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to destroy someone and then not get rewarded from it  
---
Finish The Chase. I love it. 
---
Legion Bad
---
Don't come at me like that. Are you like unhappy in life or something ? Idk why you behave like that but i hope whatevers bothering you gets better at some point and you no longer feel the need to lash out. I only said something becaise i dislike people being mean to others. 
---
Which one is the nurse? The only two I have problems with are the one with bunny ears because apparently they have throwing knives too???!?! Like, wtf? And whoever the dude is who stuns or uses magic or whatever that bullshit is because those players camp hooks and everything else.
---
I really want to emphasize how brutal the 2013 reboot is, I remember watching it in the theatre and absolutely not being prepared for it. Like, just one guy gets stabbed, then stabbed in the face with a needle, then shot several times with a nail gun, then beaten with a crowbar, then stabbed again before dying. Everything else evil dead related is basically not even close to the level of the 2013 movie.
---
&gt;you guys literally complain...
---
I encourage you to look at my comment history to see how little I bitch about this game.
---
And I'm glad to let you know I don't run those perks because I hate playing against them! And Intervention buys more time than just two minutes because it forces survivors to work in a smaller area that killers have to patrol. Getting hooked while Intervention is active allows way too much snowball potential. NOED has an unfavorable solution, focusing on totems detracts from valuable gen time.
---
Complain about the pip system. It's absolute garbage. I did two whole gens, three saves, ran killer around enough to max out boldness, got hit with NOED and died on first hook. Didn't even pip because it was two chases, not enough chases to bring up evader emblem.
---
If survs DC or kill themselves on hook, the devout medal is screwed. Killers with instadown potential STILL get fucked on chaser emblem as it counts as one chase only. Each health state is a chase. It leads to a lot of depips in red ranks.
---
Survivors dictate the pace of the game against a majority of killers. Survivor mistakes play a big part in being caught when a majority of pallets are still active.
---
There's a lot to complain about, especially the matchmaking. But what are the devs gonna fix?
---
imagine a 4 man swf all running no mither. sounds too OP
---
A little harder ?  This perk destroy all M1 killers when used by 3 or 4 survivors. This perk is badly designed, because just some killers can actually counter it.  I have no problem jf they nerf Rancor ( so you need to hook the obsession for being able to mori him in the end game ), but just if they make MoM to be more fair for M1 killers. Or leave the perk in his current state, but don't come back to moan about everyone playing Legion at rank 1. Because this perk just gives more reasons to play Legion, Imao. I hope You enjoy your Frank's Mix Tape matches.
---
If a survivor shows early signs of being awful at chases, I'll just take it as a given that they are dead. Usually don't bother hooking them, better to slug them and waste another survivor's time. If I am carrying them to a hook and see someone else, I'll just put them down and forget about them for the time being. 
---
Obvious trolling 
---
with extra BP! happy Bday 
---
how to de-rank?
---
i spent 4 hours waiting for lobbies and quit game when gates powered to not hurt survivors bp wise. got myself to 6 from 1. 
---
next day i logged on and was 1 again.
---
just for the reference, being purple i was getting a lobby in under 5 minutes. rank 1... well, sometimes i wait over 5 minutes, but mostly lobby kicks me out after 25-28 minutes with "session closed". i couldn't give a damn about perks, been killin' since double pallets, vacuum and bnp that would finish a gen in seconds. i tried to de-rank in a very softcore way but bhvr decided to roll me back to my red ranks so i couldn't fukin get lobbies cause there are no red rank survivors. 
---
i am a rank 1 survivor too and i am cucked to 9 and trust me, actual green-purple-yellow rank killers do not want to play against me. yesterday i got facecamped by purple rank Billy in a 3 men game cause, and i quote, "you're hard to catch if you didn't notice". and overall getting tunneled by killers way too much just cause they can't catch me in under a minute so then they get salty, tunnel, camp, facecamp.
---
i used to get tunneled a bit, camped too but never as much on my red ranks. i'm not really good at kiting, i just know maps and killer's weaknesses but any equally experienced killer won't have a problem catching me. unless i break the chase and mindgame hide. then they just leave me alone cause that's how it is, damn, right now no matter how many times i break the chase, killers still go after me. i can't, that's disgusting. i don't bm, i don't do anything i haven't been doing for over a year of playing and the game has never been in such a poor state.
---
I-
---
So what? Every consumable is different. By your logic, consumables can't be used by survivors because they are not the same as killers' ones and work different.
---
With that argument, killers can't use a mori neither because there is no addon that works the same for the survivors.
---
Awww
---
Bhvr gotta be better than this bug to get in the big leagues
---
Chief it's a bug, did you-
---
there's no way this player acts for real, especially when s/he told us that Huntress it's a big problem in lower ranks.
---
I hadn't seen the movies of any of the licenced killers and still bough then all. I've ended up seing Saw and Nightmare on Elm Street because I wanted to know more about the characters we can play as
---
Discordance should be average. It's easily countered by smart survivors because actually it's better to repair gens solo than with someone else. So I put Discordance in average. Whispers is average, seriously, you think people use Whispers on Doctor or Freddy ? And in general, Whispers is good just for Huntress and maybe Nurse. Why in your tier list Bamboozle is good regardless of killers, you actually run Bamboozle on Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, Hag or Legion ?
---
 And A Nurse's Calling is really meh on most killers without Sloppy Butcher or Monitor and Abuse, especially now with the Adrenaline Rush being meta.
---
What‚Äôs the bug? I don‚Äôt play much dbd anymore 
---
It‚Äôs whatever the tooltip says. But I can tell you from running the perk frequently to stockpile medkits and quenching the Quentin Thirst, it only amounts to one full heal and change.
---
Ok does it matter? She still would have only safety pipped if she got a gold so I don't even know why she's complaining about a silver. This entire post was stupid and pointless
---
Cool, but assuming it's from your parents... did you even think what they imply by it?
---
Shoulda put scratch mark all over it!
---
And Thanatophobia is in useless tier by far, they even revert the buff from PTB and make Thana even worse than before, it's not worth running even on Legion.
---
It does matter, because spouting misinformation is tiresome and, dare I say it, stupid.
---
Especially this one. It is not even funny üò£
---
all us 90s babies are like "ow my hip" all of a sudden
---
damn someone beat me to this, spotted this a few mins ago while skimming through steam this morning.
---
glad i did the nice thing and looked at posts before posting
---
Omg you're right, gimme any date after 2000 and I would think it was like yesterday
---
Imagine being this guy who lives, eat, sleeps, and breathe dbd all day everyday. To the point where he bitches and moans everytime he doesn't pip, which I'm sure is every game. Go continue being paranoid over a useless pip
---
Literally just to deny assholes BBQ stacks. Oh you want to run Frank's, iri heads, 5 blink, red mori etc eh? I'll just nope out of the game and be in another game in 30 seconds. 
---
Meanwhile I'm hoping everyone just DCs instantly too giving the killer 7k points and forcing them to wait another long queue. Slightly karma for trying to be a dick.
---
**WHY IS THE KILLER PLAYING CANNIBAL ALL THE TIME THIS WEEK?  
---
I HAD 15 GAMES IN A ROW VS CANNIBAL YESTERDAY. 15.  
---
WHY BHVR? WHY?**
---
Kool my bad. And I realize now I originally gave out wrong info
---
'Oh sorry yeah I was wrong about the emblems, weird bug though' there I did it for ya, you can leave now

I'll add it to the list üòÇ
---
As a Killer this is the place to shine with your mind game. Also Bamboozle helps. 
---
They could decorate the room a bit more with [bloody party streamers](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloody_Party_Streamers)... Sadly you did not invite me to your party, otherwise I would give you a [sealed envelope](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sealed_Envelope) with 20$ and maybe also prepare a nice [pudding](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Survivor_Pudding) with [trapple](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Trapple)\-flavour.
---
.... I guess [this is not happening](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/This_Is_Not_Happening).
---
Enjoy your birthday lol
---
Why is Trapper holding his like cleaver like Legion-
---
I'd watch it
---
It's the goal of the game, but play how you like man just don't make drama here it's tiring
---
Every time he hits you with deep wound the mend time gets longer and longer with every successful hit, when using certain add ons, it can get to the point where the mend action takes 5 minutes. 
---
angry screeching sounds
---
So Killers can have perks/abilities/add ons that decrease the number of hits to down a Survivor but Survivors cant have a perk that increases the number of hits?
---
There were a lot of perks that were going to be in average at first, but at the last second I switched 1 perk to meta and a landslide occured that put way more perks in the meta. I already regret putting Bamboozle in meta.
---
I would still put Discordance in the meta. Yes ot's better to work on different generators, but if Discordance does go off, you can disturb at least 2 people by going over there, it allows you to be more time efficient quite often.
---
I know I said "regardless of killer", but that was more meant as "the majority of killers". If 1 or 2 killers do not benefit from the perk, I would not drop it out of the meta just because of them. Just think back to the survivor tier list. It says "regardless of build", but adrenaline and especially self care lose their effectiveness with No Mither. Whisperers also deserves meta in my eyes. It has been in the meta for years and is still one of the most used perks in the high ranks
---
I would like to mention that bamboozle is good on Legion.
---
Nurses calling was a very hard pick for me. I started off putting it in average imidiately, but then tought back to all the tutorials on youtube and all the tier lists that spoke about how god Nurse's is. Then I remembered how many times Nurse's calling helped me out and I ended up changing it to Meta (and this created a landslide)
---
I‚Äôm allergic to peanuts and this game will probably be the death of me so the analogy seems accurate 
---
Takes me under a minute to find a full lobby, playing solo, Xbox one. 
---
Hell yeah go behaviour. 
---
dont rub it in too much please :‚Äô( 
---
I try to put the least amound of perks in "useless" as possible. Many people still use it, so it was hard to put it in useless for me, so I just put it in average, now that I look back at it, I should have probably put it in Gimmick
---
Is this a PS4 exclusive issue ?
---
Yeah it's pretty dumb. I've been using it with party streamers for BP games (and trophy progress if I can manage) but if you get someone who's particularly mean...hooh boy.
---
You thought not being able to escape a Legion in a chase is bad...try making it impossible for anyone to escape no matter what they do.
---
it seems so. ive never heard anyone on xbox complain about anything, a lot of the time i just sorta forget its even on xbox 
---
I‚Äôve never complained about the PS4 wait times for survivor before either. This is an entirely new level. There is no reason it should take a solo survivor 20+ minutes to find a match. I finally gave up a played killer, but the point is I should be able to play whichever side I want without issue. I was chalking it up to there being a new survivor, but the hype has seemed to die down already. I just wanna play :( 
---
Yep, downvotes coming but I just give up, facing a nurse feels like you‚Äôre fighting a legal hacker, 
---
You're forgetting that if you punish DCs harder then we can just switch to hook suicide. 
---
Except if Im gonna be forced to give some tryhard asshole BBQ stacks I'll make sure to ruin the game by dropping every pallet first. At least now fellow teammates at least can try for hatch. 
---
Oh and the thumbs down report isn't even looked at by devs  so don't even try reporting lame shit like unsportsmanlike behavior lol.
---
Perhaps targeting the root of the DCs like fixing unfair, unbalanced, and generally unfun gameplay experience would be a better use of resources. 
---
3 gening is very viable what it boils down to is they messed up and are salty about it there is a reason they made de ja Vu do worst it does I have been on both sides and it's just kinda stale but very viable
---
It‚Äôs not a big, they are just very strict with the ranking system now. 
---
Explains why the people I let go when I played legion yesterday were so grateful that I didn‚Äôt repeat stab them. Imagine people just DC even more against him now 
---
Because you don't know how good the skill of the survivors is. And even good survivors will often work on the outer generators. Ok, sounds contradicting so I will change my original point: there are survivors who were already planning on doing the middle geneeators regardless of you using the perk. The problem is: the killer still has to patrol all generators. Putting 3 generstors out of use doesn't change much for the survivors, but ot changes a lot for the killer. Only 4 generators to worry about for 2 minutes is super helpful. You get a head start on the survivors. It also doesn't have the chance to get destroyed 30 seconds onto the match.
---
It only works against normal swings, stiff like Billy‚Äôs chainsaw ignore the perk. 
---
You should show it on Bruce Campbell's Twitter page ! Great job :D
---
I've yet to be on the receiving end of it (just console things, no killers in general) but the more people that learn about it, the higher the chance I will.
---
...I actually wouldn't be surprised if the sub mods start taking action against people who talk about it. If they bury this thread, I couldn't be mad. It's a really nasty bug.
---
No, if you escape you get gold minimum, I escaped and got silver.
---
Meme or not, it's a useful perk. Also, I don't really see the benefit the build you mentioned gives you. Anyways, I didn't know where to put technician myself, so if you want to put it in Gimmick, I have no objections
---
The cake is a lie
---
I‚Äôll embrace the chaos 
---
Imagine being that poor 
---
More lore would be really nice. I really enjoyed the Hallowed Blight event and it's a shame they haven't done anything like that since then.
---
Imagine using white reddit mode PepeLaugh 
---
People who aren't going against hatch keys
---
Whispers meta ? Man, killers use just BBQ as a tracking perk in my experience at red ranks, I barely see Whispers anymore. And Discordance don't proc more than once or two times in my experience, it really should not be meta ( especially when I see just Billy or Spirit using this perk ).
---
Can't forget shirtless Myers, this sub is obsessed with that
---
What the fuck, Legion?
---
Meg or David for survivor.  Killer its hard to say, because they're all so different, you just have to find who you like.
---
What? Didn't know this was a thing until reddit. Nurse matches are my only sure fire "I'm getting out" matches.
---
Maybe you should have asked, chief
---
I mean if I was a Myers and someone left their teammate on the ground for a solid five minutes to bleed out while they hid, I'd mori the person too and give the slug a pity hatch for having someone one their team not willing to go pick them up.
---
Gonna have good and bad games. Nice of you to DC and ruin the other survivors time just because you are upset. 
---
I find it weird people wait so long... I'm ps4 Australia and longest is probably 5 minutes at most???
---
Where are you from?
---
couldnt have said it better myself!! i have absolutely no clue what theyve done, but they certainly havent reverted it to any matchmaking ive ever seen before 
---
People who don‚Äôt play survivor don‚Äôt know how survivor ranking works. 
---
Pls don't be fake, it's so amazing 
---
Maybe you should stop being over aggressive because of your very vague post ?
---
im from scotland!

I can imagine Nurse on consoles is probably worse though! It's just with those audio cues it's kinda hard to get downed by the nurse.

Well for me personally, I don‚Äôt play survivor. 
---
daddy bruce
---
I honestly don't like it. Its weird lol.
---
Why not just grind BP with a killer you already have decent perks on, rather than try to force the plague with crappy perks?
---
Good point... maybe it was just his first time playing as the killer he was ü§î
---
I understand but it‚Äôs literally the only defence mechanism beside perks 
---
Jake - Bane of hooks, guaranteed to wait until the killer is nearby to then drop it 
---
Feng - Does the gen with the killer right there, or as soon as the killer looks away (Seriously why are you guys obsessed with doing gens that badly)
---
Jeff is just Jesus. He‚Äôs also making those clutch saves, just when you think all is lost
---
Adams tend to run meme perks, or simply go invisible male Claudette 
---
Kates are mainly great loopers and are generally effective at the game...then you get clueless ones. There‚Äôs no inbetween. Oh and teabagging. Lots of teabagging
---
Bills are wholesome guys who don‚Äôt take the game too seriously 
---
Wraiths have a reputation for camping and tunnelling which is unfortunately accurate most of the time (Despite being amazing at patrolling around with mobility and stealth) 
---
Freddy mains always insist the killer is completely fine and that they constantly get 3-4Ks on him. You laugh until you face one of them yourself. And then stop laughing, instead taking on a slow realisation of the horror that God Freddies are
---
You already mentioned Pig but I would also like to add that she has a reputation for tunneling trapped survivors and/or teabagging. Or you get the nice ones who are the most merciful out of all the killers which is amusing considering the killer‚Äôs lore
---
Clowns somehow seem like the fastest killer, and will f*** you up with no care for your puny pallet loops. Oh and he‚Äôs more THICC than Jane with all the curves damn
---
Experienced spirits somehow always know where you are and what you‚Äôre doing, despite having an ability that more or less blinds them. It‚Äôs all fun and games until you see her aura and you don‚Äôt have Dark Sense..
---
Hags are sick of being accused of camping when survivors rush the hooks as soon as she turns to place traps 
---
Nurses don‚Äôt give a damn what you think or want to do. Pallets? No. Windows? No. If you hear the screech, hope they‚Äôre bad. When you see they‚Äôre P3, look for the hatch ASAP
---
Go on the forums. 
---
Perks should compliment gameplay, not become the main power.
---
Perks like those mentioned are a nice addition to the core gameplay. However the game has become too reliant on the strongest perks instead. Exhaustion perk, MoM/old DS/adrenaline, self-care etc and Ruin, enduring+spirit fury, bbq, noed on the killer side.
---
Thats why there isn't much variety once players have everything unlocked. Who is going to take a perk like overcharge to slow down gens when you can just bring Ruin and immediately slow the game from the start?
---
Those perks aren't an addition to the gameplay, they completely change it. Now we have a stale meta and that meta won't change unless an equally strong perk comes out.
---
Don't think it will take this long it's probably just so that those hits got their own category for bp reward and dailies and they forgot to add this category to what counts towards mettle. More interesting is how nobody noticed that. They must have play tested it, right? At least a little?
---
Seems that even the Entity isn‚Äôt that cruel on the survivors
---
Looks like the Entity really wanted that one particular one to get out. Did she seem to have sore knees by any chance?
---
Just because a perk isn‚Äôt a good choice against EVERY killer in EVERY situation doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs broken. The nurse‚Äôs blinks won‚Äôt work because her blink attacks are tied to her power and not just a basic attack. Duh. Same with other killers. It‚Äôs already a pretty good perk, it doesn‚Äôt need to be up there with Self-Care.
---
That laugh just makes this 10 times better.
---
Anyone bitching about the build/nurse is a ten year old probably. 
---
Do statues include dedicated servers?
---
I'm not getting all the DLC again. Thats wasted no,e.g..
---
You get in a chase and lead him away (or just kite him around near the 3 gens if you have to) then your teammates work on a gen. He‚Äôll either give up the chase and go back to the gen (just get another person to get in a chase) or he‚Äôll chase you long enough for someone to finish a gen
---
wow, that's an amazing comparison. i literally see it  
---
Sheems like little Timmy got on his daddy‚Äôs playstation.
---
Well.... the picture is definitely real
---
&gt; Ok does it matter?
---
yeah it does u vegetable
---
They're waiting for the train. Its 5 mins late already
---
it sucks in that enough play you no longer need the assistance, now if it lasted longer and gave other survivors within 20m the same information it might become very useful for solo play
---
full heal is 16 charges
---
It's obvious
---
I've run pharmacy before and it's true, a green medkit only heals you for 1 health state and about %80 of the other one with no Great Skill Checks that is.
---
That you will use the perk? Yes.
---
That you will start with only 1 token remaining and half of the second token in use? Not really. 
---
Also some sort of countermovement to that last one, for some reason.
---
We need this!
---
Did you ever try fake vaulting or double vaulting? But yeah it's still one of the best Tiles for Survivors. The goal is to get the pallet dropped in as few laps as possible.
---
:)
---
Hag doesn't struggle at high ranks?  
---
The perk is reverse. In my opinion, it should make the stronger killers suffer and not shit on low-tier killers like Freddy, Trapper and Wraith.
---
Also, the perk not working against Nurse is a confirmed bug iirc.
---
How is this in any way arguably worse?
---
But then add-ons are just that for survivors. Going in perks only is perfectly viable. The same for killers is ok for which ones? Nurse, maybe.

You‚Äôre literally sexually assaulting this man, stop the aggressiveness pls

derious question: does everyone forget NOED when talking about S tier Killer perks or is NOED just a meme?
---
Yes its supposed to be like that.
---
Even killer mains want this, man. We dont wanna just main the same two killers all day. We wanna play more shit.
---
Haha nice play
---
But why did you let him hit you after destroying the pallet ?
---
I‚Äôve been trying the new DS and it rarely ever kicks in for me either because I just don‚Äôt get tunneled or I outrun the killer for more than a minute. I find a lot more use with Dead Hard so I can just keep looping, but that five second stun is definitely going to be amazing when you body block so hard the killer starts face camping and tunneling you to the extreme.
---
I swear to god I have spirit fury level 2 on every non looper killer. Its complete horse shit considering level 2 is quite weak compared to 3.
---
Didn't they shutdown the Steam forums after making their own forums?
---
Weird aswell how survivors dont teleport 5 metres in front of you to drop a pallet on you anymore. And what happened to 60 second gens where all gens are done in 5 minutes
---
A chapter is a survivor, killer, and map. A paragraph is just a survivor or just a killer, like with Bill Overbeck, Leatherface, and Ash Williams.
---
idk but looking back at it I really worry that the killer felt like shit and either had a medical condition or something IRL that made them perform poorly in the game, like awful eyesight or hearing problems.
---
.......or maybe it was just a baby.
---
That's what you get if you skip the PTB :D
---
Actually it's sad, they should see those blatant bugs before releasing it...
---
I hope it's actually a bug because the more time we see without a hotfix the more I'll think it's the intended behaviour
---
Some people like being salty fucks *shrug*
---
Legion mains will cry
---
I upvoted you
---
Not gonna work vs Bing Bong Boi? 
---
Lets say it works against super lunges you get after uncloaking. Otherwise no. 
---
I mean, MoM is a good perk now, but being able to get no dmg from billy's Chainsaw isnt op? 
---
So you think that instablind, pallet vacuum, amount of pallets didn't need to be changed and adjusted?
---
Game was horrid to play as a killer for a long, loooong time heavily in favour of survivors you got so complacent with it that you confuse balance for nerfs....
---
It would only happen once perk game. Which would be fair because billy is already powerful. Just read my post fully and you'll understand what im going for.
---
I often just take such perks to tier 3 just to get them the fuck out of my bloodweb.
---
Tbh it looks a little like a portal cake. 
---
Never let go off that shift. Excellent.
---
Survivors were nerfed for good god damn reason. 
---
Such a shame we can't vacuum our asses through pallets anymore.
---
Upstanding move, thanks man.
---
I had literally every other perk in the game before I got Spirit Fury on Freddy after prestiging him recently. PRETTY GOOD JOB. 
---
Praise Daddy Myers
---
Whatever makes you sleep at night, buddy.
---
Yesh i run DS instead of self care i have so many endgame clutch perks there is no way i wont get out if the gates are powered. Loving it
---
I really don't get why people have such a hard time with this. No shit the survivor perks aren't gonna be 1-to-1 equal with the killer.
---
*Asymmetrical* horror, assholes. Key word.
---
Works on wraith not on piggy
---
Meanwhile the game itself is suffering from a DC epidemic and other issues really bringing the game down into the gutter but since everyone can buy an oversized piece of plastic, I guess it's good enough..?
---
Do you know if anyone has tested it with all the killers? Maby I will try some KYF and test it out later if it's not done.
---
It's only shitty if you mori them after their first hook. That's essentially saying "haha fuck you I can skip 2/3 of my objective". After second hook, it's fair game IMO.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I just made a post going over Ashes perks and how to use it to farm bloodpoints and save lives off of any killer. It‚Äôs not useless against killers like hillbilly and Nurse if you use it to body block when they‚Äôre carrying survivors or forcing them to basic attack you in other ways such as baiting hits near windows and whatnot.
---
It would be nice if it worked against ability hits but I think they made insta kills and some abilities mostly counter it because they don‚Äôt want people just farming for themselves.
---
See I personally hated how the combat works in F13. It was pretty bland to me. Run into a house, baseball bat, run to another house, repeat. I like that on Dbd depending on how good you are you can control the outcome 
---
People play video games to have fun but for a lot of people (myself included) winning is fun. And will do whatever it takes to win in order to have fun. 
---
Most people will only get MoM to activate once per trial and to top it off have to be hit 3 times which likely means they have already been hooked, maybe even 2 times. Also it has the downside of the killer seeing you if you get away and heal. It kinda replaced old DS though and is a strong perk. Idk if I think it should be changed or not though.
---
This leads to a secret perk called "killer insta dc" XDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
White reddit
---
Yeah I pretty much agree with all of them
---
sick outplay
---
Shirtless clown
---
What‚Äôs moonwalking
---
Ngl, I was just scrolling and didn‚Äôt realize that this was a deadbydaylight cake and thought it was a portal cake.  Happy birthday, have a good one
---
Idk how you plan on popping from tank one honestly but I agree I‚Äôve been stuck at rank 8 since that patch no matter what I do
---
Clown's honestly also looks like garbage from first person, same as Myers'.
---
Easiest fix would be for them to do slight rework, just changing which hand he grabs.
---
Oof, someone's mad
---
no one says it bad, but its redudent when you can just use adren, rush gens for 3-4 mins and heal up anyway
---
in high rank games you often only need to heal once or twice if everyone is doing gens properly, so SC tends to just be a time waste.
---
its not bad (very few "not meta" perks on survivor are *bad*) its just outclassed by the tottaly busted survivor meta rn.
---
I entirely agree. They were completely fine when exhaustion was  in its original state. Now they are broken.
---
Not OP, just broken.
---
but it's skipping 1\3rd , because unless rare circumstances are in play, downed twice = 66% dead.
---
it can only activate once
---
They implemented the new matchmaking again? Was wondering if they'ld do it because of the free weekend
---
or mori
---
Surprise Attack? That would be considered using your power no?
---
Shaking your head no when they start to run away, standing still instead of chasing them, whacking generators, following them but not hitting them, or hitting them and then letting them get away, etc. There are a lot of ways to tell 
---
I didn't know if he had NOED or not, plus he was playing really bad so I just assumed he'd run clutch perks to compensate for his awful gameplay.
---
Yes, and reread the power. It says that you lose it.
---
no, it's old. reverted, i guess. but i was having the same issue since they introduced the new matchmaking with the Plague chapter
---
Yup. I haven't heard him say anything yet. Bugged to crap on PS4, I guess.
---
Maybe if I mute the music completely...
---
Survivors: Evey killer complains about my DS, (prenerf), so I tell them to level up a seperate killer I dont want them to play because he is too OP then spend hours grinding to get that perk on all their other killers.
---
Killers: Im forced to use one of my perk slots to counter a perk most survivors have. But at least I can still use my other perk that helps in the early game so that survivirs cant mindlessly gen rush me while I deal with the survivor perk that I got enduring for.
---
Survivors: Oh my god! NOED and Ruin are so overpowered and unnecessary if your a good killer. I cant belive I need to use Small Game, a perk that counters everything totems, because baby killers rely on crutch perks like NOED and Ruin. I cant belive that I have to use a perk, just to counter a perk the killer MIGHT have. 
---
Also survivors: (After DS nerf) Oh my god! Every killer has enduring and it makes my DS basicly worthless. Enduring shouldnt work on DS because its an antitunnling perk now and killers should be punished for tunneling. 
---
What do you want from us killers? 
---
I would prefer Freddy: you have the opportunity to play as him now and in some time as another killer since they'll rework the dude
---
Not to sound mean, but as a rank 1 killer you CAN play other killers. You just need to get better. Nurse and Billy got me here and I got bored of the same thing over and over again. I play more Wraith and Trapper now than any other killer, you just have to get better at playing them. 
---
made with mematic
---
Distortion/Poise/breakdown are all solid perk survivors have gotten from the last few patches, only because they don't hit the LVs of *literally broken* like MoM/adrenaline they don't count.
---
MoM literally gives you a second chance for just playing the game and getting hit a few times, and fucks over nearly every killer in the game, sending the mid teirs to instant trash teir.
---
And barring rancor no instadown perk is free (and even racor you need to refind the obsession late game):
---
MYC/DH: rewards you for not camping or tunneling with instadowns (badly made perk according to you)
---
NOED: totally in the survivors control over if it pops, and can be disabled endgame if need be, but survivors want to end the game in 3-4 mins and doing totems stops that so NOED isn't fair.
---
Except that you can just go in a locker and stopping it from showing your location.
---
Well if they're hitting you right after hooking you, they won't lose points for proximity. A killer has 10 or so seconds to leave the area before losing points. 
---
Yeah killer mains cry about every new perk that‚Äôs even semi good for survivors 
---
The constant teabagging at the open exit gates has driven me to madness. The only panacea I have is slapping that hooked survivor. 
---
bro i fuckin have been. I have fun playing below average killer. If you didnt know theres this new perk called mettle of man thats gonna make that a lot harder. 
---
It‚Äôs a weak dead hard. Still a good perk but not OP. Learn to play against it instead of whining and calling for it to be nerfed. It *just* came out ffs. 
---
I play both sides about the same, but I probably play more killer by a bit. I would say MoM is a bit powerful but not too op. The perk just needs a little tweaking.
---
And why do you think the wait time is so long? There are just too many survivors. There simply isn‚Äôt enough killers. If you queue up as killer you literally get 4 people instantly. *Instantly*. People just like survivor more.
---
Happy birthday!!
---
If anyone's wondering why I didn't use any of the fountains - it was probably the first or second match I played after the Plague DLC was released and I still didn't know what they did.
---
It gives me goosebumps every time
---
but where the hell has this very sudden urge to play killer come from? i had no trouble getting a lobby before they reverted it 
---
I took it ASAP. I spawned next to the generator
---
Or rancor.  
---
Or Iron M. 
---
Or Nurse's.
---
\[...\]
---
Yeah well I don‚Äôt want to have to hide in a locker every time someone gets picked up. And sometimes you don‚Äôt even have enough time to get to one. For those 10 seconds I could be doing something productive like searching for ruin or doing a gen or healing a teammate 
---
Every lobby is at least 2 Ash survivors. I know what MoM is. 
---
You have two options IMO: make excuses and don‚Äôt improve or accept there are flaws with your killer games and get better.
---
I hate how survivors and killers both bitch at the other side. Adapt and quit crying. 
---
AS A HATCHET LADY MAIN WE TARGET YOU BECAUSE UR CHEEKS CLAPPING ALERTS US
---
No one wants to say they like noed or they think it's a good perk cause their internet points will get taken away 
---
I'd say bnp latest (second) nerf was good. Now it's time for Ebony's (second) nerf
---
Yeah but let‚Äôs be real with the current matchmaking I get boosted teammates so often. I‚Äôm rank 9 and my teammates are usually rank 13-16 and they don‚Äôt know how to loop and all that so they get downed so fast. But I guess that‚Äôs not the perks fault just the matchmaking systems. 
---
Yes, i am playing with my music on - not tryharding, just having fun as you see.
---
inb4 low rank survivor. Exactly - peaking rank 10 for life :\^)
---
There aren't many people out there playing strictly M1 killers besides the legion anymore.. It's easily countered, if you can recognize that a survivor is running it. Basically just chainsaw every Ash you see, and you're gonna be fine! üòÇ 
---
Yeah I guess
---
a bunch of people made fun of me and called me a skrub for using... a perk that makes people get more skillchecks in MY TERROR RADIUS. you shouldn't be DOING skill checks in my radius at RANK 17 you FUCKING WALNUTS
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleRamshackleTildeDancingBanana](https://clips.twitch.tv/PlausibleRamshackleTildeDancingBanana) Look at that slide into a hit through the window edge 
---
And that was green lobby ping..
---
Then it would just be borrowed time but u don‚Äôt have to be unhooked for it. But I mean it‚Äôs a decent idea
---
\*Lore\*
---
M E T A
---
Happens to me quite too often
---
Sometimes people just want to play the game, regardless of how many streamers were offered.
---
For the people who do play m1 killers it still is a problem and only makes them less viable.
---
OwO, -notices meg-, -uncloaks-, what‚Äôs this?
---
Lmao my flaw with my killer games is that im not hitting people enough? There is no counter to MoM except hit them again. Im playing Wraith the same exact way I always have played him except now im having a much harder time. There is no different playstyle to play around this perk. If there is, please tell me I'd love to know.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?
---
FLASHLIGHT TROLLS? I WILL NEVER PLAY BINGBONGBOY AGAIN THANKS TO YOUR STUPID TOYS.
---
I SAW MORE RED BLUR THAN ACTUAL GAME.
---
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
---
Yeah I think so too
---
I like to play Freddy and just stay in the dream world to fuck with people. It's so funny watching them try and hide and then putting them to sleep after they walk right into you. Lol.. I legit had a team last night have a guy quit right away so I felt bad and was gonna let them farm and get some points, but I wanted to at least hook each guy twice and get some points of my own.. They never FULLY understood that I was trying to be friendly and refused to save each other once my NOED activated.. They all died, that day.. Except the Ash camping the hatch, even though I allowed them to open both doors already.. This game is so much more fun when you make it so. Dunno why everybody is so hardcore all the time.. Just have fun, ya know? 
---
Had the same bug recently, and well, It resulted in a serious handicap for my looping, since pressing a or d could randomly result in me suddenly stopping. With that being said, I hope to never encounter that bug ever again...
---
Do you know about the old sprintburst? You don't want to have that again.
---
While the killer is in range, a soothing voice repeats: "Apply directly to the forehead."
---
arghhh i need this game so bad
---
I actually like jump scares which is why I play survivor mostly. A well-played Myers is an amazing opponent. I prefer him to Freddy by a long shot.
---
They do it because the video game made them angwy. Don't sweat it.
---
loved it 
---
I think the kind of killer you are looking for is in the tutorial. Try playing that instead.
---
Yeah I agree but that's not the point, the game bugged and gave me silver, but you only recieve gold and above if you escape. Matchmaking universally bad tho
---
Because it is not a basic attack, it is a blink attack
---
In what way am i supposed to "learn to play against it"?  Am i just supposed to not hit survivors?
---
counterable?  In what way?
---
not sure why i put nurse, lemme change it
---
Has to be a desktop browser.
---
Killer main. Nothing will ever be on the level old DS was and usually MoM users are obvious about having it so there‚Äôs room for counterplay
---
BBQ has like 6 or 7 counters already, not to mention people only really use it for the BP
---
Yeah but just because they use it just for bp doesn‚Äôt mean the other function of the perk magically disappears 
---
SB is the reason exhaustion perks were nerfed
---
Not possible, MoM is way more common from my experience than NOED, not to mention NOED has at least 1 counter which is to do totems (although not always possible).  For MoM you literally cannot counter it unless you're playing Billy/Bubba etc.
---
'Drop it. I dare you.'
---
Also, am i supposed to just bring exposed perks or play as billy from now on?
---
Perhaps, i asked this in the dbd discord and a few others have the same issue as me so hopefully this gets addressed or something.
---
Some people say they're good for stealth killers... Whatever that means
---
It's really not the same though... survivors can go into a game with the absolute meme of builds and still be "ok" because 10 times out of 10 their team is running something decent at least so they have something to fall back on. Baby killer mode is just baby killer mode. - Love someone who does all Jake dailies with only tier 1 spine chill with not as many problems as a killer using tier 1 surveillance. 
---
Cracker Reddit
---
How the hell did Jake break those hooks so quickly?
---
Myers players seem to have got incredible over the last 7 days. I thought he was buffed as they got good so fast.
---
May have to start using him myself again haha.
---
Actually, that's an excellent example. People were saying Legion was far too weak long before they started losing to Legion and then whining about "er what I mean is that the power takes no skill and is Not Fun to Play Against". If they'd listened to the idiots like you right out of the gate, Legion would've been buffed.
---
Fake, Ace and Meg are payed actors
---
Teabagging is toxic and a dick move. Hitting someone on the hook because they juked you for a long time is also a dick move. I don't know why people complain about teabagging but then they're quick to justify hitting hooked survivors. How about not acting like an asshole if you're not being treated like one??
---
You're points arent wrong, but it doesnt change the fact that MoM is a lazily designed perk that is strong just for the sake of being strong. 
---
They reworked DS and then immediately put in a new perk that, while not as bad, still acts as basically an auto include because it really doesnt have downside. 
---
OP is right, it further punishes all the killers outside the top tier and doesnt really introduce any kind of unique mechanic or gameplay. 
---
I don't think it's OP. I think the bigger issue it it encourages tunneling.
---
He ran around the map getting them to 99% beforehand, just to be able to instantly break them in front of his opponent.
---
The only time I ever want self care is when my team is annihilated and I'm hurt and looking for the hatch.
---
Most survivors I see now while solo surviving are running prove thyself and rushing gens even while hurt.
---
"I choose not to use the counters I am provided with and still bitch that a perk is OP, therefore I should be given an OP perk that has no counters whatsoever."
---
Jesus there's flawed logic then there's having your head so far up your ass that you can see what you ate yesterday.
---
but then when you get dropped they mori you on the hatch
---
I'm kind of a fan
---
I don't think they got the memo that all this toxic BS is pointless if you don't do gens.
---
How radioactive was postgame chat?
---
I'm pretty sure MoM doesn't gain stacks or activate Huntress hatchets because they're not basic attacks, but I could be wrong. If it does I totally agree that punishing the skill is BS, but at least the perk comes with a downside and a requirement.
---
As for Spirit, she will suffer from facing MoM, but I don't think it will ruin her. She can still chase and down without using her power and
---
Yeah, then you do get the cases where no one is doing anything. There's a happy balance somewhere.
---
But I also understand why survivors do gen rush. Their goal is to get out. Some killers are super sweaty and face camp, so the survivors who have been conditioned to assume every killer is sweaty will gen rush. The trade off is no one breaks 18k if they gen rush. 
---
A lot of people do it to stop the survivor scream. 
---
Why let it bother you either way? I'm pretty much a survivor main these days and I just find it funny when they hit me on the hook repeatedly. 
---
The not obsession has to do more to activate it sounds like a good idea
---
The killer did was he was supposed to do, you didn't play it correctly.  
---
When you run at the pallet, you only pretend to pass him.  
---
In the last second you turn around, run the other way and the killer is going to swing into nowhere.
---
Yeah ive done that a few times.
---
It's our trade off for not having to deal with 30 minute queue times.
---
Did you deserve it? Were you acting like a cunt f 
---
You right.  It's a meh perk and overall the crows are underutilized.  I kinda want to see prexisting mechanics developed instead of creating new onds
---
Ruin, thanatophobia, huntress lullaby then camp one jungle gym lol
---
Mematic dun dundunnnn
---
I mean, MoM encourages NOED on M1 killers.  I hate NOED, but right now it feels like go NOED or play a very niche subset of killers that can get Insta-downs or otherwise prevent MoM from charging at all.  Even then you can bodyblock to gain stacks to charge it up.
---
I dunno, MoM is something that sounds good on paper and could be a meta perk, but when stacked with other meta perks is a bit overwhelming in comparison to even NOED.
---
Ah alright yeah I can do that at some point 
---
I actually saw your art on FH and decided to stalk your profile for a bit because your art is fucking amazing, i‚Äôm super surprised that you play dbd as well, good shit

When I get the vibe that I'm playing with a bunch of potatoes, I do about two rescues and after that I just try to bang out 2 gens so I can get away. Normally I can get 2 gens done by the time that only two of us are left, and then I just hide in the basement until the killer finds the other idiot who's crouchwalking in the corner of the map somewhere, and then I can get out.
---
Of course, recently these dumb animals are DCing so fast I can't even do that.
---
Here comes the trapper
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
As much as I hated old DS, I did appreciate the fact that it actually made being the Obsession notable.  I really wish more Obsession perks for Survivors made being the Obsession different from not being the Obsession in a distinct way.
---
Thank you üòé I spent ten minutes on those üòÇüòÇ
---
Read my post again, genius. I clearly stated both sides complain. But killers complain way more, and when you try to challenge their beliefs they are the ones that get the most butthurt.
---
You knoe you want to
---
First, you're either gonna want to bring a medkit or self-care. You may also want to bring dead hard. Don't be afraid to take hits for your buddies (M1 hits, that is) as the goal should be for you to get away, heal up, and do it all again. After you finally get your third stack, heal up to 99%. Once the perk is active, the killer can see your aura if you full heal when you're outside of a 12/14/16 m radius until the next time you're downed. When the killer next finds you, heal that last 1%. You now are gonna loop for as long as you can, while your team finishes any generators that haven't been done yet. You'll have, essentially, 4 health states the killer will have to burn through: Healthy -&gt; Injured -&gt; MoM Injured -&gt; Dead Hard (if used properly). This will be extremely annoying for the killer to deal with, and will kill a very large chunk of time. I've also been running adrenaline with it, and I will say, I feel disgusting when it procs due to my team finishing the last gen after the killer has already gone through so much to try and knock me down. 
---
I haven't played in a while. They added new maps? Is   it dlc or something?
---
The easiest way to show this is to actually down one first, get them on your shoulder...and whack a generator while they're on your shoulder. Until you get to that point, people are skeptical. Streamers for a killer is another pudding until proven otherwise. (imo)
---
Oh yeah, cos HILLBILLY is the killer who struggles to get enough downs these days.
---
90% of killers need 6 hits to kill someone and don't get across the whole map in 3 seconds flat, even with MoM affecting him Billy would only need 4.
---
I love it when music and video games randomly harmonise like this.
---
Yikes the amount of killers justifying this tho...
---
Hope you all enjoy my teabags at the exit gates before I escape then :)
---
NAH, MORIS SUCK, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S BAD TO USE THEM - THEY'RE IN THE GAME FOR A REASON
---
BUT CLOWNS ALLLLWAYS HAVE ONE FOR SOME REASON AND IT'S JUST BIZARRE. DELICIOUS FINGER LICKIES IS AS GOOD AN EXCUSE AS ANY THOUGH

&gt;MoM isnt even one kf his best perks
---
lmfao ok
---
You know it has to be done
---
You mean players using the exact same Killers that they were even before Mom was released?
---
You could  buy pig. It's a similar killer who has an ability to let her be heartbeat less the whole match but has no insta down like Meyers in ew3. Watch some pig mains like psychoscorpionz or bygones on twitch to now how she is played.
---
I was seeing some main killers strean and agree with you, MoM alone isn't that good, but some perks make it really op and stressfull, but MoM shoudn't change too much, maybe like: increase the amount of hits needed to take before it activates based on the number os totens on the map, thid would really nerf in the start game.
---
You get either or with 4-man SWF. Either way they act so entitled it's stupid, provided they're toxic. 
---
It's always surprising to *not* get condemned by SWF, truthfully, and when they actually understand it's amazing. It's just like "Wow. I was expecting salt or egotism for this, but you're alright."
---
Are you playing on console?  I've had this happen a couple times, in addition to some other visual bugs on xbox.  Usually rebooting or clearing the console cache helps.
---
My favourite part is that he even censored his own name, but not the killers lmao. 
---
I‚Äôm not bitching that barbecue is op well maybe a little but I‚Äôm bitching about killers that cry about every good survivor perk and demand it to be nerfed
---
LOOOL im dead
---
I love it! 
---
Was really making a blanket statement about survivors in general, but yeah I agree
---
HUERHUEHUA You though it was Clown, but it was ME, NOED! 
---
Yeah sure, but it's not about daily anymore
---
"Sorry guys for Irid + Infantry guys I just had a Huntress daily" lol
---
Discordance is nice
---
"Vaulting basically useless"
---
lolwut
---
Vaulting is still the premise of every non-pallet loop because killers vault slower than survivors. I s2g survivors come back to this game after two years, see that infinites are gone, and go "GAME KILLER FAVORED, COMPLETELY UNWINNABLE"
---
What's the message here? No one was shitting on you on your last post or losing their minds in the comments
---
I main both, MoM isn‚Äôt op.
---
Is really strong? Yes it is, and it is undoubtedly meta.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much DS 2: Electric Boogaloo.
---
Well yea it was for a daily on a survivor I don't use. I love getting face camped so it's nbd I just laugh at how angry a killer has to be to face camp and intentionally throw because of a flashlight.
---
Change deliverence for MoM and you got that sorted mate. Or we'll make it so you can unhook and heal 
---
My interpretation is that the killer wasn't looking at the player status icons and somehow thought you were still injured (even though you were already dying) based on the fact that he checked the locker twice after you were dying.
---
Also, you could have gotten out by taking a hit at 0:00, or when he was kicking the pallet, or when he hit you after kicking the pallet.

This is cute af

i had a daily yesterday to mori a survivor. I mori‚Äôd all 4
---

Surprisingly the killer was rank 11.
---
I'VE TRIED LEARNING NURSE THE PAST TWO DAYS BUT EVERY FUCKING GAME IS ON GODDAMN COLDWIND FARM. IT'S A RECORD. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO COLDWIND FARM SO MANY TIMES THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE PLAYED SURVIVOR. THE ENTITY HATES ME.
---
Yeah I know but it would be so nice to see a nurse or hillbilly on his hand as a puppet
---
Dastardly! So that‚Äôs why no gens were popping ...
---
As a PS4 player, you can always spot the toxic SWF coming a mile off and the best pre-emptive revenge you can take against them is to leave the lobby and force them to wait 20 mins for another game.
---
I didn't want to risk NOED because he was at the gate immediately and thought he probably wanted to come with a buzzkill.
---
omg its beautiful!!
---
For huntress I would go with whispers bbq Ruin and nurses 
---
He has to chase someone for a couple of seconds or they‚Äôll just stay on the gen. He can‚Äôt chase 3 people at once. Have 2 either doing a gen and 1 saving the hook or 2 saving the hook and 1 on a gen. He‚Äôll have to chase someone.
---
We need more chili peppers in DbD :D
---
this is why i like having headphones. because bill is loud as a train

Amazing!!
---
Tell me your secrets ...

Claudette‚Äôs too. Sometimes you can‚Äôt discern exactly where they are but headphones help. Can‚Äôt imagine playing this game without them

Nah, survivor items are almost never that influential and just as expensive. Also perk levels are the worst thing in this game, just get rid of them already. 
---
**where is your god now**
---
Its terrible for both survivor and killer. I saved up 950,000 blood points after buying adrenaline in the shrine so I could get it on Jeff and guess what? I didn‚Äôt even see tier 1 after all those points. It literally only appeared once I had almost every other survivor perk in the game at tier 3 on him.
---
I would recommend aiming a bit higher kinda towards there head
---
We I don't mind most of those perks but I want to stay away from Ruin. I'm trying to create builds without it to try to get better and pressuring myself to get faster kills. Basically I wanna practice lol. I've been using Ruin for a while and I wanna see how well I can do without it and NoED (I only use NoED on Freddy along with Blood Warden and Remember Me). But yeah, all the other perks sound great. My only problem with hatchets tho is when dealing with experienced survivors it can... Well.. be a pain to hit them lol. As for throwing it at pallets I usually do, do that whenever I can
---
Imagine huge terror radius doctor with an infinite tier III Michael. As a doctor you just buy time for your buddy to rekt them end game.
---
Yeah for the most part. I mean I would if I was on last hook but if not I‚Äôll take my chances
---
I can‚Äôt help but hate and love them at the same time
---
"I'm literally in the exit gate, but I'd rather hold up the game just to teabag."
---
Please just get out. You earned your escape, I shouldn't have to Spartan kick your ass to get you to leave.
---
Technically that makes you an asshole, so good job being an asshole just stop preaching it to the rest of the world you good for nothing pos.
---
In my opinion the just need to make it so the killer is the power role, and not the survivors. As it should be.
---
Hahaha yeah because it‚Äôs such a gamebreaking perk. If you need to use the best killers with the most OP add ons to beat somebody with a good-top tier perk you need to have a look at yourself. 
---
This is a beautiful thread. 
---
I‚Äôll do it to people that teabag me in chase. Too bad a lot of survivors can dish out the BM‚Äôing but bitch as soon as it‚Äôs thrown back at them. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Just bought leather face can‚Äôt wait to get bbq on my spirit :):):):):)
---
You BM killers and think a killer BM‚Äôing you back is ‚Äúyikes‚Äù..... one brain cell or what? Lmao 
---
Ew tumblr jokes
---
Mental how killer mains started the ‚Äòentitled survivor main‚Äô thing when they‚Äôre the ones crying on forums after every update. How can you not even be 1% self aware lol 
---
That's why I mash the pick up button when looking around
---
^^
---
They DC'd, so probably none. 
---
Spirit main: I only try to phase when I know I will be able to reach that gen while I‚Äôm still out of their terror radius. Try a game like this it will make a huge difference 
---
You can actually see that it worked in the video. He hits you, turns around and then looks back at you.
---
People who DC can and often do stick around for post game chat just to vomit up their salt, typically in some long winded paragraph they've been itching to send once the match is over.
---
IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESCAPE THE NURSE OR KILLER ONCE THEY SET THEIR SIGHTS ON YOU AND PERSUE YOU AND ONLY YOU. HOW ON EARTH DO I LOSE THE KILLER WHEN SHE CAN CLEARLY SEE WHERE IM GOING, WHERE I AM AND WHAT IM DOING AT ALL TIMES ANYWAY.
---
serious question lol, im a free weekender, i feel completely overwhelmed XD how do I escape the killer they're so fast and can easily track you
---
This map has been in the game for over a year. Truly a while. But yeah, they add maps with every chapter for free
---
Imagine getting mad over a video game lol. I'm saying do what you want to do without fear of criticism from others who barely have an impact on your life, is that really a bad thing? If you want to play a character in a video game then play that character, you're playing for you not anyone else. Take your salt somewhere else fucking neckbeard 
---
If I'm continuously pallet blinding, it's because the killer is letting it work (i.e. is losing me and letting me get away when I do) otherwise, I don't really bother to do it more than once or twice if they manage to keep chase. It wastes my time as the surv more than the killers.
---
I just want to share my thoughts with you on why survivors are so frustrated, constantly. Emotionally there is no way for a Killer to lose this game in a themeatic sense. Your win condition is murdering all four survivors. Your ‚ÄúLose‚Äù condition is having four people run in abject terror from you for an upwards of 15 minutes. Playing as a survivor, there is no positive emotions associated with gameplay. Themeatically your ‚ÄúWin‚Äù condition is running away in abject terror, and your Lose condition is a long and humiliating death with no way to fight back. I feel like these things alone are why this game is constantly drowning in arguments and insults, with survivors finding /any/ tangible way to feel like they can inconvenience an unstoppable murder machine, and when they can‚Äôt do it in the game those feelings manisfest as hate speech in the post game lobby. Just remember that even though they ‚ÄúWon‚Äù they didn‚Äôt Win. You always win. I think Dead By Daylight is impossible to balance for this reason, and I no longer play it, but I checked in for Ash discussion and memes. 
---
Its weird. I have no issue finding lobbies solo. Rank 5 survivor(damn you pips) Rank 1 killer. Swf takes a bit tho
---
Hey the game actually just went on sale on steam and wanted to let you know. The game is 50% off and all the DLC is 30% off. Only Ash and the latest chapter are full price
---
there was no post-game chat as they all DCed 
---
The mountain in background blends with Nea's shorts and at it looks not like Nea running away from The Pig but she instead running towards her ready to kick her with leg.
---
It is 100k now
---
You are a 4head but he is even bigger one
---
I will ask my wife if I can put the Ace in the Hole!
---
üòÇüòÇ let me know how that goes!
---
It's pretty much completely useless against Nurse, because for some reason, blink hits don't count as normal attacks.  They should really update that.
---
It's occasionally hilarious on Pig. Someone will walk up to me, teabag in greeting, and then realize everything's not alright.
---
Mori after first hook skips having to hook a second time (and possibly getting blinded/DS'ed/bodyblocked), waiting for the save, downing them again, and hooking for the final time. That's a lot of stuff that you can just not bother with by simply bringing an offering.
---
I mean come on, removing a player from a match early is a massive advantage for the killer. It's why tunneling is frowned upon, after all, besides being unfun for the other side. But with an ebony, you can do that to every survivor in the match! That's not just "good", that's OP. 
---
Which is why I emply an etiquette for moris whenever I use them. And yes, I use them because I do play killer-more than survivor actually. So any of you trying to demonise me as a whiny "surv main", stop being so tribalistic. 
---
And explain to me how is a mori after second hook "a waste of time"? It's comparable to carrying and hooking the guy, sometimes faster. 
---
Sorry for the walls of text, but it bothered me how many people jumped to the defense of their crutch mechanic.
---
See this might be hard to understand, but that would make the perk overpowered believe it or not. No survivor perk should just automatically be good against every killer. Thats what game balance is. 
---
There's pretty much no counterplay to this perk if you aren't hillbilly or nurse (because nothing they add for survivors will ever stop a godlike nurse from slugging you all in 3 minutes). There's no effort the survivor has to put in to get it (if the killer has a brain you will be hit during a match, it's not like deliverance) and there's pretty much no risk to it.
---
What about DS? It's the same exact shit: licensed character with OP addon, only shows up in shrine at least a year later and nerfed quickly after. Deliverance sucks ass and distortion is like an empathy/bond kinda deal, not particularly great but not terrible either. Oh wait someone already replied that to you and you just downvoted em and ignored em, cute. Ash's perks are already top-tier 2s as good as deliverance or distortion, how do you feel?
---
It really did went to shit after the emblem system.
---
People have a weird fascination with complaining about little things, stating the game is unplayable and they‚Äôll never play it again...Rinse repeat.
---
As someone who plays both single and SWF on PS4, I used to get so frustrated by the killer leaving the lobby all the time since the waits are so long already, but then I played as killer and I understood. 
---
On behalf of SWFs, I'm sorry they make the game shitty for killers sometimes. Me and my friends try to keep it fair because honestly, it's more fun to have an actual challenge than stack up everything to the extreme and bait/taunt/bully the killer all game. Tbh I think those players deserve everything that comes to them.
---
Why Haven't we got a Evil within Chapter yet? Sebastian as a survivor and Ruvic/keeper/sadist as the killer? it could work! 
---
I love this. It's so cute. :)
---
Initially that was not how it was meant to happen, I wanted to stun him and then run to the door but the Meg sandbagged me at the pallet and I panicked and the entire plan was destroyed.
---
Wholesome content on the DbD subreddit?! What is this! I didn't expect this! The world's gone mad I tell you! MAD! 
---
\*Doctor's laugh can be heard in the background\*  
---
NOT NOW HERMAN!
---
I run agitation and iron grasp. (Because I love my basement and they should too)
---
It's even more fun when you hit them and then use the speed buff to down them before going to hook the person they were trying to save. Of course this only works if you're already close enough to the basement (or hook you wanted to use) already.
---
Lol it‚Äôs always funny when people strive to be garbage.
---
I'm pretty sure this is actually caused by an exploit which causes survivors to be able to use killer offerings.
---
Time for a celebration
---
To be fair I would prefer if this became the main theme song for dbd rather than the original. It fits dbd's dark theme really well.
---
Only people who only play survivor will say it's not strong. I play both and it's absolutely crazy. There is no situation where it's not beneficial to take it. Its downside wont activate if you play around it either and just put more time into generators.
---
What I do is get two hooks on everyone regular then let everyone leave. If I catch them again I‚Äôll just chase and not hit or bring them to a gen or something. This is if anyone burns a streamer including myself. Usually they get it after the two hooks.
---
I admit going back to PS4 from PC after the horrible experience I had with it last year, it feels so much better. Hell, it even looks better to me personally as the slight decrease in resolution is not that noticeable &amp; gives the game a bit of an antialiasing effect.
---
Do you have a link? As a Katr fan, I'm intrigued.
---
Rip
---
It‚Äôs great that they fixed FPS, but I‚Äôm not even able to notice cuz I can‚Äôt get a game on ps4
---
You have to get hit 3 times with normal attacks. Once active you have to be injured for it to go off, the only way to get the 3 health states are to be fully healed and hope the killer has no method of insta down, and while fully healed they can OoO see you.
---
Outside of killer power insta downs, there is make your choice, devour hope, haunted grounds, and the very obscure perk known as NOED that can be put on a killer to bypass MoM.
---
Idk how or who you play against but the exposed effect is like the 2nd most common thing I run into behind only Ruin.
---
I only hit people on the hook when they tea bag me. Then I tunnel them for all 3 hooks just to show them how much better I am than me. Sometimes I get heated though and it is what it is lol.
---
The Devs got to make a blood harvest session once this Reddit hits 100k. Would also be nice to have on considering the 2 new survivors &amp; killer adds more of a need to grind BP.
---
Sure if you actually think the playerbase is near universally bad.
---
Sorry the truth about your garbage perk bothers you so much :/
---

Then the he's lasts till 30 seconds before the last gen pops... Then NOED activates.

You can still type post-game if you DC as a survivor.

Sloppy Spirit best with 5 lit totems imo.

---
Devilish idea - add Mad Grit and STBFL to this build. Down one surv (not the obsession), then take them on a wild ride around the map! 
---
they use a modded controller and keep the the trigger held down, or  there just bored
---
Finally, some cute fucking oc!
---
70 / 30 or so survivor
---
OP? No, but like old DS there really isnt a reason *not* to run it. Its a strong perk for the sake of being a strong perk. Lazy design. We've had 6 survivor perks released in the last month or so, 5 are garbage and 1 is completely meta.
---
It doesn't add any interesting gameplay or mechanic, you just get to tank an extra hit once per game. 
---
I like being at the lower ranks (or higher? I'm meaning like 15-18) and having the killer chase my teammate who was working in the gen next to me but not bothering to push me off 
---
Just kill them. Sometimes I play as friendly Michael, but after being within hit range for a good minute and smacking walls and hooks, I get frustrated if they‚Äôre that stupid.
---
If you're survivor and theres a freddy, I wanna hear "bitch".
---
Source?
---
Last I saw, they reverted the matchmaking to how it was before Chapter 11. 
---
Yeah, the matchmaking is so weird. I'm US East (which one would think is pretty populated), and last night I was getting into games in about 20-30 seconds. Then, for no apparent reason, I just couldn't get in at all. I appreciate the optimizations they've done for PS4, but this region matchmaking does not seem to be working.
---
Trapper looking back at Dwight.
---
For you. Right now 2 minutes ago I got into a two man game, its not fun
---
Get matchmaking fixed üò†
---
Amazon link?? üòØüòØ
---
Trying to end the chase by not looking at the survivor while they are in the deep wound state, if you then just follow the blood and scratchmarks, you can down them easily because they have to stop and mend.
---
This tactic has zero counterplay and is cheesy af, so if we ever get a Legion rework, it's definitely going to be one of the things the devs will try to fix.
---
calm down you filthy thot
---
Take my friggen upvote you beautiful creature
---
All meme values aside,i'd imagine Claudette would search the ground around her and pick up some plant or flower and maybe study it/put it away in her collection (a reference to Botany Knowledge)
---
They ran you around for 10 minutes, blinded you over a dozen times, broke half a dozen hooks in your face, actually managed a D-strike with the nerfed perk, wiggled out once and then disconnected to lose rank.
---
And somehow you think you're the winner in this?
---
Yes, for God‚Äôs sake I can‚Äôt take Feng‚Äôs scream. **‚ÄùEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!** By now I must have lost some hearing from her hook scream.
---
*Sprint burst away*
---
Ok :(
---
Totally agree, but clown came out right after, so they clearly don‚Äôt.
---
Just a couple of potatoes, nothing to see here. 
---
Right now, we're taking some time to work on the new matchmaking system and improve the pings and rank disparity before we turn it back on. Being able to select the region you'd like to play in is great on paper, but if you look far enough back, this was how the game paired you with other players.
---
Early on, the download region setting on Steam is what determined where you were matched. In a PvE scenario, this is perfect, since you are deciding if *you* are okay with a bit of lag. But in a PvP scenario like Dead by Daylight, this could be- and was- abused. Someone could set their region to something far away and increase their ping so the survivors they are playing against lag, for example, making them easier to hit.
---
I can't give a date on when the new system will be put back online just yet, but we are actively working on it.
---
He's obviously pwning the NPCS.

---
"Keep crying and I'm gonna give you a reason to"
---
Is that really how it works? Interesting. This perk is even stronger than I thought.
---
I don‚Äôt play survivor Much, *what does this mean??* I can tell it‚Äôs cute but the pun is lost on me
---
&gt; Looks like they were just making solid rank 15 plays
---
Did you even watch the video? 3 flashlights, 3 D-Strikes and a purple Alex's Toolbox sabo Jake are solid rank 15 plays? Their low rank means that they've most likely smurfed down on purpose.
---
your name fits this perfectly
---
It's over meg i have the high ground 
---
Ow my hip!
---
For Spirit, I find Nurse's Calling to be great. If you don't get a gen-pull, you can get a heal-whack instead. You really only need one tracking perk besides Nurse's for finding survivors on gens, so pick a favorite. BBQ is nice because of the blood points, but any of them can work. Rancor can be fun, but it's hit &amp; miss depending on how the round goes. If you want to run two, BBQ and Whispers are good. Whispers lets you know which gens to move towards for the ambush, even if you haven't seen any auras. If you don't get a grab, you can at least wound someone, and then finish them with Nurse's.  
---
Go for an addon that lets you get to the gen without them being in your radius instead of using the glasses. You won't need them with Nurse's anyway. M&amp;A is critical for ambushing. 
---
Ambush Spirit is my favorite. 
---
the perk is 'dance with me' from kate denson üòÅ
---
I'm triggered that someone would play music while playing a game that relies heavily on hearing what's going on around your character. Imagine not hearing that faint hatch sound because of the soundtrack you're using while you play.
---
She's sexier with the mask on, ngl
---
Shouldn‚Äôt it be using bamboozle than doing ? Because usually doing one means doing trick to confuse your opponent 
---
Awwwwwwwww ok now I‚Äôm crying that‚Äôs so cleaver op
---
Buffing survivors isn't unpopular, lol where do you think we are?
---
Exhaustion shouldn't replenish when you're in a chase, that was ridiculous when it could. It was a sensible change. 
---
Well the if the little things people have been complaining about were so little, they would‚Äôve been fixed ages ago. There‚Äôs a reason some things are continued to be complained about, and it‚Äôs not for no good reason. 
---
It's not that they don't want to give us cosmetics, it's the way the license works. They'd probably have to arrange a new contract just to be able to give the licenced characters new outfits.
---
You need to get 3 times by m1, and then as long as you‚Äôre injured, the last hit can be anything. So you can force a r huntress to hit you with their regular attacks and then you‚Äôll be able to tank a hatchet later
---
No.
---
I said teachable, which you have to unlock. I specifically stated in the original and unedited post that my suggestion was to leave all the clutter of the base game perks still in.
---
Come on man, post wasn't that long.
---
Updated the post to give a little idea of what I'm talking about. It's by no means fleshed out, but the general idea is there.  
---
Hope you both have the time of your lithe 
---
Maybe everyone is trying to play ash, so you have way too many survivors and not enough killers? 
---
Mom is only obvious now cause everyone is still using it on ash. Put it on Dwight or nea and it‚Äôs a lot more of a surprise.
---
I want complaining he just said it was even worse I heard so I was backing it up...
---
I only hit Feng Min to stop her scream, ITS SO LOUD AND ANNOYING.
---
Thats enough reddit for today...
---
I think honestly one of the biggest things is the punishment for using the perk, that being that you can avoid it by just healing to 99% and then topping off if the killer finds you. It's just too easy to circumvent the thing that's supposed to balance the perk.
---
And they did no gens. Damn straight he won.
---
Yeah, there's a lot of fun stuff to do with Hag's addons. I've been trying out wonky terror radius hag since Plague's release - Granma's Heart addon + trap duration (8s of no tr every time a trap activates) with Dark Devotion, Monitor and Surveillance (occasionally Tinkerer if I'm feeling spicy with mint rag). It's not *good* but I'm pretty sure I've got some scares out of it!
---
No no. If you bring med kit, so you can‚Äôt blind killer with flashlight, which mean it‚Äôs harder to lose the killer tho.
---
you mean "added two more features".
---
Not really cause having 4 level 3 perks that are all either objectively not good perks or having 4 level 3 perks that don't mesh well together would pair you with people that also have those, but may be way more skilled or way less skilled. Anyone can grind out perks and by judging matchmaking on perks would either make matchmaking much more unfair or force Behaviour to admit that there's a meta, which they wouldnt and shouldn't ever do.
---
pfft, i drink my coffee in a bowl. cups are so last expansion
---
How could you forget the person who gave birth to you? Shame!
---
Yup it's madness.  I've never owned a game in my life that doesn't allow itself to be played.  It's a pretty unique situation really.  Frustrating as fuck, but unique, I'll give them that.
---
I did,still playing the shit out of this game
---
Needs more context. xD love it.

Surveillance is really good for late game and if you're regressing generators. I specifically like Discordance cause it's useful early game and it gives me a visual and audible alert. But either or is good for Huntress.
---
Just wonder why we can‚Äôt choose lobby music. There‚Äôs a lot of old good themes that I really miss it :(
---
Ha right also Kate‚Äôs old scream was pretty bad
---
Or a guy who poops metal.
---
Read your own post. Go on and on about killers complaining and then stating that survivors complain too with one sentence at the end of your post. "I clearly stated both sides complain." No you didnt, you tacked on a excuse to protect yourself with your Im right because im unbiased mentality.
---
That's embarrassing.
---
Laugh in Kate‚Äôs old scream.
---
i mean for perk builds yeah but i would say it probably the best tracking perk besides bbq and chili
---
AMD Radeon(TM) Vega 3 Graphics, is this good enough?

Play killer.

Ask yourself do I have Michael?  If the answer is no then yes you should buy him. 
---
A friend of mine uses GeForce Nividia since he doesn't have a actual computer, he dc sometimes because it just dies on him. I also feel like if someone has bad wifi it could fuck them over
---
Everyone is talking about that nice play but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how good the quality of this video is
---
Is matchmaking still bugged? I‚Äôm rank 9 but keep playing with rank 20 killers. Hard to pip when no ones getting hooked.
---
Try saucenao, and please don‚Äôt post without source, it‚Äôs art theft

I love both flavors but lemon would definitely be my first choice since I love lemon flavored anything

‚ÄúLOL BABY KILLER‚Äù -Chinese Emperor, 200 BC

sounds like some decent perks

Then when NoEd activates and there's only one possible totem left.

You know you're a hero. Unsung, unbroken, unappreciated.

To respond to the person who commented about my rank being low, who I think had their comment removed, I bought the game 3 days ago. I've played 3 or 4 games as Nurse, one as Wraith, this was my 3rd Trapper game, and I've played one as the Shape.
---
I don't really care if you don't think it's valid, I'm just having a good time.
---
That‚Äôs what makes it fun for me. But I usually play with at least one other person, so it‚Äôs a little more entertaining when you and your friend are on edge watching everywhere for him. I find myself saying ‚Äúugh I want a Myers‚Äù at least once every time I play 
---
Just play perkless it counters exhaustion :p
---
I was actually considering getting an ice cream cake but they had a lemon cake as an option and I was like alright screw the ice cream! Lemon is my favorite cake flavor haha
---
I figured it's going to be obscure no matter what else I put into it, so went with a simple design. lol  Final version has a distressed look though.
---
If only it‚Äôs not useless against Nurse blink (probably bug) / Legion Frenzy / Huntress Hatchet / Billy-Bubba Chainsaws / Trapper‚Äôs Trap, I will consider it as an OP perk.
---
Thats why i bring calm spirit. It makes hitting me unsatisfying since i dont scream. Kappa
---
This is the type of group who will makes comments on reddit and the forums like
---
"When I play SWF it's just me and my friends goofing around. We're not being toxic and we're definitely not a Seal team 6 squad. Several perks work of free information because of voice chat? Nah fam, I'm just telling them about the spaghetti I ate last night. We never talk about the game we're actively playing"
---
It's the same type of mentality BHVR had towards the older ranking system. " You pipped therefore you had fun right? " : "You got a 4k so you had fun right?"
---
If the process towards a 4k is frustrating as hell, even if victory was guaranteed in a case like this, it still doesn't make the match not an absolute butthole to play
---
god that could be me 
---
if i leave someone on the ground to chase away someone else i can never find the body
---
Sure I'm *selfish*, whatever you say wise guy. Now go along and get mad over something else. When you actually know something about me we can talk again. But quite frankly you know nothing.
---
Idk. It‚Äôs really easy
---
Ok, that makes sense I guess. Just thought it always referenced high rank players. We don't know how high they ever were, only that they de-ranked to 15. Maybe they never made it past rank 10. 
---
You keep misspelling Claudette. 
---
Repost since baby mods
---
Ignores it...how? By treating it like a normal match?
---
Activate Windows... ‡≤†_‡≤† 
---
&gt; How the perks are weighted, well that can be determined by how often they being used in a winning match? I'm (un)sure if DBD keeps any kinds of information about that, but it doesn't seem that difficult to come up with a ranking system that runs behind the scenes for the perks.
---
This is a perfect example of those *‚ÄùI had a bad day at work/school/home so now I‚Äôm going to bully and teabag Killers with my toxic friends.‚Äù*
---
That entire time they were just chasing after you and eachother, not a single Gen was done. And once you slugged them all and took ‚Äúpower‚Äù over them, they all ragequit. So you know they aren‚Äôt playing for Objective, and they aren‚Äôt playing for points.
---
Just a sad group of friends reflecting their anger on someone online. Pathetic and laughable.
---
4.20 to 4.21 sounds minor but fixed so many stuff
---
Generator's Demise would be cooler if it required an ally working with you to mess up, so then it's like "Look what you've done, this is why we can't have nice things" and then you go work on a different nearby gen with a little speed boost to make up for your ally"s incompetence. Would also negate the necessity for the use limit because of how much less control you have over it
---
They could at least start by gradually decreasing the healing meter when you're not actively, you know...healing. 
---
don't
---
What platform are you on? i'm on PC, and it normally takes 2-7 minutes, but i can usually get a match. 
---
i'm also a low level (bad) killer.
---
Dudeeee niiice
---
I first tough it was it
---
to play in a manner he deems best suited to his liking at that exact moment of course, but this is also a joke. not guaranteed to make everyone laugh or even chuckle, but still remaining a joke. 
---
I was having this problem on ps4. They updated the game and it worked fine after that. They may be working on putting out an update. You could see about sending an error report 
---
Sound is your friend. Headphones and high volume.
---
I'm on xbox one. Before I stopped playing (a couple of months ago) it would take me no longer than 2 minutes to get a full lobby. Now it's just a ghost town. 
---
Rank 19, bois.
---
I like the Gorillaz shirt
---
I feel the plague is more annoying 
---
L
---
This is yet another issue that I think has only grown so much because of popularity. Logically speaking it makes more sense to just die in a lot of those situations rather than de piping and loosing whatever points you‚Äôve gotten. But there‚Äôs been more than a few streamers who dc nonchalantly for content or to find better content, along with those who try and force others to dc. The only way this really is gonna stop is by changing as a community what‚Äôs acceptable and popular to do.
---
*^^sashay ^^away*
---
I mean almost everyone uses self care,that means everyone is bad by your logic,which makes you a egoistic ass at best.Just let anyone use whatever perk they wanna use lmao
---
When in doubt, nod
---
Spirit: Save The Best For Last, Stridor, Nurse's Calling, Ruin. Add-ons: Mother Daughter Ring, Bloody Hair Brooch. I adore that build. 
---
My FPS has been great even as a killer on corn map it‚Äôs been very good. Seriously you think dbd is bad, play pubg on console and then you‚Äôll know real pain.
---
what an idiot
---
And an additional fuck you to that person since this community really doesn't need anymore gatekeeping.
---
yea. This trend to try to find interest in fastly put on paper games backstory is gross.
---
Read a good fantasy book i don't know‚Ä¶ play dungeon or dragon but stop praising video games script "made in 15min"
---
"You may be dead but you're still rich"
---
Why does this make me laugh. I love it!
---
But why tho? You could've just run for the gates O.o
---
Before I even make any directed comments, I have to ask, what exactly is your field of expertise when it comes to game design?
---
How do I send an error report? I'm new to reddit and just created this account to post this.
---
Holy moly that's a lot of people.
---
That‚Äôs like more then 10 at least!
---
This playerbase is so easily offended, jesus 
---
Dope! :)
---
I was there 
---
As a brown shirt Claudette main, cant relate. 
---
I cant stand the music in the background when playing as killer
---
It was a joke you guys, I'm a PC player myself
---
Im on xbox one. There's a bug that inverts my camera on the y axis. So whenever I try to look up I'll look down and if I try to look down I'll look up. Only happened to me once. 
---
I was worried for a moment because that's the trapper loadout I use.
---
I‚Äôm not sure. You may be able to do it from your Xbox, if not I would try the website next. 
---
This must be console because killers on PC don't have the environmental awareness of an MGS NPC like this guy clearly does.
---
at my hand.
---
* mobile right handed users rise *
---
I'm trying to decide what's worse...
---
Teammates disconnecting or the long ass lobby times.
---
i used to do this, but sometimes my wife's game will crash and it shows as a disconnect. 
---
i guess my point is that not all disconnects are true "salt"
---
lol   Oh, I love corn as survivor. lol
---
L as in legionplayer, that'd be you no? Nonestly nobody who plays something that braindead easymode can touch me with any insults m'dude, you don't even know how much I look down on you people.
---
The problem is that the trash perks are trash, not that the good perks are good. There simply is no reason for you to use something like Coulrophobia when Sloppy Butcher exists because coulrophobia is a meme. They need to stop making meme perks, buff the existing meme perks and then we‚Äôll get a meta change
---
That is also applicable to the person healing me.
---
Just have Bruce give them a call "Hey, you know that deal you made with a game? Why don't ya try extending it to make more money? Everyone wants more money and you don't have to do any of the work." *Shows examples of Ash cosmetic sales.*
---
ha, thanks!! i find it kinda funny that she also was wearing the same shirt under her hoodie üòÇüòÇ what are the odds?
---
Read some lore about it and I was like hot damn I want it
---
1 mettle of man isnt bad but a 4 man death squad with mom adrenaline borrowed time and some exhaustion can really fuck m1 killers
---
we will!! üíúüòÇ
---
The offficial Reddit app instead of BaconReader üò≥
---
it had been bad for days before he came out, its when they changed the matchmaking around is when i saw the massive spike in wait times. i wish it was that but i dont think it is 
---
I‚Äôll quit the game if they add shirtless Mike
---
*I can show you the WOOOOOOOOORLD*
---
It's because I usually get 0 or 1 for Gatekeeper. I'm really good at the 3 gen strat so the games last forever. 
---
Oops didn't see it was already posted. 
---
You don't need eardrum busting volume, just like enough to listen closely and hear ambience
---
I had a couple of people ask - but if you're interested I guess send me a msg and I'll send you a link. I didn't want this to be a spammy post, I was just excited it came in. lol (Not even sure if this kind of comment is allowed.)
---
M.O.M had already been used I'm afraid, it was a clutch perk tho because I would have been downed far from the hatch.
---
Don't sweat not knowing obscure gamer terminology.
---
well i was playing Spirit, had 4 men swf. 2 with MoM, 2 BT, 2 Adrenalines, Dead Hards(not sure how many, probably 1), 2 Iron Wills, DS.
---
my build was: yellow add-ons - one for passive phasing, other for faster phasing activation; BBQ, PgTW, Discordance, Enduring. 
---
map: Asylum, Disturbed Ward.
---
i did not camp, did not tunnel. got 4k. though would be 2k if they didn't chill endgame. but it's cause map was big, couldn't control properly without longer/faster phasing.
---
so yeah, it was fine. not easy, perk is strong. but really much better than old ds.
---

The Plague isn't here but she's taller than The Doctor. Also I'm not sure, but probably the Clown is same height as The Plague.
---
Use Deerstalker to prevent that.
---
I imagine the new rank system is playing a large role in this. Ranking up as survivor is a true test of willpower.
---
Was just about to suggest Panda as he usually runs Blood Warden when he plays as the killer.
---
I was playing a Trapper game where I didn‚Äôt do too well, the survivors got a gate open and I knew they were gonna be there teabagging so to not give them the satisfaction, I went to the other gate and just spammed setting a trap to get points, they didn‚Äôt leave for nearly five minutes. Then finally an Ash got greedy and came over flashlight clicking and wanting to open the other gate, I quickly got him down while he tried disabling a trap and hooked him and the rest all ran out lol
---
I don't play killer but even if I said huntress with instahatchets that camps it would still take more skill than legion.
---
For me it's always a claudette or a nea, they then urban evasion away, only for the killer to chase me instead :(
---
The teammate with all the 2nd chance perks: Perfect
---
Sound is really important to so many games
---
So instead of taking screenshots just do the gens and get out, stop wasting his time.
---
I couldn't find every legion characters, but Susie is taller than The Pig. Here's female killers height. -&gt; \*Source: [https://twitter.com/lump\_of\_meat/status/1106511802710425600](https://twitter.com/lump_of_meat/status/1106511802710425600)
---
I think it should kind of work in the reverse. If you D/C, you should be given a stackable bloodpoint reduction.
---
Welcome to y world, bitch!
---
Must have range addons. DAMN IT HERMAN!
---
It's hard to appreciate the FPS fix when I can't get a game... I tried to play yesterday but got bored after waiting over five minutes for a match in solo queue and went to play Apex instead.
---
Yeah i am i decided to try out the free weekends I actually managed to escape with this glitch lol
---
I've literally brought 2 people in the past to the freaking hatch, and let them wiggle off(so they get even more points) and they still just ran away. Just...I eventually let those games be 4k's.
---
what are you talking about
---
U/LegionIsForRetards everybody üëèüèªüëèüèª round of applause for not even playing killer and arguing a killer based argument üëèüèªüëèüèª I never thought I would meet someone so brave yet so fucking stupid. You heard it here folks, Not moving at all takes more skill than getting a 4k with a c teir killer!! üëèüèªüëèüèª Oh dont forget, because you play a killer you like, you're an asshole!! üëèüèªüëèüèª Because you're *sooo* selfless, you wouldn't mind playing whoever I tell you to, even if you weren't having fun, right? Bc that doesnt matter, right? It's all about being pure and pleasing everyone except for the people who do things for themselves. They bought the game so they could make others happy. Aww. 
---
Redbubble.com
---
I‚Äôm so happy the characters have different heights. I was worried it was different skins on the same model. 
---
Nope killer here and I find it amazing wouldnt have been mad tbh. You learn from mistakes.
---
I was talking about ash not ashy
---
I actually love playing Apex solo, I think it's a lot of fun as long as my teammates aren't complete a*holes. But I'm pretty happy with the game if I get a kill or three or some cool gear, so I'm easy to please. DBD honestly gets less fun every time I try to play it, and now I can't really play it at all due to the long waits, so... :p
---
&gt; thought it always referenced high rank players  
---
I thought it meant that you're getting carried by your team mates. According to Urban Dictionary it's when someone else levels up your character for you, lol. I guess we were both wrong.
---
The way to fix the matchmaking is to revert the pipping changes.
---
Is it free weekend on xbox? Oh boy this weekend is gonna be interesting lol
---
Nice work! I love your art style! \^\^ 
---
What‚Äôs it to you if someone likes the back stories?
---
I feel like Ash is pretty tall. Between Bill and Jake, maybe? On PS4, so I don't have a feel for how tall in-game Bill is.
---
modern day boosted is an insult saying youre being carried by your teammates because you suck imo. 
---
However the perk is bugged and it should count for those. Anything that is a down by a power shouldnt work but basic attacks after use of a power should count. 
---
Its poor quality in terms of both balance and how buggy it is. It just wasnt thought through imo.
---
If I have an Ebony Mori as a last resort, I'm not treating that shit like a one time thing. I'm using it all I can.
---
Hot kinky reverse bear trap sex

Sloppy butcher slows down healing

This is why you ALWAYS use Headphones while playing Killer.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this Trapper was new and just using his default Speakers
---
Happy for you guys. Looks like you have a Wake up! friendship. 
---
..did I do that right ?
---
Buddy we already established you're a retard from just you admitting you play legion, don't have to double down on it by talking like a retard as well.
---
....?
---
Im in western us, my sister was also playing on ps4 last night and all the sudden lobby wait times were close to 30 minutes. I tried to get her to check killer queues but she refuses to play killer 
---
I know you didn't learn Queen Kate out like that
---
i think you did! it sure gave me a giggle üòÇ
---
Come watch me and your girlfriend play. Pornhub.com
---
I would say its OP because it punishes you for using your secondary attack when you shouldn't, and people that don't have secondary attacks cant counter it at all. I would even go to the extent that a 4 man MoM is worse than a 4 man old DS.
---
I never get mad at ashes. I feel like im killing my uncle if i do. 
---
It's the anxiety of killing survivors that make the heart beating so loud. It's the killer's heart. It is proven by devs and also Distressing explains it.
---
We mean peancoil

I often run perkless, I don‚Äôt think this would be a great idea.

So you‚Äôre saying killers have hearts
---
From like \*snif\* the smell.
---
I keep getting this error, along with an error saying my game couldn't be saved, then theres the inability to connect to servers, and getting g kicked back to title screen everytime I try to play killer. What the ever loving faq.

Yes, I do. Not only me though
---
Where‚Äôs my girl Kate at

[http://prntscr.com/n82279](http://prntscr.com/n82279)

Keep in mind that i always play the game in low spec and 0% resolution to get some decent fps in game.The best i can get are in the indoors maps like Lerys and The game max 50fps if my camera is facing a wall and the worst is Shelter woods which i get like 22-27 on the other maps i get like 25-40 depends what my camera looks
---
Nobody made fun of the killer, don't know what you're talking about buddy.
---
Possibly 
---
I think Dbd you have way more control. Granted you can‚Äôt kill the killer but you can waste ample amounts of time to get you an escape 
---
Also another tip, and if guilty of this myself, swinging too early. You can get those lunge shots by holding attack but might have been faster to not swing. The fakeouts with the plag‚Äôs ability were nice tho. 
---
will you *dance with me perk* @ prom üòÅ 
---
Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
omg should i crosspost this?? also, thanks for sharing a new awesome sub!!
---
I use it on all of my killers. It offers good information and makes the obsession scared of you. 
---
Better than NOED? Not really.
---
Make it a hex? No.
---
np! üíú
---
Hopefully Susie O.o
---
Well, that's very unfortunate. The game is, indeed, not suitable for hearing impaired people. The best way I know how to effectively find a downed survivor is by thinking where would I go and listening carefully. Less often I find them by blood tracks.
---
I use knock out in my friendly build for the same reason you don‚Äôt run it. The easier they can find them the less time it wastes, K.O forces them to decide between searching and saving or loosing a teammate. Corrupt I‚Äôd toss personally and replace it with Infectious, and Thana for K.O.
---
Let‚Äôs see I know he‚Äôs dying around here somewhere...
---
*checks locker*
---
Dude, that is EXACTLY what I'm saying. Glad for the dlcs, use content from almost all of it... but the game has become cripplingly grindy for it and something needs to be done to mitigate it.
---
I dont think reducing perks to only having one level (suggested in comments here and elsewhere) is practical... new players would run out of perks to buy before hitting lvl 50 on a starting character.
---
However, since its purchased dlc, and reachable perks... I think we should be able to say who our character teach or learn from. Makes sense as a mechanic that would cut down on the soul numbing grind as well as something that fits what's going on between characters.
---
Lmfao
---
at first its kinda shit playing like this but you will get used to it,also keep in mind that thanks to optimization they did for low specs pcs  my fps increased because usually i had like 12-15FPS in shelter woods.Your laptop may be heating enough but don't worry I've been playing the game for like a year and nothing serious happened to my laptop
---
Add that to the list of reasons that grouping up on gens is a bad idea.
---
Cuteee üòç
---
I'll tame that beast
---
Right? He should be insulting the Bill for not being good. Wasting that pallet, trying to pallet thing head on instead of doing it to the side of the killer, and not running to the exit straight after getting hit. 
---
If I had to guess, they had that offering equipped during the event and have not played the doctor since (which would explain why they're rank 20 with hardly any perks). The game prevents you from equipping a new one, but there's a possibility it did not remove the one they already had equipped.
---
Why dont they just make the base game free but charge the DLCs?
---
The new DS rework is looking good
---
It does say Y to leave, but you can use controllers on PC, so you can't really be sure just by looking.
---
I just read the lore from that I want to know more about vigo and his lab. That's crazy. 
---
Another promise, thrown into the dirt and stomped on. 
---
Oh well, at least we might get those Rank 1 rewards soon right? Right?
---
You should take Knockout, swap Thanataphobia out for it. 
---
I wasnt sure if it would change the appearance in game for the button. I play some older games on steam with a controller but never noticed if it changed what the prompts are. That's cool that it does that though 
---
This belongs in r/mashup
---
Damn, Huntress a big bitch
---
That's awsome *--*
---
They don't really test stuff out. Just look at the new emblem system for example.
---
What is Legion?  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 
---
It had the same fundamental problem that release DS had. Everyone basically has a get out of jail free card and despite MoM having a downside you can work around it and literally never have that effect. Once everyone get it you‚Äôll see everyone running it like they did when DS came out because there is not downside and rewards you for losing a chase. 
---
My field of expertise is detecting that you are the kind of person who would not complain even if you find a stir-stick made of poop in your 10$ coffee.
---
In addition, the fact that bugs persist for months before anything gets done(People are getting stuck at trees for 2 months now), but cosmetics still come at a steady and microtransaction-based rate.
---
I fully understand that making promises as a dev is hard, but I also understand that never following up on any hints is like the usual "Yeah I'll pay you back next month" every month, but then still, there is nothing happening, and the customer then is entiteled to demand answers.
---
Oh and btw, what does field of expertise have to do with being disappointed after expecting nothing? Whether you work in the field or not doesn't change anything about it. You constantly asking this just shows you want to avoid the problem. Instead of asking such empty and pointless questions, I'd appreciate if you would write down your oppinion and points to make a valid claim, otherwise, how am I supposed to understand what you think? At that point I can't help you much or have any good conversation about the topic. 
---
I too am disappointed of the state of the game, yes. And if you know something that could justify its state, then please tell it to people, that literally is the fastest way to change someones mind. Right now, I am just not seeing what could possibly justify it at all, and I don't seem to be the only one, I know people who just ignore it, but ignorance has given power to EA, and I do not wish to see the same happen with any other dev team.
---
Would The Plague already count as a cultist? 
---
Agreed, wish the incompetent devs at BhVR would take a coding class or something, on PS4 and even solo wait times are outrageous, forget about SWF
---
I imagine survivors must have been really confused with your hit &amp; run playstyle.
---
Is legion a trap?
---
Gosh, imagine, just imagine, if the puppet was doing it too.  
---
I wonder if we can pester BHVR enough to make them animate the puppet, having it copy Ash' exact movements.
---
&gt; they've most likely smurfed down on purpose.
---
idk they pretty obviously have no idea what they were doing, not even touching the objective.. being loosely aware of the idea of flashlight saves and sabo'ing doesn't mean they weren't properly rank 15.
---
Lol
---
He has A S C E N D E D
---
If you pull the plug, you're DC'ed from the match.  If you just click "leave", you're taken to the end game screen and can chat.
---
As Killer, I've hit r1, thought it took *much* longer than normal.
---
As Survivor, I'm suck at r8/9. As a solo Survivor, pipping at purple ranks is far too demanding. I'm not great, but based on my emblems; I 'd have been around r4 by now, if it weren't for the new system.      
---
She's a priestess. Im talking more ancient aztec human sacrifice thing
---
No wonder Claudette is so good at hiding lol. Her natural camouflage and small stature are a really powerful combination. 
---
well until he gets a change then i think he deserves to be complained about not that i complain about it personally
---
I keep safety pipping with 3Ks. I hate tunneling and don't camp. 2 or 3 generators left, last survivor finds hatch. It's a bit disheartening to feel like I had multiple great games but only safety pip in them. You need a 93% in the class to pass now.
---
I played a match of survivor yesterday and got the gas station map. Ran to a gen and saw the totem literally siting in front of the gen. Poor Huntress got gen rushed and only killed the ace. ;-;
---
My hero.
---
Reporting them in-game is always fine, but since you have a video, you can send it in here:   [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) 
---
If you file a ticket under "Additional player report information", the rest will be pretty clear. You can upload the video to YouTube, Google Drive, or any other site that lets you share videos and stick the link in the description.
---
Very very rarely is a match load D/C salt because honestly you have no idea who the killer is and it doesn't cause a depip (as far as I know) so it would be useless for de-ranking. These ones are almost always unintentional or emergency DCs. The in-match ones are almost always salt with the rare exception of that player who DCs because they're playing the game on Jupiter.
---
Don't turn the volume up that high.
---
This is from 2016...
---
Damn, I really thought Myers and Huntress were pretty tall, Doc never struck me as a super tall dude.
---
Must be a killer main
---
why farm its so goddarn boring
---
Dude a drowned sailor with harpoon would awesome
---
I dont know. I'm on the fence with the whole disconnecting thing. There are plenty of situations where the player who DC's simply because they are a poor sport ei not liking the killer or being downed really early or early fast. I definitely agree that that is a big no no. But I've been in many games where I think disconnecting is perfectly acceptable. 
---
For example last night I decided to play a bit. I was downed and placed on a hook. No big deal. I usually don't survive anyway. But then I see all three teammates are racing towards me with the killer right on their heels. Sure enough they unhook me directly in front of the killer and I'm instantly downed and rehooked.  I disconnected right away. I dont have time for that kind of gameplay. Another example, a few nights ago I load into a match, starting with another player. They begin vaulting a window beside the generator I'm working on. The killer of course comes over so I run and hide. My teammate then decides to lock me in a corner, refusing to move and just pointing at me. And the cherry on top? They threw a firecracker at me, bringing the killer to us and of course the killer downs and hooks me. Yeah no. I dont have time for that kind of game. Again I disconnected. I'm sure there are those who will say too bad so sad. It's a game. And you're right. I'm here to have fun. If my team couldn't care less about my fun then I couldn't care less about sticking around. 
---
Only if you're an idiot. 
---
I'm not an idiot.
---
Is this at least supposed to be fixed once dedicated servers hit?
---
lol the way he just smacks you when you try the crouching juke is hilarious
---
I‚Äôve had it activate in a good majority of my games.
---
Someone here actually made a cool idea of how they could rework it
---
Gonna go look for it and post it here
---
The real quastion, did he teabagged him ?
---
well it would be kinda overpowered to be a 4.6 movement speed killer with a zero terror raduis thats endless
---
David really could just take Freddy on tbh
---
really
---
Which is what I'm saying. I imagine nearly all "Legion bad" posts would be gone when Legion gets his problems ironed out.
---
Yeah like, sorry that you burned streamers with the intention of getting everyone to farm, but I'd rather just play my game and move on to the next one.
---
I noticed it to. 
---
what that the shard count is a perfect number?
---
That still happens, admittedly rarely, to me at Rank 7 on PS4.
---
I even had a Killer that was off-hook tunneling someone AROUND the gen I was working on. I even got in front of them during the chase to try and body block them into a corner but they managed to walk around me (still refusing to injure me) and down the tunneled Survivor who instantly DC'ed.
---
It was Legion too, so there was no intelligent excuse not to just smack me with Frenzy and then chase the Survivor they were tunneling. They were a Rank 3 Killer too.
---
Definitely the exception rather than the rule, but how players like that can stay at Rank 3 on PS4  baffles me.
---
I didn‚Äôt complain lmao, I was offering a solution in the wake of people complaining. Also I clearly mentioned that my ‚Äúidea‚Äù which was the original state of the game that people being shitty people alone ruined... didn‚Äôt solve the rank issue which would be something to worked on separately. I‚Äôve had 0 issues with their changes, 0 issues with playing, and 0 issues on how they go forward. Every one of my complaints has been player based because I have an understanding of the difficulty they face fixing issues which to simple people ‚Äúbroke‚Äù the game. To that note I‚Äôm grateful one of the devs even bothered responding to explain that it was part of the original system, and (in my words not theirs) much like many of the other issues with this game stems not from the game itself, but the players abusing mechanics, just like people abuse the ranking system.
---
Why would that matter.
---
We don't need to buff a camping perk. If they did , they'll just go for saves faster. 
---
Mad Survivor : "Reported for camping, no skill loser, they ban people like you"
---
Killer : "Oh do they now? Mind showing me where you got this piece of information?"
---
Mad Survivor : " My dad told be cause he works at BHVR kid"
---
Rest of the chat : "......what the actual fuck?"
---
[You get it here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/zoxyty/comments/b9vjyo/exclusive_shirt/)
---
bloodlust is probably the most garbage thing about this game takes so long to stack up that its basically useless for any good killer
---
I had a dumbass Jane like this last game, useless and got the least amount of points. 
---
Why would it be endless? I'm just saying it shouldn't have a cooldown and just refresh for every hit on the obsession. 
---
I always thought that event was hinting at the next killer, with Benedict Baker going through grotesque physical changes after being bitten by that rat... but then we got Legion, lol. 
---
Then when they teased the Plague as being the "oldest" time period I thought it might be an origins chapter with Vigo/Benedict, but again, nothing. 
---
You want the power the perk brings? You gonna take the risk as well. 
---
Wow, you did horrible, though. You were lucky they were so bad, man. Like, you see a guy with a flashlight chasing you, you down someone and they're still around... and you set yourself up for a flashlight save. Again, it's a good thing they were worse.
---
I‚Äôve gone from rank 13 to 3 with the new system as survivor. But I also play a lot and primarily with swf. I think if you actually care to rank up you have to be with a good swf group. As a solo player, good luck.
---
you should swap corrupt intervention for ruin its pretty garbage most of the time
---
gosh, like i understand, it's ok to be immersed sometimes, but please don't make that some kind of ritual and put your team at a disadvantage
---
I'm glad others appreciate this piece as much as I did. It is by far the best version so far, imo.
---
I could listen to it like a normal song outside of a game. 
---
PC
---
Ingame
---
Skulls from broken totems causing Billy to shoot off in random directions when ran over during a chainsaw sprint, and turning Billy invisible and removing sounds from his chainsaw and terror radius when he walks over skulls while charging his chainsaw.  
---
The perks needs a total rework which I hope will happen with the mid-chapter patch. Making survivors die on hook faster encourages hook camping as the killer is punished less for it. 
---
Instead of making the hook transition faster, the perk should do something like grant tokens similar to BBQ that provide unique effects for every survivor hooked on a specific hook. Perhaps the hooks could look different &amp; would provide an incentive for survivors to sabotage these specific hooks. 
---
He brings a whole new meaning to pallet camping.
---
I'm playing normaly albeit the waiting times for a match. This happens a lot to me too, it works after I unplug/plug the internet cable 
---
Here‚Äôs the comment link https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b9q1zj/_/ek6o74o/?context=1
---
Yeah. Mine was also the remember me obsession.
---
r/lostredditors
---
It shouldn't be. That's the error message that will usually appear when Steam/PSN/Xbox Live are down, but they all seem to be up and running perfectly.
---
I mean I'm not sure how long that effect lasted because it got her out the exit gatea
---
Unless he had normal movement speed this would make the killer have the same problem he did in the ptb
---
Probably a Legion one-trick trying to dabble ¬Ø\_„ÉÑ_/¬Ø
---
Darn they alredy unlocked the teachebles
---
Sounds like a bug
---
Clearly a gamebreaking bug against Freddy.  My advice avoid playing him until they patch this out of the game.  I did.
---
I'm not sure about that. my game crashed when i was opening a gate. I probably got reported for that, but at least I have recording in case I get banned.
---
hag is taller than the nurse?
---
Lol those are both the outfits I use on feng and David 
---
You forget about Treatment? He stands completely straight. He‚Äôs tall so he‚Äôs scarier when in treatment and looks insane when in Punishment.
---
Myers, Pig, and Wraith can all make some use out of fog to sneak up on people. Trapper and Hag can also use the fog to hide their traps. The thing is that it barely helps and it's not like being unseen helps when I also can't fucking see the Survivors.
---
Honestly only playing killer for faster bp to drop into my survivor web. I kept getting games where survivors would DC on their team because I'm only rank 15 with killer. So I figured I'd let everyone make it out for the evening. Still got plenty of bp for it. 
---
Yup a horrible one haha.  Done playing Freddy until they fix this.  The worst thing is my Remember Me obsession was non stop bm with teabags and flashlight spamming all game.  Becoming literally invincible against my killer with this bug couldn't have happened to a nicer guy lol.
---
You seriously think that asking about empty statements whining about everything? If he would have complained about flashlights, that would be whining, this is questioning the devs statements and requesting fixes. 
---
"Oh the factory-new car you bought has a light that isn't working? Hmm, I'll maybe think about fixing it, now stop whining about it and give me money" &lt;-- This is what you are saying on the devs behalf.
---
yeah.. I should just shut up and accept this, sounds fair.
---
I ran NOED 2 on my Hag for awhile and would get a lot of hate for it. Sorry but my only other options are Bloodhound and Iron Grasp this is kinda the best I've got. üòÖ
---
I‚Äôm not certain but I think you stole this build from a YouTuber 
---
True 
---
That's what I eventually did but holy shit it's not fun to play Plague without good perks and add-ons. I wish I didn't have to
---
No. Because then killers will only ever choose totems that are covered in three sides, greatly reducing the risk involved in taking the perk in the first place. Again, you want that power, you take the risk with the randomization of the hex spawn. 
---
No, if hook timers are shorter everyone will camp.
---
Someone clowned me for using BloodHound the other day. The perk is barely good, but nowhere near useful enough for anyone to complain about and it‚Äôs all i‚Äôve got. Guess I should just use weak perks?
---
That's cause with prove thyself in 1.5 gennies you can max out your objective. 8k vs the average 1250 if you solod one Genny is huge. 
---
NOED is a crutch and this is coming from a Killer main. Not only is it very easily removed but it only activates in the late game, and often you'll never get to the point that NOED activates because you kill 3 people and the last Survivor gets the hatch.
---
I'd honestly say that NOED is a B tier perk or low A tier at best. It's overly oppressive but it isn't active for a large portion of the game.
---
I kinda had a similar feeling about Decisive Strike to be honest. DS just gave you a free escape, and for those who were good at looping it was overly oppressive but for the average player it was a wasted perk slot just to effectively have to be hooked 4 times instead of 3.
---
I don't want to go too deep into NOED's problems right now.
---
Gorillaz!! ü§ò

Maybs a finger or two Up the Ante as well!

There were no flashlights in the Zhou dynasty however, so he didn't have a flashlight to click in the assassin's face repeatedly. 0/10 Rank 20 Emperor.

Jing Ke (? ‚Äì 227 BC) was a retainer of Crown Prince Dan of the Yan state and renowned for his failed assassination attempt of King Zheng of the Qin state, who later became Qin Shi Huang, China's first emperor (reign from 221 BC to 210 BC). His story is told in the chapter entitled Biographies of Assassins (Âà∫ÂÆ¢ÂàóÂÇ≥) in Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian.

Which killer? Mine was Leatherface (maybe there's a pattern or something)
---
Guess so
---
Cool?
---
The funnier part of all this, is that these failure all happened at rank 15, they had to go to low rank to be toxic to new/unexperienced killers. When I'm just chilling with my doc at rank 16, every time I get this, I just put someone on the hook and hard ass face camp, love the salt pos game
---
Mettle of Man, Sprint Burst/Dead Hard, Adrenaline, and still Self-Care
---
WELCOME TO PRIME TIME BITCH is my 2 cents.
---
Rank 4 as survivor and 2 as killer. Been there forever. 
---
In that case, buffing them to 115% wouldn't be bad.
---
If we could have Jack Torrance from The Shining that‚Äôd be great. Maybe something like ‚ÄúThe Caretaker‚Äù
---
*pallet stuns* "bitch". 
---
I don‚Äôt think they would do that but I definitely see changing from everyone standing to sitting on a log. Then we could have the log animations up close.
---
Rather than specific lines, I'd like to point out their personalities that voice lines would stem from. I'm sure these are all well known by the community at this point but hey.
---
Dwight would be scared shitless 24/7. Every line would be him with a shakey voice and wondering if what he's doing is even safe.
---
Meg would be cocky I think, taunting killers before sprint bursting away.
---
Claudette would be kind and caring despite her toxic view among the community. She'd always be trying to keep people calm and focused in the soft, reassuring kind of voice.
---
I actually prefer Jake as a mute. I think he's too reserved and in himself to bother speaking since he's lived on his own in the wilderness for so long.
---
My baby Nea would be sharp-tongued and snarky, the only correct attitude for a rebellious street artist.
---
Ace would obviously be nonchalant about everything, not even breaking a sweat with most of his lines.
---
Feng would be scared slightly but trying her best to stay calm and level headed.
---
Laurie would be just like she is in the movie obviously, scared but determined and steeled.
---
David would be confrontational even with other Survivors, not willing to trust anyone but himself.
---
Tapp would be stoic and a sort of leader among the group.
---
Quentin would be level headed but clumsy and sort of slur his lines, given he's tired all the time. 
---
Kate would be generic country girl #66322883
---
Adam would be level headed almost to a fault, trying his best to filter everything around him through his years of academia.
---
Jeff would be quiet and reserved, but not afraid to speak up when he needs too.
---
Jane would shout at thing in the stereotypical feisty Latino way.
---
Bill would be as he is in L4D, tired of all THIS BULLSHIT.
---
And last AND LEAST, if they add in full line for Ash, he'd be cocky and confident as in the movies. Groovy.
---
That pig.... May I use it as a gamerpic on xbox?
---
Love that we‚Äôre calling a highly situational perk and a perk that is also highly situational and has little time played yet, bullshit. Real classy 
---
Can't really blame me given the quality I see
---
Stop ignoring everything he says and saying the same cookie cutter response ;)
---
And of course not a single gen is done in this time.
---
I'm honestly more confused than annoyed when I get these kinds of Survivors. Like why should I be mad that you guys are all running around me instead of doing your objective and escaping?
---
G'dang that would ruin the cake. Also where can I find this lore?
---
Yeah it was pretty decent, good low-budget sci-fi
---
So, it doesn't change his accomplishment, he survived
---
THEN JUST SAY FART
---
Next game over is Senran Kagura 
---
You didn‚Äôt have time to wait 3 seconds for the entity to kill you?  Because if you were immediately put on your second hook you could just not struggle and the game would end immediately.  Same effect as a DC but you get a fistful of bloodpoints and break a hook.
---
Ds isnt a problem for me. I havent been hit once since the nerf. Its unfortunate though. It was a great perk.  
---
I feel the survivor who is being hook camped should not de-pip at least because a lot of times they do nothing wrong
---
Didn‚Äôt know the doctor was a BBC
---
Would love a good AHS themed Killer
---
I wanted to watch it but then I saw that it stars a fucking P3 Claudette. No thanks
---
Thanks 
---
You take memes pretty seriously. Kinda comes off as sad 
---
But that's the point of being a survivor, the side that uses the brain is the killer, survivor have to run around and annoy the killer, not even survive, dbd is meant to die 2 survivors and 2 escape more or less, so yeah, I don't see the problem in that
---
A fun idea would be to have the obsession carry any TR perk effects with them like Unnerving,Coulrophobia etc. This would make for an interesting perk since it would help cause dissruption without you being near other survivors and you could be off doing your thing, also this would justify the small duration and the cooldown requirement.
---
Geez, that was a joke, lighten up.
---
I thought you were asking a question, sorry.
---
I bet you Sprint bursted towards your window of opportunity. I bet there was plenty of adrenaline and tenacity as well, you sure showed your iron will and calm spirit with this one. I have a detective's hunch that you two will have fun. 
---
Thank for enduring this comment (and yes I know it's a killer perk worked too well)
---
But seriously have fun also I could have gone for longer lol
---
Try Hex: Thrill of the Hunt and your favorite Hex perk/s. It's a thing of beauty.
---
Not as sad as taking the internet equivalent of a sopping shit in the middle of the living room floor and then smiling and asking to be praised for it
---
WTF. Dude, that's my design you POS.
---
I only wished the looked like that when they smacked my ass
---
Who‚Äôs asking for praise? It‚Äôs flaired shitpost. It‚Äôs a shitty post. I think you‚Äôve got a little too much time on your hands. Have a nice day 
---
If a semi-decent Legion decides to tunnel you... then you are going down baby.
---
I'm a simple gal. I see shirtless Myers, I upvote.
---
Holy shit I‚Äôm blind. 
---
His mind was blown
---
Ability to pick lobby music when?
---
I swear I had two people on the poster but all I see is Dwight and a floating body. Not sure what happened 
---
Maybe we should be nice to (possibly) new players joining the community? Could mean shorter wait times at mid and high ranks once they learn how to actually play. Just sayin ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Am I seeing things or does feng have a tail
---
For my healthy state of mind, what comedy have you achieved from this?
---
DC
---
I disagree, taking 3 pallets over 2 can actually make a pretty big difference.
---
None at all because until servers come out I‚Äôm just going to be clicking invite every single time I play with a friend. Depressing really. 
---
Ill take it.
---
 sad man
---
I'm starting to believe killers use "sorry, daily" to excuse being a complete asshole lmao.
---
It already does do that I believe. 
---
The thing is lasting for only 20 seconds doesn't really disrupt anything. It's too short to have a significant effect. Maybe it would be useful for the doctor if he wants to force the obsession to become mad.
---
Unnerving presence doesn't really do much at higher ranks &amp; coulrophobia's effect won't really matter as the obsession only has to wait 20 seconds for the effect to dissipate. 
---
By the time he finds someone to heal him or use self-care then the perks effect has stopped. 
---
Interestingly, if you down someone with infectious freight, do people around the obsession including the obsession scream? 
---
That would be interesting but then again you rely on downing someone within 20 seconds of hitting the obsession which is near impossible to do unless the other survivor is injured.
---
That‚Äôs the point
---
Yes we went over this

---
i swear that's how all nurse games go when there is a pumpkin head nurse
---
Try to not break the chase and using safe loops (killer shack/building with safe windows/etc) . what most people don't notice is that he's actually slow to down someone who knows what to do. By the time you're down, there should be popping 2 gens or 1 and 1/2 . I actually like to be against a Legion, is a 75% safety exit 
---
I agree, Rajah on this season makes me want to puke. Can‚Äôt wait for her to sashay the fuck AWAY. 
---
Since you don‚Äôt have the plague, I‚Äôm guessing you also don‚Äôt have Jane?
---
I swear survivor mains have one hand on their internet cord ready to disconnect at any moment. They can‚Äôt ever disrespect a good play
---
Benedict Baker, seeing as to how he was caught by the entity during the hallowed blight I would love to see him as puppet the entity uses to channel its powers and torment survivors.
---
Discordance is shit. Especially the tier 3 version of it. The longer the timer for it goes up the worse it gets. Especially if people figure out that you have it in your loadout. Survivors can fuck with you the whole game. 2 people work on a gen, you get the notification but wait, they're not on it anymore. Not that you would know until you get there because the gen stays yellow for 12 seconds. That perk is useless.
---
Or sometimes Jake. I'm not saying it's because I main Jake when I'm survivor, but...
---
Sorry.

That is the problem with the game, survivors should be the one that should have to use the brain, since the killer is meant to be the power role, but killers arent. It's dumb

---
* Survivors being affected by a **Hex Totem** for forty seconds, or staying alive for thirty. Stackable. 
---
* Survivors interacting with a **False Object.** 
---
**The Narrator** can place up to three of each **False Object** based on the Discord tiers. False objects will vanish after being interacted with for ten seconds. 
---
* **Tier 1:** Place false chests, lit totems, and dropped items.
---
* **Tier 2:** Place false generators, lockers, and hatches. 
---
* **Tier 3:** Summon false Survivors and false Narrators. They‚Äôll walk forward until they hit something and vanish. 
---
* **Tier 4:** The Narrator‚Äôs Terror Radius is reduced to 0 for 15 seconds every time a Survivor is healed from the injured/dying state. Survivors will hear false Terror Radiuses based on their proximity to each other. They will also receive incorrect information in their HUD regarding generators, status effects, and the conditions of other survivors. False Narrators will generate at random near Survivors and walk around aimlessly.
---
When Discord increases a Tier, every Survivor is alerted by the *Twilight Zone* theme. 
---
# Perks
---
**Time Element -** For every 30/25/20 seconds 2 or more survivors are within 10 meters of each other, regress all generators by 1/2/3%.
---
**Revival -** Every time a survivor is healed from the injured or dying state by another survivor, gain a token up to two tokens. 2 tokens can be consumed by hitting a hooked survivor. Once consumed, the survivor and the one who unhooks them will suffer from **Broken** once unhooked for 15/20/25 seconds. 
---
**Hex: Another Dimension -** While the lit totem is active, 2/3/4 lit totems will be silent and appear as dull totems. Survivors will not receive notifications of Hex Totems‚Äô status effects. 
---
you essentially do as it has to be a double pip if i'm not mistaken which certainly needs all emblems to be on the cusp of iridescent
---
Cole Phelps survivor when
---
I would love that. I would get him in a heartbeat. 
---
Dude playing Cannibal on Red ranks is a sweaty mess. There's no good or bad when it comes to a shit tier Killer and Survivors who know how to play.
---
An interesting question about Infectious Fright. I agree though, Dark Devotion needs some tweaking or reworking to make it good.
---
Don‚Äôt tunnel and DS is worthless
---
They can't lose if they disconnect 4head. GG EZ Babykiller.
---
Seriously though, it might be funny looking back on this at them getting wrecked but imagine when they go against a player who doesn't win. Then they tbag at the exit gates and tell the person to kill theirself post game. It drives people away.
---
Funny how survivors disconnect if the killer is doing something they don't like but it's ok for swf to play toxic like this.
---
I hate how hag looks standing lolol
---
What's the point with good fps if you only get to enjoy it in the lobby, waiting for games?
---
Are you Japanese?
---
Let's get down to business  
---
to defeat  
---
the *Hags*
---
Same thing with flashlight saves 
---
Not gonna lie sounds cool but it would be a licensed killer so they should take the powers and call it the magician or something
---
Same thing with flashlights
---
*Edit: Probably fixing that comment.
---
Lol why does the Chineses got such cool stories about winning wars doing bizarre shit. I mean imagine you're a soldier in a big army arrinving ready to fight the enemy's army, but all you find is the commander drinking tea and welcoming you. 
---
Ok, told the guys to bring the memetic agent.
---
Worse than DS
---
Is that a new perk I smell?
---
If your mind game game is decent then you might not need the enduring fury combo, but those to are good additions if you want to brute force play. Since it seems you‚Äôre into the spirit mind games, I‚Äôd probably suggest Discordance, Monitor, and another 2 (Whispers I guess since you‚Äôre fond of it and BBQ maybe or something like Devour. Sky‚Äôs the limit) Monitors gonna help you get gen grabs a lot and Discordance gives you info on where the survivors are. The reason I pick that over Surveillance is Surveillance just shows when it‚Äôs interrupted and they can quickly one tap a gen and book. However if they want to be getting stuff done quickly and you‚Äôre applying decent pressure to the team they‚Äôll need to have a few people on a gen most of the time. 
---
Sure! I dont know how youd do that, but go ahead :)
---
first time picking up meg to mess around with sprint burst i failed a check
---
I'm pretty sure it's not easy to fix an error in the games code. But they always fix things like that.
---
You don't need to prestige. Every time you complete your blood web at 50 it resets. So you can keep grinding the blood web to get your perks you want (took me appx 19 resets to get self-care on one of my chars)
---
You still look great anyway, there's nothing wrong with a guy being feminine at all!
---
no, you don't need to prestige. the perks will appear in your bloodweb if you continue "leveling" up the character
---
Rush gens, get out. If the Legion wants you dead, then you'll die.

No thats her foot my bad üòÖ

AHHH thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Nah. Just a weeb with a couple Japanese lessons and Google translate :p
---
He wanted you to get triggered and it seems like it worked. Just report for dc and forget about it.
---
Barbeque and Chili from Leatherface for permanent double bloodpoints and finding survivors. Spirit Fury from the Spirit (especially paired with Enduring) helps with loops. If you're on PC: Monitor and Abuse from the Doctor to sneak up on people and Hex: Ruin from the Hag to get time. I think those are universally considered good. 
---
A lot of others come down to personal preference. I like Rancor from the Spirit and Make Your Choice from the Pig, because they're fun and can be powerful, but that comes down to how you play. Bamboozle from the Clown is also good. To find survivors, Surveillance from the Pig and Discordance from the Legion are good.
---
I used a bloody party streamer and it went into an infinite loading screen
---
i may have totally looked up your Instagram, this piece is too cute!! üò≠ how long did it take you to finish? i've always struggled like crazy with digital painting.
---
Is legion worth getting?
---
What do you mean by reset exactly?
---
It doesn‚Äôt annoy me as much as pre-nerf DS but it‚Äôs definitely up there 
---
I had the same thing happen on Xbox. Looking at the DbD forums the survivors played, killer, and map played aren't consistent with the bug. I'm thinking it has to do with a perk perhaps. People have mentioned a few times they had teammates with boil over (same here) so maybe that bugs your teammates or something.
---
Of the top 10 posts at the moment, 3 are basic memes.
---
Eh. The instant pallet break is the real strength, and even at level 1 it's great. Enduring is the bigger variable for Spirit Fury imo.
---
Right now, if I'm not mistaken, the penalty for disconnecting is to double de-pip and lose your offering. I believe in fact you can save the item and add-ons you were going to lose by disconnecting.
---
The problem with this is obvious, people who are willing to DC don't care about rank, or at least feel they can make it up in the next game quicker. As the OP said, a lot of streamers are dcing to get content and not just sit on a hook, others don't like a specific killer and would rather move on to another game. Therefore the solution seems to be very simple: timed ban.
---
In League of Legends, dodging a queue or disconnecting from a game results in a 5 minute game ban, you cannot queue up either solo or with a party for that time. Multiple dodges or dcs within a period of time result in longer time bans, something like 20 minutes for the next one and so on. If you're then doing it consistently across multiple sessions, the dev's hand you a extended ban with a written warning.
---
This is exactly what DBD needs. Survivors who want to dodge and start another game will be less willing if they have to wait, speeding up to their next game is the whole reason they're dcing this one. And streamers will absolutely be deterred from dcing, no streamer wants to be sitting outside the game whilst their viewers get bored.
---
Whether BHVR can implement this now is of course an issue, but surely with the switch to dedicated servers in the summer, at least doing something to deter or properly punish dcing should be high on their priorities.

Oohhh  infectious fright sounds great. I never thought about that one. Sounds promising!

BBQ for points and info.

Discordance for info.    
---
Bamboozle stopping vault loops.    
---
Spirit Fury to brute force loops.     
---
    
---
IMO anything else is really preference I feel or just used on build tryouts. 
---
I copy the picture, go into the xbox app and just crop it.
---
It‚Äôs the same hitboxes I bet. 
---
Idk, maybe you should try perks that could actually help you during the game, not the ones that can possibly work after gens are done?
---
üòÇ‚ú®
---
When you fill out the vloodweb it "resets" you back to 50 with a new bloodweb.
---
"Refresh" would probably be a better word for it. Each time you complete the web at 50 it refreshes and give you a new blood web to complete. That way your character can stay at 50 and keep learning new perks and gaining new items. 
---
I hope I explained that right. I have trouble explaining stuff sometimes. Lemme know if you have any other questions!
---
I don't think the Entity could command someone like Satan, the king of hell.
---
Idk, maybe I want an end game build? Im getting scrutinized for even mentioning NOED so its whatever.
---
Not always. Me and a buddy (same city, different houses) were playing with a 3rd friend in a different country. Me and buddy both DC at the same time as assume killer DC'd (re-affirmed by post match screen). However, 3rd friend asks why we both quit mid match at the same time. They've got some mid game DC issues as well as all their loading crashes.
---
Fact
---
youre too kind üò≠üíû and i wholly agree with that! same with women being masculine. just gotta live and let live!
---
That‚Äôs not an endgame build, that‚Äôs ‚ÄúI fucked up in the game and want at least one kill‚Äù build. 
---
And then they immediately know you have it. Wihich renders the perk useless against people that know how to play the game. If I'm chilling on a gen minding my business and a killer comes right the fuck to me the very second a second person touches my gen you make it so obvious that you're using it. We can then spend the rest of the match fucking with you while other gens get done and waste your time. Ggezbabykiller
---
I‚Äôve been looking at Sloppy butcher and it would definitely combo well with Nurses,  not to mention better tracking while haunting. 
---
I tend to avoid getting pallet stunned so that‚Äôs why enduring doesn‚Äôt work so well with me.
---
so you chase people down and target them to show them that you‚Äôre better than them in an asymmetrical game where one killer will always beat one survivor
---
Refresh is probably the better word. 
---
Every time you complete the blood web at 50 it refreshes. 
---
This means you can stay at 50 and grind out perks and items without having to prestige. 
---
Sorry I used the wrong wording lol. 
---
There problem is that because it's not usable against every killer, there's no pressure on the devs to nerf it for how overbearing it is against every m1 killer.
---
Make your choice-The Pig
---
Franklins demise-The Cannibal
---
BBQ and Chili-The Cannibal
---
Fire up-The Nightmare Not as good
---
Blood Warden-The Nightmare
---
Rancor-The Spirit 
---
Hex: Haunted Grounds-The Spirit
---
Discordance-The Legion
---
Iron Maiden-The Legion
---
These are some of my personal favorites . Please take that into account
---
It‚Äôs still generally good for finding progressing gens
---
I liked the idea, make a viable build specific for gens and people actually gonna be concerned about each survivor roles, though this can be frustating in solo.. I really liked the idea, wish we could test in PTB
---
Stuck as 1 on both sides and its a nightmare since as a killer I can barely get into a game and as a survivor I get rank 10 teammates against rank 1 killers.
---
I can't really answer that, because all the killers are worth or not worth getting depending on personal preference. He's not a bad killer and also not with the best. A lot of people don't like playing against him, when they don't know how to play around him and because he can be played particularly unfairly. If you're new to the game, he's probably not a good one to start with and I'd recommend playing the standard killers before you make a purchase decision to get a feel for the game and find out what you like about it. If you want to buy something, Leatherface is a good choice because of Barbecue and Chili getting you loads of points to unlock perks and because he's a simple killer to learn the game with. 
---
this isnt even real and i want it nerfed
---
it‚Äôs a martyr situation there. i‚Äôve seen people kill themselves on hook because they‚Äôre being camped like they don‚Äôt want the rest of us to prosper. 
---
And how many "I fucked up multiple times this trial and want to escape" builds do you face at high ranks? Quite abit. 
---
And who gives a shit? Its 16 perks vs 4. Not everyone plays this game super optimal.
---
It‚Äôs mean to just taunt at the exit gate and fuck with the killer like that, he clearly already had a bad match and a toxic survivor is just going to ruin his day.  Just leave when you finish all gens and rescue people that you can
---
You should at least back up your answer with your reasons.....
---
I can relate. Been practicing 360‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôve avoided abusing mechanics up until now and nearly every game I‚Äôm told I suck at 360‚Äôs. My reply is the same as this meme lol. 
---
I love to stream as well. Glad you're making it work!
---
I think the big thing about posting your link under here that drives a lot of negative criticism and "no" from people is that it's seen as a form of self-promotion and if everyone posted their stream here we wouldn't be able to enjoy the other discussions and content that's produced. 
---
I think there might be reddit communities that are more oriented towards posting "going live" messages (I know of a few discord communities that do that as well) I just don't think that's the kind of posts people are looking for in this channel.
---
Just a little construction criticism and my own two cents. 
---
Should be taller. 
---
Oh boy it‚Äôs not about killer vs survivor argument. You do you, it‚Äôs just sad to see that a lot of killers pick their builds already expecting to lose the game. 
---
My man!  You a legend!
---
Does this affect crouching height on survivors? Regardless, I dislike this since it means the survivors aren't on an even playing field (since they get no benefit from extra height in third person). It effectively punishes playing a male character while incentivizes using a female character (like a lot of other games, which is sad in my opinion).
---
Sounds like you belong at rank 10. People are starting to find a true rank, and it‚Äôs not one for everyone. Me included- fluctuating between 3 and 5, which I suppose is where I belong.
---
Yea you‚Äôre right, but I want to play muh spirit :(

I don't think I can posts for-sale links here, but let me know if you're interested. :)

It is actually. Any item they pick up with their plunderers and ace in the hole will be protected from loss if they die due to the white ward
---
I love the fixed fps but bhvr needs a crowd at their backs to realise something is wrong now it seems.
---
when the replies to my comments say the content is good
---
Something to remember about the DBD community here is for a lot of people being toxic is their hobby. Just do you, keep streaming, post away, everyone starts out small.
---
Lol what.. ok üòÇ
---
In all honesty, if you don't have any friends, then I would not be surprised. The amount of insult from you is mindboggling when considering what the context is. And now you falsely call me out for only, exclusively, saying things that are just emotional perceptions, such a hypocrite.
---
You know, as you've successfully ignored all the points I made, and you continously call me stupid, while failling to have any well phrased arguments, you are simply not worth my or anyones time. If I want to read garbage then I can go elsewhere. 
---
But what I have to ask, also trying to see if you will actually answer to a single thing I say: 
---
Is saying "People get stuck because they walked against a tree for over 2 months now" an emotional statement, or real-world fact( I myself got stuck on a tree 2 months ago, yesterday I saw someone else getting stuck on a tree when I played killer)? If, as it actually is, is a real-world fact, then why do you call me stupid for calling the devs out on not fixing it for 2 months? Do you have proof that people just hallucinate about the freddy rework getting ignored by the devs? Do you have proof that Behaviour Digital did not choose to hire more artists than actual developers and has this imbalance involuntary? Do you have any valid proofable argument that justifies questioning the sanity of people asking about fixes and updates? Are you able to write one long answer, that does not contain any insult, or implication of others being stupid/retarded? Do you actually think that what you do right here, is based on common sense and reason?(I want you to re-read everything for this one)
---
Ignore or fail to answer any of these, and you have successfully proven to the public that you are a hypocrite, think you are always right, are not willing to discuss and present information for a conversation, are unable to not forcefully try to project yourself above everyone else, don't know anything solid about customer interactions and relationships, and most importantly have no social skills what so ever.
---
This is your chance to redeem yourself and show yourself the way you want to be seen. I am pretty sure you will fail, but you are free to disprove me. Well, if I am as stupid as you are keen to call me out, then answering/disproving my statements should be a piece of cake for you, and doing so would esthablish and proof your superiority over me and all the others here. GL
---
I main both
---
I do not know if it's op, but it's really damn strong. Got fucked over soo many times by it as killer, still don't have it as survivor, but I can imagine it's going to allow for a lot of ballsy saves and be ran by every swf team. It's not as bad as old ds though (that's a little bit of a stretch imo) 
---
Ohhhh, so they wanted to die! I see, how could I have missed something so obvious!
---
Agreed, I don‚Äôt think survivors have any OP perks, MoM is really good though and should probably get changed. What does annoy me is that I HAVE to use Ruin to pip bcuz if I don‚Äôt survs genrush and there goes my medal for gens
---
False, I play nea and bill and this is constantly me lmao
---
You can only get betyer if you practice enough, I wish you good luck in succeeding, friend! ^^
---
If the perks aren't ideal, just boost or nerf the numbers. And if the power is too much, just lower the amount of fake things that can be placed- or make it harder to reach higher tiers. The power doesn't really help in a chase, it just screws with Survivors. Really, it's the idea that I want intact. 
---
One day someone‚Äôs dad is actually gonna work somewhere and yikes
---
Or on xbox its literally anybody
---
It‚Äôs 17:54
---
The Plague looks like she just vomited inside her mouth.  Nasty.
---
Ngl it's not something I'd buy because it's too much of an inside joke. However, the design is clean and definitely on the more fashionable side of the spectrum. 7/10 it'd be better if not for what I've already stated.
---
while there is truth in this i would say that ruin does have a place on nurse even if you are a good one things like maps and spawns can play a huge roll in how effective you are at finding survivors and keeping map control 
---
So guys, we did it...
---
You MONSTER D:
---
Dammit you beat me to it.
---
If you're struggling to read it try and read right to left by the way
---
Also, I know it's not a thing anymore but I hid a smol Billy in there!
---
You might not seem so childish making insults about not having friends and then removing them like some people don‚Äôt have notifications on and can‚Äôt see it. The fact you‚Äôre grooming your comments to make them seem less emotional is pretty hilarious.
---
Same here on PS4. Makes the game practically unplayable and has happened maybe 1/10 games for me. ):
---
I have no idea what you're doing if you somehow manage to get 4 MoM's to activate all in one game, outside of somehow playing the "fairest" game possible of 3 hooking everyone, not having any form of insta down and letting everyone heal up.
---
outside of possible bodyblocking, there's no way a survivor will consistently be able to rely on MoM. NOED isn't the only exposed perk either. I pointed out several, not to mention other add-ons like pinky finger and Iri Head(should you even get the stacks against a huntress)
---
The perk is killer reliant on it's effectiveness, just like TONS of other perks. So far in my survivor games with it and my killer games against it, it has had it's "OMG clutch moments" and "waste of a perk slot" moments. That's like complaining that Unbreakable is broken because it countered your slug play and got everyone out, or that Borrowed Time and new DS suck because it denied your end game hook.
---
I would argue that there's truly only 2 killers that will have difficulty battling the perk without the use of perks and that are Wraith and Freddy (though ironically these are the 2 killers that I can nearly guarantee would have perks like NOED or Haunted Ground anyway) and that seems about fair. It's like on par with a Doctor facing Calm Spirit survivors. 
---
The Perk has downsides, like do you just ignore them and pretend you have no hope because you're bad or what?  There's conditions to activate it, there's ways around not only delaying/denying the MoM stacks, but also circumventing the actual activation of the perk, just because you say there isn't doesn't make it not true.
---
Flip flop.
---
Looks like they were interrupted 
---
Throwing medkits at the killer will give the pharmacy perk some extra umpf.
---
ARE YOU SHITTING ME, MATE
---
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN
---
But like: camping is just a miserable experience for all involved it‚Äôs more fun for everyone if people just don‚Äôt do it 
---
I fucking hate Claudette‚Äôs. Every troll I encounter seems to play her. Made my sick to play her while working towards self heal. 
---
Youre right. Once the gens are done the game is over. I forgot im supposed to go wait in the basement until everyone escaped.
---
Is that really how this works? 
---
Ah, I forgot skill matters when killers hit you. Thanks for reminding me üòÇ what a fucking idiot
---
First aid kits make you run faster?
---
Another survivor main who never plays killer.
---
No, skill matters before the hit.
---
Gives a visual outline of the crow that was disturbed and audio cue. 
---
Seriously the only thing that‚Äôs missing is some spoopy organs or synths. Maybe a spoopy bell as well. But this is so good. 
---
unfortunately for me I was taking a long break (and I didn‚Äôt consider it my ‚Äúmain‚Äù game) from the game when he came out so I never got this menu music.
---
Whats genrush?
---
I really like the idea of it being Rod Serling in black and white though.
---
Louder for the ‚Äústanding there nodding‚Äù killers in the back. Go break a pallet or something, my friend. Yes, yes, you‚Äôre very cool. I gets it.
---
Crows don't alert the Killer unless they are using Spies From The Shadows, at which point they receive an audio cue as well as a visual indicator that a crow was disturbed within 20/28/36 meters of them. Running when far from the Killer isn't generally a bad idea if you're behind cover, but if the Killer can get line of sight from one side of the map to the other (possible on certain maps in specific places), the scratch marks can give away your position.
---
I've been playing a bunch of Plague lately (trying to get rid of offerings so I can prestige and maybe actually get some good perks) and it's insane how many people refuse to cure themselves to gen rush instead.
---
Refusing to get yourself cured does nothing but bad for you. While sick you:
---
* Cough and vomit which makes it easier for the Killer to hear you (and also lets them locate you if they have the Black Incense addon)
---
* Spread sickness onto gens, which spreads to your healthy allies, forcing them to cure themselves and create more corrupt devotion pools
---
* **Puts you in Broken** which means that it only takes one hit for the Killer to down you.
---
Seriously kids: get your vaccines and drink some Fiji Water. Unless you're in a 4 man SWF and are all cordinated to gen rush and GTFO being broken and spreading sickness around will only harm you in the long run. I can't count the amount of games where there were half a dozen corrupt devotion pools and I got a 4k because one dumbass Meg refused to ever cure herself. And said dumbass Meg was usually the first to die.
---
I think a lot of people don't know that it triggers a visual notification.
---
She crouches though
---
&gt;...people kill themselves on hook because they‚Äôre being camped like they don‚Äôt want the rest of us to prosper.
---
Oh, I don't know. 
---
Maybe they actually wanted to play the game like everyone else instead of spending the majority of the match dangling from a meat hook. The killer may as well hang a PhD on the hook, pull up a chair, and ask the survivor how they feel.
---
Maybe they wanted to end their suffering as soon as possible, so they can move on to the next match or another activity‚Äîespecially with the tendency of allied survivor swarming that happens in lower ranks that lead to the camped survivor being tunneled then hooked again.
---
Just throwing some hypotheticals out there.
---
I did! Thank you so much. I was planning to do claudette next!
---
MehHead
---
Does vomming on the survivor count, as Plag? Cause that‚Äôs just... something I like doing? 
---
No. When you run around you leave red scratch marks on the ground for around 10 seconds. This normally doesnt matter unless you can see the killer as the scratch marks are only really visible from close up. 
---
When you distrub a set of crows they will fly into the air &amp; make a sound. The killer has to be closeby to see the crow so generally if your outside of his terror radius or on the out skirts then its unlikely the killer will notice.
---
Rare you might face a killer using the perk spies from the shadows. When they are within 36 meters of you setting of the crows they get a visual &amp; audio indicator. This is rare &amp; usually you will hear the killers terror radius before the perk can take effect. You can check if a killer has this perk by altering crows &amp; seeing if the killer goes to the area immediately after you do it.
---
Additionally, paying attention to crows is something very alert &amp; high ranking killers do so I wouldn't worry about the crows unless you're against a really high-level killer. 
---
Don't worry about the crows. Setting them off isn't really going to give your position away unless your right next to the killer. 
---
What if the survivor was just "Heather" and your cosmetics determine which Heather you are, kinda like Legion?
---
legion is good at tunneling but thats just 1 player she is focused on
---
there are a few things to do when going up against legion 
---
1 - do not heal, healing wastes your time and a drawn out game is where legion shines. she is a slow killer and her power makes healing irrelevant no matter what cause you will be put into injured state to quickly for it to matter so healing is a waste of time against legion
---
2 - focus on gens and get them popped as quickly as possible, legion needs a drawn out game to win and is very weak at end game. get to end game as quick as possible to win against her
---
3 - dont try to juke a legion this gives him time to catch up to you with feral frenzy. run in a straight line. this lets you gain the most distance and gives you the best chance of running out the frenzy timer before they catch you which is when you can try to loose line of sight
---
there is really simple to counter legion. in a chase you will lose but if everyone follows these simple rules to counter legion you will beat them 90% of the time
---
of course if you arent playing SFW everyone will immediately disconnect making survival against legion completely impossible
---
This post is completely out of touch and misinformed. 
---
Yes sir no BS
---
Can I get a link for the shirt? 
---
I mean im still gonna play swf, but its just an annoying little detail
---
Or maybe it‚Äôs you having 0 arguments at all.
---
Lol yes I may or may not have stolen that line from Monto.
---
Good nurses on console are somewhat rare but in the bi monthly match I get one they really do make you feel useless.
---
I tried her for a while and began to do ok but i just dont find her power fun.
---
The killer‚Äôs body is blocking your action. 
---
Gotta bust out nurse with Mettle becoming so prevalent now.  Can't tell ya how much that perk is gonna change things
---
i thought wraith
---
I rather enjoy the "yes pethetic" comment he says after you correct them. Lul.
---
I understand Legion blows, but there are also Billy games where Billy just heat seeking chainsaws the whole team and slugs them. It's not fun, but you deal with it and play your next game.
---
If you are upset enough to spam someone being "pethetic" constantly because you got screwed, you should probably take a breather and play a game that is less anger-inducing.
---
Boy what the fuck?
---
you have to get away from the killer to heal yourself tho and I mean you could just find a teammate so I don't think it really combines much better than say bond or something.
---
Personally I like it with DS because sometimes you get into a situation where you get downed, use DS, then your next hit his MoM. So it's like you had 2 extra lives lmao.
---
Is this a mothafuckin JoJo reference?!
---
I did this once to test if it activated dark devotion. If that survivor is here, I'm sorry.
---
I also do it when I catch you after you try farming someone, or kill my thrill of the hunt when I'm playing bp build. I'm not sorry for either of those.
---
He's *gotta* be black and white. I was thinking that an aspect of his power would be zoning off parts of the level, and everything (survivors, generators, environment) would have a black and white film grain on them. Then they'd suffer some sort of adverse effect, or weird things would start happening. 
---
Why doesn't Nurse's M1 affect it? That's so weird, I think it should and I'm a Nurse player.
---
What if instead of a 'good' player selecting Nurse and not taking Ruin, that same player *does* use Ruin; did they turn into a bad player? Who's to say whether they needed it, or they just wanted it because it's strong and helpful to have? 
---
ahh thank you so much!! I had a lot of school projects to do while I was completing this, so on and off it took about a week and a half! I never really draw anything moody/spooky so this was a fun challenge for me haha 
---
*highkey
---
Some sides of a 3 man/ 4 man gen can‚Äôt be worked on. Lol
---
THAT‚ÄôS SUCH A GOOD IDEA OMG
---
The only problem would be coming up with perks that fit all 3 of the Heathers, since they have pretty different personalities (McNamara especially).
---
‚ÄúYes.  But I want it.‚Äù- Claudette ImMorel
---
I'm so bothered. I just think you're stupid, but you can continue to think I care that much.
---
Maybe they mindgamed you for the key
---
Where did you get the myers and wraith shot from?
---
I guess they thought I was agreeing with them? Lol. And yes, I totally agree with you, I‚Äôve had times were I‚Äôve had to take a break from this game.
---
They should have a Big Boi game mode, where nobody can use any perks or addons or items. 
---
Arent exhaustion addons replacing the current exhaustion status,if you already have one?  Like you used Sprintburst and are getting hit by an exhaustion hatchet. Will the status of your sprintburst exhaustion be replaced/renewed from the addon ? That would be really bad,because if it would go down as he suggested,you would be able to use sprintburst again while running,arent you?
---
Appreciate it
---
Kinda pointless if all they find is garbage. Quite the gamble.
---
I would assume if something like this were to be implemented, addon exhaustion wouldn't replace any existing exhaustion, to prevent that from happening
---
You‚Äôre an amazing human being! It means a lot.   And thank you for the follow. Should be streaming tonight! 
---
Kudos on the optimism, man. It is DEFINITELY a strong perk. There's no denying that it's really good, and will definitely force killers to adapt once everybody starts running it. In a team of 4, this perk could easily be crippling to some killers.. But that is easily the case with most perks, and an organized team of survivors. There haven't been too many really good survivor perks lately, that haven't been nerfed into nothing, or are extremely situational. I know people will be calling for this perk to be nerfed left and right, and there will surely be changes coming, without a doubt, but I have played with and against this perk.. Rank 12 or so survivor and a rank 10 ish killer, and so far it hasn't been game breaking. It's led to a few hook saves that would have otherwise been impossible against a couple of camping leather faces and hags.. It's also led to me losing a kill or two at the end of the match.. But that's the game, and I feel MUCH more overpowered, as a killer.. And I play a lot of Freddy just for the love of the franchise, so that's saying something.. Strictly M1 killer, with a delayed extra step, and I've found ways to counter MoM.. Trust me when I say that it's not gonna be a huge issue until you're running into teams of 4 that all have it equipped. Just watch out for Ash, if you've already hooked him once.. Be ready to hit him a third time, during your next chase! Sorry about the wall of text, just don't get many people who actually want to discuss things about the game.. Usually it's just some jerk off who wants to "Burn it to the ground.." LOL..
---
Best of luck out there bud! Have a positive day! 
---
Still going to be a no from me :)
---
Thats adorable 
---
Depends on which rank you are.
---
Legions going to be a tik tok thot?
---
Yep. I love this game, but I don't get to play that much so I've never gotten really good with killers. I encountered a group like this one time and it's the only time I've ever gotten 4 kills. They spent all their time fucking with me and just ended up trapping themselves while trying to save each other, so they were easy pickings.
---
Ya I have the same issue trying to tell randoms I have the key then they look at you stupid as you spam wave at them for the key back lol. 
---
Ah right that‚Äôl be it
---
Op is my wife! She does all the art for my stream, isn't it the best??
---
You can't consider yourself a good survivor if you use free escape perks.
---
I believe that McLean said that it not working on nurse is a bug.
---
I think all other instances it is working properly though.
---
Can confirm :3
---
First aid kits allow you to heal yourself.
---
Also, how long have you had this game?
---
But I'm sure he chased who he saw running instead of you. 
---
Set the wraith as my prof pic for ps4 so cute!!!
---
Decisive got nerfed. NOED got buffed. New killer Legion is AIDS. New Killer Plague actually spreads AIDS. Console has good framerate now but PS4 cant find games. Lots of new perks most garbage but some new meta stuff.
---
I blast music while playing too and it never lines up with what's going on at all.
---
Xbone?
---
SHHT round the corner.
---
Best pally IN DA WORLD.
---
Just gotta SHHT round the corner.
---
X Box ONE
---
Sweaty? A Wraith? Cry more fella
---
Really? There's just an upside down Dwight on the poster
---
 Was an ironic statement, you can't do that legally. Once a product is bought you can't legally "force" an owner to return it. Even if you do refund all the money (which) btw they fucking won't lol.
---
I sometimes feel bad for the players who didn't disconnect like their teammates did when I'm playing killer, but I'm not trying to end it quickly because I see blood, it's just that a two-survivor match with five gens left isn't fun for anyone and I don't want to farm. I feel like rushing it quickly is better for everyone, we can all try getting back into a 4 vs 1 ASAP. I would have definitely given you the hatch though...
---
These comments will surely be wholesome and respectful. 
---
XD No BP and no "GG EZ" for those bitches.
---
Nurse is possible, but you need to yeet that right stick.
---
Yessir! Tyvm 
---
We're they goofing around? How does this even happen? I've got 3 in before, but with Insidious LF. 
---
I'm glad I broke out of it, I only go there by accident or when someone links a thread, but having the subreddits for the things you like is such a better environment.
---
Goddamn pillar _men_
---
hence the /s it means sarcasm for future reference
---
My first menu theme was the Halloween Event 2017 music, which I loved. I thought that was the default music back then- even now, it‚Äôs my favourite version of the DBD theme. I‚Äôm sad they didn‚Äôt bring it back for Hallowed Blight 2018.
---
Honestly for me it‚Äôs always a Nea wearing some bright ass clothes 
---
pethetic
---
I main Cannibal, MoM shouldn‚Äôt be an issue for you. 
---
Well it's worse now. Midway through matches jason is unstunable so it's even less control over what happens to you. 
---
Just... most of us.
---
This video was originally 10 minutes but I sped it up. I started recording after 10 minutes of it for a total of 20 minutes until I DC at the end. Here is the steam account of the killer but I don't know if this is bannable: [https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198379045447/](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198379045447/)
---
So by ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù you mean.. playing the game?
---
Nothing wrong with the lore.
---
"The killer didn't let me escape, what a sweaty fucker!!"
---
People like you should get permanently banned. Entitled beyond belief.
---
thanks, I assumed they went on a seperate list
---
Cool art
---
Pretty nice actually! I'm almost P2 myself and I won't stop until I get the full pack and the build I like.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
PS. Love the censor. That's so groovy.
---
Congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Once a teachable id unlocked it should save forever
---
Thank you! B-)
---
are you a man of ace in the hole shrine and plunderer's instinct too?
---
because holy shit i have gotten a boatload of hatch escapes with this perk combo, it's so much fun
---
I agree, being able to bring stuff to the match that counters your opponent is unfun and should be removed. Nothing should have any counterplay. The fact that exhaust addons have a chance to be completely useless waste of an addon slot isn't enough; survivors everywhere are temporarily losing get out of jail free cards!
---
And then that one totem you didn't get was NOED and the killer says, "Lol clean totems noobs."
---
When Lunar event ended, my Kate had an empty slot (and I was with an offering equipped before)
---
The biggest power of the killer is the brain actually, because you have to know how to use your power, survivors have to run, just. Killers can't only M1, survivors can run straight lines
---
Not sure why I zoomed in to read this. I knew he was an idiot.
---
If it doesn't say Licensed chapter, they are original killers.
---
Self care.
---
Oof I hope to never have to survive with you. You are really actually mad about people just playing the game?
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is bait, and I really hope it is 
---
Hmmm agree to disagree, it feels written like 14 year-old girl Slenderman fanfic, some of it really gives me second hand embarrassment. I don't think it's a creative issue, mostly a writing/syntax one. 
---
Where the fuck is my girl Kate?
---
Please stop attacking me 
---
                  Sincerely, big brain Meg main 
---
then maybe they should go play another game if they're going to pout and throw a fit they got downed and hooked and the killer doesn't play by some rules they decide to make up on how they think killers should play. 
---
If you're that much of a fucking baby you're just going to kill yourself on hook rather then punish the killer for camping allowing your team to escape.. then maybe don't play a fucking Team obj PVP game you selfish cunt. 
---
It‚Äôs hard to remember when your triggered and just wanna get the fk out of that hell hole. I‚Äôve forgotten many times. 
---
Good one
---
I saved a meg yesterday and who ever was playing ran across the map just to be healed. The killer was no where near the hook.
---
Taking a hit doesn't necessarily mean you're losing a chase though.. 
---
Scarlett was robbed
---
hey look on the bright side, at least they're not gonna nerf noed, ruin, rancor, devour hope, nurse, billy, any instadown, or literally any other killer perk that's strong :D too bad survivors cant say the same
---
Gen tapping takes longer than people who can actually power through ruin (and so many killers run it that there are tons of survivors who are capable of just hitting skillchecks.) Learn to cut off loops or run perks like SF that get rid of them, or otherwise don't complain about survivors using their one defense against killers lol. NTM if someone's "just trolling" by running around loops, they aren't on gens. I'll give you that people who sit at the gate to teabag are shitheads though.
---
Also looping and bodyblocks are not exploits, learn to look down or stop being afraid of getting free hits on people.
---
I'm a terrible killer, but I've hooked high rank SWF players before (it only took like 3 damn gens tho)
---
That's what I thought, just wasn't sure if it treated shrine perks differently. never know with their weird code
---
Wait to stick with the bait through the comments mate.
