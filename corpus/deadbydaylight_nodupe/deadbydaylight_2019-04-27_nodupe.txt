The SWF coordination levels can be fixed by breaking Discord into 3 tiers.
---

---
**Tier 1:**
---
Works as long as you can understand which tree in the map is "totem behind the tree"
---
**Tier 2:**
---
Adds basic commands, such as "The killer is chasing me!" "I'm gonna pop a gen" "Killer is camping"
---
**Tier 3:**
---
Everytime you are downed, teleports a teammate with insta-blind flashlight in front of the killer.
---
---
---
Every time I play killer, I get haddonfield at least three times in a row with no map offerings. Lmao
---
I shall be using this in post game Ps4 messages. I thank you
---
So well deserved :)
---
Almost sounds alien, I know they've said they don't want to do an alien, but it sounds out of this world.
---
It could also just be the devs having some fun with dataminers.
---
99% your self care then suddenly there is no downside
---
I’ve gotten it to work a lot. Tenacity, Dance with me, flip flop, unbreakable is pretty funny. When ever I’m chased I run to the corner and the almost never get me
---
It would need to be taken based to balance it out. 
---
Gain 1 token for every teabag at a pallet.
---
i use both Stridor and Bloodhound on Spirit even if i shouldn't since i waste a perk slot but Stridor helps me find immersed survivors better
---
Sometimes I gotta break my own rule to get people to follow it.
---
I feel like they might he rushing content a bit here, slow down and fix the main issues with the game, just throwing new perks into the mix constantly is really starting to make those blood webs grind.
---
I asked this on another post before the person deleted it, who is this?
---
Killers should lose pip and points for camping. Like 100 points per sec they are within 32 meters of a hooked survivor. And if they hook the same survivor in a row within 2 minutes they should loose 2k points. All while de pipping until they learn how to play killer.
---
Keep in mind that it is sometimes a better option to put someone to sleep and not even hurt them if it isn't in your favor. They have to waste more time running to find a generator and losing progress on that failed skillcheck. 
---
There's also a kind of gray area on that strategy, putting everyone to sleep. Obviously, you frequently will only have one or two people asleep at one time. The more you play, the more you fine-tune your technique and figure out the best way to play him. 
---
Trust me, he is not garbage tier. Just difficult.
---
Ooh then we need Deathwing from WoW.
---
You're an idiot.. -. -
---
BOI!!
---
Nea did 9/11
---
Why do Aussies always get rear ended with this shit
---
TheworldofRSB
---
Why do you think that this would be needed?
---
What is the counter buff for a killer? Does NOED get a buff to counter-act this?
---
Hopefully inspiration strikes others as it did me. I've seen a few more SFM pieces since I've started compared to before
---
Double blood points in early May
---
I'll rephrase, why is he important?
---
It's about what happens when you finally get a survivor on the hook. That's where it starts spiralling.
---
Well, you found the substitute selection screen picture for Doctor.
---
I like that change it would definitely have more uses
---
Well I am wet.
---
Thanks for the info, I didn't know about the advantage for Legion and I'd forgotten about Unnerving Presence (aren't there a couple of similar perks on Doctor and Clown as well?)
---
I agree that those addons are neat. IMO I'd rather see more things like that which remove an advantage but increase points than ones (even if very/ultra rare) that negate a drawback.
---
Don't prestige, nothing is gained
---
On May 28 a major ghostface announcement is being made involving a game (probably dead by daylight) and this guy is a fan who gets to announce it
---
Same with Hillbilly, Bubba, Amanda, Legion, Myers (Counting the original 2 movies only), Huntress, the Plag (she’s literally just sick), and Clown.
---
Did he win a contest or something?
---
I don't think he's asking you out
---
Watch out, you'll go blind.
---
holy shit, 250 ping is for continental distancies. the value should be 70 for curitiba
---
Yeah agreed.
---
If you get everyone at the end to be asleep they can’t wake up unless they are hurt, so their gate opening time is huge.
---
*Laughs in Lightborn/Overwhelming Presence/Infectious Fright/Doctor*
---
Just watch this https://youtu.be/93bmvihnLsg
---
Lmao i use teamspeak. its just better than shitscord
---
I don't trust you. He has too many counters. I've played him plenty and determined he's not great, killer streamers agree he's not great, survivor players agree he's not great.
---
I'm a raging carpet munching lesbian anyhow, so it wouldn't work.
---
tl;dr
---
It's not about what happens in chase, it's about that happens when you get a survivor on the hook.
---
Claudette taught Jeff Botany Knowledge btw
---
He is getting completely reworked in a month or so per the Devs. So how you play him now may be completely different.
---
I doubt that passive aggressive shit works in the "real world" either.
---
It's like you dont care at all that somebody is playing killer and this change would probably cause most killer players to straight out quit.
---
How can you not see that thuz us a terrible change?
---
u also had to be gae
---
Isn't that exactly what survivors are doing now?
---
Survivors want the game balanced around 1v1 not 4v1. If the killer has an ability that prevents them from pallet looping it's op.
---
oh yikes
---
I'm not sure what you mean?
---
I've had about 30 ping in each match, so that will hopefully be nice. But it still lags and rubber bands you way more than acceptable, also my poor bing bong boi doesn't have a speed boost after uncloaking.
---
/shrug
---
I've had great success playing as him. I'd like to peg it as many people simply do not know how to play Freddy effectively. I've tried explaining my strategy and why it works, but not everybody can play a certain way. 
---
For example, I suck at Huntress and am a below- average Hillbilly.
---
Yeah, Ruvik was teased in the post credit scene on TEW2, can't wait.
---
Or some people actually liked how legion played and he ended up getting changed because survivors that are pure garbage didn't have fun against the worst killer in the game
---
0005 sounds like the [Black Ops numbers station](https://youtu.be/fhk7VqG1_lk?t=40).
---
Survivors are dc'ing on first down cause they expect a camp and tunnel especially if it is a minute or two in the match. I am usually that last survivor all by myself with a killer still trying hard even tho I gotta do the gens alone lol.
---
Anyway it seems most killers forget it is people trying to have fun, not sit on a hook without any chance to earn a safety pip like killers are able to.
---
right lmfao.
---
you okay trump?
---
I've had plenty of success playing him too, against survivors that clearly misplay big time against Freddy. But that really shouldn't be the benchmark for whether he's good.
---
Yeah, I main Killer but whenever I play survivor and see people doing this I can’t help but think, “Dude, act like you’ve been there before.”
---
Now you're just exaggerating.
---
Tier 1 wiggle bar status: All you get is screams for body blocks, no matter how full the bar is.
---
Tier 1 bypass blindness: "We're over here" (no clarification)
---
almost like people can have a different opinion than you on what fun is
---
Really bad killers still have nurse and billy to get downs without any skill so nothing on that front has changed
---
There's honestly enough salt and people telling others how to play or how they want others to play
---
Sometimes, you need to bait the pickup and slug. 
---
That is something you learn when to do. 
---
If it keeps happening, use Mad Grit. From Legion (easier said than done with the RNG bloodwebs). 
---
All in all, if they are a decent SWF, you will be in for a bad time.
---
Are we gonna ignore the “lmao” over Freddy face ?? Lmao I haven’t seen one comment about it.
---
No I was facing the pallet
---
Use the D A R N Freddy meme for Freddy.
---
It isn't a benchmark, though. But by that logic, a chunk of the killers are low-tier because they simply rely on survivor mistakes. 
---
You could even argue that for playing as a killer in general, as many others already have. Survivors almost dictate what happens in any given chase and especially so throughout a match.
---
Oops said gems instead of gens
---
I often ask : "Are you too afraid to turn off EZ mode?"
---
That is why they say GG first. They are actually trying to be polite. GG EZ translates to: “You played as well as you could when we are using third party software to gain a significant tactical advantage and Negate several of your perks. “
---
right :-(
---
i want a clown change so we can get the curtain call chapter music again
---
It would, I'd love to have her as the killer, though it's not really plausible for DBD since they'd have to make a new rig so I have to cop out and do Stefano or Anima. I love Anima too though so
---
Inb4 I was playing in North American server for some reason instead of Brazilian ones
---
Tier 1 small game: “He didn’t set down a trap”
---
I could make a concept of that in the future
---
Forgive me, I didn't end it with /s. I am a Legion main. I played Legion like a shit tier spirit. I'm not saying it's not functional, and he's probably funner to play against but if you're telling me a dude who sprints at 333% and comes out of it with a lethal strike, that Legion is fun to play compared to spirit. You're either lying or misinformed. I'm not saying Legion isn't playable, i'm just saying a few nerfs really took the fun out of it. I personally will be switching to Spirit main because of said differences.
---
How did you manage to make him scarier than he did?  Don't want to bump into him in the dark.
---
Can't you just click their name on the post-game screen?
---
You are truly evil
---
&gt;It’s exhausting to see this team prove over and over again how lazy and incompetent they are
---
Says the guy who used the wri g "their" twice.
---
Scary? You must be high, this is the most handsome fool since Ace in a robe!
---
No but they have it easier and make more points than survivors while survivors de pip and make next to nothing for being camped and tunneled. 
---
It is the reality of it, it is hard to argue with it because I am only saying what is happening. I am not condoning what anyone is doing. I just don't want the life sucked out of the game because killers forget to have fun instead they ruin the game for many by making us wait 10 to 15 minutes to get into a match to just sit on a hook. Go find someone else and have fun you will find them again later.
---
Get prescription sunglasses. How dare you comparing him to finger gun God, Ace?
---
This drug user wish he can be as charming as Ace.
---
This just made my fucking day at work. Thank you.
---
Then NOED hits because your team forgot totems exist and the killer gets a 3K
---
I messed up the title AGAIN...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I meant to add that this was an evil thought I had.
---
*notices ur prayer beads*
---
OwO whats thi-*DC*
---
Yeah.. maybe I was stretching a bit there 
---
EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL THOUGH
---
You're not entirely wrong. 
---
The worst part about the nerf - the terror radius change - was reverted. 
---
The end-game trap change is logical with the new end-game collapse, people just aren't thinking it through. This change mainly affects the [the noed endgame pigs who get free kills](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmazingBlightedSardineHassaanChop) because why the fuck not, right? I don't think people understand how much more unfun Pig would be without this change.
---
That's Americas ass
---
My teacher said that's just what ugly people say to make themselves feel better.
---
Don't even get me on the dc's.... They are always unwarranted and it's frustrating it adds more toxicity to this already chernobyl level of toxicity environement, and as you have said my friend, sadly, killers forget that that is not how you play DBD and that you should have fun and hook different people and understand that survivors looping you is just them trying to survive, not be toxic. Just had a game where four survive with friends pieces of shit t-bagged before leaving and I don't even give a shit, that's just how children act, now I just played another game where the killer tunneled me and another survivor and literally stood infront of the hook for all of my hook duration, this is absurd. This game is fucking garbage.
---
i love this gif
---
Prioritize windows hard over pallets.  Beat the fuck out of them at every T-Wall you can find.  Beat them up at the shack, block the window and then don't toss the God pallet run towards the nearest outside pallet instead and use that lol (that one really pisses them off).  Bait out respects by stopping short at the pallet then keep running to buy additional loops.  You'd be surprised how long you can keep it up.  Also you should be able to break their bloodlust by sticking by to force them to break pallet.  Then just break line of sight and keep it going.  I get that you can't do it indefinitely but if you can get 3 or more gens out of it, the camps end up making me laugh at them instead of pissing me off.
---
According to DBD, Australia and Africa are fake and don’t have any players
---
Seriously, most of their streamers are in Europe and North America, namely US and Canada, but Africans and Australians should still be able to play!
---
My job is getting them to safety. Do what you must to me.
---
Yea it really does, but I watch YouTubers. I don’t like waiting for them to find a match.  You should watch the YouTuber named Monto
---
No she doesn't. Which is a point of contention. We can keep it the same, but nerf the fuck outta spirit cause she's making us look lame haha.
---
Except freddys power actualy helps him to an extent, no mither however only realy hurts you.
---
Bro you did not just mention Nurse and no skill, you just lost all credibility my dude.  That's the whole point of Nurse, she bypasses every mechanic BUT requires skill to learn and play.  Also Billy man?  He is just as loopable as any other killer.  Also chainsaw jukes are a thing.
---
i dont get it ; -;
---
#BOI.

I'm with you. They can take all the pretty toys, but like, the fast vault made me -feel- like I was quick. this new slow vault makes me feel like a potato survivor that fucked up and is about to get grabbed.
---
It's this one:  [http://i.imgur.com/o7DgMpC.gif](http://i.imgur.com/o7DgMpC.gif) 
---
Basically Joel from LoU imitating Antonio Banderas from some commercial.
---
DC so u get 0 points, and the Killer DC bonus points and no one escape points.
---
Screaming?
---
Got 1 to safety.
---
So... Bronze metal?
---
I'm pretty sure that they meant screaming but I don't know how they messed it up that bad
---
i had two things for Endgame spoiled for me, but it didn't ruin my experience.
---
Did anyone REALLY expect BHVR to do something RIGHT for once?
---
Most likely
---
Thank you!
---
20/10 I'm PS4 and trash with her.
---
That is awesome. Makes me think trapper would do that after getting looped then the looper walks on a trap.
---
with the new ranking system, i couldn't reach past rank 4 as survivor
---
&gt;to show who's the boss
---
The only thing you're showing me is that you're near the hook and that I shouldn't bother to attempt to rescue. I've been in matches like that - as the hooked survivor, and everyone just knew to keep doing the gens and leave. Maybe try to save at the end, if there was enough time.
---
It would actually give it use but bright side for killers is more hook points
---
Lol
---
So I learned that yes!  Naughty Dog did make that in advance of knowing that they're going to win some game awards.  Then proceeded to show it during the show.
---
Lmao. I am on Ps4 if you would like to stream a match and we can all see the outcome.
---
Spine chill?
---
Ah, yes!
---
Don't forget that crouching repeatedly should cause an exhaustion and flaslight clicking should immediately deplete the item. That'll show them. /s
---
Man, that was pure gold.
---
Didn’t the devs say they wouldn’t do alien stuff? This definitely sounds like an alien, haha, and I hate it (which is a good thing for a scary game)! 
---
I almost wonder if they did this specifically to trick people, but you never know.
---
r/wooosh
---
Honestly, I like the character and it would be a character I spend money on, but the only thing I would fix for this would be to increase the time for Rex’s cool-down so you do not spam him, and might I add with the perk for him to attack, so a survivor do not constantly get hit by rex and damaged, but overall, a solid 9/10 character.
---
&gt; We will be monitoring their performance and keeping an eye out for feedback and technical issues. This will be the first time we run tests in a public setting and we would like to take this opportunity to discover any issues that may arise and observe how the system scales with a larger number of players to ensure that it is as stable as possible going forward. 
---
People need to stop comparing Ghost Face to Legion
---
Finally.  Dedicated servers are here. And hits register around pallets and windows exactly as they did before
---
... further proving killers are meant to be able to challenge survivors at these obstacles. 
---
They where never meant to be perfect safe zones.  Only the vacuum bug made them that way... sadly many survivor mains started DbD during this dark time and actually think that's how pallets worked.
---
This guy looks like Michael's son in GTA 5
---
Rank in DBD is a flawed system in which the reward for participating is being able to play the game as it was intended while also increasing the time required to play the game as intended
---
Wraith should be Big Ben, hillbilly should just be a South park "dey took our jerbs" redneck, spirit should be the most ironic anime girl you can find, doctor should be Dr mario
---
I have just been going off what other people said when they voice it to me.
---
No, it is strategy. You need to place traps in specific areas then herd survivors toward them. 
---
Typically 1 or 2 gens pop before you hit a single survivor since you need time to set the web of traps. You start at a disadvantage. 
---
You have to adjust trap placements if they juke the edges. You have to read the survivor and vary when you do and do not teleport in a loop. 
---
Basically, you have to plan ahead. 
---
Hag is a strategy killer. Trapper is a luck/strategy killer since the traps are not in demand.
---
Survivor: Nobody ever seems to have Borrowed Time       
---
Killer: Lullaby (moreso on Doctor)
---
hahaha, thank you
---
Do what. I literally Hook, Slap and walk away to find other people. I don't stand there slapping them over n over.
---
That would involve finding a competent programmer.
---
Right? If I have to deal with a 3 or 4 stack of swf just give me a decent amount of BP and I'll actually play. Otherwise I'll just keep deleting the lobby when 3 survivors load in at the same time. I get a limited amount of playtime and ain't got time for bullshit
---
Well then don’t do the gens
---
Samination trapper
---
I think I want more killers from legends over movies but I just love the candy man movies that much to want it. Wonder if Bloody Mary would work🤔🤔
---
This is what I’m talking about after the massive end game changes bringing Pig nerfs and survivor buffs and just screwing killers over it’s time we take vengeance and while we’re at it let’s run the most toxic build we can
---
Not the point
---
actually im a mentally handicapped pigeon
---
EXCUSE ME Killers are the problem??? Have you seen the survivors survivors are known to take the game hostage just for shits and giggles seriously
---
What stops a killer from slugging you with NOED and going after others? It is up to the other people not to be potatoes.
---
No thank you
---
You heard it here first folks because a couple killer like trolling that means most of us have mental issues!!!
---
It is my team getting the totem before you get the chance to slug anyone else. I may go down as I have stated. But they will all escape.
---
How can you be so certain no one else would go down?

---
That’s like saying the hag’s add-one having no counterplay is a reason to dc. Just cause it has no downs sides doesn’t mean it’s broken. And on another no if you dc cause of adds that’s lame tbh your gonna quit cause a killer is using something to enhance his powers
---
It's all good, I don't advertise streams unless it's a charity thing, he's a bit drunk however so not the best at his communication. Lol
---
On one side, survivour have had most of the brutal nerfs, but on the other hand, endgame pig
---
for me personally, i dont find the game to be fun most of the time without playing with friends, it's actually the only reason i got the game and bought it for 3 people. the only time i really play solo is killer because of obvious reasons.
---
Because it doesn’t have a downside doesn’t mean it’s broken, but prayer beads itself is. Until they add a downside to being able to pull anyone off a generator without warning then people will continue to DC
---
Or perhaps all the totems are gone and you don't get noed. Hmmmm.
---
Ah. Team. IOW, SWF. AKA EZ mode. 
---
Gotcha.
---
I really doubt she would ever reach Nurse tier or even Billy. The fundamental weakness of the Pig is she doesn’t have anything that helps her in a chase. She has to catch people to put traps on them. She also has no mobility, at least no more than what 115% speed can afford. She basically has the same map pressure as the Clown. Stealth does make up for that a little bit not dramatically by any means. At best, she would bump up to A tier but I can’t see any serious Killer main ranking her higher than Billy. 
---
I’m willing to discuss compromises, however. I like the idea of having trapped survivors causing the timer to slow down like downed/hooked survivors. That should give survivors a very fair window to get the traps off and get out. I also saw someone else suggest that boxes always give out keys after the collapse begins. I would like some tweaks to that idea but I would still be amenable to it. But I need to be clear: any solution where a survivor is allowed to just walk out of a trial with a death trap attached to their head with zero consequences is a nonstarter. The premise is absurd.
---
#3 sounds like chase music.
---
You may not even have a totem for noed. I am good for searching them before I work gens
---
I also said 1v1 me and I will have my gens done before you get me
---
I know that my boyfriend and I would just KILL it in a 2v8. I main trapper and he plays around with the killers... He is kinda just good at all of them.  XD
---
credits to u/HorsePower99 for his discovery
---
(also sorry for posting a similar video, didn't know you also posted in youtube)
---
My guy, make your own video before you act all high and mighty.
---
&gt; But by that logic, a chunk of the killers are low-tier because they simply rely on survivor mistakes.
---
This is absolutely the case. If we hand-waved the idea that survivors need to fuck up, Trapper would be considered one of the best killers -- instadowns, no skill required! But in reality, a killer that needs survivors to fuck up *big time* to succeed isn't very good.
---
I agree that survivors dictate the match in general, but that doesn't wipe out the existence of killer tiers. Billy's completely loopable like any M1 killer, but he's considered one of the best killers, because 1. his map control lets him find people out of position 2. fucking up against him = you get instadowned. If you fuck up against Freddy, you get M1'd. The counterplay against Freddy is too simple to make survivors make mistakes, and the reward for capitalizing on mistakes is too small.
---
It still stands to say that if you dc from just that ur a loser
---
Prayer beads is fine. Survivors are entitled pieces of shit
---
Dbd in a nutshell.
---
Yeah I definitely got alien vibe from those sounds.
---
I'm sorry, but I have very little faith in this whole ordeal.  As I've said before, this game was built from the ground up with the intention of the Killer having 0 ping.  They would have to jump through a lot of hoops to make dedicated servers feel as smooth as it does now.  It would be a miracle if they pulled it off, but as it stands, I feel like someone is going to get burned by this.
---
that is called a thrawl
---
So 1v1 vs killer?
---
That is just an RNG of killer, survivor, map, and gen placement. If you get 1 gen done you get hatch opened.
---
That is more a hide and seek game, not skill.
---
Same
---
Agreed!
---
#NEW LEGION SKIN?
---
I will get all my gens done. I didn't mention a hatch. I don't want the hatch. I want to embarrass you in front of the Dead by Daylight community
---
I understood those references!
---
I love &gt;!America's ass.!&lt;
---
Wait was this guys name King_oslyn it something like that?
---
Oh I don't doubt that there's a massive task on their plate right now, and that it could easily fail. I know they've yet to prove their worth, but with all the new, experienced programmers they're bringing in, I believe they'll have all of this figured out and fixed to a pretty good degree. When that's going to happen, no idea.
---
Can we leave politics out of this?  God, you give us Claudette Mains a bad name.
---
Can we get a 24hr ban on tunnelers? I would love to enjoy the blood hunt but I'm sure I'll get focused for the entire game for doing a generator.
---
Then play on PC and not PS4.
---
You know, where it takes less than 1 second for a killer to turn 360 degrees. 
---
Easy to juke a killer when they turn like a cruise ship.
---
Thank you
---
Freddy’s Powers gives you knowledge and slowing the game down (just a little bit). But vs high rank survivors who are very aggressive and learning their patterns. Knowledge is useless. So with that in mind, his power is just a hindrance. I still like playing him cu it’s Freddy
---
Assuming this is real, it seems as though the devs might pull a Michael and give the killer different terror radius music, which I’m all for.
---
you mean I shouldn't be able to get free guaranteed kills at the end of the game!? REEEEEE
---
I'd rather not have another Wraith situation where I have to constantly farm addons if I want to play a certain killer. Killer viability being rooted in addons is really lame. Just like... don't nerf an already-bad killer...
---
Xbox.
---
Played vs a Freddy lastnight and a player dcd after being picked up by Freddy. Afterwards you could occasionally see that dcd person floating in the air making spastic movements thus giving away Freddy’s position. Saw it happen from up close and in the distance. Obviously all while I was awake and not in the dreamworld.
---
This girl looks like a combination of Sansa and Daenerys LUL
---
Yeah, sorry. Always called it that due to the icon and abbreviations.
---
To be fair that counters everybody.
---
Blood Hunts always have the effect of increasing the amount of players during the event, but considering how many players are DC'ing currently during normal traffic... Something needs to be done before the blood hunt to remind people that if they are going to ruin it for everyone, then they don't deserve to participate in the event. 
---
So yeah, I'm in agreement that it'd be super effective... but only if it happens. Here's hoping this gets up-voted and commented on enough in support that it catches BHVR's attention.
---
Plus, if you already have the trap on your head you’ve likely already checked a box or two. Unless you decided to try to get to the hatch before the Killer and failed. And then there’s legitimate question whether you shouldn’t face the consequences of your poor decisions, of your failures.
---
im really looking forward to spend money on skins for a m1 killer. it should be playable right?
---
Well, Laurie Strode, Ash Williams and Quentin Smith aren't dead and we don't really know about Tapp.
---
The ultimate sacrifice would be too broken especially at Tier III. I don't think it can be balanced. 
---
Also, I don't think it is any relevant to make a perk have different effects on male or female survivors especially since every survivor are identical. Same model etc... It would be a waste of time to have to calculate that at each trial.
---
Take charge could be good though 
---
Also, who the heck is Melvin ?
---
Nice
---
Oh, was supposed to be marvin.
---
Or it just means no one has good enough connection to the early temporary servers in a test build
---
You're being dense.
---
This game was obviously designed for survivors not to have communication. 
---
People are complaining because there are perks that are straight up invalidated by the fact SWF exists.
---
Not to say SWF is a bad thing, but it definitely contradicts what the game was designed to be.
---
Let us set a time and I will buy for Ps4. Give me two weeks to have a pc and the game on Steam. Then 1v1 me. Let's get as many on the subreddit to know so we have an audience and I will embarrass you.
---
Seriously and there are no plans to alleviate it either.
---
Read the patch notes kid and cry
---
Not from developers’s POV.
---
Useing the dream transition you can effectively mindgame survivors once you mastered it. Freddy can zone the survivor with his first visibility period, during the first invisibility period freddy can then return to the survivor or counter rotate them, and at the last invisibility period pull a mindgame and then hit the survivor upon comeing out of it. Freddy can then break chase, apply map pressure to other survivors, head back to the injured survivor, wait for them to break out dream world, and mindgame them again to down.
---
Great Freddy guide for refrence:

The whole time I was thinking "Smile, god dammit."
---
This is such an elaborate meme that can only work in specific situations
---
Mettle of man is DS but without going down or skill checks 
---
They fixed DS just to add a even worse perk
---
I mean, they DID say they also weren't going to add a clown because of phobias, but we have a Clown now!
---
However, there have been rumors of Ghostface from the Scream series coming to DBD, and there is an announcement about Ghostface coming exactly a month from now...
---
Camping isn't a ban-able offense, and results in a loss of points for the killer players when survivors use the time they camp to complete objectives. During Blood Hunt Events we rarely get Campers as, win or lose, everyone is trying to maximize their BP gain and have fun. DC'ers on the other hand totally ruin the experience for everyone and trash the chances of maximizing BP gain. On top of that, this practice in bad sportsmanship IS a ban-able offense, and there have been ban-waves in the past for it. I'm not asking for a full on perma-ban for these players... just a reminder that their behavior is unwanted if they're going to participate in the Blood Hunt. Otherwise (I'm calling it now) the next Blood Hunt will go down as the worst one in the history of DbD.
---
This is the cutest art, good job OP. Oink
---
Thank you so much &lt;3
---
They said theyd never put clowns in before and now they have a clown
---
You would buy a $500-$1000 PC and $20+ for a game you already own just to try to prove (what exactly, I am not sure) to random people you don’t know on the internet. 
---
Wow. That is a whole different level of not only salt, but frivolous spending. 
---
Hopefully you are loaded, because I would hate to see if someone questions your driving skills and you have to go and buy a Porsche to race them. 
---
Calm down. Breathe. You are really emotionally invested in this random conversation for some reason.
---
They need to create a way to make it impossible to use discord while dbd is open. The ability to communicate between survivors gives them an unfair advantage.
---
Lol. I might you never know. I am a random person on the internet. I could be from florida, who knows.
---
Coulrophobia on an huntress? With a 20m radius?
---
Why Florida?
---
I'm sad that each killer doesn't have their own chase music/terror radius music.  Such a wasted opportunity.
---
Florida man is known for just about anything random
---
I think this is a question better suited for r/gaming. This has never happened to me before I I honestly don’t know what to tell you.
---
The game originally lacked the capability to team up with friends, but that changed. Survivors are now encouraged to team up and communicate. Hell, you can do it through Steam, you don't even need Discord/TS... It wasn't even intended to be that way, it just didn't have SWF in it's early days. And I've been playing since release, the game is much better now than it was then, and SWF is definitely a contributor that. If you're a half-decent killer, survivors communicating over voice isn't an issue. I actually prefer to face SWFs because it poses more of a challenge.
---
No it's not. i dont think it's the same guy
---
Guys give them some time, it’s the second fucking day..
---
Imagine an iridescent head huntress and a prayer beads spirit
---
Imagine 8 swf on discord with 8 insta heals
---
I think I'll stop over thinking so that I can actually sleep
---
Even better: Toxic P3 Claudette.

Or Toxicette. ;)

Oh my god... I'm not drunk enough to hear this.

Maybe a robot or alien

Oh yikes

Are you sayingnit shouldnt wake up vs freddy? Because that would be a good buff for him. If u r wanting to buff it to cleanse everything, that sounds like a really bad idea. Id rather them buff other perks like deja vu instead of buffing an already meta perk

I really wish they would have a login daily like a lot of other games where they would eventually give you auric cells, maybe 100 a week. “But they won’t make any money if they do that.” No, trust me: every study shows that sort of tactic makes people more likely to pay. Gives you a taste. The person who is willing to wait three months to buy a cosmetic is never actually going to use his own money. But a lot of people will get halfway there and say, “Well it’s only five dollars now to buy this skin, so I’m still saving money.”
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
And then players complain because tryhard
---
&gt;Get a taste of perma-sabotaged hooks.
---
Yeah, no. Been there, done that.
---
I'm fine with addons like Franks Mixtape made useless. Did you ever played against a legion with this addon? If he is good( and some bug abuse sometimes) he only needs to hit you twice. Such a fun mechanic. There are a few changes  that I dont line. Like the Bleeding timer is not going down while in  the terror radius. I bet it was only made this way,because they couldnt find a better way for moonwalking and stuff. 
---
I think the fatigue,when missing an attack in frenzy is hilarious,but not what legion was advertised with tho. Kinda wird imo. Guess legion is trapper tier now,but not as bad that people wozld constantly DC.
---
I saw a Rank 2 once, it was like a unicorn. Unfortunately, he played like a fucking potato, so I assume he cheated his way there.
---
Yeah i mean i play mostly swf so it doesnt make a difference for me. The devs should definitely add a totem counter to help the solo players
---
Don't know why but I was reminded of Maniac Cop, so does that mean we could have a Bruce Campbell survivor and killer?... no, probably not but would be cool if we did.
---
If this was implemented then hell, everyone would be hag or Bubba mains,or ash/meg mains
---
Well that would be a huge invasion of privacy and not really possible. It would kill the game. 
---
Maybe people would start using teamspeak again though...? :D
---
And before he was fun to play against? Mixtape legion or moonwalking legion was fun to play against? Ok then.
---
The biggest change was reversed which was that trap's timer would pause when you were in her terror radious. The other change which is still coming in the patch is that it's impossible to activate a trap after the fith gen is done.
---
I was under the impression it already assigned the key to a box when the trap was placed. That's why there are no decreased chance addons and instead are extra box addons. If it was a coinflip at each box there's no doubt in my mind decreased chance to remove would be BHVRs first goto addon for her.
---
No. Just....... Stop
---
Nope
---
:)
---
They sound like things that happen when the killer uses their power. Like the plague noise when a fountain is used.
---
I made blue ones for exhaustion perks for survivors and Hex perks for killers. They blue items are just the firestarters/firecrackers to appear more wintery.
---
  
---
The pink ones for survivor are all aura-reading perks. The pink for killer are the same, aura-reading.  
---
I just wanted variety in colors and thought it would be cool to have it mean something too. :)
---
Judgment is getting cast on Surviviors From the group of killers that literally can't run out of things to bitch about?
---
Stridor has quickly gained a place in my heart because it makes survivors scream rather than whimper.
---
Play With Your Food is pretty fun, not great but it has its moments.
---
Save The Best For Last is the best goddamn perk in the game though don't @ me.
---
..... I'm sickened, but also curious...
---
Oh I'm sorry I'm not a fan of facecamping, I guess I just want my free win
---
Erased from the game. I mean one of the guys even said it
---
I mean the terror radius thing was retarded.
---
Anyone who thought that was a good idea hasn't played pig. Nobody ever plays pig the way people used to play Legion. Her traps are too slow and useless by themselves to play like that.
---
 It's lit up because the perk was active in the sense that your recovery was faster, not that you had the ability to pick yourself up. Like the other commenter said, "Find help" wouldn't have shown up if he could pick himself up
---
"we have people"
---
I mean first of all it was 1 person.
---
second of all, his entire post is extremely shady and I doubt any person that puts forth the effort to play dbd, oh idk more than 10+ hours would simply put their data in a notepad and call it good. 
---
Test it yourself man. I trust the devs over some redditor who supposedly played 500 games of pig.
---
😂😂😂 but it doesnt mean anything, you can pip just by working on the gens the whole match and saving one or maybe 2 teammates. You don't even need to be good at running the killer around. Thats why so many baby survivors made their way at these ranks and alot of people complained about rank system.
---
Is the shirtless Myers real? ;-;
---
I didn't expect it to fix the hitboxes anyways
---
I don't think I've ever had the downside hurt me. And the upside is ridiculous if you know how to use it.
---
But you kept them from getting that sweet BBQ stack
---
Dead Space chapter
---
Isaac Clarke survivor - Base skin has no weapons, no helmet and a broken RIG. Skin can give him a working rig with all the glowing lights and helmet

Killer is the Ubermorph

---
Or give some kind of indication that they have it (white aura when active). Or make sacrifice progression faster if you use it. Or simply make the aura reading instant after use. Or something.
---
It's not very fair how it exits in its current form, especially when stacked with certain perk combos. I think my new survivor build's just going to be MoM, D-strike, unbreakable, and adrenaline. An answer to everything, as well as map with totem tracking so I don't have to deal with the NOED users on console. Imagine a full SWF team with this setup + toolboxes...
---
you're god damn right, clearly all the years of wild hedonism have finally caught up with me.
---
You dont see a lot of shreik posts.
---
There has been something in the ptb where the Killers who had menu music now have that played in the killer menu/lobby when they are selected (Clown, Spirit, Legion, and Plauge)
---
I do it as a troll while I constantly roar at them. At that point I'm about to play a different game anyways or I'm trying to find some enjoyment out of this game because I'm bored as fuck lol.
---
Any competent developer would have seen the backlash over this and would have backed off, would have decided to hold until they had a better idea. Would have just left the Pig as-is, waited to see how she performs, and adjusted her accordingly. Unfortunately, based on what I’ve come to understand about Behavior’s past design decisions they are probably not a competent developer. They seem to make design decisions based on opinion rather than fact.
---
Sounds super robotic though
---
Because you disagree, I must be lying right? Are all of your disputes this weak?
---
Survivors disable messages too, I've run into many Survivors who block messages because they're toxic.
---
Personally I run monitor and abuse, get 1 hit on people and then let them escape. I then use the aura reading to appear in front of them with my tiny terror radius and kill them.
---
There are a few of us out there who have known Peanits through the forum. He's a turd. He didn't like when others had their own opinions on changes made throughout the game, instead, he'd brownnose and try to justify any &amp; all of the dev's changes.  
---
It appears he's soiled his knees enough for BHVR to finally hire him.
---
This looks like the lori I played with earlier. I bet she thought she was doing good but I was really just having her help me break all the pallets.
---
I've seen them. I killed a rank 2 or 3 today as a rank 12 level 4 hag with 1 perk.
---
If that's so, Ill come to hate him real quick. I haven't spent a lot od time in the forums.
---
alien robot \*shrug\*
---
Thanks for the clarification instead of just downvoting lol. Good to know forgot about the speed boost to recovery
---
Well for survivor side i've made [PuppetHands Ash](https://gyazo.com/583442bab13522b24641c49ece0c35f3) and [Farmer Jake](https://gyazo.com/b48c69b640903b13b039db21679806bc) 
---
created as profile pictures, really, so their not the right size for the in game portraits as is
---
Many times I saw that he always adequately answered adequate questions in the community forum. Perhaps he is just a little worried about live communication.
---
But think about it this way. If it was a very significant amount of BP that means you are furthered in getting better perks or more add ons. And that means the more SWF the more cheesy OP add ons you can take to deal with swf. Sounds fair to me.
---
You can do it if you have any left but it'll be completely useless as there is no way to activate it. Only traps that were already active or were activated by the fifth gen will remain active. Survivors can leave with the trap on as long as it's not activated.
---
You aren't literally locked out of putting a trap on a survivor's head, no. The change is that UN-activated traps do not auto kill when survivors run out anymore, and since you can't activate any traps without a gen being done, traps effectively do jack shit once gens are finished.  
---
You can slap traps on all 4 survivors once the gates are powered and they can skip right out the exit gate with not a care in the world.
---
No, the chat disabled because the host left.  But the thing is if the Dedicated Servers are doing their job...  There is no host...
---
Honestly I feel like 2 had the better story/atmosphere, but it's gameplay absolutely faltered. I know there are things you can pay attention to in order to figure out how to get from point A to point B, but you kinda miss those in your first playthrough and doing that reduces it to trial and error gameplay.
---
Same, one time I did this and went to the middle of the map. The survivor got cocky and looked for me. I was the able to sacrifice him.
---
????
---
Feels like one too. This is the shit on PS4.
---
Not My Proudest Fap But Probably My Longest
---
Most unlikely, given the other sound effects, but #5 sounds close enough to a flamethrower. Have always wanted a pyromaniac killer, especially after having seen [this artwork](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/004/828/321/large/tipa_-graphic-piro-killer-concept-01.jpg).
---
I am observing that the other powers also describe it as "ONESHOT" but the power of the new killer is called: OMAN
---
Maybe unplayable was a bit harsh. It would definitely bring about a clear heirarchy in character strength, tho, and I think that's even more boring.
---
Not officially. Although I'd LOVE that, the guy who's been the center of those rumours (TheWorldOfRSB) has started hinting that it's not DBD.
---
That looks like stalk. Like a myers stalk?
---
Because doing something non humanoid would be too much trouble, even hag was a ton of trouble, but at least she laid some ground work for short killers. Although that was a long time ago so they might have changed their mind.
---
... i made it
---
Xbox is the same. Lately though it's not as bad. The rank 20-15 are dicks. I cant say much about 1-8 though. I stay and ranks 11-14
---
Wow I love it
---
This gif is amazing
---
Instead of a terror radius, it’s “vaaanjie” faster and faster
---
It's actually embarrassing how many killer profiles I look at after the match and they have an entire 2-3 paragraphs about how "If you loop me i WILL tunnel you. I WILL camp you." As if they're literally not playing looping simulator 2019. People be cray
---
Yeah I can see how non humanoid wouldn't be easy but a humanoid type alien would be fine. Dbd has made enough money for them to do whatever they please I'm sure.
---
I wouldn’t say that game was anything like dbd actually, but it was really, *really* fucking boring. Three games in, I was kinda just like, *why the fuck did I buy this?*
---
Yet only one survivor could utilize the full effects. Plus I doubt Swf players would let their friends die just to get a speed boost
---
It doesn’t work on pc either but i never see anyone mention it must be low count of spirit players
---
I think you’re just being lazy and incompetent.
---
It used to work before the most recent patch, you can try reporting it
---
Proof? He seems okay on the forums, from what I've seen...
---
Maybe, but i dont know as "called" bhaviour the pwer of Myers...
---
You can tell she's good cause she's not throwing down the ~~pallet~~ cake too early
---
**EDIT: The power refers to the files of Killer_16, since the power refers to it with 16_oman (THE NAME OF POWER) I have been investigating and the power of Myers is 9_stalk, the front number is the DLC.**
---
The gorgeous sight of a job well done.
---
“From where you’re slugged this must seem like an 28,000BP string of bad luck.  But the truth is?  You were potato from the start.  (MORI)”- Hillbenny
---
I know *I'm* a fairy bc I'm fuckin' *magical*, dude. What's that poor straighty's problem?
---
Don't blame the killer. Blame the shmuck who screwed you all over.
---
Gurl idek
---
Rank 1 Freddy main here. You know know what you're doing. People down vote you because it goes against an established view; don't worry about that.
---
Hope he figures it out!
---
Hmm, if I had to guess Oman is likely just a nonsensical placeholder name, but the other values sound interesting. Maybe it's something like a mix between Spirit and Myers, like you can phase walk, but instead of teleporting to where you walk to you can stalk survivors and get some sort of benefit from that.
---
TBH if they call me a tryhard and bad I call them nice and good at the game unless they had MoM, adrenaline, BT, and maybe DS if they couldn't loop
---
I’ll throw my whole game off and chase that survivor. I will bring him to the door though. It’s a dick move, but I think in the end it’s beneficial for both of us since both the survivor and I practice looping

CONTEXT: Im trying to make a new youtube channel, which is why the audio is poor and there is no editing (im a no0b3 wannabe) and I was showcasing a wraith build I made thats semi-viable for people who dont main wraith. No links because im not self-advertising scum. Obviously all my matches were awful because unfortunantly bing bong boy hasnt been good since he was nerfed in like 2017 (I was at high ranks, got hooks but most escaped) but this stuck with me and I HAD to show you guys before I edited
---
Finn OP pls nerf bhvr
---
I just say "No u"
---
The 2nd to last noise is literally from the Labyrinth scene from Hellraiser
---
You know ... behaviour is not very good with the names, in the documents of powers come out: stalk (myers), bomb (clown), ShockTherapy (doctor), blink (nurse), dream (freedy), etc ... .
---
I'm pretty sure they just made up excuses instead of saying "no scifi" lol.

Please. Revert. Killer. Ranking.

There's no downside to running it.  It'd be too good.
---
Sterfano 100%
---
People who get off on verbally abusing people, go fuck yourselves and die in a ditch. That's all I'll say.
---
 but ur myers :(
---
Yeah you do. Because if they facecamp it's a free win for all other survivors.
---
Too bad it got ***FUCKING CANCELLED***
---
Did it looks like you were going to receive an alpha pack?
---
See, I mean he has his advantages. I just wish the numbers favored him a little more.
---
Send some hedonism my way. 😂
---
I’ve been trying to get the achievement for wiggle offs with that same build and I pretty much never get a chance to try. I’m either instantly hooked or there’s just so many hooks around that even half a wiggle bar is enough to reach one. 😩
---
Hmm you do have a point though. How would you change it?
---
I play with it like it is, full on Ace Luck build plus slippery meat, I love kobeing without deliverance
---
*sobs in STBFL*
---
There's two arrows on the chat box. If you click on those, the box closes and won't reopen unless you press those arrows again.
---
Ok well enjoy not actually playing the game
---
It’s refreshing to see people who aren’t willing to improve in any way. It makes me feel better about myself.
---
Same boat, actually.
---
IDK if it already is, but if they just made the quitter bonus the same amount of BPs as when you hook someone 3 times (if you haven't hooked them yet, and BPs for 2 hooks if they were hooked once already) and so on, then I would be happy. Chase and hit points could be farmed on whoever didn't DC if you are a good enough killer, I usually max those out pretty quickly its just the sacrifice category that I don't get maxed like ever.
---
No, the entity explicitly feeds off of *hope*. The survivors aren’t feeling any hope with you facecamping them.
---
im out of the loop, what happened to queen?
---
"I can't keep up with the times and think I'm cool for being lazy and not upgrading to a superior host!"
---
Okay, big guy.
---
Then killers need to shut the fuck up about borrowed time
---
What’s wrong with it ?
---
So the manlet, the Church Guy, and the Beefcake, huh? Not bad, not bad.
---
Yes most people play along the meta, but if you face a killer who always has the same abilities/perks like you suggest wouldn't that get boring?
---
You do you, me tho? I'm calling on a 4 man survive with friends and we're going to destroy all your hooks before you hook any of us, aswell as bring in some Oaks for good measure. FYI I always bring flip flop and boil over so have fun. 
---
Also as along as you don't face camp with leather face, everything I said above is a joke. Otherwise I'll find you, throw **YOU** on a meathook and face camp you with a chainsaw to see how you like it. Am I salty? Yes, yes I am...
---
Yeah let’s just bully this guy remorselessly for no reason! That’ll get BHVR to take us seriously!
---
I wouldn't. Sometimes perks are just bad. I'd say increase door opening speed also, but that'd step on the toes of Wake Up.
---
thats fair. it's just a mini pet peeve of mine whenever this format is used. I'd just use the bottom row.
---
A man can't breathe, he can't fight.
---
Yeah I wanna know too
---
Yeah I agree
---
Well, I do hope Dead By Daylight won't have representation in edgy detritus.
---
Maybe is a Android?
---
What bugs haven't played in a few months because my controller broke
---
What if it's just a Legion skin
---
The juiciest bit of hipocrisy is that you were literally complaining about facecamping in the above comments
---
Nobody would use it.  Hunt: Showdown has proximity chat and people still use Discord to gain competitive edge.
---
That would never happen lol if they got the rights to scream they wouldn’t make it a legion skin it just wouldn’t happen
---
Been crazy dcs lately. Last 4 games I've had a minimum of 3 disconnects. No camping no tunneling and using base killers with no add-ons. Survivors think they can bully a killer without skill and quit when they can't.
---
ＥＮＴＩＴＹＷＡＶＥ
---
In response to the last sentence, that's just a bad case of lag. You can still hit someone that has only just started the vault (maybe even a few brief moments afterwards if you angle it?) from below. 
---
As a killer, I actually will fake going up the main ramp, walk around to the haybales and make them go up, fake going up main again, and the survivor is then blocked and can only go into your arms. 
---
As a survivor, I'll wait at the haybales for the killer to come up, then jump back over and out the opposite vault. If I'm carrying Balanced Landing, more often than not, I get away or at least get a pretty big headstart. Everybody always expects the survivor to bait the killer on the haybales, lol. 
---
Note: this doesn't work when the game bugs out for no fucking reason and lets survivors vault over the blocked window (which is actually a lag issue as well)
---
Ahhh right! Was thinking you were the killer. That sounds about right hahaha
---
The problem is that mind gaming or juking a nurse barely delays her, and she can make up any lost distance in an instant.
---
What about the noise before a match starts after the countdown is finished?
---
I know, but what I’m saying is we have no examples in lore of the entity feeding off of survivors’ rage. As far as we know survivors don’t actually feel rage, mostly just hope or despair.
---
A good meme, let’s push it through
---
This is so bad, just like an instagram meme
---
i see your username
---
sowdog540
---
they dcd and ur myers
---
*misery* a rebuff that makes the killer more likely to DC
---
Yep... I get Coldwin as killer and The Game/Lery's as survivor.
---
The legion changes are just as bad too. Rip them both...such a shame
---
Sounds like a legit PS4 game...I feel the pain.
---
&gt;the entity feeds on strong emotions, for example 
---
It just feeds off of any strong emotion
---
Accurate
---
Not really. Texas 1’s infamous ending is literally a chase down a long ass road.
---
Dead by Daylight could easily take inspiration from Identity V's 2v8 mode, which is surprisingly balanced. 7 generators that take longer, a new shop system to buy perks and items, and a different hit system where each survivor needs to take 3 hits to be downed. It could be done.
---
So far you've:  
---
1) Accused me of lying  
---
2) Assumed I rarely, if ever play.

3) Claim I'm attempting to debunk a post (simply by sharing experience)  
---
4) Claim I'm exalting said experience as being "law"  
---
5) Claim my post was irrelevant (Deals with camping. 100% relevant. Are you willfully ignorant of context?)  
---
6) Order me not to post, based upon a statement you disagree with. 
---
All because you disagree. That's what I would consider weak. Unless of course you think false accusations are a sign of strength.  
---
I don't camp. It's not my thing. I rarely see it unless there's a rank reset and I've tumbled down the survivor ranks. Regardless, whether you like it or not, camping is a legitimate strategy. You and all the other whiners desperately attempt to force their own definition of fair play upon the community. I'd be willing to bet, based upon your fervor, you protest camping. Even so -- since beta, with almost 5,000hrs play time in (PC), not only do I rarely see campers in such succession, I don't care. It's part of the game. Now you can accuse me of attempting to "debunk" a thread or topic. Have fun.
---
Here's another great idea. How about a Wendigo and Josh from Until Dawn? I get BHRV is only doing humanoid killers, but that doesn't mean we can't get a standing Wendigo. Also, the way Josh ended up in Until Dawn would be the perfect way to get him into the Realm of the Entity.

Steam forums

Supposedly it's bannable now if they dc repeatedly but I can't confirm that it actually happens especially on console.
---
Pretty sure you can literally cheat in kyf and not get banned.
---
You should be able to see the Killer's ping too. No point playing on Dedi servers if you have 60ms whereas the killer is on 200
---
2 spine chill 3 premonition lol
---
I ran it over a dozen times with the fastest toolbox possible and it was useless...(always went straight to end game)
---
It can't, and even if it did you could appeal it by messaging EAC.
---
"And that's a fact, Jack!"
---
It's NOT bannable, jesus christ people.
---
I think noob3 used Sky Pack, you can find it from Geistra's Twitter, all you need to do is replace the perk folder in your dbd-files.
---
What if it’s ALIEN or xenomorph from alien vs predator
---
The SAW chapter (pig and tapp)
---
Nightmare on Elm Street chapter (nightmare and quentin)
---
Halloween chapter (shape and laurie)

Lmao yea, thanks brother &lt;3 I won’t dodge when I see you anymore Bc ur a qt &lt;3

everyone send OP friend requests lul

Cheaters
---
Have you tried being good at the game?
---
hahahah i always mute my tv in case I want to remove my headphones to talk to my parents. usually, I am in a party room so it is basically mute but faster.
---
Then survivors be like “KiLlErS aRe OvErPoWeReD”
---
*falcon cry*
---
“Requiescat in pace.”
---
Yes but nurse NEVER needs ruin, even at r1. She's the strongest killer in the game and wasting survivors time with it as nurse is unnecessary when she can down so easily
---
I feel like that should be a thing so those 3 perks aren't completley useless
---
How can someone be mad? If you're going to be afk,  at least you can let your team hook farm you,  since they have to do everything else because you choose to ready up and do nothing.
---
4 bonds on Nurse
---
Once you learn the maps and realize what strong looping areas look like you will learn not to fully engage in the chase. Usually I drop a chase if one of two things happen:
---
1. They drop more than 3 pallets
---
2. The chase is longer than 45 seconds. 
---
It also depends on the killer you’re playing with. I usually drop chases more with high mobility killers because they can easily find another survivor.
---
I only have two killers P3, Clown and Myers but you'll hear it even if you have good perks on a killer and do badly (I.E. Nurse). Assholes will be assholes and for some reason some survivors just can't understand that you can level up a character without playing them.
---
I'm spam running Flip Flop/Tenacity until I get the Cutting Out achievement. I know it's incredibly situational, but I've been hyped for Flip Flop since they talked about it around Clown or Spirit's release because I really hate how rewarding slugging is.
---
My crowning glory so far has been a game against a Nurse. She slugged me and hooked the only other survivor and I managed to get into a fairly open area before she picked me up. Flip Flop worked, I dodged about 3 attacks (honestly more than I had all game) and unhooked the other person. To my surprise she SLUGGED ME AGAIN while she chased them off the hook, I got to the exact same spot before they died.
---
She came back and just stared at me knowing what it meant, but she let my bleed out tick down to about 3:59/4:00 before picking me up and trying for a different hook. I wiggled off, she smacked me and I bled out before I hit the ground.
---
It may have been a death, but damn that felt like a win.
---
so cute!!! happy oinks
---
Lmao yeah
---
I didn't mean 60ms is bad. I meant "this happens even on 60ms matches". 60ms is amazing on the normal game
---
[removed]
---
Its not just that situation, it happens constantly with him for me. Probably because he is so small, I just underestimated his lunge and get hit where other times I would have been more careful, dropped pallet sooner. Plus its probably survivor mindset itself. Everyone say freddie is bad, so they take it a bit to easy in thinking " oh it's freddie, we will win this easy", when against lets say billie you are always on your toes not to get sniped from across the map. And his endgame is dirty as hell, because if he puts all people to sleep, no way for you to wake up when gens are done and you are healthy, with remember me it takes about 3 years to open the gates.
---
In my experience it's far better to farm a few achievements at once. If I don't get slugged a build like that achieves 0 in a match, so I've been running Tenacity/Flip Flop/Solidarity/We'll Make It and I'm going for Wounded Healer at the same time.
---
They're both very reliant on how other people play so devoting an entire build to either would feel incredibly shit if I didn't make any progress in a match, at least this way Cutting Out is a much more passive farm.
---
I thought it'd be a nice perk if it removed your scratch marks for x seconds when you were unhooked/kobe'd. It would be a nice perk to deal with Nurses/Billys/Spirits who instantly return to the hook, and might make a nice combination with Breakdown.
---
fair enough. thanks for the clarification!
---
Players are idiots and can't handle being punished for AFKing. He stayed till everyone escaped to call us bad. he only did it because I was Legion and the streamer in the lobby said the afker and the dcer said theyve kept getting against legions
---
Last Year was really fun, before everyone got good. I still want a Technician for DBD
---
I dont get it whats wrong with the pic?
---
ok
---
It might be a recycle of legions origional concept, origionaly legion was meant to stalk survivors to gain frenzy however it was later reworked to include a double stun instead (out of fear of it being OP) and then reworked again to not be a double stun due to complaints of the killer being weak (Which made it even more OP than the origional plan *pretty good job so far*). Now that legion is going to be an m1 killer and that legion seems heavily inspired by ghost face it would make sense for the devs to use the origional concept for an actual ghost face.
---
#Concept I pulled out my ass for the power based on this knowledge:
---
-Stalk a survivor to build up power.
---
-Upon full stalk ring a survivor to inflict them with the exposed status effect and make them unable to hear the heartbeat while the phone is ringing.
---
-If the survivor hangs up the phone within 32 meters of you get 8 seconds of a secondary power.
---
-Upon activation of the secondary power gain increased movement speed and the ability to vault pallets and windows.
---
-Upon hitting a survivor with your secondary power you will get a whipe and the surivor will become inflicted with inflict deep wounds, the power will become fully regenerated after this and will become active again.
---
-Consecutive hits with the power will depleate deep wounds metre by 50%.
---
-Missing an attack or getting stunned will cancel  the secondary ability.
---
Likes? We do not do that here
---
Well freddy is getting a rework. Its probably gonna suck. I guess since mettle of man is meta now. I recommed STBFL to get someting out if the hits.
---
The two people here in the pic I couldn't hit them or pick them up until the exit gates were powered.  Then when they were downed they teleported to the exit gate that was opened and this was all I got.  I mean it's whatever but who TF cheats on this game.  Like whyyyyyyy.
---
That "Get fucked" was perfect
---
What a cunt. God people can be real shitty sometimes  
---
"Oh, I died in an online game? Better spoil a long awaited movie for someone then"
---
People who suck at the game cheat.
---
You are right but she can't use a lot of time going back and forth for the same reason other killers shouldn't face camp ir proxy camp.
---
Oman is a country and thus most likely a placeholder name.
---
They use country names as code in the files. They’re not related to the content though.
---
I dont know cause I dont play killer but I hope you find the info your looking for. You could search best freddy builds on google or youtube. Maybe watch a monto build or something
---
*Especially the porn.
---
This. Often times placing the trap is inefficient, using it to mind game tho, hell yeah gamer
---
If you stop running, it is REALLY hard to find the survivor again after a crucial blink fail
---
It is what it is.  I reported them both in game and on Steam I doubt anything will happen but one of them already had bans on their account according to their steam profile so who knows.
---
there will always be latency issue if the killer has 100ms on your server while you still have 50-60, same on all games with dedicated servers
---
Dude this template in general sucks butt and f13 is so garbage it's only enjoyable with friends and that's all the positives for the game
---
Thats something i wish the devs would address the reporting system. What is and isnt reportable and where the reports go.
---
Been a while since I saw one of the those movies might have been a different one
---
Gripping your pillow tight?
---
Wait, you can kill yourself not irl?
---
Tbh id much rather get MacMillan maps than most of the other maps
---
In what world does Myers excel though? Most times I play against Myers is doesn't go well for them at all unless someone's being a dumbass with feeding him.
---
Oh you again. Come on bro dont promote on reddit.
---
I saw the change and thought, well thanks for trying, but it's still shit.  
---
Maybe if you gained a repair bonus speed per dead survivor or something. Obviously then it wouldn't be as high as it is now, but like, a + 3/4/5% repair bonus per dead teammate or something?
---
Wtf just read this Mettle of Man perk, WTF IS THAT? And really, they have been promising a Freddy rework even when I used to play last year, so I don't really think its gonna happen anymore lol definitelly gonna try STBFL, but I just love Remember Me x.x it'll be hard to let it go...
---
Tks for the reply &lt;3
---
What I’m getting at though is the Entity already has the killers to feed off of for emotions like rage, hate, anger, etc., which leaves survivors with providing the positive emotions like hope, desperation (kind of the same thing), happiness, etc.
---
My favorite thing is when I see them again seconds later. Oh boy my ebony moris and my Frank's mixtapes are hungry and they won't be for long
---
exit light?
---
I remember the firs time I played and M&amp;A Freddy and I was like oh this is disgusting. So naturally I started doing it and love it LOL
---
Is there a blood hunt going on this weekend?
---
Ohh come on Mikey, she was working on a generator with ruin up and hitting great skill checks on console. She deserved that gen completion
---
Why would someone downvote my post, it’s a discussion I don’t see anything to disagree with.
---
I really like the altar concept actually. I feel like the reward should be a little better to encourage more survivors to do it but I'm all for a secondary objective.
---
Maybe it would be a little too strong, but a cool idea could be that collecting all the skulls makes the hatch open if it's spawned.
---
Exactly!
---
Oooh that's good too, what perks you think are the most OP atm? Like, when you're going against killers, what perks are you more afraid of and what perks do u usually use the most? I was watching Tru3Talent just now, still as good as he was when I left, but I really think I'd learn more reading here on DbD Reddit, with the players themselves, than going around on Google reading random people talk about it xD tks for the hint, tho!
---
Apparently Feng also learned how to phase walk
---
Nope.
---
They said this would happen if the server you were about to join is full (EU Frankfurt for example, 500 is max atm), this error msg would pop up
---
Your server list has woefully inadequate coverage, even for the US.  I say this as someone who designed flow control systems for data centers.  Geographic distance is the most important thing.  Your US East server is in the Midwest region but is poorly placed for that region, leaving half the people in the Midwest with poor proximity to every server.  California is the size of Japan and you have that region serviced with the same issue of geographic position that the Midwest has; everyone in the various state regions has poor proximity (Southern California, Los Angeles, and San Diego regions are essentially out in the cold).  You've left the northwest region completely without service.  Ditto for the southwest (Texas), South (Florida), and northeast (Mass) regions.  Quite a few things to keep in mind:
---
* The speed of light is at least 31% slower traveling through fiber optic cables in the earth's atmosphere.  You're not getting close to c in travel speeds.
---
* The infrastructure does not travel in a straight line.  It is a lot of zigzagging.  Further increasing distance traveled.
---
* Only a portion of the travel time is as light signals through fiber.  A good portion of it is as electrical signals traveling through the circuits and network fabrics of switches, routers, multiplexers, and other forms of networking hardware.  They all add additional latency at each device, which adds up.
---
With proper coverage you can get RTTs in all of the contiguous US around 22-44ms.
---
He didn’t feel the same :(
---
Remember me is getting nerfed, mettle is basically anti camp rescue, and the rework drops next chapter patch.
---
I would've used Identity V instead of Friday the 13th :P
---
I mean, the tournament winning Nurses did _exactly_ that, so I don't know what you guys are talking about. 
---
Literally all the Nurses did was hook, 3 gen, tunnel/slug off hooks.
---
Found the bi curious incel.
---
Hahaha...yeah..
---
Fire up OP please nerf!
---
I have this issue on ps4 too. I dont run that perk though.
---
fuck Amanda
---
Sigh...what you are saying is like modern statistics are all bunch of dumb-dumbs gathered around some irrivelent data talking nonsense.
---
LOL Look at all these down votes. The irony is, you're the one accused of being fragile. Soon we'll be accused of expressing our toxic masculinity.
---
https://youtu.be/u2qT7GylRxw
---
It's not quite the same, but there's a lot of other similar sounds and pieces of music [0:57](https://youtu.be/u2qT7GylRxw?t=57) sounds a lot like #3
---
oh? i play a lot of Spirit but i just don't touch pink and purple add-ons. i've tested them some time ago but remember i had Sloppy and Bloodhound so can't really tell. did this happen recently?
---
I’m full blown gay and currently waiting on a dick appointment. But I’m sure you thought that was clever.
---
Just sayin... Chainsaw Massacres are the best movies. I’m glad LF is in DBD.
---
So casual homophobia isn’t toxic, or is your reading comprehension truly that bad?
---
Robot who overrides the chase music and being able to Jason teleport but have a little stun for like 4 mins
---
it's only on consoles. on pc as survivor it takes you like 10-30 seconds to find a lobby. as killer though you wait for 5-10-15 minutes disregard the rank(unless purple for some reason or unless got "lucky" getting full swf)
---
Not sure what noed has to do with anything.
---
Thanks. That's the video I was comparing. I'm not hearing it too much, but your timestamp for the comparison to #3 has reassured me a tad. I'm not ready to say it's definitely Hellraiser content though.
---
&gt;notthe
---
But you did. Bye!
---
why the fuck.
---
I was about to comment that. #3 sounds like something that would be layered into chase music, just like Myers. Maybe they're really hyped for this killer?
---
Don't you have a restroom dick appointment to attend to?
---
It sounds like parts of the soundtrack for any/every 80s horror movie
---
It's data but chance is chance. Just ended a game where I search 3/4 boxes against a Pig who slugged w Knockout and Third Seal. It's all CHANCE.

Please. That’s so... college. Still though, more exciting than what you’re capable of ;) Have a nice night with Rosy Palms.

Oman is just the code name.  It'll change to the actual power name at release.
---
Y'know you gave me an idea, corpse party. That would be a fun chapter
---
How could I be so carelessssss
---
To be honest the sounds here make  me think a killer in a diver suit or something. Or possibly that massive miner killer in the movie My Bloody Valentine.
---
Vs a wraith with what appears to be Unrelenting 1?  Sounds about right, these days.
---
Bullshit. A few times in a row sure but it's literally impossible to get it 11 times in a row. I'm not sure if you thought you would get easy upvotes or what but this is just sad.
---
Rosy palms? Nah... that's so... grade school. I have plenty of excitement, thank you.
---
god this is awful to read on the left side
---
I'm way too lazy to smack your dumb ass with all the math involved around it but yes it seriously is impossible getting it 11 times in a row with the amount of maps that are in the game. Even if you were to burn a Coldwind farm offering 11 times you would still not get it 11 times in a row let alone without an offering. Thats how rare it is. He just made this post to seem funny.
---
Wake Up new meta?
---
Predator?
---
Bruh, first 10 games I played as Trapper I got The Game, no offerings on any occasions... you might be right...
---
Guess by that logic it's also impossible to win the lottery since the odds are so little. Wanna tell that to all the people who won it? Who gives a fuck even if he exaggerated.
---
NO.
---
Do NOT use compressed air, as this can push dust further into the system.
---
As survivor, the two best feelings are:
---
-	you and your whole team insta-DC against a  Legion
---
-	a killer seeing you and ignoring you because they couldn't catch you earlier in the match.
---
Ps4 : Randomly getting stuck in the vaulting animation until hit. Very very annoying as you cant move until you are hit
---
I dont know how to reproduce it it just happens
---
Ok I'll watch tomorrow cause mandatory online is what seems like monster Hunter world is
---
i strongly recommend to not play Freddy till they fix MoM(sometimes hit wakes them up and if they heal after hit that didn't wake them up they become invincible). from Freddy main to Freddy main
---
MoM - Mettle of Man. new Ash Williams perk. the fourth m1 hit doesn't put you down. m2 also doesn't if you were injured.
---
TBH its actually a killer buff to remove it. On the live game survivors can cancel the hook save and dash through the hooked person, if the killer swings at this moment, he hits the invincible hooked survivors and has to wipe his weapon. Now he just hits the savior no matter what. 
---
Killers can exchange their BM for an actual gameplay advantage, too bad this is a buff to hard camping...
---
I had this with my launch PS4 Pro.
---
Over time, your systems resting temperature (and thus, fan speed) increase.
---
Certain games kick the CPU usage to 100%, like DBD does on its startup screen. This causes the fans to speed up, hence your PS4 sounding like the USS Enterprise.
---
If your system's resting temperature is high enough, then the CPU getting kicked up to 100% will make the system think it's overheating.
---
Best bet is to either replace your system or get it professionally cleaned.
---
I know its cool to shit on F13 here, but as someone who came from that game a year ago, at least I never sat in hour long queues :/
---
Sound effect 5 sounds like something from FNAF
---
No, I'm not suggesting a FNAF killer or wanting a FNAF killer. But my guess is we're getting a demon/ ghost killer. Especially seeing how on the official DBD Discord (in the official announcements section) one of the staff just posted "ghost" randomly without context. 
---
Ghostface is also planning on getting something going on whether it be a game or something in DBD based off Paulie Esther's video. May be him perhaps?
---
fuck off thot
---
Aftercare, prove thyself, quick and quiet, Botany Knowledge, alert, bond, Distortion, breakdown, diversion, dance with me, hope and lightweight

Not bannable, there are plenty of tutorials out there.

This is what Joker does after the events of persona 5

Duck face selfie, “gaymer gurl teehee :3” bland generic crap.
---
Don’t promote here.
---
But... you just became what you hated..
---
Maybe now, yeah. But F13 is a game that has lost all support and will never see any updates again. Dbd has no excuse.
---
Nah fam it would be lit.
---
Don't forget /r/dbdgonegay too.
---
you don't need an internet connection to play mhw
---
I only play in 2 lmao, you can play in 2’s however the wait time fluctuates, it can range from like 10 seconds- 10 years
---
You can queue up with a group of 1-4, and regardless of how many people you have, queue times can take 1 minute - 30 minutes depending on the day, time, rank, and everything else.
---
Ok perfect thank you will give it a try
---
Entity Nuke
---
I don’t think my PC can stay on 10 years tho :/
---
I've actually been using it exactly like this on PTB to great effectiveness
---
Anti camp rescue? You must be a survivor main
---
No, we only had to deal with cars flipping upside down for no reason, getting stuck in trees, watching people glitch up to the Packanack rooftop, losing our ability to heal for a patch, and having half of our matches end literally before they began.
---
But thank god the matchmaking used to be quick.
---
The PTB usually lasts a week so it should finish on Tuesday (unless there are more things they want to test). The patch usually is released a week later so it's likely we'll get it on the 7th of May.
---
I can top that, I kickstarted the stupid fucking thing :( Played a grand total of maybe an hour? Just... terrible.
---
You mean they played the game?
---
I'm using NOED from now on. Every match is a SWF with Adrenaline, DS and Borrowed Time.
---
BHVR has said the servers are really only to test pings right now, basically they weren't expected to work well they just needed more data
---
Hag is in an appropriate spot strength-wise, but she just has some pain points.
---
* She's countered too hard by flashlights. She drops from A/B tier to D tier if they have too many.
---
* The slow post-tp feels really clunky. It's preferable to the old stun, but I'd really like to be able to lunge.

Some of these actually seem really cool ooooo
---
Her end-game WOULD be stronger if her traps worked during the End-Game Collapse. The thing is that if a Pig decide to not use her traps until the final moments of a game, shouldn't she be rewarded for doing so? She still needs to find, chase, catch and give them a hat..
---
Again, entirely possible. It's simply the only data we have to actually analyse since nobody else seems willing to sit down to waste 1000 RBTs worth of matches. I'm not cemented in the fact that it's real, because like others have said the only evidence to support it is that someone says it is and we don't have a concrete reason to doubt them.
---
It's also not the key point in why Pig's add ons need to be overhauled, nor (in my opinion) the key reason behind why she needs buffs to compensate for the nerfs she's getting. I know some people hate RNG regardless but if it is truly random which box is the correct one, I can live with that. (Though again, I still think weighting it to the 2nd or 3rd box would be a healthy change.)
---
*seemingly endless and anguished eldritch screams in the middle of Haddonfield street*
---
resilience doesn't effect vault speed anymore
---
Yeah it's just pallets being utterly useless. If the pallet stuns it should counter any attacks that we're thrown too late. Way too many killers just take advantage of this by getting a free hit and pallet now.
---
Hashtag relatable..
---
This disc is full of killer mains, so no matter what I say I'm going to get flamed. But they developed the game while not being ignorant to the fact that voice chats, LAN parties, etc. exist. They knew from minute one that people had the capability to communicate. Perks being "invalidated" by SWF weren't intended to be as strong as you think they were, because as I said BHVR knew that communication was available and inevitable... And the "good killer" thing is a meme, but I'm not intending for it to be a meme; I'm 100% serious when I say that even a half decent killer can handle a 4-man SWF. I don't care if it doesn't prove my point to you, it doesn't change the *fact* that survivor communication is an inevitable and integral part of the game.
---
And big dick on you for beating Marth's team, massive congratulations. You're right that it doesn't validate anything, I don't know why bringing that up has anything to do with what we're talking about. Not every SWF you face is going to be top-tier; most are just a group of friends trying to have fun.
---
I agree the bugs were horrible and gamebreaking, but it's better to play a buggy game than not play one at all.
---
How much did you pay
---
I’m gonna try to remain neutral and explain why people are saying “fuck off thot,” so don’t get offended at what I’m about to say. It’s because they don’t care that you’re a twitch streamer, they don’t want to see it you advertising yourself here.
---
It's more showing how stupid people are than venting that I'm talking about. Like this guy who has "funny, chill, and respectful" in his bio going off on me because he thought I was going to camp him when I clearly wasn't. So he killed himself on hook.
---
That kind of thing. Again, I'm not sure how the same meme formats can make it to the front page on a daily basis, things that take 2 minutes to edit in some text, while salty encounters are completely banned, even if they're more unique than said memes.
---
It sucks really for most killers to double pip with only their base perks. You want to keep moving and hook everybody 3 times, but chases shouldn't end too soon, otherwise you get less points, etc.
---
If she’s that good why is no one playing her?
---
PC: Restarted game and saw that I lost hours of progress. BP I made are gone and the 3 dailies that I finished are back.
---
I've heard people say they got short bans from doing this, but it seems to be safe enough anyhow that the risk of being banned for a few days is the worst case scenario.
---
Nice you got 25 consecutive kills and got the tac nuke.
---
Really? That’s so fucking stupid.
---
I always thought they wouldn't stray away from humans that got corrupted because that is kinda how they tie everyone in. Everyone in the game was human at some point that gets turned into a monster because of the entity (or dragged in because they were already pretty monster-like). That is the reason I assumed they never did a divine killer like an angel corrupted by the entity or even plain ones like a demon or lich.
---
is it possible to get the perks to look like that on console??? I see it everywhere and it's so prettyyy I want it
---
I work for a gambling company. Our job is to make fun, fair games. Most of our games require player input and as such games become more complicated. We are still obligated to tell people what the best strategy for that game is, for it to be fair.
---
As such, we run millions of tests. Just yesterday I had to test once for 3 million games and then later 10 million games. Some of our other games we run billions of games, and these are games where, just like DbD, randomness is involved and player choice matters.
---
So don't come talking to me about your bs. If I ran 50 or 200 games like you did, every time I showed you the results they would be drastically different.
---
*all you have to do is have control over the game*
---
Seriously do you hear yourself? The only way pig has an end game is if she slug traps at the perfect time before the final gen pops and even them most survivors will be up and the downed one will for some reason be the only one with unbreakable or they'll straight up have adrenaline to which they'll run, take the dunce cap off in 30 seconds (if even that long) and then leave
---
Pig is dead unless they give a major rework to add ons around *roars like loon and giving away your position before you attack* ambush
---
These look good, I'd love to see more. David's boxing themed, hags voodoo looking, clowns colorful but melancholic, hillbilly looking woodlike etc
---
Limp bizkit

I just posted in the other thread but if they did alien it kinda messes with the "humans that get corrupted by the entity" concept. Like every killer has been a human that ends up killing and taken by the entity but aliens or divine stuff just would be harder to write a full backstory too. Aliens, corrupted angels, demons, liches. All would be ok ideas for killers but they can't really start off as human. They would be cool though so I can hope.
---
Can be.
---
It can also cause issues with fans spinning the wrong way, from what I've heard.
---
I wouldn't recommend it, but you can actually remove the top of a PS4 to clean the fan.
---
I disagree with you but respect your opinion. I, personally, would rather wait longer for a good experience, rather than have more of a worse experience, in the sense of these two. Now if the difference is minimal, I'm with you on that, give me the slightly worse one faster, but we all have our judge of a threshold for tolerances.
---
No, I totally get why they would say that. I guess I just don’t understand why it upsets them to the point to say mean shit?  Can’t just scroll and don’t support?  
---
Do you know how many things people say that I just keep my mouth shut to spare someone else. The excessive “PIG CHANGES MAKE ME MAD” posts are exhausting but I don’t read them. Or seeing people justify things I don’t like.  I see “fuck off baby killer camping is for trash people” WHY ARE PEOPLE SAYING THAT??  Say what you don’t like about things, not about the person.  People camp more and more because of the hate people spread.... do people not realize that?  They feed off of it.   If people were just a bit more positive shit would get done, I believe.
---
Lmao, you were so upset by my comment you replied twice.
---
I got bullied as huntress one game a while ago, got one of them the next Lobby and went full sweaty. Iri heads, infantry belt and Mori.
---
Sorry to the other three survivors lol.
---
I am sirry but, seriously? I agree with SOME placements but the other are just not correct.
---
Pig, Doctor, Legion, Nurse, Clown for example should switch places.
---
I dont really agree with a lot anyway 
---
I agree with Freddy and legion. 
---
I dont think anyone else needs significant balance changes, it depends by what you mean as significant, I dont think cannibal should be slowed so much while powering the chainsaw for me thats minor. Maybe nurse but even so not that much
---
Minor changes would be leatherface (isnt slowed as much when powering chainsaw), trapper (carry all traps and starts with them), pig (her traps needs to activate in a different way, right now its too out of her control), doctor (base shock is way too small).
---
All the others are fine, I dunno what your issue is with wrath and hag, wraith is weak in chases but his stealth is valuable at getting free hits. I dunno what else they are supposed to do with him, hag is fine one of the top 5 I dont think she needs anything doing with her.
---
“I’m right and you’re wrong”
---
Okay have fun being this delusional
---
No idea, it's just stupid. The only adept I haven't bothered with is the Plague's because I don't feel like going through the hassle of getting a double pip on a killer I've never played.
---
It has emission masks so iassume it would.. might even flicker i think
---
"Trapper feels much too oppressive, at least with addons. Not only his traps can arm themselves, but you will be downed even if you'll get out of them"
---
"Nurse feels much too oppressive, at least with addons. Not only she can have 5 blinks, but she also can use ebony mori"
---
Man, just don't be greedy vs. plague and you'll be fine. Also, use those goddamn fountains. They'll heal you faster then purple medkit. She have "T2" power that lasts less then minute. If she doesn't use fountains to get to t2, they will be cleansed after 5 of them will be "plagued". She is only good vs. greedy survs who will try to repair gens in her terror radius.
---
"starting to"?
---
Because only a survivor main would think its a "camp rescue" as opposed to what it really is. A major crutch.
---
Yikes, that's certainly something. Sounds like it was a bad night, but he's probably getting pretty sick of DbD.
---
Plague is fine, shes top mid tier but thats it. Even compared with the double emetic build a billy can still down you faster and easier. 
---
Good survivors should not be cleansing willy nilly against a plague
---
Ok
---
Haha
---
Only prestige if you wanna flex on your friends or like the cosmetics
---
People can post about whatever they’d like. I totally understand why people should, things wouldn’t change if they didn’t but I have the choice of reading or not. To reply, or not.  I choose not to be hateful, it’s simple.  
---
Trust me, I won’t be posting my twitch on here. But if there was a guide to posting, where and when I suppose I would.  I just didn’t think 1 post out of hundreds would matter this much?  They’ll get pushed down quickly with how many people post. 
---
I just want to know why it riles people up this bad?  No one who actually HATES me for it will give me an answer. 
---
You’ve been helpful and thank you.
---
Canonically you can eat a dick
---
Wait I love this! Clown &amp; Legion has some jams for themes, even clowns over stayed it’s welcome I still loved it.
---
Thank you for your comment. You’re so sweet
---
You’re so nice!
---
Jake is literally so hot
---
Also, if they can do backpack meg, biker dwight, and miner boii jake, how can they NOT do Bunny gal feng min??
---
Anytime.
---
I dunno why these things arent removed the moment they are spotted, they are pure just promotion of a stream with no discussion, just come and watch me stream.
---
I dont even mind the people who post uninteresting clips of themselves playing as at least its something to talk about.
---
Moonwalk for three minutes. Break every pallet on the map. Don’t let the survivors touch a single gen.
---
Watch puppers. He is a really chill dude who almost never gets angry.
---
So the first survivor automatically dies?
---
Wraith and Trapper are good, if you ask me.
---
So the problem with what you are saying is this, 1) camping and tunneling increases in the middle and lower ranks during blood hunts because killers are desperate to get as many points through kills as possible, and 2) MOST of the current DC'ing is due to issues with the game itself as the devs have been tweaking code to prepare for dedicated servers. It sucks, it does ruin peoples matches, but far too many people are experiencing disconnects due to game issues that you cannot ban people who are dc'ing unless you can address the networking code first.
---
I'd make it so it doesn't wake you up BUT make it actually work vs the PLAG
---
like, heals you from broken but doesn't fully cleanse sickness, so you'll get it back if you're running for a while
---
Wow dude I am not dure ehat you mean. I counted all her addons and she has 5:
---
Videotape
---
That grey crouch thing
---
Tampered timer
---
Jigsaw sketch
---
Create of gears.
---
Once you start using "lore" as an excuse you're truly lost. Seriously mate its boring and ruins the game when killers camp
---
I'd make it so it doesn't wake you up BUT make it actually work vs the PLAG (Freddy's getting reworked tho, so dunno about the waking up part)
---
Ok wonderful, you work in gambling and don't understand statistics. Careful not to let your boss read this thread.
---
Im the same way, I dont so much mind camping though its really boring to play against but its that the killer wont accept or admit they are doing it or makes some excuse for it.
---
My friend started playing 2 weeks ago and she's got her progress lost 5 times already. I lost it once myself too. I wouldn't have noticed if my ritual didn't come back.
---
The survivors should compensated as well for having X less teammates. It sucks having to do an extra gen while having a person gone.
---
Id take coldwind over lerys, the game, haddonfield and yamakoa estate.
---
Ohoho. I wonder how will Pigs or Myers perks will look like.
---
^^^^not ^^^^really
---
Steam doesn't have a report function for hatemail?
---
While they shouldn't be saying "fuck off thot", neither should you be advertising your Twitch here. Report them, then find another sub to post your advertising.
---
Nurses calling tier 2 tho👀
---
This is why, if a bunch of survivors are being toxic jerks, I'll just shut my system off.
---
Bye bye all y'all's points
---
I just hope the leaked Jeff outfit will be purchasable with shards... It doesn't even look that fancy (compared to Jake's prospector/David's mechanic outfit). I don't even think this Legion skin looks that fancy or over the top. I don't see why they should cost shards... At least make some simpler reskins purchasable with shards...
---
Best part is, if Ace had wiggled, he'd have gotten free.
---
Oh I love assholes getting their just desserts
---
They add Daft Punk as killers? Sweet!
---
I honestly think you're completely missing that this is a situation where the results are either going to be a 1 in 2 chance or a 1 in 4 chance. This isn't gambling with hundreds of possible outcomes which, yes, does significantly increase the number of trials required to get accurate results, because specific outcomes are import.
---
This is far simpler and 1000 tests are enough to see a valuable trend when player choice and map positions should be random enough to not alter the values overall.
---
Essentially the devs have stated the key is placed randomly. With only 4 possible places it could go the amount that are close vs the amount that are far away should relatively counter each other out across 1000 trials. Similarly for player choices, as no player in the match should *know* where the key is, they can't alter the outcome. A Pig can't choose to hook you nearer nor further from the key as they don't know where it is.
---
The number of trials required for significant data changes based on what you're assessing, and something like this with so few possible outcomes IS observable with 1000 trials, even if gambling is not.
---

Well on ps4 I'm TheVinsinator12
---
Like you said; there simply aren’t enough players for it. And even if there were all this does is alienate people who want to enjoy the game with their friends. Even top of it you make queues take even longer if you’re just in a group of two because you’d have to either wait in longer queue for another specific group of two or could only queue as four and that happens way less than you imagine. 
---
Rather than force the player base to deal with that, bringing solo play to a similar level of SWF means we can balance the game expecting the game to have that pseudo SWF level of communication and allowing the game to be balanced off of that.
---
Well if the Terror Radius didn't just appear, but faded in, it might be well hidden
---
There are like a million discord-Esque apps.
---
Yeah honestly I’m not going to be doing it anymore. I deleted the post.  It’s discouraging, I don’t even want to advertise anymore. Because no matter where I go people are going to be rude. 
---
Someone said something though. Share good clips! It’ll help and it’ll actually give people something to talk about. I learned something and that’s always good.
---
It’s been months sing her last cosmetic line.... at this point Just give her something:(
---
Holy crap, the clown is just fucking disturbing.
---
Morf is funny as hell, good at the game and generally seems to have a lot of fun with it. He’s been my favorite out of all the big names for some time.  The game has been in a bad state and I understand it gets frustrating but just switching games for a channel that’s known for a game is difficult and financially terrible for a streamer. You keep half of your viewers at best and you have to learn how to be entertaining or good at a whole new game. But I agree listening to pug has made me kind of dislike the game more. I took a break from his channel and was having more fun in dbd.
---
Can anyone else hear an underwater/foghorn type feel?
---
Either that or alien
---
Well it wasn't like anyone REALLY expected BHVR to actually make something that wasn't broken right?
---
Dedicated Servers won't be fine, for a good 6-7 months, and they won't be perfect for probably over a year or two
---
Mechanical

Well she's not a bad looper
---
Check out Farmer John, if you want some variety! He just recently started streaming after doing YouTube for a while
---
Exactly, "Oman" here basically means nothing, as it's basically like saying "Spoilers."
---
I’d recommend kindred if that happens to you a lot
---
Oh
---
No it's just you have no argument so theres no point in given a legit counter to what you said.
---
You would need a perfect scenario for the pig to have an endgame build.
---
this was hard to read
---
Wait, wait wait. How would I know I won't like your post without reading?
---
The reddit complained about paying for killers and the solution was paying for skins instead, now people are complaining about buying skins, whats the next solution?
---
Definitely me when I’m playing Trapper for a bit. I know it’s probably better to go back for it but...
---
Keep practicing!  I would love to edit and push out content. Maybe one of these days. But don’t give up on something that makes you happy.
---
I guess you have never visited /r/2007scape ?
---
His is why I love playing Hag. I have to remind myself of chase commitment and that bleeds into my other killer games. I don’t commit to chases as Hag unless I have traps or take a moment to assess the game’s state.
---
A Medium vault has a wider hitbox &amp; stops your momentum after you vault meaning the killer has a solid second or so to land a hit through the window after it has been completed. Usually medium vaults are really easy to punish as killer.
---
A fast vault has a much smaller hitbox &amp; when completed, the player's momentum remains to allow them to run away from the window after it is completed. It's significantly harder to punish as a killer due to the smaller hitbox &amp; survivor moving away from the window faster after completing it.
---
I believe spine chill had its vault buff removed. The devs claimed it was unintentional during a stream. Do think resilience still buffs medium vault speed.
---
That’s pretty much the goal of Yvie’s drag tbh
---
r/RedditSings
---
So that's why the Legion grunts and looks at their hands after they end Frenzy
---
There are 5 gens. You can be sure that the last two will pop after the first three are completed. Just use your traps before hand. You have 4. If you can't down 4 people before all 5 gens are finished, you may want to re-evaluate your choices here.
---
In the live servers, the final survivor has two ways to beat the pig in the end game. One, get the trap off and leave through the door. Or two, take the hatch. If the survivor is found at all (easy, they're going to be by one of the boxes) then they'll have to try to loop and dodge until they find the hatch and hope to win the standoff. If they aren't found, they can get the trap off and try to scurry out the door.
---
Let's say we take your request and make it live. Pig traps will now activate during the EGC. All pig has to do is trap one survivor, close the hatch, and then follow them until their head explodes or the entity claims them. There will be no counter play whatsoever. Nothing that survivor can do. *Unless*.... that survivor has a key. So if they didn't bring a key at all and happened to be stuck with peppa pig, they're fucked. 
---
That would be like if the last survivor had permanent sprint burst. Sure, the killer could still get them... IF they happened to bring the right killer and mind games them correctly. But it would leave almost 0 counterplay.
---
Literally the only good thing about F13 is proximity voice chat making for some funny moments.  This is coming from someone who nabbed it alongside DBD so I didn't have any bias towards either of them, and F13 is an absolute snoozefest.
---
I honestly don't know any YouTuber that's still playing that game
---
“I think the only logical comment would be:
---
If you didn’t like what OP said, then don’t comment/reply. There’s no need to interact with something you don’t like.”
---
I believe this is more of a passive ability that the killer innately has.
---
I always consider Spine Chill a very underrated perk. 
---
It's very useful against stealth killers like the Wraith, Pig, Spirit, Tier 2 Myers, Freddy. It can be used to stop them from getting the first hit on you which helps remove the need to be vigilant while playing the game.
---
Great against most killers to know if you're in danger of being chased or if the killer is chasing another survivor while your working on something. 
---
Main use though is on the spirit. It works amazingly well for dodging the spirits phasing. So good in fact you can take advantage of it to waste their time.
---
Damn isn't this the fuckin truth. Every time I go against a trapper he's faster than a claoked wraith with the cloak speed add-ons. If only my pig had that level of speed during a chase my matches would be over in under a minute. I only play trapper for dailies and he even feels godly fast when I'm playing him for the dailies. Then I go back to my pig and it feels like she's a fucking slug in comparison. There's no fuckin way his base is 115%. I know it's supposed to be but it sure as hell doesn't seem that way.
---
What changes do you want on nurse?
---
Can confirm.  Usually it's to my own detriment, too.
---
I believe it's I know what you did ast Friday the 13th
---
so that's where the origin of those crabs come from 🤔
---
...just like every other gaming sub.
---
Give her power a CD, increase her movement speed to 110% or so, overhaul her add ons.
---
Bring her closer to the Spirit.
---
A cd?
---
Back when the Doctor was released, I literally stopped playing dbd for a few months out of fear, lmao. This Clown outfit is so freaky, I love it.
---
Soon, it will be Identity V, a DBD clone on mobile. 
---
Note though that Identity V is made with permission and assistance from DBD devs.
---
Has classes for survivors and stripped off a lot of complexities.
---
Cool down.
---
Actually, Amanda has her own theme in the saw series, something I’m extremely surprised has never been brought up before (or at least I haven’t seen anybody mention it). It’s also a really great theme too and I think it would make an absolutely perfect theme in the game.
---
She has fatigue, i think the nurse is in good spot.
---
These look sick, any chance you could release just the backgrounds? Some wouldn’t work with just the background, but for the others I’d love to use for all the perks.
---
Yeah, honestly my beef with claudettes outfits is that they aren't cute. I assume the outfits are designed with her personality and preferences in mind (she seems to be a more modest, classical kinda woman).
---
That knife looks like a cs go skin
---
F13 &gt; Dbd
---
Yeah in terms of content, updates, support and such DbD beats it in every way, but in the core experience F13 is way better imo
---
Damn, I wish I could have it on Console. Cus they look so prettyyyyy
---
I LOVE these! Claudette's dress looks amazing on her and I love her hair. Is that Kate in the other dress? She looks great, too.
---
I hear that quite often from the streamers I play against.  I wonder why everyone thinks he's so fast.
---
“Ring-a-bing-bong baby”

THANKS
---
Yeah I'm sorry pal, I couldn't find the post. That picture made me laugh so much.
---
I feel like the end game nerf was the worst one and the terror radius one was a logical one
---
Obscura could also work!
---
Even on easier settings?
---
No. Someone else already answered the question though.
---
Sneak away...it tells you that the killer is looking at you.
---
Isn't it that you can still hatchgrab the surv as long as it's not the EGC?
---
Cause the patch notes specifically mentioned not being able to hatchgrab during EGC.
---
Also, the counter to this tactic for the survivor would be to simply do gens, so it won't be all too effective.
---
IIRC, yeah. I also didn't have very much free time either.
---
Just realised this is a bit of a repost. My bad.
---
Op some survivors will literally complain about every and anything. And those are not the opinions you need.
---
That would just make her Spirit who can see survivors.
---
I've been wanting that so badly. The crescendo should at least play when someone's time runs out on a RBT.
---
Kk thanks dude
---
Huh I didn't actually know that, I didn't even know that was a thing. Also happy cake day!

Don't you need to get 10 hooks for iridescent? If someone DCs you get 9
---
I been trying to bbq my man. For like a week.
---
This is my concern as well. Right now on PtP I'm connecting with Australian players and getting decent pings (green on most matches). I can see this being a significant issue if my nearest server is in Singapore.
---
Wow it’s like it’s the name of their powers
---
I have pop goes the weasel in my perks too but it hasn't been in my Billy's bloodweb either.
---
Oh I didn't even think of P3 Kates, but those can be toxic.
---
If you tunnel a Laurie you'll get Decisive'd, so that's why. Sorry for a late reply!
---
Aus and Africa are small markets for most gaming companies. We get fucked over in a regular basis. I suspect if all Australian players stopped playing they would bearly notice.
---
&gt; Ghostface from the Scream series coming
---
Doesnt have to mean its never coming but Legion is essentially a knock off Ghost Face, even his mori is inspired by scenes from the films.
---
LMAO that would be equally as terrifying xD
---
Developers did it once back in August 2016  
---
Here's a video I have uploaded which came from game directory 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo86o1GyGd8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo86o1GyGd8)
---
&gt; The Survivor is in peril and can be downed in one hit
---
Copied directly from the wiki.
---
Sounds like you've done your time!
---
I believe there is a current thing where a survivor can push a killer if they constantly drop an item near them &amp; then pick it up right next to the killer. The animation pushes the killer slightly. It's not really meant to happen &amp; likely is a bug but it's so minuscule that it's unlikely to ever be looked at.
---
Billy's base kit doesn't need a single change, his add-ons are getting nerfed though. Also agree Doc should be moved up a little.
---
Eh your voice seems fine enough, what's your channel name?
---
maybe 120k ? can’t remember
---
I'm down to play with some drag race folk, then people would get my references for once xD
---
Once you hear her laugh you'll love her, guaranteed! xD
---
Yas kween slaaaay
---
I don't think Hag needs anything, the flashlight thing is a minor inconvenience and the slow after porting is fine if you know how to time your lunge.
---
There was a guy I seen like 2 weeks ago playing. He muted about 10 people in his chat over questions about the game and over playful banter. It's safe to say nobody is playing.
---
Myers main:
---
Line of sight is my main weapon. I need it to build Evil Within. If you deny me that I have problems.
---
Essentially play a stealth game against Myers. Work on keeping out of his way until you can loop or evade well.
---
When doing gens or healing keep looking for him at all times. Monitor and Abuse is a standard perk many Myers will run and it reduces his terror radius significantly. Used on conjunction with the Dead Rabbit add on he has zero heartbeat even in EW2. As soon as you see him, clear out and break line of sight. I run Nurses Calling and it gets me so many free hits from survivors who aren't looking while they heal it's insane.
---
You get plenty of notice when EW3 hits and he has a standard terror radius at that point. If you're struggling then just hide until he drops back to EW2.
---
Read his add-ons and understand how he functions (good habit for all killers). I'd also suggest you play a few games as him so you get a feel for the timing and usage of his power.
---
Omg that's perfect
---
Lmao, yeesss!
---
It does, and you can also report in game. That's what I'm saying. I do both. I take a screenshot of the person telling me 'die in a fire you fucking cunt'. I report using in-game report (which has a comment box that I put the URL to the screenshot). Then I also report their profile through Steam, and link the screenshot there too. Yet nothing ever happens.
---
it's so..... beautiful
---
I played for 500 hours before i got tired. The hole no new content thing really takes its toal. The only thing it has over dbd is you can go into a random match and it be a social type game. I stayed for the last 100 hours just to play with friends I had met.
---
You know, now that I see it, that makes sense.
---
Exit light, enter night.
---
I always thought it was extra light for some reason.
---
Mentally ill degenerates acting like mentally ill degenerates? Wow I'm so shocked.
---
Seriously  it's a waste of time to even think of those creatures as people.
---
That happened to me on Ps4 North American servers a couple days ago
---
Because it happens with literally 99% of the Legion players I get. The point is the absurdity of it on top of an already bullshit game.
---
They could also Implement a streamer mode where your name gets  hidden when you join a lobby
---
Isn’t the idea of the ptb to play all matter of perk/killer/survivor combinations and try out changes, to then give feedback to the devs...? Including the killers you don’t like. I’m a PS4 player so I don’t get ptb but I feel it’s wasted on people like you’re describing OP
---
2k
---
if you aren’t on the PTB then it’s a combination of your internet and each survivors
---
Thanks
---
I've been using the guide you posted some time ago for Freddy, and must say - to great success! 
---
It resulted in me feeling confident in playing him, so thank you.
---
No, in the actual game. Usually the colors of the names will be random(yellow/green/orange/white,etc) but in the PTB, they're all black
---
its from hollowin avent
---
Few things are sweeter than killing a smartass survivor who's teabagging or flashing at the exit
---
Little mini shrine in the basement for the skulls. Visual to show how many are done, and when one is cleansed it warps to the shrine.
---
Once all are cleansed, this final one may be cleansed, for massive team bloodpoint gain and a debuff on the killer temporarily. Slower movement speed, or disabling perks, for a minute? Whatever gets the idea across that the entity is pissed.
---
It s a portrait of Michael, only what’s important is in focus
---
90k with streamers/bbq   :,(
---
He also plays a lot of killer and quite a few of us are sick of the dev's shit.  So I understand his pain.
---
I like watching Pug, but only sometimes. I’m also a killer main and he’s the only survivor main I’ll watch. If he’s in a good mood, his stream is funny as hell. Problem is, you’re right. He gets triggered too easy. For all the shit this dude talks, if one random person says something he doesn’t like, he gets upset, bans them and pouts the rest of the stream. Soon as gets triggered, I know that’s my que to leave.
---
Pretty Good Job So Far

It was the best with friendly fire. Led to some hilarious situations like being held at gunpoint and forced to fix stuff, stealing the car from others, etc. It's a shame the bugs and broken updates killed the game. Honestly one of my favorite multiplayer games hands down. Voice chat made it fun to roleplay too.
---
PTB has no dedi's in Australia.....and my internet was not the cause never has been and if it were i would lag as survivor all the time and in every other game yet i do not.
---
strange, since PTB has dedi with the new update does it not? also I have some aussie friends and they have good internet but it does sometimes fluctuate and cause them to DC so idk.
---
God no. Have you seen how toxic post game chat is At times? Imagine how bad it'd be with proc voice chat, and imagine players abusing this system to micspam or something.
---
Just make it so the killer cannot hear it. Only proxy chat for survs.
---
I laughed so hard out loud at this...
---
I specifically said that it is NOT a nerf performance wise. Did you even bother to read the whole thing? My problem is the fun of a speedy killer is gone and he is just another M1 killer now. I never said he is useless now or unplayable. Completely ruining the fun of playing a character isn't a problem of huR DuR iT tAkES skILl nOw lOl, I have enough practice playing with other killers.
---
On the list of upsides: you are now thicc as hell
---
While i understand the struggles of being a killer playing against SWF-players, it probably is one of the few things keeping this game alive.
---
OT: If i prestige a character like let's say meg for example. Do i lose sprint burst on other characters aswell? Or are the unlocked meg perks still available on others?
---
Totally agree, you spend around 90% of the match searching empty drawers and running far too long a distance between cabins.
---
The other 10% you’re fixing stuff with a boring, easy mini game or being grabbed out of thin air when Jason was nowhere near you and then instantly killed without any counterplay.
---
I’m honestly so glad the game died as fast as it did, it deserved no less
---
Pc: 2 people left and 2 gen left and hatch wasnt visible  after i died it became visible . map Crotus Prenn Asylum
---
They really did fantastic job with David+Jake and Clown too. Legion is not bad either.
---
Are you sure they were cheating? I saw a streamer get bugged one time playing huntress. He couldn’t pick up a single survivor all game.
---
You might be underestimating how shitty the game is.
---
Um, F13 was just terribly unbalanced. The game was an innovative attempt that was looking to fill a niche game that you could play solo or with friends and be a less competitive Dead by Daylight and work more towards being a really fun Fan Servicey game, with Easter Eggs and in-jokes about the franchise. 
---
The only problems with this is that the controls are clunky for everyone, even more so for Jason. Playing as Jason felt more like a hassle rather then a fun experience. Knives were the most broken piece of shit, as it was or still is a Decisive Strike that anyone could use and they could replenish uses of it. It also had a 20-30FPS cap for most players, which wasn't terrible for Xbox and PS4, but PC users suffered. 
---
However, it wasn't entirely Gun Media's fault. This was a Kickstarter game, meaning that they were not working with someone like EA, Valve, Microsoft, Sony. A Company with a lot of resources to polish and balance it before release. They had to release it before money runs out, and with how in depth they were with making the game, this was the case. Jason was Motion Captured by one of the stuntmen from the Friday the 13th series. They worked on the maps, the models, the councilors, each Jason and under the mask, allowing Jason to be killed, which took even more programming. You can't entirely blame the indie developers.
---
It does
---
I hope so but I'm not holding my breath.
---
The counter is you’re a super being with special powers, knowledge of the map and speed. Use that
---
This is a very unpopular opinion here, but. I personally think Nurse is just as fine as she is.
---
Why? She is a killer that actually takes a severe amount of skill, and if used correctly, she can go against a very coordinated SWF. She is probably the only killer to efficiently take down a SWF that gets gens done quick. If we are talking about solo ques, and a Nurse is just tanking everyone then, that's a different story, and I just imagine Nurse to be the killer that we kinda need to stay the same. 
---
Playing Killer and Survivor, it's kinda nice to have that change against it all. It's probably a bad comment to say, but still. I think Nurse is just as fine.
---
^
---
It’s not really *his* cheekbones though. It’s his mask’s.
---
Except it does not really work, because it does jackshit to help you win, especially if you are farmed, and any ebony mories earned from bonus BP (which will have to be at least like x4 to be in any way or form relevant) will never be used against team who allowed you to earn them in the first place.
---
Using an exploit gets you banned, they'll be banned over the period of the exploit and if they repeat offend they'll be permabanned
---
I figured by now there would be some sort of block / pushover in order to prevent players from connecting to the same host over and over again.
---
Yes, unbreakable is still lit up because it let's you recover 20% (sorry I don't remember correctly) faster in the dying state
---
I didn't even come on here for upvotes though, I simply came on here to express my anger. Because that map as killer is the bane of my existence.
---
I've dreamed of pallet dropping co-workers.
---
I was playing solo prior and even survived alone with 2 generators left and escaped. As I said, solo queue every game is on average 10m+ but with my friend it ends in 2 minutes.
---
I just keep chat turned off. It sounds silly but it has changed the whole game feel for me.
---
So a monster made of Flesh and Mud isn't earthy but you know.. ghosts.
---
You mean like Billy is a knock off Leatherface?
---
Pretty cool
---
Yeah... I kinda don’t believe you. I honestly don’t *want* to. If those are your dreams, then your dreams are really boring. I can’t remember any of mine, but I know they were definitely pretty weird.
---
I mean, Saw is pretty damn gory, I don't think Hellraiser is pushing the envelope for the game in that department.
---
While I agree with your point about SWF being broken against m1 killers, autohaven is actually some of the better maps for killers (Wretched Shop aside)
---
Yeaaah no.
---
Don’t revert it, change it again. The old system was very flawed too.
---
For you it's a no. Just because you find him boring to play against doesn't mean every single person does
---
That dream does not represent my usual dreams.
---
&gt; I kinda don’t believe you.
---
It happened wether you believe me or not
---
&gt;then your dreams are really boring.
---
Frustrating is the word I would use. Also, the reason you usually mainly remember bad dreams is because they're the ones that tend to wake you up
---
In a perfect world, you're not wrong. Like I said though, this is a bigger issue for streamers. They are providing content in real-time. The same can be said for a player that wanted to play DbD today but for streamers it usually becomes a more frequent issue.
---
Let's say *hypothetically* that BHVR suddenly took a stance on this issue. Stream sniping is bad, you will be banned if you do it. 
---
This still doesn't fix the issue. Just like abusing exploits, they will be banned **eventually.** They still can ruin the game until that point, and can family share or create new accounts to keep up the 'fun.'
---
MLGA is currently an **immediate** solution (when used responsibly.) You flag the player, and from then on you know who they are. It doesn't matter if they family share, change steam accounts, etc. You do not play against that player.
---
Having a blacklist system is an immediate solution to an immediate problem. Saying they 'will get banned' simply doesn't fix a problem that, especially for streamers, requires immediate attention.
---
Seems a really good explanation which probably explains it. Thanks.
---
The amount of loops is just alot for m1 killers there, but thats only a problem with SWF.

---
lol what? I've only ever heard people use the term bless your heart on bless you when explaining something as wholesome.....I hope he gets added but Ghostface has to come first. I know Legion is like the unlicensed version of Ghostface but a real ghostface would be so damn cool.
---
Sometimes when I meet a nice killer I want to communicate 'thanks' to them but I never know how to do it. I know that ducking is definitely not the way so I just point at them and hope they interpret it as 'boop' and not ['poke'](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b7svkr/dont_poke_afk_killers_with_noed_they_dont_like_it/). 
---
Is there a better way to say thanks to the nice ones?
---
I had this idea too, but felt like asking for streamers to get 'special treatment' might not be viewed well.
---
Granted, this is probably the easiest to implement. Just offering a method for streamers to provide clips+proof of an issue like this would not only offer a direct solution to the player, but would also incentivize players to stream the game (as they can deal with problem players like this.)
---
I think a nurse can win from them though.
---
You know they don't have rights anymore so there is a very small chance it'll ever get updates again right?
---
Identity v is actually a good game
---
No I'm giving him a 12 out of 10 rating and a golf clap for that yeet. I have 2000+ hours mostly on huntress and I dont have the confidence for a shot like that.
---
Only times teabagging really piss me off is when I get run by an amazing survivor for 5 gens and I see the gen monkeys teabagging at exit gates like they did anything
---
So what do the perks do?
---
A good enough player can make any of them work. Just practice man. You’re not meant to win them all
---
2 minutes instead of 3 minutes is an amazing change, actually giving something like bloodwarden a bit of love. only reason remember me is changing is because that if you close the hatch it will be incredibly strong, but reverting most of the things back and giving legion some love is definitely welcomed. i'm glad they at least somewhat listened to us.
---
It aint rare its common now
---
These are audio queues. Oneshot seems to be some coding jargon. Not familiar.
---
He has two cancelable actions called "spotting" and "stalking", as well as a stealth effect seemingly gated by a CD (a la Spirit) and an exposed effect charged up by staking. I'd guess spotting would work like stalking with Scratched Mirror.
---
It also seems that it refers to a single survivor becoming exposed, meaning that this guy's staking only works on the player he stalks.
---
I don't see limiting matches based upon Host IP would be an issue (limiting frequency of same host / session). Hopefully once dedicated servers go live this won't be as much of a problem. There are many factors to consider. Apart from BHVR stepping in and reviewing related data, all I (we) can do is speculate.
---
Thing is, it's not special treatment because streamers are the only ones that run into stream sniping
---
I’ll probably get hated for this, and that’s okay, but honestly I wish they’d just do original characters from now on. The shape and the pig have been great additions, the nightmare was alright, Bubba considerably less so.
---
thats really like the Predator based on their equipments or sometin?
---
Ofcourse im not but its just so coordinated and toxic sometimes.
---
I feel like the fact devs don't wanna go to the limits is really keeping this game from being actually scary. I'd like to see them do at least one different rig model that's less humanoid.
---
One of my faves.
---
Yeah i think ill just do that.
---
What’s toxic about it? Winning in a coordinated fashion? Or actual toxic behavior? Because not every SWF is toxic but it can sometimes feel that way when you get absolutely wrecked.
---
Same. Boring to play alone. M1 simulator. Just give all survivor teams coms and buff killers
---
Yes, I've experienced this same thing, but as a survivor. Had 3 matches against the clown this week and in the first 1-2mins the "host disconnects".
---
....
---
...!
---
Okay, maybe ONE more movie dlc...
---
I agree SWF is exhausting but those perks are fine mate
---
uh the only thing that would take away progress is ptb other then that send a report to the devs because you should never lose anything unless you messed with your game files
---
Revealing the aura to the other survivors when you take a hit is too strong. That is reserved for Kindred where you can tell a killer is camping. Knowing a killer is all the way across the map let’s you know it is safe to do a gen. You get that already from bond or empathy. 
---
If you want something different, then no scratch marks for you and the person you are saving for 3 seconds. Gives you both a chance to escape either from the hook or a hit.
---
There are some great tutorial vids on youtube. One in particular covers pallet locations and types, survivor safety, escape probability, etc...
---
Trying to learn the ins and outs of juking or looping can be somewhat annoying in regular games. It's not a bad idea to play Kill Your Friends with a buddy and practice there.
---
ah, got it. sry I don't watch him lol.
---
My tidbit, use save the best for last. Give them all the smacks. Very useful if you can get the stacks, especially in T3 cause you can stay at 6 stacks after killing obsession.
---
They no longer have the rights which doesn’t allow them to add new content to the game. They are however allowed to change existing content and release bug fixes and balance changes which is what they’ve been doing for a while now.
---
Any way to see them without downloading?
---
They can also decrease all survivor's gains by %50.
---
Idk what OT means... off topic? But the answer is yes they are still available
---
They lookin' pretty good, keep it up!
---
*Laughs in Legion*
---
It's so pointless but at the same time how much of a good time you have is so dependent on it
---
Ruvik is too “psychological” the way he kills. Using telekinesis and spawning enemies. 
---
I think the better choice for a featured killer would be the Safe-head guy, the Keeper
---
You forgot nea’s a killer
---
Spine chill does NOT work against t1 myers
---
That's why I specifically said "Certain perks (Dying Light) should definitely be given the Leader treatment though." in my response.
---
Just limiting everyone down to two perks wouldn't stop both killers from using Dying Light.
---
if they release Ghostface without Sidney as a survivor, i swear to god...
---
Yea thats a great shout. Or maybe laura.
---
Felt like Dwight and Jake were in a bush for most of the game (while Meg did stuff) when I was spectating so I did some cute voice acting because I think they were a couple.
---
[Bonus clip when Jake finally died](https://clips.twitch.tv/SilkyAmericanButterflyStoneLightning)
---
When people don't understand that gameplay wise, the three original maps and its variations are the best ones. 
---
I rather take 10 back to back Coldwind, MacMillan or Autoheaven over 1 Ormond, The Game, Yamaoka or Lery's.
---
This made me laugh. I'm still relatively new so I've been doing all of the above all too recently. I'd like to throw in - 
---
"Why is the spirit just standing still? Why isn't she mo - OH HELP"
---
"You mean I could have just burned those hag traps with my torch this whole time? Aaaarg!"
---
"I don't hear a killer, so I am safe." *insert Halloween music"
---
"Why is that survivor in the grass with me wearing a pig ma - oh no."
---
Kinda weak
---
Was this supposed to be funny? Try again without using disrespectful and offensive terms.
---
&gt; is specially effective against toxic SWF. 
---
Out of curiosity, what do you consider toxic?
---
SWF wouldn't affect ques, might just be bad luck
---
I had to use software to crop it out of the background
---
Would be a bit of a waste to the license, I'll agree.
---
But this could happen.
---
Another interesting point I noticed, is that the Trapper is actually jogging essentially, while everyone else just walks, so it could LOOK like he's moving faster
---
Because they can't, it's on EAC to do, but EAC would do it so.
---
What software and how do you do it? Sorry I'm bad with art and stuff like that.
---
*Laughs in identityV*
---
There was a moment where I was stuck in a house with a Chad while playing as LaChappa, or whatever the fat nerd's name was. He was in character, trying to be snobby and bully me with Jason watching us from a window.
---
Eventually, I found a baseball bat and started beating the shit out of Chad while the Jason player was laughing her ass off, trying to put on my best nerd impression, full spittle speech and everything. 
---
We finally got out to the front and started beating the hell out of each other. We're all crying with laughter while I'm trying so hard to stay in character without losing my shit, but it was no use. Laughter was too contagious and on my last swing, I released a true nerd wheeze as I caved in Chad's face. 
---
Best moment ever.
---
:D
---
Not gonna lie tho, this is me when I've got time.
---
Hey look at that new pretty good lobby design.
---
*pop* nice
---
Eh, I think the problem is is that they were really inspired with The Shape and the Pig, they wanted to add Freddy in, and Leatherface was just added in for name recognition.
---
I mean, I definitely would want Jason, Pennywise, Chucky or Sam (Trick'r'treat) if they could figure out how to add them to the game and make them unique and fun, but if I had to choose between any of them getting Leatherfaced or none of them at all, I'd definitely settle for none.
---
*shrug* people can do what they want i was just saying that it was possible but not likely
---
"Ace you can literally go kill yourself."
---
Fair enough. My thought process was basically that they just either lower the pipping threshold or revert the scoring for Devout and Chaser. I'm fine with it being either or I guess
---
If you watch some good killers play, you will notice that they win the majority of the time, no matter the killer they play, and since they play for hours upon hours time after time, they probably face more SWFs than you by quite a margin. So try to learn from how they play, since the fact that they win pretty handedly even against SWFs shows that there is definitely room for improvement, and that there are in fact literal counters. 
---
(Some examples: NA: Zubat, ScottJund, ryanpez; RU: Mulder, Rafraider, Camper, XAHTEP, DrWaLT; KOR: sal_gu, goku, irrealiste, ... - there are many many more, but these are just some examples of more-known killer players that try hard to win and do win, hours upon hours, day after day)
---
That said, camping is an easy and always especially effective strategy against SWFs, as they tend to be altruistic to their death. And most SWFs are not much better than your average, mediocre group of random survivors, either. If you play and practice a lot, you can become a better killer player and deal with most survivor groups pretty well, even without using strong add-ons or Moris.
---
God I wish they would do this! Just add the number of totems left with small game! Brilliant
---
I've been thinking about this for a long time. That'd be awesome, though it would be weird to see Sebastian helpless and running from his problems lol
---
Or something straight outta Jojo
---
210k perfect game with 5 party streamers + bbq and chili at a bloodhunt event
---
Incredible
---
Oof, being nice at ALL to survivors is the sign that you're a beta and never gonna make it.
---
Seeing Nea's set rendered I take back what I said: it looks way better in-game. I honestly might actually buy it depending on how good it looks in-game.
---
Only the full bundles are discounted to 25% off, not the individual parts. However, by default bundles are 10% off anyway so that it's better value to buy a full outfit. I think it means they're 25% off the TOTAL price, which is only 15% off their REGULAR price.
---
I just checked the math and yeah. Shouldn't it be 810? Instead of 900?
---
The regular prize is 12$, but youll get a discount of 10 % anyways if you buy the full outfit, thats why its 10.80$.
---
The -25% discount is from the regular prize of 12$.
---
The only reason I want original killers is because of cosmetics. Liscenses killers are limited to what the devs can do with them. Besides all ghost face is, is a dude with a knife. We already have legion who is their original ghost face.
---
Thanks OP enjoyed the salt .
---
If someone isn't convinced this proves that people on both sides can be kinda dumb.
---
And I could not be happier that that's the case.
---
DLCs don't go on sale that often so if snag them now if you want them :)
---
Because they think giving survivors mobile phones is a legitimate good change for dbd. it's just ridiculous, and ghostface is not scary in any way. as you said, Legion is their version of ghostface so I don't suspect ghostface will be coming any time soon.
---
I'd much rather have more original and unique killers than... ghostface
---
This too. Licensed killers basically means no cosmetic items. We got lucky with ash.
---
also nah, it's been debunked so i don't think it is
---
Here comes the trapper, you better watch out for his traps!
---
i dunno, that tier 3 effect looks really useful for killers. Since it takes effect when downing the survivor, not when trying to pick them up. So you can immediately chase someone else.
---
If 3 people are on gens and one survivor is wasting their time then thats a good thing. As long as they dont die in under like 30-40 seconds
---
A black pip shouldn't be a challenge. Getting fair 3Ks or 4Ks should not be depips or safety pips. If you kill too early: BAD. If you kill to late: BAD. You have to hit the sweet spot. And as a snowballer killer, I find the gatekeeper emblem fucking me over a lot.
---
Just moving each pip down one knotch would help considerably.
---
I don't get this sub's obsession with shitting on this game, both have a myriad of problems
---
But either way, it's a shame what happened to it, shitty devs and a lawsuit that should have been done with already culminated into a really bad situation for a game with a lot of potential
---
Sorry bros but in May it's a Ghostface annoucement and he's probably the best killer for tunneling, and the survivor is fully kitted out with anti-tunneling perks to balance it out.
---
Screencap and repost this when it gets announced in like 2-3 weeks.
---
Yes, you have to get merciless killer. Which is damn near impossible running only 3 weird perks together. I have no idea how to get Adept Shape, considering Dying Light is a massive contradiction to the other two perks. So I've accepted I won't be getting it until they change it to getting a 4K.
---
if i had one hooked and one downed, i'd probably focus on hooking the next downed one. Theres only so many hooks in a game. They can't keep that up forever...
---
But i understand you'd be worried about decisive strike.
---
Personally I crouch and look up I think it works.
---
Nice idia! So what day we all can agre to use our mories?
---
Legion's power now has nothing to do with stabbing someone a lot, nor anything to do with the classic "Ghostface was your friends all along" trope. We already have a few killers with knives, it means NOTHING for how similar their power would be.
---
I'd prefer Ghostface be in the game than not, just on the off chance that "I have arbitrarily decided they would not make him distinct from Legion."
---
A few months ago I just couldn't find games full stop on PS4
---
doing that sort of thing kills your game though. If you make a game that benefits greatly from friends playing together and having fun, but then remove their method of outside the game communication forcibly. They're gonna play something else.
---
They had Billy from the start, it's pretty clear Leatherface was one of the biggest inspirations for the original killers so it makes sense that they got him when they could. I imagine it'd be much the same with Jason/Trapper if they had've had the option.
---
Then what do you propse?
---
Great idea, would very much like to see this happen.
---
However, while the Obsession change does not incentivize necessarily killing the Obsession before they have a chance to open an exit gate, it does still incentivize tunnelling the Obsession to get your stacks, killing them then being merely a side-effect of as much. So I do think the Obsession should get some kind of benefit, still. Maybe something like, the killer's aura is revealed to them while they are opening an exit gate.
---
Bc it's an ineffective dick strategy that just tells someone that they don't get to play the game and killers that do it bitch and moan about borrowed time when it's designed to stop that very strategy
---
shouldn't it be possible with dedicated servers?
---
He is my fav. I learned so much and he is my kind of funny. The one I can't stand is TydeTyme (WhineTyme) even when he makes a good point. He sounds like that D student we all know who tries way to hard to sound smart. I just get that vibe from him.  Look up his videos and at first you think he must be trolling but then you relies he is not. Then he threatens he will quit like anybody cares. TRU3 is the fucking deadhard guy  He missed a swing and it must be DH. You made a mistake its ok.   Then the guy Ardetha who plays Pig and is great at her but spams meme words till I cringe. Last month he said woke every 10sec and this week its the word naughty every 5 seconds. I turn down the volume but still watch him. Thanks to him I love the Pig now and get 3 or 4k games .
---
You actually helped me a lot with this, it makes a lot of sense :O gonna get that STBFL as soon as possible, Shape is almost 30 anyway, shouldn't be that hard!
---
I have seen Tru3 use this build, looks pretty solid, Freddy is a bad chaser so every little bit of help is very good, I guess lol I don't have Bamboozle right now, I think I'm going NOED for now, just for that late game pressure, maybe Blood Warden? Anyway, tks a lot &lt;3
---
All the licensed stuff so far came before there were more than a handful of cosmetics anyway. I imagine it'd be much easier/cheaper to get licensed stuff now with an agreement on cosmetics from the get go than it is to go back and get permission for cosmetics on the already implemented stuff.
---
I mean its not swf its four good survivors. Its definitly hard against 4 good survivors playing perfectly
---
Wha- what?
---
That's an FAQ posted by BHVR, not a forum post.
---
You haven't explained how it's integral. 
---
Do you really think BHVR actually intended for you to add teammates and voice chat? 
---
I have over 1000 hours on this game, and that has literally never happened to me, nor have I ever invited another to chat.
---
At this point you're just being intellectually dishonest.
---
Mine are totally more disconnected and strange. One I can remember is it was Christmas time and  there’s stores selling cookies. So I walk into the library and go to “class” that’s with a game character, and he asks me if I did my book report. I say “no” and he yells at me and told me I needed to buy him $75 worth of Christmas cookies to make up for it. It was really weird
---
Nice job man. You nailed it.
---
For the most part, there's rarely not an obsession anyway because of survivor perks, so more often than not they have perks that make them significantly harder to kill, or show that they're incredibly confident players anyway.
---
With most of the changes to survivor perks, only Object of Obsession still has any benefit for actually being the Obsession, where Rancor, Dying Light, Remember Me, StBfL and PWYF all grant the obsession buffs, exemptions or make it less valuable to go for them at all. I feel like it isn't incredibly necessary for RM to have a downside as substantial as a player being immune to a 1 off effect on a perk, and it would be healthier for both sides if there weren't a major reason that one person in particular MUST die asap.
---
I loved this game, but servers are pretty dead at this point. All my other friends are too busy playing Fortnite 24/7, and they always seem to already have a fourth person :(
---
\- i think hag and plague are fine as is
---
\- pig needs the simple change of "the nerfs being reverted"
---
\- Wraith is fine now
---
Hey , there other people you know be nice even if you disagree or like playing a different role. now I can't really say anything about the ace in the video. 
---
If he enjoys giving someone the hach who he thinks deserves it so be it let the man have his fun in peace.
---
I remember playing Kenny once and being tormented by a Tiffany player with her bear trap. Now this was before you could push players and every other change to prevent griefing, and I was new to the game so it was easy to bully me. At first I was glad to have a companion albeit her weird choice of weapon. She followed me into bedrooms, hallways, windows, etc. and would place that damned trap at the exits while blocking me. She didn't attack or anything or even talk.
---
So I had to pay attention to where she placed her traps because I ran out of meds sprays after she trapped me in the bathroom. After narrowly surviving a Jason encounter with her hot on my trail, I ran to the Higgin's Haven lodge and ran upstairs. She followed me again but I ran back down before she could trap me up there. I had enough so I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a pan then locked us in and started beating the hell out of her. She dropped the trap and fought back. I hit her more but she had sprays. Jason arrived and broke down the doors then punched my head off and let her leave.
---
There's also this one time a Jenny kept bugging Tommy (who was calling the police) by hitting him with a machete. I fought her off until she started limping down the stairs while her character sobbed. Fast forward and everyone alive is by the police waiting for the last counselor to make their way there. I kid you not, it was the Jenny and she was still limping. I don't know how she survived and I remember being more surprised to see her than angry. We did not make eye contact.
---
But then you’d have 4 people with SM and MOM making the killer’s life a hell worse than the one the survivors are supposed to be in.
---
Maybe if it were an obsession perk so only one person gets to use it per match and SM only lets you continue the timer where you left off when getting off the hook before the struggle phase, it could be a pretty balanced way to help an important survivor stay alive.
---
Oooohhh gotcha. I thought it was 25% off the 1,080.
---
I totally understand why they include SWF. But SWF means realtime coordination, which also means any SWF team can essentially have multiple free perks at once.
---
Personally, I consider the first one is just there to introduce you to the concept of the STEM, to Sebastian's backstory and put the foundations of its universe while the second is where the actual story begins.
---
I'm not talking about being chased. I mean the survivors that ran up to the killer, click their flashlight, try to bait a chase, that sort of thing. It usually gives the killer a free hit and takes time away from gens.
---
Idk yet. I think we need a streamer to take charge or lead the way. Talk in chats and we need to name it, get a date and time and other ideas.  It was just a thought I had when I noticed we all stock pile mori. That would be a fun day just because of the meta shake up. I would run a way different perk set playing survivor and the killers would feel more powerful.  A final boss mode I guess.
---
Reminds me of a Nea in my most recent match. I (Freddy) was trying to get all my bbq stacks. Nea was struggling on the hook, I had 3 tokens and I see the last survivor (Kate) I hadn't hooked run towards the hook. I put Kate and Nea to sleep and chased after Kate. After a little bit, I pick Kate up and she gets flashlight saved by Nea. Fair game, but then Nea starts flashlight clicking and when I look in her direction, I see her T-bagging. Didn't take me long to get her down. I pick her up and get decisive struck. 10 seconds later and she is down again (she also became the obsession, giving me my last Remember Me stack and allowing me to enter the end game without the obsession)
---
I think I will level up clown....
---
Aidennnnn
---
They vwen ripping people off lol. A full outfit cost more than a DLC.
---
Is there enough "oh yikes" or should I help out to.
---
teamspeak exists, all the other voice chats exist and then finally Steam
---
You are correct, no tracking perks work against T1 Myers. Not spine chill, not premonition.
---
&gt; emoting
---
I never use this as a means to BM, just an interaction/communication, ya know it's the only type of communication i have as a survivor. Didn't realize how butthurt people get by a simple gesture...
---
Dude this post was meant to be half serious and I can’t believe you took it so personally. Sorry i struck a nerve
---
It's not a matter of rank at all, in fact. It's more about the game saying that "this is considered a victory and you should reap the reward."
---
0/10
---
You can't hook 4 survivors in 2 minutes so I don't think its that short. What people are telling you is the best advice. This game when you start makes it seem like killers are really strong and you will just die but you need to just learn the basic mechanics of the game, the killers abilities and how they play, the perks and how they affect the game. Like the example you have given had that killer hooked someone? If so they probably had BBQ hence knew where the other survivor was.  
---
Also if your new you will be paired with people of a similar rank so you don't know if they had just been very obvious to a killer when they killer went in the area. When you play solo as well their is a higher chance your teammates are better but if 2 new people are playing SWF then that is 2 weak links in the team so more chance the killer will do better. Just keep playing it does get easier.
---
Pocket knives and teammates are the counterplay to a stalk-shift grabbing Jason. And the smaller versions of the maps are made for people who don't enjoy the biggers ones and want a faster match.
---
I see the Entity has a taste for Neon
---
Yes
---
I get hate mail
---
they posted ghost to get rid of the ghost discord ping for mobile users.
---
Y my pp hard
---
I was ;)
---
 I think we have really good SWF that will be up to the challenge.  If you can make it on that day. Your team has ascended.  However I do think we would have non killer mains try to join in.  So maybe we should mix in BPS incentives as a reward for having the balls to play survival. Maybe killers can not run perks. Idk we have to vote and need a leader.
---
The Obsession mechanic for survivors is in a weird place right now anyway, what with Decisive Strike making a random survivor the Obsession, regardless of them having the perk or not (or any Obsession perk, for that matter), as well as potentially changing Obsessions throughout the round, and Mettle Of Man not having any benefit or downside associated with it being an Obsession perk, for the respective survivor.
---
I don't think the Obsession should be exempt from RM, but some small benefit due to having a target on their back would be in line with the other Obsession perks, while not really being a hard incentive to kill the Obsession more than anyone else, either. If the aura reveal on gate opening is perceived as too much of an incentive to kill the Obsession, the benefit could be something else as well, such as applying a type of reverse-Mangled status effect on the Obsession, allowing them to be healed/heal themselves faster, which would also kind of work for the perk in as much as in order to get more than 4 stacks on it, you regularly have to let the Obsession heal up at least once, anyway. I don't feel like RM really needs this from a balance perspective, but just as a function of Obsession perks, something like that would be in order - survivor Obsession perks should have a slight downside when not the Obsession; killer Obsession perk should give the Obsession a slight upside. (This could also be how they can potentially adjust MOM, changing its requirements or effects for non-Obsession survivors a little).
---
Seriously if they release a Scream chapter and the survivor is some guy from series 3 of a shitty TV show I will be raging
---
no only when you use the endurance part
---
The premise is the same. That's why Friday players also shit over DBD all day.
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
It was really not a bad game, but it went down way too fast.
---
To be fair Monto makes it funny mentioning you should like and he showed that people are lazy and don't do it when he said he would upload twice in a day if the video before got to 12k likes and it did. If people aren't supporting in that way to make it a viable option for him to create content for us to enjoy as a career then he would disappear.
---
I don't think they will have a ghost face chapter, they already have legion which is their version of ghost face. Another guy in a mask with a knife? I don't thinkthey are gonna do that, but that's just an opinion
---
Am I going crazy or did 4 kinda sound like wings?
---
I’ve seen my bf get this glitch a couple times and every time it freaks me the hell out
---
I think you really didn't read my post. I have no problems survivng when playing solo queue. It's balanced but every single game of queuing with a friend was a trainwreck.
---
Again, I have 0 problems queing alone. I escaped lots of games and even finished solo.
---
This is a perfect solution. Reduces the need to tunnel the obsession while also making the perk scale very well with how much it is needed at the end game.
---
Great job.
---
Again we can have incentives to keep swf playing. Just streaming you and your buddy's making it through would be fun as hell and the bragging rights.If you are the master of SWF prove it!  I would play both side just because the change of meta.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
I got you, don't fall. \*Whispers\* We will win...
---
Ebony mori :)
---
I wish I was on PC I would download this in a jiffy.
---
love it good job mate.
---
Yes but that is my point. Your saying your new so when solo you have 3 people who can carry you, you have give an example of escaping with 2 gens and a hatch escape does not take skill, you could of immersed around the map with the other 3 taking the killers aggression for example. When you SWF you are 2 new people, so 2 weak links in a team which is very easy for a killer to take advantage of.
---
I actually still play F13 and White Noise 2. 
---
I love both games. I can highly recommend WN2 if you need a break from toxicity. Just make sure to sign on in the evening to find players.
---
so its just double pip and kills doesnt matter? I mean it would like you wouldnt need a 4k but numerous hooks and 2 kills minimum? plus whatever else is needed
---
They gone to far now! I will use 10% instead of 5% of my max power, now they will pay!
---
No kidding. It's just like "when next we meet, I'll save an Ivory just for you..."
---
And 3 minutes of a guy circling a pallet
---
That’s a great idea. Overwatch implemented something similar and if you queue up in a group you cannot commend your party members. Also you cannot comments the same person more than once in 24 hours (I think that’s the time limit). Then when the time period is up you get a number of loot boxes depending on how any commendations you got. 
---
TL;DR Blizzard made it work so I am sure BHVR could do it too.
---
FUCK EM UP FAM
---
BE epic.
---
Who said I used the hatch? I got the last 2 generators myself is what I meant. I usually get 1-2 generators and can evade pretty decently and rescue my Team mates too. Though I'm not very good at looping yet.
---
New mask actually looks good. What would his power be?
---
🦀
---
The only thing worse than the people who say "we don't need an iconic 90s killer that a lot of this generation grew up on because the Legion exists" would be if they added Ghostface and made it the TV series version. Better not to have him at all than have that.
---
(MAYBE it could be ok as alternate cosmetics, not as the default.)
---
Ah yes, I forgot about Kate's chicken-hooker outfit.
---
Just look how gorgeous my girl Kate is right there
---
The floor is toxic waste
---
Hmm
---
Halloween event medkit, heals faster I think but has low charges
---
That would be an easy way to balance it around SWF! Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only problem with how OW does it is it rewards you for Commending someone but you don't really get rewarded for getting commended, right? Or do you get a reward after a certain time? I haven't played Overwatch enough since they implemented it.

GHOSTFACE CHAPTER FROM SCREAM TV SERIES SEASON 3:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhz8pj/ghostface\_chapter\_from\_scream\_tv\_series\_season\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bhz8pj/ghostface_chapter_from_scream_tv_series_season_3/)
---
This the reason I used the salt/rant flair.
---
That works for sure. I remember a few losses where all four survivors were doing that in a line. Gave me a pretty big smile despite everything.
---
I’ve kind of done the same thing as I was wasting peeks aiming purely for wiggles. I’m only missing 4 achievements now and wounded healer is another. I also need the be 250 take a hit for the team achievement. Feels like you only get credit for farming your team so I’m not getting much credit on it.
---
&gt;It’s not a case, I just wanted to point out the toxicity in this game
---
Don't need to point out something that everybody already knows. 
---
Capt Obvious.
---
How dare you share your opinion. I agree with you, but downvoted.
---
&gt;  nerf a lot billy
---
lol what now
---
This requires an ultra rare ad on and ultra rare offering. That’s the balance.
---
What?
---
do you even know how stupid you sound by calling someone a "beta"?
---
Yea, at least you can get sone WoL through addons. I still got about 30-40 purple bags and 50-60 yellow bags.
---
I mean, I play both. Jason is my favorite slasher and F13 really nails the horror movie cinematic feel better than any other MP horror game I've played (DBD included), but DBD is obviously still supported, has its own unique style of gameplay, and actually has a future ahead of it because it never got caught in an IP lawsuit nightmare.   
---
Never understood why people get hostile between communities for the same type of thing. The more asymmetrical horror games the better, imo.
---
You get the rewards after a certain amount of time. I can’t remember exactly what the time period is since I haven’t been playing for a while. Depending on what level you get. Like c number of commendations received is level 1, y is level 2 etc so you get more loot boxes the higher your level is. At least that’s how it was working last time I played.
---
It was also on the last year sub which was weird.
---
Gotta say i love the concept of involving more l4d characters in the game
---
Yep, that certainly feels like the case to get credit. But I never wanted to throw matches over an achievement. So I just always had BT on and would go for only and last chance saves on people who needed it here and there. But thanks for the input. Then once these 3 are done it’s a matter of LFG for the 4 man hatch escape lol
---
I wish DBD had chat. Not in game, or maybe proximity chat. But for sure at least I’m the load up or in the menu afterwards.
---
Flaccid pancake
---
"She is probably the only killer to efficiently take down a SWF that gets gens done quick."
---
That's the main problem I have with her. I don't think it's fair to have only a single killer that can do so, nor do I think it's fun. I'm not a great Nurse, but even if I was I would never want to play exclusively her to be able to efficiently take those SWF down.
---
Potentially ONLY add the option for survivors to give props to the killer or the killer to survivors. Prevent survivor-to-survivor "props to everyone but the killer, haha!" but you also probably wouldn't get anything if you never gave props to the other team.
---
it doesn't only happen in SWF anymore. everyone expects everyone else to run adrenaline now
---
How is stabbing the same guy tunneling? I never found it useful to go after other people unless I was using mend time add ons and people usually weren't near each other at all, so I usually stabbed the same person. But that's not tunneling. I'm not chasing the same guy off hook over and over. If that's tunneling, then so is blinking to the same guy twice as nurse or throwing hatchets at the same survivor twice as Huntress. Letting one guy go so I can look for other survivors was wasteful. Especially since other survivors might not be around, which for me seemed to be all the time. The "feel" came from chasing the same guy down and not letting him get away, stabbing him until he goes down. It was fun. Tapping someone on the back and either running to someone else to tap them or just m1ing him to death is quite boring. I guess that's just me though. Not that I'm justifying how he was designed, but I don't like the way he was reworked, even if it makes him better.
---
Left for Dead is gonna be even more rough if the killer can shut the hatch to prevent you finishing a gen.
---
Man this game gives me memories because the summer it came out was so good for me, and remember playing this because it would do me until DBD, but I actually loved it. I met a few friends on it and most of the time people In lobbies had mics, so it was fun even without friends. I think I had left the game before it was ruined so I never really saw it fall.
---
Can I use this as a discord avatar? I really love it ❤️
---
The Entity doesnt take only dead people tho
---
Xbox: Just had a match as killer where all the generator and exit gate lights had this blinding green light. So I couldn't really see anything when I try to protect my objectives. Least all the survivors were understanding why I was acting weird. It was also on the Pale Rose map.
---
Swf isn't that bad if you're not garbage. EU has worse players in general though so I understand u/Mrgolden007
---
But the thing is Sidney is still ALIVE. Randy died in the second movie, I believe he would be easier to write a backstory for than Sidney.
---
Honestly, the "toxic" people you're going up against probably aren't even SWF.
---
My friends don't play the game enough to where I can reliably count on them to make Flashlight saves or block hooks, or even body block the killer for me, so when I'm playing SWF I don't even try to do t hat kind of stuff.
---
It's usually solos where I start body blocking, and that's always when we get accused of SWF.
---
And that's despite all of my friends and I have "Senpai" in our name, giving away the fact that we're SWF.
---
I have a better suggestion:
---
Don't worry about pips, they mean close to nothing.
---
Could be the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers?
---
I lvl Up Jane just to get a nude thights skin and what do i got ?? what do i got ?! well… it's still a nice skin.
---
Yeah, but you dont have to tunnel the obsession to get all of your stacks, especially since it 5 max stacks now rather than 6. You are right though.
---
Lol label it a shitpost my friend.  I think you are just backpedaling however.  Me thinks you rocka rhe babycamps on a fairly regular basis.
---
I hate the devs' mentality. "Not every killer has to be rank 1 viable". So I can't play my favorite killer because they decided he or she won't be strong enough to play well at the rank I'm at? They can fuck right off.
---
It's part of the meme.
---
I dunno if it's the "JK Rowling Format" or if it was only popularized by her, but it's making fun of how people do or say things that no one asked for.
---
Everyone:
---
JK Rowling: Dumbledor's gay and he likes taking ten men at once.
---
I don't know if your joking or not
---
Rank doesn't matter. If you're good enough you'll rank up regardless of swf or not.
---
At least Claudette will be very visible in that outfit.
---
If anything they should release it from Season 1, imagine Emma Duvall as the survior and Kieran Wilcox as the killer
---
I think one of the problems your seeing is what happens with streamers who start to get a mass amount of followers. The only ones I enjoy watching tend to have smaller viewercounts (in the 150-400 range), and tend to be a lot more down to earth.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/umbra_bug is my absolute favorite, she's a stellar huntress, and when the game starts getting her to a point where she gets tilted or wants to complain, she'll either switch to survivor or stop streaming because she doesn't want to put up a stream where it is constant complaining. She streams 10PM ET all days but Friday and Monday so I'd definitely suggest you check her out if you're looking for a chill chat, an interactive streamer, and a great player.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/streamdad_ is great as others have suggested, and is again very wholesome.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/brother_cope is super chill and an awesome person.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/spacelion is really fun and chill as well. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel has the best emotes on twitch, has a larger following than most of the others, but it doesn't lead to shitty sportsmanship.
---
These are the ones I watch the most because the chats are interactive, the streamers are down to earth, and I never feel gross watching them.
---
The game isnt right if a key feature doesnt mean anything
---
Don't see anything similar.
---
At most he would be a time restricted legion that focuses on taking down survivors as fast as possible instead of tunneling them.
---
I feel like we should give the devs credit for what they did fix from the beta: Self care, permanent sabo (traps too), sprint burst cooldown, infinites, NOED being infinite and non counterable, the blood web, nurse standard 3 blink, wraith being more fluid, trapper setting speed and other shit including numerous bugs. We should also remember that we dont always know what we want like when they fixed the hatchet hitbox. I feel we did complain before testing it and im sure they have heard it. And one last thing: This is what the PTB is for, testing
---
She was still alive in Scream 4 ... 8 years ago.
---
That’s plenty of time passed to create a new backstory.
---
Imagine Sebastian and Ash running, the entity might be setting up its own downfall with the people it's taking
---
I know that, I'm just saying, Randy would be a better fit than Sidney in my opinion, As Randy is dead.
---
We will probably get Sidney
---
If the hatch gets closed. Can you open it again with another key?
---
Laurie’s not dead yet we got her for the Halloween chapter. Makes perfect sense to have Sidney as a survivor
---
Also if we're talking optical illusions, consider the default weapon of the base killers. Wraith and Hillbilly have melee weapons that appear longer than Trapper's base cleaver. With all 3 having the same movespeed and lunge distance it make the visual of Trapoer's lunge look off when it's near the max range for a hit.
---
&gt;The game isnt right if a key feature doesnt mean anything
---
It doesn't mean anything.
---
The only objective of ranks in DBD is for Matchmaking and even then, it sucks for the most part.
---
Where are good places to place traps?
---
Survivors aren't meant to have the level of coordination voice comms gives SWF, though.
---
I think you mean leatherdaddy,and you should just read through the perks that you think would suit your playstyle, i find bamboozle pretty fun to play with and pretty useful during loops
---
They just need to tweak the emblems and point system. Certain killers are definitely hurt more than others in certain categories. That's why Nurse and Billy continue to be on top and in every game. They have the "easiest" time patrolling generators and working towards the gatekeeping emblem.
---
Randy makes the most sense lore wise. He’s nerdy enough about horror to willingly come to the fog.
---
More shit cosmetics for more irrelevant characters! Can't wait
---
I need to kno what you consider toxic... then we can go from there.  Because using flashlights and looping isnt toxic.  If you say tbaggin at every pallet I cant take you serious.. so??
---
Hey look I’m every killer in DBD, I’ve been emasculated and can’t kill and take orders from “the entity”. At least Jason is no one but his mother’s bitch (which is movie accurate)
---
Restart your Xbox. If that doesn’t work power it down and unplug it. Those usually fix it when dbd is taking to long to start.
---
i restarted it, i’ll unplug it now and try again
---
Slugger, or are they just being stupid? I think it’s the latter.
---
no, i think he is trying to emulate a guy who easily lives from streaming and making youtube videos in not really popular game.
---
Got the perks and tried it, thano isn't that good for me (not good enough to make it work) but I love sloppy butcher. Thanks for helping me out mate.
---
Yea why not. But the first game was more special to me.
---
I can't seem to activate the perk that is on the left of my 4 perk diamond on the bottom right. How do I do that? Also, sometimes it shows killer perks instead.
---
Window-teching is possible against all killers. Michael now does have collision when going through windows so it is a bit harder.
---
clown will win, his sister bianca already did🤡🖕🏼🤡🖕🏼🤡🖕🏼🤡🖕🏼 and plus we need a big girl to win
---
"haha get rekt dude, we sabbo'd the hook, what're you gonna do about it?.. wait what... you're doing something about it?.. tf bro reported"
---
I hope the Jeff outfit will be obtainable with shards
---
Great.. that clown is going to give me nightmares.
---
We can't ask for buffs because then they buff every killer including nurse Billy and spirit.
---
Yeah kill them all, they deserve more honestly.
---
Well, kinda. You need to find a place with a pallet and run around it. Then when the killer would be able to hit you in the next lap, drop it down (trying to stun him with it) and leave to find another pallet.
---
Those walls with weird shapes, pallets and windows (jungle gyms) that are spread across the map have specific paths and ways to play mind games with the killer in order to confuse him and waste their time. You can learn about them on YouTube
---
killer mains dont get the love they deserve. A good survivor team will always beat a good killer. If they hadn't been teabagging and poorly coordinating efforts they wouldn't have all gotten downed so pathetically easily.
---
I love playing against shit SWF groups.  They try so hard to stop the hook and end up fucking themselves.  The smart thing would be to let me get the hook and leave them on the hook for as long as possible.
---
Don’t forget that head bob!
---
when your the bane of both killers and survivors
---
I dont actually like him as a person but as someone who has grown up around video making (ive had MANY channels and hundreds of videos) I have massive respect for the format and editing techniques (well...more like the placement)
---
They’ve actually modeled their faces, this is to allow them creative freedom when modeling mask skins, so they wouldn’t have to model a face later if they ever decide to have a more revealing mask and it makes it look more realistic. They’ve also modeled Huntress, Nurse, and Trapper for example.
---
Stop with begging for likes. Please.
---
Even legion is weak when he's not exploiting and the survivors dont DC.
---
I think a good band-aid for lower tier killers would be a speed boost when out of chase for several seconds. They could lower their weapon for slightly more visibility as well. Also I think pallets need to be hard locked to 8 per map (8 is the minimum RN).
---
Survivors can take alot of hits in a full game, there's really no reason for them to have so many safe obstacles.
---
Ultimately, its the maps themselves that need to be reworked for true balance, if they stay the way they are, no amount of band-aids will solve the imbalances for all sides. Personally I think maps like The Game and coal tower hit the sweet spot and the devs should strive for less size, more LOS blockers.
---
Hag is arguably top 5.
---
too bad aces perks suck. i love his character so much
---
Looping works better against what we know as M1 killers, so killers that can only hit you by entering a chase, closing the distance and finally attacking when they get close enough. Killers like the Huntress and specially the Nurse have tools to skip this process and require new strategies to be avoided.
---
Ok? Watch the first 3 vids this week and its the first thing he says.... In fact he said he will only put a vid up if he gets 120000 like then he bitches about we are slipping on other vids . wth are you talking about?
---
What were the tweets that were deleted? I tried searching a bit, but in the end I think it will be easier for me to just ask. xD
---
Sure, short matches was/are not a problem and a big part of the community and devs are just desilusionals to think it./s
---
I accept it sometimes. Like beckoning at the gate (ONLY IF I CHASE YOU THERE OR YOU ARE WAITING FOR AN INJURED SURVIVOR) is fine but slamming down a pallet, pointing, and then waiting for me to break the pallet to start running is just a dickhead thing to do
---
This is the same with Freddy. He has the same lunge range as the average killer, but because his weapon is so much smaller, he physically lunges further, to make it seem like his range is actually longer then the average killers
---
I believe in eye for an eye too
---
Spamming ctrl of course! /s
---
Damn unlucky. Why is that?
---
Did you not just say that "we can't just make up lore ourselves."?
---
The wiki explicitly states that the entity feeds on strong emotions, and then gives examples. It doesn't say that the entity *only* feeds on a certain emotion. You're making up lore.
---
That.... has absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
Yes, Trapper has a mining skin, but his mining skin looks nothing like what Warden looks like, not to mention how Warden is just a man and would be a ton smaller. Not to mention the pickaxe instead of the machette. The silhouette is completely different.
---
By this logic, we never would have gotten Leatherface since Billy exists.
---
Dude these are awesome, you’re very talented
---
The fact that the only healthy survivor ran out the gates as soon as I downed him and ash just took the hatch like a good boy is what made it even better (it was a swf group)
---
They look dope - good luck with your exams btw
---
and these could not even be real you never know. one sound does sound like ghostface turning in the robe
---
What happened that was bad the dcs? Apart from that they’re just playing the game.
---
Heh didn’t know if anyone would notice those, I’ve got like 19 so I’m pretty nervous and thank ya!
---
Honestly as long as a team stays seperated and each working on a gen there’s very little a killer could do, especially if they are all good loopers.
---
However it is still possible but very very hard.
---
Spine chill is literally OP
---
What???  He post 20min vids and that's so much work?  How does he do it? Someone get this man a trophy.  It must be agony for him.
---
Dont actually have one yet, im just making the videos rn. This is pre editing so thats why the mic is crackly and stuff
---
Awhhh it’s just paper on cardboard but thank ya :)
---
That's an interesting design. The whole "giving away your allies" will probably only be popular with killer mains though. I like this.
---
Something with counterplay.
---
Obviously the Dc’s
---
Doctor is good for shocking folks at the gate. You may teabag, but you will also scream. Don’t know what the survivor is impaling himself on, but doesn’t seem like a good time.
---
"if you hate hooks so much ill let you die on the ground!"
---
I normally like him and do like hid vids but begging makes me cringe.
---
Sorry that I thought someone deserved to have fun and escape? Ive put more than my fair share of hours in and at this point "not making it" is fine with me as long as I enjoyed my chases
---
Slugging is obnoxious and toxic but it's clearly deserved here, hahaha.
---
There is an EAC bypass going around currently, but usually it's the killers internet shitting out.
---
The majority of the playerbase hates him. Players,who also play him find him boring as fuck to play. Just sayin
---
Yes.
---
I need some proof. Because either my game is bugged or we have a misunderstanding.
---
My favorite is when you hit someone through a pallet, they start teabagging, and then you immediately catch up to them and down them because they wasted their speed boost.
---
It's like dude, if you're going to Tea-bag, be good enough to back it up.
---
Hey, you be nice, Used Napkin is a pro who always does gens
---
No im aware of this but 100% more of the base BP or 70% more of the base BP on top of the already added 100% is better than using none.
---
Space coconut.  Awesome chill guy. Helped make my hag a monster and he is very logical. I can't find a fault in him.
---
no, as in, overall. i know it's nit right now but since dbd is the host there, it's pretty easy to attach party to one side. like in Deceit
---
Ann Titty, on the main stage you... collapsed, and your Sacrificial Realness runway... didn't leave us hooked. I'm sorry, my dear, but you are ^(up) for elimination.
---
so satisfying
---
you’ll thank me when i block noed:)
---
the nea teabagged for one
---
What’s the screenshot from?
---
thats some cute art
---
That last one actually was a thing I "did" because my shitty pc crashed as it was happening and honestly I keep thinking about it to this day.
---
I simply disagree with the part about Legion on 2 main points, 1. I feel like he's pretty ok with the current changes (changing what you use the power to achieve doesn't completely eliminate the power), and 2. I have heard that they basically did such a drastic change to immediately take him down from the broken mess that he was, and creep him back up to viability, which honestly i don't think is that necessary/wouldn't take much at all to do  
---
and in all honestly, the rest of it seems like a basic tier list that just points out that Freddy needs a rework when his rework is already announced
---
Thanks. :)
---
as someone who usually plays solo and rarely altruisticly, yes please
---
I love the nod. The nod is the "yeah we cool" even if they walk away from the gate a little ill just shake my mouse up and down back. pointing kinda says "haha, loser" (in fact ive been called a slur of things post chat by the pointers and have friends that associate pointing with loser (so thats why those filthy survivor mains do it)
---
The problem isn't that the games are too fast, it's that there isn't anything else to do in them.
---
Of course Generators are going to get done super fast if all the Survivors need to do is Generators. What we need is a proper secondary objective rather than just making survivors stand in one place holding M1 longer, unless we actually give them tools to hold M1 for a shorter amount of time.
---
Basically, the only two ways they can make the game last longer without breaking it in half is to increase Gen time to 100 seconds and actually give survivors perks that decrease that time (Giving a trade-off to actually wanting to be a gen jockey), or add in something else that forces the Survivors to stay in the game longer.
---
can't they just give billy chainsaw cooldown? not only he can use it basically any time it also is insta down. spirit for instance has to wait until she can phase walk again.
---
Do you guys think Ghostface will come to DBD with all the proof we have?
---
so the gutted this perk, thanks bhvr, now its completely worthless, you ever stop and think about it being used when theres MORE than 1 survivor left?
---
It'll be someone who's already dead otherwise they can't use that character if they want to make a new Scream film.
---
He was wiggling actually, maybe not hard but im just good at moving with the wiggles at this point
---
Don't face camp that's you killers kill me with y'all constant whining it's not a fun experience survivors usually never get mad at Killers for killing them unless they camp because it's not fun people want to have fun most killers who face camp is usually trash
---
Why would the Entity feed rage off of survivors when it already gets it from the killers?
---
I've got them too, good luck! Also, care to join us at r/Owen?
---
I agree ( survivor main ). Sabo isn’t toxic by itself, but so is slugging. Its the equivalent counter. T bagging is hella toxic tho.
---
SAME PERK BUILD STILL WON 👆🤡👆🤡👆🤡👆🤡👆🤡👆
---
That’s a thing?? Fuck yeah I’ll be there! Also good luck to you too!
---
They made a new Halloween movie with Laurie in it.
---
lmao
---
I really really really really do not understand why survivor streaming is so popular
---
How you gonna have a hot, tall mommy gf if you yourself are incredibly tall though?
---
well, I haven't said it's a bad game, but I think it's not as good as dbd :)
---
META PERKS AND YOU STILL LOST 🖕🤡🖕🤡🖕🤡🖕🤡🖕🤡
---
I mean i never play facecamping killers so u guys must just be unlucky or rank 20-18. People facecamp in that rank because survivors are too busy urban evading in the grass and dont do gens, so they can get away with facecamping. Climb to rank 15-13 and youll never really see a facecamper again unless the exit gates are open which is acceptable
---
Going by this logic they can never make another Halloween, Nightmare, TCM, or Saw movie ever again....
---
I tried to set it up with each perk benefitting one specific side. One for Will himself, one for the Killer, and one for Survivors. I could make some tweaks to them though...
---
**I am not in charge of BHVR's story development team. I am simply restating what is on the wiki. Stop making up lore.**
---
As far as I remember it does say in the Evil Within description that he is immune to any anti stealth perk in EW1. Only exeption is Kindred
---
Dead by daylight has been stealing from The Office this whole time!
---
seriously tho explaining dbd to people is fucking hard.
---
I actually switched from Friday to DBD!! Lol
---
Play the sequel.  It's A LOT easier. 
---
I did completed TEW and even completed it on AKUMU mode (while screaming profanities at the screen).  Here are highlights of those games.  The most difficult one is the one where you have to hold off a horde of zombies in a burning shack:

---
Oh ma god, this is so sad my cake day is ruined ;(
---
They also werent doing religious themes or talking characters and well, yeah.
---
Why not ? Quentin didn't die in Nightmare on Elm Street. Laurie also was in the new Halloween movie.
---
define tunnel
---
Like...the lore? Or the game concepts?
---
Because DBD is probably one of the most simplistic games to explain out right now.
---
You know what they say about guys that are short, right? They have their height somewhere else.
---
First actually pretty decent looking skins.
---
Secondly it's not another made skin so I'm pretty happy.
---
thank you so much omg 😭 i'm actually working on Jane next, she's halfway done, and then i think Kate will be after that!
---
What’s slugging?
---
What platform do you play?
---
oh I was gonna say Frank's a bottom
---
Yeah it's just part of the meme, sorry If it's confusing.
---
Friday the 13th is that bad
---
I've thought about what would make me actively want to play against a full SWF:
---
* Notify Survivor playing SWF will BP gain will be reduced by 50%
---
* After match, Killer gains BP equal to the combined Survivors' reduction
---
Kill em all!!
---
Slugging is a necessary tactic in many instances. Not just ones like this. And it is not obnoxious nor toxic
---
Why is there a megface on meg at 1:24?
---
He is a delinquent/manipulative mastermind so I really doubt it. He must be bossy so top.
---
Focusing on a single survivor from when you find them until you down them, ignoring all other survivors you encounter throughout the chase.
---
Ruvik is way to powerful for this game. Laura or the Keeper would be better. Maybe Guardian from EW2
---
it's when you leave a survivor on the ground to die slowly or u down all 4 and go pick them up one by one but in this case they were being toxic and all in the same area
---
EAC bypass? And it cant be my internet why do people not read or listen.......An EAC bypass will not cause lag issues at all.....And how does an EAC bypass not get you banned?
---
the devs words aren't really trustworthy, just saying
---
Then stop using flimsy excuses to ruin other people’s experience.
---
Burn her alive imo
---
Thank you for blinding me with your light mode, it's 2am for me and my eyes burn more than before because of you.
---
I think this is odd because i've used it plenty of times and it tells me. Maybe its somethimg else he's doing.

I agree. Reddit is for dummbies

&gt;my cake day is ruined ;(
---
IT'S MY CAKE DAY BY THE WAY EVERYONE!!!!111!!1!
---
Well I hardly camp but now that you mention it:
---
It's not my job to make sure other people have a good time in this game. This isn't a team game like league of legends where I'm actually "ruining" someone else's experience. This is a 1v4 game and any action that I take in this game could possibly be seen as me trying to win the game, because once again. There is only 1 person on my team. Me.
---
I don't think the game concept is easy to explain at all. I always kind of feel like a psychopath
---
his comment is a joke... chill
---
&gt;Sure, short matches was/are not a problem and a big part of the community and devs are just desilusionals to think it./s
---
Games go too fast when killers don't know how to play.
---
* They respect pallets. This leads to taking longer for a pallet to get dropped. 
---
* They try to bloodlust. Even if he ends up getting that one survivor without breaking the pallet, he hasn't done anything to clear the other pallets and still took a significant amount of time.
---
* They don't know how to play around shack. This leads to several wasted seconds, just because they allow survivors to optimally vault multiple times before even being in danger enough to drop the pallet. 
---
* They don't know how to mind game in short wall - long wall pallets.
---
* They don't know how to deny optimal vaults in LT wall loops. 
---
* While chasing someone, they go past other survivors working on generators in an usafe area and don't switch targets to push people out of the gen.
---
* They drop a chase to kick gens. 
---
The list goes on. 
---
The core problem of killers has always been their skill level but even then devs still helped them out by reducing pallets count and creating chase perks (Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, etc). 
---
Slowing games down through perks that only makes games boring is not the answer.
---
Aye true, dw I'll get it right next time
---
Are you on Pc? If so go into properties - betas and then PTB
---
Explaining the general concepts of dbd (4 survivors vs one killer. Killers have to try and hook all 4 survivors and kill them before survivors escape by doing generations spread across map) is pretty simple. Explaining how to play the game is impossible as youd need to explain how to use pallets, how to loop, what generators are and skill checks, certain perks, different killers abilities etc. 
---
I've tried teaching my friend at it was hell. I'm sure lore would be hard to explain also
---
I cant blame the survivors to do the only thing they can do to escape and im whit you, the solution is not a longer m1 simulator rather than a secondary objective.
---
Beautifully immersive writing.
---
yeah, I was just saying most of the time its not worth saving high tier bp offerings, because you are not making their efficiency higher, and if you use the bp offerings as soon as possible you'll finish more webs earlier and therefore getting hight tier bp offerings earlier and on and on
---
If you think BMing is a part of the game, then honestly fuck off.

Then they saw him drop them and they thought “That wasn’t part of the plan D:”
---
even if the devs dont give each killer a unique terror radius, when playing killer it would be cool if you could choose which music to use out of the default selections instead of random ones
---
With the audio associated with the next Chapter having been extracted from the game files, and it sounding nothing like anything Scream-related, I really doubt this is coming to DbD as a Chapter. BHVR has always been a little... special, let's say, when it comes to teasing and announcing stuff, even after separating with Starbreeze - it would be very odd for them to have some random fan make the release announcement, especially given how big of a license Scream is. Additionally, R. J. Torbert only holds the rights to the mask, while the Scream licensing is more up in the air as far as I am aware, and he also talked about a Ghostface announcement specifically, rather than Scream.
---
My guess is that if this indeed does have to do with DbD - which, fair enough, that's not unlikely - then it will be about the mask as a licensed cosmetic, possibly for the Legion. BHVR working with Lionsgate could be about a licensed cosmetic deal, for Scream, Halloween, and Saw. (And, if the comments about some of the extracted sound effects being reminiscent of Hellraiser have any truth to them, maybe even for the next Chapter, which could be Hellraiser, given that Lionsgate was involved with a 2018 Hellraiser movie.)
---
ayy

The survivor should always win a trap standoff
---
I hope its something spooky

I found John through his Toxic Legion video being recommended to me by yt when he was riding about 8-10k subs and honestly it's so good to see him succeed so quickly, he's a great boy that deserves all the success that he gets, love his videos

A rank 16 Clown (I don't play often) and a rank 12 Feng Min walk into a Swamp. Feng Min loses her yellow flashlight and all hell breaks loose.
---
Nothing scary or intimidating about Legion at all whatsoever lol
---
Teabagging isn't part of the gam, they got what they deserved
---
Oh the concept of games needing to be online to be played at all is horrible to me. It's only a matter of time before the plug is pulled and all the money and time you put into it goes down the drain forever. I'm enjoying Dead by Daylight for now though and I'm at peace knowing one day I will just not be allowed to play it anymore. There's really nothing I can do about that anyway.
---
The hag isn't made of mud and the spirit isn't a ghost, she is a dead girl held together by the Entity. Even if those were true they are still "earthly" not earthy. They said they want everything to be recognizable or "comfortable" meaning no spaceships or alien planets. Imagine if you were suddenly teleported to warehouse or a forest, you'd probably still freak out by you'd basically still have some bearings. Now imagine being in a space ship or in an alien forest, you probably wouldn't be able to focus.
---
And like I said, it could just be an excuse to either have no scifi, or the simplicity if having only humans.
---
I only really watch his yt highlights every now and then, and honestly for months I've noticed that every time he uploads a game that isn't at least a 3k he has something to complain about... like i like the guy but he needs to learn how to just chill and try not to tilt off the earth
---
I’m going to assume r/foundthemobileuser since I am pretty sure autocorrect changed “ik” to “I’m”.

Nice crafts tho.
---
As though I don't check profiles in the lobby.
---
The fact that it’s a Feng surprises me for some reason. I expected a Nea.
---
That would make sense if it was a killer who could disguise themselves as a survivor
---
michael isn't an m1 killer has has an insta down, and like, you're wrong bro

It takes a second to fcking like a video, you lazy cunt and what bitching? His career depends on people engaging with his content, stop getting hurt BY LITTLE THINGS
---
Lol. When they broke the hook and you dropped him your all like "ah shit, here we go again". You just dimolished them
---
I sometimes do this to hooks, but I never complain about being slugged after... that's just being a sore loser, slugging is the right thing to do in that situation.
---
The reason why I detest SWF
---
I mean i have like 30 yellow flashlights im on xbox i can give him one!
---
I like how almost every reply is a variation of "but are you sure they are SWF, are you sure they were toxic toxic?". Imagine a police officer going: "but are you sure he wanted to hurt you" to a rape victim ahahahahahah like it is difficult to tell apart Survivors with voice coms and without
---
SWF is a touchy topic to discuss on reddit my friend. just bring moris and kill their asses until they figure out how to prevent SWF cancer. you shall find no support here.
---
in what way? yes, you can give a thumbs-up to people already, but there is no reward or incentive or doing so, which is what OP is suggesting they add to increase positive interaction.
---
One thing that would make this idea better that you didn't mention is that you can only give a player one of these per week or something. Otherwise, it is exploitable. Other than that, I love this idea. It is often said to reward good behavior and the punishment is no reward. Obviously, bans/suspensions should be issued when someone violates the rules but this would only make the game better in my opinion and I hope a developer sees this.(O was the first letter in all of my sentences; really interesting /s)
---
Ok....? I dont get it...
---
Had the same thing happen to me on ps4, all I wanted to do was my daily quest but as soon as I see they was sabotaging hooks and teabagging at every pallet, I knew they was a SWF. After I killed them all they call me a try hard because I use noed and franklins, I didn’t know what going to happen. Anyways they continued to message me and being all toxic. The salt was real for them
---
I don't think a game should be depended on grinding, you can have fun while playing the game without the excessive grind, with the new killers coming oh lord new perks the grind is too much.
---
as they should
---
Those last 10 seconds of your clip reminds me of a situation I had
---
I once downed a 4 man SWF because they all came and tried to bodyblock me before I even got to hook 1 person. 
---
They called me toxic for not hooking them one at a time and reported me.
---
Please don't give someone this upset over a yellow flashlight a flashlight. And, for how good they are they got a single blind. While I was kicking a pallet.
---

Sad thing is I'm pretty sure Freddy is still shorter, should do a pixel-by-pixel look.
---
I actually don't like the Overwatch endorsement system that much. It feels less about commending good behavior as it does doing it for the sake of it for experience points. I wouldn't offer a reward to the upvoter for giving someone an upvote but just make it a clickable option next to the player's points, perks, add-ons etc.
---
I would love to think it was that but them teleporting to the exit gate then floating in the air nah it was cheating.  Only at the end they allowed me to hit them and one of their profiles had bans on their account already.  Smdh
---
Since when was T-bagging and being predictable as hell apart of the game?
---
Whoa. How do you get that? Looks damn good.
---
I agree fully. I'm not gonna pretend to be the king of dbd, but consistently rank 3 pig main aint bad, and I feel some people forget there is a person behind the blade. No one needs to be a dick, they are just trying to have fun too. There are toxic survivors and toxic killers and honestly if there were some kind of like player karma you could award post game, I feel it would address a lot of the problems
---
Nah, he's a bottom. He's just also very self-conscious about it.
---
It’s on the forum for upcoming cosmetics
---
Hello, 
---
Since today my Game just crashes randomly at certain times (happend 5 times already) not even giving me the option to send the error informations. Its not even a running process in my Task Manager but in Steam it still shows me as ingame in DbD
---
Whats up with that?
---
Ok...
---
I am yes. 
---
When I do this I get a screen ( [https://imgur.com/a/YqpLWR8](https://imgur.com/a/YqpLWR8) ) that is asking for a code. Where do I get that?
---
That is not lag switching. Killer throttling the internet (on purpose or not) still sucks but its different. 
---
Lag switching is when the connection is interrupted for a moment and restored before the game has time to kick survivors out.
---
Sorry, was too busy getting hypnotized by that booty.
---
"my friend"
---
Lol, this is why I stopped playing a long time ago.. swf is pure shit and should have removed ages ago.
---
thats over too quickly
---
there are better way to draw out  teabaggers misery
---
like make them teabag over a vat of acid over and over again
---
I think it might have ended? I’m sorry for the inconvenience
---
I dunno man, I feel like that could be abused pretty easy with swf. If they're all toxic they could all give the killer bad karma and there's not much the killer could do.
---
I think That's a little bit extreme. ey ?
---
( I totally understand that you were angry and in the heat of the moment everyone says things they don't mean)
---
I hope they’re ALL obtainable with shards
---
His wife isnt doing a very good job so far ):
---
Quick correction afaik it doesn’t feed on the emotions of others but strictly on Hope
---
No worries. Thanks for the help
---
Go for it! Just let me know you’re a reddit person lol.
---
i dont understand how this is getting praised? Its cringey. Looks like a neon wanna-be mute from rainbow six siege
---
This is peak survivor main. Only a survivor main would unironically string all these thoughts together and press submit.
---
what about all the perks survivors get? imagine 8 stacks of aces perks
---
I think that’s what makes it stand out in my opinion, I will admit it does look like Mute, but I just think any new cosmetics are cool in general
---
If I know they have Dead Hard, I just swing two seconds later. I don’t see how that’s such a big deal, lol
---
And shame on all those killers that pick up the last survivors from the bear trap and walk them over to the hatch!
---
Yes, you can also tell when the killer dc's and when you randomly dc. If the killer dc's there are gonna be 4 survivor running at the end. If only you randomly dc, you can only see you and other people who have already left the game.  
---
This happens maybe once every 3-4 games. It's fucking annoying as fuck
---
It's great because part of the reason the Nea got caught was because she BMed, litteraly proving my point.
---
seriously fuck dedicated servers, they dont even make the game play better, its only getting implemented because of a whining fanbase that doesnt know what they're talking about
---
Yeah my friend
---
That was hot
---
Another thing to add, you can fall the realm of The Entity: The Fog according to the Devs if I remember correctly.
---
Can we not promote camping?  Also if he wants to win his game and actually rank up camping will prevent that.  You're providing a recipe for a safety or depip.  Also just a super weak approach to the game in general.
---
"so then you run around a pile of garbage for a while until the killer gets too close and you throw down this piece of wood and then you move on to the next pile of garbage you run around for a while until the killer gets too close and you throw that one down, too. Eventually you get knocked down and this is when you rage quit causing your teammates to also lose"
---
"this is fun? why?
---
"to t-bag freddy krueger omegalul"
---
"tea bag?"
---
Ok, but the nurse on high ranks (until mettle of man works)
---
Just another aura reading perk
---
Oh right yeah I forgot that was there, nah I hate it and I’ve never used it, it’s just iconic so I decided to add it
---
I’ll make a no mither one specifically for you lmao
---
Interesting analogy but alright thanks I guess?
---
Yep you got me, I should probably change that but I can’t really be arsed.
---
If you face a toxic swf team, camping works great. That's all i'm saying. I don't promote camping in general, but toxicity is defeated with more toxicity in this game.

I've never understood the hate against slugging. It's a valid playstyle just like any other with it's pros and cons.
---
I don’t have a legion outfit yet lol, I didn’t play them much tho and I was gonna start when this outfit came out , and I’m looking forward to the new legion tbh
---
A sickening twist.
---
you did nothing wrong
---
I’m what? Did you not read the rest of it? It’s not just about aura reading. That’s just a portion of what it can do. The aura is to give the survivors incentive to cleanse totems (as if they don’t already have that incentive) yet gives a sense of danger because the killer can now see everyone else. This part of the perk is merely a addition to it. The main points of the perk are to protect other totems much like Hex ruin. Totems in this game are extremely weak and a hex like the one I’ve created gives other totems a chance to survive longer than 30 seconds a game. At the same time, making this a perk makes it so that the killer has to take it and fill up a perk slot, and forcing them to take another hex to really use the ability that it was thought up for. This makes it so the ability is balanced.
---
You saying it’s just another aura reading perk makes me feel like you don’t give perks much thought, so to me, your opinion is no longer valid. Thanks for sharing anyway though
---
The only thing embarrassing is this thread.
---
I, too, love NOED.
---
Great stuff. How’d you make em’?
---
It's fine, its stops people from dc'ing and unless you're playing a garbage killer or are not good you'll 4k just fine.
---
Once again, that’s a useless thing if it’s you just taking a hit for someone the killer is carrying. And yeah you do get that from Bond and Empathy, but this doesn’t trigger nearly as often as you think and would require your allies to really be paying attention in the moments you get hit or do a save.
---
OP did nothing wrong
---
Just find the totem and cleanse it, most of the time killers will be too busy patrolling hooked and gates
---
Gardian with the buzzsaw , brutal.
---
Probably because you suggested that TOTH becomes not a totem.
---
Autism is spreading more and more by the day
---
Personally, the dbd community is too sensitive to emotes and taunting. I do find it honestly weird when killers brag about downing a survivor for being “toxic” (which has been used to ground that it lost all meaning at this point) when the game is literally designed for killers to be objectively better than survivors.
---
“He isn’t very alert”
---
He should play Feng more
---
Wow that guy 99% saboed one hook, what an absolutely disgusting act indeed.
---
Also this isn't even a toxic swf this is just a shitty one lol
---
Yea its a tough balance. I've seen some people say it should be just a one way street. Like positive karma builds as people like upvote the killer postgame, but it diminishes very slowly over time
---
Not a business man so couldn't think of it. Allright then increasing killer's gains seems like the best idea here.
---
dafuq did I just read.
---
People say that NOED is a crutch perk, but don't think it has to be. There are builds you can do that make use of it's strengths as a core part of a strategy, instead of just being a safety net for when you get to late game and still have everyone up.
---
Personally, I would prefer to have Dewey. He’d become my survivor main
---
Isn’t he better than ever?
---
&gt; Less Killer Mains who actually stream
---
because there is no demand at all
---
&gt; No one wants to see someone get looped for 10 minutes
---
but watching someone otherwise just hold down a button is so fun?
---
&gt; Better overall view of the things around you  
---
but lots of first person games do just fine with stream viewers. this one is a big stretch
---
edit: thnks 4 gld zD
---
Thanks!
---
1500!?!
---
The games shit. Don’t care about ‘counter play’ etc. 
---
Instakills ruined it on launch
---
I was contemplating making it remove blood pools for a few seconds after getting hit as well.
---
As a killer main, seeing this is basically porn
---
Did nothing wrong, no hook near and he was almost out of your grasp, makes sense to slug
---
8 survivors, 2 killers, .. 2 doors 😏
---
It is
---
I see what you mean. Would separate queues for casual and ranked play be better? Like most multiplayer games do it? Your rank isnt affected but you still earn BP and EXP but not as much as you would in ranked play? So casual games can be more relaxed and everyone doesn't have to worry about pipping. And so people who want to play with friends for fun won't be punished as harshly by camping,tunneling killers etc.
---
Ranked play can reward more BP,EXP, and enable pipping and de-pipping. Everyone would at least try to play better as they should in a competitive queue.
---
How would you balance solo play to a similar level of SWF? I am asking out of genuine curiosity, I've been playing casually for a few months and have only recently really gotten into the nitty-gritty of trying to understand the balance of the game.
---
Yeah, I love it when Sabo squads complain about getting slugged. What do you expect if you're breaking every hook I could have used? Of course you're going to be crawling around waiting to die.
---
Agreed- this is my friend group lol. We have good games and bad games, try-hardy and meme-y games haha.
---
I agree that those perks are in good spots right now, DS especially. I was thinking of the old DS when I wrote it. I play both sides, so my only point was don't be toxic when you have so many options to make up for mistakes.
---
I mean, you are using an insta saw
---
Yeah, although hit detection going over obstacles is still bs
---
big daddy finger u/JohnnyZer0
---
I just love how things that are present in the game for survivors to use and play with are just considered toxic by the vocal killer community, makes for a fun time when you pull off a flashlight save or sabo a hook and you are instantly considered a toxic player
---
make screen brighter pls
---
Congrats
---
It doesn't remove their outside game communication.
---
Disconnect because you dont like the killet
---
What if the incentive to give props was that you’d only be able to receive prop rewards if you were actively giving props in a certain percentage of your session matches?
---
Stealth available does sound like a predator tbh. They literally just go place to place and kill people.
---
It's a mix of good and bad.  The graphics aren't as good anymore to appease all the nvidia video cards that can't handle the glorious master race Forward+ rendering.  They kept wanting BeTtEr OpTiMiZaTiOn.  A few very vocal people still bitch about strafing being uNfAiR.  Another group of vocal minority constantly complain about there not being an FoV slider and make up shit about motion sickness but refuse to take OTC AntiVert.  The new map is good, especially on the night/fog variants.  The new Immolator monster is great fun.  He explodes, ignites people, and runs fast.  He also opens doors.  He's the new Hellhound.  Hellhounds dodge melee attacks now since they got too easy.  There are new weapons and a better mix of bullet types for sidearms and rifles.
---
I've always queued as a solo Hunter and I don't use Discord so none of that drama affects me.
---
If it didn't make a sound, it was because he was taking advantage of the fact you can pull your cord and reconnect it to keep items and BP.
---
They made the walls unable to be seen through. This made the maps really hard for killers so this makes it more fair.
---
I do like his videos. In fact I hit the like on almost all videos any steamer makes. Its annoying to hear please hit that like button all the sudden at the beginning of every one of his videos.  It turned for ok, sure to if you don't I won't upload.  Be patient and casual not try to shame fans.  Fucking lame.
---
I mean...
---
Uhh why don’t you take this thread to a different sub...I’ll leave this here r/dbdgonewild
---
every survivor's true nightmare
---
This is what I expect to happen every time I'm in a lobby and my survivor teammates say "lets all bring toolboxes for SABO" and I know they probably won't take anti-slugging perks.
---
Love to play swf, but when we do so, we either completely suck ass, or do actually pretty good.
---
But we never play in a toxic way, there's just no point in doing so.
---
S- It’s nurse...just nurse 
---
A- Great, will mostly get 4 sacrifices in a game 
---
B- Will usually get 3-4 sacrifices but may have a slip up 
---
C- Will usually get 2-3 sacrifices but at a challenge 
---
D- dreadful, no fun at all, not good
---
Okay, instead of just disregarding an idea to increase positive gameplay in a game that doesn’t have a whole lot of it, what would be your insight on how to handle the state in which dbd is currently in? It’s very easy to put down others ideas but not as easy to give constructive criticism that could help the problem
---
Ok edgelord
---
yup was a public game. Why would I be banned?
---
tbh, i really like Open-Handed and Boil Over ideas, dunno what to say about the other perks
---
Maybe they teabagged as in to acknowledge themselves being hit through the pallet?
---
Sassy clearly didn't read... 
---
Interesting thought though. I'd use it. Would potentially even have up to 6 totems in a trial at once. That'd be neat. 
---
But how would this work with Haunted Grounds, if even?
---
So they didnt want you to hook. So you slugged instead. They didnt want that either? You were supposed to stand in the corner and let them escape.
---
😂
---
r/lightmodepatrol Stop right there criminal scum
---
Read the full title, watch the dcs as soon as people get downed. Thats toxicity .
---
Yeah usually that’s why there’s two modes quick play or competitive but don’t expect that anytime soon

---
I love the perk quotes.
---
Here comes the crapper, you better step into his crap
---
The entirety makes the killers stronger. It’s why killers like Frank and Amanda are able to not just get decked by David and that’s the end of it
---
I think it depends on the killer, let's say a killer with really good map pressure like Nurse.
---
Doesn't matter if you are all spread out on a gen if she's using B&amp;C once she hooks that first person, the train ride never ends.
---
But like I said depending on which killer you are playing, map pressure type killers are the go to, I wish the others would have a fighting chance.
---
I use bamboozle, brutal strength, fired up and blood warden.
---
I don't understand how bubba is higher than the clown and the doctor. 
---
Could please explain how why.
---
except survivors were super overpowered when the game released, not every nerf and buff is an equal +1 and -1, and survivor mains DO buy dlc.
---
This happens to me every time I'm in the cornfield and it feels like I'm the one being chased.
---
I like the "chaser build" for Wraith since he is a basic M1 character.
---
Bamboozle, Enduring and Spirit Fury. 
---
The 4th perk you can use whatever. I chose Brutal Strength but this perk isn't great so you can use literally anything in its place.
---
Ruin is almost always a must for me for any killer. I also like Play with your Food, that little percentage boost in speed can come in handy. I like his addons that decrease the time to reappear.
---
...Too much gore for DBD? It seems you haven't seen what the Hag does to her victims in their final moments.
---
Punishing people playing Killer and/or solo Survivors isn't any better of a model. I'd also estimate over half of the "friends" are just random people who met in Discord and likely won't ever speak again. The effectiveness of SWF has caused it to saturate the game, so it needs to be decentivized somehow and/or incentivizes players not using it.
---
In short, SWF isn't fun to play with, but you're forced to play with them. It's the grade school equivalent of your mom forcing you to play with the weird kid no one likes.
---
You're
---
I feel attacked on the last one.
---
We do what we wanna!
---
I agree mostly but a few i dont. 
---
Leatherface is too high, Freddy is way too high, Pig, Wraith and doc should be equal wherever you are putting them. Id probably swap huntress and myers too
---
The way the game rewards aggression on both sides this kind of thing is just going to keep happening.  For example; I'll often find myself being accused of camping hooks when playing killer due to how quickly other survivors will attempt to unhook.  I haven't even had a chance to damage the nearby gen yet, let alone leave the area, and they are running up to the hooked survivor.
---
This is secretly a form of research to try and figure out what goes through their heads.
---
Why charge up a shock or a bottle when I can rev a chainsaw for a one hit charge 🙂
---
I think the thing people don't realize is that more often than not, people disconnect in a manner that preserves your accrued BP for that match and keeps any items you have. You don't get the 5000 for escaping but you definitely get more than 0.
---
Now, everyone else in the match sees you at 0 BP. That doesn't matter. The client of the person who d/c'd will still register and apply the BP as normal. It acts as if the killer left the game.
---
Generally, if the person stops moving for a little bit of time before the d/c, they're probably going to keep their BP. If the they only stop moving long enough to hit the "Leave Match" button, they're probably getting bumpkis.
---
If they leave AND they're in the post game chat, then they definitely got nothing from that match.
---
&gt;when the game is literally designed for killers to be objectively better than survivors.
---
BHVR for the past 3 years: There's where you're wrong kiddo
---
Seriously though, if you know what you are doing and you are in a discord call (which is basically all aura reading perks in one) killers are signifigantly at a disadvantage. Bloodlust doesnt actually help a whole lot and there are still MANY places a survivor can waste a killers time. Its not a bad thing and its a valid strat but when a survivor taunts the killer its while using these infinite its kinda like stealing candy from a little child and eating it infront of them. 
---
I encourage taunting in open fields because all it does is slow them down but when you taunt in a place where the killer cant catch you without a speedboost from dragging the chase out for 30 seconds (actually a lot of time in dbd match standards) its just annoying and undeserved. 
---
I bragged here because I knocked down a survivor who was at the exit gates, which is subjectively the safest place to be, to which he was taunting me with his flashlight which is basically a way of saying "fuck you, you cant get me" in fact in post game chat the survivor called me names that would get me banned on most areas of the internet and probably sued (which i let go and didnt report because at the end of the day I won, he lost and he has to live with that).
---
TL;DR: we get mad because when you are in a loop there is nothing we can do for a while which wastes our time significantly...which is why survivors run to it. If everyone just runs to the infinite areas its essentially telling us to stand in the corner for a few minutes. To top this off if you point out of undeserved cockiness then tell us not to get mad its almost as stupid as telling the shy bullied kid not to stand up for himself and not to take it personally.
---
When you’re ambushing you’re pretty easy to see, her traps aren’t the best and yes they slow the game down but not too much, she’s also boring as shit in my opinion, I hope she gets buffed
---
This is accurate. I was playing killer last night with groups and it was pretty harsh out there for killers. People only getting one or two hooks then everyone leaving. It was atrocious.
---
Competent devs, for starters.
---
If you charge your chainsaw at a pallet you can either run through them risk getting stunted or wait and risk the survivor not dropping the pallet.
---
yeah that too, at least in my experience i see way more players (survivor and killer mains alike) with more survivor cosmetics than killer cosmetics. i personally play mostly killer but still have way more survivor cosmetics just because i think they look better.
---
I hate this glitch. It makes my survivor first person and as the killer I see that crap too and I cant see survivors to play the match.
---
woulda been funny if the noed was the green tier, or enduring was yellow or brown tier
---
they already know about it and are banning people for it
---
I can see Ace being one of the entity's favorites, he seems to roam around without a care in the world, always with that smile on his face. If ace doesn't have hope, I wouldn't know who does
---
I've have dreams like this about the f13 game. Jason was trying to kill me and I was running for my life and he was talking shit the hole time about me.
---
Yeah I made it while I was still upset about it, and the post was mostly in bad taste but I don’t feel like it’s necessary to pull it down at this point
---
I will not argue against the fact that the decisions for the game have not been good for it haha
---
I can agree I find it very difficult too which is why I use them usually after we reach a loop.
---
Stop helping the opponent!
---
This lovely fellow has some adorable custom portraits including the newest characters  https://twitter.com/WholeyeetRye/status/1111109849214058496
---
I was banned for a week for doing this on ranked matches. I only did it like 2 or 3 times with a friend to see how weird/fun this would turn out, we didn't even try to kill anybody and were just fooling around.
---
Yey, I still got soft banned for this, so be careful and don't attempt to reproduce this glitch. If you weren't the one trying to perform the glitch than I think you should be fine.
---
But Im not sure since BHVR rather ban people over this kind of shit rather than fix game-breaking bugs on their game...
---
Honestly I wasnt even that angry, this is basically the killer equivalent of a 360 no scope. After 3 years you kinda learn to just accept it but when you do catch a cocky somofabitch its satisfying and when its so close to the exits its basically a trickshot so yeah i went a little nuts lmao
---
I didnt know that. Good to know. But the "what" was directed at the title being uninteligable. I feel like i should have commented r/ihadastroke bu the moment has passed.
---
Thank you for understanding. I made the post still upset about it and it is just a game so y’know. It doesn’t really matter I just hate to see so many people complain about how trash survivors are but when you call out a bad killer suddenly it’s just whining.
---
Crouch during sneaky times, run during chases or time sensitive moments, walk all other times. You want to keep your position safe as much as possible. Knowing what speed to move at makes a big difference
---
Every time they use a purple mist offering :’(
---
A Big Daddy mori would be so good!
---
What's wrong with t bagging? Honest question here... It can be a pretty useful strategy especially against the easily butthurt bitches... Which seems to be a lot of people here. So let's say my team is trash at kiting the killer and I can loop for hours, I'm gonna tbag and point and wave and whatever so they can focus on the objective while the butthurt bitch is mad over emotes and actions in a video game. It isn't my fault you're bad and let emotable actions in a game hurt your fee fees so much. It's especially funny when the killer gets tbagged for being a huge piece of shit. You facecamp the first dude of the match on his first hook, I'm gonna tbag the shit out of you at the gate until I'm forced to leave.
---
As a survivor to another survivor it's a friendly hello or a thanks for the heal or save. 
---
Ready for the downvotes. Bring them on because you're so easily offended by everything in life instead of having a conversation.
---
They added a social ranking system for players in the last year where people can tank your social score by reporting you after a match. I once lost an entire level after a few competitive elimination matches where I dominated the other team.
---
Phobias are a flimsy excuse in horror games anyway considering the point of the horror genre, clowns are just common enough to say anything about.

Oh ok I understand. not gonna lie it was pretty     
---
sick .
---
Best of luck to ya.
---
“Game mechanics” alright. I was more ‘throwing a fit’ over the fact that she messaged me acting like it was a good kill when it was cheap? The rest of the post was just context. Learn to read buddy.
---
I personally don’t think t bagging is the issue. That has no outcome on the other players besides easily offended killers. It’s more of sandbagging, face camping, and rage quitting that I personally feel are ruining the game (for me). Devs have tried to implement systems to punish face camping and sandbagging with the safe/unsafe unhook and the lack of points from face camping if survivors don’t feed into it, but that hasn’t worked. And don’t even get me started on the lack of care about addressing rage quitting. There has to be an effective way at stopping this negative behavior, and it could be giving large rewards to people who DONT do this stuff. The reason stuff like this hasn’t worked for other games, such as Overwatch, is because after so many hours, you stop caring about loot boxes. If blood points were rewarded for positive behavior, I think it is safe to say that a large majority of players will always seek the reward. 
---
As someone who used to play this game multiple days a week to someone who doesn’t even watch streamers much anymore, it’s just frustrating to see a good game get worse.
---
Because someone has specifically made the concerted effort to ensure that you can't do anything and have no fun.
---
Of course! The Nurse also takes FOREVER to climb those obstacles. Bamboozle is a *must*.
---
&gt; walk all other times
---
Please don't. This is the biggest mistake baby survivors commit. 
---
If you can see that the killer is actively chasing someone, just run without being afraid.
---
Nurse players who use her blink are not playing her properly
---
There was no reason for the killer to message me after the fact to gloat. If it had just been a cheap match it would have been over with. She decided to gloat about it and it annoyed me. 
---
The post was made while I was still upset but at this point I just wanna read the comments from killer mains.
---
Survivors get 2 perks each as well. This isn’t a change made specifically for killers
---
Well said
---
lol nice going!
---
If a key point of this argument is “it’s inconvenient for the survivors” just stop posting. Holy shit
---
Petition for oink sound effect when pig falls from a ledge
---
Hopefully you won't get a soft ban. But considering how terrible they are at handling these, you never know for sure.
---
My 1st (and only one, besides this recent soft ban) soft ban was simply from playing killer when I still had a bad internet connection (ADSL with less than 1mb upload speed). 
---
One survivor got mad because he thought I was lagswitching on purpose and probably reported me with video "evidence". Got a 2 days ban from that. I've since upgraded to fiber and now I can play on both sides without issue.
---
Like I've said, these devs/game mods will ban people over the most petty things (specially killers) rather than take a step back, look at their game and adress the many issues the game currently have.
---
well yes but actually no
---
It seems point less on both ends them messaging you and you posting this.
---
Kinda amazed they havnt changed trapper to start the game with all his traps, then he has to go get them after he's sets them up.
---
Yeah, we make mistakes sometimes.
---
Enduring, spirit fury, bbq, sloppy butcher/bamboozle
---
1) Make sure you’re running good perks :p I’d definitely recommend an exhaustion perk, just in case you don’t use one already
---
2) Watch some of the top players. Find some YouTubers and/or streamers you like and watch some survivor gameplay. This will familiarise you with pallet, gen, etc. locations and what some good loops are
---
3) Practice! Especially if you’re at a lower rank where you can afford to do so, try to get the killer’s attention and take on some chases. You can’t get better at looping if you don’t ever do it!
---
Inferior character main results in an inferior upvote count.
---
Definitely the latter. If you're going sabo squad without No Mither, this is what's going to happen. Stupid survivors think "I don't want to be one hit while doing sabo squad!" when the whole point of sabo squad is no one will ever get hooked, so it doesn't matter how much health anyone has.
---
If you're playing on the PTB the patch notes say that the Devout emblem is currently broken.
---
If you're not on the PTB then you're out of luck because the main build of the game isn't much better... pipping as killer right now is honestly a joke.
---
I’m gonna be honest, the legion changes are hardly a nerf. If anything, it’s mostly a buff. It raises his skill and outplay ceiling tremendously due to having 115.
---
yay! You've just saved me weeks upon weeks of frustration. I downloaded gimp a few weeks ago and I can't figure out how to use the damn program. I've had photoshop several different times in the past and I was never able to figure out how to use anything there either. Youtube tutorials are pretty ass at helping too since they explain everything at lightning speed like bro slow the fuck down for us old people lol.
---
JS, there is an official dbd discord
---
OMG! I didn't know that. They look very nice, I didn't like the standard dbd icons so I used your background with the coloured icons of happy clown and I just couldn't resist to share it! What do you think of this combination?
---
Wait how early?
---
Shit time to get my Ash and Jane to P3.
---
Ruvik would just be Nurse tbh
---
Because... finishing generators means they use discord?
---
The speed boost is practically the same. 150% movement speed for 3 seconds I believe when hit. Might be a second less or so but its definitely 150% extra movement speed.
---
A perk that gives you the Exhausted status effect when you use it. I’d recommend running Sprint Burst, Lithe, or Balanced Landing, though I know some people use Dead Hard. All of them are designed to help you get away from the killer in chases. Everybody likes a different one, so just mess around with them and see which you like best
---
With new update farm maps will be better. Now we are only left with Haddonfield and Lerry's to deal with.
---
“Pretty good perk” 
---
*very rare add-on* hmmmm
---
I would honestly stop playing if boil over, buckle up, or slippery meat were updated like that. Call me a salty killer main if you wish, but with the already huge swath of "second" chances, ways of escape, and speed boosts, it would be just too obnoxious to play.
---
They just played badly there. Sabo and slugging aren't toxic though.

Are you defending camping?
---
If the killer is chasing another survivor chances are your already on a gen and wouldn't need to go anywhere until the killer comes to you, the only reason you'd leave that gen and go somewhere else is if there is someone on a hook while another person is being chased

Your brain has a bias where you will care more about losing something than gaining something

What are you going to tell the killer how to do his job?
---
Are survivorino embarrassed using DS/MoM/Deliverance/Adrenaline/SWF crutches?
---
They must be hypocrites...
---
Your problem is mostly the chaser and devout. You need to make sure you get 10 hooks, and that you always go for as many chases and hits as you can
---
I'd rather see the devs do their jobs and fix the weakest killers.
---
Columbia. That would be cool too, except the fact that it's oppressively bright wouldn't make it ideal for DBD. Unless they did a night map.

Columbia

I agree, they're pretty boring but tbh I'd much rather have them than have something like Ormond. I don't DC but that map makes me really want to

Whata good about this game. Ive tried watching streams and videos of it and it just seems soooo boring. Unless youre fooling around with a friend.

As survivor as well I’ve gotten stuck on trees twice in the last couple days. Idk why it’s suddenly happening I’ve never had any trouble before.
---
I'm pretty sure it was made to look as close to The Miner as possible while still retaining the fact that it was The Trapper.
---
Billy looks nothing like Leatherface though.
---
The DCing is just disgusting. they outplayed you by saboing the hook, you outplayed them by slugging. this is just gross.
---
Thanks I appreciate it. For haunted grounds it would work the same with this hex as any other totem. So once haunted grounds’ totem is cleansed, the exposed effect activates. As you know, the other haunted grounds totem becomes dull. So as soon as the haunted grounds totem is cleansed and the exposed status begins, hex: elemental disguise kicks in a moves the haunted grounds totem to its new location. Basically, if the survivors find haunted grounds twice, they have to make a very game changing decision. 
---
I wanted this perk to be like a “should I or should I not cleanse this totem”. It would make totems WAY stronger imo. But let me know what you think
---
I never really tried prove thyself until I started leveling up Dwight and used it, and my god it's really good. Bond is indeed pretty high tier but I don't see people using or talking about alert. Alert is really good for locating the killer consistently throughout the match and can help you in chases when LOS is broken. Currently using it with Feng and I love it
---
JESUS CHRIST, YES
---
The pig will still have its use just end-game builds will be lost from the pig. The power to delay survivors still exits throughout the game though it would be nice to see add-ons being altered &amp; an analysis of the box situation for Pig.
---
Since the live versions usually come out around a couple of weeks from the PTB, it's likely to be out around the 4th to 7th May. Since the Bloodhunt starts on the 4th May I would not be surprised if that's when the devs want to release the latest patch.

Kind of just want to brush the bangs away from the face

EAC is the anti cheat engine which DBD uses, if people discover a bypass for it it allows them to modify their game to their heart's content. If it isn't that though and people are lagging consistently in your lobbies it's your Internet, since you're the host.
---
Lery's and The Game would disagree.
---
I don't understand 3d models. I know survivor's faces are designed to move and be expressive, but are killers? Is freddy's model designed to be expressive like this or did it require extra editing?
---
I THOUGHT THIS EXACT THING LMAOO
---
Juicy fuckin karma right there I tell you what
---
Freshhhhhhhh
---
You mean the commendation system? There is no negative option for it. It's things like shot caller and good teammate.
---
The ranking does decay, depending on what level it is. At rank 4 you drop down to 3 after a few matches. At rank 5 you basically need a command from everyone every match.
---
How about bonus blood points for how fast you get out of the match when the exits are powered.
---
finally, now killers can now mindgame instead of running around like bots
---
Agreed, please never use this color combination ever again OP
---
Now I really want a toxic waste dump map.
---
Fair point, but I’m talking the mechanics of the game and not maps. Maps are an entirely separate balancing issue.
---
Let me guess, you just experienced this?
---
Decent idea. 
---
Also if they gave a BP % boost to consecutive games played without DCing (also similar to OW) I think that would be a nice addition as well. But I guess that would may only be able to be done on dedicated servers since someone elses connection may be too unreliable.
---
Bamboozle is a must no matter the build to me
---
Yeah exactly I was called a camper because every single time they would run straight to the hook so I decided eventually I would just walk a bit away and go back and it worked so why wouldn’t I keep doing it? They literally set me up to “camp” even though I continually tried to leave to be fair, but when they keep rushing back why tf wouldn’t I catch on and kill them?
---
Normally I'd agree, but OP's post shows a damn good example of toxic behaviour. T-bagging, instant D/Cs when things go wrong etc.
---
It depends on the killer. Those whose faces you can see (except Wraith) all have face controls that even work in-game. Clown and Spirit are great examples. Hillbilly, Freddy, and Doctor also have expressions, albeit less noticeable.
---
I've had the game for about a month and this is really how my killer experience has been lol
---
uncrouching means you tip off the survs. and then you cant use the dash speed boost which helps if they have sprint burst or a pallet nearby. the idea for the 'voice distorter' is that it allows you a sneak attack without warning in a way similar to wraiths 'no terror/red stain' add on. 
---
as for 'no.3', a dev commented on this saying that it is in fact randomly placed in a box. the rumor thats its not random is from a reddit user who supposedly did some testing themself and found it not to be random. dev says its fabricated data, so its def possible that reddit user did a whole lot of legwork just to farm karma.
---
that 30min link though... rip
---
The excitement and joy they must of felt as they body block, break hook and throw in a cheeky T-bag.   
---
The despair when Billy pauses and drops the downed survivor "shits on now"
---
Frank looks weirdly happy
---
I mean, I get that it’s annoying and no fun to play against, but it’s still considered a viable “tactic” as Leatherface. His power is just literally made for camping.
---
That’s why I run Kindred a lot. As long as people KNOW you’re being camped, you could probably pop at least 3 Gens before you died.
---
Almost a little... *charming?*
---
Definitely not at all. He’s a better m1 killer...but that’s so boring. They ruined his power so now he’s a poor mans wraith. His add on changes are actually good I’ll admit that. But now deep wound is USELESS and I can’t stress that enough.
---
They will still say it. Only people have maimed freddy have love for him. I've doubled piped with him more times than I can count.
---
Lol please no. I love Ruvik but he just oneshot you with one poke on your face UwU
---
Nurse aswell! Also i think its a decent map.
---
Your changes still give him the option to tunnel and repeatedly frenzy stab a single person with no counter play. Your proposed buff of replenishing his power meter after stabbing someone that's already wounded only encourages it.
---
2nd of may until the 6th of may
---
Everyone: "Nerf Legion"  
---
DBD Devs: Nerfs Pig  
---
Picture: "you weren't supposed to do that."  
---
that's what it needs to look like to actually be funny.
---
An interesting concept for sure! The perks seem pretty balanced, too, as a survivor main.
---
I made a concept that was the exact opposite of this a little less than a month ago -- a survivor that suppresses the auras of others at the cost of revealing his own -- but I never considered the flipside! A great read!
---
Unfortunately, I've never read the book, or any movie adaptation if there is one, but my Uncle told me about it and some of the fucked up things the man in the yellow suit would do.
---
I get that, i play 50/50 so i'm no survivor main. If someone has a flashlight spam macro they're getting out of my game real fast.
---
 
---
Picture: "you weren't supposed to do that."
---
that's what could look like to be better.
---
NOED's like a guilty pleasure. It just *gives* you free sacrifices.
---
Lol they are fucking trash. Can’t even dodge a chainsaw. Toxic garbage
---
You forgot NOED. 
---
Not even being salty. Face camping and NOED are like pb&amp;j
---
That's the Hi Vis Legion's Crows cosmetic.
---
I think this would also be really interesting if it took place inside Evan Macmillan’s (trapper) mines where he caused an explosion of that led to the entity taking interest in him. Just a neat way of linking two killers, I think
---
It's obviously going to be The Bee.
---
Kindred is an excellent counter for this. I hand't thought of that.
---
It doesnt matter if you camp. I think this refers to irrational salty survivors who will claim you camped and tunneled when they lose. Whether you did it or not.
---
You completely overlooked the fact that being reported lowers your commendation rank.
---
It’s not about fixing everyone but most people don’t have all perks on all killers/survivors and a large amount of adding/items. There is a point in every game where the rewards for playing are meaningless. It doesn’t need to change the mindset of every player to work
---
Legion not being able to search lockers while in frenzy was horrible and what you're suggesting is actually so bad. An eight second stun. Just think about it. 
---
As someone who pretty much only plays Legion (and Freddy) I'm starting to be at peace with the changes in the PTB. Sure there are things I'd change, but I think this is a good starting point for potential upcoming buffs.

&gt; slamming down a pallet, pointing, and then waiting for me to break the pallet to start running is just a dickhead thing to do
---
If it's a safe pallet i will wait there to see if you break it amd i do point at people to bring some humour into it :) It's just a game after all.
---
This is a very basic concept that is use a lot in parenting. Rewarding positive behaviors in the child over punishing negative!
---
Okie dokie but I'm not on much
---
you got noed so your opinion dont matter
---
Don’t
---
True, but honestly can't resist picking up a trap that is so far so I think to myself "might as well pick it up now"
---
Oof sorry your right time to delete my post
---
This has absolutely no relevance to my point and shows your lack of understanding of how people who create content for youtube make a career out of it. The fact is he is doing it as a job and to make it viable you need views and likes if he doesn't have them he would have to go work a 'normal' job, probably then wouldn't have time to play multiple games to get recordings, edit them and then upload everyday for the people who are fans. My point was him offering that incentive showed that their are a lot of people who watch but don't bother to support him in that way which he needs so yes he has to ask for them and so what if he does every youtube channel of notable size says 'hit like and subscribe' its part of the business.  
---
Funny how your making out like being a youtuber is nothing yet whining about him mentioning likes for 20 seconds at the start of his video, either don't watch or just skip in.
---
Well thank you! I always thought that a sort of, traitorous survivor would be cool
---
I disagree  I feel that people are more reward driven and will be more motivated to act a certain way if they are rewarded for it compared to being discouraged in acting a certain way due to punishments. 
---
What would motivate you more: “I’ll give you $100 to be nice to me” or “I’ll slap you if you’re mean”
---
And that's why i use "ebony mori 5 blink nurse" sometimes XD
---
It’s like they had the idea but only went halfway with it!
---
I would not say that people used it for XP since it only gives you like what, 25? But I do get what you mean
---
Yeah, I’m guessing it’s too hard to distinguish between rage quit and an actual disconnect
---
This is brilliant
---
The answer to toxicity is custom servers/lobbies. Everyone joins and is glad to fill the lobby, then we vote on who plays killer. 
---
It would all be like kill your friends, but without having to be friend invite only. 
---
If I remember correctly, the toxicity of old games like Warcraft 2 and quake was lower, because everyone joined a lobby together. The jerks would get kicked from servers, and everyone had a good time. 
---
If we didn't choose killer or survivor, and instead picked the kind of server we wanted, we would then agree who would play killer, and then there would be no reason to belittle killers or be toxic to survivors if they are your acquaintances. Like "ok, if you thought I was a baby killer, let's see you do better, Brad."
---
It could also be nice to have smaller servers where we have ruin as base, or no Noed or something. Even empty maps that are killer sided, but it's on the players to decide to choose that server.
---
The floor is ACID.
---
I was more mentioning how it works so other people could see some info about it.
---
Yes reporting lowers it, but only after a warning/action.
---
Damn right she should be rewarded if she saved her traps. No killer should have their power taken away from them to suit some end game. Nothing comes easy for killers. Killers earn their damn chases.
---
Like the hag?
---
Yes, also if you mess with the config file... cant find surv with normal light i guess...
---
I'd think noed, haunted grounds, ruin, and enduring/brutal strength would be a good combo
---
The colors in this are messing with my eyes.
---
Camping is good. As a killer you shouldn't respect anyone, if the survivors don't I don't.
---
The best thing is that they are all horrible. The jans could easily dodge you but she just run straight lol
---
So kind of a reach, but Oman could be referring to the "O Face" Ghostface is making.
---
I’ve been using it more since they updated the Killer Aura detection to *16m*, it helps even with Killers Proximity-Camping or standing just off in the corner.
---
I have college, I fucking can't ugh.
---
Its not my internet dude simple as that theres literally no chance and yes bypassing EAC allows them to edit the game how they feel, hack bloodpoints, free DLC's, ESP and so on, but not lag, lag like that would either be them lag switching which has no value to them at all or they are just lagging in general but they were not laggin in the lobbies.
---
DONT SAY IT DONT THINK IT DONT SAY IT DONT THINK IT

#THE N WORD
---
"Break my hooks, die on the floor" this isn’t toxic, those survivors were "altruisticly" stupid and I play swf 70% of the time you have to wait til they’re recovered before rushing the heal🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Which is still a waste of a speed boost, regardless of the intent.
---
I can't believe no one knows it yet but, the new killer is obviously, 'The Bee'.
---
I want to blast toxic SWF imps with a super shotty.
---
Same here brother.
---
playing with friends is definitely the most enjoyable part for me but it's also fun grinding towards certain builds with teachable perks. I've also always been a fan of cat and mouse type games and online games that allow for stealth play so I get a thrill out of being chased and evading the killer, especially if everyone in the lobby is good and knows what their doing. I can definitely see why people get turned off of the game when they look up gameplay but once you figure things out and start understanding the meta it can be pretty fun.
---
I mean if the killer tunneled and camped you the entire time and you made less than 10k bloodpoints. Not really a loss.
---
So you are honestly saying that, in your experience, out of every 10 games you play you are getting more DC's due to bugs than you are due to rage quitting?
---
BHVR does have the data to tell the difference, and have since 2017 when that video was made, and they have done ban-waves as recently as the release of the Spirit. The only reason they have been holding back on instigating a Ban-Wave recently, isn't because they can't tell the difference between rage quitters vs. bugs, it's because they are waiting until they have the Dedicated servers up. They do have the power, right now, to exercise some disciplinary action, and the fact that they haven't for the past few months has had a devastating effect on the communities faith in the devs, as well as our overall enjoyment of the game.
---
They are indeed doing what they can to squash the bugs, and applying bandages where needed, but those won't be available until after the blood hunt event. In the meantime, we are left at the merciless whims of unsportsmanlike brats who are perfectly happy with ruining the game and using "bugs" as their scapegoat when we call them out on it.  
---
I'm not asking the devs for much... just for them to restore our faith in them and flex a little muscle this one time, before the blood hunt event, so that it can be an enjoyable for everyone, and not the disaster I'm predicting.
---
The floor is radioactive

Nea: tbags and waves confidently

SMH you were playing a bunch of potatoes who think themselves toxic

Toot of the week

Who would do that?

This is actually sad like wtf
---
First time in my life when i feel bad for a Wraith
---
The Legends say that the most toxic sub human entities emerge from this place
---
SWF: "Let me win!"
---
You: "No."
---
In all seriousness, you did the right thing, and they are just upset it didn't work out.
---
I'm so sorry man. Don't let those dickhead survs get in your nerves, just ignore them
---
Jane looks cute
---
Randy is completely #2.
---
A horror movie expert in a survival horror game?
---
We already have a cop (Tapp) and reporter (Jane).
---
&gt;So you are honestly saying that, in your experience, out of every 10 games you play you are getting more DC's due to bugs than you are due to rage quitting?
---
No. Read what I said carefully. I'm saying that your assumption that bugs causing less than 4 people entering a game is "1 out of 10" is not correct, that it's definitely more than that. I said absolutely nothing about people who DC, but I guess because you made that false assumption, you felt the need to downvote. Whatever.   
---
BTW, if you get infinite loading screen, someone HAS to DC. That was confirmed by BHVR, as the issue is caused where one survivor is unable to make a solid connection. Until that survivor DC's, the whole team will be stuck on that screen. [If you don't believe me, you can read about it on the official Developer Update, right underneath "Game Health Issues".](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019) Right under that, you can read about the other causes for less than 5 players to load into a game.   
---
In short, it's happening more than 1 out of 10.
---
Hi-Rez also made it work in Smite. Can only commend a person once per daily reset.
---
RIP Scru Frumbuhind
---
Now I want a 3D reality show with the killers. Someone call Zombiehuggerr to do it.
---
Nurse’s calling, bbq&amp;chili, sloppy butcher, discordance/rancor/hex perk
---
Console nurse is already terrible, nerfing her is just kicking the shit out of her while she's down
---
It starts literally on the day of my first exam and ends before the date of my last one :c
---
Unfortunate timing.
---
Oh man, Shiny Pidgey!
---
Bois it happened to me twice in one day! That's why I even made the post lol
---
It’s the Freddies like you that make me scared to face after the buff. You guys will probably be unstoppable.
---
2nd may till 6th.
---
DC anytime the Killer does anything that even remotely hinders survivors. And be sure to report them at the end because they made you cry.
---
Legion was fixed not nerfed. And yes, nurse is getting reworked.
---
I thought you were going to put in very small letters "bitch".
---
You put the season 1 filter on Claudettes pasted face.  
---
Condragulations you are the winner of this weeks challenge
---
Only 4Heads play concole anyway they are lowskill killers, Makes no differance to you.
---
This post is almost as bad as nurse unbalanced.
---
You can still see through it. Just not as easily.
---
If the entirety makes the killers stronger, how weak will the killers be by the vocal minority of it?
---
you just said you could prevent discord from used. that is removing the outside game communication (its safe to assume that would include other chat programs too).
---
I appreciate you remember my name &lt;3
---
Who plays console lmao
---
It's not lag. Hitboxes are shit! It didn't used to be like this.
---
If you eat pallets with Hag you probably play her wrong.

People who own the game on PS4 or Xbox one

Your welcome

Yeah, you right. Console killers have about the same killing skill as your literacy skill
---
Nooo poor baby Wraith!
---
If you were into image software I'd highly recommend affinity. I find it much simpler than photoshop once you get the hang of it and it's just a one time purchase of £50 (Idk how that converts sorry).
---
Oh, I get it.
---
When it decides to work. Shock Therapy on the Doctor tends to be very unreliable.
---
I use NOED because I want to punish gen rushers. I won’t camp unless gates are nearby tho
---
It's a remnant from the Halloween Event.
---
I use it
---
I haven’t had temple of purgation in so long!  I quite miss it actually. 
---
It’s been mothers dwelling a lot. 
---
RNG is weird.
---
Finally, more hits through pallets
---
Yes it will receive a nerf, but it still will be very strong. Normal opening gate time is 20 seconds. New Remember Me time maxes out at 16 seconds so altogether 36 seconds. Add in the 50% debuff from Freddy's sleep for a total of 52 seconds. So it is about 25 seconds shorter than what it is now but it's still very strong.
---
I swear to god Freddy has the potential to be fine. Late game Freddy can make it so that the exit gates never get opened. They just need to make his ability more reliable. Shorten the transition, extend the range, reduce the number of way the survivors can get out of the dream world.
---
&gt;punish gen rushers
---
B  R  U  H
---
No they would buff pc to top it off
---
I highly doubt that happened. There's no way that wasn't a pip, even with the broken system.
---
I love dropped pallets as the Hag. Survivors are atracted to them like flies. Put a trap on the other side and they're yours.
---
Well yes maybe, but if he would hit the right of the vault it would make the ding sound
---
I feel your pain homie. I posted something similar recently. I remember with survivor I could get on a game in 15 minutes (which is still a lot) but I was The Hag in a lobby and within two hours played two games. (Not even as killer, I had to switch back to survivor) to find one. It was really frustrating.
---
You have clearly no idea how tue ranks work... you can only get +2 pips.
---
u right
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
Slug n’ Sabo are both good options for ways to play. Teabagging is when it gets dumb AF because the only reason to do it is to make people mad.
---
Or they can drop endgame and proceed to nerf legion and pig for reasons
---
And teabagging is generally considered disrespectful in gaming. It can also be really hypocritical because a lot of Survivors who don't do that mid chase will do it at the exits. That effectively means "oh, guess what, you dumb fuck? I'm awesome! You're not!"
---
fuck that window. FUCK THAT WINDOW
---
Holy fuck i think im playing incorrectly. I fought you can get max 2 pips but with those calculations i would be able to leap a few ranks at a time.
---
Hands down the best change of this patch.
---
Got nothing for gatekeeper, red for sacrifice and silver for the 2 others and I almost pipped but diden't, I got a 4 man with 1 gen left
---
Not only that, but the generator repair noise has been cleaned up too
---
Imagine wallowing in your own disgusting behavior for fun
---
Wait, why not? Just left click them and they're forced to leave. Or drop the guy and start a chase. This is more favorable for the Killer because it guarantees that 2+ survivors are not doing generators.
---
It effectively allows you to play the game without the need for patrolling generators. It also initiates more killer/survivor interaction, which IMO is the whole point of the game.
---
I’ve gotten red forest most of the time. Every now and then I’ll get the temple of purgation
---
Sure sure xD
---
Someone legitimately said this to me under these exact conditions, along with "who plays wraith anyway? Only losers." 
---
Way to kick a guy when he's down... :(
---
Umm OP was playing survivor not killer, so you may want to revise this comment
---
It's almost like you failed to read that i already acknowledged that SWF wasn't an original feature. Incredible.
---
Looks like mud and sticks.
---
Have a block since you can't read the rules.
---
Why does everyone hate nurse? She isn’t even that powerful unless the killer knows how to play her and the survivors don’t understand how to avoid her blinks
---
Would you stop with the pig nerfs? Its getting so old now! The pig isnt worthless, it's just one playstyle that is gone. They didnt completely remove her ffs
---
Hey man that game was great!
---
Run open handed for 24 meters of fun, or with a swf group get 48 meters of WTF
---
Just gonna say that anyone commenting like you are the killer should get their eyes checked
---
 can you say that build  are you using ?
---
I thought the title was about the sabotaged hook at first.
---
I second Puppers. He’s super positive and his cosplays are awesome.
---
I think my last 4 iridescent was on piggy pig or billy. Good for you for being able to play Freddy I can’t do shit as him
---
Someone legitimately said this to me under these exact conditions, along with "who plays wraith anyway? Only losers."
---
UnbreakaBill is fine, Wake Up is a fringe perk no one uses, and it only makes sense.
---
Didn't get a fair shake
---
Yeah Ormond is a basic af map with just a few snow textures added. Combine that with broken auras and :)
---
As a ps4 player, I never get salt like that. Nobody says shit like thst unless the person actually IS being a dick.
---
Why do you got be rude to the leathery boi, not all of them are campers
---
I kinda thought the traps on your head not letting you leave was kinda her whole Schtick but ok
---
I actually do tho I just like how it looks and everybody knows what it is
---
Holy shit dude, chill out with range. He’s gonna be across the map and you can still see him
---
Michael Myers was William Shatner all along? Plot twist of the century.
---
How about a No Mither David who decides to cleanse?
---
Honestly!  If you never posted this I probably would have forgotten about the temple. I play many hours a night and I can’t remember the last time I was on it. 
---
A lot of Springwood lately?
---
The only toxic thing hear is the teabagging and the DCs. Getting hooks to 99% is a legit strategy.
---
I was laughing so hard from start to finish of this comment.
---
The other day it happened to me like 3 times in 2 hours. I was always the first one to die. My friends were laughing really badly while t-bagging around my body. It was a sad day :'(
---
Jeff is alone because he looks like the fucking killer with his face paint
---
The cult if Herman Carter is displeased, but that's fair.
---
Didn't BHVR's recent post on Dedicated Servers already list all of the regions that would be supported pretty much identical to what you just listed?
---
*Shhhhh, he was just really charming*
---
I had a lot of fun with it, sometimes a lot more than with dbd. One can only imagine if the games potential would played out better
---
It's an ineffective strategy
---
It's effective for me, maybe you're doing it wrong.
---
Come on, boil over and slippery meat aren't that bad, boil over will only be helpful when playing swf(it's basically like the survivor version of mad grit, and that perk is super situational).Slippery meat is just sprint burst but after you get hit. It's pretty much the same as other exhaustion perks (I'd actually argue that it's worse, given that sometimes you get hit after vaulting or dropping down)
---
They gonna do a sabo build and not bring unbreakable or no mither? Okay
---
It's effective based on circumstance. If the Surviviors are over altruistic then yeah it works. If they are doing Gens then you camping just prevents one person from playing the game.
---
So Doc can look a little less demented?
---
People were finding matches fast but getting really bad pings because they were finding matches against people in other regions.
---
A lot of them complained about it so they reverted it.
---
if i remember correctly there are add-ons  that either make your movement speed considerably faster while cloaked or tremendously increase your vaulting speed. I've had some fun matches either outrunning the survivor and uncloaking in a place that's inconvenient for them, or bamboozling them with the vault speed and blocking their way with that. 
---
maybe that's something to try, but most importantly just have fun. :)
---
So I was right when I said it was effective xd
---
Oh. My. God.
---
This is perfect.
---
They deserved that, if it wasn't for the micro teabag they would have gotten away with it.
---
I feel that Wraith mains should be respected as much as Freddy mains, and Wraiths can be cool and coordinated anyways. But even with any killer, some survivors will still be disrespectful unfortunately. -_-
---
All you need to do is keep running the loop if he decides to shock because he slows down and you dont granting you more laps. His shock is only good for shutting down window vault loops.
---
have you tried not camping?
---
you're*
---
I need a cig after watch that revenge porn.
---
Well that just killed the hype...
---
Wraith can vault?
---
So since it doesn't operate in Russia, no chance of there ever being servers there, huh. Not even Eastern Europe. Shame.
---
I think that ruin doesnt do enough against good players and you dont need it against worse ones. Evidence: lol
---
Hey there, I did kinda start the post off with "So currently, the DbD Team at BHVR has deployed Servers to these locations..." I took that information directly from that post, but they said if there is demand they could add more regions and I just wanted to state all the regions they can deploy to. I know people in Australia weren't *too* happy with there not being a datacenter for them. But if enough people complain, or on full release, they can add in those extra 7 regions for everybody to be better off.
---
Not the legion-esque way, I mean the regular window vaults :)
---
I think your title is wrong, mate.
---
There is literally nothing wrong with openly bragging about your character being stronger than your opponent's in a supposedly competitive game. Showing that u can waste time crouch spamming and pointing because survivors are so heavily favoured is literally exactly what every killer wants to see when they choose to play this dying game (pun unintended).
---
Until they pick Nurse. I've yet to see someone crouchspam me when im playing NOED nurse.
---
Here's the conversation part of your downvote, trash.
---
I use it for XP.
---
Oh ok. I wasn't aware.
---
And the noise sounds like it too
---
Genrushing is getting gens done really fast. Perks like ruin keep that from happening. NOED  punishes gen rushing because if you gen rush you have no time to cleanse dulls. There's a reason it's harder to pip when you gen rush or are immersed, the game wants you to get chased and all. If more players understood that, NOED wouldn't go off as much as it does.
---
Using a perk makes you bad, got it.
---
I thought killers couldn't vault at all

---
what i meant was the Ash + Legion DLC. Couldn't remember the name. Anyways, thanks !
---
These perks wouldn't be that strong in my opinion, They would just become more viable but there are things that are extremely powerful on the survivor end.
---
i don’t get why this sub hates f13 so much. yeah, dbd is better but f13 is still really awesome. i don’t remember a time i was ever more addicted to a game than i was to f13
---
I like. Maybe one farm, one autohaven, and one estate could be changed while the other realms get a new circus type. We don't need more maps in those realms.

Reminds me of the time I was doing my first play through of Metal Gear Solid 3, and I got to The End boss fight.  About 2 minutes into the 30 minute fight, my father decides, after sleeping as quiet as a corpse for the past 2 hours, to suddenly start snoring like an absolute motherfucker.  He snored so loud that I, sitting in my room with a closed door on the opposite end of the house wearing noise cancelling headphones, could hear him as loudly as if he were in the room with me.  Made the fight quite a bit more tricky, as I had no idea when The End actually WAS asleep and it was safe for me to move, and when the snoring belonged to my dad.
---
Why do you quote the killer and paraphrase what you said?
---
I would ask why you didn't include teabagging but know that if he did, there'd be an earthquake
---
I agree, wraith was terrible back then but now he's actually pretty decent. The issue with him is that he's very add on reliant(kinda like trapper). When I say that I'm specifically referring to windstorm. Without windstorm the wraith is a pile of crap because his invisibility gives him very little speed. Windstorm gives you the ability to apply more map pressure because of your speed and immensely helps you barrel down on an unsuspecting survivor using bbq. With windstorm and swift hunt, wraith is actually pretty good and bodyblocker wraith is a very good build
---
What happens to farm?
---
&gt;The survivors job is to escape alive. If a survivor can't escape, their fault for not doing stuff that helps them escape, such as looping killer or cleansing dulls.
---
Dulls aren't a priority and looping is in the killers favor bc they can hit through windows, have Bloodlust, and naturally move faster than Surviviors, etc. 
---
&gt;Survivors complain about killer slugging when it can help you get kills if you do it right.
---
Which is not a valid complaint
---
&gt;Killers complain about being looped which is the survivor trying to survive.
---
Which is also not a valid complaint. 
---
&gt;If a survivor gets downed with NOED its their fault for not cleansing dulls.
---
It's also bc the killer failed to apply gen pressure which is how they complete their primary win condition. 
---
&gt;If killers are bad for using NOED and ruin to complete their objective (getting kills) survivors are bad for using Adrenaline and Self care to escape alive
---
Self care I can concede on but considering Adrenaline only triggers if the Surviviors complete their primary win condition of doing the gens, it's not a crutch perk. It rewards good gameplay, not bad.
---
So ask if anyone has room in their SWF for a fledgling player. Ours has taken many a survivor in, and I know I've taken a few killers under my wing when they were clearly new and we skunked  em. 
---
This community can be suuuuuper toxic, but also there are a lot of honestly decent people in it, too.  
---
Look to the killer mains. We're the best. 
---
*flicks lit match toward pile of greasy rags*

I’d watch the shit outta this
---
Looks more like all the survivors had to pee at once.
---

---
&gt;There are no crutch perks. It's playing the game. If a survivor runs Decisive they're just playing the game, they aren't using a crutch.
---
You clearly didn't see old Decisive
---
&gt;If a killer runs blood warden and goes off, it's your fault for not escaping if you die.
---
Yes it is. But if the killer runs Noed then apparently it's your fault for doing the gens
---
Agree, their issues though is that they're add on reliant. Wraith without windstorm or trapper without extra traps are terrible
---
Your art style is adorable
---
Just use we'll make it instead. Does the same thing but doesn't have a downside
---
Well, we’ll watch the Pig’s career with great interest then lol
---
Privileged lol. btw, I myself can't even imagine playing this game with a controller tbh. How the fuck do you look at the killer and keep as close to the loop as possible at the same time with that thing?
---
I also have no idea how it's mapped on the controller, but putting those actions on the same button really makes no sense to me
---
Thx so much. I've actually had my eye on this pack. I was just unaware that it had been updated.
---
I like this concept. Not only do you have to be worried about what sort of William a person might be playing but the killer too. This would be interesting to play with.
---
You are in a minority then :) anyway. I'm glad aboutthe changes .
---
True, perhaps I need an upgrade.
---
Just wait till the 4 P3 Squadette all with no mither sabo builds
---
I’ve never seen a lower effort post.
---
Little Sister is the survivor
---
Legion and bubba OP pls nerf
---
I like Whispers and used it before I got BBQ. But I would definitely argue that Ruin is really strong and helpful.
---
Same here, nurse is super strong BUT she's strong if you know how to use her. Using her requires a lot of skill that a lot of people tend to underestimate(for some reason?), and I genuinely enjoy playing against her as survivor
---
Sprint burst is overrated IMO. It´s not that hard to counter since I don´t swing if I see a survivour walking near me. Then you also walk to gens so you don´t have to waste it and it´s just not worth it. Balanced landing is my favourite since it kind of works even when you are exhausted. Never run two exhaustion perks together since that won´t work well
---
I played spirit once, for a daily.. got pretty much the same thing. Only one person put 2 and 2 together and felt like shit because his friends were acting like that. 
---
His comments  
---
Wait  
---
Spirit?  
---
Deaf?  
---
Are you really deaf?  
---
Me:  
---
Yes, I am really deaf, had a daily that I was trying to complete.  
---
Him:  
---
Shit, I am sorry, I apologize for them too.

“Congratulations, you played yourself.”- Killer who got a 4K because the SWF spent so much time 99%-ing hooks and following the killer around to destroy/body blocks any hooks nearby that they never actually get around to doing 2 gens
---
Thanks &lt;3 I wish you would have asked first though since I spent so long making these; I found these through a friend of mine.  
---
I actually considered making these just to see how they would look, but I never did because Happy Clown doesn't have every perk, particularly the newer ones, and I wanted all of mine to match. But they look cute together. :)
---
Perks with NO counter are crutches. Old decisive was a crutch as there was 0 counter except slugging the player to death. Now the counter is not tunneling someone off hook.
---
This is indeed pretty controversial and a lot will disagree but after all it's your opinion, I completely respect it :)
---
There is no way this is not made up, like, jesus, this is the first ever game of these survivors?! Jesus Christ
---
I mean I said nothing about the lower tier killers, it’s just that all the higher tier killers have a way to deal with pallets and those who can’t are bad at low ranks
---
IMO pallets should be a last resort, not core to survivor gameplay. Probably not a popular opinion
---
The regular price is 12$ with 10% off when you buy the full set (10.80$) but the full set is 25% off right now (9$).
---
try to get better on the chainsaw flick, or predict the survivor when you are gonna use chainsaw
---
I’ve had both maps just today so I don’t think they replaced anything.
---
Reasons for survivors DC'ing: "Camping, tunneling, Nurse, Spirit, Myers, NOED, Legion, Doctor, first found, first down, grabbed in locker, slugging, Billy, missed DS".
---
I'll have to add Huntress to the list.
---
Garbage

I just read what Surveillance does and damn that sounds really really op.

---
I run Hex: Ruin, BBQ, Nurse´s and sloppy butcher. This build on every game.
---
Ruin is once again obvious. I use bbq for points and then of course it´s nice to leave the hook asap for someone else. Nurse´s is amazing on spirit since people don´t always expect her to arrive when they don´t know where she moves exactly. I´ve gotten so many sneaky downs with this perk. And sloppy butcher to slow down the game more. When you phase walk it´s nice when they bleed more you know.
---
I´d never use spirit fury on her. Because I´d have also have to use enduring and brutal strength. I think that perk wasn´t made for her really. I use enduring + spirit fury on my trapper and it´s just fantastic. Never tried bamboozle on spirit so idk. I think you can mindgame survivours on loops so easily that you should use something better.  Can´t say anything about Infectious Fright since I don´t even have it at all. If that build works for you, have fun. But I would not use it  that much tbf
---
These are cool, but I'm tired of survivor perks completely trashing killer perks, so many viable survivor perks compared to killer, survivors get direct buffs, like ds, MoM, exhaustion perks, killers get no buffs directly towards killing, if they do this to survivor it would gut killer completely, so they would definitely need some killer reworks too
---
There's only 2 crutch perks in this game. Nothing else is a crutch. Crutch perks are way harder to counter. Perks that help you complete your objective are just perks. You're allowed to complete objective when gates are powered, so NOED is not a crutch. When playing agianst good survivors, NOED doesn't usually go off. They know they HAVE to cleanse dulls to counter NOED.

He won't play unless he can exploit. Needs everything handed to him.

I was thinking about buying The Spirit, The Plague and Legion. But I might weight and see who the next killer is.

The fact it's on Lery's makes the idea a tough sell. Unless they exclusively travel via window it's hard to catch someone off-guard

I'm running on like 3 hours of sleep and have been laughing at this comment thread for like ten mins. Fuck.
---
You basically have to 99% a ton of hooks. Unless you're swf and very coordinated, it typically wastes time.
---
I used to main that white cat. I think his name was toro toro or something
---
This is pathetic tbh
---
Not to mention that you counted individual killers buff but not their nerfs
---
Your a stupid fucking loser. But a great person and I’m jealous that I’m not your friend :(
---
No deer hunter 
---
Your playing a dangerous game when it comes to finding them
---
Yasss kweeen. I'm am living for this.
---
I use the lunge he gets after uncloaking to my advantage a lot, it’s mostly a tracking build but I make sure it’s a fast uncloak
---
BUZZ LOOK A SHIRTLESS MYERS!
---
Nurse Main for life
---
I know the feels bro. Thanks for the insult.
---
He also said he put 500 traps over 50 games and only corrected himself when someone pointed it out. And he said he “knew it” because of a “bug” where he could hear billy sounds all over the map
---
Rank 10 is just fine mate. I´m rank 7 myself and I will keep myself there. I get enough challenge there and games are not that toxic and I don´t need to tryhard. Anti loop perks are fine for now :D When looping starts going better you can use something better. 
---
Tip for nurse´s calling or what I like to do:  I see someone healing themselves. I turn around but I know where they are. They don´t know that I do and they expect me to go the other way when they see me. It has happened so many times that it works even if they can hear you phase :D I use very basic add-ons. I was a red rank spirit before but nowadays I don´t have much time or interest to get back where I was
---
He really isn’t,  most games you’ll hit tier 3 evil within, it will most likely wipe the survivor team out
---
Amen
---
You honestly dont just need to saw people. If I'm in a tough match with people who are really good at avoiding a saw I really just use the saw sprint to get from point a to b. I just gen patrol and luckily snipe people with tinker. It reduces your terror radius when a gen gets to 85%. Other than that try add ons the increase steering while charging. They help a lot.
---
I imagine he's calling them DCing disgusting
---
Completely balanced and fair. I'm down
---
That was well played. Not much more to it OP. Fuck those survivors for being toxic to you.
---
The worst thing I hate about Pig's Nerf is the RBT Timer stops if your in the Pig's Terror Radius.  My favorite build with Pig is Distressing, Unnerving Presence, Crate of Gears, and Tampered Timer.  Makes Box Skill Checks harder if I'm in the terror radius.  Now the build is practically scrapped
---
DCing?
---
Imaging being chased end hearing "I see you hot dogging and grandstanding!" "HISTORY BECKONS THE MACH MAN YEAH!!"
---
Who let Susie in here?
---
They should have consecutive trial bonuses. Every trial that you complete,  win or lose, awards increasingly more blood points up to a cap. Disconnect and your bonus is lost.
---
I hate these kind of survivors, like what else is there to do in that situation?
---
The worst Iv seen was during a event I think lunar event. and I had a game where one ahole with sabo and a great toolbox kept my lunar hooks saboed all game. So I 3gen strat keeping the game going till eventually I caught them trying to sabo and got them on that damn lunar hook. Post game the others where upset wondering why I put them in survivor prison. I told them and they went off on the sabo.

ur a survivor main
---
Ouch, that hurt. Not a compliment?
---
No. It would be super shady if you went into the middle of the corn and the carnival was in it.
---
i knew i recognized your name, small world
---
Ruin, BBQ, Pop Goes the Weasel, Whispers. Trade whispers for maybe nurses or sloppy, I just hate immersed survivors.
---
Pop is underrated on mobility killers. Shaving off 20 seconds of time on a gen that they want to tunnel is fun.
---
Me dumm, explain
---
is that a compliment
---
im still considering that maybe they're just making a new Haddonfield map xD
---
YES. Also why are flashlights toxic? I get they're annoying and people that sit there and click them repeatedly are kind of annoying bitches, but they're an in-game mechanic we're not supposed to utilize just because reasons?
---
Old news, sorry bud
---
Wouldn't we all?
---
That’s an oof and a half
---
For me it just shows why I hate this game and almost completely stopped playing it... I mean billy easily downing two survivors in 10 seconds, not the hook sabo thing.
---
Yes, very
---
you need to practice, it's really difficult at the beginning as a killer since most of the survivors at those ranks depipped from red/purple ranks on purpose so they can be a bunch of dicks against an inexperienced killer. anyway, try to lobby dodge if you don't feel going against swf since they're difficult to deal with
---
No, this game just happened to be worse than ones I usually get as killer maybe it's just one of those things where because I was killer and not a survivor it just seemed more toxic than normal I dunno ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
TL;DR is supposed to be at the top of the comment, btw.
---
This doesn't make sense. The other two were always terrible, the pig has always been mid tier, and a great choice for any serious killer mains who don't need to rely on high tiers to make it to rank 1
---
I once had a salty survivor (random) who told me to report a killer who was slugging and camping. I told him to screw off. The truth is, the killer was slugging because we were stupid and were all in the same place.
---
And it wasn't Billy, it was Wraith.
---
Oh, sorry I'll be sure to remember that next time I post thanks!
---
They all disconnected and t bagged. That's pretty toxic.
---
inb4 it's just the Hag outfit available for Shards.
---
They were just playing the game.  The only thing I cannot condone is the t-bagging and hate message
---
Untss untss untss, baby, untss untss untss
---
Not anywhere near this type of game but SMITE(a MOBA), has a system for commendations. It gets you extra shit as you get more commendations per month.
---
 You can only do it per person once per day, which would balance SWF I would think
---
Top tier shit post.
---
Well , you have to at least entertain the killer, otherwise they won't be able to go on reddit or the official forums and brag about their skilled 4k. Instead they will make threads about how survivors are giving up and not "adapting" or something like that.
---
The things themselves aren’t toxic, it’s people who choose to do it over and over, like if a friend gets DS and they were all swarming me, and choose to body block and Tbag over and over, that’s toxic. They know they have the advantage and still act like that, which is what makes some of us feel it’s toxic. Otherwise it’s not really looping or playing the game. It’s how they choose to send “messages” through game body language, like flashlight clicking the killer when they miss a hit.
---
Yeah normally I play what I think is a decent myers, I just felt that doctor could give me more points this time
---
I agree with you but from playing a lot of DnD, a Lich can absolutely have been human at one point, not saying they would do that but that would be cool
---
Yeah, happens to me once in a while.
---
Also, Huntress was stealthy buffed. Like wtf, you nerf Pig but buff Huntress. I hope that thing with headshots is a PTB-only thing
---
Don’t apologise it’s nw, I just know some people don’t know that. It means “too long, didn’t read” so it goes first. :)
---
Omg I just realized that was a bird I thought that was a pig with husks for some reason
---
Show me video of him camping.
---
She got a big fat nerf in the PTB (the worst of which was recently reverted)
---
How can i do this? i play ps4 console. dont think i recorded or anything either ):
---
It's a bug, I assure you.
---
Dbd is not a full price game
---
There is literally a perk for slugging. Someone bitchs about slugging then they are either grouping up on killer or are not healing people when killer is in a chase.
---
Can’t buy bubba with shards
---
Nah, I just repeated exactly what you said and instead of gaining any insight from that, you doubled down on being smug. I can clearly see why no one would ever want to talk to you.
---
Hell, my Wraith is basically a corrupted Shinobi on 'roids. If he has a way to uncloak out of sight, he'll get that first hit before they even know what happened. 
---
But it was Haddonfield and they were gen rushing. I wasn't running that build and they all had Flashlights. It was a painful match and the icing on that hellish cake was a **radioactive** survivor that taunted relentlessly in game, and postgame condemned me, and said unimaginably rude things to me despite the fact that she was my only hook. She insulted everything--my playstyle, my choice of killer, and otherwise talked like the OchiDO fanboy she was. I'm not an easy guy to get to cry, usually, but I know I was close. 
---
On the upside, through everything this guy was saying, a friendly survivor asked me to "leave the chat--it isn't safe for you. I'll take it from here." and friended me to confirm via steam chat that s/he had screenshotted the postgame chat and submitted both reports in game and on Steam on counts of communication abuse and Cyberbullying. S/he too admitted that this was the worst s/he'd ever seen when it came to the aforementioned.
---
You're right, it overfull price game. More than 150$ is required If you want to be able to play all the content.
---
Womp womp
---
Then we dont know if he camped. You could be lying.
---
30k isn't that much honestly for a game development. But yeah
---
Ouch sorry. Guess you need to look like salty killer and leave right away to avoid this for awhile
---
While I agree with this in general, DbD is not a full priced game and so far as I’m aware it never has been.  It was a half price game at launch and now goes for $20(+ local taxes).  I mean it’s still way too fucking grindy and  for a game you pay money for, I absolutely agree, but it was never full priced and if you bought all of the game altering content (not cosmetics) that was unable to be grinded (basically just all the licensed DLC killers) I still don’t think the game will have reached full price, since the killers standalone are like $5 a pop and there are 4 you can’t get without shards, equalling another $20 on top of the $20-40 you paid.
---
I would be interested to see intentional DCs vs unintentional (noise vs no noise)
---
I've done this before and we all four escaped. However we were also running flip flop, boil over, unbreakable and tenacity.
---
Tacky is an understatement. It's fucking stupid.
---
You pay for the base game, then you can get all unlicensed killers and survivors (with their perks respectively) for free if you play a lot.
---
And depending on how patient you are you could maybe get a few $10 skins for free
---
BBQ was just on the shrine.
---
Now killers can moonwalk to mindgame at these loops, instead of just following the survivor around mindlessly several times.
---
Then I guess by your logic World of Warcraft is a $3,000 game since that’s how much is required if you wanted to play all of the content
---
Do you not have $5?
---
I have it happen more when I do an action, throw a pebble, self care, things like that
---
yea, ur a killer main
---
Oh holy shit you're right. I thought I made it pink. *facepalm*
---
Should’ve gotten it, so much bp with that perk
---
Of course they'd disconnect, you were clearly gonna tunnel the whole game. What else would you bring a shovel for?
---
I don't get it
---
Easy title for this post: I want to die
---
A rank 15 baby killer trying to justify camping lol
---
As others have said, Doc forces Survivors to drop pallets with his shock therapy.
---
Also, one can argue that Trapper makes Survivors avoid pallets.
---
I wasn't justifying it in the comment giving context I acknowledged I was also being toxic
---
I mean you clearly do care, otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned it. As for "being killed instantly" there are a few ways to avoid Jason and his shifting. Similarly to Spirit's phasing. Aside from being able to see people, it literally works the exact same way. Easiest way to avoid being instakilled to have someone else next to you. Or just have a pocket knife. This is assuming the Jason is smart enough to use stalk while shifting. In most cases they just shift. In which case you don't even need a knife or teammate. Use the vhs rewind effect as a signal to start moving. Just like when you hear a DbD's killer's terror radius. 
---
Its not hard to avoid being killed at all when you know what you're doing.
---
A killer main saying NO MITHER is comparable to noed.
---
I've seen it all now.
---
Wow. Just... wow. I'm not entirely deaf myself, but my ears are pretty weak after years in construction. It rubs me the wrong way to read stuff like this nonetheless. Besides, deaf and even *trying* to play Spirit? You, my friend, are a badass.
---
Imagine still bitching about decisive strike.
---
If you were also being toxic then why post this here?
---
If he died at 3k points you probably camped or tunnelled
---
It's almost as if the game was designed to be more like a horror movie/party game, and not a competitive experience.
---
Kind of, that why I never played this game.
---
*BUFFS:*
---
&gt;Adam is now hella thicc
---
the animation isn’t over
---
dude, I love constructive criticism. I love it so much when people attack my point and we can discuss and we can both walk away more experienced and intelligent.
---
Please, explain to me how no mither isn't comparable to noed. Both are perks that skip health states at little to no cost.
---
I'm trying to figure out how he connected the two perks, honestly.
---
My best experience was running up to two bastards who had just grabbed the boat and started boating off, nearly got them with a shotgun and heard an 'OH SHIT' fading into the distance as they kept going.
---
Why can't those toxic survivors just run in a straight line or better yet just stand still so I can kill them easier???
---
I have to disagree with this because the wording is a little misleading. The only true “health state skip” on that list is a the syringe. Every other item either gains 1 health state or doesnt even change your standard health state in a given scenario.  For arguments sake you could throw MoM and BT up there though.
---
killer mains wont stop complaining until survivors start on the hook so they dont have to actually play the game
---
I mean, no. I'm not bitching about decisive strike. I'm bitching about the hypocrisy of people who bitch about noed.
---
i don't have a problem with DS at all, just saying it's comparable to noed.
---
yes Im aware
---
I seriously hate that map.  Every survivor I find just makes a beeline for the middle building, and starts running laps.  So boring.
---
well ok. he did tho. his camping isnt the point of my post lol. the point of it is is there any sort of punishment for camping
---
I'll tell you my favorite meme build with Tinkerer, Stealth Billy: Tinkerer, Bitter Murmur, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Dark Devotion w/ Carb Tuning Guide + Muffler add-ons. 
---
Those add-ons make the saw so quiet they can't hear it until you're already in close. M&amp;A throws off any timing based on your TR when not utilizing either Tinkerer or DD. Bitter Murmur + Tinkerer gives you plenty of time for a surprise mother fucker moment while DD makes any time you find your obsession an opportunity to get free saws while patrolling gens. You'll feel like a god if you get Rotten Fields with this build.
---
It just means the timing was too early
---
So I’m not waiting until they’ve completely picked them up?
---
Oooh okay thanks!
---
I love the doctor but I whiff swings with him so much. His lunge range seems off. I use Distressing, Bbq, Ruin and alternate between NOED and STBFL depending on flashlights and tool boxes.  Enjoy 60000-90000 bp everygame. Just that lunge is fucked.
---
But how do i know that? How do i know you werent being toxic? You deleted your post so...
---
How in any way shape or form is Deliverance and DS a crutch
---
It’s fun for the memes tho. And to make crybaby survivors cry of course
---
I would consider every perk on the list a health state skip because even if they don't change a health state, they ignore what could have been a health state change. A convoluted skip, but a skip nonetheless.
---
it’s talking about the noise spirit makes when she goes into her invisible thingo, idk what it’s called
---
I’ll be looking forward to it lol
---
Thank you!, but the art style is inspired by the creator of Tails Gets Trolled and I enjoy mimicking it. XD
---
I mean 99% percenting hooks is scummy so you have to be equally scummy and play slug Billy. Fuck people that talk shit for strays in dbd
---
No i dont have a job, and im 15 so
---
Luckily for me I came across dead by daylight on YouTube and was hooked! I watched it forever before I finally decided to buy a PS4. And luckily for me that month it was free with PS plus. 
---
Can’t get any of my friends to play, which is a drag. They’re all stuck on stupid Apex or Fortnite.
---
when spirit phases there's a whooshing noise that sounds like a vacuum, i like to think she makes the noises w/ her mouth
---
Other than tbagging I don't think they did anything toxic
---

Yep, the post is a bit dramatic with showing them „in need of significant changes“
---
Bro you have no idea how foolish you sound do you?
---
Now that I think about it, it’s mostly when I self-care. Bloody annoying.
---
Have you tried cancelling the search and trying again?
---
Damn good on that guy though nice to hear about him.
---
That was so righteous.  I love the dc. The were so embraced they quit. That's why we need DC punishments.  You made a bad play now deal with it. Nope just DC and think your the victim.  We as a species are doomed.
---
Walking around injured all game is little to no cost? You’ve gotta be a troll
---
No, I don't. Please enlighten me. Explain to me how I'm wrong.
---
Imagine being such a scrub you think that survivors are stronger than instant downs, noed, haunted grounds, movement speeds faster than survivors base walking and running speeds. Just imagine being you where you publicly post that a survivor that can't do shit to a killer except stun them for a few seconds at a time are "stronger" than the one that can remove you from the match. Just imagine thinking you are only able to do this with the nurse. A noed nurse at that. Major yikes. You're so bad at playing killer that you still need noed on nurse? Damn I feel bad for you. It must suck to suck.
---
The Spirits model is the best and scariest in the game. The creepy transitions and cut off body parts are so cool. She's honestly terrifying to play against so I'd say that money was well spent.
---
Thats why its misleading though. “They ignore what COULD have been a health state change.” If you basing it off potential status changes you should include SC, DH, healing etc. This is all semantics though, ill gladly talk about NOED civilly if you want to.

All of the survivor DCs were intentional.  I can't say for sure on the Killer ones but I suspect they are as well.  Survivor DCs always happened after something notable like the deep wounds timer started of they were first down early in the trial.
---
You now have to explain how you possibly see a pig in that image.
---
Tbh, I don't like what DS has become.  A lot of SWF groups are starting to use it as an offensive tool to peel me off their teammates.  They'll run at me while injured, hoping to DS me, while their teammates gets away.
---
It's painfully obvious when people try this stunt, but still annoying nonetheless.
---
NOED is for when you’ve done a bad job as killer. Like so bad you need to one shot all 4 survivors. No Mither makes the whole game harder for the survivor. Sure can’t heal all game. Nothing coming in clutch ever with that perk. It’s ridiculous to see someone making this comparison. Can you hear yourself with your head that far up your ass?
---
Why would you body block a hillbilly? Even if they wiggle off someone is going to pay or multiple are going to pay. Baby survivors 101.
---
Must've hated you if you were using Balanced Landing, too.
---
I actually kinda like that feature and want it in more maps.
---
You use noed because you're bad at the game and can't get kills otherwise
---
That's not a good indicator. The sound is the only reliable indicator. I've been kicked from the game on hook/after being downed/etc. through no fault of my own and I'm sure it looked like a ragequit
---
Holy shit I played with you yesterday you DCd against billy!
---
I don't either. Yes old DS was ass, and a nerf/rework was needed, but rn it's just garbo
---
Pig did the  4% off hook and escaped through hatch. :)
---
Can't believe I actually laughed at that, good job OP.
---
Better stealth than Wraith.
---
I crashed, most likely. What was your in game name? I remember a couple of games where I just randomly dc'd for no reason
---
She did kobe, but she's still looking for the hatch and the Entity is hot on her trail
---
To be fair NoED Trump's half of the things u put up there. If ur running NoED, it doesn't matter if they had Adrenaline any other health state skip, NoED will still down them instantly. As for MoM and BT.. seriously? They might be usable at any given time but u have to have been hit at least 3 times for MoM to work which in a good chunk of the time depending on how sneaky the player is won't activate cause they haven't been hit. As for BT it only activates when being unhooked and that's IF the person unhooking has it. As for no mither, that really doesn't skip any type of health state. Sure it let's u get up from the ground but the person is broken through the entire match. Not only that but that's even IF the killer let's the person stay on the ground long enough which 80% of the time they don't. Most killers wanna hook the survivors they down as fast as possible so they chase other survivors off and go back for them. Soooooo I don't really think those perks are even comparable to NoED since some don't work half the time and NoED beats a majority of them.
---
Well if you're gonna complain about pips and not getting any, it would be beneficial to take a picture of your emblems.
---
Except you don't have to buy the unlicensed DLC with real money. You can get the unlicensed killers and survivors for free if you play enough, since you can buy them with Iridescent Shards.
---
I can get kills and hooks before the gates are powered. Stop assuming stuff without knowing
---
JakeDGZ, I only remember cause I was like “that’s dope she’s deaf yet she still plays a game that requires a lot of listening” which I thought was badass
---
This is honestly a very creative idea you have here, I've played the evil within and it's honestly a very fun horror game and I thought ruvik was honestly very scary. I'm ways ruvik reminds me of the entity and having him as a killer would be kinda similar to the doctor in a way. His name would be 'The patient' and it really is something that I would love to see I have no idea what is power would be but a very good idea.
---
Don't tunnel. If you do, you'll get DCs more often
---
BBQ is the difference from getting 50k to near 100k bp every match during double bp so you def need it.
---
Not enough BBQ
---
This Bill speaks the truth!
---
Did you see the guys points? He was tunneled to death, no wonder they quit
---
Come on Legion pre-update, let's get sickening!
---
As funny as this was, this must have been the third repost in the last week
---
Please stop
---
Hahahaha that was amazing. Thanks for the laugh. Survivor main BTW. I’ve always held the belief that SWF should have two perk slots taken away and only allowed yellow items and add ons at the max. It would make things more fair and would still allow the experience with your friends.
---
Honestly, I bought some killer stuff. Prob spent like $30 . I feel stupid everytime. No one cares how your killer looks. My fav is that hag with red veins.  Even killers I done play I still spend shards on. They got me.
---
I usually play killer and get matched in under a minute. Maybe there aren't enough killers as well.
---
Malke
---
Pretty cool, huh?
---
Wait until they are able to move again. As you keep trying, you'll eventually learn of almost the exact moment that this happens. 
---
You are also able to reblind a killer after blinding them early, but you have to give it a second or so after the first blind in order to do it again.
---
Ok, wow, you can read a posters history, bravo. Allow me to educate you a little in the context of a few of your points against me: 
---
The Legion post, I admit was a bad call. I didn't really know how bad legion was at the time, I had just purchased legion and was infuriated over wanting to learn to play the new killer, but every time I tried I was hit with DC's, which artificially earned me rank 1. I wanted to incite others to play legion more, until plague came out, in order to make legion a common killer, that if DC'ed enough against, would either cause BHVR to punish the DC'ers, Cause players to stop playing which would get BHVR's attention, or FIX LEGION. When I said they weren't getting "nerfed or balanced any time soon" that was, as you pointed out, more than 2 months ago. 
---
Since then the DC "Epidemic" situation has only become WORSE, and it's not caused by peoples choice in killer, build, or tactics anymore, as even killers are DC'ing when the game doesn't go their way. It's because people CAN DC, for WHATEVER REASON they want, and NOT get punished for it... and so they are doing it En Masse. Rewind the clock 7 months ago, and DC'ing for petty reasons was a rarity in this game, now, Its so common that people are making posts declaring that they are uninstalling the game until this crap gets under control. At this rate, how many players will even be left to play by the time the Dedicated servers go online?
---
As for getting Banned from the Steam Forums: I told an admitted Cheater who was discussing getting banned for cheating/hacking on the forums to "DIAF", and I wasn't the only one to get punished for commenting on that post, but the steam forums apparently take umbrage to people insinuating that cheaters should "die", even if its in a "Go F&amp;%K Yourself" context. It was a slip up, caused by impassioned rage at someone who had the gall to defend their right to cheat/hack the game and whining about getting banned for it. 
---
Here's a counter dose of reality for you: 
---
Players DC'ing for petty reasons without repercussions are KILLING THIS GAME! At this point it's becoming impossible for anyone to have fun playing at all when some DC'ing brat ruins the experience for everyone else in the majority of the matches they play. Damn Right I'm vindictive against those kinds of players, as they are ruining the game that I love, and I'm appalled that you are even defending their right to do it! If you don't think the game is fun, stop playing it. Don't get into a match just to screw over everyone else when its not going your way... take it in stride, stick it out until the end, collect your points, take a break and then decide if you are going to queue up for another match or not. I know I'm not alone in thinking this way, and we would all be better off if none of these habitual DC'ers were around for the Blood Hunt Event. Only a brat with delusions of entitlement would defend their right to Rage quit whenever they want despite the fact that this is a MULTIPLAYER GAME! 
---
I play both killers and survivors, and on both sides this crap has been going on at increasing levels for too long. The only way I contributed to the DC behavior is by trying to play the game and have fun. As a rule I never DC unless its bug related, no matter how the game is going for me, because even losing is a learning experience that makes me a better player in the long run. 
---
You want to attack my credibility and overall character? You need look no further than the "unwritten Rules" I wrote and play by:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58509/my-updated-unwritten-rules-list-for-playing-dbd#latest
---
Of which I not only practice, but have posted copies of multiple times in this subreddit whenever people discuss "rules" for playing DbD. 
---
This post isn't "shit" your endeavor to defend petty DC'ers rights to keep ruining the game is, and I have no sympathy, pity, or empathy for your kind.
---
If you saw it others didn't. Keep scrolling :)
---
huh?? no i didnt im new to reddit lol. anyways like i said this isnt the point of my post
---
*stands in a group* hehehe let's run the killer around swf pals! 
---
*gets hit* uR tOxIc GiVe Me HaTcH!!1!1 bAbY kIlLeR bUt U aLsO tRyHaRd SwEaTy!1!1! 
---
honestly killer mains deserve a veterans discount. I couldn't deal w that.
---
Happens every game
---
You run NOED. 
---
But you play a god tier nurse so you never need it.
---
... They already fucking reverted half the fucking "Nerf".
---
She'll probably get buffed from y'alls unnecessary screaming
---
Kinda seems like an ochido rip off. And this sub does not like Ochido. I’d support you as a creator if you made your montages a little more unique.
---
This is the equivalent of saying a killer is bullying survivors by hooking them.
---
Get good baby killer
---
not alone, unless you have one of the two perks that let you recover
---
Most other people have seen it here if they're sorting by new. Posted 4 hours ago.
---
The person vaulted through the second floor window.
---
Use doc Ruin, BBQ, Distressing,  and other stall game perk. Put on zap 75% extender big bp offerings you have. Zap.zap.zap over and over. If get a few kills 60000 to 80000. No kill 40000. You can get a million in a few hours. Works every time.
---
Movie's been out for 3 days. Go see the shits
---
They earned that.
---
I play survivor about 90%, killer 10%. Those DC'ing douchebags deserved what they got. Dropping the hook in front of a killer like that is a meme and can be funny. But the Toxic Nea took it further by doing the shitty t-bag and emote. Besides it is their fault for trying to swarm and body block. Once you drop that survivor they should have tried to run you away from the survivor on the ground then go for the save. They failed and a second player went down very close to the other. You have no reason to leave or pick up. So they got what they deserved.
---
That sounds great. My deal is everybody sees me from a mile away so I will try this out.
---
Nice key bud
---
Bro its not camping, its "soft patrolling".
---
Dude no camping or tunneling happened. I put him on the hook and he tried to escape. Didn't jump off hook then didn't struggle so died. I went after each of the other players and as soon as I would get close they DC.
---
killer mains incoming GRAB THE GUNS
---
My mistake I only mentioned lich because I saw someone recommend it before and thought it would be a cool idea. I moreso ment that they wouldn't do it because a lich requires a necromancy based magical transformation which is something I don't think dbd would go into. They seem to be doing more people doing bad things then becoming deformed by the entity but I would love a skeleton aesthetic killer so we can get spoopy memes on this sub.
---
Practice. That is all I can say. Learn loops, learn what each killer does. It took me a long time to get decent at surviving. I say decent, because I know I am not "good" at it. I still have my good games I can run a killer for a long time, then there are days I run right into a wall, a tree, rocks, or any other object.
---
It wasn't 100% more objective?
---
43 × 2 = 86
---
86 + 200 + 400 + 713 = 1399 BP
---
Because DS is an anti tunnel perk, not a jail free card. 
---
If your DS hasn't been used within 60s, the killer didn't tunnel you.
---
At least you aren't using Deja Vu. Then I'd definitely complain
---
He’s slamming his feet hard to sound scarier
---
you realize that would've made DS even stronger and unbalanced than before, right?
---
Stridor is a great perk for her, especially while phasing as it'll make following someone a hell of a lot easier.
---
Nah, usually it's "oh my God my team is absolute trash and useless," or "I should have done -insert 20 things- instead and we would have won," whereas in DBD it's "oh my God the -other side- is trying way too hard." Well... in DBD it's usually both but still.
---
Didn't it used to be up all the time before ?
---
This my build now also... it helps me out so much!!
---
Nobody asked for your opinion.
---
Oh, so the game isn’t even really out yet, is it? Yes, I’m aware you can pat money for it right now and play it tonight. It’s only available on Discord. *It isn’t really out yet.*
---
On xbox it takes me about 5 to 10 minutes.
---
lol So toxic Survivors will give positive accommodations to each other while giving 4x the negative accommodations to the Killer. Brilliant.
---
Bbq, nurses, save the best for last, ruin
---
Pop goes the weseal.
---
Over charge
---
Or the killer can just wait until the 60 seconds are up to pull you out for a free hook.
---
It's hilarious when it works, though it's definitely map dependent. Like you've noticed Billy is still easy to see, so you want a map with either plenty of corn or plenty of walls. Play it a bit like a Myers and hug the outer walls when you can with DD since you've got 30 seconds to play with.
---
&gt; You can even jump in a locker while DS is active to force the killer to catch if you are afraid of being slugged. 
---
Thats a good advice, which I never considered tbh, still feels kind of wasted if you get chased for 60 seconds and get picked up after the perk is down.
---
Maybe not reducing the timer while in terror radius would do the trick
---
Fuck, all those rage quits were sexy.
---
What if they're on the killers shoulder?
---
I personally love the Clowns lore; he just rolled into the Entity’s realm one day, got given a load of bottles, and got to work.
---
Nice fuckin watermark lmao
---
Ive updated the text with a lot more details than before
---
Devil/demon, sea monster, alien, robot, gorgon
---
By people you mean you. Good job. You forgot to ask me if I care.
---
I really like the idea of a killer that could possess survivors, because it could add an element of paranoia to seeing other survivors that would make you think twice about who you trust 
---
Unfortunately they’d be hard countered by SWF’s more so than most killers
---
Surveillance in incredible on her.
---
you’re overthinking it if, “1 person plays the killer and you do hide-and-seek and tag with 4 people, in a creepy cornfield or abandoned school,” doesn’t work.
---
&gt;The same concept applies when slugging you.
---
Being slugged is better than being rehooked. Once again, as long as my teammates come pick me up as soon as I'm finished recovering.
---
You sound like the type of person to run MoM, DS, Dead Hard, and Adrenaline then cry when you die on first hook after being camped
---
But you sound like the type who plays Pig and doesn't use NOED because those mother fuckers aren't making it past 2 gens with your skill level
---
1) NOED arguments are stupid, get over yourself  
---
2) I was a survivor, like, did you /just/ see the NOED perk and jump to comment about it?
---
From a survivor perspective, I appreciate but don't expect some farming.
---
Or Jumpscare Myers
---
Frank looks like Julie. They’re clearly long-lost-relatives and shouldn’t be shipping.
---
I honestly don’t know if it’s that much of a nerf, I understand that they’re making his power less powerful, but he seems more fun to play and they’re increasing his base movement speed so he seems like he will become more viable imo
---
As a former Xbox now PC player, you guys are better off without it
---
DwM should change to be "Any action that causes exhaustion will hide scratch marks for 3 seconds" then it covers lithe, SB, BL, and Head On.
---
I'm so lost about where that came from, too, like, we got maybe the first 2 gens, possibly 3 done quickly, but the last two were much slower, especially when the pig started facecamping people (me) next to 2 of the last gens that were close together.  I totally agree with genrush as a concept, but that's a game thing, not a survivors-being-toxic thing, and we... didn't really rush this game anyway.
---
Funny, but I've never actually seen this happen.
---
I totally didn't expect that many comments thinking I was somehow insulting myself.
---
If you go into games with the goal of ruining someone's experience and mocking them for it, you are the problem.
---
Did you honestly expect a good reaction out of a community that loves this game enough to be apart of a subreddit dedicated to it when you shit talk the entire way of business for the company? That's already a way to eat plenty of downvotes, further amplified by the fact that your numbers are wrong.
---
Even if they were correct, 80% of even remotely popular games use this system yet moderate it even less.
---
why would the survivors have a phone in the entity's realm. that's it. that's the one sentence to destroy that entire wall of text.
---
I'm honestly surprised, I didn't think the NOED debate was so bad that it disrupted people's ability to look at a picture and tell who's who.
---
Then they can go ahead and DC just like they do for no reason most times anyway. There are much bigger problems for sure
---
I find that in my ranks a lot of killers dont know about the sound so I just take advantage of it.
---
Yeah this is true. Thats why I usually just stop and let them catch me so I can gain some more distance with the free stun.
---
Isn't an opinion if it's true
---
