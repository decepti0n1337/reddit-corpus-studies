Report them for using perk... yeah ok
---
---
---
I play like that unless I’m Mikey Boi.
---
Clown should be in a higher tier my guy
---
I'm sorry, something tells me you're not even purple ranks. Guess that's not optimal either :)
---
I cant hate on ardetha the man is the best nurse i've seen. I dont know bricky. I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. I am a little salty freddy aint on here but he would get put at the bottom if he was.
---
2 rank 13 and a rank 18 it's gunna heavily favor the lower rank killers than the higher rank ones when I'm with 3 others 2 red ranks and 2 green we get around purples or reds constantly so it just favored one end of the game over the other specifically because there are more killers in the lower ranks than in the red ranks
---
Yet.
---
the 4 kill mories are overpowered, the others are fine probably. If you think halving the survirvors life is not that bad in the game's balance you are delusional.
---
I love you, console Nurses. 💜 I’m sure I’ll come across a good console Nurse soon enough who will destroy me and it’ll be terrifying.
---
Well,I guess I'm no longer a Pig main :(
---
This just happened to a killer I talked with a couple days ago. They went in as the Trapper and ended up being Leatherface even though they never made the purchase lol.
---
The new incel subreddit
---
I mean, Freddy isn't "strong" at all, he's actually the weakest killer untill his rework. You're able to play against any killer, whether or not they're good is all dependent on the player.  I wouldn't bother with a flashlight especially if you don't know how to get a flashlight save or know how to loop. When I first played the game things scared me at times, but now it's not that scary. I just love looping with the killer and trying to mind game, it's like a game of chess, you never know how a chase will end.
---
@ u/I_X_A, you are just as entitled to have fun in the game as every single Survivor. No more, no less.
---

---
If you can only have fun by ruining a game for others, then sorry but I believe you should reconsider why you are playing this game, as you're being very egoistic. Remember you're talking to a Killer main, too. Please trust me when I tell you there is absolutely no need to ever camp or tunnel to secure at least a 1k. And if you can't get more than 1k without being toxic, then you're not putting enough effort into learning the game. When I was switching from being a Survivor to being a Killer main, I watched a lot of HybridPanda videos that encouraged me to play fair games as a really good and scary Killer. Maybe watching a few of his videos could showcase the kind of playstyle, and more importantly, the mindset that I mean.
---
@ u/cassidytheVword : It's situational. If people are stupid enough to heal right next to the hook without perks/items that allow them to do it before you return, by all means, go for whoever you think is best. If there's 1 gen left, get your kill. If there's 4 left, I'd go for someone I hadn't had the pleasure with yet. In your scenario? idk, depends on how they played so far I guess. If the one who'd be dead on hook is the one that I know is skilled with the flashlight or a pain in the ass during chases, I'm probably going for them. Point is, I'm not singleing out one player throughout the game until they're dead for no reason other than to secure a quick first kill, because I know how infuriating it is when you're the victim of tunneling.
---
no change my mind
---
No you're supposed to feel stressed and physically uncomfortable in this video game
---
the devs don't play video games so they don't understand how absolutely fucking retarded that sounds
---
I would place Clown lower and Myers higher
---
See I can get that, survivor is toxic. You give them a bit of bm back. But it's the ghostfaces who do it with everyone even if you didn't do anything
---
Me too l, i didn't buy his dlc.
---
I have one of those as well! I changed it earlier but kept forgetting it wasn't set to space bar anymore, so I accidentally let myself die... Still a great idea!
---
Im struggling, im playing  survivor until they fix  wake up (not using wake up i dont even have quentin) but i got to rank 6 and the teammates are STILL FUCKING MORONS WHY GOD WHY!
---
You burned his splinter offering.
---
Killer carrying speed is not faster than survivor running. It's actually a decent bit slower. Hence why you can't catch up to survivors for a hit while carrying unless you have Agitation. It's literally faster to let the survivor find it.
---
Toxic survivors do suck though, but you'll get it regardless of how often you let survivors escape though. it's an unfortunate thing you really just need to ignore. The survivors could be trying to avoid a toxic person like I explained before, and you're trying to avoid a toxic survivor escape. It never ends so don't try honestly.
---
Well that’s nice of them, now the killer won’t have an icy driveway this winter.
---
The main reason they cost money though is because of the royaltys.
---
Blame the console. Im sure your skill had nothing to do with it.
---
You sayin you wouldn't want to be picked up and whisked away by a large ample Russian woman who has a good chance of killing you?
---
Because you might just not be suicidal enough for this place then.
---
Yeah I get those people too.
---
Funny thing is , I let people have a free escape often and some of them are so dumb (or ignorant) and don't understand that I let them escape and tbag at the exit lol
---
I’m gonna be honest, you’re probably aiming at the wrong place.
---
Theres a splinter.
---
Watch Tofu’s YouTube. He has a tutorial series and a series where viewers send their matches and he reviews and shows how to improve. I’ve picked up a few little things to improve my game.
---
He’s a weak killer at rank one, the add-ons barely change that.  Survivors are getting to the point where they can counter him(as they do with any killer) and the ability to stalk while marked shouldn’t be taken away either.  Everyone is saying that he is a stealthy killer and you shouldn’t be able to use his power in a chase, look at wraith, spirit, and myers.  The killer is c tier, make the reveal more consistent and he is fine.
---
Blame the popular twitch streamer HEXY... the dude camps and tunnels like it's his job... he camps with 3 blink nurse/ruin... any op addons he chooses to camp...  once 1 or 2 gens pop hes like oh they gen rushing better "secure this kill" they're just gonna afk on gens stupid survivors... bruh go get them off the gens instead of hanging around the hook.. 
---
So many teams fall victim to his camping its rather sad.
---
You used the Bone Splinter offering. It lets you play as a DLC Killer without perks or add-ons for one match.
---
But she's got the body of a 30 year old, so it's all cool.
---
I can tell
---
well everyone on mouse and keyboard are aiming gods..
---
You burned a splinter offering which allowed you to play as leather face with no perks and no add ons
---
You deserve all my upvotes for that one. Take them.
---
*slides a yellow striped chest to you*
---
But I thought afflictions of the same type didn't stack. Can I still use both of the terror radius increasing add-ons?
---
where are the pallets on the ward map and the yard map?
---
BTW is the killer not listed on the leaderboard in game? i checked and couldn't see them as I believed Freddy was a new player and I complimented them and every other killer, even recent players list I couldn't tell i had to message everyone i met.
---
stop kink shaming people
---
With all due respect Am I supposed to aim it at his asshole???
---
Pubg ftw
---
That was the joke actually
---
They work perfectly fine. As many times as I've been blinded on PS4, seems they're just fine. But, as the killer, you can turn or look up to avoid the full effect.
---
Zoomer game genre lol
---
Entity
---
Ah, i didn't notice, i thought i will not lose the items i used for my matchets by using this
---
I’ve always been curious as to how that works. How was that addressed?
---
You can't use bother unfortunately, but theres some good starting points in brickys video. If you want i can get the link
---
Amen... he needs to practice practice
---
I watched that yesterday to be honest. Is there another video I can watch for tips?
---
Because its easier.
---
I will delete this post, i used the splinter and didn't know about that, thanks everyone for responses :)
---
Toxic GhostFaces are the worst
---
Haha this is tru I'm a red rank dumbass.
---
The game isn't tilted in any ones favor and survivors don't need a nerd we've had enough already example how killers can some how hit us through pallets hit us when we are a safe distance away from the animation but the ghost swing hits us and another one is pallets like there so rare on some maps that you can't do anything with them especially if a killer will just wait to you throw it down
---
I think he is b tier and very fun to play
---
But he is very buggy
---
You should still keep your add-ons after a Splinter is used.
---
Yeah so sorry man will start throwing games now to make enemy team happy lool
---
I would recommend this video https://youtu.be/p6QYjInzLeM this will teach you what the different tiles are and how to run them. Learn the maps and what tiles spawn in which areas so you know how to rotate through the map. If you want to watch a twitch streamer I would very highly recommend FunGoose. He always explains what he is doing and why and his goal is to educate his viewers on how to play the game. I have around 800 hours and I still watch him and always learn something new each time.
---
I guess you're one of those sociopathic people I explained. Especially if you're going to act like you know me or something lol. Even more so if you actually do follow everything I post just to shit talk me.
---
Freddy is strong only to me as i'm new and you can hear his freddy's coming to get you song" but not actually see him at all and can be striked while invisible or morid, The strongest one felt like Myers as he can stalk you from afar, I kinda wasn't able to see ghostface either until i ran right into him
---
Exactly...
---
Unless youre ink like rank 15-20, no youre not. If you apply 0 pressure to the other 3 survivors for the entire minute the dude is on a hook, theyre gonna be done and out by the time he dies. Nobody had fun, as it was 1 chase for one guy and gen simulator for the other 3, ans you just stand there doing nothing for a whole minute.
---
Its refreshing to see survivors bitching about tbagging for once lol.
---
That is a bs idea that takes the creativity out of playing with many different perks testing out dumb combos of perks and finding something that works specifically for how you play
---
I believe he did a ten minute one (normal casefile vid) and a larger one? Did you watch both? Because ik theres another build called the railgun build and thats where you maxmise the range of your shock therapy attack
---
Do you play on pc or console? Also whenever you go to a map scope it out and see where the pallets are around you.
---
Thanks for the response I will def check out Tru3Talent, I've been mostly watching HybridPanda.
---
Discordance OR bbq, ruin, pop goes the weasel, and make your choice. Bbq, surv, and nurses is way too many info perks in my opinion.
---
Could be the difference. I am on PC and it's about worthless like I said past rank 8.
---
Yeah, I guess it's easiest to assume a Quin is running the perks over other players. I'm on console and I haven't seen many twins myself in my games so I thought it was okay (it was mostly other characters running my OG perks). I'd honestly rather be moried than slugged though, I will admit. 
---
It was kind of you to apologise, we're not all mean. :(
---
Ghostface needs a buff not because he's weak, but because he's boring, you DON'T feel stealthy playing as him, the wind noise ensures this, you feel like a basic m1 killer who randomly gets 1 shots sometimes. I hope they buff his stealth EVEN IF in exchange they nerf his stalking
---
The funny thing is that all survivors are capable of running "Wake Up!" This is literally skin discrimination.
---
[removed]
---
Dwights are always either babies or assholes in my experience
---
This thread was fun yikes
---
Ever so often I'll equip NOED and think "This is great! Why am I not always using this?" 
---
... Then the salt pours in ...
---
Nah I just remember seeing your post a week ago maybe or two weeks sometime around there where everybody was like “what u talking bout”
---
Honestly the way I see it is that it is this particular games etiquette to not wiggle if your last just incase the killer is tryna help you
---
Especially if you don’t know where the hatch is
---
I dont. But hey lets keep the game the same until it dwindles into non existence. Its already dying out as we speak. And if you havent noticed the people that play this game on the survivor end are getting worse and worse.
---
Hopefully BHVR will learn a lesson on how to make a better game, instead of making it worse.
---
I'm just saying one perk isn't a counter there are many ways to counter her with prayer beads plus I assume more people run it now for free weekend to scare the new people I almost never see prayer beads spirit unless it's a event or they are running a specific build like a totem build
---
I’m not trying to be rude, but what did you think the use of the flashlight was?
---
Wake up isn't a crutch perk, it's just bugged right now
---
Recently got Ash to Prestige 2, Freddy to Prestige 3, and Ghostface already to level 50 and beyond.
---
Also, on top of this, Ghostface is just so much fun. I main Myers but Ghostface has very quickly taken that spot alongside him- I just love these stalky bois, and I love how the devs have taken this pre-existing mechanic and have made it into something unique and interesting, and above all else, fun.
---
If you get your jimmies all rustled because someone DSd you in June of 2019, the perk is not the problem, your ego is.
---
billy for enduring,trapper for brutal strength and nurses calling from nurse is a good starting build, the 4th perk can be whatever you want, bloodhound is decent it makes blood trails from survivor more noticeable.
---
Most Quentin’s are either DbD gods and/or nice dudes, I’ve noticed. However, 2 out of 3 of the most toxic players I have encountered in my numerous hours, have been Quentins.
---
Had no idea as I had yet to come across one till today.
---
Exactly. I literally just got a 3k where they gen rushed hard and I played a mean final act, but I didn't pip at all.
---
No One Escaped Death, it's a hex perk in which once all the generators are powered, the killer can instadown anyone until the totem is broken.
---
Quite
---
Imagine only playing one side then saying the games unbalanced and the other player is toxic and shit while exploiting 🙃
---
i know, that's why my post it's just, well, "made for fun"
---
I mean it's not like anyone has ever lied about not doing anything after they've been banned.
---
Only at rank reset
---
Unrelenting is actually pretty good on her if you miss a phase hit and it's a mini counter to the ever present dead hard. Discordance is strong like you said, especially with prayer beads. Personally, I like Shadowborn as the wider POV helps with phase tracking.
---
Ah actual advice for once! Thank you!
---
Oh I'm a fucking idiot downvote me pls
---
Well I hit rank 17  before rank reset sooo
---
Thanks for the straight forward advice it's quite rare!
---
Do be like that I mean almost every ghost face I've played against ends up tunneling me, just recently I was on a gen with 2 other injured survivors and I was healthy and he still picks me of the 3
---
Also you can buy perks off the shrine. It takes longer to get a build down that way but that’s another way to get perks from dlcs you don’t have.
---
i don't think i have one but i do like watching Zubat from time to time
---
Yeah, I’ve been a loyal Xbox fan boy since my early teens, but you made it seem like it was fixed by the way you worded that. Apologies.
---
My ego is non-existent and I don't directily have a problem. (Should've probably stated that) but I've noticed running it, you get chased down. And as killer you have that thought of doing it.
---
Ah ok I'll try that too
---
I know we're pretty infamous for being flashlight clickers/pallet baggers, it's pretty much why you never see me using or even keeping a flashlight. I leave that thing in the chest if I ever get one, lol. Don't want to be that stereotype.
---
No the trend just died out, same thing was happening in COD
---
you are not, it's okay if you misread it
---
Huntress is also way worse on console, you almost never see anyone play her which is a shame
---
And every single one is safe af
---
The one thing I believe causes it is the ranking system. Its bad in the sense the rank causes a more competitive mindset and any match even if casual has a direct response if you did good enough.
---
Since we are getting a progression system that gives cosmetics and permanent challenges and lore, the ranking system should just be a background process to get you the best games, or separate it to a different mode. I understand some don't like the idea since they believe the community isn't big enough but from how active people are on the Reddit and discord, and how many are passionate about ranking up I don't think that's a problem. 
---
Plus rank will be giving rewards now so comp will be insentivized still.
---
\-Doctor
---
\-anti loop abilities
---
Pick one.
---
Well the slogan is "Death is not an escape" - so I suppose we can be pretty confident in the assumption that at least the survivors are dying over and over in the Entity's trials

---
Sniper doc build with the interview tape (turns shock into a beam 20m long) and high stimulus electrode (increases range by 75%) paired with M&amp;A
---
might not be the most viable build but i personally find it one of the most fun doc builds to play
---
Wraith can't attack while cloaked.
---
Myers has no lunge and moves super slow in his stealthy Tier 1.
---
Spirit's power has a cooldown and gives off an obvious noise when used stealthily, otherwise if used during a chase I wouldn't call it stealth at that point.
---
Ghost Face has no cooldown on Night Shroud and doesn't suffer any penalties from using it other than moving slightly slower while crouched, but you don't have to crouch to use the power.
---
I don't really get these kinds of arguments of, "but this killer is like this!" when they are distinctly different in how their powers function and have said advantages/disadvantages around them for a reason.
---
flashlights are so easy to avoid tho
---
Detective's Hunch is already OP, what are you talking about?
---
This community isnt already divided?
---
I stopped playing doctor and I miss how fun he was but he's not viable once you smack into green ranks
---
Disgusting. Take my upvote
---
Killers are only jerks if they go out of their way to tunnel. Making sure someone dies before hooking a single other survivor is a pretty shitty thing to do.  However, if that survivor is being toxic PLEASE tunnel them. Flashlight stuns are NOT toxic, but clicky clicky over and over and teabagging IS toxic. Kill that person. Idc if they’re my teammate.
---
that too
---
but is it more OP than Nurse?
---
They’re probably kids who just want attention. Hope you reported them in case the Wake Up exploit is bannable.
---
They're just memes.
---
Lol @ the “I have no life” in the corner
---
I'd go after the uninjured one, that way I'll have 1 hooked survivor and 1 injured one, opposed to 1 hooked survivor and 1 healthy one
---
Oh no im on pc i havent owned an xbox, but those killers went through that and were asking for help here.
---
Looping is the only engaging part of survivor game play. Over the last year pallets have been reduced, pallet vacuums was removed, exhaustion perks that prolonged chases were nerfed, DS was changed, some of the stronger loops were nerfed, and vaulting has been messed with idk how many times now.
---
I'm sorry that it can still be frustrating some times as a killer, but you're suggesting to take away the only part of this game for survivors that isn't hold M1 and watch a loading bar.
---
If they wanted to change into a stealth game purely then they would have to rework a TON about this game considering all the perks and abilities killers have to find survivors.
---
I did watch the other one, but that add-on makes me wary. I don't know exactly where to aim the shock yet, so having such a thin shock range (despite it being longer) kind of scares me.
---
I just explained why but you want to have more.
---
It just gives you bp but you wanna have a power role perk instead.. like "self-care should also give me more, like an extra hit" or "by should protect me while I unhook". You literally want to have a power role perk, not even that but much more since BBQ is really easy to counter while having a similar effect against killer would have none
---
So you literally wanna have more power than the killer.. I ran wglf for the entirety of the event and will keep using it for long time when I wanna farm bp without feeling to be entitled to have more than it does. I don't get it why you feel to deserve more being so entitled
---
"It doesn't matter if you lose by an inch or a mile, a loss is a loss" - some smart guy or something, probably
---
The voice thing is a glitch right now, I’ve had it happen as well. The deep wound only starts to drain after they get away from you I believe. It’s not like the old feral frenzy where you go stabby stab and it drains for each hit.
---
the whole reason of putting the survivor onto the hook is to allow the entity to siphon the survivors hope
---
Actually no I more perfer to be able to run what ever the hell I want over having to have to have 1 of each type because I would prefer to be able to run stupid builds like no mother self care well make it and distortion or what ever else I want like bamboozle on the nurse I don't want to be limited in the game
---
People are sexual. We like to bring sex into the video games we are interested in. I mean, have you seen all the porn of overwatch and league of Legends?
---
The only thing end game did was make the devs nerf the fuck out of end game builds, fuck the egc, it wasn't a buff to killers at all, only dumb af survivors die to it
---
That's fair if you want to do that, but 99% of the time killers will kill you, so I'd prefer to at least have a chance to get away. I'm also not clueless though and can notice if a killer is obviously trying to give hatch.
---
All it did was nerf end game builds
---
Yeah, I’d stop playing Quentin until the bug is fixed. Too many Survivors like taking advantage of the Wake Up exploit unfortunately.
---
I can only tell porkies, or the username wouldn't check out ;) 
---
Guild wars 2 currency? Goddamnit has the entity started opening shops again ??!?

Thanks for sharing

To be honest I got the idea from Mortal Kombat X. He was a guest character and he teleported across the screen by walking to the fog.
---
Oh okay thanks for telling me this when did the voice glitch happend?
---
Yeah, Spirit might be again better than Billy because of the sounds being fixed ( because you don't need perks to counter Billy, meanwhile you are fucked without Iron Will against Spirit ), I can't believe that we need to wait so long for sounds to be fixed, just for so many perks and add-ons to become bugged and literally game breaking.
---
It’s sweet irony, especially at pallets
---
Not gonna lie... You actually scared me there...
---
I know that but I mean when I look right at him it doesn’t even make the sound effect to tell me that I’m getting him out of stalk
---
haven't encountered this since but a friend and a random in matchmaking have both told me they have today, hope this gets fixed in the next patch cus it's frustrating as hell lmao. Oddly enough all 3 times I've been told of (including my own) the killer had hex:ruin active idk if that's related to what causes the bug or just a coincidence but it makes it a hell of a lot worse
---
I've assessed the situation and discovered he has his own separate sub and I do feel many copy him in repeating the same thing over and over again which is annoying.
---
But looking through his history, he never informed anyone on that sub to upvote his posts as a brigade or invasion.
---
Seems to me he's just some young lad who got carried away in his love for pork. A perma-ban is an over-reaction, a warning or temporary ban to halt the repetition of comments would be far more fitting. He is still a contributing member of this subreddit.
---
0/10 every killer isn't in f tier, no one defeats ashy slashy
---
Ghostface and Myers are the scariest to go up against imo. But out of the two, i would probably say Myers is scarier.
---
I do agree, but I do also think that Killers moving a mere 15% faster than Survivors is bullshit.
---
No
---
Lol as solo Q I rarely feel entitled to an escape. In fact I usually just assume I'm not escaping when my teammates are being worthless. 
---
Meanwhile killer mains couldn't even just suck up their pride and let a hatch standoff go to the survivor. They had to change the game because killer mains are such babies that can't accept a 3k.
---
I'd say pretty much but also pretty decent with running forward a bit and then trying to "quick and quiet" juke into a locker
---
OOOOOH SHIT. A RAT!
---
The last update we just have, sometime last week or so.  Mine will happen one game and then the next it’ll be fine.
---
So how do you avoid getting flashed when breaking a pallet?

Hmmm your logic is oink sound. 
---
Yep. Dead by the flamethrower! (*the kids love this one*)
---
In response to the last bit and my experience playing Deathgarden: yes. I'd much rather actually be afraid of the Killer and have genuine engaging fight-or-flight gameplay as opposed to "durrr me run in circles around pallet."
---
With all that being said I realize that reworking Dead by Daylight from the ground up to "play like Deathgarden" is much easier said than done. It's a sad fact that over time the flaws in DbD's core design are really starting to show.
---
Dying s lot in the beginning is normal. One thing though because I didn't see anyone else mention it - when you say you used the flashlight like an idiot, do you mean you clicked it on and off at the Killer? Because lots of people consider this BMing, akin to tesbsgging, and it might make the Killer want to kill you quicker.
---
In general, flashlights take a lot of practice. Equip a good one, not just any one. Bad ones barely have any noticesble effect, the Killer will just be able to look away a bit to evade it. Use addons if you have to. Shine it directly at the Killer's face, steadily in one place.

I just played a game as hillbilly in the daycare center. I immediately downed a pair of survivors while a 3rd pretty much stood there. I thought it was a signal we were going to play a farm game and either way didn't want to start out that strong so I gave them a chance to heal themselves and start fresh. They proceeded to blow generators, run through windows, and drop ill timed pallets all game, so I became convinced they were all just giving me a chance to earn points. So we all had a merry time playing tag and kicking gens until it was time for them to go home. Turns out they were all level 20 basically no perks so really they were just that bad at the game. I'm glad I unintentionally gave them a chance to earn some points on one of their first matches, though. Of course, one DCed on his 2nd hook though...
---
I'm not a good enough survivor to be toxic :/

Lol I think this guy is trolling
---
Between Bloodlust and certain killers (check my flair if you want an example) having powers to cut chases down early, buffing MS will trigger Surviviors to need buffed in accordance in order to prevent a massive shift of "oh the killer saw scratch marks 2 seconds ago and now we're all on death hook".
---
You don't. Most survivors do it way too early anyway, giving them no advantage as you can see again by the time the pallet break animation is over. If they wait and time it right, then just listen out for the footsteps. They might be hard to make out at first, but it gets easier and easier, especially if they're injured. I very, very rarely come across survivors who are actually smart and are able to benefit from blinds at pallet breaks.
---
i really wonder when that hotfix is coming, i hope it's not just Ghostface... *changes*
---
To be honest I don’t think he deserves a nerf at all. I main survivor and have had no problem revealing him and have actually had some pretty good games against him. I think the devs need to wait at least a little while longer to hear from the whole community. I don’t want another Freddy.
---
The hatch is meant to be a secondary escape option not a main one. The problem is if the killer got there first or last it wouldn't matter. The outcome would be the same "Wait for someone to fuck up". It wasn't killers being babies it was people getting tired of games being stalled because both the last survivor and killer were waiting for the right moment. It took too long so with the ability to close the hatch it gave survivors 2 options now (instead of escaping through the hatch at the end) if it closed
---
If you are lucky use a key to reopen the hatch to escape as the killer wouldn't expect it, or wait near an exit gate getting ready to open it. It's a lot better for both survivors and killer because the game keeps going and can still have either outcome unlike a hatch standoff where more times than not I've had a survivor literally use the bathroom because they know the killer is just gonna wait for them to move. I've had very few hatch stand offs that ended quickly and mostly went with me patiently waiting for the right moment.
---
what add-ons were you using?
---
Well for prestiging there really is no reason besides the cosmetics and achievement you get and you can play seriously if your perk is not fullied leveled but it is kinda more difficult because they offer better benefits when fullied leveled.
---
I’ll I understand what you are saying, sorry if I was mean before, I was in an awful mood. However, I still think that maybe it should activate after you’ve been hooked and have no timer
---
The “oinker king” is dead just stop or do it on your oinkers Page
---
Is something wrong with wake up?
---
Oink oink
---
What is the Wake Up glitch? (Don’t have the perk, just want to know what it does)
---
I got teabagged for 360ing a ghostface. Is 360ing toxic or something?
---
As another doc main, you forgot the hate speech that comes afterward
---
If someone is just playing risky and is better than me, I don't tunnel. I actually try to neglect them until the end, so I don't have to bother with that and can get other kills in the meantime.
---
If someone is being cocky because they're toxic, well I can be toxic too. Only to that person though.
---
I mean plenty of point in complain, general assumptions when you purchase a game is that your are able to play the game and not have major and critical bugs interfere with the play experience, and lets not pretend this is rare, literally every update breaks some sort of mechanic in the game, if not Perks its addons, if not addons its sounds.
---
Instead of just opening the exit gate faster you do everything faster
---
He has the shock that makes it so survivors can't vault or throw a pallet down for a second
---
So yes, anti-loop abilities lol
---
Oh.
---
Why would she kill anyone? She just wants to be your friend.
---
&gt; I rarely feel entitled to an escape.
---
&gt; Meanwhile killer mains couldn't even just suck up their pride and let a hatch standoff go to the survivor.
---
Ok buddy.
---
Sounds like you were using one of her addons that makes that happen when a gen is done
---
Now imagine me, i picked the game up 2 days ago, killer only. I encounter a human pile of filth who pallet slams me in the face, flashlights and t-bags throughout a bunch of pallets (i didn't count). I catch the rat hook him and stare him down while he dies like the maggot he is, losing the game but i end up being satisfied. Who is the baddie in this scenario?
---
Yeah, hate to see classic killers like trapper be paired next to “killers” like Freddy.
---
What
---
The
---
Fuck
---
If they're outplaying me then i usually send them a GG, usually gets met with a colourful response. 
---
If its them being cocky i just wait til the perfect moment, when they screw up.
---
It does make me wonder what types of critical bugs they are needing to fix if stuff like this is considered low enough priority not to touch during QA stuff. Like how much of a mess must the games code be if we assume most of the bugs we are getting, are actually lower priority bugs they did not have time to fix.
---
correct! but from first hand experience, 3 stacks on PWYF, surv wiggles out, I get stunned, they run away, LOCKER.
---
It dosen't matter, I've tried 16 times and every time they run into a locker.
---
You say this but try running play with your food get three stacks and say that it’s fair
---
holy shit man this is good! seems slightly too similar to Plague but for the most part I like it!
---

Furtive Chase is also bugged

Don’t know wtf is going on but all the people in the purple ranks on PS4 today fucking suck! Either they are AFK, missing skill checks like crazy with no ruin or lullaby, dropping likes flies, fucking around or just standing around behind shit waiting for everyone else to die! Wtf people how did you even get to rank 6 and you haven’t done shit all match and to the afk players don’t hop into a match if you can’t play it fucks the rest of us!

Any tracking perk/game slowing perk really. Spirit is one of the lucky few that doesn’t need to worry about chase perks
---
Iri heads + infantry belt + mori
---
Damn. I wonder if someone could make some?
---
They won’t patch it for awhile or disable it look at the legion and then sloppy butcher glitch with wraith
---
Thanks I hate it!
---
how is getting another kill cancerous
---
I do also agree that my proposed base movement speed buff would have to come with nerfs to Billy/Nurse/Spirit. I'm also of firm belief that Nurse shouldn't be mandated to Blink all the time. I think all powers should be optional and you should have the ability to get down-and-dirty and play a Killer as an M1 Killer if you need to. The fact that Nurse (and Freddy) *need* to use their power to kill is a serious problem. ~~I mean, unless you play Bamboozle Nurse at Rank 20.~~
---
Fun fact, you can complete 5 generators faster than you can break every pallet in the game with brutal strength and fire up
---
Not really, The philosophy of "nerfing something way harder than they needed to" doesnt apply. Ghostface was born a crippled killer, they only fixed the bugs which were sort of a buff. Ghostface was never nerfed in any shape or form.
---
I'm only ever playing killer because Solo Queuing is hell, and I'd rather be T Bagged then Face Camped.
---
They probably could, but they wouldn't be cheap to buy. Maybe look or ask for commissions on etsy?
---
"Pathetic mortal"
---
Oh no they planned them before release meaning no matter what he is getting nerfed because they kinda already decided on it plus everything but the 8% increase of spotting zone is fine in my opinion plus some add ons are getting buffed. It's kinda win win for Survivors because spotting him is kinda buggy and some of his add ons are getting buffed.
---
^^Love it when people come together like this
---
Mories are offerings that allow the killer to execute the survivor once they've been hooked. If a dark offering doesn't flip it's probably a mori.
---
Gf can be seen through walls.  He can also get looped since his marked timer isn’t very long.
---
You have 3 minutes to get out. That’s your fault you died
---
Why? If Dbd didnt send out a message saying we cant use it then it's fair game. They weren't worried Bout it. It's been like that since the ptb... soo??
---
Shit after the first time and I’ve gone past 2 hooks and you wiggle off, you dead now!

---
They need to make most maps smaller. Some of them are so huge that only Billy can tackle them, or nurse with range add ons. They also force killers, especially slow killers into a 3 gen strat thats boring for everyone.
---
Iri Head Huntress is a classic, yes.
---
Moris are good, but what might work even better is a Black Ward. Just to let them know from the very start that you mean business. I fucking hate Black Wards.
---
I was being a sarcastic homie..
---
In that case I might only get a couple if any. Thanks for the help though!
---
I feel like you're not giving enough credit to the skill involved in looping. Like i'm not saying its the most skillful thing ever, but there is more to it than running in a circle.
---
Personally. I don't even think I would enjoy the killer side of chases if it became too easy and it was more about finding the survivors. One of the most annoying things (to me) is when you're patrolling the last 4 or 5 gens and nothing is getting done because they're off hiding somewhere too afraid to play the game.
---
To each his own I guess.
---
JAKE used CHARM!
---
It failed!
---
Yeah, I guess I can’t complain
---
I like to run his three teachables but not the chase one. then I put on deerstalker and insidious for good stalking.
---
Killer is host, therefore if you were laggy, it's was your connection
---
&gt; You don't. Most survivors do it way too early anyway, giving them no advantage as you can see again by the time the pallet break animation is over.
---
Exactly. Thats what makes it even worse. And while i usually might not have a gameplay disadvantage because of it, it pisses me off to no end that my screen tries to scorch off my retina. Thats absolute bullshit. It has no effect other than giving me discomfort. Thats why i despise it. And there is nothing i can do about it, and no skill at all required to pull it off.
---

---
I haven't seen anyone complain about being teabagged. Imo you shouldn't get butthurt at someone pressing control over and over.
---
True i couldve gotten out but i was trying to get everyone out
---
Tbh, it's pretty mild in this game. This is mainly because characters aren't disgined to be visually appealing like in cartain other popular games.
---
As a killer main, I try to be the good guy. Did someone DC one the other three at the start. Ok, let's all farm together. Did i annihilate the first three. Here is the hatch 4th guy. What do i get, TB and flash light clicked.
---
Personally I don’t think so but like I said now that a killer can tbag too you’ll probably see it a lot mainly for the fact that  a lot of survivors have used it to mock killers.
---
With the amount of backlash with the idea of a Ghostface nerf I doubt it will happen, yet again, it still could for some reason.
---
Why run insidious on a stealth killer that has built in insidious?
---
Time to go back to Jeff boi, my first love.
---
it’s good for spotting out hooks and stalking from afar. it isn’t the best but it works
---
Did they DC?
---
I don't know why. I felt like giving this the downdoot, but yet, my finger pressed the updoot
---
Ok what sane survivor would intentionally step into a bear trap at the exit gate? I’m pretty sure he was gonna try to disarm it to give himself the time xtra points, not be a friendly survivor and help out the killer. This killer did his job. The survivors decided not to leave when they had the chance. That’s on them.
---
You still hear heart beats? Since the change it's hard to hear...
---
I just stopped playing the game a few months ago because killer is so damn easy the game got boring. Survivors don't have the ability to be toxic if you play right. 
---
People who whine about toxic survivors all the time and still want survivors nerfed are just bad at the game. Killer mains got so used to complaining about survivors back when they were actually completely broken that they just never stopped.
---
I love Ghosthead so much right now but the nerf is going to hurt
---
That goes without saying. In the end, killers only gained a limited time to "appreciate" all the favouritism towards survivors, what is fair if you think in a business point of view
---
Don’t worry reporting does nothing, it’s like a fart in the wind!
---
Shockingly, no. I was very surprised. I actually got hooked and got the unhook and escaped.
---
Oh yeah mommy! Ram that metal inti my shoulder! *extremely loud moaning noises*
---
isn't a hotfix supposed to be a pretty quick thing? it's been some time since Ghostface came out and i assume that the hotfix will include the Wake Up fixes
---
or maybe it's taking this long because they don't know how to fix it lol
---
My main issue is survivors having no clue what they're talking about. 80% of the time I get called a camper I lose either 0 or 1% of my chaser medal for camping. As for tunneling, I really dont care who I hook, I go for the first one I see so it's not my fault if you get hooked thrice in a row.
---
Alright thanks
---
&gt; So I played a round of Plague and I didn't drink from corrupt pools at all the whole game.
---
You get given corrupt purge and all the pools are cleansed when survivors use all of them.
---
I don't get it either. But then again killer x survivor ship is not my thing. Call me salty survivor but I don't want any of my sweet survivors to be paired with psychos who have tunnelled and camped them to death. &gt;:(
---
Thats exactly how you are supposed to play it. Besides trying to find the totem and disable noed. Far too many braindead idiots who actively swarm a killer who can now easily oneshot them under the delusion that for whatever reason they deserve a quad escape every game, and then come to whine about noed "giving free 4k even if the killer couldnt catch a single person all game".
---
If there is noed, search the totem, if you cant find it leave. If you still try to go for the rescue with noed active, dont go around and complain that you ended up dead. Thats not noed that killed you, its your own bad play.
---
I’m a spirit main and I did manage to get her to p3 for her bloody cosmetics.
---
Outta curiosity...I know it's XBox but...what rank?
---
Except that one pallet that if you throw it down you literally cannot go anywhere else
---
Bruh killers so op
---
As a rank 1 I can confirm this is wrong. I am horrible at this game and die very quickly half of my games
---
**-3 points**
---
Why plague so low?
---
Got it. So grind only really comes into play if you're looking to prestige?
---
Real talk we just like our space to complain
---
no matter the rank, theirs always gonna be campers
---
This. Please, at that point I wish I could hang myself from the hook. There is nothing more boring than traversing the entire map and finding nobody doing anything.
---
oh he can get looped, oh ok. So for him to be viable the survivors should have no defense against him, got it.
---
From my experience, yellow rank survivors tend to have the skill level of red rank but will DC if you so much as put up even a tiny fight
---
New Map = NeverLand Ranch
---
I was reset to 18, they were 16.
---
Both. I've got him across the entire map and also done nothing while staring directly at him
---
I stopped playing since I realize this problem. I hope they fix soon otherwise I m quiting.
---
I use to be a the shape main got him to prestige 3 level 50 &amp; now my new main killer is the ghostface he is level 10 right now gonna get him to prestige 3 level 50
---
Interesting, thx
---
Prestiging grants a very minor increase to the rarity of items that appear in bloodwebs. 0.2/0.3 i believe, in te long run it can be useful at P3.
---
As for unlocking perks, the problem is to unlock a character's  3rd perk youve to unlock one of the other two first (through leveling). The shrine of secrets lets you unlock perks permanently  for shards but only has 2 perks for survivor and 2 for killer each  week.
---
 You then have to level the character to get it so the more  perks you unlock the longer it can take to get a perk to max tier as you can get perks you dont want appearing before others.
---
As for the grind. The more you play the worse it gets  with more perks unlocking and the RNG of when you get said perks so just research  what perks you want in general  and focus them while avoiding the ones you hate. For survivor just main the character  you like the most as theres no  major  need to grind multiple  survivors unless you want to or to unlock their perks.
---
For killers perks you want depends on their power/terror radius  or playstyle you go for. Huntress is great with Bbq&amp;chilli from leatherface. Youll grind more on killers as some are weak without an addon or perk to help them where they fall off
---
it’s whatever
---
You stay in that locker so your teammates with wake up can finish three gens.
---
Trust me I get, any kinda bugs can be frustrating lol
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
That would explain all the misses; only time I've ever gotten away with that was low ranks or...believe it or not BS ping...xD
---
going for 5 min games for bp farm
---
They're not gonna fix them. 90% of the Pigs add-ons are bad or don't even work and Lord knows how long they have been that way. She needs it more anyways lol, at least Legion'should add-ons work.
---
Who is in the top picture of where is it from?  Looks exactly like my lecturer at uni
---
&gt; Not really though lol
---
Except yes really.
---
Its glitched a d giving an extra 15% action speed
---
I never said that, but explain to me how he is a viable killer.  He isn’t even a stealth killer, you can hear him.  You can also reveal him through walls.
---
Nothing like having macdonalds wifi and being accused of lag switching 😂😭
---
You’re putting too much thought into this. Trolls are stupid. Their goal was to inflame you and nothing else. If you let it get under your skin, then they win.
---
What is really disappointing is that they are aware of the bug and have labeled it as a “bannable offense.” So instead of fixing their mistake, they are going to punish those who knowingly and unknowingly abused the bug.
---
Try prolonging the game if possible.
---
Her next victim is Jake and when she finishes the boys she will do the girls lol
---
How often did you use your chainsaw? Instadowns only count as one chase.
---
He was expecting snoo snoo
---
&gt; Then I didn’t camp him after he was on the hook
---
Damn, dude. Good on you for not stooping to their level.
---
Not to mention that these "toxic queues" are also longer wait times aswell as the system prioritises the "non-toxic" players which is also nice.
---
This bug/problem did not affected all the players (probably not you). They intended to low the chase music for survivors, only that. But there is a lot of sounds too much silent, something around 5% of the previous volume, not just for survivors but for killers also. This problem ruins a lot the game experience.. unplayable.
---
Yes indeed. I recently played on Red Forest (the biggest map in the game) without Whispers and killed all 3 Survivors. It took me and the last Survivor about 20 minutes before one of us found the hatch.
---
He teleports on his official game and the 8th movie and tbh it makes him scarier imo :s
---
REEEEEEEEPOST
---
My first game as Billy and I get Heddonfield.  I'm guessing that maps not exactly his strongest.
---
Oh it has. Unfortunately
---
Oink
---
There arnt hatch stand offs anymore, killer can just shut the hatch
---
I will empty my wallet for a Draugr Doctor.
---
= +4 salty people :)
---
Yeah they do have that in common but for some reason Legion gets a bad reputation for being worse than Plague even know he has built-in detection. Really the only thing Plague has over Legion is her red puke and I guess the broken status effect so that people can't instant heal.
---
Three gen strats is also something that needs to be fixed but it's really not a simple fix. I think it's a problem inherent with the game's core design as are a lot of other problems plaguing this game.
---
Even if protection hits worked as intended all the time it’d still be in a pretty shit spot. 
---
I mean having the other survivors just run into you like lemmings for free hits stops after mid purple unless they’re full cabbages or have insta-heals. 
---
It’s a pretty dead perk and most solos aren’t altruistic enough to even wait for safe unhooks let alone protection hits, but that’s anecdotal. 
---
Imagine how much worse WGLF would be if it only counted protection hits. It’s already scraping by as is.
---
This is sarcasm right?
---
Not exactly as grinding is necessary for new perks and Good add ons.
---
Decided to play Huntress for the first time ever - last daily that was left waiting.
---
1 Perk, no addons, just wanted to get the hatchet hits for the daily. 
---
HAD. SO. MUCH. FUN
---
I usually only play a couple of killers, but I had so much fun. 3 survivors escaped and I carried the 4th to the exit. Knew that I already hit my hatchets for the daily. 
---
Just a good wholesome game :)

You're making me want a fireman killer, with a flame thrower which burns survivors....
---
Maybe give him some traps though to slow the game down though.
---
And a stealth ability, make him a crouched killer for certain
---
And a red robe! *Wait*
---
But bear traps are easier to put on, than stalking one player for just a one hit kill. Still crouching is good tho.

The killer might still hear you entering the locker. Recently I was playing on the chapel map, I was inside the building on the second floor and I heard the locker door sound downstairs, I jumped down, checked the locker and found Kate.
---
I'm kind of blown away that people are trashing this killer.
---
 'oh he was clearly giving you some extra points' yes well the game isn't over till they're all out the gate, and there's no reason the killer needs to settle for a few extra points when he can get an extra kill.
---
 'well I'll never give that killer some free extra points' good, fuck off out of the game or risk getting killed. That's how it works.
---
Yep to get adept achievements as killer you have to play very efficiently, but not too efficiently, but very efficiently.
---
Make sense?
---
I think the no power on missed attack is actually a good thing, it creates a skill aspect in legion that wasn't present earlier and gives things like deadhard and 360s a viable option.

Monitor and abuse is useless on him.
---
I bet the killer must be confused as hell....
---
Yes ruin is mandatory on every killer but nurse.  Every other gen defense perk either is 90% countered by good survivors or requires you to go chase someone.  Requiring to chase requires a good killer power to end chases quickly, which all the m1 killers don’t have.  Clown can’t end them quickly but he can make chase time manageable at some loops.  I do place clown higher among the m1 killers but he lacks map pressure.

If they unhook someone when I'm close, there's absolutely no reason for me NOT to go for the just-unhooked one other than "dOn'T tUnNeL". Also I don't just ignore someone when I see them just because he was the also the last person I hooked just because "oH tHaT wOuLd Be TuNnElInG". Also I will slug them if I down one and another one was right besides him, to get 2 survivors down very close to eachother. These, by survivors, made up killer-ettiquets are nothing but salt.
---
The terms Tunneling and Slugging are used way too frequently just like the word "inting" in LoL. They are used so much to the point where even looking at the general direction of a surviver when you already hooked them once this game will cause them to say "nice tunnel asshat" after the game.

he ascended
---
Ah I couldn’t find this picture at first look. Thank you!
---
Are these available now??
---
He got super angry when I told him about this btw im friend 2
---
I main Huntress. I hate pallets and vaults so she deals with them very effectively. Also crazy across the map hits are to die for :)

From the app i use its called "not cool bro"
---
This is actually a pretty neat idea. Could give way for cosmetically upgrading other items too.
---
*Meiyars
---
I got a 4K against some SWF dickheads who were all abusing the wake up bug :)
---
This series is amazing, i am loving the thought process behind the creation. I would honestly enjoy going up against a killer that changes some of the mechanics in the game. Even if its just not looking at the killer when you have LoS
---
tunneling is when the killer completely ignores EVERYONE else to kill one person specifically. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
it is toxic. especially when other people are running in front of them but they still go for just that one person. lol
---
... Wait, did that genlock guy get the yeet?
---
[More like this.....](https://youtu.be/2P5qbcRAXVk)
---
To be fair, we already have killers similar to each other, such as Billy and Bubba.
---
Spine chill is horrible, why do people keep overrating it? It's a crutch for not having awareness that I got rid of in my first hundred hours of survivor, nothing about it is even remotely top tier unless you are playing against disgusting shit like prayer beads. Just pay attention to where the killer is and do gens, Meg.
---
Because that wouldn't defeat the purpose of the Will o' Wisp flashlight.
---
Seriously though, if you want bloodpoints become a doctor main.
---
Yet survivors complain about noed
---
Legion
---
Yeah, also you have a really shit disadvantage if you play xbox and are in a group playing, the bullshit voice recognition is really good at mistaking literally any phrase for "hey, cortana" so you either have to deal with it or turn off Cortana
---
I like to main anna, but i havnt having played in a while
---
Yeah more times than not I dont find the hatch first and opening a gate a lot of times is almost impossible against a good killer. I've been trying to get above wake up 1 but it just does not show up in my bloodweb I'm assuming because of the bug. I hope they fix it so I can try out running all end game perks.
---
I think tyde tyme on youtube says it best. The killer is a killer. Hes supposed to be opressive. Staying near a hooked survivor and tunneling can be beneficial to him. Face camping isnt and is kinda toxic but if a killer camps its the other survivors job to punish him through generator work. As someone who plays both killer isnt really fun because of the sheer toxicity of alot of survivors especially since their expectation is for the killer to “play nice” so they can have fun. The killer isnt there to play nice hes there to kill 4 survivors and hes not supposed to be noce about it. Both sides want to have fun and the fun of one side isnt fun for the other
---
They are killers they are supposed to be threatening. The game is asymetrical and supposed to favor killers. Anytime a killer pops up thats even slightly threatening survivor mains bitch and moan about nerfs. The only reason nurse has lasted so long being so good is because she takes alot of skill to play well. Remember how everyone bitched about nerfing freddy even though he was only c teir at best? Now look at him, hes a joke
---
If you’re using Nurses Calling, go with Sloppy Butcher for slowdown and perk synergy.
---
I chance sprit for billy and doctor for piggy
---
As someone who has been playing since the recent steam sale, all I see is prestiged survivor mains that teabag everything and if I get a 3-4k they shit talk after. Survivor players can be toxic as fuck. Can make the game really unenjoyable especially when you're still learning
---
I'm gonna keep this in mind and see if it works of killers with slightly different attacks
---
Tfw the Dwight mains find out about Head On
---
Survivors are either stupid or trying to get a rise out of you or both. If you 4 wipe and they complain about those tactics... who cares? If they 4 escape and they complain about those tactics... that doesn't tell you what you did wrong.
---
Those two terms are tools you apply to situations they work in if you have no better tool to use.
---
The only real feedback is when the survivor says "I was hiding between the door and locker of the shack, that's how I escaped you mid chase - it's a common killer blind spot", anything like "Camper lmao baby killer" or "You can't win without camping" is just being a troll.
---
Oh and in the usual you do poorly/they do well, gates powered have a hook, your only option is camping and the survivors have all the tools they need to win that, be it mechanical abuse to prevent a grab, mettle, dead hard, adrenaline, cleansing NOED, borrowed time, DS, distraction, body blocking, torches or a combination, so it's their fault if they fail against anything less than a leatherface.
---
REPORTED 
---
REPORTED
---
I think just cuz they were the OG characters who people actually wanted to ship
---
Thanks.
---
He seems fast too. At full health while he was chasing me I vaulted through 2 windows, threw a pallet down on him, and he still managed to attack me. It was like there were 2 of him haha.
---
If Myers is the killer that its in perfect balance, why in the red ranks nobody uses him?
---
When you are looking for survivors, puke on generators that you pass by.
---
If there are survivors hiding in the area, they will have to either wait for 30 seconds for the sickness to go away or start working on the gen and get infected.
---
Sometimes it's worth it to just m1 the survivor instead of puking on them if you are close to them and they are approaching a pallet. Hitting them and hitting them again will be faster than trying to get them sick and then hitting them.
---
When you down someone who's not sick, puke on them on the ground. Yes you can infect the person who is hooked, but it is very inconsistent as the game sometimes refuses to infect them. Puking on them while they are on the ground is much more reliable.
---
Sickness effectiveness add ons are really good, but green cooldown add on + charge speed add on combo is REALLY nice too, especially if someone clenses and you get to use your hurt juice. You can rapidfire it :D
---
If you are chasing someone and you run past a gen that is being worked on (you KNOW someone is on it), take a short moment to puke on it. The people on the gen will get infected, so you are quickly injuring people while still chasing someone.
---
Experienced survivors will probably not clense, as you are REALLY strong with your projectile attack. Even so, when they don't clense they are all 1 hit down, so you are still pretty strong. Puking makes it easier to locate the survivors too! c:
---
XD ill tell you the whole thing 
---

Supposedly he was “brigading” and “manipulating votes”
---
Cursed_Bottocks
---
*Whoops*

They are saving The Creeper for the minecraft chapter.
---

---
Wraith's Shadowborn can be nice, but there are much better perks.  
---
Trapper's Agitation and Brutal Strength, much like Shadowborn, are useful but have better replacements.
---
Me in lobby: *sees 2 claudettes*
---
Me after bring put into dying state: *sees 2 people crouching in a corner far away*
---
🙄
---
Who was the killer to make everyone DC so fast?
---
I mean in my matches I only bait if I want the other guy dead instead. Otherwise I dont wasre time on the last guy if they get out they get out.
---
I had someone send me a friend request just to go off on me because I left without saving them, even though I was dead on hook and the killer had noed, like BRUH, I’m not gonna sacrifice myself just so you get killed anyway
---
How much time do you have in game? Oh man, this might have taken ages.
---
Damn survivors really just want to be HANDED the escape that badly?
---
Perhaps if they had a little Feral Frenzy in their attacks they could win
---
But with ruin your taking a 5% loss to the gen keep in mind most killers run that too that's why I'm saying most people will gen tab aginst a spirit prayer beads especially with ruin
---
I always swing in the direction of it and back up and shake my head yes and swing again to try to tell them I’m not going to kill them
---
Sometimes they still don’t get it so I’ll have to shake my head no the whole time they try wiggling until they stop, and even then they still don’t get the memo. 
---
Then I have to get them againnnnn and take them to it agaainnnnn because they didn’t run the right way,, orrrrrr
---
they get the hatch themselves after I’m stunned from the wiggle and they find it and then they send toxic messages (/s, that rarely happens lmao)
---
Now that I think about it there are axes in the closets why the fuck don't the survivors use them?
---
I just started laughing my ass off at work and now everyone thinks is I'm crazy. The HeHe is contagious
---
If it helps you, my definitive survivor build is: Bond, Balanced Landing, Alert, and Iron Will. You should definetly try bond, I seriously think is the best survivor perk, more you use it, more uses you find it has
---
It's too hard to spot GF, so they will make it even easier, so small brain survivors can spot really easy and high ranks can feel that GF is a legion without power
---
Don't play when a new killer comes out is really the only solution to that problem.
---
Killer mains always trying to justify being toxic.
---
I don’t remember but I think it was more-so that the first person disconnected while the game was starting. Second person disconnected bc they didn’t want to play a game with only two other survivors right off the bat and third person disconnected because the first two did.
---
I too wanna know. I have no idea what "brigading and vote manipulation" means.
---
I use BBQ to find those sneaky survivors
---
Ruin, sometimes it lasts for a whole match and sometime doesn't, but it's worth the risk
---
Enduring because you will eat a lot of pallets while trying to hit this marked survivor
---
Spirit fury to make sure you'll hit this survivor that is marked
---
I dont think Dead Hard is a toxic perk
---
Dude im rank 4 right now and, well, ill show you.
---
Look at this. https://imgur.com/gallery/VQPvKRA
---
Survivor Baaabies they hate every killer thats new  
---
Survivor Baaabies they'll disconnect from you!
---
When the killer catches you
---
And you hit leave game to DC
---
Just close your eyes and make believe
---
And you can win for free!
---
I can confirm. I had this today and it does give you both the key and the ring even if you die, which I don't understand because it takes the brand new part and that is used in game.
---
The dont even try to hide the teleport in the game.
---
I didn't say it was..
---
the Entity Education video series by int3r4ct has a section of every killer video of beginner perk builds (and are also astoundingly good tutorials in general!), I'll write the 5 beginner builds down here for you, which all use the said character's teachables and then the base killer perks that aren't teachables.
---
Trapper: Whispers, Sloppy Butcher, Agitation, No-one Escapes Death
---
Wraith: Whispers, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, No-one Escapes Death
---
Hillbilly: Enduring, Whispers, Bitter Murmur, Tinkerer
---
Nurse: Nurse's Calling, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, Whispers (can swap Whispers with Unrelenting for when you're just learning nurse)
---
Huntress: Bitter Murmur, Whispers, Sloppy Butcher, Spies from the Shadows
---
God firecracker saves are so satisfying just seeing your friend drop.
---
A literal shitpost.
---
Sorry not toxic but it isnt a crutch perk like noed
---
"There's not such thing as a "personification of pussy""
---
\*Looks to your perk build\*
---
"Ok, this is actually a real pussy irl"
---
He wanted some thiccccccccc killer booty that’s what
---
I’d really only do that to somebody who was toxic to me or sandbagged their teammates lmao
---
Even to make it fair killers could not use remember me if its in their build, anything to stop the blatant cheating.
---
No One Escapes death. It’s a killer perk that allows one-shot downs after the escape gates are powered, id there is a totem left unlit on the map.
---
2+the time the hooked/dying survivor got
---
Yeah we know lol but they arent doing it
---
Nurse, spirit, wraith and now ghostface. He's more fun to play than any other killer I own and will probably end up being my main.
---
Didn't. Say. It. Was.
---
How is adrenaline toxic
---
She's taking the little girl back to the hut
---
Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, BBQ and Chili, Enduring
---
If you don't have those perks yet run Corrupt, Infectious Fright, Whispers, Noed (even though I hate it but it's your choice)\ or sloppy butcher
---
Dude I guarantee I splashed it at his face
---
I’ll second the recommendation to watch The Evil Dead. Bruce Campbell is AMAZING in his role as Ash and the movies have pretty much the perfect split between comedy and creepy (for the most part) and Ash is a complete bad ass even if it’s pure luck and goofy skill most of the time.
---
Uhhh, no.
---
It's more like "I want you to chase me enough that I actually have a chance to play the game. I don't want you up my ass immediately off the hook or preventing me a chance to get off the hook in the first place."
---
This isn't hard. And winning has nothing to do with it.
---
360 in corn is like, war crime, I'll tbag if you 360 while I'm corn blind
---
"Why do you want to know my location?"
---
"Because I want to see what your inside looks like"
---
Little or lit?
---
None of these perks are crutch perks at all.
---
Together they can be.
---
The situation I mentioned takes into account the gen regression and the pause. It is still faster than gen tapping. You can gen tap against spirit all you want since it's pretty much the only thing you can do, but she is still going to hit you every time she patrols to a gen.
---
You fool, everyone knows the only killer in S tier is Daddy Myers
---
The worst part is IIRC stalking speed addons are pointless because once you're actually "stalking-stalking" your movement speed slows to a crawl and the addons actually do NOTHING unless you're the person who walks around in stalker mode 24/7.
---
Myers has the same problem. Try Jewelry Box and Jewelry. You'll move at normal speed pretty much but once you actually begin stalking a survivor, you still slow to the same speed if you weren't running the addons. 
---
Worst part is one of the knife clips or whatever in the beta would inflict hemorrhage or mangled from a crouch hit, which would have been a way better addon than stalking movement speed. 
---
IMHO the movement speed addons for both Myers and Ghostface should be given the Tinkerer treatment and completely reworked. Or at least give them a partial resistance to the "Survivor in sight" stalking movement penalty. Maybe it shouldn't let you run at full speed, but at least make them sort of worth running.
---
How is using any perk unfair? It's literally part of the game. It was designed to be there. People need to stop being whiny bitches and just enjoy playing.
---
No. The survivor obviously walked into the trap on purpose to give the killer extra blood points and he picked him up.
---
"I want you to chase me a little bit, but not too much, but just the exact amount I want to be chased.  Thanks."
---
Yep like with NOED :/
---
I just had someone get bitchy for not dying with the rest of the team because for some reason they wanted to all go after the only survivor that got hooked. Called me a brain dead idiot. Like... who escaped and who all ran to their death?
---
Oh same. Every time.
---
If the survivor walked into the trap on purpose, then you don’t kill them. They’re trying to do a nice thing and you’re taking advantage of it.
---
is this....
---
Do your survivors heal? Lmao. So cute.
---
your not obligated to not kill them
---
Ghost Face is single handedly ruining the game. Shit isn’t even fun anymore.
---
thats just your hair saying how do you do
---
I love how finding the totem never even crosses your mind
---
Feels bad
---
Dont blame on that on piggy blame it on the player &gt;.&gt;, besides be glad you dont get a nurse in tjose matches exdee
---
Oh I get red ranks, It's just less fun.
---
You're literally forced to use certain perks to even have a chance
---
How so? Sprint burst is an exhaustion perk that you accidentally use all the time. MoM takes so much time to activate that it honestly is slightly underpowered (although it is fair now). Adrenaline is useless most of the time because you aren’t being chased or hurt and NOED cancels it anyway. Dead hard is buggy and takes skill to use well.
---
Imagine hitting your toe into the furniture and dying
---
Did someone give you shit after a game for using it? They're probably 12 years old, you shouldn't be allowed to play online games until you're over 18. Or you can pass some kind of 'how to be a human being test'.
---
I just wish there was more room for fun and different perks at higher rank, there isn't
---
Look at the post-game match on every red rank killer or survivors
---
I bet you I can list 10 perks and they're all in there
---
Don't even thin about it...
---
You won't get banned for it. This answer Peanits is saying is very passive aggressive. He saying Oh we know, and we can see whos using, and we can ban. 'How we'll handle it" being how it will get fixed.  But since there is no offical in-game announcement saying so. Of course he doesn't want to come across and say" Yeah we know, and we won't ban you for it", 
---
Hell even then, the game should simply design a system in which is addon or perks or killers become bugged, they can disable them. Kinda like how League can disable heroes if they are blatantly broken, making it impossible to pick the hero while they perform maintenance on it
---
There's no definite way to tell that you're friendly and I'd rather not have the hatch closed in my face for the umpteenth time. I'll take my chances.
---
Well if you're not retarded like that and use them properly they can be. And with noed you can counter by doing totems so let's not play victim.

people are so scummy now a days, like BRUH, im not gonna save from a face camping hag with noed, i was the only other person alive and if i had looked for the totem by the time i wouldve found it he would already be dead on hook
---
....a savage garden reference?
---
"A tier perk" that can be countered by looking away from the gen while playing prayer beads spirit. I mean, it's not the worst perk... but why would it be A tier? All the other killers it helps against are generally considered to be pretty bad.
---
Give me admin commands
---
See this is why I'm glad my keyboard's software lets me play a sound while it's toggled, so I just play [this](https://youtu.be/GhPpZDJvgOA) so I know if it's on
---
I cant stand the term "tunneling". People get so mad when a killer chases someone down and trys to get that kill. Thats the killers whole objective. Get kills and protect gens. If i see that person get unhooked or see where they run you best believe im chasing them if i see an opportunity for another quick hook. I would compare that to a killer complaining because a survivor keeps going back to the same gen or looping the same area. Having these unwritten rules kills the game. People like to act entitled and try to tell other people how to play the game. Just get over youself and enjoy the damn game! 
---
The only dick move a killer has is face camping because it kind of ruins the whole hunt chase hook hunt concept of the game.
---
why is he ruining the game? Not the player, the actuall killer
---
I guess but I personally think he's better than trapper
---
Agreed and yup all 4 disconnected without even trying first and keep seeing ''NOED is unfair'' pop up when all you have to do is cleanse totems. -.-
---
Because it's a game, have fun and get BPs
---
Games like this strive on minor roleplaying, similar to Trouble in Terrorist Town
---
THIS IS THE POWER OF MY STAND, I CAN MAKE ANYBODY DC AT MY WILL.
---
No one will get banned for it. They knew about the bug, and still released it. They have yet to still build a way to disable perks/addons/killers/survivors/items on the fly if they become bugged. Maybe with dedicated servers this will be more possible.  It sucks but i don't blame anyone for using it. They aren't going out their way to exploit like a UI bug, or invisible terrain, or making the game last forever. All people do is merely equip the perk. People who are knew and play quentin may get banned for equipping a perk he has? Yeah right 
---
But i do agree it needs to be fixed.

I dare them to do it at pallets I'm like I won't tbag you as long as you don't do it to me
---
oh no
---
Also with Jane’s perk.

Yukako?
---
Some of them you can use together I wasn't being specific but it's nice to hear someone who doesn't have an issue with noed :v
---
Curious if anybody has some additional footage.
---
Checking to see if there’s gens in here. U?
---
i dont know but it creeps the shit out of me
---
Yeah I found out the hard way, I was told to equip NOED because it was awesome and I had several games where I had to 2 hatchet escapees.  
---
Alternatively, get iridescent heads and every hatchet is its own personal NOED.
---
That moment when you can't find any typos for like a minute
---
I love what they did with the new sounds, I can finally hear
---
While there is no punishment to DC, survivors will always dictate the killer you'll play, they want easy killers that they can do the less afford possible to win (that's why people are having problems with GF) and if the killer is a bit annoying, I guess it's Dc time, so no doc to you
---
yeah I swf when i'm not playing killer and we always leave the most obvious middle of map totem so its easy to cleanse cos its out in the open. surprised more people don't do it.
---
His reach over pallets seems longer than his tiny dagger
---
Flying dwight heads??? 😂
---
That's a low tier survivor move. If I see the shape it's time to run and hide out of line of sight.

In my opinion, there's far too many outdoor maps and far too few indoor ones.

I'd recommend Spirit, her perks are really good, and she herself is a really killer, she's probably my second main, right behind Legion, but you said you weren't interested in him.

What exactly did he sell, will we ever know?

Ouch

yeah on console rn people are being pretty good about cleansing the totems, but I make sure to try and do like 2 gens and then find the totems. haven’t had noed activate in a while and it’s more fun to cleanse them and have the killer realize what crime I’ve committed
---
I think that's just generic killers for you
---
Actually, people have posted the word repost before you, therefore
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOST
---
It has for me :)
---
I've had several games where I looked at him and there was no indication I was breaking the shroud and then I have one game where he is chasing another survivor and I look at him run around the corner and I broke his shroud.....
---
I thought so but wasn’t sure
---
Yeah their focused on but dancing thinking they've won because they put down a pallet lol
---
Nothing in ghostfaces kit helps with tunneling except no tr to counter borrowed time
---
Even at high ranks they never seem to get this
---
This is per a developer response on the DBD forums, but “apparently” they have methods of tracking perk usage in order to determine bans.
---
I salute you to a job well done
---
No, 70-80% of swf are garbage. It's just another excuse for killer mains
---
All I want is the removal if his wind noise, remove it and no one gets hurt 🔫 idc if you nerf his stalk or being exposed just buff his stealth please I wanna be sneaky 😭😭😭
---
Thank you my fellow soldier. We must protect our general
---
Hoping they get a nightmare cosmeti outfit that makes him resemble Robert England or the demon from new nightmare
---
Why the fuck are you oinking? Shouldnt you be making pallet stunned angry russian noises instead?
---
It's really hilarious I got a salty survivor who called me a cheater for farming evil from them while they were camping the pallet.
---
Okay cool, I had some too of when I was playing but its nice to know it's can be reproduced.
---
Exactly. Like.. if I'm the only one that dies on a hook and my team makes it. Yay I wasted the killers time enough for them to gtfo.
---
And they say survivor mains are the salty ones lmao
---
The stealth aspect on him is so good catching injured folk.
---
Having nurses is a nice plus
---
Wow. Fuckin idiots man.
---
That's a pretty stupid idea, they clearly enjoy the game, but they just don't like one part. Everyone probably has something in the game that they're not a massive fan of. 
---
An example on the Killer side can be found in Freddy, his ability was shit and people complained about it and it eventually got reworked into making him enjoyable. 
---
People can and should talk about parts they dislike to bring more attention to it and to make the Devs pay more attention to if it is fair or not. Is it going to do anything? Probably not, but there's no harm in talking about factors people don't like.  People will be toxic, but they're going to be toxic either way
---
Putting ghostface in the same tier as hag
---
oof that INSTANT downvote lmaoooooo xD
---
The people who call you toxic are probably 10 years old. I wouldn't worry about it, just ignore the chat.
---
Part 9 JoJo confirmed?
---
Until suddenly ... Franklin's demise.
---
Please. Salt is my middle name
---
gamers rise up 😎
---
Don't know if I needed this reference, but I'm dying to find out
---
Can I asked why you ran Wake Up before it was bugged? Is there like some hidden luxury to it that I am missing or is it really just about opening the gate faster...
---
Yeah I usually do, my friends and I usually just kind of laugh at the killers that are whiny butts and we have really good conversations with some killers who actually are confident enough in themselves when they win not to cause a ruckus. I'm always uber positive post game chat no matter what happens to me :)
---
tHe dEvs deSiGned IT sO iT mUSt bE BaLAncED
---
Pussy !!!
---
This is an average day at red ranks /shrug
---
Bruh you literally just turned and he misses, not even a 360
---
I'm sure they do but not every player looks at the DBD forums. Its just a way for them to say "Hey we know, and we have the ability to ban and see who is using  perks" They won't come out and say "Hey we know its bugged, but you won't get banned". They are trying to scare people into not using the perk. Unless players are jumping through hoops to make it happen, basically circumstances that could be incredibly rare to happen. This is just "Equip a perk"
---
after breaking it he does, but while using it it lasts forever until either you attack or a survivor breaks you out of it.
---
even when not using it to stalk, having 0 TR and no red stain is decent enough to get the jump on survivors. Also keep in mind when the ability is broken, he suffers no penalties from it such as a stun or speed reduction and can continue on as normal instantly.
---
And not to mention if a survivor does break you from it, they're position is revealed to you (which is getting buffed in the hotfix as well).
---
I do want to note, that I like all this about him and hope it stays this way.
---
If i was good with nurse i would
---
Wow what a late meme 
---
MoM is literally a bottom tier survivor perk now.
---
Wheres my goddamn piggy skin
---
My blind salt aside I keep forgetting how good it feels to main Nurse. I swear to God I play some of these M1 killers and I'm reminded why this game is Survivior sided. 
---
I Mean I've never disputed that it was, but Jesus Christ. My poor Ghosty-goo...and he's even getting nerfed too!
---
This happens to me too, don't know if there's any fixes.
---
If they enjoy the game and they were being adults about it they wouldn't be toxic arseholes to other players. You're justifying people being shitty to others because one aspect of a game might be slightly more advantageous.
---
There's a difference between making a suggestion that you feel would improve a game and being a massive dick and whining.
---
She's Ez just hold M2 M2 M1 /s
---
Same it gives me more reason to cleanse them I think it's fine.
---
Robert is the only one that matters
---
Obligatiory r/dbdgonewild tag
---
Let me explain, im on consol
---
It's just one-way from what I can tell, since mousewheel down and mousewheel up count as separate buttons.
---
Well they're still complaining about it so
---
There's a splash screen they can add it to in game.  They literally did that for threatening to ban people for "just equipping" add-ons for legion that were broken.
---
Platform PC  
---
Ingame  
---
Survivor who left exit gates didn't go to endgame screen instead was able to walk and crawl around behind exit gate.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/CiIw8ga](https://imgur.com/a/CiIw8ga)  
---
Should be given escape  
---
Able to move behind exit gate 
---
1 for 1
---
Oh shit yeah....
---
Play Billy then I hear he's broken
---
All survivor perks that aren't absolute dog shit are toxic, didn't you know?
---
Every survivor perk should be nerfed to be Left Behind tier.
---
I know. Never had I been so lucky.
---
True but the nightmare demon had a suck design with the trench coat and bio mechanical glove
---
Thanks for your interest in my post
---
No, what I was saying was the people are going to be Toxic anyway, I basically only play killer and I have had toxic players yell at me even when I play shit perks. 
---
Just because I said people should complain about parts they dislike doesn't mean I'm saying being toxic is okay.
---
🎣
---
This is the most likely answer
---
Yeah it’s really not hard to reveal him. Not sure why he’s getting nerfed. I’m not even a red rank survivor I stay in the Greens generally. Takes a while to get use to but once you do it’s not too hard. I’m gonna wait to see how he performs after their next update before I purchase him.
---
You can say that again! It’s been a tunnel fest on PS4 today, doesn’t matter who the killer is and everyone is running DS but it only works if the killer downs you and picks you up, but most just tunnel you and let you sit for a min then pick you up. But seriously the tunneling for the last few days has been crazy stupid abused!
---
Because in the red ranks everyone has to use strong killers
---
Isn’t the Huntress free in the first place ?
---
you are either a nurse main, or you have never been to red ranks
---
I hope you are right. The last thing this game needs is a decline in player count.
---
Which is pretty stupid, it doesn't feel like a struggle, it just feels... annoying. Changing it to my mouse scroll wheel makes it less annoying but... yeah.
---
Not to mention those times a lag spike makes you miss a struggle moment and die with plenty of time left.
---
Wake Up is completely bugged, and now applies it’s 15% speed increase to everything, not just opening exit gates. Gen Repair, Healing, Sabotage, etc.
---
It's causing balancing issues when some people can't hear the killer and others can.
---
That, or honestly, at that point, you're probably worth more points to him if you just DC as well at that point.
---
When you downvote any post that generates hatred on either side: “Boy, this reddit sure is biased” 
---
Nah man, it just doesn’t like assholes.
---
I know right anything but the remake :( He would have some cool body-horror type cosmetics too
---
Even then its like, some players just click right through it. Just disable the perk, thats all. Like how League of Legend/Overwatch can disable heroes that are broken. That way banning players never needs to become a thing for things like this. It becomes more of a issue of how early they can catch it.
---
he is
---
Enjoy low ranks and having time to do that while you can. This will be a very different game once you hit purples and reds especially. Have fun with it!
---
Then what the fuck is your post
---
Doing gens is toxic
---
beginners should use either the moldy or shiny electrode
---
high stimulus will take too long to charge and i personally think it’s garbage if you ever want to play around pallets 
---
i’m just now using no range addons and i’ve played him for hours upon hours because i focus more on pallets than i do shocking in chase (otherwise i use moldy)
---
restraint is very good for tracking but restraint class ii has no use when the survivor aura only lasts for 1 second (so use class iii instead! carter’s notes’ doctor auras last way too long)
---
i don’t recommend touching calm unless you’re running a terror radius based build and order is great in most cases esp with 3 genning
---
discipline is good for corn maps/immersed maps/slugging
---
don’t bother with obedience just run iri king instead 
---
stbfl on him is VERY fun as well
---
Yes, and you can't play DBD online without gold.
---
You just said people should complain about parts they dislike. Complaining is not making a suggestion, plus maybe the Devs designed it to be overpowered to balance out other parts of the game.
---
We're basically arguing and agreeing with each other, yes make suggestions or start a discussion about aspects of the game, but don't be a fucking dick about it is my point.
---
Pig. She's p3 50 and during the blood hunt I got to finish maxing out every perk on her.
---
Oh shit! A HEX!
---
FREE GLEN0CK
---
Already a billy main i gotcha. Hows he broken tho?
---
Most of the people playing are using ghost face 90% and being straight scumbags with him. Dude is super Good killer and people are just playing as dirty as you can with him. Had a few camp me today with bbq, murmur, insidious, ect and it’s like why? GF can take a 4 man team down in a matter of minutes silently and you gonna camp and don’t forget the constant tunneling off the hook. PS4 has been a shit show today playing as survivor!
---
Eh broken isn't the correct term. He's just....strong
---
Well to be fair their both robert but i like regular freddy more. If anything they should give him the syringe glove
---
Nah we need more indoor maps asap
---
Yeah. I just don't like to. I mean usually people hate DCs. I can't win haha.
---
Sadly I think they were just talking about layouts based on what they showed. Was so hyped until I heard that
---
Defending Ghosty-goo, but not Freddy :(
---
Oh yeah hes pretty much our version of nurse
---
My name is literally Claudette
---
BRB need to change my name for leatherfag
---
;-;
---
Btw, this was the same guy that never readied up in the lobby (even after someone left the lobby at the 16 second mark), wasted one of the safest pallets in the game before a single gen popped, and (as shown) unhooked somebody right in front of me WHILE I was revving up my chainsaw.
---
4 = trash killer. Simple maths
---
That sounds like it would be a funny thing to have
---
A lot of SWF groups body block and teabag.
---
Defend Freddy too! Defend all the low tiers from these bullies!!!
---
Nurse mains! Be as toxic as possible in defense of our low tiers.
---
True
---
SWF is just the crutch that bad survivors use. Killers don’t get trolled by solo queues; those survivors are too busy playing the game as it was intended.
---
Itd be great
---
The green goblin from spiderman I think?
---
add people who use franks mixtape and moonwalk as legion, pre rework
---
Please be the bee
---
I’m a bit new to killer but I love hillbilly and Myers, though I prefer Hillbilly as he’s more consistent
---
Everybody is different, as far as their game style. I main both survivor and killer, and as a survivor it’s really just a guessing game against her, can’t really do much without luck. When playing as spirit, you have that to your advantage, and of course the typical build of perks consisting of ruin, bbq and chilli, no Ed, and whatever it’s just a super easy game as her easy 4K. It’s just an opinion of course I may be wrong.
---
I know it’s the Plague, but it’s lowkey lookin so hot, I may have found my new waifu
---
Complaining about Adrenaline and Dead Hard in 2019. Lmao.
---
Ohhhh he might be me.
---
it’s because they are killers. it is their job to kill you, hence the name
---
Spies,  hex: the third seal, pgtw, bbq
---
Yeah, but it's player issues, not GF problem, also GF is really weak, against good teams he can't even get 2k tunneling. GF is fun to play as and fun to play against, just avoid toxic killers (person) the same way you avoid toxic survivors.
---
Tip: Just because most clauds and megs are walking uraniun of extreme toxicity, doesn't mean that clauds and megs are destroying this game.
---
I mostly played billy, but by the time I quit the game I'd regularly went back to weaker killers and still got 4k's every game. Again minus giving hatch, which I did most games. Right before I quit I was playing Freddy and even then I was doing well. They buffed killers enough to the point that I had to play killers like trapper and Freddy just for there to be anything close to a challenge. And yes I was always at rank 1, unless it was rank reset.
---
Although Freddy got more comical and cartooni as the series went on that was one kf the better moments.
---
Granted the chick he took down was stupid but still it was funny regardless.
---
JUST KIDDING I DIDNT DO THAT
---
I was "respectable" legion.
---
Yea it’s free but not advertised at all and doesn’t come with the game download it’s a separate thing you wouldn’t notice unless you went to the individual add ones in the store. No one in my group knew nor did some others so I figured I’d just make a psa.
---
I run into plenty shapes that save their tier 3 for the endgame. This is actually legitimate method of dealing with it lol
---
"There is no God, only me"
---
- Ghostface 2019
---
ok mr “i just got called out so i have to say i baited the person making a point!”
---
Question for you then. I body block when I’m with strangers bc I don’t want them to get tunneled. Is that toxic? Or is it just the act of teabsgging that is unnecessarily mean. Secondly, just because “many” of SWF teabag... does that “inherently make all SWF toxic” ;) genuine questions here, I appreciate your response!!
---
Just think it used to be brighter. It used to be a pure white screen
---
If you read the post-game chat, they're all allegedly the last image.
---
What does noed mean?
---
my code ain't workin either
---
Pretty much.
---
Mori(the red one) and instaheal should not exist
---
No I was saying you were baiting me to respond, what did I get called out on, the fact that I don't think people should be toxic dicks about a game?
---
I think you have to wait for the test to start.
---
He should have voice line imo
---
because this subreddit is full of assholes who don’t care about personal achievements
---
It's on sale for $10.
---
"oH My gOD sTOp WhIte wAshIng" no but for real they will be labeled as racist if they do that
---
"That sucks, can't relate"
---
With how fast gens go nowadays? Absolutely not lol. 
---
I use it on every killer except Billy and Nurse, because I'm pretty much forced to.
---
No one is complaining they're things to help against noed..
---
ahh fuck he's got me there REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
The cult lives on
---
$7.84 i am so dam close
---
Well if you didn't reply in salt you'd know they're things to help against noed..
---
because the devs are always right? oh honey
---
The ol' domino effect.
---
You're saying people should disconnect to counter Noed?
---
thought I was the only one that thought Keanu Reeves sucks.
---
I will become another Keanu Reeves Sucks :))
---
No I'm saying they do even though they have things that would help. Jesus christ.
---
Yo,
---
Encountered this today, absolutely crippled me during the match.
---
You cannot depip below 15 after passing it. The only way to go below rank 15 after passing it is from rank reset.
---
It's their game, they can make it however they want, so yeah they are always right, if you don't like what they make, you don't have to play it. Or better still, if you really know better than them, make you're own game.
---
So how does adrenaline help when Noed is triggered after adrenaline is triggered?
---
“I want the opportunity to be chased more than once.” That’s literally it.
---
It's their game not yours.
---
You've earned yourself a downvote and shame upon your name
---
It would make long wait times even longer though :/
---
where did i say it was my game

heres a tip - with firecrackers, you can guarantee a killer blind by allowing the killer to hit you before you drop it (if youre fully healed). the hit slows them down so that they cant look away from the firecrackers before they go off :)
---
It happens to me a lot too (almost always when I'm playing survivor). Maybe 1 out of every 5 or 6 games I get disconnected from everyone at the loading screen.
---
That's a perk many killers could say is ''unfair'' but they don't because they're not salty losers
---
All they need to do is make SWF not award bloodpoints or rank and the game will be balanced again.
---
just because you make something makes it objectively good or correct? guess i’ll be maining omega blink nurse and running an ebony every game because that’s fair and balanced right?

Pig, Freddy, and Spirit are my mains. Really enjoying Ghostface so far. Pig and Freddy are P3, the others are not.
---
Everyone says Ruin is essential. I say it isn't for a perfect usually goes out within 1-2 minutes of the game starting. I prefer perks that you can use throughout the match and don't just go away.
---
I didn't say you did 'citation needed'. I'm stating it's their game not yours so whatever they chose to do is final.
---
It is also harsh on survivors at red ranks. I swear I can do everything and still barely safety pip.
---
Downvoting because I told the truth smh
---
Asshat shithead
---
yeah, because you were rank 20. wait til you get to red ranks, and play a killer besides nurse
---
Keanu is a god amongst men. You fear his glory
---
What's wrong with SB on Wraith?
---
does that make it a smart decision? does it make it a good one? should they do it? 
---
the devs are human and are going to make mistakes. they are not on a pedestal because they made the game. stupid decisions CAN and WILL happen and should be taken responsibility for
---
They complain about plenty of perks. So you've said your post was about things helpful against Noed, but two of the elements of your post aren't. What about a flashlight, killers complain about those all the time?
---
I main killer and there have been a bunch of toxic pigs when I play survivor. No, Amanda! Just because you can crouch stealth doesn't mean you post up on a hooked survivor. You came with a specific perk (Make Your Choice) to take advantage of altruistic survivors. Stealth characters should really take advantage of their ability to search out for additional survivors. More points are earned for multiple hooks.
---
I want to believe you, but I couldn't find any VOD pre-Ghostface of him using it when I made that post. I didn't check all of them so I'll have to take your word for it. But I still think he should stop using it even if he used it beforehand.
---
I use to have it when I didn’t have map pressure, but I got better overtime and now I don’t need it nor do i miss it.
---
Because of lobby dodging? I’m not sure that killers would want to automatically dodge a lobby if a single perk got eliminated
---
I'm constantly DC from even loading into a lobby, saying that I need internet connection to play which I obviously do have.  
---
And then when I *do* find a match as survivor, during the second stage of the sacrifice my character would literally just give up randomly during the struggle phase even though I was spamming X.  
---
BHVR fucked up big time.
---
Keanu is an overused meme, while he is a good person and doesn't suck imo, the meme is old and overused and really needs to calm down because people are starting to get sick of it.
---
It's not a mistake though it's a legit perk and always has been there's ways to counter it but you'd rather sit and cry about it like they're gonna change it when it doesn't need to be.
---
Doctor and I’m trying to learn Spirit. None of them are prestiged (I don’t want the bloody clothing and I already have good perks, add-ons, and offerings on them). I’ll only prestige the licensed Killers and Survivors because they don’t have cosmetics aside from the bloody ones (except for Pig, Tapp, and Ghostface).
---
So if you made out with someone with that mask on, would it be anal or oral?
---
*^^insert ^^random ^^Star ^^Wars ^^footage*
---
Hold on. Movement speed?! This perk buffs the Survivor’s fucking MOVEMENT SPEED?! Holy shit this is worse than I thought. We need that hotfix ASAP.
---
This isn't loving him as a meme. The only celebrity I love and actively root for. He is glorious
---
Dude you need to chill out and stop getting sweaty over a fucking picture. And no once again stop assuming. Flashlights can help against noed and getting to the exit on top of cleansing totems and not being a whiny bitch about it.
---
i’m only talking about mom here and i just moried the ash every game because fuck you for running it
---
if you thought old mom was fair hooooo boy you’ve got some major bias and NO i play both sides
---
by your logic i can be a toxic shithead just like these guys bEcAusE itS lEgIT and iTs in thR gAMe REEEEEEE
---
THANK YOU! FINALLY SOMEONE NOT BRAIN DEAD! I literally verse groups of Twitches, people who have played 1000s of hours and legacy survivors and I'm around rank 10
---
Wtf why my pee pee so hard
---
The same dumbasses that say NOED rewards you for losing don't have dick to say about the hatch mechanic in it's entirety. 
---
Wonder why.
---
It’s not toxic if it’s that type of situation in my opinion. If survivors are teabagging after they stun, flash, or escape then it’s safe to say they’re being toxic.
---
I'm not talking about mom I thought you were on about noed nvm I don't care about ash he can die :l
---
That's not what I said, I never said anything devs make is good, I said that they're right because it's their game, they can make it utterly shite if they like, and then people won't play the game, it's in their best interests to make it 'good', but that's down to their discretion on what they perceive is good or balanced. Not you or some toxic 12 year old who enjoys calling other people an arsehole for playing a game.
---
And yeah you can use whatever loadout is available to you, maybe you'll win the majority of matches, maybe some skilled survivor/s will know a way to combat that build and make you question whether it is as overpowered as it first seemed, or maybe the Devs will monitor that build and make changes if they see fit. Either way those can all be done without being a garbage human being.
---
Pgtw?
---
Honestly I think ghost face is pretty mediocre, it could be a good killer if the fix some issues and give him a little change, but like most cases no mobility never going to be a top killer he’s B/C as some games he seems good and the next game you could be detected from a large distance. Would be nice if they made him strong though sick of playing against nurse and insta billy almost every game  at higher ranks
---
Pretty sure that's Willem DeFoe as Norman Osborne.
---
Idk, today I went against an SWF team who flashlight saved the first two times I picked someone up, then body blocked until the other was off, then flashlight saved then body blocked. In one game. It had a happy ending though, as they all died from letting me get off hits.
---
Dang sad prestige him the og killer
---
yeah no i ran noed out of spite until that shit was deleted BECAUSE ITS FAIR AND FUN and definitely NOT A CRUTCH WHATSOEVER
---
I'm currently at Rank 4, and I'll say this.
---
He's good, but he can easily be overwhelmed. Bring Ruin.
---
Then outlive them. You only have to survive long enough to be the last survivor to get the hatch.
---
Lol, what am I assuming? I said killers complain about flashlights just as much as survivors complain about Noed, which is true. You're saying I'm getting sweaty over this picture, however you took the time to make said picture after being annoyed people called you trash for using Noed. Now it seems you're getting annoyed yourself because the "picture" isn't as well received as you were hoping.
---
The holes in your argument are quite easy to exploit for my amusement, so please continue, I do enjoy procrastinating on reddit.
---
It wouldn't work because some survivors would just report killers who killed them and some killers would report survivors who they didn't get to kill
---
That’s such a cute team. “Brought you another one”
---
That's not why it's in the picture but you're assuming it is..
---
He's easily genrushed. That's his primary counter.
---
So long as your team are doing their job and doing gens, he's easily beat.
---
XD gender current year funny maymay
---
The Legion i see nice
---
Most. But SWF is for casuals so.
---
I never said the flashlight was in the picture because killers complain about it, did I?
---
Use spine chill if its too hard for you.
---
Honestly people complaining about it just makes me want to use it more to piss them off :/
---
Who knew that Dwight main’s could be scary
---
*turns out it's yoink spirit*
---
Then why say it..
---
Might wanna change that "discussion" tag to "salt", bud.
---
I'm regretting is personally cause my preferred character is taking forever to get certain perks that makes me want to play them.
---
just because it’s their game doesn’t make them right i literally don’t know how you don’t get this
---
and yeah? i’m a proud 12 year old for calling people out on their bullshit
---
No, don't listen to survivors that try to convince you otherwise. Almost all the Killers need it to do well.
---
At high ranks you need it alot of the time. But no, its not cheap.
---
I'd be mad too if I got my shit pushed in that deep.
---
Get fucked, "O".
---
i never run it unless i know it’s a bunch of tryhards or it’s exploiters i’ve seen in my games before
---
So would the Legion bug. Every Legion I run into exploiting blade add-ons (paired woth thana and sloppy) pretends to be completely oblivious about it when I confront them post-chat
---
That’s pretty stupid. What if people aren’t aware of the bugs? I know I wasn’t at first. I use wake up a lot and I I noticed something was odd about the speed (especially vault speed) but it wasn’t til a few days later I found out from a friend.There was never an announcement as far as I know.
---
Either way, still gonna use it. It’s my endgame go to perk. If I get banned because they fucked up their own game, then whatever.
---
Don't know if this goes against the second rule but I got a good laugh about the comments on the vibrator post from a few days back.   
---
And the Ghostface who 3K everyone except my friend who watched him moonwalk teabag at the gate. Good game, sir.
---
The kind of people to use it in the first place won’t stop til it’s patched
---
I mean, it's a discussion. I'm not very salty, it's funny that people expect this shit.
---
it's like any sub reddit the mods let the power get to thier brain
---
Using any perk in game is never a "cheap" move, regardless of what the shitters here will tell you.
---
That said, I swear by Ruin. You don't pick Ruin to last you the entire match, you pick it to help you establish early momentum in your favor. If Ruin lasts to your first hook, it's more than done it's job. Anything extra is just gravy.
---
I don't really see what can be discussed. Yeah, survivors can be entitled dipshits. In other news, bears shit in the woods.
---
Played with Ohtofu a bit ago and encountered this exact situation 
---
I’m sorry my bald friend
---
I’m high ranks that 1-2 minutes is crucial to getting pressure
---
Mhmm. Almost every game I get a survivor either dc's or kills themselves on hook. Basically a part of their instinct at this point.
---
They can cleanse the totems to counter it anyway so they can't even complain. But anyway it's only logical to add strong perks if you feel they're gonna be really tough
---
Ugh yes, one match the killer decided to farm with me and my friends and when we maxed out as much as we could with them we went to work on some gens only to find the random fucking 99% ALL the gens and we got jack for objectives.
---
Say what? That killers complain about flashlights?
---
Well young one, because you said that killers could complain about adrenaline, but don't because "they're not salty losers", however they DO complain about many survivor things, one such example, that you also included in your post, was a flashlight. Starting to make sense now, or do I need yo slow down?

Well I have ruin, BBQ and nurses , but the last one honestly depends how I feel , I think he’s awesome 👏
---
Well I don't so there's no point in telling me..
---
U don't mind instinct killing on hook interestingly. That disconnecting shit is the pussiest shit in the world, as a killer and survivor.
---
That shit happened to me the other day, but it backfired on the Killer [like a motherfucker](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c203ov/sweet_dreams_are_made_of_keys_who_am_i_to_disagree/)!
---
Pretty good set up, mine is the same, but my last slot tends to be STBFL.
---
I love playing as him, but good survivors can knock him on his ass if they find Ruin early
---
He is not a god. He's fuckin overrated
---
I don't think the mori is as bad. It'll help you get a 4K, that's for sure, but if you're getting less hooks you aren't going to rank up. There's not much of a reward for using it.
---
Not all survivors admit it so it's half bait and half I don't want to see this shit anymore.
---
Because we'll be stuck in this hell for another 20 minutes if we don't directly throw them on the hatch. 
---
Seriously, I had a Dwight for kept locker hoping when everyone was dead, didn't work the gens, didn't find the hatch and me just hunting him for 40 minutes. By time I found him, I was so fucking pissed off, I slugged him and face camped him since I was playing as the pig. I had even gone to the bathroom while I waited for him to leave. This was pre-end game so I had no choice but to wait for him.
---
And then he had the nerve to whine about it.
---
Insta saw billy.
---
Is it cheap? No
---
Does it represent a broken game?  Yes...
---
If every Killer is all but required to run a specific perk to have a chance then it’s a bad mechanic.
---
It should either be a static effect always in play or the game should be rebalanced another way so that it’s not mandatory.
---
Over rated? How? He's a great person in great movies.
---
Maybe not, but it doesn't stop people from doing it anyway lol
---
yes my thoughts exactly
---
Literally nobody likes salty survivors, dude.
---
Why do you think salty survivors don't admit to it?
---
Angrypug
---
Not that necessarily, although it could be a possibility. People really love their BBQ. No, when i find a lobby i just wanna get in the game already, and this would add another time consuming step.
---
it used to make blood spurt from the survivor the whole match i think.
---
He’s definitely not bad, he’s a b tier killer with the likes of clown and huntress. At least that’s what I got from playing him, no reason to pick him over nurse, billy  and the spirit but that’s just my opinion as I really like the mobility. If a killer lacks mobility I tend to instantly put them down the tier list

---
Yes but breakdown is showing the killers aura to yourself, adding it to WGLF would show it to the other survivor instead when you rescue them.
---
When I hear nurse on console, I know I'm in for an easy match. Cleanse all the totems, search all the chests!
---
Oh? But you were grouping all survivors together were you not? You were grouping all killers together too. You said "THEY'RE not salty losers" not "I'm not a salty loser".
---
They were trying to let you farm points, dick
---
I just had a game where I played as survovor. Two people disconnected on a plague with pink stuff. Annoying, yes, but why leave? They told me the plague was try harding cause she had ruin and that they don't have to cater to killers. What? Wtf? Small brain time.
---
Wouldn't really be possible as there are 4 survivors so how would 1 perk be pick n voting couldn't happen cause each survivor could vote for their own perk n make it a draw n if it was randomly picked between them it wouldn't be fair as the killer got the perk they wanted gone unlike the 3 other survivors who didn't
---
If they made where each survivor get there guarantee perk ban it wouldnt be fair to the killer who lost 4 perks but only got to pick 1 n if the killer gets 4 bans to match the survivor it would be broken as both sides could ban the top 4 perks on both sides
---
There are many reasons why something like this could never work
---
That’s a fair point. Especially with the current matchmaking, even finding a lobby can take a very long time
---
Why? Because it's a bad look for the game, the community, a Fog Whisperer, and it degrades the quality of games. Pretty simple. Of course he's free to do what he wants and continue promoting things that degrade the quality of the game, but we're also free to do what we want and question him for doing so.
---
A) How does this excuse abusing a bug? 
---
B) See A.
---
C) See A. Also see Youtubers that have gotten banned for doing the same thing for the purpose of calling attention to more gamebreaking bugs. Also pretty disingenuous since most people are running it for an unfair advantage, not for this reason.
---
D) Don't disagree here, I didn't really say anything about Peanits' statement though.
---
I'm going to quote from your other reply rather than reply to it separately:
---
&gt;its not his problem if the game devs knew about this bug, and released it broken. Also not his problem if they don't have a way to disable usage of it. 
---
Sure it's "not his problem" to fix. I never said he was the reason the bug exists. But there's a reason most other popular survivor streamers are refusing to openly abuse an exploit: it's a bad look for a Fog Whisperer and a supposed community leader. I've seen streamers that are Pug's friends openly trashtalking Wake Up users because it's pretty indefensible and they know no one is running it with good intentions once they learn of the bug.
---
On that note, let's be real, every Twitch chatter that learns of this bug is abusing it for an advantage, not to be a white hat trying to call attention to the devs.
---
&gt;member that one huge exploit, the one that allowed players to equip quad perks, or change cosmetics/powers that would usually bug out. For instance myers with just a floating head? That was in the game forever, and they only fixed it, once they realized it was an issue. (Many players using it)
---
Yes, this also happened with IamCows uploading videos with similarly gamebreaking bugs with the stated purpose of alerting the devs so they fix the bugs. They fixed the bugs, but they also banned him temporarily for doing that, so I'm not sure how that bodes well here.
---
Each survivor has 1 vote and the perk that gets majority vote would be chosen. Only one perk is banned for either side
---
And he looks kinda like a Dwight
---
What post
---
On xbox, I have run into maybe like....7 disconnecting killers ever. I know it happens, im not saying it doesn't but it happens as survivor far too often. I can't wait until there are punishments for leaving.
---
Good luck trying to explain that to edgy teenagers
---
Like I said each survivor could pick a different perk or if it's 3 to 1/2-1-1 it wouldn't be fair to that 1/2 survivors as they didn't get a ban like the other's
---
Yea but with the hatch that's less you failing more the rest of your team. Can you imagine doing 3 gens all by yourself and unhooking your teammates and they still all die and then there's no hatch?
---
You are the reason the community suffers from toxicity issues
---
I still do this
---
Coming from a  survivor main side, I see why survivors play toxic. But truth is, it you're tired of getting camped its completely your fault. Not my fault you teabagged me at every pallet.
---
did you seriously use a star wars edit of this meme
---
Why is the Driver's License add-on way better than "Ghost Face Caught On Tape"?
---
Okay, this is my last attempt to make you see. Let's say you are a game dev, you make the game you want to make, it's your idea of what you wanted to make. Some random person or several people say they don't like the game or an aspect of the game, does that mean that you're wrong? No, because you made them game you wanted, with the content that you wanted. Does it make it a good game, maybe, maybe not. You are classing right and good as the same thing. You're saying that because you personally feel aspects of the game are not balanced, the Devs are wrong. Which in itself doesn't make sense because when you're creating media of any kind, there is no such thing as wrong. When death stranding comes out, there's going to be a lot of people who don't like it, but is hideo kojima going to read Reddit posts and think he's wrong for making his vision? Even if 99% of people hate the game, he's just going to say, you don't get it.
---
A game Dev can make a truly awful game, but if that's what they decide to make, who are you to say it's wrong, you can say it's bad, and you can not play it or buy it in the first place, but you can't just tell the Devs to make it something else, it's theirs to do with however they want.
---
Despite that being a problem. I think you can fix your gameplay on looping. When you double back try not take a long way to double back. The long way gives killer more time and it’s more easy to catch you. 
---
Of course in this video you weren’t at fault but just a tip to help improve you.
---
SB used to cause a lot of framerate issues on certain people's setups and consoles.
---
It’s not hate to realise that a killer is bad.
---
I feel like I wouldn’t feel it was unfair if I was in the minority of the voting. Unless I voted to remove Spirit Fury and the other 3 voted for Monstrous Shrine
---
Also, and yeah? Isn't a question.
---
I like to use the other hidden offerings just to fuck with survivors.
---
Make NOED spawn a lit totem like the other Hex perks and remove the haste status (and change the tiers to the next 2/3/4 survivors you hit be downed in one hit.
---
It makes me kind of sad that someone would think that using it is a cheap move.
---
Eh, I’m gonna continue to use wake up, guess that means I’m an asshole. 
---
To be fair though, I used it before it was broken, so.
---
Just like when I did the two killer glitch, I did it too. A lot.
---
Idk why people get so upset over it, it’s a game. I love tinkering with broken mechanics/exploits, and in all honesty, it’s the devs fault, not mine.
---
It’s not even to be toxic, I just love playing with broken mechanics that I know I’ll never have the chance to play with again once it’s patched.
---
Still takes like 9 seconds though.
---
I know you didn't camp. Campers don't use pgtw.
---
That's great if you play Nurse/Billy, but if you're in high ranks and play against survivors that know how to loop and know how to pound gens out, then you severely underestimate how important even an extra 30 seconds to find/hook a survivor means.
---
The outrage is not weird. It's merited.
---
this does put a smile on my face
---
This thing happened all the time on console release and they fixed it and broke it again a couple of times and it seems to be broken once again
---
Honestly Idk but no doubt in my mind no one will be banned for using a perk they did nothing to sloppy and tinker so it would be sorta unfair if they did with wake up. They have to give a warning first
---
Alright I can’t state my opinion on if he’s good or bad. But remember he’s been out for maybe a week now? So people are still learning how to play against him. It doesn’t mean he’s amazing there’s just a learning curve survivors have to do and that comes with experience vs that killer. 
---
So I say give it another week or so when everyone’s comfortable with him, especially after the nerf.
---
Oceania may not have the most players, but I'm thankful to play in it when I hear of people having to deal with this elsewhere. In my experience it's been mostly positive.
---
Welcome to DBD. Have fun!
---
I like it, it’s convenient for me and my SWF. Especially for end game collapse
---
They could do whatever they want as long as they don’t change the mask
---
Not enough pallets, map needs a rework.
---
You're salty af I can't be arsed to carry this on it's boring. Bye.
---
Yes it would make you squirt blood out continuously, even after mending to full health. Then if everyone was squirting out, it would drop the the FPS to hardly anything and lag the game out, forcing the match to end for everyone. All BhVR had to do was block sloppy butcher perk until it was patched, but that never happened and allot of people were using it to fuck up games and anytime there is a glitch BhVR interactive drags their feet.
---
Especially for killers, and to wait 10 minutes for a match just to get your favorite perk banned would suck. Dedicated servers could help with that though.
---
Hey it's Brad Marchand
---
Im confused, whats the discussion?
---
Played against him and he did exactly this.  Camped, Tunneled, Slugged to avoid DS, Counted to 10 to avoid borrowed time and just overall played like an asshole.  Camped 1 person for a kill in the endgame.  Alright fine.  We all said GG and no one was toxic but he instead of saying GG started complaining about how we were "afking on Gens".  Like What?  We did all the totems and IDK what he expected us to do at this point.  Was I supposed to chase you while you were tunneling Meg??  LMAO.  He also was SHOCKED that no one was using wakeup because apparently Gens were going way too fast.  Then he started going through our profiles ON HIS STREAM to see if we were SWF.  I was watching his stream for 10 minutes after this and IDK how anyone can stand him.  He does that annoying mocking voice and whines about literally everything when he plays like a complete ass.
---
Any good team can take down a killer except those nurse mains on PC I hear are pretty lethal.
---
The 2/3/4 survivors sounds good tbh I wouldn't mind that
---
Michael can snowball Ghostface can’t. 
---
Ghostface power is a power that effects one survivor at a time. 
---
Michaels power can effect almost every survivor. 
---
I would say Michaels power is better easily. 
---
Especially since Ghostface can get knocked out of his stalking. And with the nerf I believe your progress dwindles away.
---
Wheres your dead hard?
---
Im sure he'll get a white costume....a yellow one....a brown one.....a green one....and they will each be atleast $5, or 4,500 shards.

Otherwise you'll have to deal with people like me, bored member of a debate team with nothing better to do. 
---
Welcome to the Internet ;*
---
No one likes waiting in queue to have a boring, quick ended game, I think it more is. Obviously no one wants to be the first one dead but it’s just annoying to have a killer refuse to do anything other than go for just you. 
---
In comparison, imagine if in your killer game the Survivors just blasted through the gens as fast as possible and either key escaped/got put the gates in less than five minutes. 
---
No one is saying to play by some rules but just a boring game is unfun on both ends.
---
No you're just annoying and weird and keep dragging it on..
---
if i had a player base i’d try to please them to keep the player base
---
basic marketing sorry if it’s too hard for you to understand
---
and PLEASE stop replying to me i’d love that more than anything
---
Am i the only one that doesn't know the bug?
---
Also if leatherface/hillbilly are about to hit you you with chainsaw can yeet into the locker and jump out while they are in cool down.
---
yes, lets push the dbd subreddit into the keanu circle jerk
---
The Keanu Reaves circlejerk really needs to stop.
---
Irc it's any normal, non special attack. Most killers aren't bugged by this, but Huntress can't use her hatchets for instance and I don't believe Legions power one hits either.
---
BHVR is the one who in the past had banned people who abused these type of glitches
---
You would also know that if you played at rank 10 against multiple twitches, people who have played 1000s of hours and legacy survivors like myself. You seriously don't know what you're talking about. I don't care what rank you are you're completely ignorant to the system.
---
My BIGGEST complaint is people hanging on while I'm on hatch especially against fast moving and instadown campers. 
---
Like thanks, now no one wins. And now I just play Killer and life is good.
---
Next time let him down you at the gate and crawl out. Usually fixes it.
---
I know, because it amuses me. You don't have to reply yknow, you continuely coming back is simply adding to your problem. If you'd ignored me from the start you wouldn't have let me annoy you.
---
agreed.
---
That's for sure, the devs are free to add skins to him wherever they want, at least from the neck to the toes, the only licenced thing is the mask
---
I swear I killed that guy already
---
Didn't read title, I thought this was a cosplay. I started typing how well it was put together.  
---
Read title, goddamn man very awesome
---
Welp. Gg lol.
---
Holy shit
---
Nah don't worry about it. A lot of people don't understand copyright law.
---
I also don’t think anyone will get banned. But some of the community believes they should, which is what I don’t agree with. Too many variables. Not worth trouble. Disable the perk if it’s really ruining peoples (killers) experience.
---
Also, while in a chase killers should not lose points for being near the hooked survivor. Not my fault they run around the hook.
---
The girls will end up like the girls in her lore
---
So long as you are in a chase, then I am cool with that.
---
Try hiding under the gen
---
You got this man, getting BP as killer is a cake walk anymore. You'll have them maxed in no time
---
I finally got around to watching it! It was amazing, I actually might have enjoyed the 2nd more than the first
---
Me at the begging 😂
---
I was not expecting the no-pulling vehicle. I was thinking it was a semi and that there'd be someone in a mask or an empty truck cab. 
---
On the real-side of things, HOW DO YOU MISS THAT TRAILER COMING UNHITCHED
---
I agree! I hope there is a third based on the ending. Glad you enjoyed it!
---
That would be great!
---
Hooks closer together, survivors appart, mori. They're all secret, no?
---
Most toxic killers are just bad players. They get frustrated and then decide to facecamp someone on a hook, slashing at them repeatedly until they die, trying to punish them further for "making them lose". If you're a survivor you can just laugh at that sad display. It's pathetic, really.
---
On the other hand, if youre a killer faced with toxic survivors it is a 4 on 1 situation. You are being bullied by a gang. You can completely wreck a team, play the whole game fairly, and at the end of the match when people start saying "shit noob camping killer", there's no one to back you up and tell that person they're wrong.
---
Lmaooo I love hahah 😂 he really tried it and you're like NaH that's perfect
---
Yeah I am not fussed now I know, it's just learning that was frustrating when it just didn't work.

i know, thats why i specified "when playing as ghostface"

---
I honestly find ghost face Hilarious I love how he can teabag like a champ
---
well all of the og dbd killers kills were offscreen cuz there was no screen
---
I can get from rank 12 to rank 5 if I played the game all day on either killer or survivor. Does that mean 1 day of playing makes me a better survivor/killer? No. It takes weeks of practice and learning tricks to perfect a certain killer, survivor is much easier, if you know how to loop you can pretty much carry yourself from rank 20 to rank 1 given how quickly your team mates either do gens or all die. And then other actions for survivor like making sure you do at least 1 or 2 gens and get 1 safe hook save with almost guarantee you get a pip. It's really easy to rank up and the only difference in ranks is about the 20-15 rank which are new players 14-3, which are casuals and then 2-1 which are tryhards.
---
but there is no killer stronger than nurse, she is without any doubt the best in the game and Ghostface is good but will never better than her. Seriously if I killer was I hate to sound like an entitled survivor but that killer would definitely need a nerf. As is, a good nurse can fuck over teams with ease and that's not even bothering with addons. To beat that we would need to bring back 2 frenzy hits to down injured survivors back and noone can win against that.
---
No one escapes death, you get the exposed status, so you are instantly downed when the gens are done.
---
nice I did that once but once everybody matched the killer dodged us lol

brown toolbox make skillcheck smaller

I used and still use sloppy butcher on wraith. I never had any crash issues. I had the occasional perma-blood splatter where survivors would bleed(I never spotted them because of it, finding survivors is fairly easy as wraith since they'll have a hard time straight up avoiding you without spinechill)
---
Me too. I literally never ever tbag anymore after playing a bit of a killer. Not that I should have before. There's just no reason to make your opponent feel bad

You are tired of playing against nurses? Play on ps4 😂!
---
If a survivor is behaving like an incompetent troll my strategy is to generally ignore them and focus on everyone else. Teabagging and flashlighting are basically that player saying "look, come chase me, I'm the player on this team that knows how to loop". Aka the person im least interested in chasing.
---
I’ve revealed a ghostface from around a corner and I’ve been staring directly at him before while he slowly stalked and then one shotted me. There’s not much consistency.
---
Good point!
---
its terrible dude, 15 percent lmao
---
Just going to steer clear of killer until this is fixed
---
braindead survivors dont count
---
Annoys tf out of me lol. I like your ideas btw, however I feel like the distraction one shouldn't count towards rank, but it should grant bp. Maybe like 1k per unhook.
---
Clearly you've never been on a survivor team with the killer
---
Use franklins to make them drop their key. A soul for a soulx
---
I’m new. What’s tunneling?
---
impossible
---
I mean, wake up was probably used by one in five hundred players if not less. Practically nobody that isn't abusing it would complain
---
lmfao that one, is that still in the game? I thought that was a bug, its fucking hilarious when you chase a survivor into it and they insta dc once they realize what just happened.
---
First things first 😂 I’m new to dbd also is that supposed to happen with the pixel glitch and stuff?🤔
---
I know, where in this post do I say that you need to do it with ghostface?
---
yes, pig and michael can do this, your point?
---
Im just gonna say it. I don't get it :/
---
@Same, my dude
---
did you not read the title or?
---
I got all my survivors lvl 40 and got 1 character p3-50 with all perks and I’m proud of myself 😅
---
whelp, there goes my ruin
---
Because the nurse literally steals peoples' breath
---
I don't appreciate the people who defend bug/exploit abusers because the bug/exploit was *put in the game by the devs.* That's stupid. If you are intentionally using a bug/exploit to gain an advantage, you are unbalancing a trial without regard to the other side. If you've ever faced someone use Infinite Mending Legion, then you wouldn't be so forgiving to people who use exploits. And if you *have* faced I.M. Legion and found it bearable, than that guy's ambitions for fucking with you were small. Sitting there mending for over 5 straight minutes to mend *once* or bleed out and die.
---
Someone deliberately crawled into a corner where I had no chance of getting them to a hook(Because all three of them died in the same area). He knew because I had tried to carry him off once, and then he ran straight back into that same area.
---
He was fairly salty when I responded in kind by simply letting him bleed out, because it was either that, or continuously deal with him running back to that spot if he couldn't find hatch
---
😂
---
The entity tells killers to break pallets so they have to buy more thus sustainmg their business how devilish
---
Have you tried playing killers w/o Ruin, and I mean playing a bunch and not giving up after 1-2 games.
---
hell yeah it would be worthy, too bad we got basic bitch shitty red addons
---
Ehh. 3/10.
---
Not in the league and overwatch subreddits no. The statement is relative to other gaming subreddits, and given that it's a game about lost souls murdering people half their size, it's somewhat odd.
---
Thanks
---
No one cares tho..
---
My problems with this:
---
1. Myers is better than Ghost Face significantly, better down capability and snowball potential.
---
2. Plague is definitely better than doc.
---
3. Clown  is better than doc too lol.
---
4. Bubba is in no way -not even close to- as bad as Freddy.
---
3 days later and im unable to get pips feelsbadman
---
Which is what makes it weirder.
---
mind naming one perk they banned for ppl using? as far as I'm aware they only did the add-ons but never a perk and 2 examples are tinker and sloppy they never punished those who abused that
---
I can do what I please on my own post weirdo.
---
It's kind of like with Laurie pre-DS nerf. You pretty much expected her to run it, and if she was P3, you were going to make life hell for her. Or with David, you expect Dead Hard. Teachables of a survivor immediately make you a suspect
---
Was this a real episode
---
I                                 I

           I                   I
---
The top line is the skill spread of survivors from worst to best, the bottom line is the skill of killers from worst to best. Killer is incredibly easy until you start reaching the higher echelon because the barrier to entry is extremely low. It’s like picking Ryu in street fighter.
---
Is this like a console only glitch? I've had it myself, and have only seen photos of it on PS4.
---
Yes. A lot of times. And if you’re played even half brained survivors in red rank, you need it.
---
Plus now with them counting toward ranking up, there's more reason than ever to cleanse them
---
That went from survivors having a good game to killer having a good game in one second
---
Part of countering him is staying out of the open. Like with Mike, you have to use LOS blockers as much as possible.
---
Repeatedly Hitting you on the hook is actually the big toxic though
---
Now that you’re gonna start playing dbd, your faith in humanity will deplete back to its natural state ;)
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-V5xvMZtxQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-V5xvMZtxQ)
---
Would explain why the survivors don't flat out die when they take one to the back of their head
---
We exist but very few live this update we might be even worse as a species as we are
---
Killer has a lower barrier of entry and a lower skill cap, survivor has a much higher barrier of entry but is amazing once you reach the top. 
---
It’s like picking Ryu over someone like Magneto in Marvel vs Capcom. You’ll get more out of Ryu until you play someone that knows a little something.
---
I dont enjoy playing killer because I feel like I'm not good enough to go after folks to make it worth it. But yeaaaa had q game like that against the doc.
---
Goes both ways. So many killers expect to get 4ks every game, and feel even entitled to it, it seems. I'm not hating on either side or whatever, but it is just the same for some killer players.
---
Maybe idk? That’s the first time it’s happen to me
---
Oh god i cant wait
---
Thank the entity
---
If taking a hit for someone being chased would count toward a protection hit (like it should) that would go a long way. The effect is strong enough that shouldn't be free to activate, but it should be something achievable in most matches otherwise why use a slot on it.
---
Banning people is dumb, but ignoring the bug and letting people abuse it is also dumb.
---
I think the photos have since been deleted, but I've had that, one where it was that same thing and all, but you couldn't see any survivors. It then wouldn't load in the games, and I had to close the application. It would always "break" my session.
---
I thought it was Collins
---
Whyre you still replying to this?
---
Honestly this, I don’t want to die to a billy with zero perks who can’t even land a single chainsaw hit because 3 Claudette’s with keys are urban evading around the corners of the map until I completely enough generators for the hatch to spawn
---
Don’t mind me messing up and commenting a new thread instead of replying
---
Twice, by clown, was Quintin both times, once hooked 3 times in a minute because the other survivors were overly Altruistic and the clown was taking the easy target, the second time I had pebble and DS so it saved me on the third hook.

This was posted the other day, lmao.
---
Well if you want to be annoyed that badly then don't let me stop you. However you'll have to find a new source of annoyance as I'm going to bed.
---
I had to OoO 3 times to finally get adept. Never looked at a wall for so long in my life. Seriously, when would that work ever be useful
---
The only thing I see wrong with a toxic queue is most survivors would just vote every killer that killed them as toxic. And before you say thats unfair to say of survivors I used to have pages upon pages of silly - rep comments just because I didn't respect the 4% or tunneled a guy all he would do is run at me.
---
I play both sides pretty much equally, I just find that annoying killers start at rank 4 while survivors, who've been taught by these youtubers, start at like 13 lol.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
&gt; mostly solo player I haven’t made it to red ranks once since then, meaning that instead of getting put back to rank 10 or whatever it is from rank 1, I’m getting put back to like 13 which is just so much more annoying to try and get out of. You’re either stuck running lower skilled killers around forever and not pipping or dealing with survivors that go down in an instant and are too afraid to touch gens and go for saves.
---
Cuz they still pip from doing totems and farming unhooks.
---
I'm honestly more interested in scrolling up and down so it looks like bubba is doin a cute lil walk
---
Only Mori and surv apart
---
And you said other offerings
---
Lol at you're last part
---
Any decent Killer know where the hatch is and will be there to close it right after it open. Plus that's a selfish strategy that usually end with people like me getting camped because gens aren't getting done.
---
Best meme on this sub ever
---
I know that feal bro :(
---
Love love love love love love love this.
---
Would probably be an outfit sit that I would wear all off instead of mix &amp; matching.
---
Also, can Feng please get one more fucking cosmetic with jeans. I love her skirts &amp; shorts but some more trouser options would be fab!
---
I think you overestimate the general intellect of survivor teams. Also I play Pig, Wraith, Huntress, and Trapper (stopped because of the camera issue) mostly and no Ruin used.
---
:)
---
One game I literally ran towards him whilst he was stalking and it still didn’t reveal him lol. He’s a lot of fun to play as though!
---
Because smaller detection circle is better than crouching around shit just to get faster stalk. I usually run the drivers license and the purple one that considerably increases rate survivors get marked
---
Proceeds to camp everyone
---
The killer can hear your breath in the locker and the taller survivors faces can be seen from outside
---
I thought Legion was considered pretty decent after the changes?
---
I think Doctor and Clown should be swapped but otherwise that’s pretty on the money imo.
---
It's part of Tapp's lore now: death by snu snu.
---
If you are easier to take out than the rest of your team, you should not complain about killers "tunneling" you. IT is just them doing their objective.
---
Check your post dude
---
I can even say that I've watched a well enough amount of gameplay from DBD survivor youtubers, so it is true. I personally don't play annoying, \[at least on purpose, like t-bagging after getting a pallet stun\] but I know there are survivors that do. I've at the moment been stuck in ranks 12-14 \[potato survivors, man. not to mention the camps, tunnels, sandbagging, and being farmed right off of hook.\], and we've encountered toxic killers at this rank as well. It is prevalent.
---
The issue with SWF is communication and coordination that isn’t intended. Yes you’re a team but the level of cooperation that a team on voice chat has is far beyond anything that can be countered by powers or perks unless you’re a god tier Nurse. A LOT (not all) of the SWF groups out there are building more to be bullies than to just survive, and they play using information gained via a third party program like Discord to chat with friends. They often use this to spread information like their own location, gen/totem/pallet/item/hatch locations, who the killer is/what they’re doing, if it’s safe to go for an unhook, who’s going for said unhook so the rest can continue gen work, and tons of other things that would normally only be known via specific perks or even perks that don’t exist.
---
For the record, TECHNICALLY any usage of a third party program to gain an unfair advantage falls under the definition of cheating, though it’s not reportable in this case nor am I saying it SHOULD be reported. It’s just a technicality based off the commonly accepted definition of cheating in a game.
---
Little man
---
False check their page big brain. They literally put a note out about this.
---
you know whats funny about the freddy part is that theres a comic series where ash actually DOES fight freddy AND jason and he fairs pretty well against both
---
literally everyone here is saying watch other people and I’m going to say the same thing lol. 
---
I watched monto and noob3 a bunch and practiced a bunch and I can loop and juke pretty decently
---
WHAT DOES IT DO?!
---
Gets camped :)
---
Survivors: do anything
---
killers: OMG WTF TOXIC?
---
How am I supposed to react? 😂 it was funny!
---
I became a Franklin user just because of toxic survivors,  [F] for all those items lost
---
That's my last name
---
NTA, you had no idea that you would shart and offering to pay to for the replacement was very noble of you. Im hoping this is a literal "shit" post tho because this is on the dbd subreddit, and I want to let everyone know im not getting wooshed
---
I had someone the other day bring an Ivory Mori, find and hook the obsession in liket he first minute, tunnel them off the unhook, down them and immediately mori them. COuldn't have taken more than two minutes.
---
They had Dying Light.
---
I get that that is a legit strategy, but man I felt bad for that survivor. What an awful experience that match was.
---
I think it should personally. You don't know how frustrating it is to be really good at looping, but then depip, while the hook bombing claudette who isn't that good at the game pips because "benevolent". The value of skill in this game is completely wack.
---
U a Dwight by chance?
---
Me when I die 😂
---
I mean every game :’(
---
Don't waste your money lobbies are dead af.
---
They are not doing nothing that’s why it’s a disappointment
---
Damn that was close!
---
When she walked right by you as you picked the flashlight back up I wished I could upvote more than once :)
---
It also works in spanish:
---
Sale puto or Sale puta it's like a way of saying "whatever whore" or "see ya whore" among other meanings that don't fit as much.
---
to download it?
---
I played with it for five games since I was going for adepts. Still am on Ash rn my last survivor one but let's say I fucking felt bad for all the killers I went against I dont disagree when they tunneled me for having it
---
If a single survivor complains about being tea bagged, they should promptly be hanged. In general, they've been doing it since the game came out. They don't have the right to complain.
---
Then you scream coming out the locker and hear the heartbeat again
---
This happened to me just a couple of weeks ago lmao
---
Yeah but the thing is that I can actually do something about it when I'm the killer, if I get a crude killer I can't do anything but try and get away, them messaging me I can just ignore but slashing me on the hook and targeting me alone I can't do anything about is just annoying, especially since I HATE being toxic and didn't even do anything but do a successful loop while playing Quentin.
---
You serious? Is abortion still an option?
---
Yeah and if you leave it on the start screen my PlayStation will overheat and sound like it’s about to explode
---
I understand Entity worship has become increasingly prevalent in The Fog.
---
Probably through the eye holes
---
I mean it would render some perks useless like Bond, Empathy, Aftercare, etc...
---
I know what you mean, but you gain rank just for making the chase long. What if the killer decides to break chase or if you lose him and the survivor is saved? I dont feel that is good for ranking. Just my op.
---
Wait wut. 
---
I get tired of seeing the occasional repost just as much as the next guy, but apart from karma (for whatever that's worth), I'd say the ideal purpose of a repost is for us that didn't see it the first time it passed. And stuff.
---
Ah my b
---
I miss this fucking show man
---
Honest question, did it become like a meme to use this meme wrong?
---
That's why I don't like dying light, but yeah that was a legitimate strategy but definitely not fun, at least not for the survivors
---
Well I was thinking you wouldn't be able to see them through walls, only when your teammates are in sight.
---
That's exactly what I do. I wanna chase the Claudette with the toolbox who's pumping gens and doesn't want to be interrupted, rather than the prestige three Quentin with a flashlight who's doing no gens, and wants to loop/blind/t-bag while also running d-strike &amp; mettle to waste as much of my time as possible. It's comforting to think "just wait you lil shit, I'll get to your ass later"
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
I’m rank 9 and keep getting fuckin bullied. Haven’t gotten a single 4K tonight and it’s pissed me off. I get broken out of night shroud easily seems like.
---
Please fix your thumbnail
---
Yes it's like the pte, only available at a certain time. When the vanilla experiment is open it should accept the code.
---
You are the literal reincarnation of the devil
---
Don't we all?
---
I didn't try to wait that long lmao. The weirdest part was I was in SWF with one buddy when it happened once, and he was saying he could see the loading screen just fine and the game was processing perfectly, but then here I am sitting on this vacant survivor lobby screen with different lighting. I had to leave, didn't wait to see if the game would work, so we just reloaded our sessions.
---
You dare try to remove our Elon from the throne?
---
Well, i guess im up now
---
See I do that but then I get banned when all I said was You're out Mr Boiler
---
Implying that nerfing addons is "fixing bugs".
---
I never said you find it in the subreddits, but if you want to go that route, you don't find porn of dbd in here either.  
---
I don't believe it is worth noting that at all. What does that have to do with anything? Is it also worth noting that some people think all porn is odd?
---
I revel in false hope, I bathe in salty tears, I am a toxic killer, I am what survivors fear
---
I'm currently rank 5 with 2 pips and at what I consider a high rank they just dont. The only time I really escape against him is SWF
---
*too many pallets, map needs rework. Survivors crying, killers need a buff and survivors need a nerf everytime I cant easily kill everyone. I'm the power roll, I should win without effort.
---
Same here, I do not want to get yanked by some default TR killer
---
I like them as well as they feels more claustrophobic
---
Character more needs to face him for 1.5 seconds
---
Well yeah, then it sucked for us because we knew we weren't gonna win.
---
It was swamp and IIRC it was either a hag that laid traps EVERYWHERE or a Spirit that hook proxy-camped and tunneled. I had both recently on Swamp.
---
Honestly just the epitome of a very unfun match.
---
It would be fucking disgusting.
---
But yummy nonetheless.
---
Spine chill wont allow me to knock him out of night shroud better. Itll just tell me when he sees me. It helps it doesnt fix any of the big problems tho
---
My bad. What I am asking is why a purple addon way better than the ultra rare? The Footage addon penalizes the killer into a situational gameplay style. Tremendously decreasing overall stalking to favor leaning is hot garbage.
---
give this man your upvotes
---
PSA: Try a gen if you hear a Hex get destroyed.
---
People cleansing a second Totem when Ruin is already gone is completely avoidable and really pisses me off.
---
No but to be fair it's the truth. Last time a killer got "nerfed" and I say it in parenthesis for a reason they got turned into steaming shit. Aka fredrick. But the changes they revealed are nothing like fredrick status
---
At least now you get lightbringer if your team does gens or totems while you are in chase.
---
Uhm I don't know if you've seen it. But I made this image and posted it some days ago. I would like it if you would take it down.
---
Oh look I found that one jagoff who always has to be contrarian. As soon as something becomes popular or “mainstream” they have to cry from the rooftops that they disagree to feel superior to everyone.
---
Oh I thought you just meant why is everyone saying its better my bad I'm stupid
---
Happened to me for the first time today, I wanted to cry a little
---
On console, he seems to be the "New Legion." I've seen multiple people get off their first hook, and either healed up, then stalked and insta-downed, or just re-downed again right after. Or as soon as they see someone get the stalk ring around them in the HUD. Either way, it's a spicy DC right then. I don't know how he is on PC, but thankfully the huge influx of GF is dying down. I've been honestly just tired of him.
---
Most likely not anytime soon.
---
For new cosmetics they have to consult the owners of the character.
---
But yes, ghostface has a ton of cosmetic possibilities, I hope to see scarecrow ghostface and I hope they manage to get the rights to use the father death costume.
---
You’re next line is: Doesn’t matter, ghost face tbagging is still BM ggez baby killer
---
I like to ignore those people, sometimes swinging at them if they get close. It's like, you're always in a chase with that survivor, so why not focus on getting in chases with two survivors so less people are on the gens?
---
Not offended or anything but there hasn’t been a single official photo of Joey being black. It’s just that for some reason the community turned him black. I find it a little funny and I don’t know why
---
I got out of a match last night where 3 survivors DCed first down after I got stalk off from leaning out behind a tree while they were looking at me. The last one got hatch after I afked in the corner so he could get away. Of course they all waited till post game to say "gg ez hatch". When I told them I didn't wait 30 mins in killer queue and use an anniversary cake for this and asked why they did it, they told me "we didn't wait in queue for you to abuse a tree to get stalk off". I abide to survivor rules every match, and in my last 100 hours of playtime I've only gotten a couple salty post game chats. I draw the line at abusing a tree to get stalk off. Funny thing too because they were all completely garbage and each got downed in the first few seconds of chase. 
---
Anyways, I don't know how broken or annoying it is now, but what I gather from this is that detecting ghostface should be harder but more consistent. If BHVR only does the latter or even nerfs him, I will shit and cum on the front doors of their HQ.
---
And he is giving the killer extra points by getting caught. It's pretty stupid to think the killer shouldn't take the kill there
---
Pretty much this. I let someone wiggle off once around a year and a half ago and they got the hatch I was going to drop them at.  
---
Post-game was them and the three others talking mad shit and harassing me on my Steam profile. It was the game that finally made me switch to private profile to avoid the salt. So yeah, I only give the hatch if I can make it obvious I gave it to them.
---
As a fellow Wraith main I approve this message. Fuckin campers give us a bad name.
---
A Dbd Youtuber/Streamer that was exposed to be requesting inappropriate pictures from minors, and encouraged toxic playstyles.
---
I recently started playing killer properly for the first time since I got the game a year or so ago. Man I feel bad for being an entitled survivor main.
---
The explanation is simple. Bhvr coding. ;)
---
Funworld has the rights to the mask and outfit. They got the license from them to use their attire. While they have tried for years they’ve admitted before to get the scream rights. They weren’t able to but fun world and the creator of the Ghost face mask was happy. I really wish people would stop blaming Bhvr for not using scream cause it isn’t scream. It’s not just you but a lot of people on this don’t seem to get that and it’s been posted a lot.
---
I’m new so can you tell me what that means
---
Not all, but a lot do.
---
Besides, considering the way the game is, a coordinated SWF team is kinda like cheating. You get some "perks" for free and a comunication that easily surpasses anything a perk could give you.
---
So my question to you is would you call people toxic for playing with unfair advantages?
---
It’s bullshit been an M1 killer all night tonight because green survivors just loop me til I get my power I try to use it(on them or on a new guy) and I just get broken out of it instantly. It’s bullshit
---
Also the killer gets faster dependent on the level of the perk. At max teir 3 I think it’s like 4% faster. Doesn’t seem like a lot but trust me it is.
---
Dead by code lite 
---
“There’s a game in this bug somewhere”
---
I completely agree with you. Dead by daylight is such a good game but i quit playing a couple of months ago because i was tired of getting nasty messages from people claiming i didnt know how to play the game or i was "a trash insert killer name here" it sucked the enjoyment out of the game for me. It was get hate mail for winning or get trolled for not winning. And some of those messages were preeeeeetttty hateful. One person even told me to kill myself. Yea no thanks. Ill just stick to watching monto, at least he is funny.
---
Bhvr is the company that makes the game.
---
Oh alr thx haha
---
Oh lol
---
Alr thx
---
imagine not using the scroll wheel for struggling
---
*Mayans
---
Hahaaaaaa, charade you are.
---
Bro ain't you heard the news we ain't doin keanu praise anymore
---
Why :(
---
Hey you guys leave my brother alone.
---
*satire*
---
It’s just a bug. They are really common in Dead by Daylight because they churn out “new content” aka new killers and survivors fairly often which leads to bugs in code. Not a whole lot you can do tbh
---
Well...Good for him, he would be destroyed by Shaggy. *Yes, I will keep this meme alive.*
---
Mori = skill legion fun :)
---
Oh you clearly don't know what they were doing all game long! Probably a swf, the others always clicked their flashlight whenever I got stunned from a pallet. And I really do think he stepped in the trap by accident since it was a "tremendously darker" one. Maybe he wanted to give me some extra points by letting me hit him, but well.
---
That Dwight knew something wasn't right as he waved at Quentin. After the game, nobody wrote something in chat either. Not even a salty word.
---
I loved him since John wick 1. Keanu is BAE. Just because he got "popular" over a meme doesnt me he was never loved before
---
My hero
---
For real, im not sure what it is, but almost every Ghostface ive played against tunnels *hard.* Like, real hard. Ive been tunneled for almost 5 gens by a few. DS? No problem, they tunnel me through it. Lmao.
---
"Something isnt working right and I should be allowed to use it no matter the detriment to the other side"
---
Sounds cool to me, I guess?
---
There was glitch on Xbox where ash puppet hand couldn't use flashlights properly but they fixed it :)
---
Sorry man, didnt know
---
Ive played killer like 15 times and this has happend to me in 3 of those times
---
One of my first matches I got called a camper, I vaguely remember like 3 of them doing nothing but going for really risky unhooks on the hooks while only one guy did gens (they didn't win). After that I turned off all messaging on PS4 so I wouldn't ever have to speak with morons like that.
---
That couldve been from wake up being bugged. If i see any kind of quintin you bet im gonna get them out asap, I'm not gonna deal with wake up being abused.
---
Bhvr can suck a dick on this one. I paid for ash and now his perk is useless.
---
Stay there.
---
If the totem cant be found pretty quickly, i don't expect people to come back for me. Just leave. Its not worth all of us dying.
---
Cos I can :)
---
Same lol
---
Oh, I didn't realize that. I just thought the title would've been clever, so I guess I know why they didn't use it now- Thanks for explaining!
---
Never works for them, I will just pick them up when they get out. Or maybe I just face survivors with bad timing.
---
i bathe in salty lips
---
yet my luck is complete shit
---
Honestly playing killer makes me understand how Skyrim guards must feel
---
I honestly don’t even want to play Killer until Wake Up is fixed.
---
I chased a guy for 20 seconds and 2 Gens popped.
---
Oh you clearly don't know what they were doing all game long!
---
It's not like I do things like that every day. But it was probably a swf, the others always clicked their flashlight whenever I got stunned from a pallet, saved their mates right in front of me etc... And I really do think he stepped in the trap by accident since it was a "tremendously darker" one. Maybe he wanted to give me some extra points by letting me hit him, but well.

You have to invite every match
---
The killer times have been really long since Ghostface's release, so you may just have to wait longer, other wise if it's like an hour of stuck on searching, no idea bud.
---
This is incredible. Your attention to detail is what really makes this.
---
Did I mention I killed him? I don't think so: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ydd5SWEQlV4KC-cI4E8XzCEQQ_lW60JW/view?usp=drivesdk
---
No you are the first and only one in the world
---
If you legit outplayed them and they still act like a lil bitch about it, let em have it and laugh. This is their one time where they get to feel like a winner. If your team is decent tunneling you amd camping your hook has already led to Entity Displeased.
---
Survivor: "hahaha fuck you killer"
---
Also Survivor: "facecamping piece of shit, what did I do to you?"
---
The duality of man
---
Knowledge is power happy to help 😂
---
The devs said they're aware of it on the forums but they just said fuck it and bailed for the weekend without even a bandaid.
---
Wake up give a 15 percent bonus speed to Totems, Gens and I think healing. It is only supposed to give that bonus to opening the exit gates.
---
For ghostface, does he have ro see your full body, or is just a bit of that white glow enough? When i play him, im never sure how far to peek. Is seeing just an arm popping out frkm behind a gen enough?
---
There's no icon. Same thing for devour hope. It's meant to be a "oh fuck" situation
---
Just make it more consistant for him and the survivor. I find that either I reveal him through the wall, or I stare right at him for 10+ seconds and he doesnt even begin to get revealed.
---
Is this noed?
---
It wasn't just sb with Wraith that did it, it was combing the perk with his green blind warrior add on. It was patched a few months ago.
---
Exactly. Maybe if they really get in your face just slash em once so they go heal in a corner for a while.
---
Should I stop trying to use freedy?
---
Just want to show you the Quentin is alright mate: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ydd5SWEQlV4KC-cI4E8XzCEQQ_lW60JW/view?usp=drivesdk
---
I know. I was being ironic :P
---
Yikes, that's super annoying, but thanks for the info!
---
Like I said in my post, I see this as a fair point, but I’d say that it’s only an advantage if you use it well. My friends and I are not that good at this game. We’re decent, but we’re no 360 jukers. And we play like it. We don’t always use this information to our advantage. We’re not always a 4 stack so there’s the randos. We actually don’t always play with comms because of where we might be in public settings like a dorm lobby, etc. I think if you have a rank 1 SWF yeah that would suck terribly for the killer and propose intense disadvantages. But the only time my friends and I have ever done well and used any sort of communication to our advantage is with low rank killers. Additionally, I don’t believe that this was something the Devs magically looked over, they know SWF is a function and they know how people are using it. I believe IF it was causing some catastrophic tilt in the win/loss ratio, they would remove its functionality. I certainly don’t believe SWF should automatically be considered cheating and thus something bannable. Personally, I wouldn’t play the game without it’s function. I used to play alone and it was fun and suspenseful and scary in low ranks... but the higher you go with randos, you get farmed and then tunneled for points. Or you get matced wit survivors too scared to do anything if the bear a heartbeat. At least with my friends I know they won’t do either (well I’ve been farmed by my friends as jokes but that’s not the point). It’s simply not enjoyable. So like I said, I understand your point of view but humbly disagree. :) thank you for your input! 
---
And yes I know you could fire back at me with “well, SWF isn’t enjoyable for the killers” and I think that just depends on who the SWF are. So, agree to disagree :)
---
The legend himself, zombiehugger
---
Right that's what I thought too
---
I'm gonna get downvoted but I'll stay say it: swf  (3+ players) are inherently toxic, not because of the players but because of the fact that they're playing the game in a way it's not meant to be played. That wouldn't really matter if the game was somewhat balanced; the problem is that the game itself isn't balanced for solo players and if you throw in a decent swf with comms, then it's not  an enjoyable experience for killers. The keyword being decent.   
---
I stopped playing killers because of tbagging swfs that spam unnecessary flashlights. I eventually came back, somewhat learned how to deal with them and nowadays use their weakness to my advantage. Is it worth to deal with it? More often than not, it isn't. Everytime I see a swf in my lobby, it's a "high-risk/high-reward" scenario, but the fact that they're already playing with an advantage, tilts me and my performance suffers.  
---
 I cant blame a swf for tilting me, but you asked if it was toxic, so here's my explanation. Because I might not want to deal with potentially toxic players during/ after a stressing game,  that are also playing with an advantage, I might choose to dodge the lobby. 
---
Sorry just being honest.
---
I play quite a lot of Killer next to being a Main Surv and sometimes... survivors are just better than I am at tracking &amp; chasing. It is not toxic when they use what they have - it is not toxic when they loop me and I usually get over the 2 claudettes or the random meg who got carried by her team that tbags at the exit gate. Big OOF I know.
---
Yeah I haven't ran it since I found out but Quentin just always gets it worse for some reason, even before the bug:/
---
BHVR official
---
hmmm
---
Omg now i understand why i repear generators so fast xD
---
That's was a REALLY great skill check
---
Happened today after I teabagged at the exit, feelsbadman
---
Nice flair you got there. Would be a shame if someone were to
---
Correct it to shitpost
---
Clearly you didn’t read the post lmao
---
I usually wait about 15 minutes before I remember to shut the game down.
---
It's so ridiculous, but yeah at least my team escaped
---
Thats the point. You should not have a free escape just because you are the last one alive. Especially now that the hatch opens no matter how many gens are done.
---
This deserves a lot more upvotes
---
The thing is though people have fully rendered all 4 legion members without their mask on so we know for fact Joey's black.
---
Would be a shame if the dude posted it gives 0 fucks about anything about reddit
---
Maybe freddy's dlc is just cursed with garbage lol
---
Or you know they are the freebies every reddit killer wants because they just crouch around.
---
It would kind of ruin the atmosphere
---
Good for you.
---
Yeah, I see your point.
---
Honestly now i take try hard as a compliment. People only say that when they salty cuz they were outplayed.
---
No, actually roleplaying a serial killer and getting into character is "toxic", remember?
---
Well I mean, fuck.
---
I don't know about the add-ons, specifically. But I've had multiple games where he's literally right the fuck in front of me, not hiding behind anything, and I can't trigger the reveal. Quickly get marked and downed.
---
What kind of reveal radius are we talking about? Do we have to be eyeball to eyeball?
---
Because for me the problem isn't the add ons, it's the reveal mechanic just straight up not working and being inconsistent as hell at best.
---
They have bad timing
---
Why? You cant use any other item while downed. Or should we allow needles to be used while downed?
---
There’s a wake up bug? People still use wake up?
---
Didn’t Jen say she only deranks so she wouldn’t have the same killer constantly in the red ranks and pretty sure she had an actual reason to derank and be accused t “ bully new killers/players”
---
the hatch spawns with all 5 gens up :\\ dear lord
---
Underused imo. Some new memes are already boring to me. This meme should have remained a classic mainstay.
---
Don’t apologize, I appreciate the response and for saying it in a well thought out and respectful manner. You’ll definitely get upvoted don’t worry my friend, this thread is downvote city for us survivors 😂 like I’ve said, I understand this and I’m sorry that it affects you like that, I mean that and I hope maybe there’s something that can be changed about it that makes it enjoyable and you not have to worry about potentially having a not fun and stressful game. Thanks again!
---
Just an annoying visual bug with the progress bar. I've had it too, affects everything and it makes it kinda tough to know if you should commit to something or nah.
---
He got popular over the Matrix movies, not the meme.
---
People will cheese block the hook all round and then cry about camping or some shit.
---
It's probably just Remake Freddy as a whole, should've got Englund Freddy
---
Why do people hate Quentin? Can someone fill me in on this?
---
We found the problem. Watch the rework turn him into the freddy we all know and love
---
Seems well deserved.
---
Ok, Martin Luther King Jr
---
Downvotes don't change the fact Adrenaline is meta because of how stupid strong it is. C'mon now.
---
Normally I would say yeah but, I did 4 of 5 gens that match😕
---
What?
---
Yes!
---
Dude you gotta. Its the final challenge. Is the victory even worth it if you abandon your comrade like a coward?
---
What exactly do all of you qualify as toxic? You cannot seriously tell me that you are all THIS triggered by some people pressing the crouch button 5 times in a row. I simply won't have it. Or are we back at a point where looping and trying to survive is classified as toxic? If you do not get 4Ks a lot because you get looped or any other BS thing you guys just need to get better at running pallets.  Instaheals are about as toxic as eboni moris, flashlights are tools for survival and perks are perks the same as noed is a perk that we finally just need to start dealing with.   
---
If you are seriously putt off by teabag that much you also need to calm the fuck down those people are randoms you will probably never see again. 
---
Losing is frustrating yes. I sometimes get stomped so hard on my main killer I start to question if I am decent at it to begin with. Specially when I get shitty maps like trashfield and everybody has balanced landing. But for every stomp I get 3 games in a row with 4ks. On Killers I barely play I often get shit on. Hey I get shit on with nurse cuz I am boosted with her. Other people, some of the streamers we all like to watch, do perfectly fine on those killers even in red ranks. Because they dont constantly complain and just play. Frustration belongs to gaming and to losing - moving on and getting better at what you do is how to battle that instead of putting all your misery on the other side of the game just because they did xyz YOU think is toxic.   
---
The ONLY Killer Buff that is 100% needed is more time. I don't know how to achive that because making gens take longer would be SUPER boring for survivors as holding M1 for a Minute while others are being chased is inda boring already but I am no gamedev either.
---
You said you had a dream
---
Csgo- Nobody in game was banned for it.
---
Fortnite- you could go under the map and shoot from under. It took a lot to get under and was very precise. Almost never ever an accident. Easy to ban for that. There have been countless exploits even showcased in huge tournaments, e.g shoot while rifting glitch. No bans. All exploits that aren’t game breaking but are a skill gap are encouraged in this game.
---
This reference... Golden
---
Ooh, yeah, i also had a tf2 dream last night
---
Ooh
---
Ikr? Everyone hates t-bagging and harmless shit like that (if that's toxic i'm toxic af) but i'm always polite and say gg in the chat no matter how tilted i am cuz that's what really matters imo. Playing in a rude or ruthless manner is one thing, articulating your unnecessary and aimless hate to someone is another thing. ^also i just love those random 2 min long convos about something funny that happened in the match with people i've never met before
---
I'm gonna cry Kavid Ding is so adorable 😂
---
oH bOy YOuRe neW heRe hUh?
---
😘
---
About every ten or so games it happens to me.
---
Yeah common glitch as of late. She can still use hatch. When this happens to my last survivor, I usually bring them to hatch
---
This happens so much now. Game has once again become nearly unplayable as a survivor. People on PS4 are staring to DC a lot again because of it like they did a couple months ago.
---
Wait so thana is legit broken to not doing anything?
---
beta make smile
---
You entered a Stargate
---
Ok, thx
---
The only issue I have with his hidey-stalky power is when he’s standing wide open and staring directly at him doesn’t do anything. Like, wtf more ‘reveal’ do they want? 
---
Using a tree is clever, and those survivors are whiny wankers.
---
I'm with you. I definitely feel like Ghostface was intentionally designed as a killer to scare people by the devs. It's legitimately spooky when you get marked and have no idea where he is or he just rounds a corner and smacks you upside the head.
---
It feels like they wanted the game to scare people more because Pig isn't really scare and Myers is really only spoopy in Tier 1. 
---
It's just a shame the reveal consistency is so poor right now.
---
I am a Quentin main and I say shut the dang flabbin perk down.
---
Take your upvote.
---
No he’s just a little broken. But I agree that it was a total cop out on his ripped off combined power. And they are about to do the same thing to Freddy’. Shows that they have obviously either run out of ideas and won’t take any of the feedback or concepts they are sent all the time, or are just too lazy to try. And going back to Freddy for a second, As a Freddy Main I’m pretty upset that they did the same thing to him by making him a Doctor and Nurse combo. 
---
If we wanted to play those characters and use those abilities, we WOULD. 
---
Also that Gen teleport that they are about to give Freddy is literally a rip off of not just The Nurse, but a complete rip off is a Chinese game that kind of ripped off DBD. Hybrid Panda played it on his channel once, and the main power the killers have is to teleport between these shrine things that survivors have to interact with (their version of generators) to escape.
---
Apparently it's because name calling is a bannable offense
---
Thank you father
---
Dwight op pls nerf
---
Well, maybe just maybe you should get yourself covered? Jeez, you basically run without even taking an attempt to hide
---
I didn't call them an insulting name though I just said you're out mr boiler
---
Aww come on man dont do me dirty too 😭 i get enough mean survivors that BM after I've obviously been more than gracious, even letting people escape when their shitty teammates sand bag them; then T-bag and flashlight me relentlessly as I'm bringing their teammates body to the exit gate.
---
Happy cake day
---
I guess Mr. Boiler counts as name calling
---
Downvoted for the truth lol
---
It’s my duty, young citizen!
---
Damn. I found it funny
---
What if there was a totem that yoinked 2K bloodpoints from you instead of granting you 1K.
---
Hex: Yoink
---
That means nothing I started playing three years ago and still play I love this damn game too much too quit but if these devs keep releasing low tier or shit killers idk man it’s just so boring at red ranks that’s why I try my absolute hardest to avoid it
---
I had this problem with devour hope before plague was released except it literally wasn’t effective on me at all (tier 3 too so we knew early on). It was so weird people were getting moried and I still wasn’t going down in one hit.
---
Thats fair.
---
Only if you aren’t running No Mither like an idiot /s
---
If you feel this removal was in error, or if you have further questions, [feel free to contact the mod team.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdeadbydaylight&amp;message=[so is ghostface a top tier killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c4iz3s/so_is_ghostface_a_top_tier_killer/))
---
I encountered a god nurse once, it was in the game map and she was perkless. We got completely slaughtered
---
You kinda missed the point of the vid chief
---
Yes, except there’s a few million perks dedicated to slowing down gens. Ghostly+Ruin = A bad time. 
---
And that second part isn’t real
---
She was past the gate?
---
You're punishing the hooked survivor for bad team mates
---
No bueno my dude
---
How does adrenaline help against noed? You still get downed with one hit.. Lmao
---
How would that even work nothing right now takes away points lol I don't trust the devs after the last update where they broke multiple perks
---
Anything but running in a straight line and dying is toxic and you deserve 2 be face camped entitled survivor main running any perks even closely related 2 meta perks
---
If you read the other comments you'll know why it's there I'm not repeating myself
---
Greed. Such unbridled greed.
---
Of course my son
---
"most op perk in the game" says a lot about the other perks, the perk only gives you one free heal and a short burst of speed. people only think it's op because it gives coordinated groups a sharper edge when used together
---
They arent as bad as they used to be, at least. Remember when a purple flashlight would blind you in half a second and damage your retinas IRL? I remember.
---
I mean, this is a game where one of the male characters have shirtless outfit, have body pillow made of said shirtless outfit. Then portrayed in homoerotic illustration with another male character.
---
Of course people are going to sexualise them! 
---
That's not counting all of those sexy moans the survivors are making when they're injured. People are horny and the game amplify their horniness. Plus, there's nothing wrong with having sexual desire.
---
Dude, as long as you don't stop attacking people directly you will never get your point across.  
---
Alright, I phrased that badly, but I did take into account that you can get camped or tunneled at the hook. But yet again: it's part of the game's mechanics. Does it suck for the one on the hook? Yes it does. But it's also an effective way to play depending on the circumstances, so I would not - as you frequently have - generally call the killer an asshole in this situation. In my experience tunneling and/or camping mostly happens due to the survivors just overplaying their hand, as in unsafely unhooking without BT, unhooking immediately after a person was hooked, swarming the hook, not giving the killer time to leave, etc.. - that's just a bad survivor play.   
---
You don't win every round, be it as killer or survivor, so just move on if you lost. And if you want to call someone an asshole, I'd reserve that for the other survivors in these cases. Yes, you already said that you don't have any influence over their behaviour and that the onus is on the killer to behave a certain way, but that "choice" was put onto the killer by those same survivors who made a bad play. They are responsible, not the killer (again, not in 100% of the cases but that's my general experience).
---
Head on apply directly to the forehead
---
Not exactly a toxic queue, but in my early days of Heroes Of the Storm I had problems with Internet and was DC'd from the match, which resulted in multiple reports and me getting into this 'leaver queue', holy hell, that place was the most cancerous thing I've seen in my 20 years of playing online games. Match was filled with people who intentionally and regularly DC, flame their team for their own faults, BM, feed, afk and generally lack skill themselves. Two thousand hours in game later, I never intentionally disconnected, but I did have problems with internet once again recently and had a pleasure to re-visit this wonderful place, experience was exactly the same.
---
Worst part is im that one guy that actually uses wake up
---
^thenk
---
You better apologize real fast
---
Meyers can stalk mid chase too though.
---
Once they fix the reveal, if you let him stalk you that's on you for not revealing him.
---
Just because there are stronger perks doesn't make it useless.
---
any killer that isn't as strong as the nurse is just as bad as Freddy I take it? No don't answer that, there are people who genuinely think  if they don't get a 4k every game it's because survivors are OP
---
But Meyers has to build way longer for an expose than ghostface does
---
I think you caught him having some "alone time" with his puppet.
---
When you try to do a sick head on play but they have iron maiden
---
*cleanses haunted grounds*  AW HELL NAW!
---
What a tweest
---
Well, consider that this is NOT Scream. It's just the same mask used in those movies.
---
Otherwise it would be called "The Scream Chapter" and not "The Ghostface Chapter"
---
Also why he has the new outfit and not the classic robes.
---
He hit you with Frenzy. He probably left you because someone else was around to go hit them.
---
It really depends on how safe they're playing. Some players try to provoke you but still play super safe. If they actually give me a legit shot to get them down quick I'll go for them
---
To be honest im considering doing this. Not bc i think the killer is OP (i just think his reveal mechanic needs tweaking) Its bc after around 50 games against GF, i can only point out 2 were i have had a decent to good experience against them.
---
This killer seemed to attract Every single toxic player to play them, i have been tbagged relentlessly and camped so many times that it just got tiring, I honestly thought he was gonna be one of my fav killers after he was leaked but he is p high up on my least favs now
---
And before you say anything let me clear somthings up, Yes. i main survivor, Do i tbag? almost never. Do i BM in general? i will point at my friends at the start of the game and meme with them for a bit. Do i deserve to be tbagged just bc im playing survivor and im "Whiny" like a lot of people call me? No, Why would you bc toxic to a survivor that has does nothing but try to do there job? 
---
i get it killers, you have it tuff. Getting tbagged and Bm'ed by survivors daily (even though every killer can BM and no one complains about it) But why are you being toxic to non toxic survivors? you legit just make them WANT to be toxic and that is what you hate right? Dont get it man
---
Just fuck GF in general
---
Then you should say that more clearly, because right now it comes across as a blanket statement.
---
"When a killer player does X they are an **asshole**" (implied: this is a fact and not an opinion)
---
it's not the strongest perk in the game but that short amount of time the perk saves you can mean the difference between "gate open" and "grabbed" if the game is close enough.
---
the perk is better off for newer players really since the 15% is a bit small, and they're more likely to use the "always see gates" part, but showing everyone else that you're opening a gate is really useful in non-SWF groups
---
Yeah it's annoying, but they're going to be fixing it this year I believe. In the third year anniversary stream one of their updates will allow parties to stay together between games.
---
SHINING JUSTICE
---
I can feel the pain of myers. Tried to do 4k tombstone achievement for so long and the last survivor always starts the locker game before dc :'l
---
This is why I love playing myers
---
That survivor was the biggest idiot I have ever seen I would of booked it if i that loud ass jet near me
---
Me playing against ghostface
---
I think he's more C tier. He gets 1000% clowned on in red ranks or vs any half decent SWF. Plus your power is completely is in survivors hands and he's not extremely stealthy.
---
under rated comment
---
What happened with peanits?
---
Yeah, you're an asshole for ruining the game. If you did it in kyf I'm fine with that and hell I'd probably play with you, but in public matches it's scummy.
---
I'm gonna change my thing
---
Yeah its bits like this that make me feel "dont hate the player, hate the game" but you have to be a piece of shit to destroy a game everyone queued for 15 minutes in under 2 minutes, and bhvr having these things in game after all this time, its mindblowing.
---
The problem is, everyone can and will point out a toxic survivor. but when killers needlessly tunnel and camp, a large portion of people just say "it's just part of the game!"
---
red rank survivors (real ones. not those who only managed to reach red ranks after Clown up until Plague) don't really bitch. i as both red rank killer and survivor bitch of how imbalanced survivors are because apart from fucked pipping rn survivors are more op than killers. and if you fail it's 50% your fault, 40% trash teammates and 10% cunt killers. that would be a red rank statistics cause most campers and tunnellers and imbecile teammates are below red.
---
so yeah, baby survivors bitch not actual red rank survivors.
---
I hate forming unfair profiles of players but jesus christ why does every single spirit tunnel lol, makes me sick.
---
Imagine the killer catches me while I'm in Sprint burst
---
Baby Meg gang
---
How is he like Legion? Am I missing something here?
---
The huntress' one true love is none other than dwight.
---
Huntress has pulled him out of so many lockers when she was just looking for hatchets, they just sort of bonded
---
Sometimes the add-ons are weird like that. 
---
Like, for instance, on Freddy, for my money, both Pill Bottle and Class Photo (purple) are WAY better than whatever his useless Ultra Rare one is that starts someone in Dream World.
---
Nothing wrong with throwing pallets and flashlighting. But if they were tea bagging then you have every right to camp
---
Right....
---
Add people who insult you in endgame chat after they found the hatch when you played fair and square.
---
in the scream movies, Ghostface is a late teenager in a mask and hooded costume who bloody runs at ya like a maniac with his raised knife. The game, however, went for a more Michael inspired gameplay.
---
Gameplay wise he just looks similiar with the animations and stuff I guess.
---
Ooooo yeahhhh
---
Well, they have masks and hoods, and the mask has a face, so that might be it
---
anywhere else, sure, but there's too much ambient noise in that one area
---
Combine that with not everyone being able to recognize ghostface's.. uh.. sounds yet
---
Yeah playing survivor stresses me out. But I'd rather have that than SWF where people inform you of everything
---
Both run the exact same way and wield Knifes the same plus they wear cheap looking masks.
---
i thought the plague doc would be very cool (forgot its name) But yea i love that scp, i think it would make for a cool addition that would bring a lot of new fans that does not have 2 be a massive license deal
---
Imagine saying 12 killers are top tier damn you don’t play killer at all do u?
---
Good point
---
Clown’s power is for chasing.
---
Another chase power mechanic would be cool but still would run into the main problem Clown suffers from, aside from the survivor you are currently dealing with, the other three have nothing really to worry about.
---
the people who say he can't be stealthy at high ranks have never been to high ranks. the same people who say wraith's invisibility is useless
---
As long as you know how to avoid LoS and you have no terror radius, it can be done.
---
When Legion came out he was basically a Ghostface. With this list I was thinking power wise fuck I feel stupid. Even I was going around saying yep Legions Dbds Ghostface and Trappers basically Dbds Jason.
---
Bruh mark your NSFW
---
I’m conflicted, I find it funny when I get t-bagged but it gets slightly annoying when I get slugged then just t-bagged the entire time
---
Yeah I had a daily as Piggy, the usual ambush attack on survivor. Got a Tbagging flashlight Meg and a Clicking Flashlight meg. Getting blinded after every pallet sure is annoying, but it's part of the game, it is what it is.
---
I'm more concerned about the apparent riot that's going on outside
---
Well he is getting 8% easier to spot in next patch which may not seem like alot but it kinda is so he will probably just become a M1 killer with basically no ability. survivors don't know how to counter him so that's could be why he is unenjoyable. to me he is a blast to play as and the way I play him is using his ability to locate and maybe get a stalk in then down survivors etc just play him like a normal killer. I personally think he will get weaker as time goes on as people get better against him and everyone is only saying they will main him because no one knows how to counter him giving them easy matches making him enjoyable.
---
L2p baby killer gg ez
---
You could see the joy in the baby huntresses eyes &lt;3
---
yes they know already
---
stop telling more people about the bug
---
Ignore pallets- Nurse
---
Vault Pallets- Legion 
---
Spirits power helps with Chasing/loops.
---
Glad I could be of assistance :)
---
should only really be a problem if your squad all has similar clothes on
---
You tripped her!
---
Thanx
---
I think Plague is currently bugged making people DC because of the Puke. This whole Patch messed everything up
---
yes.this.amazing.
---
thank youuuuu
---
it's the words of the nurse not me
---
This right where, flashlight saves are not toxic, it's a game mechanic. It's like if survivors complained about nurse blinking or clown using his bottles being toxic. And insta heals is not toxic too. It's unfair, same as anal beads or iridescent head, but you pay a lot bloodpoints to get one insta heal. Blaming people for using game mechanic that devs gave them to use is idiotic. And I do it myself, because it is frustrating as hell to play against campers and tunnelers, but IDK why people complain about playing swf idiots who all come to die if you down one of their friends. It's the most fun I have, people get hooked left and right, 0 gens are being done.
---
No its not even that. My game literally crashes upon loading up the results screen, everytime someone brings in a year 3 cake
---
Can they at least fix staring right at him in shack and it not breaking his stalk... literally every second match he's in one door im in the other looking and point and it doesn't break.
---
Agreed
---
He had a key
---
Ignoring the fact that they've already dropped the number of pallets on every map by half
---
Killer mains be like "What is brutal strength"
---
Thanks bro
---
Not bring a key
---
Fair enough just confusing because the meme says otherwise 😅
---
I escape probably 16% of my solo Q games (don’t depip almost ever, at worst just don’t, lots of gen and unhook action from me) but when I play with my only irl that has the game we escape 50% or more of the time and that’s just because of comms alone, SWF is so busted. I played against a 4 man of 4 toolboxes + addons on The Game map and they all burned the oak to make my hooks further away, absolute aids, a map I’m already bad at getting to hooks on now has 2 kids getting rid of all hooks and 2 kids running a train on my gens and they always all know my location because of comms. Feels soooo bad.
---
Doesn't say that anywhere...
---
I have to ask, what the fuck have you been guys doing for 1 minute and 40 seconds?
---
My guess would be that when the game tries to render in how many bloodpoints you receive it glitches out because the cake offers a unique precentage making it hard to register it then just adding 100+100
---
Don't let person wiggle off, just drop him on the ground, so they have to pick him up and waste time.
---
Yep, I spend the first 5 mins patrolling the gens and suddenly 3 pop simultaneously, really demoralising as killer :(
---
Maybe. It just sucks knowing that if I see that offering, the entire match is pointless. Might as well dc, tbh.
---
Lol I would put the Jake on a bed if there is one and guard him til he dies xD
---
This seems like self promo...i could be wrong though...
---
Do you have any background processes open/ do you alt-tab to another program while loading? if so, try closing everything you don't need. DBD doesn't seem to do well if anything else is using the CPU/ RAM, nor does it like changes in game focus
---
I doubt it.
---
As a 6' tall girl, it's true.
---
Mb then, sorry friend
---
Yea wish I could help more but all I got is theories. GAME THEORIES
---
"We removed hatch grabs" but added in something much worse
---
They would have been better off just removing the hatch. the only thing that change fixed was killers didn't have anything to complain about
---
This one in particular was just an ass about it, too. 
---
If they were the one that Mori'd the obsession immediately, they continued to down and hook the rest of us one by one. They'd phase back to the hook immediately when they saw one of us unhook. 
---
By the end, the were literally sitting on the boat just watching.
---
I decided to go for it and unhook my final teammate just because it was utterly obvious what they were doing and it was shitty.
---
I just don't get why people play that way. Just mindless nonsense.
---
That was mad not gonna lie
---
Go for it, but it’s hard to decide :)
---
That's good. Hopefully soon though lol
---
As far as I know, they check all ingame reports. They just said not to bother reporting for DC's and stuff cause they can already see that stuff on their end.  
---
Report away, they'll sift through the garbage
---
Probably not
---
Refunding Iridescent shards could lead to farming the Shrine of Secrets and getting perks and bloodpoints especially if the player has been playing a long time.
---
I’ve never seen a refund option for micro transactions in anything and bhvr would lose a lot of money if they refunded auric cells 
---
Maybe they could do a trade of cosmetics like giving up one for the spirit and they give you one for a different killer or a different cosmetic for the spirit but I honestly don’t think bhvr would think about that since they seem to churn out as many killers and survivors as possible right now. I think I would like switching out cosmetics like that but it would be a pain in the neck to implement that on console since you buy it through the ps store and whatever they have on Xbox.
---
Nah, just thought it was awesome
---
I thought it was funny OP
---
Yeah I give the survivor two chances. First wiggle is on the house, it's alright, you're scared. But if you wiggle again, I'll have to put you on the hook and mourn your passing :(
---
Sick tbh.
---
**Killers start acting extremely sweaty/ toxic**
---
**More survivors start running in SWF genrush groups**
---
*SurprisedPikachu.Jpg*
---
Incoming rant :
---
I sit here, chazing survivors near the basement where i hooked another survivor, hoping the guy im chasing goes to another place after i hit him sooo someone can rescue his ass but he stays near shack after i hit him.
---
And obviously they fucking yell that im a camper, tunneler like the fuck am i supposed to do if your dumbass friend/teammate refused to go to another place.
---
Seriously, dont fucking run around a hooked survivor while being chased, fucking lure the killer away from the hooked survivor, NOT THE FUCKING OPPOSITE!
---
(This is most of my matches but for some reason this shit is more common with ghostface)
---
And using red color to troll
---
I honestly decided I wouldn't I was going to but I like the one I have
---
But Ghosty-goo gets justice and that's what matters. Bc no 4 man SWF group is gonna escape a god Nurse
---
So many downvoted but honestly I agree, the Keanu memes are getting repetitive. (Yes, I know you’re all going to downvote my opinion or whatever.)
---
Found it in a chest. I guess I'm not supposed to pick up items out of chests so toxic of me.
---
Nea could finally be a true killer and giver herself a red stain
---
Also how did that other person get "adept bloody ghost face"
---
I bet the killer used Mori thinking you were 4 stack
---
So many exploiters...
---
Me too, but I wish I still had that mouse I had \~12 years ago. It had touch panel instead of wheel, you could scroll doing same action as if there was a wheel, but could as well just place finger on the edge and it would scroll indefinitely.
---
I want survivors to try and bodyblock, it means there are more injured survivors. I also want survivors to T-bag because they have to stop running
---
You have to be able to see 20% of his body to "see" him supposedly.
---
It would grow predictable real fast. 
---
Most killers would opt to disable an exhaustion perk. 
---
Most survivors would opt to disable Ruin or BBQ.
---
Did you just say survivors are more op than killers right now? Haha maybe before but not now they arent. Before they could bully the killer not so much anymore. Funny thing is. Before I ever even came to reddit, back when I would play killer and actually be good even when the survivors seemed so op felt good to kill them all. Bc it required a lot of skill to get them all. I didn't need to be told not to tunnel or camp, or told how to strategize to get a 4k. I didnt every single time obviously but I knew how.  That's before killers were getting handouts bc devs dont know who to listen to. Crying survivors or crying Killers. And the balance is going to keep going down hill the more they just keep switching power rolls. Killer should be over powered. That's the point. But the killer should be required to be smart and predict loops, survivor should know how to hide and loop. Theres the core balance.  But tweaking everything so much is more annoying than it is trying to adapt.  Still love the game but idk something just feels off. Havent payed much this season
---
Glad you finally learned ;)
---
wtf
---
Me.
---
They dont have to give the money back just the cells. But a cosmetic trade would be better since people would just trade clothes for a licensed killer
---
I imagine, but haven't DC'd yet, not on purpose. I've killed myself on a hook a few times already but that is not hating on the killer, but hating on my team and what they were doing at that moment. Knowing the killer will have more time hunting down those idle farming trolls, brings me joy
---
Got a 4k, although they were all rank 20 with no perks. And me being 16 with bbq.
---
&gt;They have to give a warning first
---
No they don't. It's a courtesy that they should do. But they don't have to.
---
Reminder that genrushing/ tunneling is also "in the game".
---
No, the devs did not meticulously plan out every single game mechanic for every single situation. There are tons of balancing issues in this game
---
I'm pretty sure it's always been like that
---
Too be fair, in n00bs video on the dedicated servers for survivors, he literally got hit from across a pallet, so it’s probably worse unless they changed it xD
---
Lmao! Thats an old ass bug!! It was known in like 2017!? I think it's a smart move from BHVR to add old bugs back into the game as for their anniversary lol it's also featured in one of the old videos of Samanimatio Dbd prody series. You should check them out if you haven't already!
---
I talk to friends in the meantime or just level something up, choose perks and ploop I'm in a lobby
---
I had a fair amount of games against him. I will be brutally honest. His power is so weird to play against. There are times where I see him in Night Shroud and can break him out of it by looking at him. All is well you know.
---
But then there are times where I am literally breathing down on his face and it doesn't break it. It is so annoying and it's just like..come on dude.
---
It’s also unplayable for killers as well. High ranks are full of survivors abusing the Wake up bug, so gens are done in 2 minutes with no counter play.
---
How is borrowed and decisive not enough with a group of friends? You guys rank 20? Lol
---
No problem &lt;3
---
Just use a mouse macro lol. The fact people slam their keyboard is insane
---
underrated comment
---
I think its stupid that the hatch takes too long to open when the 3rd survivor dies! It would've been satisfying if you had a key though. That's what I do when killers outrun me to the hatch lol
---
Should the people abusing the wake up bug be banned
---
Yes please
---
I share a birthday with the game and that makes me really fuckin happy lol
---
I save my T-baggi for killers that have been tunneling me/ other people.
---
When the gate opened one if us went down and since she didnt get a kill she started face camping so it was hard to save someone without going down
---
They look similar, but you can see a clear difference in the styles.
---
unless you run Dying light and a Mori
---
I just hate the new sound effect that they added when getting zapped. Shuuuugggg shuuuugggg
---
Truthfully as long as someone escapes i dont really mind being left on the hook, ill curse wildly when im being taken to it but otherwise im okay with it. A team win essentially i take it as.
---
"Hurr every single survivor is toxic hurrrrrr"
---
Yeah I totally agree and that’s a good idea about just refunding the auric cells instead of cash, it’s a good idea I just don’t think bhvr is in that mindset right now. You could try emailing them or something though that might get their attention
---
No clearly you didn't articulate it well if that's not the message. 
---
You're defending people who are knowingly abusing a game breaking bug by claiming it's no big deal when it absolutely is. When Legion had infinite mending, legion players were given a strict warning to not use the add ons for fear of being banned yet when wake up is bugged we still get dead silence.
---
Couldn't tell you, I'm consistently being revealed by survivors who are not stalkable or in view at all, completely hidden. Also getting revealed behind walls and have had the detection indicators not even show up about half the time, just the music cue. 
---
Look, I'm not saying they shouldn't fix bugs but that is most certainly not all they're doing. They're adding the pallet stun removing Night Shroud which makes sense thematically but is still quite a big nerf considering Shroud's cooldown.
---
I just want to know what they're going to do to help fix him in a positive sense as well. More consistent detection indicators, not getting revealed behind walls or other completely solid objects, reducing the noise he makes or at least make it non-directional so you can't just hear him coming like he's Huntress, etc. There's a lot of meaningful compensation they could do but somehow, I doubt it'll happen.
---
Just when you thought people couldn't get more uncreative and stupid with these lists
---
First off were assuming your team is useless, soooo no generators get done, how could a killer know where it is?  Also, skill has NOTHING to do with locating a random object in a random spot in the entirety of existence. You have the same chance to find that hatch as the killer does.
---
For the hatch to even spawn it requires that there is one more generator done than there are people left alive, even if gens get done, who says you cant find it first? It's not like killers are omniscient (I assure you, we arent).
---
Who cares if its selfish? You're playing solo survivor, you have no attachments to any of the other players so forget them, they're just steps on the ladder of your success if you let them be. If you want to play nice, play nice, if you want to survive, get good and carry your team, or relax and save yourself. I spent an entire week using Left Behind, do you think I flinched when people got hooked? Not at all, I broke totems and opened chests, and broke hooks.
---
Also, you dont need to survive to pip, so you could dig yourself out of that rank and all you need to do it get better at the game.
---
Автар ты сука?
---
The ENTIRE reason I bought ghost face. His power didnt need to be good for me to tbag, it's just a plus
---
 Doesn’t matter, ghost face tbag- DOH
---
Eliminating one survivor early is the most efficient way to slow down the overall repair speed of the survivor team.  Progressing on all 4 survivors at the same rate is like if survivors tried progressing all 5 generators at the same rate instead of focusing one at a time.  It's just a less efficient way to play.  Somehow survivors have got it in their head that killers playing in the most efficient way is toxic.
---
Dbd commenters ranked on whether they have a sense of humour or not
---
Has a sense of humour: us
---
Doesn't have a sense of humour: you
---
D tier: Freddy
---
Actually i would say true. Tunneling sucks. But 4 swf alle useing ds, borrow time, and prob mom cant really complain about tunneling. Sometimes killers notice swf before gamestart and they dont want to get bullyied thats why they start acting toxic. You prob use teamspeak or discord when playing with friends wat makes the game for the killer pretty hard. Dont get me wrong i dont blame you or anyone for playing with swf or all useing ds. Also i hate when the killers tunnel me. But there are always 2 sides
---
Doc with Nurse... the scream she hits them
---
The patch that came with Ghostface ruined my frame rates.
---
I usually am able to play Ultra with 60/FPS easy, but after the new Update I was sitting around 38-52/FPS on Medium quality.
---
I recommend people learn how to edit the GameUserSettings and adjust the Resolution/Fullscreen/Vsync to your computers liking. I fixed my issue with Ghostface by disabling my Vsync, and now I sit at 62/FPS on Ultra just fine.
---
It’s an easy way to make the game look better too. I find it interesting watching Twitch Streamers using the fuzzy, choppy native resolution. Makes it way harder to see.
---
So you're not against tunneling, but you are against camping.  Sounds fine to me.
---
Is this a shop or did Scooby Too actually have a Myers knockoff?
---
entity displeased
---
I agree with everyone where you gotta watch people, but a tip I will give us stay as close too wale as possible.  The smaller the loop the less likely the killer will catch up. It may not seem like a big difference, but it could mean the difference between a hit or not. The people I watched are N00b_3, Tru3, and Monto. They are all good survivors and you can learn a lot from watching them.
---
They need to remove the directional sound cue then. There's too much cover on most gens which means you have to get in close but then you announce exactly where you are with that directional sound. 
---
The only maps that feel like they work for Ghost Face are maps like Asylum or Ormond's or the Temple, with a large central structure that has an upper level. That does work really well with him and you can just drop out of nowhere as they run around looking for you at ground level.
---
/summon DBD_PizzaDwight
---
They're just used to survivors being assholes and abusing literally bugged perks or features. Which they do. It's just a consequence of constant toxic behaviour from both sides. Too late to stop the cycle anyway.
---
So play like your on LSD, got it.
---
Meh, I've had a bunch of killers bring me to the hatch and then mori me, the hatch nerf didn't really change a whole lot
---
If it’s about a perk I think they would but fair enough. But like I said they won’t just right out ban ppl using it unless this will be the first time they have ever did that
---
Regardless there is bug abuse here and it should be banned. Idc if it's an add on, a perk, or a killer. It's still cheating
---
You use your ears to hear their foot steps and follow them.
---
Legit. I have found 5 perks that are currently broken in some form.
---
Have you seen what happened in r/pewdiepiesubmissions ? People are harassing and sending death threats to a literal 9 year old because he didn’t know who Keanu was and thus didn’t think highly of him.
---
That all sounds like good stuff. I've only played against him so I don't have any kind of perspective as to what it's like to play AS him.
---
But something's gotta give. I just had my last match of the night. And what do you know, another face to face meeting with nothing in between us where I can't reveal him and get marked/downed instead.
---
I mean clearly both sides are complaining right now so they've got to make SOME changes, right?
---
The flashlight visual effect isn't even bad.
---
It used to just be a completely bright white light.
---
I mean, if you know about it you shouldn’t abuse it. But I agree they should disable the perk at least.
---
Lots of SWF groups are rude yeah. When I played with friends, it happened too. He's a nice guy, but when he gets hit he's like "WHAT HOW DID THAT HIT ME?!" and I sigh...stop acting shocked, you made a mistake and got punished, get over it lol I honestly prefer playing solo.
---
Then there is the 'bad killer' 'ez' 'boosted' 'kys' etc people. They gang up on you and rage together. Much friends. What cracks me up is when you Survivor B is angry at you because you killed his buddy Survivor A. It's like that typical action movie where one of the good guys dies, but unlike the movies, you as a bad guy gets away with it, leaving the viewer frustrated (which is Survivor B) It makes me laugh.
---
But the BEST orthodox SWF that I've seen....was made of the nicest people known to dbd
---
His power currently is incredibly on the fritz, so he can be frustrating to play against. Imagine playing against trapper, disarming his trap, and then being caught by the unarmed trap.
---
You get your chase points after a hit, not when you down them
---
Same case but survivor point of view
---
Go stomp the hatch. It’s what I do.
---
I got to disagree but fair enough. But I doubt they will like I said they never did for tinker or sloppy and sloppy would literally crash the game lol
---
I did this too, it’s great how altruism can screw you over sometimes xD
---
It happens more or less depending on how fast the gens are popping, and in what region. May the entity help anyone in the European region, with all the asian players
---
I think they should. Bc it's clear the people abusing this bug are exploiting glitches to get an advantage. 
---
That's cheating by definition
---
You have to also aim your actual camera to center on his face. Just running at him or pointing won’t do anything. Standing directly next to him won’t boost you getting it. Standing next to the killer will likely kill you. Not saying it’s consistent as it should be but people need to actually figure out how it works.
---
Fair enough
---
bug fixing takes time
---
I rely on stealth, if I am seen I'm meat on a hook :(
---
Why should you need functioning legs to use a key for something on the floor? Using a flashlight and toolbox on the ground would be hard to do and would require actual animations, but a key doesn’t, and a key makes sense.
---
they have tools to track this stuff, the same way they tracked legions abusing the knife combo
---
TIL Clown has been gifted by Papa Nurgle
---
It really is the only joke they can come up with and it’s never been funny
---
the legion bug was game breaking, the 15% speed boost is very bad but not that bad
---
Because you wouldnt have the strength to lift the hatch open and crawl into it.
---
It doesn't, that's entirely false.
---
Are you talking about the one at the exit gate
---
You ran at them from the open.
---
to use a stealth character, you have to *gasp* try to be stealthy
---
You're both not getting enough upvotes, because as you can see I made this joke an eternity ago myself as a whole post, and got vote bombed into the ground by survivors saying "iT DoEsNt StOp YoU fRoM bEiNg TrAsH"
---
Those are pretty much the only killers I play. Cause no help with chase? Longer chase, longer loop, more pallets to eat, I hate it
---
stalk survivors that don't know you're there. Don't be afraid to change targets.
---
Yeah, I agree. I just hope bhvr keeps tweaking because they have a tendency to just leave things for a long time.
---
Assuming the worst without cause
---
You sound like you expect them to make him glow
---
To clarify on this technique, the chainsaw has to be activated and in motion. If it’s still charging they can just let go and then most likely get the locker grab.
---
Oh my god, this is ***GLORIOUS***!
---
Btw luckperks and offerings are pretty much useless atm. They dont effect chests, hitboxes or anything else. The only thing effected by luck perks is a higher chance of freeing yourself from the hook.
---
Killer move faster, can slug and look for hatch so no not the same chance. Hatch open and close instantly after it open 95% of time. Hitboxes are broken so killer can land bs hits, camp, and derank me. I don't play enough to rank up but when I did i ran into killers losing on purpose to derank.
---
Or if they go within 30cm of a wall - explode mid flight
---
After hiding in a locker for 3 seconds, leaving it while holding sprint exhausts you and stuns the killer if they are nearby
---
EZ. So good that you didn't even need the other survivors.
---
Keanu has nothing to do with that. It's PewDiePie's army of 6 year olds
---
But the survivors on console are straight trash all the way until Rank 4 or so, so at least it’s fine I’m that way.
---
It’s because you wrote the Ghostface achievement, confusing the way you wrote it.
---
Killer gets way more BP than survivors, especially if you run BBQ and chilli (a leatherface perk). I would also suggest waiting until you get a character to prestige 3 before you try to get all perks on them.
---
I know, but something about your post showing someone saying that Keanu sucks then getting morid really reminds me of the kid getting doxed and filled with threats, get what I mean?
---
AFK all game? Why? if you're that stressed out, take a quick break from dbd and play another-
---
I'm not finishing that sentence, I don't want to be mocked like poor McCote
---
I mean at least they get the points, so it’s all good. Besides, I’m not AFK, I still walk around and stuff
---
Yeah, I’ve been the last Survivor alive due to me using Premonition/Spinechill a lot, and the amount of times I get teabagged for almost my whole duration of bleedout timer, and THEN hooked, only to be teabagged some more?
---
Annoying.
---
I'd barely call that fixing the sounds, they just made everything 10x louder
---
I think its reasonable but i do like the cosmetic trade since its strictly cosmetics
---
It’s always fun getting spammed with “kill your self” or some other toxic garbage they spew out of their mouths. I swear to god, toxic survivors are compensating for something with their larger than ever and precious egos.
---
I think it being Plague is much more realistic. Every Plague crash story is at the end, when the results would show up. It might not be her itself that causes it, but it has something to do with her, I believe.
---
if you play efficiently, the 15% difference is all you need
---
You must be getting lucky then, it seems I almost always find SWF
---
I've thought about it, and it's not so much when to shock, but I can't make them scream when I want them to. It seems like I'm shocking for an eternity before the survivor screams, and by that time I've been so focused on shocking I've probably forgot to place myself correctly during the loop to hit them. I don't know what my issue is with this or how to fix it.
---
Thanks for the breakdown and tips, by the way.
---
but you're not really playing the game either
---
Thank you for this post. This like brings a tear to my eye.
---
Sorry, for all the camping, the tunneling, I have my reasons lol. I used to be nice but repeated tbagging, flashlight clicking and chat insults made me cold. I'm not going to change this, but yeah sorry to you because nice survivors get punished too. If I knew I'd face you, I'd treat you a little differently
---
This is, as I said, just salt
---
Not as bad as spirits though :P
---
I generally play survivor so maybe my thinking is biased...
---
But what you're saying is correct. I get that slows the other team down. I notice how much easier the game is as killer when someone d/c's or suicides on their first hook. 
---
But do you also understand why survivors (Specifically the one getting camped/tunneled) might think that's a scummy move? 
---
As a survivor, I realize how stuff I can do would make a killer angry or annoyed. If I tbag or click my flashlight, it's done deliberately to taunt the killer.
---
But it's like a lot of killer mains don't even understand how something they do could make a survivor angry or annoyed. I made a shitpost once calling out a killer who tunneled me and someone literally told me it's bad gaming etiquette to not respect their "play style." 
---
Kinda rambly but while I understand killers have to kill, I wish they'd own up to it when they use scummy methods that ruin games for individual survivors. There's at times this weird belief that killers literally can't be criticized because they're the bad guys in the game that I just think is a bunch of BS.
---
One idea I had was a killer who functions like the trapper, but the traps are placed a fixed distance in front of the killer (like 15/20 meters) survivors caught in these snares wouldn’t be full on trapped, but stuck for a second or two. The killer can’t yank a survivor out of the snares but it opens them up for an easy hit.
---
Lmao! I tried it 3 times and it didn't in all of them lol
---
Just..
---
ignore them..?
---
Hopefully if we all complain loud enough they'll tweak him quickly. They sure nuked MoM pretty rapidly.
---
Hey i mean atleast you got 2 WGLF stacks
---
lmao quintin is just a sleepy dwight
---
I only teabag survivors who teabag me first. But i love playing as him, I find him pretty powerful. Even when i have a bad start i can usually pull off 3-4 kills. As survivor, going against him usually results in most of us escaping. The only time it doesn’t is when my team can’t loop or The Ghost Face is tunneling/ camping.
---
finish him
---
It helps you against many killers and gives you a lot of information. It shows you what the killer is up to. It takes practice to decipher what certain ways of flashing mean, but it’s very rewarding once you get used to it
---
Spine Chill and Dark Sense have helped a lot against him, as well as people running Kindred when hooked. Sometimes revealing him can be a bit annoying, but he is overall not incredibly challenging. I have a lot more of different opinions on him, but I'm not going to get to into it, as it'd take too much time. But, all I can say is, the influx of GF has died down for me, and I'm happy about it. Back-to-back-to-back has been annoying, especially with the tunneling GF, and even facecamping at one point. Made me laugh that they'd play GF like that, out in the open and just staring at me struggling, but whatever.
---
Hate speech =/= talking shit
---
They're called perks for a reason
---
FYI The huntress and David are free for everyone and every platform and has always been free,
---
Nurses on console are booty
---
Yeah you can
---
Wait what is this bug. I keep seeing people mention it but haven’t heard of or seen it.
---
Yup.
---
Pathetic.
---
I died :D
---
You have to force them to farm with you but at the same time not let them do gens
---
Fewer brown-tier items in each bloodweb, it's very noticeable at p3
---
I'd recommend that you don't put any bp into a character past level 50 until they're p3, since you lose everything when you prestige
---
"why am i exposed i was looking right at him!' thats the majority of my matches with him
---
Even if they were, I'd rather just have people leave. I'm not that worried about another 500 points or whatever.
---
i guess i had to specify. (mind me, i don't take instasaw Billy and Nurse for consideration because once you've learned Nurse and play her consistently - survivors have no chance. instasaw Billy is braindead. it is extremely rare to find an insanely good team that is able to make you m1)
---
&gt;4 decent to good high rank survivors with meta perks will fuck up a killer of their level of skill and experience. even 3 good red rank survivors with 1 potato will fuck up the killer if they don't mess around and play smart. 
---
&gt;swf is still most op thing unless killer plays dirty.
---
i also was a killer main during vacuum, double pallets, old bnp, instablinds, infinites. and i haven't been on reddit at that time and never thought survivors are op literally because i haven't played much of survivor and those times i did play i was of low rank and thought killers are fukin op. that was up until i got to red ranks and actually learned to play survivor. after that i saw how hard it is to play killer lol. cause surviving was so much easier and it still is. then Clown chapter came with survivor nerf. first i felt sad cause had to adapt again but i started to play more survivor and even by now unless you get potato teammates or cunt of a killer - the power is on your side and it's so much easier to play survivor than killer. i say that now being literally rank 1 survivor at this very moment. and i'm actually rank 6 killer cause was de-ranking to get Adept Ghostface which nearly impossible on red ranks not only because of better survivors you face but also because of stupid requirements.
---
Yeah, I don't teabag outside of the normal thanks or greetings, but a survivor teabagging a killer doesn't make them have to sit there and not play for 2 minutes like some of the saltier ghostfaces can do. I'm not sure it's an apt comparison. I've been teabagged when killing a lot, and I'm not entirely sure why it bothers people so much either, more often than not it makes them lose out on distance they could gain.
---
I think you can already do that. You can at least refund characters bought via shards or auric cells
---
Since bear traps absolutely mangle a person’s leg, even if you escape, you still have a bloody stump where your ankle used to be
---
It pisses me off when they all rush the hooked guy and yell "camper." Like why tf would I leave when yall dumbasses are still here ?
---
Take note on the complete lack of a response. I'm mocking the guy for making a stupid generalization. If you have something worthwhile to say, say it now or forever hold your salt.
---
I'm guessing it has limited keyboard and mouse support. Maybe down the line they'll add crossplay and support keyboard and mouse all the way. Would make killers like nurse and huntress more viable.
---
They made the Xbox version by copying the PC code and changing some things. They just didn’t remove the mouse and keyboard interface.
---
He kinda sucks ass
---
I remember sloppy butcher was bugged for wraith during Christmas time and people were using it to make it so where the blood effect kept stacking which ended up tanking everyone's fps. It's funny how these things happen. I'm sure they won't ban people for using it.
---
Show some **LAG**
---
First, it's not a stupid generalization, at least every 2 games there's survivors t-bagging, denying it is being ignorant purposefully. 
---
Second, you had nothing worthwhile to say either, so keep your pitiful advices for yourself
---
I only watch to see the PBE content I'm missing out on, then I go again
---
From what I heard they got the license for the mask so I think if they change his attire apart from the mask they should be able to.
---
Oof
---
Yeah it’s a bug. When it happens the survivors can’t wiggle or heal others too
---
I first read this as "Hi, I'm the dyslexic  David of brother"
---
I tried it just to test it out... it’s legit like an infinite toolbox
---
Every 2 games still means there are games where survivors don't T-bag, as in not 100% of all survivor. Also mockery is entirely worthwhile, you ignorant lil shit. "You're not allowed to point out the stupid things people say because  don't like it!1!" Take this time to reflect before you make another stupid comment.
---
I totally agree with you. The whole objective of this game was to bring you the experience of being in a slasher horror film situation.
---
However, devs themselves ruined it when they made sprint burst such an OP perk initially and that gave survivors a better option of running and teasing killers instead of hiding like they were supposed to.
---
About slower killers like Hag and Freddy I totally agree that there must be balance brought to the Generators to match their speeds. 
---
A killer should be able to make one complete round of the map before a gen is completed by a single survivor. However, that's not the case in respect to like half or more of the killers.
---
Also SWF needs a nerf mechanism. That has been one of the single most prominent reason to take away the intimidating persona of the killers.
---
They CANNOT DO THAT. Their code doesn’t allow for that. 
---
They can edit the shrine, because the game asks their server “hey man, what perks should I display?”
---
They can’t disable perks, because you just pick your perks and that’s it. No server included. You can even pick killer perks on survivor and vice versa (but that will get you banned instantly because they have a list of all perks ran by everyone on different characters and auto-report set up once it detects it)
---
Making the game ask their server “hey dude, what perks are available?” Would take AT LEAST 4 months of REWRITING THE ENTIRE GAME.
---
Well, true :D
---
KNIVES CANT GO THROUGH WINFOWS YOU FOOLS!
---
15% bonus to all action speed

[Wait, does this mean we can actually talk about Pig without the moronic shit filling up the comments?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHQLQ1Rc_Js)

Yes.
---
I can hear that last image
---
You can save SB in one way ;) Saw some posts that Remember me speeds up gates opening but when I saw somebody using it on one stream against a streamer, they were opening gates slower so I don't know if it's confirmed. Play with your food gives you a stack if you down the obsession.
---
I agree man. And I'm also on console by the way. And I feel it still needs work. Like why isnt wiggle spamming l2 and r2 or square and x. Not circling the analog. Idk I'm just ranting now. But I feel ya
---
If you don’t want camped survivors to DC just go ahead and safe them :)
---
Once you connect to the killer, the game forgets you are a group. That’s why you’re not thrown into one lobby after the match. They are fixing that with dedicated servers so they might add them later
---
Weird that it would show the interface when moving the mouse but it doesn't actually move the cursor
---
I do agree with killers that people who are very obviously abusing it should be banned. Problem is you can't just ban anyone who's been using it because then you're gonna get some innocent players caught in there too. Honestly The perk SHOULD just be disabled for now, would be the best thing to do here.
---
Complete opposite for me. My rule is never harm a Quentin. They are too precious to me!
---
Permanent Tinkerer 2
---
Also, not a perk, but double blade Legion
---
Wait are you serious!! I was wondering why all my stuff has been faster. I’ve never once had a build without wake up tbh! So I never took it out, why am I just now learning this but I’ve been playing with wake up since it came out. How long has it been that way?
---
Ah yes ok cuz pig is apparently leagues above trapper. Don’t see that bud
---
DBD mobile has higher priorities, thats why all my friends (including myself) stopped playing.
---
Honestly from my experience it's all fun and games until the green/purple rank squads from hell that derank themselves on purpose show up.
---
I'm over here playing a mid-tier killer with common/uncommon add-ons trying to have a fun match and these abominations with syringes and purple flashlights gotta test my resolve.
---
I imagine if we had a vampire killer, their power would be a set of chase abilities that become unlocked when chasing a bleeding survivor. I won't be surprised if the next killer has a power like that, since the current meta is all about ignoring heals to focus gens. Doesn't help that Legion and Plague exist.
---
Lol yeah it's not meant to be limited to ghost face although most people are taking it that way haha.
---
It effects all actions, not just exit gates. I wouldn’t use it though since the devs are considering banning people for exploiting it.
---
They know who’ve been using it before and who just started. When the match starts, your perks get saved and sent to their server to join the data they have on your way of playing
---
Get dunked on.
---
*gen pops right infront of killer*
---
nea: urban evasion: 100
---
killer: huh must have been the wind
---
It gives you all action speed. This also includes things like vaulting
---
It actually gives you 15% all action speed. It also includes things like vaulting windows
---
It looks like whenever you get hud status (bloodlust, haste, exposed) your frame rate drops to 0
---
Look ma, I'm on TV
---
What platform?
---
The devs said if they can walk on two legs then it’s fair game meaning we can get werewolf killer plz
---
Am I the only one who believes Legion needs a buff, wish they brought back the 4 different characters you can swap between and they just made it more balanced, just me or....?
---
Being near hooked survivors, decreases your chase emblem. So dont camp if you want to rank up.
---
Lol, it’s just one of those moments
---
“Oh... well, GG fuck me”
---
PC
---
r/whoooosh
---
They are comfortable with only doing Humanoid characters and will only do that. But maybe latter in the future they may change it up. But dbd seems to be more slasher then bug flicks. 
---
Also with creating licensed killers it’s hard to make a great mechanic that suits the killer. The best thing they know of for stealth is stalking, hidden terror radius and crouching. Which I think they might’ve gotten the license last minute? 
---
I don’t know it just seems they spent less time on Ghostface and slapped together a power to give the fans what they wanted. Maybe next licensed killer will be more interesting. 
---
Like Samara or Hellpriest (pinhead).

Yup, it's similar to the hag traps. If every single fountain is used up, they will all revert back to clean and you will be given Corrupt Purge regardless of your proximity to the fountains.
---
This comment made my night.
---
yes
---
That would be very counterintuitive. They changed it in the first place because it was just a free Escape, which is what the design you stated would be. Now it is an anti tunneling perk, though the timer could be made a little longer.
---
Congratz, now you need all Perks on every Killer! :D
---
Wait is this the guy that did the RBT testing?
---
Werewolf and Vampire killer would definitely be cool. Or a rotting Corpse.
---
Maybe a Scarecrow with a Scythe.
---
Jesus go shower
---
Damn that was super fast bro. I'm hella slow on the perk grind
---
Odd Bulb is just a straight up strobe that fucks up the killer's eyes.
---
Identity V is a mobile game but it may have the variety you seek. Also, the devs are only limited by their imagination and technical ability, so yes very limited
---
Plague is bugged rn. Dont know why but 9/10 matchesni play as her I DC at the end. Doesnt happen with GF or huntress. Just plag.
---
&gt;But do you also understand why survivors (Specifically the one getting camped/tunneled) might think that's a scummy move? 
---
Scummy?  No.  Unfun for the survivor getting tunneled?  I can absolutely understand.  But their fun is not my responsibility.  Winning is my responsibility, and since no one seems to care about survivors being on discord together or running meta perks and generally playing in the optimal way for winning, then I think it's a horrible double standard for the expectation to be that killers gimp their gameplay so that survivors can have fun.
---
I shouldn't have to play in a less-efficient way so that other people can have fun.  Making sure the survivors have fun is the LAST thing on my mind when I have to constantly deal with 4 man SWF with meta perks and purple items + addons.  Why do survivors get to play in the 100% optimal way while if killers do, then it's considered toxic?  How about everyone gets to play in the 100% most optimal way?  Gen rushing isn't toxic.  Tunneling isn't toxic.  Both are literally the most effective strategies for each side.  
---
&gt;As a survivor, I realize how stuff I can do would make a killer angry or annoyed. If I tbag or click my flashlight, it's done deliberately to taunt the killer.
---
These don't help you win the game and the only purpose is to troll.  You literally have to make a conscious decision to do this and it doesn't help the survivor side win at all, whatsoever.  Hardly something that can be compared to tunneling.
---
&gt;But it's like a lot of killer mains don't even understand how something they do could make a survivor angry or annoyed.
---
Hitting a survivor on the hook?  yes.  I could see why since the only purpose is trolling.  But tunneling is literally just trying to win the game.  You can tunnel without intending to troll.  It's called playing efficiently.  It's more beneficial for the killer to get someone out of the game then go after the uninjured survivor that's never been hooked.  No big deal, just queue up for another game.  You don't have to wait for the game to be over.  I am not responsible for the survivor's fun.  Don't try to make killers responsible for the survivor's fun.  They seriously have enough to worry about as it is.
---
&gt;Kinda rambly but while I understand killers have to kill, I wish they'd own up to it when they use scummy methods that ruin games for individual survivors. 
---
Again, their enjoyment of the game is not my responsibility or concern.  The best way to not get tunneled is to make yourself a target that is unattractive to tunnel.  Be harder to catch or harder to find and you won't get tunneled.  If you do get tunneled?  Then nbd, you can literally queue up for another game as soon as you die.  If killers playing in the optimal way is toxic, then running self care and urban evasion is toxic because they don't consider the killer's fun.
---
I think people just look into it way too hard as taunting and treating everyone like the enemy. I am used to being bullied but that experience just wasted my time. No survivor teabag drags a game like that, though its still BM regardless.
---
I knew I was dead and wouldn't get hatch and I accepted that, no point dragging it out. Of course, I complain about behaviour like that and it's apparently "being salty over just desserts". Makes zero sense.
---
My first ever game as survivor was against Huntress, which was extremely weak, but when I first saw her I screamed on my whole home, everybody was upset later
---
i think this bug has a game.
---
Yep but instead of getting all the perks for me it was prestiging him fully. I imagine getting all perks  is more difficult by a slight bit and this is pretty impressive he managed to get all the perks
---
Only for 9.99$
---
Hmm I use OoO so I dont think i can participate in the non toxic survs.
---
It’s reddit I guess
---
Yeah, something like that
---
Hoping for a Necromorpth
---
I currently have my ghost face p3 lvl 46
---
Is the same not true for add-ons and offerings, which the devs can and do disable?
---
It's funny because the wooshing sounds make him almost even worse than your average C tier. Can't really mindgame people if they can pinpoint exactly where you are. Sucks that it even happens out of stealth.
---
I have been struggling with Ghostface release due to a fear of him I had as a kid and I was panicking pretty bad. My friend I play with protects me from him whenever he can and tries to gesture when he's coming to give me a chance to leave. I am getting better at dealing with my anxiety knowing I am not alone. Thanks, man.

They're horror character designed to be horrifying and people can still make them sexy somehow...
---
I mean I understand for the survivors but seriously the killers ? I mean yeah, some are more attractive than other but the problem remain the same.
---
My friend who was the last survivor remaining (I had to leave because the exit gates were almost done and 1 is better than none) got downed near the hatch by a Huntress. I could already tell she was going to close it on him and she did. 
---
My friend got off and I played Myers with Scratched Mirror and got 3/4 survivors hooked. Found and downed the 4th guy and brought him over to the hatch. They honestly deserved it for being a good survivor.
---
Any killer mains like myself out there: Try to let the last guy get the hatch once in a while if you're carrying him. Especially if he's a good survivor.
---
Ricardo Milos
---
Could not have said it better myself. I know that the devs have been talking about reworking freddy for a long nine now. I hope to see it sooner rather than later.
---
Moo
---
Am starting to regret p3ing Quentin instead of ace :/
---
I don't think you understand how little of a life I have and how many cakes I have on him now
---
Definitely more on survivor side though
---
I find him very hard to spot and he gives me anxiety. Aside from the occasional bleed out teabag it's been okay, I guess. Sometimes goofy ones have been helping me get used to him.
---
Would rather vs Myers and Freddy though. Haven't had a Freddy since GF release.
---
Thanks bud 👍
---
I'd change the order of the Killers in the tiers themselves, but putting that aside it's a fairly good list.
---
Well atleast you understand the concept of mockery, but you don't seem to understand what exagguration/ hyperbole is, since you just use it poorly.
---
The person I was responding to **literally** said that **all** survivors T-bag constantly. It's fine if you didn't actually read the comment I was responding to, small mistakes like that happen all the time. I'm sure you will do better in the future
---
Oh no nonono. I do it ironically. I hate him
---
Up the ante PogU
---
I dont look forward to it as mainly killer player, i cant have better connection with the game then when im a host. Even small lag will make playing a killer a lot worse and let's face even if the servers will be really good and there wont be any lag it will take months if not years.
---
Does that mean I should play Dwight? :(
---
But I need to grind more ;-;
---
Not really. Someone getting mori'd in a game as a joke (like all those people name themselves Mori me daddy and Mori = dc.) But I *guess* I see where you're coming from
---
Nice! I really like his whole p3 outfit
---
Be careful, he's a hero
---
Yep I can tell you have no life. Who do you actually main though I'm curious.

I was trying to pair the p3 mask with the 1080 auric cell outfit but I was very sad when I saw the mask doesn’t have as much blood as I thought it would

It’s stupid, I know. You’re all good :)
---
My "Main" go to when I want to win will always be Nurse but who I am having fun with right now is Legion Plauge and my personal favorite build and personally named for said build, Yeet Spirit
---
Had Identity V in the back of my mind, but never played it and it's pretty much for mobile only, obviously it would be great if some of the ideas of the game would spread over to DBD.
---
[SCP-049](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-049). The plague doctor
---
I don't really care about the perk at all. If it goes too fast I just change strategy. More tunneling, more camping, it is what it is.
---
they can't disable anything. they disabled moons with a patch, by force locking them out of existance and other than that, they can't do anything like this. they can't hotfix it either as perks weren't even made to be disabled and that'd go out of the "hotfix" realm by console patch review system's standards.
---
Yes it's noticable, but are you really gonna tell me that it's worse than 1+ minute mend time?
---
I want female naked killer or surviver
---
Heh, I guess it's a fair point.
---
I never said I supported chasing one specific survivor the whole time. You’re putting words in everyone’s mouth and misrepresenting what they’re saying
---
Ah good choices well I'm maining Ghostface as he is just enjoyable and I'm running a slug build kinda with him.
---
A scarecrow yes plz
---
Where the fuck have you been
---
Your neglecting the point of the video... Smh.

Why does that matter? Why compare game breakibg unfair exploits for the sake pf pushing whatever agebda your tied to? They are both and cant stay.
---
Get that sin out of this Christan game
---
Man ive watched it when i was around 5 yo
---
its more useful than an empty perk slot maybe, but there are sooo many perks that are better than it, making it garbo
---
I love how I was downvoted for asking about a bug I wasn’t aware of. Thanks reddit. And thank you for telling me.
---
but as level III:50? and all 3 ranks per perk?
---
&gt; But there definitely has been a shift in power from the killer to the survivors.
---
Objectively not true. I feel people who say things like this don't actually remember what this game was like a year ago or even further back when there was no blood lust, legit infinites, and hooks didn't respawn. This game used to be crazy broken for survivor and is FAR better now. Even in the last year the majority of the nerfs have gone to survivors (as they needed to).
---
As for the 3 killers you want buffed, one of them has a complete rework coming out soon and another has the highest kill rate.
---
Didn't mean to say all of the killers are like that. But a lot are ungrateful and it's impossible to know how it will end :/
---
*Mayonnaise
---
no its in the lower area, its a pallet that leads to a literal dead end next to a forklift or something, the survivor drops the pallet behind them and they literally cant run anywhere except the way they came.
---
I won’t, thank you for explaining it. I’ve literally been downvoted for asking about it because I hadn’t heard of it before tonight. Also I wasn’t aware anyone actually even used wake up anymore lol.
---
pretty god Job so far.
---
3 years for a basic feature, - nah lets release mobile first.
---
I think pc survivors are equally as trash, so many boosted animals in high ranks that got carried there by swf
---
The thread title accurately described me when I clicked on that.
---
Ohh yea i know which one you are talking about. I think that area can be opened if you finish the gen near it.
---
"Safe Hook Rescue" as you're being impaled lol
---
Just remember she is a 4 year old
---
Bet it was a legion
---
The Hag? xD
---
Yes Sir, I am P3 Lvl 50 and that is all perks lvl 3 hence why its all on page 4 :)
---
So did you do that? No offense
---
If you're alone on this, I'm quitting DBD  lol
---
As for killer, yeah it triggers me when survivors don't 'respect my presence' or would challenge me with the tbagging and clicking -&gt; They get the tunnel and camp, seems just to me lol I don't really enjoy camping, but it does feel good to see those people be sacrificed.
---
As for survivor, if the killer sees me, I'm usually caught so, stealth is my only way of survival. I still get very anxious and nervous when playing survivor like when it was my first time playing DBD. It hasn't changed :) But I prefer playing killer, cause survivor stresses me out cause I'm such a scaredycat
---
Facing SWF should award some bonus bloodpoints to the killer. like 5 - 15 % depending on how many people were in SWF. You are at a huge disadvantage compared to a solo queue and get nothing for it but t-bagging and pointing.
---
Sure that's what she says, but it's a bullshit cover reason. I've been rank 1 survivor as long as I can remember playing mostly late at night and still never get the same killers every game. Not even the same actual killer, there's still decent variety.
---
Yeah, of course they can't stay. I'm just trying to say that it's logical that they aren't banning people for the wake up! Glitch, but did ban people for the double blade glitch. The Legion glitch broke the game way more extremely than the Wake up! You also have to realise that it's way more likely that you accedentally equip wake up! Than it is that you accidentally play legion with double blades addons
---
Use F
---
It's nearly been a month W H E R E
---
Well if you want to run the same meta perks, be my quest. I like you switch up my perk builds so I'm slightly stronger is other areas. gotta stay unpredictable
---
I'm afraid so
---
Hag to A tier, GF to C or D tier, Doctor, Trapper and Legion to F tier, Freddy to D tier, Plague to low B tier IMO.
---
He can have perks that reduce the distance you need to be to reveal him, so it's important to remember that.
---
If you're infront of him you also can't reveal him when he's leaning. He can also duck and weave behind cover to fuck you up.
---
Following him can help, but I honestly wouldn't care about revealing him unless he's after you.
---
He has a range to be spotted, it's pretty huge though. Try getting closer.
---
How many bloodpoints does that take? I’ve been trying to get all the perks on all my killers but its taking forever so far and I’ve only managed it in two of them, nearly 3.
---
It doesn't matter about ranking up, it makes killing everyone a ridiculously easy thing to do. It even counters DS. Down one person hook them, wait for them to be unhooked, go back, down the injured survivor again, mori. GG now its already a 3v1 and there's nothing a survivor can do about it.
---
For this exact reason the green mori is still broken as shit, just because of how fast you can make the game a 3v1. At that point it's easy going. Cutting it from 4 to 3  gets rid of (at the low end) 33% of gen progression assuming you will be chasing 1 survivor at all times. When that person is hooked there is at BEST 2 people doing a gen since one will be trying to save, let alone if multiple people are trying to save or one is already being chased. Now you take that down to a 3v1. At BEST 1 person is doing a gen in a 3v1 when someone is hooked. Making the game a 3v1 that early is op as fuck.
---
I- I don't understand.. you're supposed to argue with me, not.. I uh.. Have a nice day..?
---
95% sounds about right... but not really I'll assume you're making a point but please numbers are often factual or at least offer a chance at fact. You're speaking opinion. Theres a difference and in a discussion, stick to what you know, not what you feel.
---
Yes, killers move faster, sure they can find the hatch, but even then, your game isnt over. Killers can be stupid, killers are reactive, I've seen plenty of killers waste more than enough time looking for me at the wrong gate JUST because I lit up one light and then walked to the other one, it works a lot more often than most would think. Mind games are YOUR tool against killers.
---
Killers CAN slug, but as plenty of players have proven before a survivor could run a killer into oblivion with good tricks and a general understanding of the maps they play. Sooooo dont get slugged?
---
You've got a different camera angle than killers do, you dont have to walk to every location to find the hatch you just need your head on a swivel.
---
Hitboxes are "broken" but they are still relatively standard. Sure they dont seem right, but they're in the same area as the last time you saw that killer so long as your latency isnt horrid. 
---
Also, as mechanically driven as the game CAN be part of it is psychological so if you're having a hard time playing survivor, play killer, it rough but as your killer ranks up you'll be able to translate the skills of other survs to YOUR surv game.  Not to mention killer is a good way to get out some stress from bad survivor games.
---
Thirteen times. I prefer killer gameplay.
---
No. I dont have an issue with swf, some of them are just normal people trying to have fun with their friends.
---
However there is no denying that toxicity increases with swf. Like when you get that group with the pink haired Nea carrying all the OP items.
---
Hell I had a swf the other day when I was playing survivor. They faked unhooking me, then farmed me in front if the killer and tbagged me. Killer joined in, they seemed extremely salty, probably because I looped them for absolutely ages. I asked the swf why they did it after and their response was “for fun”. Luckily I used shadowplay to record and report it.
---
Thought that was Jake for a sec lol
---
I don’t blame them anymore to be honest. With all the BM going on lately
---
I dunno. None of this is toxic really. Like it is just ways to get the killers attention. It certainly feels like that from the killer perspective because it is 4 v 1, but it really isn't toxic behaviour unless they start messaging you stuff. 
---
Likewise tunnelling and camping isn't really toxic as far as 'strategies' go. But it is toxic if you are purposely ruining somebodies game at the expense of ruining your own game.
---
Exactly. it isn't even toxic behaviour. it is getting the killers attention. Why are killer mains in this sub so fucking fragile?
---
Yes, but you're missing the point /u/TheAzarak is trying to make: A lot of players care less about ranks, then they care about having a fun experience. Dieing on a single hook + tunnel + mori isn't fun for the survivor dieing that early. Double so if he's playing with friends and now has to sit out the rest of the round.
---
It's not fun for the other survivors either, because losing a survivor that early in means they're near-guaranteed to get slaughtered in short order if the killer is worth his salt. People don't necessarily play to win, but playing without a chance of winning may still miff their fun.
---
And your rank argument holds no value, because high rank killers can use them just as well. You're point would only make sense if killers had such an abundance of moris that a newbie killer could in fact completely null his rank progression by constantly using them. Doubt that's true.

I learnt of this the hard way boys
---
I don't really understand his mechanics. It appears once he gets revealed he gets a boost and can see your aura? Like what is the point in that? Let him stalk you and he gets bonus's, catch him stalking you and he gets bonus's. Most of the ghostfaces seem to wait for 'reveal' to happen before chasing...
---
Imagine getting level 50 in 2 games. I got 130k from the non bp event, 3 players used cake and 1 player used bloody streamer. I wish I knew how to play while the BP event was active. Now I'm a bit better I could've done a lot more.
---
Ok IMO the majority of SWF’s aren’t toxic. Obviously there are some because that’s how those players play the game and we can’t really change that. A lot of the community however calls SWF toxic because they had one bad experience so now all of them are toxic. 
---
SWF is the reason for some of the imbalance in the game because of the one feature that it gives which is the communication. Being able to give information about the killers perks, what they are doing, who they even are. Puts the group at a bigger advantage. That’s the reason that if the group is just good at the game and loop like they are supposed to live then the killer will most probably call them toxic. 
---
Also flashlights are as toxic as running good add ons on a killer so can people stop complaining because they don’t know how to look into a wall 
---
Before I’m called a survivor main by someone I’m rank 4 killer rank 3 survivor rn. 
---
That’s my opinion tho 😁
---
I don't like the reveal mechanic, it doesn't feel reliable or consistent
---
It usually works for me playing Meg using Quick and Quiet
---
i’d say no especially with the rework coming soon, he’s definitely gonna be a lot stronger
---
Tbh out of all of them Freddy will be the hardest since its the remake. The only thing I can think of is the blue jacket he had on him and that it.
---
Threads like these are made by people that suck at the game.
---
Is it possible to let them fix their killers without constantly bitching on every single step?
---
It's like the moment they adjust suddenly everyone is crying OMG THEY ARE BUFFING/ NERFING HIM TOO MUCH. Yes they are going to continually tinker with him until they are satisfied and this will go both ways. Grow the fuck up. Let them fix their game, they have way more statistics than you can comprehend to base this off.
---
His ability to one hit you is too fast. He can camp a hook survivor then stalk his rescuer and because unhooking takes quite a while, it's guaranteed that the unhooker will be exposed immediately post unhooking. It's an awful mechanic that encourages camping and tunnelling.
---
I suddenly very much want Shaggy (and Scooby) as playable Survivors!
---
Hey, did they actually changed it that Spine Chill doesn't work on Tier I Myers, or was it always like that?
---
As someone who knows a bit about coding, I completely agree with your statement. Hopefully they add it though in the war future.
---
finally someone who understands
---
This just happened to me today, but he got to tier 3 to before any of us realized where he was. Had to give him props postgame for being ninja
---
Yea true. Feels like they lost their creativity when ita about killer abilitys. I mean i font like the doctor but that power was really something differnt. I saw many fanchapter ideas with really interesting killers. Sure its not like every power would actually work depending on balance, gameplay, animation ... also i like playing ghostface. But to be honest waiting 3 months for a killer with an ability thats already in the game without new maps or survivors is a bit disappointing.
---
&gt;SWF is a crutch
---
Not only is that the most hamfisted statement I’ve heard regarding this game, but it also doesn’t account for the people who just want to play with friends on comms.
---
MoM is basically useless now. Adrenaline isn’t op if you have noed because it literally doesn’t matter. Sprint burst gives them one speed boost at the start of the chase which might get them to a pallet but just don’t swing and waste your time, and dead hard is the easiest perk to counter ever just hug them and wait for it, really simple. 
---
DC’s sure what ever say what you want about them but flashlights. You’ll see if they bring one in so just bring Franklin’s on lightborn even if you don’t have those perks check the are you downed the survivor or just look into a wall. Even then flashlights aren’t toxic .
---
NOED however has one counter which is breaking totem which outside of SWF is not that easy. There’s no way to tell how many totems are left, extremely obscure places that no one checks because they aren’t focused on finding them and the fact it slows down the survivors from doing the objective without giving a reasonable reward.
---
It is a very difficult intricate game to balance. Because it is pvp, but 1 v 4 and quite specialist. New perks killers and strategies produce new mind games and it continually develops. One of the biggest problems for me is seeing lots of PC killer mains dictate the game, constantly whining on reddit about any form of balancing. I'm not talking about the generic complaints about tunnelling, camping, "toxic survivors" (peoples feelings getting hurt because a survivor is trying to get the killers attention, or teabagging at the gate). All of these complaints are clearly from children who need to toughen/lighten up.

---
bubba is a worst version of billy, because billy is bubba's rip-off. They wanted to add Bubba, but they couldn't get the license, so they made their own chainsaw monster dude and they got the license later.
---
other than the bubba and billy example, I like that some killers overlap. it makes it easier for you to transfer game sense form one to another

\[Laughs in NOED and RUIN\]
---
LF is kinda durable but he cant withstand gunshot wounds the only time he got shot that i can recall was in leatherface when he got shot in the cheek but almost any person could survive that shot.Ash may not have a good opportunity to crush LF's skull when LF has his chainsaw but he could break or steal LF's chainsaw.Then ash would only have a bigger chance of winning.ash is also faster than LF so ash could dodge some of his attacks.Lf can also still die like a human breaking his neck or chocking could kill him.

Yea i miss the time back im the old dayz. Remember the time before they nerfed ebony mori. The killer could instkill every survivor after the where downed. And everyones biggest fear was the wraith. He was to op because he was "invisible" lol. To many Pallets and windows and no one knew how to use them. I remember i was hidding and sneaking all match long with my little meg to afraid of making any moves.

So then why does it explicitly say 'rage quitting' there as one example for unsportsmanlike conduct?
---
There’s 60 Killer perks with 3 Tiers each which equals 180 Bloodwebs. To get to Level 50 costs around 1.5 Million and would take it down to 130. 
---
Then presuming the average Bloodweb after Level 50 costs 45,000BP, multiply that by the remaining 130 and you have roughly 5.9 Million. So to get every perk without Prestige would be at least 7 Million. With Prestige 3 around 11 Million is my guess.
---
Exactly.
---
XD I love how Freddy has his own category. Freddy mains unite!

I really hate going down in ranks, the fun comes to an end and everyone just tries their ass off instead of relaxing and just playing

Remember the Red Envelope offering? The one used for this year's Lunar New Year event?

That was also used for 2018's Lunar New Year event. Then BHVR disabled them when the event ended, but let players keep any they had left. Then they reactivated them for this year's event.

Also, if a patch is under a certain size, one can get same-day certification on consoles.

---
Tunnelling is an objectively bad strategy for competent killers on various degrees, while also being unfun for literally everyone.
---
It cucks your performance and learning the game to boot. Pressure on multiple survivors at once keeps them off gens. Being able to end chases quicker on average forces survivors to do more altruistic plays. Altruism is how you get people off gens- if you say "Well if I camp the hook they still come" it's because they expect you to find someone else to hook, because that's what any competent killer does. Survivors playing fully optimally will just let 1 guy die on hook if you're camping for instance so they can get 3 and a half gens done in your face.
---
Tunnelling and knocking out one survivor early sounds like it's a good shout, but it's not for stalling gens. People uninterupted on gens can finish them, and if you're not downing them/ pushing them around the map they know the progress on each gen. If each survivor knows and keeps track of even 2 gens, that's 8 gens they can keep track of and guarantee to finish. If you tunnel 1, that's 3 survivors with easy uninterupted progress on 2 gens each (6 gens)
---
Tunnelling cucks you out of points, BIG time. Not only you, but it cucks the survivors out of points as well. There's a reason survivors come to the hook after a bit; for points, for the long term plan of keeping pressure off, and because they know what it's like to get left on the hook and neglected (and it isn't fun/ beneficial)
---
Most survivors queue to have chases or intense hide and seek. (Better survivors just simply want fun long chases)
---
"Killing" isn't that big of a deal on killer. You can stomp a lobby out in no time flat with certain killers even without add-ons, and if you're good enough and get a read on survivors you can end matches fast as fuck depending on the map. If you treat the game as a learning experience to get better at running loops, you'll generate waaaay more points and get pressure down way quicker.
---
Tunnelling is  a misstep in "strategy", and moreso a dick move.
---
Such a sweet man and a great actor.
---
A little lifehack: if you're going to use iridescent head, set your steam profile to private, otherwise survivors are going to spam your page...
---
It's true, English has a short sentence formula, and easily spoken while Italian has more complex formula. 
---
I really like English since it's way faster and straight to the point, but Italian is still my favourite language due to the sound of words and the complexity of sentences.
---
But have to say English rules on sentence formula are a bit  tough sometimes.
---
I can see how the post can be misleading though, I’ve had a couple comments like this and it’s because I can’t fully explain what I’m talking about in a small meme format.
---
I’m not complaining about recent hotfixes, especially when it comes to the reveal mechanic, those are not working as intended and absolutely need to be fixed. This post is addressing the paranoia that the community has that he’s gonna receive a fatal beating with the nerf stick at some point just because BHVR consistently proves that they don’t play their own game and make odd choices on what to nerf and buff at times.
---
Hope this clears things up, I definitely want ghostface to be a strong killer but you’ll never hear me complain about bug fixes :)
---
Oh I wasn’t correcting you or trying to be smart, I was just giving an estimate more to show how crazy the grind is to be able to get all that. And in just 5 days!

Also on console. He does have some cool phantom like sounds when you're just near him.
---
If you have an opportunity to take him out of his stalk on someone else you should take it.  You might actually buy them some time, which buys the team time to do gens instead of constantly running for hooks because of insta downs.
---
Yea I know I was just saying that you were more accurate and just trying to show how Grundy this game is. I mean 5 days isn't that crazy but with prestige it is and I have my Ghostface only p3 34 and I got a bunch of perks already done but yeah the grind is insane if you include prestiging killers and getting every single perk.
---
You're putting words in my mouth with that Freddy/Nurse comparison. Please don't.
---
Wake Up is bad. With all those other perks that could trigger several times a game, you're effectively wasting a perk slot if A) You die before the gates are powered, B) You're in a Chase when the gates are powered, or C) You don't get to a gate first.
---
Compare this to a perk like Empathy. You've wasted a perk slot if the Killer never injures anyone. You've wasted Sprint Burst if you never get in a chase. You've wasted Alert if the Killer never breaks something. You've wasted Bond if you load in alone.
---
Even compared to perks like Autodidact, Distortion, Poised, Solidarity, Kindred, and Diversion, Wake Up is bad. The perk is **bad**. 
---
The most use you'll get out of Wake Up is probably in the EGC, opening a gate faster than the Killer expects. But if you're running an EGC build...why are you running an EGC build? Evil Dwight, maybe? Even then, you should have bought an escape with your teammates' lives, or be running Spine Chill so you know for certain when your OoO is giving you away.
---
Wake Up is not the Wraith of perks. It is the Freddy of perks. It is *awful*, third only to No Mither and Left Behind.
---
I will take "Sale Pute" for 500
---
Nope just people playing in Kill your friend and not actual lobbies
---
It's okay &lt;3 Just adapt, make the most out of every trial
---
Same boat. Killer is way too boring and easy, sans Haddonfield.
---
Map/ tile generation also just feels inconsistent as fuck. I have some games as an M1 killer where I count 35 pallets being thrown down (not fucking joking about that- this was like 2 weeks ago) and then other times where I spot maybe 1 or 2 pallets on the entire side of a map that has ruin and basement.
---
Rank 20 Megs be like...

Ah the typical “your salty/mad” argument when you can’t debate so satisfying

---
Teabagging isn't toxic on both sides. I swear this is the only subreddit that gets upset about teabagging and classes it as toxic. And then accepts it as canon that teabagging = toxic. Maybe it goes to show how many children are around.
---
Firstly survivor teabagging at gates is mostly just celebratory. This is the only safe place on the map for them, they are naturally going to be communicating and acting happy. Don't take it personally.
---
I was caught and teabagged by ghostface at the end of a game. i found it hilarious. "Fair enough mate" attitude.
---
I've had a teabag party with survivors and ghostface at the end of the game.
---
Also teabagging is the fastest emote for survivors and is used to either show friendliness or to try and get the killers attention, more than anything else.
---
Killers then  act like a survivor running round flashilighting and teabagging trying to distract them is toxic. No this is about as toxic as hooking someone. They are trying to get your attention or save their friend. It isn't toxic. It feels like you are being constantly mugged off when you are the killer as it is 1 v 4 but people need to take a step back from that and understand that everyone is just trying to play the game.
---
But it seriously pisses me off how seriously this sub takes teabagging. Especially at the gate. Chase them out the map - or are you to fragile to let them teabag when they win? That is called being a sore loser. I've seen killers hilariously argue that if they refuse chase them out the map and the survivors don't leave then it is the survivors fault and they should be reported.  (This has been trumped by endgame now).
---
Same on Xbox, fucking everyone has become a dick for some reason. I haven't been able to play survivor and win cause I'm tunneled into the ground everyone game fucking Leatherface, Ghostface, or Clown shitface, and if I play killer, the gens are always completed quickly which, yeah, is my fault to some degree, but goddamn it it doesnt justify you pricks teabagging and light spamming at the gate and then messaging me to kill myself and my family to spare the world some oxygen. 
---
tldr; Tunneling assholes, eat a rat anus sandwich, and Toxic Meg mains, go eat shit and live.
---
Also me
---
It's not the sharpness or bluntness that takes the survivors down. It's pure, unfiltered tetanus.
---
I spent time making this in Microsoft Paint and now I've realised it makes no sense because why would a map offering show up if it's on random.
---
My first meme is a failure, I'm retiring.
---
You are totally right. Just makes you a better killer in the end to go into it.
---
Thanks for the sauce mate!
---
Mission Failed. We'll get em next time.
---
That was a nice little back story.. Thank you! I feel less bad now &lt;3
---
I mean, what else can someone called the trapper do?
---
Lmao DC I don't care I'm still gonna tea bag you 6-10 times before I pick you up, I'll stop when it's equaled all the times I've been teabagged since I've owned it when it was released on Xbox, so I've got a while yet
---
Why is borrowed time bad?
---
But then how else will you randomly die to lag spikes?
---
It is the superior alternative. You can even buffer inputs to cover a little lag spike.
---
It's not, it's great when used properly.
---
Ok define properly?
---
And this is where lies a killer main who never played survivor his entire life.If you actually did Im sure you enjoy being camped and tunneled every game.Because it is a strategy.Yeah?So is swf with comms.Goes both ways you know?
---
Not 2 seconds after they've been hooked
---
Genuinely an interesting thing to know. Thanks for sharing.
---
does elon have the beard of a god? yeah I didn't think so.
---
Then why even have borrowed time if you cant do quick rescues?
---
Nope.
---
that's not how it worked. those offerings ask the server what date they should be able to be picked at. asking all perks to do that would be very taxing
---
I think you need to appreciate the vast different skill levels and difference in playstyles across platforms of the game. It looks like a difficult game to balance. Especially as it is pvp, 1 v 4 and the killers are different to survivors.
---
The point i'm making is this community (especially killer mains) seem to have constant knee-jerk reactions to the devs doing anything. And this sort of satirical memeing is just a way for you to attempt to bully the devs into doing something by using  exaggerated feedback.
---
I could say the same thing about survivor perks being nerfed. No new perks come close to any of the norms. or any killer adjustments.
---
It is a way of complaining purely to try and cause a fuss and get what you want. You see it on reddit all the time. People like you honeslty don't seem to care about balance, you just want it to go as far your way as you can possibly make it. This sub has only just recovered from ghostface PTB whinging. As someone who plays both roles, I don't want a killer that is stupidly easy. With ghostface it seems to be, successful stalk = benefits, get revealed = benefits. That isn't right.
---
They obviously play their own game and they obviously have access to way more information than you on their own game. It amazes me that random redditors think that just because they play a game a lot they should have the right to take over the game company and start making all the decisions because 'the devs don't know what they're doing'. I mean this is one of the better games as well where the devs haven't (yet) sold out to stupid money focused game development (please no battle pass, please no battle pass).
---
[It's not real](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1422435-scooby-doo)
---
Huh, that's really weird. I wonder if there's any weird mind games you could pull off with this.
---
Yeah agreed, you Teabag me ill teabag back
---
What's the point of a quick rescue if the killer can literally just turn around and hit you?
---
You have borrowed time. So it wont matter.
---
Yeah, I tried once but the wiggle meter was too high and let them go.
---
Considering the mask is the only licensed part of the character i'd say it's probably likely. Unless the license holders have a say in what the mask can be used with. For example they could turn down something silly like a chicken suit for Ghostface.
---
Hopefully though there isn't any restrictions like that and BHVR are free to make more outfits for him.
---
Don't know why people are downvoting you. I posted the same yesterday and got upvotes. Think survivor mains are just circle jerking whenever it comes to killer nerfs.  
---
ItS nOt A nErF. iTs A bUgFiX.
---
Except when you get downed again because the killer was given a free hit and chase.
---
Cosmetics usually release on a Wednesday but we don't know the order in which they plan to release the cosmetics so it's any Wednesday between now and the mid-chapter patch.
---
Why wouldnt you loop him?
---
People aren't arguing about that. Of course this is something which NEEDS to be fix, since it seems broken.  
---
BUT it's still a nerf.  
---
People here act like that a bugfix is neither a nerf or a buff since they are just reworking something so that it works like intended.  
---
But if that bugfix ends up taking something away which is currently making the killer stronger, it is still a nerf.  
---
And people don't seem to get that.
---
That's what I have to do. But what if you waited more than 5 seconds and let me actually get off the hook and escape so the killer doesn't get a free hit and chase?
---
I'm impressed.
---
Pictured: Glen0ck moments before being struck with a ban bat by a reddit moderator
---
Well even if waited the killer may stay because im nearby, or will still go for you it makes no real difference. I agree no borrowed time no quick saves. Borrowed time sure.
---
I got downvoted into oblivion on another post for merely pointing out that his reveal mechanic is broken - not that he was too strong or needed nerfing, just that he is currently not working properly
---
Some salty ass bitches lurking in this sub
---
If you're going to reward those other actions, how about x% per minute spent chased as well? 
---
I think the biggest problem with it is that unless the percents are large enough then it will still be a bad idea to attempt, and if the percents are large enough to frequently matter then it's rather strong and shouldn't be there.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted, you're right.
---
God damn roasted.
---
Lol I thought of one, use vanity mirror and the slowed movement (and thus open hand) + never hitting tier 3 makes it look like you have tombstone.
---
Or do it without vanity mirror and walk slowly in tier 3. Survivors freak out thinking you have tombstone, jump into a locker, and then you just grab and hook them like you were planning all along.
---
No, that's a horrible play. Please get better at the game
---
Right because i could just let you get to struggle and then save you.
---
Calm down buddy, there’s no deeper meaning behind the satirical meme. It’s just a meme. There’s no attempted bullying going on here.
---
First of all, I’m a survivor main lmfao. Second of all, “people like you don’t seem to care about balance” is quite possibly the stupidest thing you could’ve said, I literally just told you how I wanted ghostface to be balanced and I didn’t consider the very much needed bug fixes as nerfs, if something is not working as intended it obviously needs to be fixed. So if I’m not against the bug fixes he’s getting, and I sure as hell didn’t call for a ghostface buff, that kind of kills your point of me trying to keep things unbalanced doesn’t it? Literally nothing I have said takes things out of balance or “takes things as far as you can”
---
You say they obviously play their own game and have access to far more information than I do, but having access to more information doesn’t mean jack shit about actually knowing about your own game. If they knew about their own game they wouldn’t keep balancing shit around the screaming rank 20’s who keep calling for everything to be nerfed on the survivor and killer side alike. You say I’m the one whining and not caring about balance but you seem to play the game about as much as the devs do :)
---
Thanks for the time waster
---
Me too but it was scary as fuck
---
It goes both ways though. I’ve ran in to killers that get on alt accounts just to be toxic towards less skilled survivors (like myself).
---
This is you right now🤡

Myers has further lunge and faster vault speed in tier 3, GF's stalk is countered by looking at him so meh.
---
he got populer thanks the bill and ted movies and speed 
---
he has had a long and successful career
---
#DIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Alien isolation strategy here
---
Myers is definitely better than ghostface since you can use scratched mirror and see survivors auras and basically have 0 terror radius with monitor and abuse or even use his tombstone add on and kill healthy survivors
---
From the perspective of someone who primarily plays killer, far from all survivors T-bag. Not only that, but killers having the ability to do it as well doesn't justify being toxic.   
---
Now, T-bagging back the guy who's been doing it to you all game is absolutely fine. Give them a taste of their own medicine. But doing it to survivors who showed no signs of being toxic, I think they have just as much right to complain as we killers do when they do it.
---
MEBATE
---
That’s fair! Mikey is scary though..
---
*95% of my games. Game is pretty much over without premonition which is a gamble in the bloodweb, and the gates can spawn within seeing distance of each other which is a loss out of my control. You'll eventually run out of pallets running the killer around and get camped for it that's not good advice. It's not about finding the hatch first when it opens the killer gets there first to close it. Most downs i see are through windows and pallets long after vaulting animation. I play killer more than survivor, I even made it to the red ranks. I can't even find a game as killer since the nerfs.
---
I can get behind that.. I had a scenario where they all just tea bagged and spammed me with the lights.. :(
---
Also it took 3-4 weeks for them to say anything about the legion bug...
---
And have it end like drake? Meh
---
Versing a camping wraith while cloaked really sounds like law ranks to me. Get used to it. Maybe try getting ds and adrenaline or borrowed time for your teammates :p just block the salty players and ignore them. The ones camping without any reason are either new to the game or have a negative iq.
---
It was always like that; you'd see it light up after it's too late lol

We aren't all bad :)
---
There’s been a PC version out for months now. However, there are a few dead times when nobody is playing and you can’t get a match, but other than that, it’s pretty great.
---
You are one breathtaking man.
---
That's really stupid.  
---
The game doesn't feel anything like what it looks like. If they wanted an immersive experience then I think improving the horrible animations would be a good start.
---
Good to know the Entity is keeping the pallet economy alive
---
how do you macro struggle?
---
When you are living in the past, 10 patches behind, when ds wasnt nerfed yet.
---
 I take this opportunity to remind you that there is a subreddit dedicated to the leaks of the game and of which I am admin, if you want to join, this is the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)

Quick and Quiet removes the noise entirely, which is why its called the quick and quiet juke
---
You can say what you like to me personally, but that is what your meme says. It is pretty obvious. I'm not talking about your specific opinion as much as this post and many others like it that exaggerate one side of the story.
---
Sorry but access to more information means exactly that they know more than you about their game. Like wow, this is exactly the issue. You summed it up perfectly.
---
It is obvious nobody is balancing around rank 20s. Another case of exaggeration to drive home your point.
---
When I play killer I usually just dont pay attention to it.However I dont like flashlights at all.They trigger me so much.
---
Show some leg
---
Fair argument
---
I don't know where that rant came from. The other dude wasn't saying people were being toxic. He was saying that people would tag the killer as toxic, if such a system came into place.
---
But since you bring it up, yes.. Other people do think toxic is flash lighting at pallets, tbagging and flashlight spam. But if you think that they are not toxic, but tunneling and camping are.. Then you are delusional (not you specifically, just whoever thinks that way.)
---
I play both sides, not once have I spammed flashlight or tbagged at gate. Not because I think it's toxic.. But because I know others think it is. It isn't the action that's toxic, but the intent behind it.
---
Wraith?
---
Unlucky
---
I don't mind people flashlight stunning me, but when people start tea-bagging that's when I know I've got some toxicity in the lobby.
---
Thanks for that info, I did not know that. That helped a lot. So if revealing him doesn't stop his stalk, what is the point in revealing him? Is it to bring out his red stain? I've been going against him so much and even in a chase I can never see his red stain and only sometimes do I hear the chase music.
---
Maybe you're different, but getting a 4K is seen as a win for most killers I've seen. And that is a definite loss for the 4 survivors and one that they couldn't really do anything about.
---
He’s just invisile atm
---
Its supposed to orevent you from getting corruption
---
If by healing you mean not drinking that holy water my best guess is that they don't want you to have a long range weapon until certain time
---
Atleast now it makes sense, thought i was being told to sell my penis or something
---
Just put on thantaphobia and people will lose their shit.
---
do you get 0 pip for that?
---
Finally, some good fucking memes
---
I play both and I think teabagging is toxic and annoying. I honestly play depending on which side I feel like playing on any particular day, and recently I'm really into survivor because I see less toxicity that way. Maybe there's some facecamping or whatever but for the most part it's more enjoyable, even though I'm bad at it.
---
Meamwhile somewhere far far away in the map:
---
......fuuuuUUUUUUCK
---
Ohh i didn't know you could avoid BBQ &amp; Chili by hiding in a locker :0
---
Because of inconsistency survivor could really say the same to killers in the EGC do you really want to be HANDED kills that badly?
---
Comments like these are made by entitled assholes that abuse game mechanics
---
It speeds EVERY survivor action by 15%.
---
It’s to counter Plague so you can’t get your corruption. It’s smart.
---
Don t assume that every survivor is an ashole. Just like survivors should not assume every killer is an ashole.
---
Btw : i always love it when ghostface T-bags , he always looks so happy if he T-bags.
---
I've been saying this since day 1. It is not fun or interesting smashing space bar or whatever for 1 minute straight. And its unintuitive as fuck as well as very punishing if you miss a beat. Every person I have ever gotten to play this game with me has died their first struggle instantly, even when I say what to do. Then they usually die a few more times because they didn't keep the beat properly.
---
His main problem is time. he shouldn't be force to run around a map like an idiot to pick up his traps...
---
Camping is just for idiots that are bad at the game. the wraith was obviously a bad player, Although I think camping is for bad killers I don’t mind tunneling at all, it just makes sense to tunnel.
---
I miss grabs. I usually always let that last one go, but like to scare them with a grab and then pretend to walk away nodding. Then shake my head and drop them back on the hatch so they. can leave. I loved the messages I would get. Mostly positive and funny.
---
The killer was motioning to the trap though
---
Spirit is way better than Billy, actually she should have her own category below Nurse
---
No, he's even more garbage now
---
Maybe he wasn’t really stalking
---
Sick joke.
---
 
---
So sick it made me vomit.
---
Actually Hag can end chases faster than Nurse \^\_\^ I don't think she's better tho.   
---
Well, LF can end chases even faster because he has one shot, but you know what I mean.  
---
Btw, every killer struggles on large maps.
---
I win with just brown addons as Spirit, so no.
---
If it exists, there's porn of it.
---
Lmfao, ok bud
---
I just did it to fuck with a guy, no idea he even had DS
---
Lmao my exact reaction from going through this whole argument and upvoting / downvoting based on who I agree with, eventually upvoted his last comment too and now I'm feeling confused
---
Haven't came across this yet and I'm hoping I never will
---
r/rule34
---
It depends on how you use comms as to whether it's a crutch, certain things are acceptable, other things are not. I'm sure some people will disagree with me, but for example...
---
Telling your SWF the Killer is facecamping is alright - technically this should be a perk slot, but facecamping is bait that shouldn't be taken regardless.
---
Telling your SWF where you saw the Killer's Hex is cheating and toxic behavior that is using comms as a crutch.
---
Telling your SWF you used pallets in a specific section of the map is a general statement and isn't terrible. Telling your SWF where an unused pallet is (eg; the shack pallet) is a crutch.
---
Telling your SWF which killer it is, whether Hag or Trapper set traps near/around the hook, or literally calling out their every (important) location and move (also applies to Object of Obsession) is using a crutch.
---
There are a lot of things that you shouldn't tell your SWF; it's okay if you want to play and chat with them, but don't break the EULA.
---
Of course it was, Keanu Reeves is.... breathtaking! I'll see myself out
---
Darn, I was like if this is real I wanna see this.
---
There have been so many bad shitpost tierlists that I was trying to get the joke for this one, then realized it was actually a tier list
---
Take the time to research the game before believing your own ideas.
---
P3 is around 5-6M, All Perks is around 10M
---
What about Xenomorph tough.....
---
A 4K is not defined as a "win" in the game. If a 4K was a win, then the endgame screen would reflect that (entity displeased, ruthless killer, etc.). Then, changes to things like moris could be made accordingly.
---
As it stands, killers are almost always punished in terms of emblem progression for using a mori.
---
The power feels very inconsistent sometimes survivors look at you and nothing happenes and other times they shouldn't even be able to see you kinda stupid imo
---
He can’t see your aura. He can see a brief heartbeat like legions killer instinct.
---
I kinda disagree and agree where Ghostface is placed because 1. He is getting a hotfix done to him making him worse so it isn't fair to judge him(plus he has weak map pressure) 2. He can 1 shot people giving him pressure and forcing survivors to drop good pallets so they don't get instadowned.
---
Its probably as likely as Ubisoft fixing one of their fucking games
---
So no
---
I wish but no
---
I could but it would go on forever so I'm not even gonna bother.
---
3v1 games are boring
---
you see DC more often in 3v1 games
---
this event was huge. I earned millions of bp
---
Freddy will always be in the "darn" category
---
I'm not much of a hex perk fan. Apart from that, consider me in lol I always run moris
---
it's so ridiculous seeing the worst killer in the game, nurse, treated as the best. she's too slow and her power sucks. she's the only killer i dont use, and i cycle between them all. except her. i think they need to give her at least huntress's moving speed.
---
its hard to say who's best in my opinion, as most of it depends on the survivor crowd i get, but i guess i'd say:
---
(1) best: hillbilly, wraith, cannibal
---
(2) good: spirit, hag, shape, pig, doctor
---
(3) okay: plague, clown, freddy, trapper, legion
---
(4) meh: huntress
---
(5) worst: nurse
---
(unsure how i feel about ghost yet, but so far he's at least okay)
---
i prefer speed and direct attacks, so the slower walkers are my worst fave. hillbilly's an obvious great, but i also notice wraith and cannibal are the greatest, because of wraith's speed and cannibal's ability to often wipe out an entire team within moments if you want
---
Same XD
---
that was a patch and they didn't delete them
---
Are you kidding me? We need that ASAP. We need a skin from all the films.
---
I hope you’re joking. Nurse is undoubtely the best, it’s just a fact.
---
Then you realize the killer has whispers
---
Depends. Do you enjoy playing as him?
---
Because I did and still do when I play as him. Games are a tad harder at times but I'd rather play a killer I like than someone I don't
---
Oh damn thanks for posting this, I didn't even know she was going to get something new. I've been hoping for a while
---
just don't miss the first hit 4Head
---
Ah I’m still able to 4K and no one bitches about legion so I see it as an absolute win.
---
It is possible, you just can't permit as many mistakes as when you'd have perks. Sometimes I play Dwight, who is lvl 1 and will probably stay that way, and get wins. I also die....a lot.
---
Ok I like the power but damn those perks are absolutely disgusting and I’m a killer main Jesus
---
"Ghostface from a distance" is accurate but I feel Myers should be higher, because his mask looks pretty similar to Ghostface's masl
---
most perks are useless anyway so yea. I would
---
&gt; You literally need a Killer to pla
---
there are too much killer players anyway. The fact the toxic ones stop playing would not be an issue.
---
Yeaaaah, may've gone overboard with the perks but oh well, just a concept. Main idea was to show that, with some creativity, killers like him CAN work.
---
Hmm I think nurses calling is great and all but with the spirit you can’t rly use aura perks to the best of their ability unless they’re generator aura perks like surveillance. What I run is devour hope, haunted grounds, save the best for last, and bbq
---
I’m by no means a great spirit but I’ve played her a little bit, she’s my favorite killer and honestly any build could work on her. I still need to tweak mine cuz I don’t rly have any perks for her other than this :/
---
I'm imagining darude sandstorm to go along with this
---
He is same speed as majority of killers.
---
So if you're good with doctor, and got BBQ&amp;Chili, then the doctor would be a viable pick in the long run?
---
What the fuck? Kermit has teeth?
---
This has to be bait right?
---
I really like how his power is a utility/chaser I also like the idea of being able to jump over and on to stuff you can’t jump as survivor
---
Yes, it will help when he is looking at you. I am fully aware what the perk I suggested does.
---
I CAN’T STOP THIS FEEEEELING
---
Should've left
---
I'm a killer main, I agree with everything you just said. I did play survivor during double BP and met some tbagging ghostfaces...The first time I saw it..I was cracking up, WE FINALLY GOT A DECENT TBAGGER PRAISE THE ENTITY!!!!!
---
I haven't bought him yet, because I want to focus on the other killers first (working on Doc) But when I get that killer and have him leveled up, I can't wait to find a toxic survivor so I can facecamp and tbag em til the end
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
I love moments like this!
---
Oh, yeah. I've been advocating for a "vanilla mode" and larger lobbies (like 2v7) for awhile now. Definitely wouldn't be ranked, and would just be fun gamemodes.
---
you'd be surprised how often people heal in range of Nurse's. i pinpoint their location and then just use ears to track them down. 
---
I'm All Ears though very situational but i really don't need perks to win apart from StBfT so i slapped it on and gotta say it works real well when they vault and i see the direction they go to not waste time in a jungle gym.
---
You already ‘debated’ with someone and went against your own point a 😂😂
---
Just look up "Parry this meme template"
---
&gt; survivors who are actually smart and are able to benefit from blinds at pallet breaks.
---
you just said you couldn't 'cause of the footstep
---
Yea... Tru3ta1ent had a nice idea. He would pick certain amount of traps from lockers like Huntress and once a trap is disarmed it just vanishes so he had to pick up it again from a locker.
---
The Cult of Pizza Dwight has risen from the underground!
---
IMO she's definitely better than Wraith, not sure about Clown. She applies way better pressure with her trap, she has built in ruin.
---
Same.
---
Imagine a t3 michael lunging 15m lmfao.
---
He needs a lil' somethin'.
---
On most loops you will just allow survivors get another loop if you try to stop pallet drops. He can hardly prevent pallet looping, he can sometimes top windows looping/pulled pallet looping. Smart survivors will know how much they can do against Doctor.
---
Thats an absurd amount of BP
---
You're working on a gen, you look over, fury in his eyes, and desire in his steps, Michael catapults towards you like a shuttle, unrestricted by gravity.
---
I don't want to win either, but I'm not friendly lol
---
Play how you want to play, set your own goal for that game and consider it a victory if you did what you wanted to do
---
Could you make a video on yt, please? I really wanna see how good this build actually is.
---
Killers; intelligence is too hard
---
Hm I agree with I’m all ears. And nurses calling is great( though it refuses to show up in my bloodweb... ever RIP) I feel it might get difficult to use ok spirit for you will immediately lose their location once you start to pahsewalk, and even then. You don’t have any phase walking for the chase anymore.
---
My playstyle with spirit is usually chase the survivor for the first hit, and then phase to get the second hit. This makes chases VERY quick but many survivors can juke or outplay you with this and for me it just takes practice(I hate it tbh, nothing’s more emotionally downgrading then being looked on a jungle gym because the scratch marks disappeared for a second(they need to fix the scratch marks tbh cuz jeez)
---
Ok, I always thought it was working on T1, and recently I came back to the game after pretty long break and one of the first matches was Miguel grabbing me of the Gen. It confused the shit out of me.
---
He needs a little more but I can still 4k with him and do really well with him always so he is still good in the right hands
---
Ok I hate mories, but it's a necessary evil in this case
---
sure, i'll record next game, just got a lobby
---
I want to know...why do you like Legion so much? Please try to make me look at them differently than I do now :(
---
No but its common sense, atleast you should know the game is a killer vs survivor, it literally tells you - when I played my first match the second I saw the killer I straight up ran the fuck away.
---
I think that in higher ranks it hardly happens to get instadown. IMO his ability just doesn't fit this game's mechanics and map design. He's a new killer tho so his position may change over time. ATM I think he's quite underwhelming and I'm  hesitating to put him even lower but I decided to him a chance.
---
yeah, i feel ya. but thank god they've fixed sounds for the most part. i don't even pay attention to scratch marks anymore.
---
Yea, I did it by accident, Nurse was supposed to be at the very bottom Kappa.
---
its friendly if u dont ignore it :)))
---
What's its story?
---
She's so Totally Not Ghostface that she left this tierlist
---
Huntress is really furstrating to play on some maps.
---
stay in 115 for chases and make a quick switch between the two
---
and a lot of it is guessing when you’re going to get cheated
---
because for WHATEVER reason even after being shocked and literally yelping the survivor MAY vault/throw down pallets and vaults
---
you’re welcome though! good luck! learning him is a worthwhile experience and people don’t give the doctor enough credit for what he can do
---
even with borrowed time a a quick/instant save is never a good idea. I see it a lot and it never ends well it's better to let the killer patrol the map before you save or else they could simply get the unhooked survivor right after. The killer having to hit them again won't discourage them from getting them again.
---
if posts like this didnt exist i would still be running  that perk.
---
lol hell no
---
I wanted to mention MoM but I can't anymore
---
you put him on a hook? you're monster.
---
I personally don't have any issues getting it off at high ranks but I can see him getting worse in higher ranks for some plus I understand your position on him but you can't forget he is getting 8% easier to spot and removal the ability to refill the exposed meter on a already stalked Survivor in the hotfix coming soon.
---
Mooyers
---
I've found multiple skeleton keys in one match before.  Plunderers plus Ace in the Hole can net you some pretty good stuff.
---
TIL: DBD players are honestly just masochists
---
Just a question, do you happen to play on console?
---
That’s how I know you’re gsy
---
And I totally get that too. Getting BM in game or hate messages out of game is the result of no punishment for actions in those places. At the end of the day we are all just trying to have fun playing a video game, I just wish more people had a base level of mutual respect and just wouldn’t BM for doing better than the other side.
---
So basically he's getting worse... for no reason.  
---
IMO the thing that hindreds him really badly is his directional wooshing. I don't understand BHVR's ideas for stealth killers... 8m long directional wooshing GF, OMEGA loud footsteps Wraith, roaring Pig with map-wide breathe and... map-wide breathe Michael.   
---
Still, Wraith, Pig and Michael are quite stealthy, but GF who completely relies on Wraith is loud AF.   
---
I love when ppl try to mindgame with stealth at jungle gyms, it makes looping even easier because I don;t even need to look behind to know where GF is. And it's funny they added an achievement to grab ppl from gens with the killer who is so loud he can't pull it off... Also they completely wasted his jumpscare potential which we all was hyped for.
---
Stop PLAGUEing this sub with your fanart you weebs
---
Oinkyers
---
I don't know, I've only played him like three times and on my third match I had all four survivors injured within a minute.  If you get a group that tries too hard to be altruistic, you can usually wipe them out with ease.
---
Doctor in F?? I dominate rank 1's with him? May I ask your reasoning behind this?
---
I just started playing and I got flamed by survivors saying I tunnel too hard.
---
I mean I was playing ghostface, why would I go after the uninjured guy when I could just stalk them when my night shroud comes back?
---
Oh come on
---
Dont stereotype all killers just because on elites to complain
---
Like everyone who says Fortnite sucks.
---
\*\*LIAR!!\*\* \*Throws Table across the room\*
---
The mans shirt would rip right off from the sheer force of the lunge! Lmao
---
I just do a two to three finger sync tap.  Keeps your hand or fingers from getting tired.  I don't ever die to struggle unless there's some kind of lag issue.
---
Thank you, i’m a survivor main but i’ve played killer for a couple of months now pretty consistently. I don’t like face camping to tbagging so I don’t do them no matter what I play as.  My point is you can’t do something for so long and then turn around and not like it done to you in return, ya know? If you don’t like toxic things done to you don’t be toxic in return. A group of survivors I was in last night kept messaging me telling me to report the killer for tbagging after they had initially tbagged him at pallets like come on.
---
Unfortunately happens to everyone... Only thing you can do is try your best and find the weaker survivors and kill them lol
---
Adds a stun effect to survivors upon viewing Michael
---
I play on ps4 and I still admit Nurse is the best killer, people who actually wanted to learn her are rare though
---
This, I need to butt dance in order to have survivors accept me as one of there own.
---
And I used sloppy butcher alot with wraith
---
How the hell did I not notice
---
Increasing the detection zone increase the number of spot where a skilled surv can spot ghostface without being visible (and hence can't be marked). Not being able to refresh a mark is a big hit too.
---
I don't know how impactfull those nerf are. I'm not sure GF needed those tweak. Focused and precise camera positionning in 3rd person in a world were some kind of auto aim on 3rd person shooter is pretty much standard was ballsy... And I think mouse+keyboard have an edge over gamepad in this area.
---
I still dont understand why they annouced a precise nerf and released GF anyway. They have a lot more data now compared to when he was released.

okay, so, i didn't unleash the full potential of perks but they did help me a bit. unlucky map, too big to maintain proper control without playing slightly dirty. plus at least two people in swf. i had them few games before this one, they're not too bad for purple ranks.

Less related, but he's targeting the sub to be spammed [right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/comments/c3208m/they_never_seem_to_appreciate_us/) which at least implies upvoting as well (remember his whole thing is "pig = upvote", he keeps telling everyone that follows him to upvote, which is brigading).
---
He also wants people to post on his behalf again [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/comments/c40y4q/great_news_oinkers_i_created_a_flair_for_everyone/) and go to war against this sub [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/comments/c1ksar/we_are_at_war_once_again_sharpen_your_hidden/).
---
**He directly tells people to "upvote pro-Pig posts"** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Oinkers_/comments/c3u51k/soi_got_banned_on_the_dbd_reddit_i_do_not_know/ertg6pt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) in response to being banned, but not to tell anyone about it, which is technically trying to make the crime fit the punishment, but he already was spamming "pig = upvote" and telling people to upvote Pig before, so it's more exacerbating the issue.
---
You can't scroll through his post history with reading the same "upvote" and "oink" spam between him calling people names and generally being insulting.
---
You can also tell we've failed as a species when there's people in the world who dont have the same mindset as you.
---
Lol.
---
Out of the 3 examples you give, only the first is actually tunneling. The other 2 are completely fine, situational measurements that I'm doing aswell and never gotten any complaints for; and that I wouldn't complain about as a Survivor, either.
---
Here is why your examples are still dangerous: whiney, entitled idiots made you believe that this is worth whining over. They made you believe that it is tunneling when you hook someone, they get unhooked, and without going straight for them they are the next person you find again. This is not tunneling. But because some people tell others it is, people like you are now saying tunneling is fine. It's not. It's just that these entitled idiots call everything they don't like 'tunneling'. The problem is real tunneling, developing tunnel vision to go straight for one Survivor to eliminate them ASAP, ignoring all or most other things happening around them. Do you get my point here? (Genuine question, I'm not a native speaker)
---
And about example 1: So why is it toxic behaviour to go for the one who got unhooked? Because they didn't choose to get unhooked. I've wanted a feature where a hooked Survivor can resist the unhook for a long time now; like a kick-in-the-face animation or something. Trust me, when you're on that hook and a 'team'mate farms you, and the Killer LETS HIM do that by tunneling you, it's one of the most infuriating things that can happen, and one of the most disgusting things a Survivor can do to another.
---
These two Survivors are two different people. Don't punish one for the idiocy of the other.
---
Since ghostface came out last week, it hasn't been a crazy long time... Well I guess kinda crazy long in term of major exploits :p
---
Yes, it isn’t.
---
Get Ghostface, teabag back.
---
In my experience the wooshing hasn't really hindered him it's more of his ability in general because it can't really provide map pressure as well as Hillbilly, Spirit,Nurse,Hag etc because they can either go across the map fast destroy pallets quickly or have great mindgame potential while Ghostface just has a one shot which may seem good but Survivors just slam pallets down like no tomorrow which technically isn't a bad thing but it wastes so much time for others to do stuff. Ghostface is just a M1 killer at the end of the day that can't play provide pressure that well.
---
Definitely over-nerfed beyond what was necessary, though the main aspects of the rework were direly necessary. The change I dislike the most is the increase of the post-Frenzy fatigue time from 3 to 4 seconds. That should be reverted. Fatigue vision is pretty awful, and looks bad too. Not being able to trigger Frenzy at-will, having to wait for it to fully recharge instead, is also something I consider to be an unnecessary and bad change. Vault speed reductions took some fun out of the feeling of playing Legion. Some add-ons need touch-ups, as they were lazily "adjusted" for the rework.
---
Pig doesn't get instacrouch because she has springs in her legs. It takes time to depress and set them so she can lunge
---
They are aware

---
Ghostface just approaches from any angle and gets the stalk off either by "abusing" leaning in and out to break the reveal, or by just not getting seen in the first 2\~ seconds of stalking.
---
Then suddenly you're exposed by a killer already a second away from lunging distance.
---
Myers isn't gonna get more than one down in EW3 unless you're bad anyway.
---
this, if you expect the locker to save you when the chainsaw charge is being held, it won't.
---
Only ppl's behaviour can be toxic. Iredescent hatchets, Omega blink, SWF, BT, DS etc aren't toxic. Tbagging, flashlight spamming, bming at a hook etc is toxic.
---
Dont know wtf im suppose to joke about anymore lol. I guess a few people on denial saw my comment **/s** &lt;--------
---
Oinkael
---
Yeah, I’ve always really liked Keanu starting with Bill &amp; Ted.
---
And despite how not “like” the character in physical traits he was, I loved his Constantine movie. It’s what introduced me to the character
---
Yeah that's pretty overwhelming.
---
Constantly asking people to up/downvote content, and setting a whole sub on people's posts that he doesn't agree with are basically exactly the rules he was accused of breaking.
---
Kind of ridiculous to then say they don't know what they've done wrong.
---
GF is good as long the survivor is bad (like every B or less tier killer), you can waste 3 gens with few pallets, the less gens, the less stealth he Will be
---
Bruh they added the EGC to help push douchebag survivors out the gate quicker. You surely can't be serious when you say teabagging is part of the game?
---
those are opinions not facts
---
It's funny that the guy who was using a glitches perk also came in last and said "gg" :p
---
I always let myself die as quickly as possible if I see that the last teammate clearly knows where the hatch is an is standing near it. On the other hand, if they don't seem to know, I hang on because while they will be searching for the hatch, the killer will likely stay close to me, buying the teammate more time
---
In higher ranks GF hets easily revealed from what I've seen. I haven't had any problem with him yet tbh. Myers can snowball and he can stalk you even if you look at him.
---
I enjoyed the read thanks
---
You were teabagging in the exit gate, so the Entity punished you.
---
Still better than 4 stack swf who constantly sabotage hooks when I am 3 meters aways from it. Oh, and of course on the cornfield.
---
I dont really camp, but if they unhook when im just a slight bit away from the hook, i will turn around / return to the hook and give chase to the first i see. 
---
Chance is, its the just the freshly Unhooked trying to get away... and insta-crying about tunneling ensures.
---
Very interesting build that could probably work for the other killers also which is nice because builds that can work on multiple killers is something that you don't see besides the meta perks. I'm all ears seems like an odd pick though probably would be better to use BBQ for maximum tracking and information giving but then again I'm not a Spirit main so it could actually work well.
---
Wooshing helped me many times when I was playing survivor so IMO it is hindering him. But yea, as you said he's just m1 killer with no real mindgame potential and absolutely no map pressure. His ability is also very difficult to pull off in mid-game, because to succeed you have to apply constant pressure and he has to wait until his power bar recharges.
---
Which perk is glitched???
---
Does ghostface have less range to hit than most killers? I seem to encounter loads of ghostface who miss their shots and I seem to miss more than usual when I play as him
---
To be honest teabagging in the exit gate should immediately reverse any generator progress you've done that match, eject all survivors from the gate area and close the gates, and put the teabagging survivor on a hook (immediate sacrifice even if it's their first hook).
---
It should also reveal your aura permanently to the killer in every match you play for the next week and slow you by 100% when in their terror radius.
---
\&gt;:P
---
I know, I know, it's not as bad of a punishment as it should be, but...
---
And Susie has braces! No, really! I love that the devs not only made detailed concepts for each masked character, but actually rendered their faces and if you look close enough ingame, you can see them. Here they are: https://twitter.com/loudwindow/status/1067695980072452096?s=21
---
horrible like i don't wanna be that kind of crybaby but i swear to god 80% GF i've faced kind of tunnel and camp somewhere in a corner waiting to get exposed on the unhooker and when the hooked person reveals him, he starts to patrol the area searching for the survivor who revealed him 🤦‍♀️
---
IMO his ability is completely useless against survivors who know what they are doing, so his ability is basically to move slower if he wants and maybe stop some infites. You can do well with any killer, but is it really the killer's power that is helping you?  
---
If you have any footage showing "Doctor's power really helped me against good survivors" show it to me. I'm opened for a discussion.
---
LMAO no they didnt! They took fucking centuries to acknowledge it.
---
If you think they made the forum post sooner after mending than the wakeup thing has been a glitch, you just learned about it super late.
---
It was a thing for a looong time.
---
I have yet to level her up :( She's after I'm done completing the Doctor
---
Killers get tbag and BM dor anything, no matter how good of a person you are, that means toxic survivors will do the same.
---
Also, why EVERY SINGLE ONE that complain about GF is actually bitching about the person behind it and not the killer? Why you say "oooh I hati gust fici" when you actually hate the piece of uraniun of extreme toxicity behind him? Be consistent, you hate bad players the same as everyone, no matter who, if it's a meg, a doctor, a claud or a nurse
---
Just change it to mouse down and scroll for your life.
---
Now I kinda want shaggy (or for that matter the rest of the crew) as playable characters in dbd
---
Its shit and thats the point
---
At least they say they know something about the blades glitch with an Ingame message
---
Yet another tool for survivors to get more op? XD
---
I played with friends like that...I prefer solo queue
---
Yep besides catching unaware survivors with no red stain and terror radius he just lacks alot of stuff. the ability recharge is really slow forcing you to use the chewed pen add on making it recover faster and use the Ghostface caught on tape to get a chance of getting a exposed status off. He is such a complicated killer to use in my opinion making him seem very easy to use but very very hard to use actually which is I main him currently as he offers up a challenge. I feel after awhile he'll become like Freddy 2.0 because everyone will know how to counter him.
---
SASAGAYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. oh shit wrong part.
---
Rolled a 1 on a charisma check
---
Ugh I can't when I play survivor and I see the other survivors beign toxic towards the killer for no logical reason.
---
How did you know?
---
it does work well. here, i've recorded my last game cause someone here asked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_VxDsNE_g
---
you can see at start when i first downed Nea how it actually helps for the most part.
---
how many hours do you have in the game?
---
keep playing him, first games i was only able to get 1 kill if i was lucky, not he's the one i bust out when i see a swf, you just need to get used to cancelling his power to chase with regular m1 instead of that urge to hit them again with frenzy 
---
i play with bbq, ruin, franklins (whenever i see 2 or more items), enduring and sloppy if they don't have items
---
Poor baby Dwight. He learned the hard way of how to survive in the wild lands of the entity
---
Lockers work for me more often than not. You just have to be smart about it. Try observing the killer while hiding (not in a locker to start with), if they check lockers then don't. However, you find that too many killers just can't be bothered. Importantly Huntress opens cupboards to re-stock so that's always going to be a bad idea. Also if your running and then hiding in a cupboard, you're going to have a bad time.
---
Ye isn’t this a nerf?
---
Poor baby dwights. They are the ones who suffer the most
---
Basically if using voice comms impacts the SWFs performance in the match, they're being toxic and abusing third-party-programs to gain a competitive advantage (which is against the EULA of Dead by Daylight).
---
It's not "being in a voice call with your fellow survivors" that is the problem with SWF, the problem is when an SWF shares any information about the match they're playing with each other in even the smallest fashion (most notably the location/identity of the killer, location of traps, unused pallets, totems both dull and hex, etc).
---
TBH I was even thinking about putting him below Freddy, but as I said, I decided to give him a chance. Gens are flying like crazy these times and he really struggles at applying pressure unless survivors are dumb. He's good at camping tho...  
---
I hope somebody will find an effective way to play him, but tbh I can't think of any myself...  
---
BHVR is like: Lets give the power of instadown, but because it is too strong lets make it unusable, it's the same with Leatherface. Myers and Billy are both older killers so they weren't so scared of making stronger killers. Plague is way better at instadowning, but she is the most genrushable killer in the game because nobody wastes time on healing(selfcare is really time-consuming).
---
Look at the video the op commented on my comment. It shows the Quentin trying to leave after he is caught.
---
I feel like a baby now for considering not to prestige him because I got so many nice perks on him.
---
He's just reached level 50.
---
You are my hero, sir.
---
actually exposed is much better, you cant heal that off or use your protection perks
---
I dunno, if you're in an SWF and you see my Ruin and tell your buddy where you saw it, you're 100% toxic.
---
Not all toxicity is visible, even just saying "I didn't use the shack pallet" is unfair.
---
Sort of, the main reason for introducing ECG was to get rid of hatch stand offs, and also to stop survivors from pissing about at the end of the game wasting time. Survivors could previously run around the map hiding and wasting time.
---
This is not the same as pushing survivors out of the gate, when they are stood by the exit celebrating. In this scenario you don't need ECG. You literally just have to walk up to them. You can't seriously think ECG was introduced to help killers push survivors 2 metres.
---
Also I didn't say teabagging was 'part of the game'. I said it isn't toxic behaviour. It amazes me how upset killers get by it - when it comes down to you not being able to catch someone. If they are looping and teabagging then stop chasing, or catch them. The killer controls the game. I have not heard a single credible reason why a survivor making themselves more vulnerable by crouching and uncrouching and trying to get the killers attention, is toxic behaviour.
---
People are somehow accepting it as cannon in this sub to deal will them being upset about losing and therefore that is not the problem, the toxic survivors is the problem. For that 2 seconds at the end of the game when you reach the gate and realise you've lost.
---
I mean.. seriously.... I am not the one speaking illogically here.
---
There’s a very short list of people who only play one half of this game who are worth listening to in terms of balance, frustration and in general any state of game health. 
---
It’s a one person list and it’s Space Coconut. 
---
Also people on that us vs them mentality can suck it. They always sound like entitled cretins.
---
I love chasing megs with McDonalds wifi basically having constant dead hard and being a better nurse. Especially when i get a msg saying I'm lagging lol.
---
But before, everything was impossible to hear.
---
I'm super happy to see more fanart love for Ghostieboi &lt;3 Please don't stop with the other version, we need more!
---
But I'm glad you decided to use references for the next one! I don't know why people point it out when they drew something from memory. It's not an achievement, it's a lazy, bad habit. Use references, guys! Makes your picture better, and you improve the hell of a lot faster.
---
I probably should have specified that I meant a recent repost, like last week or something.
---
I’m usually in swf, we are usually 2 or 3, and we screw each other up all the time xD not the solo players.
---
“DONT BRING MICHEAL HERE!” Followed up by a “screw you” xD 
---
My group almost never coordinate other than “killers in that area”, and I don’t think that’s toxic, we don’t make a combo of perks, we do sometimes put up offerings that kinda match.
---
But I’ve seen my fair share of toxic swf groups when playing killer, or solo survivor.
---
I stopped at your new resilience, no fucking thanks
---
It's like a red pulse dot that appears quickly where you were. Reveals your general location, but not your direction or anything.
---
when i play ghostface i get revealed instantly .
---
You mean "Say Scream!"?
---
I got one yesterday, and he caught me without BT, it really makes the matches boring
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it still count towards deviousness BP?
---
Ulysses makes a good point in his recent video MoM is overpowered in swf but not solo queue but running into it is shit tbh But i think that its a small majority of groups who do it just let them have their fun its only a game at the end of the day and there is no gain from 4king anyway so just enjoy what your doin
---
This is my General Opinion of the game in its current state
---
A symbol comes up and marks you for him to know where you are but it doesn't last long so it's not that big of a deal
---
Why are you booing him, hes right
---
Yep it did work well but I saw you didn't really use thrilling Tremors to it's fulliest extent because when you downed Feng thrilling tremors was close to being ready so if you waited a few more seconds you probably wouldve gotten thrilling tremors off sooner and maybe getting another thrilling tremors play also because thrilling tremors could mean they finish a generator or not giving you a huge advantage.
---
But if you do totems wouldn't you be taking away the possible NOED?
---
Ah I see, thanks for the clarification. I guess that would be the difference between that and aura's, knowing which way they are going or what they are doing. But I mean, legion never has any difficulty using that to track people. I'd like to think my point still stands that Ghostface gets benefits for a successful stalk and benefits for a failed stalk..
---
Wake up
---
Yep. You also get deviousness when hitting someone that isn't marked while in stealth giving 500 towards deviousness.
---
Hate this bullshit. Sadly nothing will be done about it either.
---
When you hate your teammates so much you leave them to die BEFORE the gates open
---
I'm an aspiring console nurse player. Got my blinks down the other day so lets hope to face each other. I put on my big boy gasps and I'm ready to rumble.
---
Great idea, I'm changing it to F too!
---
Fucking sandbagging rats
---
I didn’t know Kermit had teeth. 
---
I don’t like it.
---
Yea 15% speed to everything, healing speeds, gens and gates. He basically "cheated" and said "you did fine" while being carried by his actually good team :p
---
That's honestly the most vile thing I've heard of anyone doing in this game
---
there was no need, when i needed it i used it. like for the endgame to make sure Tapp was not on a gen. and i really don't mind survivors doing gens. if i lose, i lose. it was fine if Tapp would get the hatch there but i got lucky and tbh i'm no fan of people who camp hatch instead of doing gens. Feng was dead on hook yet she tried. Tapp was literally camping hatch for a very long time.
---
Mines working fine
---
&gt; D tier: Freddy
---
DARN
---
Damn wtf, don’t they lose points for safe unhooks
---
Why would someone downvote this? I don’t understand.
---
The whole concept of ghostface is great i think hes a good addition, but hes just really fucking broke rn
---
I mean, I don't think flashlighting is toxic, tunnelling is okay in *some* circumstances, but facecamping is just bs and teabagging has no purpose at least imo, unless it's to teammates to thank them for something like getting you off the hook.
---
I know but I'm just saying if you're going against a good squad and you want to win a few seconds could give you enough time to get someone hooked or downed plus that detective Tapp probably could've lived if he just camped the exit gates.
---
Team work makes the dream work.
---
Strange. I can play my other games online right now, just not DbD.
---
Honestly at this point I agree with you.
---
I wish every killer was there
---
I mean, it is still a benefit for failing to stalk someone. Doesn't seem right to me.
---
Assassins Creed guards are worse though
---
these are purple ranks. why playing full serious and time everything against clearly inferior opponents? D:i'm just getting back on red after i de-ranked for Ghostface Adept.
---
where are you located where lobbies are dead? In UK i didn't have any major issues last week. Killer queues were long, survivor queues were short.
---
&gt;D tier: Freddy
---
F tier for Freddy
---
I see you play like I do as well.If I happen to be find that unhooked survivor like before a minute has passed I just leave them on the ground to give them a second chance and not make the game hell for that survivor.I play both sides frequently and it's so infuriating when you get unhooked,downed and back on the hook 2 seconds later.
---
This. Changed it to scroll wheel and the hooked life has been simple ever since
---
I am not very good at playing the killer but when I do manage to get 3 kills, I let the last one have the hatch ALWAYS unless they were being toxic. If they weren't, I let them have it.
---
Also if I see that they are completely clueless about the location of the hatch (ie obviously  hasn't been to the general area), I close it and let them power the exit gate to escape to end the game quickly
---
I mean save the world was a cool concept, the battle royale was just made because their game flopped and they needed to rip off pubg in order to make money.
---
Ok so:
---
1. The fatigue duration should be reverted, yes.
---
2. Fatigue vision works just like Nurse, the point is to punish the killer for missing and rewarding the survivor for juking him.
---
3. Not being able to trigger Frenzy when you want was made to avoid one of the problems of before rework Legion: Destroy every type of protection that a survivor has. You could wait the survivor to throw a pallet then activate Frenzy and hit him without counterplay. With this change, they can no longer do this.
---
4. Same for missing a hit and losing your power.
---
Yes you're all very tolerant, let's all pat ourselves on the back here for a few minutes and then we can continue with our downvoting any opinion we don't like.
---
If you want Billy achievement you can't chainsaw until they are hurt. You can try his best addon, speed limiter, for that.
---
Get spirit fury, swap that for whispers and combine spirit fury with enduring so you can damn near chainsaw through dropped pallets and still hit the survivors and you are good. You don't need whispers on him because you should be using his chainsaw to patrol gens. He doesn't waste much time doing that so he doesn't need a time saver when it comes to gen patrol :) whispers is also a hard perk to learn. If you are new you may waste more time searching for a survivor then actually saving, and you can easily just continue to put pressure on gens, especially with Tinkerers.
---
The punishment of missing a hit works just like Nurse. It's a good change.
---
Lore wise they want killers to be/have been living humans as well
---
U.S.
---
I pretty much agree with you. But teabagging is just a go-to emote for everything because it is quick. As you say, it has no purpose, but that means it also isn't toxic. It does nothing except waste the time of those using it.. It isn't like the survivor has downed the killer and is ruthlessly teabagging his body while he can't do anything.
---
Never before have I seena  community against something so meaningless - and it is obvious why - because they are upset about losing. They wouldn't give a shit if the survivor was teabagging and then they caught them with NOED and put them on a hook. It would be a case of 'don't celebrate too soon'. But celebrating and being called toxic for it is just sore losers. I'm sorry but nobody can offer a reasonable excuse to call survivors toxiic for crouching repeatdly.
---
If they start messaging you "BABY KILLER EASY GG" this is toxic. But anything up to this is how certain killers interpret it, which seems to hurt a lot of fragile ego's.
---
Using a broken/bugged perk knowingly yes. Yes they should. Just like they banned people for the crotus asylum glitch. If they didn't know, sure. But they have the data. They know. :)
---
Oof. True, purple ranks are kinda silly in their decision making and I mean I wouldn't want to be at Red ranks anyways as I struggle enough against decent SWFs
---
Absuing? Someone needs a dictionary!
---
And? You make it sound like a crime to make a better game.
---
Well they dont work right so it doesn't really matter
---
I'm having same problem on ps4
---
Completely agree. Like Tru3Ta1ent always says, toxic is a playstyle, not a perk or add on or power. Sure,  they can be annoying and a pain to deal with, but that doesn’t inherently make them “toxic”.
---
Okay I am a litteral flabsmutter, I spelled totems wrong, please don't hate me.
---
I just hate how unoriginal it is, Constantly makes stuff that's just bootlegged from other brands and takes things without people's permission.
---
*safe hook rescue*
---
There is no other game where you can be targeted and removed from the game completely with no ability to do anything like in DbD. Every other game involves you have the chance to do something.
---
And as I've said many times in this thread, that person A enables person B to be an asshole doesn't somehow compelled person B to be an asshole or excuse their behavior.
---
Plague is bugged. If you’re puking on something as the game ends, it crashes. So make sure that as the last survivor escapes/dies you’re not puking.
---
I think you have to want to be offended to read that first statement as me stating objective fact, or have really poor reading comprehension.
---
you should play more Spirit. other killers but her, Billy and Nurse are hard to pull off on red ranks. the mobility is very important. plus you can't afford long chases. but i really prefer red ranks, it's most fun for me, i like when survivors dance with me in mindgaming loops and scratch marks. 
---
with current pipping have to say as Freddy main i don't really play Freddy on red ranks D: or anyone besides Spirit and Legion
---
Ghost Face daddy
---
If you're on about the Epic Store now then I wouldn't know about that, I'm just talking about Fortnite.
---
I just laugh at it mostly now.
---
I'm talking about the game as a whole, I dislike it because as a creator seeing someone profit from an idea that is unoriginal and only made for profit it annoys me.
---
Yeah I dunno. I feel like I am talking to a brick wall most of the time. Maybe it is because I grew up with halo where you could do some really intense teabagging. Either find it hilarious, or toughen up. There is no point letting yourself get upset about something that may or may not be being done maliciously. Also in the old lobbies of COD. I mean if you want to see toxicity, that was full of it. But at the end of the day it is all how you take it. If someone has lost 4 games in a row and sees teabagging they are more likely to get angry than someone who has won 4 in a row.
---
It is hard to debate when nobody actually talks any sense to me and just downvote.
---
A big part of it is the 'lonely' killer vibe I think and just the make up of DBD. But getting upset won't help people, neither will it stop people doing it.
---
Ohtofu is the only good answer here, but yeah he also thinks spirit fury + enduring is kinda lame so trigger-warning for literally everyone on this subreddit.
---
If you're not toxic are you really a survivor main????
---
God forbid people have an opinion about something, right?
---
It's a free game...
---
The most sad part is, the killer couldnt have done this without the entity. *The Entity killed them, not you... filthy killer*
---
that exists to charge children for outfits that they feel pressured to buy, creating an environment of fear of exclusion.
---
I just dont have the heart my second ghostface game was like this I wasted the cake and everything but I just didnt have the heart to kill her I let her do two gens and run me around a bit and let her leave
---
When I use a red Mori I try to hook at least two different people before I use it. Maybe it would be a good change for it only to activate after the second unique hook.
---
C U T E !!!
---
Phasing
---
what?
---
No, as a killer, you are there to kill, not to let the survivors toy with you and have fun.
---
*High fives in sadness*
---
Nice.
---
As a main survivor myself, I have a great respect for killers. After all the shit they get, they still play and give us the chance and challenges of other trials. 
---
It's funny how survivors are so annoyed by the only thing the killer is meant to do and how much audacity they have to BM them and then throw tantrums about being camped and tunneled when they were completely scumbags. The game was supposed to put 4 random survivors in a trial, trying to escape a merciless killer, you don't go and strip them of that power role.
---
I get very bitter towards killers when I get hit after a vault, or a pallet drop, it's not their fault, it's their connection and this fucking company needs to release an actual date for Dedicated Servers already.
---
Not official whatsoever.
---
Some doll yoinking Huntress' outfit.
---
Nurse's Calling on Spirit is great.
---
Angry phasing noises
---
I'm all ears is useless IMO... Pop goes the weasel to slow the game down just a little bit.
---
I would still be annoyed about teabaggers after killing them, even if I won. Because I hate being made fun of tbh, and I'm also really new to the game so I always interpret it as somebody making fun of me for being a shit killer. This sort of thing is why I rarely play PvP games any more honestly, I don't like competitive stuff. Too stressful. I like casual games, where I can screw around, make myself laugh at dumb shit and stuff like that. I need to make DBD more casual in my head.
---
It also annoys me that killers can't teabag (Am console normie, haven't got Ghostface) to have a laugh and return the favour if you got pallet stunned and the survivor stays to teabag you. That's just the casual in me, the careless 'I want to have fun'.
---
Yeah, I think this is why Reddit is pretty irritating to use. The hivemind often chooses someone with slightly different opinions and hates on them rather than debating reasonably.
---
Yes
---
I find when I play solo survivor at green rank or higher, higher being up towards rank 20, its a real crap shoot on how my team will be. Often the killer is not very good but what kills me is the team making really stupid decisions. I might get hooked and no one comes, I am hooked and see no one is working gens just immersing about, people cowering in a corner when the killer is on the other side fo the map and has just hit someone, these are just some examples lol. 
---
The worst is when you have pretty much carried them, multiple hook saves, cleansed ruin, popped 3+ gens and ran the killer about long enough for that final gen and they just leave you lol. Then you go to the scoreboard and the person who survived is bottom of the pack having done sweet F A.
---
You dont get it man. Killers are allowed to be toxic boosted assholes because this game is WAAAAYYYYY survivor sided and every group is a 4 stack SWF bully squad with second chance perks and flashlights. Literally every group. Solo queue doesnt actually exist. 
---
How is a killer supposed to kill someone who constantly runs away? If the killer lets them off the hook theyll just run away again. Thats not fun for killer and if the killer isnt having fun, no one gets to have fun. Camping and tunneling is what those entitled survivors deserve. The killer is the POWER ROLE, hes supposed to get an easy 4k every game. Survivor is soooo easy to play, they dont ever deserve to escape.  
---
God, the game is so clearly catered to them. Like, survivors are so OP and easy but most killers on this subreddit still 3 or 4k every single game because they're all soo skilled and good at this game.  The only reason they ever lose is because of some bullshit item or perk.
---
See I get this but I don’t know how it’s toxic it’s annoying yes but not toxic
---
If you cant use Myers in the red ranks because he is not enought strong he is not balanced  is weak
---
That's true
---
I can't connect to the servers myself. Maybe it's the hotfix update?
---
I honestly think the concept of the entity taking all of these psychopaths, murderers, and survivors and forcing them to do this over and over as a means to appease itself is kind of a really cool concept. With little interference on both sides to just keep things interesting.
---
thats also an issue, you let them get to you, i prefer public profiles because it lets you collect the salt as a trophy.
---
You need to break two pallets (if spirit fury is level 3) for it to activate, you don’t need to have been stunned by pallets, then when you next get stunned it will break that pallet for you. Then you need to break another two pallets to use it again.
---
Basic killer ms is 4.6m/s and TR is 32m. Survivors MS is 4.0m/s. His ability doesn't give him anything, this would be omega bad killer...
---
Pretty much
---
First of all, I’ve played more than 5 minutes of killer and I’m defending it.
---
Second of all, your point makes absolutely no sense. There is a large difference between playing with friends on comms and fundamentally changing the gamemode to make it unbalanced. Additionally, people have suggested 2v8 in the past, and the idea has gotten traction from both killers and survivors. 
---
You must understand that removing SWF due to fringe cases of toxic 4 man blendettes punishes the large majority of players whom use SWF to play with friends. I’ve met a number of my current friends queueing into random Discord SWF chats. Stop blanket hating survivors just because you got a bit angry at a game once where an SWF group dominated you.
---
Exploiter is there
---
They’re just making survivors taste their own medicine, remember the endless tbag at the exit gates, well, they just get a revenge
---
Cleanses totems = no NOED
---
Doesn’t cleanse totem = NOED
---
Who does this guy think he is, the tutorial?
---
If it's not Whispers 3 don't use it. It's only good at tier 3.
---
I dunno if it’s the update or not, but I do think it’s something on their servers end. I just tried to play Deathgarden on my pc (their other game) and received a similar message there as well. Meanwhile I can play virtually any other game online right now with no issue.
---
If getting hit through pallets and vaults is still a thing and hitboxes remain fucked. This game is dead, and I will not be playing anymore. Who the fuck will stay after Cyberpunk comes out.
---
Surviver should know when the killer have noed before they get smashed
---
Yeah this is fair. I'm not denying toxic survivors exist. I'm denying that teabagging alone does not make a survivor toxic.
---
Cry more
---
Barely anyone tries to play hard because she is quite hard to play as. You have to figure out how to create a decent web on every single map. That's a lot of learning and strategical thinking. Nurse is hard in technical way, but she's quite brute force compared to Hag. People don't like playing Hag because she is quite challanging but not as strong as Nurse (a lot of times you end chases way faster than as Nurse tho).
---
It was a literal buff
---
The power description in game still says terror rafius
---
Spirit Fury builds up on you breaking pallets so you don't need to eat the stun to get it. Each level of it takes more pallet breaks to activate, I believe its 2 pallet breaks at tier 3. 
---
I had a similar issue with Whispers and all it took was me using it a few times so I got used to looking at it to check if it was lit up, my hearing isn't best so the whooshy weird noise doesn't help me.
---
I love when it’s a full random team and they still manage to be coordinated, efficient. It’s so pleasant.
---
Feng had a few too many Pocky Sticks eh?
---
Great design, by the way.
---
Just DC so they can't get that much out of you. Literally to only counterplay. This shit makes me mad beyond believe.
---
Nonsense, he clearly has psychic powers
---
Escape is not an escape
---
yeah sure, add also a zero pallets for the killer then.
---
Very happy they were efficient indeed
---
Hag is easily A-Tier, and Wraith should probably rank with the Charlies. Other than that, I'd say pretty solid.
---
Im tired of him standing out in the open stalking me while I keep him center screen staring straight at him and i still get exposed. 
---
I like his design but the reveal mechanic seems really clunky.
---
i thought it started when a gate was opened or when the hatch was closed.
---
well i don't need slowing down perks. i need information.
---
swf is changing the designed mode to make it unbalanced, even a single call on the whole game is undair for the killer.
---
I really hate that... Especially when ppl do this against Nurse when I'm hooked in the open. She doesn't give a fck about BT, I'm going down in next 5 seconds and she gets free pressure. It's so stupid...
---
Got mori'd and my team photobombed, giant t-bag party and he let my team escape. One of them even got me my Commodius toolbox back so. Not even mad. He joined the party and we all just yelled WAZZUP for like five minutes.
---
People who play toxically don't care about the other persons experience, often use the excuse its just a game and will probably deny everything and flip it back onto you. My advice is not to message or reply because its just not worth it. Personally I have been playing other games when DBD just becomes grating.
---
In higher ranks sometimes it;s the only way to win for killer, that;s how this game is created.
---
As I said, I am frustrated about and complain about it, but sometimes I see the need for it. Playing like let's say angrypug, insidious bubba build, fuck him, he enjoy himself being peace of human garbage, good for him. But sometimes the win requires camping and tunneling, and I will never complain about killers doing it. Yea, it's frustrating for person who gets caught in crossfire, and you can call killers tryhards or whatever else you want, but it gets him 3-4K. 
---
With moris I have absolutely 0 problem. If killer is good enough do down me twice, power to him. Plus he paid a lot of bloodpoints to have whose moris. I spend probably around 2 million on my hag and I have like 4 ebony moris and 8 green ones.
---
I'm a killer main, I made that clear in my post.
---
As I also made clear, IF this were re-balanced to further discourage tunnelling, there would need to be some other benefit for killers. Some way to slow the game down a bit, without just increasing time required for generators. Killers already have a disadvantage at the moment.
---
The only reason I consider tunnelling to be 'unfair' is because it's just not plain fun for the hooked survivor. Though I have acknowledged several times that I can absolutely see why killers do it. I main Pig, so there's no incentive to me for tunnelling anyway.
---
Name checks out.
---
the key to legion is having survivors who don't to spread out vs him. 
---
seriously, once you know your fighting legion spread out across the map making FF a handicap.  
---
hes still pretty good for farming BP though
---
I get where they’re coming from. It’s easy to misinterpret someone’s intention and being a solo survivor is hard enough without having to think about whether your mates are sandbagging you or not. they shouldn’t have jumped to conclusion and insulted you, though.
---
"Just genrush lol"
---
Yeah that works on every single killer, nothing special, if 4 survs really hate actually playing the game they can end it in about 5 minutes, problem being that it's not fun for anyone and as such is not a real way to justify unfun shit.
---
I'm all ears doesn't give you useful information for Spirit... If they vault you can see scratches anyway and you can't use auras when phasing. NC and BBQ auras are useful because survivors are standing still/ you know where to search for them...
---
I'm in your lobby to make sure you will uninstall after free weekend ends
---
Bruh...
---
What the fuck is the Wake Up! bug?
---
I love it when they run up to the locker and stop running the moment they're gonna enter. Also it's very funny when they're just running in and out in front of you thinking they're invincible
---
I don't chat with anyone anymore. I have my chatbox permanently closed and no one can leave a comment on my Steam profile page.
---
His face is priceless
---
Can i get banned for this?
---
I got about 3300 hours. I started playing shortly after the huntress got released
---
&gt;  is blatantly ignorant of the fact that some people just want to play with friends instead of sweating out games left and right.
---
Again, no one is saying they don't want to play, but they shouldn't
---
If I want to play 2vs4 and rekt survivors game after game and 10.000 people more wants the same, should be allowed? Of course not, same with swf.
---
The problem here is the money, swf parties will not play solo, and if they don't offer swf, they would drop the game and lose money, so they are going with an straight breaking game mechanics just because they want, not because they are fair.
---
Thats what I was thinking. Usually if the survivors destroy the killer the chat is filled with "superiority" comments.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce_VxDsNE_g it does. you don't waste time in loops, it helps in jungle gyms when survivors try to mindgame. most helpful on Spirit to be sure where to phase
---
That's gonna take about as much time as it took to prestige them D:
---
No one else:
---
Me: this meme format has always been stupid, and the excessive overuse of it is starting to piss me off. Just look at any YouTube comment section. It's quickly becoming agitating and making me avoid comments. Soon I'll start avoiding YouTube because this format will become thumbnails and titles. Ugh.
---
Prestige 3 and fullperk is definetely something you can be proud of! What character do you have fullperk?
---
no
---
Wow Michael looks so much like the one Dwight cosmetic! It's wonderful xD
---
I have a Razer keyboard and mouse so I just use Razer Synapse. Very easy to setup but sadly it can be unreliable. There are very rare times when I start my computer and Synapse just straight up doesn't even recognize I have the keyboard plugged in. Keyboard still works fine but macros stop working. You have to completely restart your computer to fix that (I have tried simply killing and restarting Synapse). Also other very rare times it will recognize the keyboard but the macros just don't recognize they are being pressed.
---
By far the majority of the time though, it works just fine.
---
Ur joking, right?
---
Ya I thought I hit reply to the one guy. Guess not
---
To me it's only.really bothersome when they carry you there drop you close if then hook
---
"1 new comment on your profile."
---
"Ah shit. Here we go again."
---
Man....I dropped the last guy on the hatch last night as a peace offering in one of my games and he just spun in a circle, they had led me on a pretty good chase teabagging the whole way as he ran me by gens his teammates were working on and as I mori'd them with my tombstone myers set up he proceeded to keep watching me and sticking around. After about 30 seconds of this I just closed the hatch and killed him, then this guy then sent me several hate messages. This is why nobody respects survivors anymore.
---
I totally agree. I understand why someone would get upset. What I don't understand is how often people will go out of their way to message me to tell me I am trash even though it takes more effort to message someone on PS4 than it takes on PC.
---
To this point, including my prestiged survivors, it took about 3300 hours. And sadly im not even close to be done yet. Some survivors are missing and after that i have to make EVERYONE fullperk... I need a better hobby
---
😂😂 it nbd only happens sometimes
---
Decided to change my name for this screenshot. I thought its fitting lol

Literally almost impossible to get banned for changing icons. McLean said that they point the finger at EAC if changing icons is bannable or not and EAC points the finger at BHVR but they don't want to publicly admit that it is not bannable in case some isolated case happens

Only while playing agains freddy
---
You are sure right?
---
reinstalled just in case.
---
Plague and Hag. Plague makes them all one shot and then they trigger Hag's trap...  
---
Plague and Spirit. Plague makes them all one shot and Spirit downs them when they are omega loud vomitting even with iron will.  
---
Plague and Nurse. Plague makes them all one shot and Nurse finishes them off.  
---
Pig would also be very nice with other killers due to her ability to slow the game down.  
---
Plague and Plague. Plague makes them all one shot and Plague makes them all one shot.
---
Thank you! I appreciate your words.
---
As others have pointed out, just removing it won't stop others from emulating it through other means. Might as well reward a killer somehow for doing through that shitshow.
---
Yeah me too but i couldnt wait any longer to share it... He's level 50 now and this level 37 screenshot is driving me nuts
---
That's called pallet looping and killer usually DC if he can't get you
---
If you’re a Nurse main, I can see why you wouldn’t enjoy playing them because they’re nowhere near as strong. 😂
---
I always liked the M1 killers more than the likes of Billy/Nurse. With Legion, I enjoy the ability to spot multiple survivors at once. So I frenzy one, frenzy whoever else is nearby, then dedicate myself to chasing one. Assuming my Ruin doesn’t get cleansed within the first 20 seconds, I enjoy the play style. Even if it doesn’t take very long to mend, it still takes multiple survivors out of the game for several seconds. And I’ve found that enduring and save the best for last make chases pretty short as well.
---
Why be toxic to someone who wasn’t toxic to you? It doesn’t make sense. Being toxic at all doesn’t make sense. If the survivors survive then good for them they deserved it cause they outplayed the killer. If the killer 4Ks then they deserved it because they played better. There’s no reason to teabag or torture someone  to prolong the game. You’ve already won. Winning should be satisfying enough.
---
Obligatory "Where's Nea?" comment
---
:O dat a lot
---
Michael represents pupper dwight pretty well
---
Surely this is a shitpost
---
A dream you'll easily accomplish! All it takes is time. And once you achieved it you'll know how proud it can make you :3
---
What the fuck is happening ? I see nothing wrong here I see typical dbd ?
---
Ok, thanks. Just wanted some confirmation. I left the community and the last thing i heard was people getting banned for changing up things.
---
still awesome tho
---
Hey, it's not the elite dangerous reddit!
---
yep there is no problem
---
This is that map where every time I go around a corner it’s right into the killer
---
Surely this is a shitpost.
---
Hello
---
Im only missing one achievement. The one where i have to grab 20 or 25 people off gens
---
KILLERS OP PLS NERF , recently i got alot of people that DC after they go down first time or just die on hook. I miss the time where i didnt have to wait 3094230 minutes to get a full lobby as killer. But this looks more like a Surv fail round... i mean 5 gens left 4 people down/injured
---
his power ends looping, stop pallet drops and helps you locate survivors you have chased at some point.  
---
I don't think a lot of people know how to use his treatment mode.  
---
pick restraint class II/III/Note (or King) + Electrode (lowest one is best since its only 25% more cast time) shock em up while in chase now they can never hide from you again.
---
now you can just use treatment mode to stop vaults/pallets/saves its works very well once you get the timing down.  
---
I mean hes no nurse or billy but hes still pretty freaking good.
---
Imagine Jake in an Isekai Jersey
---
IMO there are way better perks to use on Spirit... Also the amount of times this perk gots wasted is atrocious. If it only didn't have such a long cooldown...
---
Because smart survivors who wait will still get a decent amount of distance before you're able to pinpoint the footsteps.
---
I get that. But that is their job as much as killing is the killers job. Annoy, distract, keep busy. This is literally all the survivor has in its arsenal.
---
I dunno, just put that person on a hook... That will satisfy your annoyance with the teabagging flashlighting claudette. If the answer to that is you can't. Then that is your problem. Every basic mechanic of killers are designed so that in a chase you will eventually catch them. (if it were straightforward)
---
They did mention in a recent livestream about a Nurse either "rework" or something like that. I'm assuming they're going to finally kill off the extra blink addons, maybe leave the Fragile Wheeze (+1 blink, no negative effects) but make it Ultra Rare. And also kill off the range addons or fix them so that to reach the maximum distance, you'll actually have to charge it proportionately because as it is now, range addons make charge speed completely pointless.
---
Here's to hoping they don't actually nerf her and just fix the busted range addons, remove the busted extra blink addons, give her some ultra rares, and maybe just leave it at that. Yeah she is strong, maybe make it so she can be pallet stunned out of blinks or right after because that would bring her down a peg. Right now she ignores pallet stuns pretty much always even if she just finished a blink. It just makes the stun sound and she's like, OK. If they can do some general quality of life changes for the survivor side that don't butcher her, I'm ok with her being adjusted a bit. But she doesn't need nerfs.
---
Pig on the other hand... why? What did she do to deserve this? :(
---
You know I went to add her but must have forgot so she's busy playing smash
---
I'm glad there's none of that on ps4.
---
Anything to put freddy at the bottom 😔
---
Darn
---
 Here is the proof of McLean saying that: https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudSweetStingrayPeteZarollTie
---
Just don't forget to close your game before you change anything in the files :)
---
Like a YouTuber I watch once said: ''We just have to live with the fact that we're addicted to a game we hate.'' quite accurate
---
Hey guys I have an out of topic question, does pop the weasel regress 25% of the entire repair bar or just the progress done?
---
I took a screenshot of both parts and edited them together
---
Smoke weed?
---
Random wheel builds... Thats gonna be fun and totally not frustrating!
---
Pure skill and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Can’t even take the L like a man.
---
From my experience usually the other way around, killers talking mad shit after we drop a GG. Or they just immediatly disconnect 'cause they know they were being a dick
---
It really do
---
You beat me by one second.
---
Lol i wish
---
Halloween flashlights were orange.
---
Yeah, the lunge is ridiculous.
---
whatever just stop shipping the characters it's a horror game ffs
---
Completely unrelated but it still baffles me that we don't have a horse mask cosmetic for Jake.
---
Just make sure killers is not close enough to hear locker close. Because yes, killers can hear locker being closed, I had a lot of easy pulls from the lockers. Also it's only viable if killer doesn't know you are where, if he does, like if you are next a working gen, better take a hit and have a small chase, than be downed immediately.
---
I've been thinking this for awhile now.  The doctor's power is that he can make himself move slower so that he can move even slower while charging an attack that doesn't damage or slow the survivor.  Against good survivors, trying to shock at a loop will often just lead to giving them another loop for free.  His power is often more of a detriment to him than to the survivor.
---
When I first started playing, as with many others, I thought the doctor was very strong and made stealth basically impossible which meant you would be found and then it was just inevitable until you die.  Now I realize that even trapper can shut down loops/end chases more effectively and doctor can struggle to apply enough pressure to end the game before the survivors escape.
---
Gorsh!
---
Lmao
---
Hag + Mint Rag + Ebony Mori = ggez. Hook, place a trap, completely bypass their crouching and just manually teleport to the hook, down, mori, repeat. It's bullshit. I've only ever faced it twice because I guess people realize how scummy it is and don't do it often. It's just filthy.
---
Yeah i feel you, soon i wont have enough time either. Thats the advantage of studying i guess, lots of free time
---
These killer ranking lists on this sub just keep getting better, now I want "Killer ranked or how much their face looks like pepperoni pizza"
---
I dont get it
---
Ah ok i see MoriCafe
---
Thats gross. And funny to imagine
---
This tier list definitely has some differences than the most common ones I see that pop up,  but I actually agree with this one pretty much spot on. Maybe I'd switch the placement of some within the same tiers, but it's really close either way.  
---
As often as I think hag is underrated, it's hard to put Billy below her. Freddy could even be bumped above wraith I think and there's a case to be made for clown over pig but it's pretty minor either way. 
---
It's nice to see someone else willing to put doctor bottom tier, I just have yet to see his power be as effective as pretty much any other killer in high rank games.
---
Thanks :) survivors next :D
---
The entity wasn't impressed with your toxic behavior.
---
Hag needs to get into SS, Huntress in S.
---
Wraith is a tree boi, so his breath smells of faint earth, cypress and bark. Not everyone's cup of tea but definitely not bad. Put him in B.
---
Ghostie puts on cologne when he's killing people, and considers himself an artist. No way he'd go stinky bretah. A!
---
Oh really? That’s great
---
Clown and wraith to C, doctor to D
---
I remember when I was playing spirit with rancor perk  and after opening the exit gate someone cleared the node totem and when I went to exit gate my obsession was tea bagging. I didn't care about other survivor, went for slash, was successful. Before he crawled to exit picked him fast and for his slow and painful death hooked him in front of exit gate. Other survivor became scared and ran away through exit gate.
---
I love how freddy has his unique little section. A special placing for a special boy
---
Freddy is God tier on console. Enough said. That's at rank 1 where the most active players are.
---
I didn't say Doctor wasn't a good pick. My point is there is no one killer that is god-tier at getting bloodpoints, but every killer you're good with will suffice if you're using BBQ(for x2 bp)
---
It is so frustrating for him to 99% you easily because any random ass tree breaking line of sight immediately resets your reveal progress, and then as soon as he catches up to you he stalks you **instantly**. **While you are staring at him**.
---
Let the voice of love take you to the hatch
---
Wait. Was there really a episode with a villain looking like myers?
---
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THE TRAPPER,  BUT IT WAS ME,  DIO
---
'Specially with all the cake lately.
---
It’s not cheap. I may be flamed for this idea but I think ruin needs to not be a perk, but a game mechanic. Like if a survivor hits a good skill check it should just slow down the progress. This would not only slow down gen speed (big problem atm), make skill checks actually prove the players skill and also frees up perk space for killers. Just an idea and I don’t want to get shat on for this idea, just a thought.
---
Keanu reeves is a terrible actor. Change my mind.
---
I mean I saw a bamboozle happen to me earlier today, so it feels like it's working.
---
There really isn’t much to do. Tunneling is something on the killer side that you can’t prevent. If they want to tunnel you you just have to do your best to hold out as long as you can. In this situation I always know I’ll end up dead but if I can get my other 3 teammates out alive then that’s a win for me and a depip for the killer
---
How the fuck you expect him to be good at video games when he hasn't even figured out shirts yet?
---
When mad grit works, it’s so fun to see all these survivors think they are so clever but they are actually helping you.
---
Very fine. It is essentially the same thing. Which is what makes being annoying/"an asshole"(in this minor definition) totally acceptable for survivors. Because it is their job and a potentially necessary strategy to distract the killer. 
---
Killers are basically saying.... "Erm could you distract me in a slightly more nice way please while I hunt you down and kill you. It is upsetting me because there are 4 of you and it is annoying when I see you crouching"
---
Then. "Erm I know I was trying to kill you all by any means necessary a second ago. But now that you have won the game and are finally safe. Could you not celebrate or show off please. It upsets me to the point where I won't force you out of the game" (essentially the same as ragequitting - except they know if they ragequit they get no points)
---
Nurse
---
Hillbilly
---
Doctor
---
At least three killers that you can't just genrush, soooo
---
Why are you acting like survivors are in the wrong for doing the objective?
---
Thank you, maybe it’s not showing on the killers screen? Hard to believe it would just be an issue for me, but at least I can continue to run it.l and not feel wasted.
---
That’s my favorite thing ever, love seeing good survivors just go in on the toxic survivors lmao
---
The only moments when playing killer does not cause me anxiety is when I decide to forget that I'm supposed to hook everyone until they die, I'm just going from chase to chase, to another chase to another, most times I didn't even hook them to reinforce in my mind that I don't seek to kill them. I love doing it with the clown, using an antiloop build
---
I don't even know who he is
---
The game is at a state where all of that is unnecessary unless you’re trying to get a guy off hook in endgame
---
If you’re past rank 10 and the killer doesn’t seem very good, assume they have noed. There’s a reason they are at that rank.
---
Sounds are fucked, as always, just different with each patch. I can confirm from my end as Survivor and as Killer Bamboozle makes close to no sound but its working.
---
Bubba was one of my first ones too, hes oddly adorbale
---
I got in Streams of non-popular Streamers though!
---
Lol. Just did a macro for smashing space bar. Go to hook, press 1 button and chill till free or dead.
---
I know right? How dare i distract the killer so my teammate can unhook someone. Using an ingame item to make the killer drop someone? Being able to outrun/loop a guy with a knife who is literally way faster than you?  Lock me up, cause i'm a hecking toxic criminal.
---
Is there a special treat for the last customer of the day?
---
I've seen myself in some livestreams with less popular streamers - always good to share and see their reaction!
---
Not to mention that most survivors who are willing to abuse it are too lazy to spend their time getting wake up on other survivors
---
I could hear the flicking fire from the totem as soon as I spawned.
---
They fixed sounds? The sounds are bugged on my end actually, I can’t even hear the chase music or anything, the only thing I can hear are generators and breathing but sometimes I can’t even hear that
---
(Mostly a killer main) How he acted was honestly douchey as he could of went with it another way, but usually if you sabotage someone Intentionally or unintentionally I personally think you should at least acknowledge what you did, apology or not. Especially team games like OverWatch,Rainbow etc.
---
Survivors are a team when it comes down to it, you don't see rank 1-5 Screwing each other over. Idk just my opinion personally.
---
Suomi mainittu, morilla tavataan
---
Dont care about rank and play for fun.
---
I'm some what of a sadist so I enjoy killing people. 
---
Don't focus on ranking up and you'll rank up over time. Only way to get better anyway is to just press play.
---
I only have problems with 3 or 4 man swf. Thats when theyve got too much coordination and communication and have a major advantage over you. A majority of them are rather toxic, but not always.
---
I have the same problem. I’ve only ever played killer in a KYF and I love it. I have all the killers aswell and I’ve sat in lobbies before and then just left bc I get anxiety before the match starts. 
---
I’m a survivor main &amp; I never tbag or do anything “toxic” bc I know how the killer mains feel
---
There are four survivors per match.
---
There is one killer per match.
---
Therefore, there will always be more survivor toxicity than killer toxicity, leading to a high amount of people acknowledging one side's toxicity than the other.
---
That is why I say not all.
---
Yes I know, playing with friends is fun, and if you use the comms for fun and small detais, it doesn't make you toxic or anything. the problem is those who could go without perks and still get an unfair advantage and still knowing that, they choose to play like that. I would call those toxic.
---
Haha i feel you
---
New killer and event , you earn more bloodpoints playing killer so if you queue as killer the wait times are going to be substantially longer than survivor
---
I will give this mentality a go, thanks
---
Hey I got stuck in that locker too last week!
---
I was in a few very small streams, but as far as I know that's all. Either way I still enjoyed being in it!
---
Honestly I’d feel like we should bc then we don’t have to get “personal” messages from killers/survivors that can go on and on.
---
You could say Freddy is his big brother,
---
Oh. That makes sense.
---
This is...surprisingly wholesome.
---
Wait can you seriously see their faces I've never once seen anyone's face through a locker
---
Please read through the Reddit as this post is like the 8,067th one, new killer plus event means long killer queue times as you get more bloodpoints playing killer.
---
I usually just instantly type ggwp as killer and survivor. Obviously I also have my frustration post-game chats, but I try not to.
---
Tips for anyone struggling with toxicity: just start forcing yourself to always type ggwp instantly after death and it'll become second nature eventually^^
---
Entertaining read.
---
All the assholes who abused legion got a new toy to play with. Stealthy killer with no terror radius and don't need to run insidious and stand in place, it's asshole heaven.
---
Pig has a pig face on. how can she be B tier?
---
Don't play for kills and/or ranks. Play to have fun... or to get a lot of BPs
---
Exactly, his power helps survivors more than it helps Doctor himself. Sometimes you can stop even pallet looping on long loops when survivors become too greedy - they need to adjust their playstyle to Doctor, but it's not really challanging. It's like baiting Huntress' hatchets besides Huntress' hatchets may be lethal. His ability needs a lot of buffs and his anti-stealth is crap since stealth isn't meta at all. It can be used if you want to check if there's someone near your totems at the begining of a trial, but after survivors reach tier 1 it becomes not so useful without certain addons.  
---
He has really great potential to be at least decent. He would still be m1 killer probably but some tweaks would maybe make him somehow viable.
---
Use all of them if you want, so long as the chase lasts 5 minutes and you get the most out of them. If your team hasn’t done gens in that time it’s their own fault. If you’re not looping and just running from pallet to pallet throwing them down then that’s not good.
---
You can't set a number or a range of how many pallets should be used per chase, as there're too many variables.  
---
If you're having a hard time window-looping, that just means the killers have gotten better, and you need to step up your game as well; try predicting when the killer will try to mind-game around a window and work according to that.   
---
A tip I can give you, though, is to make sure you aren't turning pallet-filled areas to dead areas; skip a pallet if possible and go to another one that's further ahead.
---
everyone
---
Yes. On Xbox and PS4.
---
I prefer playing solo as well, which doesnt seem to be the popular opinion. I just enjoy it more because it makes the game feel how its supposed to, if that makes sense.
---
I don't see his power stoping pallet, charging still takes too much time and slows you too much. I think he is quite decent in killer shack tho, but good survivors will just don't go there.
---
Don't forget the rage when you find them on a hunch.
---
Shiiiiiiit dude I didn’t know that
---
You’re playing new legion too. Hits even harder how bad he is
---
All very true statements besides ending a loop faster than nurse. Ive played against nurses who end chases before theyve begun and stop you from even starting a loop. Good nurses are crazy hard to play against
---
I got this poor Claudette back to back in the locker lmao it was guessing and luck that got her.
---
PC here.  
---
This is very annoying as I mostly enjoy playing Killer and I mostly upgraded killers rather than survivors.
---
When you say "past rank 10" do you mean 11+ or 9-?
---
It's just a mask though.
---
My point from the first post still stands btw: Huntress lives alone in an abandoned cottage in a forest. She's S tier stanky. Hag is literally half a corpse, with deformed hands and mouth, eating raw human flesh. Pus oozing out and all. Super stanky. Freddy doesn't even have a smell, as he only exists in dreams, amirite?
---
Damn, that's kind of hot and creepy at the same time.
---
Hey, he’s a cutie in his own way
---
❤️
---
Think you get 1000 for unhooking and an additional 500 for safe unhook. Don’t play a lot of survivor though.
---
Thank you :)
---
Yea, I disagree with a lot of tier lists. Especially about Freddy, ppl also tend to underestimate Pig and Hag.   
---
Idk, Billy is quite loopable and he relies a lot on survivors' mistakes. Hag relies on mistakes too (swarming hooks, dying near basement) but I think she's more consistent and self-reliant than Billy. Billy is also more map-dependant. Hag has bad maps as well but she's not as hindred as Billy on his. But I know it's kinda slippery topic. Personally I think Hag is at least slightly better.  
---
Yea, the C tier is quite arguable too, I don;t really know if GF shouldn't be the bottom C or if Freddy isn't better than Wraith. With Wraith you can do some nasty things if you don't comit to chases too much.  
---
The most difficult tier to make for me was probably B tier. it's quite random. Pig has built-in ruin and some mindgames, Clown is still bugged, and has quite simple counterplay, Michael is basically m1 killer but instadowns and low TR, Plague can be really powerful but she's genrushable af and Huntress is omega map-dependant and her little mistakes can punish her really badly. That was hard to do... Sometimes I think Pig is better than Myers and sometimes I think Plague may be better than Huntress. So yea, it's random.
---
Yeah cause she stole the breaths of a lot of people in crotus prenn
---
I've been slaughtered by Hexy a few times, so I'll go check his stream when the match is over.  He apologized once because he was doing his nurse daily and absolutely destroyed us with a mori (not that he needed the mori except to get the daily).  
---
It's a reality check for me, because I keep slipping into red ranks though I'm absolutely not red rank survivor material.
---
DS, Adrenaline, BT, DH/BL.
---
to be fair, these are purple/green ranks
---
Because your question has already been answered 8567 times.
---
We, as in the survivors, sometimes SWF. But no, we(sef) actually dont do that shit. We just want to play the game.
---
But you have fatigue and you have to blink, Hag hits, drinks blood and BUM hits again. Not always ofc, Nurse is more consistent. I know LF may end chases even faster but lets not be joking.  
---
The advantage of Hag is that she can be at multiple places at the time. Nurse is still better tho.
---
It’s really just your rng.
---
That looks like a really nice café
---
I played against that guy a few times last night. I made sure he didn’t make it out.

This happened to me last night and I just closed the game and played something else. Hard to justify waiting so long for a game.
---
Same for me. Not that I'm complaining though.
---
I always try to excape first cause of this lol

Anytime. The more people that know about it, the less likely they are too accidentally exploit it.
---
I was literally listening to this song right now
---
If you know how to create a good web on map you're playing at, she has insane map control and ends chases very quickly. Her hook control is insane and she has the best basement in the game.
---
The contrarian attitude usually stems from a desire to shut the circle-jerk up. 
---
Because of his recent boom in popularity and his face being *basically everywhere*, I can understand the desire to say “shut the fuck up he’s not that amazing, fuck.”
---
The actual truth
---
It’s hilarious. Gotta say that video might be my favorite though.
---
Like most have said, you have to forget about your rank and play each match for fun.  Though I tend to not follow my own advice and get easily aggravated when two gens have popped and I'm still chasing the first guy I saw.
---
I agree that it would be frustrating to think you've been sandbagged by your teammate. I just think they didn't have to send abuse at the front of the conversation. They sent me this immediately after they got hooked. What I think it is interesting is that it's not as easy to send a message through PS4 as it is to send one on PC but people take their time to do it anyway because they are so upset.
---
The problem is that ppl are afraid to use other perks because they will loose, get teabagged and said GG EZ in the end game chat.
---
Her fat thighs are wider than the pallet stun range
---
I saw one on how often survivors get laid, we need one for killers
---
Just change it to mouse wheel
---
For real, who is he?
---
This is what happens when the blood hunt has taken more of your life then you wanted.
---
Yeah her and leatherface would be good for basement, and if you place traps right you could end chases quickly. I personally wouldn’t rank her A, probably B, like I know she can be good it’s just I don’t know how to play her properly. Thanks for the reasoning behind it.
---
Tried that a long time ago, felt worse than hitting spacebar imo.
---
How long ago did you purchase it? In the disclaimers for any purchase on any digital purchase has a 24-48 hour delivery time and if it hasn’t appeared by then, then you request support . So just wait and I’m guessing you restarted you PlayStation if you already did all those steps but the only solution is to wait until after their disclaimer time
---
Balanced as in he is not underpowered, but not powerful enough to have more strengths than weaknesses
---
They should have flare guns!! I was thinking to include this with my new Survivor suggestion!
---
Why is Ryn tier A??
---
That makes sense, I didn’t think about that
---
I wish i had one
---
I am terrible Billy and Nurse but I know they are both strong :D Hag is indeed very difficult, requires a lot of strategical thinking and knowledge about survivors pathing, not just braindead chasing with some basic-bee tch mindgames :D
---
i mean he could have finished the gens and then escape
---
What's the name of this show again? I can't remember for the life of me.
---
One time I only managed to kill one survivor as they were a group of friends who would constantly teabag and pallet loop me and the one guy I killed happened to be trying to survive as a specific survivor for a mission. At the post-game chat the salt was unbelievable, they even had the audacity to accuse me of tunnelling even though the other three were playing as Claudette and I could never find them!
---
Yes, you will show me how badass you are by dcimg, I won't laugh my hell out, no, I will cry because you dced insteas of genrushing
---
Honestly just treat it like a non competitive game because that's what it is.
---
Or just go into games satisfied with a black pip, then anything else is a bonus, I'm in red ranks atm so sometimes losing is unescapeable so who cares apart from you as the player?
---
Fun tip : Don't react to salt/shitty messages and just laugh at survs being sad enough to message you in the first place.
---
I agree they should do an update that disables the perk, but those who abuse it deserve too get banned. They know what they are doing and fully deserve what they get. You reap what you sow.
---
Same question lol
---

Yea, it's my biggest problem, my X button on controller probably gonna die way faster than any other button for playing dbd.

He's in the second row. If you look closely you can see the slight shimmer outline of the wraith. You may need to turn up your brightness to see it.
---
Michael Pickles?
---
If you don't own every licensed DLC, Ebony Moris are harder to come by. 
---
In many bloodwebs Splinters will take the place that should've been an ultra rare item (add-on or mori).
---
Yeah i shouldve but i had borrowed do i knew i coul save him it, the only question was if we could get out in time
---
I love this
---
I can’t play billy for shit but I’ve been doing pretty good as nurse so that’s a good thing
---
These memes/fads come and go constantly. In a month we’ll all forget this was even a thing. People just get worked up over the dumbest shit.
---
This community Sure likes their shirtless males...
---
Good concept but needs some tweaks. Plus they already have a priest in the game, The Plague.
---
DBD is too fucking ez
---
Small game and spine chill: I see you, see me, see your totem ;)
---
What I do is looping the killer around the pallet for like a min each. This will give your team enough time to get all gens but be prepared ti get facecamp if he manages to knock you down :)
---
Adrenaline - do the last one or two gens injured and use Adrenaline to heal when the gates power.
---
An exhaustion perk - helps to extend chases. Usually either Dead Hard or Balanced Landing. 
---
Decisive Strike - helps with tunnelling, or escaping once the gates are open. 
---
Borrowed Time - helps save your team from campers or for clutch end game saves. Also pretty much the only defence against the basement. 
---
Spine Chill - not really considered meta, but I thought I’d mention it. It’s really useful currently while people are still trying out Ghostface since you can immediately know if you’re being stalked. 
---
Best items are med kits for early game heals, and toolboxes for gens.
---
Jesus dude, ofcourse we tell eachother the aproximate location of the Hex, emphasis on aproximate cause we can't do much more then tell eachother 'uh, im pretty sure killer is going your way' . For a guy defending the honour of killers, you sure like to look at everything from the worst toxic angle possible. Not every survivor is a rank 1 loop God trying to piss in your cereal, i know me and my friends definitely arent. Most killers are chill and like to just have a GG, but obviously there are a bunch of twats out there.

---
I have not been lucky enough, though I did play against monto at one point which was cool, though he gen rushed me :C
---
You to account management, restore liscenses. That will remind the game what you rate. After that load up dbd and go into the store, it'll give you the auric cells
---
Sometimes I say GG EZ messages to all survivors to bait the angry messages
---
Guess people like that need to win no matter what in vidya to feel big and worthy or something. Goes both ways(surv and killer).
---
I love mad grit
---
Ahhh 2am... the perfect time to rerun a creepy ass (but good, mind you) show like this.
---
Happens every time I play Plague.
---
Just don’t get hooked on it and you’ll be fine
---
I generally play the game how I want to play it, regardless of how other people feel.
---
Maybe I'll feel bad for the last guy I downed so I give him the hatch because the match went by too quickly.
---
Maybe I'll tunnel the Kate who just appeared out of thin air to blind me, followed by a teabag.
---
One survivor out of the four in the match can't truly speak for the entire team, but being the only killer in the match means I can speak for my side because I'm the only one on my side.
---
I like survivors who aren't toxic.
---
You guys get to live.
---
No he played out the match, I did message him and send him this video,
---
I had a nea and a two other survivors who kept saboeing every single fucking hook and then just ran into the corner so if I picked them up, I couldn’t get to a hook. The poor poor ash, he wasnt with them and by the time the gens were done, I downed him and the fuckin nea kept following me and had the hooks sabotaged. So what did I have to do? I had to fucking stay right on the ash because if I left, he’d get up because they weren’t leaving. So I had to stay on him, and basically camp the poor dude until the hooks came back. I finally got him on a hook, couldn’t get anybody else though. 
---
It was like??? My second game as spirit and I was *trying* to learn her. Didn’t get much learning done that round
---
Had to send the ash an apology because I felt bad but he said he had fun that game so at least the game wasn’t all bad I guess? 
---
Pretty sure ash was the only one on that team that actually played. Like, if you 99% hooks to try to sabo them if someone gets downed near them and you’re close enough? That’s fair play. But literally just hiding in the corner of the map after you and your three friends sabotage 5 hooks back to back without doing any generators? That’s the most boring shit I’ve ever went against
---
Germanic languages tend to be really streamlined in general

---
that is more tick rate and hitbox issues. 
---
Lag switching, and overall having the killer hosting is a major problem. If he lags, everyone BUT HIM on his screen jumps or stands in place. How is that fair in a 1v4 scenario?
---
Killers still host games
---
Now, you don't enter a lobby until the matchmaking servers deem you are eligible for a game (There are no other killers ahead of you in the queue currently looking for survivors)
---
Recent bloodhunt and now event offerings give more bloodpoints so now more people are playing killer than before slowing the queues down.
---
You're still being put into a match, its just prioritizing people that have been queued up longer before it finds you survivors.  
---
Note: Matchmaking is currently fucked and ranks/locations when matched with players is currently all over the place
---
I hooked someone in the basement with 2 gens left and 1 dead survivor, killer shack, and then a survivor looped me around the killer shack with the survivor in the basement.
---
Both of the surviving survivors went into the basement after I broke the shack pallet which led to their death, then they complained about camping and how I'm trash.
---
Maybe don't keep me next to your teammates.
---

I purchased the $4.99 pack last Wednesday and the $9.99 pack last night. Hopefully they show up soon if that’s the case then. Thank you!
---
I’ve seen this on a picture someone took in the forums, but I’ve personally see them on Crotuss Penn in the main area. Their is usually 2 pallets their and I try too burn them ASAP.
---
The Entity said “oooh bitch I like this hair. It’s mine now hoe.”
---
OMG, I can only remember about those Italian hands memes lol
---
This is comparable to me to how they change MoM and I heard nothing but complaints from killer mains about that perk. Hell, I hated it. But I don't think they have much room to complain because that was essentially the same thing.
---
That is what we call a lag switch. Weather intentional or not. Still funny af though.
---
Oh fricken well until the games balance gets better, until all crutch perks get gutted and all the other killers get brought up to the same level as nurse...too bad...shes the only killer where the killer can win with their own skill and not survivors mistakes so oh well/.
---
holy shit I thought you were trolling for a sec
---
Ghostface: rapes
---
I restored the licenses last night while on the phone with playstation support and it didn’t work. I tried deactivating my PS4 as my primary PS4 and reactivating and that didn’t work either. But I didn’t actually load the store up to see if they showed up. I’ll try that when I get home from work today and see if they show up. Thank you!
---
I used to be like this, but it often does fade the more you play. Getting more confident in your killer skills and having quite a few games under your belt helps. You start to see patterns in survivor behaviour that helps you predict what they’ll do, and you learn not to be thrown off by stuff that tilts newer killers like body blocking or tea bagging. 
---
You just have to consciously remind yourself that it’s only a game, and not let your ego get invested in the outcome of the match. Instead of playing to win, try shifting your mindset so that you’re playing to have fun and get better. This way if you have a bad match, you can focus on what you’ll do differently next time - for example I recently had an awful match that put me in a bad mood for a bit, but after thinking about it I realised that I kept breaking pallets I should have left, which extended my chases and lost me time. It gives me something to focus on in future matches and helps me realise that ultimately, I had the power to make the match go better. Every bad match is a learning experience.
---
Yeah happened to me a week ago. Needless to say I’ve never felt so betrayed in my entire life lmao
---
If this conversation was a pokemon, it would be a shiny one lol
---
I've only it seen it spectating my friends, I trust killers who might be being nice less and less now 😂 just hook is !
---
Man that poor ghostface. He was being super kind too.
---
"Let the joy of love give you cancer"
---
sounds like the killer made an assumption about you and you proved the killer right.
---
I’m not sure.
---
You kidding? Myers not in s tier? Guess people with class are just not in demand anymore
---
Your saying a moldy corpse is alright? But anyways put legion higher and you got what would if been somewhat of my list
---
MORILLE
---
Remember spirit has a ton of glass in her body... that would hurt a lot tbh
---
Myers dont have map pressure, the insta its only for one minute, he can be looped, he cant do anything againts the gen Rush. The only balanced killer un this game is the spirit, the nurse is broken, billy need tweaks and the others need buffs
---
“Being chases for 20 minutes”
---
Eh, at this point I didn't care. Just wanted to get him back for wasting my time.
---
“What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land”  .jpg
---
I do think there’s something wrong, I played this game for a long time and it has never been this bad
---
This is a thread worried about a hypothetical ghostface nerf and it's kind of disingenuous to say "he's never been nerfed!" like that's not the topic of the thread
---
I didnt know there was one like that in Finland. You learn new everyday
---
I don see it
---
When this happens, just record for about 10 minutes and report them. If they are completely ignoring their objectives, this would be bannable.
---
Are you kidding? Suzie SS
---
Props for that Simpsons font
---
Yeah, as much as I’m a Wraith main I’ve had to play all the other killers to get some teachables and BBQ and such, Legion oddly works well since you get hit points and deviousness points for frenzy stabs. And I’m pretty decent with them so I can usually 2-hook everyone before I let them go like the nice guy I am and end the match with 4 stacks and 30k points while burning streamers or cakes.
---
The worst part is I had the chance to struggle out but he dropped and shook his head so I thought he was bringing me to the hatch to let me go. Instead he brought me to the hatch and closed it then hooked me. Simply gut wrenching.
---
Whats bugged with it
---
Don’t disrespect my billy boy
---
Agreed. I don't think talking about annoying or game breaking mechanics is toxic necessarily. For me it's all in the behavior and if survivors are being assholes or not.
---
Revealing ghostface stood directly in front of me? Nope
---
Revealing ghostface by staring at the tiniest piece of his whooshy whoosh bits sticking out from behind a corner? Yes
---
Woah he just did
---
This is not happening meta perk confirmed
---
Yep, I've gotten pretty good as guessing when a killer will have NOED. If they're not putting out much pressure during the match, it's a VERY high chance they've got it.
---
If you’re facing purple or red ranks w/o ruin 2-3gens would be done by the time you hook someone. It’s almost mandatory
---
See, I found that even more awkward. I might try switching to m5 or something. Any kind of non-stop, repeated motion is probably going to be uncomfortable though.
---
Well I mean, I haven't spoken to everyone. My opinion goes for killers and survivors alike. I don't get all upset when I get teabagged by ghostface. I actually find it funny. It happened when I was trying to gather up chase points for a daily ritual at the end of the game. I was just like, fairplay. I've had big teabag parties with a ghostface at the gates.
---
My point is people shouldn't class teabagging as toxic behaviour. And even when they are doing it to mock you.. Don't take it so personally. It is a humorous thing. it all depends on how you take it and how much you let it upset you.
---
Well the bonus could easily be take away from survivors who either don't struggle, or keep trying to yolo
---
Dont worry lil buddy just run iri + infantry belt huntress and show them how fair everything is :)
---
Does BHVR actually ban people? Never ever heard of someone getting banned
---
I play both and have noticed some hate when I play killer. But I have received way more nice messages than negative when playing survivor, from killers and survivors alike.
---
They were rank 4 and rank 7 and I think they just wanted to be cunts.
---
Sounds like a lot of you are mashing way harder than necessary. You only need to tap like 2 or 3 times per second and you don't have to press all the way down. This isn't the MGS torture room sequences.
---
It concerns me that hag is not last tier.
---
Heard him say recently that "the Nurse is the best killer they made, she's perfectly balanced, has lots of counterplay, but her addons make her broken", or that Spirit is all about "mindgames". 
---
Spirit has collision on you when she's phasing (so she can know where you are exactly), and it doesn't matter where you run to, because it's all just random. It's just a coin toss (which Tru3 himself is perfectly okay), so how is that "mindgames".
---
Also him using the word "mindgames" every few seconds ResidentSleeper
---
True but half the time it's because the killer immediately leaves as if they're shameful for not killing all
---
I wouldn't shed a tear if it was removed.
---
Hehe Meg Donalds
---
Even more so, downing the Obsession counts as "losing" them, so you regain the stack that you lost from hitting them the first time.
---
But she was taken immediately after death, it's not lke she ever started decaying. She came home from work that day, an ordinary young woman. Probably not the freshest breath, but definitely not stinky. And I can guarantee you, young (Japanese) women make sure they smell nice.
---
Oh you didn't know about Claudette's "Stealth Mode"?
---
AHHAHAHA no wtf lol
---
Only purpose of presaging is for the bloody cosmetics. I’m quite new too but I believe once you get to rank 50 you can prestige although this will remove all your perks to begin another bloodweb (don’t have to get teachable perks again) and you can do this 3 times on each character
---
Congrats on being part of the problem, do you also insidious camp with leatherface to "bait angry messages."
---
Might have been drunk when he did this
---
Your knowledge on young japanese women concerns me
---
Remove all my perks? Fuckkkkkk that. Can I infinitely purchase the level 50 tree ?
---
Does franklins work with feral frenzy?
---
Why should we? You're allowed to have an opinion, despite how stupid and wrong it is.
---
u/Oicmorez
---
Lol yeah so does everyone else
---
I was about to write the same, haha. Take my upvote
---
So everyone else's connection and experience should suffer?
---
This is the /only/ way of balancing things connection wise. The amount of games I decide to try with some killer's connection in the yellow, only for it to spike horribly at random intervals and get you downed just makes the experience awful.
---
Killers are the only beneficiary to no dedicated servers, dedicated servers, while potentially crap until they work out the bugs, will make for equal playing field
---
You hit the nail on the hate mate
---
The only thing I disagree on is Huntress should be A tier. She's not as mobile as Nurse/Billy/Spirit but with enough practice she is a beast with those hatchets.
---
Prestiging resets your character to level 1 and you lose all perks, items and add ons (but you get a nifty cosmetic). Prestige 3 is the maximum you can reach. If you continue to level the character at level 50 you will eventually obtain every perk at tier 3. You can do this without prestiging but if you do ever decide to prestige, all those bloodpoints (and it is a lot of bloodpoints) will have been wasted. There is no limit to the number of bloodwebs you can go through so whenever you get new teachable perks they will be able to show up on future bloodwebs.
---
Why would they put NSFW shit in a game to appeal and please peoples weird fantasies and fetishes?
---
Is this not in the trailer
---
Thanks for the explanation :) cleared up some questions i had on my mind
---
Id get that, if they had like two rank 20s in the swf. But ALL of them are higher level than me
---
Yeah once you complete the tier 50 bloodweb it will be replaced by another. The prestige is like a click and hold icon in the middle of the bloodweb
---
Amanda should be top tier
---
This comment is so on point. My God. Just trying to get out of those ranks is punishment enough. I get being stealthy and being new to the game but damn haha
---
Can we agree on taking a stand when fellow survivors say "easy"? I for one take the killer's side in that case and bash the survivor for being disrespectful. If the other survs join me in that, the joke quickly goes on the " easy" sayer. Jump on the bandwagon.
---
I love it when survivors flame me for leaving them to die and not running out there to try and make a save with noed active. 
---
It's in the name you clowns, NOed puts the NO in saving you.
---
The worst is if I catch someone and get them into the basement I walk off and see someone sprint towards it then get called a camper because I take out both of them as they try to come up the stairs.
---
Wow what the fuck
---
I hope your joking
---
This is gonna suck :( I guess it’s time I stop hoarding my gateus, need nifty hag cosmetic
---
Huh, well there’s 0 chase music or terror radius on my end, which means I can’t play survivor anymore. Seriously, last time I played as survivor a huntress snook up on me cuz there were 0 sounds
---
Erm thick boi clown bottom tier? Ur standards are low bro
---
THATS WHAT I WAS THINKING HAHAHA
---
But Billy's kisses tho :(... "What dat mouth do doe?! "
---
As a killer main, it depends mostly on the killer. If you’re a trapper, pig or other m1 killer that struggles with pallets like freddy, its almost a necessity. 
---
When you run it on killers like spirit, nurse, huntress, and billy, it becomes more sad than anything really.
---
I think that wraith would be quite aware of his breath and take good care of it. 
---
Legion is probably a chainsmoker who tries and cover it up with too much gum. 
---
Rest of the list looks about perfect.
---
Encouraging survivors to use wake up right now is really shitty ngl
---
&gt;Far too many braindead idiots who actively swarm a killer who can now easily oneshot them under the delusion that for whatever reason they deserve a quad escape every game
---
but but but noed is broken crutch bad perk! It's so much easier to cry about the perk than it is to adept or play around it.
---
Yeah but it least it's your fault and you have a reason to fix your wifi, why would a killer fix their wifi? It makes the game easier to have garbage ping.
---
Idk why people are downvoting you instead of replying with an answer if they know better. I don't know the answer in this case. Event items always remain usable but offerings tend to be disabled, although since this offering doesn't change anything on the map like previous event offerings it may well remain usable.
---
I wish I could say this is fake but over the past couple of weeks I've started playing killer quite a bit and basically being efficient or good at killing survivors= tunneling or camping or you're a trash killer.
---
Thats ok
---
I’ve had 10 fucking Freddy offerings pop up in my last 10 levels, I wanna try not him
---
But then how would I get that sweet, sweet karma?
---
I pretty much get the same thing cause i pretty much always have a flashlight as survivor, then again my spirit fury enduring wraith has some good results too.
---
I would LOVE an ability to kick the survivor trying to unhook you. This needs to be in the game to at least counter the abuse. You'll still die on hook but still...
---
Depending on how the game is going I'll down the unhooked survivor to ensure the other gets no safe unhook point and then leave them there until a teammate gets them back up and then head towards the unhooker, I dont want to punish the unhooked but I'm also not going to just let it happen in front of me like that's a smart move
---
A huge portion of "fuck i forgot i had mori"
---
doing 5 gens solo without the killers help? no one would give you karma for that
---
I bring em to the hatch, close it ... Them bring them to the door so they can wiggle out, open it and escape. 
---
Points for all!
---
Yes, everyone would love that, but the problem is that they have heaps and heaps of spaghetti code. They can't just disable things in a hotfix. The spaghetti code is the reason why things like this happen in the first place, the patch has absolutely nothing to do with the effected perks yet things still get fucked!
---
Yikes grammar
---
i havent gotten any on my P3 50 claudette for 7 levels, but i always get a firecracker... on my ghost face i have 24 and he is level 37... so ya
---
Meyers also can't be knocked out of his power.
---
They just need to fix the reveal
---
... What.
---
The funniest thing about his mask is that the original was a painted William shatner mask lol
---
 Bro I did this last night cept I hooked someone there, and kicked a couple gens and went up top to wait and a survivor walked up real slow and I exposed him and hit him assassins creed style. Was my only cool moment from last jight
---
If they don’t have Ruin, they probably have NOED. If they’re playing badly, they probably have NOED. If they’re playing a weaker killer, they probably have NOED.
---
Not delusion, projection.
---
Eh, dude was a total asshole, but saying that you hoped he'd lose makes it look like you meant to screw him over
---
And the doctor?
---
I really wish I could get a definitive answer. I have 20 cakes for Freddy.
---
Sure but losing all addons and offerings is tough, perks I get but damn
---
One time I got into a game with noobs, and after checking about three lockers and finding two people, I just wandered around checking lockers until I won
---
What an idiot
---
Wait so you bought more even though the first currency package didn’t show up?
---
Yea it is.
---
P4 Claudette
---
Nah, tunnelling only "helps" in low ranks too, its just camping with a few extra steps. 2 guys always on a generator while one does both saves and gens, plus d strike is still common. If you apply threat to everyone you can instead have one guy on thr hook while you find and chase another one, leaving only 1 survivor able to do gens since hooky needs a save and a heal. The gsme is all about making sure that 1 survivor on a gen is not doing middle gens, as those are hardest to do once the map shrinks from outer gens being done. Again, if you apply 0 pressure to gens its gonna be a fast game with low points, and no fun. Even killing 0 people playing how intended nets me about 18-22k points, and I actually get to use my brain on how I apply map pressure. Why would I brain dead chase the same guy over and over again if I get jack out of it.
---
This is obviously satire... right?
---
It's like the LEAST unoriginal Battle Royale. Pretty much every other BR is just brown army man game, FN has character and unique weapons/area/item/costume design whether you enjoy the game or not. The only thing "unoriginal" are some of the pop culture emotes, which people ask for.
---
They will stay
---
I'm on PS4 as well and the amount of perceived toxicity (I'm sure it's really there on PC) between killers and survivors is crazy.
---
And I have seen both sides do toxic shit on PS4. Survivors teabagging killers, killers face camping and tunneling etc. I don't think either side is better but there are more survivor players (I'd assume?) so it's easier for survivors to appear more toxic, also since killers don't have any teammates.
---
The core concept is still the same, it plays roughly the same. You'll be fine
---
Best community on twitch :)
---
As many as you need but remember they're pretty limited so use window loops when you can, and always go for pallet loop unless the pallet is too unsafe to risk.
---
well i hope all those people enjoy their ban
---
My god this is amazing.
---
i used to get so anxious before starting killer games that i’d throw up 
---
if you’re super competitive like me losing as killer is humiliating because you’re a solo person and not a team
---
don’t take every lobby!! if it’s a 4 man tool box game _especially with the wake up bug_ don’t take it!!
---
don’t play by a survivor honor code. i don’t camp but if i need to remove someone from the game if gens are getting done fast i do tunnel. to win in higher ranks is to play dirty sometimes and i’ve come to accept that _if_ i want to win, i have to play a certain way
---
this game has become a massive destresser for me, a complete 180 to how i was not even 6 months ago.
---
Search bar
---
What does it do?
---
&gt;Does BHVR actually ban people? Never ever heard of someone getting banned
---
I have heard and I have caused people to get banned after I reported them for a similar situation. Before EGC was introduced but not long ago, had a survivor just hiding at 4 gens because he was salty. I recorded, reported and he got a 7 days suspension. 
---
Don't listen to people saying report does nothing, people do get banned if they break the rules. 
---
[GAME RULES AND REPORT SYSTEM](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)
---
And yes, this would be considered griefing unless BHVR manages to find evidence that these guys were actually brand new to the game.
---
Thanks man you the real MVP.
---
You're welcome.
---
My friends from School are fans od ochido and in every game they are tbagging at every pallet or at the exit game, after the game in chat they type "ez", "Baby killer so ez to 360" I'm embarressed because of them
---
&gt;People get banned but only for exploiting the game. This isn't exploiting, this is just you not being able to find people.
---
This isn't exploiting but it would be considered griefing and therefore, bannable.
---
It was probably Borrowed Time then
---
Yay 🥰 I love a nice killer every once in awhile you are appreciated
---
Thanking you! Frinkiacs finest
---
If they had borrowed time, an orange bar would appear under the person's name who got hit
---
None of them had just been unhooked tho.
---
Dude imagine this in real life for school. The school bell rings and you have to get out of school before the timer and if you are too slow the teacher tells you to stop and give you an extra homework assignment.

Yeah, I'm excited to learn shocky boy.
---
Should I wait to switch and shock until I'm right behind them or just never shock?
---
I know that. That never showed up either.
---
You’d think with the bloodpoint weekend over the killer wait times would go back to normal, nope😪
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
My favorite part of endgame chat is telling killers that they're awesome and gg. So satisfying when they message back thanks or appreciate the positiveness. Gotta keep the wholeness alive cause the night is dark and full of terrors.
---
Excuse me Wraith and Trapper are underrated in this Smash list.
---
I have 57 perks unlocked as I never bought GF. Its roughly 50k a bloodweb at lvl 50. X 3 for each perk level, I get 8.5 million....but that doesnt take into account the fact that bloodwebs are cheaper from levels 1-40.
---
So yeah about 7 million sounds around that area.
---
Its not that bad unless like me, you have all killers. I’ve been spending bp in each based on when i play them. Naturally some have good perks, some have shit. Only 2 have all the perks.
---
Its what puts me off buying GF. Yet another killer I’d have to grind for. Rank him up to lvl 50 and probably be stuck using him with iron grasp, terrortorial imperative, play with your food and maybe Ruin if I’m lucky.
---
They really need to sort this grind out. It feels like I “cant afford” killers due to the BP grind. You’re worse off for buying all the killers which should never be the case.
---
If it was within 15 seconds of being unhooked, it was Borrowed Time. If not, it was a glitch.
---
Actual footage of Dwight running from The Legion while space and time shatters itself.
---
Yeah, I've spent too much money and time on the console to switch to PC too. I would love it if they did a cross platform profile system
---
Sometimes I will just kill you, though. :)
---
Teabagging, flashlight clicking, unsafe unhooks, bodyblocking/sandbagging, and then lobby salt.
---
yes...that's what I'm trying to do too
---
Bruh I play killer 90% of the time. 
---
Maybe swf are playing because they are friends?
---
I know it may seem foreign to you, but people like playing games with their friends. Maybe they’re not trying to ruin your day?
---
Playing with comms is a huge advantage, and that is true, but it’s certainly not insurmountable. 
---
Stop making excuses for why you’re losing
---
I mean, that isn't unique to Dead by Daylight. Repetition and familiarity. 
---
It's hard to keep that kind of atmosphere over time. 
---
The only thing that scares me anymore - and I mean jump scare - is prayer beads Spirit. I still appreciate and enjoy the gameplay loop even after thousands of hours between two platforms.
---
I've said the samething... everyone will be like why you camping I'll  post in chat and say it's because he sucks...all his minions get mad.. but I mean bruh your playstyle is that of a rank 20....  he always bitching in post chat yall shouldnt be afking gens you need to save.. you're proxy camping instead of gen patrolling... I like how hes always says I gave them free saves and they decided to push hard on gens so not I gotta camp this guy... "free saves" is when he doesnt camp lmao... his logic is asisnie.. but I watch him because his commentary is hilarious and when he gets his ass handed to him I love it.
---
Honestly I don't really mind that either its just when people start getting trolly or camping I get frustrated 😂
---
Thankyou. Can you also tell me why it takes forever to get a match as the killer?
---
I’m 100% sure it wasn’t BT
---
where's her clothes? this belongs on /r/dbdgonewild
---
I'm a killer main.
---
My dad makes pallets as a hobby, and I help him.
---
My dad always asks why I'm so mad when I make them.
---
I'll say it again, dbd survivors are some of the worst crybabies in gaming.
---
"Stop chasing me, that's not fair" is basically what that whole paragraph says.
---
Then as I say, must be a glitch
---
Yeah, or not even that. Elite Dangerous (another grind heavy game) lets you transfer your assets, one time, if you switch platforms. All you have to do is ask the devs. I'm sure it would be possible here on a technical level. I emailed them about it but they said no. I guess it would be too much of a pain in the ass (even though I would gladly re-purchase everything, the game, the DLC I own, and they'd profit from it).
---
Why is samination in this?
---
Ruining the others fun shouldnt be the reason not to tunnel, else youll get people thinking its survivors begging for killers to not use a dirty effective tactic, when tunneling is not effective either. I just posted the real competitive reasons not to tunnel bellow in this thread.
---
Shoutout to all the killers who let us escape when someone dc's/ragequits too y'all the real mvps

---
not right behind when you’re in chase unless you’re seriously wanting to raise more madness
---
it differs from doctor main to doctor main but i don’t shock in chases unless there’s a pallet or vault because that’ll raise the madness by default
---
also the slowdown and charge time will put you further behind them 
---
if you see them running _directly_ for a pallet quick switch to treatment, shock, then back to punishment and you’ll get the window of 2.5 seconds to hit because they’ll either stand at the pallet or run around
---
moldy, i’ve learned, is the best chase range addon
---
But can/will they actually get banned for it? If so, bye bye 1/2 of console survivors lol
---
Nothing better than a crouch battle between a urban evasion and a boosted add-on pig. Some really tense moments
---
I legit said this word for word after taking a yellow  plus Franklin’s and Mirror as Myers against a couple of flashlights Claudettes.
---
In the end the Claudette’s all escaped and Bill was Left Behind like always.
---
I did it but it brought me no pleasure.
---
r/bisexual
---
Freddy mains are a different breed. I tried to be one of you guys but couldn't handle it.
---
I help you guys out by always going full potato against Freddy though!  I'll sit at the generator saying "fail the skillcheck, fail the skillcheck" and then still instinctively hit it when it comes up
---
Honestly it just looks like a typical troll/meme steam name. I cant imagine getting mad at someone elses opinion over a celebrity. I like Keanu and seeing his name made me chuckle. The things people get butthurt about....
---
Ur = your
---
Ure = You're 
---
U just literally will type 1 more letter bro...
---
I understand they want to make the connection better but because how long the wait is for killer and how I live in a place with not many players the waits are horrible. As a killer main I've never played survivor as much as I have now with these wait times. Idk what's caused this but it's horrible.
---
Yea that was the point
---
As someone who has been maining Trapper lately, I'd like your opinion. Is it too much to run ruin AND noed? I don't want to run both crutch perks but higher level survivors will sometimes successfully gen rush before I can get good trap coverage, even with ruin on.
---
Doesn't even make sense.
---
&gt;waits 15 minutes for a lobby
---
&gt;gets into game
---
&gt;gen rushed
---
&gt;game over in 3 minutes
---
&gt;repeat
---
Go play Civilization
---
Marking?
---
yeah it’s like 15 meters even though it really doesn’t feel like it
---
i just don’t use the range addons anymore because they just don’t fit my playstyle so i use more affliction addons instead
---
i would go ahead and say to even try the shiny electrode but if you want to shock quickly that 50% debuff is really painful sometimes
---
abusing wakeup 🥺
---
If you say so
---
No problem man
---
*Laughs in friends only profile*
---
You gotta do whatcha gotta do man.
---
kinda
---
Normally, kinda toxic, in this case though? 
---
Not at all, two of them were running wake-up so I’d encourage slugging then mori’ing them at the last second
---
Oh I welcome the salt.
---
Oh for sure, it's been a long time since I played something on console if I have a choice to play it on PC instead. It's just here that I made the mistake. Sort of, I did have tons of fun playing with my console friends friends, but have since become mostly Killer. In sort of a cruel joke, framerates did improve recently on console... only for Survivors.
---
Forgot to mention, they only got 2 gens done
---
Ah, right.
---
I vaguely remember it being part of a parody commercial in a movie, now that you mention it...
---
Ok I just checked it's a joke but it wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't
---
LF can instadown too and he's garbage. Hag can be at several places at the same time, you have no idea where her traps are. She denies loops with a good web. If you crouch around for the whole match, good luck for your team. Not many people realise this but Hag is faster than crouching survivors, so she's gonna probably catch up to you if you're gonna crouch all the time.   
---
Myers is loopable. His instadowns, faster vault speed and further lunge makes him decent though. Smart survivors are not grouping up to deny his snowball potential.  
---
Trapper is just bad. With Wraith you have to change your playstyle to Hit &amp; Run and he becomes better. He's still not great though.  
---
Both kills and red ranks. I tried to think about their chase capability, map pressure, mindgames potential, hook pressure, slowing the game down potential.
---
Not sure if you could even be considered a killer in that case
---
500
---
Top shelf meme
---
BBQ, Nurse's, Ruin, and 1 flex perk that I can't really figure out lately. I don't think monitor is that good since it's only 8m less than normal compared to your 32m less during night shroud. If he was a 24m terror radius killer it would be awesome, but I prefer some other perks right now. Specifically I've been messing with Sloppy Butcher since it gives easier tracking on injured survivors and synergizes nicely with Nurse's Calling. I tried MYC for a couple games, but I don't like how it makes me feel like I just want to camp the hook from far enough away to proc it and then just run straight for the unhooker. I could do that without a perk by stalking them anyway. I've seen Tru3 run Haunted Grounds I think as something to help Ruin stay up, and that might be really good honestly but I haven't used it much. Dying Light is also fun for memes if you run a green mori with it. I don't have spirit fury tier 3 yet, so haven't tried it but I think he might need the help in chases.  
---
TL;DR: BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, Sloppy/Haunted seem like a good way to build him.
---
Thank you!
---
lmao your a idiot
---
Main reason why I have bond/empathy equiped. I really like to try to help people, especially since I keep my rank in the newbie zone.
---
Is it finally useful for more than chainsaws and Micheal "I'm going to spend at least 4 gens trying to get to rank 3 so I can mori you guys" Myers
---
Yeah I do that too. Punish the person doing the stupid thing.
---
From the her cosmetic's description: 
---
"A bloody pigs head with runlets of pus trickling from its eye holes and nostrils."
---
what's a metot?
---
Win or lose, messaging a stranger to talk about their gameplay just seems like you take the game way too seriously.
---
as soon as insta heals get gutted sure
---
My god that scared me lol
---
I can attest, we are a different breed. Most probably won't be surprised at how hard it can be to get a single yet alone 2k in a single match, but when you get those 4k moments either thanks to those like you or just those that are unfamiliar with us rare freddies and how to counter, you won't feel better after a 4k on another killer. Just came off 2 back-to-back 4k 
---
(second one with the first three all sacrificed at the same time because they decided to try and rescue their friend in the basement while all asleep. Not sure if they were new to Freddie or being kind potato survivors trying to give me the K.)
---
Freddie can be easy to counter and escape from (I've had one clever and lucky sun-of-a-gun hop on a gen mid-chase JUST to get and fail a skill check. Seconds before I tried to hit them. Had to give Kudos for the balls) But I don't play Freddie for the sacrifices. I can get none and still get ruthless killer level scores easily :)
---
Overload becoming a must perk on legion and plague? Yes please ma’am
---
Been waiting for these!! Thank you they look great ^_^
---
I always get atleast on private massage talking shit about how I’m a camper and a tunneler but I double piped and they kept being altruistic trying to get unhooks right after I hooked their swf
---
Ok makes sense. So why do I never see a red stain?
---
Preventing tunneling is pretty easy. a lot of people who play this game doesn't seem to realize its about being hidden not constantly being in the killers eyesight. if you arent spotted you cant be tunneled if you know how to loop like you say youd be able to break line of sight hide and go elsewhere. outside of rank 8ish and up its actually really really easy to do so id recommend working on evading killers when spotted and not being spotted.
---
Not lucky cause the second you grab one of the perks entity will grab the other.  And if you dont grab one fast enough itll take both.
---
Funny moment, I was being chased by a Hag and she was about to hit me, so I started instinctively bracing myself for a stutter. On console, you sort of develop like a whole new little skill, to be ready for it when the killer hits you and not become disoriented when the game freezes for a second. But the stutter never came on PC...
---
I was talking about the escape cakes
---
Yeah, it honestly comes off as a joke. But maybe I'm just an asshole that finds your suffering funny lol.
---
you exposed the milky way.
---
Ruin is pretty much a necessity on almost every killer at higher ranks. Enduring + Spirit Fury help killers without great chase potential (such as Trapper) throughout the match and helps you get more tempo, which can lead to more kills. NOED usually just gets you an extra kill at the end and doesn't give you nearly as many points or pressure throughout the match.
---
Don’t say that. 
---
Reddit wears reality-altering glasses when it comes to Legion. Just go along with it.
---
Oh wow. Thanks for that! Shame on my flair for not knowing this...
---
Haven't played him yet but when ive gone agaisnt him, trying to stop him from stalking while being chased is near impossible.
---
Unfountly i don't know what you can do to his stalk that makes it less powerful in chase but the same otherwise
---
God DAMN I love the internet. This is literally why I stopped by this post......
---
Classic monto
---
The entity has ruined my family and now we can’t afford food or cloths. We can’t run fast, we can’t heal one health state instantly. It’s awful
---
I played with someone like that, he complained every game expecting to win them all. I eventually stopped playing with him. I ended up finding 2 other people who were chill and loved to play the game.
---
If you haven't already, try posting in the [PerkByDaylight sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/)

Yeah I understand, these types of games are best enjoyed with friends (on survivor side). But yeah, it's rough, and your hands are tied. You can't change any settings, you can't upgrade your hardware, you can't overclock anything, you're fucked. And if PSN goes down, for which you pay money, you can't play any online game, for hours. Which happens often. But.. convenience, I guess?
---
How do you change icons? 
---
Is this all the status effect btw, or just these 6?
---

---
I dont have any problems with hits and connection on green ping and its not hard to get free ping where i live. Even with yellow its ok to play survivor. Killer on the other hand is shit if you dont have stable connection and even slight lag makes it bad.
---
No one who plays dbd says that, Get him!
---
Stop stressing over what the survivors will think. Stop stressing over how many kills you might get (after all, kills aren’t necessarily a win. based on the point gain, kills are only a part of 1 of the 4 categories). The more points you get, the better. Try to have fun with the game, try to do silly memes and dumb builds and see if you can work with it. One of the things I’m having fun with is tbagging as ghostface during a chase (you can still catch people and it’s very fun). It’s just a game and you’re doing fine.
---
We'll make it.
---
A large part of the problem with SWF is the general problem with matchmaking in this game. If the game had good matchmaking, you could just multiply the matchmaking rating of people in SWFs and end up with more fair matches.
---
I figured a Necromorpth much more terrifying and alien already has a game or 3
---
Adrenaline, Unbreakable, Decisive Strike.
---
I can recognize in game who's abusing wake up right now ;)
---
Surely you can get that person banned, you have clip.
---
Im sorry
---
Oh that is 100% the truth. Using bugged anything is the biggest asshole move.
---
Maybe you need to wake up \*da bum tss\*
---
truly beautiful
---
Because i saw the last tru3ta1ent's video where he had no chase music
---
BM on the killers part too tho for continuously hooking you rather than just goin for Claud instead :/
---
[PerkByDaylight](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/)  
---
Geistra's Sky Pack and Happy Clown's Colored Pack are two I can recommend.
---
Nah, ruin and NOED are kinda contradictory perks. I wouldn’t run it personally because the chances that survivors do the dull totems they find goes up.
---
Unless you plan on putting a trap around a single dull totem as well, its not worth it imo. If you plan on running NOED, take perks that’ll help you in/the build up to the endgame like brutal strength, blood warden and remember me. If you prefer using ruin, i’d suggest perks like thrill of the hunt and haunted ground to protect the totem, and stuff like sloppy butcher or thanatophobia (if you can’t find sloppy in your bloodweb) are good for both builds as they draw the game out and prevent people from doing stuff like gens and totems if they want to make less noise or be more secure from going down. 
---
Pair that with good trap placement and decision making under pressure and you’re all set.
---
I've never heard people complain about unbreakable. But can you tell me how to outplay adrenaline?
---
They were teaming, he farmed with them after
---
what is blood trailer
---
wish i had your frames on PC :(
---
that costed 3 dollars
---
It wasn't just spam, it was attempting to vote manipulate and brigade the sub.
---
No horror game ever stays scary.
---
I mean... Dreadhalls is a VR horror game I SOMETIMES put on my head to play and it gives me right proper spooks. But it's niche.
---
Honestly he needs a buff
---
Just use mouse wheel man 100x better
---
tru3 and HybridPanda
---
Yes and killers have been face camping, tunneling players they dont like and hitting survs on the hook since the game came out. I cant believe killers are acting like their side hasn't been trolling just as much as survs have been lol.
---
As much as I never play survivor, I took the time to configure a key macro to spam it for me. The "Spam X" style of mechanic is one that practically offends me.
---
Is that 3 dollars in 1978 or in 2019 I wonder
---
I already said I'm not trying to change your mind lmao
---
Surely there are other ways to make it a negative experience that people don't want to stay in, without insulting gamers with a braindead "Spam X" mechanic?
---
Leatherface needs a lot more content

I saw the same thing last night watching a overwatch streamer. He was struggling a bit with looping the killer and skillchecks. He did get some help by some of his viewers and they did some swf matches. The streamers name is urnotjustin if anyone is curious.
---
I've literally been called the n word for unbreakable lmao,(Not saying all killers are like that), but you got me on Adrenaline tho, I was just naming off "Clutch perks".
---
9-. I was speaking as if you are climbing the ranks so past made more sense in my brain than above.
---
shouldn't legion be in fail face catagory?
---
I had a game before when I messed up the ruin skill check by going for a great, I walked away while my teammate stayed so he got chased and down. I was the next one to be chased, and the next tile i went to loop the killer was where my teammate was trying to self-care, so he got downed again. I felt so bad that I made sure i unhooked him. After a bit of waiting, i unhooked him, then the pig uncrouches and tunnels him. I tried taking the hit for him to run, but at that point he just gave up. He messaged me telling me that im a shit teammate, I just said “I know i know, im sorry.”
---
hahahahahahaha
---
When he's in his power, Night Shroud, it suppresses his terror radius and red stain. You will be able to see it if he gets knocked out. It takes around 30 seconds for his power to recharge.
---
Whenever I play her I much more prefer survivors not-cleansing. It makes the game easier for me.
---
For anyone wondering this happened when the game glitched as the killer picked up my friend, his body disappeared for me until he was off the hook then he stayed like this for about 10 mins running, healing, doing gens etc. until the killer downed him and picked him up again. I haven't seen this before but god do I wanna see it again, havent laughed that hard in years.
---
I do love killers like that. And do the same usually if everyone else abandoned them or rage quit on me. I'm like you get to live for sticking it out
---
See, but you can. It'll cost a bit, but if you save up you can upgrade your rig. You can't on console :(
---
Last time I had a go at AutoHotkey, I couldn't quite get the right intervals for getting the Wiggle as well as a player can do it. Care to detail your config for that?
---
yes, it's satisfying just going around smacking items out of peoples hands, if you down one and spot someone with a flashlight just frenzy them real quick
---
You change the icons by going into your game files for the logos and copy pasting that code into it. You could get banned though so be careful. It’s only on pc
---
Ps4 nibbas: *anger*
---
You still gain stacks from losing your obsession and also from hitting them, but you get a token from downing the obsession because the game considers it as them getting away. 
---
This arguably makes Play With Your Food more manageable and useful on killers that lack map pressure since it increases their movement speed. 
---
So now all weaker killers got a significant buff, but the stronger killers either don't need it, or it doesn't help them as much.
---
You'll forget this was a thing, that kid won't.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Yes, but sometimes I double fail and I hit a great skillcheck instead. Gosh darn it.
---
Hail to the king, brothers
---
That killer was outplayed
---
Your name is literally Ghostface lmao. Don't think ur the best person to talk to on this no offense.
---
You couldnt if you tried lmao
---
Is there a subreddit for incredible crossovers? THhs needs to be there.
---
Ty! :D
---
So if ghostface is teabagging at the exit gate, it's not rude to teabag back right? I don't want to be a jerk, but I get a laugh every time.

Not big buffs lol small ones ..such as people who are downed and on hook shouldn’t break you out...or his ability taking 30 seconds to get back it takes forever...should be 20 seconds ...and he shouldn’t have a loud ass sound 8 meters around him telling everyone where he is
---
You honestly just have to accept the fact that you will lose games from time to time, and it's normal. I have just under 2k hours in this game mainly as killer and there are still times that I get completely destroyed when it's a good team.
---
I used to get stressed and frustrated, but over time it really fades. Heck, at this point when a survivor team outplays me, I'm just impressed and I usually compliment them at the end game.
---
Also if you know you're losing really hard and you're getting frustrated too much, just switch the mindset from winning to doing fun/creative strats and experiment. This is what I started doing and ultimately what led me from constantly tunneling people to realizing how beneficial it is to sometimes wound someone and intentionally let them get away to focus on someone else or even come back to the same survivor unexpectedly from a different angle.
---
Just don't set unreasonable goals for yourself and have fun :).
---
\-TRASH?
---
\-Well, yeah at the start is kinda trash but then later on... oh.
---
I got u
---
I had a Ghost Face game yesterday, and I brought an Ebony Mori. I mori'd the first guy, no DC, then another, still no DC, the third? No DC. Finally the last guy! No DC! I got all 4 and the Blood on Your Face Achievement :) best survivors ever and they were very sportsman like about losing:) that's the first and last time I'll ever see that :p
---
But why?
---
He is not getting nerfed.
---
They're changing the **bug** where he could pretty much put survivors on an infinite exposed state by stalking when the meter is just about to run out. 
---
It was an ** unintended bug** and they are removing it because it was an **unintended bug.**
---
Sorry autocorrect, I meant I get followed by my blood trail
---
78 but then again they were on a strict budget that took 25 days to film
---
Ugh I wish I had those types of survivors. They sound really  chill and nice. Well, we can only pray I guess.
---
I love you

This Is The Realm

Don't catch you rushin'up

NOED I'm whipping out
---
I used to do that then I changed that to wiggling instead and used the loose mouse down of Logitech 502 to struggle lol
---
There are no perks that defend their ego. Its all they have.
---
This is how I feel going up against spirits as a strong spirit main. I swear they all use ruin and noed and they always tunnel every hook.
---
My god I love your username
---
I agree with the other comments on here, any horror game would lose its effect over time. However Ghostface has kind of revitalized the fear factor for me. Not being able to tell which direction he is from you when you get marked is actually terrifying and I feel like I'm back in 2016 sitting on a gen scanning my camera back and forth waiting for premonition to ding.
---
The only wiggle you will do is at MY BED!

Dwight just wants to be a balloon.

CHEeeeeeeeetEEEERrrRRRrrR!1111!!!111!!!1!!

Good idea!
---
In door maps are great, matches are more intimidating on indoor maps
---
Oink is suppose
---
Because its true.
---
I'm not talking about **bugs** I'm talking about **people sayings he's OP and needs a Nerf**
---
I've tried this, but with spirit using play with your food. Her hand position look like she's in phase, but you're still in the regular plain.ots just the speed of the killers
---
All this forgets 1 major thing, Gen tapping pretty much negated Hex Ruin, and only adds minimal time to the generator as a trade off :/
---
THey are hooking up anyway.
---
Ba dum tss!
---
I guess it's gonna be Haddonfield. I hope they will rework The Temple of Purgation so that Plague gets a proper indoor map, not a shitty map completely not fitting into Red Forest...
---
But meg is a cutie
---
The way they've made them so far, indoor maps are very boring; most of them rely on RNG way too heavily, even for DbD, and they limit most killers' powers.
---
Miquel🤣
---
Now I want a Myers skin with a sombrero and stache, then replace his theme his increasingly annoying mariachi music.
---
Sure why not ¯l_(ツ)_l¯
---
I like where he is. I’m glad I need to use my eyes for other killer other than Myers. He is really fun.
---
I really don't think this is a proper fix to the issue. If the solution to a balance problem is to gen tap, then it's not the right solution in my opinion.
---
Nah. The Entity fears Shaggy.
---
Wratih: Damn it! \*Storms off\*
---
Its kinda bugged right now.
---
Tell him he's becoming toxic. Tell him to play killer and see how he feels having that abuse thrown at him. Or tell him to grow the fuck up.
---
I'm fine with strong perks as long as they have a counter or outplay. Like old decisive strike was bad, new one is ok I just don't like that someone could get unhooked and I find someone 50 seconds later and I pick them up and it just happened to be the person who was hooked before and then I get hit with D-strike. But you can wait it out if you know about it so forget about that one. Perks like NOED and dead hard may be strong but for the most part you can prevent/outplay them so I'm fine with that. It's perks like Adrenaline and pre nerfed MoM that I think are just wrong because you get rewarded with huge seconds chance just for doing getting hit of just finishing the last gen. Even spirit fury+enduring takes 2 perks slots, only works every 3rd pallet and it can be outplayed by just dropping the pallet early.
---
Why kick them at? They camped because they obviously knew they lost and need a kill. It's obvious when the other side plays better; you don't need to rub it in, you're just continuing the culture of toxicity.
---
I really like the 90s pack! Its on the perk dbd subreddit ^^
---
The weirdo asked the same thing on the F13 sub
---
**Okay**
---
Seeing as this thread seems to be mostly killers giving their stories; me and my friends who only play survivors at a pretty average level (10-15) are considering moving on from DbD, because 90% of matches we play the killer runs Ruin + BBQ Chili. Whether you think they're OP or not, it's still boring as hell and a poor game-play experience to deal with the same crap almost every single game (though them being run on such a high percentage of our games does tend to point to them being imbalanced). Does anyone have an opinion to share on this?
---
And because I feel it needs clarifying for some reason, we aren't toxic and have civil post-game chats, we don't even teabag because we aren't great, and we often fail to win matches that should've been easy ones which is fine because we're just a few mates playing for casual fun, because -multiplayer games-
---
For laughts?
---
Honestly this game ISN'T as sexualized as many other popular games or cartoons or even cosplays here on reddit, most of the post are not really "sexy fanart of X character" most of them are memes or small comics or regular fanart, this one in particular ain't exatly sexy or erotic either, they are jsut drawn very cute and clean.
---
I don't mean to sound rude or anything but everytime I see edits like this it reminds me of my mom's keyboard skin she uses for her phone lmao
---
i’ve had better killer wait times at 2 am than like 4 in the afternoon tbh
---
Think I'll get that aswell :D
---
Look since this isn’t your first asking. Sony and Microsoft wouldn’t allow it, and you can say you’re over 18 but I don’t believe you as you haven’t learned about internet porn yet. A bikini set wouldn’t be unlikely or anything but naked characters will not happened
---
Is ghost, has face. OP explain.
---
Reminds of Cotton Weary’s death when Ghostface stabs his foot and drags him down as he’s trying to escape.
---
Any chance you could make perks like these? I'd use them in a heartbeat.
---
Kill him is the only answer
---
Doctor and Myers are stronger than you give them credit for
---
Imagine from the killers perspective, load into a match and within 30 seconds one of your perks is gone for the match. Its a risk/reward thing, its balanced and has counter-play.
---
A killer loses if someone escapes.
---
*heavily salted*
---
All I want to see is 1 more gen added to the requirement to escape. Also make skill checks move counter clockwise too.
---
I've been using it and still getting the cool down, at least visually indicated.
---
They need to add stuff like this in the game. For free obv.
---
GF = DC
---
I’ll remember that next time I want to waste my time on a 3 disconnect game.
---
I thought people couldn’t get banned for it?
---
oh so blood hound. that makes sense blood hound is annoying to deal with. in terms of not getting caught id recommend working on walk to run ratio. a lot of people dont understand the power of crouching and walking away mid chase once line of sight is broken. a good example being when a killer chases you towards a jungle gym hitting the conrer fast crouching behind a box and running back the other way when he passes will very often help you escape if your able to get behind a rock then just crouch and walk away. too often do i see people sprinting everywhere even when they've broken los with the killer. in terms of blood hound outside of an insta heal its gonna take teamwork to evade the killer if hes right on you
---
"Oh my gosh you're breaking the tunnelling rule stop chasing meeee"
---
Me" *stands there* Wait...what the fuck
---
Se on mori!
---
I play soloand can't really go beyond rank 19 simply cause I lag a lot.
---
As someone who got rank 1 in previous updates when it was easy as shit but currently sits below the red ranks... I guess I got found out.
---
I used to think I was not garbage at this.
---
If someone camps or tunnels, then they get whatever's coming to them.  Personally, I don't camp or tunnel because I play both sides and I know how much it sucks.  And if my team wrecks a killer, I still gg.
---
I'm just saying from a personal standpoint, that it doesn't even matter.  If I play fair and I get destroyed as killer, then it's almost guaranteed I'm going to be teabagged and told how bad I am.  Like it's not enough to win, people have to go out of their way to dehumanize their opponent.
---
So it's a catch 22.  If you're gonna be a shitbag anyway, then you probably deserve the facecamp.  And if you're being a dick because they're face camping... It's an endless cycle.
---
I just follow the rule. You cant say a killer lost if all the gens are done when theres things like end game Freddy. I follow a personal goal of a pip meaning a win.
---
Fun to make a green only perks and add on killer to see if you can get a kill or two. 
---
Sloppy, enduring, spirit fury and bamboozle work fairly well if you can track on your own. Give it a shot! 
---
Also fun with survivor, but much easier.
---
yea they really should make use of Steam's workshop to make modding like this easier. Sadly I don't know how one could bring that to consoles. 
---
It'd also get much easier it they made backgrounds editable. this way we wouldn't have many problems that happen now when you change icons.
---
Those look good (but I'd want the green, yellow and brown add-ons to also have their colors)
---
Proper laughed at this, thank you &lt;3
---
You could slip an extra category in there for Huntress and Trapper called ‘Maskface not Ghostface’ ;P
---
shutup
---
Poor baby Dwight
---
The Game doesn't rely on RNG as much as Shelter Woods or Wreckers yard...
---
Myers may be better but Doctor is really useless...
---
A killer hasn't necessarily lost if the gens are completed - there are endgame builds that rely on this situation.
---
Obviously, it's going to be iffy if you put all your powers into the future, but hooks and kills count _whenever_ they occur. If you get them by assuming gens will be done, then folks are still hooked and dead.
---
Salt is meant to season the meat. Don't let it ruin your meal.
---
There was a post awhile ago that (based on the order of banner art and when BHVR usually release stuff) estimated that the pig stuff should be release around mid-late July
---
`oink`
---
Generally chill killers.  It just makes me feel good that my friends and a killer can just have a dance party without any malicious intent and then he escorts us to generators or we let him smack us around a few times before parting ways so we can all get some bloodpoints.  its just a super calming game compared to the usual seriousness of other matches.
---
He's not wrong tho
---
Fair point then. This girl is barely over 100 pounds.
---
Shut the fuck up loser
---
Fuck, that’s suppose to be stalking. I hate myself.
---
They leave because they expect to be trashtalked on top of having just had a bad game.
---
Let's not pretend they aren't right for doing so.
---
If you don't subscribe to that logic, you just want things to be easier for killers, period.
---
I don't get how someone can want to nerf what's essentially a free third hit for survivors but not want to fix a fucky, completely inconsistent reveal mechanic.
---
Dud there's no way you read all that in about 15 seconds
---
It can happen on PC too when you get hit by Anna with Toxins and all status effect perks, that will turn even the strongest PC into a toaster.
---
This is me except its most of my friends who play games (they got it on sale) and then me at rank 16.
---
Yeah because usually the salty killer bloops out of chat right away.
---
The fact that you have the Legionaires on the same tier as an experienced killer who can forge his own weaponry and traps is mindblowing to me.
---
Yo, put spoiler tag for this dbd mobile gameplay
---
I genuinely love these tier lists. Great community
---
Probably 10
---
I strongly disagree, pallet and vault denial, great tracking, which means early and late game pressure and great anti looper
---
You seem like sombody who thinks ochido should be unbranded
---
I've got a suggestion for Adrenaline. If the survivor is at full health, they get a speed boost. If they're down or injured then they heal 1 state. Not both.
---
No one cares if you found the next ochido. simple as that.
---
This was a neat idea for a video, but I feel it would have been better if each chainsaw sprint continued the song from where it left off, instead of having it reset every time.
---
Bro that's a good idea behaviour should hire you
---
Who's Ochido?
---
I go off my Sacrifice blood score, because letting people save and getting tons of hook events is a surefire way to flex my dominance as killer.
---
It's a crime
---
We offer Ebony and Ivory Moris at a low low cost!
---
Leatherface / Cannibal for his perk, Barbecue &amp; Chili.
---
Bubba for perks
---
Myers maybe but you have ghostface
---
Spirit is fun to play
---
Clown is okay
---
Oink is good
---
Freddy after rework sounds awesome
---
Oh yeah I love her, I’d say I’ve gotten decent so far. Not amazing but I can keep up at least!
---
Hey, if they wanted you to play with friends there would be a ‘Survive with friends’ option. Wait...
---
But is it really worth it being one hit the entire game? I felt like the games in which they use this counter are easier than the ones were they drink from the fountains
---
Thats actually not a bad idea at all
---
Just mash the button lmao
---
It's all about weight and if you can either fight him, outrun him, or hide. I would take my chances better than fighting someone like Freddy.
---
He got banned a while ago but he was the main cause for most of the toxisity survivor side. Also I think he might have been getting underage female fan nudes I'm not sure about that though
---
Its satire my dude
---
Not to mention I'm surprised legion is even that low a gang of people who love stabbing people would be hard to get away from haha
---
Yeah I’m doing it now. Sucks that I would lose the gateaus though, they are limited. Just harvesting BP, and trying out the different items I haven’t used yet
---
Yeah, but judging by the comments most people don't get it. It's a criticism of the post game insults survivors stereotypically throw at Killers. Here's the full article for context: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57149/dbd-killers-guide-to-survivor-rules
---
which platform do you play on?
---
I'm surprised bubba, legion and trapper are lowest
---
Hah... Ok
---
Have the devs addressed if it will get reverted?
---
I consider it as 1 single person, just like you face in the game, even if they are a "group killer"
---
You’re joking, right?
---
Thanks :)
---
that didnt answer my question
---
The hero killers deserve.
---
Buy licensed killers with real money, just wait for the rest
---
Knew it
---
Guess I better uninstall then. I only play this shit game with friends because friends make it fun. The randoms I get just sit in corners all game
---
&gt;I disagree. When a survivor teabags a killer after a pallet stun, sure they are doing a celebrate, or a mock. But in doing so they are wasting their own time.
---
So....I don't think you're disagreeing at all with me here?  You just agreed that it's mocking, which is basically what I said.  Mocking someone in game is toxic.  It's just adding insult to the injury of the survivor winning the chase against the killer.
---
&gt;It is the job of the survivor to relay this message. It is like you are offended when they run away?
---
No, and I never said that I was.  Dropping a pallet on a killer is not toxic, looping is not toxic, just playing the game to survive is obviously not toxic.  Going out of your way to taunt the killer is toxic.  That's my point.  And teabagging is taunting.  
---
&gt;Not really, but it can be used as such. Depends how good you are at the game, and how much you let it get to you.
---
I don't know how to respond because this makes no sense.
---
&gt;No it is the fucking killers job to chase you out of the match (if they can't kill you). By refusing to go to the exit gate you are essentially saying, I lost but I don't want to finish the game anymore. It is not intentionally making the killer feel bad. it is just celebrating and messing around at the only point of the game that they can feel truly safe.
---
This is some bullshit.  You are purposefully holding up the end of the game and forcing the killer to chase you out just so you can teabag in the killer's face.  You're not just "celebrating," you're taunting the killer.  You can celebrate without having to rub it in the killer's face.
---
It's like if the killer closed the hatch and now you (the survivor) are trying to open a door.  The killer finds you and instead of just downing you or letting you leave, the killer chases you away from the door and just bodyblocks the lever, forcing you to wait 2 minutes to die to the EGC.  That's not the killer "celebrating victory," that's the killer being a dick and wasting the survivor's time.
---
Same exact thing for survivors who wait at the exit to teabag at the killer.  Just leave, you won already.  Anything else you're doing in the match is just trying to make the killer feel bad about being unable to kill you.
---
&gt;People like to make games last once they are winning. It happens in all types of games. You need to not take it so personally. If they start chatting shit to you then they are being toxic. But otherwise, na, just except you lost. If you want them to stop teabagging then hit them out of the gate. It is quite simple.
---
I'm not saying it's the worst thing in the game or that BHVR needs to do something about these awful survivors teabagging, my stars!  You said teabagging wasn't toxic, you're wrong, and I'm explaining why you're wrong.
---
&gt;But it is a very natural thing to hang around waiting for friends, or making sure nobody gets hooked after you leave, making sure you are all safe.
---
You can do all that without teabagging the killer.
---
&gt;It is pure perception amplified by how upset you are at losing. Sorry if you can't cope with chasing survivors out of the map, or feel to bad and frustrated when you lose a game then it is on you. Do you think if you don't see them doing that then in your head they are not celebrating and you can pretend you did well in that game?
---
Again, you said teabagging isn't toxic, and I'm telling you it is.  I'm not saying any survivor who teabags should be banned or something, I'm just pointing out that it's toxic, shitty behavior.
---
Also, I just want to address a general theme running through your comment.  You keep making these snide comments implying that if the killer loses the game, they basically deserve to get teabagged.  Like, oh, if you want me to stop teabagging, you should have done better!  Don't lose next time 4head, just get gud.  
---
That's really the heart of toxicity right there, the attitude that as long as I'm winning I can be as shitty to you as I want and it's your job to stop me and if you can't, just deal with it!  Dude, try to realize there's another human being controlling the other character, and that person is just trying to play a game and have fun.  *You* might not think you're being toxic, but you're obviously aware that *other people* think what you're doing is toxic, and it wouldn't hurt your enjoyment of the game to have an ounce of consideration for those people.
---
Noted. I couldn’t sleep last night and my mind made a bargain with me that if I made this it would finally let me rest.
---
I’ve played on PC and it was just like my Xbox
---
Oh so this is if the killers worked as their in game counterparts not their lore makes a bit more sense
---
Thank you very much guys for nice words!   ❤️   ❤️ ❤️  I think it's obvious that Bing Bong boy is the winner, at least for me is the best cosmetic of this contest. I am just having fun drawing skins :)
---
I feel like the clown should be in C tier considering he's overweight and probably has 50 different health problems so he'd just die mid chase
---
Yup, if not Piggy would be an **S** since you can't scape from what's meant to kill you.
---
Hot take: you don't "win" or "lose" in this game. Any perceived win is just you projecting your own expectations onto the game. It sounds cheesy but this game more than any is just about having fun. Pipping and ranking up pretty much doesnt matter past rank 8
---
You finna go to everyone's posts being a dick?

yes i was asking that thank u

I don’t get ranks on Xbox. It seems the better the rank the shittier the players

I'm rank 8 about to be 7 is that good?
---
Being honest would mean stating not all survivors are toxic and you'll never know if you immediately kill the postgame chat.
---
But you can usually tell whether or not a particular group is toxic anyway by their actions during the match itself.
---
It's just a strange way of putting it, those words contradict each other

Okay cool yeah because that sounds like a weird glitch

Literally just happened to me. Guy teabagged entire game, I'm standing on the hill staring at him while he teabags, get to tier 3 drop down and down him. I face camped while his mom teabagging team mates escaped. I'm not usually petty and I never facecamp,  but for him I made an exemption.

Nah I like Ghostface better. Hes my favorite slasher. Plus it helps for the person who likes to teabag when your trying to stalk someone else whip around stalk them before they can reveal and boom dead
---
"How dare people get upset when people go out of their way to upset them"
---
If you can view tbagging as just crouching good on you, but theres plenty of people who recognize it for what it is, a taunt. And if you dont have the skills to outplay someone being a dick it becomes an incredibly frustrating and upsetting experience. 
---
Fact of the matter is, it's not "just crouching" it's a person going out of their way to say "you suck"
---
Correction, it'll bring the game engine to its knees.
---
With as long as lobbies are for killers right now, I can't believe so many of them STILL dodge when they see something they potentially don't like. I don't get that privilege but at least my lobbies are 2-4 minutes instead of 15-30 minutes. I was just playing with a buddy last night (2 man SWF) and half our matches were dodged. It wasn't like we were a 4 man claude squad with flashlights for fucks sake...
---
And you can ask people how to actually do it if it isnt haha
---
in 3 weeks
---
nice view
---
You teabagged so I would call that "what was coming to you"
---
The worst part is the game is locked at 60, which doesn't make sense because it's an unreal game, and deathgarden runs at 144.
---

How you doin'?

i play on low resolution -43
---
This is great advice imo, make fun builds, try and have fun (scaring survivors etc) &lt;3
---
I feel your pain brother
---
all those players abusing the legion cheese got a 24 hr ban. I would imagine the same will happen for the wake up abusers. Once we have dedicated  servers a lot of this shouldnt be so prevalent  as they can instant ban or should in theory be able to remove the perk from the play able pool
---
People don't like Keanu because of his acting chops, people like Keanu because he is one of the genuinely good people in this world (seriously, the more you learn about the guy, the more awesome you lean he actually is).  
---
That said, I have yet to see a movie he was in that I didn't enjoy
---
That makes sense. I always lean and stalk, I love playing GF because it turns killer role into a stealth game and makes you apply some strategy if you wanted to play that way. Very rewarding feeling marking and downing someone in my opinion using this playstyle. Jumpscares are also fun to get
---
Yeah usually, I like to message my killers or if there was a particular survivor in my match I liked and tell them GG. It's helped me meet some really cool people who I still play with and it makes the game less toxic overall. But you'll still get someone every now and again who just wants to sht on you
---

This +100 &lt;3

“Also if you know you're losing really hard and you're getting frustrated too much, just switch the mindset from winning to doing fun/creative strats and experiment. This is what I started doing and ultimately what led me from constantly tunneling people to realizing how beneficial it is to sometimes wound someone and intentionally let them get away to focus on someone else or even come back to the same survivor unexpectedly from a different angle.
---
Just don't set unreasonable goals for yourself and have fun :).”
---
hahaha, yes.

People from the pig subreddit:
---
I'm pretty sure this is how it worked on release too. They ended up changing it so you lost a stack when you downed them and then a bit later nerfed the movespeed.
---
LMAO yo this is great
---
That's what I mean I'll be attempting to jumpacare someone then some jackass behind me starts teabagging I get the notification so I immediately whip back around and get him and save my previous stalk for last

Yup.  I won't camp my hooks if you don't camp them too.  If I'm two steps away and you try to unhook someone you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Very very low chance, but the chance is there. That’s why I don’t do it, who knows I may get unlucky and get banned, fuck that lol.
---
If you fall asleep against Freddy, then you're basically a goner. 
---
The rest of the list seems pretty accurate.
---
I should've thought of that
---
you playing doctor, that is an anti-stealth killer...
---
It sucks a lot anyway so one extra time won't hurt.
---
It might be counting the amount of times that you chased them for 7 seconds
---
idk why you use ghostface for the meme if he can expose people and go for the guy who unhooked
---
Well that wasn’t very smart, I could never buy something again if I never received it the first time, do not buy any more until you get this resolved.

NOED= Cunt killer
---
Ds,flashlight,360ing= cunt survivor
---
He doesn't deny pallets agains people who know what they are doing. He can stop some annoying windows without bamboozle and that's all. His tracking is overrated...
---
The guy started a fight, was toxic, he deserve to get a better cool down and be scared to do something like that next time. Fucking idiota there might be someone who gets eaisly triggered and then he would fight with him for what? If he gets banned then goodbye and chillout for 1 month. Its like a murder "omg i killed ur Sister but im sorry i was just angry" oh ok i wont report it have a nice Day
---
People love to bitch about there being no counter play to NOED but you can just break the totems before you pop the last gen.  if you aren't confident enough to find them without help use Small Game or Detective's Hunch.
---
It's not that big of a deal.
---
I've found ranks 20-14 is the sweet spot for me. I don't have many toxic players and I don't have to stress about being shit.
---
Only buddies can message me.
---
Respectfully, I don’t think you’re playing him right
---
Also in case anyone asks, that last icon is from [this lovely artist's](https://twitter.com/AeroViro/status/1082388214026043393) content pack (the other files previews didn't update even though they're also overwritten)
---
I don’t see how making a comparison to another type of game could imply I take the game seriously.
---
Thanks, we all want to hear this sometimes, so this is really appreciated! But the toxicity and the lack of thrill that comes with grinding killers is just part of why they get twice the BP survivors get.
---
Remember guys, when you want to prestige a survivor, there are like 14 others exactly like it. You can equip the same perks and almost not notice the difference. But when you prestige a killer, there is no substitution. The killers you'll play while leveling your prestige back up to 50 don't play the same way. Games are tough, and everyone could use a bit more love, but everyone's grind is different, so there's almost no point to compare.
---
Only time you should ever unhook during a chase is if you have BT. Any other situation is just the action of an asshole
---
Nurse and Spirit
---
What it looks like is either they purposely deranked, or they just farmed bps and use them. Doesn't happen every game. Good luck in your next game.

I always tought frank's mixtape was toxicity 26 times.

Anyway, as a legion main this is awesome, thanks for this.

Killer queues are crap and should be fixed, I'm normally a survivor main. One day though, a buddy of mine wanted to play killer and I got to see how bad it is.  
---
\#respect4killers survivors can't have a game without them.
---
Plague is sexy, shut up!
---
0% resolution gang rise up
---
I’ve noticed that nurses, pigs, and clowns are the most likely killers to give that lonely survivor the hatch.
---
Bubbas never give the hatch
---
In terms of just their power and movement speed, Nurse and then Hill Billy, 
---
When you consider teachable perks though it gets more subjective.  Leather Face has the best teachable perks in the game, hands down.  BBQ and Chili cuts your grind time in half while giving you information with every hook and Franklin's demise shuts down survivors when 3 or 4 of them load in with flashlights, medkits, tool boxes, etc.  Knock out is pretty niche, but the fact that leather daddy has 1 god tier perk and 1 situationally god tier perk is unique to him.
---
I like how get gets called angry and toxic and is told people like him are why this game sucks when hes being lighthearted calling the guy baby and sis when the sender is literally just antagonizing the guy. if you look at the top you can see the dude sent a message before but didnt include it, guy didnt want reddit to know he started the conversation or messaged the dude first. which is instigating
---
Wig snatched
---
It's them shorting themselves in the foot. In case you didn't get it
---
In my personal experience, it takes a lot of skill to play doctor, with little payoff. He isnt a very good killer if the survivors know what they're doing. After spending about a month, I learned nurse, and quickly went up the ranks. Learning Nurse is probably your best bet in destroying people.
---
Then you have that one game where you cant find one totem for the life of you, just to find out that a random cleansed it at the beginning
---
Not always if the rumors of a rework are true.
---
I for example heard that he gets changes that allow him to see every Survivor once they are out of his tr regardless of them being in dream state and that he can place fake pallets in dream world.
---
Don't know if it is true or not tho
---
I love the toxicity I get. As a killer main I try to play fair but inevitably still get the "fuck u tunneller/camper/shitkid" messages. I never tunnel, but if someone is dumb enough to farm in front of me obviously I'm gonna down the unhooked person again. At the end of the day I'm trying to win. Earlier I had someone call me a camper despite getting a 32k game as GF which I thought was hilarious. I just end up saying gg and put a smiley face which always gets them even more riled up lol.
---
Np dude, I went through the same thing my first time with buying them :)
---
Torch=flashlight
---
Yeah, i really do agree.
---
I had a triple. Failed a check and let go, but got 2 back to back while I was still reeling from the first fail, and because I let go of the Gen I failed the other 2 immediately.
---
I think it's 8% every "tick", but I have done a whole Gen many times without a single check. Usually when running stakeout.
---
YES MORE, WE ARE THE 0%
---
You should probably avoid your father and large katanas
---
This type of you game, you just have to keep playing. Actual more 'hand-on' kinda deal.
---
Yeah the getting hit one is huuuge playing vs ghostface. You want to try and bait hits when he cant stalk to reset your progress and then run away. Best example I can think of this is taking a protection hit while he is carrying another survivor. Leaving yourself at 99% stalk is just a recipe for getting surprise insta-downed off a generator.
---
Also, it's pretty crucial to take him out of his power asap when hes chasing you even if you are already marked. Ghostface gets a lot of strong mindgames when he has his power up (ie, "did he leave me?", no red glow, surprise target switches if he is running nurses calling). On top of this, if he still has his power up, stalking you while you are marked refills the gauge without him having to re-stalk you for 4 seconds. This means he gets a much longer window to instadown you for. One thing to note is if Ghostface is running full decrease cooldown addons, even if you knock him out he can get his stalk back very quickly (like 15 seconds iirc) to finish off the mark.
---
He’s overpowered because he’s broken. Once they fix the field of view and time it takes to expose/reveal he’ll be fine.
---
I'm pretty good at doc but I'll try to learn how to blink well and play nurse. Leatherface is pretty trash so I guess that might add to why I performed badly
---
NO, you are a toy!
---
Impressive title op
---
Guess again
---
100 to 0 real quick
---
Lolol Salty Survivors down voting truth.
---
Honestly I feel like NOED is a trash crutch for killers banking on failing the match, but that doesn't mean there isn't counter play.  Just learn the totem spawns and break them.  
---
You get emblem progress for breaking dull totems since the last patch and you get some easy blood points to just hold down a button for a few seconds.
---
Spoilers!!!
---
Can you show me how to play him? I'm not being cynical or anything, I just haven't seen anyone who could make his power useful beside obvious spots where you can't loop Doctor (and good survivors should know this).
---
Meanwhile Adrenaline can be countered by...winning the game first? idk
---
As much as I’d hate to say it, this list is alright. 
---
(Although im kinda worried Hag isn’t with Freddy, you ok bro.?)
---
Do you play on console or PC?
---
"Quick disconnect!"
---
What do you mean you couldn't give him hatch because he wiggled off? Just dont pick him up then
---
Took me 3 games but yes, it did give me all of the points
---
Slugging is a great way to slow the game down if you know another survivor is close to you. Downing a survivor then chasing a survivor who is close to you effectively allows you to occupy 3 players time leaving only one in the best case scenario to work on a gen. 
---
There are perks to help with slugging such as Knock out or Infectious Freight that can allow you to build momentum. 
---
Freddy is the best killer to slug with due to his built in Deer Stalker and ability to track survivors from far distances. Knock out works amazingly well on him. 
---
Ruin helps alot. It discourages survivors from working together on gens while also preventing great skill check bonus progression. Its one of the most commonly used perks for killer but its risky top use due to it being a hex perk. Its available on the Hag as a lvl 35 teachable.
---
Discordance is amazing for finding survivors, especially in the early game. It also helps alot for slugging if you know where at least half the survivors are.
---
"Ah-ha-ha-aaa" it's true !

---
The problem I found going from PS4 to PC is the frame rate can make it really hard/sometimes impossible to hit a spinning survivor. I'll go through a six hour session on PC and get spun once, but on console its 2-4 times a game at least. I think I was still running unrelenting unironically when I was last playing on console because you were going to miss due to frame drops.
---
It's not a question about caring about rank, it's about actually getting to play the game.
---
Are you using slowdown perks?  Ruin is an obvious choice but Thanatophobia, Corrupt Intervention, even Dying Light can all help prevent gen rushing.  Depends on your killer and how you're playing.
---
The only time I've talked mad shit was when I came across a garbage spirit (who ragequit with 0 hooks lmao) while i was playing survivor, who after the match ended I recognized as someone who was part of an incredibly toxic swf group who spammed me with toxic messages after a round of me playing freddy with them.
---
Oh how the tables turned, funny thing is I got more hooks with freddy vs his swf and he got none vs a bunch of randoms. Felt really good to call him out.
---
So I am not sure if you know how PS4 messaging works but if you connect your social media accounts with your console it will show your actual name at the top of the chat. That's why I cropped it out.
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/L85GYUK](https://imgur.com/gallery/L85GYUK)
---
As for antagonizing them, I don't think I was. I think that's exactly what they were trying to do to me. I don't like to be called a bitch or a hoe, so yeah I told him I wished he hadn't survived the trial.
---
You beat adren by playing plague. Break them, and they can't heal up.
---
Messaging from randoms is blocked for me. Byeeeee.
---
Dang. That's kinda funky. Gg tho. You deserve that 105000 points if you were willing to do that.
---
why does he look like sideshow bob
---
Dude, it's tagged as Salt/Rant
---
It’s so rare that the one instance a killer used it he messaged us saying “GET LIGHTBORN’D”
---
I wish I made this up.
---
Wowee
---
I guess i havent really noticed these things so much. What you say must be valid because I just assume you may have spent more time on this game then i have.
---
The best is downing them while they are tbagging and they expected you to not have noed. The salt is unreal.
---
Plunderers is a really good perk, especially when low on items as you can get a lot of purple and pink things with it. Usually go in with a swf and a coin and give everyone a item
---
Noice.
---
I was read all the way until the end to realise I couldn't understand it
---
Haven't had those issues. Have been experiencing when I'm being chased I can't drop a pallet behind me when they are right up my ass. Happened on a few games.
---
I love that Huntress skin tho. I think I might get it.
---
Console
---
Bro, chucky couldn't even reach the hook lol He's too small to hook survivors, imagine him hooking Ace or David...
---
oink
---
Occupato
---
Jesus Christ, somebody take that kid out before he finds this game.
---
You'd be better off with franklin's over lightborn.  If you know some skeeve is waiting around the corner to blind you, fake the pick up.  Walk over the survivor in the dying state, stand still for a second, and then do a 180 and pop them.
---
Also Lightburn sucks for wraith but I have never seen someone actually lightburn a nurse in my 1k hours of playtime.
---
Yeah, that's because when they spin, your eyes are just not getting enough visual info to track them, it's a slide show and you're mostly guessing where they are. Plus the frame drops of course.
---
The green one doesn't actually have a timer, just the yellow one does. Blind warrior applies mangled till they fully heal just like sb.
---
Ahhh. That absolutely hasn't been my experience on PC. It's been a complete mess over here.
---
My experience with Bubbas has exclusively been "Chainsaw instant down, hook, stand there and stare at you until you die." Never fails. 
---
If I have more than one leaver in a game, I'll generally hook the remaining survivors twice for the points and let them finish gens and leave or bring them to the hatch if there's just one left.
---
The first bit sums up my ghostface gameplay. I'm mostly using his ability not even for the one-hit downs but so I can get closer to survivors. Then I'm usually spotted and the starts. 
---
On a side note the WASSSAAAAAPPP mask is owned by the mask company IIRC so it's possible we might get it as a cosmetic.
---
There should really be some incentives, but good job man. As someone who is around rank 8 let me tell you the joy doesn’t last.
---
Never seen her in game so idk
---
the mods here piss me off like the ones on the discord server
---
Can’t say about console because I play on PC, but they could also create another account and allow family sharing. I haven’t done it, but I know a few people that did and they don’t have to buy everything twice.
---
To be fair, is there any way you would have known?
---
If this is happening it's most likely add-ons or  the game screwed again. Im pretty sure the reason this keeps happening is because ether game right now is getting bug after bug and this is another one
---
two kills is a pip up if you play right on killer though? And that’s not to say you didn’t get one kill during match and one during exit gates either.

You're right, and it's definitely a case of damned if you do, damned if you don't.  It depends on the person.  Killers are often in the same situation with dcs... They get blasted as try-hard if they just try to close out the match quickly and move on to the next one without dcing, or people get pissy if they DC (as a blown 1 or 2 surv game probably means no real BP at the DC), or they sacrifice about 20 minutes for the Survivors to each get 10k and probably only get that much or less themselves (or reeeeeally drag it out to get up to 25k themselves).  Just a real crappy situation all around.  He was still a dick for pushing it instead of just accepting you didn't want to DC (reasonably) and putting you on a hook immediately.

“Thank you, father.”
---
Its 60 but i would recommend 70
---
*gets banned*
---
Not the younglings!
---
Agree 100%. But there should really be some sort of way for survivors to know how many totems are left. Don’t wanna be searching for the seventh totem for 5 minutes not realizing a teammate pooped a full one at the beginning of the game.
---
What? Every BR prior to Fortnite was just an army game with army guns. Fortnite is a cartoony BR with building, which is entirely unique to fortnite. No idea what you’re talking about dude
---
Muh babies are dead
---
Oh lmfao my bad
---
One of the best feelings you've had in this game is bm'ing a survivor to death while bodyblocking?  Yikes man...
---
I agree with Thanatophobia not doing much, but it can mess with people's heads. The psychological aspect of the perk can be just as strong as the actual effect. Of course, this doesn't work as well on more experienced players.
---
Rank and skill are not equivalents
---
They need to take a Shower.
---
Like a Jew.
---
F for Freddy, still lowest tier
---
No one is interested in your reason for using third-party voice boosts that give you easier matches, the effect is still the same. You're not an asshole for just trying to play a match with your friends or anything, but you *are* using crutches.
---
Me and my friends just use what we call the "touch and go" method. We start the repair and then let go over and over, this eliminates getting a skill check all together. This is a little slower but seems to be more effective than constantly getting set back.
---
I don't play Bill all the time..
---
But when I do, I show up in Monto's videos.
---
By their awful game play
---
Alright, I've got texture packs for perks, items, offerings, and now status effects. All I need is something for scoring effects and I can properly flex on console users
---
Very nice. Maybe you can help our friend up there who seems stuck with 60.
---
Nani
---
By the way he reacted, didn't seem like it.
---
??????
---
I don't agree with this, but some DC supporters make the argument that they don't want to waste time playing a match they're likely going to lose.
---
this is the content that i look for on this sub lmao
---
I can agree, hidden terror radius is just beautiful and the one-hit mechanic is more of a nice bonus to it, even though Spine chill and Premonition can still cause some problems for the killer if you're playing vs immersive survivors.
---
She tall af

Disabling would be ideal... But reading announcements is a simple, five second deal, and noone has anyone to blame but themselves if they just skip it, abuse a bug, and get banned. If we're real honest, 90% of people using wake up right now know that it's broken, especially when all your matches feature 4x copies of it when last month, you'd see it once every 150 matches (yes, numbers are made up to make a point).  I'd be inclined to give console a little more leeway on those numbers, since rando chat is non existent.
---
This is inaccurate in my experience. If you get a 4k its almost always dead silence, at least in part because half the players have already left the lobby. Games where everyone lives or only the last person dies have the most postgame chat.

Nah that’s all in good fun. It only gets bad when you start rapid clicking the flashlight lol

At least killers can do something about toxic survivors. Survivors cant do anything against a toxic killer.
---
There are four categories in the report form, Griefing/Trolling, Exploiting, Harassment, and Unsportsmanlike Conduct.
---
Under Unsportsmanlike conduct it specifically says No Reports needed for Disconnects and RageQuits, because they already have that information on their own backend. 
---
It's instead moreso for Intentional LagSwitching.

I guess you have never heard of a Draw.  2 Pips is generally a Safety which means a draw.  The flaw in your logic is you think the only possibility is win or loss
---
Thanks 😀
---
I know what he meant, but why try at that point? Just let him run and get it instead of downing him over and over again, because thats just annoying. Or hook em
---
MORILLE!
---
I just need one more pip and I'll be rank 8
---
I always took that as metaphorical; “He got hungry” could mean he literally got hungry, sure, but I like to think it was his hunger for death. His lust for killing had gotten the better of him and he’d gone and killed a dog to hold him over until he got to his actual prey. Just my interpretation.
---
Spirit

Billy

Huntress/Hag

Myers

The rest gets fuzzy and Ghostface is too new for me to give a good opinion on.
---
Don't take low rank friends into high rank games.
---
Yea and the fact that the hag and leather face are cannibals.
---
Damn, whenever I spot a baby survivor as killer, I either just slug them if they were caught in a bad spot (ran into a corner, etc) and go for the other three. I don't want to be seen along with the other killers that bully the first timers
---
And you get a shit ton of brutality points for downing marked survivors (for some reason)
---
I only seem to find Ghostfaces camping recently.
---
Or play the match normally instead of wasting your time being a tunnel boi for a sub optimal perk.  Dying Light hasn't been considered a viable perk just about ever.  I only see it on Myer's that are going for the adept achievement.
---
And D strike is not rare at all, what are you even talking about?
---
Rank 20 is white
---
I did hook the person eventually. I wasn’t going too wait  10 years for the dude too find hatch. I still feel bad for t though.
---
Idk why you get downvoted, marked stabs give you 500 brutality
---
LET THE VOICE OF LOVE  TAKE YOU HIGHERRRR
---
yesterday i hit rank 3 again, after a long time (when exhaustion didn´t exist). and now i can´t escape any matches, i won´t lose a pip but neither do i win one. tho the matches are getting more interesting.
---
Bonus points when the high rank yells at you because you obliterated him and his low rank friend
---
Don't bring low ranks to high rank games if you want to give your newbie friend a fair chance
---
You threw down a pallet when you didnt think the killer was nearby or chasing? Why?
---
not fun for the guy on hook
---
Jesus Christ. Looking through this comment thread has shown me one thing, and that is that this is the most toxic gaming sub Reddit. You got killers who say it's the survivors fault for being toxic and that "If you're toxic i'm going to be toxic" and just assuming every survivor is toxic. Then you have survivors saying it's "Just crouching" and to grow up. We all know it isn't crouching it's a taunt used by douche bags to annoy killers into DCing or to make their life worse. Now T bagging with the killer or with other survivors is fine. This whole "Us vs Them" Needs to stop before no one can have fun, and everyone is at each other throats. Can't we all just have fun and get along?
---
You uncultured- shit, i cant say it while the pig mains exist
---
Michael: "Here is your pudding, Laurie."
---
Laurie:"That's OK, Michael, I'm not hungry anymore."
---
Michael looks at the camera. Tier 3 music begins.
---
Thanks, I'll try a build like that. Chases have been a bit rough as survivors above 10 usually know the levels better than me. I just love Trapper so much, even if I went from a 3 kill average as Michael to a 1-2 kill average as Trapper. 
---
Any advice on SWF groups with him? With Michael I could just be unpredictable and also take advantage of their altruism to usually get a 2 kill. With Trapper they usually all escape because they all seem to know where my traps are and I have less way to take advantage of altruism without going full tunnel mode, which I prefer not to do.
---
It's a rotting pig head
---
Most Survivors use T-bagging to annoy killers which can be can be extremely frustrating if their gods at the game.
---
Imagine caring about rank in a game that doesn’t reward it. This isn’t a meme at all lmao
---
Oh definitely not buying anymore until then. It was really dumb and I shouldnt have tried again, but yeah. I was hopeful and it was a mistake. Hopefully I get this resolved soon
---
I'm joking dont worry I know how annoying legion is
---
The worst is when the person on the hook is a potato and makes no efforts to knock them out of shroud.
---
It was justified anyways op sandbagged him
---
Like Dead Space(the first one!) used to spook me when I first played and beat it. By the time I got to the hardest difficulty it didn't phase me. 
---
When you become familiar with nearly everything a game can provide, you tend to change with it.
---
Yeah, then they break all 5 totems and get 4ked with 4 gens left by a Billy using Spirit Fury/Enduring. 
---
Breaking dull totems is useless and does nothing when a killer doesnt use NOED. Its poor game design. the devs dont want to expand on their “secondary objective” that failed so thats why NOED is in the game.
---
Legion was a group of Canadian teenagers from the 1990’s. I cant talk for Frank but I know that every other member had tramway hygiene. Especially Susie,

---
Nah, i feel they should fix the bug and then properly buff it
---
You monster. He went away when you asked him to, and this is how you repay him? With a mouthful of pallet?
---
U were in the wrong here, u sandbagged him then tried to make him look bad when he rightfully complained about it. 
---
Then you posted it here looking for people to support you despite you being in the wrong
---
treat every game like a killer is running NOED?
---
Survivors be having lightsaber duels after this addition.
---
Yesterday I had a game with a very toxic 3 man, brought flashlights, instaheals, and wake up. They also had very similar names. The killer was a legion and brought in an ebony. They were all moried in the first 2 gens and then the killer let me escape through hatch because I was a good sport(also because I was not trying to play toxic).
---
I was gonna make a period joke but decided against it
---
Thanks, I'll try a build like that. Chases have been a bit rough as survivors above 10 usually know the levels better than me. I just love Trapper so much, even if I went from a 3 kill average as Michael to a 1-2 kill average as Trapper.

Is there any Reddit feature that would allow me to block posts that use the word "oink?"
---
? 
---
I was in chase when I threw down the pallet. What I didnt know was that my team mate was right next to me when I did. That's why they were upset.
---
At least they weren't all running Wake Up.
---
Teabagging the killer waives any rights you have as a player to be treated decently imo. I see no problem here.
---
Why bricks? Something more dark would be better
---
After 3 years the survivors will finally be getting back at the killer
---
I mean you right. But I also think that part of the wake up bug should be carried over (vault speed)
---
Yeah I do think ‘the scream’ is better as the ghost could be too similar to the spirit.

---
that works because "pig" and "clown" are regular words. "ghostface" is not a regular word, it's a descriptive name, therefore it doesn't need "the" in front of it.
---
And waste time in which you could finish 2 or 3 gens?
---
I'm sorry I'm fairly new to dbd. What is considered toxic gameplay wise? What I gathered from this sub is if you teabag a lot and post game chat. I tend to avoid those things.
---
I've been reported so many times for ridiculous things. One time I was playing Wraith and I got some Claudette stuck in a corner and then I uncloaked and hit her. Immediately afterwards I got invited to a party being told I was going to be reported and banned for bodyblocking by four people. It was a four man swf that all immediately gave up and either dc'd or let me kill them because they "didn't want to play against a cheater."
---
*D A R N*
---
I'm pretty sure torch still works
---
thats more a concentration camp than anything
---
&gt; Or play the match normally
---
Using perks as intended isn't playing normally?  TIL
---
The walls of certain maps are actually brick
---
Bruh that's literally the all community
---
This is the part where you get a streak of games with killers that camp and tunnel completely ruining the experience, happens every season to me
---
If one dc at the start, I just start a farm.
---
I’m bad so all my killer dailies take me more than one match..

The mask, the ghost or the face are the only three I can think of

Mess with the oink, you get the yoink

Good choices for perks but I'd swap MoM with Dark sense because getting the location of where the Ghostface is could help not get stalked or surprised and sure it may be for 5 seconds but it is guaranteed unlike MoM
---
Should’ve done it so the drums at the beginning are linked to the charge up, so if you’re tapping it it would reverse as the bar unfills and shit, that would’ve been amazing. Otherwise, hilarious
---
Would help a lot indeed, however trying to find all totems on a map like the swamp would still be a problem.
---
Yes it does. If you use the crouch movement speed add ons that stacks as well
---
Surely ‘The scream’? It is the name of the film and works well for him, like the ‘nightmare’ for Krueger
---
Noticed the mistype... FUCK
---
Nice, I was rank 8 then stopped playing for a couple months. Enjoying rank 18 while it lasts.
---
That applies to every perk
---
Then why don’t they use ‘the leatherface’ or ‘the jigsaw’ surely for consistency sake they should use a different name.
---
Musk is one of those people whenever you hear his name on the news, it's either something REALLY good, or REALLY bad.   
---
Two news stories I could easily see in the upcoming future: 
---
"Elon Musk has decided to invent a machine to cure cancer" 
---
"Elon Musk has decided to make fun of children for having cancer"
---
forgot, but also usless
---
Yea, but at least you would know what you’re looking for is there.
---
4 Bills on a boat? what is this, the Death Toll finale?
---
Maybe because I am killer main, but I can't really understand this. If you kept pestering me with protection hits, I would just finish you off first, and since you are already in injured state I would just M1, like I would do when playing legion.
---
While painful - it's a good learning opportunity. I started playing with high-rank friends against high-rank killers. I'd die almost immediately - but it was really valuable experience that greatly helped me when I later played on my own. The difference in playing against high and low-rank killers is genuinely palpable. I actually manage to survive now and then :P
---
Pallet looping isn't really toxic, but the rest of that is fair game.
---
It was added around clowns release I think or one before that. Didnt play in a while it was new for me too.
---
Having a strategy built around tunneling is playing normally?  I'm not sure if you're just doing troll bait here man, but the OP asked what's the best way to stop gen rushers, and you tell him to run dying light and just tunnel the obsession to death.
---
Tunneling is one of the most boring unfun way to play the round for both sides and as killer you'll net significantly less points for just chasing that injured person right off the hook.  Plus if they play intelligently after they figure out what you're up to they can waste a lot of your time for nothing with things like D strike or Borrowed Time.
---
A person who would not do gens and chase the killer and then get mad when his teammates didn't do gens. A witchhunter, where he basically just told his viewers to go and report people that had killed him. A manchild who used exploits to his own benefit and got mad when other people used them to go against him. Basically, a nusiance who needed to go
---
-Carry me?
---
-NO
---
yea you're right, pallet looping comes from experience, its just the fact it was mixed in with the other toxic stuff.
---
Jep it will help against a lot od frustration.
---
I mean I know where you’re coming from because I see this with a lot of ghostfaces, but I find that playing as him it’s completely pointless because if you go into your power they can just kick you out and then it’s just a regular situation
---
Nothing it is absolutely perfect with no issues
---
I've heard he is getting a name change to "The icon of halloween"
---

Hope you like this video I did months ago :D

Tbh I rank him as C tier, especially considering he’s getting nerfed in the future.
---
Billy, friend of the survivors blocking off the Entity
---
again, leatherface is a descriptive term, so is jigsaw. Those names clearly apply to only one character. If you just say "pig" or "clown", you could be referring to a player who tea bagged everyone the whole game. That's why it has to be "the pig" or "the clown" because it shows that you are talking about the killer.
---
For example, nobody calls Donald Trump "the Donald Trump", because his name is descriptive and only applies to him. However if his name was only Donald, we could refer to him as "the Donald" to make it more clear we are referring to the president and not some random person named Donald.
---
This happens to me like every game. I loop the killer for 3 gens, get saved loop them for 2 gens and them opening a gate and then get downed and no one go's for me even though the killer doesn't have noed
---
I came from console and it's one of those games where it is instantly easier. Especially as killer. But even as survivor, being able to zoom your camera around any direction just makes it so easy. It's not like coming from a console to PC with a shooter. Even after 3 months I would be 20 times better if I just plugged a controller in. Sad. Just can't get any accuracy with my wrist. Feels horrible still, but im resisting the urge to get that advantage, but honestly makes me not even want to play shooters anymore. Still trying.
---
His kit kind of leans towards camping to mark the saver. But it's not required, plus they lose points for doing so.
---
On console, having game of my life playing Myers and quickly, easily killed all 4 with 5 gens still to go. Thought I was just in the zone until I saw points screen and all 4 survivors were level 20 and only 1 had 1 perk. I just felt guilty and couldn't even bring myself to say gg for fear of just looking like an ass. Really hope didn't scare off some new blood.
---
The problem is they don't have the rights to the movie character, that is why the scream is out of the question.
---
Urnotjustin plays dbd? I though he played tf2/overwatch only though
---
Then again, I haven't watched him in maybe 2 years
---
What ??
---
Op if youre new sure. He starts dropping off at like 9-10
---
irl of course
---
Jason Voorhees is a very, very expensive concept to bring to DbD. Therefore, bringing him on board would be far too costly. It also wouldn't make sense considering he already has a game of his own, and would make people doubt whether or not they should purchase his character in DbD.
---
However, there's been some leaks about Pinhead being the next potential killer as well as the Demigorgon from Stranger Things, but those are not confirmed.
---
Its a legal Issue.
---
F13(the other game) is in a legal dispute with the License holders.
---
In theory behaviour could get the License, but the Chances are very small and its probably not even possible in the current Situation
---
I’m just saying the possibility is there and if anti cheat detects it that’s on you so go at your own risk
---
That is the only thing to do
---
ur imagination
---
Their power gives slow down, stall, tracking, chase, map molbity, map pressure, a free easy  hit.
---
It’s honestly better this way, otherwise it’s a baby killer getting wrecked by a high leveled team and the baby survivor isn’t learning much. If he wants to play with high level friends then the burden should be put on him not an unsuspecting killer.
---
Almost everyone thinks ghostface is fine or in some cases needs a small buff...I for one would like to not get my power taken away by hooked or downed people as it takes 30 seconds to get my power back
---
Could call him The Fishermen.
---
Bond (really useful to gain a lot of information like finding teammates to heal you or to heal them, working on a gen with them, to know if they are in a chase or not), Decesive Strike (you'll get tunneled and farmed a lot so i really suggest using this), usually an exhaustion perk (if you're not good at looping, then i don't suggest using Dead Hard, use Balanced Landing or Lithe instead) and the 4th perk can be whatever (Borrowed Time, Iron Will, We'll Make It, Adrenaline, Unbreakable etc.)
---
Id imagine gens. A system in which repeatedly pressing buttons adds progression, finishing 5 gens allows you to do this for the doors, and then a system to automatically reset this
---
I don't blame you. If they keep wiggling free and stumble across it they're more likely to think they are hot shit and just escaped, completely oblivious to the fact you were sparing them. Fuck that. I agree with you. Either they get carried there so it's made clear, or they die.
---
Mine was when I was 8, and it was the Dawn of the Dead reboot. Made me terrified of zombies xD
---
thats a whole different story :D
---
tbagging is really unsportsmanlike
---
The ruthless killer thing was stuck there from the previous match
---
I never saw Saw but I thought jigsaw was the name of the doll and the pig was one of his servants or whatever?
---
They disabled the moon offerings pretty easily. In the KYF group, you can still see they exist and I am pretty sure people who have them still have them in their inventory of offerings, but I would need to check. However, being slightly experienced in game programming can say that they would need a tiny patch that would simply need to say "hey this perk, don't let people click on it and change its image to lightly less opacity". In the stuff I code that could take literally 10min, however, being that this game is a lot more complicated and they have shown their coding isn't the most... uh... efficient I bet they could get that done in 3 days max. Getting it up onto the platforms could take a few more days so to disable the perk it might take max of 1 week.  
---
If they would need as much time as it takes them to create a new killer, map, and survivor just to be able to disable someone from using a perk. Well, now I know why the game is so screwy all the time.  
---
Either way, going by your explanation. Either you or BHVR knows nothing about coding.
---
I love this nice job
---
And?
---
his detection mechanic is still insanely unreliable, which will get fixed in the Patch
---
I mean you just picked out one part of what I said and made it the soul point of my argument but sure.
---
and im asking when his changes are coming?? idk where you’re going with this
---
Or they pop up 4 gens in 2 mins, you find someone, hit him, adrenaline activates then they open the gate and t-bag. Then you have to wait another 15 mins for a game...
---
So Jason is technically banned from DBD? If the other game didn't exist  he'd have been a cool killer although I'd rather the developers not get in serious shit if they added him.
---
This might sound dumb, but for the last couple of days I've been focusing more on gens than getting my team off the hook. Either nobody saves them or everyone rushes in, leaving no one to do a gen and spreading everyone out in the open. There's nothing I hate more than inproductivity.
---
Hey, I just wanted a reason to use bold text and didnt know how to add the Rest without making it bold
---
It’s not
---
Lightborn does not affect burns, only the rate that you are blinded.
---
Cant outplay Adrenaline unless you play Plague or Legion.
---
yep, noticed that as well. Its either all or no one
---
Only if you're between rank 20-15 or so.  He's not a very good killer at all.
---
Lol "super fast".. it's 15%... That's like .005 seconds faster it's not that noticable
---
With Freddy you should not be as worried about getting gen rushed as to have everyone asleep at the end. Try to kill at least one and have them asleep at the end and healthy, and use NOED.
---
For the others, using perks like RUIN give you usually some extra time, specially at low ranks. Pop goes the weasel is also a good tool.
---
Things like BBQ and Chilli also helps you with map pressure to ensure they are not working. Specially with billy.
---
Entity: *blocks window*.
---
Survivor: *vaults it anyway*
---
A lot of the times I'll bring in Franklins, especially at a higher rank. They love their items.
---
The rest didn't even have perks? But...but you start with a perk. Oh no.
---
Just toxic:
---
Flashlight flicking;
---
teabagging when possible (pallets, at the distance);
---
self-heal in front of them  (at pallets);
---
Make rushed actions to achieve killer's attention;
---
Waiting at the hatch/exit instead of living.
---
In some extent toxic can be (but still a viable tactic):
---
Hook bodyblock rush;
---
Sabo the hook when killer is carrying someone to it.
---
Thats from my head right now, there can be more  than that.
---
Went up against a rank 4 prayer beads spirit Sunday....they did not have ruin but the Kate on my team thought it was a brilliant idea to cleanse the totem. That was 1 quick fucking game let me tell you....
---
Hide in a locker or be within 40 meters of the killer when they make the hook.
---
Side note, people don't say this, but it is important to remember: BBQ reveals you for FOUR seconds. So hiding in a locker and getting out immediately, still reveals you for the remaining time.
---
If you want to effectively hide in lockers, you have to hide for 5 seconds because hiding for 4 seconds still reveals you for 1 second as you exit the locker.
---
-Me, a guy who plays killer and feels bad for survivors who use lockers ineffectively.
---
Always think to myself: Gens &gt; team mates
---
Need gens to escape, don't need mates that much to live.
---
Would they not even be allowed to add Chris Higgins on her own as a survivor or even Tommy Jarvis?
---
Burning a Wraith is incredibly easy-- before Wraith's big update, as long as you shined a light on him less than a second after he starts bing-bonging, he'd be burned. 
---
Now, if you need to start pointing it at him before he begins decloaking. Not really hard, but you're just vulnerable in a closed space.
---
Changes should be coming sometime soon. The reason they have taken so long to come is likely because BHVR is trying to fix all the bugs they introduced with the anniversary patch aswell as change GF. 
---
They might also be testing out other changes to GF.

hold up
---
Whut the fuck.........
---
LOl, I was just listening to that song at this moment.
---
Yes, it does. Downing the Obsession consumes 1 token and re-awards 1 token. If you have 3 tokens and can down the Obsession in 1 hit, you get to keep all 3 tokens.
---
 still need the License if they want to make those specific characters
---
If it happens then it means that he already had a fair amount of stalk on you.
---
Alright, thanks for the help. I really hope they don’t nerf him or fix the perk.
---
I agree quz i want to buy him and abuse the fuck out of his op’ness 😈 /s
---
The wake up perk applies the gate-opening buff to all things. Healing, vaulting, repairing, sabotage, etc.
---
*laughs in console*
---
I once got a ritual to chainsaw for 120 seconds with Billy. That's not a real ritual but I did it and got the award.
---
Yeah prior to the buff it was almost a coin flip if you could make it to a generator that was worth using it on, especially if you were a killer other than Billy, Nurse or Wraith with movement speed add ons.
---
After getting a 4k as Doctor I was spammed with party invites by SWF. They claimed I was face camping and tunneling when in reality, they kept trying to farm the de hook. All 4 of them managed to only pop 1 gen. How is that my fault? They screamed at me in party and then tried baiting me into being angry by calling me slurs and usual.
---
Best props to the young adult who was confused why I wasn't getting angry at him...Overall really funny and made me smile!
---
This is why I said "as an example". Use your brain please.
---
We out here!
---
Killers requires thick skin. If you get a SWF you've got no chance. It's 3-4 people bullying you.
---
I agree I otherwise call out toxic survivors and tell them to shut up.
---
It's nice when survivors do that. I had a huntress game where she was lvl 5 so only two perks and shitty ones at that. I braced for the flaming post game because I killed a survivor not soon after he got unhooked.
---
To my suprise that guy blamed the other survivor for being an idiot. I just sat in chat while they went at eachother. Felt nice for a change.
---
Yeah but who here actually enjoys Pig Trap RNG? Trapper used to have two add ons, one of which had a 50% chance to inflict dying state while the other had a 100% chance to inflict dying state; that was reworked into one giving 100% chance to inflict dying state when rescuing yourself and the other having a completely new effect as having something like injuries up to a 50% chance was deemed unhealthy. Not to mention the Old MYC was changed from potentially being injured after unhooking someone to becoming "Exposed" as injuring someone for doing a beneficial action was also deemed bad. With both of those in mind throwing in more RNG with Trapper traps is neither healthy or likely to be implemented considering the Dev's views on RNG.
---
My 0% and low settings dont look this bad tho
---
post game chat on console:
---
...
---
Bweehhhahahahaha *wheezes, coughs*
---
Nice way of using the original movie for the character ;)
---
We don't need another Nurse/Spirit .
---
Please don't tell people to run M&amp;A on a killer who can turn off their radius.
---
Nooo. Jigsaw is their persona- just like ghostface being his persona. Billy is the puppet and on the news they’re called the jigsaw killer, but ultimately are known as jigsaw. Which is why I questioned it. The pig is the make they use to capture their victims, and is what Amanda (the original jigsaws accomplice) used to get the victims. She later becomes the jigsaw identity as his prodigy. So basically jigsaw is the characters persona like the ghostface
---
I'll be honest I dont remember it being this bad during the game lmao
---
I had a game where this survivor would just appear at a gen when it was like 80%  and just miss 2 skill checks in a row. Then the killer would appear and chase.  The third time I noticed the killer avoided him so I was convinced the survivor was helping the killer.  After the game the killer messaged me saying the survivor was so bad at the game Instead of downing him he just chased him around untill he bought them to us.     I now try not to attribute malice when pure incompetence can explain it
---
this template works also

Oh ok, it may look better while actually running
---
It can happen, but 99 out of 100 times, burning a Nurse only hurts you since the fatigue is the quickest. However, pointing a flashlight on the Nurse *before* she starts charging will completely prevent her from blinking until you stop. This is especially effective from behind a pallet. 
---
Drop pallet, immediately shine light, Nurse spams M2 in confusion, you stop using the light, and suddenly she short-blinks.
---
He probably just smells like smoke after a trial
---
And thats how you insta lose games against killers worth their salt
---
I mean survivors still play even though its "one sided" even though I escape almost every game or die saving my teammates which is also a win for me
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Ahaha, all good. Pallet looping (as I've said) comes from experience knowing maps and is no way toxic. It's just a mixture of all the toxic stuff and that.
---
Gates, gens, hatch, hooks, pallets etc
---
That's crazy, I knew it was a thing you could do but I've never seen it in practice or seen a streamer do it either.
---
Or just wait for season reset
---
That sounds promising, if  only I knew how to do that
---
I try to use the baby as bait for his more experienced friends. If the plan works I always let the baby have the hatch though. If it's a Dwight, I might even farm with him awhile while his friends watch and have to wait.
---
Also doc, huntress and the plag
---
I'm still relatively new to DBD but I finally caught up to my more experienced friends in purple rank. Now I just need to work on my Killer ☺️
---
I used to swear by a Flashlight and Streetwise, lol. You learn some neat stuff when you play this game too much.
---
he's so cute, i can't
---
Isn’t the starting with perks thing fairly new?
---
We have been mixing in stairs and stuff, but I'm not the one building. My friend is while I try to work with the redstone, though I no little to nothing
---
Tbagging?
---
Sooo, he was a bitch. Got it 😂👍
---
Gotta show them pain for them to learn to live
---
My favorite part though is when you get survivor mains who say that, then turn around and say pre nerf MoM was ok. It literally rewarded you for failing with no counterplay on m1 killers
---
Honestly? As much as I adore the devs and parts of this game. Yes, parts.
---
A DbD killer will eventually happen.  Whether it be this game's community, the devs by doing DbD2, or just someone else making a game that does the formula better.  Some of the ones who have tried have come close, but someone will eventually nail it 100 percent. 
---
All it takes is that one horror fan with the passion and no how to go ''Well, obviously the first thing is we don't make the game about running around in circles." 
---
Cause at it's core, no matter how many horror slasher tropes it has or crossover killers from the genre that inspired it. DbD's gameplay isn't very authentic to the genre it's trying to replicate for the very basis of it's gameplay alone. 
---
''I remember that one killer chase between the killer where all they did was run in one giant circle around a piece of wood." said no horror fan ever.

Hey lets add new killer Ghostface.... And now wake and Legions add-ons are broken and affect everything whole game.
---
I told my friend that and now he can't stop laughing.
---
You said that if a perk is not as good as a meta perk, it is useless
---
&gt;It is (bad) when perks like [Meta perks] exist.
---
Well using Decisive strike can be a waste of a perk slot if the killer doesn't pick you up withing 60 seconds of an unhook. I never said Wake Up! is the strongest perk, but it does have a niche use. The 15% boost is only part of Wake Up!'s power. Telling other survivors that you're opening the gate is really good if you're not on voice chat. 
---
Comparing Wake up to No Mither/ Left behind, perks with no actual positive benefit, is the bad comparison. 
---
&gt;Freddy/Nurse comparison
---
&gt;Wake Up is not the Wraith of perks. It is the Freddy of perks.
---
&gt;If something isn't meta, than it's worthless
---
It's not. It's not the fault of the killer to take advantage of a bad survivor play. The fault is 100% at the greedy survivor rushing in too soon if I were gonna leave anyway.
---
I just had everyone DC within 3 minutes after my 10 minute queue. 
---
I play Wraith. People DC’d against a fucking Wraith. Nobody got hooked, and I didn’t do anything but play like a braindead AI. 
---
Playing Killer is basically a punishment now.
---
I don't enjoy long RNG but a short risk reward is always nice.. 
---
Arguments can be made for many other options, but for trapper to be good he needs injured survivors who are trapped to actually go into dying state... and he needs something to make disabling his traps a bit less easy.... cause rn good survivors will not allow a single trap on the field and hes just wasting time resetting them.
---
Wait what. Saboing the hook whilst the killer is carrying someone is toxic? Huh thought it was a legit start. Oh wel, good thing I read this sub then.

Rank 8
---
Perk bans would result in survivors banning Ruin in higher ranks, to make their already easy trials even easier. So unless gen speeds are addressed, this idea gets a "No" from me pal.
---
Mori me daddy is the same as Keanu sucks?
---
Yup, this was all my purple rank friends telling me dbd is fun and I should join them. All the while, I'm trying it figure who the hell Maury was where were these scratch marks I supposedly kept leaving were lol
---
Go play Civ 5. That’s a good game.
---
Lightweight is dopeee though 😭
---
In the "meme names to get you to chuckle the Mori in the lobby" names. Yes
---
The better ranked survivors, the more toxic in my experience.
---
That's not true, rank 1-3s usually aren't too toxic, not that i've met a ton. It's the middle of the pack that has got something to prove and want to feel big
---
Had a Ghost Face do that for me the other day xD
---
How did you even manage a game like that? I'm with purple killers at rank reset and I'm at 17.
---
It depends on how good you are with the chainsaw and I guess the map.  I'm not a huge fan of LF game play wise, it's like being trapper without the traps and a chainsaw that's only good for open areas.  It's similar in the chase to Billy but without the extreme mobility.
---
I have ~1300 hours in this game, but I say the things people don't want to hear so they say I'm a noob and blindly downvote on me.
---
Would still be a licence thing. Pamela Voorhees was created by Victor Miller alongside Jason &amp; there was/still is I think a copyright dispute between him &amp; Sean S. Cunningham. Somewhere down the line though, I don’t see Jason not joining DBD at some point if it all gets sorted.
---
Oh boo hoo a killer plays by tunneling or camping. Get over yourself. Suviviors play toxic and do the same things as well.
---
I think you nees command block knowledge for that
---
I mean, if you buy those perks, you won't have to deal with them again, So I would take the bad perks as it ups your chances of getting those good perks like BT and DS
---
funny enough the most toxic one (Green1983), after he tbagged etc i tbagged him until he died on one hook :D
---
Then Shirtless Myers Grabs them. The messages after the game are hilarious!
---
If the unhooker is closer to me sure i'll go for him, otherwise not.
---
This is a game. You're supposed to take advntage of bad plays. If not, every killer has to respect survivors making bad plays, while a killer can never make mistakes?
---
I think you meant Plague
---
Nerd Billy and Nurse... everyone else is fine.
---
I mean there isnt a single excuse to not use traps to block infinites, or hard to mind game pallets... BUT survivors know this is what he does and check those locations frequently...
---
Hell if I can get my killer shack traps to stay up for more than 60 seconds I would be so happy.
---
And trapper has a answer to looping but ONLY it situations where survivors didnt get a chance to disarm the trap... cause they 100% know it's there cause it's a loop trapper cant deal with soooo ya... very very situational... the only way I can nab 4 k with trapper at red ranks is if I run iridescent add on so the traps reset themselves after getting obliterated.
---
And having viability based on a single addon is not good.
---
thats not enough always.
---
I played him alot since PTB and release and its often completly random, even if survivors stand right infront of you.
---
Sweet sweet revenge. Nice!
---
Oh hell yeah
---
*Killer get closer*

You: **Oh fuck... Of fuck, of fuck ohfuckohfuckohfuckohfuckohfuckohfuck.**

Scooby doo moment-

---
Billy is fine, nerf instasaw add-ons.
---
Amazing!   
---
I actually just owned my own toxic swf.  One of them tbagged me and flashlight  spammed at a pallet for half a year , somehow I still hit him and hooked him. I 100% focused him for the rest of the game (I dont do that unless they're cunts), he was the first one to die and it all went downhill for them after that.   
---
Same results as you, incredibly satisfying :)  
---
 They'll think twice next time. Good job! :)
---
hahah it felt good! :D
---
Then I wish you good luck on your future adventures and have a good rest of your day! :D
---
Dude, stay on topic. If you down and hook the person who just got unhoked in front of you, that's tunneling. Like textbook tunneling. So unambiguously obviously tunneling it still kind of stuns me that anyone would say it isn't.
---
But you lose it when you hit someone tho, so even if they hit you once they will lose stacks and get slower
---
That’s not toxic but a legit strategy.
---
BHVR and EAC don't care or check for it. But in the event it DOES detect it and ban you, the devs said they won't help you.
---
If it were any other company I would be fine with it but knowing these dev's incompetence I wouldn't risk them fucking up god knows what on their spaghetti coded game and somehow triggering EAC's alarm. As if I'd risk losing all my progress on this grindy game.
---
I don't care how many people have been modifying their icons for months or years. My trust in BHVR was lost quite a while ago.
---
Any build designed around getting a Mettle of Man hit though is a total waste of time. It sounds to me like you will be hindering your team with this strategy.  Look at all the time you will be wasting, between following the killer around and healing in between, just to get one free hit only while injured. It just doesn’t make any sense...the perk is garbage now.
---
Sounds exactly like my game! although it was all 4 that decided to swarm me 100% of the time. And yeah I'm the type of killer that gives the last survivor the hatch, UNLESS the survivors are twits. Very satisfying!
---
Good job yourself! :d
---
Freddy should reverse controls of whatever car he hits with his special...
---
Guessing you don’t play killer very much lol, it’s very common, just not as common because you have to actually message them.
---
I think clown should have one category up on his own titled “has a knife”
---
*sees someone about to point out specifics* it’s a small blade in one hand, it’s a damn knife
---
you can also ask me for a link to the meme template if you like :)
---
yups
---
I enjoy this irony... XD
---
Honestly I wouldn't be opposed to Trapper possessing a weaker form of Iri Stone innately or even say having a disarmed trap rearm itself after some time. That allows for perceptive survivors to still be able to avoid danger while not completely negating Trapper's power. A survivor can disarm a trap when the killer is nearby allowing them to loop him for a time until it reactivates. A perceptive survivor can notice a trap and disarm it but it's reactivation could trap an unobservant survivor.
---
You too man! I wish for you to never get these games ahahha :d
---
I feel like losing all controls would make sense for 'falling asleep at the wheel' while a Doc Shock would fit more with reversing controls.
---
Plauge
---
God damn it I need that extra kill
---
Aren’t those skins already in the ghostface patch ? Or you just expecting feng and Dwight’s skins to be out first ?
---
Ah, of course, it's only a crutch perk if it's strong enough to make me cry
---
He just recently started playing it. He made a claim saying that it has some issues but not nearly as many as Overwatch.
---
PS4 has people sending messages to your personally. Tbh, I sometimes line getting them after a bad game where a few escape and get “gg ez” and I just be really patronising back like “I remember my first win” or something along those lines
---
welp, probably ur doing it wrong, and u will still suffer from that because the changes are only going to be 4%, so learn.
---
Fight fire with fire
---
Well... you can never know what awaits you at Rank 16...
---
Exactly plus I'm not just gonna let them grab them and escape that would be stupid haha
---
It’s not the addons that are broken, because the a Billy would still hold the saw at almost done during a back rev. The real problem is the monstrous hit box and how it reacts with pallets and vaults. As a billy main I confirm this.
---
Upvoooote. It's gotten so bad. Every game everyone is a different rank. Like rank 20, 10, 4, 6, 15. It's all over the place consistently every game. These arent even swf groups. Makes the game unplayable unless you play killer or with friends. Played for an hr or two, every game had a mix of low rank and high rank players. Awful.
---
As someone who plays killer most of the time (because I don't have friends to play with lol) I wouldn't say sabo-ing a hook while they're carrying someone to it is -toxic- necessarily. It's a VERY shitty thing to do that frustrates the player, but it's a legitimate way to secure a save for your ally.  In the same vein, It's the same thing as tunneling off-hook to secure a kill for yourself as the killer, it's not toxic, it's just shitty behavior/ poor sportsmanship. 
---
Ultimately you as a survivor will get more points from a hook save than a sabo, and as a killer you'll get more points by letting that survivor get saved and healed than re-hooking them immediately.  But sometimes shitty behavior is necessary when it's your ally's last hook or you need to eliminate a strong survivor asap to focus down the rest of the mechanically weaker survivors.  My advice, don't make it a habit but sometimes it bees like that. :P
---
OP was talking about the 3 escape cakes
---
It sucks and it isn’t worth the time whatsoever. It would arguably be worth trying sometimes if it gave instadown protection too, but keeping it to where it’s only usable when injured makes it pointless. Think of the time you’ll have to spend not only getting the stacks, but also healing in between.
---
He's really not you can get broken out pretty easily if you're not running the best detections addons.
---
eeeeexactly, i tbagged the Green1983 dude so much after i hooked him finally.
---
hahaha
---
As a wraith main I’m sad you didn’t include him
---
I mean it combos pretty well with David King’s WGLF, you get stacks for that on protection hits as well. I mean for a protection hit all you gotta do is get the killer to hit you while he’s carrying a survivor anyways. It’s pretty easy if you’re aggressively altruistic.
---
it's not too hard but it requires way too much effort and waste a lot of time trying to get stacks, especially when protection hits are buggy as hell. you'd be better off using another perk
---
Don't worry he's just invisible
---
fighting "toxic" with toxic... cool
---
Well Doc's power would be seeing shadow cars perhaps...
---
You'd see Doc pass you or swerve in front of you..
---
Good advice! Although I was trying it out recently and it got me hooked a couple of times. I think I'd just rather completely slug the whole hook rather than wait to get chased by the killer when he gets the chance to lol.
---
Sad stuff my guy only posted stuff like pig = upvote
---
MODS can be crazy sometimes
---
I feel like clown should be higher his power can be used really well but I guess if you don’t know how to use it he is just an M1 killler
---
I mori every Quentin I find, or dodge if I don't have one.
---
I see both pretty frequently. Spirit is probably in the top 4 or 5 i play against. I see the doctor less often, but probably as much as the Pig or the gross cursed swamp lady whose name i forget.
---
It's just based on the behavior of a lot of people playing ghost face, not his kit. Most people do not play optimally ;-)
---
And that's problematic aswell. But the issue I'm stateing is that more than half the Ghostface games ive had has been filled with non-stop toxicity.
---
Camping a survivor every hook, tbagging them as you do it, watching the final survivor bleed to near death just to hook them and continue tbagging is just toxic. No matter how you look at it, it's toxic. And most ghostfaces I've seen do just that. 
---
That's the problem, a killer that has just came out is being ruined because toxic shitheads want to get some revenge by punishing random survivors.
---
You can say that survivors do the same shit, and yea some do. And they are assholes no doubt about that. Toxicity in general is dickish but I'm just stating Ghostface has become a magnet for the toxic killers. Just as claudette is the magnet for toxic survivors.
---
I'd still be happy if I was the one that lasted the longest, even if it's for the thrills...
---
&gt;!I don't own the game, please don't kill me...!&lt;
---
Well you really weren't joking when you said a wall of text
---
So you do try hard build and add ons for a perk that someone might not even have?  I’ve been playing a lot these few days and like no one I saw was running wake up lol. 
---
I mean, do whatever you want to win. But using a perk isn’t “toxic” they just think they’ll be able to get out faster. And that’s not even the case.
---
You have to remember rank reset is a thing too. I'm usually purple/red rank. But I haven't played in a while, so currently crawling back out of yellow with killer and survivor
---
you're debating that flashlight swarming, tbagging and shit like that isn't toxic?
---
This is better than what the devs are doing, these are really nice ideas.  Good work!
---
Thank You mate!
---
You cant, welcome to playing killer in dbd.
---
Never see either.  Unless its bloodhunt then the doctor comes out. Its always Myers when I do survivor.
---
Depends on the Killer. Maybe there was a DC or someone suicided and they felt sorry for them. Maybe they destroyed the team and felt sorry for them. Maybe they just liked that particular survivor.
---
Crouched Claudette next to the tree
---
Oh damn that actually sounds cool, a good way to re-immerse ourselves in the horror side of the game. :D
---
Devs said they will NEVER do jeepers creepers because of who the license belongs to and they don't want him to get any money.
---
That’s what that is?!
---
Thank you brethren
---
*wheezes in excitement*
---
I've been away from DbD due to toxicity for a while, what new bug is this?
---
Upon turning my brightness up I actually have no fucking idea what that is and it’s freakin me out
---
That could work! These are just general concepts/rough ideas. Lots of room to play with the ideas. Illusions of doctor card would be good. I kinda used that for Hag because hag traps dont port well to racing game (why teleport backwards and being in last and teleporting to second if person in first triggers is kinda bs..especially if they put it right before finish line) so I threw out the illusion car if triggered. My hag idea isn't strong at all and I fully expect someone to have a better one haha. 
---
Doctor can work on all those levels if we add in the power ups (case files and the shock distance  increaser can obviously port easily)
---
I will be the god clown fuck your pallets and killer shack
---
:O
---
I really need more info to see your point. 
---
Freddy's Ability(roughly speaking): Survivors in dream world are 50% slower, transition takes 7 seconds without add ons. Freddy cannot hit characters that are not inside of the dream world. Survivors can exit it by failing a skill check.
---
So basically, Freddy needs to wait 7 seconds just to be able to hit the survivor, and it seems like he slows them down for 50%, but really all they have to do is start working on something and in a short time they'll get a skill check that they can fail. I want Freddy to be good but with the current power it is just a nuisance.
---
LF Power: Insta down, can hit multiple people, can increase movement speed with add ons, allows to break pallets fast. 
---
I am not saying he's a great character, it's true that he isn't. But Freddy's power is really more of a nuisance to himself than the survivors, while Bubba's has some potentual.
---
You can keep leveling the Bloodweb past 50. You can either prestige or recycle the level 50 bloodweb over and over for new stuff.
---
That's the mentality I used to carry about it. I might as well do it to them because they will do it to me. Really it just makes more toxic people. They see that behaviour when they first join and get into toxic matches and they carry that toxicity over to other matches and players next thing you know you are being toxic to people who didnt have that same intent.
---
Pig
---
Having your tendons slashed is gonna hurt quite a bit. Plus you can hit em across the face if he's standing on something.
---
It's an interesting concept I had awhile ago. I was surprised at how easily it fit once I started typing. I was like "oh this person would obviously do this..this would do this.." most fit pretty easily. 
---
Hag did not. Haha.
---
The thing is, you don’t even know if a killer has the perk. The second thing is, even if you do cleanse all 5 you still was over a minute worth of time and time is everything for a killer.
---
This always happens with a new killer, not much you can do about it. Sorry
---
What.. Does that have to do with anything
---
Yeah; like I said, it’s just the broken hit box
---
Nope, when people wanted Pennywise they added Clown. That's it
---
Tunnelling is going for one specific person and ignoring anyone else that tries to distract you or get in the way. 
---
If the killer went for the unhooked survivor even if the unhooker is considerably closer, then that’s tunnelling, and either way, if you’re dumb enough to unhook while the killer is still in the vicinity then the survivors as a whole deserve to be punished for that bad play

The killers objective is to sacrifice, and going for someone who is unhooked is not wrong unless you are doing it when there are better plays available, like a Claudette running directing across you as a distraction, and you hitting her instead. If you ignore Claudette, THAT’S tunnelling, but the point is that there’s nothing wrong with the killer going for them because that’s the game, that person will be killed faster and cripple the survivors ability to escape faster
---
There’s arguments for going for both players really. If you go for the unhooked, they die faster, and the survivors will lose a person sooner. If you go for the unhooker, you make them die faster and also waste time of the survivors who must now find and heal whoever got unhooked
---
Tunnelling isn’t “going for the unhooked survivor” 
---
Tunnelling doesn’t even have to have anything to do with being hooked, there could be a toxic Claudette that’s been teabagging you the whole game and you purposely go for her to kill her for being toxic, that’s tunnelling. It’s a broad term for going for a specific character when better plays are available
---
I mean it would be cool..
---
I dont see how it could improve match searching but it would give you a much smoother FPS count
---
Myers would be called drafting
---
That's the word! I was like "it isn't drifting but it's close.."
---
DBD is a game of momentum. The only way to prevent gens getting done is to pull the survivors off of them. Hook one guy, he's not doing gens. You start chasing a second guy, he's off gens. A third guy has to leave for the hook save.  
---
Some perks can slow down progress directly, as others have mentioned here. Others can help you gain or keep momentum. A common combo on Billy is Spirit Fury + Enduring. This lets you get downs faster through pallet looping, and gain momentum.
---
i thought maybe ... quick loading time for smaller texture details .. no ? ok
---
Personally I love the Pig. Ghost face looks fun too but I’ve never played him.
---
The traps aren’t really meant to get you free kills. They’re to slow the game down. It forces survivors “to play a game”, so to speak. Will they help their friends by going for hook saves and staying on generators, or will they go for the bear trap key and essentially take a Survivor out of the game?
---
Odd I think
---
I mean how would an ancient evil force suddenly be taken by the entity
---
I see what you mean, but i dont think it does
---
Wake Up grants a 15% bonus to EVERYTHING instead of just the exit gates
---
Thanks Doc !
---
Is it before the gates are powered as well?
---
I thought the banners had the pig first and feng last tho guess we will see .
---
Ingame
---
Tried leaving through an exit gate, couldn't, just was standing where it should give me the end game screen and it didn't. I first went in when I was in the injured state, and couldn't leave, then had killer put me in downed state, also couldn't do anything. I had problems wiggling and using self care during this time and before I went into the gate as well.
---
Agreed, what made this game particuarly worse is that the said killer used two add ons that make him harder to spot and it literally got to the point where I was watching him for a solid minute and I couldn't spot him even though he was in the center of my screen for the entirety of it. Which also makes it stupid because you can be watching him during a chase and even though you're in the process of spotting him, he marks you anyway even though that's the exact thing you're trying to prevent him from doing
---
So I'm supposed to go for the fully healed unhooked instead of the already injured hook, possibly letting both get away? Why should the killer be punished when the survivors do bad plays?
---
This was me. A survivor kept going round in circles. I could never get him so i just stood there &amp; let him go 😂
---
That's some great insight there. You are adding a meaningless topic to something that has 0 relevance. That's really the point. We know they are broke. Just because its ruining your game doesnt mean everyone else is having a bad time.
---
And let us not forget the tbag, if that tickles your fancy c:
---
The chainsaw bois don’t even have ultra rare add-ons so be thankful for that
---
Would honestly be too perfect. The dude is based of an urban legend called "The Hook." Maybe he could be alerted if a survivor went near his hooks... but not until next summer.
---
The traps aren't there to actually kill people, you should never expect to kill someone with them ( it can happen, but it's very rare ), the traps are there to slow down the game, to force survivors to do something else besides generators. When you will reach red ranks, you will see how much traps can help you, because at red ranks, people tend to repair all generators in 3-4 minutes, especially if you don't have Ruin and especially if you play a weaker killer. With Pig, you might get away even without Ruin, because her traps can stall the game.
---
Legion is really fun to play if you can use them right, they have an amazing backstory in my opinion and I like their general ability and design. In my opinion probably the most realistic killer in the game. All surfaces legion is my top favorite, so i know I'm being biased but you should get legion. You'll feel satisfied when you vault a pallet to get a stab off a survivor.
---
Casual mode is going to be hell then. The way this game works, it wouldn't be a good idea
---
The top half in order
---
* Nurse is in a league of her own
---
* Hillbilly - Hag; Great killers, but not Nurse
---
* Spirit - Huntress - Myers - Ghostface - Freddy; This lot is close, depending on situation one can shine, but if played correctly, they all are similar in tier, and are solid.
---
Inb4 I get shit on because Spirit isn't top three even though I believe she is the closest to becoming "Great but not Nurse" between all of the "solid killers" IE 4th.
---
No that’s not what I’m saying. I agree with you. I actually use wake up but have taken it out since the bug, so I’m not a toxic asshole.   I’m talking more on the killer side; being toxic in case someone else is??
---
When sloppy was bugged, every wraith used it and it completely screwed the FPS for survivors. It was actual torture. I literally used to just want to be hooked and dead because of how annoying it was. 
---
So people using wake up, another perk that hasn’t been addressed now it’s the end of the world?
---
**SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS**
---
It means that the chance of rarer items and perks appearing in your bloodweb will increase (slightly)
---
That's when you close the hatch and open both the gates
---
I know right how dare that killer leave to play another match
---
I don't have a PS4 however I could help with the logic and such and make examples for anything that would need to be done. If you're interested in my help you can shoot me a pm or leave a discord tag below.
---
Well first comment was a joke. After that you type that bullshit how its not happening in your game so its not happening at all. And im pretty sure most players dont enjoy going against bugged add-ons and give unfair advantage.
---
Ah okay I was just wondering cause im rank 10 and usually the survivors I face just cleanse making things worse for them
---
Facecamping? Where is LF?
---
Amber?
---
If you want to stop the exploiters, you need to scare them.
---
So go full Prayer Beads Mother Daughter Ring gen build Spirit with Ebony Mori.
---
and they say ***KILLER*** is OP
---
Ikr, keys need a change. What if a killer power was, when you find the hatch; even if it's closed. The remaining survivors just get sacrificed right away a-la ETC
---
I thought people might notice the name but I never imagined this much attention to it lmao
---
I mean if you want to, knock yourself out. I don't know why you are trying to bring "should" into a conversation about what is.
---
Downing and hooking the person who got unhooked right in front of you is tunneling. Whether you should do it or not can be debated, but isn't relevant to the question of if it's tunneling or not.
---
You just get them to look cool, it's really just to support the devs to keep at the game and making it better and giving them money for some licenses as well. Buying cosmetics directly supports and improves the game in the grand scheme of things. Plus it makes you look cool so why not?
---
Same
---
Then dont play until the update. Its technology. It's going to bug when you constantly add content to it.  You act like if we have a bug for more than 5 minutes it should be fixed instantly. That's not how it works. People are still enjoying the game and they are tired of seeing that shit. Use some common sense.
---
No /s. Because he’s speaking the truth
---
I'm a 50/50 main and have been for a long time. I know what I'm talking about...
---
It legitimately used less at Red Ranks because Red Rank killers are better and don't need the crutch. Check the stats.
---
anti ghostface build that doesnt include object of obssession? smh
---
Yeah can't really blame him tho. The reason I kept playing this game was because it was fun. That's the most important part. Your friend need to be having fun to be motivated to learn to play better.
---
You dont play this game for too long do you? This game had bugs going on for months. And yes would like to see bugs that grant huge unfair advantage in multiplayer game fixed fast.
---
The Pig her beath smells like Pig shit...
---
No you can't. One the timer starts killers can't open gates.
---
Because he has counter play. And some people even say about him that he isn't that good against good survivors. 
---
Not every killer needs to be a Clown you can loop and gen rush without even trying IMO.
---
I mean I play for bp and to have fun, so as long as I get my 4 BBQ stacks and have some fun they can all leave idc. Don't know what to tell ya bud.
---
I literally just dont look around when I'm struggling. You can press the button and still end up dead. It's a pretty bad experience.
---
Oh yeah. Seeing Ghostface's new perks. You're telling no one though, "wow, this perks are lame I would never use them".
---
dare I woooosh
---
I guess this is a little bit of a brag, but I'm typically not the first person to get sacrificed. When it does happen (and the killer isn't being toxic) I wish I could just type gg and have them see it when they finish. Like seriously it's refreshing to lose in a fun game, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to finish.
---
15% increased movement speed increase like OP said isn't game breaking? is your head broken?
---
Some people don't realize how pitiful the speed values actually are. 115% means that when a survivor runs 10 steps, the killer runs 11.5 steps. Being 15% faster results in basically nothing. Moving 110% speed is worth 11 steps for a survivor's 10.
---
Most chases begin with survivors at about 30 meters away from the killer, due to terror radius and being spotted out. If a survivor runs at 4 meters/second and the killer runs at 4.6 meters/seconds (115%), it would take 50 seconds to catch the survivor if they run in a straight line without obstacles, bloodlust, or exhaustion perks being used.
---
It takes one survivor 80 seconds to do a generator.
---
Two survivors take 44 seconds to do a generator.
---
Three survivors take 33 seconds to do a generator.
---
Four survivors take about 27 seconds to do a generator but that doesn't matter if that fourth survivor is being chased.
---
With bllodlust kicking in every 15 seconds without hitting/breaking chase or pallets, a killer goes up 5% at each tier of bloodlust for a maximum of an extra 15% with all 3 tiers of bloodlust.
---
If a survivor uses any sprint based perk, excluding Adrenaline, they run at 150% speed for 3 seconds. This changes their 4 meters/second to 6 meters/second.
---
So, lets say the survivor doesn't use windows/pallets but does use sprint burst, and the killer has bloodlust, and the chase starts with 30 meters between them.
---
The chase would start with the survivor sprinting for 3 seconds and the killer chasing at normal speed. The 30 meters bewteen them would extend to 34.8 meters between them due to the sprint advantage.
---
12 seconds later, bloodlust kicks in to give the killer 120% speed instead of 115%. They now move 5.4 meters/second for the survivor's 4 meters/second.  *But*, the killer was still chasing without it for 12 seconds. The killer ran at normal 115% speed for those 12 seconds. Those 12 seconds shrank the 34.8 meters of distance to 27.6 meters of distance.
---
With the bloodlust tier 1, the killer would run for 15 seconds at 120% speed and the survivor would maintain their 100% speed. After 15 seconds of chase, the 27.6 meter distance would shrink to  6.6 meters between them.
---
After 15 seconds of bloodlust fueled chase, the killer gains bloodlust tier 2, increasing to 125% speed. This bumps their 5.4 meters/second to a whopping 6.2 meters/second. After 1 second of bloodlust tier 2, the distance of 6.6 would be reduced to 0.4 meters of distance and the killer would lunge to score one successful attack. After 31 seconds, *without* windows or pallets, the killer has hit the survivor one time. 
---
The survivor, fueld by the sharp stinging agony of the blade, sprints for 1 second while the killer speed is reduced to their original 115% and then halved. The survivor moves at 6 meters/second while the killer moves at 2.4 meters/second. After 1 second, the distance of 0.4 meters is increased to 4 meters. 
---
The survivor, having come down from their pain-induced high, moves at their normal 4 meters/second. The killer, still absorbed in their successful strategy strike, continues at their crawl of 2.4 meters/second. After 1 second, the distance of 4 meters is increased to 5.6 meters. 
---
Having gotten over the fact that they've just hit someone, the killer decides that they want to do it again. They recover their 115% speed and resume chasing the survivor who has somehow, while the killer was distracted, put some distance between them and the killer. After 9 seconds, the distance of 5.6 meters reduced to 0.2 meters. The killer swings, the survivor goes down, and the chase is over. 
---
All told, the chase took 42 seconds to get a healthy survivor into the dying state without pallets or windows. The survivor did get sprint burst and the killer did get bloodlust. 
---
If you are still here, and recall from the beginning, 1 person takes 80 seconds to complete a generator while 2 people take 44 seconds, and 3 people take 33 seconds. 
---
If all 3 of the other survivors worked on different gens, they'd be halfway done with 3 generators. 
---
If 2 survivors worked on 1 gen together, they'd be done. The 3rd survivor would be halfway done with 1 more generator. 
---
If all 3 other survivors works on 1 generator, they'd be done and be a third of the way through another generator. 
---
This is done without pallets, windows, or Ruin being calculated into the equation. That said, a single chase takes too long for a killer to have enough time to get that 2K plus 2 escape that BHVR expects of the game. 
---
Bear in mind, this is in no way an accurate representation of how chases go at all ranks or at any particular rank. This shows how a survivor running in a straight line, albeit with Sprint Burst, would still take 42 seconds to down. It also shows in relation to that time, how much generator progress could be achieved in such a short span of time.
---
Because with high tier killers you don’t have the time to take them out
---
This is the best thing i have seen all day. The kids swing is even down! 😂
---
This is happening more and more lately
---
There is definite toxicity, and I've only been playing this game for a few months but I notice it is also very helpful, welcoming, and fun. This sub also unveils a lot of toxic crap while simultaneously posting funny stuff and has overrall good vibes when on the right side of things. You definitely have a learning curve as both killer and/or survivor, and different ranks can take advantage of it, but you just have to remember to have fun and brush it off because its bound to happen in any community, as much as it sucks to say :)
---
Hands down the worst community I’ve ever seen. If you play on steam make your profile private or you’ll get salty comments on everything, get ready to change your steam name every few weeks too so salty killers mad that you evaded them for ages dont try to get the other survivors to hunt you down and camp you.
---
Also have a screen recording program ready for when you play solo and the swf squad farms you “for fun” or when you get people using exploits.
---
I have recieved more hate messages from this game than anyother game i have played. That being said, its a fucking blast surviving with friends or solo. I recommend this first as it will give you a better idea of how to hunt them later as the killer. Easily worth every penny.
---
You prob gonna meet nice people on the first ranks 20 - 15 on the highranks 5 - 1 most people are toxic tryharder at least 50 % at the end of the day the community is pretty simiular to every game. Many toxic people on the top complainin bout each other unfair/weak/useless playstyle.
---
Anyways i still love the game. You dont have to listen to toxic comments just jump on to the next game and continue
---
wholesome
---
If you play survivor nothing to worry about.
---
If you play killer just dodge the chat after the game ends.
---
Enjoy the game its pretty fun !
---
A real potato indeed
---
If you aren’t looking to be active in forums, you’ll be fine. And if you disable post-game chat, you’ll be fine. The best thing you can do is maybe play with friends so you guys can have a laugh about stuff! But the game is super fun and don’t worry too much about toxicity—I’ve been playing for about six months and I’m just too happy-go-lucky to let anything get to me.
---
I’m so glad you’re getting into DBD! If you’re over 18 and would like to play with someone on PC, feel free to send me a message :)
---
I agree but only if we get Bikini clown first
---
You lose a stack even if you miss too.
---
You can now stomp the hatch closed and trigger end game collapse. The player will have to leave or die by the Entity's hand within a small window of time. 
---
People can be irritating but there are still good matches and good players, don't let the bad apples spoil a good time.
---
I'm surprised this is so rare for you guys to see.  I do it fairly commonly in my killer games.  I gave last survivor hatch earlier today in fact.  Was playing Legion in a fun aggressive game.  Finally got to last 2 survivors, downed the one and heard the other who instahealed earlier on a gen.  Decided to slug so I could  make sure the instahealer wasn't the recipient of my hatch generosity.
---
I rarely hide in a locker
---
Well, explain to me how you pip by only killing 1-2 people? Truly intrigued.
---
Honing stone, and it only goes downs you if you remove yourself from the trap
---
Yeah... not an particularly rare or interesting story, I know.  I'm just surprised at how shitty this game's player-base can be, still!  I won't tunnel or camp unless the swine deserves it.
---
You will get shit on because you compare Spirit with Freddy, Imao.
---
And Spirit &gt; Hag. Hag's power is countered by SWF teams and she is a set up killer ... in a game that can end in 4 minutes.
---
Either that, or they're SWF abusing how matchmaking works, with higher-ranked players taking lower-ranked buddies (even some with smurf accounts to do exactly this) and get lower-ranked killers.
---
The survivor just seemed she was better than you and you are throwing a tantrum
---
i hate this system because i was doing adept ghostface and in 2 matches i ended up with not enough chaser because i exposed people and ended chases too quickly
---
The playerbase is for sure big enough only killer lobbys are fck up atm but this will be fixed sooner or later
---
Nahh, it’s just easier to put all the toxicity on survivor mains. 
---
I’ve literally seen so few toxic survivors. I very rarely see teabagging and whenever my friends do it I tell them they deserved to get caught or should have got caught. Not to mention teabagging didn’t “ruin” the game for the killer. Maybe hurt their feelings for whatever odd reason. 
---
Killers camping and tunneling can ruin the game. The survivor has the misfortune of being found first, almost guaranteed to be taken out of the game within the next minute or two due to tunneling. 
---
Obviously do your objectives(kill/survive), but you don’t have to be an ass about it.
---
Lol stupid fucking reddit downvote mobs
---
the ability is t-bagging
---
Lol the ghost face from a distance killed me 😂😂😂
---
Oh is this the part where someone makes a joke about the number 69 that takes a moment to notice?
---
I think when a New Player is beggining to play its better for him to play alone. Then when he knows how things are working, what to do in certain situations he can play with higher ranks (friends)
---
I truly believe Pig is better than Ghost Face, especially considered the incoming nerfs for GF.
---
The first survivor just seemed like she was better than you and you get pissy
---
It's just good sportsmanship, not to say sacrificing them all is bad sportsmanship, but if this one survivor didn't stand a chance and the killer takes pity, they'll give them a free escape. It's just friendly and we're all just trying to have a good time playing, can't very well do that if you loose.
---
This is good
---
And what assumption was that? It sounds like another killer was just choosing to be an asshole and sadly OP allowed him to upset him enough to make him respond to it.
---
What would you like the survivors to do ? In order to survive ?
---
Not sure if you're aware of this change or not but if you find the hatch first you can close it and force them to use an exit gate within the next 3 minutes or they instantly die. Should never be taking 10 minutes to get that last person. Also gonna mention that infinite pallet loops are nowhere near as bad as they once were, so if you played the game before, I dont see how it could be any worse in that regard specifically. Killer isnt gonna die soon unless they leave Wake Up broken, queue times for killer wouldnt be so long if there werent a bunch of people trying to play it
---
By stopping gens for 9 mins, ending chases quickly and using your powers, you can get a pip with very little effort
---
That's why he camped you lol there's a lot of trash killers like that.
---
If they get a dc at the beginning of the game, I'll let them farm and won't kill them.  
---
In a normal game, I don't really take the last survivor to the hatch anymore unless he's a Bill and played well (and wasn't toxic) and I'm not being sweaty. Sometimes I'll let David get the hatch too.
---
Ah! Ok, that's new (ish) I guess? And yeah, I have had great matches in the past with this game.    Just stunned by getting 100% toxicity in literally my first game in over a year.
---
&gt;Spine Chill
---
&gt;Urban Evasion
---
0% resolution, 0% brain
---
 no! YOUR breath-taking!
---
I don’t mind survivors playing immersive but boy do I hate the Claudettes who hide in bushes.
---
Most of the others dont stealth much, so when they do its ok but all the claudette players do is pick the hardest character to see and hide all game.
---
PC player here who also plays on PS4. It's not about "convenience". It's about where your friends are. I play survivor on PS4 since that's what most of my real life friends are, and I play killer on PC. PC is way better, I play at 120, but some of the shit you're saying is pretty damn dramatic.
---
Dark sense is good though
---
Can’t disagree. Seems he’s going to be one of those killers.
---
He has to be that tall so you can climb him like a tree.
---
I mean Werewolves and Vampires are sort of close and where living humans. That treatment is not too far of the Hags own story.
---
Agree.
---
Sloppy exploit Wraith lol.  I remember that gamebreaking bullshit.   Jesus that shit was cancer.
---
Well yeah, trash is warm and comforting.

---
Well deserved salt in this case. OMG killers are so funny, “he probably just laughed.” Yep, let me ruin someone else’s gaming experience and then laugh at them for being rightly annoyed, but as soon as a big bad survivor teabags me, oh no the toxicity.
---
You prolong the game. If you kill everyone in the first 2 minutes you don't deserve a pip cause you didn't do anything. Playing as wraith, personally, I have good chase, 2 hook everyone, kick gens/pallets etc. It's not a hard concept. People conotate winning with killing everyone, and while that's fine, you might not pip that way if you do it too quickly.
---
I constantly see the same things that usually screw me over like bugs and sandbagging teammates, and nearly every time it’s a scenario where if that survivor hadn’t have been screwed over, I NEVER would have caught them.
---
BED TOWN
---
Maybe. That seems like an excessive amount of time tho
---
I can't see how someone would compare these 2 different things.
---
MoM was a very overpowered perk that got re-worked (nerfed).
---
Now they are 'fixing' something about ghostface (nerf) and it's on par? 
---
Like eye for an eye or something? I don't get it and I don't see it as something which is connected to MoM.
---
Lol sooo... Is anyone gonna tell this person that looping isn't toxic and not bad xD. 
---
Looping is a way that keeps survivors alive, what would u expect them to do? Run in a straight line? Waste all the pallets so their team has no chance when they get chased? SMH. Honestly if u CANT CATCH SOMEONE then don't chase that person, give up and go find someone else rather than camping them for something that's your own fault. 
---
I understand the shit talking survivors/killers, that crap needs to stop but seriously pal, looping is in no way toxic, as for the person who wouldn't leave u coulda just closed the hatch lol. Countdown woulda started and they woulda died if they couldn't escape. Again, not entirely ur fault since u prolly didn't know and yes survivors shouldn't be idiotic like that.
---
This child reminds me of me, watching horror movies at age 4. But i need to ask... where did he get that knife? That’s not a normal knife you see at a restaurant
---
Yes, but lets be real, everyone uses them as like and dislike buttons, stop being dumb and trying so hard.
---
So same as Billy and nurse?
---
And on that note fuck cold wind totem spots
---
I can stop a pallet looper, no problem, especially with Mikey, hence this one getting hooked.  It's the irritation of it though.  It's the DBD equivalent of the kid screaming gibberish into his mic on CoD.  Adds nothing to the match other than annoyance.
---
Bot bad
---
Nope I’m a killer main and the only killer mains that are a disgrace to us are the people who say they are killer mains to push their narrative of CAMPING BAD!!
---
This shit is really annoying, Like i understand that abusing wake up is a massive issue and all, but for every 1 person i run into using Wake up i run into 10 killers using sloppy and thana. Its way worse on the killers side IMO. 
---
I dont understand how people think this is a good idea, bc i legit tried to convince a claud who was using wake up to stop and she said she wouldn't bc the constant nurses and billys she is getting. You legit are causing the problem
---
Cussing out killers is how low rank survivors cope
---
Not gonna lie, I would totally do this if I were in the realm.
---
Was it on PC? Might have been me.
---
I’m the homer part of the community
---
Oops
---
It's really not that hard to troll 4 people at once when they all say the most predictable things.
---
I‘ a very good redstone ingeneer (or whatever I‘m german), but play on PC
---
"Survivors did nothing wrong"
---
Yeah I had a game a couple of days ago against some very clearly new players. When I had clearly gotten a 4k, I allowed the last survivor to unhook everyone else and for everyone to heal fully while I waited in a corner.
---
Figured it might be good for everyone to kind of get another chance at figuring out how to outplay a certain killer
---
OMG same
---
Wraiths are not normal to see, sure, but that doesn't take away how easy it is to burn a Wraith.
---
yeah they need to fix this shit. so many killers with decent connection in lobby and it just spikes during the game.
---
I've never seen the hellraiser movies but wouldn't adding him be hard because he mainly uses chains I heard?
---
dang it, i was gonna make the same joke
---
noed is a crutch perk for killers. everyone needs crutch perks.
---
I just got ghostface and played my first game. I got a 3 man kill, would have gotten four had I found the hatch before the last survivor did.
---
How the fuck is self-healing in front of the killer toxic.
---
Same with sabo'ing the hook LOL.
---
I think you don't have any idea what toxicity means.
---
luck doesnt affect chests, its been proven and said many times
---
Oh noooo you got downed during a vault! A normal occurance.
---
Normal until you realise you're 5 metres away from the window
---
Noed is so easy to get rid of though (for me anyway). Devour hope is one of the most fun perks in the game.
---
Jake didn't grew up in the woods
---
And as killer getting gen rushed should be a safety too.
---
Now this is what I joined the subreddit for.
---
Devour Hope can be amazing. Sure I’ve had it cleansed and become useless but ever since haunted grounds, if there is a lit totem and no obvious hex effects going on people tend to leave DH. It’s given me some great games. 
---
NOED is purely an end game crutch that can also be very handy. Apart from their potential on shot I don’t see a lot of similarities
---
A lot of Survivors consider camping and looping toxic, even though it isn't. (Most people here will downvote me for that).
---
A lot of Killers consider looping and genrushing to be toxic, even though it isn't aswell.
---
Toxic, by definition, has to achieve no higher purpose (it doesn't help your objective of killing/escaping) and it has to basically cause emotional harm or distress.
---
So taunting the killer (or survivor, but let's be real, it's usually the survivors who do it) or flaming your enemy(s)/teammates in post-game chat could be considered toxic.
---
Not everyone will agree on that, but if you go by facts this is the 'true' stuff.
---
Would you like your coffee Cypress, Ivory, or extra Ebony?
---
Yes! Let's nerf a B tier killer, what a idea! 99% stalk is a thing in case you don't know, make him easier to spot during a chase only by the survivor that he is chasing would be already bad. How about you play as him after wanting to nerf? You are the kind that made freddy be nerfed LUL
---
It's literally the Bi flag colors.
---
It was supposed to be a headache relief but I don't know if anybody ever actually tried it
---
This is some rank 70 shit right here
---
Yeah I’m aware, I got a 3 kill game yesterday, hooked 2 of them 3 times, one of them I hooked once then moried with rancor and the other escaped, I got deranked that game
---
It's a feedback loop. The survivors are abusing wake up, so it becomes impossible to play any killer other than nurse or Billy, which causes them to want to abuse wake up more. The problem originates on the survivor side though, as it was already hard brought to play killers other than Billy and nurse before the bug, but now it's impossible.
---
awesome nice work dude
---
Is it really that simple? And even if it is, they should still change it.
---
tips anyone?
---
I’ve been playing him non stop since release and he’s not really op. Broken yea but honestly stay in groups of 2 and you’ll break him out of his ability pretty quick and still be able to get away.
---
Mindgames...
---
Now the foliage looks like it came from the original LOZ: Ocarina of Time.
---
how do I do that without being pallet stunned, blinded, ds, dead hard, gen rushed and losing them
---
S'all good, you must be worse than an idiot if you struggle to play him, there's a killer tutorial in the menu to help you out. "Peace"
---
The forced "competitive" mode is already hell. The ranks in the middle are a huge grey area of good and bad players.
---
Lol, that scared me and I was just watching.
---
Honestly, killers have had enough buffs recently. It might be best to leave this one alone.
---
And exactly this is why noed needs to be reworked.
---
Doubling back round some cover is fine.  Running around the same pallet/tree 20-30 times while I charge up EW is just dumb.  It's not even like it's hard to deal with, just means I get a free down on any of their teammates who might  run nearby too.  
---
There were two of them nearly finished on a generator near the spot she was looping, but they gave up when I started gaining EW.  Smart teammate would've led me away, or tried to at least.
---
why people started to use BL instead of Sprint/lithe, and why so much stopped using self care, i wasn't playing for a year.
---
Wait so are you a bitch, a babe, or a sis? I'm confused
---
man the irony detectors in this subreddit
---
No its practically useless
---
no sorry it's not possible :/
---
Feel so hopeless to catch the last survivor? All the end game collapse did was make it harder for last survivor. I dont think the last survivor finding the hatch is 5050 at all. If the hatch was previously spawned then the killer likely knows where it is before you because they walk around everywhere and if it hasnt spawned until last survivor, then like you said they're faster than you and arent worried about being seen. Furthermore, if the killer closes the hatch, 99% chance the survivor dies cause the killers now wont even look for the survivor. They position themselves where they can see both doors and as soon as 1 has red lights, gg. What they SHOULD do, is remove the red lights from the exit doors to make it balanced.
---
/u/ThisTakenIsUsername's idea of using MMR is good. Literally anything but the current way of judging a player's "skill".
---
We’ve got thy self to prove
---
I’m in the process of burning all my offerings and addons on my hag so I can prestige cleanly
---
Depends what's hard for you what's your killer main
---
Sounds like not the best plays all around lol
---
Look, I gave you an opportunity to get out and make a run for it but noooooo
---
And you must loop really well to lose to a GF, how about you improve yourself instead of nerfing the other side? Puppers, tru3, the pos Pug can deal really easily with gf, but here you are, aren't ya? But I understand your side, it's easier to stay salty than trying to git gud
---
His acting is terrible in movies. Sure his acting is good in movies like John Wick, but in most other movies  his acting is completely terrible. His stunt scenes are AMAZING compared to his acting, I'll admit that and he is a good person, he's just not a good actor.
---
I dont play anymore havent for almost a year.
---
*wheezes in excitement.*
---
Nope it’s shit and just waste time
---
Nice
---
Huntress is crying in Russian
---
Hero.
---
If it’s swf cannibal is S tier
---
Correct me if I’m wrong but there is no deranking anymore?
---
We all have different taste. It just so happens yours is
---
 **t r a s h**
---
Salty survivor alert WOOP WOOP
---
100 hours after my comeback, and i have not played against plague to this moment lol.
---
Yup, survivors who cry about no-ed are just not aware. If you see someone drop way to fast or just see the text.
---
Change your strategy up.
---
I was recommending a perk...
---
That’s only because they couldn’t get bubbas license at first
---
I agree but this post disses my wide boii so I'm afraid I'm going to have to dislike it.
---
Is PWYF the attack cooldown one or the speed boost one?
---
As a person who plays only Dwight, seems legit
---
That's fair but I feel like to create a casual mode for new players isn't going to work out very well unless they implement some sort of soft ranking system based on a player's level and devotion, kind of how quickplay works on Overwatch
---
Im been playing ghostface religiously for the last week and every time I go into night shroud I get taken out from behind cover. Im like 85% the games detection is broken
---
Bad news: his changes are really small, you still won't find him fun :(
---
Even if you play perfectly, you won't win all the time. Sometimes you get a bad map, sometimes the survivors are just really good or really coordinated, and sometimes you make a small error that costs you the game. I have a couple killers that I've sunk a lot of time and points into, and when I lose with them I feel pretty bad.
---
I solved this by picking up a simple, low-level killer (in my case, the wraith) and equipping whatever perks I had, relaxing, and playing the game. If I won, fantastic, and if I lost, well, I was just learning and leveling a new killer. This helped put my mind at ease; you win some and you lose some.
---
In the short term, this could cause you to depip, but for me it helped me relax and improve my mentality when playing killer games in general.
---
TL;DR: Pick a low level killer and just mess around (try to win, obviously, but do it a bit more casually). I recommend Doc or Wraith.
---
"H o W  d I d  Y o U  f I n D  m E", idk, maybe the scratch marks abruptly ending
---
EVERY killer has to eventually deal with it lmao shit is the worst. And it can fuck over certain survivors as well. Which is why I always bring up separating modes when the topic comes up.
---
Seriously, I don’t get why they won’t implement earning Bloodpoints for being camped. I mean, it would technically be considered Distraction as you’re making the Killer do literally nothing else than having them watching you 24/7.
---
"i'm new, he is op" explain 99% of the cases of "GF NEEDS A NERF WTF"
---
now this does put a smile on my face
---
An amount of time.
---
I just played a ghostface game where I did not stop tbagging at any point, unless carrying a survivor ofcourse. I don't know how I got a 3k moving so slowly.
---
Needless to say I have a pinky of steel.
---
Lmao. This is the sort of realism we need more often from the community. Posts like this cheer me up from the rest of what's going on : )
---
Thank you u/redditisfkncancer, very cool
---
I have lowest input on my tv, but then also lower my resolution on my PS4 to 720p. Especially if I plan to play killer.
---
That's mostly just bad luck. This game is client-sided, and your connection is based on the killer's connection. Before a match, you can look at the color of the killer's connection bar on the bottom right. I usually dodge a lobby if it flashes red at any point.
---
HOWEVER, there's some good news! Servers are coming soon!
---
The salt is strong in this one. 
---
If you don’t like someone pallet looping you (Which is how you play the game) then go chase someone else.
---
That doesn't happen though. You can't jump through it when the killer is halfway through closing it. So that argument isn't even valid. And i wouldn't expect that anyway, if the killer starts to close it of course you wouldn't be able to jump through it. If I'm halfway through the hatch, it wouldn't slam you half in it unless you just barely started jumping in, which I'm not talking about, I'm talking about bei g half in the void already, at which point it would continue to push you through as it swings closed on an axis so it would come from above, it doesn't slide over it from the side.

---
I think every killer should have a cool down.. simple
---
But you kinda aren't supposed to live if they close the hatch it's more so if you get caught or you die from endgame.
---
Maybe do totems forehead
---
Exactly!
---
I cannot agree less. As a survivor you can open gates intermittently and even use those red lights as a distraction. You've gotta have some inner premonition about what you think the killer is doing but that betters with experience.
---
I agree with you. His best scenes are when there are stunts in my opinion. He's completely shit in movies when there are no stunts involved. Reddit is just a Keanu Reeves circlejerk. Hell, r/PewdiepieSubmissions sent death threats to a kid for  not thinking of Keanu Reeves as highly as everyone else does.
---
Exactly right I'm kind of surprised how little survivors do totems
---
It's just gameplay lmao. By your logic, if you die with claudette, then you can never use her again since you died with her. 
---
Also the entity for plenty of killers and can get new killers easily lmao.
---
It's used less at Red Ranks because Billy and Nurse get less use out of it
---
but nice attempt
---
Why does he need a nerf anyway?
---
Pig is literally speaking through a pigs head tho
---
Mettle won’t be useless for parties, but 1-2 parties will be hard to work with.
---
Oh. my. god. who the hell cares?
---
It's the killer version of D strike, adrenaline or other like perks. Could get used or could be a complete waste of perk slot. You have options with ruin as a survivor: work on the gen or find the totem. I don't understand what you mean by randomness. Also you don't like skill checks? It's a point opportunity and I don't really think it's luck based. If you're in madness and say the killer has 4 stacks of huntress making your checks distorted, random placement and no sound que then is it luck if you hit it? Personally I think there should 3 o'clock skill checks like back in the day and checks on totems and doors. More points!
---
This is not normal. The bloodpoints you spend on killers/survivors never reset unless you prestige the character. You can try contacting support but I doubt they will do anything.
---
Care to back up your statement or are you going to reply to numbers with "I know how I feel"
---
Played plenty of survivor.  Never had to resort to infinite looping.  If that's how you play the game, then you suck.
---
If you have time to walk far enough away from the hook or find another survivor then of course you will go about your business. Why would you run across the map or stop chasing someone just because someone got unhooked. Ive always played on ps4 where lobby chat isnt a thing so im not sure about the pc version. I do know one thing though, 50% of my 4 and 3ks come with a message from someone saying i won because i didnt play right or im bad....riiiiiiight....
---
There needs to be a way to keep track of how many totems are left for "just cleanse the totems" to be a viable thing. Cleansing 5 totems isnt as simple as it sounds when youre not swf, especially on certain maps.
---
I like that one that blocks gens when you pick the little homies up
---
Easier killer your kidding right? How is she so easy? So he has an instadown, but how does that  help him when he gets looped, cant slow the game down or track?
---
The best way to do this is to keep a few survivors around who only have 1 hook left. If someone is dead on hook, you can hook them while the bar is at about 45%, and it will trap the survivors in for the rest of the collapse if it's rank 3 Bloodwarden
---
I MISS THIS LOUD CHASE SOUND AND I MISS THE LOUD HEARTBEATS :(
---
Would be dope as fuck if he had a similar throwing mechanism as the huntress but with hooks that latch onto survivors during a chase and triggers a skill check for the survivor. Failing the skill check allows you to drag the survivor towards you closing the gap for a swipe if uninjured or a grab if they are already injured. If the survivor succeeds the skill check it stuns the killer and begins cooldown again.
---
The doctor is hard to beat if he plays Well, sneaking is not an option and using pallets/Windows is also hard due to the shock therapy. mainly you want to focus on gens as a survivor as the doctor doesn’t have great map preasure, most good doctors run unerving preseance combined with distressing and usualy at least one other anti gen perk which is pretty hard to counter but geting better at skillchecks and doing gens outside of his terror radius usually is a decent stratergy. While in a chase try not to get to cocky with Windows and pallets and do Your best to keep him away from gens that are being worked on to avoid unerving preseance from affecting those survivors. If he is camping try to focus on gens outside his terror radius to force him to either leave the hooked survivor or Lose the game. Really try to avoid having the last 3 gens close to each other, because of unerving preseance, overcharge and his static field he is one of the best killers if not the best at a 3 gen strategy.
---
AHHH, remember when the lobby was dark, foreboding, atmosphere and... I don't know not O R A N G E
---
Um, no? It’s how you play the damn game. Either the killers you go up against are shit or you manage to just stumble your way out of chases, but looping is literally how you buy time for others.
---
Good build up! Def would have made me jump too.
---
I don't really play killer, I'm rank 20 and I've just started to toy with ghostface
---
Today I played a game and there were 2 legacy Claudette's in the group (swf deranked to play with new killers) I managed to kill 2/4 survivors and you could clearly tell I was just getting the hang of his mechanics.
---
The post game chat from them 2 was horrendous. Although when one of them called me a newb and I replied well obviously duh I decided to leave it there and leave.
---
I'm a high ranked survivor (I main survivor) and I can't stand toxic end game chat from people I play with. Takes away from the enjoyability of the game. I've actually had a go at other survivors before for it too XD
---
Rank 14 toxic LMAO
---
Add this to Small Game
---
"Whenever any survivor cleanses a dull or hex totem, gain a token. Each token increases your cleansing speed by 1/2/3%"
---
I've been suggesting this for a while now. It takes 14 seconds to cleanse a totem without any perk effects. This would make it take 12.32 seconds for the 5th and final totem at level 3. Not a huge buff, but a small one. It would make the perk better overall IMO.
---

---
Here it is. They also did survivors. Again, this was before a couple of the new characters, but they did rip the models and use those in MMD or something
---
Nah, anyone will do it in solo queue
---
Except I'm stating what would happen if it worked the other way around, so it **is** a valid argument.
---
&gt; If I'm halfway through the hatch, it wouldn't slam you half in it unless you just barely started jumping in, which I'm not talking about, I'm talking about bei g half in the void already
---
I'm saying if your body was half caught (especially by the neck, oof…) in the hatch because the killer closed it mid-jump.
---
You need to get higher tiers of alert,survalince and fire up.
---
As for head on there must be a glitch head on lowest tier is rare which is green.
---
But for real good stuff. &lt;3
---
or you know, a real ranking system based on skill that doesn't just reset every month for funsiies.. Splitting an already small base into smaller groups will kill this game. I mean shit, if you're gonna do that.. then give us an option to opt out being match up with or vs SWFs.
---
[The killer.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/492/884/56f.png)
---
Yep I honestly stopped caring after I seen how even the best streamers get gen rushed and so on.. now I only base my games on how well I shut down chases and mind games. Sometimes there's nothing you can do against 4 highly skilled survivors so just try to have fun.. like sometimes after I hook a survivor I will moonwalk away from them or if i'm getting tea bagged as pig I will nod at them and then tea bag them back. If I suck with certain killers I will just set myself a goal like just going for my bbq stacks!
---
What are overwatchs issues?
---
 how many gens were left? if theres like 3 gens left and only 2 people left i dont blame you for hiding in a locker.
---
Agh shite my mate told me head on was yellow, but thank ya :) also I did the yellow perks because I wanted the colours to be different rather than them being mostly all purple with some greens &lt;3
---
Why Spirit is better than Hag :
---
A good Spirit is gonna down you if you don't have Iron Will, now that sounds are fixed. Even Spirits mains can confirm, without Iron Will, survivors are fucked,
---
For Hag to get downs, she needs a very good web, which can take a lot of time depending on the map. Big maps sucks ass for Hag, even more than for Spirit, and on a map like Rotten Fields or Shelter Woods, you will waste so much time with your traps, you won't be able to patrol gens and you will end up as a M1 110% killer. Hag mains can confirm, in fact, Hag mains told me this thing.
---
Hag is hard countered by SWF teams, flashlights and Object of Obsession. I saw so many Hags mains DCing because of OoO, I never saw Spirits mains DCing because of a perk. If a killer can't handle a perk, maybe he isn't top tier.
---
Spirit has counters for her counters. Yeah, Iron Will and Spine Chill sucks for her, but she can fake her power or use phase collision to find the survivor. Meanwhile, Hag just DC or camp OoO users, great counters btw.
---
I never saw Spirits dodging lobbys because of flashlights, meanwhile Hags ...
---
Spirit has better add-ons than Hag.
---
Spirit has better perk synergy than Hag.
---
Traps aren't guarantee free hits, if you abandon a chase because of a triggered trap and you don't get a hit, that my cost you the match.
---
I know and watch a lot of Spirit and Hag mains, and Spirit seems to be the more consistent killer, the killer who doesn't get as hard countered as Hag.
---
Its not always intentional though, sometimes the game just doesn't respond during loading screens so you have no choice but to task manager that shit.
---
They're called survivors because the game is about survival. The developers want situations where you may sometimes let your team mates die so that you can live.
---
Movement speed boost. 
---
You might be thinking of Save The Best for Last.
---
nice strawman bro
---
I agree, but one of the main reasons we dont have a real ranking system is BECAUSE there isn't a separate casual mode. Once there is, they can do everything you listed and then some.
---
I like to stay as Killer because I enjoy the trash talk afterwards.
---
But for other people I can 100% see where they are coming from.
---
Why should you stay in the post-game lobby if you're just going to get insulted?
---
You won? Great. You only won because you tunneled and camped, apparantly. Even if you didn't. 
---
You'll receive flame.
---
You lost? Well, fuck. Time for the survivors to show their big egos and see how they'll call you trash.
---
There is no reason to stay as killer.
---
What was wrong with her? I play her a lot and didn't notice anything. I'm not the best player so that may explain it.
---
I've seen every one of these complaints in some way, shape or form. Every one.
---
took me 48 hours to hear back. they're pretty quick.
---
Thank you.
---
&gt; I just think tunneling is made up
---
I mean, it very much exists. Killer focuses on killing one survivor in particular first, shooting themselves in the foot by not hitting anyone else just to get a specific kill. People do it to troll, as payback specifically, or because they don't really know how to play the game and think you have to kill survivors 1 at a time.
---
&gt;Let the killer play how they want and just do the gens and leave
---
Well I can't change how any killer plays, but if I went into a match knowing I was gonna win but spend 90% of my time on a gen, I'd rather just play any other game. It's in my incentive for the killer to not play boring, cause it literally benefits them and it makes the game more fun.
---
&gt;Not everyone is concerned about rank
---
Yeah, no one is actually concerned about rank. People want fun matches, not wins.
---
Yes exactly this! Create your own fun and sometimes survivors will react in fun ways too!
---
Not at all. 
---
It's called countering bbq and chili, it makes sense to do especially when there's only 2 survivors left.
---
christ you guys keep using overwatch as some shining example . Overwatch and how they balance thier game is garbage and why it's a failure as an esport.
---
And they need to down the Obsession. If they hit and down non-obsession survivors, they get nerfed.
---
U can play however you want my friend! Forget the haters
---
Think there was 3 one was a quarter way done

Put a cooldown on Billy's chainsaw and he isn't top tier for me anymore. His map pressure is what keep him that high, good survivors can already make him a M1 killer and Billy mains already tend to DC on bad maps for them ...
---
I wouldn't say it's distracting them. They either do it to be a dick or because it's a strat, so you're not really distracting.
---
I thought it was a pencil
---
Thanks for the link man! 
---
Surprising results. Did not expect Mountainous William to be as tall as the Trapper and Shape. Really did not expect that Huntress and Doc were so much taller. Sure doesn't look that way in the game.
---
I like how you are right and you even demonstrated it with arguments but salty survivors who can't counter NOED still vote you down because they just can stand if anyone isn't calling it an easy mode crutch perk.
---
thats fine then, whenever im in that situation i just let myself die on hook so the last person can get hatch, whoever messaged you was just salty.
---
Like I understand other survivors don’t want to die but don’t get tunnelled and you won’t get hooked, and tbh he didn’t do anything all game just hid round the edge of the map
---
These two addons instantly make DbD scary again. At least for me.
---
Gotta love basement cannibal!
---
Your life is the mostest importantest.
---
Sure, and every single survivor that plays this game feels exactly the same way. Each and every point, and none of them ever play killer. Ever.
---
Fuck off and go be toxic in some other community.
---
I mean I said "this is tunneling" and then they responded "that's not tunneling, why wouldn't I tunnel?"  I then responded back with "why are you talking about 'should?'"
---
I agree that we are arguing semantics, but it seems to me that the other person is who you should be explaining things to.

Clown is by far the hottest! That chubby bear mmm. That gut makes me wanna nut! Clowns Boyfriend
---
Nah man, just some fun lol
---
It happens regardless. I’ve played absolutely many killers who are completely scummy for no reason with no prompting. So I’m not really considering their feelings if I know it’s what they’d do right back.
---
Trust me, pre nerf pig’s bear traps were not underwhelming. Now she’s just ehhh.
---
you get stuck in there forever???
---
Especially billy
---
Not exactly in their hands when looking at him doesn't reveal him 50% of the time.
---
I’m sure. You’re still reaching. I don’t even play PC. There’s no post game chat. All of the things I’m talking about are in game. And I’m not talking about TBagging at the gate. I just mean bullying a killer and playing at maximum effort. But keep on guessing, human trash.
---
Lol, never noticed their feet before. But you know what they say about people with giant feet...
---
Anyway, Trapper is still the most physically imposing to me despite others being slightly taller.
---
None of them are about his skill as an actor though, and even if they were, that doesn't mean Keanu *himself* is bad, just that you are not a fan of his fans. So as l already stated, the memes are not [who] the man [is]
---
&gt; it given to you for free.
---
Yes, NOED gives the win/kills to you for free UNLESS:
---
- It doesn't activate at all because no dull is alive.
---
- You don't manage to get to the endgame phase because you ended up killing everyone before they got all gens - so you ended up wasting the perk slot.
---
- Someone cleansed NOED before you've gotten a hit off.
---
- The victim you found was injured anyways so you didnt profit from the instant-down (only from the speed buff but most people don't bother about that, as far as I know)
---
- The survivors end up escaping before you find/chase/hit them.
---
If none of these conditions is met, NOED 'might' reward you with one instant down. Something which a lot of killers don't even need because they allready got it in their kit.
---
And even then this one down doesn't allways mean that the guy you got is going to die on hook.
---
Don't get me wrong: NOED will stomp noob and average survivors. It might even be effective against YOLO-altruistic SWFs that knows that it's active but hook-bomb you anyways, because they'll try anything to save their buddy.
---
But good players (Killers and Survivors) don't care about NOED because as soon as you know how to counter it, people stop bothering with it.
---
It's average at best (at higher ranks) and I know that every salty survivor is going to downvote me for the truth.
---
Just bring it on. Give it another 300-500 game hours and you'll agree with me.
---
I do like this very much, thank you
---
And the giggle
---
Yeah i tried lunging, crouch walking and just regular walking out stuck until survivors escaped.
---
i’ve never seen how console performs. is it really that bad?
---
Yeah, i got 50 no prestige level on almost every character, but i want GhostFace bloody mask so damn much
---
You must repent. Play Freddy with no perks or addons.
---
This is from dead by daylight cartoon parody. Can’t remember which one it is though.
---
PC player here and I recently found out you can  turn of the chat bubble pre and post game.
---
This is honestly what was probably intended instead of over-altruism.
---
Except if you can't hit all great skills checks it would be faster to destroy ruin than to try and power through it. Honestly the main issue is that the pace of game has been greatly reduced, not lengthened. You don't really have any time to pursue secondary objectives or try to counter NOED in that regard. Gen rushing is the meta since there is not enough time to run the killer around to try and do anything else.
---
Wanted to respond but then I read your edit so I am not bothering with it.
---
You're either trolling or you're on a 50 IQ level. So I'll leave here :)
---
This honestly sounds like you read up about all the salt, before trying to get good first. Like you pre-equipped yourself with excuses.
---
One thing you'll wanna get used to, is when to *let go* of a chase. Sometimes someone just won't be worth it. If they're running far, far away from the remaining generators for instance.
---
All right I’m going to play a round and upload it to this sub
---
Facecamping Items is also acceptable.
---
M E N D
---
Thanks bruh means alot.
---
This combo has a hidden special ability. As soon as you kill anyone with the tombstone, the rest magically disconnect!
---
I have had people go as far as going on my steam page and leaving a comment stating that I am trash and no one should play with me ever... let’s just say that my comments are now friends only lol
---
I mean flashlights are an inherently frustrating mechanic. Nobody likes their screen being blinded. That’s on the devs not the survivors though
---
Your top two choices are a corpse and someone with the mentality of a small child? \*Slowly backs up and leaves.\*
---
Because all these people need to get stabbed by high school Susie for the meme.
---
until someone goes into a locker
---
Show him the breathtaking power of Keanu with the Nurse Mori
---
This happened to me as the last survivor. Killer downed me but was stuck in the pallet. I crawled away so he couldn't watch me die.
---
You had trouble against level 20s? Idk if this makes them or you look bad
---
To be fair You’re kind of sugesting a nerf to an already weak killer
---
&gt;  filthy blade
---
Here is your answer.
---
Dying Light maybe, did the obsession die?
---
Usually when I play swf and this happens I gotta say that most killers would look down on that I mean I play killer like 4/5 so I like to say I know what’s up as a killer
---
Nah it doesnt hes gonna die most likely anyway ur just getting there before the killer can close it. Too many killers tunnel nowdays tho
---
it’s worse on ps4
---
but the addon says “moderately increases the time required to mend”?
---
no dying light. nurses, bbq, whispers and discordance.
---
Accept swf is a feature included within the game which means that it doesn’t go against the end users license. 
---
SWF is not toxic in of itself being able to talk to other people isn’t toxic. Tea bagging, flashlight spamming that’s toxic, saying “the killer is on me do gens”isn’t.
---
Balance issues with some heroes and the ranking system.
---
Honestly true man people play like complete pussies and walk on the other side of the map when they know a killer is chasing someone and someone is hooked
---
Is that like a club for DbD killers except Freddy
---
I’ve been slowly getting my roommate into horror movies. She’s a writer and is very critical so she has only liked a select few (You’re Next, Scream, Hush). 
---
I didn’t think she would like I Know What You Did Last Summer because the writing is pretty cheesy, but she ended up loving it. It’s still one of my favorite nostalgic movies from my childhood, so I could see The Fisherman as a potential killer!
---
I don't disagree, but my point is, if the devs aren't good with optimization, at the very least you have the option to beef up your rig on PC, but your hands are tied on console and you're at the mercy of the devs.
---
Even a month or so ago I saw a post on the main subreddit asking for people to show appreciation to himself and 2 other people for "their contributions to the subreddit" literally just a post asking people to up vote him and his pals.
---
It's cause you're leatherface
---
Leader does not effect gens anymore but almost everything else. Prove thyself is now the gen perk. Red bars on gen could be a couple things. Overall means the work is slowed for sone reason. 2 people on 1 gen is a red bar. Thantaphobia in use you get a red bar.
---
Pig also can do the crouch
---
Noobs they disconnect when meet pro killers to get their rank to 20. many players leave the game thinking the game is too hard due to seal clubbers noobs. This happen all the time in other games not just DBD.
---
&gt; I have 2k hours, thanks. 
---
And you still don't get it. That's the sad part.  
---
&gt; but I can be chased all game by some boosted midrank killer 
---
That's a big problem with bhrv's ranking/pip system. People are in ranks where they shouldn't be. Pip when they shouldnt. Not pip when they should. Also people end up getting matched with people in way higher/lower ranks then themselves.  
---
&gt; not have my team cleanse any totems 
---
That's on your team. I can't see how one would go: My team refuses to do X (counterplay), and that's why (killer perk here) is OP!  
---
&gt; then get facecamped 
---
Do you get facecamped THAT often?
---
&gt; and depip 
---
Wait. NOED only activates at the end of the game. By this point you should have been able to gather enough points to ATLEAST black pip.   
---
Especially for someone with "2k hours" this seems to be a very low/bad performance.  
---
&gt; and THAT is the issue with NOED.  
---
So your teammates being stupid + the game boosting killers to a rank where they shouldn't be + killers facecamping you + you depipping because you seem to be useless so far ... results in NOED being too strong?
---
As I said, the perk is average. It's great against noobs, it's bad/average against good survivors who expect it. 
---
And that's okay, I guess. I don't use NOED because if I use it on purp/red ranks it ends up giving me one extra down every 6th match - while being useless the other 5.
---
But that's just me I guess.
---
But you’re preventing them from doing anything else.
---
I definitely understand the frustration, and I’ve toyed with the idea myself, though I do think it’s more balanced to show the lights, as when you’re not the last survivor, it’s good to know what gates have been started or 99’d. 
---
It’s still high risk but one thing to try - if you’re stuck trying to do gates after a hatch is closed, try opening a gate about 15% or so. It’s usually about 2-3 seconds maybe. I always start a gate and stop before the lights come on and then hide. Once the killer checks, I can rush and finish the gate probably half the time, depending on the killer. It’s not foolproof and if the killer has Whispers, you’re probably out of luck, but it is a strategy that can help ensure an escape sometimes.
---
Noice
---
 True, pig could be higher, but I'm just considering their regular walking animation (no abilities).
---
I've complimented killers who have 4kd the group I was in.  I figure a 4k always deserves a congrats.
---
For me Myers is a big spooky boi when he walks. If you want me to scream then just bust him out
---
The add-on is bugged atm, just like Wake Up.
---
98% of the time its, "you're trash killer" or any other variation of it.
---
Are you playing with 7.1 or 5.1 sound by chance?
---
His ability is super damn buggy, instant one hit down every time and it doesn't seem to matter whether I look at him or not.
---
Survivor is decent these days. The frames are actually in the 40-50 range. Still frequent frame drops. For killer, it's around 30 FPS (with some maps like the Swamp closer to 20), also with frame drops. For instance, often the game will freeze for a second when you hit Bloodlust. Instead of helping like it should, it often screws you over. Not fun.
---
Either you made a new account, or one of you stole this work. https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c20j8x/hello_reddit_this_is_my_skin_design_for_legion/

---
Good, they got what they deserved
---
The letter B in DBD stands for Bugs lol the more they patch things, the more bugs we face...
---
I know you better get outta ma face. Outta ma face! Outta ma face!!
---
I'm in purple ranks and I still hate this game. The gameplay is just boring and frustrating especially if the killer tunnels you to death when the game just started. I just play because there is nothing else to play
---
It's:  Dead By Daylight Parody 6 (Animated) by Samination. The clip starts at 3:06 :P
---
I don't like the ability, but I like the backstory. Kinda remind me of hilly Billy who was the substitute for leatherface, before they got the license to use him. Or the substitute for Ghostface as legion. This one could be the substitute for chucky
---
i main Ash I was playing Nea to use up offerings lmao but im not sorry
---
Good god man, why are you doing this to yourself
---
I'll interrupt by saying that the best skins for the games mechanics in DBD are actually the free ones (especially Claudette's) since this game gives advantages to those who can stealth well. Not only that, but most of the costumes can be earned for free (albeit with a lot of time put in). 
---
Fortnite actually has been proven to develop an anti noob mentality where players *have* to buy skins so that they aren't ridiculed for wearing a default skin. DBD encourages the opposite.  If you are a person who plays poorly with a expensive skin in DBD, you are *expected* to learn how to play in a default skin prior to wearing the neon bright colors so that you aren't spotted as easily.
---
In both games, I admit wearing a cash only skin is a sign of prestige, but while Fortnite expects everyone to wear them, this game doesn't. Not only that, Fortnite makes nearly all skins limited in their purchase window, to entice players to "buy it now before it's gone" whereas very few DBD skins exist in the same manner
---
You can get picked up - it doesn't count as a hook. It's only shitty if the rest of the team is terrible and won't help you.
---
What addons for Legion
---
I don't think devs mention any bugs/perks not working as intended because they don't want people to abuse them, so probably not.
---
Yeh, this is what I was expecting. Color me pleasantly surprised.
---
But the perks aren't really good
---
For drug money, Amanda would be whatver you wanted her to be ;)
---
I'm not sure how many people want to endure a huge wall of text.
---
oh thank you
---
Well this killer is not just the dummy, the vetriliquist is there to
---
Pretty Woman for Leatherface, hands down.
---
Tru3 deranks 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
I agree on the Wraith. He sounds like he is wearing scuba fins while in indoor maps.
---
This is actually pretty nice and I would totally run that. Would also help counter thrill too
---
You literaly Said ”spotted the doc main no brain” and then you Said that he was hypocritical...
---
Also low Level of intelegence? You spelled typical wrong, could be a typo but it proves My point
---
Distracting is like when you throw a pebble.
---
the higher your rank the better your team mates do, 20~14 rank don’t know how to do anything gens not even saves,  they will hide in the corners or they all attack the killer ending them all hooked.
---
I'm laughing entirely too hard at this.
---
It's not wholesome. It's just a game. Nobody should get this upset over it in the first place. It would be wholesome if people were nice to each other despite losing, or apologized for a poor play without first having to be browbeaten into it.
---
Hag is at least a B. Spam trap on a downed survivor
---
Survivor #1: you're breathtaking
---
Survivor #2: NO U
---
Same hahaha, I don't remember seeing a post about ghostface in which people want him nerfed, as a survivor main I think he is perfect rn, I get jumpscares all the time. Wouldnt want him nerfed tbh, altho it taked time to get used to him, it is still a fun process. Tbh when i see all these dont nerf posts i feel like people would ask for nerfs moe than they nornally would.
---
Whoa a civil response that makes sense, you sure you're in the right place? And yeah I agree this is about the only thing you can do but yep still gets you hooked probably more than half the time, killer depending. Just feelsbadman when hatch closes.
---
Whatever man. If you’re too damn stupid to meet me at that very middle ground, then I’m definitely not going to overestimate your intelligence.
---
I’m on PS4 and the music/TR is very quiet. I’ve been trying to adjust to it but it feels much more difficult to gauge killer distance. 
---
Oddly enough, I was having that problem consistently but I did load the game up again after putting it in Rest Mode once and it was back to normal. I was so excited. However, the menus were so laggy that I restarted the game and it was back to being quiet. Probably just some weird instance (as it was also showing the glowing BP icon after Bloodhunt was over). 
---
I believe the patch notes said this was intentional but we need to have the option to adjust it. Lowering it a bit may have been fine but it’s near non-existent and is a real problem for killers and survivors.
---
There is no "best skin", the best skin is the one you like the most whether that's for an advantage in game or one you like the look of the most. The fact that you think Fortnite expects you to wear them confuses me. I don't expect anyone to wear a costume. I just want to play the game, same as DbD.
---
Don't survivors pretty much get nerfed every patch? This patch survivors took a big hit with vaults.
---
If the devs got the license for a character, they would make it a playable character, not waste it on cosmetics. They've stated this before.
---
They should add game chat
---
Wow, that’s a really pessimistic way of looking at things... Some people do play to have fun, not to be the absolute best. I personally let survivors escape all the time if I already got my rise out of the game. Not everyone is as rude as you or how you think they are. It’s a game. No need for random insults.
---
Claudettes no gens done still gets to the hatch by the killer help. WTF
---
Mine took a couple of days at most.
---
Apparently ya'll missed the sarcasm. This sub 🤦‍♀️😂
---
I disagree. Keanu Reeves is an awesome guy, and the more you learn about him, the more awesome you find out he actually is. The amount of memes around him may seem insufferable, but the memes are not the man. Disliking the memes does not mean Keanu himself is bad, just that you are not a fan of his fans (and possibly his work).
---
I play with so many braindeads.   
---
Also it seem to be a survivor trend to show the killer where your teammates are if you do one mistake and your team doesnt like it. So I started taking a key with me each round. If I myself do not make the mistake to get caught I can sneak around as long as everyone dies and get the hatch after I followed the killer when he managed to close it.    
---
I want to win and I often don't because of trolls. So I force the win. Easy.
---
Nah, its ways funny. Slugging is scummy though
---
I combined her scream with the chase music also and it’s scary how well they fit together.
---
"mine!, mine!, mine!"
---
I know you are only posting this to get attention, and that you probably just want someone to call you breathtaking, but because everyone needs to be given a boost in their lives...
---
"YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!"
---
As a new player, thank you. I just started last week, and I’ve already been camped multiple times. I hope as I rank up that won’t happen as much since sometimes it ruin the game for everyone in the match (every other person escapes mostly untouched as the killer won’t go for other people doing gens).
---
How dare you, you monster!
---
And now I lay you down to sleep... I do not pray the Entity your soul to keep
---
Thanks for the nicely put opinion. I’d rather discuss these ideas than argue with some idiot. Yeah, I guess it is rather jaded, but over my time playing this game I’ve always tried to come back with a positive expectation and fun times, but most of the time I’ve been let down. Eventually it makes it hard to just play normally. But that’s not to say I’m toxic to every killer, I just don’t let up when the match isn’t in their favor. I keep pushing until they’re completely beat down.
---
u/veraduxgalahad gay lol
---
The problem is that the time they would have to invest in manually transferring your account assuming they don't have a system for it in place would be a significant cost, probably even more than price of the game. And then by doing so they would set a precedent for other's to ask for account transfers. The only good way would be for them to develop a system for account transfers but again that would be a huge time investment.
---
Am I the only one where it seems like they crash like they all leave at the same time and when they do die on hook and stick around they tell me to fix my internet it’s never happened before only after ghostface
---
Devs said that Nurse is high priority for them, so you should put her after Ghost Face door.
---
Cause this isn't really a big achievement. "Look guys I did a medicine thing praise me" fuck off honestly
---
F for fix
---
When I solo queue, it's about 25%. When I queue with at least one more person, it's more like 70%. I'm a decent purple rank survivor, and my friends could be rank 1 survivors if they put the time in to it. We're all objective focused, and all pretty good in chases.
---
I solo queue about 95% of the time, but this weekend I've been playing with a friend. On Saturday, I played about 12 games with my friend, and only died once. It was 6 games before I was even hooked. Sunday and Monday I played with a different friend who plays at higher ranks, and we still managed to escape about 70% of the time.
---
SWF definitely changes things up, even though we're fairly casual about it, mostly just coordinating when someone needs a save/heal. We don't run insta-heals or flashlights or anything crazy, and usually we're just bs'ing about other things while we play, but the small amounts of communication really help.
---
Oh definitely. Not that it should be easy persay for the last survivor, it should be tough, but if anything, I feel like survivors are more pressured to hatch camp and ignore their final teammate more than ever. Heck, I’ve been first-hooked in such a situation many times and almost felt obligated to suicide. 
---
I guess this is just a thought for discussion but how would you feel about the killer being able to shut the hatch, but not able to hear it from a distance?
---
&gt;And you still don't get it. That's the sad part. Why are you even in midranks if you have 2000+ hrs?
---
&gt;You seem to be doing something wrong.
---
I don't play as much as I used to. And I don't play as much Survivor as I used to.
---
&gt;That's on your team. I can't see how one would go: My team refuses to do X (counterplay), and that's why Y(killer perk here) is OP!
---
This is again just an issue with the ranking system, but NOED then comes into that issue because I would pip if I escaped. It is then on my team to cleanse the totem and save me to help me pip, which is on NOED being too powerful.
---
&gt;Do you get facecamped THAT often? And what does it have to do with NOED?
---
Don't underestimate boosted NOED killers.
---
&gt;Wait. NOED only activates at the end of the game. By this point you should have been able to gather enough points to ATLEAST black pip.Especially for someone with "2k hours" this seems to be a very low/bad performance.
---
I do now with the new system of getting 1/3 gen points during a chase, but before at midranks with iri chase emblem and fuck all else, you would depip.
---
&gt;So your teammates being stupid + the game boosting killers to a rank where they shouldn't be + killers facecamping you + you depipping because you seem to be useless so far ... results in NOED being too strong?
---
Yep, running the killer round all game to let the other survivors push the objective with ease is me being useless. What a very sensible conclusion. You seem to think your arguments out very well.
---
&gt;Since you are in the 'midrank' space you seem to fall under the 'Getting stomped by NOED because you don't apply the appropiate counterplay' category.
---
Like I said, I hadn't had the chance to play a lot, resulting in me having to sit in middle ranks. Now that it's summer and I am finished with university this year, I am now in Red Ranks. Shockingly, I almost never see NOED, even after not cleansing totems all game. Strange how that works, isn't it? It's not even exclusively Billy/Nurse games either!
---
A deranking 4 man SWF, all using the dwight bike helmet cosmetic while having autism in their names. Use all the exploits you want, but making fun of autism both in game and in post game chat is ugly for yourself and the dbd community. Yes, humor is subjective but this was disrespectful and tasteless IMO.
---
*oman*
---
A job well done.
---
DS is actually better than before, change my mind
---
come up with something original and not another boring ass tired licensed killer
---
Nearly 90% of the time. I play to live, so I will leave people. 
---
The balance is fine. Nothing too bad.
---
I suppose fast vaults and the hitboxes.
---
To me solo is easier. I dont have to save or protect i just do gens, cleanse totems and leave.
---
I agree, I personally thought the chase volume was fine but they shouldn't have decreased it this much.
---
?
---
The last guy always stares into my eyes and I feel bad because of his team
---
You must not have many friends if you felt the need to post about the fact that you actually made s friend.
---
If you run NOED on a Billy at high ranks there's something wrong going on.
---
That's pretty badass actually.
---
Perfect positioning!
---
I've always wanted a Vampire or a Werewolf killer.
---
This is just wrong. Huntress is strong bunny mom, she will sing u 2 sleep. Susie is just cute, pig is a tiny oink like a little stuffed animal, and myers is myers
---
That perk is just for memes now.
---
That's survivor main confirmation bias. You only remember/notice bad manners when it comes from killers because you're not on the receiving end of your teammates toxicity.
---
Count how often which side starts hostilities in chat and you'll quickly change your mind.
---
They can do an hours played to bloodpoints conversion. Like they did when peoples accounts got cleared
---
Unlikely, but did the killer have Knockout?
---
This meme is inaccurate. You shouldn't be able to be hit with NOED. The Threepeater can still hit you for about 2 tiles.
---
LOL
---
they say its op because he can t-bag
---
I played Insidious Nurse once. It was pretty fun to see the post game chat
---
KOICHI GET OFF THE GEN
---
&gt;Yep, running the killer round all game to let the other survivors push the objective with ease is me being useless. What a very sensible conclusion. You seem to think your arguments out very well.
---
So what you are basically saying is:   
---
The game starts. The killer instantly finds you (because you didnt seem to have the possibility to do any objective/altruistic action).   
---
Then you loop him for 5-10 minutes straight untill the exit gates are powered. Then he hits you with NOED, facecamps you and you lose and depip.  
---
And that's why NOED is OP (and my argument is shit).  
---
And that's the majority of NOED games for you.  
---
I am sorry dude but that's straight up bullshit. But I guess you're willing to die on this hill. I am not willing to argue this furthermore.  
---
I don't agree.  
---
And to everyone who honestly thinks that NOED is brokenly overpowered - I can just shake my head and roll my eyes.  
---
So I'll leave here.   
---
But congrats on finishing university anyways.
---
Only that of the MacMillan Estate
---
Yea that would make it a solid counter perk to noed
---
&gt;There is no "best skin"
---
You obviously haven't googled "dead by daylight blendette" (without quotes)
---
Nonetheless, it's not you specifically as an individual player, but it has been shown that the playerbase of Fortnite has shown to actually bully free players into buying skins. [Here](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18534431/fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment) is an article explaining the phenomenon (and the fact that l didn't make this up)
---
Yeah they use codenames for each folder
---
suck my dick
---
No. Not at all please no.
---
why the fuck are you stealing art work and calling it yours? Thats so fucked up and you are just a bad person. get the fuck off reddit.
---
Yes but a doll running around in the grass and then BAM! That would scare the hell out of me.
---
And this is why we need to remove AutoMods. Automod is TERRIBKE
---
You're a monster
---
It's simple
---
1. T Bagging behind pallets or by infinite loops.
---
2. Not doing any gens whatsoever and all teammates rush the hook.
---
3. That person is running a bugged ability (looking at you quentin) 
---
4. That person is running an obvious counter ability. (Saboteur / OoO)
---
Thank you i thought so too!
---
I'll be tunnel survivors that drop pallets in front of each other or farm off the hook. Gives the survivor that got dicked a chance to escape while the other gets punished.
---
I do it when they deserve it. I needed to do a doctor mori for a daily and this jake kept following me with a flashlight trying to blind me whenever I picked someone up. Obviously, they didn't need to be mori'ed but I felt like they deserved it. Like that's not how you play survivor so please take till L and go back to yellow ranks XD.
---
got that very quickly when i started. thought i was a natural, then i got to lower ranks...
---
I did not know that they released DbD for Toasters. Can't wait to download it on mine too.
---
I don't get this at all center the camera. Even with addons it's not hard. This is not the first killer you have to break line of sight with in a chase.
---
It depends. A survivor took my Hex: Ruin faster than I could move to it from spawn, and by the time I downed them 2 gens popped. I basically said F it, I have to tunnel this guy or the match will be over in two seconds. I didn't tunnel because I was upset with the survivor, I mean he spawned on the totem, but in my eyes there was just no other way to possibly even the ground for that match.
---
Hopefully this new archive system they will be introducing in
---
\*checks watch\*  
---
Not soon enough, will help out people who don't want to save 3 people as David Tapp. Because who plays Tapp.
---
Move along, folks. Just another survivor main crying because they didn't get their free escape.
---
Honestly hate it, The killer always just camps me out and i legit cant do anything about it, I really hope people start to catch on that nerfing survivors more is not the way 2 go. Survivor is becoming worse and worse after every patch bc people wont stop complaining.
---
Thought the same, I know someone who got banned for changing the files. EAC picked up on something at least.
---
Sure, I didn't really expect it to work, but it didn't hurt to ask.  
---
Though I'm sure it would be a little less hectic than to manually do it item by item, each profile surely contains data of how many of each item it has, data you can copy.  
---
In any event, the explanation they gave me is that "all progression is unique and unrelated", which I didn't quite understand. No big deal, though.
---
I jumped. Would have screamed in game. 10/10
---
Who tf places 5 sunflowers in a row

I'm amused at how many survivors are saying a perk is "useless" once it goes from being OP to (God forbid!) forcing them to have to put in a little bit of work for it.
---
I mean if we pull off a 4 man escape after the killer tried to camp people, I sure as hell will put an "easy" or "get rekt camper" in there for the heat of the moment.
---
The only time I ever feel inclined to pursue a specific person is if they’re ratting out their teammates or trying to farm, because they’re ruining the spirit of the game for everyone but that’s me. Even then, I’ll give them a chance to play the game but if someone continually points to other teammates hoping to get mercy for themselves, I shut it down. 🤷‍♀️ 
---
Totems are powerful for one reason - they’re high risk. That’s just the nature of the perk. Punishing a survivor for doing a totem to try to help their team, in my opinion, is a bit cruel. That said, if I see someone do a totem, of course I’ll pursue them and hook them, but I don’t make it my life mission to ruin their match. Besides, tunneling and camping only means less BP for me and an easy boring game for the others. And by this totem logic, you’d have to punish any survivor who is doing anything except asking you to kill them.
---
whoa, what the fuck! that’s mine! this is literally my facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Prjestly
---
notice how the names match? Shania Vella? please report them as it’s not their work. 😡
---
yeah great effort needed to club someone to death with a spiked club
---
Yeah exactly. 
---
I mean, maybe I’m clueless to this, but was anyone asking for this change in the first place? At least before if it was too loud, a player could lower it in the settings. Now we don’t have the choice at all.
---
Keys dont even come close 2 ebony moris power, i key can let a few survivors max escape if they can hunt down the hatch and get out. A ebony mori however rewards the killer for doing there objective. at least with keys the survivors have to multitask and change the way they are playing to use them, With moris its legit just
---
Get hook. Dead.
---
Lol the old "I'm a killer main" argument.
---
Good to see the BHVR team behind punishing toxic players are hard at work.

I mean, I feel like it's more effort than a blade
---
I’m happy to see that there’s no daily discussion thread and the two killer game exploit is back in public games. For a dev that has all this money to spend on licensed characters you’d think maybe we wouldn’t get so many bugs.
---
&gt;Doors powered? Kills after don't count.
---
LOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
---
If they are playing scummy then you will know they are scummy. If you preemptively play that way that's what I'm saying is wrong.
---
Lmao can I get the template for this
---
See this is how you know this guy have neither played against GF a lot or played at rank 1
---
If that was a lit totem and I don't run HG, I'd probably go harder on him than the others, especially if he dares approach the general area of that totem just one more time. Wouldn't necessarily tunnel him, but I'd understand it if you did. You gotta protect your perks.
---
Also, if someone runs OoO, again: wouldn't necessarily tunnel, but go hard on them, especially if they hard counter me (Pig/Spirit main, playing lots of Ghostie these days). I understand it's your business which perks you pick, but you're disabling my power and I can't be lenient with that. I'll run an extra 5m for you even if there's an easier target around for sure.
---
I'd only go for actual tunneling if someone's being a toxic shithead to me or their teammates. People that farm others off hooks when I know they don't have BT also deserve to die. Usually, the one that got farmed I'll give the Hatch to; just as a bonus "fuck off" to the farmer. Same with bodyblocking other Survivors. Survs who throw their teammates under the bus are the worst scum and deserve to die a frustrating death.
---
I'd never camp. That's just so mindless and boring, I couldn't stand it; and if the person was toxic towards their own team, they might not get saved anyway.
---
In Freddys dreams...
---
They said people were complaining but I have never seen anyone complain just like you said.
---
Should be the names of each Legionnaire, followed by mixtape.
---
Not yet
---
&gt;Good to see the BHVR team behind punishing toxic players are hard at work.
---
BHVR can only punish players if other people report them appropriately. You'd be surprised how often people can't be bothered to just click in the report button, let alone record something in case of other violations. 
---
Chat messages are probably the easiest bans to deliver.
---
Hmm, I never thought of it that way. Interesting theory!
---
GF is one of my least fav killers 2 go against flat out. I dont care what anyone says, He just does not work
---
I have played against him so many times but i can only recall 3 enjoyable games against him (Enjoyable as in not terrible). The players that play him are just assholes flat out. 
---
And before you go all Reddit super killer warrior on my ass on how I main survivor and how i deserve to get camped, tbagged, or tunneled over and over Just bc i play survivor. Dont. you are the exact reason Everyone thinks reddit killers are jokes.
---
&gt;How about you ban people who disrespect other peoples life that much from your community? Would be awesome.
---
As long as you report them, they are punished. If not immediately, eventually as the reports start to pile up.
---
I am limited by the technology of my time.
---
Yes Freddy is in the corner with legion until mommy developer gives them a buff
---
Mabey, just mabey, there could be a whole new perk to increase vault speed. But wake up should not effect vault speed.
---
What is supposed to be happening in this picture ?
---
The killer is giving the last guy the hatch
---
Shouldn’t this be the other way around??
---
If I spot a baby Meg I try to make sure they escape no matter what. Sometimes if I'm feeling extra nice I'll let her get to a pallet and stun me a few times to make her feel better. Any other baby survivor I'll be nice and not death hook them but I'm not letting them out. But the baby Megs must be protected at all costs
---
Btw the guy just sat on the loading screen for 10 mins and then ended stream, Honestly better then most dbd streamers
---
When have you ever seen a good killer make a turnaround with doors open? They basically have no pressure- the only thing that keeps survivors around to die is their own greed for saves
---
Really the only thing here that would take effort is hand hand. Everything else could kill with probably one swing if done right
---
Because either it's the only truly competent game of it's genre on the market, and/or we're angry because we love the game and want it to be better.
---
no I understood, but what is happening in the blurred part ?
---
I can sense the salt after that, 10/10
---
You'd think, but no. Enough blunt force trauma to the head can be equally as lethal as a knife
---
&gt;Saboteur
---
&gt;When do you condone the act of tunneling and or camping?
---
Tunneling? always. I don't care who you are, i only care that you're injured. If that means you die first, you die first. I don't care. Making the tactically superior choice isn't toxic, sorry.
---
Camping? usually only during EGC where it's actually the better option. I just finished a match where hooking one person gave them the choice of going for the unhook or leaving. They went for the unhook, and i got another kill out of it. But outside of that? Nah, you're just giving up map control. Don't do it.
---
HEY MAN. THIS ISNT YOUR WORK, THIS IS MINE! YOU LITERALLY STOLE IT FROM ONE OF THE DBD FACEBOOK GROUPS I POSTED IT IN! GET YOUR OWN WORK AND STOP STEALING OTHERS. IT LITERALLY HAS MY FULL NAME ON IT AS A WATERMARK. 🤥🤥😡
---
You need to juggle a lot and use the advantage of being invisible and your glimpse when survivors are transitioning. Or don't use them and run Pill Bottle. I'm not saying Freddy is good, he is bad, lets be honest, but you can somehow use his power to your advantage. As a lot of stealth killers Freddy excels in Hit&amp;Run tactic. Survivors often stupidly wake themselves up by selfcaring, so they are injured and they have no idea where the killer is (especially with Pill Bottle). You shouldn't chase for too long as Freddy, haunt them in their nightmare :P  
---
And as I said, he's quite bad still...
---
I mean Ghostfaces Knife kinda looks like a toy especially when it's bloody and it seems a little more effort would be needed with that tiny toy knife.
---
That’s the point of totem perks. Extremely powerful with the risk of being disabled at any time.
---
"Myers is Myers" fucking word, put him at the very goddamn bottom of this thing.
---
Nurse deserves to be more at the top. She's with Wraith, so we know these two are quite romantic.
---
Also, you step away from my Ghostie Boy right the fuck now, or else-
---
It counters trapper I believe. I may be wrong though
---
Why is Nurse's saw so high up? You'd need to hit them at a pretty awkward angle, or across the throat to kill them.
---
Hag's hand should be much higher. In her mori, she disembowels a survivor with it.
---
That would be fine I’d ruin wasn’t required unfortunately it is
---
If you see this, please vault through the pallet to knock them loose. Otherwise, they're stuck there the entire game.
---
To be fair, Object tends to get you tunneled regardless if it counters you or not. You can’t really fault a killer for it, you get to see where a survivor is from across the map.
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
They would be fine I’d ruin wasn’t almost necessary and needed
---
IIRC, the knife Ghostface uses in the game and films was critiqued for being a terrible tool for skinning animals, which was its intended purpose.
---
I think you don;t loose pips when DCing now? And that's why a lot of rank 3-4 DCs because they don;t want to derank or something... not sure tho
---
I really shouldn’t be talking tho since I play Billy
---
Yeah classic new killer syndrome - comes out imba then eventually gets nerfed to regular strength
---
you could also use a binary counter converter hooked up under the gen with the button, equipped with a reset when you want to start the trial (reset would be very quick), how much you need to press the button would also be selected by you however i dont think it would be possible to add a feature that regresses the progress, you would need the dropper system for that :L
---
Ghostface should be S Tier
---
Hiding behind a gen doesn't work anymore, auras have different colours.
---
Idk, it just looks like a cat being put down (not in the peta sense)
---
Yeah, uh. The "original" poster isn't the original poster.
---
Please do explain to me how im supposed to have a GF be in the center of my screen, Have him be visible, hide behind cover, and make sure he does not leave sight for even half a sec.
---
I will tell you, You cant. 
---
If the killer hides behind anything for even half a sec you wont be able to reveal him in time before he exposes you, You cant hide behind cover bc most of the time that means he sees you, and you cant run out in the open and stare at him bc he will either get behind a wall or somthing for half a sec then eat ur ass or just expose you from charge he had earlier
---
That's interesting so does that mean the knife would require more effort to kill someone with it? I'm guessing yes.
---
What an idiotic comment....not surprising from you. Maybe people aren’t using it because, I don’t know, it’s complete trash since the time spent trying to get it to proc isn’t worth the reward whatsoever? Maybe people don’t want to follow the killer around to take 3 “extra” hits, heal multiple times, in exchange for being able to take one injured hit for free? Add to that buggy protection.
---
Thank you and if i remember correctly the guy i did that too did actually rage quit.
---
Yeah but it can happen every minute which means 1/4 the game the generators are disabled?
---
i play as him at high ranks, and against him at high ranks, literally everyone is doing that, ur the only one who is bitching about him asking for a nerf
---
So you just forgot we have two motherfucking chainsaws in the game?
---
That is true. I just figured "bonesaw, that would be super easy to kill someone with right?"
---
we all vaulted over and over until he got free 😸
---
Thank you, good sir!
---
I was only using M1s lol
---
wait for real? If thats the case then i apologize. But i need more proof
---
Yes and no.
---
If you were trying to stab someone, it would do the job alright, you'd have to try your best though.
---
If you were trying to slash them, you'd have a tougher time
---
The "original" poster is an art stealer, this is my artwork! I posted the full thing in the DBD forums, it even has my real name on it as a watermark!

---
True true. With doc being 9 feet tall I'm sure headshots are easy enough
---
It was neutered, no, it was EUTHANIZED by the unnecessary cooldown given to it
---
Oh I see thanks
---
I'm all ears sucks doodoo
---
Anyone can be rank 20 after enough rank resets/deranking. Their perk set ups clearly aren't real rank 20s
---
I get OoO and flashlights suck for Hag, but she still can work through it like Spirit can with Iron Will and Spine Chill. It won't be easy dealing with OoO and flashlights as Hag, but it also isn't easy dealing with Iron Will and Spine Chill as Spirit.
---
As someone who has talked to multiple Hag mains and as someone who plays her at an intermediate level, Hag is one of if not the least map dependent killer in the game. She does not care what map it is; she can still do fine. With Hag, you don't wanna be an immediate chaser; let them come near your web and give them hell. Take time to set up your web, but don't go overboard. Also don't try to chase people without traps nearby. Traps aren't guarenteed hits, but they are likely hits. Spirit's mind games are also likely hits, but are not guaranteed either. The difference is that one is a mindgame and the other is a triggered trap. Mind games leave some chance of the survivor predicting what you're doing, even if in Spirit's case it isn't that often, while triggering traps is very hard to avoid doing mid chase. I know Spirit is very tricky to deal with as survivor with all her mind-fuckery, but Hag can more easily disregard pallets and windows, a survivor's main defense.
---
Don't take this as me saying Spirit is bad; the opposite is true. I truly understand why people praise Spirit as top 3, but I don't agree with it being THAT high. She is almost top tier, but barely misses oit. Think of it like this; Hag has a number in the low 90s as her ranking IE 90 - 92, and Spirit has a number in the VERY high 80s as her number IE 89. The difference isn't massive, but it exists.
---
If anyone is interested, here is the video of this unhook and chase that followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxf6NKZWfzY
---
And yes, I am aware I wasted what felt like a dozen pallets.
---
One time ghostface one-shot me plz nerf
---
excuse u, bubba would give great hugs. plus he can cook and clean
---
LMAO this is stolen and this guy took all the credit from the original poster
---
You're amazing at copping out, so I guess if you want to do that I'll let you.
---
Not if you have unbreakable. but then if u get slugged again, especially right after using it then yeah it sucks.
---
What annoys me the most, is most people will scroll past this without looking at the SWF's perks/items and think you were some asshole killer with bad matchmaking
---
Why on ps4 tho?
---
Yeah you’re  right, it’s totally inappropriate to post about positive interactions between players of this game when theirs so much toxicity. How dare I try and bring something positive to the table. I’ll check with you next time I want to do something similar 👍🏼
---
Well that pretty much confirms it
---
That depends on skill and killer you’re running. 
---
It’s needed on more of killers who need to set something up like stalk or traps etc. 
---
Pop is a good substitute of that or you can run both Pop and Ruin. 
---
Also within those 2 minutes 1-3 survivors aren’t doing gens so it still is quite a bit of value.
---
It's all fun and game until he licks your finger.
---
Figured... But I'd argue they're still their main weapons? Not a big LF/Billy player here, but that's what I get hit with by them most. And if you'd throw me in a trial and gave me the chance to pick between a chainsaw and a hammer, I know what I'd pick
---
That post 2 the forums was made 2 days after the reddit post
---
That just would be weird to hear Myers music coming after you &amp; you turn around &amp; see it's like The Doctor or Hag lol.
