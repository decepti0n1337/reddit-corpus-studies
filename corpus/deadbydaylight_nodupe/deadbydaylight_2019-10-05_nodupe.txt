Back at it again I see.
---
---
---
But also to be fair I feel like SWF groups are also broken. They ignore half of the things that would give the killer any edge. Half of the perks you can just ignore because oh wait I can tell my friends where I am.
---

---
Killers doing something? Everybody knows. Have a plan? No you dont you're playing against a SWF group. If SWF is broken, I see the Spirit as the hotfix.
---
Yeah but we all know that doesn't do shit lol. Figured a reddit public shaming was worth doing as well üòÇ. I seriously kept thinking they were gonna get me, but nope, just kept on dodging them lol. Was a very humorous game. üëç
---
Of fucking course, it's keemstar
---
Exactly this, imagining survivors actually feeling entitled to bring an item (even an event item) but not have to experience the counterplay (Franklin's Demise) is a horrible thought.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But it'll probably happen.
---
Nothing. Just play as good as you can to rank up. You will get better Teammates and also Killers that do not camp the hook.
---
Like I said. RNG. There are a lot of survivor perks.
---
I'm embarrassed at how many times I've watched this video today. I was also singing the song at work T.T Who's afraid of a buuuuuully?
---
Learn to play better. Yes it‚Äôs something everyone hates hearing because they don‚Äôt want someone to say that or you suck. 
---
But learn how to loop and how to loop well. All you really need to know is how to loop and you can carry yourself to better ranks.
---
No? She just decided to go into a corner instead of running lmao
---
In this case I agree but let us keep something dammit!
---
They‚Äôre called splinters
---
Yup. Probably trying to hide or do a pallet slam but didn't work out.
---
Edit: I can hear the self care sound. She wasnt trying to hide but she was definitely trying to do a pallet slam and run but she didnt have a good position for it.
---
Mission ends in ten seconds
---
Five
---
Four
---
Three
---
Two
---
*You are now attacking*
---
One
---
You've failed (boos)
---
If you don't cleanse, she not nearly as good.
---
Run self care ever*
---
B, spirit is A. Plague doesn't touch her.
---
I love Trapper! Just too bad he has to run around the map picking up his own traps like a sucker. -_-
---
Exactly. DS should be deactivated if you fully heal. This still leaves some strategy to be a decoy, but it comes at the risk of being M1‚Äôed and not being able to make it to a locker to force a grab. 
---
If you have time to be healed, you are not being tunneled.
---
Well theirs still little kids here and im a bit more mature than that and i try not to waste as much time on grammer but im talking to people who still have to criticize it because they have nothing better to do but whatever i guess i give up when im talking to people without lives it is pointless to argue with them even though, and forgive me if this wasnt the original topic, but when this whole argument was based off me stating a possibility of what it couldve been, not criticism, just exclaiming how i wouldve thought it would be setup better and the fact that no one had argued that my statement was incorrect(but now that i mentioned it you probably will), tells me you guys just like trolling others because not once did you correct my statements, you just stated that what i said on how it could be, is not what it is and pretty much telling me to shut up and being elementary bullies calling me stupid for not caring about how i type but whatever, if this is how you guys get entertainment when youre not playing, so be it
---
Must be a new killer. You ALWAYS check the sides of that gate first.
---
I swear I get 2 gens done by myself just ignoring the hex before they get it. They always stop on the gen as soon as they see hex
---
You forgot the swearing and accusations of tunneling in the chat after the game.
---
[deleted]
---
Having fun in this game isnt allowed anymore. It's just become the equivalent of an online shooter where everyone fucks everything up for everyone else and then talks shit.
---
You know this exact same meme of ‚Äúsurvivors mad cuz I tunnel‚Äù has been done to death, right? And there aren‚Äôt even any creative formats it‚Äôs just this cat one which literally everyone uses on this sub
---
They should add the Samination laugh for the trapper.
---
"Step in trap, step in trap!! Hehehehe"
---
Is that supposed to be spirit? Lol.
---
Like the multiplayer map in conker's bad fur day? Fun times
---
&gt; it's because of the dedicated servers
---
Yes. It happens all the time to survivors. It's never happened to me as killer though.
---
Hmm. My local group has never had it take more than 36 hours for a reply. Though it's entirely possible there a backlog from DBW and the Dedicated Servers release, over a week still seems excessive.
---
It kind of is the equivalent of gen-rushing depending on your point of view.
---
All five gens can pop in 2 minutes (and it takes 156 seconds according to the dude who wrote up the last post to actually escape through open gates) easily, less than 2 minutes w/ toolboxes.
---
This is generally done in a fashion that makes the last three generators easier to complete.
---
So too is tunneling to make sure a survivor dies ASAP/before two minutes and make the last three survivors easier to kill, given that three survivors repairing means they escape in 156 seconds, you absolutely do need to kill one...
---
In the current balance/meta you need a survivor dead by the 60 second mark, ideally.
---
No, it happens also before dedicated servers
---
OP enjoys playing with his friends. His friends probably enjoy playing with him.
---
However, his friends do not enjoy playing against a high level spirit.
---
Not sure what you're not understanding?
---
I didn‚Äôt say the cat format was bad, it‚Äôs just every single post about ‚Äúsurvivors or killers mad I did something‚Äù uses it and it‚Äôs getting stale
---
Yeah, but the post credits cameo has nothing to do with the movie itself. Supposedly they were planning a sequel and he would team up with the girl from the remake but it never happened. So that line at the end is just a nice nod to the character.
---
I dont call it tunneling if you run into them after unhooking, happens to me all the time thats just coincidence, and if someone unhooks in my face and they dont have bt i‚Äôll definitely slug, but even if he can defend his playstyle, why would you rush your objective regardless, it‚Äôll just fuck your emblems up!
---
You'd be surprised how well that addon works on other maps. People just don't expect you to use morror myers without a lerry's offering. Yes, you suck in chases, but 0 terror radius, undetectable and wallhacks make for a deadly combo on any map
---
Try asking this guy (sorry I don't know how links work on reddit) https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddffc3/at_the_dbd_booth_at_new_york_comic_con_devs_are/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Feels bad man, but it depends what rank and server youre on but usually the place you get those type of killers is green ranks and white ranks
---
noed counters adrenaline. Survivor magically gets healed to full during chase and noed stops that if you catch them. Noed Doesn't do much against slugs that get back on their feet though. Both perks are fine.
---
;-;
---
Most maps still have enough walls to make mirror myers strong

Hey just wondering where did you get the mask? I‚Äôm thinking of making a Legion costume for Halloween and I can‚Äôt find a good mask anywhere. Also great cosplay
---
You can buy the hallowed Blight skins at any time.
---
yeah otz did it u can stalk through any glass not just that one
---
not pubg it was h1z1 tournament
---
I'm not offended, but I think I'm not as bad as every other rank 18 or 20 because I always waste killers time for like 10 minutes, so everyone does gens, I just hate being punished for being kinda bait or something, just because people are camping me so they get that sweet ass 1 kill because remaining 3 just escape
---
The way I look at it is, even if I win and get to red ranks super fast, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm rewarded extra for it. So why be a meta slave? I mess around with builds I think are interesting and play whatever killer I‚Äôm in the mood for.
---
Photo finish haha.
---
The way I see it, objectively SWF is stronger than a 4-man rando team, so the consequence of that is having matchmaking be based of the highest ranked player. Which I think is pretty fair TBH as someone who plays both sides. What **logical reason** should it be otherwise?
---
Name shaming against the sub rules
---
If you camp you are gonna loose a pip because of hook proximity and generator defense : / so it aint a win
---
inktober is just one of multiple october challenges, i prefer DRAWtober because it gives you way more time to work on each prompt which makes the workflow easier. thanks btw!
---
I chose the cat because it‚Äôs squinty. Much like me, playing killer, without my glasses. 
---
Also ‚ÄòSurvivors mad cause I tunnel‚Äô bugs me, because I‚Äôm not tunneling, it‚Äôs not an intentional thing, thus the entire point of the meme.
---
I‚Äôm just passing time at work and giggling about something that happened the other night, I ain‚Äôt claiming any groundbreaking oc, friend.
---
Tl;dr: it‚Äôs a meme. Never claimed it was original. Merry thickened fog to you.
---
Myers is definitely more of a fan favorite here, but theyre both a ton of fun to play. Myers gets to stalk everyone at once but takes longer to fill. Ghostface stalks each survivor individually and you can stop the meter at 90% and just finish it whenever you actually need them exposed. Would highly recommend both.
---
I mean it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if people didn‚Äôt unhook in front if the killer( without borrowed of course). I wish you could stop people from unhooking you. I do find it kinda unfair to punish somebody for somebody else mistake, that and avoiding BT and DS is usually why I don‚Äôt tunnel.
---
I see, thanks for the info
---
I have never hated something so well drawn before
---
Thanks I just messaged him hopefully he can tell me
---
I agree. Which is why I‚Äôm so happy when I play against Demogorgon or Michael. The standard chase music has gotten so stale and boring.
---
Some [sauce](https://youtu.be/W0w5oGVwJ_Q)  for that dry pasta.
---
I prefer Spirit, I have a hard time controlling nurse and her whimpers after using her blink give me an headache lmao. Even so, I still believe Nurse is more powerful. She does good no matter how good the survivors are and only immersion actually works against her, while Spirit may still fail if paired up against good loopers or jukers. But what do I know, I'm a filthy survivor main.
---
Also, they basically called you trash for playing the game like it is intended to? Fun bunch that one must be
---
Amazon for like 40 bucks. This is actually a really rushed cosplay, but thanks!
---
I don't directly support it but I'm not against it
---
I did the impossible
---
Area code covered up for obvious reasons.
---
Good to know! Lol. Time to edit
---
This man knows.
---
Ive. Been playing around a month on xbox and im rank 1-2 killer. I keep seeing references to lerys and the game being incredibly killer sided maps. Is this sarcasm or is there something im missing? I hate both of those maps on every killer because there is so much LOS and so many pallets. They arent as bad as hawkins but they are close enough that i dont see how the game is killer sided but hawkins isnt.
---
You god damn did
---
How long did it take? Doesn‚Äôt look that bad seems pretty ok for being rushed
---
What are you thinking? Erase the whole damn number!!
---
You got a link? Looks fab!
---
Doctor is next
---
This is really good art but i dont support the msg
---
Obviously spirit is way easier to play, imo the easiest top tier to learn and it‚Äôs not even close.  People can juke out a god spirit, But nobody can out juke a god nurse.
---
not everyone, i did this exact build today with only bbq and no one dcd in red ranks. he mightve gotten unlucky.
---
 I even got GGs at the post game chat and survivors werent toxic, probably upon seeing my build though
---
Wait I thought dedicated servers weren‚Äôt out yet?
---
That kind of hex totem cant be cleansed
---
For Grateful it should be each time you get unhooked or healed you gain a token.
---
Don't talk for me
---
Ahhh I see, much love
---
With the intent that it would be useful, but every single game gets reports that aren't accurate, so it's basically just there to make you feel better until they figure out how to improve it lol.
---
Just another sucker in The Fog
---
Hey this isn't a call, but are the servers crapped out for anyone else? Me and my 3 buddies can't get into a game :(
---
I agree. I also think it‚Äôd be nice if teammates knew you had Deliverance but that‚Äôs me. 
---
Also, let me know what you guys think... but I feel like running Head On should show your aura in lockers to teammates within a certain radius. I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôd be OP or anything and honestly might grant you one locker save a game. As killer, if I see a survivor go down suspiciously in front of a locker, I often check it anyway, and even if not, I can‚Äôt imagine a killer falling for it more than once.
---
I love devour and 1/2 times i get a 4k mori, if its clear that they wont find it i make sure to 2 hook em before we get to stabbing.
---
Funny but not in a haha way
---
I think survivor mains are more toxic because they don't really understand the problems that killers have like losing ruin in the first two seconds, and in my experience the toxicity can rub off from survivor to the killer, example the survivor runs you for 4 gens and t-bags/clicks flashlight at the pallets, you down said survivor and because of their toxicity you camp them to insure 1 kill   and thus in the survivor mains terms makes you a toxic killer that should be banned.
---
That‚Äôs interesting to hear from Yoshikage Kira.
---
Dead Hard. 
---
Whilst it is meta for a reason (can be excellent for gaining distance, repositioning yourself on a loop that the killer was gaining advantage on, avoiding hits etc) it can be so unreliable in not procing, being deceived by ping etc. So whilst 80% of the time it works perfect the other 20% gets a hook shoved in my shoulder (and the rest of the 80% of games once killers know it‚Äôs one of my tools after first chase)
---
Man this guys annoying
---
Exactly haha. Just think how often they must get "unsportsmanlike" or "griefing" reports, just because someone got outplayed lol. I'm sure they'll have a better system eventually.
---
Lmao racist friends.
---
Thats tunneling/camping. Not whats being discussed and is a bad strategy if you want to ‚Äúwin‚Äù.
---
I just want to say...I don't play this game, but I love jumping into threads for it because you guys make it sound 1000 times more complicated than the most convoluted slasher film.
---
Old Freddy = best Freddy.

Cornfield as killer on console is hell on earth.
---
Can't play with out seeing ruin mfg
---
I mean, it is possible to escape when cleansing. Very possible. The puke can be easier to dodge at times because it is about breaking line of sight. You just need to get the gens done fast.
---
Definitely not saying it is the best method though. But playing solo I have escaped against the plague a lot.
---
I mean, it is countered by just not using lockers, if like to think most red rank survivors don't use lockers anyways besides to avoid bbq.
---
Hagatha is so terrifying
---
That‚Äôs why I never let people win anymore. If people are gonna be assholes to me either way why bother. I‚Äôd prefer to get my 4K lol
---
Ok, I understand that if it really happened. Also, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking why weren‚Äôt you wearing your glasses?
---
Whoa what?
---
If anything, blame your teammates.   
---
They're the ones not providing juicier opportunities for a killer to catch than you.
---
UNHOLY
---
Then I guess i'm the exception lol. If 2 ppl dc I'll let you farm and leave, or if the last person drops their item on the ground/doesn't make me chase them when it's clear there's no point, I'll let them get the door, not hatch though.
---
Optimization was way more important than the dedicated servers meme, sadly it didnt get the attention
---
Yeah I know to hit the skill check but what button is it to hit the skill check
---
The normal skill check button I imagine
---
So you hit the skill check but nothing happened?
---
I said to one guy "thanks! I appreciate you being so cool about losing. I suppose its becuase I gave you hatch."  Even tho he totally just found it before me lol. He didnt message back tho so I guess he believed it and felt dumb
---
[removed]
---
I know bro, and if you can get the snowball rolling early you pretty much got the win but if it takes you a while to find someone or you lose pressure on them they can bounce back pretty easily. Plus if they are really altuistic and go for saves quickly they might gets the saves before my refreshes so that sucks.
---
I always read these types of posts and responses as ‚Äúi cant be bothered to play against people at my level because then i have to put in effort and id rather just stomp on easier targets‚Äù.

---
Agreed 100% Thanks for adding that!
---
I would love this game mode! I've always liked kyf because you can do whatever you want in it. And I would love to have a proper 2 killer game other than the glitch... awesome idea though! Would like to see it in game.
---
She single?
---
Do you always ignore half the post too?  They said "wait times are rough," which indicates they don't want to wait forever for a match.  In regards to the second part, you could infer that from that response.  You could also view it as this person wants to have fun and the way killers and survivors play at red ranks isn't fun for some people.
---
But I like the current plague
---
I'm glad I changed Laurie's outfit lol I'm usually in the bright blue classic one
---
Definitely my closest call yet with the timer and killer on my heels lmao
---
More like when jane lands on you
---
It's the survivor version, where it devours the killer's hope of a fun match...
---
Haha I almost forgot to clip it too
---
What editing software did you use
---
Bro... What?
---
I know Clown is part of the larger format but I find this to be so ironic. Aside from Myers who is evil incarnate Clown is possibly the most chaotic evil of the killers and would totally bring that perk.
---
Looks like Jane landed on baby Myers :(
---
When you said xbox I was like "I'm such an idiot!" But then you said  
---
&gt; Sorry for not specifying that!
---
Then I calmed down XD
---
No but I have bt 1 on my Jeff.
---
Ian doesn't finish careers, he calls out and criticizes people, people either die out some time sooner or later (Jinx, Leafy, Ricegum who is now irrelevant as Ian predicted.) or take the criticism in some form and improve (Tana and Keem kinda did that)
---
Does anyone know what show this is?
---
Just find a teammate to heal you. 
---
It takes 32 seconds to heal yourself...
---
Do it
---
xXxButtholestretcherXxX immediatly not even a second thought
---
but seriosly i would love some disconnection punshiment thats all
---
Coward, true chads will hold their insta heal with pride
---
Also fun fact, with how steve holds things, keys and firecrackers can‚Äôt be seen unless you‚Äôre paying attention when he scratches his neck during the idle animation in lobbies.
---
I'm a survivor main but just had a game as trapper (daily) where this happened, I had trapped one door before the last gen popped, got a second hook on someone, they got the other gate open and came back for him, 3 left out that gate as I came near, but last survivor got greedy and went to open the other gate with maybe 50 seconds left, got caught in the trap and died to EGC after getting out
---
I support Rin‚Äôs autonomy to dress as sexy as she wants. Just because she is reanimated, doesn‚Äôt mean slut shaming doesn‚Äôt hurt. Of all them, Rin is the only one that really shows her emotions. I respect her choice.
---
Q&amp;Q can be good as well for that, for moments when you turn a corner or something before vaulting and the killer doesn‚Äôt see the vault.
---
Really fucks with them if they don‚Äôt hear it either
---
it's because of swf the matchmaking update they did so they cant bully low rank killers anymore bu squadding with their low rank friends
---
Despite being a creature with only one instinct to kill. The demogorgon always looks ready for head pats.
---
Do you want to make your own mask? If you want to buy a finished one, look on Etsy.
---
Robot Chicken
---
Very true, he is a good boy who deserves love
---
He has wake up which is very good end game (it's saved my ass several times) his other two perks are okay but situational (vigil is nice for exhaustion perks and pharmacy guarantees a green medkit if you find a chest so that's nice) just not a lot of people play him and they typically say he's a low tier survivor
---
I‚Äôm trying to almost completely make it on my own, not a premade one.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
That‚Äôs really good.
---
I like how any challenging feat for a survivoid, instead of mounting up to the challenge, they choose their go to method: bitching on this subreddit
---
And if it takes you 16 secs (or longer) to do that and takes them 16 secs to heal you. You've achieved what exactly? They could've just stayed on the gen.
---
The lack of/extremely subtle expression on the fish makes this so good
---
Honestly I kind of do too, but she's really boring when no one cleanses and really powerful when anyone cleanses. Making each match with her feel just blah to pick and build for.
---
Shirtless Myers with this mask.
---
I like how the only way to beat this challenge is to either have friends willing to sacrifice themselves or team with the killer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Why would i unhook you? For the points brother... for the points.
---
Even if i don't have borrowed i try to guard the unhooked with my strong David body.
---
Ok. If there's a such thing as see-through paint, you can buy the chrome mask here; https://www.amazon.com/Disguise-No-Face-Chrome-Mask/dp/B007S016WQ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=chrome+mask&amp;qid=1570238225&amp;sr=8-1
---
and then paint it.
---
I'm rank 1 on killer and survivor..  oh and about that those huntress tears from your earlier post, I know you probably don't know this - but hatchets can actually be *thrown* to hit survivors from *outside melee distance*.
---
Oh God you really have thin skin if you think I'm bullying you..
---
Wow.. just wow..
---
Trapper
---
I'm more impressed you held onto an instaheal that long in a game that went that badly
---
Thanks, I doubt it‚Äôll work though sadly I‚Äôm gonna try making some sort of paper mache though I might use that as a base/mold
---
0oh man bro, can we do this tomorrow?
---
You literally made fun of me for my opinion then I replied that it shows that you have 0 experience with any other community which led me to think you're pretty young
---
You think that is bullying??? You're so delusional.. please get out from the internet and talk with a psychiatrist, you need it if you are this insecure.
---
Or you're just trying to play the victim card which is even worse..
---
*cut
---
Yes you responded with a stupid comeback I‚Äôm glad you acknowledge that. I just made it more clearer for you to see and I thought I was blind for having glasses. 
---
The whole point of never run self care actually benefits yourself and your teammates in the long run you big brained individual. 
---
Oh I‚Äôm not getting defensive it‚Äôs more like spelling something out to someone with half a functioning brain.
---
The devs intended a ‚Äúwin‚Äù to be considered pipping. That‚Äôs why the punish you for camping as well as changing the displeased entity when you get 0 kills.
---
I‚Äôm done replying to this because I have a strong feeling you‚Äôre not up to discussing balance in a formal and open-minded matter. Good day sir.
---
My friend went and met Mathiew! The photos she showed us looked so cool :D
---
"Hold on I need a weapon"
---
*picks up a downed survivor*
---
I love Scott so much
---
Doctor pressures survivors in a whole different way, pressuring them into wanting to die
---
Its funny, after every game with my mate our exhange goes like this
---
"Fuck... i only black pipped, what about you?"
---
"Hmm?"
---
"Your pips, what did you get?"
---
"Oh uh.... where are thr pips again?"
---
"! Th-"
---
"Oh oh dont worry ive got them, ummm, 3"
---
"You cant get 3, you got a black and 2 pips, you double pipped you bastard"
---
"Oh ok neat"
---
*reload a new lobby*
---
"For fucks sake your rank 4 you prick"
---
"Ok"
---
"Youve only been playing a week though"
---
"I seriously hate you"
---
*fin*
---
Lol, my man just cant rank up, not sure whayt im doing different.
---
I play on Xbox. 
---
GT: TheGConvention 
---
Needed: I'm solo right now because my friends aren't online so I guess I need 3 people. Mic please. Casual gaming. Ahhh I was red ranks for a while but I deranked solely because redranks suck but I recently said fuck it to keeping at a 16 because it's exhausting to do so lol
---
Scott is the best
---
‚ÄúHit a skillcheck for fucks sake!‚Äù
---
Idk how paper mache works but just don't use a flat piece of paper like another post I've seen a while ago.
---
Or do you?
---
Welcome to Freddy‚Äôs Fun World
---
what‚Äôs going on
---
Opened this post and literally happened. I think it‚Äôs like every 3-4 games for me. So ridiculous...
---
He has already checked his files and reinstalled dbd
---
It‚Äôs all completely down to the survivors you face but in general I‚Äôd say Billy, Michael &amp; Freddy for easiest and Plague and Nurse for hardest but I‚Äôm having trouble thinking who else, obviously it‚Äôs extremely dependant especially when playing someone like Trapper so it‚Äôs hard to say
---
Why what happens at 15s?
---
I‚Äôve felt the same, but it‚Äôs worth noting the number as well. You get 4-1 survivors per killer per game, so there‚Äôs the chance that there‚Äôs an equal amount, but you‚Äôre more likely to see toxic survivors statistically.
---
1st isn't a mentality
---
2nd pc have better performance, console don't due to the poor optimizations
---
3rd even using a controller you can change the sensitivity and have a decent one while on console 100 is the max and is pretty slow still
---
Looks like Dwight played his Reverse trap card on you!
---
I mean, she never turned into michael. She was the nurse.
---
&gt; What you‚Äôre comeback is that you think it takes 16 seconds to heal yourself with self care? What? Lol.
---
How about you read it again... because if read it right the first time you'd see my point is selfcare takes 32s period point blank.  While a teammate healing you is 16s, what if it take 16 secs (or more) to find a teammate? That's still 32s+. "lol"
---
That fact you're not even trying to understand what i'm saying, plus the fact that all you can do is say "lol" after every point makes this discussion worthless. But whatever.

bruh, i hate this fucking community, so stupid and toxic man
---
Im MoriMeDaddy when i play on PC. No killer ever leaves when they see it
---
I think this little write up was honestly just me being tired of running the same rotation of 6 perks over and over and a way to make less interesting builds more viable. Like Dark Devotion is my favorite perk, in theory, it's just kind of worthless.
---
Called me a cheater and said they were gonna put my name on blast all over the internet and to enjoy the infamy.

I was Myers with only his perks I told them to learn the game.

Do you know how dedicated servers works?

I think not if you made such post /:

Ghostface from my experience as survivor. When I play killer I usually farm with Spirit. Its just funny watching them panic
---
It's a challenge perk.. it doesn't need buffs..
---
Ive been having decent games in both killer surv. Only the trapper issue where youve just laid out a trap, walk on it and oof it catches you instantly.
---
Dang man, moms a CHAMP
---
Devour on clown is insane, he already ends chases fast but with devour he just doesn't chase. Once you mori someone they fucking panic, stop everything they're doing, and go to find devour
---
Not asking much, just dont go out of your way to make me have a bad time, i do the same.
---
Welp, when you get out of rank 15 you won't see as much
---
Can I have this template?

Congratulations, you found the new Dwight perk! Everybody laughed at Dwight for having an affinity for lockers, until he learned how to trap Killers in them.
---
Had a game as a rank 16 killer against 3 rank 1 survs and a purple I think?

Haha, it's working. I fucking hate it but can usually ignore it cuz they want to take you on a guided tour of all the loops they know of in the map.
---
lmao i have a friend who does it too, but it's just because he likes to lean back in his chair and can't reach his keyboard if he is
---
I love the sexy billy/pig
---
You have very different clown games than I do. When I play clown everyone drops the pallet slightly early and forces me to break it, then runs to the next pallet. All the gens are done before I can do much of anything. Lol
---
Bring in the clown.
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is. I can take the teabagging but when they clicky click that flashlight my eyes turn red. Lol

Ace in the hole best perk

Trapper should be able to get full bag of traps from chest.

You know it's funny. Like I *knew* that, but I didn't process it  when I wrote that comment. Oh well, r/whooosh me I guess.

I don't mind clicking, I hate being blinded every pallet though.

Sure you can, but it's petty. I can win debates with my points and nothing more. But you do you. :/

You still haven't responded to my main point and until you do, I can't take a flamboyant statement like that seriously. So i'm just gonna stop now. Have a nice day. Hope your games go well. :)

Shit, i don't know if i want to see the doctor in that outfit. But, the quality of this is impeccable so, i put my faith in you.

Unlucky

I'm purple rank in survivor but it's the same thing. Sometimes the matchmaking pairs me with lower ranks and to see a Kindred or We'll Make It Pop is refreshing. 
---
The meta perks are so damn passive.
---
Nice
---
I really like Krennic, I am glad he is a meme
---
relatable
---
Why want enemies when you have friends like this?
---
I'll keep it shortly here too..
---
The game was made p2p, now is getting transferred in a dedicated servers. Wasnt made with dedicated servers in mind, therefore more time to fix coding
---
Very nice, loved it all but perhaps cut the empty spaces between jokes out, speed it up every so slightly.
---
Still though, really liked it, good job
---
dont look down when you blink?

ARE YOU KIDDING ME THERES A DEAD BY DAYLIGHT BOOTH I AM SO MAD IM MISSING COMIC CON 
---
I hope you are having a lot of fun though!
---
Yikes! Two in one go!
---
Hex haunted ground is a perk that exposes all survivors for a while, so they can all get one hit KO
---
I think he means spamming locker to get attention then when killer comes near stay in locker and make him grab, use DS, vault back into locker, stun after DS wears off, run away. He would have to open locker if you stay in when he comes closer so a lunge wouldn't matter
---
Georgie‚Äôs folly and Franklin‚Äôs demise would make everyone with items want to die

Geez the love that went into that cake man. You‚Äôre so lucky to have a mom like that.

I've tried, looking straight up makes you not blink anywhere, and any direction you look that gives you any distance makes you jump into the basement.
---
I didnt wanna look, but dang the hatred for survivors is real lol. Ima prob delete this comment but damn, you really hate survivors (comment history). Like legitimately try both sides, Im rank 1 both, and I can tell you I dont escape more than 40% of my games as survivor, but I have never lost as a killer(3-4k every game, I let the last person get hatch usually), but again i only play spirit/nurse/freddy. Stop hating survivors lol, its really not that hard to beat them. Every move is predictable and how can you really lose as killer? Just dont tunnel/camp and you'll usually hook them all. Even if they all escape, is it really a loss though? You get the bp, you dont have to win every game champ.
---
Hex: Devour Ass
---
Those guys are both chuds but Keemstar takes the bait for being a "drama" channel.
---
Riiiight because you're clearly being civil and not hostile in the least.
---
Pretty sure you need more than 4 hooks to get a pip excluding hitting,chasing and breaking shit of course on higher ranks
---
I was gonna say, for most killers I can kinda agree, but really, controller not a disadvantage with Nurse? That's one special hell you're making for yourself there.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to grind BP after the event but streamers seem really rare in webs.  Finally got one the other day. Start up a game. This random nea and I both  agree to bring streamers. First survivor found, hooked and unhooked twice right in front of the huntress who proceeded to tunnel me. Meanwhile, the time it takes me to get hooked 3 times 0 gens done. I get around 6k before streamers.  Anyways, the rest of them get decent BPs.  A David on my team who managed to stay hidden all game got about 28k along with finding hatch.  Post game chat was ggs between those two. I was fucking hot. Anyways, que up killer after that with the intentions to play basement insidious bubba with noed. Ended up not having the heart to play like a sweat stain and let them all go. This game sometimes
---
Funny thing is, because of the end-game chat, I often feel like I'm expected to impress people as Killer too. Just not too much, then it allegedly becomes "tryhard" xD
---
You can either acknowledge that killers have priority to close the hatch and your points being clarified or
---
You can install and get out. Nobody cares if you can't press space bar. If you're so bothered by bugs and so on, there are a lot of other games out there
---
As mc cote once said, you can try civilization, it's a good game
---
wrong sub
---
I feel ya man. Its been constant games whee random survivors are just so ass. I will distract, take the hit and save them mean while i get nothing in return. Its getting frustrating
---
sUrViVoRs BaD kIlLeRs GoOd
---
Aside from the remaining film slashers like Jason, Pinhead, Harry Warden, I'd like to see Resident Evil, Silent Hill and The Evil Within show up eventually. Jill Valentine with Nemesis, James Sunderland with Pyramid Head and Sebastian Castellanos with The Keeper is the dream.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs super annoying
---
Which is great and if they had 5 people they would already be playing them seeing as it's the ONLY mode you can play as 5.
---
I'm going to go ahead and use a little common sense here though and say they probably wasn't queueing SWF with 5 people.
---
Also happened to me twice today. Used dead hard, nothing happens but I get the exhaustion for using it. Also sometimes the prompt doesn't even show up but I can still press it and get exhaustion.
---
I have a singular spooky lunchbox on my P1 Dwight and I need this event so I can finally prestige him again
---
Probalby i know that i should not run around the map as an idiot... i can fix gens without fails.. yeah im new in the game but it doesnt mean that im noob... btw then why i got experienced survivors when im killer? 
---
You should just stfu buddy ;)
---
that‚Äôs understandable, i never said time was an issue. I am fully aware coding takes time, I just explained a problem I‚Äôm having that could help with their searching for bugs and fixes. Thinking about it I should have posted this in the forums. DBD Reddit is nothing but memes and people complaining about other people complaining and telling them to ‚Äúgit gud.‚Äù instead of coming to actual resolutions. I understand there are people who abuse this when they‚Äôre just trash but trust me when I tell you I love this game and I‚Äôm just trying to help.
---
No. BP aren't that necessary for survivors since they can keep items and even bring them from trials
---
Killers spend add ons no matter what in every trial
---
That's why survivors get less. If survivors get an equal amount, nobody would bother to play killer as much. Even tho in some cases survivors get a very decent amount of it if has played very well
---
I got that too, and it was the first tome I‚Äôd ever played hag. Feels good
---
Don't, you're there to kill, not play patty cake
---
Killers like you are the best and most fun to play against! I'm a survivor main and I enjoy the game more when the killer is not spirit or nurse lol
---
You mean when it shows up white in the distance? Another teammate is working on closing it.
---
Thats what i like to do having perks on unexpected killers like haunted on myers or trapper
---
Darude - Sandstorm
---
Yeah imagine actually getting butthurt about getting looped. If you're getting looped you're being outplayed. That means you need to change the way you play. It's pretty sad most killer mains have the mentality that they are supposed to be spoonfed survivor kills.
---
This needs to be fixed yesterday, like, 2 weeks ago yesterday
---
I was called toxic for using Franklin's match started and I saw a nea I smacked her medkit out of her hand then instead of running she picks it up so by time she starts I already hit her again then she DCed and now I'm a toxic asshole apparently

Am I wrong or is a lot blurry? Especially on the face. Maybe it's just to blend the light with the rest of her body creating some sort of aura. Or just a bad decompression from the upload, anyway good job man
---
But you won't be
---
Yeah the booth is like mad screens to watch and play on. They actually made me wait in the main area for good survivors to show up (cuz rank 1 killer)
---
Well after you blink you only have to turn like 270¬∞ to see your full surroundings, controller can do that in like half a second, it's really not as slow as most people assume
---
I swear to god I see a single ‚Äúmuh legion cosplays are ez‚Äù.   I‚Äôm gonna come down there, and I‚Äôm gonna hit you with a spatula.
---
You said you have a little more than 2 hours played. Sure, you might be better than the average rank 20 potato but you're still a premium potato, and that's okay! But, maybe... just maybe, don't complain until you've played more than a session's worth of gameplay?!
---
Anyway, if you're getting "experienced" survivors as killer all the time - at your low rank - then you need to work on your own gameplay.
---
But... since when does pipping = victory or defeat?
---
There are many silly things that can ruin pips.  Or very easy things to make you pip
---
I can pip and kill no one.  I can pip and die on hook.
---
The name of the game is to kill survivors and survivors escape 
---
So if you kill 2 survivors it‚Äôs a tie game with those who escaped winning but tieing as a team.  If you kill 1 or less you lose.  And if you kill 3 or more you win 
---
At least... that makes logical sense to me 
---
So we agree to disagree on what a win is
---
Why would I say that?
---
Well a lot seems to disagree with your opinion so i guess you're inferior based on downvotes
---
Poor demogorgon being excluded :____(
---
happens to me on ps4 at least after every 2 games. have to close application and start it up again.
---
Its the bugs when playing killer that is making it suck. Blindness effect sometimes sticks so u r permanently blinded for rest of the game, michael tiering up is glitched, the music begins but then tier meter goes down a little so u have to tier up again and some times it too gets stuck and dont progress.
---
Hitting survs on palletes is impossible. Even if they r sliding towards u, the blade just goes through them doing nothing. Etc etc.
---
I was imitating your comment that was mocking me. In case you forgot the first thing you did in your comment was make fun of me for stating my opinion based on my experiences. I have plenty of experience with other communities and most of them aren't 90% hate mail and harassment at the end of every game. Last night on this very subreddit there was a video trending of someone being "sandbagged" by a fellow survivor just because they were new. So I think my point on that stands. You dismissed any possible reasoning I could've had and just made baseless derogatory claims about my age which isn't even relevant. 
---
I think harassment is bullying and an accurate description of your part in this trainwreck of a comment chain. You haven't exactly been civil, but instead hostile. Hell you're starting to hit cliche levels of it at this point. 
---
Again I was trying to get a discussion going and you attacked. This isn't about playing victim because that has nothing to do with the original point. This is completely because of you feeling the need to pick on someone for bringing up their experience as a basis for a question. By harassing me in this comment chain that doesn't help the case that the community isn't toxic. That's like saying getting shot doesn't hurt by shooting the person you're trying to convince. 
---
Now I repeat: go away. You're hostility is not welcome in this discussion. I won't humor you anymore.
---
Not you but on legion cos. A lot of assholes complain that they‚Äôre ‚Äútoo low effort‚Äù like dropping money on jeans, a leather jacket and a fixed blade knife plus making a mask is ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù
---
The amount of Billy chainsaws I've missed cos of it pisses me off
---
I didn't know this was a thing although I'm on console
---
I mean.. they are kinda close
---
Nurse is slightly better because can travel faster and have more map pressure. If the average game last more than 5 min she would've been better since many people don't play smart against these two
---
Both have a huge weakness, stealth. People usually don't play like that so makes them pretty damn strong. If everybody played with iron will and other stealthy perks both would have a pretty hard time
---
For now Nurse &gt; Spirit, but just due to game time. A Spirit would catch you but have the downside she rely on sounds, nurse not really and have a stronger map pressure. Both ignores pallets and vaults if used well
---
Even in red ranks your team would rather self heal in a corner than save you from going to second hook when the killer is clearly chasing someone else.
---

Is it for the killer only or is it for survivor and killer
---
I‚Äôm not sure about survivor but it is for sure on killer
---
Yeah agreed, it just feels like extra punishment as you can't tell you're about to make a mistake on picking up someone who you had just hooked.
---
I mean... the internet is big, sometimes this subreddit upvotes silly things and sometimes they downvote silly things. Doesn‚Äôt mean anything in particular lol 
---
I can‚Äôt change others opinions, but can only state facts based on evidence 
---
I think people only downvote anyway because they think I‚Äôm defending campers or tunnelers or something... but I‚Äôm just telling the truth 
---
A camper does not care about pips, a camper doesn‚Äôt care about points. They care about getting kills and making people salty.  And you people only feed into it more because you make posts about it and try to pretend they didn‚Äôt win... they won the minute they killed a 3rd survivor and toyed with the last.  They won the minute a post is made about them. 
---
That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm not agreeing with their tactics or not agreeing, but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen for years to be 100% accurate
---
I‚Äôll PM you the messages eventually, I‚Äôm lazy and I don‚Äôt want to draw them today lol
---
Wao... I thought my reddit is broken. I've seen this at least 5 times in the past 24 hours.

No
---
You're just so....idk what to call this..idiotic?Its just like the turtle and the hare in this case.You let your overconfidence take the best of you and let a sure kill in which you are hoping to be toxic and downing the last guy at the last moment but fucked up instead.That is a sure win for the survivor and definitely a salty moment for the killer.If the emotions of the survivor is considered to be the factor of what the killer perceive as a win then that survivor definitely won as he is probably overjoyed
---
Y'all need to get laid for real instead of making this sick shit.

You MIGHT actually get laid if you put as much effort into it as you did this drawing.

I‚Äôm not here to be negative or anything, but just know that the DbD subreddit really has a thing against legion cosplays, with the exception of suzie for some reason.
---
&gt;Thinking about it I should have posted this in the forums.
---
The official forum is full of awful mods, I won't post anything there if I was you but you do you.
---
&gt;trust me when I tell you I love this game and I‚Äôm just trying to help.
---
Isn't difficult to believe you tbh. Many people feel the same but at the same time they antagonize each other for whatever reason
---
Btw take my advice, don't go to the official forum. It's worse in every way, especially if you have a different opinion on something. Not for the users but the mods. Reddit mods at least won't shadow ban you, threaten you, block your account and make sure if you create new accounts, with 0 comments you get insta banned.
---
Many people in the forum can confirm this if you talk to them privately. At least here you can talk freely, if you want to post it somewhere, post it to the official discord
---
Wow this is great
---
Not to mention window vaults are so broken. Survivors get hit through them despite being super far away.
---
I've heard about the whole Archive thing but what is it?
---
&gt;Play how you want to play
---
&gt;Running infinite and tombstone is an asshole move
---
Bruh
---
How about since it does one health state why not have it be like it heals you 1 health state so if your in the dying state and the killer leaves you down to get a 4 k the timer still counts down then it's another counter to slugging than just unbelievable and no mither

---
Yeah, I was being too general, that my bad. Some pallets are just a joke, they shouldn‚Äôt even exist.

But some loops you‚Äôre supposed to hit the killer with the pallet then run to another loop, because forcing a break every time is super boring play for the killer.
---
DS - Decisive Strike

PGTW - Pop Goes The Weasal
---
I sincerely hope not that would be beyond lame.
---
Lmao you've blocked every single person who's called you out op. You're a dummy and a pussy both in playstyle and the real world.
---
In one match i downed a survivor in the first 30 seconds of the match and before I could pick them up they dc then I quickly find another one then down them easily as they were bad a looping then they dc as well snd then after that the other 2 DC.
---
Seriously like wtf?
---
2 minutes? No more than a minute in my case
---
I'm sad I lost my 15 Pig Splinters when I P3'd as Doctor. I already have Pig so it was a funny way to pretend you had a Mori. 
---
I still have 2 on Leatherface. I might use them since he makes piggy noises and say I identify as Pig in post-game.
---
The lession : do not tbag Spirit
---
Literally the same situation I was just in
---
I mean I was in a 3 man got hooked Across the map I see my 2 friends on a gen so I assume "okay the random is there " not even 3 seconds I see the random leaving a locker IN THE BACEMENT instead of rushing for the save I had to 4% off the hook because it was either attempt or die first hook. She then proceeded to no matter what run to a locker everytime when someone went down. I made it my goal to make sure she died because she played like an idiot because she was worried about BBQ like who cares about BBQ yeah they get slight info but if your leaving your team to die your being selfish. We all died and only gen that was done was the ones my friends were working on
---
Many times I've tried to write a coherent response only to be plagued by the devils of uncertainty. I will respond again but first a question because I am unsure, what do you mean by "Work with deliverance?" In the dev stream about the DLC, it said you'd need to wait the broken timer of Deliverance before the perk would start to work, effectively increasing the time you're broken by 30 seconds, is this not how it works? Or are you asking for it to work within the 60 seconds of Broken that Deliverance gives you? (I do not have the perk cause all of Steve's Perks are not enthralling to me and I wanted Fixated and Inner Strength, for obvious reasons).
---
This is the other part of my reply and feedback which is feel is what the perk needs to be a bit better: 
---
Losing the perk is honestly a bit shit and imo, it should work like Inner Strength. To my knowledge, Inner Strength isn't lost on being downed or grabbed out of a Locker, and if it is, this isn't stated on the Perk's card, so I think the same should be for Second Wind. Technically, if you think about it, if the killer has mangled (Which most do in the form of Sloppy Butcher or an Addon), you will take longer to even have Second Wind active, god forbid if another survivor goes for the unhook and heals too, especially solo. I guess the activate conditions were for balance reasons as if you think about it, you could theoretically have many many many times to activate the perk, while Inner Strength has 5 chances to activate *at maximum*.
---
While personally it's not really a good perk, changes may make it far stronger than it needs to be as it greatly increased survivor efficiency if used correctly, but it not being lost on down while its active would be a start.
---
Edit: As u/-Eightball- gladly pointed to me, I know which way you meant by it not working with Deliverance! To me, it working with Deliverance would be like the devs originally said in the reveal stream, however, I believe they didn't do it due to how efficient some survivor play could be, if I may, this is what would happen if it did work with Deliverance, and some consequences:
---
With Deliverance, you're broken for 60 seconds no matter what, then ideally after that you should be healed by yourself (Self Care for 32 seconds or 40 seconds with Mangled) or by another survivor/baseline medkit (16 seconds or 20 with Mangled). 
---
For the self care route, this takes you out of the game for longer than it takes for the perk to heal you. While the perk is "healing" you can be on a generator so it effectively increases your efficiency by double. Healing you and you doing a gen at the same time. That part of the perk is fine, it's a time saver and should stay as such, no timer adjustment is needed.
---
For the you being healed by a survivor/medkit, this does still improve efficiency by 50%, because that survivor who could heal you is now doing something else like cleaning a totem, doing a generator, saving another survivor if need be.
---
So while yes you are vulnerable and a one hit down for 90 seconds, those last 30 seconds of the timer you would be incredibly efficient and wouldn't need time wasting doing the healing I stated above. I guess the devs didn't do it because of that pressure efficiency issue and it would hurt killers a bit much. I'm not saying don't add it, I'm saying at least test it on the PTB and then live and see if anything comes of it.
---
In each game their are the 4 basic categories. If your not utilizing or capping out in each then you aren't setting your self to pip up.
---
Try breaking a pallet as killer, you‚Äôll notice
---
I prefer a bear trap....
---
Connection has always been shit because Australia lol
---
NOICE
---
I've literally done it as killer.
---
Basement trapper is the only way to play him imo.  I can‚Äôt enjoy him like Otz does
---
I mean that's the same thing unbreakable does to if the killer isn't near when you get off the hook he could think deliverance. But we need perks that just end the slug to win so that's why we have some perks it just doesn't cut it sometimes. I once slugged someone because he just got off hook and was an idiot to run to me without bt or ds (I mean I wouldn't know DS but he didn't have it) so I left him slugged because I felt bad. NO ONE  went to heal him at all I eventually saw him crawling so I felt bad hooked him knowing someone was right behind me and walked away because his teammates screwed him on that
---
Ugh... you don‚Äôt understand at all lol
---
And I‚Äôm an idiot? Learn to read and comprehend before replying
---
I literally spelled it out. That single survivor did ‚Äúwin‚Äù but overall the killer ‚Äúwon‚Äù. I‚Äôm not even siding with a certain side here... I‚Äôm just stating, once again... evidence to my case
---
The killer may be salty for that last person, however the salt of the 3 he camped would trump it and make him happier overall considering. Especially since he knew he ‚Äúcould‚Äù have easily killed the last survivor if he wanted but chose to goof off
---
He controlled the entire situation as he saw fit until he let them get too far. 
---
3 &gt; 1.   Basic math here... as well as emotional balance for the killer
---
Victory in this game can be different depending on who is playing.  I‚Äôm only trying to explain how the mentality of a camper/tunneling troll would be... he wouldn‚Äôt care about all of your make believe rules of winning a game.  He is laughing while you all are being salty and making excuses like ‚Äúoh! One escaped because he decided not to attack when he could have and because of 1 surviving, we won!‚Äù... not how it works
---
Sorry
---
Though, that one survivor does have a small win, but overall not
---
Are they worth cleansing?  
---
I don't play survivor very often but when I do I'd rather spend my time on a gen since it takes ages to do one portal.
---
They stop the Demogorgon from teleporting in that area you cleanse plus you get a little more blood points for cleansing
---
I get like literal 30 minute wait times on ps4 red ranks. as both a killer and survivor. 
---
And the game isn‚Äôt balanced against 4 man SWF. At red ranks that‚Äôs literally all you‚Äôll play against more often than not. Waiting 30 minutes to find a 4 man try hard SWF with voice communication to greatly shift how the game is played is not as fun as staying in purple ranks, waiting 15-25 minutes and finding more people playing solo or duo. 
---
You can read the responses people make whichever way you please.

If you really think going against 4 man SWF is considered balanced gameplay, you‚Äôre just wrong. The game was designed to be played without voice communication and having the ability to communicate vocally with your teammates greatly shifts the odds and makes the game 100% more difficult for the killers.  It‚Äôs just not fun. Simple as that. 
---
I‚Äôve been saying forever, the devs need to enable in game voice chat and balance the game around the aspect of their communication, it would make a huge difference. But right now the way things get balanced is the devs pretend there is no vocal communication even though I‚Äôve had randoms invite me to party‚Äôs on ps4 and it‚Äôs even easier to do so on PC through discord.

*Wheezing oinks of laughter*
---
No because you can choose when to pick yourself up with Unbreakable, with this perk you would be forced up due to how the perk works. It shouldn't change just because you're down, function should still be the same, healing 1 full health state that you have no control over.
---
They're farming you
---
This power would also benefit from iron maiden since Ghostface would enter lockers faster with it
---
Those bastards!
---
My internet is perfectly fine. Dedicated servers are broken
---
Sometimes they'll have things like borrowed time. Which will give you, the recently unhooked a free hit if it procs in time. Other times they may not have been paying attention or are okay with getting hooked themselves so you can get away. This of course has varying degrees of success.
---
Maybe he thought he was letting you get an exit gate daily?
---
no I'm just a grumpy old man here to grump up the place
---
Right, like Steve has that perk where when he unhooks someone theyre invincible for a few seconds right?
---
Literally any rework would be better than it is now
---
slug-downing survivors but not bothering to hook them up(usally to keep chasing nearby survivors)
---
Did you get to test out dedicated servers there?
---
That's exactly what I meant for working with Deliverance. The problem is that once you unhook yourself with deliverance and then it's timer expires Second Wind doesn't kick on. The only trigger to Second Wind starting that I've seen work is only on the unhook. Your proposed use of Deliverance with Second Wind would be fair, imo. A lot of efficiency for high risk. I'm totally down with that.
---
My main problem with the perk is that the healing charge is lost. If the only change to SW was that it wasn't lost before it was used then I'd be super happy about it. It's difficult to get in the first place.
---
Btw, good luck on all of your future matches, and try not to let the loud members of the community convince you to take this game too seriously. It'll be more fun that way. Have fun in the fog, I hope to play you some day if you're on pc!
---
looting chests should be survival
---
It‚Äôs literally how it works??? I can still see movement my dude
---
Better than the original
---
They really need to fix Nea textures
---
Great job btw
---
Thanks! Been loving this game so far, I'm on switch but I'm looking to grab a PC. (That's not a potato ) in the future And I'll definitely double dip !
---
i fear that messing with the broken effect (giving exceiptions and stuff) might break the game for shitton of bugfixes
---
Haggage
---
No, but I did find that I was missing a lot of hits I shouldnt have. Makes hag traps really easy to just run right through now =/
---
chick in the joggers couldn‚Äôt step the fuck back for a sec?
---
You were right. I got impatient and bought Shattered Bloodline. Nobody came into my room, and even if they did I don‚Äôt think anyone would‚Äôve cared. So yay me.
---
I just got booted from the last 3 games I've been in, if it was my connection,  I would have at least dc from xbox live, but it's just kicking me from games
---
Love that Youtube channel. I believe it is BRUSH. The demogorgon is so adorable!
---
If this has already been done please link me!
---
Killers too how dare you lol
---
I like to run gen protecting builds with it. So BBQ (which I switch with Discordance when not farming points) Surveillance, Surge, and Dying Light. I mainly play Pig, Freddy, Legion, and now Demogorgon.
---
We at bhvr have heard your requests for a killer that can hide in lockers. We have also heard you want a spirit change. The new and improved spirit can now phase into lockers and get stuck for the rest of the match
---
I haven't seen anything bad with the dedicated servers yet. Can some people give some bad things thats happened on the dedicated servers
---
To me it kinda looks like Jane sat on his face. But then why would he be sad, y'know?
---
My 4 that I cycle through are Legion, Pig, Freddy, and now the Demogorgon. I like gen protecting builds.
---
This. I can't tell you how many times I've whiffed my attacks due to auto aim screwing me over.
---
Most popular killers in general are 
---
Nurse (depending on platform) 
---
Billy
---
Spirit 
---
Michael 
---
I haven‚Äôt played in months but usually those are the top 3 or 4 popular and spoilers it‚Äôs mostly because those are good killers to play.
---
That's what I figured too but I mostly get Bubba's (PC, Oceania, Red Ranks) and rarely get Spirit's
---
on the other hand ive played against clown 3 times this week all games were 4ks and ended within like 10 mins. a good clown is scary
---
Don't take these into my game cause you're going to loose it. Not going to deal with insta heals anymore.
---
Nah fuck others fun.
---
There are so many details it seems Like she's playing the game üòÇ
---
Not with spirit ready to take the top spot
---
I feel like more killers would get more love if people understood that this game wasn't made with competition, and being rewarded for being the best in mind. Ranks are Arbitrary and only serve as a fake badge of how much you play this game all of the time.
---
So just like the regular mode right? lul
---
Its a shit experiment
---
Without ruin you might have gen pops before you even find anyone.
---
I'm tryin to mori the nurse üëÄ
---
It all depends, pop can be 100% better then Ruin for sure. But it all depends on how good are you at a killer and what map you are on. 
---
If you have no problem downing survivors a lot then run pop it‚Äôs great. If you are Michael, trapper or anyone that needs extra time before they can start killing then run both. 
---
But for this build it all depends really. 
---
Hex Ruin: Pro: It‚Äôs good in general especially if it lasts. 
---
Cons: Totem
---
Pop: Pro: A good perk for a good killer 
---
Cons: The game went horrible.
---
This achievement is bugged on the PS4 too, we don't have trackers like Steam but I know for a fact that I've done this thrice fold.
---
I think everyone who plays this game is a massive Piece of Shit
---
The perk we don't deserve, but the perk we need
---
Pop + surveillance is not a good combo because often the generator hits 0% and it makes surveillance useless.
---
I will directly support this
---
I'm sorry if you're such a snowflake then if you think this community is toxic. I guess you never have been in any other gaming community, I can make a list if you want but won't help much since you're so dumb.
---
It's fine to argue points you say, but in the moment I say this isn't by far toxic, not as many others, you immediately say I pull that from my ass? Wow you're so smart dude, not even hypocritical in the slightest
---
Before acting like the classic keyboard warrior, think for at least half of a second, if you're capable
---
Unless... I remind you that this exist? *wenk wonk*
---
Love your comment Karma btw 666 &lt;3
---
I do see your point. I just feel like enough people don't understand why the competitive community isn't catered to 24/7, which leads them to feel salty because they're being ignored since most complaints don't align with BHVRs vision for the game.
---
Freddy.
---
See I don‚Äôt get you guys. I used to play Killer 90 survivor 10, but after the new Ash cosmetics got leaked I‚Äôve been grinding my build for survivor and I‚Äôd say now it‚Äôs 30/70 and I‚Äôve played since release of the game and imo, Killers are way more fucking toxic. During the bloodhunt I‚Äôve been moried that weekend alone more then Jenna Jameson sucks dick. I‚Äôd be camped and tunneled every match, and that‚Äôs in Purple/green ranks, and even now my swf has to have at least two people running borrowed and everyone decisive if we even want a chance, looping just doesn‚Äôt cutting it. As Killer we have ways to combat the toxicity and more well known tactics to outplay, survivors have some counters that don‚Äôt always work depending on how reliable your stack is and the determination of the killer.
---
Survivors healing a bit too much for ya? Sloppy butcher, coulrophobia, distressing and thanatophobia. Done. They ain't healing no more
---
Git gud lol
---
Isn‚Äôt she dead? See, it just makes it better
---
I got accused of tunneling and camping because I legit kept getting lost in the Hawkins lab first day. No matter what I did I kept running into the same survivors in the same rooms.
---
A lot of new survivors or more casual players don‚Äôt know NOT to. They are usually not very patient or don‚Äôt try to be stealthy about it. :/
---
Would depend on cup size, Jane would probably win. Seriously though this have me an idea for a perk:
---
Hex: Mimic, until the totem is cleansed 2/3/4 chests are replace with a mimic. Any survivor opening a mimic is injured or put in dying state if already injured plus rooted in place for 10 seconds. Killer is given an auditory message when mimic captures a survivor.
---
*cries in 2 fps skillchecks*
---
I can see why a happy go-lucky pink gummy bear would detract you from that then. My apologies kind sir, for the post (and for the sarcasm) - grump away! From one grump to another.
---
Calm Spirit stops you from screaming, making it the ultimate doctor counter.
---
AMEN
---
I just want each killer to have a good enough power to be justified to play in higher ranks. 
---
That‚Äôs why games with multiple characters have buffs and nerfs all the time so it‚Äôs not always the same character you are seeing every game and it‚Äôs not mandatory to pick one of these. 
---
I understand wanting to cater to casual side but it hurts competitive side and humans by nature are competitive. 
---
That‚Äôs why if killers where buffed it would just be a overall better experience.
---
Me, wearing glasses anyway, but still not being able to tell the difference between any of them.
---
I never told people how to play. I guess you're having an hard time reading
---
&gt;Except nobody is on about teaching
---
Yeah like the official contest to make guides... Right...
---
&gt;they are on about playing and his friends don't like playing against killers drastically above their skill level.
---
So who's fault for that? Or you're just fine to make killer experience shit and survivors experience nicer? There's several solutions. Make a Smurf account, play custom game with people, you can gather them from the discord channel if you want. Or even here. Or even, play something else while they learn by themselves and last but not least, accept the trade. That's it.
---
&gt;
---
How about you stfu and stop telling people how to play?
---
How about using your brain? For once. I'm not telling people how to play, I'm giving suggestions to make it more pleasurable play with friends but defend an abusable system like it was before, it's laughable
---
And if you insist on unhooking them before I have a chance to leave the room don't accuse me of camping.
---
Makes sense, thanks.
---
why are u getting downvoted? you're just giving your experience?
---
I wish it fit my screen :(
---
Cute joke üòÇ
---
if you feel that way then definitely look into getting Hag and Hex: Ruin to slow down the game.
---
Huntress has to deal with pallets depending on the terrain
---
Feels blood lodge man
---
crows can help you gave a general direction for survivors or where they‚Äôre heading. see that crow flying up/away a few feet from you? there‚Äôs a survivor right by you etc. it‚Äôs much like hearing grass movement cues. You‚Äôll pick up general directions of survivors more and find more blendettes.
---
Yes dud. All the time.
---
Hold up
---
did NOT know these were a thing...
---
maybe I should actually play killers once in a while
---
I‚Äôd hit that
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say intact, he got shot 5 times and thrown from a 3 story building, and is assumed to be dead, but ok.
---
Imagine being this self-absorbed
---
I realise haha thank goodness for the speed boost
---
Who knows,
---
Thank you! Thankfully that was the slap on the ass I needed to hightail it out of there lmao
---
All you guys who used your friends low ranks to bully killers or get easy killers with way less experience than you have finally got what‚Äôs been coming to you for a long time!!
---
I‚Äôm glad they have the match making setup the way it is now, tell your friends to put on their big girl panties and start learning the game, they will get allot better quicker since you are feeding them to the wolves...
---
I don't even want to consider lmao
---
Farm maps would like a word
---
Will be like chasing the Road Runner.
---
Is that legal?
---
Oh yeah dude, there are a ton. Only downfall is you have to play the killer in vanilla style
---
Mikey boi too swole to get out of lockers or fit down hatch‚Äôs feelsbadman üò≠
---
The killer just fucking gets deleted from existence.
---
Is this real?
---
Cries in bloodlust lag being so bad on console its more detrimental then helpful.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for about 10 hours today and had no issues with the servers at all. Guess I‚Äôm lucky? Played both killer and survivor.
---
I don't know many 16 year old university students. Especially if they aren't getting a full ride for being smart enough to be a university student at 16
---
Oink üêñ
---
Yeah if the healing charge thing is changed I won't mind, the first part... Idk. The efficiency scares me because believe me at Rank 1, even with Ruin, survivors burn through them incredibly quickly, and while many don't really use Deliverance, this change might make more use it and it might be a bit of a nightmare, but again we're yet to see it in action like such.
---
If it was added, as a solo queue meta, (I believe this won't be as efficient for an SWF), Deliverance, Iron Will, Dead Hard and Second Wind might be really strong, but idk if it'd be too strong. Compared to SWF it's not strong, but it would certainly be better and closer to it, and SWF is still really bad. I'm all for trying, because a lot of this is speculative, so I'd love to see it in practice first.
---
Damn if Summit actually played DBD the population would increase so much.
---
It could be good on low terror radius builds but I personally don't find it any useful
---
Ha! Good on you. I hope you followed up and reported them.
---
Crows in the game will get started when a survivor runs by therefore in a way showing the killer a general location of them. 6ix9ine is a rapper that just snitched on a bunch of people therefore OP is saying the crows are like him.
---
&gt;Had that happen against a nurse. The dude had the nerve to say gg at the end and said that he was too good.
---
The guy that said he was too good was the one who disconnected? Did I read that right?
---
level Hag to 35 and you'll get her Ruin as a teachable
---
Definetly Legion
---
\*Oinks in approval\* Fantastic work.
---
Don't even make me laugh. I've played league of legends. I've played Dota. I've played games with toxic communities. this shit doesn't take the cake, but it's little more then a hop, a skip, and a step away. But hot damn if you aren't the most idiotic of the bunch. So far, throughout this entire asshole leakage one might call a conversation, all you've done is insult me, and act like you're better then I am, then you make a claim and have absolutely nothing to back it up. I'll admit that what I said had nothing to back it up either, but that's why it's a fucking rant thread. the fuck you expect? acknowledge that killers have priority? that's what i meant by pulling shit from your ass. in my experience, they don't. but you stomp in, and act like what you say is the be all end all, literally saying it's your way or the high way. well, fuck off. if you want to have a discussion, fine, but the only thing you've been doing here is showing off your lack of introspection or forethought. there is not a single thing you've said that wasn't hypocritical and you're calling /me/ out for that?

Pig doesn‚Äôt wear shoes anymore in order to achieve maximum sneak potential
---
You could just disable messages from random people
---
Ok thanks
---
Im on xbox and don‚Äôt experience even close to those wait time (since patch). I do know what youre saying about SWFs and balance. I completely agree that the entire scale shifts vs SWF with the game becoming way more survivor sided and downright impossible (feeling) on certain maps. But i dont see how purposely dropping rank because people play to win at red ranks improves you as a player. It also lessens the experience of players at the rank you are dropping to either by you stomping them on killer or by hard carrying them as survivor (while also stomping the killer). 
---
I dont know if you remember those situations while you were learning killer but i recently went through it. Where 2 red ranks would queue with 2 people at rank 20 and get me at rank 13ish as their killer. And of COURSE the red ranks carried the flashlights and the insta heals. If i got unlucky and found them i was guaranteed to lose a gen in the chase with no hooks to show for it. If you dont find them expect flashlight saves and pallet saves all day. It was bully city and i felt helpless. The emblem system has its flaws but when i go against people at my rank (now im rank 1-2) it always feels equal. Some rank 1s are better than me but its not overpowered. Meanwhile when i get a swf of one rank 1 and 3 rank 10-14 its incredibly noticeable. I almost always 4k. I cant imagine what its like to force myself to derank in order to face these weaker ranks on purpose. Seems like borderline cheating to me.
---
Restart steam. Heal another survivor while being injured and you should get it
---
The Dwight bleed out before he could get to the hatch. The clip of the face cam is from a different stream
---
Mind linking a video from the killer perspective, then? because that's entirely contrary to my experience.
---
make it so you dont get messages from strangers
---
Furtive Chase is extremely effective for switching targets.
---
At maximum stacks at tier 3, it reduces your radius by 16m, cutting most killers' terror radii in half.
---
I play it with Ghost Face (one of his own perks) and it synergizes with his kit quite well. I can chase and slap non-obsession targets before moving to my obsession. This will give me a little pressure before stalking, marking, and downing my obsession.
---
The perk also creates an obsession. This is useful when chasing said obsession.
---
By default, the obsession's icon has Entity... claws? around them. When in a chase, all players know that said player is in a chase. Many non SWF groups will read that information as an opportunity to commit to generators. This is your window in which you can switch targets.
---
Personally, I like to chase the obsession until I can get Bloodlust (if I can't get the down). I use the increased speed and reduced terror radius to switch to another target. While Ghost Face has the ability to reduce his terror radius to 0, I find that it is sometimes better to preserve it. The tactic also works without the power, so can be used on any killer.
---
The Obsession switching mechanic also may work in your favor. Potential synergies aside, it gives you information: which survivor made the save. If you are targetting a specific survivor, this information will let you hunt them down with more efficiency.
---
I hope this helps!
---
Plot twist: OP is the rank 20
---
Oh boy, I just took a trip over there. Jesus Christ, and I thought that WE bitched a lot!
---
eh I don't know what I was doing wrong but I got zero tokens the whole game
---
I‚Äôll always run to the killer chasing a survivor and meatsheild save them. I run of and start self care in the corner of the map.
---
My time is more useful then that but our overall objective is to get as many survs out as possible
---
Just ignore them
---
I'll still get the teabags and I don't wanna do that because I play a lot of other games as well and people send me messages asking me things and I made some good friend this way (actually met a girlfriend by doing that lol)
---
just a repeat of what everyone else has been screaming at me. and it's wrong.
---
Don't forget a "get away free card" when you're unhooked after the exit gates are powered
---
Lmaoooooo not even being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù but dude. Like close your eyes. Turn down the sensitivity
---
He pulled what some would call a Pro Dwight Move
---
Get more out of other obsession perks like remember me I think.
---
Dat thickness doing some work lol XD
---
Or gave you bloodpoints
---
I can't, I'm sensitive, can't help it. I play videogames because life isn't really great and I don't wanna get bullied in game too. It's supposed to be an escape to me haha.
---
I don't even wanna be up in green. Because I don't need that kind of toxicity in my life.
---
Edit: I'm glad you're happy though. Good luck on your journey into the red ranks part of the fog.
---
Surv-rushing
---
It was a neutral perk till Bill came out. Once Bill came out if it wasn‚Äôt in your current bloodweb, then it wouldn‚Äôt appear until you get his teachable (level bill up 35?)
---
People on r/dbdgonewild would appreciate this more for sure
---
I don't understand why OP (and you, it looks like) thinks that returning to previous matchmaking is the way to go. Not to restrict rank/skill difference between team members (like some games do), not to find some middle ground (which I believe is not possible). Just straight up "we have newbies in our team, give us a newbie killer".
---
Maybe *you* wouldn‚Äôt do that because it‚Äôs ‚Äúcruel‚Äù,  but putting this up there as if he did something wrong is weird. Idk, maybe you were trying to be funny with it - just seems odd because who‚Äôs to say who had fun and who didn‚Äôt? 
---
And what was he supposed to do? Tell them to F off for wanting to play with him? It‚Äôs not like we all don‚Äôt play over our head in competition every now and again. It‚Äôs how people get better and learn.
---
Patch notes don't mean shit with a game as buggy as this. that may be how it's intended, but that 100% is not how it ended up.
---
Usually between Legion, plague or spirit.
---
Well I don‚Äôt force myself to de rank. I just make sure I don‚Äôt double pip and sometimes I make sure I black pip so I don‚Äôt rank up to quickly. I also don‚Äôt downright stomp lobbies between rank 7-4 because more often than not I‚Äôm fooling around with very off meta perks and strange strategies. I‚Äôm not playing the game to hit rank 1 anymore. I‚Äôm playing the game to have fun. It‚Äôs hard to have fun when you queue for 30 minutes at rank 1-2. That‚Äôs my main issue here. Is wait times due to the revert they made a few months back. I can take the sweaty survivors. And I can definitely lose and have it not bother me. I grew up playing competitive sports so I am fully aware that you can‚Äôt win them all. 
---
But dude. Ps4 wait times are MURDER at low ranks when you can only play during specific times due to work and kids.  I refuse to hit rank 1 anymore. It‚Äôs just not worth the time I‚Äôll waste waiting for a game.
---
I have a six- pack after watching this.
---
Unbreakable. A lot of times if there‚Äôs two people left, a killer will slug someone and then go for the last person. Occasionally I have been the 1st one downed, so I can escape while they chase the second person.
---
Not getting points here. Sadness.
---
 *What are you even talking about dude, he wants to just play with his friends. What official contest, Are you lost? Forgot where you are posting?*

Maybe you're the one who's blind
---
*It doesn't need to be so extreme. I'm a R7 killer, I get red ranks in my game anyway, I don't mind having SWF in my game.*
---
*If I queue surv with friends, We ALWAYS get a red rank killer.*

So? I don't see the problem there

*This "solution" just goes against the entire point of the change.*

&gt;*play custom game with people, you can gather them from the discord channel if you want.*

*Goodluck with that without bloodpoints.*
---
&gt;*How about using your brain? For once.*
---
*This hurts to read.*
---
Yeah, I know you can't read, don't make it obvious. It's not the point, the point is teach them the basic of looping and introduce them to the game appropriately and then go to normal matches. Maybe I have to make a picture for you..
---
*Never defended the system before actually, Just agreed that this one is not ideal.*
---
*Anyway, I'm done reading your bullshit. Peace!*
---
Thank you, Never reply again if you won't use your brain. Thanks.
---
Why do so many players tea bag? It actually make me feel bad for playing as killer when I find a game
---
Then turn off comments. Youre a good killer main by not tunneling and being an all around good sport. You cant please everyone. I appreciate you for playing fairly but dont let people hiding behind a screen manipulate u like this :) these people hit send; and its over and to the next match
---
&gt; Don't be fucking stupid, the game is clearly balanced around 4v1, not 1v1.
---
Game is __clearly__ balanced around "novices+veterans" teams.
---
this was very helpful my dude thanks
---
From how big of a fool you‚Äôve made yourself, no, I don‚Äôt think you do.
---
Absolutely, but I never expect that to do anything lol
---
Saving this thread to paste on every thread named "fix hitboxes" from now on.
---
Didn't Sally murder a bunch of people?  
---
  
---
I feel like sexual assault is a pretty minor thing to deal with after that...  
---
Also, she's been on /r/dbdgonewild .  
---
She has seen WAY worse shit...
---
It‚Äôs ok to not want to put up with it. The worst part of the internet is that people can just by anonymous assholes when if they said half what they do in real life they‚Äôd get the shit kicked out of them for doing it.
---
I love Summit, but the majority of his chatroom (and by extension his viewers) can be REALLY shitty.  
---
I can't imagine the wave of toxicity that washes over the game if he plays it.
---
I agree
---
That's not a portal. 
---
It's a fucking butthole.
---
Did you post this on google because I found the same on posted 14 hours ago
---
When does the event start?
---
Why would it be?
---
So people talking about what they‚Äôd do to your mom and how gay you are is less of an issue than teabagging and ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù? I am confusion. 
---
Also, not to fear. Easy to find an address with an IP address, anyone can do it. There are YouTube videos of people doing it (on COD, no less) to scare people. Sans the death threats, just the address thing.
---
admittedly I was sweaty until I reached rank 1, but now I‚Äôm rank 7 and only using fun builds! I throw pebbles at my teammates to get them killed and I just giggle and don‚Äôt even feel bad. I usually won‚Äôt do that to the newer guys, but if they‚Äôre in the purple/red ranks I like to do it to give them more chase practice ;)
---
One of the most if not most broken killers in the game with a no counter add on?
---
I had a general knowledge of that hitboxes were never broken and it was pretty much always latency. I've said it on here, said it to friends, said it in game to fellow survivors and killers. 0 belief. I really hope this gets to the top of this subreddit. Thank you. I love you.
---
This is now saved and will be pasted onto every hitbox thread I see. Perfect work.
---
I don't think that would work either. Green rank killer would still destroy OP's "can't hit skillchecks" friends. 
---
As I've said, I don't believe there's a way to provide fun game for all 5 players, when proper r20 players team up with proper r1 ones.

Never felt more scared in my life. My heart was about to burst out of my chest.
---
It's not just about the content of the hate it's about the ratio. 
---
In COD I got maybe 30% of toxicity. In DBD it's 80%
---
And even speaking about the content, COD is childish, insulting mother and things like that. DBD is really nasty, I mean I never got an actual death threat on COD

They should get rid of post game chat altogether,  the majority of chat is just talking shit awyway. Keep the report buttons, just have a thumb up, thumb down,  or meh button.

It‚Äôs not the game. It‚Äôs the visual distro. He needs to re install Visual C++ and it should fix it. That error‚Äôs common with a lot of games.

At this point the only thing i can hope is that you're a troll. do you even know what contradiction is? This is just laughable. I never said i pulled shit out of my ass. I just said i didn't bring any proof to the table. bashing me for being in the league community, entirely ignoring what i'm actually saying. i never said that DBD was worse then LoL. I agree. LoL is as much satan's asscrack as this is his cumstained shorts. neither are exactly pleasant, but i know which one I prefer. half the shit you said didn't even make sense. 
---
Plus my claim at the start was you have priority to close the hatch, it's been proven several times. Your proofs that's not the case? Where are them?
---
come the fuck on. if you say it's been proven, then show me. i personally have no proof for my side, but that's enough for me, provided the lack of an alternative that's believable.
---
Definitely I don‚Äôt even play anymore but ik that‚Äôs stupid
---
And that's how you get tunneled and camped
---
Anyone on psn wanna SWF? I'm rank 15 but mostly because I've spent way more of my time watching dbd streamers than actually playing lol, prefer to be over 18 and have a mic

Fr though, great cosplay.
---
gg ez is IMO way way worse than "fuck your mother". The later is funny because it's so childish and overused, the first one is a direct insult at your performance in the game. In COD you're 6vs6 so even if you loose it's not personnal, in DBD you're the only one in your team as a killer so insults against the loosing side are way more personal than in a shooter.

Question. I see a NOED there, and I kinda sorta get it that it's a toxic perk to use. But as a rank 16 nurse/huntress/spirit main, am I a bastard to use it on the nurse?
---
Yeah I know a lot of games I can play but I really, really love this game, I discovered it in June and played hours of it everyday since then. I'd say it's one of my favorite so I'm really sad to see such a playerbase.
---
Excuse me, I'm a Demo main and I shred pallets like toilet paper in a public restroom
---
I got booted LOADS on the first day - mostly when playing Freddy and setting traps. Surprisingly, my Legion games were actually fine.

Teabag = immediate 3rd hook no slugs
---
It‚Äôs just a common thing for toxic people. There are people who say gg even if they lose but it‚Äôs less common. These are the people you want to play with imo. People who can actually set their ego aside and look at what the game was objectively and say ‚Äúwoah even though I died that was fun‚Äù. But there are a lot of gamers that really judge their game or worth on how well they did in a game. Like it‚Äôs some genuine IQ test. Lmao. There are way too many of these people. Idk it they think they‚Äôre gonna be a streamer or a contender one day but the reach people put into self worth and how well they did in a video game is beyond my comprehension.
---
Camping absolutely is not toxic if the game has gone horribly for them and they are BARELY able to scrounge up what kill they can. 100% support it, even when I've been on the receiving end
---
something from several months ago. Nice. definitive proof.
---
Oh shit theres nea the real killer, the killers should run maybe theill get moried
---
i also have to face camp and almost exclusively play leather face or billy
---
Ever since I left the basement you

go back to r/narutofanfiction

I like to facecamp tunnel too its really fun and interactive for everybody!

I took a random one.. you can use Google a d YouTube don't you?..

Maybe not.

no...I‚Äôm so bad I literally HAVE to do all of that just to get a single hook a game ngl bro‚Äôs
---
&gt; tell your friends to put on their big girl panties and start learning the game
---
I mean if we're going with this stance, why couldn't newbie killers just "Put their big girl panties on and start learning the game."
---
Killer &gt; Surv in the newbie games.

üòÇ

Alright bro, gonna chalk this one up to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand people nowadays‚Äù. Hope you find a game that has a nicer community that you enjoy.
---
üòÇüê∑many happy oinks.  And thank you
---
When one too many pallets got dropped on Micheal.
---
Not really. The scream event or something like that shows up if you shock someone and I don't think a perk that just counters 2 killers is really that useful.
---
Somebody who teached me alot is Fungoose (on twitch) maybe you should watch his vods he plays alot of different killers and he plays LF and Billy too =)
---
What you just described literally helps the killer. You can simply work on a gen in that situation, putting a ton of pressure for the killer to go up against
---
Time to uninstall the game
---
Crows can also snitch on killers
---
Nah cas the survivor I save is almost always better then my potato butt
---
Not as good as the make up sex we‚Äôre having tomorrow night? Right ?
---
I go around telling it like it is, and some people don't like that, so I get a lot of downvotes on this sub. Some people actually go on my profile and down everything they see. No biggie though. :)
---
I can never find a game :(
---
Do not use Stridor. It‚Äôs better to learn how to play Spirit normally instead of relying on it. 
---
There are a lot of ‚Äòmindgames‚Äô you can do with spirit, for example, standing still and pretending your phasing, pretending to vault a window when you‚Äôre not, etc. Survivors can‚Äôt differentiate between a phasing spirit and a regular spirit, (unless they‚Äôre using Spine Chill) so keep that in mind. 
---
Also, get good headphones if you haven‚Äôt already.
---
There are a lot of good guides for spirit. Ones I recommend are PainReliever and DamnNotHTML.
---
Already better than most of her addons :D  
---
~~keep nerfing pig bhvr she likes it :,)~~

Tru3ta1ent . One of the best killers in DBd. Learned so much from him and he‚Äôs a fog whisperer.
---
Ah yes I see
---
Yes, but only have a decent amount of levels into Bubba, Huntress, Doc, Nurse. 5 into Demo but I don't play him. There's a couple perks I want from most killers that are teachables, like the pigs Make your Choice and demogorgons Surge, and especially bubba q and chili. 
---
Mind if I ask why do you ask?
---
What about Herobrine ?
---
I'm just sitting here chuckling at "Blendette".
---
Lmao, maybe
---
New copypasta?
---
I've been asking for Harry Warden for months and every chapter he doesn't get added makes me lose hope. He would fit perfectly in the game  I don't get how they haven't added him yet
---
Haha what‚Äôs that?
---
Out of all the posts, across all of the subreddits, this is my favorite one. Well done!
---
The Dark Lord shall rise again!
---
I've also heard of it called the "P3 Claud Squad", which is another good one.
---
Might be because he's a lesser known slasher
---
r/copypasta
---
Same except I see a lot of "look at this escape I did" that everyone knows how to do nowadays.
---
Well after getting the nightmare leveled up, there are many different end game builds for each killer built around his blood warden, remember me and fired up. Almost all of them that I have seen are more effective with noed vs without it. So you don‚Äôt need to worry too much about using noed
---
I mean so is saw considering when the franchise was made and how bad the sequels got plus Amanda was easily forgettable imo so I mean why not add a arguably equally popular slasher to the game plus does it really matter if he's lesser known? He still looks badass.
---
Absolutely agree. I didn't even know we switched to dedicated. It was so seamless, until a friend pointed out I had a ping bar as killer. Then I realized I've not only played the whole day on 50ms but I also haven't noticed any hiccups and poor gameplay glitches. I played vs multiple Huntresses and everything went as expected.
---
Things are going really well.
---
Yeah, I'm all for it. I was just saying since he is less known then saw that's probably why the DBD team hasn't looked at him. Or maybe they have and are planning something in the future perhaps
---

Their default kit is bad, but they can destroy with the right addons
---
You're not allowed to criticize the game here, obviously. If you didn't have someone defending you then your comment would have been buried in downvotes by now.
---
ok so you want your farming perk that also is one of the best information givers in the game to be even better because you're too incompetent to realize "oh hey i only see 2 auras that means someone is nearby!", and you think the only form of counterplay besides b lining to where you're hooking is also unacceptable
---
did i miss anything
---
Yea just pray they‚Äôre in a good spot
---
Yes, Gerald from Core-A Gaming did make the original image. I never claimed that it was mine, and the fact I wrote over it with paint pretty clearly shows that.
---
I do not feel at a disadvantage using a controller or M&amp;K as survivor, its really just my preference to use a controller. 
---
My skill as a survivor is not hampered or affected by what the killer is using, bc unlike other games we aren't on a level playing field in the first place.
---
I think I only got a few more grey hairs haha
---
Susie look depressed
---
Ikr like why would you add that if I have the character
---
I enjoy them as well. Same shit for me previously with ping issues, now it‚Äôs always been green ping. Haven‚Äôt had problems playing as killer either
---
Cleansing is just a very very bad idea. All she needs to do is find you, and if she's clever shell spray her purge in the sky and you'll be dead in seconds. No time for loops or timewasting. Cleanse if everyone else does, and maybe at the end of the game. It's just not a good idea to cleanse. But you can easily escape against a Plague if you play your cards right
---
Always the worst when there right there next to you and you're just like "please don't see me, please don't see me, please don't see me" haha
---
https://redd.it/ddj6nv
---
They just need time for the reasons explained in this post
---
Nobody seems to really mention her but hag. I like her a lot cause she feels more strategic of a killer. You have to rely on traps in order to catch survivors as she‚Äôs too slow for normal chases. Strong, fun, and she scares the shit out of people (myself included). I‚Äôm also trying to learn Huntress as a secondary main
---
I made that :( cause survivors think we're evil when we're just real people having a gaming experience like em
---
What's the problem? Nurse mains on pc are already destroying survivors on pc.
---
Thanks English isn‚Äôt my first language
---
Exactly, thank you. Two DCed off the bat, and the other kept running up to me and pointing at hooks, essentially asking to die. Decided to give the last one the hatch and they act like I'm evil or something
---
It depends on how many times you don‚Äôt get the great skill check.  If you miss, what, 4?  Or so, gen tapping is actually faster.
---
this is me every game
---
Nooooo, Michael want to kill himself
---
Hey look another survivor coming to help me with this gen!
---
This sounds all funny and games at first, but then you won't have a red stain, unless they make it come out your ass.
---
Everyone should just solo 1 gen before they even look for ruin.  If more survivors did this in solo queue and used their brains, ruin would be an almost pointless perk.
---
I can finally hit my Ruin skillchecks feelsgoodman
---
Bonus feature. All killers are in their periods. Even the Male ones
---
‚ÄúJahar, can I tell you something in confidence right now? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IkTZ8BVAlFE ‚Äú
---
My point was that there is a significant difference between m+kb and controller, and my example was playing nurse. I can also bring 360s onto the equation.
---
Haaay that's fat myers don't booli him
---
Question! Why deer stalker?
---
Best Naruto character ever from the Evil NUn Ninja Clan.
---
Also you're never going to learn how to hit greats if you always gen tap.
---
Just add +10%/+15% faster pallet break when in tier 3
---
Because I don‚Äôt have anything better to replace it yet. Wanting to get M&amp;A
---
You're welcome and I really wish that survivors can see we're real people have feelings and emotions too
---
Not even gunna try and grab her foot? That‚Äôs ice cold...
---
Agreed. I‚Äôm rank 1 too and usually killers are better than that. An average survivor can loop a killer pallet to pallet for a long time gotta know when to leave as hard as it is.
---
Just leaving upvote number 69. Have a good day, bud!
---
Lmao, took me a second.
---
And then everyone clapped.
---
Ah ok just making sure! Well have a great game! And don‚Äôt let the salt get you down!

Its called ToTH

ghostface 
---
I understand his mechanics. I also understand myers but pick ghostface over myers
---
Goddamn. I saw the post and thought "Yeah, custom chase music is cool." But that's way better than I thought it would be. I need this in the game.
---
I too want to see more rage footage from whomever this device killing psycho is... He should embrace The Entity‚Äôs teachings and finally start torturing people he captures on Twitch. I‚Äôm just saying Netflix would send him money if he could do it in 8 episodes.
---
I have a question, does it stop screaming from the plague perk? which name i forgot
---
It took me a good while to figure out the distance needed to use this perk. (Once the requirements were met) I'd jump out and the killer was either too far, or would intercept me mid jump and just pull me out of the locker. But tonight I had a lot of fun with this perk, to the point where the killer kept getting anxious to check lockers he thought I was in. It was great!
---
I know they want to tour me around but I swear I keep following them and gens keep finishing but I catch them and camp. Why? Play the video!!!
---
Nice job!
---
Me (Killer) : Hex gone, Huntress Lullaby gone, Devour hope gone, Noed gone. Ehh...
---
Me (Survivor) : WHERE THE FUCK IS THE RUIN, SEXYCATERPILLER69?!

Oh my fucking god.
---
Love the Spirit skin. Shame the big smile removes her usual vivid emotions.
---
F12 is an amazing mechanic
---
Keemstar doesn‚Äôt get enough hate** fixed it for u
---
Because you dont have it anymore
---
For sec I almost thought I was on r/dbdgonewild
---
So would they like, give out bp to people who have the perk after it's removed? Why not just rework them. Eg. After finishing a gen or after a gen is finished gain haste for x seconds and endurance for x seconds
---
Edit: rephrased a sentence
---
They should have went to different  rooms
---
So our only way to live is the 4% chance huh? :c

The nerve. /s
---
Well once you get better playing spirit/nurse you won't need em since the match ends before all gens get fixed.
---
(But if you see 4 survivors with 4 toolboxes grab it, they want to genrush)
---
üòÇüëç
---
Hated that bug. Had a few times I went back to save a teammate only to be impaled when the timer still had a decent chunk.
---
Every time I play a killer I haven't used since I first started, I forget I have noed and I feel bad until I see how toxic the survivors are
---
Played against a Freddy today who was my personal hero in regards to this. Got hooked twice. Both times that I was unhooked it was when he was already barrelling back towards the hook on the tail of the survivor "rescuing" me. But both times he chose to go after the other survivor instead of immediately downing me, which he easily could have, and would not have been wrong to do so.
---
How can you not love winning just by big graining the fuck out of people. Its great

You should. Its people like you who still die from pig's traps when trying to go through the exit.
---
Thats so annoying. Im so far from the killer and do a fast vault yet I still get hit.
---
Squadettes*
---
I know this but it isn't as impossible as it is made out
---
Yes it was, but we didn't know that it would give everyone 200 ping at all times
---
Can I come out of the locker now?
---
Bruh i don't even know how people consider slasher flicks scary movies.
---
They're not scary and they really don't even try to be.
---
If anything, they're horror-inspired action movies lmao
---
I would consider saw to be a psychological horror / gore movie
---
Before today, i had only heard of Harry Warden once and it was probably somewhere on this sub asking for him to be a killer.
---
All in all though, he looks cool so I hope you do get your wish of him getting added to the game
---
Pick spirit &gt; roll face over keyboard &gt; succes.
---
Seriously it's the most overpowered easy to play killer in the game, there's nothing these people can tell you.
---
That's like saying "this is what you get for winning the tour de france, runner-up will just be better by using steroids, moral of the story, don't win tour de frances am I right? Checkmate toxic swf." Fuck off.
---
Lovely
---
"2 minutes into the game" You lucky dog. The last 4 games I've played, they've been cleared within 15 - 25 seconds because they spawned right ontop of the totem.
---
I've  played on it a couple times both as a killer and a survivor. As a survivor  it is difficult  for me to find generators/ remember  where goes where. As a killer I don't think I've had a problem  with the people  not utilising  the whole map.

Not really but it happens, at certain hours it‚Äôs easier to get a SWF in the lobby than 4 solo survivors and things like this happen because of it. What time do you usually play?

&gt; Repost
---
&gt; Yes I deserve it for trying to loop
---
What do you mean? Should survivors just run in a straight line or throw down every pallet they come across immediately? Hello? :D
---
So far the only weirdness I've seen was some dirty hitboxes on huntress, some rubberbanding when I tried to break pallets, and being able to stand inside survivors.

Well, I suppose the pig needed a buff anyway.

Looping is actually a part of the game. I know it makes the killer look goofy, but it's what the survivors must do to survive. Ever heard of King Zheng? Real person, actually fucking looped an assassin around a pillar and survived because of it.
---
You should Activate Windows
---
Welp, for the reasons I explained it's not surprising.
---
They'll fix it and the testing is part of it
---
Yeah, this is within normal matchmaking range. There was a section about it in the latest [developer update.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019#latest)
---
Specifically, this part: "If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank." So you could find survivors up to rank 2, and down to rank 14 in an attempt just to get you into a match.

I think this is great. Makes sense IT would try to feed on their fears and make em more tastier because of it (i had the same idea in my head). idk about the balloons though, but its still a cool concept.
---
Are PTB‚Äòs these killer packs or is it something else? And thanks for the advice.
---
As a shape main this hits to close to home
---
Forgot to mention: base movement speed would be 110% and base heartbeat would be 32meters. So at 1 survivor in panicked you'd be 115% and with 3 you'd have a 24meter heartbeat.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
Damn. Your idea for the shape is perfect! Pretty much every idea of yours would glorious in the game.
---
I upvoted everything recent to counterbalance.
---
Wait, I had this bug way before dedicated servers, could there be another reason?
---
Weird, i always get the opposite, i have team mates who will destroy a lit totem either before we even start on gens to see if its ruin, or after we know ruin was destroyed. Threres no need to cleanse totems in either situation, wait for ruin and then cleanse it, OR if you already cleansed ruin wait to see if he gets affects of anything like Devour Hope. Kind of risky but like, better than giving free insta downs straight away.
---
Diversion should be buffed to work similar to how firecrackers work actually

Hell yeah I'm gonna play as nea.

You‚Äôre adorable and I dig the hat!

(It can be weirdly hard to find single colored sweaters!)

The devs are too lazy to fix or even mention it in the hot fix post. I really hate the way they deal with the bugs.

it's hot but it's also necrophilia

fuck

These are what you call "I had a bad day, let me vent" add-ons.

Yeah except it's not a joke and you rejects actually think like this. I'm also not mad I just think you're a moron, there's a difference.
---
Actually what i went up against yesterday during solo queue, alongside Devour Hope, NoED, Ruin and Iron Maiden. Absolutely terrifying, but it was a 2k match with me getting a random rank 12 Nea out with me.
---
Oh I guess I didnt't catch that part, thanks for enlightening
---
We need killer emotes. I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
---
Imagine a killer pointing at a gen, and giving a thumbs up.
---
Imagine getting to dance on the last survivor on the hook.
---
Imagine the wraith actually taking his bell, and swinging it like a cowbell in front of a survivor. BING BONG BING BONG BING BONG
---
lol ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Am I missing some sarcasm because killers do this all the time, sometimes I don't want to bother running around looking for survivors so I close the hatch and watch them open the gate and let them go.
---
But that heartbeat thing wouldn‚Äôt make sense as the survivors gain fear while in the terror radius so if it‚Äôs smaller than your power would become less useful right?
---
Gas ü§î
---
I played for quite a long time as survivor before trying killer out, and it only took three games to get the blink distances right. I've played about 20 games as her without coming close to losing one (always 2 gens+) - I felt playing trapper required more thought by me, as walking somewhere stupid takes up time and I can't just blink all around the map if i know the current area i'm in has no survivors

That... is a good point! Though it allows you to sneak up easier for hits, I think that a larger heartbeat would be more appropriate for mechanics/flavor instead
---
Where's the funny
---
Clown, spirit are the killer's getting some. Tbh I don't know who else is getting some
---
Just use a headset you won't need much else.
---
I legit thought that guy behind legion was supposed to be boba Fett! ü§£
---
Spirit: "lol, k"
---
Clown, spirit, hag, plague, jake
---
Plague, hag, jake
---
Didn't see the leaked banner yet? Spirit, Clown, Hag &amp; Plague, and Jake.
---
Is Jake the only survivor getting one?
---
Yes
---
I get 55-60 steady
---
Damm, they brought a lot of batteries this trial
---

This is amazing

Here is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddd9i9/halloween_costumes_video_render/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) of a video made to show who is getting a skin
---
I hate Diversion.¬† Killer just looks at noise notification then looks goes back to facecamping.
---
Huh?
---
I don't hate NOED and I don't hate adrenaline. I play both sides and, yes they can be strong, but yes they can be useless too. You can destroy NOED before it's activated, so why nerf? It's not like you need a perk to counter something, it's just cleansing. And Adrenaline is nice, and if the whole team is injured and then it pops, I'm very mad. But you have to pop first all 5 gens, so it's kinda okay. Maybe nerf adrenalin a little bit, but in what way that it doesn't become useless?
---
NOED can be nerfed too, like it become a normal hex that burns from the beginning on. But I'm not a fan of both nerfs
---
how do you sneak up on survivors during a chase
---
borrowed time..
---
The savior o:
---
Same 60-70ping better than the 100-110 best ping or average of 140-200
---
This template is cute af
---
Could be somwhat tied to you or the survivors rank. Someone who has a higher rank, has typically played more, and is more familiar with ruin spawns. That, and RNG can just give you the middle finger
---
Level 50!
---
PTB= Player test build. It‚Äôs where you can try out new patches early to find bugs/ test new content pre-release.
---
You get like 270 per lvl before that
---
The best 2 tips I can give you would be; while phased, don't just rely on sounds or scratch marks. On maps with grass, especially tall grass, you can actually see it move when a survivor walks/runs over it.
---
The other tip is that you can still block survivors while phased, which is very helpful when a survivor is successfully looping you.
---
Thanks again.
---
If I am about to unhook my teammate and hear the killer coming over, I'll run into them to make them hit me. Either they now chase me, or at least I gave my teammate a bit more time. Sometimes, the best opportunity you'll get is that one(Because they might be too close to second stage or just dying on hook). The very least I can do is try to make it easier on them
---
Got the original?
---
Yikes. The projection is real.
---
God dammit, now I want this.
---
To my knowledge, it's not that popular though so I doubt BHVR would try for it. It would be wicked though.
---
Hmm. fair, but doesn't adrenaline heal you? by that same sort of logic, that could mean helping you when you lose as well. after all, if you get hooked, you're a third of the way to losing, assuming you have a good team/don't get facecamped. each injury is 1/9 of the way to losing, isn't it? assuming you only get healed one time after getting unhooked, which is frankly a big assumption. but anyways! they both, at the end of the game, help a losing player turn things around. on one end, adrenaline stops a survivor from hitting the ground, which would result in a loss most likely, at that point in the game. on the other hand, NOED immediately puts survivors on the ground. both perks save a player when they would otherwise die, right? this is all besides the short speedbuff of adrenaline, which i think is perfectly fine.
---
I have never found myself hating something this wrong so little
---
"once" You're making a lot of assumptions.
---
Okay, so I have to get to level 34 or something to get a character. Is there profile prestige in this game?
---
As a myers main i have never seen something so relatable
---
Yes it's called a devotion lvl
---
Had a mirror myers in one of the corn maps. He ragequit after two gens popped and nobody had been downed because everyone just ran in a straight line away from him as soon as they saw him. Even if he got a hit in, they could just run around the entire map by the time he'd catch up to them, drop a single pallet and repeat
---
For fucking real. The sooner they fix that shit, the sooner I can relearn the timing on Great checks, since right now I just go by feel of "a little earlier than it looks like it should be"
---
Cause it was a Freddy who ignores your BT timer
---
Salty downvoter found.
---
Nah the wraith emote we need is [this](https://youtu.be/TklM2-lSby4)
---
They shouldn't have tested them on live servers, just run another ptb.
---
Console/Pc crossplay is an awful idea. Console killers would get stomped by pc survivors and vice-versa.
---
At first I thought I was just tripping balls ü§£. And yeah it seems like something is off with the hitboxes too? Hopefully the next update won't fuck out shit up üò´
---
I had one game where I almost bled out as second to last surv so the doc picked me up and chased the other guy around with me on his shoulder, that's how bad he wanted the 4k.
---
I wiggled out numerous times but he always chased me down and took me back near her.
---
Eventually I got free and he got her down and then just chased me down after but it took a looooooong time since I went down and considered the game pretty much over.
---
Tbf the upstairs is quite small and only contains one gen and one chest
---
*Sad Demogorgon Noises*
---
Post about the hit boxes forthcoming...
---
I can't get below 100 ping. Without dedicated, I usually get like 40-70 ping steady, and now it's just 150-200 unstable ping
---
Love this idea oml, the alliance sounds like the most fun. Perk designs are cool, all perks sound decently balanced, killer concept is interesting. Hope this gets upvoted, but I don‚Äôt know if many people know about Marianne rip
---
Clown gas with pinky add-on?
---
Thanks! I think a lot of the model rendering is buried in the code already within the map themes, so it shouldn't really be that hard to set up.
---
Ye, it's kind of a meme
---
Okay fuck all killermains, fuck especially the ones who go on reddit and/or dbdforums. And last but not least fuck you for your dumbfuck excuse to play spirit "I lost once because I suck now it's time for me to bring out the overpoweredness". Yeah sure you can go overpowered because you're a sore fucking loser but at least realize that's the case, you're a sore loser, a whiny child who after they lose they have to do anythign to win because reeeeeee losing sucks. That's what you are, has nothing to do with survivors dunking on you because you're shit at the game.
---
Get the hell outta here man. As if you get any pussy compared to the rest of us. Saying that instantly makes you void of being better than us and I can put my money where my mouth is and say many people would agree with me.  
---
Go fuck yourself. Cause clearly nobody will anyway
---
Currently using up some of those cause I want to prestige her.
---
Its quite boring tho... games end way too fast :/ 
---
(Plus matchmaking is broken af and I get potato survivors all the time)
---
Damn, solid concept! The only real issues I have is you basically have to work your way up to a standard M1 killer as far as at least the first survivor goes, maybe something should be different there? I also think it would be really hard to properly code the last ability without it being jank as fuck in this game, it's a cool idea though! I like the idea of the terror radius changing, maybe have an add-on that flips it on it's head and makes the radius bigger while changing the final stage of the power too! I feel he might struggle in the chase, I could be wrong though.
---
Can I make a complaint?
---
Context: He got downed and hooked, however he glitched out and got into his perspective. We couldn't unhook him or anything. Clown started spazzing out trying to get out of it, but it wouldn't work
---
Demonic possession is literally discordance and Nurse's calling put together
---
Yea,but Gates were open and I had no chance of killing anyone apart from dweet,so while I went towards the gate to check on meg I turned and found her going for dweet,so I just waited and got her.
---
Dweet had been tunnelled near the end because Ash escaped me by a millimetre and its was a daily.
---
No idea why you feel the need to copy and paste the exact same comment multiple times in the same thread, but I'll bite anyway.
---
Some people have complained about shitty hitboxes (especially huntress, but this is an issue that they already mentioned would be difficult to fix), lag and other bullshit. Others have seen a noticeable decrease in ping, and experienced none of the downsides mentioned above.
---
You can't just jump in and go "you're wrong because I said so", people have differing experiences. Has the game improved? Maybe. Has the game worsened? Also maybe. There's no definitive answer. But it is a ship in motion, bhvr will hopefully optimise servers and improve performance. Dedicated servers are a big step forward regardless. 
---
And no one said anything about matchmaking, so that's completely irrelevant.
---
You deserve all of the platinums man
---
Can confirm. This game was hilarious. I was there. Clown hooked "schrodinger's survivor" and he was neither dead nor alive. LUL The clown was busted too apparently.
---
And then Barack Obama called my phone and told me that he wanted me to run for president of the world for 2020
---
gah. i'm sick of you people. have fun later when you prove yourself wrong ingame.
---
Maybe the server is just a mile away from your home?
---
Well, if im not playing nurse, spirit or billy (on console) then i feel mostly powerless. Most killers are M1 and have little to no map pressure or even ways to help speed chases up (and clowns doesnt really help too much without addons). 
---
In games as killer, i feel as if i have no time in order to do my job, so tunneling (when it saves time) is a decent way to slow the game down. Most people have DS so when i just leave them on the ground, it almost always makes it so 2 or more survivors are off of gens which is helpful for me. 
---
you say that tunneling is the killers fault. that‚Äôs almost true. You see, as a killer, im not supposed to play nice, so if i play in a way that gives me extra pressure or advantages, then im doing it (this excludes shit like 5 blinks or Prayer Beads + Mother Daughter Ring). (sure you can if you want but that just means you are more likely to lose since you are wasting an opportunity to get a survivor downed). the time that i dont agree with tunneling is when it doesnt actually save you time. 
---
Lets just say that the Nea who just got unhooked has run away and is in the distance but Dwight, who saved her, is right in front of you; thats when its stupid to tunnel. If it was the other way around then its a smart to tunnel.
---
I dont agree with camping however, doesnt help anyone.
---
Sorta like a thrown firecracker.. i like the idea, since the 3 second or so blind could prove useful when used correctly
---
Something tells me this survivor runs Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Dead Hard/Balanced Landing and calls them balanced perks
---
Oh I'm about to make my bedroom into a Haunted Ground and exact my Spirts Fury
---
Yea, I did that 2 times yesterday. Maybe in 3 years I'll get proven wrong
---
Why are you here then?
---
They showed us a little bit on the [anniversary stream](https://youtu.be/JyWcUp8RcSE?t=3315). Something with new challenges and rewards like character backstories. We will find out more during PTB
---
Blood warden with Infectious fright and whispers is daddy
---
Ps4?
---
&gt; they will tunnel the guy that farmed me
---
The things I read on this sub are wild. Words mean absolutely nothing here
---
Spooktober intensifies
---
Well, I'm devotion lvl 1 and level 35 or something like that, and I've unlocked 3 killers and I'm in the middle of unlocking another. The greedy thing I think it's the cost of skins (21,000), but it's ok, I don't care.
---
I changed the exposed to have a maximum of 60 seconds.
---
The issue with the hindered effect is I don't want it to be too powerful because the Perk can be combined with things like make your choice.
---
Sofa Killers who can get across the map really quickly this could be really annoying for the survivor but I bumped it up to 10 seconds if that doesn't seem like it's going to be too overpowered
---
XB1
---
I like the way Tru3 puts it ‚Äî DS guarantees you get at least 2 chases.
---
I won't as long you hang out with it
---
DC bans should be as follows, 5 minutes then every time after that in a given day should add 5 more minutes, so the second time would be 10 min and so on. If you really had to leave, then that 5 minutes won't mean anything to you.
---
Damn. I want both that jacket and those boots.
---
Great Cosplay! :)
---
So eager to admit what a moron you are rofl. Fine, you win, you were being sincere and those were actually your honest to god low IQ thoughts that you wrote out, even too low IQ to understand that being a troll would've been the better of the two options. Good luck with that.
---
But hey I'm a "troll" though so who's the real loser here am I right?
---
I have no idea why you're so mad, but at the same time it is very entertaining.
---
Just because we know what perks are the best doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre killer mains we just acknowledge the fact that perk variety is good and you don‚Äôt need to use ‚Äú3 out of 5 good perks‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre such a hypocrite you hate ‚Äúoverpowered‚Äù stuff for killer but complain when ‚Äúoverpowered‚Äù stuff is mentioned against survivor.
---
Anyway go back to your butt hurt life if all you‚Äôre going to do is attack people on this sub.
---
BNP?
---
Start now and get him to prestige 3, then you'll never have to worry
---
Lets just say that the Nea who just got unhooked has run away and is in the distance but Dwight, who saved her, is right in front of you; thats when its stupid to tunnel since going for nea would make it so you have to catch up to her and then down her. If it was the other way around then its a smart to tunnel since you‚Äôd theoretically take less time to down dwight. 
---
I feel that if you be stupid and tunnel then its idiotic and pointless. If you be smart and tunnel then it just means you like winning.
---

Well yeah, basically nobody likes OP shit. Disconnecting is unacceptable either way, but going against addons like this is a guranteed failure, so why even bother?
---
Wait guys, you are getting dedicated servers?
---
6/10 not a ranked match
---
Basically you want to remove any counterplay to bbq except distortion which is pretty bad anyway.

Just became rank 15 and the quality of solo queue teammates trippled. Of course some people leave but trying to be a good sport except third hook while gate opens sorry byeee..
---
You must be fun at parties

I still have nightmares.

Dedis working well.  All as intended

You should probably go out and meat people. This, game ain't doing you any favours.

Not for console peasants though.

I am ^o^ I just gave a rating.

Well done, I have no clue how you made the hex icons and all that but I love the effort

The Wraith's would have walls made out of old scrap metal and car parrs, but it would all be beautifully and intricately painted over with his tribal symbols (like the ones that make up his add-ons). In a corner he has paints, mostly soot and the white paint he adorns his face (and occasionally his cloak) with, but with a few containers holding blood and some faintly glowing iridescent liquid (used for his blood and spirit add-ons respectively). From the ceiling a few makeshift wind chimes (made out of car parts) hang, clattering gently as they sway to the rhythm of the Entity's murmuring.
---
Incorrect, my people are in the basement

Matchmaking takes a little while but apart from that it runs smoothly

So, this is what happens when I'm looping Bubba for 3 minutes when the game starts.

---
what is sever?
---
What a work of art my dude
---
I think you mean server everytime you wrote sever. Am I right?
---
I'll just usually down and leave them on the floor so I know they won't immediately hop on a gen and fuck me for being nice.
---
Oh yes that would be cool
---
Great job man ü§™ü¶µüèªüí•üêì......ü•ö
---
Pig S++ Tier change my mind
---
Don‚Äôt just go across the map; instead, search for gens that you know will be relatively close together. You can also monitor your teammates to see if they‚Äôre about to set up a 3-gen and act accordingly. If it‚Äôs that much of a problem, you can also run Deja Vu or a green map.
---
Yeah same, im a pretty casual player, so although i kill 2 or more survivors in 98% of my games i still rarely make it to single digit ranks. I feel pretty bad for the people that just want to play a relaxed game only to be bullied by my freddy/spirit/hag with purple addons and perfect perks that I can throw around like candy.
---
Spin the wheel of misery to uncover the fate of you and your teammates.
---
It's basically what I've wanted them to rework it into the entire time. Rather than punish M1 killers, punish killers who are bringing add ons and perks to gain a significant advantage in cutting down chases, whether it be exposed or one hit hatchets etc.
---
The only people who would suffer would be Billy, who's strong enough, Michael who arguably would be ok, and Bubba who's getting a look at soon anyway.
---
I also included the broken aspect so it is less ground gained by one hit downs, rather than ground gained by survivors adding to the total hits to down.
---
That hint of eyeball amplifies the creepiness.
---
Needs more infectious fright
---
Checked and boi its another old footage! Look at ds, its active from the start of the match.
---
Glad to know you're not trying to make any constructive argument whatsoever. Good day.
---
The Holy Spirit
---
0/10 there is no black smoke on the sides
---
(/s this is fucking amazing 10/10)
---
This actually looks really fun, might be hard to pull off at higher ranks though. Would love to see a streamer try it out
---
if they add emotes like that they'll turn their game into just another meme. Killers dancing or doing other silly stuff doesnt fit with the theme
---
Check their perks, if they're using monitor &amp;I abuse or shadowborn. If they're not using a perk that increases fov it's probably stretched res.
---
Which icon pack are you using?
---
Yeah that does make sense wish I didn't have to babysit though. Aslong as it gets me the escape Thanks man.
---
Can you stop proposing absurd ideas? Your previous posts were about op perks or dumb as this.. please stop
---
Leave
---
Pallet breaking and gen kicking seems laggy sometimes, also Huntress ofc is quite odd, I'm consistently getting hits that shouldn't have hit, but I guess it's just a little lag. Anyway hatchets are laggy but as bad as in the PTB. From the other hand Plague's vomit seems fine now.  
---
And I agree, Nurse is really inconsistent.
---
But I love having 50 ping every game.
---
The only thing you have to worry about at higher ranks is getting to EW 3 before more than 3 gens are done.
---
Then you've a 50 meter TR in addition to Unnerving and Overcharge. This renders your gen-zoning absolutely disgusting. In addition you're perma EW 3, which increases your default pressure output by a long-shot.
---
But yeah, when you're facing the rusher squad 9000 with 2k hours and toolboxes each, you'll still have a hard time.
---
BUT, if Ruin doesn't get found until you're EW 3, even the really good Survivors will struggle, thanks the additional Unnerving and OC.
---
Isn‚Äôt the Trapper already supposed to be a miner?
---
Correction  
---
Using franklins demise is a dick move
---
Can they revert this because it was brighter on lower graphics
---
I mean.. I don't see much hate against the ent-Nea, maybe someone just got a hate boner against no0b3 that uses her, that's it
---
Well, the devs I spoke to say the next balance patch is working on a few killers, including legion. Sooo, we'll see what we get
---
Snitches get their jaw bashed in with a hammer.
---
If you mean quality, it's prolly cuz they're all fan made. If you mean design, I think that's the point
---
Ooof yeah ok I get that, I've done a similar thing with Nurse on the Game before. Nurse's Calling, Distressing, Sloppy and Caulro.
---
It's so damn disgusting because Selfcare takes a total of 96 seconds. Which is absolutely insane.
---
(20 sec heal default x2 (SC) = 40 x2 (Caulro) = 80 + 4 (Sloppy) x4 (SC and Caulro) = 96 seconds.
---
Atleast that's...My common sense. Might've miscalculated that.
---
Kinda sad that some people still think that SC is "OP" when you could just go for Pharmacy, a Med-Kit or a Med-Kit and Botany, and waste so much damn less time.
---
&gt; if your so ignorant 
---
Survivors will gen rush.  Killers will tunnel.  They are both effective strategies.
---
I'm afraid she will get diabetes so why you in love with that?
---
That sound actually great.
---
No.
---
If no aura is been revealed it means they are A in a locker B behind a gen C close to the hook D using distortion (unlikely but possible)
---
You can play around these scenarios. Bbq and chili doesn't need this buff. The only silly thing was about the lockers but they are fine now that survivors can't see auras through them anymore
---
They dont, my games as a survivor/killer has improved a lot, less queue times also, there is less lag difference between killer and survivor, you dont have to pray that the killer/survivor is near to you to have a decent game.
---
Brand new part
---
Clown, sadly.
---
Woah! Those are two games I'm mostly playing.
---
What‚Äôs it like having no taste.

Pretty much XD

I saw that yesterday and that was literally ridiculous to watch
---

---
Played against this with a red mori and all 4 of us got away, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt play killer again if i was that person.
---
That's the fun about it after all haha
---
He's making sure no 1 steals and of his merch
---
Troll
---
It does show a niche (in my experience) but frankly disgusting side of the DBD community
---
Yeah I know that Ruin becomes less impactful the better the Survivors are. I wasn't sure about Ruin myself to be honest, thought about replacing it with something like Mindbreaker or Bloodhound.
---
Astonishingly, Ruin is in that case the weak limb of the build haha.
---
The thing is I don't struggle with tracking or spotting at all. My chases are pretty good aswell (with 2k hours it'd be kinda sad if that wouldn't be the case).
---
So I don't have to rely on said Perks as much as other players.
---
Survivors still wouldn‚Äôt run it because they don‚Äôt get insta healed and Monto/Noob didn‚Äôt tell them to.
---
*love it
---
Optimization patch was supposed to come out a year ago? Where is it now? Are they too busy working on shitty cosmetics? What benefits do you get from sucking their dick?
---
Double woah! Same here
---
Wraith is good at low levels.  You are semi invisible and have no terror radius when cloaked.  You can sneak up on low rank survivors.
---
Trapper is solid.  Go to the shack and trap outside the window and the door with the pallet.  If you place it right, it‚Äôs really hard to see(half on the wood floor half on the dirt/grass).  Trapping shack will almost certainly catch someone.
---
Billy is great at all levels.  You don‚Äôt even need to chainsaw people.  You can use the chainsaw to get across the map quickly and then M1/right trigger them.
---
I‚Äôd avoid nurse/hag/spirit/huntress for a bit.  They‚Äôre great but take time to learn.
---
I have never prestiged a killer or survivor. The grind is already intense in this game so why triple it? I guess some people are either completionists or just love those bloody cosmetics.
---
I agree if survivors survive, they win
---
Consider red paintbrush over swing chains. Less action speed penalty but making survivors want to wake up when the game starts and denying them the ability to do so with failed skillchecks will slow down the game more overall. Corrupt intervention could help you build Sloppy/Thana/DL stacks early on, maybe take it as an alternative to ruin.
---
This build looks like a meme but 4 game slow-down perks with Freddy‚Äôs addons is going to give you infinitely more time to accomplish your objective, especially vs. SWF teams at red ranks. Hope you‚Äôre good at finding people with no tracking perks, otherwise you may struggle to build momentum when it‚Äôs most important.
---
Yeah haha but to be fair the old Freddy was also much more obnoxious thanks to his stupid aura reading.
---
I'm really happy with the Dying Light rework tho, I like the snowbally and less tunnel/mori oriented aspects.
---
Devs said all charcters are adults
---
This. Sprint Burst had a cooldown xD
---
As you learn to play, people will insult the heavens out of you. They will also try to get you angry mid match to trick you into going after a specific survivor from time to time.
---
Think as you chase, search, and hook players ‚Äúhmm, what will this survivor do? What will his buds do? What can I do to take advantage of their ideas?‚Äù
---
Also, some tips
---
If a survivor, injured or not, is unhooking a survivor or doing a generator, and they won‚Äôt run away if you‚Äôre running towards them, tap, don‚Äôt hold, the attack button behind them to lift them up without having to injure them. Most survivors who get paired with rookie killers don‚Äôt expect them to know this, take advantage of their underestimating you. If they are injured you can lift them from window and pallet vaults doing the same input.

If a survivor has a flashlight and you down someone near them, DONT LIFT THE SURVIVOR YOU DOWNED! Chances are that mongrel of a survivor with the flashlight is gonna run in, blind you with the flashlight as you pick the survivor up, and free their buddy from your grasp, putting them into injured state instead of downed state and they can escape! Also, survivors try to do this when you break pallets some times. Most important detail to remember is that when you pick a survivor up and no flashers are nearby but decide to b-line their way to you, don‚Äôt blindly look at them so they can flash you, look away instead before it blinds you!
---
When carrying a survivor you can still attack survivors. Heheheh... so many survivors expect rookie killers not to know this, so give them a whack if they try to block you from a hook!
---
Thanks! :)
---
I redesigned the wolf with photoshop and printed it on transfer paper. If you need tips, just text me :)
---
I believe the word you're looking for is... THICC
---
I‚Äôd be against that because it would kind of ruin the atmosphere and make it just another multiplayer game with silly dances and emotes.
---
Thank you I couldn't figure out why he insta died :p
---
Dedicated Servers = Nurse Nerf  
---
You all asked for it.
---
It...Sounds kinda cocky, don't get me wrong. But to be honest, I don't struggle with chasing/tracking at all. If I want to be lazy and shut down my head (playing more spontaneously), I go for Bloodhound because it might be conditional but is still one of the most powerful tracking perks.
---
Thought more about some utillity to save some time overall. Mindbreaker for example sounded interesting but I don't like the inconsistency behind it.
---
Seeing as you're obviously a troll, and a shit one at that, it's a nobrainer that you'd be getting downvoted.  
---
As for whether or not I'm salty, well, no, I'm not. If anything I'm just worried about your obviously unstable state of mind.  
---
Go see a therapist. Being this angry about video games isn't healthy.
---
You have to have the mori tho
---
Mori dailies are kind of BS, honestly.
---
‚Äúmake a survivor de-pip and we‚Äôll reward you lmao‚Äù
---
Was it the new or old Dying Light tho?
---
To be honest I love the new Dying Light. It just feels so much better and in the end also more satisfying, as you know that every single hook makes it even more annoying for the Survivors haha.
---
Good, because complainting isn't allowed.
---
Last time I was on a team where a survivor said ‚Äúgg ez noob‚Äù towards the killer at the end of the game, that survivor was clearly the worst on the team. It was weird.
---
Boop the snoot :)
---
Yeah the Paintbrush was my 2nd option, seemed extremely appealing aswell. For the very same reasons you just mentioned ofcourse.
---
And yeah, Ruin is kind of overkill on this one I suppose, might replace with Corrupt Intervention to have an easier time building up my shizzle.
---
Thanks for the advice fella, much obliged &lt;3
---
And to be honest, chases and tracking were never a issue I had, so I prefer to use my perk-slots to balance out other, more impactful weaknesses.
---
We found Otzdarva's reddit account
---
I know this is an old post, but you're the one that flairs OP perk ideas as "suggestions" instead of shitposts. That's called hypocrisy.
---
New dying light. Old one + green mori was strong but I felt like a dick running it. The last time I used the old one though I had an OoO nea so I felt less bad. I prefer the new one yeah.
---
I think that with everyone asking for it, it would be a great troll by the devs to give shirtless Myers, but it can only be used with this mask.
---
*asserts dominance by spinning towards them*
---
perhaps instead of letting us pick for killer it would just force you on the best ping sever no matter what
---
I got a green mori so i think i'll be fine
---
Not really you can barely see the trap
---
Devour Hope or Rancor work well too.
---
It‚Äôs perfect!
---
Please make a post like this NSFW, jesus christ.
---
This game could really use a little levity. I would love killer emotes. We don't need a ton of big emotes, but some basic point/wave functions could really help.
---
What does the purple one do?
---
I fucking told you so. People were treating dedicated servers as some sort of holy grail of bug fixes. They were wrong but didn‚Äòt want to hear it.
---
This is actually a really good idea, the only downside is it‚Äôs pretty useless against swf as they‚Äôll always know who‚Äôs in the dark realm.
---
Been playing for about three weeks now. Here's the strategy I wish I'd used starting out:
---
You get a lot of bloodpoints upfront for doing the tutorial. Resist the urge to use them right away! First play every available killer once. Even if you decide to main survivor, it will help a lot if you have a general idea of how killers play. Then do a few matches as survivors. 
---
Once you've tried out a variety of playstyles, pick the character you liked best and get them all the way to at least level 15. This will open up all four perk slots, so you'll be playing with a full deck, so to speak. Focus on that character exclusively for about a dozen matches or so, then decide if you want to commit to levelling that character long-term or if you want to level someone else to 15 and swap out. 
---
Early on, you'll want to focus on collecting teachable versions of your favorite perks, so once a character reaches level 30/35/40 (depending on which of the perks you want) you'll probably want to start putting your bloodpoints into the next character you want to unlock perks for. You can still keep using your higher-level character to farm bloodpoints, though!
---
I remember playing against ochido fan boys back when old ds was a thing what a joke they were nice to see they are not a lot of them
---
Didn't Truetalent make a video with one hatchet no perks and everyone just kept disconnecting?
---
I don‚Äôt DC but I will definitely hook suicide if it‚Äôs the very beginning of the match and the killer predicts everything I do so perfectly he‚Äôs got god telling him what to do next, I ain‚Äôt gonna stay when that shit happens.
---
And others were unironically saying it was OK to sexualize a fictitious male, but not a fictitious female. Relax.
---
Edit: what is a headass?
---
My potions would kill you, traveler. You cannot handle my potions.
---
Jane is beautiful facially and body wise I hope she gets more outfits. I was shook when I bought her because in game she is way thiCCEr then I was expecting I can‚Äôt hide all that ass behind one tree
---
When it‚Äôs a survivor it‚Äôs always the one that did the worst like pls stop you‚Äôre embarrassing yourself üò≠
---
If you like the game and plan on playing a while, Hags Hex: Ruin and leatherfaces Barbeque and Chili teachable perks are the two perks you want on all killers.  Ruin slows the game down and BBQ essentially helps you earn Bloodpoints twice as fast.
---
Her power is... let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm not a fan and it seems boring and weak to me. 10m
---
That smile reminds me of the movie truth or dare lmao
---
They also said everyone is over 21, to make censors happy, Laurie is not 21 neither are Nancy and Steve, they have say it.
---
Agreed. Personally I don't like the bloody cosmetics on most characters. But hey something for everyone, right?
---
I dont get why people say they suck. Do far I'm having a really good experience with them except for the huntress hatches that are a little more broken, but it was expected
---
That looks awesome! Great work!
---
R/DBDgonewild
---
Yea, but you still have to have those.
---
The reward is so high because those are the only rituals that can‚Äôt be done with the base kit
---
There‚Äôs three others it‚Äôs fine
---
The Misshaped returns
---
As a killer main I gotta say
---
If you don‚Äôt loop me, You ain‚Äôt playing the game right and handicapping yourself! Let loose! Start looping!
---
Knife squad! And Leatherface
---
Just insidious (for no borrowed) face camp with bubba with a fully charged chainsaw. Nobody will even try getting him.
---
You mean Nancy right? ü§£ü§£
---
The problem is mostly the material, this one wrap the face and it looks like a basketball, i guess using cardboard or paper shall looks better
---
He‚Äôs broken at the moment, not as I‚Äôm overpowered but he doesn‚Äôt work right. You have to be very specific with HOW you look at him instead of, you know, just looking at him, because the devs are morons.
---
That's the whole point of a TRAP,as the killer you can see the aura,if it was too visible survivors can easily avoid it.
---
You‚Äôre 100% bullied at work/school/home. Youre blowing up at people on the internet and trying to look tough to compensate. I‚Äôd suggest looking inward and asking yourself why you feel the need to hide behind a screen and talk big. Is it because you‚Äôre happy with life and have a great career? Or is it because you‚Äôre subconsciously yearning for some form of respect?
---
Either that, or you‚Äôre so angry for no reason and thats just who you are. 
---
Both are equally pitiful. I sincerely feel bad for you. Hang in there kiddo, all storms will pass.
---
Looks cool! :)
---
But why u‚Äòr not wearing shoes? ü§î
---
*Cries in pig*. I used my only yellow mori two nights ago and the last survivor was a blendette.
---
I love when someone tells that I tunnel... But I'm just passing by and meet te same guy I hooked previously, sorry I'm not about to ignlre your presence
---
I get Laurie, Steve, and Nancy because they are from established series, but Spirit is an original killer, so if the devs say that she is 21, no point arguing with those who made her.
---
Use pop and infectious fright instead of overcharge and distressing.
---
I get that you are going for ‚Äúimpossible skill-check‚Äù build, but, after all, it is not that effective.
---
I get accused of camping and tunneling a lot when I play spirit even though I can be pretty much anywhere on the map in seconds when I want to be due to her high mobility, plus I usually have an add on buffing it.
---
And one time a guy accused me of tunneling when I *wouldn't* tunnel him because he was the most experienced on the team and was obviously trying to bait me into chasing, I'd always disengage in favor of a different noise I hear.
---
Where did I say they shouldnt test it big brain?
---
Zoom in on the right Claudette's face. Wtf is up with her nose. It looks like it's melting.
---
Was that movie any good? I always see it but can‚Äôt tell if it the usual low budget horror
---
This is my response to angry survivors pissed at me for my perk choice;
---
Long as you don‚Äôt insult my perks of choice I won‚Äôt bring up your pain in the ass double standards.
---
No fun involved with this build, you just slow the game to a stupid level
---
Tunneling helps with gen rushing but ok
---
Was he using a rabbit addon tho? That will reduse it to basically 0
---
Fucking devs tbh.
---
Who says you have to make them de pip?     
---
The daily doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúMori a survivor the second they get off a hook.‚Äù You can easily ride out the match and do it on their death hook or something (which is better not only for them but also the killer so you‚Äôre not penalized as much.)
---
I enjoy using the occasional Mori and love getting moried.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time it happened.  All I wish is that I‚Äôd know ahead of time so I can get the popcorn ready.
---
If you‚Äôre playing Hag and not eating my guts, I hate you.
---
teabagging is only as disrespectful as you let it be
---
ive had people spam teabag me at gate and have great manners after game. It's just a meme. They're crouching repeatedly, not attacking your character.
---
Or just gg. Or nothing at all if the game wasn‚Äôt actually good.
---
Nope, I make sure to check afterwards - he just had brown add-ons. And even then, I don't think it would be reduced that much
---
That‚Äôs a load
---
**and it‚Äôs not a laundry load**
---
10m radius without add ons. That would easily cover most jungle gyms, significant areas around generators, the entire shack, most of a house on Haddonfield.
---
It's also potentially 6 at once, they couldn't be much larger or the power may as well just be "doesn't have a terror radius."
---
I wonder if this was the reason all three of my teammates dcd on me during a match yesterday...didn't look at what the killer was using
---
It's hard to call the killer a face camper, if you've only been booked for 0.00001 seconds... Just saying.
---
Wrong. Maybe Ruin is not as devastating against good survivors, but it is still strong. But it is OP against bad survivor, 
---
Let‚Äôs assume that survivors land 100% great skill checks. Ruin converts all great to good. 
---
Thus, regardless, their repairing speed will be much lower, or they have to look for it, which also stalls the game.
---
Halo Killing Spree Voiceover Intensifies
---
r/okbuddytrapper
---
Fucking love that video
---
Bruh it‚Äôs a joke take as it is. Just saying.
---
works at green ranks, sure
---
This one is latex and rubber. I didn't take the time to try and shape it better, but I see your point
---
This is exactly how one of my matches went, but I was the Claud.
---
Agreed, but early on it can feel like everyone is taking shots at you, best to let most of the toxicity of the community slide off your back.
---
Hard to take it as a joke, when you've been that hooked survivor, getting unhooked, AS the killer turns away from hooking you...
---
Don't listen to the ones that tell you to play Trapper, you will get bullied hard. Try Wraith, it's good at any rank
---
Unexpected kinks other people have I‚Äôll take for 200.
---
I guess it‚Äôs not fair if you assume survivors are all fucking idiots too dumb to be wary of grass against the Trapper
---
But anyway yeah let‚Äôs do it your way. Let‚Äôs have the traps floating on top of the grass so the delicate little survivors will always see them and be able to do their gens and leave
---
At red ranks? Impossible.
---
A blendette? Then it wasn't wasted, even if you didn't have the daily.
---
Lmao
---
Cutscenes for licensed killers are nto gonna be as interesting as OG ones, we already know the story. I want Plague and Clown cutscenes so bad.
---
Basically he‚Äôs using your post as a copy paste post for meme reasons.
---
Spirit
---
Is that the danganronpa bear lmao
---
You sound like you‚Äôre surprised.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna bother to explain to you what a joke is. Have a nice day!
---
I never found her.
---
Legion cutscenes would be great too.
---
The entity got tired of the key plays.
---
If you antagonize the poor fella to let you play it I would suggest you try to buy it yourself on the same console/pc he has, this way you can not only play together but you don‚Äôt need his device to play it.
---
I read the other comments before making this one.
---
Recently saw a video of someone playing no perk only iri huntress (no other addons, so they had 1 iri) and everyone disconnected immediately in 2 separate games. Like iri is all you need to make people dc aparently.
---
Please for the love of God no.
---
If ps4 players have to start facing PC players I will most likely stop playing the game. They have an advantage in literally everything and there is no good reason to want to cross play.
---
Well I never met one or even watched more than a stream or two. But the community does nothing but bash them, so I just figured
---
Same watched my bro play it. He brought his pc over one time and let me try it...I've been hooked (pun intended?) ever since...especially when the Saw chapter came out!
---
Yes monto and other youtubers
---
League of legends, rainbow six siege, overwatch all give the same currency rewards regardless of the mode you‚Äôre playing. The rewards you earn in those games from ranked are portraits or charms with your end of season ranked placement. I haven‚Äôt played any game that gives less ‚Äúpoints‚Äù because you don‚Äôt want to play ranked.
---
The incentive for a ranked mode is the ranking, something to show for a player‚Äôs competitiveness. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair nor can I think of an example of a game that punishes people for not wanting to feel the perceived pressure of ranked mode.
---
Fair enough
---
I ain‚Äôt judging based on perks, partner.
---
ok. this image is cursed
---
Really? Interested to show me a clip? Im interested in how itd look
---
This is why I'm a Pig main, the ability to oink at people is really a great asset.
---
Fair enough, there are definitely killers who take that into consideration when bringing a mori; however, plenty, if not the majority, of players would rather get the daily over with quickly by killing the first mori-able survivor they see, even if the killer avoids tunneling off hook. It seems like a bit of an oversight to add a daily which asks the player to go out of their way to (potentially) kill another player early, considering most other dailies reward the successful use of powers or completing main objectives.
---
There‚Äôs always the option to use a cypress mori as well, but most are obviously going to prefer an ivory/ebony.
---
Me and my wife have withdrawals when we're busy for the weekend and unable to play. Right now our floor is being redone in our house, so no consoles and PCs are plugged in, and we're so excited to be able to play again come tomorrow night. Those who survive together, thrive together!
---
It would have. In T2 you have 16m terror radius. The rabbit reduces it by 8m. That leaves your terror radius at 8m. Monitor and abuse T1 reduces by another 6m leaving you at 2m. If he had monitor T3 then thats another 8m reduction bringing him to exactly 0m terror radius while in T2 and not in chase.
---
But if he didnt have the rabbit I have no idea what happened to cause that
---
Oh look an old format literally anyone who knows how memes work doesn‚Äôt use anymore!
---
So you a bitch, that‚Äôs basically what I‚Äôm reading... you think there nothing you can improve or do better if he hooks you at the beginning he‚Äôs hacking and it‚Äôs imposible to win... lame
---
4 LEGS GD 2 LEGS BAD
---
Dedicated means bhvr would host the game on their servers for a more reliable connection for all parties, and non dedicated is based on the killers connection alone since they are the host
---
Gives you 2 extra hatchets
---
Yeah, I personally never get mad being mori‚Äôd because using a mori and killing them on death hook is my guilty pleasure. Can definitely understand why a survivor main would be upset with it though.
---
‚ÄúOh boy, can‚Äôt wait for the killer to pick me up so I can DS him!‚Äù
---
**DECISIVE STRIKE THIS, *WHORE***
---
The scream event does not show up if they're running calm spirit. I also definitely didn't claim it was useful. Some people like it, but I, for example, would never run it.
---
Triple woah!!
---
What's with these super high resolution DbD screenshot in Reddit
---
No i meant the BP thing at the side of the screen.
---
Oh I'm sorry friend :(
---
[Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAYoznKPlNg)
---
That is valid, but as I mentioned in my other comment, if the doctor is shocking you, he pretty much is guaranteed to know where you are.
---
Thicc is just a nicer word for fat people so they don't go cry in a corner bc they're too damn lazy to get off their ass.
---
expect nothing from blumhouse
---
movie was a complete disaster
---
they have a few gems, like HDD2U but thats because it tricks you into thinking its a horror movie but actually it's like not at all
---
Jane all the fucking way.
---
Still pretty damn far away but I'm hyped as fuck for the future Legion rework
---
yeah, I saw that. A lot of survivors are pretty entitled
---
Surprisingly, rank 12-10 as a killer was the moment I started encountering survivors looping much more consistently and genrushing without consistent pressure, making me struggle much more to rank up. I stand at rank 6 right now and even though ruin and BBQ quite helped me on this journey, I was able to majorely improve my playstyle as a killer at ranks 12-10.
---
Yeah I had a feeling that‚Äôs what it was like. I was surprised at how much I liked Happy death day though.
---
Trappy dappy
---
Apparently you didn't hear "crop your meme"
---
Dead by Daylight is unforgiving as a game: the penalties you get for making mistakes are steep, and that's just the nature of a game about being hunted and murdered. So expect your first few games to have a steep learning curve with big, dumb mistakes and embrace it --- once you've been through trial by fire and understand the basics, the game really opens up and matches will start to get really fun.
---
Ironically, for a horror game, the best thing to do is to dive in with no fear
---
She‚Äôs the default hand, partner.
---
I just finished Marianne and I gotta say, well done!
---
No, it isn't. Gen tapping correctly takes about 105 seconds and is so easy even you could do it.
---
Didn‚Äôt really feel like taking the extra steps. Sorry about it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I know my truth.
---
3 times.
---
I guess I dropped my /s...
---
It‚Äôs just random what you‚Äôll get. I almost never play killer but most of my daily rituals are for them.
---
I mean their not  unbalanced though. Survs should be running Deja Vu i guess.
---
I just noticed how fucking weird hag‚Äôs feet are
---
I just want Feral Frenzy to be worth using üòè
---
It‚Äôs a few dollars cheaper to buy the bundle, so I‚Äôd recommend using the ps4 store.
---
The Mean Girls reference is the clue you would have needed to understand I was only half serious.
---
And It also grants cosmetics
---
Your mum fat lol
---
Ehh but seems like he'll only work in a snowy map. Or else he'll melt in others. Lol.
---
So what you want to have a game where u  can destroy the killer rember the killer should be a pain it's trying to kill us.
---
I‚Äôm just now getting back on since I posted this and holy crap. This is my first meme get this many upvotes. It‚Äôs stupid but I‚Äôm really hyped.
---
Thanks
---
I mean I wouldn't say disconnect, but I'm definitely not gonna be trying. Why bother? Where's the fun in that game? I'd rather get it over with and move on to a game where I might enjoy myself.
---
Fair enough.
---
In my opinion, killers shouldn‚Äôt camp, tunnel and slug. That‚Äôs what I mean by toxic. There are good killers that don‚Äôt need to rely on cheap tactics to get their 4ks and those killers I respect
---
yep
---
Unhooking and healing has made me rank up many times with bad players. Sometimes not even doing one gen. 
---
A few unhooks and heals, and get a good chase with the killer one or two times, and you'll rank up easily.
---
Had Spirit do this in The Game last night. 
---
We chose... Poorly.
---
I never understood the survivor rules in DBD. People dc against killers they don't want to go against, OP builds, etc. Its pretty hard to be a survivor main on PS4 because you mainly just get Spirits and Hillbilly, which is okay with me.. I just hate loading into a match and people start dcing if they get downed. Its virtually impossible for me to get rank 1 on survivor because I play solo lol.
---
 Now on killer I play fair and no matter what I do I've realized you can't make people happy.. I think there's a HUGE difference in fair gameplay and toxic gameplay, and survivors just call it tunneling no matter what now even if it's not. Its pretty damn aggravating and a big reason why I don't okay killer as much.
---
Self deprecating jokes aren‚Äôt funny
---
It‚Äôs really strong but not too good for getting BP since it only gives you a flat 1mil(can go past the cap).
---
Well, all gaming communities are somewhat like that. But no one as I can remember complained about them being terrible people, only bad at optimizing their game. The devs are still like celebrities for most players.
---
The sad thing is that I main both of them :/
---
Nothin personal kid
---
I think at this point ‚Äúkillers think looping is toxic‚Äù is just a meme of the subreddit, I can only imagine a brown rank killer having that perspective
---
I‚Äôd say this is a fair trade
---
Thanks!
---
Honestly tho, it's counterable now but it leads to some weird situations so it should probably be tweaked somewhere down the line
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Oh
---
I don't find that build fun to play ALSO from the killer prospective, it just slows the game..it visually does nothing
---
Why confront and overcome when you can just keep pestering the devs untill they bend the knee and nerf everything, again...
---
thats not why your a troll.
---
Yes. 100%.
---
I like the easter eggs in the backround
---
Careful frank doesn‚Äôt look happy with you
---
Wow that has got to be super embarrassing for the survivors. Everyone DC bruh
---
Did yall see that truetalent video with iri head onlyüíÄ
---
It becomes effective once Ruin or Overcharge is involved, that's the very clue about it. Unnerving and Distressing without any other synergies sucks balls, I know that. Every ape could hit these skillchecks. But Overcharge in addition causes even the best Survivors to sweat nervously, as it's just almost impossible to hit.
---
And to be honest, if I would get rid of Distressing, the whole image of the build would be ass. I don't doubt that there are still lots of other great builds, but if I erase the image there's almost nothing left.
---
Overcharge in addition to a that big TR and Unnerving is more efficient than pop. Believe it or not, but pop has that one tremendous weak spot of its value being dependant on the gen progress. Aslong as that gen ain't atleast 75% progressed, the value of pop is pretty small. Sure, when there are no Survivors around the degression can keep feasting it's still pretty good, but it gives more inconsistent value than OC + Unnerving does. Simply because the skillcheck will be failed atleast 8 out of 10 times, even in the higher ranks.
---
Dont mindgame her. She is the quedn.
---
Yep me too. I think it is an annoying normal.
---
That mask is damn terrifying
---
Haha, trust me, above green ranks aswell~
---
Fair enough then I just think that I've played this game since the beta launch in 2016 yet they still have issues with things from then. After three and a half years it becomes a joke
---
‚ÄúWe played that like fucking idiots, so lets DC. Yeah, that will show that toxic killer!‚Äù
---
Oink
---
I like to abuse demogorgons shred with save the best for last
---
1 second is too much, did you watch the cooldown legion from monto? It took Legion 1 second to recover and survivor have nearly no chance to run. About other changes, I agree with you.
---
I like the changes. Deep Wound needs to be changed as well. It‚Äôs so useless. Hell, it‚Äôs nothing more than a minor inconvenience at best. There‚Äôs no threat or urgency. It shouldn‚Äôt be terror radius based, and mending progress shouldn‚Äôt be saved. I thought old Deep Wound was great. Maybe, to prevent tunneling, they could simply make it so Survivors with Deep Wound leave no visible bloodtrail (to prevent moonwalking exploits again). Whatever they do, Legion needs help. Because Feral Frenzy is far more punishing than good. And a Killer shouldn‚Äôt be severally punished for using their base power.
---
Now that's your opinion and issue fella, apparently lots of other people find it interesting enough.
---
So the description says that the wraith has the Undetectable status effect while cloaked, but he can still be seen with OoO. i thought Killers that have this effect are imune to it, but the wraith isnt. Feature or?...
---
What rhymes with traps?
---
Blumhouse has a gift for coming up with interesting concepts and absolutely butchering them with melodramatic acting and unsatisfying pacing. Truth or Dare was no different from this. Applies to Ma, Happy Death Day, and the entirety of their ‚ÄúInto the Dark‚Äù series on Netflix as well. It‚Äôs worth watching if you like shitty melodramatic ‚ÄúFinal Destination‚Äù-esque thrillers? I do, which is the only justification for seeing them
---
Wait what? That works? OMFG I need it NOW.
---
No but honestly, I thought literally every attack that is based on M2 is excluded, as Pig's ambush ain't considered aswell.
---
Had someone pallet me (not even stun me) and he started to tbag and taunt... I hit him about 6 seconds later and as ghost face I tbagged him back... he dc‚Äôd.
---
I‚Äôm not rank 1 but I‚Äôm about to him 7 and good lord and I can‚Äôt wait to get there :)
---
I hung Pig up after they nerfed RBT, then just decided to nerf Ambush out of nowhere. Literally no one was asking for Pig nerfs.
---
The game lets me teabag but you know, i try to be a good person.
---
I can add you later! If you have discord add me
---
T0x1c_Gemini#4966
---
Because his invincibility would be useless if you could just hear that he is coming
---
Shred isn‚Äôt affected by save the best for last so only attack your obsession with shred and save your stacks
---
It‚Äôs ok considering that you have barely any perks. Make sure to level him up though to get better ones.
---
Surveillance is super slept on, it's great on a lot of killers imo.
---
Urban evasion, Technician, Calm Spirit, Sprinto Bursto. Hmhmm, doing gens.
---
Someone was complaining about my no offering, no addons, low level perks hag cuz i was couldn't hook him quickly enough???
---
No i mean it says undetectable but can still be seen with OoO
---
I play spirit with devour hope, ruin, bbq, and haunted grounds
---
Are you talking about from Walmart's perspective, because this looks lile the official Fun World product.
---
The difference is that Thanato requires effort (and can be denied by healing), while Ruin is passive.
---
I do agree, 8 seconds is not much, but a combined 40 ish extra seconds can work quite well for the killer‚Äôs. Hell, even Truthtalent, Otz and other skilled killers respect the fact that Ruin is a necessity, simply because of how much incomparable value it gives for one perk slot.
---
Luckily I‚Äôm getting PGTW soon so that‚Äôs one piece!
---
Creepy..... I LOVE IT
---
Depends on, who are you prestiging? I would focus on leveling up everyone first
---
This is why I don't try to get red rank lmao
---
You mean Infectious Fright?
---
True, but to be honest, IF I had to slug, I'd use 3rd Seal and Knockout. Just because I love this isolation theme so damn much, the amount of stall you provide just by cutting off the Survivors' aura-reading is insane in that scenario. Especially on rather confusing maps like the Institute.
---
Ummm....why???
---
I changed my outfit and started with the default outfit. I was so confused.
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
So when we fighting?
---
No stacks for my chili tho :(
---
Hm, that makes sense. I'm prestiging Nea, and my second best charachter is a lvl 15 Meg. I should level Meg first, right? Get some teachables and have someone good to play as while I level Nea up again later
---
Don't dis my darling Nancy
---
Your perks reset when you prestige, but the teachable stay (e.g. Your characters perks would reset but anyone (except the character you're prestiging) that has a teachable you've unlocked would keep them. You probably want to get more BP first though. The full 1 million only takes you to like, level 30
---
uh
---
Mirror Myers?
---
stupid joke, sorry
---
i wish someone would post ( &amp; mods sticky ) what each perk is when these memes are posted. turns out there‚Äôs a lot of perks i don‚Äôt recognize ..
---
That photoshop is worth a thousand upvoted alone
---
Oh right üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You mean like what happened to DS and Mettle of Man.....?
---
The idea of this build, if I am not mistaken, is to have global-ish terror radius, meaning that for survivors it would be very difficult to locate you. Thus, Distressing is essential and rabbit are essential part of the build.
---
Essentially, on a small maps, your build is equivalent to ‚Äúno terror radius‚Äù EW3 Myers, which is scary.
---
The reason I suggest you taking other perks is because even though your suggested combo is neat, it simply does not give enough value to you, as well as require you to hit the gens ASAP. 
---
On the other hand, screams will help you to locate all survivors nearly globally (terror radius is massive). Last perk can be of your choice. I recommend PoP, as with EW3 Myers you will Down people often, making Pop nearly as viable as your impossible overcharge.
---
However, for the sake of meme, run what your setup is. Maybe it is not ‚Äúviable‚Äù, but it is hilarious and deserves the time and add-ons spent.
---
Good luck with the build, and have fun!
---
I always run small game on survivors. Fuck Ruin, fuck NOED, and fuck trapper especially.
---
Welcome to the fog, u/pugluvr13
---
That's not the issue about Thanato, the true issue is it's absolute mid-game requierement. At the beginning of the game you won't have much from Thanato. Which will continue until you've atleast 2 Survivors injured.
---
And since Thanato, for a reason I still can't grasp, does NOT consider sacrificed and dead Survivors, it becomes weaker once Survivors die. Meaning you have to hook each twice and then start executing, which's counterproductive to the whole stalling thematic.
---
The sad thing is I know that Ruin is a necessity. Well, atleast most of the time. I think using it against top-tier Survivors while playing a high-tier Killer yourself (Nurse, Spirit, Billy), makes it rather optional than essential. Simply because really good Survivors can minimalize the value by a long shot, while other perks can become even more efficient when used on a skilled high-tier Killer.
---
And we still consider that Ruin might persist for like 5 minute-ish', could also be cleansed within the 1st minute, we all know how this goes haha.
---
I still agree that Ruin is absolutely dumb tho. Shouldn't exist like it does now.
---
Imma need undetectable to block ooo for wraith/pig/ghostface ASAP
---
Nope its been bugged forever but since only sweaty players use it, it hasn‚Äôt really been brought to attention as much.
---
Its been shit for a long time. I guess its worse now. Doubt i‚Äôll get fixed because DH is a perk that the devs can just blame on lag or anything else instead of it actually not working.
---
Yeah, i'd get all the perks first, then p3 and get all the perks for your main.
---
Prepare for extreme salt levels if you're going to use NOED.
---
Pretty solid
---
Nah it‚Äôs prob because Ghostface is gonna take all the kills ;)
---
Not bad considering how limited your options are, should definitely get some more perks that help to catch survivors or slow the game down.
---
i have a long time ago
---
Fine. But it isn't what I asked for.
---
Thank you!
---
The dev played our Revan so hard haha he went to hand him a pin and then retracted his hand.
---
can i ask for examples so i can level up or buy the requirements?
---
I kept begging him to say ‚ÄúI have a cleaver‚Äù
---
50/50 chance you're gonna have a bad time when  cleansing lol I like it
---
Found myself using him less at red ranks
---
You look like you‚Äôre gonna grope my neck and throw a fancy hat one, 11/10 would let you put party hats on everyone for game
---
Chase: spirit fury, enduring, Save the Best For Last
---
Game slow: usually the most important perks for ghost. Ruin is the most popular; Thanatophobia, Pop Goes the Weasel, Dying Light, and Sloppy butcher are also commonly used.
---
You already have 2 tracking perks, but it‚Äôs good to know that Nurse‚Äôs Calling is a VERY good tracking perk on ghost face.
---
Feel free to ask for an explanation about any of the above perks
---
Freddy's thing is more because of sleeping survivors having Oblivious. If Freddy had Undetectable OoO wouldn't work on him.
---
he's not my friend waited like 10-15m for a survivor match and as killer it was pretty much instant
---
fuck there I go mixing those damn things again lol
---
i love it üòÅ
---
flashlights instaheals etc
---
No problem pal (ps you can use the perk at level 1 with this trick) &lt;3
---
I feel that‚Äôs a fair expectation for the killer; go for the easiest survivor to catch in the moment
---
Came on here to make exact same comment. Would be interesting to have a Star Wars DLC. Maybe a killer with force lightning as their power and a lightsaber for a weapon. Wouldn't really fit the aesthetic of the game, though, unless there was an amazing tonal shift.
---
Spooky items from chests will complete my stolen from the fog collection. I prestige 3ed my dwight and have kept him at level one.
---
I waited half an hour to get in a lobby as killer, then wait ten minutes to find survivors because it took ages when three survivors showed up, then someone wouldn‚Äôt ready up, then wait for the screen to load, then it got stuck at 99% for two minutes. I‚Äôm no longer playing killer.
---
Asif your getting shit for this looool, i love it man
---
what rank are you?
---
About 15
---
I rarely face demogorgans or play on the stranger things map they added :(
---
you don't invest anything, you spend that time healing, just get better at chases to have longer time occupying the killer with just 1 hit, and like I said getting healed isn't the issue, it's using the slowest possible heal there is to get healed and thinking that's efficient that's the issue.
---
You can literally do the same exact thing with a medkit in literally half the time and get the same exact result. Not to mention any other possible way to heal through perks from you or other survivors.
---
ok that explains it. ya honestly just wait for the Halloween event
---
So yeah player to server to survivor on McDonald's Wi-Fi lag is real........
---
K
---
You should definitely check if your PC can actually run the game before you buy it. If it can‚Äôt then I would recommend PS4.
---
I normally save 1 million bloodpoints before prestiging so that character is usable and has some decent perks etc once prestiged. Use up all your good items and offerings (especially bloodpoint offerings) on that character and then prestige them. Should get them from Level 50/P150/P250 back up to P1/2/3 37-40 depending on how efficiently you get through the bloodwebs. Having said all that, I‚Äôd focus on unlocking more teachables before prestiging.
---
Ooh look I found something that someone else spent time on, I‚Äôll steal it and post it, then not even crop it or give credit which is the least I can do. Stop stealing memes.

Oof

I love demogorgon. He‚Äôs something fresh and new and I just like playing him a lot. I main Freddy but demo is so fun to play as and against.
---
I wish Freddy had Undetectable under certain circumstances (Or no Aura Reading on him if he's further than 32 meters away and the survivor is awake) I used to run Rancor on Old Freddy during the Mettle Of Man Crisis and it was rather silly because Freddy wouldn't show his aura if the survivor was awake, making the Rancor a nasty surprise. Of course I'd pair it with STBFL and PWYF so I'd never even hit the obsession once until I can insta-down and mori via Rancor.

I called it One Punch Freddy.

Hell yeah, I also had a couple of games like that. But 99% of the time games like this end with 4K 10 minutes in =(

Yea thats probably why i stil play surv. A good job hiding is very rewarding. Sucks when youre killer thoough and at the end its like "8% of survivors found" Jesus, theyre everywhere!

*Chat disabled for 3 seconds...*

how is this a win? game lasted less than 2 minutes, no bbq stacks, shit for bp...entity displeased. ty bhvr
---
Me too usually but this was so easy that I couldn't resist xD
---
Dude I hate camping killers who always do stupid attempts at ceiling shots and Musty Flicks. They just tunnel and demo everyone. Fat rip.
---
ya they should just take away his Oblivious for that honestly. as for me anyway, it is really dumb that freddy is forever immune to borrowed time
---
Uh can you source that? Cool if true but i thought Entity was just referred to as ‚Äúit‚Äù
---
what does thanatophobia do?
---
All of that may be true but it doesn't discount Iridescent heads strength in any way shape or form. And Iridescent Head gets even more powerful if you combine it with the infantry belt, for 3 one shotting hatchets. That is incredibly overpowered regardless of how strong or weak Huntress might be. 
---
Also I know you list her weaknesses here but if her weaknesses were all she had, Huntress wouldn't be considered one of the better killers in the game. I mean hell, before Spirit she was probably considered the 3rd best killer.
---
These are add-ons for the Huntress. The pink one turns her hatchets into insta-downs, but reduces the amount of hatchets you can carry to one. The purple one increases the amount of hatchets you can carry by two. By running both, you can carry three insta-down hatchets. :)
---
Imo it is
---
wait aren‚Äôt you the ‚ÄúTHICC Feng‚Äù guy?
---
welcome to dead by daylight
---
Huh, that's quite something
---
yeah
---
Damn that new flashlight addon looks sick
---
It makes it so survivors do gens, heal, and cleanse totems (I think) slower. Tier 3 makes it so everything is 4% slower for every injured/on hook survivor leading to a possible 16% slowdown.
---
So, I was playing with my friend and the match was going smooth, until she got downed at that enclosed space. 
---
I went to heal her, however the killer came back and trapped us there. The exit gates were opened shortly afterwards, and the killer proceeded to block us in there until the end game timer ran out and we died.
---
Also, apologies for the shitty quality. I wasn‚Äôt planning on posting this at first, so I just filmed it on my phone to show to my boyfriend later on.
---
holy shit, you deserve a follow.
---
That's real toxicity right there, hate those kind of killers..i think it's reportable, but i'm not sure
---
IIRC:
---
1) First is the Nurse addon rework
---
2) After her it‚Äôs the Doctor changes
---
3) Legion true rework
---
4) Bubba baybee
---
Honestly my formatting for this post sucks and you should just make your comment a post talking about this cause more people would def respond and who knows maybe devs will notice.
---
you too
---
I've personally had bullshit hits, laggy games and killer teleporting in about 80% of my games playing 40-180 ping games. For me its been constantly shit as survivor not nearly as shit for killer and less bullshit as killer in general. BASICALLY it just amplified all the problems of p2p but increased survivor queue times and decreased killer queues times by maybe a minute (6-8mins to now 5-7mins). I've played about 16 hours the last 3 days so I'd say I have a pretty good sample size of games
---
DW itself needs removed or reworked. It's not fun and it's not powerful.
---
UPDATE: Apparently the issue here was that DBD having issues with my mouse software and ONLY DBD so i just turned the mouse software off and it works smoothly again.
---
She does breath pretty loud, but those sounds she makes while injured are insanely loud and kinda sexual. Still mostly play her when I'm survivor.
---
holy shit, is it a teachable?
---
Idk why this is flaired as shitpost...
---
Yes, for Nurse
---
Yo how tf can you remember thanatophobia and dying light but not my MAIN MAN corrupt intervention
---
It's probably better that way.
---
Can somebody explain this to me?
---
What likely happened here, in all honestly from a survivor side; 
---
First DC saw the insta down less than 30 seconds into the game, knew it was an insta down Huntress and just didn't want to deal with that shit. 
---
Second DC saw the DC and didnt want to play a 3man game against an insta down Huntress. 
---
Last person, as you can see, fully gives up and just stands there because there is 2 DCS and a person hooked. 
---
It sucks for everyone as soon as that one DC goes. Yeah you as killer get to laugh at that "survivors" entitlement and you lose out on some points, but you immediately get a better game. I dont blame a lot of leftover survivors for DCing eventually too. Their game is immediately made harder by the first DC because what is "balanced" for a 4man team suddenly becomes skewed against 3man instead.
---
what?
---
Strong killer, fun and very underrated. Best Dbd chapter of the year imo
---
that's not cool
---
I mean this happens all the time with dbd unfortunately. Someone datamines something the Devs were just trying out, not even pushed to ptb and people lose their shit. I'm not sure wtat it is about this community but they seem to think every little adjustment or test is a 100% guaranteed change.
---
Please excuse me while I throw my F1 key into the lord of the rings volcano
---
They are op addons and everybody dc when going against
---
Not cool man
---
You're aware of the internal workings of BHVR? You know the size of each team? It's such a garbage take.
---
Well we're not talking about dancing emotes, we're talking about basic communication emotes. Just the basic survivor ones would work fine.
---
why though
---
I got that part. How are they op?
---
(I'm still low level so I haven't seen this stuff)
---
Call it a masterpiece of a meme
---
Babe, why you trippin? She‚Äôs just the survivor I play with for dailies.
---
I am confused physically, emotionally, and sexually at the same time.
---
For real though, great drawing.
---
The alliance is kinda like a better dark sense
---
I started leveling my huntress. Every level I get one, sometimes even two, of these red hatched blades. Sadly I never get the infantry belt XD
---
If hitboxes were fixed that would solve almost all the annoying moments of dbd I mean some killers are annoying and swf can be annoying but like that's def not as bad as vaulting and being on the other side of a pallet and still getting hit lol
---
I usually use noed when I‚Äôm learning a new killer
---
Where was this said though?
---
Freddy, I hold out some hope for.  The License Holders let them completely change Freddy for the rework, let them make a recent modification so Freddy has the Undetectable Effect, and might let them change Quentin‚Äôs Face.
---
For every injured survivor, all survivors gain 4% action speed penalty (max of 16% if all survivors are injured). Corrupt intervention locks the most distant 3 gens from where you start for 2 minutes .
---
Soo true, if i had a penny for each time my hammer smashes the back of the skull of a survivor, only for it to go thro his model with no damage, id drown in pennies
---
This guy actually paused at one point when I was coming off the hook and he was basically breathing on me to make sure he hit my teammate and not me. He then chased my teammate while my injured self went running the other way.
---
u rite u rite
---
I had some shitty ass survivors last night who were toxic as fuck post game because I was complete shit as ghostface. After 4 games of dc at the beginning and waiting forever for matches, I just went to bed.
---
Eh, it's all up in the air with that one. Minor stuff like that is easy enough to sign off on, things like lore require a lot more attention.
---
It is
---
r/beatmetoit
---
Nerf all viable killers because we can‚Äôt hang
---
Nurse and spirit must burn so that swf with toolboxes can run through them as well in under about 5 minutes 
---
Funny how I survive against more than half the spirits I play against... but then again, I also adapt to different killers and change my play style.  
---
But nah, everyone is right. Just nerf everything (goes for killers too, not everything needs nerfed for survivors) 
---
What happened to fun? I find prayer beads spirit one of the funnest things to play against.  She can legit jump scare you and give you panic.  This is a horror survival game afterall... a CASUAL horror survival game I might add... 
---
Imo, every killer should be a threat like her. Makes more sense for the games theme. And really makes survivors step up. (And even then if you get a good swf they can pop gens like crazy, even as a spirit/nurse)
---
What did old BNP use to do? Cant find anything online about it
---
Yeah but Paragraphs suck.
---
Yea the game optimizers are also professional art designers in their spare time! Did a bird shat on your eye or did you shove 14 crayons up your nose for breakfast
---
Its not toxic at all. Smartest play they could have made. Just dont go in there
---
Who said he‚Äôs hacking? I just don‚Äôt wanna be part of a match where I‚Äôm caught right off the bat regardless of strategy or skill (they just get god to tell them what to do next is what I meant by how much they correctly predict)
---
I‚Äôve tried for months, if it found off the bat, I‚Äôm hooked. This is basically as if I started a match with one less hook phase and injured if I get rescued, and even when I do get rescued it‚Äôs the exact moment the killer comes back and my rescuer never has borrowed time or seems more appealing to chase than me, so regardless I just lose cause luck be against me.
---
Now put away the claim I said they was hacking, there‚Äôs nothing here that comes off that way, not even the ‚Äúgod telling them what to do next due to how their predictions are so perfect‚Äù as that‚Äôs about prediction being insanely perfect.
---
**not once has an early hooking not resulted in me losing the match due to unsafe hooks without borrowed time or being completely ignored by my team the entire match despite the killer chasing someone far off in the distance**
---
Y
---
So then shes not fat because they didn't make her fat. I have a friend that looks similar in real life. Runs every day, eats most broccoli and eggs for lunch, etc. Her body is tight but naturally the same size as Jane.
---
Here‚Äôs a video some did of it; the only difference is she used BBQ instead of sloppy. https://youtu.be/OSLz7-sWD5g
---
Nah, since the EGC timer was going there was a definite 'end' to the scenario so it doesn't fall under BHVR's definition of taking the game hostage. 
---
If the EGC timer wasn't active though and the only way to get out would be to disconnect, then that's when something like this is reportable.
---
Pink one makes your hatchets insta down survivors regardless of health state at the cost of reducing the amount of hatchets the huntress can carry at a time to 1. The purple one adds 2 to the amount you can carry.
---
3 hatchets at a time that down you from full health, usually paired with a mori for extra fun.
---
This is just my opinion, obviously, but I get more infuriated just by noed and/or spirit existing in the game than I do for dumb hits
---
Then you can‚Äôt play nurse and have 2 frames
---
How? Lol
---
She‚Äôs getting kills, it‚Äôs not holding the game hostage, as the timer is kicked in.  Be waiting a couple minutes max
---
And it‚Äôs her best play if they are close enough for one to escape.  
---
I‚Äôd do that too if they were silly enough to hide in a tight spot like that.  
---
Now if the pig held you there with no purpose at all or intent to win, that would be different. But this is fine... she caught them and they payed the price...
---
I usually see the survivor set it off and then still get to the pallet. before she can get a hit in. The again the whole instant-teleport-and-hit thing doesn't exist on console
---
try ranchor, or even just bitter merm. Knowing where people are/ are headed is huge with ghosty boi
---
This
---
ok stupid
---
Rood
---
12k Points seems unlikely in case of instant downs.
---
Not bad 
---
For my personal ghostess with the mostess build I use iron grasp, thrilling tremors, I‚Äôm all ears, and relentless 
---
Excluding add ons and offerings
---
Well the lags not worse its just that you are adding an extra step for the internets to have to go, instead of Killer host -&gt; survivor.
---
Now killer connects sends info to the dedi server, then the dedi server sends the info to the survivor! Then you have to also add up both of their pings to the dedicated server.
---
Its just what everyone has been dying to get! Could anyone have foreseen these events happening? Surely not, FIX HITBOXES! the community yelled, FIX LAG! all without actually having a clue how hitboxes or latency work in an online environment. 
---
On a side note I bet south korean players are having the best games of their lives!
---
So you like them fresh and ripe out of high school? It's all good, everyone has a preference. Seeing as how JLo is near 50 and still has a banging body, I'll take her experience
---
Plague has a perk that blocks all but 3 generators at the beginning at the match fof 2 minutes. Some say that makes it more reliable than Ruin
---
it sorta isnt. She loses so many points for it
---
Probably the gen disguising the noise
---
That‚Äôs an ez dc, had it last night. Never again.
---
Could have the last perk give tokens for the first 2 tokens get the addons used in the trial back and past the first 2 tokens it gove BP this would be the same as survivors plunders or aces perks
---
LMAO
---
1. Don‚Äôt use stridor, it becomes a crutch and there‚Äôs better perks. 
---
2. Don‚Äôt use your power fully, use short bursts.
---
Also here‚Äôs a good video that‚Äôs not like 3 hours long like a lot of tutorials https://youtu.be/Hw5PUsHWd2w
---
I hope that one day they eventually add Joe to the game
---
But if I play on steam I get scammed cuz it won‚Äôt load the fucking game
---
I think it forced more skill checks and made the great skill check zone bigger. Idk for sure tho
---
By the entity that is an old format
---
Lol, you mean getting a 4K?
---
I don‚Äôt even slug and they still do it...
---
I hook someone and their friend dcs instantly so I don‚Äôt have time to look for the last guy... 
---
But sure, be a CUNT who dcs... 
---
Basically admitting to the world, ‚Äúwe got outplayed, so we must dc to allow one a chance to leave‚Äù.  So basically cheating to have a survivor  escape 
---
Well played, you REALLY showed that mean killer trying to get his points and pip lol
---
Maybe everyone was using no mother
---
So you‚Äôre forced to lose because the killer is using cheap tactics. Fuck that garbage. This is exploiting body blocking, and forcing people to die. She didn‚Äôt hit them until the timer was almost gone meaning she knew when she hits a survivor it cancels out collision with the killer.
---
Brilliant! Thank you for this. I had hoped there was a workaround. 
---
It's still not a solution 100% of the time becuase you may not always be able to find one in time or maybe you get camped your first hook, but at least now I have something I can try when I face Franklin's.
---
Yet you are the one who clearly mentioned it in the first place about me responding you when you are doing the same, you sure like to contradict yourself like the clueless dumb toxic troll you are üôÉ
---
r/oinkers_ welcomes you
---
They don't even bother with SC, they just take pictures with their phones
---
I miss insidious old Fred, xray vision after standing still
---
Yeah, fair play.  Sorry they were a dick.  
---
Just remember next time have her crawl out of the tight space before healing haha, prevent this from happening again
---
Requiescat in hook
---
Entity is true, camping is permitted
---
Mettle of man got nerfed to the ground. Decisive is still extremely viable and meta.
---
Well, why would I bother going against op addons when my team, me included, can‚Äôt even tell if it‚Äôs possible to win.
---
Hell, once one person dcs the rest do.
---
I hope y‚Äôall got banned
---
Swf is so fun to play against tho. Just run Franklin's demise and once you hook at least one they all go for a rescue and you just beat em down
---
only issue I have with it is he because the best camper and tunnel anywhere on the map really cause at least with bubba teamwork you can still make the save but with Freddy if he wants you dead you are dead pretty much. and I have seen freddy players do this a lot because they figured it out its a shame as well cause freddy does not need todo that sort of thing anymore
---
You‚Äôd only create more salt for more people because let‚Äôs be real, no survivor likes going against that stuff
---
Its probably best on her lol
---
Survivors either have to deal with being broken with thana the whole match (because people don‚Äôt like to cleanse against her)
---
Or they cleanse and get rid of thana, but then give her Uber puke 
---
Win/win for plague
---
Billy? Bubba? They have 1 shot mechanics built in to their kits. Billy's even has the added benefit of being useful even if no one is around
---
Are you getting the same error as this post? Because if you are.. it‚Äôs literally not the game.
---
None of that is ranged.
---
The thing is that they fix a bunch of shit every single major patch. The game is unrecognizable from it's 2016 self. You are looking at it from in incremental change perspective. When you look at the big picture and compare the actual years worth of progress you will see how much they have actually done.
---
&gt;The skin team seems to have priority
---
What priority? The resources are people that work in it.
---
They have taken time to fix bugs, and the community went APESHIT since there was no new content. You can't pick and choose stuff. They are doing their best and we should appreciate it. Things are getting fixes consistently. So in my honest opinion your stance while valid is some regards is BS in others. I've watched the game progress from the literal start and I'd advise everybody to take a look back and see how far it has come.
---
I blocked every single person, whose only argument was insulting me and crying about "ruining fun". 
---
Sorry, I give 0 fuck about fun survivors have, if having fun for them would mean having no fun for me.
---
I use red and green mories, I used to have a lot of fun playing blackbox/dying light freddy before DL was changed, I camp and tunnel when I feel it brings me fun.
---
Sometimes I hardtunnel if I feel it gives me more fun, than letting that particular survivor go away, sometimes I facecamp for same reasons. 
---
I have countless games where doing that stuff led me to victory, and games where it led me to defeat. However, I had fun in all of them, because I played how I wanted and not how I was told to. 
---
Idiots above think that they are entitled enough to tell me what I should and what I should not do. They are wrong and that is why I blocked him.
---
And I blocked you fir the same reasons. Don't insult people for having different fun in games.
---
Don't be a clown.
---
And we were in better shape too! We could recover our sprint burst in just 20 seconds, twice as fast as you spoiled, tubby survivors nowadays. And we didn't do any of those slow mid vaults. It was fast vaults or nothing!
---
Wow such a big deal, you‚Äôre doing the world a solid by being so emotionally invested in literally fucking _nothing_
---
No I load it up and it‚Äôs just pitch black
---
Or just trying to survive....
---
Precisely. 
---
We couldn‚Äôt do anything in the situation, and we both lost our items and addons, which was super annoying, too. 
---
Had we not been stuck there, we would have easily escaped, and I guess the killer knew that so he proceeded to troll us like that. 
---
Never seen anything quite like it!
---
I'm using a some type of galaxy pack. You can find it (and probably a lot more) here https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight
---
Why? Because I don't feel like really trying in a game where I'm very unlikely to win? I play, I die and I move on to the next game as soon as I can. I don't play this game in a competitive way, I play to have fun.
---
The thing is that especially Killers that lack direct mobillity and chasing capabillities such as Doctor and Freddy, desperately need stall so they extend the game until they get maximum value out of their utillity.
---
Plus, Thanatophobia for example, doesn't work most of the time or is more or less a wasted perk slot while Dying Light needs to scale into late game. So it's not that accessable on literally everyone.
---
Much obliged tho &lt;3
---
Is there a game where dedicated servers are praised?
---
Are you using a really bad graphics card? The only time I‚Äôve known that to happen whether it‚Äôs a steam game or not is when you don‚Äôt have a graphics card capable of running it.
---
How is this the killer's fault?
---
Saying you don't slug to get last guy is a damn lie, you've done it plenty of times. Since you're aware survivors do this why you complaining about it. Go find hatch and shut it instead of coming here whining about shit that's been happening forever.
---
The computer works fine, I bought a game and it didn‚Äôt load, I tried a game I got for free, didn‚Äôt load.
---
You underestimate Overcharge when it's paired with Unnerving and a good gen-zone. When all of these 3 are in play at the same time, Overcharge is actually really damn powerful.
---
Just get into a custom with someone of your friends and keep attempting to hit that OC skillcheck with Unnerving inbound. It's really not easy, even when you're good at hitting skillchecks and are aware of OC being ingame.
---
Ginger Snaps, duh

I play on Xbox and had 3 matches back to back where they were all against Iridescent Hatches but all 3 were different people. You‚Äôd understand the frustration that would bring. Also I hate Myers‚Äô ability to infinite tier 3 with tombstone. That‚Äôs the worst

BHVR will nerf you next patch.

It's this subreddit moderation fault, the trash and reused memes got out of hand.. They should just call it 'r/deadbymemes'
---
Me too pal
---
Its not like she blocked all of you, there was an end to this game she sacrificied other survivors to get you in a easy way instead, not a very fun way, not efficient way but still - it doesnt force you to disconnect therefore it doesnt ho≈Çd the game hostage indefienately
---
I am pretty sure survivor players given a similiar opportunity will do much worse things
---
Not doing that. You got there, didn't you?
---
So stay there and improve.
---
You won't get far by standing in rank 20
---
No breaks on the R train
---
Billy is kind of ranged
---
I wasn‚Äôt talking about slugging as outplaying... I meant the killer would have outplayed the team killing the first 2 people and is now outplaying the last 2.  If slugging or not
---
Dcing is not an actual tactic though, that‚Äôs my issue. It‚Äôs the equivalent of cheating or bitching out 
---
I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm up against a iridescent head huntress with full meta perks.  I don‚Äôt ever dc, it‚Äôs not meant to be... I simply win or lose and move on to the next game
---
I will never agree with dcing..  
---
And even if the end game is in more favor for killer now, that doesn‚Äôt mean dcing is the answer... it‚Äôs lame and a cop out,  take the loss like a man or escape like a man.
---
This is straight up the "your toes, hand them over" meme for dbd
---
the guy I'm responding to literally mentions "dancing on the last survivor on hook" and some silly wraith emote. Even the thumbs up seems out of place
---
*Mount Doom
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean he wouldn‚Äôt be awesome in this game 
---
(Even if it will never happen...)
---
bloodthirsty would make legion slightly more viable
---
*Parry this, you fucking casual*
---
I play on PS4 and this is probably already known, but I‚Äôve notice my Daily Challenges are very killer heavy. Yesterday I got a survivor challenge to take down two hooks, which, I succeeded doing, but I did not get the points and the challenged was replaced by, you guessed it, a killer challenge. What‚Äôs up with that?
---
I'll repeat, it's not my opinion.
---
I like skins and don't have too many bug problems. I play on PS4 so can't comment on dedicated servers yet. My main bug gripe was the glitch where SWF was leaving people behind in the first lobby, but that's been fixed now.
---
Your disagreement isn't with me, I'm just interpreting the arguments of others, and acknowledging that I don't know enough to refute it.
---
it's "server" not "sever".
---
You should buy licensed killers like: demogorgon, leatherface, ghostface, michael myers, freddy. I think those are the ones comment if I missed one. But the reason you should buy one of those is because they are licensed wich means you can‚Äôt buy them with iridescent shards (in-game credits you get by leveling up). You can buy all the rest by just playing the game.
---
Not exactly.
---
There was still one generator left to be done when the killer came and blocked us there. 
---
We had to wait first for the last gen to be completed, then for the end game timer to end, and all this time we couldn‚Äôt do anything. Do you think that‚Äôs fair? The other survivors also had no way of knowing that we were being held hostage like that, and I guess that‚Äôs why they just left.
---
And besides, the killer left ‚ÄùLOL XD‚Äù in the chat afterwards, so they were definitely doing it just to troll. Not to mention the fact that (as someone pointed out) the killer only hit us right at the end, showing that he knew the collision would cancel out when he did that, so it was like a final ‚Äùf u‚Äù to us.
---
Michael Myers or "The Shape" is a good choice as his add ons make for multiple different strategies for how to play. And his perks are pretty decent especially now that Dying light got changed. 
---
The rest of the killer (imo) are all decent I would recommend getting at least 1 licensed killer (Michael, The Pig, demogorgon, Freddy and Leatherface) as you can earn shards (in-game currency) to unlock any non licensed killers. 
---
Leatherface is really good for his perks and memes but he is not a strong killer.
---
I knew ma was going to be stupid and I loved it. But after the nun I haven‚Äôt been a fan of them.
---
Where‚Äôs his red light?
---
Good monitors have built in cross hairs. I use mine when playing huntress.
---
Me last game. 
---
I saw those toolboxes and flashlights at the last second. Don't think that Ebony Mori wasn't intentional.
---
Don‚Äôt even think for a second that us survivors will respect that 4% either!
---
Hey look, proof of a couple assholes griefing.
---
BMI is a terrible measure of health anyway. It's meant for measuring trends across populations, not individuals. Body fat and waist to height ratio are much better. I'm considered "overweight" according to BMI, but "slender and healthy" by waist to height, and "very athletic" by body fat.
---
No huntress is the only true ranged killer, that's why she was invented and iridescent is Def one of the strongest addons, when combined with  purple belt it's one of the most op builds in game.  I'm just saying Billy is kind of ranged.  But imo easy af to juke when performing rush.
---
Well, now I know what to add next year
---
Report button exists for a  reason
---
Well.. thank you. I went to get a protection hit for a Kate and I got downed instantly, no exposed status effect, absolutely nothing showed up, and he did that same to the guy healing the Kate, a random Claudette saved me and got insta downed and then I ran him around for almost a minute, used my DS and started being a toxic lil bitch. I waited till the end of the match, he could have some unknown perk or add on idk, but nope
---
Yeah but that doesn't change anything about Iridescent Head. It is too strong when combined with other add-ons. If it trumped other add-ons it'd be fine.
---
I did not make this but my friend made it give him support
---
Why did people dc against a demogorgon of all things.
---
You can see the perks everyone was using
---
Everyone saying 10 to 15 minutes. Hahahaha what? Y'all must not be in or anywhere near red ranks and still floating around those yellow and green. That shit can take up to an hour to find a killer that's gonna lobby dodge or someone gets an "unexpected error" message then we gotta all wait all over again. 
---
I would seriously be happy at this point just to wait 10 minutes for a match and that's saying a lot considering the fact matches USED to take a minute or 2 with match making set to look for players on the groups average. Which was never above 5 to begin with.
---
Forgot Franklin
---
I might have some video footage if needed
---
I gotta give it to you, the creativity is there. There were a couple things I thought would be OP, but then I realized that shit would only hit the fan if the survivors didn't do their jobs fast enough or efficiently. I like the idea of different attack types. Awesome character altogether. It's one thing to read this stuff, but I feel like we're more apt to get a feel for a character when we're able to play it or against it, which is really unfortunate because this is such an awesome concept.

The Pig (crouching in front of us) trapped us in that small enclosed space for the duration of an entire gen being fixed by our teammates and til the end game collapse timer ran out, crouching and nodding etc, causing us to not be able to do anything for like 35% of the match, losing our items, dying and even deranking.

What? Lmao

I didn't see anything better to mark it as ;_;

I believe you. It just seems weird.

Nah I‚Äôm 99% sure it‚Äôs total progression. I‚Äôve kicked gens at like 10-20% and they instantly go back to 0%.
---
I just looked it up and this is what the wiki says
---
‚ÄúPop Goes the Weasel always regresses the Generator by the stated percentage in regards to the full Generator progression, not in regards to its current progression at the time of breaking it.
---
A Generator damaged at a progression of 50 % will regress instantly to 25 %.
---
A Generator damaged at a progression of up to 25 % will regress instantly to 0 %.‚Äù
---
Just imagine demogorgon or bubba being carried by a feng min and then she just throws them on the hook as they scream

Oh no we got outplayed let's dc so the killer gets less for it. What cucks

I'm not throwing anyone under the bus, you can't even contact him, I tried. Nor anyone in that game other than myself, feel free to try. And I'm not accusing him of hacking, I made sure to say it's on PS4, I've had one lag switcher on PS4 but actually hacking is pretty hard. I think it was a bug and was curious to know if anyone else had it happen or knew how

(Op asked and i delivered dont hate the player, hate the game)
---
It was a short match, and the last gen took a while to be completed, so we were stuck there for like 35% of the match.  
---
How was I ‚Äùbitching about losing‚Äù? I simply thought that it was super unfair how we died, lost our items and even deranked because we literally could not do anything for such a long time. Not to mention how unfun the match was for us because the killer, instead of trying to kill us, decided to troll us and held us hostage for no reason at all except to be a total prick. 
---
Also, to be clear, my friend was still downed when the killer came back, and he could have downed me very easily as well, since I was still in that small space healing her (all the while our teammates were on the other side of the map, opening the exit gates - so he could have easily hooked both of us in time), but instead he just crouched there and blocked us on purpose.
---
It‚Äôs foolish of you to make assumptions like that about me. This is literally my first time posting on this sub, I am a super casual player and I‚Äôm never toxic to the killer. I just play to have fun, and this game was not a very fun experience.
---
It‚Äôs better in some situations than others, but far from being the worst.
---
Entity Very Pleased

Removed for name shaming

Happy cake day. Also genius idea
---
I dont say I am having no fun, its about my friends getting started. I also see that survivors use low rank premades to get boosted, but I dont see a solution with this system. For example, seperating ranked games from casual fun games could be a start, like most MOBAs have it.
---
What if since the hatch "spawns" at 2 gens it had a 10/20 seconds till open timer, or even half that a 5/10 second timer could be interesting. While 3-5 gens remaining could have the hatch open immediately but with a  30-50 or 15-25 seconds delay till it spawned?
---
Would this only counter the "hurry and D/C or die so I can get the hatch!" mindset which I rarely see, or could this have other ramifications and/or uses?
---
Nice. The third one is somewhere between 0:10 and 0:30
---
For not wanting to ruin other peoples games? Makes sense.
---
what

Honestly, deep wound sounds way more fun for everybody than instadowns
---
"The Entity is often designated as of female gender.
---
This is due to the French language, mother tongue of most of the Developers, neither possessing a gender-neutral pronoun nor a grammatical neuter. The Entity's original French name, "L(a)' Entit√©" is a feminine noun and the Developers have been known to refer to The Entity with feminine pronouns in English as well."

That's a good way of saying, "Hey, I watch the pedophile known as OchiDo"
---
Yeah, but given I was using ink it was a bit hard to fix. I was basing it off the render for his Switch exclusive cosmetic, the mask is slightly larger since it pops/is thicker.
---
Or you know....they just do internal testing or a ptb like any other gaming company and dont force their player base to be their test subjects. We are the consumers and they are the buisness. We give them our money and they supply their product. We are not obliged to do their own testing for them

Honestly I was fine with local hosting, and while I think there are a good amount of people who do want ~~good~~ dedicated servers to fix lag issues I think the vast majority of people who ask for dedicated servers just think that "local hosting bad, dedicated server good, BHVR plz fix."

I've ran this FOREVER ON spirit, but sometimes I'll swap haunted grounds out for Thrill of the Hunt and play defend the totems. You'd be surprised how HARD they'll tunnel totems, especially after they learn you have devour hope.

If you're seriously going to derank, then you'll ruin plenty more games rather than if you just played normally.
---
I‚Äôve swapped premonition for spine chill

Perk ideas are suggestions.

Dude, safely unhook you‚Äôre partners or just fuck off.
---
I play demo/hag and usually trap the hook area and then leave.
---
Well one time as a demo I hook claud in the basement and trap the stairs and one of the doorways just to do some surveillance. 
---
I leave the shack and as I‚Äôm leaving I see a guy coming so I chase him and he goes in. I get the rescuer hit and he saves the Claudette but claude gets stuck and rescuer is gone, so i down and hook again. As I‚Äôm leaving another rescuer comes so I go back. Hit the rescuer and she unhooks. Well, I Down the rescuer and try to chase claud. I get a hit but there‚Äôs borrowed time activated. So I go back, hook new victim and then activate my abyss power and see a blip upstairs. 
---
Well no one was there except for a locker, so I open it and there‚Äôs Claudette. As soon as I hook her, a dc.
---
To my knowledge, you can‚Äôt (right now). If you could, it‚Äôd  probably be a bug. Sorry

F in the chat for the other two who didn't make it
---
The killer behaviour isn't in any way shape or form bannable - there are many mechanics still in the game that are unfair or perks but that doesnt make them bannable
---
You posted this post in order to find people WHO will back you up and cheer you while upvoting everyone saying YEAH THIS BAD
---
So the assumptions were not without merit - you try to shame the killer even tho there was only one gen left that took at maximum 80 seconds to finish
---
But the thing is - there was no offense, you were not forced to dc 
---
And if you dont like it Ask the devs to add partial collision or something, the killer took all its chances to win and he did on its own terms, good for him
---
Ok Done
---
Prayer beads are fine.... 
---
Leave my jumpscares alone
---
honestly if there was to be a friday the 13th dlc, i think it would be be better if it was based on a movie and not the game. maybe part 3 sense it has the classic design for jason and chris higgins could make for a good survivor.
---
What about a hex totem that only activated when there is one survivor left that essentially had the entity blocking the open hatch that you could still hear and locate and the totem be visible to both killer and survivor? Just a thought. But yeah how would that work out? So you and the killer both know where the hatch is and have a game of cat and mouse for the hatch, or do the last gen/s while killer guards totem and give yourself more options of escape.
---
Here's your fucking data: Have more than one location per region for your servers.
---
Seriously who the fuck thought only having one dedicated server location per region was a good idea? I realize that Behavior isn't fucking EA but when I see that I have 300 ms with Virginia because Virginia is a fucking thousand miles away from me I can't help but audibly groan. Even goddamn TF2 still has dedicated servers in Detroit for the jackasses like me in Toronto.
---
All I can say is I feel really damn sorry for the people on the West coast. Can't imagine how bad the ping is in Seattle.
---
That's what I love about these high school girls, man. I get older, they stay the same age.
---
Spirit really incites fear which makes things exciting but what I dislike about playing against her is how half the survivors DC
---
People play PVP games believe it or not because they want to outplay others.  I‚Äôm not even talking nurse. I‚Äôm specifically talking about spirit and even more specific prayer beads.  You literally get no feedback from the killer.  Getting free hits from a prayer bead spirit does not feel like an outplay to me. More of a guess. Granted I agree this game would be more fun if people weren‚Äôt as serious at times. But why do you think this community can get salty and toxic?  Same reason you are complaining about SWFs (you want to win the game). As far as your paul Bunyan pecos bill tall tales about your 50% survive rate on survivor I would love to see that. Assuming you aren‚Äôt in a SWF.
---
It‚Äôs beautiful 
---
I‚Äôve looked at it for 3 hours now
---
I was referring to the one found in older game version (pre 1.5.3 patch). That BNP would instantly bring a generator to 100% completion and required no skillchecks.
---
Yeah man, Dwight did 3 full 360's in the end while the Myers just stood there briefly, then Stab! Poor guy, it just wasn't enough. üòÖ
---
It is ridiculous considering that I queue up for killer and get stuck for 20 mins trying to get a lobby.
---
How is that the remaining survivor's fault?
---
So basically i can buy the non-licenced killers by just playing the game
---
edit: yes i can
---
Wow how long did it take to prestige? ^/s
---
This is pretty much the whole argument in a nutshell. Yes the artists can't fix the game but I still have to ask why we get a new skin every other week when some bugs have been in the game since launch.
---
Xbox has an image share ya know.
---
I did not I‚Äôm mad DUMB
---
Well, dcing is another issue... and that‚Äôs more the survivors fault at that point not hers :/ 
---
I‚Äôve won so many games against spirit (with and without prayer beads)
---
People just don‚Äôt seem to understand you need to play in different ways against different killers... it‚Äôs not ALWAYS about flashlighting a killer and trying to loop
---
Is there any chance of getting a Virus?
---
I didn't whine I just told you don't be a cunt and slug big difference. And if that's cheating I guess camping is cheating, tunneling is cheating. See how stupid that sounds.

I asked about ways to de rank but I take it having a crap team or monthly reset are the only options.

No, because tunneling and camping (though lame) is a part of the actual gameplay

Dcing is not, it‚Äôs a cop out birch move... but sure, whatever you want to think.
---
Umm bless you?
---
Survivour should be Tommy Jarvis / One of the final girls.
---
How is it the remaining survivors' fault?
---
There is no way to derank fast other than ruining the game. You could try initiating chases with the killer in hopes that your team does gens but this would be a slow and probably futile process as you may safety pip if you the chase lasts long enough and you do altruistic things.
---
You are right. 
---
Guess I gotta grind those bloodpoints and perk up.
---
You DO know it's voluntary to participate right? And they aren't the only ones to. WoW has a PTB server all the damn time because they can't think of everything, and that's the point. This gives them more minds more eyes more hands to work it through the pages because no one can think of everything
---
Needs more glare; maybe some finger prints for added measure.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I never said it was bannable or that the killer should be banned for this, I simply said it felt unfair and unfun, because we couldn‚Äôt do anything at all. 
---
Again, you‚Äôre making weird assumptions based on nothing. I posted this because I had a good laugh at the whole situation (despite being annoyed initially) and wondering ‚Äùwtf just happened?‚Äù. I‚Äôve never seen anything like this before, and I didn‚Äôt think it was possible.
---
What exactly _forces_ someone to disconnect, then? The game ends one way or another, eventually. I‚Äôm sure that most people would have just disconnected if the same thing happened to them, we were stuck there for way too long.
---
Same, there's something about escaping as Jane which feels better than any other survivor. Claudette and Jake are great stealth survivors but hiding with Jane is much more fun.
---
Ok done my screens a nightmare
---
How are u farming bp if u domt take bbq?
---
What a fucking work of art
---
You DO know its not voluntary right now , right ? What im calling for is for it to be like WoW and have a ptb if they want to test stuff. The dedi servers are currently on the live servers though. So again  its not voluntary unless you straight up dont play the game
---
Removed for salty after chat
---
Are you being sarcastic? I can't tell lol
---
This is an A-tier meme, I commend you
---
You have a choice, you can persevere and help out a bit or not. Also your argument about having multiple points for servers? Maybe they can't afford it. They have Deathgarden hemmoraging money as they try to fix it, and they have to pay licensing fees all the time. Further they're paying for all over the globe. So take a chill pill captain keyboard. All you've done is make your anger heard and words forgotten.
---
I like that spot
---
Oh jeez, it was somewhere on the forums in response to someone‚Äôs question. I think it was NotQueen that said it? I don‚Äôt think I could find it tho
---
Gaming monitors*
---
And that's without the point that even if PTB reaches only 1% of the base that's not nearly a stressing enough load for a proper test.
---
Have people on both killer and survivor team, 1 person has to be in spectating mode and as soon as everyone ready ups and you hear the heartbeat or whatever, the spectator changes team to killer. You CAN be Banned from doing this but I think it's ONLY if someone reports another for doing it.
---
Or jumped down and finished sabotaging it
---
Hit rank 12 today, I'm super happy! It aint much, but I never thought I'd get this far
---
Known bug, probably not bannable since players won't really be able to tell
---
Oh my. What an insult. My ego so severely bruised i cant continue. Maybe instead of trying to prove your own strawman incorrect think about what i said. They are the buisness and we the consumer. We are not here to do their testing for them. They can do internall testing if they cant afford a constant ptb or whatever. Also you claim its voluntary but then say you must persevere ? I guess its hard to make a sound argument when you are so far up bhvrs ass
---
Having no rank at least lead to "interesting" team compositions.
---
This, this just breaks the game.
---
Adrenaline is really toxic
---
I'm surprised bill haven't gotten your IP address
---
MAybe it‚Äôs a way to motivate more players to play as the killer. That‚Äôs my guess.
---
You have a choice it is voluntary. You just don't like the choice. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean you don't have a choice. Also again, this would have happened the second they implemented it because there is no way at all that the PTB is enough of a stress test. Also they did test it back in the Summer.
---
I just use devour hope, don‚Äôt have to spend 5000-7000 bp on a mori and doesn‚Äôt mean i just mori the first person who gets hooked
---
Swap Urban Evasion for Lightweight. I did that and I don't miss it
---
Edit: if you wanna go toxic, yeah, don't swap it. I thought you were looking for build tips
---
Dedicated servers are amazing
---
Huntress is the easiest killer to loop like this you lose chase. Can look at her stats and see that yourself
---
Toxic Freddy
---
Ok done
---
Why are killer main comments always so cringe?
---
I‚Äôve been using it for a few months on my pc and I haven‚Äôt noticed anything. Just make sure you have your anti virus software on, just in case.
---
you can get a lot of blood points without it. I sometimes can get up to 100k blood points in one match
---
Nice! Yeah, no ways I thought I'd be Rank 1 before the reset, been trying but so many crappy matches kept depipping me, but I finally prevailed! Looking forward to Prestige 3'ing my David as well so I can move onto Jake and the leaked Blight skin. XD
---
What choice exactly are talking about cause at this point i dont think we are talking about the same thing. The dedicated servers are currently live as a test. You cant choose to opt out. The only choice you have if you dont want to deal with them is to not play the game. Wich this post is actively shaming
---
TOTH notifies when any hex totem is worked on.
---
karma
---
When Jane Balanced Landings on you
---
It‚Äôs nice. We have it on PS4 but it‚Äôs useless because you can still message the player via the actual ps messages. Xbox Is the same, I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
It's definitely 100% bannable in public, don't know abour private. Idk about if it works now dedicated servers are on.
---
Once again, for the people in the back.
---
1) DEDICATED SERVER TESTING ON PTB WAS IN THE SUMMER.
---
2) THERE WAS NO WAY OTB TESTING WAS ENOUGH OF A LOAD TEST, when this went live this was going to happen.
---
3) Don't like it? Play something else till it fixes itself.
---
4) Your lack of awareness on the topic is not an excuse.
---
Amazing screenshot
---
Ok hold up, did you just settle an argument on the internet? Well done
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about swf, I‚Äôm just trying to compare them with spirit complaints in general
---
And Im not sure why it‚Äôs hard to believe I survive a lot of games against spirit... it‚Äôs called adapting to the killer
---
I know right 
---
/s
---
Tbf screenshots are horrible on console and you have to send it through a few steps to get it.
---
That literally never happens... ever
---
If the survivors had somehow trapped the killer in there then these comments would be a lot different lol.
---
Wasn‚Äôt really an argument though lol
---
I just thought the tactic was ok,  but then given the full situation it wasn‚Äôt XD
---
Self care is a shitty perk for god sake survivors use inner strengh or the perk of steve
---
Ehh still one of the least toxic encounters in this sub reddit lol
---
...
---
Why is saying cringe so cringe?
---
And I‚Äôm not exactly a killer main.  Considering bulk of my playtime is on survivor
---
I play about 4 survivor games for every 1 killer (both sides of this shitshow lol)
---
It's the best they can do so why wouldn't they? I like to run this build as a killer as well sometimes and if the survivors ignore (or just don't find) the Totem they ore most likely to be doomed \^\^'
---
Thank you. I didn't read that and I thought you suggested it's somehow consoles fault. I hope they will enable them soon. Did at least matchmaking got better?
---
So true
---
If you say so and I have an anti virus software.
---
Haha, check the 5 other posts I‚Äôm currently arguing with people in XD 
---
It‚Äôs amusing
---
For some people, yes. But the issue more so came from the fact that one person DC'd, because after one guy did, either another person followed suite, or someone else killed themselves.
---
Ya I also got same bug today, I sabotaged 2 hook but later I got killer daily instead. (Pc)
---
Change thrill for bbq and that is a pretty decent build
---
So it‚Äôs quite literally a random meme from my gallery that I felt like sharing. If that‚Äôs enough to get your pants in a bunch, then you, have serious issues. I mean, really? Name-calling and acting like a spoiled child over this? Get a life.
---
That was both hilarious and infuriating.
---
Freddy and spirit
---
You need to add a limit to the hex and obsession not doing anything is no bueno. Over time, they will become a beacon by the crows. Add a limit like they always suffer from blindness unless they unhook someone in which it‚Äôs passed on or something
---
My lack of awareness. Oh the irony. Yes dedicated servers were tested on summer. I tested them. They sucked. They postponed them becuase they needed to polish them. Currently there is a LIVE TEST going on that is even worse than the summer servers. This post is the op saying that we should suck it up and test bhvrs shit. Its shaming people that are quote-unquote "playing something else"( which btw did you do that on purpose becuase if you are refrencing Mcote just...gold).Of course the ptb wasmt enough for the stress test,but( im starting to feel like a broken record) we are not bhvrs testers. We are their consumers. Period. Its not our job to test their game. Its theirs. At this point im just saying the same thing and you arent addresing at all instead saying more and more ridulous things showing that you have no idea what this discussion is about
---
Yes, true. But as a normal human being, people do need to vent out, de-stress one way or another. I personally never do this but what I'm saying is, I understand where they're coming from. Unless a killer specifically says "I used these because fuck all y'all for no reason" or some shit, I like to think that they were just going through something and I'm unlucky enough to be in the way. Its fine, queue up and try again.
---
That was satisfying, shitting them down is the main priority.

You took the time to block a fellow survivor just to have what? Fun? Really dude, not nice.
---
The max BP from a match is 32k without an offering or bbq though.
---
The face really looks nothing at all like her. She's Japanese, not white.
---
Notifies when any totem, hexed or not is being worked on
---
Not at all. I'll just level up other characters first. Thanks for the advice btw
---
Whereas on PC you can just screenshot and post to Reddit. With low effort pics like this it's not always worth doing all that. (Especially if your PS4 is super slow)
---
I actually don't wanna focus on the aspect of it being a killer quest but just that it's changing. Have been noticing this for a few weeks now and its driving me insane! I don't like leaving a match intending my sweet bloodpoints just to get bamboozled by a new quest.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. Do you mean they have blindness until they unhook then the unhooked survivor gets the blindness?
---
Format?
---
You have no clue how game development works. Every game you play actively online you're a tester whether you realize it or not, because that's the nature of the beast. They can't find every bug in the code, nor can they expect to, and until it goes live they won't have the thoroughness to find it all. That's your lack of awareness. Even the most polished patch will miss shit and you refusing to acknowledge this was going to happen is your issue.
---
&gt; Gain a notification when someone starts working on a hex totem
---
You lose stacks when any totem is cleansed, but only notified for hexes being worked on
---
Ye.
---
Finally, some good fucking shit-posting
---
Ruin and Thrill would be dead by the time you fill EW3 with the hair tuft.
---
Its a trophy on console and some bloody cosmetics look nice
---
Trust me I know lol... as a solo queuer I‚Äôm used it it though
---
For crying out loud stop making strawman arguments. Finding bugs and TESTING are different things. You still arent responding to my main argument. If you dont have anything to add other than increasingly desparate attempts at "arguments" we are done here
---
Yeah, Sorry. I get carried away sometimes.
---
I get that and I wasn't necessarily talking to you specifically. That "you" was plural in the first paragraph. 
---
I always forget that consoles have the game too and I know the game's condition there is dreadful. Console team is different entirely but they need more people on that, for sure. 
---
And when I mentioned "your stance" then okay, I'm wrong on that, but that sentiment goes to those who's opinion you voiced.
---
Ok so the only reason they had to pay for the rights to ghostface is the name and the mask. Yes it is an original character, not an original killer because of it
---
I‚Äôm still confused. What do you mean by limit?
---
Fuck old legion lol. Rather play wraith on old blood lodge than to play against that garbage.
---
I did, you said we aren't play testers. I literally just responded. How about you stop Sea Lioning and come up with something else?
---
This is the best thing I've seen in this game.
---
This will never not be funny
---
It's not actually. Before you see it's ready to use.
---
not surprised that someone who is taking this game way too seriously while also having such an insane victim complex is a console killer.
---
Jane just reinforces my love for thick girls, and makes me think of Ashley Graham
---
Guys thanks for all the upvotes it‚Äôs my first post and I‚Äôm really glad you all like it! üòÅ
---
Happened to me too. Spent the last 3 days trying to open an exit gate with Steve...finally did it the other night, and the challenge switches to escaping with Jake.
---
Salt went through the roof
---
Back in my day you could complete a gen from 0 to 100 mid loop with a brand new part. That probably got you camped tho lol.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddph5j/people_who_choose_to_camp_why/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
i suppose it is, but I suppose devs make it to force survivors to do more than just gen rushing.
---
If you have a pc you could get it on there, while you wouldn‚Äôt have access to playing with them, you could still play and build your own characters regardless this way. And yes, you can use a spare controller and wire to plug it in to the computer depending on the computer and controller.
---
and this is why I run away from the action until its safe to save someone.
---
Rebuild the database when your PS4 gets slow. My PS4 wouldnt even load the messages screen until I rebuilt the database.
---
Anyways its just super low effort taking a bootleg screenshot from your phone. If you cant bother taking the 30 seconds extra effort then dont post.
---
Except that wouldn't be a thing because killers have a way to get past this, by hitting the survivor. Survivors can't do anything about being bodyblocked (by killers or survivors) except to just DC.
---
No for real, they release auric only cosmetics instead of fixing the game, Idc if they have a seperate team because they are still using resources to make bing bing wahoo Meme Dwight Clothes and Daddy Issue hair for the female survivors
---
I hate it when people dc man. I mean, why? When you get outplayed and you get downed in the first 30 sec of the game, Instead of wasting an additional, what 5 minutes? To get you hooked, 2nd hooked, and die, you effectively wasted every minute you used since you queued, waited in lobby, loading screen.
---
People prefer to do this, rather taking a loss like a man, or having a chance to win also giving your teammates a fighting chance.
---
Get nerfed bish
---
Mr. Killer I don't feel so good.
---
Anyway, back on topic, I suppose that is how dedicated servers work, they first make a team of survivors and then pair it with a killer.
---
But survivors body block hooks all the time, this is the same thing but on the other side
---
Why do the remaining survivors have to put up with it? I sure as hell won‚Äôt especially against a sweaty ass insta down hatchet Huntress. Fuck outta here with that lol
---
*Survivors didn't like that*
---
......you reaponded to me saying we arent play testers by saying that games have bugs. Im not sure if youre just trolling or legitimatly dont know how to make arguments. And on top of all of that you have the gal to say im repiting myself, when im doing that becasue you keep.Mising.The.Point.Like do you posses reading comprehension ? Honestly i have better things to do than argue with someone that hasnt even made eye contact with a legitimate argument in their life. If you wanna keep kissing bhvrs ass im not stopping you, but if you get enraged by someone pointing it out maybe its time you reconsider
---
Old deep wound was anything but great. Thats why it was changed. Maybe BHVR will actually attempt to make a good killer design this time with the rework instead of the absolute failure that was launch legion.
---
Freddy and Quentin trying to out-BM each other. Isn't that in-character?
---
Doesn‚Äôt even run away, just sits and teabags at every opportunity. What a power move
---
CROP MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?!
---
I made a kit concept for Jason once on this sub Reddit. One thing is clear between all the designs, he needs a way to sense survivors and sneak up on them. This one brings back some of the best features from his game.
---
Load testing, can't be done on PTB. This was going to happen. Shut up and get over yourself.

---
Because the kids on the subreddit got upset when they banned memes without relation to DBD. And reddit mods have no spine.
---
Example. EGC begins and a teammate gets hooked in the basement, body blocking the rescuing survivor and the unhooked survivor in the basement is fair game? Just because EGC was active doesn‚Äôt mean this isn‚Äôt exploiting something to their benefit. It‚Äôs cheap, and I would rather be face camped by bubba revving his chainsaw.
---
He looks like a giant sperm cell running around.  And then the way he enters the portals lmao
---
This is ascended last the level of a meme or shitpost; it is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of the postmodern era.
---
^mama ^mia
---
Honestly felt the same afterwards lol
---
Not deep wound or broken, but she has add-ons that apply mangled for 120 seconds. Also I've been told that Huntress hatchets can apply mangled from sloppy butcher with her hatchets. Keep in mind that if you run another addon instead of the infantry belt you aren't getting the +2 hatchets, so Iri heads brings you down to only 1 hatchet.
---
Whoa I was just quoting Matthew Mcconaughey man
---
Is it that hard for you to stay on point. What has what you said to do with what we are talking about ? You know what im done. Youre not taking me down with you sister. Enjoy this thread its yours now. If you want me to say you won so you can sleep at night fine. You won, youre right , bhvr is a perfect company and we should give em all our money and develop their game for them. They know exactly what they are doing and you know exactly what we are talking about
---
BM in return? It seems as if hes trying to prove a point, but what it looks like is hes as low as the freddy
---
2 people walk into a corner and cry when they are blocked. Forgot about rule number #342 - A killer must NEVER EVER think outside the box to secure kills
---
I had the same problem with Steve last night. I assumed that it was lag, but interesting we both had the same problem with the same character.
---
Right lol wtf is this guy saying trying to downplay how strong it is. If you vault a window, you‚Äôre fucked, you try to side step the window, you‚Äôre still fucked as she can just M1. Rarely can you pallet stun and rarely is it safe to try to do so. Very little counterplay when your in chase, and there simply isn‚Äôt any when it‚Äôs against a good Huntress. But I notice most Huntresses only use iri head when they‚Äôre against a SwF cuz they know they‚Äôre bad + need the advantage so they‚Äôre premature af with hatches and miss often. You don‚Äôt see Umbra running that shit
---
Played a bunch of games with this add-ons and nobody disconnected. I was so proud of this community for like 5 games before the usual toxicity began to show again. 
---
Disclaimer: I was about to prestige and I didn‚Äôt want to just throw away good add-ons and offerings
---
Thank you! Never doodled him before and I suck ass with proportions. May not be the best BUT for what it is it's not bad. c: feel free to check my other posts to see the rest if ya want.
---
Honestly no idea, one person left like soon as the match started lol I don't think they even knew what we were playing against
---
The dangers of going into an enclosed space.
---
I won't even allow a survivor to have a chance to sandbag me like this, because it has happened before. Best to stay out of there.
---
This is great!!!
---
Hahaha I would've been sooooo upset
---
Hag
---
Wow, you're really oblivious? "STOP TESTING DEDICATED SERVERS ON THE MAIN SERVERS THIS IS AN INCONVENIANCE BLAAARGH...."
---
This is a load test buddy. They need volume to stress the servers and figure things out.  Do you not understand the process from switching from peer to peer to dedicated servers?
---
Blumhouse operates similarly to 80s production houses of small movies. Most of them will undoubtedly bomb but they invest so little in them the loss is negligible. Then one actually becomes a hit and that keeps them going.
---
Those are both surivivor sided maps if the survivor knows the layout.
---
DLC should still be on sale on gamersgate. 55% off.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
We sat in this lobby for 10 minutes
---
Only way I can think of you catching up to her aside from her being slow is she's probably clipping corners or taking wider turns every loop and slows her down even more.
---
I just went through your comment history and I am really sorry for you. Apparently you didn't get enough love IRL and now you spread toxicity on the internet. I genuinely hope you get better
---
For me yes. The needle is a lot smoother.
---
Also a lot less BS hatchet hits
---
Yeah but still the others were just standing there and he ignored them until I i died. Its in the video.
---
Anytime someone says ‚Äúggez‚Äù I just reply with ‚Äúu seem like a really nice person‚Äù and leave üòÇ
---
Oh that went right over my head, I was a little Dazed and Confused
---
If you put on hope huntress is only 3% faster than you when active. Literally slower than a T1 Myers chasing a sprinting survivor.
---
Also, what a high effort post lmao
---
5 minutes is a lot of time, and my time is limited and I want to spend it in a fun casual game, not with a bunch of uber competitive people.
---
Also, at least for survivor, it takes like 1 minute to get in a game, not much time is lost. And I'd rather take the L on that one minute then bend over for 5 minutes waiting for my inevitable death agaisnt an unfun build
---
Damn.
---
i do
---
Quality so good, my internet doesn‚Äôt load
---
Increase hatchets to 3 since iri heads decrease Hatchets to 1
---
Depends on the Situation. If you are next to a gen which is almost finished, you shouldn't cleanse it, because if you are able to finish the Gen, the Demogorgon has now a worthless Portal he can't replace. 
---
If it's right next to a gen you want to start you should consider cleansing it, as the Demogorgon is able to detect Survivors who are close to it.
---
You invest 36 seconds in healing yourself. Then if you get chased for 12 seconds, its already even.
---
Self-care is one of the fastest way to heal. If you run to a teammate and get healed for 18 seconds, you already lost time. If you get healed by a teammate for 18 right as the killer stops chasing you, its as quick as you self-caring for 36 seconds.
---
If you self-care for 36 seconds, your teammate would have gotten 36% on a gen.
---
If your teammate heals you for 18 seconds, you two would have reached 36% after another 18 seconds.
---
But youd actually get less than 36% because the speed doesnt double. So its actually faster if you self-care yourself next to a teammate doing a gen. Its just less safe
---
He means that a perk like this is horrendously OP as it is. 
---
A perk that would make a survivor useless until another survivor becomes useless is too strong. 
---
Have the debuff have a time limit, but the obsession pass along. Nothing game breaking, but long enough to be inconvenient. 
---
Otherwise it would go right alongside hex: ruin in most killers kits.
---
A p3 spirit player told me it was bad.
---
For a second I was like ‚Äúwho tf is Natalie?‚Äù
---
I just always instantly leave, because no matter if it was good or bad or exciting theres always a chance that someone will say sth like ez etc. and by leaving and thus ignoring them you hurt them far more than you ever could by reports or responding
---
I play on PC. While playing as The Wraith, I used the offering that allows me to play as The Pig for one game. It didn‚Äôt work. I was the Wraith for that game instead. I thought oh just a weird glitch that‚Äôs fine. Until I get out and see that I‚Äôve selected the Pig as the killer I‚Äôm playing as for the next game. I do not own the Saw DLC, and the killer still shows that it‚Äôs locked on killer selection, yet The Pig is still selected. I was able to put points into The Pig‚Äôs bloodweb. What has happened?
---
Edit: I played a game as The Pig thinking the problem would go away once I do what the offering was supposed to let me do. Nope. I‚Äôm still The Pig.
---
I switched my killer back to Wraith, and it doesn‚Äôt let me choose The Pig anymore, but this glitch or coding error could be taken advantage of in some way I bet.
---
The Huntress could've just stayed with those kind of potato players haha
---
Can we all agree that the swamp maps are a pile of fucking junk?
---
By far the most underrated skin of all, they even put effort into her exposed ribcage and outward facing ribs. Hag gets some really great skins
---
Steve wouldn‚Äôt agree.
---
a killer will think to equip franklin‚Äôs when the lobby has items. just do a 6 second swap and u will be fine..
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. Even when it was a really good game and I compliment them they just insult me so now I just don‚Äôt respond
---
There are 2 reasons I'd do this as a killer. First would be if they were just following me around and basically just letting themselves get hit. It's no fun so I just save them for the end of the match. The other reason is if I just went in for a daily and don't care if they get away or not.
---
They couldn't do much with plague because she is literally made by putrid bubbles in her default skin lol
---
Susie was given r e s t
---
Realllllyyyyy cool but alliance looks a bit on the op side
---
It's even more sad when people don't have any idea what an hitbox is, but still crying about it..
---
It's embarrassing to Google DbD hitbox and see thousand of results from people bitching about it and have no idea it's a latency issue. /:
---
This is the clown
---
You really got him. That teabag must've crushed him... til he put you back on the hook and continued BMing you.
---
I don‚Äôt think this is what the community meant when they asked for shirtless clown.
---
It seems so
---
Meta, no. It's a good perk to counter tunneling though.
---
I am almost 1000 miles from the League of Legends US server and I get 40 ms. I don't know why the ping is so bad in this case. Maybe it tried connecting you to another server because the Virginia one was full.
---
I would consider a perk that i encounter on at least 2 person a game meta.
---
I didn't have hope.
---
This took actually quite some effort. I usually don't do any video editing. I blurred the names, changed the perk icons, manually tracked her eyes for a couple of seconds,  to make them red. 
---
30+ Minutes
---
the one in necro crafts video has this orange tinge to the emission tiles .. i couldnt find any specific to her so i used the generic .. yeah byfar the underrated of the lot but it looks pretty cool in game though witha ll the dripping goo and stuff.
---
It's a trick question. 99% of people crying about hitbox can't tell the difference between hitbox and latency
---
Face is almost like young Adiris, I like what they did with it. Seems like they tried to keep it consistent with her base skin while giving it a Halloween makeover, the result is impressive.
---
You can't gen rush anymore. That argument doesn't work.
---
Occasionally I might turn around while phase walking as spirit and see my own husk üòÇ
---
Not if you're a p3 claudette they arent. ;)
---
I kind of Meta literally fucking can't though. Matchmaking is taking 10+ minutes and every time I get into a game it boots me out during the loading screen, dedicated servers have literally made the game unplayable for me
---
Seems like the pieces will look better with clothing from different sets than it looks with the original.
---
I havent had any issues with it. Are you sure it's not a freddy, his lullaby no longer counts as terror radius so if you are asleep and go for an unhook BT doesnt work
---
Legion was an excuse to buff borrowed time several times and you can't change my mind.
---
that's lame. I have one for the shape for if I get bored, I assumed you would have gotten their character perks at least.
---
Cool concept 
---
I can imagine clown being busted with hex: dark ritual especially with his add ons that cause status effects.
---
Yes, exactly
---
1) oblivious means you're not in killer's terror radius therefore if you are asleep BT will not work
---
2,3) Dedicated servers 
---
4) shitty autoaim
---
I swear ruin does that constantly or something
---
hub caps?
---
Lol
---
I use survivor more than killer.  That‚Äôs actually when beads are the most fun for me... I like to be immersed and have actual panic 
---
Myers, pig, spirit, ghostface etc are so fun
---
*uh ghostbusters?*
---
I played against a nurse who brought a secret offering and didn‚Äôt have Ruin. I was the only survivor she hooked, and I hopped in a locker to make her pick me up. She decided to bring me to a hook. The last gen pops so I have adrenaline. Little miss nurse slaps my Jeff savior and lo and behold NOED. The noed totem spawned right next to a door. I was lucky enough to run her around the map long enough for my team to pick up Jeff, break NOED, and get a door open without taking a hit.
---
A bite for the Entity
---
What were you doing in there in the first place. Like who hides in corners after rank 15
---
Not just a little. It's a fucking epidemic of bullshit. 
---
DC if fighting Nurse.
---
DC if fighting Spirit. 
---
DC if fighting one hatchet Huntress. 
---
DC if found first.
---
DC if hooked first. 
---
DC if other survivor DC.
---
This game desperately needs a DC-timer like Counterstrike or League of Legends to prevent people from ragequitting constantly. I feel like only 1 out of 10 games I play actually have a legit 4-man game for survivors, it's frustrating as hell.
---
Dont worry I'll be your backup
---
No one:
---
Half of this subreddit:
---
I will never give a shit about your whining over this as long as 4 man SWF with 2 stage instaheals exist. Cry me a river
---
No, it is not reportable, yes the killer doing this makes them an asshole. The fact that you can do this is why there should be a minor rework of the bodyblock system. Make it so if a survivor is pushing against a killer for 3 seconds then they will lose collision or something. The kind of thing that isn't ever going to happen unless there is a niche situation like this.
---
And then there's people like Umbra who refuse to use add-ons
---
I hate getting these for killers I have at level 1.
---
Yup. Even if there was a hitbox issue, we wouldn't be able to tell because of the latency. When I do get into low ping games I don't run into problems.
---
Yeah, if you‚Äôd had hope it would‚Äôve been you chasing her lol
---
Do you make videos or was this just for the hell of it?
---
Why are bringing this up? She‚Äôs a bigger girl, yes, but everyone knows she‚Äôs still pretty.
---
What a bad take
---
And you killed it he needs to be 115 base or as he has nothing in chase

Yeah it's not freddy. I play freddy alot so I know that much. This has happened against several killers(hag, billy and leather face) and the most recent one was a baby ghostface a second after he hooked the person which he wasn't crouched or anything, had the heartbeat and he was literally tickling my butt as I unhooked the person. I just dunno why the perk isn't activating
---
So does booze hound even do anything
---
When the knife hits your spine and you bleed out and die, that's a mori
---
PS4, Broken Healer trophy is still unobtainable.
---
Dead confused on how you dealt with him
---
Nice meme.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. I get a daily that I don‚Äôt like (hitting with nurse) and recycle it. I get a cooperative action daily. I load up as survivor and play a game where I get some coop action. I check my dailies and all of a sudden I have a doctor daily instead. This has happened twice now.
---
We weren‚Äôt hiding, at all. That being said, neither of us are amazing at the game, tbh - we play to have fun. And I already admitted that mistakes were made on our part, too.
---
What happened was that my friend got downed there in that spot, the killer disappeared so I went to heal her, Pig sneaked back and instead of downing me there while my friend was still down, he blocked us there for the remainder of the match.
---
dude wtf lol
---
That's a pretty toxic thing to tell someone.. maybe you're the problem with the community.
---
All the dude said was "yea i'm not gonna DC against OP stuff, but i'm not gonna bother trying too hard when I just want to move on to a fun game."
---
Like.. sorry the dude wants to have fun I guess?
---
I'd say you're not very fun at parties but I assume you don't even get invited.
---
The first day the stranger things DLC dropped my first killer I went up against was a huntress with this load out and a ebony... who the fuck is evil enough to torture new players like that?
---
I thought posting a video would be boring for me, so I spiced it up a bit. I edit videos rarely, usually just for fun
---
I'm sure his/her teammates will have so much fun with him not trying lol
---
Ooh that makes sense
---
But...
---
Then he gets you in the end and can continue to bm? 
---
If that‚Äôs how to deal with them then shit, maybe I should start bming survivors, they will let me rehook them lol
---
Me too. I had to make a guide so won't waste ages to explain that's the problem and not the hitboxes..
---
Some people are really dense. Maybe they never played old games with hosts before that uses P2P connections
---
Huntress
---
Bum clenching escape
---
Neither of them are ranged, both of them have a long charge time, can be played around with pallets.
---
Leatherface's chainsaw is so weak I don't even know why you even put it here, it's working against your argument.
---
Ez hatch
---
When I teabag in exit gates, it is typically as a celebration with other survivors. If the killer is there, I stand there without teabagging and wait to get hit so I can get more BP. People who teabag killers in exit gates are probably toxic though.
---
She's 110%, top speed is 115%.
---
What did he say? He deleted his account.
---
I definitely read  ‚Äúan irl huntress‚Äù &amp; then started to imagine having to really be chased by a giant lady chucking axes at me in the woods while singing a lullaby.
---
because you got caught
---
Fun for survivors, you mean.
---
Exactly, im a survivor main and the fact people are calling this exploits and talking about reporting is ridiculous, you are the morons that got yourselves into that situation.
---
When you play with bots in tf2 and they have unoriginal names.
---
I have noticed slight hitches when breaking pallets and kicking gens, kind of like you stick to them. Anyone else had this? Apart from that dedicated servers have been okay for me.
---
Felt so good!!!
---
Go to truetalent on YouTube he‚Äôs a streamer that does every kind of build and you‚Äôll learn a lot about how to play killer
---
Okay wtf I must admit that's weird, as I'm actually convinced it wasn't like that all the time. Maybe it was also just bugged the first patches, but at the very beginning I didn't like the perk for that particular reason.
---
Plus, thanks to the 40 sec duration, you were enforced to head to the most progressed gen ALWAYS immadietely after hooking.
---
But if that actually ain't the case anymore, I'll take back what I said, then it's actually really good.
---
The upper body will go well with the dirty jeans and L4D head (would have been better with the bearded one but BHVR messed up that one).  I hope the vial lights up and swings left and right as you move though.
---
Lol someone has hurt you with insta heals huh. Far from crying, insta heals and SWF isn‚Äôt exploiting game mechanics.
---
Yea the fun isn't going to be hurt by the prayer beads spirit or whatever OP set up the killer is using, its gonna be killed by the guy who isn't putting in 100% effort. /s
---
It's not like the guy said he was going to stand in a corner collecting crows until the killer hooks him.
---
This wouldn't be so hard to counter if the hitboxes weren't sometimes drunk
---
It is licensed. Just not from Scream. They got it from the company that makes the mask.
---
Nope it‚Äôs just first come first serve could be a killer in lobby waiting for awhile or survivors wait
---
Maybe it depends on rank and platform, I'm on xbox and I've had months off to I was 19 and even now I'm only 13
---
Gonna be honest
---
I would say gg to that because of just how rare that kind of thing is.
---
Both from a killer and survivor perspective.
---
&gt;DC if other survivor DC.
---
If the game is a 3v1 5 gens from the very start then I can definitely see why people wouldn't really want to play it out. It's not enjoyable for both sides. I often dc as killer if one of the survivors DCs early on because those matches are usually just not worth it.
---
&gt;DC if fighting Nurse.
---
&gt;DC if fighting Spirit. 
---
If it's a 3 blink nurse with range or spirit with spicy add ons I can definitely see why they wouldn't want to give their all that match. It's pretty bs to play against and not at all enjoyable if the player playing them is decent. Nurse and Spirit do not care how good at survivor you are, they are entirely dependent on the ability of the killer to pilot them (and a decent headset when it comes to spirit).
---
&gt;This game desperately needs a DC-timer like Counterstrike or League of Legends to prevent people from ragequitting constantly.
---
I mean both sides DC pretty frequently and taking it away would just make way less people play this game. There is a ton of unbalanced bs in this game that is still around from the early days of the release despite tons of people complaining about it.
---
Moris, syringes, haddonfield, old ds was up for a really long time, Instasaw, iri head, hostage doc (luckly that's bannable), spirit, etc.
---
It's probably mostly young folks hearing about hitbox complaints from other games, and assuming they apply here.
---
Take my upvote! üòÇ
---
oh man, i'm dying. Ilove dbd and ac
---
BhVR states it‚Äôs bannable period! Anyone caught doing this glitch in kill your friends or ranked games will be banned...
---
this happens to me on PS4 as well
---
your full of shit, its literally impossible without bbq and an offering(s) to get past like 30~k
---
Well, great minds think alike I guess
---
Because rather than retype my comment I could answer the same question several people were asking.
---
And I'm not saying they won't be fixed, I'm sure they will work on it, but they always take forever to fix stuff like this.
---
I don't know where you got me saying people are wrong from, the guy asked what were problems people were having and I listed the problems I had experienced.  I didn't say he was wrong for having no problems, just having a discussion.
---
And matchmaking is one of the problems with the servers so that is highly relevant.
---
I think you misinterpreted the tone of my comment, I'm not saying anyone here is wrong, just that the game has been noticeably worse since servers went live for many people, myself included.
---
If he goes for someone else, the others are gona rescue you. = Probs no kill secured.
---
That's why
---
This happens almost every single time I trade out dailies on PC
---
I dont know how it would be posible to do this in public though, the screen is only in custom matches
---
&gt; I mean, why?
---
Coz 3 blinks with range, spirit's add ons, instasaw, haddonfield, syringes, etc. aren't really thrilling to go against and they'd rather queue up for another match that will be way more fun.
---
&gt;When you get outplayed
---
If you are actually calling getting downed by 3 blink nurse with range, instasaw or getting looped on broken structures with balanced landing and syringe "getting outplayed", then that's good for you. To me that's broken bs that's carrying you against me, not you playing better.
---
&gt;you effectively wasted every minute you used since you queued, waited in lobby, loading screen.
---
They won't be having any fun in the match if they stay, so why stick around?
---
I‚Äôd be terrified
---
Yeah, that sounds about right
---
There was (maybe is still) an exploit involving quickly switching which could get 4 killers in a public game.
---
This is the fog where the entity says what works and what don‚Äôt, spongebob me boy! Argargarg!
---
Word I‚Äôm going to bring an ebony Mori into every one of my matches today dank
---
Only ever used one once before
---
You have the right to vent, they have the right to avoid dealing with you during that time.
---
i like revan in the background
---
neat
---
Just strictly run the killer, don‚Äôt do anything else, you will also get better at looping and running the killer around. Bring a flashlight it helps, even if your shit with it, Your friends or randoms will hopefully bang the gens out while you keep the killer occupied, if you escape great but if you die, you die, Depip....
---
Yeah I suppose that is true, but the increased latency there is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
I think they should show every players ping now instead of just your own, that would be simple to implement and help people understand what's going on.  They already have ability to do it since all survs show their individual ping to the killer.
---
But they definitely need to work on these issues before dedicated servers take over completely
---
This made me laugh. Love it. xD
---
Assasins creed steve
---
You do you. Your job is to kill not exploit, so go fucking kill some salty survivors instead of being wrong on reddit.
---
DS is fine, it's actually a well designed perk as it is now.  
---
My argument is it's proc'ing when grabbing a survivor from a locker. The perk is designed to punish killers who purposely tunnel, but it's impossible to know when the survivor is hidden in the locker who it is.
---
Well that's what happens when you play nurse
---
I know your question has been answered but I will post further clarifying information:
---
If you buy the DLC from steam/ps4/Xbox you get access to play as the killer and/or survivor included. Some DLC are survivor only and some are killer only, but most include one of each. 
---
If you purchase a DLC character using the in game store, you only get the character you purchased. 
---
If you purchase a killer (such as Michael Myers) without purchasing the entire DLC, you can still get an ultra rare offering in your bloodweb that will allow you to play as a DLC killer you don‚Äôt have the DLC for. This translates to getting an offering to play as Michael Myers in Michael Myers bloodweb, because you don‚Äôt own the full DLC. This ultra rare offering only shows up for licensed killers. (I will admit the only evidence I have for this is as of an old patch, so it might be fixed)
---
Lastly, the original responder is correct: as soon as a new DLC is added to the game, any map included in that DLC can now be playable for all players.
---
Do you want the blood cosmetics? If yes then yes. If no then well no
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddq3jm/if_pennywise_is_added_what_should_his_moris_be/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Yeah.. can't agree more
---
Not really, its just for fun because people like to grind. Worth it, no. Fun, yes. And if you like the bloody cosmetics, go for it
---
Only if you want the bloody cosmetics
---
Can you choose which cosmetic you get or is it random?
---
Lol I've seen so many killers DC my dude, and when they DC the game ends for EVERYONE. Least when 1 survivor DCs you do still have a chance to win, it's just harder. Players, on both sides, need to grow a god damn spine
---
Can you choose which cosmetic you get?
---
I hate this killer so much.
---
because i constantly see people saying that shes not fat.
---
There‚Äôs a new mechanic called Oblivious, don‚Äôt know much about this mechanic but it counters BT hardcore.
---
THIS IS BETTER THAN THE NURSE ITS A AMAZING MEME 10/10
---
No Problem dude
---
Everyone gets the same 1 per prestige level
---
First you get the knife, second you get the body, third you get the mask
---
Ok thank you
---
Yes.
---
It‚Äôs in order. I think it‚Äôs bloody knife, bloody jumpsuit and then bloody mask
---
Why is the horse named invincible if you can see it lmao how dumb
---
Not nearly as broken as other killers in this game. I actually enjoy playing against insta down huntress, it raises the stakes of hatchet dodging and any good survivor can dodge multiples before they get hit anyway. Iri Heads are only OP against shity survivors that dont look behind themselves during chases. Sure, its strong, but calling it "broken af" when killers like Billy and Nurse and Spirit exist in the game is just silly
---
Why does it even matter what they were doing there? Body blocking to the point that they‚Äôre unable to play the game fairly is unacceptable.
---
Except Ash, who goes: torso, legs, hand.
---
You get the knife then the body then the face.
---
Myers has one of the better looming bloody cosmetics tbh.
---
If you ever do decide to prestige I suggest using every bloodpoint offering Myers has before you do it so you can get to a high level quickly.
---
Me when I down someone playing as jane.
---
For a second I thought that was a DBD mobile screenshot.
---
I mean you can‚Äôt blame me though that‚Äôs what the UI look like
---
Pfft 2.3k hours in dbd and I have given so much info and criticism to the devs and instead of them fixing it, they go out and focus on conventions, cosmetics and licensed chapters. Don't get me wrong, I like all this new content, but nothing kills the content more than facing the constant bugs and bs mechanics in dbd.
---
Only the highest quality content.
---
No, but the older horror with the same name was
---
I love Nancy too
---
Fungoose or Otzdarva. Tru3 is the worst to learn from, he makes the game feel like poop and he'll guide you to spirit or nurse in the end
---
not really
---
Cause it‚Äôs a shitty post.
---
hours and hours into the doctor and i still do this to myself
---
Body blocking a hook doesn‚Äôt prevent the killer from getting a chance to actually play the game. Survivors also can be harmed while body blocking. It‚Äôs not even. Killers may lose the person on their shoulder but they‚Äôre given the chance to down the survivor body blocking. While a killer body blocking for a prolonged period of time where the survivor can do literally nothing but stand there to the point that they have 3 crows is completely uncalled for and not similar at all.
---
It's a free for all game, the goal is to escape no matter what. That's why the advice is to gen rush.
---
So.. instead of an useful effect (insta down with 1 hatchet) a deep wound is better? An useless effect that takes 10s to be removed and useless in chases..
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for the title, I would‚Äôve never known she didn‚Äôt have borrowed time.../s
---
That's a spicy meatball
---
Ring around the Rosie.....
---
This really reminds me of that scene from "Scary Movie" where a girl looped Ghostface around a kitchen table with a huge cake in the middle.
---
When did the game go from a teamwork based game to a free for all?
---
Eh to each his own.
---
His a mix one part is licensing one isn't
---
It's a teamwork game with friends, but when in public you don't know these people so you have to save yourself.
---
wait a minute we are smarter than this
---
You get the bloody clothes (knife, body and mask per prestige, in that order) and start to get better stuff in your tree.
---
Just remember you lose all your stuff when you prestige, so use all you have and save bp to level up again :)
---
I will try again.
---
Is it normal that you have to completely close the game via task manager? This always happens, which makes Discord and  Steam think I have played for a straight 24 hours, making my friends think I am still busy.
---
Best comment
---
She is loud as fuuck
---
Yeah smh, i'm sick of these trash kids wanting to have fun.
---
Wdym by "get better stuff in the tree"?
---
Get better at beeing a survivor. If you don't get downed then he can't camp you.
---
i had faster games i usaly log in and blink twice and get the same result lol
---
and for ppl complaining about no BP ... well its sucks for most ppl but prob not for this guy  
---
is prob p3 is survivors now
---
Right, bunch of entitled pieces of garbage.
---
I play Hag with Lullaby, Ruin, Devour, and HG. 
---
I call it the Hex: Go Fuck Yourself.
---
Nooooooooooo
---
Yes it was lol
---
Then give the servers to console. We would be glad for those servers atm
---
Weird. Try it with other characters, and record a video and send it to the devs.
---
Nice! I found both a dark green sweater and dark pale blue jeans at kohls and decided to buy both
---
I only do that when I am afk
---
I wish they'd do something about trapping like that maybe remove collision after 30 seconds or something
---
Who dat fine lady over there üòò
---
Inner Strength be like:
---
Honestly, just keep playing and practicing. Hone your mind game skills.
---
Russian Roulette Spirit build
---
I did it and regret it. The items really aren't any better. And innate the bloody cosmetics. They need to buff prestige...
---
I just used it because it's relatable. I don't care if it's old.
---
There‚Äôs a reason survivors have 3 hooks each. Even if you‚Äôre a godly survivor as long as the killer isn‚Äôt too terrible he can get at least one down.
---
If he tunnels me and only me for five minutes with a trap on my head how am I supposed to survive? 
---
I understand it‚Äôs possible to do good in circumstances but it‚Äôs impossible to be the illisible master and just nuke your way out for twenty minutes.
---
r/entitledsurvivors
---
Nice profile stalking lol. You must feel like a real detective huh?
---
What do the spooky items do?
---
Yeah, and I appropriate you guys for that! :)
---
It's definitely not top tier and it will become significantly weak once all stealth Killers gain the Undetectable Status Effect.
---
Removed we ask you take part in this sub before posting videos
---
Thx
---
Needs to be severe queue delay for DC's, like 30 minutes on first offense.  
---
It's becoming a huge problem, even outside of stuff like Iri heads.
---
What do you expect him to do? Give up the kill when the gates are open?
---
Deep wound sucks it kinda does nothing imo its like u hit them with it and u continue chase as normal which u would do anyways with out a expensive add-on orrr u leave em and its just ten secs added to a heal. Just make it to where it u cant stack it to get three insta hachets and itll be fine imo bc either the huntress is pretty good and lands the shot with one hachet or there not as good and spend most of the round getting said hachets.
---
You say survivors are entitled but with killers having atleast 80% of the daily rituals and the entitlement attitude they have a lot of the time, I don‚Äôt get your point
---
So a ranged instant down that can travel 4x faster than a running Survivior isn't OP in general? Fat lmao. 
---
The only thing that makes it any semblance of balanced is that it leaves you with only one hatchet but that weakness is cut by infantry belt. 
---
That's why it needs to Trump all other add-ons so you can't get 2 or 3 instadown hatchets.
---
Who said you had the right to choose
---
All I could think was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Batman‚Äù when we caught a glimpse of him before the hook
---
Someone should add the eagle sound when he jumps down lol.
---
Same problem.  Hitboxes feel like shit because they are shit but also feel like shit because latency happens and makes them worse.
---
Hitboxes are bad though, and it's most notable on 1 hit killers.
---
Haha this was great.
---
Don't forget getting rewarded for being bad.
---
It's relatable. So why the fuck not.
---
Survivors overwhelmingly DC more often than Killers. Glad to know you're defending people who ruin the game for 4 others by not being able to handle certain killers or strategies. Imagine if Killers DCed every time a survivor used DS, fucking please
---
Last time someone had Franklin's only 2 of us brought items.
---
That‚Äôs what I was hoping for lol
---
Because if I have to ‚Äúheal a survivor as ____‚Äù 1 more time I‚Äôm going to uninstall, I rarely play trapper but if I get a daily for him it‚Äôs a nice change of pace. Killers are unique characters, survivors are just skins. Also this ‚Äúentitlement attitude‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about is exactly how you‚Äôre acting
---
imagine if you didnt know steve was there. random steve falling from the sky to rescue you
---
Yeah, I seen the same thing happen to a guy with mikey
---
I suppose you're right. 
---
...But really would have appreciated strawberry.
---
I mean, it's fine if you can't get it, but I really like it.
---
yeah, i think tommy would be a better choice
---
Definitely survivors, not even close. In my experience most of the time killers are toxic it is just a response to the survivors‚Äô toxicity.
---
Probably SWF.
---
Maybe it should work like the key's addon what lets you keep the key if you die. It despawn with the player, your item should do the same.
---
wow you are fucked up and a piece of shit
---
DS and 3 blinks or yakuyoke amulet aren't even close to being comparable, what are you on about? One has clear ways to play around them, the others are straight up unbalanced.
---
&gt;Glad to know you're defending people who ruin the game for 4 others by not being able to handle certain killers or strategies.
---
I recognize why they do it and what are some of the problems that are plaguing this game. If the guy playing 3 blinks nurse is competent, there isn't anything the survivor can do. It's not on the player's ability to play survivor. Trust me, the other 3 survivors aren't having fun either.
---
&gt;Survivors overwhelmingly DC more often than Killers.
---
There are also 4 times more survivors than killers, the pool is bigger + most of the bs stuff survivors had got patched out. Multiple blinks, moris, iri head and instasaw are still going strong, while BNPs, flashlights, old ds, mettle of men, vaults, pallets, healing and maps all got nerfed.
---
Yeah because you can LITERALLY SEE IT COMING TOWARDS YOU, move your fat ass and you wont get hit. I've had games against Huntress where not a single hatchet has hit me. Look behind you as you run, you not only see her wind up before hand but you literally see the direction she's facing before she throws it. The fact you think dodging one of the most predictable abilities in the entire game is hard is a fat lmao.
---
Also, your flair is a prestige nurse, dont even talk about how huntress is OP when you literally negate mechanics of the game with your killer of choice lol.
---
Amanda wanted her end game back so bad she didn't care what price she had to pay for it.
---
Why did she not set traps lol
---
He wasn‚Äôt the hero they deserved, but the hero they needed.
---
Well then we‚Äôre even, but not a one way street.
---
And I‚Äôd gladly like to trade, as with a weeks worth of rituals, I‚Äôve gotten survivor one once, and then the pc is glitched and it changes
---
This is it. This is the peak of Dead By Daylight memes, congrats!
---
 Only killers are complaining because they don't have lag advantage anymore
---
"I'm stealthy. Like a ninja" (o - o)b
---
Hash slinging hasher for killer
---
Yeah nurse is really hard to play now and glitches out constantly. I have over 2k hours in the game and barely got a 2k with her earlier today and a swf was calling me a baby killer and such. Do survivors not see blinks glitching out constantly? Not to mention the weird speed up you get and the blinks that go nowhere randomly.
---
and yet the only 2 viable killers are spirit and nurse.
---
&gt;Yeah because you can LITERALLY SEE IT COMING TOWARDS YOU, move your fat ass and you wont get hit
---
Okay so by that logic, Nurse is balanced because you can see her coming. 
---
&gt;I've had games against Huntress where not a single hatchet has hit me.
---
Congrats. 
---
&gt;Look behind you as you run, you not only see her wind up before hand but you literally see the direction she's facing before she throws it. The fact you think dodging one of the most predictable abilities in the entire game is hard is a fat lmao.
---
If it's as easy as you say it is, Huntress wouldn't be considered the 4th best killer in the game, above Hag Myers and Ghostface. She used to be one of the top 3 until Spirit came out too. 
---
&gt;Also, your flair is a prestige nurse, dont even talk about how huntress is OP when you literally negate mechanics of the game with your killer of choice lol.
---
Where here have I said Nurse isn't OP? She is most definitely too strong but that's not the topic of discussion here. Stop moving the goal post
---
Mqy I just remind thats theres 4 of you in third person and one of them in first person. And yet they still lose.
---
(Xbox) Right after completing a match as a survivor i get a loading screen then sent back to the startup menu (not main menu with custom games, killer, survivor) and receive a message saying I do not own this content (I'm still able to log back in and play). Im not sure if this is a licence issue between Xbox gamepass and my bought online copy of the game, but it's been happening every so often and I do not receive bloodpoints but I get ranked up. This could also be something to do with the killer disconnecting right when the match ends, but I don't think so because I dont get an error saying you have lost connection.
---
If post game chat bothers you, in the end game screen if you close the chat for one match it should stay closed until next login. Otherwise, just keep playing and try to shrug it off. We were all bad once (some of us, aka me, still are!) and how you portray winning or losing depends on you. 
---
For me? All 4 BBQ stacks and practicing mind games satisfies me. I run a full blood point build with BBQ, Distressing, Thrill of the Hunt and Beast of Prey. Games go by quick with no Gen protection and I usually max out 2-3 categories. I go in expecting 0 kills and just practice chases. I don't rank up often but for me this is perfectly fine as I think I'm right at the rank I should be for now. 
---
If you are more interested in 4king or ranking up, then a great piece of advice is knowing when to give up on a chase. Obviously the longer a chase is the more time someone else has to do gens, so sometimes it's better to give up on one survivor and finding another than it is to keep chasing. If you don't care about winning of course you can use the time to chase the really good survivor and try to learn how to beat whatever it is they're doing. This can help for the future but you could also come out with nothing learned. 
---
I know it's not God tier advice but it's all things that help me. Because you're the killer, you're the one who is supposed to be in control. It won't always be that way and that's perfectly fine. Killer can be stressful and if you're not enjoying it, take a break.
---
All in all the most important thing is trying to have fun. If something traditional isn't fun to you, make your own playstyle! Just don't face camp. That's no fun for anyone.
---
See you in the fog!
---
You know who i think will work though, the juggernaut from 13 ghosts.
---
First one got taken down. Downloaded a app and some dbd stuff so hopefully it‚Äôs not unrelated this time.
---
Ended up against one as bubba, was chasing down a Quentin that had adrenaline rush and tbagged me. I laughed my ass off soon as he did? as he went down in one mallet swing thanks to noed.
---
I'll start by saying, I agree. Facecamping isn't fun, especially for the survivor. It's usually a technique used by newer killers, but it can happen when a killer if salty for some reason, or just invested too much time chasing you (or if the survivor was BMing, but that's a different topic altogether). As you progress through the ranks, it happens less and less.
---
The whole "do gens" mentality while the killer facecamps is to punish the killer for playing that way. Yes, it sucks for the person on the hook, but to most killers, one kill isn't enough for them to feel like it's a win. It's an attempt to teach the killer that they will not win if they play like that.
---
That said, I hate leaving someone on the hook, if I know them or not. I'm willing to trade just so they get off the hook. Do I feel like I am rewarding the killer for camping? Sometimes, I guess, especially if I get downed without making the save.

I'm not sure how long you've been playing, but for me I eventually got over the whole facecamping thing. Now I just laugh when the killer is dumb enough to camp the hook, and I struggle every second I can just to waste their time. It's one game, and then you move on to the next. That's one of the best things about this game. The shit from the last game doesn't matter as soon as you start a new one.
---
the fact that you are comparing body blocking a hook to this just proves you have a -1000000 IQ
---
Brand new part, Insta heal, many survivor items are present that also make the game bullshit, (remember mettle of man lol), imo the skill ceiling for killer is way higher when it's 1 v 4 so justifiably so a good killer should be able to run over survivors. Even then a strong swf can still shit on you given the map and the layout, RNG is still huge in this game. Tired of Survivor players whining in my games when I'm literally running yellow addons on huntress and they get run over, the entitlement never stops.
---
He's using his eagle vision
---
Maybe the hatch could spawn _and_ open by default in 60 seconds, and the timer is reduced 5/10 secs for each completed gen. That way the killer and the survivor have the same chance to find it.
---
Of course this wont stop the slugging, but it could counter what you said about d/c plus that teammate that camps the hatch and let you die.
---
Yeah , when I playing him I really need to resist the urge to chase. With T1's movement speed reduction, it just takes too long to catch someone.
---
1; you're completely ignoring the fact Nurse can go through objects, so no, it's not following the same path of logic. Hatchets cannot go through walls or pallets and its dumb you even made that comparison.
---
2; Thanks bud
---
3; Her being 4th best is subjective and debatable, shes only above hag/myers/ghostface BECAUSE her ability is ranged. If you can dodge her hatchets, she's nearly worthless as a killer
---
4; They need to fix Nurse before they do something about Huntress, which in your words, is only the 4th best killer.
---
Exactly this. It all depends on your own mindset. Don't go into that game thinking that you have to kill all survivors.
---
Sometimes I just fun around with clown. His laughs make me happy xD
---
Haha you posted funny. You gain subscribe
---
I only know impossible skillchecks but it's something like this:
---
Distressing - make ur terror radius big
---
Unnerving presence - makes skillchecks hard
---
Huntress Lulaby - makes skillchecks harder
---
Either Ruin, Surveilance or Overcharge to round out the build
---
Possible addons to run, depending what you want to do: Calm Carter's Notes + Order Carter's Notes (best addon combo), Iri king + Mouldy Electrode (if you still want to use shock for anti loop), Interview Tape + High Stimulus Electrode (sniper doc to protect totems)
---
Edit: monto has a full 8 or 9 episodes on impossible skillchecks on youtube and a couple variations if you want to check them out
---
Damn tier 4 claudette
---
Yeah, that map kicks my ass.
---
i was expecting a jumpscare and i still got scared from that
---
Well, if you get a really good team and you're not playing an anti-loop killer... Not much you can do expect hope they mess up. That's why a lot of people play spirit or nurse only. 
---
Try watching a streamer named tru3talent, he's pretty good with all killers. I learned a lot of pretty good mind games from watching his stream and videos. 
---
When you win just look at the free salt, and go on to your next game. When you lose just say gg and go on.
---
Just not being toxic goes a long way with most people, free hits at the exit and so on.
---
Kiss yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
the first thing that comes to my mind is not tea bagging if you‚Äôre in a chase and you stun the killer with a pallet. im not a killer main and i find every time i play and someone stuns me with a pallet, im just surrounded by tea bags and it honestly makes me a little sad.
---
new totem spawns are looking lit
---
edit: i literally made a totem joke without realising it smh
---
Because she‚Äôs one of the only killers in the game that can actually compete in red ranks.
---
Wasn't trying to be funny, I genuinely hate garbage that think they can have fun. Like seriously, the only person who should be having fun is me, everyone else is complete trash lol
---
&gt;Huntress hatchets cannot go through pallets. 
---
They can't?! Bc I specifically recall hitting Surviviors from the other side of pallets. 
---
&gt;They need to fix Nurse before they do something about Huntress, which in your words, is only the 4th best killer.
---
They have an entire redo of her add-ons that are aimed at making her more fair. There's no such thing as a "priority list" for balance changes. If it's OP, nerf it. If it's UP, buff it. They don't need to address other shit first just bc it's Huntress. 
---
&gt;Her being 4th best is subjective and debatable, shes only above hag/myers/ghostface BECAUSE her ability is ranged. If you can dodge her hatchets, she's nearly worthless as a killer
---
That's the same thing for any killer lmao. If you can mindgame hag traps and evade them she's useless. If you deny Myers his stalk he's useless. If you reveal Ghostface his power is useless. This isn't unique to Huntress.
---
Yep, no idea why‚Äôs there‚Äôs 5 of them
---
No worries. I get your side of it too, just to be clear. I am in the middle. I do think there are reasonable complaints  but taken as a whole I am VERY happy with DBD and very thankful to the developers. It isn't perfect but they have my support and loyalty.
---
I must be a pretty unique pig in that case
---
... Except it isn't. You can look at older videos of DbD (pre 2018) and see that hitboxes were way less bullshit then than they are now. There's even weird hitboxes and connects when you play killer (Yes I know there's dedicated servers being tested rn, but I'm not talking about that). So i'd say their complaints are totally valid, because time and time again, even with good ping, you get bullshit hits.
---
It creates the lobby but it doesn‚Äôt actually put you in it until it matches you with a survivor. They changed it a few patches ago.
---
It may be old but it ain‚Äôt reliable. It‚Äôs rarely used anymore due to it running its course. It ain‚Äôt funny.
---
nothing is as perfect as when you raise the wailing bell and the survivor dead hards. honestly it‚Äôs golden.
---
I mean i agree, only you should be having fun. Did you know that in the credits, it says Dedicated to SkypeDragon and he is the only one who can have fun. I don‚Äôt understand what is so difficult to understand for people
---
DC if hit through vault
---
Also it looks like you deleted your account and got a new one?
---
self care is 32 seconds
---
second wind is 16+30 seconds, except the 30 seconds can be spent doing anything else as it's automatic.
---
Inner Strength is 14 + 8 seconds, however the 14 seconds is cleansing a totem and the 8 seconds can be used whenever needed.
---
standard heal is 16 seconds same with a standard brown medkit.
---
Botany knowledge is 12 seconds of heal.
---
We'll make it heal is 8 seconds.
---
When maxed out, Autodidact can literally be a 4 second heal. *If you wanna talk about investing time into healing then this is the best perk for that
---
Solidarity is a total of 24 seconds of healing between 2 injured people.
---
self care is literally one of the slowest heals, and I didn't even bring up killer healing debuffs or the really good med kit add-ons that make it even more inferior.
---
As far as the gen situation goes, it's actually faster to just ignore healing and jump straight on the gen, that's an 80% increase in gen speed if you're both on it, or just 100% if one of you have prove thyself.
---
:D
---
Exactly
---
Rabbit add on and m&amp;a make it 4m btw.
---
Let me compare bs things:
---
Multiple blinks nurse with range, nurse in general, Instasaw billy, crack billy, ebony moris, iri head with extra hatchets, spirit in general, hostage doc (luckly its bannable). Overall killers lost old tinkerer (so no machine gun huntress, but we have demo now so that's even better) and nurse now has to use a brown add on to have 3 blinks. Also you can't get insta morid.
---
Survivors lost insta gen BNPs (currently it's better to run efficiency + speed on a commodius toolbox than to run a BNP), lost instablind flashlights, DS nerfed, MoM isnt a perk anymore, pallet vacuum is gone, healing got nerfed, exhaustion perks got nerfed, maps got nerfed (weaker structures, less pallets + new maps have really unsafe loops). Vaults got nerfed.
---
Sure killers DC less now, but keep in mind how many things they got to keep while survivors lost a ton of stuff.
---
&gt;imo the skill ceiling for killer is way higher when it's 1 v 4 so justifiably so a good killer should be able to run over survivors.
---
But we aren't discussing skill right now, we are talking about unbalanced add ons. There is nothing skillful in putting on 3 blinks with range and a mori.
---
&gt;Tired of Survivor players whining in my games when I'm literally running yellow addons on huntress and they get run over, the entitlement never stops.
---
And the other side complains about normal medkits, genrushing and looping. Welcome to people being generally easy to annoy!
---
new update lets you play chess with survivors
---
found the survivor main
---
That's a respectful attitude, sure, but it's not really a friendly gesture o:
---
Torso looks very nice.
---
The glasses looks weird. Feel like it would make more sense (and look better) if he had goggles instead. 
---
Jake isn't known to wear glasses of any sort.
---
Yeah I guess, It's just getting boring after awhile tho.
---
Well it's not going to work *now*.
---
Dedicated servers 60 ping pretty good in my region
---
Ez
---
Unfortunately the survey lacks proper bug reporting, I have seen dead hard crap on me or even evil within meter desync as Myers (T3 popped while I was at two third of the meter)
---
Okay, I can see the character being fun. But, the hex totem seems a little op. If you mix that with noed and bloodwarden, that would make an amazing late game that would be hard to beat.
---
Edit: Made a few spelling errors
---
Sad billy noises :(
---
just tape a big as red paper under your feet.  great value red light
---
GG ez baby killer
---
Yeah man welcome to the hardest language to spell
---
dong by daylight
---
I was Myers and I went from T3 to T2 which was weird as hell
---
It‚Äôs a shame the devs won‚Äôt balance the game, only a small handful of killers can compete at high ranks sadly.
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
I noticed that as well
---
&gt; gotten them banned
---
Interesting. Unless the EGC wasn't active before the bodyblocking started, i don't see why this would be bannable. It's not holding the game hostage, the survivors *will* die.
---
It's called crouching bud, you ever just think the survivors you play against are trash if they don't do that? Lol
---
And exactly, learn how to counter and you wont have such a hard time against it. Shit like going through walls isnt counterable.
---
I still remember hiding behind this one box on the game. I kept going and standing there everytime the huntress would come. I could fit under it while standing so she couldn't see me. One time she saw me going there so I started looping it with the pallet that was attached to it. She threw a hatchet over the box and hit me in the head somehow. Over the box that is taller than me.
---
He‚Äôs so entitled for wanting to have fun. Doesn‚Äôt he know that being facecamped and tunnelled is a good thing and he has no right to dislike it? Gosh, stupid survivors mains, shake my head my head
---
Not really. Its use against nurse and spirit makes it a good choice. Dont really see how your perk fixes it anyway
---
Oh no I understand, I really do wish the meta was did, run what you want lmao i don't control you
---
I should tell you about the time 2 iridescent head huntresses DC‚Äôd on me during a chase in a row, in back to back matches, because they kept missing their 3 hatchets and got looped to shit. For huntresses that use iri head, it‚Äôs all fun and games until they get mad about their lack of skill.
---
They either need to buff lower tier killers or they need to do a nerf to nurse spirit bully Freddy and also survivors gen times 
---
That‚Äôs the real reason lower tier killers can‚Äôt compete because mobility, it‚Äôs physically impossible to be everywhere at once and survivors at high ranks are coordinated 
---
So spirit and nurse and even billy have a better chance because mobility
---
In a perfect world I don't disagree but I wonder if the pool of players is deep enough to satisfy separate queues. I currently wait 2-10 minutes for matches even during rank reset. 
---
I suppose playing against better killers will also serve to teach newer survivors good habits for looping and mind gaming. It might be a harder road but significantly easier and more enjoyable with a friend to bounce comments off or ask questions of. 
---
Finally I think this change is the right frame and expectation for players. Killers should feel like they are in the power position and survivors should feel like they are in a position of stress to make it out alive.
---
&gt;Unlike fighting games, that are designed to be on servers
---
What? Most fighting games are on P2P
---
Just don't t-bag, and flashlight click and were cool. If you win instead of EZPZ, just say gg or maybe even tell the killer what they did wrong. It's not like killers can't deal with losing, but having survivors go to an infinite all game and talk down to you when they know you couldn't do anything is a bit... 
---
Basically, just don't be a toxic douche. That's plenty! :)
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddqres/not_long_now/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
how you can't ge gen rushed?
---
Her power is useless. There's no reason to even break them.
---
It's all about practice, what can help you get more practice is Ruin to give you more time, along with other perks like say Thanatophobia, Dying Light and Sloppy Butcher.
---
Other than that, what killer you play and what map you're playing on, matters. For example, Autohaven Wreckers Blood Lodge is effectively impossible to win if you're a Stealth Killer as you simply can almost never sneak up on Survivors. Add on that most of the loops in this map, the Survivor can see the Killer 24/7, meaning you cannot do any mind games to try and win chases against them. Spirit, Huntress and Nurse have a chance on this map as Nurse ignores these loops, Spirit can make every loop in the game into a mindgame and Huntress can throw over these loops. 
---
Map knowledge/studying is critical to know your chances to catch people along with the Killer you play. If I play Pig on Blood Lodge I expect a loss but I will try all I can to win. But if I play Huntress I have a chance. Likewise if I play the smallest farm map - Rancid Abbatoir as Pig, I have a better chance on it than say Huntress and so forth.
---
Some maps do have infinites, it is almost always never worth chasing a survivor through the infinites unless you have 2 or more survivors dead. If you have 2 survivors dead and 2 alive, don't chase unless you have 2 gens left, because the other survivor you're not in a chase with should still do gens, this happens higher up too.
---
Where a survivor is running and how long the chase has been are also critical in optimising your own time. For example, if a survivor runs you through 2 loops with optimal turning and after breaking the pallet on the second loop, they run to a Jungle Gym (A Jungle Gym is the place with a Pallet and a Window in a confined rectangle), it's best to leave them alone because they are clearly good and you would be wasting too much time on them and you're better off finding others.
---
They are some things you can do as Killer and are a good start.
---
Survivor perks are survivor perks, quite strong (Not a complaint if any survivor baby sees this). If these are smurfs they probably have some of the better loadouts in the game, Dead Hard, Iron Will, things like that. You won't know they have those perks until you hit them at least once, and that is the sort of information you get on the fly. A situation in which you can check for Dead Hard is if you know you will be right behind the survivor and they can't get away to another loop, you lunge and hit them rather than just tapping the attack button, if they had Dead Hard, you'll swing right through it and still hit them. This pretty much does not work if the survivor has any sort of distance on you. Things like that can help and if you don't see it lower down you will certainly see it higher up.
---
If you can stomach playing survivor and get to a rank high (like red ranks) you'll be able to see what killers try to do to mindgame you, in which you can use to improve your gameplay. I'm rank 1 at Killer and Survivor and I can tell you from personal experience, I would have not got to Rank 1 Survivor if it were not for the amazing survivors I play against daily.
---
Hope this is something from you. And sorry if it is not.
---
More fun than spirit running BBQ&amp;Chilli, Nurse's Calling, Deerstalker and whispers
---
You can always leave your item at their feet/at the gates as a sort of offering.
---
Remember that rank its not the same as skill. Maybe they were carried by their friends and now are stuck in high ranks without having the real skill to endure them.
---
I'm sorry for you. :(
---
I love it!
---
I only prestiged my spirit for her bloody sword
---
I use cosmetics from the store for the other parts, so not really a need to prestige unless you like the bloody cosmetic
---
I'm just asking out of curiosity, but why would God allow this?
---
One of 4 killers who can compete in red ranks, and the most popular among them.
---
(PC) Had an issue where whenever I tried to press enter to chat in the post-game chat as killer the game would minimize instead. Only happens as killer, only happens in this game. Started with Dedicated Servers
---
If I‚Äôm in a match and the killer got smashed or he let us live after people dced or something 
---
I will let him hook me and sacrifice me at the end as a payment
---
0_0 No, no, you're good too billy. I didn't mean it that way:c
---
Me: Myers is there. Run.
---
My friend, a rank 20 with zero experience in the game: It's okay, he's just watching us.
---
*tier 3 music intensifies*
---
Yeah I'm rank 7 and this still happens. I'll even run kindred and they still wouldn't unhook me till second state. Also not really related to the topic but why do high ranks run self-care like it's a waste of a perk slot and most of the time the killers have sloppy butcher and they still self-care.
---
I didn't delete my account lol. What makes you think that?

I hear people saying this, but i don't see it. Do you live on the west coast or in the EU?
---
Legend has it that he is still in that locker til this very day.
---
I would love to see him in dbd. My point sorry was as he has his own game. I dont think he will appear here.
---
Iridescent Head is cancer right now, but making it apply Deep Wounds would be a negative, not a positive, since Huntress would no longer be able to down Survivors with her Hatchets.
---
I'm all for changing it, but it's an Ultra Rare; it should be a strong add on.
---
no
---
I agree, what about jungle gyms, and unmindgameable pallets in general though? I think those hurt m1 killers a lot.
---
I mean, I can't point out everything wrong with this but I think you forgot to point out that wonderful instaheal that survivors have along with coms
---
I need to know, are you able to level him up?
---
If you want cosmetics yes.  
---
Myers atm has no other cosmetics than his base/blood versions so more incentive if you want to change your appearance. 
---
People say there is also a very small % increase to addon /offerings quality  in the bloodweb for each prestige you go up. (I believe less than 1% but I could be wrong)   
---
If this is the case and you only play specific killers a lot and want those better addons / offerings then it would be worth it in the long run, otherwise not really.
---
Players: hey BHVR there‚Äôs a strong argument to make that pig and legion are by far the worst killers, can we please get reworks or buffs?
---
BHVR: *villainous laughter*
---
Hopefully you're new.
---
It was a joke
---
nurse, spirit and the other 2 are...? Billy and hag? Maybe huntress?
---
I play on PC. I have friends who only have consoles, though.
---
It'd greatly widen the matchmaking pool, and if there ends up being a massive advantage/disadvantage (I doubt this), do what other crossplay games do and let individual players decide by turning it on and off.
---
One of the Developers (Peanits) said it shouldn‚Äôt result in a ban, and at worst, the game won‚Äôt open until it‚Äôs changed
---
It says u/[deleted]
---
Hold on your name went from having the OP color (aka being blue) to normal? What‚Äôs goin on?
---
Oh thanks, I didn‚Äôt know
---
Nice but did they really have to make her bald tho?? Oh well, I guess I have to pretend she is Amber Rose in a Plague outfit.
---
IMO, unless you're blood point rich, you should only prestige killers once if at all.
---
You don‚Äôt revert back. I‚Äôve had this happen and the killer slugged my team. I was flashing between downed people healing and making the killer lose their shit. It was fun but I don‚Äôt know how it happened.
---
dead hard for distance,not to dodge hit.
---
I was thinking billy and huntress. Low key forgot hag was a killer.
---
so basically study this game as if it's my full time job. 
---
The matter of fact is I don't have the time to become the best at this game. I don't have the free time to learn every single mechanic, perk, loop, item, map variation, etc like all the toxic survivors who DC and depip to play low rank games. I'm an adult who with a life who logs on to play a match or two. I refuse to consume my life with games that can only be won by studying them as if it's a college exam. I just want to have fun. I'm just looking for pointers on ways to make the game enjoyable when I can't win rather than feel the need to win every single game because that just won't happen. 
---
I've also been rank 1 survivor multiple times so I guess it just goes to show my point that survivor is just generally an easier/stronger role (at least in my experience &amp; play style) considering I got to rank 1 just playing casually solo.
---
You... Do realize the original was the same way, right?
---
Agreed.

Nope, in both versions, Old Man Kruger was a pedophile.

Yeah, but it only works with one survivor. So that makes it still a balanced perk

Step 1:  use headphones

Step 2:  play as spirit
---
I suck as killer but i can wreck people as spirit.  After you get used to listening for people and following scratch marks while you're phased it's ridiculous how strong she is, even without add ons.  
---
If you've got ruin and bbq you're even better off.

Bruh, the- the- the emoji

I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.

Well you don't really need to spam the hooks with traps.

^oh ^god ^oh ^fuck

It is. I've never had a lunge end literally 0.5 seconds after starting because it thought I hit. The closest I've gotten is ghost chainsaw hits stopping preemtpively, but this is on a whole other level of ridiculous
---
Idk man I have had plenty of instances where haunted netted me two instant downs and that got the whole game rolling fast because of my bbq and chili ending games quick with it.
---
I don't immerse myself. I usually run around a lot, and even have the killer on me most of the game. Guess my mistake is trying to play the game competently and give my teammates a chance to do gens, because they sure as shit don't buy me any time

Ooh, Jake looks amazing in this *redner*

Actually yes, I was able to lvl him up but I didn't do that cause I was a little scared to do so
---
Ah dw, i don‚Äôt really care about it, just funny to read out loud lol
---
It's fine in general. Scratched mirror myers is just absolutely awful on open maps because you can see him coming from a mile away and his 105% movement speed is not enough to end chases. Doesn't help that he can't get bloodlust either
---
People complain about the lag, that it's unplayable and etc. Which is a lie. (not the lag part, the unplayable part, the game has barely changed in my experience) Devs enabled it all across the PC version to test things out.
---
i agree about pig, still think the legion should be removed
---
He just killed the kids in the original movies. Craven considered making him a kiddy diddler in the originals but decided against it. While there are some implications to that affect in the originals,  he just murdered them.
---
In the new version he's officially a kiddy diddler.
---
Yeah. I'm already planning to get Jake's Cowboy Hat so I can use that vest
---
Type: In game
---
When closing hatch survivor can still jump in while the animation plays
---
I had no idea what a "spooky lunchbox" is.
---
Yeah well that's understandable then. IMO if the EGC is active it's still scummy but shouldn't be bannable.
---
The game is not generous at all. You can't even buy most new cosmetics with shards anymore and when you do, it's fucking a million shards. You literally only get so little shards when you level up it is ridiculous. Survivors should not cost 9000 shards just for being skins...
---
self care is 32 seconds on one survivor
---
second wind activates in one game out of 10, if Im generous. It also requires to be unhooked, so its no substitute for self-care. And if it does work, its unsafe.
---
inner strength needs you to find a totem, go there, cleanse it, go to locker, go in locker go out of locker. Will take longer than 32 seconds and you wont be doing it a lot. (Also pretty unsafe)
---
Standard heals are finite and youll be self-caring more than one game
---
well make it is not for youself and you need to be unhooked with a survivor that has that perk for it to work
---
autodidact needs a lot of heals
---
solidarity needs a second INJURED survivor, which wont be easy to
---
find.
---
all are situational, and require effort. self-care is you healing yourself. no bullshit, no items needed. Self-care is safe and simple. You dont need to be hooked, it works on your first hit. You dont need a teammate (which is as slow anyway) and you dont need to worry about having to find anything on the map or any other survivor
---
Its obviously faster to ignore healing. But if you go down in 10 seconds, whereas you would have gone down in 30 seconds, it would have been better to just self-cared and survive 20 seconds longer. Thats already 20 seconds for 3 survivors, which is 80%, whereas you could only have done 36%
---
Huh. Welp, I will be the first to admit I was wrong here. Thanks for the correct info.
---
Not a single gen done, damn what a shame! I was expecting like 2-3 gems to pop while you had him distracted down there. Props to wasting his time like that lol
---
Body blocking is NOT bannable. It is stated clearly on their website. Also it‚Äôs your own fault for going into a corner where she can body block you.
---
That‚Äôs a morei
---
Yeah I live in EU
---
The game is not optimized well, at all. I think either system should be fine, I'd probably roll with i7 9700k for ten bucks more than the 7700k if you go that route.
---
I guess so.
---
Spine Chill isn't going to be very useful against Sprirt when you gains Undetectable so...
---
The change is so that it's built around non stealth Killer by making the bonuses gained by Spine Chill actually useful.
---
Pretty sure this counts as holding the game hostage
---
She didn't earn it, if she had earned it she would have actually gotten it. She was butthurt.
---
Y e s
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
I had a hillbilly today who i thought understood we were having fun.  We were playing "follow the leader" and he had some trouble at first (he accidentally ran his chainsaw into a wall when i turned).  He finally caught up and let me drop 3 pallets on his head.  I was ready to play some more, but he eventually left to play with someone else.
---
Later, though, he came back and pulled me off a generator that was over 90% done, and he actually hooked me!  It was rude.  When i got off the hook, I was hoping he'd come back so i could stab him, but he never did.
---
I waited for him at the exit gate, waiving for him to come with me, but when he got there he just revved up his chainsaw and ran into the wall.  :(
---
and ruin
---
I don't have to be some loser who does nothing but play dbd in his moms basement all day to enjoy a video game. there are tons of games that are fun to play casually including this one. I'm just looking for pointers on ways to have a little more fun :)  I also enjoy playing killer when  I play in a premade group of 5 because people aren't assholes even when they're vastly better than me at the game.
---
It just goes to show the game is only as good as the community and toxic people like you who tell bad players to basically fuck off if they don't want to play the game 24/7 to become god tier only contributes to the demise of the game and a shitty player base.
---
Here's a tip: if you are rank 13 killer I suggest being kind to others interested in the game otherwise you're going to drive away the lower rank players who seek help (aka your matchmaking buddies)... If everyone treated new players like this you'd have nobody to play against and beat except smurfs and then it would be your turn to post on the forums bitching about killer not being fun :) please be kind to low skill players it's important for the health of the game &amp; as a horror fan I'd really like to see this game grow instead of tell people if they aren't good enough to fuck off.
---
True true
---
I suppose it‚Äôs just more in your face in the new one.
---
True, but I've played killer quite alot and if people are doing bones that's people not working gens. Which can make up for not having late game perks. which gives you more time to get some hooks.
---
I thought so, it‚Äôs implied in the old ones but never stated.
---
why didn't you wait for you friend to crawl out of that space, everybody knows that as soon as you go in there you're done for. I've also seen the comments below i don't think this is a thing you can get banned for.
---
I've played a ton this week. It's bad. Play Myers or Nurse and you'll see both of their powers are bugged. Nurse is super fucked. I only got infinite blinded once and stuck in a locker once due to lag though.
---
Regardless that's unacceptable in terms of how many bugs. Not to mention survivor getting hit through vaults constantly and hillbilly chainsaws being really weird in terms of hitboxes.
---
Oh and huntress hitboxes are fucked too lmao. How do you not see it? Dedicated has been out for days.
---
I can't ever use these cosmetics other than the Dwight one, I play stealthy and these things are glowing

Your name isn‚Äôt blue, and the user has [deleted] instead of their name. Maybe you used another account to make comments on it? Aka this one?
---
I was enjoying spirit until I got looped by some dude with no mither (that perk already triggers me to want to chase) &amp; i was using stridor. He just knew EVERY pallette location, EVERY safe and unsafe loop. I'm sure if I were better I would have caught him but I didn't. Truth of the matter is I don't necessarily care to win or be the best. I just want to find a way to enjoy myself when the game is unwinnable.
---
You see, it says that supposedly you gain and increased change for rare items in the bloodweb. This effect is somewhat negligible as its not even 1%. Dont prestige for that, prestige for bloody cosmetics.
---
&gt; Nobody said that you use
---
I know, i'm just making that clear. :)
---
&gt; Nobody said that you have to let survivors get free saves.
---
I'm wasn't directing that at **you,** i'm just kinda ranting about the rank system. I think the game disagrees with you. If you don't hook all survivors 3 times, safety.
---
&gt; You're sitting up here trying to argue a point that nobody made. You should read the actual argument next time.
---
I'm not arguing with you at all my friend, if I wanted to I would've rebutted all your points 1 by 1 which I didn't... I'm giving my opinion, and my experience that's all. I never said you said anything. You're getting gas lighted over nothing. I'm not even attacking your points, and you're getting defensive. I was having a conversation not a debate. XD
---
Time Traveller
---
I only give hatch if I know where it is and I can get there in one carry. If they're a donk I'll drop them in front of the hatch and slam it shut. If they really pissed me off I'll take them to the hatch, slam it, and bleed them out or until the timer ends :)
---
I just had a trapper lay hella traps around the hook and still camp me. Wtf?
---
Gotta say bnp was overpowered, when everyone brought bnp, it was a game with only one gen left
---
Nurse just doesn't work at all since the update lmao
---
Thank you.
---
What about demo
---
This is what I mean.
---
It‚Äôs always so overkill to the point where it ruins gameplay completely.
---
Like hooray, he used all his traps let‚Äôs gen rush!
---
But also, boo, that one person now has had their round and afternoon ruined by a rank 18 killer who can‚Äôt play right.
---
Myers is OP in tier one
---
Like, Jesus Christ he‚Äôs invisible

What a cunt. But why didnt you go for the pallet stun? the person was downed in the pallet
---
I'm not looking to even be good. I just want to learn how to have fun when people just infinite loops. Should I just DC? Should I just watch them tbag? It's great that you told me to practice but that's exactly what happens every game you get in. Every game is practice. So as much as that's nice. It's advice that I didn't ask for and already do.
---
to clarify: I'm not looking for ways to BEAT people. I'm looking for ways to ENJOY MYSELF when I can't win. It's a matter of fact to accept you can't win every game and I just don't know what to even spend my time doing when people are infinite
---
Thinking the same thing when I saw the downed spot.
---
With 1 survivor in panicked he'd be at 115
---
For lack of better terminology, survivors, or more so, survivor sympathisers are massive fucking dicks. They see a baby killer/a killer who isn't good/experienced then they just bully and effectively make fun of them endlessly.
---
Me personally as I am rank 1 on both and I wish both sides to have fun and have a chance, I've talked many times with Killers who aren't good at the end of matches and advised them on perks to use and how to play. For example many new Nurses never blink to go around the map and just walk, something like that changes them tenfold.
---
Simply: You cannot have fun on Killer unless you play against survivors who know what it's actually like to play Killer. And they are rare.
---
Yeah but I got Steve to p3 instead lol
---
Found the camper
---
Yeah it pisses me off. I played 3 games today and every single match I had a killer who tunnels me from the start, then face camps. I never get teams who gen rush. They usually just stand around and watch as the killer face camps.
---
Idk, sounds like a worse Freddy with the teleport/pallets
---
I literally hear the lit totem spawning in lmao
---
thank you for the advice! I am running ruin on virtually every killer I play lol it's my only teachable slow down perk that I have right now. Yeah PC games tend to run toxic communities. I'm getting ready to put the game away again cause people on here are just awful. 
---
It's so sad that all competitive online games these days will drive players away just because their skill level.
---
I wish they did legion.
---
This isn't true lol. OP probably isn't getting safe hook rescues. A hook rescue doesn't mean it's safe, they have to get away.
---
You need to rank up actually. With the new changes regarding SWF, it probably reduced drastically the player pool on lower ranks. 
---
For example, I've been playing with my friends and despite them being rank 10 to 15, we've been going against killers ranked 1 to 6 purely because of me. Just in my group you have 3 players that should be going against killers like you but they won't.
---
they failed to play the game by having two people go into that space lmao.
---
I shouldn't have to make misplays to fix the matchmaking system
---
The whole point of this sub is to talk about the game, I was expressing my discontent about the Rank system with you and then you took as an attack for no reason. :/ 
---
I apologize if it sounded like I was attacking you. But that wasn't my intention. No need to be condescending.
---
Sometimes you have to recognize when you're getting looped into losing the game.  I know it sucks feeling like you just can't catch the person, but you should switch targets and focus on generators.  Save the great looper for the end, when his teammates are dead.
---
Thank you. I guess part of the problem with this game as with any online competitive game is that it's just a breeding ground for angry teenage boys needing to let their aggression out. Please know your willingness to give everyone a chance to enjoy the game is appreciated.
---
When I play killer, I don't face camp, I don't even hook everyone that I down I'll just keep chasing around and goofin off and having fun cause I want survivors to enjoy the game too. I guess that's part of why it's so frustrating when people will intentionally try to ruin the gameplay mechanics.
---
Plague
---
Wow! Did you know that all of the killers have.. KILLED SOMEBODY?!?! :o feels so weird!
---
He's fun to play against but it's not because he's that good.
---
Now you've said this I'm wondering how many actual children I've killed as him considering how many play this game.
---
Yeah I am not good at making powers and perks
---
At least 3 for better chances ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

nah
---
Flashlights, instaheals, exhaustion perks, ds, bt, IW, infinites, dead hard, keys, BNP, adrenaline, unbreakable, SWF, Sabo. 14, there ya go.
---
In every community the 1% is the loudest
---
This is the best comment so far.
---
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs better.
---
The fact that he got up there or the fact that she didn‚Äôt even see him.
---
Ok well I guess since you can't see that most of those things are wrong, let me educate you a little bit. Not every killer can go invisible nor can they see you 24/7. And if you count insidious as OP then you shouldn't be playing this game. Also, not all killers are all that fast and only one can teleport whenever and one requires a survivor to be walking/running to be able to teleport. Killers more often than not **don't** camp in front of hooks, especially in higher ranks. If you get picked up by a killer while repairing a gen you're one of these two things: Playing against gen-grabber spirit OR don't know how the fuck to look around. Finally, if you get killed by the end timer you're probably the last survivor that was unable to find the hatch or being fucking toxic. I truly hope I don't have to explain the other stuff to you.
---
Ooo, hope it gets the whole legion team involved
---
Don‚Äôt remember his name but he‚Äôs from trick or treat
---
Someone didn‚Äôt read the post. He went to heal a downed teammate and the killer came back.
---
I would absolutely rather have classic Freddy, but I don‚Äôt actively think about the pedo aspect with the remake. I just think he overall sucks as a character. Him being a pedo just makes it worse.
---
You get punished anyway during chases, as you waste 4 valuable seconds.
---
It's not me playing haha but down vote if you like  :)
---
Why were you looking at the door when the Doctor shocked you ?
---
Oh I get what you're saying. I can't put this in the perk description, but it would have the same effect Stack Out has but backwards to show that it's going to deactivate in 15 seconds. Also, it will always to the audio que when the Killer first looks at you.
---
And yes, as far as I know, Undetectable will make it so that your aura cannot be revealed and you won't trigger detection perks and The Spirit is definitely going to be Undetectable while Phase Walking.
---
Yeah, it doesn't help that if they are SWF prepare your proverbial gaming ass for something you would never ever experience irl. These *ugh* "people" want Killers to suffer, endlessly, 24/7.
---
Nurse being nerfed as she has been is fine. But if they touch her power they've won. Spirit will be next on the chopping block, and it will become only Nurse at Red Ranks, in which they will argue her being nerfed *again*. They are taking our game (Killers) and making it so they are power, not you.
---
We need more Killer players, but when you play against this when you're new... Totally discourages you. No fun for you, because their fun, is making fun of you. Sad world.
---
Edit: Beating Survivors is the only fun we can have, that's pretty fucking sad.
---
If "we" win the Killer is OP, the Killers Perks are OP, the Killers addons are OP, the Killer Camped, the Killer Tunnelled or the Killer Exploited. Never down to their own (failing) skill. Ours. Every fucking day.
---
If the Killer loses, we're a baby, a noob, an ez clap, survivor perks are not OP, survivor items are not OP and survivor addons are not OP.
---
It's all down to us, the Killers, it's our fault, everything.
---
Apparently.
---
My first thought would of been wait I can't go anywhere so you're right I wouldn't of thought I cant escape I wouldn't of been there
---
you could have saved yourself 13 hours by contacting support. they give you everything back
---
you are using your power that is like saying wraith is getting punished for using his power. only reason why you would use your power as legion is to slow them down making them have to mend that is not really wasting 4 seconds
---
How is that the closest call? You 99ed the door at full health lol
---
I have this build except Ruin has yet to appear on his blood web. Nurse's Calling is currently a placeholder for now. Map pressure teleporting and the action speed decrease noticeably slows the game even without Ruin.
---
No dash, my guy.

Is this a joke?

Description: Usually when I play survivor or killer during matches, it occasionally lags out and I end up in the game‚Äôs main menu with a message "An error occurred". Is this happening to anyone else? Or am I just damned?
---
What's the purpose at that point? I get trying to be nice in this game but sometimes people are too worried about other players feelings. Like God forbid you use a mechanic the developer put into the game the way it was intended to be used. Stop being so worried about being called sweaty or toxic and just use things the way they're meant be used.
---
A+, bordering S if you ask me.
---
Yeah, been happening to me for a while.
---
i have been mostly playing myers, while his power acts a bit weird it hasn't been too much of an issue for me
---
Do you not have an Xbox or PS4? It's only $20 and you might even have fun for a while starting off at low ranks again. I got to say I haven't had this much fun with a game in well over a decade. But yeah I would never risk my sanity trying to play it on PC.

Dude, I promise you WGLF is broken, on the PS4 at least.

Well, ultrarare are meant to be OP. Similarly, killer might give up against full insta-heal team... Or a few Brand new parts. This goes both ways
---
Yalls got NOTHING on fatigue times for using a power and missing... Nurse main here.
---
this is why I play The Hag with *Mint Rag/Make Your Choice* and just trade places on Hooks with the rescuer.

People will leave you to die on the hook after the third or fourth unhook once they realize what‚Äôs going on.

In a game where people can‚Äôt join to fill dcing should be punished harshly. Not only does it deny points but basically fuck over the survivors.

What happened

Even on console?

I started using spies from the Shadows recently. Played this map last night and it was just constantly going off all game haha.

Well, my original reply to you was just kinda explaining how you sounded pretty dumb. But considering you're just gonna give replies that hold no meaning to them, I'mma go watch Otz byeeee.
---
Bye. Don't come back. Also, learn how to not get worked up over the internet.
---
That's definitely the appeal to console gaming, which is why I bought one in the first place but now they're both just gathering dust T_T
---
I‚Äôve hoping since his release, and every time they announce new cosmetics I frantically search for the Freddy I know and love.
---
I highly doubt bhvr will ever do it, because why pay for the original likeness? They have no need to. But damn, I‚Äôd fucking love it. They could do like a ‚ÄúSlasher Cosmetic Sale‚Äù and include Classic Freddy, remake Leatherface, Bloody Tears Myers...it would be really cool.
---
Yeah, copy what I just said to you lol...don't have anything else to say? You are the one who has nothing to offer, so dont come at me with that bs
---
It more just irks me that these people can be in denial this strongly, it's as if it's politics or some shit honestly.
---
I get my enjoyment by maining Nurse and Pig in Rank 1, and boy, do they hate losing to both of these Killers xD
---
I was pleasantly surprised my first time using spies. Its WAY underrated. Still use it.
---
Sure. But let‚Äôs say for example
---
They bugged trapper:
---
-Starts the match with multiple traps
---
-If trapped, you cannot struggle out of it unless someone helps you out of it
---
-bear traps open themselves after taking a survivor from them
---
-cannot destroy traps 
---
I think this would boost him quite a lot. He would take skill to use still with placement and such, but I think it‚Äôd help him a lot. Especially being able to start the match with a few traps already in hand
---
Who hurt you
---
Insta-downs for half your arguments doesnt make sense. Majority of the game you dont have insta. NOED is easily countered. SWF is too strong, this has been said by the devs. Flashlight saving is a crutch item. BT doesnt always apply to campers. Exhaustion perks are a free getaway. "FrAnKLinS iS toXIc". SWF saboing is not fair. Slugging is the best way to win with 2 people left.
---
Was it on switch? Cause if so
---
Mybad
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
i dont understand... couldnt the Meg just move and then you could leave?
---
You have my attention
---
I have a build called "ghost mom" where I just phase around the map as spirit. Follow survivors around to try and give them hugs. (No hitting) working on gens with them (hitting them. Ghost mom tries her best)
---
And just randomly appearing infront of them or leading them to gens or chests. Then opening the gate for them when the gens are done.
---
I always get atleast one person saying "thank you mom"
---
Nurse = strongest killer in the game
---
Try and play killer at red ranks , it‚Äôs quite difficult and sometimes not enjoyable so sometimes if you want a relaxed match you sort of need those add ons or annoying perks; even then it can be hard be SWF . Unless you don‚Äôt care about the 4K or any kills in general then I guess disregard my comment .
---
Btw both sides have OP perks and items

Mori me ü§©
---
To repeat your question: how to have fun even if you‚Äôre not a very good killer. 
---
1. Change your mindset. Go in assuming you won‚Äôt actually kill anyone. 
---
2. If it looks like things are not going in your favor, really, just start messing around. Maybe slug someone. Maybe leave a chase and go the opposite direction to kick a gen or find someone on a totem or in a chest. Spinning around usually shows you‚Äôre not playing serious. Play peek-a-boo with someone between a wall and window. 
---
Don‚Äôt let a teabag or pallets or flashlights trigger you. Just keep rolling no matter how the match is going. 
---
3. Sometimes a survivor will recognize you‚Äôre not the best and give you a hook or a down. Have fun with that person. 
---
4. You can still earn lots of points just by chasing, slashing, and kicking gens even without ever hooking. You can even max out those point categories. 
---
5. The more survivors trust you the more the will make themselves available to you.
---
6. Farming is perfectly acceptable and can be fun AND a lot of times you‚Äôll get thank-you messages instead of salt.
---
It really is, I'm loving it. For some reason I'm just not good at using Whispers so have given up on that and this is a nice alternate I think.
---
I don't understand why people do shit like this, and then brag about it. You look like a 9 year old who lost a fortnite match. 
---
"Hey, I'm a giant man baby who can't deal with anger, so I destroyed my TV! Look!!!"
---
self care is not safe, like I said if you're going in with the mindset of "I need an infinite amount of heals" you're already a liability to your team and are setting up survivors for failure.
---
what the fuck aren't you getting in that you think wasting so much time healing yourself is a good idea against killers who can fully well take advantage of it with things such as Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, and other perks starting to rise in popularity like Thanataphobia and dying light, all of which are % based, which actively hurt Self-Care more than other heals.
---
It's made even worse when multiple survivors are playing like this, people like to bring up the whole argument of "oh 2 survivors spending 16 seconds durr!" but then you''ll regularly have 2-3 survivors spending 32 seconds all healing themselves in buttfuck nowhere. and literally contributing nothing to the team for over half a minute or even more allowing for the killer to easily apply pressure to a game, even moreso when you as a killer realize this and can just apply massive stall by hitting the immersive idiot once and knowing they'll be occupied constantly self caring and not being a threat to you at all.
---
It's also telling that you think going down in 30 seconds is a good enough stall for the average survivor.
---
yep i‚Äôve done it twice on console
---

Instadowns literally cancels out half of your arguments. A lot of things are easily countered. Doesn't automatically mean they're fun, balanced or easy to deal with when active. SWF are a way to make the game fun and less biased in the killer's favor. Seems like someone just can't handle flashlights. Nobody said BT applied to campers. Nobody even mentioned campers. Exhaustion perks are useful for 3 seconds and then you have to wait a whole minute without running. If you as a killer fail to catch the survivor in that time, it's fair game to say you're just not that good. Nobody is stopping you from using Franklins. SWF saboing is completely fair. Just as fair as killers running Ruin and that perk that automatically regresses 15 percent of a generator's progress. If you're relying on an instadown, you just aren't good. It's that simple.
---
Fleff
---
Cool kid but work on your anger issues. This isn't funny its cringe and its pathetic. Its a game for God's sake.
---
ye, the bloodlust meachanic needs some serious work and so do perks like Beast of Prey
---
How do you smack downed survivors. Were you tbagging? If you were then the nodding is nothing.
---
&gt; All I can say is I feel really damn sorry for the people on the West coast
---
Haven't noticed any issues since the dedicated servers dropped.
---
The pig was blocking both of them in there
---
Agreed. If anything it‚Äôs a red flag for those with violent tendencies.
---
I'm all honesty I've only been playing a week and I'm not great with stuns yet.
---
Beast of prey is the no mother of Killer perks
---
ain‚Äôt no way on HELL this is bannable, it‚Äôs literally error on the devs part
---
I haven't had issues with any of that, and I'm on the west coast.  Sounds like your internet bruh.
---
that happens to me on console and dedicated servers are not up for console besides switch
---
Could please someone edit this and add the AC sound when doing a leap?
---
If you do that rather than be toxic and whine in the chat, I'm all for it. Not necessarily a healthy way to handle anger but directing it toward inanimate objects (if you paid for them) is better than people imo.
---
Wrong sub
---
Only if the entire match is narrated by Wayne June
---
Literally everyone: Ruin to slow the game down
---
It's easier but you can't get full bloodpoints from 12 hooks
---
It‚Äôs not. Also my friend who streams the game as killer has insane lag issues when playing. So I know it‚Äôs not just me. So don‚Äôt call everyone a liar. These are common issues with the dedicated servers.

Amazing graphics and good perks design. Keep up with great work!
---
I mean the comment he replied to was whataboutism tho LMAO
---
Honestly I don't even think of him as the remake one. I just see him as classic because let's be real they look the same 
---
I've never seen the remake either so that helps but even if he was a pedi before he killed the kids it doesn't really bother me to play him at all
---
Implying camping is playing properly. Lol enjoy rank 18
---
i hate it stop paying people to do this
---
I heard crunchy peanut butter also, but it has to be Wegman's brand.
---
it is
---
I disagree with the extra hit, as killer if i‚Äôve played my game right i‚Äôve got plenty of points. And if i get outplayed and 1-4 survivors manage to escape, just leave because more than likely i just want to get on with the next match. When they wait for me to finally leave it feels like i‚Äôm holding their hand or they‚Äôre craving attention to rub it in
---
**E**

I don‚Äôt usually give the hatch unless the survivor deserves it for being a good player and being non-toxic, or if like half their team dc‚Äôs
---
Well, me and everyone I play with are 2000+ miles from the servers in Virginia and we don't have these issues.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
...To be honest, I wouldn't say failing so bad you decide to commit to one survivor, hook them in the basement, and then camp just so you can get one kill is "playing properly".
---
She's my favorite killer to face by a wide margin, but fuck prayer beads. Spirit games are spooky and funny.
---
Yes they are , on pc at least. read patch notes
---
Well when you have next to no upgrades it kinda is required since the killers strength primarily comes from the perks which require leveling up like crazy
---
Tbh I can never hear the auditory alert that supposedly comes with whispers so to me it's pretty useless. But spies literally let's you know where everyone is, all the time. And the cooldown is only 40 secs so you can use it all game long. If you wanna be truly honest, imo it's kinda op but since for some reason noone ever uses it it goes unnoticed. I love spies. It's one of my favorite killer perks.
---
But prayer beads make it even scarier because you always have to be on alert and can be jump scared
---
Interestingly enough, I found moderate success with Classic Ghost Face (I'm All Ears, Thrilling Tremors, and Furtive Chase). Furtive kind of has to be at tier 3 and must be played around it (otherwise, there's not much point to it.)
---
Over time, the fourth slot changed between Devour Hope, Nurse's Calling, Whispers, Stridor, and Thanatophobia. Devour is good if it stays up - can also be a pseudostall as survivors desperately search for the totem instead of gens. Nurse's and Whispers were excellent for finding survivors. Both Nurse's and Stridor were used for finding post-unhook survivors. Thanatophobia *really* helped slow the game when I could 3-gen strat the survivors.
---
You can swap out I'm All Ears once you get better at predictions. I'm not great at it, but I didn't want to build a reliance on it, so I swappdd it out. It's decent for soft-countering QnQ, if you find you're having problems.
---
My current build is Furtive Chase 1, Thrilling Tremors 3, Surge 3, and Surveillance 2.
---
The Surge + Surveillance combo saves me a lot of time when downing somebody as well as giving me a reliable wealth of intel. Thrilling Tremors helps lock down generators post-surge and further solidifies any information as to if survivors are lingering. Furtive Chase is simply one of my "core" perks. The information granted from it is unique and can definitely shine in the right circumstances.
---
Checkout threat designs stream. You‚Äôll see the lag first hand. Not my internet. Get over yourself.
---
Nodding is BM what do you mean?

It still shows her as locked so you haven't unlocked her
---
Only misinformed people thought servers were going to fix something that isn't broken. Latency / ping was a thing on P2P system and will continue to be on servers. Granted that the hits currently being seen on servers are way worse than it should be, even with ping.

I agree man. I'm a killer main, have just recently getting into playing survivors a lot and get wrecked every other game and still never have a reason to disconnect.
---
I really like Fires of Hell. It would have pretty good synergy with some other perks, nice job!

Sorry you feel that way

I scream like my wife (who is a petite Chinese woman)  lol
---
The tense feeling afterwards now that I know it‚Äôs a spirit beads spirit is great.  Makes me really get immersed and be as sneaky as possible
---
Kinda what the whole "#'s should probably be fiddled with" thing was all about. I agree that 40 seconds for almost a minute of wallhacks is pretty unbalanced, but the numbers are the only change needed. Maybe like a minute for 20 seconds? The backing was a more aggressive version of kindred. You could also just not follow the survivor after a point (like PLYF) and break the chase early.
---
TWR can be very synergistic with lithe, as vaulting them normally gives you a speed boost (and exhaustion), while TWR only gets you more distance after being hit, and you should have probably used lithe by then if you were decent. 
---
Ideas still stand, but the numbers do need adjustments. There is no way for me to experiment or playtest this, so finding ANY decent numbers is just guess and check.
---
No ghost face has been around since 1996
---
There's issues with certain powers and perks but not all, and yet they didn't allow for a comment thread on the survey. Which I think was a massive mistake.
---
Most definitely. Stay tuned üê∑

To the top with this post, where it belongs
---
Try centering your camera on his upper torso/head next time - it should work out better!
---
I saw a video on how the detection mechanic appears to work. Basically, there's a specific space (percentage) of your screen which will count as looking in said direction. Ghost Face's detection hitbox does not include the legs.
---
Ever since I watched the video and kept those details in mind, I have yet to run into issues with revealing Ghost Face!
---
Note: If objects block Ghost Face's model on your screen - *including your survivor* - it will block your ability to reveal him!
---
I'm Batman!
---
Likewise i think it's really funny when a killer chases me all game, refuses to pressure gens, respects all pallets, and then comes on here to cry about how gens go too fast and looping is toxic
---
And the killer is taking advantage of that error. It's banable.
---
why post something to reddit about this? it‚Äôs universally known that if a killer camps then they aren‚Äôt that good, if you get camped then suck it up and just start the next game like everybody else.
---
Wait what is this about nerfing Pig? I can‚Äôt find any info on this.
---
Maybe don‚Äôt make assumptions? I have said repeatedly that despite being initially annoyed (and rightfully so, going into the game I didn‚Äôt sign up for many minutes of not being able to do anything at all) I found it very funny afterwards and I had a good laugh. I don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm a ‚Äùsalty survivor‚Äù. 
---
Also, your argument doesn‚Äôt really make sense. If that was the case, they wouldn‚Äôt have blocked us in there for like 35% of the whole match and they wouldn‚Äôt have ruined the game for us on purpose. 
---
The killer would have maybe sat there for a little bit if they found it hilarious, but blocking us to the end was not justified at all, especially since he could have just downed me right after my friend and hooked us both, easy.
---
This made my day
---
thanks for the pointers :)
---
I would make it 30 Second Chase and at most 10 seconds of Aura reading. anything else is just way too long compared toall other Aura reading perks in the game
---
Meh, iri heads are extremely unfun to play against and this is a video game so people like to, you know, have fun. And it‚Äôs not like the survivors knew he was just running the one add on and no perks. I‚Äôve encountered iri head huntresses who also have noed and yeah, shit like that makes the game hilariously lame.
---
You‚Äôre definitely right, the whole reason for the end game was to stop people holding the game hostage at the end. Be that survivors refusing to leave or the killer blocking you in
---
This isn‚Äôt my art, sorry, it‚Äôs pigeon-catcher‚Äôs.
---
And said persecution is already happening lmao.  I‚Äôll probably have the most downvoted post of the day in a few hours.
---
I like the punishment for missing. Legion' s weakness since they nerfed him is that deep wound is never a real threat to survivors, since you have to let them get to safety before it even activates. Reducing the bleedout radius to something like 12 meters would make a big difference imo. That plus his cool down is a little bit too long (.5 or .75 second reduction would be great) and I think a built in status effect for double hitting a survivor would be nice (hindered, broken or mangled).
---
Nah, it isn't fair, you are right, there are strategies in networking to determine that very difference.
---
Flower boy was like ‚Äúdid I actually get that hit lmao‚Äù
---
Holy shit this makes my heart melt, take my upvote god dammit!
---
Not OP but:
---
**Tldr**: the server **can** tell the difference, DBD does not tell the user this but normal networking protocols specify ways to distinguish between timeout and disconnect.
---
**Long answer**: 
---
The game can tell the difference, a timeout would be caused in either of your danger cases, and a special acknowledgement would be made to and from the host for ending a connection. This is common networking practice, especially in p2p networking. 
---
You see this interaction in dbd: whenever a surv just keeps running straight into a wall, that's a survivor timing out. The server isn't changing the state of the survivor so the survivor just keeps moving as they were. After some period of time (say 30 seconds) the survivor will disconnect. It is easy to notice this in code and **can** be handled differently.
---
A normal "quit" dc is clearly different. First, in code the user actually selects a button, which is logged and can be specially treated as a purposeful DC. The connection to the server is not actually terminated here, the client process will notify the server process that they are disconnecting so the server does not need to waste time and power sending information to an unused socket.
---
Bro this is way stronger than prayer beads chill
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
No. He just bragged about killing us because we tried to save the guy.  We played too altruistic. My motto is ‚ÄúAll for one and one for all‚Äù.
---
I meant you saying it was a load was a fair opinion. In this game losing a player hurts the overall experience for both sides and should be punished harshly.
---
I would fucking love to see Feng just hulkamania a Clown onto a hook.
---
I was thinking of changing it to deep wound but deep wound sucks dick now that its attached to terror radius.
---
Look at my other post in this thread. The server can tell the difference.

If so nice! I‚Äôm personally a fungoose fan but I‚Äôve watch otz play Darksouls 2 no taking dmg run for a bit, don‚Äôt know if he finished it.
---
That‚Äôs literally the survivors‚Äô objective though, escape dailies are the survivor equivalent to sacrifice dailies. You don‚Äôt go out of your way to escape; it‚Äôs the natural progression of the game. On the contrary, a mori is (in many cases) something one will put on willingly with the intent of getting the daily out of the way as soon as possible. 
---
A survivor equivalent would be something like ‚ÄúUse a key to escape through the hatch (1) time‚Äù, as the survivor would similarly be hampering the killer‚Äôs ability to pip in a way that is very hard to counter.
---
Nope
---
"hurrr perma body blocking people is the same as stalling a killer for 2 seconds while they hit a survivor. hurrrrr"
---
That's you.
---
Take my updoot
---
Sometimes I get DS strike‚Äôd because the timer is long enough for me to end a chase with a healthy survivor and find another who is the person that has the perk, so I just bite the bullet and say ‚Äúfine, see where 5 seconds gets you‚Äù.  Hookcamping is a rare for me and only do it when nobody pulls up with BBQ. And Noed is never in a build of mine cuz I always lose bp when I use it.
---
I purposefully let Fengs farm and get the hatch, especially if they're baby Fengs.

GENERAL FENGOBI
---
What rank are you? I play killer on PS4 and since getting to top ranks, I've had tons of dc's. I guess a lot of hard trying people think getting nothing for a match as a fuck you to the opponent is better than a regular loss and following the rules. I have never dc'ed yet, and it seems even more counter intuitive for killer than survivor. Que times for survivor are too long for my patience (and bloodpoints are so much more abundant and useful for killers) so I seldom see how things are going on that side of the fence.
---
I really like lithe
---
Are the dedicated servers out?
---
I Think We Did A Pretty Good Job So Far
---
Hey maybe we should just gather and play survivors only
---
I enjoy BL Becca you literally have to drop 7 feet and your in good shape
---
That's what I do unless they are hepatoxic
---
I'm not the same guy, maybe I misunderstood but I took what he said to mean:
---
&gt; It's a load of bullshit that the game can tell the difference
---
And I can tell with 100% certainty that the game is capable of telling the difference between timeout and leave game
---
Again. If a survivor heals me, then thats the same amount of time used as if I had self-cared.
---
If the survivors are healing all game then theyre either
---
a) trolling/throwing
---
b) playing against a good killer that puts pressure on them
---
if its b), you either heal or you get snowballed and slugged.
---
If you do a gen for 36 seconds and dont heal and go down in 36 seconds, you got 36% yourself and 36% for each survivor.
---
If you heal for 36 seconds, get chased right away and go down in 52 seconds, every other survivor already got 52%
---
Thats 144% of gen progress vs 156% gen progress. You just gave your team 11 more % because you could take an extra hit and had that extra amount of chase time.
---
Still Scum bag 100.
---
You on console or pc?
---
Regardless of whether it's reportable or not, it's still very scummy.
---
Ruin or not, you must realised you are doomed!
---
Def buy michael. I would also recommend ghostface, but hes similar to michael
---
Otz tunnels but he waits the 60 seconds, he is a smart killer.
---
Also if survivors say you shouldnt camp or tunnel then survivors shouldnt use infinite loops or use flashlights
---
Also Noed is bascially a great pjnishment for no totem work being done
---
I'm rank 7 right now. I haven't had any of my teammates DC on us, and even when being shoved in with the red ranks the teammates hold strong.  I'm not saying 100% of the killers are this toxic, there are some amazing ones out there, but a fair damn few are.
---
Xbox
---
There's a point in the clip where you begin detecting him. Shortly after, your camera adjusted downward, which took his torso out of view. It happens again later on, and your camera drifts a little bit down, once again canceling the reveal.
---
You don't have to entirely center, just a bit more than what was shown in the clip. (In short, the placement in the clup was "too high" and centering dead set to where Steve's head blocks Ghosty could be considered "too low".)
---
F
---
Downed survivors on hook and no t bagging
---
And? Who said I was defending that?
---
how? she was only blocking them from one way?
---
It's rarer than tea-bagging and has an actual impact on gameplay as an adapted strategy.
---
It's not the same, 32 seconds and 16 seconds is massively different, you're not taking into account what the killer is doing and are assuming it's a flat amount, especially when you start taking into account all the possible buffs/debuffs from the survivors and killer when it comes to interacting with literally anything.
---
wtf rank are you that you actually think the best thing to be doing against a snowballing killer is to just constantly self care, news flash the fact that you're always self caring is actually a big contributor to this killer snowballing.
---
Like I said you're talking about really shitty metrics here, that 11% isn't massive enough to warrant how much time you wasted with that perk and when you think about other heals that literally accomplish the exact same thing you're mentioning in less time self care is less efficient. Once you start throwing in toolboxes, medkits, perks such as adrenaline, botany, we'll make it, group interactions, sloppy butcher, nurse's calling, insta downs, and just how much time you spend healing vs. how much time gens are actually being worked on + how much of the pallets you're using, self-care is legitimately teaching you bad habits to think it's the best option when thinking about ALL this stuff.
---
It's like actually frustrating explaining this stuff to you, you literally sound like you play like those teammates that lose entire matches for survivors that I have to deal with during rank reset.
---
I can make up %'s too btw, if you stay injured and just loop the killer for 2 minutes with Dead Hard and perks such as iron will or resilience, you just occupied tons of time, rather than just self-caring for over half a minute and still going down in under a minute despite "investing" so much time into it.
---
I wouldn't say that's a better game. I kind of give up as killer myself when someone dcs. Usually that means we farm or I let them go a lot
---
Play normally, but DC on third hook. It's what my friend does to stay in purple and it doesn't affect your team in any way. Killer also gets BBQ stacks too.
---
There was only one way in that area, it's a rectangle with one entrance that she was crouched in the middle of so both of them couldn't get out
---
ITT: killer mains clearly care a lot more than the streamer. 
---
Someone dc‚Äôd it looks like, who cares if he didn‚Äôt run, game was already over.
---
Also get a decent internet, before dedicated servers y'all we're blaimg it on the killer's internet but now it's your problem
---
"Oh nononoononoooo..."

*tier 3 music plays*

"Brutal Killer"
---
all I've ever wanted since this game came out is a reverse mori that requires all 4 survivors, where you just beat the killer to death
---
Might want to add the shitpost tag my guy

Kotor DLC confirmed,
---
- Revan, new survivor
---
- Rancor, new Killer 
---
- Dantooine, new map

Truly amazing
---
Some survivors will drop an item and point at it like it's a gift before they leave. That's about as kind as I can see
---
I agree with the leatherface part but wraith didn't go fully invisible... You just need to be alert my dude
---
Wraith? Really?
---
Sorry but that‚Äôs wrong by a mile.
---
Leatherface could use a chainsaw buff he‚Äôs too dependent on 1 perk and Addons to be good enough. 
---
Waith has always been meh.
---
How long have you been playing the game?
---
what song

I can‚Äôt tell if this is a joke. If it is you might wanna put the shitpost tag or you might get downvoted like crazy.
---
I got it today
---
Said nothing about facecamping, I‚Äôm not defending proxy camping if the purpose is to kill the person on hook but if you‚Äôre playing against a 4 man swf that won‚Äôt leave the hook their friend is on why should you? And yes, entitled. Op complains about killers being able to kill someone in two hits
---
I thought you fixed matchmaking BHV...
---
This happens several times every day...
---
AND its demogorgon. His lunge on Windows is crazy anyway
---
That explains everything
---
Maybe had a Jane daily
---
How they are OP and they should make it so you be to do only 3 generators they go so slow
---
Leatherface i can semi agree with but wraith is like hes got to uncloack and catch up and hit you and yes he does have addons which make him more powerful, say windstorm but its easily counterable with sprint burst or maybe an insta heal. The trick with Leatherface is to stick to walls I've found or windows (not as reliable)
---
I think you should send this clip and comment on dbd official forum maybe they will widen that area
---
*Lightborn*
---
Your job as a killer is to end the game with the most generators still standing. DS being used to prevent you getting a kill because you let it get to that point is justified IMO.
---
I had two dc vs my doctor on yamaoka's yesterday, one of them a rank 2. I never though I'd see that. Glad to hear your teammates have been better. Most of those I face that don't quit are pretty good and I still think in general most players are not toxic.
---
Some of yall about to derank &amp; never get back
---
No, it explains how you talk shit about the game/Killers for not being good/ expirienced.
---
Maybe chill, learn a bit more about the game, get better then complain?
---
You got one
---
Yees
---
You say the killer has to end the game with most of the gens still standing, only spirit and nurse can do that
---
I know that sometimes hits shouldn't connect but they do. I play killer as well as survivor. But I don't really think that game problems cause the game to be unenjoyable but the meta perks.
---
This meme made me laugh way more than it should've.
---
Gg
---
Almost everything I agree with. 
---
Accept hex Ruin and gen speed. Hex Ruin isn‚Äôt needed if you‚Äôre good enough and you have pop but everyone praises that it is lol. Pop can do far more if you‚Äôre better.  
---
Gen speed is a hard thing because it makes it more unbalanced against non Swfs and more balanced against swfs. Nerf to toolboxes I‚Äôm down. 
---
And for fuck sakes I found someone who agrees on Noed. I dislike Noed but if there was a change I would make is take away mms. 
---
Noed having just exposed status is completely fine and survivable but having that mms on top is some bs.
---
Ah gotcha. I havent had time to play since the decicated servers. Hopefully they can fix it. There's always a new bug in this game
---
Any killer can do that. Some have it easier, but any killer can end the game before gates are powered.
---
I only kill players that are a challenge.  Most of the time I‚Äôll just max out Brutality, Devious, Hunting, as I am keeping track (best I can) of how many times I have hooked survivors. If I‚Äôm maxed out (points) and everyone has been hooked twice I let them all go.   However if they are a good team or if they play toxic I play for the 4K.  I‚Äôm really all about the bloodpoints.  You don‚Äôt need to kill to get almost max points.
---
\&gt;have Empathy

You can actually see it in the picture haha

He was probably running routine and drivers licence

Players have been all too reliant on SWF to carry them, even a trash team can still make it out if they're using comms to let eachother know where the killers at all times

In certain instances yes in others no.

Oh wait: It *isn't* bannable, because apparently this is only extremely toxic and unfun if your only way to escape is DCing.

Seriously how does this not count as holding the game hostage? You are literally stopping people from leaving: by my definition of hostage that's a pretty accurate fucking example of taking people hostage.

I feel you man, I've been running into more matches with purple or red ranks and I'm just trying to get to rank 9. But the small frustration pushes me to wreck the following game

Soma is your best bet it‚Äôs filled with different monsters but you‚Äôll never see a licensed game like that. Plus if you did it would be super low quality like most games are based on licenses.
---
Survivor queues are fast yeah, but in my experience it's been taking like what feels like 10 minutes at times to find a lobby as a killer, though it has lately become more like 5 or so, But it still is a bit of a bummer when you have a long que time just to be placed into a really laggy lobby,
---
Nancy is more my type tbh.

trapper got nerfed too. he can no longer walk through his traps right after placing them

Dean Martin - That's amore.
---
Not getting downed would be a great solution for your problem. (I know what you mean and I aggree with you :) )
---
At red ranks literally no one plays nice, saying "no way killers are nice to survivors" is just pushing that US vs THEM mentality that is toxic and not good for the community.
---
Look up the song Dean Martin- That's amore.
---
It is only paused if the generator is below 50% completed. The moment the generator hits 50% or the survivor leaves the generator, the exhausted status quickly ticks away after about 2 seconds. That makes the perk virtually unusable because it extremely situational. Like I said, it may DELAY use of an Exhaustion perk but it doesn‚Äôt remove the ability to use it. It buys the killer maybe two seconds and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs only going to really affect someone using Spring burst the vast majority of the time. That‚Äôs what makes it a bad perk and very underwhelming. It doesn‚Äôt technically exhaust you because no other perk or ability exhausts you for that short of a time. 
---
Exhaustion is intended to prevent you from just continuously using those exhaustion perks over and over and over again. In the past exhaustion used to cool down and go away over time, no matter if the survivor was sprinting or not. They changed it to nerf exhaustion perks a bit so that exhaustion will only cool down if the survivor isn‚Äôt sprinting. If they are sprinting, the cool down will pause and persist. Mindbreaker is the only exhaustion causing ability in the game that doesn‚Äôt follow this rule and it makes zero sense even to me as a survivor main.
---
"Reee I suck at looping so I blame it on a killer tunneling me boo hoo oh pity me won't you ever so gracious Reddit users."  In the off chance you do get tunneled, just loop him lol.  If you get farmed however, that's a different story.
---
When he holds down m1 and then your game is done, that‚Äôs a mori!
---
The packs aswell ?

Negative.
---
I had a match the other day where I was Hillbilly for the first time, trying to get three chainsaw hits for a daily ritual. It took me the entire match to figure out how the heck the power even works, and by the time I got the third hit they had finished all five gens and I was ready for the match to be over. So I picked up the survivor I had just downed, dropped her off by the gate, opened it for them, and then ran away to let them escape.
---
I guess I wandered over by the other gate where a Dwight was trying to open it, and I guess I scared him off. So I chased after him (intending to carry him back to the exit so he could escape) but I lost track of him.
---
So, fine, whatever, I just wandered around figuring he'd make his way back to the gate on his own.
---
Next thing I know, the timer runs out and he dies (wherever he was). I must have scared him so bad he didn't know where to go!
---
1) Its not tunneling if i cant find the guy who rescued you
---
2) id rather hit the injured guy than the healthy one
---
You're acting like it's intentional to make the people they get matched up with feel bad. Can't the same be said about being a rank 3 killer getting matched with a rank 18?
---
Not enough damage...rookie
---
I'm a killer main and I do agree the updates has let me get hits that I know wouldn't have landed before. But hang In there man they'll update and fix things soon enough.
---
If they break off you so you can do 2 gens your not getting tunnelled.
---
Are you a killer main?
---
I started playing last week and I was getting matched with rank 8s as a level 20 killer lol. It was awful. Worse yet they still felt the need to insult me for how bad I was despite playing for like only a day.
---
And now I'm rank 14 and getting matched with rank 20 survivors 
---
Quality match making.
---
Only bad thing I‚Äôve been experiencing on PC is dead hard not working at all.
---
I try my best to be civil always lol
---
Play With your Food is pretty much trash and you should find something else to use. The only time you should want a survivor to get away is if you were already chasing someone else and they got in the way. Otherwise you're gimping yourself just to get the perk's benefit.
---
This needs to happen, these games should do a crossover some how.
---
M&amp;A got changed, every level does 8m now. Only difference is in the FOV changes.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend either of those perks for Myers. But I can say pwyf can be good just in general but it‚Äôs hard to find a spot to replace a perk with it. 
---
Pwyf is mostly used on leatherface because it makes him good and same with 2 addons. 
---
You can be a good lf without addons or that perk but it just makes it that much more hard.
---
What is the problem? This is working exactly like it should. 
---
&gt;If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
Both maybe is because I play in ps4 with no endgame chat but the only messages  I recibe are from salty survivors
---
you could have ran when she hit you though lol
---
That explains it, no killers Gona individually message 4 separate people saying gg ez, that‚Äôs pathetic.
---
I usually don't play nurse because not only is she not fun to play against but she's not even fun to play. 
---
But I had a daily for her, and given my crippling bloodpoint addiction I decided to play a match or two.
---
I just think it makes the game boring and short. And you don‚Äôt gain nearly as much BP from first hook moris. Everybody can play the game how they want but as a killer main I only use them on death hook purely for the fun and BP.
---
Woulda been funny if you changed it to ‚Äúdegenerates like you belong on a hook‚Äù instead of cross
---
Could have been, the match in question was last night on Xbox.
---
It was just on sale like a week ago, i highly doubt it
---
Love otz, scream this post so every fuckin killer I‚Äôve played in the past 3 weeks hears it please. I‚Äôve been doing killer since release just recently started playing surv to max Ash for his new outfit and it has been straight cancer bro we barely win matches and if we do it‚Äôs because it borrowed and decisive, the minute we don‚Äôt run those we get decimated

mine was a couple nights ago on switch so i guess not
---
Balanced landing is the strongest on maps where it can be used (probably needs some kind of rework to make it consistent on flat maps while not breaking maps like Haddonfield and Hawkins) and Dead Hard is the most Consistently good. Lithe will actually let you lose the killer as opposed to just extending chases like most of the others.
---
Pig,micheal
---
Need to steal this as a Discord server emote.
---
From a design perspective, that isn't a reasonable point. It doesn't matter why they were there, what matters is that the game allowed a killer to hold players hostage and ruin the fun of the game
---
I also play on ps4 and get messaged ‚Äúgg‚Äù by killers that face camp me or tunnel me. The high rank ones are especially salty lol
---
Very classy move
---
That's the real solution. This shouldn't be possible in the first place.
---
^
---
So behind you is Myers, you are working on the gen, and I can only presume that the squares in the top right are perks?
---
Luckily I had half a wiggle bar because he forgot he had carried me a moment before dropping me to go kill my teammate.
---
I have to say... I watch this movie every year around Christmas as tradition. This would be a hilarious addition to the game. Though I hate to think of what his Mori would look like. üòÇ
---
It's been glorious hasn't it. Since that update I've only let one survivor in a SWF escape and that was because, after I killed her other friends and had her dead to rights, she kneeled before me and offered me a medkit. Since that was the first time that's happened to me, a tinge of satisfaction from my black heart moved me to let her have the hatch afterwards. Turns out she was a rank 19. My motto is usually "no mercy", but I thought I would try something new when that happened.
---
No it's not "US vs THEM" it's a game and we're all together you need both sides to have fun and that kind of toxic shit only makes the game garbage for everyone.
---
I never agreed that people at red ranks let people go through gates, in fact if you actually read my reply you'd see that I agree with you, no one is being nice at red ranks that's the point of high rank, everyone is a tryhard and will do whatever it takes to win.
---
When you loop round a rock, Cause the killer sucks cock, That‚Äôs amore
---
When you‚Äôre facing the hag And she has her mint rag, that‚Äôs amore
---
Wraiths bell will ring ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling, As he‚Äôs camping the basement

Heartbeat will sound tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay, Oh shit it‚Äôs the doctor
---
When the generator explodes and you're instantly exposed, That's amore

When your placed in a trap that instantly snaps, that‚Äôs amore
---
We need more
---
Dude has a long finger!
---
That series is on Hulu, not Netflix just FYI.
---
Found a david i took a hit for tbagging the killer while injured and blocked off the pallet
---
*laughs in bloodwarden*
---
It takes one itchy nose to kill ya.
---
Should have edited the eagle sound in when he dropped down. That was hilarious
---
I've played like 4 different games as a survivor where Myers popped T3 but when he hit me I only got injured, weird experience lol
---
u/vredditshare
---
She's dead like The Simpsons!
---
I slugged 4 almost immediately last week. I let them all go (one already dc‚Äôd) and let them finish most gens before I ended it. Ending it quick is great for your ego but sucks for pips.
---
That‚Äôs a horrible unbalanced stupidly op perk....
---
Missing your power attack is fine. But everything else should be rethought. I've always thought they nerfed legion too hard
---
As a survivor dealing with him, I'll say the best demo players I've encountered really make good use of the teleports.
---
https://gfycat.com/ThisLeftIrishdraughthorse
---
666? The number? 
---
Well it‚Äôs my favorite number! &lt;3
---
Immediately after I posted this I had a match with one. Spoopy.
---
Syringes are equally a huge problem, just like Keys and Moris imo. I remember reading something on the Forums about how the plan of changing Syringes to be a heal over time, like Steve's second wind. I hope this does happen, because it sucks to have pressure instantly lost to a Syringe.
---
Nah
---
Oh no.. god forbid someone rapidly uses the crouch button! That‚Äôs like, so messed up man!
---
If a killer lets me wiggle free after another survivor sandbagged me or gives me hatch, I always crouch in front of them and bob my head up and down.
---
 A lot of Demo players I've met since playing survivor more don't even use his portals. Which kind of confuses me. I use his portals for survivor detecting and totem/gen protection.
---
Lol no it didnt, it would match to the lowest rank in the party so there would be 3 red ranks &amp; 1 green/yellow
---
Now it matches from the top down so instead of giving you the lowest possible it gives you the closest to the highest
---
I mean you barely got any points so might aswell take the free double depip I guess
---
Eek I‚Äôm scared
---
Especially in maps with a tall building centrally located. If you're able to leap from height you get crazy distance.
---
It's like a lunchbox, but spooky
---
This is again a bad idea. Super bad. Going against Legion and Plague will be nearly impossible. I have thought of this and quickly realized thinking of a perk like this must mean I understand nothing about how to play survivor. 
---
The game is hard as is for survivors, especially for randoms. this would also destroy SWF teams and give them no chance since they have to be in groups all the time
---
CRIKEY! Look at the edge on this one!
---
it is causing problems sometimes for ppl and for those who only have ever played killer they are now sorta experiencing what it is like not to be the host. with that being sad they do have issues that need addressing and since they are testing them im sure they will be improved
---
People already gen tap with ruin and against certain spirit builds.
---
The atmosphere is kind of killed on its own after a neon colored Jake with Cheeto dust all over his pants butt dances a wraith who swings directly into the wall.
---
Haha tunneler karma
---
Usually they just hit you with the ggez
---
I don‚Äôt mean to sound rude, but your logic there is non-existent. If I felt ‚Äùashamed‚Äù or ‚Äùstupid‚Äù, I wouldn‚Äôt have posted this here, now would I have? Some of you people are making assumptions based on nothing, gee.
---
‚ÄùA tad annoying‚Äù, _exactly_. That it was, but like I said earlier I found it really funny afterwards, and absurd to say the least.
---
You can‚Äôt seriously tell me you‚Äôd be prepared for something like this to happen in a match? That I was a complete moron for not being able to anticipate that the killer would sneak up on me, then instead of downing me like my friend they‚Äôd block me in a corner for 35% of the match?
---
Yeah if she let them out and chased she'd only get one at best this way she got both. It was a bad play by the survivors that she capitalized on. Seems fair to me
---
Thats hot, thats hot...
---
I just wish they didn't force the Dedicated servers on live. The 'survey' doesn't even have a comment section for you to report bugs or anything. The servers are nowhere near ready and yet PC players are being forced to suffer through all the glitches and bugs because ???
---
This should have been put on the PTB along with the Nurse Addon changes.
---
Possible but bannable
---
I hate this shit. Worse than tbaggin
---
I'm sure the killers your group bullied will miss you.
---
Franklins in my opinion isn‚Äôt a good perk. A halfway decent survivor can remember where they get hit and simply come back later. And yes the decrease in charge is okay but there‚Äôre perks out there.
---
I still bully easy killers tho. I had to derank. So now we‚Äôre bullying constant easy killers. Almost to the point where I miss a challenge.
---
Hey that‚Äôs 100 times better then what I can do. Keep it up!
---
Uh it just looks the same but sure next time I'm on I will
---
Can you stop spamming the subreddit with terrible perk ideas every 30 minutes
---
Ah yes fuck the rank 20s
---
Survs can't gen rush if they are all injured. They'll go selfheal for 20mins in a corner.
---
If you tunnel however, they won't be injured so they won't care and will do gens in your face.
---
Actually not bad. I enjoy this picture it‚Äôs not stellar to where I‚Äôd hang it up as a masterpiece. But it‚Äôs really good.
---
Be cleansed in holy fire, you filthy heretic.
---
I guess its a little weird, but he's a demon possessed mass murderer either way, so pile on the sadistic.
---
I see you had a bad game.
---
BETTER TOGETHER&gt; DEJA FUCKIN VU
---
Yes. The chances to remove a reverse bear trap are entirely random and using luck offerings or perks will increase the chances of you getting it off earlier
---
I think im the only person but Nurse is my main
---
No, you'd need it if your the last survivor alive. I should've put in that you can't open exit gates while injured.
---
Maybe freddy or ghosty
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm considering playing him in a live action series I‚Äôm working on.
---
False lighting is a bit op
---
Aw sick keep us updated
---
No limit. The exhaustion aspect balances it. No need for the different stun duration per level either.
---
I could see Ghostface doing absolutely anything possible to mess with the survivors.
---
Agree, Jane is disgusting
---
Got chainsawed by a Billy but still got a pallet stun???? This game sometimes

Can you also tell them to stop giving the Plague her power? Thank you.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. Either he hits the Jake, who just does the exact same thing or he brakes the pallet which leads Jake escaping anyway.
---
Well that hillbilly was pretty easy to fool because he broke a pallet that I put down with his chainsaw and I hid in a locker and he never found me I thought the same thing could‚Äôve happened if I did it again
---
It‚Äôs irritating seeing memes like this. Calm down, nice guy killer, you‚Äôre not cool, fun, or chill cuz you give out hatch to people you deem worthy. Put yourself back in your place
---
What does it mean to have dedicated servers? What‚Äôs the difference from what it was previously?

Gifted to me personally by the entity...jk my sister made it for me so idk tbh xD
---
They need to make Feral Frenzy a threat for sure. Maybe for each hit survivor, it buffs you, increasing duration of Feral Frenzy, vault speed, running speed, etc. I mean, a killer should never have to rely on add-ons or perks to make their power remotely useful. Deep Wound really needs a change. Perhaps being afflicted with Deep Wound can give penalties to healing, vaulting, and repair speed. It makes sense. Deep Wound is supposed to be an extreme attack that leaves the Survivor needing to mend it.
---
I put it in lol
---
I love it! Especially the amount of detail on the finger knife glove and the face!! when it comes to drawing Freddy Krueger for me those are the main things that I struggle on, but you seem to handle them perfectly! And Freddy Krueger really does look like the burnt dream man he is. Also I have a question and I really don't want to come off as rude.
---
I've had too many games where Plague downs/hurts multiple people at once due to the randos cleansing every 5 seconds.
---
Holy shit that's dank
---
because the vest looks like richtofen's, and the 2.0 crew carry the blood vials, similar to the yellow serum vials
---
If the killer has killed a survivor(with three hooks) and hook another at least once before 2 gens are completed they‚Äôre most likely gonna win.
---
Using a cypress Mori before hooking at all: **BIG BRAIN**
---
Okay, well again, you are either exaggerating, or having problems on YOUR END connecting to the server. The most I've experienced is some slight, stuttering lagspikes, and ive played a similar number of games.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs not that simple due to snowball potential or Noed...... 
---
Signs that survivor is winning: Killer is chasing around the wrong person for more then 30 seconds.
---
We were able to start the game without a killer and load into the game but got dced a few seconds in. :(
---
Please pay your respects to our big survivor party. F
---
Downvoted for the edit
---
Nice job my guy/girl
---
Reminds me of when the survs had all but one gen done and then decided to get cocky. They made a whole lot of exploitable mistakes, plus the fact that they had all been hooked at least once made a complete 180¬∞ and 4K possible
---
Well if he lives across the country for you he will have terrible internet. 
---
Nothings wrong with checking the ping of the lobby and leaving.
---
it's really good on hag. put a trap on the dropped item, they always come back for that flashlight...
---
It shows you his ping in the pre game lobby.  I always check in case I need to dodge.
---
I mean, I can't help being good at the game lmao, I just wanna play with my friends without waiting an hour and getting unfairly matched compared to everyone but me
---
They‚Äôre tunneling someone every game, it‚Äôs just not you
---
Holy hell thats amazing!
---
[Hrrrngh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixWybGQnPHQ)
---
I just feel as though the coloring really hurts it. But I do really really appreciate it &lt;3
---
I didn‚Äôt say I disconnect, I hook suicide
---
With that out of the way, lemme tell ya. They never rescue me when it‚Äôs early game hook, even if killer is doing something else far Away like hooking someone else, or he camps me the entire match successfully and my rescuers never bring borrowed time
---
So even if I stay I still lose and don‚Äôt even get blood points. Literally no fucking reason to stay. I fucking told you this, man! You even reading or just skimming?
---
This is legit one of the best shitposts I‚Äôve seen this year. Lol.
---
Does it effect spine chill now?
---
I mean he is but I didn't really know until someone told me.
---
Even if it was roburt England I doubt they could transfer his face properly to the game.
---
If ya wanna wanna pretend he is Robert like in so I dont think it would be too hard.
---
Do people with bad ping suffer independently or does everyone in the lobby suffer as well?
---
Awww thanks a lot haha ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
You are a troll. I looked through your comments on this and you clearly either haven't thought this out, or are doing it to get a rise out of people.
---
Survivor for me take about 5 mins killer is about 15-25 I play on PS4
---
Still, who goes: Oh iri? DC. I find that kinda sad. How would the game be if the killer disconnected every time the survivor had an insta heal, a key or a flashlight or decisive or adrenaline?
---
Happens to me every single time I manage to reroll to a survivor one. I'll complete the match with X, and then without fail I get out of the match and it's a killer ritual again.
---
I haven't tried the dedicated servers but people are saying they're so bad that everyone suffers always no matter how good everyone's internet is.  Overall, they seem pretty bad atm.
---
Then it turns out to be Shroud of Separation to fool-scare the survivors
---
I didn‚Äôt say that it doesn‚Äôt happen in competitive sports. I said that when it *does* happen it‚Äôs penalized.  
---
If you taunt in the NFL you can be ejected because it‚Äôs unsportsmanlike and worthless. Why do we put up with it and just ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù in video games? 
---
I understand why people do it. They‚Äôre insecure and hate themselves, but I disagree that the solution is to just deal with it. What‚Äôs that fixing? Should we just ‚Äúdeal with it‚Äù when the government is corrupt or when the police shoot black people? That‚Äôs a bad mentality to have. I know it‚Äôs just video games and it‚Äôs not that serious but come on. 
---
 I play games to have fun and escape from the shitty world for a little bit. I can‚Äôt do that with this game because no one cares about the person on the other side.
---
Dreading the PS4 rollout. I‚Äôm in Australia and by all accounts we‚Äôll be connecting to Asia or somewhere similar which will effectively kill the game here. Yay
---
I want so badly to take BT and DS off my loadout to make fun builds, but everytime I do a camping tunneling killer just has to ruin the match for everyone and have no fun allowed.
---
Legion injures everyone and then watches as they are required to heal each other and with third seal he can just have a tea party while he has infinite never-ending pressure.
---
Well the flow of the game can always shift around but a killer is winning when Survivors are healing and unhooking instead of doing gens, He would have a strong lead up until a person decides it to get on a gen but by then can can probably get a kill and with the others hooked he can force their hand
---
I think it perfect. A week gives player enough time to get enough iri shards for a perk
---
It's an exhaustion perk. They're all op.
---
Fair point
---
Not if you can't open the gate while injured.
---
That is the best gaming chair I've ever seen.
---
God you sound entitled. There's scummy shit to do on both sides; there are ways survivors can make it where killers can NOT pick someone up off that ground while they crawl the last like 10 feet to exit gate, and that's not even considering something like ds, just standing over the survivor one at a time makes the killer have to hit each of you if they want at the down guy, and just body block for each other on your way out. On the same token, killers can do things like this and facecamp ect. There's really unfair things people can do on both sides and while it's one of the core problems of the problems this game does have imo, these things do exist on both sides and it should be acknowledged as such. Your hurr durr comment just makes you look like a full salty survivor main lmao.
---
Ad hominem.
---
Clown is garbage, absolutely no slowdown, Trappers slows himself and Myers is just a basic boring m1 killer. Pig has ambush and traps. If you're not a good killer you're gonna struggle playing Pig. If you're a good killer, know right build for Pig and can actually play Pig she's decent. I'm not saying top tier or anything but above average.  
---
I forgot to mention Doctor is worse than Pig as well.
---
Legion "main" who doesn't understand how to actually play legion.
---
I can confirm it is usually me
---
I don;t give a f about what majority of the community thinks. Majority of the community are potatoes so why would I care?
---
Or if the killer is watching the hook from a distance waiting for survivors to unhook (or standing away with a huntress hatchet ready)
---
You can DM me about it. I do more digital than traditional. It'd be best to discuss it there. :P
---
Speed is one thing. Killer stuns with no limit are too over powered and wouldn't only reinforce certain toxic gameplay aspects.
---
Well it technically is and it‚Äôs a character in dbd and stranger things. It‚Äôs also a song name by Jared dines. 
---
But the core of it is a mythological creature and I‚Äôm not sure of what mythology it‚Äôs from.
---
I don't understand DCing at all. I've only done it when the lag is so bad the game is unplayable. Otherwise you loose your points. Why would you want even the smallest amount of points gone to prove a point?
---
If i run into a toxic killer that is really bad, i block them and move on. This wasn't toxic, it was bad survivor plays
---
Mother Daughter Ring and Prayer Beads?
---
Any videos with this build?
---
Can we get this in reverse to slough through bodyblocks as killer xD? Btw it needs to be more than just against killer if they make a change like this; I've had more survivors block me in than killers in roughly 300 hours of survivor play. Like survivors just coming up and blocking me in a corner/blocking me from using the only door out of a area lol.
---
Definitely for the blood points. If you feel like you have time, kill them later. If the survivors are good, kill them early (or just to avoid DS at a bad time). I like to bring an Ebony for insurance rather than ez mode.
---
 If I send a clip to BHVR with clear proof that someone is taunting they should take action. Why is it okay for Ghostface to leave me on the ground for five minutes as the last man alive and teabag me? That literally happened to me yesterday. 
---
They *should* care because more and more people are going to quit the game and they won‚Äôt have people playing anymore 
---
My friends don‚Äôt do it and neither do I. If I see a random teammate do it I message them and tell them to knock it off and then I get replies like ‚Äúlol whatever‚Äù. I‚Äôm just tired of trying to be a good example because no one cares. 
---
I just play games to have fun man and this game isn‚Äôt fun for me anymore.
---
This with unnerving, overcharge, distressing, lullaby, and ruin.  Pick any of those perk combinations and make it literally fucking impossible, especially if it's a doctor WITH EVEN HARDER SKILL CHECKS.
---
Especially down here at lower ranks. Killers will eat 2 pallets, miss a lunge at window, and immediately DC. Neither side of the playerbase is free of blame. Survivors are just the scapegoat because there's 4 survs for every 1 killer.
---
Edit: Why am I being downvoted for saying that Killers can and do DC lmao
---
