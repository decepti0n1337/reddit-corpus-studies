I know that, just providing context for why toxic behavior could occur from survivors.  
---

---
I don't play toxically and don't take it personally, I stopped playing because there are too many aspects that aren't fun. Spirit is not fun. Ruin, pop, corrupt intervention, mori perk/offering combos weren't fun. It wasn't about losing for lack of skill. Randomly getting chosen first and camped limiting my blood point earning rate really sucked. 
---
Life is short I shouldn't be forcing something. Having to play for 1000 hours before the "real game unlocks" isn't worth it either. I'm glad I tried it, I definitely see how a better developer could make this into something truly winning.

I accidentally did that last night and he toggled on I didn't mean to crouch i'm so sorry team

No it‚Äôs hitboxes

Apparently that was cancelled back in 2016. Ouch.

Why ppl send gg on PS4 I get it on PC post game chat but in PS4 you gotta do a whole lotta stuff just to send gg lol
---
My favourite killer theme is really tough between legion and stranger things, they're just so good
---
Wait your getting aura readings? I was running prayer beads and weaved ring so I don't lose it
---
well until they fix the totem spots all totems are functionally useless
---
its better than nothing
---
Ok that makes sense. Also I have to recommend using Stridor. It makes hearing survivors much easier especially when haunting.
---
Well, you could've meant atmosphere, but in that case, I'd be out.
---
Hold your horses there "buddy", that was a typo.
---
 Everything I said is correct and I cited a source for you to check the requirements of emblems if you doubted me. If you got off your high horse maybe you wouldn't be so toxic. Food for thought. üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Is RL Stine even still alive much less writing new books?
---
I never played it, but I've always respected the concept.
---
Just had some guy say I'm gonna make you squeel like a pig. Thought it was the killer. Was a bill. Popped a gen on purpose, got downed, and quit. Good times.
---
oh ok mb
---
I played the beta. It was fun. Just as im a killer main in DBD and monster main in Evolve, i was a DM main in Fable. You could upgrade your units to give them special abilities like cloaks and grabs. We need some good asyms. I wish evolve didnt kill itself.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Imagine thinking head on is a try hard perk:P
---
Brave infantry have made the ultimate sacrifice.
---
Does nurse's calling work with the spirit when survivors are invisible?
---
Theres a reason dbd has a reputation for having a toxic, garbage community
---
Pffft okay kiddo, ‚Äú Eblams are 8 fousansX4=firty fousand, u so tocsick, I have link dat show nuthing as end gam he didn‚Äôt  show emblems so me gessing‚Äù

Honestly Overwatch is just a free to play game with a 40 dollar price tag to unlock all characters..

Ehhhh few fucked ones but it‚Äôs better fixing totem spots then hallucinating the survivors.

My heartbeat goes up when the heartbeat gets louder and he still just looks at the wall instead of looking for the killer.
---
I don't stream so I'm not sure if it will help, but playing on low settings is better in so many ways, you should do that
---
? Apexes can be finished by getting 6 levels a week, which means simply playing, doing the 3 instant level up challenges, the 2 daily challenges (finish 5, then 10) and in that time you‚Äôll have earned enough xp to level up the pass by default. Apexes isnt a money hungry system you can get to max level by just doing challenges for an hour or two every week for 3-4 days
---
Watched that video. Good commentary overall.
---
They all got a cruel fate. F13 ate the lawsuit, Last Year is TECHNICALLY alive, but in limbo because they're afraid to launch on Steam and be review-bombed, Soul at Stake...actually seems very similar to DbD, but with somewhat stronger Survivors/Gamblers, and Evolve is VERY dead.
---
White Noise 2 is an absolute masterpiece, but nobody even heard of it before it was too late.
---
There's also The Hidden, an HL2 mod, and some non-1vX games, like L4D, Killing Floor 2, and Deciet. They're more alive, but also not 1vs.
---
Personally I can't stand these offerings. They remove any consequence or risk for bringing something super powerful or super rare. It's just an excuse for a commodious to a box  or Skeleton Key. It's also an excuse for the iridescent killer add-ons that should be extremely powerful and rare. Along with broken builds. Such as iridescent head huntress, infinite Evil Within 3 or Tombstone Myers, Turner hillbilly or sniper doctor, and of course everyone's favorite Omega or 5 blink nurse and prayer beads spirit.
---
I've seen players and I know players who have hundreds of black and white Wards. They can use the same busted build practically every match with little risk or punishment and high payoff. A lot of the time it's just a bad player who shouldn't have won that match but got carried by a BS item. At least White Ward has a counter with Franklin's demise though.
---
agreed. most of the time my queues are fairly quick. during the most recent blood hunt it was impossible to queue for killer though   :((
---
YES! I|t c| A|n|
---
as ive said to others totem spot fixes are on the top of my wish list but the community asked 300+ times and they still spawn in the open
---
this will give killers breathing room and is better than nothing
---
When you play both sides and thus feel both sides of the pain
---
Doing pull-ups is universal that the killer is camping
---
Yes he is, probably the only way to make his chainsaw consistently reliable. Though I personally won't say a single perk is single-handedly enough to make him viable as a whole, at least compared to other killers.
---
Chucky is a middle aged man in a doll, Freddy only likes kids, not men stuck in a doll
---
Maybe. Or maybe OP said something antagonistic to provoke the messages in the screenshot. I don‚Äôt think we have enough information to make very definitive claims.
---
Lmao doesnt broken key mind channel only show you unfinished gens within a certain distance? I'm pretty sure that's all it does with those add ons
---
EDIT: I could be wrong here
---
The next person to bring an ebony mor√≠ will fail this course, I kid you not.
---
They announced plans to release it on Steam by a deadline that's already passed, but apparently the backlash on Discord was enough to scare them out of it indefinitely.
---
Was I playing like trash or was plague's vomit not hitting anything on dedicated
---
Ahhh I see what you‚Äôre saying.
---
I think we are speaking past each other a little bit here. I was only debating that this perk build was not ‚Äúthe only reliable perk build to consistently beat good survivors‚Äù. I think I misread your message a little. Which is my fault. I misunderstood you to say that this perk build was the only build that would consistently beat survivors. In other words this perk build is un-counterable. I was making the point that the build
---
IS in fact counterable (excluding the ebony because ebony moris are broken) because I have played as killer and against killers who have run this build and it has been countered but organized and good survivors. Even at high ranks, this build is counterable. In the same way that adrenaline, DS, Dead Hard, and BT is counterable
---
The PTB bringing bugs with it? Who'd of thunk? No way to really stop it, the PTB in general is horribly misused to test changes.
---
Dead hard, balanced landing, lithe. In that order.
---
They‚Äôre buffing the blood points next patch.
---
When a Survivor leaves both survivor and killer get 600 bloodpoints
---
When on a chase (survivor) if you drop a pallet you get 100 points
---
When you are wiggling, every second you get 20 blood points
---
They‚Äôre also buffing some add ons
---
Emergency Med kit is hella fucking fast wen self healing but the charges is decreased. So basically a normal Emergency Med kit gets you to two heal state in total.
---
Perks have been buffed (Survivor Perks)
---
Plunders can now see an item on the ground (including other survivors that dropped)
---
Plunders will now increased the chance of getting a rare item by its tier (T1, T2, T3)
---
Stealth killers (Wraith, Ghostface, T1 Myers, Pig) aura will not show. So that means if your using Object of Obsession you will not see there aura. This also includes Kindred
---
Okay, so it's EXACTLY the HiRez system.
---
That's not fair, someone who doesn't enjoy playing survivor or killer still deserves to have some input. If that's input is used to justify their toxicity, that's when they should stfu about it.
---
well mori-ing involves a fair bit of attacking in that matter.
---
They devs said they wanted it to be more difficult to pip, but it‚Äôs more difficult to not rank up lol
---
HaTe?
---
This is the ultimate no u
---
Right but you're going against one person with crutch perks. Not four.
---
It‚Äôs a hyperbole, heard of it? Nurses, Billies, and Spirits were the most used killers in the red ranks because of the fact they‚Äôre power was so strong. You‚Äôre entire thread is you whining about a new change that needed your favorite killers base kit. I want to see you try to consistently get as many kills as you do on Nurse on C or lower tier killers like Piggy or Wraith.
---
PLEEEEEAASSSEEE
---
I really don't mind Getting tunneled while playing as a survivor, and I am a killer main I don't mind DS and flashlights etc, BUT WHY T-BAGGING, That's why I main Ghost face so I can counter the T-bag with a t-bag
---
I was just saying dont be toxic if it is such a big deal i can change the title
---
Writing* Also, it probably took him 45 seconds to think and come up with that paragraph. Also, he doesn't show signs of being upset? He's just adding to the post. And what he wrote makes sense.
---
I like legion but spirit rivals nurse, nurse is still better tho
---
With my lucky is going to be when I am in the university
---
Gotta agree.
---
The same thing is happening to me. I can‚Äôt play the ptb at all lol.
---
Except Clown‚Äôs name is Kenneth Chase and anyone who uses the Jeffrey Hawk moniker is a blasphemer.

If you want theme teams, you need Pig and Ghostface. Both of you just try to blend in with the Survivors.
---
The huntress is free for everyone, as is David King. You have to download the Lullaby for the Dark chapter.
---
Don‚Äôt cleanse, ever. Please. I‚Äôve lost far too many games because a single baby dweet got some green stuff on his shirt and he felt the need to literally kill us all.
---
Omg I love it
---
Great points, i withdraw. My apologies
---
Probably because we live in different areas
---
Hm. Now I feel really smart. Thank you :D
---
You sir are right, it's just a game. I just got into the game a few weeks ago and now I'm considering leaving it because of the toxic community lol
---
That was great.
---
Honestly as long as object hitboxes are bullshit, survivor hitboxes should be bullshit. I get my hatchets tanked by debris that isn't even there more than I get hits on survivors that don't actually touch them.
---
Live or die, make your choice.
---
10/10
---
Doctor and Hag is just them both crowding through tunnels trying to chase someone, unless she has her teleport at will addon.
---
Doctor and Myers means assume you are being watched AT ALL TIMES.
---
She instantly left after the game ended too. It was extremely satisfying to put a toxic spirit in her place lmao.
---
hahah 10/10
---
&gt; 1, tunneling a smart strategy, why go for the person that takes 2 hits to kill when you could go for the person that takes 1 hit? 
---
Pressure. 3 full health people will be on gens while you chase that guy around.
---
&gt;2, that huntress was being logical, though they should have killed the kate at the end, since that can be seen as teaming, and could get them banned.
---
No she was toxic, She purposely ignored kate. She literally went against the entire point of the game.
---
*\[ Muffled megalovania in the distance progressively gets louder \]*

He‚Äôs been drinking that can for 40 years smh.

#S P E E D
---
I don't defend tea-bagging or any kind of toxicity, but to be fair this is a very false equivalence. 
---
On one hand, you have tunneling/camping, toxic tactics that deeply change the gameplay experience of the targeted player for the worse (depip, less BP, waste of items and offering). On the other hand, you have teabagging, a very rude but also very empty gesture, which doesn't alter the gameplay loop at all. If you were going to lose, you'll still lose, if you were going to win, you'll still win. It's just bad manners.
---
Again I don't defend these bad manners, but I just think it's a bad argument to compare them with camping and tunneling.
---
Time To Play
---
I'm new to the game and am already a killer main, but anyways, what is considered toxic? Like what actions and stuff?
---
The Mettle of Man ‚Äú‚Äùbuff‚Äù‚Äù is the biggest middle finger ever.
---
Hey, do you get those masks retroactively if you owned the game early? I have frosted eyes on everyone free but don't own Legion.
---
I am. I love the game and this is a new way I can support the Devs. Plus it‚Äôs a new reason to keep playing.
---
that's why it'd be different every day
---
it feels good to see someone else is having the exact problem! I thought I was the only one who's having it lol.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I definitely agree, injured doesn't necessarily mean dead, again even injured you can still run a decent chase if you learn to pallet loop.
---
I love Iron Will with stealth builds. Right now i'm running Iron Will, Urban Evasion, Spine Chill and Sprint Burst, but I might swap Spine Chill for resilience to get that repair speed bonus, which i'm finding that the extra speed can help get that generator done at the last second. I may take a down but usually someone runs Borrowed Time. Time is everything in this game, and i'd rather spend those seconds finishing a gen than healing myself and risking no progress.
---
Yes. With 28 stab wounds.
---
The killer in me wants them to so I can murder in more unique ways, but the survivor in me is tired of being mori'd
---
That's not true; we don't pretend to be polite much.
---
Nice template
---
In my experience on Xbox, the trolling/toxic shit is rather prevalent up to rank 9-8, an then the behavior becomes a bit cleaner but the Skill of the killers really ramp up between rank 9-8.
---
As a killer main myself I practically waltz into rank 8 as survivor an then hit a brick wall of difficulties with playing solo and being a scapegoat.
---
I managed to get to rank 4 an the difference in how well my teammates played was nuts compared to how they were playing in the purple ranks.
---
So TLDR, the higher the rank the harder it gets, but the less bullshit you gotta put up with.
---
Bruh... that was so fucking fantastic
---
It's not like you get that many of them lol
---
Good shit
---
FUN DETECTED. DEPLOYING MONSTER MASH...
---
Then simply Y O I N K them off hatch when they jump
---
Same! I‚Äôve been looking to see if anyone else posted about it. Spent an entire game following the killer wondering why they wouldn‚Äôt hit me only to be told I didn‚Äôt move the entire game.
---
creepy! i love it!
---
*spine chill PTSD intensifies*
---
If old Laurie is added I wand old Myers as well
---
are they in animation? cause it could be who manages to hit it first as without dedicated servers the survivor could be in jump animation yet the killer still closes it
---
I would've closed it AFTER hooking the survivor.
---
and this is why you do not act like a prick
---
I ship it
---
Sadly no. She doesn‚Äôt really need it though. You can see where the heal is happening then phase since they‚Äôll probably be in the same place. I use Discordance, Sloppy butcher (great for tracking during phasing), make your choice and either ruin or stridor. Never use chase perks either, only use tracking and gen protecting. Or auto down perks. Don‚Äôt let nurses calling hold you back from getting spirit
---
Self care is definitely try harding, but people that use it aren't good enough to realize they're better off without it
---
the killer wanted to be a asshole that is why  they dropped him to give him a false hope that she was letting him go
---
Very cuteeeee c:
---
Disco~~r~~dance
---
I've never seen anybody but me play her
---
you do know you cannot grab someone jumping in hatch anymore right?
---
Sometimes on ps4 people come back after an event and play with their perks but usually it is smurfing no lie
---
Just a killer doing his job
---
Thank you :)
---
You are such a Meg
---
Well I would stop doing that since it's how you say "The killer is near me. Don't save."
---
T bagging a survivor that clearly sees that she has no chance of survival is shameful. It's not like she had a chance. You be the big man and enjoy your victory üòí
---
Yep. Also the single reason why I hate spirits.
---
I‚Äôd go for spirit since I love her, or for pig since make your choice is really fun in my opinon. David for dead hard would be good too. But I would definitely go for spirit or pig. Huntress is fun too but I don‚Äôt like her perks at all
---
Hell yeah
---
Put some respek on my girl meg
---
I dont think you understand how fast I am.... I'm fast as fuck boiiii
---
I hate the types that carry you to hatch and close it. Just hook me and close it after if you really want the points, jerk.
---
The ol' Bait and switch
---
Ha ha, I'd like to think so. Sometimes I just get tunneled match after match ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What do you play on? I have some tips just msg me so we can have a convo or something
---
Nea got fresh outfits so...no
---
FAX
---
Dwight, Bond is really good for solo queue, and for killer do Clown for PGTW
---
It's alright, we were all new at one point.
---
I have been playing survivor without leveling up survivors and I'm rank 8 getting a pip every game even when doing pretty awful. I'm a killer main, rank 4, and had so much more trouble climbing in general.
---
I asked the same question a few days ago. All my responses said spirit so I got her and trust me it‚Äôs worth it. She‚Äôs really fun and imo not too hard to learn.
---
don't you mean unique wedding ring or those other aura perks?
---
Watch Otzdarva on yt and twitch. His yt is "not otzdarva" and his twitch is otzdarva. He's really helped me learn what I'm doing wrong and how to get better
---
It happens to me now.
---
But you see my friend the loophole here is that when we are playing the killer we are no longer a human who cares. We are a cold blooded killer who must end your life by any means necessary. You can teabag flashlight ds or anything else. But don‚Äôt complain when you get tunneled or camped or moried or anything like that. And don‚Äôt complain if we do it for no reason. Cause we‚Äôre just doing our job
---
Where‚Äôs shirtless David?
---
Well you did run everywhere, pretty much leaving a big here I am behind you especially against wraith.
---
anything to al√≠viate the grind
---
Watching good players streams or videos are a very big part of why I am where i'm at. I'd reccomend you watch Ardetha's coaching videos or Ussylis, as they are both very good players and you will learn a lot from them.
---
Your list of broken builds includes turning add on Hillbilly and Snipedoc? I'm sorry dude but you lose every last shred of credibility on that alone.
---
I hate when they make you think they'll be kind and let you escape, only to pull a switcheroo
---
People seem pretty salty about Spirit atm, but you might want to get her to the point where you can go for Adept if you don't have it.
---
Go bright or go home.
---
Oh I always fall for that when I‚Äôm playing survivor cause it‚Äôs muscle memory from playing against billy, hearing the crash sound means it‚Äôs safe to go
---
YOU DIDNT GIVE HIM A CHANCE, HUH?
---
I find that getting 1 person killed quick in the game provides SOOOO much pressure, not only that, but if you get lucky on your gen rotation, you could easily start stacking up even more pressure by that. It isn't hard to gain pressure if you get lucky. I understand that she was toxic, though it is still somewhat logical to abuse the survivor that is basically killing their own team. The point of the game is to kill people, she did just that, did she not?
---
Maybe, if I finish the pass playing naturally.
---
Blood Hunt + Happy Hour + 5 Gruesome Cake offerings + farming
---
The game isn‚Äôt canon. There‚Äôs no connection other than the characters appear in game.
---
MoM was broken, not "good".
---
Nah, once you rank up, the killers play MUCH more respectfully, since you can't really BM as killer and get very high ranks considering how much better the survivors get as you go up. Survivors are the toxic ones as you go up, trust me.
---
Julie looking mighty fine
---
Do you want to win? Legion is currently considered the worst Killer, while Spirit is considered the best after Nurse's rework.
---
üëènoüëè
---
although it was a hard nerf making it basically useless in most games, and even being able to be used multiple times (if it comes out) it will be barely used more than once since of needing 3 protection hits and in high ranks, it wouldn't be that smart to get a hit to protect your team. And after using M.O.M, if you heal your aura will be shown forever until you get downed. All they had to do was increase the number of basic attacks to 4 or 5.
---
Lol knew what I said felt wrong thanks for letting me know üëç
---
REüëèEEüëèEEüëèüëèüëèüëèEEEE
---
To try and survive? And finish the match. The match is never over until it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôve won so many games that seemed like it was a dead end, and they ended up being fun or hilarious stuff happened.  
---
The situation can be bland, or can be fun depending on how you view it.
---
awesome! i hope it turns out great! i'd love to see some pictures when its ready :)
---
This is like choosing between solid gold, and bubble gum machine gold. Go with Spirit.
---
Girls don‚Äôt play dead by daylight. At least not attractive ones. (Unless they‚Äôre streamers)
---
sauce?
---
See i don't notice killers being toxic all that much. I'm also only a 10 rank survivor, so if its lower or higher rank killers that are usually more toxic.
---
run at him and scream ''MORIE ME DADDY''
---
But it's not the skin we NEED
---
But I don‚Äôt really need prestige, because I use cosmetics for Feng min (many many different cosmetics lol) 
---
I can see why you would want to though XD
---
oh right thanks
---
That was me seeing unbreakable in the shrine of secrets, "oh shit that's right"
---
Plz nerf
---
Oh damn, I know the other survs in this lobby, I'd guess this is a spirit I know very specifically. Very nice outplay
---
Edit: OCE Gang
---
Rank 13-8 is where the chill killers who are getting bullies constantly just hang out
---
Yeah the queues for killers are awfully long for some reason, I rarely play a killer but I've been in queue (EU) for almost 10 minutes now. I don't recall this happening few months ago.
---
I don‚Äôt play killer nearly as much as survivor, so I‚Äôm generally pretty low ranked. Every game for me has at least one obvious deranged who‚Äôs tbagging and obviously trying to provoke me into chases however they can. 
---
I just ignore them. But it makes me not want to play killer enough to rank up past the troll derankers.
---
I'll definitely be buying it. Not only do I get the initial 1,000 cells back by playing a game I already play tons of, but I also get 7,000ish worth of cosmetics too? Easy choice.
---
I just cant win...
---
accurate
---
Goosebumps: Everyone Fucking Dies
---
I'm hoping the rift will motivate me to try killer more as well. Nothing like a nice bloodpoint incentive to give you that nudge.
---
yea cause saying not funny is funny hahaha
---
Hags be like.
---
I love that this is some Small Town AU where there's a sit-com/Coronation Street thing going on between trials.
---
honestly i love this its amazing to see how the killers looked like before they became a killer
---
Then learn how to play the killer. No just spam the crouch button. It‚Äôs toxic af
---
Sure bud. (Those are the only ones you can see)
---
I‚Äôm a bit confused by the wording in it though. People might interpret it differently..
---
As killer:
---
‚ÄúHits through/over pallets/vaults‚Äù or something like that: Worse or better? What exactly would ‚Äòworse‚Äô be? Fewer hits or more hits, same for better. Fewer hits might seem worse but is actually better for the game balance
---
Yea, fuck everybody that works those hours.
---
Everyone in this thread saying it would be OP forgets that all progression is halted whenever you miss a skill check. I don't know the exact numbers but I'm pretty sure it's something like 2 seconds,maybe 2.5.
---
So probably about half the speed boost would do nothing at Tier 3. But hey, 20% of nothing still feels good!
---
I didn‚Äôt realize there was so many people on here that think girls don‚Äôt play this game lol
---
I mean other then noed and the Mori its fine
---
t bag and spamming flashlights I understand but really hook blocking?
---
With an insta heal too. Nice. 
---
The trapper is really good at area denial. If you find 3 gens that are really close to eachother, and trap the windows and pallets near that area, it's really hard to get all the gens done.
---
Pro tips from a semi main trapper: 
---
-never put traps under pallets, put them on either side because when a trap is under the pallet, the survivor can just throw it down and slide over it, then you have to break it and pick it up, wasting so much time. 
---
-Also, a super good spot for traps is the corner of the killer shack outside between the window and God pallet. 
---
Like if the shack corner is represented by this L  and the top of the L is the window and the bottom right L is then pallet, put the trap at the bottom left outside corner in the grass so as they loop around it, they'll step in it. Works at high and low ranks. 
---
-put a trap in front of each exit gate some time during the game if you anticipate it getting to the end stage. That way, the survivor will have to disarm the trap before they open the gate and you get an early indicator where they're at. 
---
Best of luck!
---
Honestly, you don't need Irihead and Infantry Belt to do decent as huntress on console. You either need to learn the centre of your screen, or use a crosshair
---
They have to find her first
---
Me too, and then i get hit with tons killer daily rituals (survivor main here). :/
---
Ghostface for the aesthetic. And the fact that he‚Äôs a good killer
---
Hex Ruin and Nurses Calling. Ruin slows gen progress while Nurses revealing auras of survivors healing or being healed nearby
---
It's absolutely that. I actually think there should be a way for Killers to do the Pac-Man thing and go from one far end of the map to the other at certain points. Especially since doing it that way barely helps those with already-high mobility and has a greater impact against SWF groups.
---
Those three (and Freddy) are the top tiers purely because of that mobility. It's kind of frustrating that playing someone like Clown is just asking for punishment.
---
It's really frustrating and discombobulating for new players who get stuck with devotion 3 level 76 survs at rank 18
---
I am
---
I agree. Don‚Äôt know what his ability would be though. His trademarks are the mask and machete, and dying + resurrecting in every movie.
---
Maybe if he gets stunned enough times he ‚Äúdies‚Äù for 10 seconds, and then comes back with a permanent speed increase and temporary exposed?
---
Oh shit I actually bought water today. Thanks trapper
---
Blood points are always a good motivator
---
Once I get all the meta perks, I‚Äôm going Huntress and not looking back
---
The one with Jack Black?
---
I didn't see it. Wanted too though. Begs the question why he didn't play himself? He was in all the old movies
---
This is perfectly reasonable.
---
&gt;Ranch it up
---
I know the name sounds weird but if anyone here has never tried it you have to. It is one of the most amazing yet simple foods ever.. who would've thought a fried onion with horseradish sauce would be so heavenly..
---
They said it would be right after and that nurse was top priority
---
How *dare* you use a perk?
---
If you just want some screaming, I counteroffer letting Clown set bottles on interactables, so that Survivors knock them over when using them.
---
But a full minion char like Identity V's Dream Witch could be relaly interesting. And probably upset a lot of people, because she seemed very strong.

I've been playing for a little over a year now and it still the ih was me off but I see your point

Ash, Bill, David and Laurie would have killed everyone by this point.

Vanity Mirror sucks balls, even in tier 2 your still slow as shit. I don‚Äôt recommend it, just use scratch mirror with the brown love note, that lets you increase your lunge in tier 1 and burn either Larry‚Äôs or the game map offering...
---
In that case, I'm not sure if I should get Spirit or have faith in Doctor when I hit 9k shards.
---
I want Rancor, though. Those free mori dailies...
---
I want to see a  fic or comics about this imaginary town now
---
Came here to say this. o7
---
I actually laughed when I had a ghostface teabag me when I got put on the hook.
---
So this is what she moved to. I remember seeing Eirri's Fate:GO comics all the time
---
Love him or hate him, op spittin straight FACTS
---
Ur normal killer speed in tier 2, also in tier 3.
---
For sure
---
Er... PC master race? Obviously?
---
Let him just fling traps like in Cabin in the Woods. But I guess that's rude to Huntress, so she'll need a buff...
---

---
SWORE
---
The puke queen. Although she's not my main, puking on survivors is satisfying.
---
I also didn‚Äôt really do it for the cosmetics, I just did it so that I would have atleast one survivor maxed out
---
Same. It‚Äôs getting really annoying.
---
I don't has the money ;-;
---
I agree with you and it made most killers have to suffer because alot of them dont have insta downs heck MoM worked on myers Evil within 3 which made no sense you'd have to play billy or nurse since the blink hits didn't count to it which also made no sense or slug em which alot of these methods were horrible on both sides honestly
---
"Bullying Ugly People Simulator 2020"
---
But sometimes it is a smart decision to drop pallet earlier against huntress, clown or doc. I mean earlier in a chase of course.
---
Used to love Freddy before they updated him.
---
It‚Äôll be on Halloween sale I‚Äôm sure
---
That sounds amazing
---
I fully support that idea
---
PWYF Bubba op pls nerf
---
Its not even close with most of them. I can see Myers, Freddy, and maybe Spirit having an advantage, but there is no way any of The Legion members could even get close to killing these 4.
---
I has only $6 ;~;
---
Is this r/HydroHomies ?
---
Yeah, fair play
---
I already max prestiged many Characters on PS4 version so I‚Äôm kinda burned out of doing it over again lol
---
Relevant DBD content if I used the DBD render as reference?
---
I haven‚Äôt got him, I‚Äôve been thinking about it though! Seems the general consensus was he got better after the update though, what changed?
---
I don't see Plague at all
---
Yeah I knew the spirit and survivors too. OCE server is pretty small I always run into the same people. Before this, the killer was pretty respectful and I enjoyed playing against them.
---
Raid Behavior Studios for happy hour
---
Mostly kidding :)
---
Hot
---
In what way was any of that toxic
---
Give a BP bonus for leaving a hook after hooking, but that will only do anything if the BP caps go up.
---
However, Killers determined to get a kill or out to spite someone won't be dissuaded.
---
True ash and bill
---
Yup
---
F
---
Trash player
---
as a nurse main i can confirm
---
People have jobs!! Hahaha maybe like first 5 games you get bonus BP or something that can include everyone.
---
Doctor with range add-on and iridescent king combined with a big terror radius
---
(X) Doubt
---
Yes it‚Äôs less ridiculous now, but it still screws over killers like Trapper still. People who run it want to get looped most times anyways.
---
Uh except killer crutch perks affects everyone though.
---
It used to be Freddy back when he was still bad because I love Nightmare on Elm Street, but then Ghostface was released and I play him now because I love Scream more. But I might try Freddy again eventually.
---
Fran, sis.
---
Maybe a 2v6 mode, although it would seem a bit killer sided, but 2 v 8 seems crazy
---
Legion would get absolutely destroyed. Even if they all attacked at the same time they'd get completely fucked. Myers MIGHT be able to kill them but if there's more than 1 of our hero crew attacking Myers hed go down i think. I think they'd have a field day with Freddy, Bill has had his face clawed off, Laurie has been stabbed multiple times by Myers, and Ash is stupid and Lucky.
---
i remember when i gave a demogorgon head and he let me live :,) so romantic
---
Yeah dude that what I was running till people started talking about prayer beads
---
Ruin, A Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher, and BBQ. That's the penultimate spirit build you're already using one of the stronger addon pairs.
---
Sloppy increases the healing time detrimentally, and nurse's is one if spirits absolute best perks. At its highest level, with her already small terror radius, you'll see people healing prior to them hearing your terror radius. This allows for effective takedowns. Sloppy gives you higher chances to see it as they take longer to heal.
---
Easily clown for me, the other ones dont look too good. Aside from the Spirit's katana, that one is amazing.
---
I hate that as well. Nerfing something that is already very seldom used. Now it‚Äôll never be used.
---
I went from rank 14 to rank 4 during the past two Sundays playing every killer (excluding Nurse/Spirit/Billy/Clown).  Once I hit rank 8 half my lobbies were Red Rank players including full red rank squads.  I 4 K'd a red rank squad using one tier 1 perk, no add-on lvl 1 Hag fairly easily.  Most games I really just focused on my 8 hooks and let people go.
---
There's a huge gap between **good** red rank survivors and everyone else.  Green is slightly better than white.  Purple is slightly better than Green.  Most red are basically purple...then there are absolute monster loopers who change the game given the right map layout and teammates aggressively working gens.
---
Otz is probably the best Killer (who streams, at least), but I haven't watched enough people to know the best Survivor.
---
Its an exaggeration, yeah. I don't think it'll fall to oblivion, but it just lost a little bit of the "anti-stealth" mechanic
---
We really should have this. A few years back, when i was playing Marvel Heroes there were many Events but there was a steady thing called Monday Madness  which included a much better Loot than usual etc. 
---
Double BP events are not frequent enough and the Grind is still very high even with the new Bloodweb. I wish the amount of BP would be bigger and the Cap would be 2M so we can Level up to max level with a gathered amount. **A Double BP Day** or even **4 hour(or better the first 3 Games for Surv and Killer at some days)**would be great. 
---
As i said before, I really wish they would do something about Devotion too. I am Level 5 and have nothing to gain from it than just a small counter. The Shards are an even bigger grind so it would be good if Devotion awarded you a Bonus for each level.
---
For instance:
---
**When you get a Devotion Level gain 500-1000 Shards + 500K-1M BP. (You may think the amounts are big but they are not, a Level 100 could take from weeks to months)**
---
OR
---
**Get an increasing Bonus based on your Devotion Level. Meaning**
---
**Devotion 1: 10 Shards and 50k BP per level(or 5 or 10 levels for balance)**
---
**Devotion 2: 20 Shards and 100k BP per level(or 5 or 10 levels for balance)**
---
and so on.

I love how territorial the Hag is. Playing her feels like playing as an old lady chasing a bunch of unruly kids off her lawn. I'm not going to chase you all over the neighborhood but goddamn if you come back into my nest again I'm going to gut you!
---
Absolutely.  I'm glad to support the devs and hope the game is supported for years to come.
---
Let the witch hunt begin
---
Yes.
---
Save up some green moris. You'll have to catch the offender one more time, but the kill will be both more efficient and more satisfying.
---
Not on PS4, it states that but in reality your slower and get your ass run! I‚Äôve used vanity mirror a few times and it ended horribly and I know my Myers inside and out and BK Myers is better than vanity mirror!!
---
Hello spine chill
---
Is that for both first killer and first survivor games per day?
---
Accurate.  You can literally loop killers around a single tree and eventually confuse them and they will think you left.
---
look, look at you bold points lol üòÜ. It would most likely be full, but it's barely past half.
---
Hey, they buffed Left Behind! Anything is possible. Perks like Slippery Meat and those random, non-character perks mostly need buffs.
---
However, Spine Chill is still my favorite.
---
Killer player victim complex
---
Plague and clown both for same reason no good skins for both I think plague has no skins period and clown has eh okay skins the only one I think is better is either carnie claws which wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of that one and the entertainer which I hate the mask on it so these are good skins I think
---
Yeah I‚Äôll be trying the nurses/sloppy combo today! I can see how it would be super strong.
---
Dang, I feel betrayed.
---
I let em rip across map.  You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
---
Stfu dude Spine Chill is my bae /s
---
Seriously I love it.
---
Damn, how much salt did you get?
---
Have it start every 25 hours instead of 24 so that it cycle's through all timezones evenly and still has the same effect of drawing people online instead of just for the first game or two every day
---
If you want to talk effective perks, Legion also has several perks that synergize well with their Frenzy that you could take advantage of, especially keeping in mind that higher ranked survivors usually forego healing. Using the best stuff on a killer obviously makes them able to compete with better survivors, doesn't excuse how lackluster they are compared to others. M&amp;A and STBFL work wonders on Legion for easily downing injured survivors clumped together.
---
Also to keep things clear, I believe all these killers we're discussing right now rightfully belong in low tier, even Legion who I am defending. My main argument is discussing how Legion definitely isn't the worst killer in the game, as they DO have more going for them even if it isn't much.
---
I like object, I'm running it right now but I guess it's back to borrowed time.
---
I'd still fuck them
---
No it's not that it's like with base killers who barely have a power that can get better with powers like trapper o use the base build and I use special killer specific builds like doctor stuff I just use it if I can't think of anything but wanna play that killer
---
"Here's an offering that costs you BP and does nothing."
---
Yep, sounds balanced.
---
I also had the sabotage daily turn into another daily. I wonder if that one in particular is bugged?
---
Imagine a 2v8 mode in dead by daylight
---
I was running around the same tires+gen with a skinned Huntress, they took forever to catch me lol
---
It‚Äôs so weird to me that there are huge amounts of people who only play one side. It‚Äôs one thing to have a preference, it‚Äôs another entirely to either never or almost never play the other side.
---
BHVR's ideal skill ceiling cricks your neck.
---
I think that was my case, they had a very capable runner / looper while the rest played stealthy and objective focused. A combo like that is sure to have success.
---
The skill curve in this game for survs comes down to how fewer and fewer mistakes you can make. But in my games it‚Äôs either a lobby full of potatoes or lobby full of gods.
---
Killer queues take insanely long. Its just how it is. If you play survivor you‚Äôll find games much quicker. If you really wanna be killer you‚Äôll just have to be patient
---
You're talking to one
---
I'm new to killer rank 15 and takes me forever, gonna just keep playing survivor until rank reset.
---
NOED is just a cheap trick to make weak killers stronger!
---
One Instaheal isn‚Äôt dead (unfortunately) and Nurse is ABSOLUTELY not dead.
---
Do you mean to say that basic looping shouldn't be 100% invincibility against every single Killer?
---
HERESY.
---
BT is a solid perk, but I was kinda hoping the new Babysitter (its from the new DLC, I forgot the name) perk would be more competitive with it.
---
BT remains best unhooking perk. IMO.
---
Ok, just really want to try out Demogorgon. I bought the chapter and haven‚Äôt been able to find a game to try it in yet
---
Well then, didnt think that was an actual thing
---
Oh no.. t-bagging! It‚Äôs LITERALLY THE MIDDLE FINGER ONLINE! A survivor pressed the crouch button repeatedly and when I saw I literally pissed on myself. I had to tunnel and camp him all game then, just to teach him a lesson on t-bagging!! What do you mean I‚Äôm over reacting?? He t-bagged!! The ultimate cardinal gaming sin!!!!!!!!
---
I thought he was fast as fuck, though.
---
Infinite loading screen again? That‚Äôs reality when you get past 30 years old... 
---
‚ÄúSpoiler Alert‚Äù
---
But then if you're unlucky, your first 2 games are worth 15k total after the bonus. I wouldn't wanna play anymore for the day after that.
---
Spirit‚Äôs skin is probably the coolest, but Plague would beat her if she threw up the golden stuff
---
Just turned 32, feels like an eternal 3 person lobby.
---
I wish they had something like a sandbox mode where you could just play around with a character, Killer or Survivor, against AI opponents to just get a feel for their abilities. I‚Äôm good with the Wraith and used to be ok with Freddy before his redo. It took a while to get the hang of their abilities, especially when different games had the survivors playing differently.
---
I don't get that many. Mainly because I don't buy them. I've seen people with dozens if not hundreds across all their characters. Went against a hillbilly last night who had around 70. I personally don't have a problem with overpowered builds. I just hate playing solo queue and having a team that gets wiped instantly despite me being able to outplay the Killer. I also don't like playing killer and going against survivors who use a key every match because of the ward.
---
It just works. The server is the killer but thery are trying to put dedicated servers into the game.
---
I think they tried like 4 or 5 times, none of these were good.
---
Pipping has been super easy on PS4 I was a rank 2 within the first week after the reset and that was from a 13... i barely do anything in some games and still manage to pip, beats me, you practically have to be afk to not safety pip as a survivor or Ive just gotten better at the game and don‚Äôt realize it...
---
That's fair. This post is just to see what other people think of them. Thanks for the comment
---
That spitirt straight up got cucked.
---
Sorta. He can eat anything (thus ‚Äúdevourer of worlds‚Äù) but prefers meat that‚Äôs been seasoned with fear. The movie‚Äôs ending wasn‚Äôt very accurate to the books. That being said, I‚Äôm pretty sure the devs could cool up some lore for him, pretty easily in fact
---
Yes but the higher rank I am the more I need to. Both sides have this problem it's not just killer
---
Some of this makes sense. To me though you don't always die. You can escape and "win" and in doing so you don't have to be a toxic jerk about it. Like Kevin from The Office says "Let's get our hardware and go home." To me that's not teabagging at the exit gate or flicking your flash light off and on. Finish you gens, open the gate, and walk out.
---
As far as setting up games I'm usually in a survivor game within 2 or 3 minutes at most. With killer I'm sometimes waiting 10-15 minutes just to find a match where there is probably over a 50% shot that at least one survivor will be toxic or even DC just because they get downed. I actually stream on Twitch and will either just not play killer when streaming or I'll play a mini game in between because I have to wait that long.
---
So as a killer waiting 15 minutes for a match just to show up to a survivor deciding to not treat me like a human because they're upset I am trying to kill them as THE KILLER is kinda dumb.
---
Looks like she *made her choice*
---
Oh yeah. And a lot of the time when I play killer and I see a white Ward... I'm expecting a brand new part commodious toolbox or a key. Although the killer black ward has the power of creating a lot of disconnects from what I can see XD
---
I mean against good survs, all the gens will be done around the same time you get that kill.
---
3 uncontested people on gens doesn't take long and you don't have many dying light/thantaphobia stacks if you tunnel, so if ruin got cleansed early, you're fucked.
---
&gt; I understand that she was toxic, though it is still somewhat logical to abuse the survivor that is basically killing their own team. 
---
I mean if you literally only care for winning and have no sportsmanship/don't care about fun, sure go ahead. Ignore the kate and tunnel everyone off hook.
---
&gt;The point of the game is to kill people, she did just that, did she not?
---
Sure and the point of the game for survs is to escape but all 4 survs sitting in random corners of the map, only moving to not get birds and waiting for the hatch is theoretically just playing their objective but I'm sure you would not be okay with that?
---
It's logical if they all have the new hatch perk after all.
---
Myers sure looks fun. I like the Trapper most of the ones I have, though, because you get to feel big brained when the traps work out.
---
He has a different name in like each movie but bubba's just fan favorite and it rolls of the tongue
---
You have some valid points I didn't consider or cover in my video. In the end it doesn't matter because even if my video letter reaches the devs, nothing will change.
---
My main goal with this video was to be able to make a last ditch effort and express my frustrations and suggestions. This way, if and most likely when I do give up on DbD I can say that I addressed the devs directly with my concerns and they did nothing.
---
Having people agree or disagree and have a conversation about the topic is a bonus that helps bring more attention to the issues instead of just ignoring them.
---
In the end, I accomplished what I set out to do :)
---
I'm actually pretty meh about most of them, but Clown's face -just the face- seems like a gift that keeps on giving.
---
Do you play a lot? Then sure go for it. Gives you something to work for, and BP loss isnt really a big deal. 
---
If you're casual and this is side game for you, then probably dont bother.
---
Hand
---
Just noed and the mori suck. Ruin is annoying but just do skill checks it's not that hard and the other two arent horrible either chill.
---
Left-hand.
---
Spirit because I can drift through the spirit realm, listening for the crack of a totem or footsteps running down the hallway. I get to leave my husk at odd places and pretend to be still and uncanny
---
Finally, the pig buff we‚Äôve been looking for.
---
yeah, but didn't we get the Hillbilly, The Nightmare and The Pig all in a row?
---
Then again, a large number of players log on to do their 1 survivor and 1 killer game then are done for the day anyways, so it works out
---
I didn't say it was a negative thing, just that there was a clear reason for his high win-rate (which makes OP's shitpost rather inaccurate).
---
How do you make pics into backgrounds.
---
Yes, we rise up a hill to throw the hatchets down at the survivors on the ground!
---
Hey, it assist survivors who miss the skill-check trying to get past Ruin ffs
---
I had a strong bruh moment from The plague forward.
---
Personally I think Ward's should be removed from the game. In my opinion they're the worst thing that has ever been implemented in the history of dead by daylight. Counting all of the ultra-rare add-ons and toxicity that comes from both sides. They ruin the whole point of rare items when I've seen players with dozens of them on all their characters.
---
Although I agree with what you said. I think every offering besides party streamers/Gateau or map offerings should be hidden. Mist/BP/luck/Etc should all be hidden along with Mori and any future offerings. But map offerings and bloody party streamers should definitely stay visible.
---
I‚Äôve only prestige‚Äôs one character in all my dbd time (Nancy) just because I‚Äôve never done it. It‚Äôs says better bloodwebs but I honestly see no difference. Other then the bloody cosmetics there really is no point
---
 I was just throwing ideas out there off the top of my head. They could do other things to give the killer more of an edge. The sabo one could work, assuming it's a fast regression, much faster than a kick, maybe as a side bonus when you switch back, it'll allow faster regression when you do hit a gen. Bond could work if you wanna give it increased values, if you really find it that weak. I really don't think this killer would be as weak as you think, midtier probably, probably better than the lower tier killers we have now even.
---
I was thinking the exact same thing earlier. If youre high ranks or even mid ranks, you‚Äôre not really gonna want to learn a whole new killer at the risk of de-pipping and losing out on bloodpoints
---
Green mori would still be too strong
---
The ability to completely eliminate a survivor from the game with 5 gens left after they've only been hooked once is a **major** game changer. It completely tilts the balance into the killers favor, all because the killer simply equipped an offering.
---
It doesn‚Äôt make the post inaccurate really, the post just says he wins every game. It doesn‚Äôt say he wins every game at red ranks.
---
Thank god for this comment, pleasantly surprised it didn't get downvoted straight to hell
---
This would suck unless they had different servers and timezones, i wouldnt play at 3am for double bp
---
And this boys is why we move up in ranks!
---
To avoid babies like this who tunnel and rely on noed. Taking shortcuts without bothering to learn the game. He knows he loses by doing so, looks bad while doing so and does it anyway
---
Damn, I would‚Äôve given you the hatch and asked for ice cream
---
*Laughs in franklin‚Äôs demise*
---
And Pig. And Clown. And Huntress. And (very debatable) Myers. All just human with no supernatural aspect.
---
whenever he hits you his laugh echoes through the map
---
*sins of the father starts playing*
---
It won‚Äôt. I recommend you get Bubba. His 3 teachables are worth the money, and can save your ass depending on the situation.
---
Right? Win or lose just say gg. Not ‚Äútrash killer/survivors‚Äù just because you lost.
---
i was thinking on it
---
Shit‚Äôs like watching a soap opera.
---
I mean you can farm items with white wards what's not to like
---
Lol
---
When you have franklin's and hit the guy running an insta-heal.
---
Na u dont sound like a hero it's hard to not fill your boldness meter up cause I love going on totems every match and get chased decently long. I was just fucking around. I feel like survival is hardest to fill.
---
He did show up. He played Jack Black in the movie, or ‚ÄúMr. Black‚Äù, while the actual Jack Black played R.L. Stein. It‚Äôs a very small cameo appearance after the resolution of the story.
---
Also, he probably didn‚Äôt play himself in the movie because he‚Äôs getting old and rusty when it comes to acting.
---
im pretty sure you can't even hit people on hook anymore. every time i've seen a killer try to do it lately they just hit the hook and it makes the ting noise.
---
Even if you‚Äôre not high ranked, learning the very basics of a Killer could make actually playing more fun since you don‚Äôt struggle to figure out what everything does. I sucker with Freddy at first, didn‚Äôt actually understand how his dream pull ability worked, thought I had to constantly stay on the survivor while using it for it to work, had no idea how his perks worked. I managed to figure out the basics at least to not be useless, still wasn‚Äôt really good with him. Sucked because I‚Äôm a huge Robert Englund Elm Street fan. Wish they had used his Freddy and not the remakes
---
CAN. Don't, because it's not really about the Killer in a PvP game where the advantage is on the Survivors' side.
---
Killer mains have to put up with surv rule bs
---
I bet Ghostface would be a cool guy at parties.
---
Or just dont fucking hide in lockers to block the aura at all. If the killer doesnt see anyone he'll assume they are close by and wont leave the hook area. Then your team mate is losing hook time and no gens are being done. Sit your ass down on a gen and *make* the killer pressure you off. Stop being such pussies.
---
Dedicated servers have been live on PC for the last day and a half. It wasn't p2p
---
Oh boy I wouldn‚Äôt want to be them, that‚Äôd be ego shattering

Auto correct amirite
---
As much as I want more moris, never on the first down. The best thing for these people is to be matchmade with one another so the whole lobby clears out after one hook.
---
It wasn‚Äôt good, it was broken af. Giving you a second chance for doing literally nothing.
---
Game was balanced around this posibility once, but now that insta heals got nerfed, flashlights got nerfed, BNPs got nerfed most powerful perks got nerfed, exhaustion got nerfed and pallets were changed I can see your point. Still, moris are supposed to be powerful, this is not a competitive game, offerings and/or add-ons like these spice up the gameplay, you won't always have a fair chance to win, sometimes you'll do everything right and still lose. Making moris usable after the second hook removes pretty much all their value, they become barely a time saver for not having to drag the survivor to the hook one last time.
---
My green mori proposal is strong, yes, but the original is completely useless. I think the fact that its now higher rarity, only comes into play after the game is pretty much done, takes an offering slot and  still requieres the survivor to be hooked once is pretty fair
---
Had a guy message me on 5 different Xbox accounts with enough salt for a Big Mac
---
Uh, never, because Rank 15s still have a rough time with Ruin.
---
Yeah the meta is *crazy* different between platforms it seems. On Xbox it's mainly stealth killers. I've seen more Myers, GF, and Pig than anyone
---
That's neat. Glad old mr stine is still kicking. Does he still write goosebumps?

That's a fair opinion. And white Wards aren't typically as powerful as black wards. Survivors don't have as powerful of add-ons or items and they can be countered entirely by Franklin's demise.
---
I still think Ward's don't have a place in the game. Most items are already incredibly easy to farm or come across. The ward just encourages no risk on supposedly very powerful builds. I think they should be removed entirely and all offerings besides bloody party streamers or map offerings should be hidden
---
oink
---
Who is Mrs Ghosty anyway? Never heard of her and I‚Äôm always looking through DBD twitch? She must have like 6 viewers or something.
---
Because Nurse getting nerfed means Spirit is 90% of high rank matches now, and people don't like losing. Or having any challenge, apparently.
---
As a Ghostface main and occasional Myers, this makes me happy.
---
*laughter* ‚Äûyou dumb bitch.‚Äú
---
Yeah but the game is balanced against the four to have a hard time winning.
---
He is a Scottish Myers kilt and all
---
REEEE
---
I normally set it so people can't message me when I play dbd so I don't have to deal with salt.
---
Well I'd have some watered down *bloody* marys!
---
Not sure. Maybe?
---
It's 3 a.m. once a day where I live.
---
nah it was sarcasm, i play more survivor but im rank 1 on both, i def get more toxic behavior from killers even though i dont tbag or do anything toxic.
---
When i do run into a toxic swf or somthing as killer i normally get an easy 3k or so
---
Correct
---
I didn‚Äôt like the original elm street movies. I know thats a bit of a hot take, but they were never my thing. I love old slashers. Halloween, scream, friday the 13th, and the shining are some of my favorites. Elm street just didnt do it for me. For the game, ive only played as freddy once, and it was before the rework. I actually didnt hate him, but as a myers main I‚Äôll definitely stick with him over fred
---
did a leatherface just call someone kid... gross...
---
Totally. I‚Äôm playing on the Switch so it takes a lot longer for both queues. Just loading the match after getting a game is like 4 minutes, hah. 
---
If queues were faster and the ability to be as toxic was removed, it wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äústing‚Äù as much to lose as either. That‚Äôs all I was suggesting with that comparison. It sucks that your queues are so long just to get trolled. That isn‚Äôt fun, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that.
---
Yea, good idea but probably too situational. Then again BHVR added lots of situational items.
---
Legion, hands down. Even though everyone hates them for being "edgelords". Lol I love being able to sprint and fast vault. Usually in any game I play I like playing a character with emphasis on agility.
---
Honestly would be great if they made Auric cosmetics available in Shards for a limited time but ok
---
32k you mean? Lol congrats thats hard af
---
What does afk mean?
---
That's a really low bar, but the sabo might be better as an Overcharge that doesn't suck. An actually difficult skillcheck on gens to not be injured by them.
---
Bond would have to linger for a while after returning to Killer speed. Having a free I'm All Ears like that could make something solid, but none of these really do anything for the gimmick of pretending to be a Survivor. There's no way to not instantly be found out, making the disguise form a liability.
---
Shocked that Joey is black
---
Help me delete the thots mike
---
it's been pretty popular/productive on demogorgon, not all perks need to work with all killers/survivors. also, remember this post's TED talk of the day "one change at a time"
---
Sounds like Titanfall 2‚Äôs Clan Happy Hours. Neat!
---
Pretty much every game I play on a team against another person or people it‚Äôs my teammates who annoy me,  not the other side.
---
Legit just had a Huntress with Mori camp the hooks and slug. Like, what even is the point..?
---
Well I just put 4K describing the amount of kills but 32k works also. Thank you man.
---
Oh dang that's a lot of loading I'm sure. As much as I love my Switch it doesn't feel like a platform I want to play DbD on. I've always played on PC and it feels like the killer que just gets worse and worse somehow. Hopefully both will get better for us with dedicated servers or just over time!
---
Thanks, only now noticed how parched I am.
---
Just like Titan Fall 2 I like it
---
Theres not so much difference when the killer DOSENT use black ward but still uses funky addons and when they do in fact use ward imo
---
Ohhhh thats what you meant. I thought you already got a lot of 4k games. My bad
---
I really don't know but it's still unacceptable I think
---
I usually do get many 4K games, but I just wanted to have little confusion. It‚Äôs all good.
---
They shouldnt be removed just made more rare on bloodwebs. Same with ultra rares. Make them as rare as party streamers. I get more tombstones and ebonys than streamers
---
Ya got me there
---
Wait are there rumors of 2v8?
---
Imagine if she had bloodwarden. Then your fucked
---
It can't be unfair just because it's harder for the killer. They made perks to counteract it. Like the one that reveals multiple people on the generator or people healing. Those are made to counteract people working together.
---
hahahaha just close it after you hook them you fucking pancake brain.
---
Always miss 100 in *one* category and become unable to get the perfect game
---
Console, i was saying fix their dedicated servers so we can get them as well
---
A wild regular show.
---
That has happened way too many times before, but I finally got a perfect score.
---
It‚Äôs a matter of opinion is all. I‚Äôve known people who practically worshipped Jason but hated Freddy, some believed that the only actually good slashers were the ones that didn‚Äôt get recognised (snobs), I prefer Freddy and am not the biggest fan of Halloween. The world would be boring if everyone liked the same stuff
---
Who the hell plays sniper doc on a SWF lmao. I‚Äôm devotion 4 and have yet to ever encounter one.
---
The killer actually gets the achievement too. Probably an unintentional bug.
---
Hatch is fine.
---
Nah Myers is pretty much just evil in the shape of a human, that's why he can't die
---
Sometimes I close hatch and let them open a gate. But I usually let the last survivor leave when I'm nice
---
With a knife and fork!
---
But again it works better against solo players than SWF.  If your a team and you notice the killer drops what they are doing and comes to the gen with 2+ people on it then you know and can communicate that to your team and work around it or use it as a way to distract the killer.  Much much more powerful and more counterplay  than against solo survivors.  
---
It‚Äôs strong to be able to talk, end of story.
---
Ya bc we need a perk that supports gen rushing with swf and prove thy self
---
Chill dude, it's a meme
---
Yeah, goth...
---
Shame on them, I would have given you the hatch!
---
This is something Steve would do though, once the bad person turns their head he just sprints opens the hatch and escapes.
---
I usually would side with this but he's in Australia so the queues take forever and it's the same people and by that I mean the same 4 people its alot worse over there the other option is playing against Korea or Japan so no dice there I mean he would love to play in the UK or states because he'd have no problem playing red ranks constantly since wait times are way more bearable shit I've seen sit for more than an hour to get a game but he doesn't want to play purple over red I think he knows his skill is alot better then that but queues are horrible so I give it a pass but if goes somewhere else and still does this I'll reconsider
---
Hence the saw and blindfold.
---
(I'm not the author of the image)
---
"What's your favorite scary movie?" He asks, holding up a handful of DvDs
---
True true. I loved the original halloween and the 2018 one. All the ones in between were ass. Ive never seen the newest nightmare on elm street, but ive heard bad things
---
With stridor waiting a sec and letting them heal will help thats why you need nurses too
---
Effing QUAD BP during Happy Hour on a Bloodhunt
---
what? Lose real money bc you dc?
---
It sucked. Robert Englund had this sort of Charisma and spark to him that really drew you in. The new guy was just bland and depressing
---
Why just do a "first win of the game bonus" where your first Escape or 2+ sacrifice game is worth double BP?
---
Gotta love that we can, you can't, mentality
---
What do you think of the freddy rework in game? Is he worth buying?
---
Away from keyboard
---
Getting better is unlimited:)
---
I got an achievement for maxing out a category so maybe it did count? I did escape with the map. Not sure if the killer had that perk
---
I bought school girl spirit ya know why üòâ
---
Proud of you, wait for the time you get a juicy maxed game with 32000 bloodpoints, thats almost orgasmic.
---
Yeah. I'm fine with stuff like sniper doctor or Turner hillbilly. It just makes me so frustrated when my teammates drop like flies against it and hand a killer that might not even be that good an easy win. It's ridiculous that people can stockpile essentially infinite Tombstone Evil Within 3 Michael Myers or iridescent head infantry belt Huntress.
---
Honestly I just feel kind of guilty using that stuff as killer. I feel like I'm good without basically cheating but I can understand the appeal. Especially on bad Killers like Leatherface or doctor and Wraith
---
U/vredditdownloader
---
No, it‚Äôs that at different times, it‚Äôs harder to find some. Killers are backed up because a lot are killers, and not enough survivors to compensate
---
Man I hate those edgelords but this made me feel bad for him
---
If you got the achievement and most likely the bloodpoints.  You either got hit with Franklin's or used it up.
---
My favorite is running insidious on Leatherface and using it to sit behind the counter on Gas Heaven.
---
Roleplay as a cashier.
---
Same here, I don‚Äôt do jack shit and pip
---
Zubat plays both but I think most of us will kinda agree on survivor being the easier of the two killer has to put thought into every decision every chase rotation etc and if you make 1 mistake you will lose unless we're playing the best killers goose doesn't play survivor like that but because he plays killer so much he can get by where as zubat can do both very well we won't know unless goose plays in the uk or the states if he's as good as zubat in the killer department but this is just my opinion so take it as you will
---
Honestly that's how it feels. I see a black Ward one out of every two matches. Usually meaning iridescent heads or infinite Evil Within 3 and tombstone. Sometimes I'm lucky and only have to deal with scratched mirror or Amanda's letter.
---
Party streamer should be much more common than ultra-rare add-ons or black Wards and white wards.
---
greedy spirit should have played any other killer instead of greedy spirit

I'm only working on Prestiging Michael Myers and Leatherface (maybe Freddy one day) for the cosmetics.  They look great on the licensed Killers, esp the ones without any cosmetic options available.  Also to get the 4 Trophies/Achievements tied towards Prestiging all the way through and then Prestige 3 lvl 50. 
---
If you don't like or want the cosmetics, nor care for the Trophies/Achievements.....then no, not worth it.  Its a pretty big time &amp; Bloodpoint sink
---
Beam brightness by 50%
---
Blindness 25%
---
Increased Consumption 12%
---
Btw just ignore that guy he‚Äôs just being a total asshat for no reason
---
Huh, you learn something new everyday.
---
I like it simply because it makes sense. Their outfits totally are something delinquent teenagers would wear thinking they looked good.
---
I mean, I guess. Doesn't she carry an incense burner though?
---
Yeah. That's a fair point. When I use those overpowered builds or add-ons I usually don't use a word. I would feel guilty and I like risking my powerful stuff. I don't like basically cheating the system because Wards are more common than party streamers.
---
It's got to be somewhat boring using the same build everyday constantly because you stockpiled hundreds of black Wards or white wards
---
Looks dope!
---
Honestly tho
---
Also, trapper should have all his traps at the start of a trial, and his bag addons let him spawn with more traps.
---
I mean just because both are clowns doesn‚Äôt mean that both are gonna be the same, one is a shapeshifting cosmic entity while the other is Pennywise
---
Either ghost face (he gets boring and easy after a while so red cosmetics) or speedy legion boi
---
I hate that Ace isn't top tier, but I otherwise agree.
---
I'm not denying this guy was an asshole and doing it for different reasons, but you do get more points if you hook after end game starts
---
SHHHHH
---
Personally I don't try to tunnel but if I run back to the hook and see two people their I'm going for the easier down be that the unhook who can't loop or the rescuer who is injured and can't loop
---
seems legit

It won‚Äôt last that long. But at your age you should invest in as much rest and time with studies as possible. Knowledge is power. Keep in mind you have your whole life for video games but with the state of development your brain is in, you are in your prime for learning new things at its most efficient pace. As you get older learning and remembering will only be more difficult. Take advantage of what you‚Äôve got now and burn your time on dumb video games later!
---
It was **made for** people who play a shit-ton!
---
Theyre releasing an update soon where the highest rank survivor is the killer matched to
---
Fungoose
---
happy cake day!
---
The easiest thing for me to do is close the hatch after the last is hooked
---
Also with the decayed Myers mask cosmetic
---
I dont go against many people who throw a ward.  But they are more common then streamers which is pretty dumb. People wouldnt complain about so many spirits with prayer beads id they werent so common on the web
---
And then he‚Äôd die when survivors tbag
---
That would be great because the way it is now is absolutely ridiculous.  
---
Unsuspecting Low-Rank Killers get matches about absolute units of Green &amp; Purple SWFs who decided to bring a Yellow for the lulz. To be fully honest i don't even understand how i was matched with a SWF like this on my current Rank. I'm like a baby killer lol.
---
I play occasionally, mostly for Daily Rituals and during events...but eventually I intend to practice and play her more.  
---
Gotta love being efficient with quick Hatchet downs, getting 3 Kills (one DCing before 2nd Hook), with Gens only partially worked in a game, last Survivor gets Hatch and the game goes "nah, Safety pip!"  I swear I can't win xD I'm either good /great at Hatchet plays.....and I safety pip...or I end up ass with em and mostly basic attacks and get a longer game with better pips xD
---
Its been known for a couple of months. I think its getting released when dedicated servers are released. I think they were also talking about heftier punishments for leaving matches too
---
Honestly ngl legion is good if you play him right. Otherwise you‚Äôre horrible
---
It looks like it's bugged showing your progress towards your first prestige, not actually saying you have something prestiged at the moment. It isn't showing up in the Prestige I, II, or III achievements because those only calculate the times you've prestiged a character, whereas the III-50 is showing the extra levels you put in AFTER prestiging.
---
The eyes on Dwight tho I hate them
---
Well, his name is Kyle so its expected, sorry other Kyles
---
But we just had Clown, Spirit, Legion, and Plague before Ghostface, so they‚Äôre most likely gonna go with another licensed character
---
Im 36 and I swear I just packed up all My Xmas stuff and now fixing to pull it all back out... this year has really gone by fast and I swear time has sped up, heard allot of peopling saying the same thing and way younger than me... 
---
I still remember hatch stand offs and toxic DS on first grabs because killer didn‚Äôt dribble... it was all just yesterday to me.
---
ok thank you
---
Ghost face and pig. Ghosty boy exposes them and pig ambushes from an unexpected angle. I totally don‚Äôt have a bias because of my mains. My flair means nothing
---
Because Console Huntress &amp; Console Nurse aren't as efficient as they are on PC mah dude...the consoles actively make it more difficult to land or pull off tricky shots/hits which equates to Survivors powering through and trolling the Huntress/Nurse players.....
---
It‚Äôs an awesome show, I think it‚Äôs one of those shows you either love or hate. Mostly love. Take your time watching it, or can sometimes get a bit intense and you need to take a break
---
Same as PS4 with in game psn messaging, you can get them on that, but I don‚Äôt think BhVR can suspend or ban people unless it‚Äôs really bad, Sony holds their nuts in a jar from what I‚Äôve heard.
---
I really wish they would start cracking down and cleaning house within their game and actively put company paid mods in the game to enforce the rules across all platforms. 
---
Hell even if you have just a few and they hand out suspensions on people and let them know that mods are floating around, you would see less people being toxic and breaking the rules. 
---
DBD is like entering The Wild West every time I hit the button to find a lobby...
---
Not a perk or addon causing it. I just played a game and there's also the "you are being chased by the killer" music even when you aren't near them
---
Y‚Äôall on PC or console with this issue? I‚Äôm on PS4 if it makes any difference.
---
removed we ask you take part of this sub before posting videos thank you
---
I could just see that.  Drop them and be like "wait, where did they go?  Oh...  Ohh....."
---
Hasn‚Äôt happened to me...
---
Probably sucks to always be looking over your shoulder
---
lol still strongest killer in the game.
---
Dbd on mobile is just fucking stupid if something doesn't go their way they can just click the home button and close app and reopen to find another match
---
Lmao just had a ghost face camp me Bc I looped him for 1 minute
---
Whack Ah Mole time!
---
David and Jake at the two top tiers? Have my upvote!
---
Don't do it.  It'll cost you like 8 million bloodpoints to P3 50 one character.  You'll still need to unlock most of the perks for that one character after hitting P3 50. 
---
The smart play is to keep everyone at 50 and unlock all the perks.  It'd probably take over a thousand hours to do that..and by then there will be dozens of new characters to level and then unlock their teachables on the old characters.
---
Bloody cosmetics are blah at this point.  They use to be cool back when we had zero cosmetics.  Now we have a whole store, a new battle pass and more on the way.
---
I always do it with the last survivor. My stupid rule, if you have adrenaline I let you live, if you don't, you die. You have to entertain yourself somehow and have some thrill.
---
It's crazy! You know you are safe but the music is going and the heart beat is pumping so you don't know if the killer is actually coming
---
Wo
---
I think it's more of filling a white paper with dark shading
---
The meme was kinda killer sided. The first meme with both girls did it better. But still worth a shot
---
In what universe?
---
She's completely dogshit
---
Absolutely, I defo get murdered cause of scoops steve. I even took the hat off so i wouldnt be such a beacon lol
---
This is a video that just keeps on giving.
---
Glad to see the mobile version is just like the rest of the platforms and let me guess BhVR will still not do anything to crack down on this bs behavior...
---
Jake, Spirit, Hag
---
Clearly you havent played her. Shes still the strongest killer in the game. Now she cant insta 4k every game.

Get gud

Would encourage me to not continue my suffering after the first match which is nice
---
The strongest killers are like Myers and Billy.
---
  
---
Never has a Nurse gotten more than one kill on console.
---
Pig's been nerfed but she's still good. Clown just sucks
---
We were ‚Äúyears from the end‚Äù 40 years ago. They just keep repeating themselves. These ‚Äúactivists‚Äù are just ‚Äúthe end is nigh‚Äù hobos who became politicians.
---
Nice work! Just in time for Spooktober, Have a cookie üç™
---
Happy cake day!
---
I mean the fact that you havent mentioned spirit says a lot. Nurse is harder on console thus will find it hard to get kills.
---
I can‚Äôt find Philip for the life of me and
---
 Lisa tried to eat the baby so yeah that‚Äôs a thing so did Demo when
---
 I asked Amanda she just laughed in my face 
---
Ghost Face and me aren‚Äôt him great terms he thinks we are ‚Äúcopying his style‚Äù what ever that means 
---
Clowns to much of a drunk don‚Äôt trust him
---
Asked Doctor and he said ‚Äúahhh yes a new test subject‚Äù dipped out of there quite fast 
---
Trapper said I have no time to take care of a baby and I asked WHAT TIME like times irrelevant here like come on man 
---
Hillbilly stays away from kids doesn‚Äôt want to turn out like his father 
---
Spirit just wahhed at me 
---
Leather Face is basically a big child himself so no
---
The baby‚Äôs immune system is to weak to be around Plague 
---
Tried Nurse but she just teleported away 
---
And finally I asked the Entity himself I don‚Äôt remember much from that encounter some weird chanting but not like I heard it but it was in my head didn‚Äôt understand it but any ways don‚Äôt remember much after that got a killer headache though
---
Oink
---
The only tier list that matter.
---
Backstab:You become obsessed with one survivor. When your obsession is unhooked every survivor within a 6/8/12 meter range of your obsession has their aura revealed. This effect lasts for 10/15/20 seconds.
---
I bet your fun at parties
---
Wow, that is actually a good idea, maybe pressing the secondary action button and he just steps on it and arms it?
---
Solid little buff
---
There's toxicity at high ranks but it's different type of toxic. There won't be facecamping killers or shit like that, cause high rank killers know better, but there will be killers that stack insanely strong builds to try to bully and play like assholes.
---
I dont know why but I hear resident evil 4 from thsi
---
Just dont facecamp?
---
*Wait I got that too*
---
@LeaksByDaylight on twitter. Thank me later.
---
Bruh ima do it they disrespected me and got downed 2 seconds later so ima disrespect them
---
That by no means its swf. Matchmaking is like +-6 I believe and is really messed up
---
Imagine being that Spirit and watching that take place right in front of you
---
I don't. For whatever reason I can't get the hang of her. Idk how everyone can be so goddamn good at her
---
OoO was a borderline OP perk. It still makes trapper lose by default.
---
Agree you should get something for devotion levels, and the BP cap should be higher.
---
Made by a killer main obviously... Lol
---
you got a 3k why are you complaining? if anything it should be an accomplishment that you were able to kill higher ranked survivors
---
Hey everyone reading this, do the opposite of what he said
---
So we out here promoting DCs now?
---
Okey dokey then
---
Thank you for putting this into a understandable format!
---
DCing is bad in general unless it‚Äôs just shitty connection, if a survivor knows it‚Äôs a stealth killer and it‚Äôs this same scenario they should‚Äôve known what they were getting themselves into, using a survivor as bait while being a stealth killer just sounds like a strategy that works and it sounds like a strategy almost meant for stealth killers, to draw the survivor into a trap and sneak up on them
---
This is the taste of a friar, Giorno Giovanna
---
Then what about the other two?
---
Think about this: unlike survivors, killers are completely addon-dependent. Survivors can bring items with decent addons but you can also just pick something up ingame with a chest. In order to keep playing the killer you like, you need to keep spending bloodpoints on them to get your addons back, or you end up running a shit build. Some killers suffer more than others from it but it's still a problem. Black wards are just a way to ease the financial bloodpoint burden that addons cause.
---
No they were SWF bc the gameplay. I saw them working together and waiting for each other. And the endgame chat also
---
honestly i find flash clicking to be more annoying than teabagging.
---
and the survivor who purposely taunt you to run and take their bait to be rude 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
but hey.. everyone have their own opinion.. i played both role.
---
and i think as a survivor you are suppose to be avoiding contact if possible, and as a killer pov. survivor who blatantly provoking the killer and toying with killer is very rude &amp; often-ly  the same person will badmouthing the killer at the end game, that is toxic in my book.
---
usually they will get mad because:
---
\- killer ignore them for not taking the bait and focusing on protecting the objective
---
\- killer tunnel/camp them for being annoying
---
i want cosmetics of all the defirent masks theyve had to make cause they keep losing them bitches

I play both evenly actually. ‚ÄúMaining‚Äù any one side is pretty stupid tbh.
---
Thats is true. I get that I did well. But thats only bc they made so many mistakes towards the end
---
Ace is the avatar
---
Yea it is annoying I think you need to get hooked twice because that's what you're suppose to do
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have clicked on that sub
---
Bubba be like:" Guess what bitch BOI. Ur going to the basement for some Play time."
---
I main Tapp on Survivor due to how dark the right set of clothes make him. Perfect for the darker maps. Spirit and Pig are my mains for Killer.
---
Iron-y.
---
All they had to do was give mettle a better debuff after it was used up. Instead they just made it nearly impossible to get 3 stacks to activate the perk thanks to having to require to get a protection hit to gain a stack , protection hits are not impossible to get but is always 50/50  even tho you clearly help someone tank a hit the game wont count it as a protection hit .
---
Indeed same here
---
Well that can make the trophy a lot easier if that is the case... what‚Äôs the time frame of the escape? Because I‚Äôve had one time where two people hopped through, then after like 10 seconds, the other two hopped in but no dice
---
Just had an annoying game with a toxic Nancy/Steve couple. Dual flashlights, at one point they were just swapping off and I was blinded for a solid 30-40 seconds straight. Ended up getting the 4K kinda. Steve dc‚Äôed on his last hook
---
1. SWF matches for the highest ranked player in the party, so it' no their fault.
---
2. You got a 3k and won why the actual heckin heck are you complaining?
---
match making is bad at matching peoples ranks, so dont feel bad your getting high ranked players, happens to all of us
---
So was that a band wagon comment then?
---
[if you want to make one yourself ](https://tiermaker.com/create/dead-by-daylight-survivor-icons-10992)
---
Ah yes, Fellow prestige ghostface, congrats
---
Idk why the quality dropped so hard upon upload
---
They are placed from cute to badass
---
That‚Äôs why I always wiggle, I hate people acting like they‚Äôre going to give the hatch then close it
---
Some one had to do it.
---
How did u transfer the background to ps4?
---
Thanks. Ghostface is my favorite killer to play now.
---
No it just seems like it's a "killer main" post because it's very one sidded
---
Yeah, I love playing him, what perks do you use?
---
Better ideas tbh ^
---
Work and life happens so not everyone can play at specific times.
---
Bill sounds like the clown. 
---
He might of been badass in his game but here he‚Äôs just stinky.
---
What does BM mean?
---
I did my  first 4k as wraith then i switch to Bubba and now i can do 4k quite often cause 20-15 ranks players cant play against my chainsaw
---
Are you able to get last years skins for free? With the pedals that allow you two free do they only apply to the current batch?
---
I just had a Doctor camp on one of the last gens on the map The Game. I was so pissed when I found another gen and then died because of other survivors getting chased around the last gen
---
You were Altruistic and selfless, you‚Äôd go free.
---
If I remember right, I used BBQ &amp; Chili, Hex-Ruin, Thrilling tremors and Bloodhound. I make do with what the bloodweb gives me but I want to replace bloodhound with deerstalker.
---
Weeewoo this is the comedy police! The joke's too funny!
---
Please let this happen..
---
Bill is so fucking hot, how dare you
---
Try whispers, or discordance, It'll help you alot with early game finding survivors on gens and stalking them
---
Okay you‚Äôre getting it wrong. I‚Äôm complaining bc the rank match is very off. 
---
And shouldnt it be so a killer thats rank 5-10 that matches with them and not me? I‚Äôm a low rank 14 killer lol 
---
I got a 3k bc their mistakes at the end. Super lucky
---
- ace below S+ tier
---
say sike rn
---
Something I like to do when playing wraith is just stand on top of the hatching invisible blocking it then close it in their face a beat em down.
---
Oh yeah. They attract a lot of toxic players
---
... Ok then ... Cuz it‚Äôs not like anything in the survivor list doesn‚Äôt effect the other survivors just trying to play.. just the killer right? Smh.
---
Bad Manners, just being a dick.
---
It‚Äôs the loafers man.. those ugly ass loafers
---
I like to use Hex-Ruin because I can walk to the totem and stab anyone nearby or on the way while slowing the game down just a bit.
---
I am actually quite intrigued
---
Yeah, it's not like at the end of every SWF survivors don't just keep going back and forth infront of the exit shining their flashlight at you.
---
90% of these people are toxic so I commend the spirit for getting her own little tbag behind the pallets
---
Yes it is! It's called Negative Space. There are no shadows, and only 2 values in these types of drawings, white and black.
---
Uhhhh chill? Like the fuck?
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Nea's bum ass should be last looking like the entity and shit
---
Dont check on your totem immediately, instead try and predict where survivors are, if You check on your time and then go patrol generators they'll have an idea on where it is
---
As someone who is committed to eventually get P3+Max perks on everyone, I can easily say NOPE.
---
However, before you decide one way or another, you need to ask yourself if you care about being a completionist or not. The last thing you want to do is say you don't care about Prestige, max out everyone on perks, and then later change your mind and undo all that effort.
---
Ok, will do. Thank you.
---
No probs, have fun
---
How sensitive are you that you think I‚Äôm freaking out on you dude.. lol. Take a nap or something.
---
I'm not a completionist lol
---
I blocked a guy on Xbox cause he sent me like ten messages in a row so he got his friends to harass me instead with the usual hate followed by "gonna block me too pussy?" So I proceeded to block about four more people

Titanfall 2 did something similar. It should start right when we get our new dailies
---
You clearly are. Your comments are quite hostile even after I agreed with you
---
That's one of like 5 quality of life changes trapper needs
---
You saying I'm toxic.
---
Oh boy... I got discordance at the shrine, I feel this is a fun combo.
---
This is amazing
---
My point exactly.. you think I‚Äôm being hostile lol, I‚Äôm not the one who got offended by a meme. Seriously.. go take that nap.
---
Because usually when you break pallets you are in a chase, if it were cancellable you could bait it and then just go around it getting much closer to the survivor than if you do the whole animation, so is necesary giving the survivor those extra seconds to make distance.
---
I did this to a survivor today who teabagged. I literally only do it to tea baggers because they are the ones who deserve it. Except of course the survivor died unlike you
---
I was never offended but ok... Bye
---
You made a controversial post and you are acting quite defensive.
---
I wish everyone found the Jeff look attractive. Maybe then being told I look like him would be a complement.
---
For a moment I thought this was a Hellraiser reference. Like if they were turned into Cenobites. Amazing art!
---
Controversial? Lmfao. Ok bud.
---
Morioh chapter when?
---
My teammate was sitting on the hatch and got out after I did.
---
Jeff is a fucking hottie, wtf? 
---
Feel good about that.

I think the same thing when I look in the mirror before I go to the bar. But then I always look in the mirror afterwards with no new numbers and no ‚Äúguest‚Äù and say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll get em next time Jeff.‚Äù At least then I have the freedom to play DBD still half drunk, which is the best way to play.
---
This and "The Hookers" meetings in Wraith's basement
---
Ace and Jake are clearly the Luck Benders
---
Survivors still complaining about BBQ as if it actually impacts a match whatsoever
---
Ash, an earthbender?  Are you kidding me?  He'd obviously be a firebender!  He'd be sparky-sparky-boomstick-man!
---
I told you so 
---
All we want is Myers cheeks
---
Noice first 4k!
---
wow, just wow
---
Nah I‚Äôm saying Nea isn‚Äôt ugly.
---
That plaid skirt with the thigh high socks and pink hair, she‚Äôs a bad bitch.
---
Doctor for me (shocker, I know) 
---
The salt you generate, and the fact his mori is so satisfying, as well as satisfyingly spamable (rubbing your hands to kill a toxic survivor like you just got paid and had an unexpected bonus so now you feel like the richest person alive)
---
idk it doesn't really make a lot of "sense" technically that a bunch of murderous presumably American or Canadian teenagers would be wearing Day of the Dead getups
---
but this is dbd nothing needs to make sense
---
Babadook for DBD. Gay icon.
---
That's heinous, guess they all wan't a David... Jeff is top of the top tier for me tho.
---
It‚Äôs literally saying he has prestige 3 level 1. That‚Äôs why it says 1/50
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Literally no excuse. There was a hook right beside it. She'd have to go out of her way to do that, and it costed her.
---
100% deserved to lose the last kill there.
---
Bad internet for me and if someone‚Äôs working with the killer
---
Just cause other people are toxic doesn‚Äôt mean you should be. That just keeps the cycle going.
---
I don't think so.
---
The Nurse's outfit is in the PTB and the game files. There's no traces of anything for Meg whatsoever.
---
I do hope you're right, though.
---
Although I appreciate the hit, please don't t-bag. Just crouch and nod, I find that friendlier than the annoying clicking flashlights and t-bags killers have to deal with most of the time at higher ranks.
---
 Also if the killer isn't going to the gates and the team is all there just escape, they're most likely waiting for the match to end and prolonging it can get annoying.
---
i feel like they‚Äôd just pull a Ghost Face and call him The Slender Man
---
Kreygasm
---
Jane is a dick bender.
---
Clipping something like that? How is closing the hatch in their face like an asshole a clip? I don't get people sometimes.
---
I love this so much, and I know Wes would too ;-;
---
This same shit has happened to me, I don't even bother to wiggle when I get downed by this bs
---
Cant spell America without Erica
---
Fuck, I just remembered that video where the kid screas "its nerf or nothing" and shoot himself on the balls and laughed way too loud
---
LMAOOOO
---
Agreed, nice suggestion. You could still get close enough to a gen for an almost free hit, instead of the bullshit no-counter grab.
---
Good luck trying to strike a deal with Konami
---
I see a lot of Huntresses run Iri for the meme to watch the DC‚Äôs roll in. It‚Äôs kinda sad that it‚Äôs that easy but it‚Äôs also funny in a macabre way.
---
W
---
Man imagine being a red rank and losing to a LEGION. With only 2 perks too lmao
---
Not saying disconnecting is right but why would you care about pips? High rank games are honestly horrible. Teammates are mostly just as bad as rank 10‚Äôs and you only get the sweatiest of spirits and nurses.
---
We weren't SWF, I only play with 1 other person and usually he's never on so I only play Solo queue. I didn't do anything toxic to deserve a hatch slam in my face. Not everyone is toxic, none of the others were either, this spirit just got cocky and it backfired.
---
yep
---
Man that felt good :)
---
Wot
---
Am gay, can confirm.  I'm now WAY more interested in Legion builds than I was before.
---
I got it by having everyone escape at pretty much the same time, it probably bugged for you sadly.
---
Bitch move, bad manners, bad move, bowel movement. Basically it means doing something to brag and act like you are better.

---
I told the story before.
---
It was the mountain map, we were in killer shack, there was a gen and chest RIGHT in this area with a lit totem in the corner, absolutely GLORIOUS spawn.  Me and a Nea walk in.
---
And she promptly SLAMS the best pallet in the game before working on the gen with me.  I proceed to walk out of the room and as I round a corner to go towards a different gen a Tier 1 Myers walks in, grabs her, and walks out.  
---
I have zero clue WTF is up with some people sometimes.
---
Grats :)
---
What a random abbreviation.
---
I'd rather take the BM than have zero chance of getting the hatch.
---
haha... jk... unless?
---
Funny, just today I had a Claudette immediately DC when I found her in a locker, followed by another guy DCing. I was gonna let them escapen too, sucks for them
---
Who cares about ranks? You don't get rewarded for them. All you get for reaching red ranks is an endless supply of sweaty billies and nurses.
---
Typical garbage team mates that can‚Äôt handle a chase. Nothing new here.
---
OK, can't argue with that.
---
I find it strange that youre a Rank 6 P3 and this is your first perfect game
---
That's annoying and very hardcore BM. I just said "rude".
---
Its literally the most cancerous unsportmanlike thing ive seen lol. But its something you can actually do by hooking your phone to your ps4.
---
Nah, they are. I work on a gen and stealthily hide if I hear the killer coming. If someone comes over, blows up my gen and brings the killer to me, and then the killer goes for me rather than the culprit, that's bullshit. I'm not dealing with it.
---
Weak soul can't stand the blessing from the god himself
---
If it exists...
---
there's a lot wrong with spirit. ***~~prayerbeads~~***
---
You do realise the killer might have a smidge of intelligence and heard you breathe
---
What the fuck, how is this shit even allowed
---
Dead by Daylight is mostly balanced around killers that are most difficult being the most powerful and the most rewarding (which I would agree with, I think it's a good balance philosophy). However, since there's such a clear divide between survivor mains and killer mains, where someone could play one without ever touching the other. This means that people that mostly play survivor pretty much just see "nurse and spirit are the best, OP" and get mad when they run into them, without understanding how to juke and outplay either.
---
Sometimes I do it so the game can go on for longer, but I never do it in their face and nod at them.
---
There's also /r/DBDGoneGay as mlm content used to get heavily downvoted (wlw of course wasn't).
---
As a killer main I thank you all for reminding me of it **:)**
---
Wow. Even got the light shading down and everything.
---
/r/HolUp
---
Nothin' better than having intense diarrhea in the face of a teabagger.
---
The Hag and The Trapper can fake just as easily, Hell, The Spirit can stand still and fake out a survivor. I don't think it's to do with fakes
---
Not sure. I'm a rank 10 killer and I find matches within 2-4 mins
---
Lil pump? I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the guy the joke was originally used for.
---
A rare instance where a survivor DC is somewhat justified.
---
It auto saves. If you lost progress, contact the devs
---
Well I appreciate that a lot.
---
These should be canon lmao
---
Good advice. Just lay there for a few minutes, doing nothing (you know, enjoying the game), and give the killer time to go find the other guy waiting for you to die anyway.
---
I will ALWYAS DC if a killer brings a giant snake birthday cake large fries chocolate shake, call me toxic I don't fucking care it's over-powered.
---
My worry with a perk like that is that it encourages tunnelling and discourages Survivors from trying to help the tunnelled target. Results in lots of feelbads. But I like the fixation on Hooks.  
---
My perk ideas would roughly resemble the following
---
Reign of Terror   
---
Your grisly handiwork chills Survivors to the bone.  
---
Whenever you hook a unique Survivor for the first time each trial, each Survivor within your Terror Radius sees your Red Stain and hears your heartbeat as if you were right behind them for (X amount of time). Survivors affected this way will scream, alerting you to their location.  
---
Hex: Crucifixion  
---
Your alterations to the Hooks make accessing them incredibly difficult for Survivors.  
---
You start the trial with one token. Whenever you hook a Survivor, you gain a token. For each token you have, Survivor unhook time and sabotage time is increased by (amount).   
---
Shadow of Doubt  
---
You become obsessed with one Survivor. Whenever your Obsession unhooks or heals a Survivor, that Survivor will suffer from Shadow of Doubt until it is used up. Those afflicted with the Shadow of Doubt will be faced with a difficult Skill Check which will blow the generator if failed a la Overcharge and use up Shadow of Doubt.  If the Obsession leaves the game, a random survivor afflicted with Shadow of Doubt becomes the new Obsession.

Using Survivors as bait and camping isn't toxic?

"Survivors DC after failing a flashlight"
---
Doesn't mention killers DCing after getting flashlighted...come on man.
---
Teabagging - who cares
---
DS - easy to counter now
---
Flashlights - bruh look at a wall or fake the pick up
---
Head on - are you seriously complaining about a meme perk?
---
Body blocking - dont waste time and just go to the nearest hook and dont get greedy trying to get hits while carrying someone
---
Clown and Jake.
---
It looks like he missed his attack before you even dead hard? I think that dead hard still saved you by creating distance though. Nice one.
---
Nice! Only three more pips for me!
---
Michael Myers moon walking towards her.
---
You sound like a rank 15 survivor, getting scared at every little noise and running away. Nine times out of ten, blowing a gen and running away is stupid. Stay on the gen and finish it.
---
Easy on the ad hominem hero.
---
It's to do with the new matchmaking, most low rank players SWF with their high rank friends. And since the 3.2.1 hotfix they will now be matched with the highest ranking in their SWF.
---
Ahh Australian Spirits at their finest being sweaty cunts.
---
Nice keyplay either way.
---
Np! Just groom a little bit and maybe some beard oil for a cleaner look while still keeping most the hair and beard. Best of luck.
---
Thanks but like what happened to him and what did he make?
---
what were the changes like? Can you share?
---
Wos
---
Use a VPN, and I highly doubt that anyone on this small of a community would get THAT mad. This isn't GTA online or BO2.
---
What spirits are you experiencing at rank 16?
---
Ive been in a party with a kid whos done it. When you connect to the game your able to see the ip addressess of the people connected. Hence they generally play with a group. So they can figure whos ip adress is whos. That way picking the killers is a no brainer. Its not a difficult thing to do just takes know how.
---
Devs! Nerf giant snake buff chocolate shake!
---
Hag and Spirt are my priorities, they both look awesome. I got Wraith and Huntress past year. I use Wraiths with a different headpiece, looks great.
---
Spawning on a hook is my favorite part about high ping.
---
I love this sub
---
lets just throw in all four legion
---
Make sure that everyone brings salty lips!
---
I forgot about Dwights moonshine lore haha
---
Add in No HUD.
---
Honestly I'd rather Double BP
---
Lmao whatever you say little man
---
By "known what they were getting themselves into" do you mean being one of two survivors alive and getting downed? You know you you can't see the Killer in the lobby, right? Hope you aren't planning on being a lawyer.
---
Also I guess basement camping should be respected  as a strategy too right? Since it's just leading Survivors into a trap.
---
Wait for the live version release. Anything you earn on the PTB is NOT carried over to the live version.
---
I mean theres still some of the same kiddos in this game too. Im not saying its frequent but its obvious when it happens whats going on. You dont just get those error notifications just for dcing. And the survivor who was acting toxic whos about to be put on death hook stops wiggling. I mean lets be honest here.
---
Ice Cream Bender
---
Don't prestige unless you NEED the bloody clothes on your main. It'll cost you millions of bloodpoints to P3 50 one character. You'll still need to unlock most of the perks for that one character after hitting P3 50. 
---
Keep everyone at 50 and unlock all the perks.  
---
Bloody cosmetics were popular 3 years ago at launch because they were literally the only cosmetics in the game.  Now we have a whole store, a new battle pass and more on the way.
---
I‚Äôve yet to go against a killer that DC‚Äôd after being flashlight stunned once, just over and over. But I have gone against survivors who insta quit on failing their first attempt at a save. Yes this is slightly opinionated, it‚Äôs also a meme.
---
If the killer is being toxic, then yes.
---
Is that a motherfuckin' joko reference?
---
it did
---
Yup was pretty satisfying watching him play her and just roasting the people crying about how it's the end of times with the rework.  He's one of the most rationale players in the community.  It's a shame we don't have more of them.
---
Plot twist we get a joker killer instead
---
Serves her right :D
---
it also has had success on freddy. it working on some and not all killers is still reason enough to keep it. and this is only the popular builds that people are finding, lots of people here and there just enjoy the perk for what ever reasons. 
---
as for the TED talk, they do work on one thing at a time, but they release/test multiple things at the same time since they do it at chapters/mid chapters. 
---
also, territorial is just one example you gave, fire up was great on old freddy, and thana is great with both legion and old freddy. i also do find myself using these two perks on other killers once in a while.
---
I usually let this stuff go cause I hate being overly serious about this stuff but this is just plain false and I‚Äôm getting kind of tired of people acting like killers have everything so hard. Survivors can never complain about anything without being called babies. I‚Äôm use to this sub being killer sided, but this is a whole other level of bias.
---
Any chance you‚Äôre on PS4? I play on that platform and this past week has been incredibly frustrating with all the laggy killers, I‚Äôve tried my restoring my system in safe mode, restarting my internet and even adding a LAN cable which seemed to help a little.
---
Bro you juked him harder than a fucking Barry Sanders
---
There are others read that wiki for a good taste, at the bottom, check Benedict Baker. He is a 'survivor' has met other 'survivors' and a couple of killers
---
interesting
---
I'm on xbox but for me and my friend it started lagging like hell when we were in a chase
---
Thanks, my dude c:
---
Forgot the shitpost tag dude
---
Pepega :mega: PVCCCCCCCCCC
---
Coincidentally, you switch to killer from survivor you learn what you would have done to get away from the killer and it makes the killing so much easier! Especially with that much time in as a survivor.
---
It's also soooo blatantly obvious the devs are homophobic and voted for Trump.

David is a great place to start. We're gonna live forever increases your bloodpoints gain, which makes leveling in general easier. 
---
I personally did claudette because most of her kit is useful, selfcare is a good crutch starting out, and she's kind of a ninja.
---
I‚Äôm really surprised he lost you, at that distance...
---
I deflected off a David who was half my lunge range before. But I also cleared 3 survivors on a sick jump that match so it evened out lol.
---
One of those "out of body experiences" where you get to watch yourself get murdered. Lol.
---
LMFAO
---
...and don't even get me *started* on The Doctor...
---
Facts
---
Oh god I hope that really is the case with OP
---
This is why I run Franklin's.
---
Look man seriously, all I'm saying is you aren't chainsawimg everyone. If the survivor is at a loop you are an m1 killer plain and simple.
---
Cool list. I said camping is toxic. Not those other things, but thanks for voicing your opinions on all those irrelevant things. Camping is toxic. Because in a game, people want gameplay and to participate in said gameplay. To sit there and prevent someone from playing said game until they lose is toxic and it's being a dick. Baiting is toxic, because it's exactly camping just not with someone on the hook. They are still being prevented from doing anything and playing the game. They're being left there unable to do anything until until they lose.
---
Also saying a mean word on reddit is far worse than being a dick to people in the game. Ok.
---
what do you recommend I spend my money on
---
No, you need to be in Nightshroud to hide your terror radius and red stain.
---
You‚Äôve hurt me on this day.

When im in night shroud does this hide my terror radius and red stain while crouched only or while crouched and standing?
---
750 hours in and I've decided to give up on prestige.  There's really no point.  It's wasted BP that could have gone into more perks/variety of builds, leveling another character or loading up on killer add-ons.  
---
The challenge of it sounds amazing, but it's just not reasonable unless you're a full time streamer.  My hat goes off to anyone attempting it.
---
Neas balanced landing, megs sprint burst, David‚Äôs dead hard, strodes decisive strike, Clauds self care (sometimes it‚Äôs good) pretty much all the meta perks are the best ones
---
I'm on PC and getting this shit
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt get why more survivor mains don‚Äôt play killer more often and vice versa. You learn a shit ton playing both sides.
---
Legit got survivors on my ass for making a killer-sided comment, I play 10 surv matches for every 1 killer match
---
It's either a bug or a shadow buff.
---
This is beautiful
---
Devs always nerfing survivors
---
It doesn't matter who the Killer is in game when there's 2 people left and you get downed and baited. What are you...?
---
I really don't know what you're mind is picturing for how a DBD game works. 
---
If you're in a game as a Survivor. There are 3 other Survivors. If 2 of those Survivors die, there are 2 left. You and the other guy. Ok? Now let's say the Killer finds you and downs you. BUT (and this is a big one) the Killer goes into a stealth mode and sits there. Now you can't do anything (aside from picking yourself up or have an escape perk, which I said is not for this case). You will sit there until you die and are purposely acting as bait for when other guy comes to get you. That's camping. That's being a dick. If you know what this killer is doing, and see the other guy is coming to fall into this trap, you are also a dick. Because you just gave the Killer a free kill. Sitting there and letting said thing happen because you wanted 4 or so notches on the blood web (and if that's just how you are as a person then nothing I say could change your mind) is selfish and you're going to die anyway and you made the other guy lose. It's the same mindset as sitting on a hook when the other guy found the hatch and refusing to die because you wanted a couple more points.
---
I do like them. I‚Äôm Mexican myself and really love Julie‚Äôs outfit in specific. I‚Äôm just saying it fits.
---
In that case people can keep doing gens...
---
Takes me about a minute. In rank 2 pc
---
I felt a little sad that you left your mates behind. Read that one was dead and the other got the hatch, still sad XD
---
My proudest plays where similar though. "just urban evading twice to open the door, being the last one", but hell that huntress was watching the doors.
---
Nice job mate! Good you recorded it :)
---
Hopefully they come to the conclusion that they‚Äôre not ready but thankfully they‚Äôre doing broader testing. This game is my absolute favorite but lag and bugginess ruins the grind.
---
Oh, for sure. I've been facecamped a few times and was just like "ok, well, I guess my team gets to do gens?". Facecamping is easier to deal with, like, I run Kindred usually so my team knows what's going on and then I can check my phone or something while sitting there on a hook instead of having to stare at a LF who is constantly hitting me on said hook.
---
I understand the killer wants to win at all costs like the survivor, but I also hear killers complain about the games ending too fast. And like, my dude, you're making someone's game end too fast by focusing them down so early. Survivors that only blow through gens make the game go faster, too, don't get me wrong and I know that's the objective for both. I just think it's toxic for killers to complain about certain things but then essentially hold someone els'e game hostage. I also think it's kind toxic for the survivor to just unhook you in front of a killer. But honestly, I feel like toxic is too strong a word, tbh. More like ... annoying as all get out. Oh, well, that was mostly said as a self-deprecating joke on my part, like your kill is secure, it's fine, let me do one gen, haha.
---
lmao. players with weak mental fortitude are so salty. 
---
a competition goes beyond just the event you're competing in....  mind games are a part of all competition. strategy. baiting attacks, making feints, getting them off balance. 
---
I'm sorry you lack the ability to participate and wind up losing to more skilled people.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dgaa29/new_glitch_with_the_new_plague_cosmetic_did_this/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Playing to win is not toxic. You're utilizing a strategy against your opponent in order to close the match with some kind of victory.
---
Everyone wants to play the game. Everyone wants to win. Survivors win by staying alive and escaping. The killer wins by eliminating the majority of the survivors in a timely fashion.
---
Camping isn't preventing you from playing the game. After all, you're already hooked/downed, aren't you? What control do you really have to "play the game"? It's a strategy - albeit a poor one - to take one survivor out of the match and (theoretically) make the rest of the match easier. It doesn't work because, surprise, the survivors can do generators instead.
---
Don't be mad at the killer for employing a tactic which is *by all rights* working. If your teammates are choosing to attempt some altruistic stunt, that's their fault. The faylt lies on the survivors for playing the game the killer wants to play it.
---
Instead, providing advice so that your fellow survivors may learn and grow in skill from the match is much more valuable. You might not play with them again, but they may very well pass on the knowledge you've given them and so on.
---
Help your other survivors learn and grow. Raise the standard.
---
Besides, take any elimination-type game/game mode. *Taking an opposing player out of the round/match is invaluable*. The killer in DBD is choosing to confirm a kill at the expense of losing the match. But hey, I guess AWPing double doors on CS's de_dust 2 map is toxic. I guess spawn peaking in R6: Siege is toxic. I guess spawn tubing in MW2 S&amp;D is toxic.
---
Oh wait... time and time again, strategies have been developed to counter these situations.
---
The fault lies on the loser. In any aspect of any game, you should always seek to learn from your losses. It doesn't have to be taken seriously and you don't have to go as far as to replay footage. Think back to what happened and formulate a plan for preventing it from happening again. This is what separates the skilled and unskilled - the ability to learn and adapt instead of bitch and moan.
---
If you find yourself matched with teammates who are trying to get you up, then the fault lies on them. If you find your teammate has been slugged/hooked and you *keep doing the same approach* to rescue them - and, due to that, die - then maybe it's not the killer's fault.
---
After all, by the time the other survivor goes down, don't you already know who the killer is? Wouldn't you have realized that, when slugged, the killer is using them as bait?
---
If a cheese strat works on you, it's not the fault if the one employing it. It's the fault of those unable to learn to counter it. Take a look at the tools available to you. Take a look at what you can do better. Then, do better.
---
Just this week, I‚Äôve had multiple blue screens on PS4 where the whole game gets an error and crashes, a buddy of mine was doing a gen with me and second later he was instantly down due to a massive lag spike that let the killer smack him twice without him even knowing it was happening.
---
Getting camped while other people do gens isn't the same as this. This is closer to 2 Survivors being left, and now you're being camped by a Stealth killer but in this case you can't let yourself die so they can escape.
---
No collisions on anything looks like.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize DCing from a game because the killer is pulling of a strat that makes sense for a stealth killer is a dick move, no a dick move would be to DC and fuck your team over because your feeling were hurt over a killer using you as bait, playing the game isn‚Äôt toxic, quitting early just because a killer is doing something smart to trick the last survivor is
---
Or maybe double BP for an hr from the battlepass every now and again
---
Fist fights? Are you getting into many fisticuffs in between your bming? Maybe focusing on getting actually good at video games or "fist fighting" would bring you more success. You're not wrong that getting into someone's head can help you win, but you still gotta be good enough to actually win, otherwise you will just lose and look embarrassing
---
Maybe she just wanted to close the hatch for the points. Maybe she was just carrying you to the hook and saw the hatch
---
I completely understand and agree with your points but man youre good at coming off as a total prick lol

I‚Äôd say meg, she‚Äôs got two meta perks that really help out, after that I‚Äôd do nea for balanced landing and then strode for decisive strike and then after that whoever you want

---
The killer is trying to do something other than run around aimlessly and hope to come across the survivor, it‚Äôs a pretty valid strat to bait a survivor into a trap, just because you think it‚Äôs a dick move doesn‚Äôt disregard the fact that the killer is trying something new for once and you can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs smart, hiding from a survivor so that they get close enough to kill is called thinking rather than the regular, boring, brutish approach that is just looking around
---
check pornhub's twitter. im sure they have a joke about it
---
whoever runs it deserves a medal
---
Mmmm sexy...
---
That's why you always hook first
---
I think she has the coolest aesthetics if all the killers (though I also love Plage and Legion for that reason).
---
You're a hero üíõ
---
IMO once per day seems a bit much. Maybe just do Full Moons like what TF2 does for it's event skins.
---
Why are you being downvoted? I'm the same, if a survivor is toxic and teabags i'll fuck with them before actually hooking them.
---
Who the hell told you all that bullshit?
---
How did the site even let you post this lmao
---
What‚Äôs that old saying? Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right.
---
That survivor is either gonna have to get away or get caught, if they get caught by the killer then the killer did their job, why should you DC and screw the killer because they did something effective enough to catch the last survivor, THATS toxic, if the killer is being smart then of course I‚Äôm gonna encourage that, you know what I don‚Äôt encourage? Assholes like you who DC at every little inconvenience because they can‚Äôt handle the fact that a killer is using an alternative and a more effective strat to win, its not toxic to use a specific perk or power that was made for literally this exact play style to win, fuck the killer for trying something different though right?
---
As a spirit main I must say only 80% of us are toxic, the other 20% (myself included) are just better than you and you should get good scrub /s
---
I had let people get away before but would take forever because they thought I was being toxic
---
He supposedly created the hatch and was the first to discover methods of survival ect.
---
This some kinky stuff
---
But then you give them the satisfaction of having someone DC on them.
---
The trick to spirit is audio, audio is your most powerful tool when phasing, with our it she‚Äôd be complete trash, you listen for survivors in order to locate them, injured survivors against the spirit are done for most of the time, iron will is a really good counter for her, if you pay close attention to visuals like grass and listen closely you can steamroll every game, with spirit strider will make you unbelievably good at tracking aswell but remember that aura perks don‚Äôt work while in phase so I tend not to bring them. That‚Äôs it, some tips to help you out as best I can offer, probably not everything I could‚Äôve said but some of the best
---
the exemplary have always been targets to the unremarkable. 
---
(just wondering if I can get upgraded from total prick to pompous douche?)
---
I have nearly 3,100 hours.  However I'm the perfect example of my warning. I thought all I wanted to do was to max out all my killers.  Turns out I should have  thought about it harder. I can't give exact details on when the split in terms of hours played  but I can say this:
---
* Pre-Clown release, all my killers were maxed out on perks. This would have been all 11 killers available.
---
* I'm basing this off my Hag, who I rarely touch these days and she has 3 pages full of maxed out perks, for 45. 
---
* At one point I also thought I'd want to max out survivors but as I've binged more and more on the game that notion has waned. It's now a 'if I ever get done with killers, maybe I'll come back to this". I now focus much less on keeping more than 1 survivor maxed.
---
After the Clown released there was a 2x BP at some point, and that's when I decided to go all-in on prestiging. Since I've started this endeavor I've kept a personal spreadsheet to help me keep some semblance of progress. Using that I can tell you the following
---
* 4 Killers are still at Prestige 0, Level 50, max perks when I did that initial push
---
* 1 Killer is Prestige 2, Level 26 and is my current BP dump. 
---
* 3 are now currently maxed out and done
---
* The other 9 are Prestige 3, and if my stats are correct I have roughly 102 Bloodwebs between them all to get them all maxed out, thank god for the recent addition of double perk purchases on bloodwebs. Quick napkin math, this should be another ~4.5 million BP, but that's not accounting for the quirks of the Bloodweb.
---
As far as my survivors, the situation is far worse. Just a quick peak shows I probably need something like 1,200 Bloodwebs to get everyone maxed out.  Like I said, I generally keep 1 fully maxed out at all times, and have 7 others P3+close to max perks. My Meg almost makes 8, she's P3 + lvl 50 but only partially into the grind for perks.
---
I truly believe if I had just gone with going for Prestige 3 from the start, I would be done with my killers completely, if not then I would be damn close.  As it stands now, I'm starting to feel the burnout from the game, and anytime there is any sort of bonus BP event I'm all over it to do some serious damage to this grind. Can't wait for the Archives to help along as well.
---
For Context: As soon as my friend got hooked, he went invisible and got 3rd person killer view for the rest of the game. His body, as seen, decided to stay on the hook but not register.
---
I don't think he got out. I think he finally had all his life force consumed by getting sacrificed too many times. I read that the entity shoves these kinds of people into a place kinda like limbo
---
And then moring them on the closed hatch. There's been those on reddit getting like 1k+ upvotes so I think dbd reddit is somehow disagreeing.
---
Outplayed lol
---
Not an excuse for being cunt.
---
Say no more
---
"gg ez baby killer haha"
---
I play Huntress on PS4 all the time as she‚Äôs my favorite character and I love her gameplay, I play other killers only for dailies (except a bit of Pig sometimes) though I‚Äòd love to play some Nurse as well because she‚Äôs so different to play (as and against), and to add some variety to the killers encountered on console.
---
(I‚Äòd never use iri heads though.)
---
They aren‚Äôt helping the killer by being bait, they‚Äôre playing the game, some people like to actually play rather than DC every match when things aren‚Äôt going their way, the killer isn‚Äôt a dick for using their head to trick a survivor, you‚Äôre a dick for promoting DCing as a valid thing to do
---
And now that spirit is most likely gonna post how overpowered and unfair Adrenaline is on some forum. Lol
---
I love this way too much, honestly.
---
Its a nice and considerate thing to give them a free hit. Nothing wrong with it. And I'll continue to do it. If other players decide to do a victory dance that's not my problem. Though I have no issue with it, They earned the victory. No problem with them celebrating. Killer shouldn't have an issue either unless he's highly sensitive and easily triggered
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dgaizq/gamebreaking_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You should probably use dead rabbit and Monitor &amp; Abuse, that way your terror radius isn't as big as your aura ability. Maybe put on play with your food to allow you to increase your speed. You're probably gonna go to endgame anyways, so you could run NOED, but that's up to you.
---
I don't think this is the dedicated servers, it looks like a bug that's been around for a few months or so now.
---
Always struggle and be a pain in the ass. Also applies to IRL victim-situations too.
---
Relatable
---
Not every SWF is a P3 Squadette, flash light clicking tebagger. I guess you forgot people play this game for fun.
---
Huh, interesting. I've never encountered it before so I just assumed it was dedicated servers.
---
As you should!
---
I'd say do the same while playing pig but they might need her so.. ;)
---
As a non key user im assuming you had an addon that instantly opened it? Because that part confused me
---
A real g from the unit.
---
Union mandatory lunch hour
---
Lol very nice.
---
Yeah I agree, I actually didn't see it until after my post which is unfortunate.
---
I love playing Nurse for her power. I love being in total control.
---
I love playing Spirit for the post-game salt. You just know it's coming and it's funny every time. 
---
I love playing Myers because of his mori. There is something euphoric about holding up a survivor who has pissed you off in some fashion, looking into his/her eyes, and sticking the knife in their chest. Ooh baby.
---
I love playing Bubba for his basement build.
---
I love Hag's map control.
---
There are few better feelings as a killer in this game than herding a survivor into a trap as Trapper. If Trapper was buffed a bit more I would love to main him.
---
I love Iridescent Head Huntress and seeing the rage quits. I cannot wait to do it once the disconnection bans start. I'm going to be responsible for SO many bans, it's gonna be great. I have like 78 of them saved up currently. Going to try to get to 100 before the year is up, then wreck shop next year.
---
I love cutting off jungle gens as Demogorgan and screaming in their face. Love how monstrous he is, it's something different from the others.
---
Freddy is so damn good at so many things, it's always a pleasure playing him now. And his slowdown build is amazing.
---
Can't say I particularly enjoy something about the others. But the ones I mentioned.. those always have something about them that I enjoy doing.
---
That's probably the most satisfying thing that can happen in this game. Bra-fucking-vo
---
Something tells me you're that kid that looks for ways to kill at spawn in games. Just a hunch. Btw, killing the moment of spawn is a strategy like bald is a hair color.
---
So much of what you're saying I'm sure you think is a good comparison or insightful, but I'm talking about being baited when there's just you and one guy left.
---
Spawn camping in FPSs isn't nearly similar to DBD camping, I don't know how you thought that fit. 
---
I really can't figure that one out.
---
Onto the actually applicable part of your response.
---
This whole thing isn't about helping others learn, this is about just not rewarding Killers for cheap and shitty tactics that make the game unfun to players. If they feel the need to use those, and you play along, you are incentivizing their behavior.
---
People sit on hook when face camped because it punishes the Killer more than offing yourself would. (And yes even in face camping there is a chance to escape even though not likely. Again, not what I'm talking about) Not because they have some moral obstruction against leaving the game. People leave all the time just from being annoyed. You get far more tunneling DCs than camping ones.
---
From what I gathered, your solution to a Survivor not to get camped or be used as bait (sitting on the ground and unable to pick yourself up or escape which is only what I'm talking about) is just don't get downed.
---
All valid points, and I agree with most of them.
---
The reason I originally made this post is to get the divided reactions of survivor and killer mains and see if we could spark a conversation, but most people just stick to their own devices.
---
Either way, have a nice day!
---
Those things deserved the nerfs
---
Wait no but for reals, why are they all male when half our characters are female
---
Cringe
---
This is why I made the post, to get people to react and see if we could spark some sort of coming together. However mostly it's just people picking one of either side.. it's too bad
---
Have a great day anyway!
---
What are you trying to say?
---
Thank you! Im really interested in this topic, I like imagining their backstories. Sadly Im not good enough to design them, but let's hope in the new archive in the game they will show us more!! Im really interested in Trapper, Wraith and Huntress' story
---
It‚Äôs already out on mobile???
---
I mean yeah, do bones, that's not unreasonable
---
I don't think there's a misunderstanding here, when a survivor walks dead infront of me (the killer) when I haven't even left the hook and they go for a save and proceed to unhook, they are either really ballsy with BT or they want to get more BP... even if it means screwing your teamates over. I've seen it a couple times in low ranks (around 11) and it's such a dick move that I feel bad for the victim of it and go for the overly altruistic one.
---
Herobrine as a killer
---
Alex as a survivor (so they don't look too similar, so we don't have two steves and Steve is too wide)
---
We could settle for an enderman or a wither skeleton as a killer as well
---
or better yet. Creeper. 0 terror radius, 110% mvspeed, a power to explode and instadown everyone around him, but he respawns in the basement and has to go back to pick up... wait. how will he pick them up?
---
Oh I know. Make him Nurse speed and his explosion insta-sacrifice. This sounds fun to play against. /s
---
It‚Äôd be interesting if in this mode, the 2 killers are competitive instead of coop. Whoever gets the most points between the two wins, survivors just have to escape as normal.
---
Thank you for getting that spirit
---
That's it, im going to say it
---
Spirit has counterplay
---
Monitor and abuse scratched mirror with something like whispers is some of the most fun I have had with a killer
---
&gt;AWPing double doors on D2
---
TRIGGERED
---
ooch, that one's gonna hurt her feelings real bad
---
yeah so... clearly you don't get it. 
---
&gt;and neither that or boxing has "make the other person lose their cool" as a win condition.
---
yes actually... the nature of competition is that the person to lose their head will lose the competition.... when you fail to think and only react emotionally from a place of weakness you are easy to read and manipulate. its also called "falling into your opponents pace" 
---
.....
---
&gt;but surface level trash talk won't let you "get into someone's head"
---
but I was never just talking about surface level trash talk. in fact in games I don't even talk to the other person. I just spam emotes. 
---
&gt;like Connor McGreggor or something. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
---
nah. I'll pass. you could pay me to watch that loser. 
---
&gt;They analyze everything right down to their planned opponent's training methods to identify something as simple as lowering the left hand during a kick. Then
---
lmao could you suck his dick any harder? I really wanna know. you're quite the fanboy aren't you?
---
&gt; Then, that's when you can goad things out when you know what it'll lead to. Goad him into a kick that you know he'll leave himself exposed on, then capitalize on that.
---
yeah.... fyi. this is all shit I'm talking about. 
---
it translates to laying traps and fucking about in game. faking retreats and then doubling back on people. spamming emotes at them while distracting them and harassing them. 
---
lmao. 
---
I don't have a clue what happened in the video. I don't play this game LMAO.
---
The changes will only inconvenience the already good nurses out there, at worst.
---
The one's that'll suffer are the ones who went omega nurse or 3+ blink nurse.
---
Congratulations!
---
Plz make more og this. I love it
---
Broke "dont tunnel to avoid ds"
---
WOKE "use unnerving presence to avoid ds"
---
You know, If you feel like being toxic I guess.
---
Very odd that no one in this thread is talking about issues with being at work. I wonder what the average player age for this game is...
---
That said it should just be the first killer/survivor game of the day gives a bonus 10k bp or something like how the dailies work. Rather than a multiplier to remove the possibility of a bad game or if the other player(s) disconnects.
---
&gt;lmao. players with weak mental fortitude are so salty. 
---
r/iamverysmart wants their cringe back
---
Just played with him, it was super satisfying seeing it back fire lol
---
yeah what's so bad about his comment lmao I do it all the time
---
Well except me. I died because I suck at getting away from the killer and she was tunneling me
---
You dont get a BBQ stack which is worth way more than DC bonus. Oldest trick in the book.
---
Actually, Unnerving counters DS
---
I am a Spirit and if they played fair, I almost always give them hatch or exit gate. I feel attacked.
---
\*Getting rid of her strongest add-ons and giving her more interesting ones\*
---
This is why items should be hidden tbh.
---
Finally, true power
---
&gt;You clearly like to be a cunt.
---
I disagree.... 
---
not all characters in games are designed to fight mindlessly head on.... I don't think its toxic to utilize the character in the style it was created for.... a little strategy goes a long away against most opponents online.
---
Yeah, not all Spirit's are dicks. Just most. You're one of the cool few who aren't toxic.
---
Pair with technician and I can see it being kinda scary. Even if its only 50% to stop the explosion.
---
lmao, were you able to phase through it from the start?
---
They're pretty hard to see if you aren't paying attention before the game starts. You gotta remember she was in First Person and was chasing not just me. Also, when you're downed or hooked, your item doesn't appear in your hand.
---
Was spectating a new Steve and watched him get the hatch shut on him. It was pretty sad, especially when Ghostface brought him to the hatch and chased him without hitting him
---
On PS4 so sadly there is none, she instantly left anyway. I did send her a message saying "rude" She replied haha
---
Then gg mate
---
pretty sure those are the same thing.
---
Well, what are you doing here then? Were you just lured in by the title "BM Counter Play"? lol. You and I both acknowledge that we're aware of the same tactics. I think you're practicing it a bit as well. You're trying to goad me too, saying I'm a Connor dicksucker, but I was talking about the coaches, not the fighter. I just used his name 'cause I don't recall his coaches name but I saw a video about how they break down their techniques, and at that level many coaches do the same techniques.
---
Maybe you actually like Connor McGreggor, I sure don't know. You don't know me, and I don't know you, and after this I'll be fine and I bet you will too. This is just harmless internet banter, about as surface level as we've been discussing. You know a thing or two, which is cool, and you know about as much about me. Not much more to discuss.
---
did you get that idea from Titanfall 2?

my eyes are always on their hands at all times though.

Aren't there bloodweb changes coming?

I‚Äôm not talking about killers who haven‚Äôt left yet... literally so many killers solely facecamp to ensure a survivor dies

Context is king, and in the context of the game, it's not problematic

You should search up what holding the game hostage actually means.

It's even on both sides when you take into count that there is 4x the chance for survivors to do this bc there are 4 of em.

I had a plague kill no one and say "gg won bc swf :)"... We where all solo red ranks

What sucks tho is that this game is probs gonna be dead in 5 years...sadly

Cool answer. Not a single point to be seen because you can‚Äôt make one.
---
Relateable
---
Could be, not sure. I'd rather they do that than giving it by default and lowering the skill level a whole bunch.
---
This makes more sense if you replace r/deadbydaylight with r/deadbydaylightgonewild
---
Well if you used that brain of you yours you would realise there are multiple out comes, no gens may have done so that counts as ‚Äúapplying pressure‚Äù 1 survivor got 1 hooked but that says nothing about the others

You use fucking slippery meat?

Dude it's 20% for 5 secs after blowing up a gen and losing progress. This is just worse prove thyself

It's pretty good to be a killer nowadays
---
Oh shit, chucky as a killer
---
Yeah Legion farms bloodpoints more than any other killer out of what I've played.  Since you're constantly stabbing people and forcing them to mend, combining things like their ability with BBQ, Discordinance, Sloppy Butcher, and Whispers is really fun.  Don't tunnel survivors in hopes of hooks/sacrifices, just try to be as "fair" as possibly while making sure everyone needs to mend.  Sure, you're annoying as shit but you're going to get a ton of BP, have a lot of fun, and likely only get a sacrifice or two so at least it's better for them than a Spirit or something.
---
For future reference. Don‚Äôt walk away from the door, just let go when he/she swings then stick it. You 100% would‚Äôve been fucked if he didn‚Äôt get boozled.

You need to replace one of them with an addon which enables auras. Keep weaved ring for Purple/pink keys which helps u open/reopen the hatch
---
Then you‚Äôre pretty blind, literally have been arguing with you for a while now and you refuse to see reason because of your dumbass points that make no sense, ‚Äúoh a killer is using a strategy that will effectively win them the game, better start crying about it and then ignore everyone when they‚Äôre providing valid points that prove me wrong‚Äù I‚Äôm done with arguing with ignorance, you clearly can‚Äôt see when you‚Äôre in the wrong so you‚Äôre a lost cause
---
good meme
---
me when im stalking survivors in the gas station in Autohaven
---
Fuckin proud of you!
---
I try to play Both Sides equally but killer is much more stressful. Maybe that's because I don't use ultra-rare add-ons unless I'm having a particularly bad day. But I just view the wards as cheating. They are way too common. They're more common than party streamers or even yellow tear add-ons sometimes. I wouldn't have as much of a problem with them if people didn't have dozens and Play Iridescent Huntress or infinite Evil Within 3 every match thanks to a near Unlimited Supply of wards. Another huge problem I have with them is survivors 10 to disconnect upon seeing them or quit the moment they are downed in a match with a ward.
---
I agree with most of the stuff you said but most add-ons that will help a killer win matches aren't the ultra-rare busted stuff. The ultra-rare busted stuff tends to actually give you a black pip or entity displeased. You're not going to 2 Pip with Tombstone Myers or iridescent head Huntress most games.
---
Like I have said. My main gripe is that there's no real counter to the killer Wards and I've encountered many individuals who have dozens if not hundreds.
---
At least whenever I see a survivor with a potentially powerful item or with a white Ward... Franklin's demise can counter it. A perk I run whenever there's more than two items.
---
I see, I‚Äôm with you on all those points. Definitely isn‚Äôt fair to complain about gen rushing and then tunnel on the back end - two sides of the same coin there. A lot of this stuff seems to be ‚Äústuff I don‚Äôt like is happening to me, must be toxic‚Äù, so I appreciate you explaining a bit to me. 
---
You can count me as a big plus-one in the wishing people would complain a little bit less. The DBD community isn‚Äôt nearly as bad as people think it is.
---
Cursed sub
---
Spirit and Jake
---
If you teabag and point at pallets I'm going to assume you want my attention. So when you get hooked you'll get my full attention until your game is over with.
---
What‚Äôs the point of a mori after 2nd hook? are you thinking straight ?
---
Wdym you get a perk every time you level up, level up character level or overall player level?. Hard to level up without bloodpoints. Plus this will never happen as they just changed it to help newer players by 4 perks showing at lvl 50.
---
? You can see when someone commits to an action because the animation will delete their item from their hand during the duration.
---
It is CORRECT to watch their hands near windows incase they go for a window juke which you can thus predict. You can also tell if they are going to drop the pallet early or not so you know to commit or not.
---
I think a lot of Nurse/Spirit players are inherently sadistic. I think it also relates to their power. If they can't find anybody leaving the hook, it's much easier to use their power to go back to where they know 2 survivors are. This pretty much leads to soft camping and/or tunneling.
---
Damn nice one, i personally always let the last survivor escape through door or hatch xd
---
Let‚Äôs be honest she wasn‚Äôt tunnelling, you just ran to her probably. If she was tunnelling and you‚Äôre as good as you say you‚Äôd easily escape
---
Spirit
---
Personally i just look around, easy to spot flying crows and they make sound too... No need to waste a perk slot for it IMO.
---
It‚Äôs a perk m8. What are you in about
---
Thats what a legion main would say
---
You just need to cleanse totems
---
If last survivor played really well I'll give them hatch or I'll give them escape if there was two instant disconnects. But I do farm them a bit first so I can get my points.
---
I didn't want to risk getting grabbed off the door, and am not good at timing swings.
---
Can't just congratulate someone for achieving something. Must be fun at parties üëç
---
They aren‚Äôt. The concept of the game is that four people are trapped in this place with a killer who‚Äôs sole purpose is to make their existence as unhappy as possible... within limits. Some hatch teasing.... completely acceptable. Especially seeing as how it didn‚Äôt even work out for them. Having fun is not the same as being toxic. Plain and simple.
---
I‚Äôm having purple flashing on some textures is that happening on yours too? I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs the switch that is malfunctioning. Hopefully it‚Äôs just the game.
---
We already have that cosmetic... She's always looked like a granny since her release...
---
Not sexist at all, first or didn‚Äôt see a long schlong, 2nd of it‚Äôs just the original player silhouettes.
---
Spies lets you detect crows 36 meters away.
---
You definitely can't hear them from that far away, and most of the time there's going to be something obstructing vision.
---
Run Spies with a Hawkins offering. It's insane.
---
New nurse is not a nerf. Unless you relied on 3+ blinks addons to win :)
---
There are 2 genders stop being stupid, people are just delusional and want to be different.
---
Yeah I suppose he is not that hard to use in low ranks, You don't even need to stalk there, his lack of terror radius helps you get close.
---
I also used to think Leatherface was low tier, but then I learned the trick to playing him. Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6id0PUZpbWc) to see the power of Leatherface in competent hands. You just couldn't do this with Legion, or even Doctor.
---
Idk I've only played hag and legion
---
Because it is a nerf overall, before you didn‚Äôt have to charge so it‚Äôs just added time, plus add ons got worse.
---
You're my hero.
---
Amy From Kentucky
---
Wow
---
Lies
---
Nope, that would be Amanda.
---
Ghostface's terror radius gets decreased by his ability "nightshroud", crouching is only done to hide you.
---
This needs to be on top for this sub reddit
---
yes but this is a game. The killer's sole purpose is to kill the survivors. Not be an absolute cunt and BM someone. Never said having fun is toxic. Fuckign with the survivors is. As is fucking with the killer.
---
It wasn't bad at first for me, but I just had this game where I was Wraith, was chasing this Nea with OoO, she hops in a locker, doesn't get out immediately, so I open it, she's gone (Mind you, I was watching the locker the whole time) and teleports to a pallet. Then, I hook a meg, the gates are powered, I defend it a bit, think Dwight faked a unhook, so I wait until he goes for a real, but then he's running away. I look at the meg, who's still on the hook, but I notice it says that she's injured instead of on hook. I swing at the hooked body, she's 'downed', but then teleports away to the exit gate. I'm real salty about it, thank you for listening to my ted talk.
---
Tried iri head huntress for the first time yesterday
---
Survivors didn't get upset but it sure as hell felt wrong. That needs to be changed for sure
---
There should've been a multiplier for your devotion rank. Like first devotion rank gives 50% more shards, second gives you another 50% extra and each one after that gives like 20%. Once you hit 200% at devotion 7 tone it down to 5% per devotion. With the current base rate and playing survivor it takes you around 110 hours to get just 1 very rare cosmetic set. Like 45-50 hours per character. 10 hours for 1 perk from the shrine. It's stupidly slow to get shards. I've been cheating myself shards in like June to get banned (still not banned btw L O L) and 1 million shards wasn't even enough to buy all cosmetics from the store. Right now I sit at 28 million shards and I just use them to get free BP whenever I hop onto DbD for like 1-2 matches before uninstalling.
---
I was making a joke about how the clown eats fingers.
---
I knew that but I never do it, it's usually pretty easy to tell when they're commiting to a vault or pallet throw. Keys are very hard to see in-game if you aren't paying attention which is 90 percent of the playerbase, so to answer your previous question, that's how.
---
also happy cake day
---
i just keep myself not stupid by just simply playing both. I prefer killer but i probably have equal time on both.
---
Killers that use strong builds? like survivors using meta builds? are you saying that killers aren‚Äôt allowed to use good perks otherwise they‚Äôre assholes? oh lawd
---
Plus when all 4 survivors look the exact same it's hard to tell. I'm not go ma waste time on the off time I play killer just distinguishing between every person when they are all the same. I'll feel bad if it comes down to someone getting out early but come on lol
---
Dont be a meta slave, be a special snowflake and do weird shit!
---
Ruin isnt the only perk that slows down the game! dead hard and balanced landing arent the only exhaustion perks!
---
Personally I like to just take non-meta perks and see how well I can do, if I do bad oh well I did bad. If I do well then great I do well.
---
You dont lose in this game unless you depip, its not about escaping or getting a 4k its about getting a pip, but even then getting a pip is only a goal if you want it to be YOUR goal. Why do you want to pip, do you want to be rank 1?
---
Fuck the meta, just play the damn game for fun and stop worrying about if your build is "meta enough" or if your killer is strong on some arbitary tier list.
---
That mindset revitalised the game for me
---
I'd start with hag. Ruin and devour hope are both good teachables and she's pretty easy to play for beginners
---
I stand at the exit hoping the killer downs me so they get extra points and I crawl out. Seems like courtesy
---
One more reason to DC as killer: getting done with your ritual.
---
I did this to a claudette once, she was the last alive and i was playing wallhacks myers, let her run right up to the hatch and stomped it shut, she just stood there for a moment like ‚Äúyou bastard‚Äù, in the end i let her open the gates and go, but not after chasing her and downing her first, she got the message when i walked to the gate and let her wiggle off though :‚Äô)
---
They watched Coco.
---
I thought you might have been saying "lul dis man a clown" or some shit, tbh I forgot about the whole clown collecting fingers subplot
---
One of your biggest points is frustration in balancing the game around unskilled players rather than skilled players, and I cannot agree with you on that being a bad thing. The majority of a game's playerbase is going to be a more casual audience. The grinds is immense, and that could definitely be changed, but if they balance the game around 'competitive' this would kill the game. Killers are inherently weaker than survivors at equal skill levels because they have to be. If you match them up, then every survivor that isn't a really good survivor is going to stop playing. They tried to do a game balanced around skilled play, it was called DeathGarden, and it died because of how unpleasant it is to play if you're only okay. 
---
It takes time and work to balance out things that desperately need it. The art team exists to create cosmetics, and they can't really do anything with their skills to improve the game otherwise. Would you suggest firing the art team and only focusing on game health? Without cosmetics to sell, and new DLC to purchase, the devs simply don't have the income needed to actually put time into working on the game itself, it's really ignorant to take the standpoint of bashing on cosmetic sales when there are specific teams dedicated for that purpose, and that purpose is to generate income.

---
No love it, he‚Äôs shit
---
On mobile you have character levels as well, you get them by playing same as your account level. Its a more fun way to earn perks.
---
Or you could end up very far away from the survivor
---
&gt; only bitches DC ~~against myers~~ 
---
Much better
---
This is the survivor version of NOED‚Äôing tea baggers with blood warden
---
At least it's something you see rarely. It's not that big of a deal. Iri heads are ok-ish when ran alone or someone goes for the achievement (the one where you have to down from the distance)
---
Huntress will get her add-ons reworked eventually, as she only has one ultra-rare
---
The difference is the game is just over at that point, and you will likely not run into these players again unless you‚Äôre some insane top % player. 
---
So what are you achieving show boating against someone who is ‚Äútilted‚Äù after the game has ended? It‚Äôs pointless.
---
&gt;:^(
---
Swf bullying could be expanded to lots of things (body blocking, flashlight blinding etc), whereas the survivor list is pretty long and repetitive, probably for the SpongeBob joke at the end. And it's been said general frustration can be applied to pretty much most of these on both sides. 
---
I try to stay impartial as possible because it's really an us vs. Them mentality in the sub. And it's stuff like this that doesn't really help the conversation out at all. Both sides are frustrating, especially at red ranks, which I am in both sides on console (in case someone interprets this as one sided). But it's a lot easier to NOTICE dc's on survivors because it's a 4 to 1 ratio, but that doesn't translate to anything too concrete. You could just put one reason for both being the other side is pissing me off and I don't like losing. 
---
Either way if you see yourself getting toxic just get into the habit of cycling to a different game. Especially on console because comm bans.
---
Holy shit, preach it.

Tbh I don't see hex ruin as too much of an issue, I nail DS every time, so I'm pretty decent at doing hex skill checks, it's just a perk that slows the game down just a little bit. Whereas NOED... Just no,we understand your pain lol

No killer wants to face 4 SWF with 4 flashlights.

If you usually hit great skill checks like you say you do then you shouldnt be complaining about ruin, you can still gen rush the shit outta someone if all 4 survivors can work around ruin
---
True, hopefully it gets better as I rank up
---
Lmao thought I was on the Carti sub
---
Alright bud. Just lettin you know tho. Get good
---
The thing is, people started using lockers more lately
---
Head On and Inner Strength got added, both are used quite a lot
---
they also noticed that you can enter the locker with your DS to avoid getting slugged
---
ez pz scoops like stevey
---
I think the only thing that bugs me is the things that just dont seem fair in the slightest but survivors act like dicks about it. 
---
Like the concept of SWF flies in the face of everything the game was meant to be. I'm a survivor main and that shit isn't even remotely fair sometimes for even other survivors not in the SWF. They'll let you die. 
---
In the end. We all treat each other badly and wonder why we only play against SPIRIT with Prayer Beads and why all survivors bring the 4 god tier perks that beat all others.
---
It‚Äôs so true though. Like I play on console and every time I get that message after a game that‚Äôs like ‚Äúsoandso has added you to a group‚Äù I‚Äôm just like here comes some bullshit and die a little more inside.
---
People have fight or flight reactions...
---
I got a instant heal out of a box with ace perk.. and a key and found the hatch that game.. was crazy
---
If you played nurse normally with no addons shes no different. So many people played 3 blink or omegablink everygame

Why noed? You are trash if you take it with mori.
---
Actually footage of me drunk in Wawa after Halloween Horror Nights
---
Taking a break from the bullshit.
---
1 surv 0 Gens
---
She legit deserved it
---
For me, if a survivor tries to get my attention I will chase them for at least a pallet to gauge how good they are at looping. If they are good, I break the pallet and go find the weaker links to isolate them for later on.
---
I tried learning spirit in purple ranks and it was a terrible idea.
---
I hate 'n love this community
---
Was she toxic?
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true at all. Ranks don‚Äôt mean a thing when it comes to gauging someone‚Äôs skill. I feel as if anyone with enough hours is going to stop caring about rank because you get to rank 1 a few times and keep it then it just loses its flare. Once i did this I really saw how bad red ranks are on a greater scale of things. Probably some of the worst teammates I get are in red ranks because of the every man for himself mentality. When I‚Äôm rank 1 it feels like I‚Äôm facing my teammates more than the killer. I always feel like red ranks have the most trolls as well. Like people trolling their own teammates kind of trolling.
---
Of course it's a fucking spirit
---
Hey y‚Äôall! I was just playing killer and sacrificed a fucking toxic Claudette! #Camped #CamperAndProud 
---
She was teabaging every sec of the chase.
---
That's the game's way of telling you to run a different perk man lol.  Seriously run something much better that will make you stronger during the game to prevent it from even reaching endgame.  Trying to hedge your bets by expecting the failure of protecting gens is just a losing strategy.
---
He's the only person to have figured out how to escape the fog.
---
According to the lore anyways. This was covered in last years hollowed blight event. You might not have been around for it.
---
It's an all right perk but thrilling tenors is like a discount bbq as the gems not blocked tell you someone is on it but I'm all ears is useful as ambush pig as when someone fast vaults you can see where there going next and ambush them
---
&gt; rin and susie are friends
---
can this be canon now
---
Hehehe, yeah that's painful and very familiar, although nowadays I leave dulls so I have an indication of where NOED might spawn plus if anyone is running the Nancy heal perk
---
Like in Titanfall 2
---
If it isn't available for your region on the play store or apple store or whatever it's called you have to unofficially download the official apk version of it in order to play it. Right now it's only officially available in Sweden and just very recently Australia. If you're not in those 2 regions then you need to download and install the official game from a website in order to play it. 
---
The mobile version sucks though. I know it's in beta but still. It's bad. It really isn't worth the space it takes on your phone.
---
I like this.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/3wARxvG no mention of level 1 which would be live release which makes sense, but at the same time why give dates for the other levels?
---
I‚Äôve been There before left the game for about a year but got back into it this August and have been way better then I was before coming red ranks as a survivor since September and purpled rank killer 
---
just play with your friends and have fun rather then trying to sweat you‚Äôll find the game more enjoyable that‚Äôs how I got back into it

Yeah, guess an specific hour wouldn't work. It should be something like what you said.

Where did I say I was good? I literally admitted I suck at escaping the killer.

I find it easier to remember as people in the match= gens finished then the hatch spawns.

With the exception of the last survivor ofcourse.

Played it just for fun yesterday, got 3 people (killed the 4th) tbagging me on the exit gate. 1 slipped up and I got 4k, never felt so good in my life.

Odds are you would still gain ground on them, while also pushing the Survivor back towards a possibly unsafe area. Better than being lead where they want to go in my opinion.
---
With dedicated servers, who acts first gets the advantage. You should want to always attempt to take control of the chase when possible. The monentva Killer decides to follow is when he loses any control over the chase.
---
*"Ok, look. If we survive the next 24 hours, then I'll take you out on a real date."*

 *"Paying attention is what kept me alive through the years. That, and my good looks of course."*
---
Oh lol, I played him wrong since release - shit
---
r/wooosh
---
What is the nurse doing? xD
---
I'd say Adrenaline is the most useful Survivor perk. It grants a full health state upon the exit gates being powered (all 5 gens being completed) as well as a _very_ long burst of speed, which ignores Exhaustion. It takes the times where there's 1 gen left but you're injured and want to heal, which will take at least 16 seconds or a quarter of a generator, into a "get that last one done as soon as possible". It's even better when you're in a chase and the last gen pops and you make the Killer eat your dust as you Sprint away full health.
---
Meg is definitely the best starting choice, especially given her other two perks aren't terrible.
---
what?
---
Well, as I said, those harder skill checks wont be much of a problem for experienced survs. Also, by bringing such perks, he hives up on other perks that would be more valuable. His tracking is good, but once youve found a surv, youll still get looped, and hitting those shocks perfectly isnt that easy. He lacks a lot of map pressure, too. He doesnt have much mobility and if you wanna track someone with your ability youll have to give up another 5% movement speed, which makes him even less mobile, making his tracking ability also have a downside. All together, there are two things going only for the doc: The ability to stop survs from vaulting/dropping a pallet (which is sometimes not that easy and at certain loops actually impossible if played right by the surv) and the fact that survs have to give up time to calm down from madness 3, which does slow the game down for them, but getting them to tier 3 also takes time so that can be hard, too. All together a rsther weak killer
---
I love your argument. It's a slightly more grown-up version of "Billy's mom lets his stay up, so I should be able to stay up too". It's so cute.

If you're playing dbd because you need to win, you should probably play something else.

was that you haha
---
They are disabled on the PtB, one reason being so that everyone can see it at the same time on live
---
Yeah you're right up until the final part about the final survivor.  The hatch spawns regardless now with EGC for the final survivor.  They don't have to do any gens if they are the final survivor still up.  Obviously the killer can close it now though and there's no longer a hatch grab interrupt.
---
It's unfair when you grab a noob .. or what are they thinking? So disgusting
---
Is it on android?
---
No.
---
You‚Äôre asking something I literally answered in the comment you‚Äôre replying to. It‚Äôs in no way the most practical way to learn the game, or to not have extreme bias. I think you took the work ‚Äústupid‚Äù a little too personally.
---
I've always hated her simply because her power can be completely uncounterable sometimes
---
Yeah
---
Bread Machine
---
Wait how do you even know that
---
I don't DC, my points are my points

and what‚Äôs the killer doing during that time? sitting around? I don‚Äôt think so
---
This is why BHVR keeps warning everyone: it won't be perfect on release. They have to work out how much their current servers can handle, and how much they will need in total. They need to fix everything and work out what they need to do. Dedicated servers can be great but they need to work towards it
---
Everyone‚Äôs gotta snack on something
---
If you look at this thread:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/511/best-teachable-perks](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/511/best-teachable-perks) 
---
There's a few people on there that comment with some pretty good perks to suggest you buy. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter which ones you choose to buy or not to buy, but these perks are good ones to start working towards if you want some direction.
---
Its both sides honestly. The people who do that are also the people who havent played both sides to understand their perspective. For example, i was playing billy hooked someone in the basement then all of the other survivors came at the same time to the basement before i even got up the stairs and i got the 4k. "Toxic camper". Playing survivor there was a face camping ghostface in red ranks mind you. I asked him why is he playing like that and his response was " ghostface power sucks and you were genrushing". How do u even respond to that?
---
Happened to me with Michael

great stuff!

I credited him/her for the idea from a comment of an other post of mine
---
I have 3x the hours on survivor, and pretty much main survivor on certain platforms. Pretty much EVERYTHING in this MEME effects purely the survivors more than it effects the one killer simply because there is 4 of them vs one. But to answer your question, no, I wouldn‚Äôt. All of the people complaining that this is a killer sided meme.. are doing exactly what I wanted this meme to do.. show how entitled they are.
---
MORIOH CHO RADIO!!!
---
Exactly. Well put man

This is so sweet, great work

**New Map:** *Spirit Halloween Warehouse*
---
anyone got a link to the pic?
---
Yeah I've had that happen plenty of times, burned 2 streamers and then the killer just dc's to scam everyone out of their offerings and points they should really fix it... If the killer dc's the items shouldn't be burnt, I've come back to this game after a year or so away I can't believe they haven't fixed that
---
Dedicated servers release
---
Everyone: Aight imma head out
---
No, people in this community just have a weird habit of associating toxicity or incompetence to particular characters, regardless of who is playing the character.
---
Seriously. I feel like people who are angry haven‚Äôt even tried her.
---
The cooldown on her blinks is so minuscule it doesn‚Äôt even matter, your blinks recharge during your fatigue, and if it REALLY bothers you, there‚Äôs an Add-On that makes it faster.
---
She still excels at teleporting across the map and reaching Gens/ending chases easily, but you do need a bit more skill, because there‚Äôs more of a penalty to fucking blinks up.
---
For me I need those shards lol
---
But he tall
---
I'm glad GSync works for you again, but true fullscreen still has performance and response benefits.
---
Windows 10 is a little iffy with true fullscreen in DbD, but it does still work. I could help you out more, maybe some setting is incorrect. First of all, are you sure it's still being run in windowed fullscreen? So there's no blanking if you Alt + TAB? You could try a resolution that is not your monitor's native resolution (e. g. ResolutionSizeX=1280, ResolutionSizeY=720), then it will quickly become apparent whether the game actually forces true fullscreen (such as by using the monitor's menu to verify it is being operated at the set resolution).
---
I hate to love this community
---
I would say have it be randomized. That way each day it's kinda like checking the news to see if your school got cancelled because of weather. Though knowing DBD, I'm sure that would it bug out somehow.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not saying she is dogshit when compared to the other killers (like bubba) but nurse is dogshit when compared to her old self. I don‚Äôt think any rational human being can consider this a ‚Äúbuff‚Äù when they killed ‚Äúomega blink‚Äù and killed multiple blink nurse. Now personally I would rank her S and spirt takes the spot of SS
---
I don't want the dedicated as the state of point..
---
Lol saw your psn, played you a bunch.
---
Because of toxic assholes
---
Of course you'll get funneled with a key. If I slay your teammates first the hatch will show up and whoever is left alive gets a free, uncounterable escape since they tool hatch grabs away, despite the entity apparently being very pleased when a hatch grab happens.
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem
---
Anybody? For... Meme template purposes ofc.
---
What an ignorant hate mongerer
---
If the killer DC's you do get to keep your offering, atleast that's what happens to me.

Everyone who has asked how to do this... :) 
---
This is a custom background and not something you can buy on the store. There are a few ways you can achieve this look. 
---
1. You can do this through your PS4 Internet Browser. Google Dead by daylight wallpaper or find whatever cosmetic banner you want. You then click on the image so it‚Äôs full screen. Press the share button on your controller, then triangle and it screenshots it for you. 
---
2. Another way to do this (the way I do it most of the time). I save the cosmetic banner or whatever photo I like to my IPhone. I then use the PS4 Messages app and send it to one of my inactive friends. I then go back to my PS4 Messages on my PS4 and full screen the image on there. I screenshot it by pressing share on the controller and then pressing triangle. 
---
Once you have your dead by daylight background screenshotted using either way you need to now make it your background.To change your background you need to go 
---
settings &gt; themes &gt; select theme &gt; scroll down and select custom &gt; select image &gt; system storage &gt; select either all or screenshots &gt; select your photo. then you‚Äôre done :)
---
If you found this a bit confusing still or long winded there are plenty on tutorials I have seen on YouTube concerning this :))
---
Nurse is not dead!
---
Does anyone know what happens to the Insta heals you have? Will they delete them or what?
---
What i do is start the game and say to myself i'll play 1 survivor match and 1 killer match to get the daily XP bonus for them sweet shards.
---
It's either fun and i'll continue or it's not and i come back tomorrow.

I‚Äôve written a new paragraph on the thread explaining how to do everything :)))

---
I‚Äôve written a new paragraph on this thread explaining how to do everything :)

I guess so, but if there are 3 healthy survivors and one injured one anyone who‚Äôs played survivor for more than a few hours know that‚Äôs a totally viable tactic.
---
Well; since you clearly know a lot about art, let‚Äôs see you have a go at it, huh?

Play killer

I haven‚Äôt touched it unfortunately I just have it downloaded since it was free this month with PS Plus. My users xbigmood either way lol
---
Of course i got downvoted for the truth...
---
I used it a lot for a while. The best thing is if you run it for some time you'll remember totem spots and can find them even without the perk.
---
Haven't really used it in a long time but still find the totem quite quickly.

I play a different game wait for rank reset wait couple days and have fun watching baby survivors fail at the basics
---
What is iri head huntress?
---
I love using keys when a toxic killer is doing a 3 gem strategy or just starts slugging and refusing to hook so they don‚Äôt lose a gen.
---
I just gather everyone still alive together and go search for the hatch. The amount of hatemail I get from killers who think they‚Äôre poised to get an easy 4k only to underestimate the usefulness of Level 3 Plunderer‚Äôs
---
As a killer main i must say, she was a dick and she deserved it, great play bruh
---
No mither + resilense + prove thyself + toolbox with repair speed addons is one fun build &lt;3
---
It's a stupid meme bruh.
---
More spongebob pls.
---
ye but there was no jumping around, no delay, etc for anyone that game and he was hitting us ALL like that
---
Happy cake day
---
Spine chill is going to be less useful once that patch rolls in which makes a lot of the killers undetectable depending on their ability like Wraith etc.
---
Because I like more to have a survivor skin.. 
---
But as Killer I vote clearly for spirit
---
Time to use trappers faster destroying perk
---
Hey thanks trapper will do!!!
---
It's a good passive perk that is gonna slow the game down. 
---
I'd say the best play against ruin is to work on gens get better at doing great skill checks and if you only get a good skill check get off the gen wait a second or 2 and get back on to not chance getting more skill checks and just fucking the progress.
---
But hex is pretty much meta same for me as a killer main I see DH every game, I see DS every game, I see BT every game and I see Adren pretty much every game it's annoying but it is what it is and that is meta u can't do much about it just play the best u can and accept that ur gonna lose some games bc of these perks. 
---
Like I love trapper he is my favorite killer but DH and BT can just counter any momentum I get DS can too but it can be played around and sometimes u just have to eat it early
---
What the others said play killer.
---
Are you a child? I feel only someone‚Äôs who not old enough to drink would be asking for more spongebob memes.. and I grew up with that show I don‚Äôt even hate it.
---
I usually play Jeff or Steve, by now I can't really remember who the killer was, maybe Huntress or Demo. If it helps I'm like rank 16, so was it you?
---
I'm bad at huntress, but my last 3 games for dailys were pretty good
---
Well DCs counts as kills it doesn't feel as rewarding as a 4k without DCs the only time a DC can hurt u as the killer is if it was a early DC resulting in less points
---
tunneling survivors to mori immediately, you deserve the DS (killer main and non toxic btw before i get 1000000000 downvotes)
---
Killers can use moris whenever they receive them in the characters bloodweb.
---
jUsT a MeMe BrO
---
That‚Äôs a yes then.
---
Would be better without captions. Still good though.
---
GF is quite good against low ranks bc they probably won't have to knowledge of how to do anything about him
---
This drawing is amazing
---
1. You're not rly descripting exactly what happens before u get supposedly DCd by the survivors. Like do u get any messages by the survivors before it happens cuz that could just be a regular ddos attack which isn't a game problem more a general one.
---
2. Seeing as it is peer to peer idk if BHVR protects the host behind anything but they are the ones connecting to u I'm not the smartest in ways to get IP addresses but it seems like a possibility.
---
3. It's a very odd exploit bc the survivors would lose progress on their rank and get next to no BP which makes me doubt it's a exploit as there is no gain.
---
Just some ideas
---
No I didn't. Leatherface is Bubba.
---
I just hide the chat now since nothing productive is being said
---
I will buy and hope they don't change anything. If they change something like you don't get all things you unlocked when you didn't pay because you want to make sure you get all of it first, before spending money.. I will not buy
---
Definitely bull shit.
---
It would be common sense to play both sides in order to learn the game effectively and to not develop a strong bias towards one, so not doing so.. fits the definition of stupid exactly.
---
Steve: Weird flex but okay
---
Yeah. Borrowed Time is so fucking useful this totally sucks. I‚Äôm working to get his teachables now on Switch.
---
I'm gonna be 100% honest. I feel like such an asshole, but if I am getting hard-core gen rushed, and the survs are toxic, then I will attempt to do this, it the hatch is in the right spot.
---
Why tho you just repair gen and exit. If ure being face camped hold on hook as long as you can so your team mates can escape. You and killer depip but rest of your team still can manage Smth
---
What does dedicated servers got to do with it
---
They removed hatch grabs?
---
Lol that fading scream as he drops in success
---
I agree. OP, assuming you made this, great work. It honestly does sound very cool and fits him well, but it would suck if this were in game. The constant bells ringing in the chase theme for a killer who rings a bell to cloak would honestly just be terrible design. And listening to it on loop would get old fast. The 32 meter theme is too loud, too intense for being on the edge of his radius. If I had to sit on a gen and listen to him in a chase 30~ meters away I'd probably get up and leave. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this. I love the Wraith, his design, his concept. Super cool, and the music fits him perfectly, but this could not be executed in game properly.
---
Along with SMG as Helen Shivers for the survivor
---
what does that do? just Posting stuff like that isnt helping anyone
---
my guess is that its because it counters stealth killers pretty hard and some people dont want to deal with that.
---
i personally don't care and wouldn't DC because of it
---
I remember playing a ghostface who did this and it turns out he just wanted blood points and ended up giving me the exit gate :)
---
Give it at least 24 hours...

---
Hotel: Trivago
---
It really seems to me Bubba is underrated. I think that's the only "controversial" opinion I have. He is an above average chaser because of his saw, which is also way harder to juke up close than Billy's and guarantees a down in an open area
---
but free BP with the late hook and sacrifice
---
Legion and Nurse need to be higher up. There is no way that Legion is the worst killer in the game, and Nurse, while not being as good as before, she is still good.
---
If so many killers are using ruin because they need more time before gens get done, maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be having a discussion of the perk itself..
---
I love bubba hes a fun character to play. His chase is pretty weak sure he can break pallets with the saw but thats only if they throw it. Bubbas still very loopable.
---
Keep in mind, this is with PS4. Nurse is innately worse on console than PC, not just because she's harder to learn, but analog stick offer less precision than kbm, and juking is easier for survivors as a result. I think they might have went overboard with the Nerf tbh. 
---
As far as Legion, it's debateable, but I think he's genuinely really bad. Shit power, mostly bad add-ons, Wraith-tier map pressure...I just don't see what he has going for him. There's a reason you never, ever see him at purple or red ranks on PS4.
---
huh? 
---
who said anything about needing to win? 
---
are you saying you don't try to win? 
---
[.... Do you need a reason to not want to lose?](https://i.imgur.com/6KykQT6.jpg)
---
I thinks it's Quentin
---
What about a Claudette with a Belle of the ball outfit, I just like it because it is sparkly
---
I agree, he has the same problem Trapper and Wraith and all those killers have. I think he's just a stronger M1 killer. The insta-down and generally good add-ons, imo, save him from being terrible, but like any non A-tier killer, he really struggles vs good survivors. 
---
It seems that now, we have more distinct groups. Despite the tier system I made, around Ghostface, there is a really sharp drop-off in power. I just didn't want to give like 10 killers a C or D rank.
---
You report for being afk and try again I get matches right now take a while to find but u shouldn't walk away or not keep a close eye on the game
---
This would be better as a 24hr event. 1hr rewards specific lifestyles or work schedules. Daily rewards reward loyal players.

I would assume its not since it has nothing to do with dbd?

Blame the devs for not doing anything about the perk. I main killer and hate using it but I still have to or otherwise the game is over in 5 minutes.

It's because you weren't running the red ring, too!

She just rewards you way too much for how easy she is. People who can't play Billy or Nurse play Spirit.

As a killer main, I'm so very proud
---
They're the same in that they're revenue sources, and they're the two main competing models for post-launch revenue. Regardless of how either of us feel about "battle passes", I'm sure we can both agree that **no** customer likes lootboxes.
---
&gt; *I don't think premium battle passes should be in paid games*
---
That would be the impasse we've reached. Still, I'm happy if you've reconsidered some aspects, I guess we'll shake hands, leave it there, and hopefully the new system will work out great for both of us.
---
‚ÄúHaha why is this tryhard noob killer walking so slow,  haha look at him, he just gave up hope Nd is just watching me teabag.  Haha he‚Äôs probably going to qui... AHHHHHH FUCK FUCK FUCK ‚Äú

---
Happy to help where I can!
---
Swap Nurse with Spirit and that's me
---
Yeah, if everyone is just respectfull to each other in and out of game, I think this game and community could still last for years.
---
Either way, thanks for posting this OP ‚ù§
---
Everyone calls me killer main. Also, camping accusations are crazy, I know you're behind the bush meg.
---
fuck I can't beat tons of fiber that slides right!
---
It‚Äôs actually being in a situation where if the killer does nothing you can be there for hours. 
---
Being on the ground and bleeding out is not holding it hostage
---
Congrats!
---
...
---
Ready for rank reset ;P?
---
Slugging so the last survivor can‚Äôt use the hatch is NOT toxic. 
---
DCing is.
---
I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dga2lo/absolutely_no_chill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) right after because I thought the misguided hate was pretty hilarious. I hurt some delicate egos today, that is clear.
---
Nah, it's people like this that make us wary of genuinely nice killers.
---
I think in low ranks it‚Äôs usually new players who just want to see everything and haven‚Äôt become bitter and jaded like the rest of us. 
---
Moris are cool when you are new (Instead of being a revenge tactic after you get frustrated ten games in a row)
---
Thanks for copying the meme, mimicry is the greatest form of flattery ‚ù§
---
but bruh, now theres no reason to not use addons on her, they make her have new effects with her power and can make you have 0 terror radious for 12 seconds if you hit someone.
---
Thank you for correcting that
---
literally just take the hit without moving and then keep opening the door
---
Yea but developers consider face camping as game strategy. Even its Boring for both sides. When i get face camped i laugh until i float away. Tho the new players usually face camp peoples.
---
Yea, spirit overall is a better killer as well
---
That beard, that light blue eyes... give me more of these head type, BHVR. Preferably with nice short haircut.

I agree, 80% of spirits I have encountered were tunneling and hook camping, which is even more annoying considering she is literally the one killer you should never have to do that for. I bought her last night to try out bc I knew she was strong but didn‚Äôt realise how strong she could be, first game with 2 perks (rancor and bbq) on azarov‚Äôs and got 31k BP nearly double pip game even after giving the last survivor the gate bc they played really well (they also had a 30k game). I didn‚Äôt understand how strong she is but you still got to play smart and be able to mind game to play her fairly and try let everyone have fun - which unfortunately - most spirit mains don‚Äôt do, because they‚Äôre so salty about losing to SWF they pick her up and tunnel everyone just to feel better about themselves rather than actually trying to improve their own skill
---
40 years is extremely short period of time when it comes to the end of the world. You are short sighted.
---
Or at least make the yellow and the brown add ons built in and keep the green if we want to. That way we can use add ons to try to stalk like once in a game. I'm talking about red ranks. Here the stalking is impossible, frustrating and so not fun to play...
---
üòî
---
At these times i offer self reflection, why has this random person who you will most likely never encounter again bothered you so much that you felt the need to share on the reddit? 
---
I'm not having a dig at you but you are too in your feelings, if someone starts being cancer just leave the match and go again. Just play the game and fuck the haters =)
---
It is.
---
BRUH MOMENT
---
I don't play killer often but I see other people roasting killers in end game chat and killers doing the same to survivors. Is demo OP? HELL NO! I can't believe someone told you, you pay to win with him. I guess they just don't know how this game works. 
---
I am sorry he was like that torwards you. I guess we just get frustrated with our own mistakes and take it out on others. 
---
You will get better with demo. They all have a learning curve. Good luck out there!
---
How does it exactly name?
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been called a hacker because people don‚Äôt realize lockers make noise and people play with headphones is disgusting.
---
Nurse wasn't neutered. You guys are up in arms way too soon, especially when streamers binging the PTB are already showing that she's still very strong.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure about this. The night shroud power can be very useful if you are leaning stalk most the time is very easy. But you can also use it during chase for mind games, grabbing people off gens, general surprise attacks it really is something that can be used creatively.
---
shes still pretty good after her rework tho
---
Thanks for the friendliness, I appreciate it! I'm way more used to Myers (Proud Myers main) so anything even vaguely dissimilar I just can't play üòÖ
---
Le reddit assemble is pointless and making a reddit post isn't going to do anything has arrived
---
It's not in development, they're just locking it until the mid-chapter is released to everyone so people don't get spoiled.
---
still don't even know why someone would DC moments/minutes before the game ends.
---
Yeah I used to thought he was good at high ranks but like it‚Äôs still pretty easy to go against a ghostface even with ultra rare and rare add ons
---
Makes reddit post on how myers is op and needs a nerf
---
I chose Claudette cause of her perks
---
Nice escape, but that's not BM, that spirit was just dumb. There was no reason to not hook you before closing that hatch.
---
https://youtu.be/k9iYm9PEAHg
---
It's underwhelming...
---
I hope I can play against you someday, as I sent GG 90% of the time if the killer doesn‚Äôt tunnel or camp (because then it‚Äôs not really a game for me). 
---
I die a little inside when they blocked messaging because of the salt.
---
Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.
---
That's hilarious...
---
Congrats fam welcome to toxic city.
---
You hate stranger things? Why?
---
nothing, if they wanted a 4k they could have hooked and still closed the hatch with the time left over. They were greedy and being mean so they got done for it.
---
Yes but have you seen how drastic the survivor difference is? Or are we genuinely watching different games?
---
To catch a blendette, you must think like a blendette.
---
seems like its not worthless if its annoying. if it takes survivors additional time to retrieve their item (should they want to keep it) then it has a use.
---
Hated*
---
I got used to the show, now I personally think it's pretty ok.
---
But before I watched it, I just actively avoided it because dear God no-one shut up about it. And the first season was boring imo, and Steve was the antagonist WHY WAS STEVE THE ANTAGONIST *SAD*
---
The match was already won and this person could have just hooked Steve and then closed the hatch  if they just wanted the extra points for doing so. But they chose to drop him and close it in his face, _he had a key,_ instant karma. These days I care much more about providing a fun, challenging and intense match for survivors and hardly give a shit about winning. I wish more killers went this route, as things are less sweaty, less seemingly toxic and if you care about BP more rewarding. A quick 4K doesn‚Äôt really benefit anyone and doing things like this as a Killer usually backfire and end up making you look like a dumbass. GG‚Äôs and lovemail beat hatemail every time.
---
So you've been playing with at least five people? :p
---
funny thing is that pig with or without add ons is almost the same because her add ons are complete garbage :(, pls add or improve pig add ons bhvr
---
(obviously there are good add ons like last will, tampered timer etc but a lot of them are terrible)
---
They tend to be the types of players more focused on winning and not actually being good/ getting better at the game
---
Really good killers have manners because there's not much fun bullying people with under 50 hours in the game and a tough match is usually fun for both sides (barring something like haddonfield offering + 4 balanced landings and insta-medis)
---
It just slides right.
---
I agree but it‚Äôs usually the survivor getting put on blast for complaining in post game chat.
---
Bruce/ash is god tier - change my mind
---
Mmm yes Iron Will. Very counterplay it is.
---
Can't argue with that.. gaming is an industry, they do things to make money I get it since I'm very passionate to learn more about behind the scene. But what they don't see is how making people happier by listening to them, they will earn way more money
---
We have seen this from many other SH around the world for a long time. How a mod became an official original game by itself and grew making money but also providing a nice experience for everyone
---
The best course of action in my humble opinion is to make the game f2p. It will make people give it a try no matter what, taking in potential players that will play in a regular basis and pay for dlc, battle pass, cosmetic and so on. They already have the whole system structured like a f2p. Cosmetics, shop, dlc, battle pass that's coming, grind and so on
---
They'll make way more money, grow their SH even more, hire more people, making the game even better and having a huge snowball effect. After all, the core game it's a fraction of the price for everything else, perks and characters included (like you said in a previous video too, and I agree)
---
They are greedy, like any SH, but they should be smart about it too. Profit with improvements and giving people the opportunity to play the game freely, free weekends are not enough.
---
How micro transactions works is making you feel welcome playing for free so you won't even notice how much you really spend with few bucks you throw bit by bit through a long period of time.
---
LoL (league of legends) is the perfect example for this. At first they weren't a big SH, had a game based on DotA that was a mod of Warcraft. The game was unbalanced, broken and glitchy for pretty long time, how is it now? Now, by selling for few bucks cosmetics and stuff like that they are a multi billion company that's played world wide. DbD even sell characters and licenses that is attractive to people who loves the movies or just heard of them
---
That's my reasons why I think going f2p would be the best course of action. Would still kinda suck to have so many paywalls but many people would actually come, check it out and even if not everyone would stick playing it, many others will.
---
Sorry for the long post but that's something I thought about when I've seen the battle pass and watched your videos
---
No way, Myers is probably the most well balanced killer in the game.
---
Tuft of hair is a little OP, but generally he's right in that sweet spot.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
He‚Äôd probably be terrible to play as cause you‚Äôre so short you can‚Äôt even tell if people are on the other side of windows or walls. You get a corn map and that‚Äôs basically it. Also a map like Lery‚Äôs would be absolute ass to play as something that short.
---
No, You're just booty.
---
No but yeah beyond that I still think it sounds rad. Thanks for this content. 
---
Do you have plans to do anymore? So far I've seen people make Spirit and Ghostface chase themes and at first I thought it was just one guy doing these but it turns out there's more than one talented fan out here.
---
Yeah I agree he‚Äôs be terrible to play as, but to play against and all you see is this tiny doll sprinting at you would be scary af, would be such a fun game
---
I hate anyone who plays the hag honestly. Like go take a bath you witchy hoe.
---
Found the killer main...
---
Btw don't say "KilLeRs hAvE lEsS rEaSoNs To Dc" both sides have to Just play the game if there's not a hacker or some stuff in game
---
As a spirit main, no. Not all of us belong to that group of creeps that think they're the best and get cocky because she's actually a good killer. I always give the hatch or gate to the last player UNLESS the survivor acts toxic during all game ^^
---
I'd love it, but that wouldn't be a good idea considering players come from all corners of the world, with different time zones.
---
Yeah there is a game in this big right now but now you can play pig for a bit
---
Little did they know, his power to out-teabag survivors was greater than any of theirs
---
Wow. Didn't expect that to help
---
Honestly I‚Äôm unsure if I will. I have ideas for hillbilly and nurse, but I‚Äôm debating when I should work on them. I made this because i saw the spirit theme and it inspired me to do one for wraith
---
As difficult as it sounds im a nice Spirit. Well if a team was absolutely shit anyway. However yes most of us are twats.
---
I would rather it's like your first game or something.
---
If it's happy hour, it's going to quickly turn into people who want to farm being upset at the people who just want to play a normal game.
---
Blendette vs blend-trap.
---
I understand that‚Äôs it‚Äôs op with the belt add ons but alone it isn‚Äôt that bad
---
Exhaustion Perk, DS, Adrenaline and BT/Alternate perk.
---
If someone makes an sfm animation
---
I will forward you [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dga2lo/absolutely_no_chill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) to my post on that, and laugh considering the reason I made this was to bait out the entitled survivor mains who this apparently deeply offends.
---
What does it do?
---
Can confirm. Rank 6 killer (playing WINDOWED on 0% resolution scale), and rank 10 survivor, even times playing both sides. It just fucking stings to press "Find match" as a killer, first game of the day, and get trampled because you get a corn map. Yikers, dude
---
Meg and Kate already got some few weeks ago and Feng will get her gamer skin soon.
---
Yeah, thanks to the fact that generators get completed ridiculously fast nowadays, all killers need to bring Hex: Ruin if they even want a chance at enjoying themselves. You‚Äôll run into them a lot, especially in the higher ranks. My tip would be to follow the Killer (At a safe distance) and see if they look in any bizarre directions, they might be checking their Ruin totem for cleansers. If you don‚Äôt want to do that, then simply search for the totem or power through the Hex skill checks. You can generally get around 2 gens done if you and your team rush them fast enough.
---
thats not only goth...
---
Honest question: how the fuck can anyone be a killer main nowadays with how often the queue times are unbearable?
---
I was the same way dude. When everyone was hyping it up i knew if i watched it it wouldn‚Äôt be as good as i would have wanted it to be, so i waited for hype to die down and started watching it.
---
Wait wait wait. People complain about head on? A meme perk? And DS git reworked aswell. It's a bit cringe to complain about body blocking and flashlights in 2019.
---
Or tombstone/infinite tier 3 myers
---
&gt;Well if you used that brain of you yours you would realise there are multiple out comes,
---
If you had common sense you would realize why this is a estimate out of theory for this same reason.
---
Because going against iridescent head is the worst thing to go against
---
I miss cute killers like that
---
But it wouldn't be 'happy' though.
---
I dont mind ruin unless its on killers that really dont need it. Ruin on Nurse for example is completly overkill and is really hard to win against.
---
It would make double bp events so much less meaningful
---
Adrenaline procs at endgame, she shut the hatch - therefore endgames started.
---
I have a tendency to let 1 or 2 survivors go if they have a DC and are doing bad.  If they're kicking my butt as a 3 man team, I don't mind going for a 3k.
---
I know, it's a bit of a running gag though.
---
Plus she could use even more, our little oink girl
---
this happens to me all the time on ps4 - running and crouching are really close to each other on the gamepad. And I hate it when it happens xD
---
&gt;Yea but developers consider face camping as game strategy.
---
I know, but the creators of the term gif also consider pronounciation to be jif. Only cause they created it doesnt make them right.

Oh, I thought it was only when the gates get powered. So the hatch opened once for him being the last one alive, she shut it, Adrenaline procced and he reopenes it with the key?
---
What? First.. are you smelling burnt toast? Second.. I‚Äôm in NO way saying DC‚Äôing is ok. How on earth did you figure that?
---
People say that if you dead hard before the killer swings its fine but when you dead hard while the killer swings it doesnt work and you get exhausted. Personally i dont use dead hard anyway because everytime i want to use it i just lag on the ground and dont get a dead hard because there is always a delay
---
I love it. Where do I get it?
---
Doctor has cool prestige, trapper, wraith and Myers also have cool bloody clothes
---
Dead Hard is essentially useless to begin with. I can say that, as a Killer, it's annoying for the five extra seconds it takes to down them anyway.
---
They are testing them right now
---
DbD is a 4v1 game where the killer has to kill 4 survivors.
---
He was the last survivor, All she had to do was put him on the hook. Instead she dropped him to close the hatch (Last chance escape) in his face but didn't realize his perks and items would allow him to escape because of that.
---
Essentially she tried to be a dick and it failed.
---
He's fine
---
She dislikes horror games...She playing the legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy but NEVER play scary games.
---
Watched tru3talent only use IRI heads and no perks, all 4 survivors disconnected LUL
---
The hour before shrine changes
---
Yup exactly.
---
Yeah I know what you mean. It just seems like with this recent patch there are 0 i-frames. Before I could consistently use it to dodge through the swipe. If I try at all currently I get hit no matter the timing.
---
&gt; Also what's a front pager
---
I think it's someone who just uses /r/All so doesn't really play DbD or post here. They just see all of the most upvoted posts on reddit.
---
It's such a small amount it's not even funny.
---
And killer mains wonder why "we are toxic"
---
The dedicated servers are fine for me. I‚Äôve only had one bs moment when I should‚Äôve hit, but survivors have probably had hundreds of bs hits so
---
Head on just better
---
Dead hard has the potential to save your life, for example, you're about to go down and you didn't reach the pallet?, the only thing that matters is what you do after you dead hard, if you can't do anything then they'll just knock you down, but if you can get to a strong loop then..
---
No killer is bad fuck what people say. People say clown is m1 killer but im in red ranks playing casually.
---
Ghostface is strong after a few games of getting used to him and VERY fun
---
 
---
Its a game. Fuck tier list. Play fun
---
Why is he being attested ü§î
---
What's wrong with the hag!
---
So does everyone with fave characters.  You need to wait your turn just like everyone else.
---
God I love that description
---
Dead Hard is easily one of the strongest if not the strongest exhaustion perk in the game. It allows you to recover from a mistake be it dodging a swipe or narrowly making a pallet.
---
Truth is BAN system is long overdue..., as soon as dedicated servers are fully implemented they should put at least temp ban system in!
---
I thought the title said "when survivors are taking a shit" and I was excited
---
There are literally tutorials on how to lagswitch... it‚Äôs a problem and that‚Äôs why I hope as a survivor main dedicated survivors will come ASAP.
---
&gt;if you‚Äôre as good as you say
---
&gt;and I suck so
---
Pick one
---
Claudette for most useful.
---
I can hear monto saying ‚Äúhe had a key! He had a fuckin key!‚Äù
---
Yup, console. Yeah whoever does that is really upset I‚Äôm guessing. It‚Äôs a shame really.
---
I remember being in a private lobby with my friends and i was the killer for the first time and for my offering i read the mori description and i‚Äôm like ‚Äúi gotta run this‚Äù and when my friends saw the hidden offering they all started yelling ‚ÄúOH MY GOD SHES RUNNING MORI‚Äù
---
In my opinion the need a 2 v 10 with the objective to have your team alive for 20/25 minutes
---
You can only reliably hit multiple Survivors with one Frenzy if they are clustered together. Outside of this, Legion has nothing to help in a chase. 
---
Also, as of patch 3.3.0, healing will not take too long.
---
Plague, for example, can easily break people and knock them down in mere moments.
---
Isn't this from the teacher killer?
---
She could definitely use more, just a lot of people don‚Äôt realize she was buffed
---
What are they doing to healing?
---
I felt like i was in heaven watching this video, thank you
---
Using the perk to avoid a hit is bad, since most of the time you still get hit and exhausted. Dead Hard to get distance to windows/pallets is pretty much how you use it efficiently.
---
I hate being called toxic, it‚Äôs called getting 4ks
---
But what‚Äôs wrong with her?
---
Dumb question, what is face camping? Also do you mean nodding yes after you down someone?
---
You dc against OoO?? So is it fair for survs to dc against perks they dont like?
---
People should only dc if they are glitched and cant get out or the game is being held hostage
---
A lot of killers definitely struggle when it comes to dealing with high ranked optimal survivors. When it comes to m1 killers like ghostface, there is only so much you can do. It depends on the survivors making mistakes rather than you playing at peak performance. Clown isn't the worst as he can end loops faster, but he severely lacks in map pressure. If survivors are playing smart and continue to to gens, they get done fast. This will hurt him more on larger maps.
---
That‚Äôs the reason you hook the survivor BEFORE trolling.
---
High ranks, he is good AF
---
Kate, and I‚Äôm not being biased or anything
---
laughs in 5 totem prayer beads + speed Spirit
---
Fuck killer DCers in particular, survivors lose BP cause of it
---
Agreed, but it'll still be useful against killers like nurse or tier 2 myers.
---
I, a Spirit main, would like to apologize for the behaviour of that fellow Spirit.
---
Hahaha genius
---
Mhhh I love sonic happy hour so this one must be good too
---
This post is confusing and makes no sense.
---
Ie 
---
&gt; vs just killing the person and having an 100% decrease in Survivor actions
---
People who tunnel one person down generally aren't against good survs because good survs will knockout the gens in mere minutes. 
---
&gt;You can say the same thing about Survivors; it's more beneficial to them to blind you at pallets
---
It's usually not.
---
&gt;Survivors aren't doing anything wrong with body blocking a Killer to prevent a chase from happening. That's just how the game works. Survivors aren't trying to play fair, they're trying to survive.
---
Bodyblocking is fair, killers can and will do it aswel. 
---
&gt;B) Sacrifice every survivor....  all of which is greatly helped by a survivor not being there (Can't work on gens, is already sacrificed, can't do anything while you're chasing, can't heal).
---
Yeah having 3 survs alive on first hook when the last gen is done is really not helping you sacrifice every survivor. It's basically survivor win at that point.
---
Yeah, I know that much. It just seems like the perk isn't giving any i-frames. You still get the small boost, but I guarantee if you try to do it through a swing you'll get downed as though you never activated it.
---
Both sides loose BP and pips when people Dc..
---
I spoofed mine and I still have it
---
No I just got the game 3 weeks ago
---
Focusing on one person. Viable strategy since killing a survivor fast makes you more likely to win, but generally accepted as a dick move.
---
üôå
---
Adams prestige trench coat is pretty cool
---
Some guy ran an independent poll, and micheal came up as the killer people enjoy playing with the most.
---
As it always well be
---
There‚Äôs a difference between playing a character as they were created to be played, and being a toxic piece of shit. Like for example, the spirit could have just hooked him and got the hatch after for those sweet bloodpoints, but no, they had to be a total douche about it
---
Between eyebrows and the alien mask the only good one is the original and the 2018 one.
---
Or, y'know, don't troll
---
Would fuck all fps also be a good reason
---
Survivor: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get away from this!‚Äù 
---
Legion: ‚ÄúOh no you fuckin don‚Äôt.‚Äù
---
Hatch King
---
It's not. She was going to kill me, you can tell by the swing and insta DC
---
A Spirit did this exact same thing to me the other day. I sadly had no counters.
---
has always been like that. Blinding him while picking up doesnt do anything either (it blinds but doesnt drop). Its to protect the killer as they are stuck in the animation and dont have any counterplay to it
---
Who tf teabags at like the most unsafe pallet in the game.
---
Hol' up I made it to /r/all?
---
God I hope the swamp map is the one getting a rework. One of the few maps where my gameplay is significantly worse
---
Jumpscare Myers
---
? I used Adrenaline after he closed to hatch, and used it to use my key and open the hatch after he closed it, which he wasn't expecting
---
hahaha
---
dude NOED is so annoying to go against, but when ur the killer and get sick of toxic survivors' shit, that a fucking party
---
Yes but, it is very easy to get your item back, it is just very annoying to have to keep going back and getting it. It is pretty worthless considering it never really changes how a match ends.
---
After seeing several posts related to feet I'm starting to believe it might've been a mistake to join this subreddit
---
I can literally earn more BP going afk and standing in one spot as survivor than 90% of the matches someone playing Huntress with Iri can. You‚Äôre also making the blind assumption that all the survivors are going to play a 4v1 game with only 3 people from the start. As much as I would agree they should.. they don‚Äôt.. like I said. They expect to be treated nicely or else they leave. So sure the killer gets a few BP.. AND deranked. Big whoop. It‚Äôs far more common to have a whole team DC if one or more leave because nobody‚Äôs gonna play that shit. It always chains.
---
Scarecrow ghostface.
---
Stand in a corn field, completely immobile. If anyone looks at you, chase him into obliviob.
---
Hex: Sike
---
You are filled with fury to get things your way
---
Putting survivors on the floor in front of the hatch gives a 10% movement speed for being an asshole. Survivors who have adrenaline and a key and escape get to be toxic back.
---
Hex: sike stacks with all perks.
---
True xd
---
Myers's P3 mask. Not the outfit or the weapon, just the mask.
---
You see it‚Äôs you salty little narcs that are the problem. Also it doesn‚Äôt matter if you report me as I just filter numbers into any abusive or swear words in my messages.
---
System doesn‚Äôt pick them up, I don‚Äôt get comms banned and I get to send all the hate i want.
---
More people need to realise that putting a number in an offensive word etc. Beats the auto-detection system and there‚Äôs no chance an actual mod is going to sift through messages of a little crybaby who plays online games and can‚Äôt take a bit of hatemail and banter.
---
Grow a spine, grow some damn balls and just either ignore it or stop playing games. Rather than being a pansy

congrats, I made it to rank 1 for my first time 2 weeks ago

It's always a nice feeling to tombstone the tbagger in the gate

I did just fine back when I mained him for a short while. Maybe just learn to play stealthier? Idk what to tell you honestly. But I do know his stalking is extremely strong if you know how to use it

---
Fuck all these toxic players man, idk why we can't just have a game and not have someone with a stick up their ass to go and piss someone else off because someone pissed in their cheerios that morning.
---
You are the salty one for getting mad at a game to the point of harrasing other people, and there is a report system for a reason. If you get banned is, you gotta deal with it because it's your fault.
---
Sorry if it's sarcasm
---
They can‚Äôt do the thing that happens when you‚Äôre working on a gen/unhooking you where they just pick you up???
---
I always bring Dead Hard, it saved my ass so many times in this kind of situation.
---
The report system doesn‚Äôt work well. It‚Äôs almost all automatic and the like so if a person starts putting numbers in or misspelling etc. The system won‚Äôt pick it up and you‚Äôll get a flag on your profile for false reporting.
---
So I‚Äôd be careful doing it in future as if there‚Äôs a number in that swear and you reported they Class it as a false report on Xbox at least
---
Meeting will now come to order!

I dc as a killer if one survivor dc‚Äôs early.

Buffing med-kits, to balance out the insta-heal nerf.
---
Don't forget how good Inner Strength is.
---
I'd guess you are either got downvoted cause people didn't read the whole comment, or they downvoted because you are fighting tbag with bm. in other words, fire with fire
---
Far too often, even when it‚Äôs blatantly obvious to the other 3 I‚Äôm playing for fun.
---
if you stop for a second and then keep going he'll just hit you, pro gamer move
---
Okay gotcha
---
this sign wont stop me because I cant read
---
What if they changed iri head so you need to be a certain distance for it to down someone. This way you can't get use them up close.
---
4%
---
you're still spending additional time doing that instead of something else. a lot of killer perks work this way. Make survivors spend more time doing something else.
---
Some people MUST go back and get that item, so it also helps with locating where they might be later on in the game.
---
Is shoeless Myers okay?
---
There's the chances
---
I miss old Freddy he was so much more fun to play, from what I‚Äôve seen the only people that wanted the Freddy rework where people who dident use freddy
---
A new freddy cosmetic? Cool.
---
Nah, I'll stick to saying cunt and bitch and what not
---
i‚Äôm more of a fan of vanilla shakes
---
wow how did he fuck that up so bad XD
---
No, god please no, only not this cursed look from new nightmare, this...this was so out of character, oh my god

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dgeq4h/sorry_if_its_been_shared_already/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
its always the worst survivors who are toxic
---
You make me laugh lol show me your killer rank.
---
That just means that your in-game communication can be monitored. So just DbD's own post-game (and so on) chat, since, obviously, that needs to go through their servers to work.
---
5 totem + prayer beads is a million times more fun than basic huntress for me so yeah..
---
I'm literally rank 11 and haven't used him in about a month
---
Yeah the movie sucked I can't lie but this outfit is sick. They can take inspiration from it and keep butthole eyes Freddy we have now.
---
Wait wait wait.... Is this a Chucky leak.????!!!! Hhhhhhmmmm
---
You.. I like you
---
I don‚Äôt understand how survivors can bm after they lose. Like if you lose, you really have no counter to ‚Äúbut you lost.‚Äù I can understand if you were tunneled the whole game and escaped, you could have something to say.
---
Oh, rank 11 you face weak survivors, that's why you did well....
---
I wasn't playing before the Freddy rework so unfortunately I can't really talk on that but I mostly use Freddy because he's my favourite horror character.
---
Your approach and advice seem on point.  Focusing on killers makes more sense as survivors are only skins.  
---
My wild guess for max P3 50 would have been around 3k hours...which is why I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone that has to ask.  
---
There are a few reasons I‚Äôd consider prestiging at this point.
---
* They release a new character that becomes a main.
---
* They add more prestige‚Äôs and/or offer new rewards for prestiging
---
* They allow you to apply prestige blood to all cosmetics
---
"Turn on the patio lights, again"
---
Yes plz
---
Well no because I'm still going against rank 6-8. And judging by the way you ranted about addons. You really don't know how to effectively use his ability
---
I'll just stick to calling them by that character's gender. It's easier like that and now I'm getting pissed at the character, rather than the player
---
It was really walking directly up to a survivor and they had no idea
---
nice idea to use him as a killer
---
Anyone can be a cunt

The tombstone part always has me dying.
---
I don‚Äôt know if the design is yours, but it would be awesome to have a killer like that. Reminds of the original killers design.
---
Wait, you're not Jon Rob. Lmao, anyway that was pretty damn good. Killers POV was fire and would love to here that in game since I main Wraith
---
Yeah, my point is that a lot of the time survivors DC for much more lackluster reasons than killers. With the ruin thing too, you run the risk of having it found and destroyed, but it becomes ridiculous when the survivor finds it in 30 secs because it's in the worst totem spot in the game, or they spawned right next to it, it's not really fair
---
I always just play it out. You have to keep missing as nurse to learn how to blink.
---
This was yesterday afternoon
---
Probably guilt. She stains other clothes a lot.
---
Your friend made a new circus freaks lore.
---
Smartasses get killed we see to that
---
On plebs "main" 1 side.
---
We don't know for certain whether or not the person playing the character is male/female or other, but we do know the character's gender (or at least their pronouns).
---
I always go with the gender or the character.
---
What‚Äôs your rank/platform?  How many hours?  Who are your mains?  What‚Äôs your playtime (rough estimate) for huntress?
---
These discussions need more info to understand the communities viewpoints.
---
I don't think that's a good idea, the counterplay would be comming closer to the killer
---
It would also feel bullshit near the edge of that distance.
---
I'd rather go with penetrating hatchets something like that. Or just make iri head a purple add-on that would apply deep wound to healthy survivors (but still down injured/deep-wounded targets) and give her other ultra rares all together.
---
I just think it's silly and overdone. Killers always making memes like they're more resilient than the US military cuz a survivor t-bagged.
---
Yup, can‚Äôt listen to reason so you‚Äôre just gonna ignore the facts and disregard that the stats don‚Äôt agree with you.     
---
    
---
Btw.. my flair is that because I‚Äôm the person who created the [Shirtless Clown Meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b89pfn/shirtless_myers_is_overrated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Don't throw pallets the way you currently do and you'll find huntress more fun to play against
---
When you think you have to throw the pallet down, do another loop
---
Tell us more about your superior mental fortitude, child insulting strangers online.
---
Spirit is one of the few characters that actually has control of the game 90% of the time ( like the killer should be, power role) and they hate it.
---
I get it bro. I'm trying to learn her before the rework, but it can be brutal.  You got this. Missing is part of the game, and you'll get better.
---
I do it with toxic people, I‚Äôll be honest. if they were teabagging or som‚Äôn, but I get them down last, I‚Äôll act like I‚Äôm taking them to the hatch, then close it right in front of them and hook them. they‚Äôll ask me why I was toxic and why I did that, but...
---
PC has its own stuff too. I was dumbfounded to see how many people actually go search through my profile just to get to me. One game I had a dude start shitting on me because of where I was from, other game a dude literally started calling me my real first name to get to me and insult me. I had that stuff in my Steam profile (nothing overly personal, just first name and country) and they literally had to go search through my profile just to be able to have something to insult me with.
---
Crazy.
---
I‚Äôve taken weeks/months off at a time.  I‚Äôm almost always pulled back in by an event/chapter.
---
I became frustrated with survivor so I started playing killer for BP and ended up being a killer main.  Switching sides can refresh the game.
---
You don‚Äôt have actual stats you just have your own assumptions. Sorry I‚Äôve never saw that meme and I‚Äôm on mobile so I can‚Äôt see the picture on the flair
---
If you plan on buying all the dlc it doesn‚Äôt really master but if you don‚Äôt by licend character because you can‚Äôt unlock them with shard and letherface is a good pick gift his perks he is self not that great.
---
And that's gonna cause a couple DC's for sure
---
Hag and spirit I already bought clown and plague because they don‚Äôt have nice skins
---
After thousands of hours I have more than enough of my own experience to comment on the statistics of these things. And I‚Äôm also on mobile.. It took me 2 seconds to see you have a default brown profile picture. Have a good one.
---
My go to for around rank 12 killer is using freddy with his swing chains, and paintbrush with thanataphobia, bbq, ruin, blood warden. I catch a DC every single time
---
Really, there are no ‚Äúbest‚Äù ones, just depends on how you play. However, leather face and Myers have certain perks that are very good, and Freddy is an all around good killer. Pig has 2 good, not the best perks, legion‚Äôs only redeeming quality is in the shrine of secrets, ghost face is situational, demo has a good stealth perk and ok power, plague has a 2 good perks and a situational one, with a good power.
---
I like huntress the most
---
Is this taking place in some backward-ass country where being attracted to another guy is a crime or something?
---
Not a Choose Your Story version!? ReeEEeeEeEe!
---
He‚Äôs right behind you Jamie!
---
i mean that is how the entity feasts, harvesting a bit of their soul whenever a survivor is sacrificed
---
I find this especially funny because we recently dissected pig fetuses and I got paired with 3 squimish girls so I got to do literally all of the dissecting. Good times.
---
Bonus points if it includes "pretty good job so far".
---
The plague
---
I agree she needs more love, some people love the piggy even though is not easy to play her.
---
I‚Äôm not using it to act superior, that‚Äôs a pretty vain conclusion to have. I‚Äôm using it to point out I have more than enough experience in the game to contrast my own stats against the stats of other players with lengthy time in the game which allows me to come to my conclusions. I‚Äôm complaining that both sides DC for stupid reasons and poking more fun at the survivors doing so. Difference is I‚Äôm not being attacked by ‚Äúkiller mains‚Äù for pointing out they DC for stupid shit. Yet entitled survivor mains think they‚Äôre in the right for doing so.. which is part of the reason I made this meme exactly like this. Everything on this list effects the survivors actually playing the game more than anyone else. The only people who can‚Äôt see that are the type to easily get offended and those who often DC. It draws people like you out, and show their hypocrisy.
---
As others have already said, I think the bell in the chase version is a little bit annoying, but other than that this is awesome!
---
Ill take ANY Freddy cosmetics at this point...
---
*new update
---
I don't stalk too often and honestly use night shroud to either get a cheeky hit or to track survivors that look at me
---
You do know that julie is like 15/16ish right? But if pedophilia is your thing then hey do your thing.
---
Sexeh*
---
What about no
---
lol each person is going to have their own opinion on teabagging. at the end of the day, teabagging is a sign of disrespect. game or not, they should have just left. anytime I use DS, I am immediately tunneled and camped until death, so the fact that she made it to the gate and got away was good enough. no need to teabag at the gate. I get survivors that will drop a pallet in front of me, not even stun me and then start teabagging. I will never understand. lmao.
---
That's some next level ownage. I had to watch this several times to really appreciate the badassery that I was seeing.
---
You know that all the characters on DBD have been confirmed to be all over 18+ by the devs right?
---
How dare you rob them of their WGLF stack /s
---
I respectfully disagree
---
nurse still is extremely powerful and now has some amazing addons- while omega blink and five blink nurse are both gone, she still can‚Äôt be looped and jungle gyms can‚Äôt be used against her... while spirit is very very good, she can be looped and nurse can‚Äôt
---
Literally only dc because my internet cuts out, something that I have zero control over but ok.
---
5% is nothing so the perk is useless. I thought of a rework for hope:when injured you run 9/8/10% faster but you bleed 5/10/15% more
---
You know that she is 19, I am a Girl and 20 so yeah still a snack for me
---
I remember being asked to dissect shit. I literally vomited, I had to be excused every time we did it.
---
Y'all like to keep pretending that some of these characters are under 18, but the devs have actually been pretty specific that that is not the case. Spirit is probably the craziest example. Her backstory specifically lists her as a university student, which very likely puts her in her early 20s, 19 at least, but I constantly see people claiming she's like 14-16.
---
It was clear she was just trying to get late hook bonus. Just going by this clip alone that is. If she bmd the rest of the game that‚Äôs different
---
Myers and Legion were the two that clicked for me.
---
Hex: Paranoia looks like it would be so fucking annoying... I love it
---
See what I mean, I didn‚Äôt say you were DC‚Äôing.. I said you were being hypocritical and blind. You‚Äôre the one who made a false assumption and took what I said personally. Not to mention you said you were done with this a few posts back and for whatever reason still feel justified in trying to hammer your point in.     
---
If you don‚Äôt agree with my post.. cool. You do you. Stop commenting.
---
You're applying logic. Against these people is ineffective
---
I fucking loved that Steve bit at the end. Very clever
---
Provide proof or you're a pedo. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The only part of legion that's confirmed 19 is Frank. According to the lore.
---
Nurse is exactly the same more or less if you didnt use addons, shes always going to be the best killer by far given that she ignores everything. Still cant do anymore to her without deleting her
---
DC‚Äôing is honestly pathetic on either side and believe me killers do it all too often
---
Considering the new Myers cosmetic coming out, They don't have much of a problem with shoeless (or pantless) Myers. Just Shirtless Myers, presumably because they are predijuce against Shirtless fans.
---
Ochido fanboys back at it again
---
Very competive and competent hitboxes. You should try playing shooters now.
---
Please google the word pedophilia instead of using false claims
---
A \*garbage\* perk
---
And here we are next post about survs bad killer good
---
Yeah I am a bisexual paedophile you are totally right
---
I gotta disagree. The old Freddy was more fun especially when people would disrespect and you would pull them off a gen. And you basically just proved his point. The only people who wanted the rework are the people who didn‚Äôt really use him. ‚ÄúThe new Freddy, is my main‚Äù, I hate fake Freddy mains. He‚Äôs been my main before and after rework but I do wish they just shorten the timer to fall asleep rather than an entire power rework.
---
And I oop
---
I smell feminazi.
---
I.. made.. a.. MEME. If YOU are not able to not be offended by a MEME I hate to say it.. life is going to be hard for you. Go take a nap kiddo.

lmao why is it always spirits, one game my teammates died and i collected a key from one of them (he killed himself in the basement and i got his key)
---
The spirit downed me infront of the hatch closed it and kept following me shaking her head "no". I got to the hatch opened it and left lol
---
It‚Äôs your fault for listening to a toxic shithead and letting it get to you. 
---
I suck at killer. And I keep at it. Because I found my jam (stealth killers, esp Ghostface). It gets to me at times. But you can‚Äôt let it get in your head and make you doubt. 
---
Find what‚Äôs fun. Everything else is practice.
---
sksksksksksk
---
I'm still pretty new only 12 hours played. I have seen the secret door perk, but how did he get get up from being downed to jump through it?
---
Thanks, Trapper.
---
They won't. People don't DC for inner strength. People DC for spirit, iri heads huntress, nurse and so on
---
Only when this happens they nerf. Just look at Freddy when was released

Here you go bro

&gt;Provides no evidence their own claim
---
I honestly don't give a shit about which one of you is right, but you realize you're being hypocritical, right?
---
People still play nurse? I'm rank 7 and I haven't see a single nurse. It's only camping ghostfaces, trappers, Michaels and spirits
---
As a survivor main; it‚Äôs infuriating when some dc‚Äôs. Like dude it‚Äôs DBD; its a casual game. How do you rage quit that?
---
I... did actually use him, I used him more than enough to understand him, but he simply wasnt fun. Sure if you were fighting cheeky folks, or low ranks, but if you were playing against people who actually knew how to play the game? It was a mess, and worse than that? It was a mess that simply took longer than a normal game.
---
Good huntresses will predict that in higher level games and walk straight through
---
I like both tbh
---
I feel you about ‚Äúno one shut up about it so I hate it‚Äù. This is why I‚Äôve not done anything Pokemon or Harry Potter, the massive attention ruined it for me.
---
Happens to me a lot since I'm a Michael main. People throw down the pallet and when they see me not moving, just start to T-bag and stands still. Guess they don't ever realise I'm stalking them
---
I don't even know what your going on about but if it's to tell me im wrong don't bother because
---
Lol no
---
I love how she saw the adrenaline and was like FUCK and tried to save it
---
Oooh I've always just called it bad manners but I love "bitch move."
---
I like the power, kinda like a mix of clowns bottles and shock therapy
---
4v1 so what? Proportionally killers DC just as much - the absolute number of DC‚Äôs if of course irrelevant 
---
Survivors DC‚Äôing always hurts their team more than the killer. In fact the killer doesn‚Äôt lose anything at all from it
---
I always equip either a brown me skit or toolbox cause it‚Äôs in my inventory and there‚Äôs no point in not using them
---
As an ace main i dream about this every night hoping it will come
---
So you complain about toxicity, yet you call this person trash and call their gameplay sad? Makes sense.
---
Not hypocritical at all. It's in the lore that the dev's made and the lore puts her at 15/16ish years of age you sick fuck. The only one confirmed as 19 is Frank. 
---
Y'all just want her to be an age that she isn't just so you don't feel bad for being a sick perverted fuck for being attracted to anyone below the age of 18.
---
Friendship scrunchies?
---
Technician + this perk would be a pretty cool combination for a match
---
I'm not 21 still underaged as well ;)
---
I‚Äôm not raging at you lmfao!! I‚Äôm literally mocking how childish you are. Don‚Äôt be so offended. You sound like the type of kid who gets upset when their mom asks them to take the trash out. Trying to act like you can say whatever you want on someone‚Äôs post and expect them not to respond is pretty damn juvenile. Sure I‚Äôm dipping my toe in that water by even trying to explain that too you.. but again.. it‚Äôs my post. And you haven‚Äôt went and taken your nap yet.
---
Thats it
---
And when you know the huntress will walk through, you throw it. Which she then adapts to. And you adapt to her adapting. There, a real mindgame which is fun for both sides.
---
What do you mean ‚Äúreal‚Äù mind game?
---
Look man I play killers who are completely fucking crippled by OoO. There's a difference between not liking a perk and being completely unable to play the game properly. Trapper and Ghostface become completely impossible and I'm not going to play that, I'm sorry but I'm not sorry, I'd rather play a game I have a chance of winning.
---
sometimes i just put on a brown medkit so i have the opportunity to fully heal once- and if i die with it i won‚Äôt care at all
---
Please don't say Spirit can be looped in this Subreddit.
---
1. She can't be strictly looped, only really mindgamed and LoS'd.
---
2. Saying a "counter" to Spirit is precisely blasphemy as well because this Subreddit believes Spirit cannot be countered/counterplayed. You're setting youeself up for something ugly.
---
3. Nurse is not constantly on your ass anymore, while Spirit pretty much is, that accounts for a lot. 
---
Spirit is better than Nurse now. Nurse isn't as dead as people think, but Spirit is now above her.
---
It also had a bit of inspiration of Freddy‚Äôs old power with the speed reduction.
---
... Logically speaking, Killers can‚Äôt because there is always more survivors in matches at any given time than there is killers. Its not proportional in the slightest. It‚Äôs literally basic math.
---
This is why I‚Äôm saving them up until they find a way to punish disconnects.
---
Ignore him, his brain needs truly a replacement
---
Damn I never noticed that and thanks to you just looked it up.
---
I just always thought he would pull it out himself to go for a second stab.
---
I feel like DBD is at its golden moment right now. Definitely worth it.
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru!
---
Nani?!
---
I miss finger guns it's not repetitive and annoying like shirtless myers
---
Bruh they said it in one of there over 100 or so dev streams on youtube
---
Its hard to provide evidence since there are so many but i can assure you they have stated in one of their streams that all DBD chars are 18+
---
Indoor maps have a lot of loops with no ceilings on the middle objects
---
Clown Head and Body, Spirit weapon, Plague head and body, Jake headpiece
---
I did make her look a lot prettier than she actually is lol
---
Thank you!
---
As a spirit main I out of way not to hit the person off the hook but this also because I'm arrogant as spirit. I don't have to tunnel or camp because I'm still going to kill you all you have borrowed time or ds I would never find out. It's the good part of being arrogant and playing such a powerful killer.
---
yea but that is hardly enough to make the power useful. Don't get me wrong it sounds fun
---
Yet you insult me over things I can‚Äôt control, and continue to get annoyed at me over disagreeing with you. Seems pretty childish to me :/
---
Please stop messaging me it‚Äôs getting weird now
---
Low standards I see
---
it is worth buying the dlcs?
---
Why my pee-pee hard?
---
Paranoia and huntress lullaby is the meme build
---
*four toolboxes
---
Flashlights are just kind of annoying, but toolboxes will end the game before you can do anything at all
---
Yes, why do you think they play a killer whose only counterplay is to play as unfun as possible?
---
Honest suggestion: don't rely on Ruin. It's powerful if it works right but that's a big if at this point. Use a combination of Corrupt Intervention and Pop Goes the Weasel. If you're playing a killer who can hook someone early like Ghostface you might not even need Corrupt.
---
I feel like any time I bring in either a medkit or flashlight I get focused more certainly. Usually it is just a normal brown medkit too.
---
People need to get a grip about things that are in the game. If it exists, use it for all I care. Flashlights / instameds / Mori's / NOED. I hate the way everyone is always bitching at each other.
---
It is a game where you are meant to get hunted and killed. It is a game where you are meant to do everything in your power to stop that from happening.
---
Tbh if I feel like a killer / item is overpowered it just gives me a better sense of achievement when I do overcome it. 
---
There is a ridiculous amount of posts from killer mains acting like they are morally correct for deciding to tunnel or equip what they believe to be scummy loadouts just because they see a certain character or item in the lobby.
---
Seems to be good
---
&gt;  "gonna block me too pussy?" 
---
"Yep, bye."
---
Oof lol this is why I don't prestige I only go for teachables on every character and getting every perk
---
Rank 1 on PS4, with approx. 1300 hours. I don't main anyone, since I play Killers on a rotation.
---
No idea how much time I've put into Huntress specifically, but she and Nurse are my two least-played Killers. They are so weak on console that they are simply no fun to play as, against good SWF groups.
---
I got to red ranks every month with him and it was funny because everyone thought every Freddy had noed and bloodwarden so they would waste their time because I never ran noed. The mind game potential was fun as hell. I could use painkillers and have them think I was chasing them when I was pulling someone else in the dream and then go back to the first victim or I could run .5 seconds to throw off their counting and pull em off of gens/totems or I could predict where the survivor was going and be right there if front of him when he‚Äôs in the dream would and make him shit his pants. Clearly you didn‚Äôt spend enough time to understand him. You‚Äôre probably tunnel vision a survivor instead of juggling around to confuse em. That‚Äôs why I said ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt really use‚Äù never said you never did but you just never took the time. Now all freddys do in a chase in our 8 snares down during a loop around a pallet, that shits boring or just put up a shit ton of fake pallets, sure he‚Äôs strong now but he‚Äôs only strong because you don‚Äôt have to work hard anymore; everything is just handed to us now.
---
Should've added another with the car edited out and it shows that Legion has the ultra rare addon
---
It depends. If you want more content and enjoy more characters then yes. If that doesn‚Äôt interest you and just want their character perks there are a select few that are essential.
---
Well, the parts with Laurie are. I think the parts with Michael Myers are a parody if I'm not mistaken.
---
Then you drop it one loop earlier, so they can't get an easy shot OR go through, turn and once you notice them not raising the hatchet, step back and throw it down
---

People sometimes get confused as to what a mindgame is. I've been hearing a lot of people refer to Spirit standing still (faking phase) as a mindgame. Which it isn't, because there is no tell for the survivor and the Spirit doesn't do anything. Another example is small loops. This again isn't a mindgame, since there is a 100% correct way to play them for the killer and always get a hit (assuming a 4.6 m/s killer). The reason that I mentioned the huntress-survivor matchup around a pallet being a real mindgame is because both of them can outplay the other. Whoever fakes their ''tell'' the best (huntress trying to bait an early drop or no drop at all, survivor acting as if they're dropping but keep running or act as if they keep running but drop while the huntress is in the pallet) wins. Because the winner in this scenario depends on who played this small ''game'' the best, I would call it a real mindgame.
---
Ok boomer
---
Keys ruin almost every single match where they get used so it's a reasonable point to complain about, just not this particular instance.
---
Where is your proof?
---
there's a difference between banter and being a dick, though at times a small one, banter is fine but calling some a fcking cnt cause you found out there black, white, gay or straight after you got your ass beat in a game is the epitome of stupidity
---
I think you should look up the definition of a mind game.
---
This post is dumb as shit
---
I've honestly been running into a lot of hex users lately so small game has been a great friend
---
rip xxx
---
It shouldn't be up to them who they face?
---
If you have a problem with survivors being on the same team, or using flashlights, then take it up with the devs.
---
A lot of complaining about OP stuff and BM and dishonorubu play is trying to police how people play.
---
Welcome to the fog friend.
---
Everyone will love playing against him when he becomes pantless
---
Oh, you're one of the people who doesn't understand it. That's a shame.
---
its not garbage :(
---
I mean, if the hatch wasn't right there would you feel better cuz tats the only soul taking thing i see
---
Rank 12 spirit here. I would've just hooked or mori'd.
---
I‚Äôm so glad I don‚Äôt play like this unless everyone DCd and there‚Äôs one person left so I‚Äôll give them hatch.
---
Nah, the only thing that they said they'll never include in the game are small children. They never said anything about never including teenagers. Which is literally what they all are. It's right in the fucking lore. Read it.
---
Here's an excerpt straight from it.
---
It literally puts her around 15/16 while everyone else is 17/18.
---
Frank Morrison was nineteen and had little to show for it.
---
Frank attended the parties she threw where everyone was younger than him and easily impressed, which he liked. He met the impulsive Joey, who liked to show off, and the shy, na√Øve Susie, who was Julie's best friend.
---
Never considered that, but hey, at least it‚Äôd give some good use to Beast of Prey.
---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what ‚Äúmind game‚Äù means.
---
whose dick I need to suck to make ruin last for 2 mins?? mine gets cleansed in the first 20 seconds
---
You can‚Äôt control yourself from posting on someone else‚Äôs thread? That‚Äôs concerning. And your bad attempts at spinning this and grasping you‚Äôre the one doing this to yourself is hilarious. I‚Äôm loving this tbh, it‚Äôs not too often I get people as stupid as you commenting. Just stop posting on other people‚Äôs posts dude. That simple. If this was me being an idiot on someone else‚Äôs post I woulda bowed out by now. Wisdom comes with age though doesn‚Äôt it..
---
I‚Äôm piggy?
---
i just said "no"
---
oh that one was awful and you know it.
---
Kids as defined as 12 and under. Legion is teenagers. Read the lore dumbfuck.
---
It's literally in the game dumbass.
---
Might wanna actually try to explain your point rather than repeating yourself.
---
Pedophilia is the attraction to children BEFORE puberty. Im not defending pedophilia, im just stating a fact. Whether it's morally ok to do it with an underage or not is another topic.
---
You changed the subject.. but my fault I guess. You can‚Äôt grasp math.. but my fault I guess. You keep responding after saying long ago that you were gonna ignore ANY reply you got.. Definitely my fault cuz I clearly got under your skin. Worth it lol. I‚Äôm feeling to turn on an auto reply prog and just hit you with a ‚Äú...‚Äù to every one of your responses seeing as I‚Äôm getting bored of this and you‚Äôre too brain dead to realize you‚Äôre still causing this on yourself.
---
Literally spirit pretending to phase is a mind game, spirit acting like she is going to vault then phasing is a mind game, small loops are essential mind games. 
---
Deciding whether to drop the pallet or do another loop also a mind game, but just as much as the others.
---
On the other side, theres killers that tunnel and camp which is so very toxic. At the end they just say ‚Äúohh thats the salt I was looking for. GG Ez shot survivor‚Äù It goes both ways pal. Some killers are just such fucking scums
---
Also don‚Äôt be disheartened just because you  get tbagged. Almost every killer does. Essentially punish them if they tbag at pallets bc they are wasting time that you can use to lose ground.
---
Someone please tell me we‚Äôre in that lore does it say underage ...

Haha ya but I couldn‚Äôt help it
---
YOU aren‚Äôt understanding. These ‚Äúmasses‚Äù are the ones who didn‚Äôt really use him. That‚Äôs the point that this guy was making. They would use him 3-5 times at red ranks and just call him shit and say he needs a rework. But I‚Äôm not the only one who liked old Freddy so don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù when you literally commented on a guy saying he liked old Freddy before me.
---
The best solution imo is cool downs for leavers increasing for each time they leave a game within a certain time after
---
All you‚Äôre doing is breaking subreddit rules by being uncivil...
---
i legit hate this game and love it at the same time like why am i still playing this shit oh i know it's addictive.
---
7% actually
---
They literally just got buffed

Gonna get downvoted, but who cares. The same killer playing Noed, Ruin, Pop and BBQ? Because that is really what a toxic killer does.

You can only acquire it through the season pass I believe.

Unfortunately I am what you would term a "pussy" and would probably be silent if an alligator was devouring my legs to avoid being disruptive

Good idea. Too many people hate me for being Claudette :(
---
play trapper much?
---
you better BELIEVE im gettin that im trying to play a nurse not main her just play her here and there y'know?
---
I just dced for the first time in months cause I didnt wanna be left on the ground so the killer could try for a 4k
---
Ive been running into those every single game, i jsut do swf and bring a rainbow map. I literally run around the map, cleanse totems and all their totems are useless. Try running detectives hunch, rainbow map, inner strength and it should be ez. You are new though so just run around the map looking for totems
---
I'm talking about tier 1 because I've never found tier 2 hope on any of my characters
---
Quite a bit
---
The same killer that tunnels and then comments ‚Äúgg ez noob. I‚Äôm here for the salt‚Äú
---
They shouldn‚Äôt balance around bad sportsmanship, just punish the players leaving and ruining the whole lobby
---
Deeply deeply addictive lol
---
10 $USD and then you gotta spend the time to level it up so it may take awhile
---
Getting left on the ground so the killer might get a 4k isn't fun
---
No sorry, you still arent actually getting it, but either way, have a good day. Its also worth noting, they refered to freddy as a mistake literally days after releasing him, and mentioned they were likely going to do a rework sooner or later.
---
So perks make a killer toxic? Does that mean any survivor who runs adrenaline, BT, DS, and Dead hard also toxic? People are going to run meta perks and if you blame the killer you‚Äôre never going to get better.
---
Definitely not gonna disagree there
---
It just wastes time
---
There's gotta be bigger consequences to dcing. I was running tombstone Myers and all 4 of them dced so I lost my add ons
---
The devs talked about how they used the S3 versions of Steve and Nancy specifically because they couldn‚Äôt have minors in the game.
---
Also you‚Äôre a piece of shit.
---
As a hag main, please keep going for ruin
---
Okay good thank fucking god you‚Äôre not a scum like the rest. Spirit mains have been literal scum with phasing away after hooking and then phasing back to the hook to proxy camp and tunnel
---
This is me whenever I spot the (locked) hatch as a killer. I can't find it again and the last survivor ends up escaping through it
---
For me anyways. Ive already accepted the sweet embrace of death but mister wraith said no
---
Lmao making a meme about such petty things indicates where another child is.

"I'm sorry little one, you know too much"
---
I don't think you want to be using dictionary definitions for descriptions of in-game actions... Because if we do, I assume killers never actually ''kill'' someone, even if we all call it that?
---
thanks y'all
---
Meg, sprint burst and adrenaline or claudette, self care is great
---
Plauge is sad
---
That‚Äôs literally not her shoe though  notice how it says a child‚Äôs shoe found in the bog while the other ultra rare add on mint rag says Lisa Sherwoods torn dress?
---
like my thought was this game was shit maybe the next game will be better \*next game is way fucking worst\*
---
like i dropped a pallet on her head she didn't get stunned teleported through the pallet and downed me like wtf
---
You call both survivors and killers having an issue with massive amounts of players DC‚Äôing is a petty topic?... You must DC a lot.
---
Leatherface has good perks. Why wouldn‚Äôt you buy him for those
---
Okay, if you‚Äôre going to be trying to change the literal definition of a word to fit you‚Äôre argument I‚Äôm done participating.
---
Ruin is mandatory, Noed is a genrush punish, BBQ is too good to take.
---
Pop is annoying but it's just a perk.
---
NeRf kEyS
---
Standing still isn't a mindgame since there's no way for the survivor to discern what she's doing. Games require decisionmaking from both sides depending on the action of the other. Standing still is not a deliberate, skillful play to make a survivor take another action.
---
What‚Äôs the strategy against those perks as a surv? Whenever I face it it‚Äôs hard to get gems done. Same with the ruin, thanataphobia, nurses calling combo.
---
Demigorgan with thrill of the hunt. "yes, touch the glowy one"
---
Moaning killers out in force today
---
&gt;And by simply uploading a administrator software for game files you can find one easily, to a USB and then plugging it into your console it will find the game and give you control over certain coding that restrain speeds, positioning and the likes.
---
Dude you're so full of shit lmao.
---
Have you ever heard of context?
---
"DAMN SHE DUMMY THICC"
---
If a fucking GAME is reason enough for you to act so immature and aggressive, then it's really telling how sad your life is.
---
I personally get a kick out of survivors DCing. The only thing I like better than a survivor on a hook is the audio cue of someone leaving the match.
---
I‚Äôd probably hold off on DLCs until you‚Äôve played the game. See if you enjoy the base game first, since there‚Äôs only one gameplay mode - all of the free survivors and killers are good, DLC just gives you more options. Then if you like the game, there‚Äôs definitely DLC that‚Äôs worth buying. :)
---
It is proportionally more likely for a survivor to DC - per game, but the killer actually gets bonuses from this, whereas with the reverse the survivor often de-pips.
---
I think the issue with it being complained about by killers only, is because it is a message directly to the killer (most of the time). It will usually be in a form of 'protest' against the actions of the killer. I don't agree with DCing - but *usually* the remaining survivors can see why - otherwise they would just let themselves die. Still is annoying from a survivor POV - but hey, I like a challenge.
---
wait, but why am I exposed after cleansing it, hol'up...
---
Spirit: makes you think she‚Äôs doing something while actually doing something else. FUCKING MIND GAME.
---
*suicide on hook* yeah, lots of fun, 4 hatchet, 4 kill ez
---
https://i.redd.it/3o882gbz4vj01.jpg here‚Äôs the link to the original.
---
I will usually only DC if I‚Äôm playing against prayer beads spirit or if I get haddonfield as killer. I‚Äôd rather keep my sanity than endure either of those.
---
As a susie main and somebody who dislikes Billie eilish this is very triggering lol
---
Really so her sword description stating that it‚Äôs covered in the blood in her entire family means nothing? She got her revenge she‚Äôs just still mad
---
Big brain trapper or loops trapper?
---
They referred to Freddy as a mistake because he was insanely good at release so they nerfed him to the ground.
---
See?
---
If it‚Äôs more about the movie than the book, then probably
---
You just gave an idea to r/dbdgonewild
---
What about the sewer assets? What about the lead dev posting a picture of a clown holding balloons? Why don‚Äôt you address these points?
---
You're partially right. There is a 'correct' or ideal way to go around loops but the mindgame is to trick them on which way you went. Spirit acting like they're phasing when they're not is a mindgame because it's playing games with the survivors minds..
---
I try not to chase to much and put my traps where I would expect people to vault and right next to pallets, then I corral then to said pallets and windows. Maybe big brain?
---
His power and himself.
---
Also affects kindred
---
In all fairness - people act like DCing is a conscious decision - when in fact, I would put money on it mainly happening as a pure rage quit, probably involves screaming or shouting or something about to be broken in the real world. It is instinctual in that regard, and people saying 'Don't DC be respectful' to these kids, won't have any impact whatsoever.
---
Well, if all you need is a purple/pink key then wow that's a real easy counter that you can do anytime.
---
Nurse
---
Pink finger clown is just the same, if not better.
---
Alot of people complain about the fact that he drags them back with the knife and that it isn't "realistic"
---
Oh my son, it was once casual. Soon, you will find yourself covered in sweat and rage
---
Her instant down addon is too easy to take advantage of so I get why people disconnect even though I hate that. At least with Clown you have to score a direct hit with a bottle and then hit them with a basic attack to make use of them.
---
No, thats actually not why, even upon release he was strong yes, but nothing completely insane. The issue was why he was strong, he was strong because he made games take nearly twice as long a lot of the time, which was not at all what they wanted, and they admitted he was rushed, and they made a mistake. The nerf, was pretty much just a placeholder until the rework which came much later.
---
Oooh salty boy at it again, how abount instead of making "I'm superior to that childs" posts, you could... Ya know... Make memes...
---
I heard this entire meme.
---
Had this happen to me a few weeks ago as a hillbilly. I was 90% through the pickup when the pallet was dropped. It pushed me out of the pallet and the survivor died in the basement
---
Ruin is so mandatory it should be practically built into every game by default
---
Is dissecting thing an American thing? I have never done that in school luckily. It should be illegal or a choice, not an order. You are literally opening a poor animal for no reason.
---
Why not just suicide on hook and get your 1000 points or whatever?
---
Aye but you get the auric cells back best thing to do is do the free pass first then pay and reap the rewards
---
You already used your Sprint Brust at the start of the game because you forgot you had it.
---
I‚Äôve been having this problem on Hawkins.
---
Imo it‚Äôs a matter of instruments. Reading comments everyone seems to agree that the bells would be annoying in game, that‚Äôs kinda true. What if you switched the bells with some dark string? That would perfectly fit into the gameplay!
---
My favorite is when people try to blind me when I'm playing Myers and stalking them
---
Face camping is just staring at someone after hooking them. And yes, nodding
---
I personally would put feng under non bender, jsut because she seems tech savvy, and Ace as the avatar lol. But I love the list, and the idea behind it, Avatar is my favorite show :)
---
So many team escapes with found keys!
---
I dont think they can actually sell a game with a minor committing murder in several countries without getting a high rating or simply not being allowed at all.
---
**enemy spotted**
---
I‚Äôve only been mad when i get hit box issues. The game is not that serious.
---
To me, the best counter to iridescent head is to not be chased.
---
After the next patch, Detectives Hunch might be a good option as well!
---
You don't get the first charge back after fatigue, you still have to wait a second or so, then wait a further 3 seconds, not 2, for the second as it's more than likely people will be out of LoS then.
---
Spirit does work within the physical plane yes, but it's still not as hard as you'd imagine. The speed (on The Nurse's side) is heavily increased for blinking, so it's also harder to see survivors when going through Objects, add on that Survivors can see where you're going before you do as The Nurse now, so it is, on all accounts, a nerf. Not a hard nerf, but certainly a nerf to make her below Spirit.
---
Nugger?
---
This is turning into an ascension meme

Fair

I love Freddy but old Freddy was trash

And you need to do it in a short amount of time.

 [Livestream 32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSSNv1NfIeo) They say how all survivors are over 21, for killers they say "depends on if you're talking about  age when Entity took them or how long they've been in the realm".  [Written Summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/5jt237/stream_notes_for_dead_by_daylight_developer/)
---
I mean yeah but he was fun to play
---
20% for 5 seconds recoups 1 seconds worth of gen repair. regression from a failed check is 4% (3.2 seconds worth of gen repair) with 3 second of 0% repair speed on that gen. This perk does almost literally nothing. Even if you got 20 checks and failed them all this perk would only save you 8 seconds total (not to mention the 64 seconds of regression).
---
Just like you said, its a bait to say ‚Äúcome after me‚Äù when the survivor you‚Äôre chasing tbags at pallets. Its just s strategy to buy time and unless you as the killer is able to get them thru mind games, its your fault for committing into chases and getting looped for running in a straight line imo. 
---
If they tbag at the end of the game as if they did such a wonderful job at defeating you, thats when I have issues. For example I was fighting a Bill yesterday and he was lucky my hit when thru him and hit the person off the hook he saved. So I hooked them back up and the bill had time to open a gate and tbagged for a good 10-15 seconds. Now that‚Äôs unnecessary bc it gets nothing done.
---
Gotta say clowning around is the best
---
Yeah I think ebony moris should be removed ngl
---
I'm actually not running any of them. ;) Well, boosting about Survivors, who are being peasants about a 4k, while you used the best Perks in the game, isn't quite the best either. I'm not blaming anyone. For me it's just not an achievement to get a 4k with these 4 perks.
---
While I'm sure some people do rage dc I think a lot also just leave because they aren't interested in playing against X-mechanic.
---
Most streamers who dc tend to just do so because they dislike x-mechanics and I think that rubs off a little on their viewers.
---
Yea no. Every time I would start the process of someone falling asleep they would run to a pallet and throw it in my face or jump through an infinite window
---
I was like them

Simple Border Update üôåüèº
---
Thank you good sir.
---
When are we getting this update? I wanna ‚Äòtalk‚Äô with a few bloody camping trappers ü§úüí•ü§õ
---
Meanwhile all the gens get done with Ruin still up cause you threw the match
---
If you say so, it's that or everyone depips anyway.
---
*salute teabags at exit as yoy die on hook*
---
Spirit stops moving suddenly, the survivor then has to decide if she phasing or is she faking it. You will most likely have a different path you take depending if you think this is phasing or not phasing.  If she was faking it and you ran back towards her to confuse her with scratch marks, guess what you just got mind gamed.
---
Just because something is simple for one side to do, doesn‚Äôt make it any less of a mind game.
---
Holy shit. I‚Äôve only played the game for like 7 hours between console and PC combined, never climbed above rank 18, and even I know Wraith is a fucking joke.
---
That little demogorgon lol

Can't wait to see people like you getting soft banned for dcing

Just post fantozis video you don't have to use vreddit and give no credit
---
Looks fresher than Quen so yes, yes it does
---
I love when they do this
---
With this new update we always verse a red rank killer (I‚Äôm rank 1 survivor). My friends are rank 16. They get so angry at the game cause we get a killer who always camps or tunnels cause they think SWF=Toxic

Its almost as if they put it on a Test Build so you could test it to find out what works and what doesn't BEFORE it goes live...

Every time i run into a lit totem mid chase i just tap the totem notifying the killer i know where it is.

Then i cleanse it after and activate haunted grounds...

Rip
---
Exact reason why I stopped playing DBD. It's way to toxic. I grinded and earned all my add-ons and perks with killers but survivors think they are entitled to escape and DC whenever they get downed and resort to the argument of saying shit like "your trash and you can only use 1-shot to get kills" yet I grinded up to earn them to use them. And yet I don't complain or argue when they T-Bagged, body blocked, gen rush, destroy my totems in the first 30 seconds or flashlight spam.
---
Yeah.. the grind is insane. If I spent the hours I've invested in this game I would've been max level and max equip in a mmo.. and I'm not even close to get every perk even for just one character due to prestiging
---
180lvl per character in killer side to have everything in a single char. Few more for survivors. It's insane
---
Spirit has the most mind game potential out of any killer. I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs not obvious.
---
Happened to me three games in a row :(

I'm not scared of the wraith but with music I might be
---
I 4K with bubba without camping and I get called a hacker or a try hard ;(
---
You can't punish survivors For suicide. Kobe is a game mechanic, devs gave you the right to do it, struggle is another mechanic. If they want to punish suicide, then take of Kobe and Struggle
---
Yeah, that teabag you mentioned is what I meant. Sometimes I've had people open the gate and just wait for me, and when I go towards them they just teabag then escape. A similar thing happens with hatches too, they just wait by the hatch until I locate it as well, then they jump straight in. 
---
It's not quite the exact same thing but I'm not very good at explaining and listing examples, but totally get what you mean. Some things just don't give either side any benefits, yet people still do them purely for the purpose of being toxic.
---
What the...
---
It is different but not bad. Discussions can be used to inform so for instance someone may start a discussion on climate change to sway people to their side of the issue using evidence they have to support themselves while arguing against the other side. As long as they just present facts and are treat the other side with respect there's no harm in that.
---
I've never understood the concept of gen rushing. Isn't that just playing the objective?
---
just dont get found 4Head
---
There‚Äôs two main ways of staying alive as survivor. You either learn to hide or you learn to loop. The first is easier but you should have a basic idea of looping as you rank up. 
---
Learn to hit those ruin skill checks, and you won‚Äôt care about ruin anymore. I can hit ruin skill checks about 60% of the time now because I practiced instead of running around looking for a totem.
---
If you want to get better at looping, there are tons of instructional videos on YouTube to help you with that. One thing higher level players will do is recognize loops throughout the map and also have a plan. 
---
For example you‚Äôre working on a generator with a loop to your right and a loop to your left. Depending on which side the killer comes from you should already know which loop you are going run towards.
---
After time you will begin to recognize loops and utilize strong loops well. DON‚ÄôT CAMP PALLETS. Pallets are the only resource that helps survivors stay alive and you need to loop them to maximize time for other survivors to do gens.
---
A lot of killers especially on lower ranks are afraid of getting pallet stunned so they will usually not run through pallets, but every killer is different. If they respect the pallet then it gives you another free loop. I also never throw down pallets if I‚Äôm full health going against an M1 killler. 
---
At the end of the day you will get better if you just think of what you could have done better in that chase instead of blaming the killer. We all can improve we just have to not get tilted and understand what went wrong. Best of luck in the fog.
---
Absolute truth. Umbria, Scottjund, e.t.c none of them use iridescent heads.. go ask them why. Go ask an actual good killer main why they don't use instadown addons.
---
My question is: why do people even do that? Anyone have an answer?
---
I'd say leather face to get his BBQ but if you already got that I'd say myers, he was three first one I unlocked and the amount of fun I have had with him is amazing. Defo with his tombstone add ons and people least expect  it you to walk up to them and kil them on the spot. Always brings a smile to my face haha
---
‚ÄúYou saw my totem, you must die‚Äù
---
Yes, that's how I use him. He's probably the 2nd best killer on console if you use him like tru3's. But my point is that's only viable if you use those 2 add ons. Once the add ons over, he's probably worst than Legion...
---
Will the day of the dead skins glow in-game like Nea and Joey‚Äôs?
---
Believe it or not, it's worked.
---
Best thing I've seen in my lifr
---
I don‚Äôt use those add ons, I‚Äôd get 4ks with any of them. He doesn‚Äôt have the strongest ones anyway.
---
I disagree with that camping statement, cause it CAN be strategic. I dont typically camp, but if I know theres a survivor nearby (usually cause they either body block or they didnt hide well enough) I'll stay around to get the survivor and prevent the save. Then 2 people arent fixing generators. If I dont notice anyone I dont camp, I just hook and move on.
---
Too bad a lot of killers don‚Äôt have that mind set. I see a lot of killers bring meta perks with strong add ons and go all out for the 4K. 
---
I‚Äôm a console huntress main for killer, and if I got tilted every time I didn‚Äôt get a 4K I would lose my sanity.
---
I get so triggered when I escape or 4K and still depip
---
Sadly the only love he‚Äôll get
---
I'm rank 9 on pc. Literally only saw Myers and ghostface with one trapper yesterday during like 4 hours of game play. But for some reason on Tuesday I went against almost purely legion in about 2 hours.
---
lol its funny that I never mentioned anything about meta perks and yet they're the biggest concern rn, I use bbq save the best for last, sloppy, and ruin almost every time
---
This rulebook meme is the worst. It literally just causes so much divide between people, I wish samination stopped popularizing all the killer biased memes.
---
So true. I would love to dissect something again.
---
...Didn't know that.
---
Wasn't fixed when I played yesterday. I currently call this weapon "thumb wrestling."
---
Does it run bad on weak hardware?
---
They need to put the "hello zapp" song from the movies as the chase theme for the pig
---
Is it the knife or skin that‚Äôs bugged?
---
Being able to collat with huntress iri heads would be so broke but so satisfying
---
I think the knife.

usually with emotes. spamming gestures to get people to to attack me where I want. its surprisingly effective.
---
Because they're trying to be like their favourite dbd youtuber and annoy the killer
---
yeah the description would say fuck your body blocks
---
Fair enough I‚Äôll just shove on my blood knight or uncle slicey
---
I'll pretend I never saw that
---
This has to do wiht the fact that not many people play the game, it's not something they can fix, they need more players

To be fair.. the meme has nothing to do with the ‚Äúrulebook‚Äù ... just the title.

it's not that bad, can't even think of stranger things bugs that aren't fixed yet. it's mostly dedicated server testing that introduces potential  bugs

The reason is education.

or you walk up behind them and it's a dull totem

Could of sworn there were on the game...
---
See, you are fundamentally wrong. There does NOT have to be a tell in order for it to be a mind game. Mind games are about guessing what your opponent will do. If spirit stands still, you have to make a read. Is she phasing? If so where? You may be able to see grass move or hear her footsteps. Is she just standing there? You can read that and put distance between you.
---
It is a mind game becuase both people can try to predict the other and make a play based off it. There does not need to be a tell involved.
---
But doesn't that involve having to complete a gen first in order to activate the perk?
---
Thank you for not treating me like a stupid noob and explaining. Much appreciated!

From his pinned comment:
---
&gt;Some explanation about what happened here.
---
&gt;Before that moment, there's been a lot of weird stuff going on with the PTB, such as rubberbanding or the weird, fast fog. However, it was only happening to some people. We were told that this might be tied to uncapped FPS, which you can do by changing options in the settings file. This turned out to be true.
---
&gt;After that, we decided to try do some extensive tests - setting the FPS cap to 1000, lowering the game's resolution, turning off Vsync, etc, just to see if it would amplify the effect.
---
Swf is also meta, a coordinated swf can destroy most killers
---
Don't have that yet.
---
Mr Bing Bong himself. Really fast pallet breaking, silent bell...so fun.
---
Ah,m that makes sense. That sick duck! Off with his head!!
---
Damnit let me try again. NoEd Is OvErPoWeReD
---
So many, I can't pick a favorite
---
Spirit because you get to clock people at a distance, stare at them motionless, then show up later in the corn and beat their ass
---
Legion because wildly following feral frenzy impulse takes you to unexpected places (hello Claudette hiding in the bushes)
---
Plague for the battle chunder
---
Clown for the HEEEERRRHGGHUUUGHHH
---
Pig because starting an ambush from behind cover, shooting out and connecting it to a running survivor is a really, really good feeling. Especially when you know you surprised them
---
Problem is that survivors are already too strong, since generators don't take long enough for most killers to have a chance at good ranks. Especially slow killers like Huntress, who is vulnerable to the many levels with absurd loops. I mean, her hatchets can't even go over most waist high loops like in Autohaven, which makes no sense.
---
Lmfaooo
---
My boy Quentin and Detective Tapp!
---
I would say spirit but that bulge she got in her neck has got to go.
---
That's not the nurse. That's you. Git gud. The reason I can loop the nurse is because I get thrown against God tier nurses and they're not nearly as difficult as you all make her out to be. After a while you get used to the killer and learn how to cope. Same with any killer. If you haven't against the nurse then that's a you problem not a nurse problem.
---
what? :/
---
this is one the best things I've seen
---
I love playing against Myers!
---
I thought you were making a joke you were gonna get lobbied with a rank 1 despite being rank 10.
---
probably, but this is dead by daylight, so don‚Äôt expect competency in the hit box department
---
If you suspect they have nurses, try to get outside of the terror radius before healing and you should be ok
---
I don't understand why people take it so seriously. If a game gets you to the point of rage it's time to take a break. Especially if you have no impulse control and end up being a jerk to someone.
---
That‚Äôs some high quality production
---
Yep.
---
I find his pounce (shred) is def good in situations when needed, but shred can also be useful for just catching up to people.
---
When you are in T3, maximize your time as much as possible by slugging and ending chases as fast as possible. If they loop you for too long drop chase and quickly find another person.
---
Casual SWF, PS4, username jimitrippin21.

I am a kid, so sorry if my prepubescent British tones piss you off. PM if you wanna play.
---
why do you think I main him?
---
It's sad kids these days will never know the glory if Goosebumbs. My favorite was always the werewolf of fever swamp
---
well i'm getting to rank 1. can't do it on console cause it seems like nobody knows what gens are
---
Hag and clown are the better looking ones this year.
---
Jake looks cool for the survivors. The doctor is still the best looking blight character though, love his face.
---
...do totems...
---
How do I find them easily I don't have infectious fright.
---
Well that wouldn‚Äôt be very nice now would it
---
I get that strategy. That usually works in solo queues since the other survivors can‚Äôt tell others to immediately leave and go gens. But if you‚Äôre just camping a person for legit no reason, it just annoys me and ruins their day. 
---
But then the trapper I faced yday, he tunneled the living shit out of a claudette and proxy &amp; face camped the other two survivors. Not to mention he had 2 ultra rare addons for automatic damage and setting of traps but he also had Noed at the end.
---
It was probably a ping issue. He was probably closer than he appeared on your screen. It sucks because your character was already running when you landed. Window hits just suck in general. They seem really inconsistent.
---
To me a killers only toxic if he camps or tunnels the guy who JUST got rescued which is understandable if theirs just 2 people left but if not thats just toxicity
---
Forgot to unequip a yellow flashlight a previous game and the clown equipped franklins and a mori. Fun.
---
I hate this.

I do also like playing ghostface

Had a bad match on lery's institute, got a guy calling me trash and to uninstall the game.
---
I reported his ass on the spot cause I won't tolerate shit like that.
---
Thank you for the nice comment! 
---
The advice actually really helped me realise it's not so bad after all, especially since there's genuine killer mains with hundreds to thousands of hours. If they can have fun, so can I. Thank you for the last sentence too, certainly restoring faith. Keep lifting spirits in the fog, I wish there were more players like you :)
---
Had the same a couple of times, hate this shit so much. It's better to fake that u use the window, but in this situation he would not you than anyway I think, except you were behind these tires or something
---
Holy Hell yes!
---
With the new update when any gen is completed your perk activates, not just gens u finish. Also it now lasts for 10 seconds instead of 5
---
Use sound, when you are close to survivors you can typically hear their breathing or sounds of rustling grass. They will most likely be on gens or around worked on gens. Myers can then just one shot, end loops with his amazing lunge, slug and move to next target. I highly suggest M&amp;A and Infectious to find survivors and sneak up on them easier
---
And how would the survivors possibly know he has no perks and no other addons? Iri heads are broken and completely unfun. Even Scott Jund, a huntress main says they should be removed from the game. I don't blame people for disconnecting against a completely unfun and broken add-on.
---
People will just kill themselves on hook. Punishing disconnects will sadly do nothing
---
Honestly ruin and NOED I'm pretty sure can get anyone to rank 1 killer. I used to use them and made rank 1 every season I stopped using them 2 seasons ago and only make to rank 3-5 since I stopped
---
Get out of tier one ASAP unless you playing scratched mirror myers,don't bother chasing in tier one you'll be super slow. When you're chasing and they drop a pallet if it doesn't stun you then get an extra bit of stalk in but not so much that you lose them. Never go straight to tier 3,wait until you are practically at it and then when you can guarantee a hit, pop it and hit them, ez down. It's also best not to hook someone immediately after downing someone in tier 3 if you know there's others nearby.
---
I‚Äôd be totally fine with that or them just being a two stand alone survivors. I‚Äôve been watching this show for about 10 years and know this show, it‚Äôs too perfect not to add them in.
---
Corrupt intervention &gt; Ruin
---
It seems like if you swing right away it negates the stun, i could be wrong tho
---
I mean, am I supposed to let him get the save? If I hook a survivor and see another, I'll protect the hook as I attempt to hit that survivor. If he unhooked the survivor I'll hit either one, I dont really want to tunnel the recently hooked one, cause ik how unfun it is, but I do not control the hatchet, the hatchet decides their fate. But I dobt do ot to be toxic, I do it to get another nearby survivor and get that one hooked as well. Like I mentioned tho, if I dont see anyone, I dont have a (valid) reason to camp. The survivor can be freely unhooked.
---
Wat
---
They used their Terminator license on Deathgarden lol
---
Once that happens there's a 50/50 chance of another random survivor DC'ing as well lol
---
I mean it‚Äôs on both sides. Had a nurse tunnel me all game because I pallet saved a teammate.  She was pretty bad and realized she probably wasn‚Äôt going to get me so she dcd and I lose my offering and points. It‚Äôs not balanced for either side so.
---
Now that i think about it wouldnt it be nice if they had venom in here
---
And thus being a toxic douche cost them a kill
---
Hey, I brought you lunch.
---
Here‚Äôs your knuckle sandwich.
---
Wraith or billy for head
---
Billy stronk
---
Ah those people are just dumb. But both sides are equally toxic. I think it helps playing both sides. I play killer and survivor so I get to see the worst of both. But in ALL honestly. I have to deal with more bs as a survivor.
---
You make it sound like people on reddit give credit on every single video they find funny lol
---
doesnt this show have to do with satan at least a bit? imagine him as a killer. the embodiment of all evil, a mere pawn of the entity? hell naw, he'd be runnin that $#!t. i dont think another 2 survivors at once is a good idea, i thought it was strange they did that for stranger things. unless we get a surprise killer to even it out, or maybe no survivor when next killer comes in december.
---
I randomly disconnect in this game and this game alone. Hard to know how many dcs are actual dcs
---
It was so fun to say goodbye to a survivor that you hooked near opened gates. Pretty much invulnerable for 5 seconds.
---
Fair points. T'is a shame nonetheless. I don't DC - but I will be honest and say my only experience with it (maybe once or twice) has only been after a continuous series of bad games to the point that I got so fuming I just had to leave upon starting a new game and it all going to shit within the first few seconds due to rage.
---
But this is mroe of a legit - I'm seriously not wasting any more time 'not having fun' on this game - low level DC. Rather than the high level DCs you get which tend to be more common of 'this isn;t going my way and Im unlikely to get what I want this game so going to back out early to save time'.
---
Amazing
---
Cluad, self heal. Nea, balanced landing and ubran evasion. lauire, strike. Bill, borrowed time. Mains perks I would use on any character really. If am in a very helpful mood then empathy from cluad, so I can go and heal teammates. You never know they some perks might show up in Shrine. Good luck.
---
Confirmed real. His spidey senses are stronger than the hit boxes.
---
Hawkins creeps me the fuck out. Everytime its just me going "Can I hang with you guys this place is creepy" as Clown.
---
Totems spawns suck but you won before you had ruin. Grow a pair
---
Hah! Stoopid *noob*   /s
---
Nothing beats Leatherface. It's unbelievably brutal and even more than Hags imo
---
What scares you? Losing?
---
I love the map as much as i hate it. And playing survivor against demo there, hearing his roars across the map is just so unsettling. Its great
---
Bitch
---
Lmao.. if you bothered to actually read ANY of those posts it clearly mentions I don‚Äôt kill people when I play killer I only dick around and let everyone go, my complaints every time which have been solidified today with how riotous people think they are DC‚Äôing randomly, is even when they get someone playing killer like me.. being friendly.. carrying them to gates.. giving them stuns.. there are STILL people who get so frustrated that they DC and it‚Äôs fucking stupid. Calling someone who has more hours on survivor than killer.. who only memes as killer... a ‚Äúkiller main‚Äù has got to be one of the stupidest things you could say and proves 2 of my posts today correct. Stop acting like an entitled shit.
---
Well...going to PC expect to see Huntress, Nurse, and Spirit more. The DbD meta is honestly a toss up of about 6-10 perks you can change around depending on the killer you play, and your skill level as killer/survivor. And the "meta" killers are Nurse, Spirit, &amp; Billy. But I'll play every and all killers no matter what rank.
---
I honestly just find perks to synergize with and play around with that. I'm a kind of player that tries to do my own thing, and come up with a build that fits my playstyle. I would suggest, you get away from NOED if you want to improve your killer skill. Especially on Myers, he really doesn't need NOED. That is what Tier 3 evil is for.
---
I‚Äôve been tunneled, camped, dh not registering, lag switched. Survivors sandbagging. Just so much garbage as a solo survivor.
---
Yes but that's not what I meant, at the start of the match when ruin is active don't you (or a teammate) have to complete a gen while ruin is active?
---
Depends when they do it, if you‚Äôve already chased them and hooked them then if anything it helps you stomp the others and pip
---
Survivor bad killer good upvote to the left
---
the new bamboozle looks promising
---
Awesome pic, but can we all please agree to stop with the ghetto clapping forced dialogue?
---
It instantly downs you, at range, and that's not OP?  Like what world do you live in. I give Billy shit for not having to travel to instadown but at least he has beatable in that regard: Ain't nobody juking Huntress enough times for Irh to not be what downs you. 
---
It's like Pink Finger on Clown or Tombstone on Myers, ain't nobody living through that game unless you CHOOSE to let them live given how easy it is to land that instant down. And those add-ons are same rarity as instaheals and those got nerfed for the inverse reason, ain't nobody should be defending instadown addon's.
---
Also lasts 10 seconds instead of 5.
---
my number one suggestion is watching ohtofu videos. i‚Äôve been playing for nearly 2 years and he  still always teaches me something new. it‚Äôll hopefully make you more confident in your abilities when playing survivor and get you out of your hump. i definitely know what you‚Äôre talking about tho, sometimes u just gotta throw urself in the deep end. good luck!!
---
Killer good survivor bad give me updoots
---
It‚Äôs already been posted
---
Then they'll just suicide on first hook. Nobody wants to play Iri games, get over it.
---
Oh right but I don't have infectious and i dont feel like buying plague because i just bought michael.
---
Yeah. I‚Äôd probably agree. But in the long run, which is a better killer wraith or billy? I‚Äôm no good as billy tho but he‚Äôs a good killer
---
The only way you're going to improve is by playing and putting time into the game. I think it's better to solo queue than to run SWF at first. You learn to be self sufficient and build your game sense. You have to pay attention to sound and your surroundings as opposed to given information via voice chat. Low rank survivoing is horrible, but It gets better.
---
Yeah it does, but in the earlier seasons it was much more creative and would go case by case with different types of killers being added in the show every other episode. They‚Äôd have ghosts, the trickster, hell hounds, and as you said literal Satan, but they could figure it out.
---
I agree, it isn‚Äôt a good idea, but in this situation you can‚Äôt have one without the other. They are both mains of the show, while stranger things they could‚Äôve done without adding Nancy and we would‚Äôve been fine with just Steve.
---
I watch a lot of Otz videos, and in his videos he use a bunch of perks I don't see usually, and he do pretty well with them. That made me really confuse about the meta, because, some people in this sub says things like "The perks make the killer" and other says "Some killers only needs their add-ons, perks are dispensable".
---
It‚Äôs a HUGE problem when a killer dcs on console (pulling the plug or closing the game at least) the survivor loses all the blood points they armed all the items they brought and any offering they used and gain nothing it‚Äôs wack.
---
claudette this isnt an anti-hemorrhage syringe
---
Dude removal of Struggle to a button hold would be so nice.
---
Itsssssssssssss punishment time
---
Bullshit it the max
---
I played the most time alone, sometimes with 1-2 friends and as I had my group we were often a full squad until it broke up. Somehow I think I am better with random, maybe cause my squad sucks haha
---
For sure when you play survivor there‚Äôs always going to be asshole killers. But as someone (as I just had to say in a reply on my other post about this subject) who only plays killer to meme and be friendly.. even then.. even when I‚Äôm the killer that most people want to play against who lets them go.. I still get massive amounts of DC‚Äôs because people are too easily frustrated. Then when I try to play survivor, half my team DC‚Äôs on the regular because the killers an ass or just being sweaty, and I complain about it (given I‚Äôve put FAR more hours into survivor than killer) I get called a ‚Äúkiller main‚Äù by idiots.

I'm fairly new to the game but have quickly become a surv main.. I do try to play both but holy shit I didn't realize how annoying good survivors can be to a killer. My second ever killer game I dc'd out of pure frustration from getting flashlight blinded 3/3 times I picked up a surv.
---
I've gotten better now on both sides and haven't dc'd since, but I can feel the frustration when you're new and go against squadette with flashlights lol
---
Or, have you thought for a second that people dont want to fuck around? Maybe they actually want to play the game? Plenty of people don't have the time to waste on a game where the killer does nothing, sure it's nice but some people want actual games. Don't expect people to play around you when you don't play, that's called bring entitled :^)
---
Which movie was this from?
---
That‚Äôs up to you man, billy is meta as hell rn, but some wraith players can make their way to red ranks consistently, I try to avoid meta when I can, so I‚Äôd say wraith, but if you feel like billy would be more worth it you go for it bud
---
I wish this game wasn't toxic, I mean, what's the point of disconnecting in middle of a match? You get nothing and lose two pips.
---
I hate it when people DC as survivor, it slows down everyone else's progress.
---
From the survivor standpoint also annoying. You can keep your rank (0 pip) from an 6,000 bloodpoint game which does not feel fair, but you can get 25k bloodpoints and only get a single pip because the pip system is buns
---
Yes, we all know how treudou loves his little boys. No surprise there. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
yus gimme the doots
---
probs for the game
---
If you use it right its soooo good cause you can just fuckin BOOK IT from the hook with no fear
---
It affects spine chill and premonition IIRC
---
Actually that's Jason Voorhees from the nightmare on sesame Street.
---
You made yourself look like a fool!
---
I just told you what Noed punishs, It punishs you for rushing the generators out.
---
I'm not bitching about gen rushing, You associating it with being a negative thing is entirely your interpretation. 
---
Yeah, It would be stupid for you to ignore a side quest if you knew it made the endboss kill you twice as fast, Unless you want the challenge.
---
It will like for every online game ever
---
Welp you defend ppl dcing so..
---
#he saw through bus
---
This happened to my buddy.. if you have tried everything to fix it and fps is still gamebreaking I would reinstall the game. It worked for him and now runs smoothly
---
Because if the match has no outcome that isn't waiting to die suiciding on hook or dcing is just flat faster to get a fun game. I really don't feel like sitting on the ground for 3 minutes while an instadown huntress plays the game because I don't build myself to counter scenarios that rarely happen. 
---
Some people REALLY don't want to fight shit like that, and I can't blame them.
---
I guess you're just assuming they're that age? There's literally no indication they're that young.
---
hookbender
---
Easy solution is to report for unsportsmanlike and if it‚Äôs a repeat offender, give them a warning then start giving them a cool down if they continue
---
I play a fair amount of Ghostface, so I can probably help
---
1.  Jumping out of Nightshroud Will reactivate your Terror Radius and Stain, and it will be present to survivors affected by it (in the radius)
---
2. For leaning, it is usually M2, which is also the button for your power. Leaning is a PART of the killers power, but you can lean with Nightshroud up
---
3. Yes, with Nightshroud off, you are just a base killer. Nightshroud is your power, and without it you‚Äôre just a regular killer
---
4. I‚Äôd say play who you‚Äôre good at for BP grinding. Putting your points into Bubba for BBQ is definitely worth it. Bubba though isn‚Äôt exactly the best killer, with Ghostface being higher tier than him (some may disagree)
---
5. Buying discordance again in the Shrine for BP isn‚Äôt worth it. The grinding for shards isn‚Äôt equal to the amount of BP you receive, so just get something else or save up
---
6. Your perk layout seems nice. Discordance and Whispers are wonderful for Ghostface. I‚Äôd say drop Noed though. It‚Äôs a perk that some can easily get used to and can‚Äôt function without it. But if you aren‚Äôt that good at killer to start, use it. It could help if you couldn‚Äôt keep gen pressure. Once you get better though, drop it. Sloppy is also a good perk but I personally don‚Äôt use it. Ghostface‚Äôs Thrilling Tremors is a great gen pressure perk that has worked wonders for me, so maybe swap it for that.
---
I really hope this helped. If you have more questions, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask
---
*wraith changed my mind haha
---
But why? Spine Chill is supposed to trump stealth abilities.
---
1: By tap out of it, do you mean use an attack and end it? If so, yes your terror radius and red stain will return. Any time you‚Äôre not in shroud you have a TR and stain. 
---
2: When you‚Äôre standing at a corner you‚Äôll see a prompt pop up on your screen with a little image. This signifies that you can lean there. You‚Äôll need to press the button to stalk, and then GF will lean out and stalk. 
---
3: Yes.
---
4: Yes; you don‚Äôt have to play Bubba, you can just put points you farm from playing other killers or survivor into him. 
---
5: Eh, it‚Äôs up to you but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. It‚Äôs much easier to get bloodpoints than it is to get shards early on. If you‚Äôre really desperate for more perks you can do it though, you‚Äôll earn more shards. 
---
6: Whispers at rank one is essentially useless, I would swap that for something else or level it up to rank three. Everything else should be fine.
---
I'm sorry, what? Nurse is getting some changes? Could you kindly provide a link for details or explain to me in short??
---
Agreed. Doesn't bug me as it saves me time. Of course when I'm just trying to survive and other survivors DC I die a little inside.
---
Hey man, it‚Äôs good, now go out there with your spooky branch-faced wraith and get yourself some good bp :)
---
Ps4 EU, PSN algiuz, looking for fun people to play with. Mics would be nice.
---
Eh, end boss with 2x damage ain't too bad if I have 3x health
---
I didn't even know this community thought Spirit players are automatic dicks.
---
UwU
---
Change the struggle button to the mouse weel scrolling down
---
I‚Äôm surprised as well honestly.
---
Why do they limit themselves like that? It's weird
---
Oof if looks like I pushed a few buttons, first. Calm down keyboard warrior. Second, i don't agree with people DC'ing bc they lost. If they lost bc they got outplayed and they dc, then there simply bad players.
---
The issue is, I could make a list like this and double the reasons for killer to DC and get rid of and ignore half of the survivors reasons and you would get you're panties in a twist. You purposely left out a lot of killer reasons to get easy upvotes on a reddit that is heavily killer sided, and anyone that disagrees with you're echo chamber gets called entitled and a survivor main like we still live in early 2018.
---
In dead by daylight?
---
Added, I'm "dongobongo", we have a group that play survivor together quite often, Central time US as well :)
---
Depends on the killer, anything with a terror radius is not a threat. It's just like playing against plague but without the coughing.
---
As long as you have a loop near you, your good.
---
Keep playing her. If the scratch marks are not there, listen. If they have Iron Will, you're probably fucked lol.
---
"Good killers", "oneshot with theoretically map-sized range". Pick one, because while it takes some skill to land them hits, there ain't fuck all you can do about a surprise axe that hits you over the top of a gen or car or debris-wall.
---
ruin is a garbage wasted perk slot
---
The last one looks like ghostface is bottoming
---
nah, it sucks that you are being punished for this, but their just bad players 
---
dont gotta change anything, just gotta wait for it to be fixed sadly
---
pfft.. looping a clown for 4 gens is nothing.. i looped a clown for 10 gens even though it's scientifically impossible it just shows you how weak clown is
---
Dude the thing I don't get is OoO ain't even bad. Worse spine Chill and exists for the whole "I can loop the killer" build over anything more practical. 
---
Ruin actually has impact but you don't see my bitch ass leaving.
---
Honestly though, during double blood points, i was very reset and very low. so my goal was to have nice long games and maximize points for everyone (mainly survivors ) since frankly I started at rank 18 and it was very very easy survivors.
---
The whole day, not a single game, did the survivors stick to the end. almost every game survs would d/cs after i downed one person, many self kills, and after 1 person d/cd, everyone wanted to. i had a few where the entire 3 man swf dcd after i hit 1. Tried different killers, wasn't running ruin and was putting up the 103 cakes, but no, i got tired of letting them escape at the end . I dont like people who farm, as killer and surv, i just wanna play the game and try.
---
Need some penalty even if a soft one to deter
---
Quick warning. Don‚Äôt max discordance. It gets worse with levels because you get notified less often.
---
Fiddlesticks?
---
The worse part is you get no points for playing the slug game. You get like 5 for healing someone from down and ten more for getting chased for getting slugged again.
---
I played a 30 min game against a ghostface who refused to hook and everyone got like 7k point points. I was trying to be patient, but if that kind of game happens again I will DC.
---
Ever heard of age of consent? It‚Äôs different in every country. But that‚Äôs ok, we all know you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
Everyone struggles with Trapper. He's one of the hardest killers to be good at as a direct result of how shit his kit can be. Object players aren't better than you, on average, they are just more cocky. They are making stealth killers better against it too.
---
The age is consent in parts of Mexico is 12. Does that mean you're gonna hop on a plane to go fulfill your sick fantasies? Get fucked. I seriously hope you get hit by a bus.
---
I've been playing for about 3 months nonstop and I didn't know this, I didn't even know you could crouch walk through them
---
he runs from the top tiers lmfao
---
I do this sometimes but has a strategy... for Myers to reach is stalking limit on me and not be able to stalk me anymore later on the match. Of course, that's not smart when he has infinite T3 xD but I don't do that very often
---
I think youre correct. Had a spirit hit me and have spirit fury activate whilst finishing the pickup animation.
---
Pallet broke but she went and hooked the poor dwight.
---
Whoops someone is at the door and I don't want to have them waiting for 10 minutes for me to finish the game so I'll die on hook. Guess I'm unsportsmanlike.
---
What if I wanted to try and Kobe off the hook, I'm allowed to do that. They give me the choice to struggle so it's also my choice not to. They should probably remove those choices from the game, yeah?
---
You can punish disconnects, but not people killing themselves on the hook.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a spirit that lets us go free. They‚Äôre always super try hard and BM.
---
wait what?!?! learning curve on leatherface? how? its pretty simple, get closer to the survivor and rev chainsaw, not learning curve at all, and he is getting his rewors soon, so he might worth it
---
"New Nightmare" it's pretty bad but I'll let you decide on that
---
Ahahah. Get fucked, dude. What‚Äôs the matter? Mummy didn‚Äôt love you enough? Uncle Theodore touched you in your nono place? Go cry.
---
Gib him upvotes he said the line.
---
This smug ass Ace player was trying to t-bag me and provoke me to chasing him. Little did he know I was running Permanent Evil Within III and he was the Obessseed. I literally was laughing the whole match. Of course I got a 4k thanks to this Ace who thought he was good but ended up giving me the easiest game.
---
I‚Äôm all about small game + inner strength. No need for heals, plus all the benefits of small game.
---
I suppose losing is part of it, id say another part is coming across toxic survivors/killers. Especially for survivor a big part is that most of my games boil down to me dying quite fast and its overall not fun.
---
Time to Mori all of them.
---
I rarely have games where Ruin is easy to pop, and even when it is easy to pop that is time most players aren't on gens because most are too pussy to just power through. Full hex builds with BBQ is enough most games to get players to cleanse the wrong ones.
---
Hope ü§òüòî
---
Yeah that is why they get compensated? What point are you trying to make? 
---
It is more likely for a survivor to depip than a killer because the game ends. There should be a no depipping compensation for obvious reasons.
---
Next time that happens walk away giving them time to think you left then start the projection, but stop it just before you teleport. If they went back to it they'll see it projecting and they'll most likely run or crouch somewhere, sometimes they come running into your open claw lol I'm a Freddy main and it feels like its random, I still havent figured out which way I'm gonna be when teleporting. I just roll with whatever direction I end up facing.
---
only some killers would get rework on their base kit, not all of the mentioned which some of them are: The Shape, Doctor, Bubba and Legion
---
What do you mean? We already have Billy‚Äôs skin! He‚Äôs already a scarecrow! /s
---
That's not how ranking works. Spirit's rank wouldn't change because Nurse got reworked. Spirit's rank would change based on *if* Spirit got changed, and how Spirit interacts with game mechanics. Killers aren't tiered off of each other. SS tier is for characters that ignore a majority of game mechanics, or, with the way things work at the time, perform in a way that has little to 0 counterplay. Nurse hasn't had any mechanic ganges, they've just "limited" how easy it is to abuse the fact that she still ignores game mechanics.
---
If you think it's exactly the same boi do you really take so fucking long to decide your blinks. It takes not long to decide them and how to play her, if you think you can afford ~4 seconds of basically not doing shit to the survivor then be my guest. I'll take Spirit any day.
---
Yeah, had my friend perfectly pallet stun post-pickup and it just displaced killer, no stun. Literally lost us the game by swinging it in their favour.
---
I don't think teabagging at, say, exit gates is toxic. Even if I did, I can't judge because I do it. It's a celebration.
---
Flashlights aren't toxic. Pallet stuns aren't toxic.
---
What is toxic is being an absolute prick for no good reason, like this Spirit.
---
Id rather they change her to something not involving an item.
---
Either 
---
Stop her having collision while phasing. OR
---
Give her a vault animation and get rid of passive phasing. 
---
Obviously delete prayer beads no matter what happens
---
Instead of Ruin, why not just remove it and toolbox add-on fuckery? Bare-handed gen progress seems plenty fast enough to me, I'm just a baby Dweet but I still manage 2gen/game before I get hooked. 
---
Maybe I'm lucky.
---
But did u consider survivor bad and toxic flashlight DS pallet toxic borrowed time upvote now
---
I‚Äôm in this picture and I don‚Äôt want to be
---
No "work around" but I dont see what the issue is with not ranking up, its hardly any different once you get high enough anyway.
---
If blendettes are allowed to do it so can trappers, don't do it BHVR
---
Survivors should not have the ability to kill killers
---
All the fucking spirits are using it I am a main killer but that thing needs a nerf now
---
Killers: Spider-Man isn‚Äôt balanced
---
Chad Maguire: I missed the part where that‚Äôs my problem
---
We will find a way.
---
If Hybrid Panda doesn‚Äôt feature this on next weeks Shrine Watch we riot
---
Pete what are you doing "gens you?"
---
Doesn't really fit DBD.
---
I wonder which one you play, really tough to guess. :\^)
---
The archives are going to help with that you cant go foward  if you only play in one side
---
Always commit
---
this is art
---
I like both, but they're very different games, the only real similarity is that you have to escape a killer
---
i had a game yesterday where i got a 3 man mori in like 5 mins, the fourth guy dced
---
basically they all gave me their stalk thinking i was farming 
---
imagine their surprise when i proceeded to mori them, it was so damn funny
---
Agreed, I think one problem with the dbd community is some people take it too serious and forget it is supposed to be fun. Its not like its an mlg game where money is on the line. If you derank you will just match with others you could actually play well against.
---
Sleeping on my boy dwight
---
Jane has the same hitbox as all other Survivors, the only thing differentiating her from the others is that she‚Äôs a bit easier to see! She‚Äôs loud as fuck though
---
Again with that shit?
---
The problem with the age is the real world implications. in case of real life girls is that you can scar them for life. or the implications of sexualizing a child like character is that you actually promote pedophilic toughts, it doesn't matter if they say it's a thousand years old dragon, the body is that of a child.
---
But in this case, Julie's Body is that of a full grown ectomorph woman, even if she was real and kept getting old, her body would not change until she started getting old enough for her metabolism  to slow down. or unless she did some sort of diet.
---
Really unfitting for Wraith considering how... unthreatening he is.
---
big yikes
---
Chucky WHEN
---
Wraith is prob the coolest one. Although who cares if you don‚Äôt play a killer you could always learn some day and then you will be happy you got the skin :)
---
id buy
---
It‚Äôs rumoured BHVR are gonna put a heart attack warning in the game when this killer gets released
---
Its really important to note that the current mode is casual. We dont really have a formal ranked mode. The only thing that rank actually determines, is what quality of players you are going up against, and casual modes always has that anyways, its just usually invisible.
---
This sounds like someone ambiently banging a pan around in a kitchen. I know you're going straight to the "horror stings" section of your preferred royalty free sound library website, but there's a lot more to thriller music than stings, dings and sharps.
---
Namely direction is what's lacking here.
---
Says the dude with "ham" in their name...
---
It‚Äôs 100 percent not a legacy skin it‚Äôs a blight screen in the paid pass
---
SPIDERDWEET!
---
Do we know if it‚Äôs harder or takes longer with the free pass?
---
Friendship ended with susie, Julie is new bestfriend
---
True, it just feels like its far easier to hit her, especially when playing as the huntress or plague.
---
They are too bad ass for the entity
---
I would buy it instantly
---
Power: honk 
---
Instills freight and fear into the survivors
---
There's a ridiculous amount of smug people who think bad balance should be endured. I'm not a bloody sheep, I don't need to stay quiet about a Welshman eyeing me up from the fence, savvy?
---
The rulebook meme is causing a divide? Literally the game being asymmetrical caused a divide. If people would focus on allowing both sides to have fun so much would be fixed, but we can't have that apparently.
---
There's so many free survs and killers at the base game. I got into about 2 weeks ago and its great. i want to buy the stranger things dlc, but am holding off until I can unlock the better perks as teachables. Once I get the few best ones my boy Steve is gonna see some play
---
3x the hours on survivor over killer. Thinking must not be your strong suit to imagine only killers would take issue with survivors DC‚Äôing.
---
Doctor + clown = scarecrow
---
I like how the B gets a green hand in the bottom picture while his severed hand just kind of floats in midair.
---
OoO on SWF with comms is fucking busted. It seriously breaks the game completely if they know what they're doing.
---
All wards do is allow you to keep the add-ons and/or items. The match would be "sweaty" regardless. This makes zero sense
---
Yeah rank doesn‚Äôt really matter anymore (did it ever?) but my advice would be to either keep playing and deranking until you get to a rank where you have success, or start putting bloodpoints into Wraith and get him some good perks and addons. He has a LOT of fun builds you can do.
---
Bro who cares of deranking. I reached rank 1 now im rank 12 will anyone know I was rank 1 NO now im having way more fun
---
Honestly it makes games much harder to play when you are a completionist. So many games I didn't finish 100% haunt me to this day.
---
this is epic
---
Myers has fair red add ons. Powerful effect, hard to pull off, fundamentally change a thing about his power. The new Nurse ones are also a good example of red add ons. Red add ons that are just ridiculously OP ‚Äúwin the game‚Äù ones like Iri head are stupid.
---
Thst's because you're rank 7, not rank 1-3
---
Oh I will gladly go back to any Hex totem while Thrill is on and spam the shit out of it all game!
---
Removed we ask you take of the sub before posting videos thank you
---
Ive been traumatized by myres when i was new so yes i hate myres
---
You are Name would have been a better reply (laughing emoji)
---
Why can't this not be shown in the offering screen, that way the survivors don't know and everybody is happy.
---
So you have chosen death!
---
Do you mean her body will be revealed for the milisecond that the flashlight spots her, or do you mean her aura will show?
---
If it's the first thing, I wouldn't mind it. Takes skill, and wouldn't really affect her unless the flashlight got her in the eyes. If it's just her aura that shows (and stays for several seconds) then nah.
---
That's only a problem if the hex perk is ruin or maybe lullaby, but that wasn't specifically mentioned by the first comment, they just said hex perks in general.
---
Plus people can still power through gens with ruin; it's tough but possible!
---
no shit
---
Removed for name shaming
---
Hate to argue, but all instruments were made from professionals programs i paid for. And i did have an idea where i wanted to go. Wanted to experiment with percussion but I appreciate your input
---
+1
---
Damn ddde, you want the my little pony soundtrack to play?
---
They still wouldnt know that he has no perks though. There are perks where you cant really tell they have it or not. What a stupid comment.
---
u can tell where it's been by its shit

You should have stopped right there. The second paragraph of yours contradicts the first. That's exactly the point and exactly the problem of the whole post and comments made by others. 
---
No matter how you want to look at it, she is still a minor.
---
too OP
---
People forgetting that chase music turns off once Wraith cloaks so you probably wouldnt get confused by bell sounds,  also none of the clanging actually sounds like the Wraiths bell so i dunno how people are getting confused, anyway sick track man, would listen to any more you make!
---
You can't camp anyway if they DC on a down
---
Trapper/hag/wraith/doctor 
---
Those have been the easiest so far. Not saying I haven‚Äôt lost against them, just not as bad as ghost face. He gets the 4K almost every time lol
---
Yaaaas, please
---
This is amazing. The use of the Raimi suit is perfect
---
Even then videos of ppl who are lvl 1-4 never face the nurse
---
You get one...one shot. "Surprise axe?" They make sound you know also you get hit with a cross map hatchet and it's their only shot you deserve to get downed. If you still have a problem with that run tenacity and unbreakable. Boom solved. It's a video game guys, you are actingas if you are getting killed by a cross map hatchet in real life...
---
Maybe it's because of the shit graphics but clock tower ghost head  didn't had much trouble. it had a 17 years old getting killed by a 7 years old one and another 13 years old one chopped to pieces and her body parts scattered through all the house.
---
I just don't understand why people always say "We need more original killers." whenever a licensed chapter drops, if you like original killers more that's fine but some people like licensed killers more and Bhvr acknowledges this split in the community and always pleases both sides so those who like original killers more can wait their damn turn like the rest of us. I don't ever see "We need more licensed killers." whenever original killers drop back to back.
---
I've seen every killer in red ranks. All are viable. Stop listening to people and play whoever you think is fun. You'll improve
---
Right at the beginning when he swings into Trapper it looks exactly the same as the Myers judo kicking a gen meme.
---
One of their perks would be to come back to life constantly.
---
I normally would agree, but for some reason I've been dcing a lot recently. I mean im just playing and boom out of the game and then the game says I have no network connection while I'm talking to people. 
---
I only ever intentionally DC if I really have to go or if it's like survivor(s) working with the killer
---
Idk man removing your hands off your keyboard and waiting for the survivor to commit to a direction or vault into you giving you a free hit takes a whole lotta brain power.
---
stupid sexy killers
---
Those are all definitely Drew Scanlon, no doubt. Its probably just a weird lighting thing.
---
A punishment system for scum rage-quitters is coming, so continue playing as you do until then.
---
How dumb lol.
---
 Honestly, if I've killed the other three i'm coming for number four. If you get the hatch, kudos to you good man but I'm not "giving" it to anyone.
---
Venom is powerful af, he would absolutely destroy survivors lol
---
Problem with that for me is I'd only find it useful with a map and those are rare.  Also if you have a map you're finding the totems regardless.
---
Torilla tavataan!
---
I have been thinking of this as an Idea for a long time, downside for me whould be cause he is now more of an Anti-Hero. But then I did thing of an so amazingly good fitting Idea: Carnage. And before people whould complain about it sort of being Ski Fy and all, there is still the Demogorgon. But seriously, Cletus Casady is a Serial Killer, it's so Fitting if he whould be here.
---
Why do you feel entitled to forcing survivors to play against you using a purposefully overpowered and overtuned add on? Killers on this subreddit are so entitled, its a two way street.
---
Na he had dead hard
---
For a while totems didn't seem as worth it but then the devs buffed the rewards for taking them out massively.  1000 for a dull 1500 for a hex AND better emblem progress even for someone chased while you take them out.  Yes please sounds fair.
---
WHATTT?
---
Oh dear, it seems you've seen it.
---
"JUst dOnt TuNnEl!!!!!111!"
---
Yeah and he also has borrowed time and DS so you're gonna waste more time chasing him anyway.
---
I mean maybe he doesn't. But you have to assume he does.
---
Plus you gotta get those bbq stacks
---
I understood that
---
Technically the styptic got buffed against an instadown effect. Now you can prevent a leatherface basement chainsaw with a styptic :).
---
After 3 seconds you get hooked and camped.
---
Well, mostly the new dlc characters pull in new folks.
---
But yes, old folk come back so.
---
Wait... You get survivors that do gens through ruin?
---
Jesus that's horrible. Have you contacted them or submitted bug information?
---
Don't know why you're getting downvotes, if they know it's hag and run into the basement idk what they expect. 
---
A killer who used their ability to their advantage? Blasphemy!
---
I‚Äôm not sure that dissecting shit would be that difficult, but I could see it being gross.
---
Replaces the Chase music with Quacking, Replaces the animation for carrying the survivors by the shoulder to just dragging them by the hand to the hook.
---
Devs been getting better and better through time adding new spawns even on the old OG maps.  There are some incredibly well hidden spawns in this game where even playing as long as I have I'm like oh come on I'd have never found that shit without the perk lol.  There's a few you legit can't even see on the map like the one on Spirits map.  You just have to roam the thickets until you see a prompt lol.
---
Well hag is top tier so probably the player behind the killer was just bad
---
Do not buy the legion or plague and tbh if I were u the only killers I would buy would Be Doctor,Ghostface,Michael,Clown ,Spiirit ,Demogorgon
---
Wait for shine
---
True, though there were a bunch of crash bugs afterwards, I do agree a lot gets fixed.
---
Doctor can be fun to play. I definitely prefer him to leatherface.
---
Relentless pursuit and that one huntress perk would prob work really well together
---
Get better at the game then come back
---
Do you mean PLEASE DO
---
Multi-hatchet add-on? What then? Loud-ass fuckin' gens? Survivor whimpering if you're wounded? Those Iri heads are broken both inside and outside of a vacuum. At least Ghostface has to full stalk. At least Myers has to fill his tiers. Huntress? There's absolutely no restriction on the hatchet. Once you've got the add-on, you have a full game of one-shots at range. You're not even obligated to be at range, since she readies and throws so damn fast that survivors have to be on raw nerves to avoid that shit at close range. 
---
I don't even have tenacity and unbreakable, I only have a level 26 Dwight, so what do you suggest? Pray to RNG and use offerings to get sent to maps with sightlines shorter than 10 friggin' metres? 
---
You can mouth off all you like, bud, but your solutoon is predicated on me either paying real money or playing X amount of hours to get two perks. Huntress just has to get -lucky- and the  it's free 4k city. Why don't the Iri heads have a hatchet limit, or some mitigating factor? Hell, even the matchbox isn't quite as egregiously -fucked-.
---
Look, don't DC just Get caught and Suicide on hook. It gives the killer less points (often black or Depip) and you get a few more points to recoup that BNP, SkeleKey, or instaheal you OBVIOUSLY just lost.
---
is freddy any good?
---
Jane is like the opposite of Claudette
---
When I‚Äôm killer, yes. As survivor, no.
---
And if ur looking to perks then it would be doctor,clown,spirit ,Michael
---
A lot of people do it to deny the BBQ stack and giving the killer points.
---
I say cunt for everyone, it's too fun of a word
---
Right lmao rank 20 survivors stay mad
---
Get. Over. It.
---
I don‚Äôt understand this argument. ‚ÄúSWF‚Äù is such a scapegoat nowadays it‚Äôs pathetic. So what if 4 guys queued together. So what if they use meme-y loadouts like flashlights. It‚Äôs a game. They have every right to use what they have and if you get pissed about it, take a break and do something else before coming back. It‚Äôs meant to be enjoyed regardless of who uses what.
---
Dude the meme is if you read the title of the post that you also forget the location
---
He‚Äôs good but u can always get better and if u are looking forward to ability wise and perks
---
That‚Äôs ass, not how the game usually works.
---
If a survivor manages to hit an invisible target with a beam of light, yeah they should get to know she‚Äôs there.
---
*hoooonk*
---
Stop it already dude.
---
Good question.
---
Yeah I was joking lol
---
I hope so. I jist played another match as we speak, and this guy t-bagged me for 2 minutes trying to get my attention. The second I gave it to him, I 2 shot him and he DCd before I even picked him up. I'm just, so tired of stuff like this.
---
Fatigue time is a cooldown with a controller-lockout.
---
Change my mind.
---
They need to rework his face. Idk it just looks so off in game
---
Leatherface is very clearly the worst killer in the meta, but, if you know your killer basics and you just want really easy and simple fun without much care for your win/loss ratio then buy Leatherface. I mostly play only him and I have fun regardless of his meta position. If anything, I get a decent amount of kills cause higher players nearly never face a Leatherboy and so tend to get over confident. Doctor isn't too great either in the meta. Doctor isn't good, he's just annoying as fuck to play against because his ever existence counters stealth and line-of-sight plays. M&amp;A and BBQ are some pretty good perks and you might as well just shell out than wait on shrine RNG.
---
Yep all I ever get back is "we are very sorry we are working to fix these issues" I love this game but damn dude if these internal party systems fucks the game go back to the old way
---
And also instead of seeing the auras for 5 seconds, it'll now be 10 seconds
---
Yeah pretty sure there's not enough survivor players as the survivor queue time is good.
---
Would help if they didn't almost always give people killer dailys
---
I would actually cry if they tried to make me dissect a cat :(
---
**Solution**: Down all the survivors.
---
Nah,same speed I think
---
I find it useful either way, but I can see your point.
---
Venom also looks like he's being eaten by the entity
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Yeah, I do too as survivor, but it's so much less frequently than people DCing intentionally, in my experience. I can see that being the only drawback though, determining intentional vs unintentional disconnection.
---
The killers perks and adds ons are way too OP. Nothing the survivor has even stands a chance. If you subtract killers who let you win or are new the win rate is less than 10%.
---
Freddy is a higher tier killer at the moment. He has the ability to set traps or fake pallets, and to teleport to generators. This gives him good map pressure, and gives the survivors more opportunities to make mistakes.
---
If you use perks like Pop Goes the Weasel and Discordance (or Surveillance) you can slow the game down considerably so you get your kills.
---
I fear people who want to be toxic will go from wanting to hook you to slugging you hoping you DC unfortunately when these changes come to fruition. Obviously some just want to play with OP addons for a round but some deliberately play the addons to try to make other people‚Äôs experience unenjoyable.
---
If they DC within ten seconds of being downed it's probably intentional
---
so you‚Äôre saying the doctor is an annoying prick? Might aswell just pick him up :D
---
The idea spawned from the thought that there were no perks aside from beast of prey that do anything with bloodlust so Relentless Pursuit is intended as a means to make more use of it.
---
As a Ghostface main, whats hardest about the character is understanding that the way he was intended to be used isnt the most reliable way to be played. 
---
The stalk while really powerful, can make you a bit of a push over if you rely on it. Instead, in my opinion, Night Shroud is best used as a tool of chaos, Ghostface is fantastic in bringing the fear of god on the hearts of survivors if you use him this way.
---
Nerf?
---
No problem the grim is why I play  this game
---
Thats part of playing any game competitively, and I dont think shit talking is something that we should remove or look down on in say boxing, football, even gaming, as long as the shit talking isnt a personal attack. Its like shit talking your friend if you beat him in a 1v1, I would find it sad not to have competitive beef with people. I dont call people bad after game, unless they were being outright toxic, but its an option people should be allowed to take.
---
Look whose shitting in the tall grass...
---
Truth. Committed one time on a legion (I was already injured) so he got out of feral frenzy and the fatigue gave me enough time to pop ruin right in his face lol
---
Flashlights are the most weak sauce thing ever. You literally look 2 degrees away and they don't work. Even when it does work it is for all of 2 seconds. In most maps it makes no difference. Killers win 90% of the time so yes I will disconnect when they are running the broken things.
---
A lot of stuff went under the radar in that period as it was assumed videogames cleaned themselves up after the age of Custers Revenge style shovelware. Then in the resurgence of moral panic culture in the 90‚Äôs things got very strict. A notable example is Parasite Eve never getting a Uk release because a level is set in a sperm bank but the sequel was given a age rating and let through no problem.
---
I know in terms of modern games violence against kids became a no go in retail games for certain by the time Fallout 3 released.
---
What jontron vid
---
There you go, that's a good method. The problem is then, people will wait out thay 10 seconds, then dc. Bad sports always have to go around and ruin good things for good people.
---
i just made a game today with the plague, i got two survivors blocked in a corner, made them broken and both down, they dc lmao

Yeah I knew that would be the 'workaround' and your right with that
---
Healing yourself, escaping the hook on your own, escaping as the obsession, dying as the obsession, and escaping the trial will give survival points.
---
Killer: Oh dear, it seems you've seen it
---
1. If you're injured Iri doesn't matter so...
---
2. No restriction? Have you opened a locker as a killer? You have to break a chase find a locker, open locker, reengauge chase throw your one hatchet then find another locker.
---
3. Multi hatchet isn't mentioned only Iri head when a survivor DCs it's not like they say "I was going to stay but you threw 2 WHOLE HATCHETS that could down me so I DC'd"
---
4. The Iri hatchets DO have a hatchet limit 3 with an ultra rare and Rare addon. Thats 12k BP that you waste on every attempt that survivors DC against.
---
5.  A lvl 26 dwight talking like they know the ins and outs of a game they've objectively just started playing... HAHAHAHA
---
What do you mean end the stock?
---
"am i special or is someone a snowflake?" is a pretty dickish thing to say to someone who didn't say literally anything to you. acting all high-and-mighty because you let a ghostface bleed you out isn't even something to be proud of.
---
I feel you bro. I main Legion and there‚Äôs about 20 posts on this sub a day from people who don‚Äôt play Legion talking about how they want to rework Legion. Leave my killer alone please. 
---
But to be fair Freddy has always been my #2 killer, even before his rework. I like both versions of Freddy, I think the best thing about new Freddy is that you can consistently win at high ranks with him because his new kit is just so much better in the grand scheme of things
---
I had a David In PlayStation spaming me message because I ‚Äútunneled‚Äù him with hag but he kept stepping in my traps and I just went after him after he got unhooked and went for someone  else. It went for the whole round but I still won and till the point the messages we‚Äôre just threats of him spoiling end game and just spams. So how are your days been
---
My friends who just started playing a month ago do. But when I‚Äôm playing solo (I‚Äôm rank 1) they can‚Äôt do any gens and all die fast

Doctor is really annoying to play against kind of like Legion way back when they were in the PtB. If you want annoying but also effective go with Freddy specifically dream pallet Freddy
---
He has a point wouldn't call it a stupid comment
---
Well, I didn't ask for someone with a stick up their rear.

If you think nurse is below clown and bubba, I can't take you seriously, I'm sorry. She's still S tier, I'm almost positive she's still above spirit. She ends chases too quickly to be anything below S tier, people just need to adjust.
---
Game is buggy af that's how.
---
It's easier for survivors to be toxic than it is for killers to be toxic. You're able to get flashlights in the bloodweb at like lvl 5 but to get let's say irredecent axe head, you can't get that add-on till around lvl 30ish (20-25 if your lucky) And how the fuck am I entitled? I said I earned the add-ons so I'm gonna use them. That's not entitlement.
---
I'm shooketh
---
hit them with that black ward my dude
---
I always see this but I never have problems... at nights I usually only wait a minute or two max. In mornings maybe a few more but never anything close to crazy. For reference I‚Äôm rank 1 which I think has to do with it, because higher ranked people definitely play more often. Or I could be wrong. I just know I never wait.
---
Basically, an extremely new player playing a very low level Dwight. Doesn't know much about the game yet, making them seem incredibly innocent and pitiful due to the rookie mistakes (locker hiding over anything, poor looping, early pallet drops).

That's the lucky portion of it all

Crawl to your survivor buddy, help the killer find them if they aren't trying to rescue you. That's what I do. I don't play the "Wait till they die to camp the hatch" game.
---
I agree
---
It is, unless you‚Äôre a really good survivor with streamers and cakes/bloodpoint perks
---
Freddy is a better clown with the snares
---
True actually

I find it easier as survivor, killer can larger quantities but it's harder. Every survivor game I play regardless of if I die or not I get like 12k Evey time, killer I get stomped and make 8k or I'll do good and get 25k it's unreliable to me bases around my skill
---
I‚Äôve had ghostfaces that are really difficult to go against (survivor team of 6-2) if they don‚Äôt know how to use him effectively the my best example in mind was a rank 18 (thanks PTB matchmaking)  who couldn‚Äôt do much as he didn‚Äôt play very stealthily.
---
Have you prestiged your David? My Kate and my Meg get more higher rarity items than other characters, and they're prestiged.
---
The survivor we need
---
Ah thanks man. This is interesting.
---
I've never used Solidarity so I must ask...doest it work with We'll make it?
---
Dude have you even played survivor? You need to hide and not get caught and hold down R1 FOREVER. Combine this with the add ons that make you go running around the map wasting time like the head-gear or finding the totem to do the generators while getting 1 hit killed and it's not a cakewalk. How about the fact that the hooks are way too close together and struggling never works. Or when they just put you in the basement and camp the entry door. Matter of fact all of what most killers do is just camp the whole match.
---
I turn the game into 3d chess, once I know survivor knows I just camp a tiny bit the totem and suddenly a mysterious second survivor knows where it is
---
Plague! Have you been messing with demo???
---
Of course it shouldn't but that's an issue fir the devs, not your fellow players.

If you shine a flashlight on her, her Aura will show for the remaining duration of her ability.
---
‚ÄúOh dear, it seems you‚Äôve seen it. It also appears little boy that you have the same power I do. My name is Freddy Krueger. I'm 33years old. My house is in the northeast section of the preschool, where all the children are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Entity  department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby dwight. I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Lol no the shape is weak if your parnerts arent a fucking inmersed claudette
---
I'm piggy
---
I played Hag with ruin once and was just planning on trapping the totem once, but literally all 4 survivors kept going for it without doing ANYTHING else so I ended up trapping the shit of the jungle gym it was in and 4k-ed. Got bitched at for "camping my totem" but like... they literally never left the area.
---
That build is pretty popular. Mine is BBQ / Ruin / Sloppy / Thanataphobia. Really good for applying pressure and keeping people off gens.
---
Actually can make survivors drop items and use them for itself.
---
I was going to say it reveals her aura for the remaining duration of her ability. So all it takes is to barely graze her with it once and now you know where she is going to unphase, but on the flip side if you are shining her with a flashlight, she is probably within hitting distance anyways.
---
One thing to remember, is we are playing roles that absolutely should get angry if they can't win.
---
Roleplay or not. You want to do well.
---
It's after the game that we need to step outside the match and look at the events objectively.
---
Isn't everyone in "Instant Classic" just havr the original DBD music?

---
RIP my man Ash :‚Äô(
---
Nah, I‚Äôll go killer through and through. Rarely for survivor, unless I‚Äôm playing with a buddy.
---
Yes but she's not slower than Survivors so she can still apply some pressure, granted not as much with her power, but it's pressure nonetheless while Nurse gets to just watch you get away unless you're close enough that a single blink will get you.
---
Also with Spirit survivors never really know when you have your power or not, especially in a chase so there's constantly mindgaming with her, it's not just her Power. Nurse is all in on her Power.
---
Okay so you contradicted yourself, again, it's not 0.5 seconds from fatigue to 1 blink, it's 1 second given your math of fatigue being 2 seconds as 3 - 2 = 1. Secondly, please stop saying this, the blink recharge is 3 seconds, where are you reading 2 seconds? If you read the patch notes it says 3 seconds.
---
I'm not saying Spirit is full power and wholly useful when her power isn't up, it's just lightyears ahead of Nurse when her power is down, and her power being down is when she doesn't have both blinks. Which takes about 4 seconds after fatigue given the actual math.
---
Killer queue tho.

I'm not like you people who DC whenever something you don't like happens. I'm just not a coward that's it

Well, is you hear a phasing it means she's a spirit, idk if it's smart to break spirit totems
---
He honestly wasn‚Äôt that great. He would throw bottles and I would run to another loop but he would still think I was there.
---
Ok so wait does his power slow their movement by 15%? Their vault speed? If so it seems OP as you could just hit them with it then keep chasing so they can never snap out of it and will go down quickly with the reduced speed.
---
If it only affects gen repair and healing it seems underwhelming lol not sure how to balance it.

Cool idea though

Omfg happens to me almost every day. So frustrating!
---
I play a lot of survivor to get easy BP/psyche myself up to play 1-3 matches of killer, because killer is stressful. Fun when great, but shirty when not. Compared to I just shrugging if I completely deep up a survivor round, I  jump into another fast.
---
Yeah I play a bit of survivor I would run ruin as well however I don't have it yet I would probably switch out the nurses calling When I play survivor though I rarely ever go against a Freddy
---
She‚Äôs my favorite to play especially with the hex perks she‚Äôs fun. 
---
Just higher knowledge players knew when and where to crouch. Not saying they didn‚Äôt hit traps but my map vision wasn‚Äôt great. Plus she‚Äôs fairly slow when she doesn‚Äôt have that map control. 
---
I‚Äôve had many good games with her, but after seeing some tactics from good survivors it helped me win against her. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs on my list, not good for everyone I suppose
---
They should be arresting her for not being attracted to Shirtless Myers.
---
As the biggest fucking spider-man tas nerd, holy butterballed tapdancing christ!

Nay, she dropped it too early. If he wiggled the whole time though, he would have gotten out
---
Everyone hates Plague's theme because it lasted for like 3 entire months
---
Totally understand. I just feel for survivors more than killers cause I have to deal with the toxicity wayyy more. Wether it‚Äôs a teammate dcing or a toxic killer. Or a bug or lag. I just deal with more shit as a survivor
---
Yeah, I very actively avoid camping, because as a survivor player as well I know how frustrating it can be. Unless I know there's somebody right next to me after a hook, I immediately teleport as far away as I can so I can't get called a "camper" or anything like that.
---
you're very clearly proud of it. calling yourself special, calling other people cowards for not doing it. 
---
people don't want to sit there for 3 minutes while they bleed out. it's boring, and id rather move on to another game.
---
She is still the top best killer after the nerf lol calm down
---
Leather face is worth it for barbecue, you don‚Äôt actually have to play him but you absolutely should get barbecue, it‚Äôs a great perk. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it CAN be countered, it‚Äôs still one of the best perks. 100% more blood points with good tracking is super useful.
---
Yes, buy Leatherface.
---
Monitor and Abuse isn‚Äôt really worth buying the doctor for. Meanwhile stuff like Discordance, Ruin, BBQ, Pop are worth buying the killer for.
---
i am a rank 14 killer so that is why i takes so long but it is still so long
---
no I don't play that game.
---
Then it was too early.
---
Robert england Freddy face. Please behavior ITS ALL WE WANT FOR FREDDY COSMETICS
---
I also tried Thanet phobia however I didn't really notice any difference as they just kept popping gens fast even when injured so pop seemed better
---
No, if killer leaves no change in rank. Look at the "Rank progress section" even though the bar only fills to below safety pip.
---
This is probably the most unfair add on in the game and should be dealt accordingly... by DC! No fun whatsoever as a survivor.
---
Nope I‚Äôve given points you just refuse to acknowledge them because you have an entitled mindset that lets you think you should be allowed to leave the match and screw over a player just because they‚Äôre being stealthy with a stealth killer or while using a stealth perk... oh wait a second! That‚Äôs literally the reason stealth for killers is in this game, maybe if you understood that you wouldn‚Äôt be so set on the path of ‚Äúthe killers trying something effective and I don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôm gonna quit just to spite him‚Äù but I‚Äôm done arguing with you, you clearly don‚Äôt ever see anything unless it‚Äôs what you want to see and that just makes it impossible to have a good, mind changing argument

This occurred when the game was updated and simultaneously added to Game Pass. The times remained the same.
---
On ps4? Nurse above Spirit, especially after this next patch? Not a chance in the world. You should probably watch some PTB footage, cause the nerfs are pretty significant. 
---
I've explained it before, but Nurse isn't only harder because of her general learning curve. Flicks(which is often how she attacks) and accurate blinks are way harder on analog sticks. It's physically less precise than kbm. Coupled with a lot of the add-ons being ass now, and a significant base kit Nerf, Nurse won't be in a good spot on ps4.

Very nice. Maybe Arkham Asylum and Arkham Knight versions as skins?

Shut the fuck up bitch kid

Well #1. Most killers camp. I do not. #2. What about the fact that about 7 times out of 10, Hex Ruin gets destroyed within the first 20 seconds. #3. If a killer doesn't have Ruin on a single generator takes a minute to complete and that's not including buffs like toolboxes, great skill checks, teammates, perks, etc. If 3 survivors are all on different gens while your getting pallet and window looped, the match can end within 3 and half minutes cause generator times are ridiculously broken in favor of survivors. And I rarely ever saw someone try to be stealthy, but what I did see from my time playing was everyone just rushing gens and leaving the match when they make a mistake, which was followed by calling the killer trash cause the survivor made a mistake and leaving the match. The community is so toxic that so many people have left the game much like I did 8 or 9 months ago. Now I really wished the game was changed and made fair on both ends and I hope it is and I hope I'm wrong and that there's no toxicity anymore. But so far, everyone I see on this subreddit either complains or makes memes.
---
Waiting on the shrine can take forever because it‚Äôs so RNG. So sure keep your eyes open and bank your shards, but don‚Äôt depend on it for all the good perks as you may wait forever. 
---
The only folks who don‚Äôt have Monutor and Abyse on Myers se those who haven‚Äôt leveled Doc up yet. Myers benefits so much from it. M&amp;A is also good on Hag, and honestly most killers. 
---
For the perks, get LF for BBQ. Level up Hag to get Ruin. 
---
In terms of who is Fun to play, you may like a Ghostface if you like Myers.
---
Fantastic work.
---
They're basically in the same camp as Ash.
---
Man survivors are really getting out of hand
---
No, and it isn't even about the rarity. The spread of rare items is about the same, it's just strange that out of 15 rare items across both Nea and Nancy zero have been toolboxes, while on David all but one HAVE been toolboxes.
---
&gt; but it's harder.
---
lol no

Same time less rewards
---
I've wanted dedicated servers for a while
---
And you bet your ass that those well hidden totems are hunting grounds.
---
Also the one that's right by the gen is my ruin / Devour
---
It's disgusting, it's a plague, and it's the fault of these devs. For years man, for years we begged them to punish DCers. They did a live stream about it over a year ago when they acted like they were serious about it and that they were going to punish DCers starting from then. They even put some nonsense up on their website's forum about what rules can get you banned in the game.
---
Weeks went by and people like myself started asking if this new DC policy was real because no one on reddit or on the internet at all ever said "shit, I got banned because I rage quit". I called it the invisible DC ban policy since none of us had any evidence that it existed.
---
Then months later during their 3rd year anniversary stream they announced that they were bringing dedicated servers in and that it would finally allow them to finally punish rage quitters. Well if it was only going to be done when dedicated servers were a thing, why did they act like they were already punishing rage quitters?
---
Answer: Because they lied, and never were punishing rage quitters to begin with.
---
What kind of serious game company puts out a game where a rage quitter can constantly ruin shit for all players and never face consequences? None that I can think of. Every game that's worth a little salt has a ban policy for rage quitters. It's absolutely disgraceful what BHVR has allowed in this game for years.
---
But if you somehow took advantage of their bad coding and got yourself some free skins (again, due to their own coding - not you hacking) they banned you with the fucking quickness. Know why? Because it was costing them money. It's all about money to them. Rage quitters just fucked over the player base, and was free for BHVR, so it was not a priority to deal with.
---
Even now, here and many places on the internet, people will still argue with you and tell you how wrong it is to start banning rage quitters. They'll defend it tooth and nail because they themselves have done it, still do it, and want to do it more in the future. They'll say YOU are in the wrong for wanting such scum dealt with.
---
Every single rage quitter is just one step above a hacker to me, and is worthy of a ban whether that ban is temporary in hours, days, weeks, months or permanent (if they are a serial rage-quitter). 
---
Mark my words, when this so-called "creative" DC policy by BHVR is finally released (and at this point it might be next year for all we know), there will be many people complaining about it. When you see those people, you'll know that it was them who were trying to ruin ours and many other people's enjoyment of the game with their salty DC'ing.
---
Found the survivor main, yes killer is harder to play, not early on, but definitely down the line
---
I love your Nea cosplay. My favorite outfit of hers too
---
Imagine actually thinking Survivors aren't the stronger side in present year
---
It's the bare minimum ATLEAST
---
I basically only play Survivor when I have a friend who wants to play, otherwise I just play Killer.
---
PC, my name is "A Potato".  I play most nights during the week as killer or solo survivor, but having a swf group would be nice.
---
Different killers have different music?????? I have mine turned off lmao

If you escaped but didn't do shit you need to depip

Let me find a thread I saw a few days ago, it has the most important reasons. It was just a joke btw because OP said it himself
---
Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfp71y/claudette_morel_lore_vs_ingame/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
should be an answer to top comment that was given gold and the whole thread following
---
I never condoned DC'ing, I still think its a stupid thing to do, my point is usually survivors DC because of more stupid reasons than killers, why do I need to grow a pair?
---
This game in general is really daunting to new players dude. Let the feature come out before you start speculating on possible 'rifts' harhar in the player base. 
---
You also don't need to buy the rift pass immediately. You're able to take advantage of the free track and then buy the rift pass after the fact and you get all the rewards from progress already made. 
---
That way if you're unsure if it's worth it you don't need to waste a cent. Play the game and then decide near the end of the season.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why I took up playing killer more than when I was just only playing survivor. My goals always to give people a spooky challenging match that‚Äôs still fun and chill because I know how survivor is and I like giving people a break. Aside from the occasional rage quits I get, they‚Äôre always really happy in my games and having everyone happy in the lobby at the end knowing and hearing they had a lot of fun really became sort of an addiction tbh. Seeing some of the toxicity in this sub keeps me doing it.
---
I'm confused, are you confusing archive quests with the rift?
---
Can't you just max the rift out without any quests?
---
Funny, if I see a Jane I usually wind up sparing them...(*'cause then I get to watch her leave with dat phat aassss*)
---
Bill took a spin before he died. he was like, "alright, imma head out"
---
I just can't get the hang of Huntress, I'm useless with those hatchets.
---
Small Game is such an amazing perk for me. I can't run any survivor without it.
---
I do equal of both because I genuinely enjoy both sides of the game. Even tho im a higher rank killer than survivor, i still just love to play the game as either survivor or killer!
---
Just because she's harder does not make her weaker. It's very possible to be a good nurse on console. I don't need to watch ptb footage, I've played as her, and have went against her. The nerfs are not that significant, they just made some adjustments. Once people get adjusted to the new changes, she plays almost identically to her current live counterpart, you just need to be good at landing hits.
---
I've played nurse with controller. The only thing that makes her REALLY harder on console is frame rate and that'll eventually be fixed. While mouse does definitely have an advantage with hitting, if you can predict well, it won't be an issue. If anything, nurse addons are generally better than they were before. Before there would be a few addons that get used (ones that help with range or have multiple blinks) and the rest were basically never used. But I see a use for *most* of her new addons now, the ones that I'm fond of are the ones that makes survivors easier to track and locate. Either way, nurse is STILL no where near c even with a remote, I would know.

My man knows what‚Äôs up!!
---
Something like that could work. Or maybe if there's a challenge that requires a specific perk, a very early on reward as part of the free track could be said perk as a teachable. But then again, they need to look at perks and grind in general.
---
Yeah lol
---
agreed, I never depip when I‚Äôve escaped unless multiple teammates DC‚Äôed
---
Just... Don't buy it? I can't really see the problem here. They'll have to give the possibility to change missions, so if you have "kill one surv with pig" and you do not have pig you can just change that and get a free killer thing. The pass gives you cosmetic items, if you want them you buy them, they do not influence the game. Surely it is a problem for new players, maybe they could reduce a bit prices of non licensed killers, or maybe change the shrine every 4 days instead of 7, so you'll eventually get every important perk.. Idk
---
Nice
---
I didnt start body blocking till he started tunneling, read the post maby?

True but I depipped the other day after escaping with 19k points like...come on. Just cuz I don‚Äôt get the opportunity to be super altruistic shouldnt make me depip

You can but that takes an un-reasonable amount of time or an unreasonable amount of money. The best bet is combining play time with challenges.
---
Plague is so strong in low ranks lmao
---
This is truly excellence. I started cracking up when he just straight beat Legion's ass and took his knife, lul.
---
Everyone had touched on all your points, so here‚Äôs my come ta about FF in general and other killers. 
---
1. While getting perks and grinding BP is all well and good, play the killers you find fun. You‚Äôll figure who your main is/who you Really want to play. 
---
2. Don‚Äôt worry about which killers are viable at highest ranks, etc. Right now focus on getting good as a killer and having fun in general. 
---
3. One GF playstyle  that‚Äôs emerging is to not bother with stalk. It takes time away from putting pressure. Instead you injure as many as you can, slow them down, and then sneak up as they heal or work on gens. The point is to be unpredictable and keep everyone nervous to do gens or heal. Perks that help this are Nurses Calling, Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and Dying Light (altho you can always do without DL). 
---
4. Other perks that benefit GF: Ruin, Pop goes the weasel, Surveillance (Used with Surge on small maps). These are all about gen slowdown and protection.
---
OMG didn't you got it? You can't actually read if you think I was calling myself special and not making fun of the guy.. I guess you're the "special" one here.
---
Okay then they should face 5min penalty before queueing up again. Additional DC will increase this timer Everytime. I don't get it what's wrong with it. Every online game do it but I guess you feel entitled to don't be punished for it
---
Perk idea time! Credit goes to my non-redditor friend for helping me.
---
Dean:
---
* "Refuse to Die": When the exit gates are powered, you find a newfound endurance in yourself, and the perk becomes active. When you take a hit, the perk will become inactive after *X* seconds, but for this hit and any more taken within the *X* seconds, any damage taken that would put you into the Dying State instead applies the Deep Wound Status Effect. You have *X* seconds to mend yourself.
---
* "Always Moving": You never settled down before you were taken by the Entity, and that hasn't really changed. Whenever you start working on a new generator without finishing the previous one, you get a *X*% speed increase for *X* seconds. This bonus does not apply to the first generator you work on.
---
Sam:
---
* "Follow the Beast": Just as the killer can track survivors, you can track the killer. Unless you have the Oblivious Status Effect or the killer has the Undetectable Status Effect, you can see red scratch marks wherever the killer has walked for *X* seconds. Walking excludes the Nurse's Blink, the Spirit's Phase Shift, etc.
---
I want to finish this but I can't think of many more ideas, so I might edit to add more later.
---
The perks are neat, the concept is cool, but the power is underwhelming. 
---
It sounds like he‚Äôs just Clown‚Äôs brother, which isn‚Äôt very good. His power doesn‚Äôt fit in the main power categories (Mobility, Ranged, Stealth, Traps, ‚ÄòTracking‚Äô, Exposed) and is one that can be snapped out of. I think this is a good start, but your power needs more depth and levels to it like Plague, Pig, Demogorgon.
---
IN LOW RANKS
---
I hate when my devour gets cleansed so i wouldn‚Äôt pop it against a Hag on Xbox. I will hunt you down.
---
Haha I‚Äôd be down
---
This is real ya know
---
naa, because sounds so boring.
---
Or race car nurse
---
Also in red ranks lol, he just started, it's an amazing killer lol
---
They are here XD 
---
Wish granted lol (though they still need some work)
---
Mildly disappointed it wasn‚Äôt the menu theme made entirely out of bing bongs but this will do just fine
---
Oh, I see. So basically you just want to kill her power and give survivors a built-in Object of Obsession against her.
---
No way in hell would I support this. It's ludicrous, asinine and any other word that is synonym of "ridiculous".
---
She can't see you whilst phasing, so you shouldn't be able to see her either. Especially since it's she that is taking the bigger risk by not being able to see you. She HAS to come find you to win, while survivors can stay away from her all game and still win. Yet she should be handicapped even more for your amusement.
---
You have third person view, she has first person. That's already a visual advantage over all killers for survivors. She can't see you when she is using her power and can only rely on the devs not fucking up audio sounds (like they have done on the PTB AGAIN) and, if she's lucky enough to bump against you, collision.
---
It's already enough. She's not the Wraith, and she is perfect as she is. She is what every killer should be.
---
Matching hydroflasks
---
At least on pc I wouldn‚Äôt call it smallish
---
Pizza time
---
Allow me then since i do know the ins and out of this game.
---
1. Irrelevant. Anything downs you when you are injured. 
---
2. You assume it's just iri head. 99% of people using iri head use the belt. That's 3 hatchets. If you miss 3 you need to learn how to throw. 
---
3. read nr2.
---
4. Every add on costs BP. Wheter it's 10k or 12k it doesn't matter. Not sure what point you are trying to make.
---
5. He has some pretty good insight for a lvl 26 dwight then seeing as he schooled the fuck out of you
---
Entity DISPLEASED!
---
I don't want lentils, thanks though
---
I've got a question. I know that I'm going to miss about four days, will I still be able to complete the pass? I can only play for a couple hours reach day at most.
---
It builds up his killer power, Evil Within. It's in three stages, and as you level up each stage he gains an increase in movement speed, terror radius and then can eventually down survivors in one hit with Evil Within III.
---
I had someone tell me they quit because they weren't going to get a 4K. And they were being serious. 
---
The main issue is that way too many people take this as a competitive game when that's just not what it's intended to be.
---
You filthy heathen
---
Bruce Campbell is the sexiest, coolest, and grooviest man to walk the earth
---
I said I was buying it. You don't need to sell it to me. I'm just saying. it will suck for a lot of players after the first few passes. Or for newer players who don't already have everything unlocked like the people who have been playing for years.
---
Yeah, I mean so many random bugs in this game I‚Äôm sure is what I came down to, but every time my map didn‚Äôt pop I got the offering back
---
My point exactly. Two weeks ago it was fun. Even with IRI huntress‚Äô or Prayer bead spirit or camping killers, cause everyone wanted to PIP. Now it‚Äôs just, who‚Äôs gonna be a bigger prick- Survivors, or a killer. 
---
As i said, killer camps usually spawn Survivors dc‚Äôs. So they‚Äôre just basically being annoying because of i guess Dedicated or Rank reset, or both. 
---
I usually go neutral, though i don‚Äôt play killer. But past week is testing my patience for both sides.
---
It's a dick move to begin with and ruins the fun, why would you want to know where the survivors are without hunting them yourself
---
Show us the booty
---
You feel entitled to play a game using those red add ons that are unfair and unbalanxed. 
---
I earned my flashlight too so Im gonna use it.
---
Nurse does mindgame, and survivors do need to mindgame her.
---
Take the basic corner juke: As Nurse you could blink to the corner and the survivor could come back before you press the blink button again so you can swing on them, if they don't then you blink through the wall to cut them off, they could have ran back as they seen/heard you press the blink button through the wall. That doesn't sound like much but it's still a mindgame in absolute sense.
---
Again, Spirit being slower is nothing really as she's still faster than Survs to apply pressure unlike new Nurse who has to wait for the pressure.
---
What if I say that I never miss attack after phase? I'll get the survivor faster than new Nurse, might not be by much but it will be faster. If I get a hit barely/not using phase, I will 100% get the survivor faster than new Nurse. 
---
Regardless of what Nurse can do by literally ignoring mechanics, what matters is simply how the Killer can apply pressure in the chase. Nurse has 3.5 second (As you pointed out) downtime before being at full power again, Spirit has effectively the whole chase, with both her ability, her passive phasing and actually being able to catch up survivors due to being faster their base speed. 
---
Nurse has breaks, and bad ones at that especially if they go out of LoS, at this point it is simply either guess work or you try to put them in your LoS again and that takes so much more time to do compared to all the pressure Spirit has at any one point.
---
Is that deja Vu?
---
Lmao probably the dumbest reason why it‚Äôs been removed. The topic is talking about two sole survivors that are a perfect fit into the game, you are a fucking moron.
---
Get Doctor‚Äôs Monitor and Abuse ASAP. 
---
Plague has a perk called Infectious Fright. When you down a survivor, anyone else in your TR screams, showing you where they are. That is scary shit on T3 Myers.
---
you should read rule 3 of this sub
---
Disconnecting for any reason but personal ones is stupid. You don't like the killer, perks or addons that you go up against? Well you should learn to deal with it. Killers also have to go up against unfun stuff.
---
Both Killer and Survivor disconnects are pathetic for any ingame reason (exploits and glitches not included).
---
when are all these skins coming out?
---
I think it's around 300 xp for your first match as survivor, and same for killer.
---
I didn‚Äôt say killers were weak, just saying that it‚Äôs not my fault their dumbass teammate gave me no reason not to take a swing at the hook victim again because I‚Äôm there.
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs way better than killer being host, just dead hard is now complety broken i.e. not working
---
Well I guess they can just remain generic. Saves, open exit gates, sacrifices, gen kicks ect.
---
Huntress is 110%. She is not like Nurse tier slow. She is still slightly faster than survivors and will eventually catch up to you and instantly down you.
---
randomly on killer's bloodwebs I think. it's red quality
---
I hope infectious is in the shop soon but as for the monitor and abuse I am coming closer to unlocking it on doctor but I wanna play myers because I got bored of doctor.
---
Sure but you could also not be dumb and show them your stream.
---
Relying on everyone else not to be a dick and tune into your stream is stupid, stop throwing it out there.
---
They said the stuff for the rift will eventually make it to the store. If you don‚Äôt do the premium rift then wait for the store and use Blood Shards. Or just don‚Äôt buy it because it‚Äôs all cosmetic anyway. I don‚Äôt understand why people have an issue with them giving you the option to buy new cosmetics or get a few for free? HybridnPanda did a good video in this update if you haven‚Äôt seen it. You earn your money back pretty mich if you complete the whole thing and you get 3-4 whole sets for different characters. It‚Äôs a deal that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY.
---
Who makes this shit haha this is amazing. The clown pallet stun was great.
---
Found the toxic survivor
---
You don't get my point. Don't like a meme, keep scrolling. Doesn't matter if it's over done. If you don't want to see it, don't look at it.
---
And then when you‚Äôre Tier 3 whip out Enduring and Spirit Fury to get dat hit.
---
I like how this plays out like one of those uncanny valley mobile game ads made on 0 budget.
---
That's not an insult, I love the campiness of your animation!
---
Sorry for bunching you with the killer mains. They don‚Äôt play survivors and think killers need more buffs. Like having a silver platter of 4 kills, 32k game served to them for free
---

Good to get some recognition
---
back to the pit they go
---
I did it purely because I was curious about what they were saying about me as killer.
---
I was like rank 17 at the time against a red rank, purple rank, and their rank 18 friend. They were not nice during stream and I just got shat on verbally.
---
No. Don't think it was ever mentioned, announced or even a passing thought.
---
Ehhh .. everybody will run bt and MoM and would be the same as it was before
---
The pass is not required to play the game, you just unlock cosmetics with it. New players are not gonna spend money for cosmetics and they don't need to buy the pass
---
Thats no excuse to dc play the fucking game you fucks
---
\-a survivor main
---
If you DC, you can't find a new match until the one you were in is over. If you bail on a good match, it'll take a while, but if everyone was getting mori'd, then it'll be a shorter ban.
---
So the key DOES instantly open it then
---
Holy fuck you deserve an upvote!
---
Nah there was Cote said in an interview couple weeks ago they have that in their plan. My question is is there any progress
---
Ufh I hate entitled survivors. Just because someone decides to DC, doesn't mean they get a free escape.
---
whoops!
---
I play solo too and I never bring self-care, most of the time not even a medkit.
---
This perk wouldnt affect any rank below 15 or 14. Only new players might want to use this.
---
Yeah, They could. But like I said there's only a handful of different ways they could organize that without it as Getting stale and repetitive as the dailies. The constant "saves" on the track is already getting bad enough
---
Lol sure if you want
---
I just want a accurate portrayal as well XD
---
Either new survivors that were the killers before becoming killers or a skin for current survivors that could be accurate enough for the cosplay
---
yup over the weekend.. ill post multi image renders like i did with spirit that way im not spamming reddit :P
---
Just not green keys.
---
I love how no one uses the actual hair that comes with the outfit
---
You're brave. I usually get the part of the one getting chased all match, so i have to bring deadhard and selfcare, usually also deliverance. I'll wait my friends learn to play the game and i'll stop using sc
---
Reminder that no matter what, at least one player in a normal match is not gonna have fun. It‚Äôs either the killer suffers or one-all of the survivors suffer because the side that doesn‚Äôt suffer had fun toying with the other or beating the other.
---
Not once have I had a match where the killer or survivors were all happy (even if I was happy myself there was always one upset fellow because there had to be a runt of the litter survivor or a completely incapable predator killer)
---
"Get assaulted" by a 150 pound angry fat bitch throwing milkshakes?

I have a simiral experience.
---
I just started playing the game like oround 2 days after I bought the game. We played againts a wraith that killed all my teammates and there was 1 gen left at like 70% I didnt bother finishing it, I start looking for the hatch and he found it first and he felt cocky so he downed me. 
---
He then proceeded to bring me to the hatch and close it in my face my adrealine pops and my dumbass didnt open the hatch with the purple key cause I forgot (I was still new dont bully me ,-,) I proceed to run to the doors where he downed me and played with me some more, he let me escape and then I remember I have the key.
---
I run to the hatch and escape, the endgame chat was full of salt he tought I had a green key lmao
---
Wow only 8-10 seconds? That sounds super balanced
---
It is a reduction in action speeds, so repairs and healing, movement is uninhibited. I went with 15% as to make it somewhat more balanced, but I supposed it could be bumped up to 25% or so to make it more powerful.
---
But you all depip
---
otz just made video when he discoverd this bug the whole area in the shop have this bug he also did near the basment and that happend too
---
I‚Äôm usually the player to get chased for the longest time too. Dead hard (if it works), Iron Will and Adrenaline are amazing for that. If you‚Äôre not getting chased -&gt; do gens. Depending on the killer, get healed by a teammate if you see one
---
You should blur the names. Even tho they don't really deserve it
---
I end up acting like a child cause spamming a button makes me rage
---
I‚Äôm considering‚ÄùSS‚Äù to be the best killer in the game, now spirit is the best killer in the game
---
Yo I like this but gotta stay loyal to susie
---
You'd be surprised at how many new players you see with full cosmetic sets. As broken as the match making is right now, I'm getting all sorts of ranks and play times in my lobbies. 
---
Steam took out the ability to see how many hours players have without them changing a setting, but you can tell by how they play.
---
Rage? I‚Äôm having fun just like they are. Sounds like you‚Äôre the one offended.
---
That shouldn't be an excuse to harass someone. Most people don't send hatemail just because they're having a rough day, especially if they won the match.

Unpopular opinion that iridescent heads,moris, and all the other OP add on's are there for the killer to enjoy using and have fun, sometimes we all like to feel a little op in a game. Don't see many killers instantly dc'ing against an obvious 3-4 man premade all using there own form of bullshit as if being in a premade wasn't already hugely unfair to the killer but playing with my friends is fun and I wouldn't want them to take away that feature just because it's unfair.

Killing someone who streams = getting bullied in school?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs an excuse, some people just have s general bad day then start having bad games, no body really has face online so it‚Äôs easy to chew out how someone plays
---
But that requires you to hit the bottle (which is a lot harder than hitting hatchets) then actually hitting them before they can reach a window/pallet
---
I definitely use the 2-crouch "thank you" maneuver and every single time I think, "I really hope they don't think I'm teabagging."
---
1. Stop letting random internet losers anger you to the point of posting on Reddit
---
2. You're not always going to be good at something when you first start. You want to be good? Keep playing and practicing 
---
3. Most importantly: I'm sorry... Did you say a show you hate? Delete
---
Oh yeah
---
It‚Äôd be odd to fit them onto what I envisioned to look more like the Injustice version. They could at least make skins to carry some of the motifs like the syringe glove.
---
It depends. I would say no, only because when there's Ruin, I tend to go work on a gen by myself, so if I miss any great skill checks, it doesn't cost anyone else progress, and if they miss them it doesn't hurt me. Some people will work on gens together with Ruin, but my personal experience is that people split up.
---
That said, people won't know about Ruin at the start and will still work on a gen together. If Ruin is still standing after a couple gens, survivors will likely start working on the same gens, and of course once Ruin is broken, things go back to normal.
---
When I play killer I don't use Ruin as I don't like that my perk could last 30 seconds of a match. Corrupt Intervention would be my suggestion here (Plague perk), because it reduces the number of gens available at the start of the match, making it more likely for them to group up.
---
If you want a playstyle like this, you'd probably be more interested in Friday the 13th. It's more balanced around people fighting back against the killer.
---
My favorite is when the totem is in the middle of the map next to a pallet of a popular loop.
---
Still think that's better than iridescent head, but yeah that sucks too

Killer starts setting up tent by hook

Just wanna say, you killer mains gotta practice what you preach. Survivors get fucking lobby dodged and forced to sit in 10 minute queues because you guys refuse to man up and don't wanna go against toolboxes/flashlights/Claudette/medkits/SWF etc. 
---
Get outta here with this "just play the game" nonsense because you guys sure as hell don't do it either. You don't wanna play against our SWF/toolboxes? We don't wanna play against your Spirits. It's the same shit.
---
wait... ur not a true man of culture
---
But it's retroactive?
---
I have definitely been sent back to the lobby during games and I know it's not my router/internet. this also keeps me from reporting people for DC. even though I've had survivors and killers DC at first hits/hooks and when the team is doing well/breaks ruin quickly soooo...that also sucks.
---
That's karma

Hope sucks boooo

fair point, if ruin has the possibility to not last long isnt it good on killer that can place traps around the totems to protect them?
---
Yikes. You assume everybody lobby dodges. Not everyone does.. You sound pretty mad. Are you on PS4 or PC? So you're saying you're mad you're getting lobby dodged but you'd dc against a Spirit? That's kinda funny.. If you don't want to wait in lobby just go against who has the balls to face you. Seems fair to me.

Nope

You had no way of knowing. Can't worry about every baby survivor in the process of SWF hunting.

that would mean he has the infinity stones with him
---
Yeah I played it but it's just not as good of a game mechanically, I mean I like that there's different ways to escape but overall it's one dimensional. I do get your point though
---
No problem :) i hope it gets sorted out for you soon. Good luck in the fog
---
I thing firecrackers are fine enough
---
He seems really weak then. Almost no matter how much % you give it. The problem is it doesn't really matter how good you are at slowing the game down if you have nothing to help with map pressure or ending chases faster. Those are the 2 things that make a killer top tier (or viable even)
---
With the power as you described he is a basic M1 killer with the ability to slow people down, but only until they snap out of it. He can only really keep you slowed if he chases you, but if you're in chase repair speed is irrelevant. The other 3 people will be unaffected while you loop him for days and gens will fly by.
---
I think it should slow movement speed, but not by 15% all at once. Maybe it starts at like 2% and gradually goes up to 15% the longer they run without snapping out of it, or the more you hot them with it (similar to plague building up sickness)
---
I still think he would need a secondary power to be strong tho. Something like there are 4-5 scarecrows randomly placed around the map (similar to pigs jigsaw boxs) and at any time he can become one of them (basically teleporting) but with a fairly long cooldown

Frightful would become meta in low ranks, i think

With as prevalent as Ruin, Noed, and Devour hope is, I will be running it. Even Otz was saying how strong it will be against the current killer perk meta.

It's not just the five things you listed. It's the killer being faster. The hooks being too close. The ability to just camp the hook/basement. Most maps being too open to get away. The fact it takes too long to help someone up from being downed. The fact the chance of unhooking yourself is so slim. The fact that the grass isn't thick enough to hide you if you are downed. The fact many people the game groups with you are low skilled and don't even have an offering or perks selected. The fact the killers are so experienced they know where everything is. Etc etc etc. It's not that any one is crazy broken it's just all of this stuff put together make the win rate crazy low. When you combine all this stuff together I do think it is broken.

---
Yeah, fair enough. At this rank most people tend to clump up anyways, so it's not necessary, but maybe when I'm playing higher rank people they'll be better about NOT rubbing elbows the whole game
---
This is me and my group - most of my friends are somewhat new to the game so their ranks are around the 15-18ish level.  I usually finish out each month's season at around 3 or 4 and we're constantly going against Rank 2 and 5-7 killers so we routinely get fucked lol.  I'm average at best at this game so I don't go into any of these games thinking we're going to get out alive - especially since we're on console and about 90% of the games we get matched into its usually RUIN and NOED in addition to killers that absolutely suck to go against on the console side of things.  They're usually pretty good sports about the shitty matchmaking situation but it takes about 4 or 5 games of us getting 4K'd before they usually are like "alright I'm gonna have to call it tonight - this is rough", haha.

I understand that taunting and trash talking is a mind game and is part of competition in general. I actually do like trash talking but I don‚Äôt like  trash talking someone I‚Äôm completely destroying though who is either obviously new or someone at just too low a skill level. That‚Äôs really the main issue I have with it. Hurts the game‚Äôs player count ultimately. I love trash talking on a game that‚Äôs a good competition because I consider that a part of comp play. But when it‚Äôs like an adult boxing a baby I don‚Äôt really feel the need to rub it in.

Anyone who says he's bad are the same people who can't use stealth killers properly. If you've played Myers, he's just him but needs cover to maintain advantage.

Coming from a huntress main, even a single iri hatchet is busted, as they aren't even hard to hit if you are at least decent at hitting your shots.

I‚Äôve never really had an issue with FPS on PS.. so to me it‚Äôs a stretch to assume people DC for that. The rest are a lot more common.

As a person who plays Killer more than Survivor....just let MoM get stacks from,protection hits AND Safe Unhooks ffs....its so damn useless and detrimental to try using it as is.
---
I agree with this 100%
---
Those are all things!
---
I will stand by this, I will leave if my team is absolutely garbage. I know that sounds like I'm an entitled fuck, but when everyone gets hooked in 2 minutes and farms off hooks and doesn't do gens, and when I'm the only person who last at least 20 seconds in a chase,I don't want to waste my time. They can go die while I find a better match.
---
Good huntresses will snipe you down before the 30 second mark in a chase.
---
that's shitty
---
I wanna see him vs the huntress and the nurse, huntress would have probably grab him by the foot and goo all hulk on him, while the nurse does what she does best, miss every hit
---
Is it really that bad having a single killer that can't be bullied?
---
wtf is Large fries chocolate shake?
---
Why do I have to assume they do?  STOP TELLING ME HOW TO PLAY
---
What the fuck did I just watch
---
Bruh she literally gets free hits on pallet drops. Seems to me like you don't know how to play her, although I do agree not being able to toss one over a loop with walls the height of a kiddie pool is ridiculous.
---
It's 625 BP, an amount so insignificant that it might as well not matter. In context, hitting someone twice in a chase (or once for certain killers like Spirit, Nurse, or Clown) gives you more BP than that. The compensation doesn't matter - in fact, I'd argue survivors get an even better compensation when killers DC: 5000 BP for survival.
---
It's not more likely for a survivor to depip. If a killer DCs mid match, then you're guaranteed gold in one emblem and assuming you've been either looping or doing gens you're going to get a black pip. If they DC at the beginning, sure, you depip, but that's the exact same for killers who have 2-3 DCs in the first minute of the match.
---
There should be a guaranteed no depip for survivors if the killer leaves, sure, I'll concede it, but the opposite should also be true.
---
Maps like haddon field can have infinites generate, lerys and hawkins are not very enjoyable for some killers and some maps are way to unbalanced unless you‚Äôre a top tier killer.
---
Your bias is showing. It‚Äôs not good for the game to have 4 survivors get fucked by something they can‚Äôt see, can outrun, can‚Äôt fight, and can barely hear.
---
#nerfspiderman
---
Unhook them right in front of the killer without borrowed time.
---
Waaaaahhh
---
Why not let yourself die... not sacrifice your pips even more.. not sacrifice the killers pips.. and get a tiny bit of BP in the process. You‚Äôre really only saving 30 seconds by DC‚Äôing in that situation.
---
This is even better because of the raimi suitüòç
---
Oh shit! I‚Äôm a dumbass
---
not to be a downer but, that perk is originally for a killer.

I really don't understand pallet hitboxes. Myers even swung into it as it dropped.

You‚Äôre such a boy scout when are you gonna give a guy a break
---
oh no a bunch of angry soys
---
You could be quitting just to have a longer wait in a lobby. Realistically it makes more sense as a whole to stay. And I would think.. if your 30 seconds of time are really so important to you that you absolutely can‚Äôt wait.. when you‚Äôre not gaming you must accomplish some absolutely amazing things with that level of productivity. If you don‚Äôt.. well.. seems lazy and shitty.

Hops in lockers,

Stay as a killer, unless as the other guy stated, playing with a buddy, if i feel myself stressing up on it i just take a breather and remember its just a game and find a way to have fun with it as my killers, meme builds, playing around with the survivors, etc

We've evolved to dragging our rank 20 friends to slaughter since matchmaking is now based on the average of the highest ranks in the lobby.

I honestly don't even notice crows, whenever i'm survivor even if the crows get freaked out the killer never shows up.
---
lmao who would MAKE such a thing
---
sorry, but my religion is scoops steve x susie.
---
With the slow down and pressure, I suppose being mediocre at loops is fitting enough. They don‚Äôt need to have everything.
---
You only have 585 hours play time in game so how you spent 1000+ hours "mastering" Nurse is a mystery.

I would get bubba. bbq is just too good to pass up on and it makes progressing in the game so much easier.

This is amazing. It couldn't stopped so much sooner but I'm glad it didn't. It's the best thing on this sub all year!
---
Wait? You guys are hearing the phrasing sound?!
---
What is the original meme about?
---
I don't think an action slowdown is too weak. Adding in the stipulation that another survivor has to snap them out, could make a decent enough difference. If you play Scarecrow as a control-type killer, it could work for significant slow down. Consider a build of Ruin,  Thanatophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and Relentless Pursuit (mainly just to include one of OP's perks maybe Nurse's might be better). Now you play the game with the mindset of hitting a survivor, gassing them up and moving on to the next. Meanwhile that survivor is injured and feared making them do actions extremely slow due to Thana and fear power. They are searching for a friend with decreased FoV. I will grant you that this would not make the Scarecrow top tier but it could very well be viable. And if you get a decent Ruin and the survivors dont find it until after they are injured and feared it takes them longer to clear and more chance for you to interrupt them. I think this style could at least be viable with drawing games out long enough to make up for the fact that his chase options are limited. Maybe the Relentless Pursuit perk is a good enough compensation to help chases quicker.
---
Yes it is. I don‚Äôt really think the supervillain but really disqualifies as he has the right tone and can still be used quite fittingly in the killer role for this game.
---
It doesn't increase the odds of an individual escape attempt, but it does increase the odds of escaping in the long term.  The odds of escaping normally is about 12%, if you make 3 attempts to escape and enter struggle phase.  But if you have 3 more attempts, then your odds of escape become about 21.7%.  This is assuming that there were no luck offerings, and that the last perk wasn't Up the Ante.
---
Fun fact: If you have a full party of Up the Ante, Salty Lips, and Slippery Meat, your kobe odds jump up to 95% over your six attempts.

Um, why is toxicity seemingly exclusive to survivors? As if killers can't be toxic... ok.
---
Anyways, if a killer wants to dc at any point due to frustration, then that's fine! Just like it should be fine when a survivor doesn't want to stick around for a 10 min match against an iri huntress.
---
I‚Äôve caught you!   You are mine!  Nyeheheheheheh‚Äô

RIP Amanda
---
I had one in my first match today someone just put report, he died i was last left and killer took me to hatch and i did try to get the person before me off the hook but killer was camping and they gave up struggling.
---
Because when im playing survivor i like to survive, when im playing killer i like to kill. If the main part is fun, just let the survivors escape and keep farming with them
---
Indeed

That's a pretty massive nerf. It'll still work on insidious killers, right?

To me he sounds about as good as legion. But less able to get a first hit. Idk just not very strong at all imo. OP actually gave a really good idea to fix it if you look at his reply to my comment

Repeatedly sniping someone over and over falls into harassment which is bannable. Otherwise, no, not at all
---
Hahaha the game is defintely survivor sided.
---
It was a dedicated server glitch.  The timer would show up differently on those with high ping
---
This shit happened to a friend of mine last night. Both the killer and my friend got to the hatch at around the same time but he jumped first. He was mid jump and feet in the hatch. Killer just walked over and closed it on him and it pushed him out of the hatch escape animation. 
---
So if dedicated servers actually fix that broken shit then I'm all for it.
---
I use crows all the time as killer

Not spies, but if I hear one further away or see one fly in the distance or even fly back to their rock that means someone was/is there

while i can see it some times...almost all of my dcs are either i decided to play doc or legion or spirit and people just dc or they get downed quick and dc and then someone else dcs because someone left 25 seconds into the match..

She‚Äôs not even op though...  prayer beads are up for debate, but her base kit should be left alone.  
---
In fact all killers should be buffed to spirit/billy levels.  That constant feeling of being unsafe is literally a good thing imo.  That‚Äôs how this game should be, yaknow, killers being a threat and survivors be on edge and alert.
---
'Outdated' lmao
---
I fully agree
---
Watching people sit at unsafe pallets/windows and t-bag is the funniest shit ever tho. They are so oblivious
---
VRO YOU PROBABLY PLAY MYERS ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
---
You guys seem entertaining, do you have a twitch?
---
Community: We want Balance!!!
---
BHVR: Ill give you balance when you fix this damn door!
---
To be fair, I've had several experiences where the killer is dead center in the pallet and I don't drop until they have actually started walking. They just take a step, pallet drops, and they get pushed out of it with no stun.
---
Hitboxes are like the Galactus of our universe. We need something stronger!!!
---
The next day:
---
"Masked menace seen taking photos alongside serial killers. Is spiderman finally showing his true colors?" - JJJ
---
Same it doesn‚Äôt help that i get like 3 killers a day that just wont hit me but does everyone else and then they take me to the hatch at the end more frequently than that and just to clarify I don‚Äôt show the killer where people are.
---
As a killer, I shudder to see new SWF's forming in front of my eyes.
---
As a survivor, add me on Steam! Selficide (PC, rank 5-ish, eastern time, very chill)
---
I do but I usually don't stream online games as my wifi is ass.
---
It‚Äôs not the Jedi way! He must live!
---
DUDE. BRUH MOMENT I  TOTALLY DO BRO.
---
No get him!
---
Not the poster but I personally do think Spirits a little too strong because 1. she has a vaulting animation that doesn't show she's moving meaning they are vaulting or in phase to hit you, 2. She can just bump into you find where you are meaning if she got prayer beads prepare to get yoinked off, 3. If you run away against a spirit you think is phasing you're running away from a safe area most likely meaning if she didn't you're screwed and you're screwed still because she can hear while phasing. Those are all the reasons Spirit is pretty damn strong IMO.

I suck too much at the game to give an opinion on the perks, but the idea sounds great.

Yeah you can still see insidious peeps

I somehow feel like a better title for this would of been "how killers see survivors" lmao
---
Disagree, for my experience, Spirit is one of the most interesting opponents for survivor. She is very strong, yeah, but it makes here descent and interesting enemy to play against.
---
This is the best Hex perk I've seen.

That's a pretty chill basement kickback. THIS is a real basement party though:

Aaron sucks, he is toxic and not fun to watch. And we see here a cheap noob3 copy who is also kinda toxic, but in a entertaining way and he is funny.
---
Apparently
---
I tried to search for you, there are many potatoes on steam

I understand where you're coming from. I also fail to see the purpose of making gasoline available for purchase in a gas station.

what rank?
---
This is impressively well done
---
When tf did Dwight watch the Spider-Man Training Studio
---
You'll embrace it one day
---
Sleeping seems too op, maybe with alternate miscellaneous activities like totems, chests, etc
---
A few months ago I might agree with you (not the noob3 copy bit since that's just straight up wrong - his oldest dbd vid is only a few months younger than noob3's oldest dbd vid). Watch his more recent videos though, he doesn't seem that toxic to me.
---
Bah why the downvotes I was kidding
---
Freddy is already based on the sandman BTW
---
Projared has been dead in the ground a long time before his scandal. Dig out of there and hop into 2019 while you still got time left lmao
---
This was great I subbed it was funny!
---
Fyi im not his friend I just saw this and really did find this entertaining
---
Or learn to play the game
---
Killers can be bastards but worth noting as soon as one surv doesn't escape, most SWF start crying in the afterlobby about how you are satan.
---
Yeah between being a high rank and not being able to play either side at different times of Sunday due to queue times sometimes I get off and just dont want to play again but always come back. The dcing is just the poop filled icing on the cake
---
Salty survivor main. Smh
---
Oh, I didn't know that, welp
---
not that impressive at all honestly since it was with 3 other ppl trying to help him survive if it was alone or only 1 other person it would have been more impressive honestly
---
Yeah that's just why people usually dc. It's deliberately sacrificing your bp to make a point. Otherwise they might just die and cut their losses..
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúpeople who don‚Äôt DC‚Äù bias post, seeing as both lists effect survivors the most.
---
So is are dedicated servers better or worse for killers?
---
You literally can't see anything except for her eyes, but it's a girl so hot!
---
Had a game with an iri head huntress who also had a debour hope we never found.  
---
By the end of the game I was thinking about uninstalling.
---
Thanks for subscribing!
---
It‚Äôs easily one of the coolest takes on the character.
---
who is he? what?
---
people really out here STILL only playing one side and having extremely biased opinions, the game's been out for years maybe you should switch it up bub
---
Not where my mind was going, but yeah I guess that too.
---
he's not toxic, its just that hes good at the game so people take it the wrong way.
---
Did he just abandon Kate?
---
Dont betray your waifu, specially if she has a knifoo
---
1 hook apart because there not gay
---
Unless you're ACTUALLY 9 years old, please have something to eat.

r/perfectlycutscreams

he is  shit against good survivor, but like 90% of survivors are boosted
---
Most fitting meme on this sub. Best example is the waiting time in the lobbies despite having thousands of players.
---
DBD used to crash constantly with the offering bloody party streamers. It must owe each player hundreds of thousands of bloodpoints. Devs, where are our reparations?
---
Dull totems... They're called Dull totems.
---
Billy is just like every other killer, Only he has a 1 shot and huge map pressure. They can't all have that.
---
Lol true
---
Thanks for hitting me right in the nostalgic sweet spot
---
Urban Evasion Level 4
---
I mean it is a legit strategy though as it makes doing your job way faster(especially if they don't have borrowed time or DS) plus sometimes you kinda have to because them losing a teammate could make a difference (I don't tunnel im just saying it's a legit strat)
---
Ghost Face is an A tier killer imo, he's the best stealth killer in game.
---
I don't usually rely on his stalking abilities, and simply utilize his 0 terror radius, but it's really just how you prefer to play him, i recommend checking out Otz and Tru3's videos on him, Otz uses his stalk, Tru3 doesn't

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dgkrez/playing_dbd_as_a_solo_survivor_is_aids/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I wouldn't mind cross play with xbox but I dont think pc and console should mix especially on this game.
---
The difference in how this game plays on pc vs console is worlds apart...
---
Killers more so have more control they can flick the mouse for quick hit and such that just can't be done the same on a controller. I think it would cause a lot of frustration and skill cap even among similar ranks.
---
Now combining the xbox and psn communities would be great maybe even help wait times for matches with more people.
---
Oh yeah for sure, but 50 escapes in a row is impressive regardless. It means that in all of the games there wasn't a single killer that was able to get a 4k against them (and he usually didn't even have to rely on the hatch) and when put that way it's impossible to deny that it's at least a somewhat notable accomplishment.
---
the dc problem will just be replaced with dying on first hook and there would be nothing they can do to stop that im afraid so the problem will never be 100 percent fixed well for survivor anyway although it does make killers lose points as well so I guess it does hurt them as well
---
The solution is to not play solo or with randoms in general. Join the DbD discord and find people to play with. Way less likely they DC or other shit since then they just get banned from the discord.
---
He'll be be put on mode by the Entity.
---
We all were... once...
---
true when you put it that way it sorta is neat
---
You have to stop thinking about this game as a hyper competitive game. It's not just that. Moris and instant heals are expensive and rare items/offerings to spice the game up at the cost of fairness. It's part of the fun. You should not expect every game to have the same level of fairness.
---
Moris, prayer beads, iri, instant heals, keys, sabotage builds, etc. Those are all part of the game. They are here to occasionally spike the difficulty and keep things interesting.
---
I play killer only to tunnel amd camp after it's happened to me, good stress relief
---
"I am inevitable‚Äî"
---
"And I... am *repost*"

Someones bad at huntress.
---
I have over 500 hours in huntress, she isn't the greatest on some maps, but she can hit over all the objects. you just aren't smart.
---
wait...
---
I saw and it‚Äôs not a terrible idea, but I‚Äôm more  interested in trying to make the original viable. After Demo, Freddy, Nurse, Spirit to an extent, and Hag, teleporting is already in enough kits. I‚Äôm not saying he would be top tier up there with Spirit or Freddy but I would like to think there is someway to make a kit that doesn‚Äôt rely on mobility and still able to compete against equally skilled survivors.
---
halloween event
---
Who gives a shit? This ghostface is just a clunky name, I realise they never call him that but it‚Äôs not like they call Micheal Myers ‚Äòthe shape‚Äô as much as his real name
---
Ha that was pretty cool ;)
---
another swf idiot
---
I believe he doesn't purposely go out of his way to find new killers as he's rank 1 most of the time and he's gotten way less toxic recently. So yeah make of that what you will
---
Yeah but then again so could the toxic wanna be ttv players.
---
Honestly i get that its shit people get targeted for having it in their name and I get not every streamer is a dick...
---
But it happens more often then not and the reputation is well earned.
---
Its why killers lobby hop or tunnel them down... don't make it right but I do understand.
---
Its a case of toxic breeds toxic and it just becomes a viscous circle.
---
I got 3k hours, I played plenty of killer; been R1 most seasons but honestly I find killer gameplay more boring than an assembly line job
---
I would LOVE to see him post a bad killer game. I bet he gets super mad.
---
Yup.  Happens to the best of us by the worst of us lol.  First time?  Expect it to happen again.  Not a unique post
---
It‚Äôll happen, sad to say but at least know they probably de-pipped too
---
Lol they used a pic of demons from Arkham Knight
---
He has a better gaming chair than you, obviously outplayed.
---
I dont like it but it can be a strategy for some people. You dont need to attack the other side, just move on from the game you lost.
---
Not very groovy of you.

It's less than worthless my boy.

OOHHH MA GOD!!

üéµHere comes the Trapperrrrrüéµ

K then.

4.7K hours, and too many escapes and kills.
---
Iriheads are broken as fuck and I will always DC against iri heads because this game is a game supposed to be made for fun and if I'm not having fun and my teammates most likely won't I'm not enduring that just for someone who doesn't care about a fun experiences' experience.

As someone who plays a lot of legion, the drum breaks in between the guitar parts have been drilled into my head, not complaining because that shit slaps
---
I love how that guy thought you were talking about him yet failed to realize you were stating what killers should assume 
---
Im guessing hes yellow ranks
---
What I'd you just feel like doing it?
---
But... that‚Äôs exactly what a mindgame is.  A little guessing on both ends
---
Like if a killer moonwalks around a corner but tries to make it seem like they will move forward, you have to guess 
---
You don‚Äôt NEED to run perks to counter her
---
You NEED to change play styles, people are too bold against her
---
Play immersed as hell and you‚Äôre golden , I survive a lot against her when I do this.  I also lose against her a lot, more often then not because I got greedy or got sloppy
---
Hit a gen, hear the whoosh, crawl away, even better, do a gen, if nothing for a little bit, move away and hide for a second and then get back to work when you know she‚Äôs not around 
---
I also like to work on multiple gens at once, so I‚Äôll sneak around and start a gen, get it some progress, sneak around to another gen and start it. Keep doing that and she won‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre at. Play sneaky
---
Yup.  That's why Needles are about to get reworked lol.  Enjoy that while you can.
---
Ok here's good advice to creating a killer
---
Fit them into at **least** one of these categories: Mobility, Ranged, Stealth, Traps, Tracking, Exposed (One-shot down killer) It's great to combine some of these, especially tracking because tracking as a base ability is usually terrible, so combine tracking with mobility or stealth or something. 
---
Does your killer fit into any of these? If so, how many? Out of the ones your killer may fit in, do they only lightly fit with that category, moderately fit with it, or greatly fit with it? For example, the doctor (besides his near useless illusions) has **light** tracking involved with his ability. Bad.
---
If your killer doesn't fit into any of these or only lightly fits into one, expand on the power. Another tip, typically, killers that apply status effects are always going to be the weakest unless they have more depth to their power. The Plague is a fantastic example of a killer that applies a status effect but has a great amount of depth to her power, and a downside to cleansing it. 
---
Hope you understand this!
---
Why does it bother you so much
---
new dlc announced ?
---
Okay but the shape is a legit other name for him lol. Imagine someone calling him halloween.
---
Ya it's really flawed that you lose ranks if you're straight up tunneled
---
It's a naked woman? Would you want your boss or people in public to see you looking at a nearly naked woman on your phone/laptop?
---
Well, you can‚Äôt feel like not killing everyone with the mori till the endgame.
---
Well you can play as 3 different Legion's ingame
---
Now *thats* not something I'd expect to read on r/deadbydaylight
---
Sleeping on, not with.
---
I know, I have legion
---
Obviously I agree with you.  
---
After reading that first ridiculous statement it's pretty clear you don't possess a mind to he changed period.
---
What if the killer wanted to have a fun time with the game he paid for?
---
The dweard head makes him cute.
---
do you not see the above scores?
---
that's every single match I played today
---
today is an average day for me
---
Um, it's NOT a naked woman.
---
And congrats on the liberal overdramatizing by using the word "nearly" (which is also Fake News, as she is clearly, mathatically, "mostly" covered up).
---
Nothing to see here
---
The biggest concern I have and we have seen during events is players doing these objectives and then dying on hook.
---
Going to be people doing the 2 gens and surrender to killer just to get to the next one.
---
Get safe saves... borrowed time farm here we come...
---
Any objectives that have to be done in a single match will be crazy...
---
2 heals prepared for a teammate who just follows you all around hoping to get that done instead of doing gens then suicides...
---
And the list goes on you get the idea...
---
I could see this being like past events do objective get out repeat making it insane for those who just want to play and progress naturally.
---
Ghost Face, it's so satisfying to throw a survivor team into absolute chaos
---
Idk there‚Äôs just a reason they called him the ‚Äòcannibal‚Äô instead of them leatherface‚Äô same as for ghostface. The scream or the the ghost sound better
---
Well thats what i thought, cause your tag is Legion. :D Me and 3 Friends already are named The Legion with the icon, we just wanna make the meme happen
---
Freakin beautiful üò≠üò≠
---
vs Manbearpig
---
Thanks for the feedback! My main fear was getting shit for making the killer too powerful so when I wanted a killer to give the broken status effect I was scared to make it any further.
---
I got 3K hours in.  It's just that 2.9K of them are survivor...
---
Doubt it since you're   
---
1 - still getting camped in "rank 1"  
---
2 -  still making biased opinions  
---
3 - still not seeing camping and tunneling as a viable strategy
---
That should not be the solution though should it?
---
Oh, so you're trolling. Got it.
---
What in the goddamn-?
---
2v8 or some sort of new gamemode, i know its hard to do because of matchmaking but I feel like they should try something like that.
---
if not maybe a kyf overhaul with more settings, like gen speed, how many gens, more players/killers, etc
---
looks like someone got schwacked
---
I will but I can‚Äôt change my name on Xbox :/
---
Ban system would literally have near 0 effect but ok
---
Ill do survivor if its an easy daily like saves, sabo, gens. Other then that only if I'm playing with a friend. I don't find solo survivor fun. With a friend we can goof, coordinate and share in our stupidity
---
many times in a row!
---
Jane Romero has entered the chat.
---
Obama's last name.
---
Yeah... the community has devolved a bit...
---
The Ghost for sure was gonna be his name. Funny thing was that it was his name when he was leaked, and his dlc description today still calls him The Ghost one time.
---
When you barely have the killers in the ‚ÄúInstant Classic‚Äù category so you didn‚Äôt even realize there were other songs lmao
---
I dont know about all that, its just Julie painted.
---
Perfection
---
Don't fear! But instead of giving more status effects, add something new to the power. Because The Plague can either keep you injured the entire game (which is great when combined with certain slow-down perks) or have machine gun hatchets for a limited time. There's a big downside to countering her power by cleansing it, and that downside is, well, the corrupt purge. She doesn't **just** have the vomit and broken status effect to apply, which is great!
---
Unless they're at a pallet
---
Lmao I swear if you're trying to say Billy is OP please delete your account or remove yourself from this Subreddit.
---
She is 100% the opposite of boring! LOL!
---
1- what's your steam profile, you can join a lobby to see my rank as proof; we can KYF together if you're not scared
---
2- yeah, all opinions are biased
---
3- fine, they're viable, the people who use them are still assholes
---
I have twice as many yellow flashlights on my claudette than any other item.  I'd say that 75% of the chests I open give me one when I play as her.
---
It's like the game *wants* me to be a toxic claudette.
---
Just like Iri Heads
---
Hmm, I might change the power a little bit, thank you for the feed back once again!
---
Now he‚Äôs over the top??  Since when? 
---
That pressure makes this game fair. Because without it, regular m1 killers cannot win at all against seasoned survivors 
---
And what I mean by that is, everyone does multiple gens at once.  That killer cannot possibly be everywhere.
---
Spirit is good at downing people once she‚Äôs injured them, so that‚Äôs her strength, mixed with some good mobility 
---
Nurse is about the same, good pressure like spirit
---
Billy is super fast around the map, good for that pressure you need
---
Everyone else (besides maybe Freddy and huntress in certain situations) get gen popped.  No matter if they outplay a survivor or not, the moment they chase everyone else does gens at opposite ends.
---
Self care, Deliverance, Urban, and Iron Will or Left Behind. Play selfishly, gens come first, altruism second. Be aware of your surroundings, avoid confronting the killer. Good luck friend
---
That would be cool
---
any reason, or just people being salty AF.
---
No problem! Get creative :)) Cause even if it's not the best power, if it's a fun power that's unique, people will like it.
---
Killer: Breathes

Survivors: Enjoy your ban baby killer my dad knows McCote

Usually the ones that hate on Spirit either can never escape a Spirit, or can't grasp the concept of how to play her.

Seeing you justify your dc is hilarious.

I make that same noise when I see Michael has been watching me work on a generator.

If that was true why, then why is sometimes fun to play against why is spirit always unfun?
---
Ok
---
this is going into my saved comments list
---
thank you
---
In their defense it was an automod
---
Neither of you are the creators, so why does it matter?
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
A rank 10 killer is a new player?
---
Still though, it was funny as fuck
---
Legion is Canadian, so you really are a dumbass here.
---
if the huntress has the skill of the average reddit killer then actually yeah you‚Äôre right.
---
These stats tell me that A) you either got incredibly unlucky today or B) you suck at being stealthy when you need to be
---
Fake, literally everything would have hit him. He also would've gotten DC'd on.
---
Maybe you haven't gotten this bug, but ever since stranger things, there's been a couple bugs that disconnect every player in the lobby.  They're pretty rare, but they suck.  
---
The killer's screen shows that all the survivors DC'd and the survivor's screen shows that the killer DC'd.  When this one happens, you get the points you earned while playing.
---
The other bug disconnects you and takes you straight to the main menu.  You lose all items, add-ons, and offerings.  You also de-pip and get 0 points for the match.  I don't know if this one affects the whole lobby or not, but I've had this one happen more frequently...and it's not my connection.
---
What?
---
It doesn‚Äôt consume items, addons, or offerings. Go for it ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Well, maybe now that dedicated servers are here they will get more strict
---
I wasn't aware of this, but I also have been absent forever.
---
wow what a calm, rational, totally unbiased response you just made
---
also weird that you brought up perks when I never mentioned them? 
---
your viewpoint is so unbiased and internally consistent wow you're a fuckin sage mate
---
What a nice guy.
---
It's so much easier to play Killer than Survivor because you don't have to rely on others and can easily make the game winnable by just bringing the right bullshit.
---
I don't blame survivors for being toxic to you because you are apparently aiming to be toxic ON PURPOSE to make other people's games worse.
---
His power is just clown 2.0
---
This.
---
No it's not.  Flashlights are INSANELY EASY to avoid and if you can't just look straight up then why are you playing this game?  You can't avoid a Huntress hatchet if they are actually able to aim.  Like the things you are bitching about are countered *by just flat being better at the game.*
---
YOULL GET YOUR HEAL WHEN YOU FIX THIS GODDAMN GENERATOR
---
Of course I cleanse totem, but you can't do all of them by yourself. Some totems are behind a corner inside a cornered wall with corners around it.
---
I didn't mention anything about DCing
---
At least it wasn't last game where, if you are wondering, a hillbilly destroyed 3/4 survivors ( I was the last one alive) I sneaked over to the exit gate (he closed the hatch and we had 0 gens done) I was opening the exit gate and right as soon as it was open, I heard the heartbeat and then the hillbilly chainsawed me, dragged me over to a hook, and killed me.
---
Oh. I didn't know. Ive only been playing for a few months now üòî
---
If you think Julie is under age, then you do realize you're calling Frank a Pedo? IDK about you but devs would not want to put a pedo in the game. Thus that means Julie is not underage.
---
MOST killers in this game are.
---
Just dodge the pallets, it's not that difficult.
---
Even I can make dumb statements too.
---
sooo? what is that supposed to tell me?
---
She does actually, if you blind her while she is phasing she will come out of phasing. Just really hard to do since she is invisible xD.
---
"His one shot and high mobility pushes him over the top of other killers"
---
Yeah what I'm really saying is "BILLY FUCKING OP"
---
Waste of time talking to you.
---
It's so bad that there have been a couple times the killer was coming directly toward me and I just fucking waited for a skill check before I started running.
---
If only Legion wasn't dogshit on the killer scale of interesting and actually competitive, then maybe ...
---
People call it Garbage even though it physically can't have the numbers go any higher than 9%. At 10% a Survivor would run at the same speed as Huntress/Hag, so higher than 10% and you could outspeed two Killers.
---
"a single killer" that single killer is played 50% of all games at high ranks
---
Didn't say I don't care about the killers fun. I want the majority of the players having fun, not just 1 side. I won't try and sometimes won't play. SoloQ sucks enough but these asshole killers who don't think about the fun of everyone are just selfish. If a killer is being selfish, so can I. Why do I have to care about their fun if they don't care about mine?

Bc with nurse she has blinks. Were you can see at least see where she is while teleporting, giving you a chance of countering her. Meanwhile with spirit, she is consistently invisible while phasing, giving you no idea where she‚Äôs gonna hit you from. 
---
Tbh even I had that mindset. At times I would get excited hearing the nurse‚Äôs squaks opposed to hearing the whizzing of the spirit. It‚Äôs ok dude ifs it too challenging. A lot of people think she‚Äôs op.
---
I mean you didnt do anything, I dunno what you want?

It‚Äôs my dream to have Cindy as a survivor in DBD.

Nobody said it was fair.

We're human. People DC, he is just explaining his thought process as to why he might do it
---
How am I aiming to make the game worse for others? (Not trying to debate, honestly curious for you opinion)
---
so?
---
He is just trying to eat da cabbage
---
Same on both accounts, and there's only so many times I can activate farm before it's boring and I just want the game to end you know so it's really fucking annoying, especially as someone who basically never DC's.
---
&gt;Something that will never happen because you can then modify and change the game files to the benefit or detriment to the game when you connect online again because there is no way for the servers to validate those files.
---
These files are already stored on bE's servers. You can just prevent any exp gain on LAN to prevent cheesing. It's not impossible, it's very easy.

I never felt so much hate, but so much love at the same time. For this video.

Tunneling a killer will only lead you to death. And if you wanted to show how bad tunneling is, then you should've shown killer's score.

Seems someone just got rekt several times

Man I'm 2 weeks sober on medical advice from my doctor, my liver is oof not great, and rn I don't have enough spare cash lying around even to soften this fuckin terrible sobriety with weed, I WANT IT TO GET WORSE. I want everyone to feel just as frustrated as I do. Bring on the trolls, bring everyone, I got all sober night!
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the leaks
---
we all started somewhere
---
All it takes is one person running it for the whole SWF to reap the benefits. If he has a map don't even need SFW, he can literally show his whole team where every totem is with no comms whatsoever.
---
People will run it
---
Let's be real her, if the spirit is vaulting then she probably sucks. She's too slow to traditionally loop to any great effect. If she's ever in a position where she needs to vault, it's either a) a really strong loop like Macmillan's building where she can't catch you off the vault mixup anyways or b) she would just be better off phasing and playing that mixup. Spirit has a sick vault but she just straight up shouldn't use it 99% of the time.
---
I was the victim of an epic NOED gamer the other day and died on my first hook. The entire time a survivor was crouching behind a pillar as the killer waited around me (NOED had been broken by this point, as  an aside). I said to my friend, "I don't really care if I die, but they should just make a play and try to get me down or leave." After I was sacrificed and the killer left they walked over and picked up my medkit lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure run and feng actually have the same face, when you look at colorized and reformed rin renders if looks like they started with the one female Asian face they had and just reworked it into the face we see on the spirit, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the legion faces are also re-used textures that have been modified.
---
Some people just like to trash talk the opposing team in a PvP game. Cathartic or something, i guess. I have some friends who will say insults in PvP.
---
They won't directly say anything to the enemy team, though.
---
She is doing a cosplay and not asking you about what you think of her body. It's not hard minding your own business, but you're an asshole with some low IQ arguments.
---
would of
---
ikr lol loved pig when i was around 14-15+ ranks since she was funny to get chased around but this killer was red-purple rank and i got 2 jumpscares in same match lol was fun
---
&gt;Suggestion
---
I hate when they dc when you're trying to save them, even if you have bt if they're being camped or taking a hit on the way to the hook, so not only are they screwing your team, they do it when the killer will easily go for you.
---
The killer can only be at one generator at a time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You do know that right?
---

Huntress, I love it when they freak out after missing a hatchet at close/mid range lol.
---
I'd love to see Chester and Larry from IJFWY as Killer and Survivor respectively
---
Well the killer still got their kill
---
**well that and I didn‚Äôt say I always do this, I only do this when it‚Äôs 5 seconds into the match and the Killer is Bee-lining towards my location and, no matter what I do, walk and crouch away (to avoid making scratchmarks), loop, locker hide, not touch the gen at all when they run to my location without any evidence I was there, I still get caught and hooked, regardless of wether or not it‚Äôs a new killer or god, they perfectly predict me despite results screen saying they are rank 20, and I get hooked, with every rescue attempt always resulting in me getting unhooked in front of killer and out back on because no one who saves me runs borrowed time, being killed early regardless as a result since I‚Äôm unhooked to phase 3 and put back on, or no one comes to save me.**
---
Why should I stay when I know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs gonna happen? Not once have i had a match where I wasn‚Äôt guaranteed to get away from the hook if I‚Äôm hooked early on because of forced outside of my control. Not fucking once.
---
cool
---
This is the map to they key
---
Funny enough, I have the game for pc and PS4...
---
Though I enjoy debating these things on reddit, I‚Äôve done this same debate to death. We will never agree so I think it‚Äôs best we agree to disagree 
---
Go against your future spirits though
---
Vicious cycle it is
---
Watching a Baby Billy repeatedly slam into a wall is pretty adorable.
---
Gamers rise up.
---
are you capable of not defending Trump at every turn even when it's not called for, or are you just programmed too well?
---
How are we supposed to know?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the progress is tied to your psn, but if it‚Äôs not we gunna have a riot
---
It has Legion in it so here take my internet points.
---
The thing that people forget about Spirit is she's slow af outside of her phase with a decently long cooldown. She gets punished harder than most killers by making a mistake out of her phase and if you gain some distance you can just sprint and hold W for a very long time before she gets to play a mixup again. The tradeoff is that she gets to play a mixup at almost every loop once she finally catches up. 
---
It's just like playing vs a no addon Nurse. Yes, you can't just loop normally and yes, she gets to play a mixup way more frequently than other killers. But if she misses, she's stuck in fatigue and you gain a ton of distance (more than she can catch up to with 2 default blinks most of the time).
---
The person who made this could‚Äôve used any other template but no he‚Äôs the one who brought politics into it
---
XD even more reason to give pre killer cosmetics or actual survivor characters
---
I loved this movie, as soon as I read up to 'cross' I knew where this was going
---
Any time I'm in a 4 man swf group we just dick around and try to get the killer to play along with our crazy game. We once got a Huntress to play a game of duck hunt with us with all of us running back and forth and her trying to hit us. She wasn't very good, but it was fun.
---
Baby Billies. The keep hitting obstacles with the chainsaw.
---
Yes, and this is a repost I saw this like two weeks ago
---
I didn‚Äôt watch you but you shouldn‚Äôt seek validation from strangers. If you enjoy making content then keep doing it. Eventually people who appreciate you will find you :) never stop being yourself or being creative though. Hope you get all that you dream of
---
Some streamer once said(paraphrasing, ofc):
---
"Why not DC? You don't want to play against Spirit? Just DC, move on to the next game."
---
This was either Otz or Tru3 I can't remember which but it hits the nail on the head why people do it so much. There is basically no negative aspect for the person DCing when they can just find a more fun game instantly anyways.
---
Servers will help with this
---
This is SO good! Props to the creator.
---
I was thinking Jake maybe but I like your idea better
---
damn dude, they're buffing survivors again?
---
Which killer could do the best Joker laugh?

Holy shit lol

By what metric, exactly?

The only keys I ever find are broken

People that still complain about Legion, God damn clowns
---
lol it happens, he had a lot of good points, at the end of the day it's all subjective
---
Gonna cry?
---
Self-caring on a map corner
---
As an aside, do you think a killer who brought his own hook would be viable? One that breaks after escape/sacrifice.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because she just naturally draws your eyes‚Äô attention ü§î
---
Small game already finds all the totems though, You have a point with the map but if we're just looking for totems with our SWF, small game does it fine.
---
I'll typically only do it if you're about to go into the next hook phase, because why not at that point?  And hopefully the person i take off will have DS or dead hard.  Hell, maybe even sprint burst or something..
---
But the last time someone did it to me, it was a Steve, and his reasoning was:  BuT i hAd bAbySittEr
---
I was like, "oh, you mean the perk that doesn't help me at all when the killer is literally standing beside us both?"
---
He was like, "i cAn tEll yoU nEEd mOre eXperiEnce iN tHis gAme Noob."
---
No I'm not continuing endlessly.  I just wanted to specificy that everyone I've attempted to have this debate with that initially claims her as not being too powerful never provides an actual counterplay option that doesn't include running Iron Will once I go into the specifics about how hopeless screwed you are against her once she gets a hit on you.
---
Seeing your response I'm glad to see you also don't dispute this your stance is simply well yeah but I'm okay with that I think she should be strong enough and have that in her kit.  This is something I can respect by the way.  I definitely disagree with it i think it's unhealthy for the games balance personally but can respect the fact that you're being consistent and not pretending there is strategy involved to beat that scenario once she hears you.  You're just at peace with it and appreciate it as a strong part of her kit.
---
Then I got layed I am no longer a Virgin

&gt;suggestion

as we all know, you are incapable of finding a new match within a few minutes. a hook suicide ruins any ability to play and enjoy the game for eternity

Hiding in lockers, dropping pallets out of chase, dropping hooks, BASEMENT TIME!, dying

I'm not sure honestly, I just know I couldnt use it but you know what, it could have been because I didnt remember my password.

I'm a rank 4 ghostface main, going against rank 1s and 2s I use common add-ons and do fine lol, you just need to learn to use the power on certain instances only

Survivor: sees Ruin
---
Killer: o dear you have seen it
---
They need to make the thumbs-up/thumbs-down mean something. I always thumbs-down people who DC even though i know it doesnt mean shit. I feel bad for killers when half my team DC's. I know it pisses them off too. It ruins the experience for everyone and it sucks there is no punishment for it. 
---
Personally I really only think DCing should be punished. Tunneling and face camping, yeah it sucks but it's mostly baby killers and they end up just hurting themselves most of the time.
---
The other night I faced a killer who got a 4k yet still sent a salty message to my teammate whom he killed first
---
You're correct. It's ***a*** solution. But it shouldn't be ***the*** solution.
---
They really need to make an add-on loss prevention system.
---
If more than 2 Survivors disconnect, you get to keep your current add-ons.
---
It should also work same way with Survivors. If Killer or any more than 2 Survivors disconnect, you can keep items and add-ons.
---
Dude, you're a gem and I fucking love you. That is the most reasonable and legit response I could hope for from a survivor-main.
---
Tunneling is shitty if you do it to death, but it's not always intentional. Especially when there are like 2-3 Claudettes in a match or 2 Steve's &amp; 2 Nancy's. Hard to tell who you were just on.
---
Camping is straight bull shit. Camping hooks and downed survivors. I'll occasionally stop for a few seconds to bait if I'm using insidious, but if you're not always on the move you have zero chance of no escapees.
---
Trapper is pretty much the killer that nobody hates. It's always nice to see a Trapper
---
It‚Äôs never too late! I suggest putting an alarm on Tuesday whenever the reset time is for you. You can check in game or here. I‚Äôll always be posting :)
---
Maybe he‚Äôs saying legion is the weakest killer?
---
I just find it fun... and just another killer that you need to mentally change to play against
---
She is someone you DONT want to get caught against.  Someone who you want to be careful from the start 
---
It‚Äôs not impossible to lose her while injured, but definitely harder.  But yeah... that‚Äôs my stance
---
The counter play is being a good sneaker and also having good awareness of your surroundings .  Working on gens and figuring out where she is or may be vs where you are and where you can be.
---
All of his attacks should have been locker based
---
well, maybe, but thats still not true
---
Nope.
---
That Pig bit was absolutely flawless. 
---
Jesus Christ im still wiping away the tears
---
Well, there are 4x as many survivors in a game, so...
---
How did you get this leaked footage of the new Spider-Man chapter
---
He will. He has to.
---
I mean, you could say that about a lot of the killers in the game already, particularly Freddy
---
Did he mount Ghostface?
---
I do, yeah. Both to warm up and to de-stress. It's a bit confusing to switch the mentality around though. I'll end up starting the match as killer and thinking, "Hey I should do those gens!" (don't sabotage yourself, kids) Same with survivor, I'll be running Bond, and upon seeing a teammate I'll go, "Time to die, pal!"
---
If you don‚Äôt mind to answer this question, but what program did you use to create this create piece of music?
---
And rainbow six siege
---
Eh, it‚Äôs debatable, personally I‚Äôd only put LF below legion, but everyone has their own tier lists.
---
it was a Noob3 reference haha. He probs like playing as nea the most
---
I guess the affect would completely counter Thanataphobia.
---
I‚Äôd settle for skins of these guys since they are fairly basic in design and killing power, CFTBL hag, Frankenstein‚Äôs trapper, mummy vommy mommy, legion Dracula, wolfman clown. And it would fit with the wraith already having a *phantom of the opera* themed skin ‚Äúangel of music‚Äù
---
Wraith

---
This should either be deleted or put into the shitpost area. I have never seen such a dumb post in my life
---
Take a perk that helps you lose the killer.
---
You say this but Jeff mains have it worse and you know it
---
That would be pretty cool, too
---
I really wouldn't mind either way, as long as something for them got added
---
I am actually fairly certain that the flashlight will deny the Spirit's ability to phase if shined on before-hand, similarly to Nurse. Will need to test, but I feel like I've noticed this before. 
---
I am against showing her location though. Simply disabling her power for a short moment is sufficient.
---
Ace is the quietest character along with tapp my dude
---
Excuse me. That is up gown.
---
I'm the survivor who can't properly use the flashlight, so I end up clicking it in a panic and just running like a fool. There were a few times I tried really hard to just stand my ground and practice, but the killer grabbed me quick. Bet it felt good for them to catch this flashlight clicker, though lol.
---
Those 2 things don't belong in the same universe.
---
Fair point I was just thinking where this Ghostface is quiet during gameplay
---
Feel like Frightful needs a little something extra like perhaps a temporary boost to terror radius by 8/12/16m on their failed skill checks.
---
Yes but they also increased the overall time to crouch at the same time. A QoL change apparently warranted a nerf.
---
Don't bother dude people like him always say shit when they dont know what they're talking about
---
This makes me want a new game mode that's pretty dark (dark enough to where you can see maybe only bright parts of an outfit on a killer n survivor) and takes place in a large but tight corridor map, with a few lanterns and lit rooms of course so it isn't too hard to find survivors for killers, but the game mode would basically to just simply survive a certain time limit until the exit gates power on. 
---
Basically: spooky hide and seek so killers can be scary christmas trees
---
I do this all the time.  Close the hatch for the points, then let the survivor escape through the door. They get more points and so do I.
---
Ugh this is so annoying. Also to add onto this (and maybe someone can explain?), why do some players *immediately* try to unhook themselves, get to struggle, and then let you unhook them? I see it often enough that I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs all people going for achievements or inexperience, but it‚Äôs like...why throw away a life like that?
---
Isn't the new cosmetic basically old her? She sure looks older.
---
Then again, it doesn't take long to down someone after they get off hook if you can actually use your time wisely. Also, I'd understand with your second point them doing that if there is someone dead and there are perks, aswell as if this killer is a very good killer that can go around and make sure gens don't get done well. I understand where you're coming from, and it is definitely a pain in the ass, but don't blame the killer, blame the survivor. Personally, as a killer main, I don't tunnel, and I punish the person farming FOR farming their teammates, because in my mind it isn't fair that the person that didn't want to be farmed gets farmed and dies.
---
Having Urban Evasion races.
---
She could have muddy hair and face with the white stripes and an old poncho over her top, I also thought a legion-nea would be cool with her wearing a stolen jacket (maybe she borrowed it from frank when they dated and never gave it back) and a legion mask on the side of her head, or maybe broke in half so it‚Äôs only the ‚Äúsmile‚Äù half. Trapper Dwight with a shirtless overall and bone glasses, billy-jake with torn wifebeeter and plastic billy mask.
---
If dedicated servers cause game changing bugs or glitches then I don't blame people for hating them. They're just gonna make people dislike the live build more. Personally I think I'm just gonna play something else for a bit and wait til this mess gets sorted out
---
I would even put, Wraith, Trapper, Leatherface and GF below that
---
Doctor doesn‚Äôt laugh like joker, he laughs like doctor hibbert
---
You can turn off the chat if the survivors were noticeably toxic during the match. No need prolong the "pleasure". This helps since you end up remembering more of the people that actually enjoy this game after talking to the chill survivors in the chat.

because if youre not having fun its a way to escape easily
---
I‚Äôm pissed I just commented this as my first thought and then saw this reply
---
I think there some fun to it. She has a little bit of Tier 1 Myers spook to her. She can catch you off guard on a gen. Some spirit plays may think you‚Äôre at a pallet and will haphazardly swing at it. 
---
After the PTB goes live, expect more Spirit mains.
---
Good old Jetix's Spiderman series
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a good idea
---
Hopefully everything will be backwards compatible.
---
My perk, adrenaline heals me one full health state as soon as the exit gates are powered, so if she closes the hatch or the last gen is done, I get a 150 percent speed boost and a health state.
---
Omg! I wasn't expecting that! Lmfao!
---
Entity's True Form
---
Oh
---
And I bet you're the first to die, too.
---
they dc'd immediately yes
---
What if you wanted to play a normal survivor game but killer said iri heads
---
She encountered a bug in which she had infinite sprint burst throughout the whole match.
---
Welp I do see that, there's the innocent and there's the guilty ones.
---
I'm not complaining that it's op, like I said. I hate facing the same perk every single game, my games feel mundane. Did you even read my post?
---
The new tracer
---
You see, people say gen grabber spirit is the strongest killer build, but I think iridescent head is strongest because all survivors die without needing to hook them!
---
The only thing I can think of was pre-nerf DS, which let you use it sooner if you were the Obsession.
---
Now, there isn't any.
---
But if you're going to play dbd exclusively to win, not to have fun, you're probably in the wrong game. I didn't say that you shouldn't have fun trying to win, but when you're putting winning above fun on dbd, you're probably not playing it right.
---
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, YEEES

I think i was in a game with the same ghost race

I legit got so mad yesterday because a killer decided to tunnel and camp me because I looped him for 3/4 of the game. Then one of his buddies who was playing survivor that game said I deserved it for running an infinite. I was like, "what? how was I running an infinite if he had entity blockers and bloodlust and managed to down me?" Then his 1000 IQ logic after I explained to him what an actual infinite was and he answers back with this, "Okay that's not an infinite, but you still deserve it for looping."
---
I legit stopped playing for the rest of the day.
---
Ok... so do you downvoted anybody that only starts playing DBD for like a month and only began branching from the usual only play as trapper and only can really afford one killer... okay I should stop nobody actually cares about what I‚Äôm saying tbh
---
nono, I mean Myer's Hospital Skin
---
I only think it‚Äôs really in Europe, I‚Äôm in Ireland so hard luck mate
---
Man! That looks dope!
---
Well Wraith is honestly pretty great at the low ranks because they don't know what to do vs anybody haha
---
But yeah, Wraith is unfortunately terrible
---
Fucking end me
---
Its the price of using those perks pretty much. Nowadays most killer obsession perks actually help the survivor with bonuses, making the killer want to avoid them or the crippling fear of seeing  the killers aura whever a generator is completed
---
Your progress is stored on their servers so as long as we can still play it on the ps5, we should be able to access it. I think destiny had a similar thing so you could play the same character on ps3 and ps4
---
Why is Clown music S tier? Legion and Demogorgon beat it easily.
---
I think it's gonna slow down soon. But that would be cool.
---
Map wide silence, the most horrifying sound possible
---
Also you get 1500 bp if you escape as the obsession and 500 of you die so that's neat
---
You can buy the game for 6 bucks on cdkeys
---
You literally called them a snowflake the comment before. I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre a troll tho
---
Licensing exists... just like they did for every other character who isn‚Äôt an original IP of DbD
---
look at them fingers tho
---
Lets hope they get it right after the 100th time.
---
Nah this would be great for a wraith.
---
Uh no the outfit is from the first Halloween movie when she‚Äôs 18 and on her way to school
---
I'm just saying words are more common than most green or yellow add ons from my experience. I will see many more of them than bloody party streamers which are green offerings.
---
Again people can stockpile 50-plus of these with a couple weeks grind and play every single match with iridescent heads or a purple flashlight.
---
It eliminates all risk or value of high-tier items. I mean I've encountered quite a few derankers who have hundreds of these across all of their characters and play the game just to ruin fun for the other side.
---
TBH now that i think about it was to just let the survivor have their aura shown no matter if they healed or not because of how shit protection hits are, since as a killer main i wasn't pissed of since they either have to be injured the rest of the match or have their aura shown and risk it. Including the fact it was only basic attacks, using your power that would contain injuring the survivor wouldn't give you a stack. Either way it was somewhat broken on each side.
---
By itself, being the obsession as a survivor doesn't really do anything. The obsession mechanic only interacts with survivor &amp; killer perks, and that one new key add-on (Unique Wedding Ring or something). All of Laurie's and the Shape's perks are obsession perks because they have this thematic going on. The only benefit you can have for being the obsession is having the increased range on Object of Obsession. On a side note, survivors can see at all times whether the obsession is in a chase or not, which can serve as some important situational awareness at times (for example if you are playing against a stealth killer, knowing that the obsession is in a chase could encourage you to do a risky action that you wouldnt do otherwise). All of Shape's perks function in a way that reward him for ignoring the obsession which is interesting. However, Spirit's Rancor is the polar opposite of that idea so if you find yourself being the obsession you should definitely keep an eye out for this perk, as it constantly warns you throughout the game.
---
My guess is the whole "oh wow I get to M1 even more"
---
What is this meme originally called ive been dying to figure it out
---
That's a good point. Thanks for the thought out comment. But those ultra-rare add-ons that are supposed to be game-changers can be used theoretically every match if you stockpile a bunch of wards.
---
(Really) Shortly, it is because how annoying and boring mending yourself gets 5 mins into the game.
---
Y‚Äôall forget the one killer who would beat him, huntress.
---
Groovy
---
Oh God. I had that wiggle progression horror about 2 or 3 times already. It hurts so much!
---
Failed pallet stun... Classic.
---
Im not sure Legion is my favourite killer to use and when I see everyone say he is so shit feels bad but hey at least they might get a buff if people keep saying it so keep at it everyone
---
well since theyre on the hook id say they were probably getting chased, and then dying
---
I follow r/metalgearsolid so this resonates well with me
---
PS4 itsRafii, US, looking for SWF OR KYF ppl, just fellow ppl of the fog to play with. A mic would be preferred. ( include your from reddit or dbd cuz then I'll be confused on who you are lol)
---
I understand that but then when you think about it, isn‚Äôt that the point of legions perk so that he slows down progression. I understand it can be annoying to sit there but if you didn‚Äôt have to his perk would be useless
---
Please give me the source of the original :D
---
HAVE ANOTHER FUCKING SILVER BAHAHAHHAHAHA THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER, AND I COMPLETELY IGNORED IT YESTERDAY ON YOUTUBE HAHAHHAHA

Iridescent heads are legit cheating.
---
Cheating that's legit ;)
---
I see people say ‚Äúoh legions so shit‚Äù but whenever I play legion I usually get 2 or more kills (which considering I‚Äôm fairly new isn‚Äôt that bad)
---
„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥
---
Hes just lucky myers wasnt there
---
If not, I will be sad but also hope it has inspired other horror games.
---
I feel like you play a totally different game.
---
Like, Dead Hard wouldn't be proceed, (if it was, then you're missing one hatchet if they can time it well.) Sprint Burst takes care of one hatchet or you wait and down them 2 seconds later, vaulting 3/4 times means the Huntress gets a free hatchet hit, Huntress should ALWAYS aim for the lower torso to erase crouching discrepancies, (else play the loop out if they use cover) MoM hasn't been relevant at all since it was nerfed, BT just means either a trade or a long-ranged tunnel with an instadown hatchet, and getting insta'd is in the same vein of bullshit, which is now getting nerfed out this update.
---
You're being really obstinate here, defending something that pretty much everyone has agreed for months is at best overtuned, and at worst gamebreaking.
---
That's exactly it. Their power creates an unfun mechanic for survivors, which results in survivors not liking them.
---
Well same I usually get at least a 3k with him he can slow down the game a lot and has great pressure
---
Oh yeah. Instead of making more Killers viable... They Nerf any killer that has to be played against differently. If survivors can't use the same tricks and Loops the killer must be overpowered instead of bringing variety to the game. Personally I love playing against nurse and spirit because I can't treat them the same as other Killers. Same with Huntress on a good map. People shouldn't complain if they can't Loop a killer around a pallet for 5 minutes. They should adapt to the new killer. People are already crying out for more Nerfs despite the nurse being gutted.
---
All they need to do is some slight tweaks to make most of the bad colors viable. Trapper should spawn with all of his traps. Wraith should have less stun time while cloaked to help during chases, Leatherface shouldn't slow down while charging his chainsaw. Legion should be removed from the game. Ghostface needs his consistency fixed. Myers should get out of Tier 1 faster, Pig Ambush should count towards the exposed status effect and she should only Roar after beginning the lunge not while charging. You should also not be able to leave through the gate with a trap on your head. And those are just all of the slight Buffs that are as simple as changing a number in coding that I think would make most of those bad Killers I listed much more viable. Or much more fun to play as and against. While keeping what makes them unique or appealing to their player base

I just prestiged my Demo and have yet to get Ruin back, but I dont think ill run it even when I get it back. I'm reliably getting 3ks with hatch without it at rank 8-9
---
Leatherface with that pouty lower lip and chunky belly and those tantrums he throws... So adorable
---
Yes, but it is annoying. Some people's hatred come from the before rework legion. In the past he could hit you twice to lower your meter, making chases long, boring and obnoxious.
---
He could also exploit the deep wound timer (you had to be in a chase for the timer to stop) just following the blood of a survivor and not looking at them.
---
Wrong mask
---
Not every huntress is a good one
---
Wait are you this mad spirit? What toxic perks did he have lol.
---
You'd be okay with the sound at exactly 1 minute in blaring through your headset every chase lol?  Thanks but no thanks.
---
He went from being a Pinto to being a motherfucking Benz. An absolute beast.
---
I wasn't complaining I just thought it was a funny meme &gt;&lt; I don't mind legion but they're my least fave in terms of story etc
---
He's a slow down killer.  Survivors don't enjoy healing.  Red ranks don't even run self-care anymore.
---
Damn lol, you‚Äôre full of great ideas! 
---
I‚Äôd be down for pretty much all of those
---
Did they fix the shadow bug in the upcoming patch?
---
Me too buddy me too
---
Big mad, get moried scrub
---
Maybe not, but the killer has to patrol how many gens? 6, 7, 8? Also, not only that, but alot of the times, swf groups have a designated Looper that will purposely not work on gens and take all the pressure off the other survivors.
---
Stalking is michael myers power (Evil Within), the more you stalk, you will level up.
---
Tier 1: 8 miles of Terror Radius, no red light, very short lunge and is very slow, vaults very slow. (Good to grab people from gens and stuff like that.)
---
Tier 2: 16 miles of terror radius, bigger lunge, has red light, and is now faster, and vaults faster.
---
Tier 3: 32 Terror radius, you put survivors to dying state for 60 seconds (or forever, if you have the ultra rare addon), you vault faster and you go way faster, way bigger lunge.
---
His addons can help him stalk faster, or even instantly kill the survivors.
---
Overall he's  really a good killer.
---
It does exactly what it says on the tin
---
To do list:
---
~~‚Ä¢  Make the survivor fail a skill check~~
---
‚Ä¢  Trip up The Hillbilly mid sprint
---
~~‚Ä¢  Scare Dwight into the locker~~
---
‚Ä¢  Make the huntress use her backup axe heads
---
‚Ä¢  Be in a ghost face selfie
---
~~‚Ä¢  Loot the basement before ace (Quickly!)~~
---
‚Ä¢  Make a mini bloodweb (~~Flashlight~~, ~~key~~, toolbox, medkit, map)
---
I always sink it in the pallet door at shack.  Almost a guaranteed trap at most ranks.
---
Im 150 let me wail on your head and scratch ur face for a while
---
Same to you, we went far with it.
---
Once again, good luck with future spirit match‚Äôs. And glad we didn‚Äôt end up flaming each other lol
---
That‚Äôs a game mechanic. When you fail a skill check, your character winces, and repairs stop momentarily. This applies to FAILING a skill check, getting a good with ruin active gives the regression, but I think it keeps going.
---
The survivors run around looking for the last gen and then they see it. Slowly being dragged around the map by The Goose.
---
And then there's Spine Chill, Premonition, OoO, basically any information gathering or detection perk, gen tapping, looking at grass movements, actually paying attention around you...
---
But nah.. why need to do all of that when you just accustomed to telegraphs being attached to killer actions. Why go out of your way to use your skills when you are use to hearing a killer's terror radius from 30 meters away. 
---
It's not fair to have to use a perk to counter a perk. Not fair at all. Especially when they have to decide to take off Adrenaline/DS/Borrowed Time in exchange for Spine Chill.
---
Being forced to run a perk to have a good chance at winning isn't right.
---
OH WAIT... killers have been forced into using Ruin for years. So here's the world's smallest violin playing, Spirit haters.
---
Tofu ran into a group doing this when he was devour, and they hard countered it, as it requires a survivor to unhook another surv to gain tokens, kobes don't count.
---
Don't remember them saying that but it's definitely been long enough for me to forget, I'm sure. That said, with both Freddy and now Nurse I think it's safe to say that the Devs are spending more time than usual looking over their killers in today's environment, so they might go back to Legion some day soon. Problem is though, I'm not sure there even is a way to truly "balance" them, plus the general idea of what he's supposed to do, what the Devs want them to do, is exactly what players hate about them anyways, the killer just shouldn't have been made to begin with. In my opinion, they honestly should just get an entirely different ability like what happened to Freddy, but I don't have the slightest clue what else they could do.

the grammar confused me i read it wrong i thought u said dcing for personal reasons was shitty
---
Because she takes skill and extensive knowledge of how survivors play to use properly. The only reason she seems OP now is because people have had a year to learn her.
---
Don't worry she'll get one next year.
---
I meant to reply to Steezy. The fact that so many killers run a perk that solely stalls the early part of the game indicates that gens pop way too early sometimes, and there‚Äôs nothing bar ruin that can effectively stop it (There‚Äôs other stall perks such a Dark Devotion but Ruin is generally better)
---
Someone posted it again and got more upvotes with platinum and gold :(
---
Look at little Goblin Jr. Gonna cry?
---
Dont focus too much on portals during early game. Set up a few in a 3gen area, look for survivors. Using too many portals is bad because you cant make more unless they get sealed. I personally used to run ruin/sf/enduring/chili, but later switched sf and enduring for Surge and PWYF. I'm planning on switching ruin for either Monitor or Surveillance once I hit p3
---
i mean so would the literally most other killers. Entity puts all killers on an even playing field in strength, from legion to the demogorgan they are all the same. Only difference is what their power allows.
---
Sorry, english is not my first language XD
---
When you posted the meme last night and someone posts it later with more karma and plat/gold ;(
---
I‚Äôm not sure if demogorgons better or not
---
Qampu
---
Really? I feel dumb lol, I thought spine chill would get affected bc when Demo comes out of one of its portals it has undetectable and can‚Äôt be detected by spine chill for however many seconds
---
When someone steals your flair. Also been there dude, sorry.
---
Yeah I get over it plain Bubba and keeping the shit out of all you cock suckers
---
SO LONG. FREAKKKKKKK.
---
Only PS2 homies will remember
---
Because Meg is lame. Fight me.
---
its not your fault LOL
---
Yeah no that‚Äôs not the case, many other players thought that too but spine chill still works against every killer except Tier 1 Myers.
---
what is this gonna do? This is either a very isolated incident in which case it wont be high on their list to fix because its only affecting a few players or its common enough that its being investigated and will be fixed in a few patches if not one if its that bad of a problem.
---
Ps2 be like "shcheeeeeeeoooooooonggg"

This is a turning point of visual art

My god DBD was not meant to be played with touchscreen especially with Killer being first person.
---
i loved old freddy and am still pissed they changed him. i think with any rework of a killer they should give us both versions and allow us to choose before the start of the round whether we want to play old style or new
---
Killer on pc can be pretty long if you're rank 15-20. Thankfully the queue times at rank 9 are less than 5 minutes

The problem with self-care is it's a massive time sink. Self-caring twice(64 total seconds) takes almost as much as finishing a generator(80 seconds for one surv). Inner Strength is the better perk by far for healing yourself, as you can complete an additional objective and become able to heal in just 8 seconds after a totem break. And yeah, I often go full games injured, especially if the killer is weaker. Against nurse, spirit, huntress, or hag, I would recommend finding a teammate when possible for a heal, as those killers excel at landing first hits, and being already injured severely limits your life expectancy. But against weaker killers or someone with instadowns, I like being injured as I can use dead hard and save time on gens. It took me a while after I first started this game to leave self-care behind, but without it my builds can be a lot more flexible, and I feel like I contribute more to the team.
---
Run ruin and noed
---
pity escape lol
---
The main issue is that "fun" is subjective.
---
Frank got a matching one, only Legion left to get one now is Susie
---
Spine chill and balanced landing can make some crazy infinites together
---
There's an upcoming TV series starring Jennifer Connely but I don't think there's a new movie.  I think OP was just joking.
---
Do you have any other killer themes? The trapper I‚Äôm sure would love his own theme song

---
That build is OP
---
No he is explaining his reason to do an asshole thing, it ruins the game for everyone
---
I had The Vengeful One by Disturbed playing while watching this. Made it even better lol
---
While my point was myers and Ghostface take time to use their one shot just like huntress going to a locker to get another. Also Myers and Ghostface can swing 10s of time before their chance is missed. Hillbilly to me is like iri huntress all the time the trade off being where she can throw over windows and pallets, he can travel to places ridiculously fast and break pallets quickly. I like that we agree that 1 hatchet would be acceptable. So I guess the other 1 shot killers are neither here nor there. Ggs.
---
That sounds like a horrible idea
---
Happy cake, that sounds epic.
---
You lost me when you said Thanatophobia. That perk is absolute trash.
---
Thanks!
---
Ya, I either get a brown tool box or a yellow flashlight, there is no between
---
‚ÄûThe paint is still fresh but i‚Äòm long gone.‚Äú - Nea
---
Basically when you run around a pallet good, and when the killer gets decently close to you, putting it down.
---
I like to think I can do a good Mark Hamill Joker impression and a pretty good laugh. It‚Äôs more of an Arkham game style voice than animated series tho
---
I didn't expect a detailed answer like this, thank you !
---
I have gamer brain
---
She will get hers next time. And killers' cosmetics are much better than survivors' so I'd better have more killers' sets
---
It can feel like it sometimes when you get the toxic SWFs but I'd like to say most survivors I face are chill.
---
Yea. I play really fair a lot of the time. And my weakness is letting people live too often. The second someone crouches and nods their head at me when they‚Äôre about to die I instantly become friendly. It‚Äôs a curse.
---
Yeah 4 perks is quite fast now, thanks
---
The bar just stops moving. If it did what it said it would never looked like its progress is completely halted. It would go down and start gping up as usual. If two people are on a gen and one whinces, why does the other person have to wait?
---
[Yea, well....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c)
---
Now the mental hospital cosmetic makes sense.
---
That just sounds like a waste of time since I could be running away.
---
Agreed there.
---
Why do i have to wait if someone else is whincing?
---
How was this even made wtf
---
Yeah but killers are faster than survivors, so just running away in a straight line and randomly slamming down pallets isn't the way to go. Also I forgot to say looping also has windows involved in it often.
---
Wait...your Ruin is still up when survivors start doing gens?
---
So just because a killer is good means it should be nerfed ???!!!
---
I've also thought about this. The fact that it will require you to run sub optimall builds and out of your way plays will make the game a bit frustrating. People will waist so much time doing nothing and trying to farm for shards instead of trying to win. 
---
And of course, despite making things hard for teammates, the game actually rewards this bad behavior by giving them shards and way more bp than if they actually stick around.
---
I would say only count it if they escape but that would add an entire extra difficulty to it and punish regular players more than help.
---
Ahah! I was the one who pointed out the mall grab :D (love the cosplay. Glad to see the grab is gone.)
---
I like this, rly wish I could download it
---
Usually when I get spotted I just run and pull down pallets when the killer is close. I began today so I really don‚Äôt know what to actually do. Outside watching streamers the past month
---
Adrenaline and exhaustion perks are unfun for me as a killer main and so are instaheals and flashlight saves but I‚Äôm not crying on this subreddit I deal with it and change my play style accordingly but apparently you believe that instead of changing your play style and choosing different perks other then the same Template of perks, that the entire game should rework the killer to be a 115% speed killer that gets looped easily with their power being useless in chase so you can loop them. Spirit is one of the killers who are unique with abilities that can actually be used during a chase.
---
I mean, he was heavily viewed as a mistake, because his primary function was just stretching out every aspect of the game, which  was pretty dull even after his numbers were nerfed. Yes, a small handful of people liked him, but to be frank, his rework was announced like, literally weeks after his launch. It took a long time to actually come, but it wasnt exactly a surprise.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dgn2sn/lol_wut/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Punishing survivors heavily for mistakes should be for all killers just like if a killer makes a mistake the killer should be heavily punished
---
I do recommend watching videos on how to loop. Trust me when you get higher in the ranks running and throwing down pallets won't do you any good, and will harm you and your team.
---
Pretty much sums it up.
---
Mobile was a neat idea but the controls need an entire fucking thorough redesign.
---
Turning and attacking both being your right thumb is clunky.
---
You shouldn't need to tap the fucking center of your screen for some actions.
---
Some actions are impossible to do (you literally cannot turn during chainsaw dash with Hillbilly)
---
The animation you get around the edges during a chase? Pretty sure that lags the game sometimes
---
TL;DR: I seriously don't want to even touch Mobile DBD with a 50 foot pole for fear of catching something
---
I don‚Äôt 100% get how looping is toxic. Like do you want me to run in a straight line where you will definitely catch me and avoid all windows? Or just sit in front of you and wait to get hit?
---
Can‚Äôt
---
 It‚Äôs against this subs rules 4head
---
Shubtup
---
I completely understand your point. But being always injured is risky, and when you are the only one good on your team it is further worse. I'll leave selfcare when i'll unlock iron will or adrenaline
---
wait does mobile naturally have shadowborn?
---
real question tho, do you have the download to those custom icons? They look great
---
Thank you for convincing me to never let that monstrosity of a "game" touch my phone.
---
Totems aren't a secondary objective tho... The whole concept of totems is the risk/reward factor because the hexes associated with them are extremely powerful, to be expected to find every single totem when they buff the totem spots more and more every patch is unreasonable, especially for 1 single perk. If they were truly a secondary objective then NOED would be built-in, which it definitely should not be.
---
I mean, he's not wrong.
---
If a Killer was reworked for balance changes, like Nurse, being able to completely ignore those balance changes and just continue to play the older version is quite frustrating for the Survivors.
---
It'd be better to just nuke the older version and try to make a different character with a similar kit. That way when you play against Freddy you know what you're getting into, and when you play against Candyman you know exactly how he works.
---
Thanatophobia with sloppy or dying light is good.
---
Do people actually help you off hooks higher in ranks because I lose most matches because I don‚Äôt get helped. Also, is attempting to unhook yourself useful at all?
---
In short. Worse for Killer.
---
If you can have a low ping server. It should roughly be the same with some worse for wear from slight delays on breaking pallets/gens and some Killer powers can get touchy. The timing for charging Killer powers is ever so slightly off, really messes with your muscle memory. Basic M1 Killers are going to suffer as well though. Following a Survivor just feels like it takes even longer to get anything done. Makes a 115% Killer feel like 110%.
---
A high ping server, you might as well not bother. Some Killer powers go to hell and interacting with the pallet/gens takes 1-2 seconds longer than it should.
---
It is still playable and if you have a low ping server then it shouldn't matter much at all. But it is rather noticeable for the more technical players and can be off putting at times and can be outright infuriating if you don't get a good server.
---
It‚Äôs sadly true man sorry to be the bearer of bad news
---
They have very different SFX though, as well as different durations
---
i mained him, got to rank 5 with him before a reset (the highest ive ever gotten on killer), most games were 4k's with the occasional 2 or 3... i never saw him as fantastic but never a mistake either. i enjoyed playing him and i played him well. i feel like people who disliked him couldnt play well with him (or against him) so began the REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE until change. its pathetic that something good can turn to shit because of a bunch of crybabies. it is what it is though its what i've come to expect from BHVR and the community but i stand by what i said in that we should be given a choice of which version to play as.
---
His chase music would have to change though.  The Benny Hill theme seems fitting.
---
I need to know
---
wow you dont know any of these characters at all
---
You know the meaning of little right?

---
THIS. CONFIRMED.
---
I do try to play nice in-game and be fair here (Survivors do need better BP income, for example), but I never hide it when I disagree with someone.
---
The devs viewed him as a mistake, never said anything about you personally. As I mentioned yes, a handful of people enjoyed him, but he was antifun to the large majority of players, and really didnt serve an actual purpose. Freddy was always one of my favorite oldschool slashers, so I tried reaaaaally hard to like him, and I did have some very high scoring games with him, however, games were on average about 10+ minutes longer than normal, and not at all for actually interesting reasons, simply because survivor actions took longer, and because I had to wait a few seconds each time I actually wanted to attack. It was dull for most people involved, and his original nerf, was merely a placeholder for the eventual rework, they were very open about that. They werent happy with how he turned out. 
---
On the flipside, freddy is now my absolute favorite killer.

---
Punishes the survivors for doing the only objective, huh?
---
NOED isn‚Äôt a toxic perk- but it is a very hard crutch perk.
---
Yeah, I remember that from the Super Saiyan Wraith video.  Just checked, but they didn't even do the build to maximize the unhook odds.  Only one of them had Slippery Meat, one of them did not have Up the Ante (which screws over all of them), two of them didn't have ds, and one of them did not put in a collective luck offering.  And they still took tofu by complete surprise by kobe'ing nearly every time.
---
They need to let Killers just yeet totems somewhere else so they don't do that anymore.
---
Wow dedicated servers sound like garbage
---
NOED rewards bad plays from killers.
---
Honestly this is part of the reason I don‚Äôt understand why killers are always up in arms about survivors having too many advantages. 
---
I never play with friends using outside voice chat and often it‚Äôs so hard to live because I have dumb team members. Either way I try saving people or ignoring and gen rushing or a mix of both it still is the same outcome. 
---
MOST people play this game using the game mechanics and they don‚Äôt use discord or something to chat. 
---
Also it‚Äôs very frustrating the way the ranking system works now. I am rank 8 and I get paired with stronger rank killers‚Äî makes sense EXCEPT I GET RANK 18s and 19s on my team all the time which always fucks us over. 
---
Like?????? I‚Äôm just so frustrated with it all. There are so many dumb players and killers like to idealize the perfect outcome of how it‚Äôs easy for survivors to escape when that perfect outcome is rare to none from ever happening. Especially with bullshit like Ebony Mori
---
But the person who made the template obviously did because half of America hates trump because he‚Äôs apparently a racist among other things
---
Haunted Ground totems are present in the picture, but so well-hidden you can't tell.
---
Using a meme template that happens to have politicians in it isn't by any stretch of the imagination "bringing politics into it." you did that yourself with your inability to see Trump and not open your mouth for him to use.
---
How about they are unable to turn their camera for a short time. Couldn't this be useful?
---
Joker
---
Yes people do often help you off of hooks in higher ranks, but you shouldn't when the killer is near. And don't attempt to unhook unless you're almost on 2nd stage of being on the hook (when the claws are about to come out)
---
And that's fair, I would wait, but don't always self-care when you're injured, pressure gens and heal after you finish a gen, or bring a medkit so the time is drastically reduced. Even self-care + botany is pretty dang good without a medkit. Being injured also baits some killers to chase you, and if you're the best, you definitely want the killer chasing you instead of someone else.
---
Imagine being that petty. Is BP even that important once you're P3 level 50? I sort of assumed average income utterly outpaced item hunger at that point.

Where are we going with this agian?
---
Old Freddy was my go to and I absolutely loved him for the exact reason specified by OP's second paragraph.  I was initially dissapointed with the announced rework.
---
That being said.....I have to admit he is objectively better and stronger than he was before.  I don't have to work nearly as hard or play nearly as optimally to play well with him consistently.  It took me some time but I came over I love the rework.  Word of advice his Dream Pallets are dogshit compared to his Snares.  God damn those things are powerful.
---
I made the post seeking advice on how to play around it. You responded with "You shouldn't complain, land all great skill checks, that's too bad for you." You are of 0 help and I'd ask that you don't respond again.

This happened to me. The survs tried and eventually did the gen but never found ruin

Thank you for stating my exact words differently.

It still doesn't change the fact that NOED rewards poor play, Take devour hope for instance, to get the same effect as noed it has to fulfill TWO requirements, hooking and being far enough away from the hook for survivors to unhook 3 times, And it is constantly in the match as a hex totem.
---
NOED just spawns in when the final gen pops. Do tell, out of all the matches you've used or gone against NOED, How many times did it get cleansed? I can tell you because I know all of them.  
---
In my 98 hours I've had a NOED cleansed Once, By me. Twice has all totems been cleansed when a killer had NOED.
---
What
---
Hello yes am new here, ; u ; 
---
On PC, I‚Äôm CLAPPIN‚Äô THEM CHEEKS, I‚Äôd love if people could practice matches with me sometime cause I‚Äôm a hot garbage killer. 
---
Am also a semi decent survivor, at least I think I am :^)
---
She‚Äôs one of the least skillful killers.  Tip to people that are bad with spirit turn your volume up you‚Äôll become a god.
---
Their bones keep it from slipping out.
---
I think it‚Äôs like bills perks, ‚Äúsurvivor bill‚Äù that they basically turn into a ‚Äúall‚Äù perk like lightweight
---
But honestly, NOED is a harder crutch perk than anything survivors have (and before you play the ‚Äòsurvivor main‚Äô card, I main killer, I just like Ash so my flair reflects that). At least Adrenaline rewards you for doing well, BT rewards against camping/tunnelling- NOED is a reward for not doing well.
---
What‚Äôs up gown?
---
He used to be extremely toxic with a certain build before late April and, even without that build, was a very, very annoying killer. They changed him, he's now just a slightly annoying low tier killer, and people still hate him because that's what people are used to doing, and he's still not very fun to play against overall.
---
Thank god! So glad to see this meme back out and a perfect fit! 
---
Thanks for the slap to the face BhVR...
---
BruhI didnt give you advice because you already said it yourself
---
"I try to look for it or work around it"
---
Either look harder or power through,thats the only way to deal with it
---
Man, I, loved this episode of Reboot! :D
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy bc I seen a guy that was at the tall brick part of the exit gate moon walk out yesterday and I was in awe
---
Even with iron will they can still see you move through the grass if they are good enough.
---
Mhm, they even have Ghost Face, The Pig from Saw,  and sometime soon they may even have Pennywise.
---
I've seen a Ghostface one where he has his knife as a needle I think but besides that I haven't seen any licensed dlc killer ight fanart
---
Nah that just Freddies lunge it's BS
---
Great job! What's your favorite killer? (I see it might be trapper but it could be a daily)
---
What? Why would Killers mind DCs? They just get an easier game unless EVERYONE bails. Farming, if they're nice and it's only two people.
---
Maybe not what you want if you're after a challenge, but it's better than being a 3man against a Maximum Sweat Spirit.
---
Submit a ticket on their support page, they'll credit you back. I'm on pc and it happens often.
---
Pennywise would be great. I love Ghostface and look forward to seeing him in the game (I want to be a better survivor before staring playing killers).
---
It's a competition between the wraith, the huntress, and the trapper, but this certainly makes the trapper more appealing for me.
---
This might force Myers to go into tier 4
---
Y'see this is CLEAR! evidence that this subreddit is OVERWHELMINGLY killer sided, smh I gotta go to Steam community tab of I want FAIR and BALANCED opinions now.
---
 &gt; Honestly this is part of the reason I don‚Äôt understand why killers are always up in arms about survivors having too many advantages.
---
&gt; I am rank 8
---
This is why you don't understand, you're not high rank enough to play with/against optimal players.
---
How satisfying would it be, after all the years of being helplessly chased, to just whip around and kick em right in the chest
---
Lmao I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one who noticed that.
---
Well, I've heard legends in other videogames about people apparently making mouse and keyboard work on the PS4 somehow, maybe there's a couple of those madlads running around PS4 as well, assuming they exist. Honestly the only thing I can think.
---
All killer lunges are the exact same ffs
---
Well, perks are teachable.
---
I legitimately didn't think anyone but me didn't have every single teachable in the game on every single character at this point.
---
How do I do this exactly?
---
Can‚Äôt really explain how to do it on console but it‚Äôs a lot more difficult to do
---
Lol nice comment my dude i like that you clearly get that NOED can be a huge game turn around but it can also just be 1 or 2 surprise downs and then just get cleansed. 
---
It‚Äôs almost like it should just be like a 120 second timer starts and text appears saying ‚Äú2 MINUTES OF ULTIMATE MAYHEM GO NUTS‚Äù and then it gets cleansed and you‚Äôre just like, that was fun and you enjoy getting ur extra bp
---
there‚Äôs a reason everyone runs BBQ for map pressure, and if the killer focuses on this designated looper the whole game that‚Äôs their fault, and again you‚Äôre assuming every single match is a four man swf trained by the navy seals or something
---
They're literally not, Myers in tier 3 has the longest lunge ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Oh yeah, this is big brain time
---
Yeah, IMO survivor is a good start, it's what I started off with. Also I forgot to mention Leatherface is a killer (from Texas Chainsaw Massacre)
---
They're literally not, Myers tier 3 has the longest lunge ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è plus it was a joke
---
I actually love Feral Frenzy and all that because it's really fun to play with (running around with that super long lunge and fast cooldown after attacks feels good), but it's just such a bad power. I wish they could keep Feral Frenzy but change almost everything about it to make it a good, reliable power but keep its fun aspect. Realistically though, they'll probably rework him entirely and give him a more creative power involving all Legion members, but who knows.
---
As a meyers main, endless tier 3 and scratched mirror are my absolute favorites. Prayer beads for the spirit are op. Both of hags ultra rares are really good. Iridescent king for the doc is great. Honestly, any ultra rare add on for any killer is a pretty safe bet
---
I'd prefer Brenda
---
I‚Äôve played against him, Huntress and Demogorgan the most
---
Oliver Tree in the dbd subreddit was a surprise, for sure, but a welcome one.
---
Okay so 12 DC's Vs 1 even with equal numbers of killers and survivors that still puts survivor DC's at three times the rate of killers
---
Fair, she‚Äôd be a Nea V.2
---
Yeah, Leatherface was really hard for me to play against when I first started playing.
---
Meh, it'd be alright, but I think there should definitely be more to it. What's really fun about DBD is how you can create so many builds with all the perks, and without that and without items you basically just have the base game without all of your progression rewards. So, add a twist to it and it may be a good idea.
---
Just open the exit gates, thus starting the collapse, rather than let it sit at 99%.
---
Are you actually reading what I'm saying or are you just supressing any information that doesn't fit your narrative?  
---
Tell me how many times NOED has been cleansed for you.  
---
Tell me how many times survivors specifically go for NOED instead of exit gates once last gen pops.
---
This is not so groovy.
---
Yea but we live in an entity realm where you chase a survivor for 5 seconds and 2 gens pop and killers are put in a position where ruin is almost mandatory so having a back up plan for when that text says ‚Äúfind the exit‚Äù  is a good idea unless you enjoy de pipping
---
Please explain...
---
I hate the doctor though. He was my first play through and kept changing direction even though he wasn‚Äôt there
---
