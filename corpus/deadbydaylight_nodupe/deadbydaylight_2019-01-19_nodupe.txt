I can't take out of my mind Nurse with a cigarette on a hand, and a booze on another one. THANKS GUYS now whenever I'm a survivor, I'll try not be stupid and laugh my ass off in the match haha
---
---
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
What the fuck did I just read 
---
I hate the idea of quitting a chase because a survivor is "too good" or something, I'd rather they just use up all the pallets and take my chances. I mean what do you do when you guys bump into them again later in the match? Just turn the other direction and let them go about their business?
---
A friend of mine that loves running killers more than doing gens wears bright clothes specifically for the distraction aspect.

Top shitpost well done

This made me lol

Dat boi

r/wooooosh

Um no. Farming is against the rules and is clearly stated so. If they’re afk, it’s also against the rules. Don’t shout them out because then it just encourages this kinda behavior. 
---
Every time.
---
No u can derank 
---
When he's playing Sloppy, thanataphobia and ruin then you know you're in for a 30 min bore-fest. It's so much like a 3 gen Doc, so boring to play against and just wastes everyone's time...
---
So first Welcome to the fog second check the steam guides for the crashes if you are on console the game is poorly optimizade third  the connection currently is player to player so the host is the killer so always check the ping 
---
&gt; The killer chose to be merciful, and not shitty
---
I'm having an issue understanding where in this statement is the misconception. Your statement specifically states a killer that chooses to be merciful isn't shitty; therefore, one that doesn't choose to be merciful *is* shitty. It's not exactly hard to extrapolate here that you believe it to be the killer's obligation to make up for survivors leaving a teammate(s) out to dry, and not doing so makes him a bad person.
---
Your statement is very clearly written, so I'm not sure why you're trying to backpedal and try explaining it differently than it's written.
---
Wha
---
No, i meant like would it be more useful to use Iron Will instead. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now that i read what i typed in i can see why you're confused. Let me fix it.
---
You can’t de-rank past 15 unless it’s from a rank reset. 
---
When killers thinks cleansing all totems is viable LMAO
---
Yeah, but you also fuck yourself and your team if you use it.
---
Oooh that is so much scarier than I thought. Thanks for informing me!
---
This is so true
---
Lets hear it
---
Just hit them and move on. 
---
Implying BNP is good lmao nice one killers QQ
---
Its Not the Events. Killers get 40k+ bp on average. Survivors get maybe 10-15. If survivors had that much they could bring more stuff too.
---
And It’s a good thing you added them too! Otherwise Soulja Boy would’ve been all over this post for copyright infringement.
---
r/me_irl
---
Exactly why I stopped subbing to her or any of her crew. After what she did to team trapped in the internet. I can’t watch her toxicity anymore. 
---
Don’t mistake them for the Soulja pods.
---
So *yet* again, let me explain this very simple concept to you.
---
Bear in mind that even if X means Y, that *does not imply* Y means X.
---
I said that the killer was merciful and not shitty. I *also* said that while not farming is not necessarily shitty, I can be reasonably certain that *because* they chose to farm and were merciful, they were in fact ***not*** shitty. I ***did not say*** they would have been shitty had they not farmed. That was not something I said or indeed implied. What others read into what I said is their issue, not mine.
---
I am awestruck by your inability to grasp this very simple explanation.
---
&gt; So yet again, let me explain this very simple concept to you.
---
Indeed. Let's try.
---
&gt; I said that
---
Again, your direct quote is as follows:
---
This explicitly states had the killer chose not to be merciful and instead play the game out normally, it would have been shitty. You can pull the "that's not what I really meant" routine all you want, but it doesn't matter. No amount of snarky backpedaling is going to change your original statement, though it seems as if you're trying to change its meaning after the fact.
---
The problem here lies with you.
---
I love orphan black
---
You are personally reading more into my words than I said. But since you refuse to acknowledge this, there isn’t much more I can say.
---
Have fun!
---
Any thoughts about my suggestion?
---
I’m talking to you now aren’t I? Just did btw 
---
I got the achievement on my first attempt.  Was super happy to not have to attempt that combo more than once.
---
On Judith's tombstone (which he used)it doesn't deplete ew3
---
"Gen Rush" I think you mean, survivors playing the only objective in the game.
---
The rules say that there needs to be dbd in the picture, but I’ve seen some with just the title and photo caption relating to the game. In the end the people who sort by new decide 
---
Sneaking around in tall grass with the legion standing relatively far away, you can tell the moment they see you.
---
I dont camp when I kill because I hate being camped.  I often got 0 kill games because Iam just having fun and usually let people escape, If I can hook everyone a few times im good with that.  I dont get the teabaging though. I may be a bad killer I may let you pallet me but dont teabag. 
---
On n off. I used lithe, walked a lil, he lost me, he found me or I just ran into him (Lery’s btw) jump through window get “wounded”, hide n heal, jump on gen, he finds me. Repeat. 
---
I got the mercy hatch then told “I got all the flashlight users, so it’s good”
---
Then you'll hopefully get what i'm saying: Response is not there. Thats why nothing is happening.
---
I don’t get what the challenge is, is it just getting six 4ks on the game?
---
...why?
---
So you’re trying to tell me that the HOST who is HOSTING THE GAME wouldn’t cause me to lag or lose anything being sent back and forth causing issues?
---
I just can't quit you dbd...
---
Why? It's quite challenging and fun too.
---
Based on how I got Top today with my meme, I say it's fair to assume you only need text related to ingame. 
---
Read what i said 
---
Me but when people still bitch about tunneling
---
I wouldn't say irrelevant, as that directly enabled moonwalking Legion...
---
Oh, I adore the Russian Roulette/Totem Guard build. It's what I usually run on the Spirit. It's so fun to use her no noise while in phase add on (yamaoke beads or something like that) and then snatching them off the totems. 
---
Never tried it on Nurse though, but that's because I'm garbage with her lol.
---
Not gonna happen but an SCP killer
---
Lol this sub is a massive killer circle jerk
---
I did too, everyone else was hooked in the basement in 5 minutes and they were being camped.
---
Me whenever I play Killer.
---
I don't think I can see a better escape since I already saw ape escape
---
Don't play with them.
---
As a survivor main, I wear Nea's bright pink highlight Hair. The point of it is to aggro the killer. I'm fairly confident in my ability to run, so i enjoy wasting the killer's time. I also run bond to make sure I don't lead the killer to my teammates. 
---
.Ping is a utility first developed by Michael Muss in 1983 that is used to verify whether or not a network data packet is capable of being distributed to an address without errors.
---
It MAY cause the lag. There are so many variables that it doesnt need to be the Killer. Especially with  4 different hosts the likelyhood is close to 0.
---
Thank you for your feedback! This was the kind of comment I was hoping for! I know his power is similar to the Legion's and that's probably because I wanted to try to incorporate something with Deep Wounds because I like that aspect since it's new and different. I need to give that more thought because I get your point. I also liked the idea of a killer chasing after you like how a bear or a wolf would, which is why he runs on all fours. I'll try to find some different version of that where I can still incorporate that aspect. I also wanted to give him perks that fit his animal-based idea and since you recommended something more simple, maybe a perk that lets him hear survivors in a larger radius? I also wanted something to do with visibility and originally wanted his hex to affect the thickness of the fog on the map but I didn't know if that would be difficult to work with or not. What do you think?
---
You are personally trying to say what you said is not what you meant, but since you refuse to acknowledge this, there isn't much more I can say.
---
Fuck me they need get their shit together
---
What kind of advice are you looking for? Confused.
---
I think all this would be fixed if the legion had a stun on missed frenzy stabs. It means you can outplay them, which is fun.
---
Because a toxic survivor can t bag and flashlight flicker, which are just annoying, while a toxic killer can face camp and then you can do shit but die
---
Or just remove the chase requirement.
---
Unfortunately I don't have another computer to test this. 
---
I don’t know how you were able to see the Claudette’s they’re basically invisible 
---
Tunneling and camping are not toxic.  I think you're 10 % survivor game time may had you confused. 
---
Except from when the killer has awful internet even though the ping said green. Or when you get facecamped. Or when you get tunnelled.
---
I use killer to de-stress lol, but I don't kill survivors so it makes sense ;)
---
Along with every other game being a 3 v 1
---
I'm so confused why you have 4 downvotes i-
---
God damn I hate sandbaggers, had Laurie that I SAVED from killer with party streamer and took killer away from him, how does he thank me? By following me everywhere where I'm trying to juke, and then just literally blocked me from looping pallet and I got downed, once I got downed he runs to hide, waits for killer to hook me, before killer even gets the chance to go away, he runs straight for unhook, gets me farmed and gets downed himself. And then at the end of match killer says "gg ez,fk u noobs", was one of most amazing solo games I've had.
---
Because you unfortunately  can't force someone to not play half the game. I just say keep an eye on your ping in lobby and dodge it if seems bad. 
---
At least we're getting dedicated servers this year, eh?
---
I started using discordance on my nurse and it works very well. People never expect it. 
---
Thank you, truly helpful
---
Face cam - good
---
Survived in a row - good
---
Interaction with chat - good

Interesting stream layout - good
---
Being toxic - bad

That's about it

So true. So true. 
---
Appreciate it! First time editing things. 
---
I ADORE the Spirit. Probably one of my favorite killers. But, since it's opinion based, I'd suggest checking out some videos of her gameplay. That's why I usually do when I'm debating a game or DLC. Monto has some really fun Spirit builds/videos. 
---
Woah! I am so proud of this community.
---
My thoughts exactly lmao

Myers and Pig meta

Until you face a pig whilst repairing that gen.

He seems it because of Frank's Mixtape, which is a ultra rare add on. Because of the event, anyone who leveled Legion during it have a bunch of it and it's quite popular now. 
---
yeah, i was just in a bad mood last night because i jumped in after a while and thats the first match i get
---
this is the exact opposite of what john kramer wanted
---
Just take an image of billy and post it on the corner of the screen and it’s a certified DBD meme 
---
I wanted to give her a "bad gurl" kinda look! I feel like she should be more than just "female legion" but unfortunately behavior rendered her as almost a copy of frank with female proportions. But it's okay, cause it gives us a little freedom to design her! Thank you sm!!

---
Survivor BP gains are already shit. If some survivors DC, you're still gonna get an ok amount of BP as killer whilst the survivors will probably get 6k lol
---
People rag on survivors who sun DS and Killers who run NOED but the true toxicity in this wonderful game of ours is and always has been other survivors who do absolutely nothing all game because the “horror” game scares them to much for them to actually do anything. It’s like their life force is tied to their characters. 
---
I’ve had countless games where I’ve done all the gens (as in I’m the only one to get gens done), get the unhooks but end up dieing because I genuinely feel bad if I have the opportunity to help someone and don’t do it. The survivors are meant to be a team. You don’t need comms to be a successful team, 4 randoms can easily escape if they work smart. 
---
I’ve then had games where I’ve realised I’m the only one doing anything productive so say screw it, I’ll get the gens done or find the hatch when the potatoes die (I’ll keep doing gens up until they die though) then get messaged by the other survivors (PS4 btw) calling me every name you can think of because I didn’t help them which means I’m a bad survivor and team player. 
---
Obviously baby survivors are the exception because they’re just getting used to the game. 
---
Like 75% of this subreddit complains about toxic killers who tunnel and camp.  Is it toxic to just run specific perks then?  Killers can't really BM.  They dont exactly have a teabag button like survivors.  They are at a disadvantage during hatch standoffs.  The worst thing they can do involves them literally killing the survivor, which is what they're supposed to be doing anyway.  What do toxic killers do that isn't tunneling, camping, slugging, running certain perks, using a mori, or hitting someone on the hook?  Because afaik, that's all killers generally have to do to be considered toxic by this community.
---
rank reset is beautiful 
---
Either the killer is toxic with add ons and you have no chance at all because they're by far the most powerful killer in the game. Or they're a terrible killer but annoying to play against because you just spend the entire time mending.
---
k
---
Shit you're right
---
Tracking perks. That’s where you’re likely wasting the most time, finding people. Have BBQ, have whispers, and you should have enough tracking and momentum to be able to consistently win matches without ruin. That is, assuming you’re ending your chases as efficiently as possible. 
---
Holy shit that spirit drawing is awesome
---
Believe me. There is nothing boring than going up against a tunneling killer who has a Mori too.
---
Couldn't make it past the first chase where you literally miss 3 stabs in a row in frenzy. Did they dc, or did you 4k'd ?
---
Every fucking day. I am actually more fired up when I suck balls. When I have a good string of games, I tend to switch to other games.
---
It's okay, just juggle Legion. 
---
I mean if I'm thinking of it right, it was a school project done in a day so I'm sure they had plans based off how they drew the bodies but didnt have enough time.
---
But that's my guess
---
Yeh sure and that's why I'm saying, that they should "Make the end game interesting.".
---
No no no you misunderstand. The game ended when the said survivor incured my wrath. There is no longer any other thoughts besides retribution. Other survivors become nothing more than nuisances. If a survivor gets me to that state, he/she deserves that sense of victory, as I am also entitled to my sense of revenge, for a lack of a better word.
---
Unfortunately, they have been been escaping. Which means a total defeat for me. Those are soul crushing. Which is why I'm asking for advice on facecamping. Be mad at my response if you want, but it does help me work through my frustration of being a "bad killer".
---
Four gens in two and a half minutes is kind of crazy, any way you slice it.  
---
This is like the only multiplayer game that doesn’t make me mad, everything else does.
---
Isn’t it just.
---
I played for the first time since rank reset last night, felt kind of bad because of the killers I was going up against. 
---
Freddy? People still have insane amounts of backlash against Freddy.
---
Well her default mask is fabric I think, unless you're fatally allergic to a sweaty face I think you'd just be uncomfortable.
---
Yeah. Good nurses usually just skip most add-ons since they screw up with timing.
---
The god nurses who have adjusted to the timing and are running decent add-ons? I weep for thee.
---
People keep parroting this 'argument' but it makes no sense. Either he is good or he isn't, which is it? You literally said he is below mediocre in terms of actual killing then went on to say he can win chases effortlessly. So which is it? 
---
Although I appreciate the response. I'd prefer advice I can work with.
---
Streaming on PS4 is perfectly fine.
---
Probably rank 15 if he still deranks every day.
---
Which is cheating.
---
Hook someone in the basement, then stand in the doorway leading up.
---
Get used to it. Most of matches as a solo survivor are determined by the number of unskilled team mates you get. One baddie is carryable but can snowball in a death very quick if you're greedy. Two to three you're fucked - except if you take aggro fast and can run the killer on the entire map but he will most likely switch if you come across a mate during the chase. In that case just play the hatch.
---
Interesting, but, small layout. I hate when the screen is cluttered with stupid shit. I definitely think a more minimalistic approach is better. 
---
4K my dude, Can’t say I’m the best killer mostly just lucky 
---
Maybe if the picture quality was better I'd be able to actually tell what's going on
---
You can't win. Your only option is to join us. :)
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Now this is what I was looking for! Thank you good lad
---
The one on the left
---
I had to wipe my mouse down after that, but I got an achievement for being the obsession and surviving without getting hit. 
---
whats your rank? ill try finding you!
---
I don't quite have any answers for killers, but survivor, I have a few.
---
A perk that I cant see myself playing without: balanced landing, if I see bl in the bloodweb, I'm grabbing it. Dark sense is another I can't see myself playin' without, considering I play like a lil' bitch boy, I need to know the location of the killer at all times.
---
It's just simply not worth a perk slot. If you really hate reload times, just use the addon. Regardless, though, reload times aren't that big of a deal.
---
Freaked me out once when he just grabbed me out of nowhere.fml
---
You're having a blast talking to your friends? Wow, I've never heard of that before. Who could have thought talking to people you like could be fun? And comms help you play better. What a revelation!
---
JFC, you're a moron. ***OF COURSE they fucking help,*** cheating always does. Unlike you, though, I'm not a sweaty try hard who has to do well to have fun. I can die in 3 minutes and not give a fuck. So I don't need the extra advantage of comms to enjoy playing the game.
---
Now go the fuck away, I'm tired of dealing with your stupid.
---
Theres a patch?
---
Can you blame them? It’s about on par with being spawn camped in a shooter. Yeah it’s a great strategy to win for the team doing it but have you ever enjoyed being the ones on the receiving end? 
---
Fuck next you're gonna tell me Legion was a good addition to the game.
---
I just wanted to say how honorable you are, r/niceguys
---
Legion is cancer. No counter play, No skill, No fun.
---
Huntress' Lullaby is countered by survivors paying attention. Skill checks ain't hard to hit even with no sound cue. It's kinda okay on Doc, though, but good luck getting stacks.
---
This is what Zac sent you
---
If you’re a good nurse I don’t think you need Ruin. 
---
However I  am not a good nurse so I run it lol.
---
Into
---
This is so bad ya brilliant 
---
Sorry for the background noise
---
No. But guess what else they don't give. Yep, comms. So GTFO with that stupid attempt at justification.
---
I've seen a doctor run Ruin and HL. Not fun
---
I think it’s pretty fair 
---
Have any suggestions on how to counter Legion? Please tell me.
---
Pocket Watch and Anxious Breath are the best addons besides Purples.
---
Thanatophobia adds 12 seconds to a gen at rank 3 with all 4 survivors injured, for a max of 60 seconds (just under one gen) if everyone is injured for 5 gens.
---
Ruin removes 4 seconds of progress and stalls the generator for 3 seconds upon hitting a good, and prevents 1.6 seconds on a great.
---
Them hitting 2 goods is already better than Thanatophobia, and that's in the best case scenario for Thanatophobia, which is a case that will never happen, and even if it does, you're already winning anyway so neither perk matters.
---
Oooooh. Thank you!
---
Not really. Like the aesthetic but not the power
---
DBD is interested in polygamy and abusive relationships
---
Tunneling is how you play the game. If you're given a choice between going after someone who's healthy and not been hooked and a guy who's injured and has been hooked once, you go for the latter option.  There's plenty of counterplay to it. Be careful with when you unhook someone. Stay low until you've been fully healed. Bodyblock the guy about to get downed again. The difference between spawncamping and tunneling is that spawncamping doesn't generally have counterplay. So when a Survivor complains about getting tunneled, they just need to stop whining and grow a fucking spine. I've been tunneled a fair few times myself, but I don't get mad about it because it is always my fault when I die. TL;DR: FUCKING DEAL WITH IT YOU LITERAL INFANTS 
---
ace attorney in the dbd sub? 
---
Yea that's true. It takes a lot of muscle memory to learn for example omega blink. 
---
I always define that the difference between bad and good nurse is their ability to blink. The difference between good and god nurse is how well you can recover from failed blinks. Even good nurses usually lose their target if they miss a blink, which happens to everyone as blinks are pretty much always mindgameable. God nurse's are able to read where you went to cover and will keep the pressure even after failure
---
Pig tree. But I call it the meat tree because that's alot of meat
---
Why? I’m an odd mixture of toxic and not. It’s because I want to die and I don’t really care what happens at this point, contrary to this games subtitlw, death can be an escape. Some matches I rage quit, others I just give up, others I do what I can to win. Depends on the day really.
---
I love the bright colours! 
---
Cow tree
---
whats on their faces
---
pfft, no
---
Squeal team six
---
SWF, yes. And no one has any complaints or issues about SWF. SWF is not, and has never been, the problem. The **only** problem is voice chat. Because that's **not** intended and it breaks the game. Period. End of discussion.
---
Hey guys his totem is near killer shack but I'm going down lol. Hey guys the killer is chasing me near mothers dwelling feel free to do other gens also is anyone else hungry XD. Hey guys ik I died n shit but the killer has noed and discordance rawr lets joke about earrape. The last one is being fixed thank god.  
---
Okay but like that’s an opinion and not a fact so chill 
---
Not to me! 
---
They’re literally cows
---
I’ve never had an afk Freddy but that would be funny
---
I’ve only played against Freddy three matches, all were consecutive and against the same killer, who had the worst fucking connection in the world and almost made me uninstall DbD
---
I'd say swap Noed or whispers for sloppy, so you can track injured, or thanata so they are punished for not healing
---
It's called legacy or something, its for reaching prestige pretty much when the game first came out
---
There's a lot of nuance to using him but once you get him you got him.
---
Pro tip: go into options and change the controls for moving the camera left and right to Q and E. Congrats, you no longer need turn add-ons. Use Q and E to turn to get around the map, you don't use it to chainsaw Survivors. 
---
Chainsawing Survivors:
---
1: you have to run up to their back and then rev the chainsaw.
---
2: Billy's (and also Leatherface's) best add-ons are exclusively charge add-ons. Everything else they use is complete garbage. With Billy, you want to use a combination of either: The Thompson's Mix + Bright Bulb/Carburetor Tuning Guide or Spark Plug + Bright Bulb/Carburetor Tuning Guide. If you don't use Thompson's Mix (which isn't as common in webs as the Tuning Guide or Bulb) then you're going to be dealing with more cooldown when using the saw and it's harder to use the saw to catch up to Survivors and stop because the cooldown is about 2 second without add-ons. When you use the Mix, the cooldown is about 1 second.
---
Using Carburetor Guide + Thompson's Mix is his best set of add-ons. Survivor's bitch about this and call it "instant saw" even though it takes 2 seconds to rev the saw when using these add-ons.
---
You cannot use the Bulb + Guide to charge up the saw any faster than 2 seconds in case you were wondering.
---
3: once you're up on their back and rev the saw, Survivor's can 360 or do crazy and erratic movement to dodge. Your best bet is to either (A) follow their movement as best as you can or (B) stand still or maybe hold down (walk backwards) and let them run into your saw. This takes time to get used to and even the best Billy players can still whiff. Especially when a Survivor is using a macro for an instant 360 turn. 
---
4: when Survivor's are heading towards a pallet or a window that is the right time to rev the saw and go. It all depends on the layout and just getting used to how the maps are designed in regards to pallet placement. If they're heading towards a window, it's a 50/50 that they're baiting you and they're going to turn to the left or right. In that situation you have to make a read that they're going to head left or right. A good tell is when they're looking behind them as they approach window. This is something that takes time to get used to.
---
Have fun and show no mercy because Survivors won't show any mercy to you.
---
I'm actually trying to derank so I can have little mini games but swf teams are making that hard. So far I've double pipped the past 6 matches and I haven't had to go anywhere to 4k with 4 or 5 gens left. It's almost like people want to die.
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth.
---
What I’ve noticed a lot of nurses do is slug when it’s appropriate. Due to her ability to end chases quickly and efficiently, slugging is a decent tactic to stall time and prevent people from doing gens. 
---
OHHH its the legacy face? i know what legacy is i just couldnt see their faces 
---
oh god oh fuck!!
---
I mean, it does give unfair advantages in a game like this. No two ways about it.
---
"Below in terms of actual killing or winning chases effortlessly"
---
It's both. There is no reason, why both this of those things can't apply at the same time. The point is, that it's nearly impossible to get away, but it takes so much time for Legion to kill someone, that he's below mediocre. Just being able to always "win" a chase doesn't automatically makes you a good killer. 
---
In fact, every killer, except the nurse, can win every chase baseline even without using their power. They just have to follow the survivor in an intelligent way and they will catch up, because of their higher movement speed.
---
The only use for the power is to end chases more quickly right? He can't locate other survivors with it, except when he already got someone, he can't use it for mobility because the power gets drained, but he can vault and sprint. But if he is too good at it, meaning that you can't counter his ability to chase, then he just gets frustrating for the survivors and boring for the killer. But right know, without Frank's Mixtape, he's just bad. Legions Power needs a complete rework. Or else he will stay bad and boring, or overpowered and boring.
---
yes please increased fov looks so good in this game
---
His ability lets him ignore pallets and windows with less effort than the nurse and he basically can't miss hits because of the low cooldown. I don't know how that's "fine"
---
Tunneling as a term is so annoying to me, like dude im so sorry i didnt give you guys a chance to run half way across the map and full heal before i dropped your ass again
---
yeah the quality's really bad, sorry ;p
---
I just wanna look cute ;-;
---
Yes, please. Then I wouldn't have a headache from the horrifically narrow FOV after just a few matches. 
---
b u l g e 
---
I was trying to find you too! :( I love befriending pigs! 
---
yea i've edited a couple videos myself, i dont really do youtube anymore i just make videos for fun when im bored and unlist them. But I think you could make some good content like this with more visuals and stuff. keep it up and just have fun, dont get too dedicated (unless you can make a living off youtube by getting famous)
---
I was taking a break to eat. I'm back on now. 
---
Maybe?
---
ur that one little P3 killer at rank reset that uses ruin and noed
---
Joke's on you, buddy. I don't use either. Nice try, tho.
---
boys who wear black nail polish 🥰😍
---
As the killer, it's like settling down 4 of your kids and making them stay in their corner. They are running around, throwing things down, turning on these lights, trying to dirty the floor with their butts......... Yeah.... It's less when I'm a survivor 😆
---
The numbers on thanatophobia are so insignificant that I don’t think it really matters if it did or not. More often than not, you’ll get the trap off in one or two boxes and very rarely do you get it off in 3 or even 4 boxes. 
---
I think my biggest problem with Legion is that it really highlights that the game is mostly a M1 simulator.
---
Get hit, Legion runs off to hit someone else. Mend. Heal. Half a minute later the fucker zooms out of nowhere to do it again. Mend. Heal. I can't just hide since they just know where you are. Sure I can walk around injured, but it's still a risk if the Legion is running M&amp;A and you literally walk into them.
---
...that or you get the Legion that focuses on one person only. At that point you just accept your fate of not being able to pull off any mindgames since you really can't but any obstacles between you and the killer and just going down. It sucks
---
someone that wants a WGLF stack
---
Are you alright with constructive criticism? 
---
I could have sworn I selected shitpost when I first uploaded it, thanks for pointing it out, was my intention to have a different flair from the beginning
---
Maybe you should take the initiative and not stay in lobbies with red ping? Just a thought.
---
[30 seconds, 1 Google search, 1st result] (https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000444206-Is-voice-chat-available-in-game-). Can't be assed to help you not be a lazy douche nozzle beyond that.
---
I feel like you've gotten criticism before 
---
Having to go to work doesn't mean I can't prove it, lmfao. You're thick as hell.
---
And oh, like you've been talking down to me this whole time? Super hard yikes.
---
Thanks for providing proof. The only thing I’ve been all day on this thread. Kinda crappy you had to name call to get to this point.
---
Lol
---
Lol this happened to me last match. I didn't have a mori, but I wounded two people and hooked one, and then the whole team started to disconnect one by one, except for the person that I had on a hook.
---
What babies.
---
The exposed state always happens when I'm getting chased. Whether it's noed or michael it's always when I'm getting chased. Once me and my friend were the only 2 left against a Michael with mori on the 3rd stage and he was being chased all over. He lost him and he finds me and after like 3 seconds he gets 3rd stage and I got morried...
---
Right man, but I'm saying that it isn't a surefire way to tell, also I run play with your food so now I'm gonna get butthurt and act like this is a personal attack and end up shouting racial slurs at
---
In his power he wins chases without any input from the survivors. You can't loop, run, hide, or use any other tactics to actually win a chase. The best you can do is stun them and prolong it for an extra few seconds. The drawback is that, in his power, he wins chases very quick but requires more than 2 hits to down, which makes him weak. Unless the add-on Franks Mixtape is used, in which it takes only 2 hits, making him an incredibly broken and unfun killer, as you literally cannot escape him once he starts tunneling, and he downs you in less than 30 seconds. 
---
A survivor i take it? Lol
---
I haven’t been talking down to you and I never said because you work you couldn’t prove it. I’m saying when you threw out there I have to go work unlike some people. I’ve been at work all day you have some serious issues my dude. 
---
This post is 100% accurate, you're better off ignoring SWF and just going it alone
---
- Sincerely, a Killer main
---
Just leave him, he's being a willfully ignorant person at this point. You can't help him if he wants to be stupid.
---
What platform 
---
4 man SWF or just a SWF group? I'm pretty sure the devs oncd said the most common team comp is 2 man swf + 2 randoms.
---
Seems like you're the one who has issues, like Xyex said.
---
Are you claming that swf groups don't tell where hex totems are or tell people to take hits?
---
Thanks. 
---
Again SWF are not overpowered they and they are not going away simple and plain.
---
Killers dont need a buff to compensate for the SWF
---
Basically on the survivor side, Legion has 0 counterplay. If they choose to tunnel you, you are definitely going down. Legion using their power can run ridiculously fast, and negate the only ways survivors have of making distance on the killers (windows/pallets), not to mention the in built unrelenting 5000, so if they want to hit you, THEY WILL.
---
The issue is, they have to do this 4 times, even if you're already injured. It takes forever to do, but the survivor LITERALLY can't do anything about it. They just have to wait out the killer's ability cooldown till they can get another free hit.
---
They guarantee 1 kill with LITERALLY 0 counterplay, but they give up the chance of getting any more than that (MAYBE get a 2k) because of it. It's not fun for the survivor getting tunnelled, and it's not fun for the other 3 survivors playing M1 simulator. 
---
So yeah, they're frustrating to play against, but they're still bad. (They've never been Freddy tier, though, no matter what other people say)
---
OH MY GOD SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU
---
Wait you mean it's not?
---
I dabble in both. Face camping is a waste of your time and possible bloodpoints.
---
Nothing like a little faggotry 
---
I love tenacity and alert. I like going vroom vroom as a survivor and having as much information as possible on the killer lol. 
---
As for killer, I love mad grit, remember me, and blood warden. Nothing more fun then it being end game, managing to capture someone as the gate's taking forever to open, heading towards a hook while people try to body block, then hooking them and having blood warden proc. It's a crazy amount of good circumstance when that happens, but boy, is it always worth it lol
---
I'm a self-care crutch perk user and I use enduring quite frequently. I never got the hang of dead hard and I always forget when I put on DS, so I never use those two. I'm also too impatient to use urban evasion soooo. For killer, I don't really know what's meta besides ruin, which I do use occasionally, though not always. Brutal strength? I never use that. 
---
I used to run lightweight back when it was good, but it stopped being good so. I used to run devour hope, but after enough games of not getting a good use out of it, I quit on it. 
---
That's some bullshit
---
&gt; multiple flashlight saves and constant bodyblocking is breaking the game for me
---
See, those two are things you can easily counter. Flashlights = don't pick up survivors on the open, look at wall or bait the save. Bodyblocking = just hit the survivors bodyblocking right away, unless they're injured and you know they have Dead Hard. Eve if everyone bodyblocks and the survivor wiggles, you just got so much pressure by injuring multiple survivors.
---
Seems like solid advice, I'd go with it.
---
Sincerely, a Killer main
---
I know that but I wanna have fun. Angry oink. 😤
---
Super F
---
I no longer care about the game if I reach that point. I'm not promoting facecamping, just wanna do it right if a survivor gets me petty enough
---
except for the fact that you dont and these survive with friends are not these gods and are normal people
---
There’s been numerous researches on this sub alone tho about how it doesn’t actually increase your chances to get rarer items. It pretty much only gives you the bloodied cosmetics. 
---
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about :-)
---
if you think tunneling is effective killer gameplay then you dont know how to play killer. Its better to split pressure because when you tunnel one person that means 3 people were on gens with no pressure the entire time you were chasing one guy.
---
**NANI?** *Gets morried*
---
Guard the basement chest or since you’re pig crouch to the first gen you see and face it pretending to work on it. See if you can scare someone like that
---
Good counter argument would debate again
---
Honestly not the worst way to go if Jigsaw catches me. 
---
Thanks 
---
Solo queue low rank survivor during rank reset.
---
I’ve been running small game and it’s the best thing ever. I’ve stopped so many NoEDs from happening, plus easy bold points and rip ruin
---
The only time I'm ok with this meme
---
Oof Legion. I'm surprise no one Disconnected.
---
dude
---
I could not give less of a shit how the Survivors feel as I'm playing Killer
---
I'll play however I damn well please, it's not my job to coddle the Survivors and make sure to hold their hand as I escort them to the hatch
---
"staying low isn't an option"
---
yeah ok
---
if you're unhooked at least outside of the Killer's terror radius then it's often very easy to get away from the area without much trouble
---
I know because I've done it myself many many times
---
Save up for Spirit so you get all three of her good perks.
---
I just stopped. Guess I got lucky enough to get tired of this game's shit faster than any other game.
---
I play all night until around 4am eastern standard time.
---
Xbox one. On Backwater Swamp playing Myers, a few of the fallen trees on the ground were neon white and textureless. They were so bright, I would get blinded when survivors hid near them.
---
Yeah, I know people don’t like the term “gen rush” and I see why but the fact that they can get done that fast is straight up ridiculous. 
---
... You just said something else completely devoid of substance. Could you be a little better at voicing what you think?
---
It's a pic, what else is there to talk about? lol But I see your point
---
Don't play Legion
---
Jack the ripper? I mean it makes sense with the victorian era cosmetics.
---
Didn’t the 2nd oneDC?
---
As a killer, a "safe" pallet would be a pallet that isn't going to get thrown in your face. Often enough, you can get a lunge attack through one. A lot of inexperienced killers will see a survivor running through a pallet and either walk right into it and get stunned, or miss out on what could have been an easy down because they were too careful. 
---
I never heard about toxicity until I came to this sub. Everyone's pretty decent on PS4, never had any trouble. Probably coz it takes three times as long to send a piss message than it does with a keyboard 
---
OH NO! HEX RUIN!
---
Say you were being tunneled and your teammate tried to bodyblock for you the killer could easily walk past your teammate and still attempt to go for you 
---
Mega F
---
Yes and no. It's pretty much the closest possible legit perk counter to DS. Even though you have to ignore the Obsession the entire time and if they don't get gens done then oops, you just wasted a perk slot. 
---
It's not as strong as Bitter Murmur because when you see other Survivors it's just like the Doctor's Madness and you'll see their silhouette for a second. It's very good on Freddy because unless the Obsession is in the dream state then they can't see him.
---
On the plus side, Survivors can't counter this perk and there's a decent chance the Obsession will just DC the instant they notice they're the Obsession and don't have DS. On the down side it's end game only so if you're doing well then you just wasted a slot.
---
Use your better judgement. DS sucks and there's not much you can really do about it. Clown can kind of counter DS if he has Enduring. What you do is that you down them, throw a bottle on the ground over their body, pick them up, stand still in the gas cloud, and if they DS you they can't get far not unless there's a nearby pallet or window. Unfortunately this only works against the Obsession. 
---
My point was the fact that someone chased person for entire game, loses and claims victory, the toxic part was due to killers message, but whatever was your point I don't understand. DbD community is truly sensitive snowflakes, I play both killer and survivor, or more like I played, since I don't play DbD as of lately, I meet way more toxic killers, that's my experience in dbd, survivors using perks to survive don't matter to me, nor killer perks, whatever you use is up to you, but the moment you're being immature and disrespectful at the end of match lobby, I consider that toxic, not the perks, but the people, have a good day:)
---
Rancor is pretty great on Hag, IMO. She's got good map range so catching the obsession at the end is a lot easier.
---
Btw good job!
---
Unfortunately they don’t do figures. It’s just costume and prop merch as well as pins. 
---
And there are people who legitimately believe Adrenaline isn't a crutch perk. Poor Bubba.
---
That just means that your teammate is bad at bodyblocking. It's not hard to stay right in front of the Killer and prevent them from landing a hit. 
---
*JahPods
---
He DC’ed right as he died but I still got the points for the sacrifice so yes and no.?? (･_･; ?
---
If you dont listen to his rules, you are game over. Look at the scene where Jigsaw only wanted to talk with Eric. Eric didnt listen and so he lost. I love Jigsaw.
---
That’s only one scenario there’s still multiple ways tunneling isn’t fair 
---
Were they injured, and did you get stunned by the pallet?
---
I mean yes, you've already indicated you don't think about other people, you didn't need to repeat it.
---
As for the killer radius comment, let's quote me...
---
&gt;not even staying low, because if someone is tunneling then they aren't going to give the survivor the chance to stay low. Obviously this one isn't as cut and dry, but a halfway competent killer will not give someone that option
---
So yes? Way to clarify what I said?
---
I did, I miss it time to time but boy is my apartment quieter
---
Please elaborate on those ways
---
shouldnt they be switched?
---
Tier 3 Spaghetti Code
---
Sometimes you just gotta accept you arent gonna win a chase and go look for somebody else. 
---
Oof. You edited a 7 minute video w/ your phone. That just sounds painful.
---
Nope.  Everyone freaks out when they can't see the mori, when often it's a cypress.
---
I’m not getting any DCs on Xbox version. 
---
Spoilers pls
---
Nani?! 
---
I like this, will test it out tomorrow 
---
To make the chase end fast and end consistently. If you look at the ground and walk towards them it's buggy as hell and won't end the chase every time.
---
By looking backwards the chase ends every time and ends fast.
---
Then you look at the ground because the chase won't start unless you are actively looking at them.
---
i hate this 
---
No lie... I burnt the offering where I spawn far away from the killer in Leary Memorial..... 8 seconds into the match I am the first one found, chased, and hooked. What a waste of an offering................
---
You must be a survivor main because I’m rank 8 so I have to be doing something right to get there   I want you to do gens but with a green toolbox and leader with 4 friends tell me then that gens are fine
---
I had a Claudette crouch at the gates while me and my two friends did 3 gens and ran the killer for like 14 minutes.
---
He had been hooked only once so after the game I asked what he was doing. He said if he hadn't sat at the gates we wouldn't have escaped. Because he opened the gate. Jesus.
---
Believe it or not I do but if I’m chasing someone and there are survivors on different gens what do I do then hm 
---
Nah I play hag, huntress,Myers 
---
Don’t use fire up, it’s bad. 
---
The joke was that they would be able to run faster than other survivors
---
So you have to know what a slang term for a nurse build is to be good at this game? No wonder people make fun of this subreddit so much. It really is a complete joke.
---
Seriously?
---
&gt; 2. Buff killers or nerf survivors IN SPECIFIC WAYS. Its no secret that really good SWF teams can bully medium to high skill killers, and that a good 80% of killers are simply not viable options against these teams. How do you expect a wraith player to stand any chance against 4 Claudettes with flashlights, decisive strikes, borrowed time, die hard, and sprint burst COMBINED with the fact that they are giving away vital information about the killer, making coordinated plans against how they want to take the killer on, and talking through situations instead of running blindly doing what is normally expected but not directly told? I'm not saying make survivors super weak or killers super strong, but I am saying that there should NEVER be a time when survivors can literally BULLY a killer.
---
&gt; 
---
1 How exactly can you ban discord? And as you said that would kill the game of any survivors who play the game also this would only work on pc and not on xbox or PS3 so that would fix 1/3 of the community
---
2 How exactly do you buff and nerf survivors because people that are not in groups will suffer as well and would just piss of the survivor community.Although you might share the same POV with tyde I would suggest against using him as a source seeing how even the killer community doesnt seem to agree on why the fuck he exist 
---
Last I will say it again not all SWF are these godly loopers that communicate Id say less than 10% of the SWF are like that the rest or either toxic as hell and still lose or they are mediocore at best.SWF are one of the few things fun about being a survivor making it harder to make them fun or trying to get rid of them WILL kill the community
---
Well I wish the devs put different objects in to distract the survivors otherwise this game is going to crash 
---
Even if someone is caught easier, it doesn't even have to be because they're any worse at running. There are parts of map that are just worse for having a long chases and limit the options of a survivor, and even chasing someone until they drop a single pallet then leaving them alone makes that part of the map less safe in the future.  Eventually even good survivors can run out of options and seem like a very weak link.
---
Fishing around the map to find the survivors that have the right combination not being as good/being in an unfavorable location for them in order to have fast chases is how you beat these coordinated teams.  Even if you can only get 1 hit on someone quick before you need to leave to stop other gens from popping, it can be progress and does slow the game down.  Basically don't tunnel vision 1 survivor since it is 4v1 and use time effectively to manage all 4.
---
A lot of the ones that others mentioned. But also, little things like how on Haddonfield, the lights flicker if there's an unfinished gen in the house. Or logistical things like what stacks, how the crows work, and stuff like that. 
---
There was so much hype leading up to that episode too
---
oh so you mean like Noed
---
People that kill themselves as soon they get Hooked because you are working on a gen and not immediately saving them. 
---
Holy shit dude
---
Again, the choice isn't between winning or losing, it's between winning like an asshole or winning but not like an asshole. I main killer (when I can, for some reason people don't want to play survivor, I can't imagine why when people with your mindset are rampant) and have no qualms about winning, but I see no reason to be an asshole when doing so.
---
As for bad unhooks, let's again look at what I said.
---
&gt;not one thing you list is in the control of the person who is getting tunneled
---
So yeah, saying "do better unhooks" is pointless when the person getting fucked has no control over when they get unhooked. Further, I do blame survivors for shitty unhooks, but killers in those situations are perfectly capable of choosing to not be an asshole in response. If they choose to be an asshole, I will call them an asshole.
---
It either does nothing (entirely possible it's bugged) or more likely of the four survivor spawn-ins it chooses, it puts you in the furthest one (which makes it basically a useless offering).
---
Or when the survivor is lagging. Endless free Dead Hard perk 😂 only to get backfired later when the ping gets even worse 🤣
---
From a Trapper main,you must be precise with trap placement,it has happened that survivors walk through my trap without using Dead hard.
---
Especially when trying to enjoy a double bloodstream/holiday event.

Thaaaat sucks. I play Legion (I'm only rank 14, but w/e) and I do it in a way that follows his intended playstyle.
---
It sucks that I keep immediately getting disconnected against whenever people see what killer it is, because some people are abusing the powers.
---
Thank for the response, looks like I’m gonna have some grinding to do this event.
---
leave them and go check the gens :P
---
I feel like im the only one who plays this game for fun.
---
If it’s the last gen and people are dedicated to it,just pull them off,don’t swing 
---
does anyone truly get mad playing this game? if so...go play for honor.....please....you'll feel differently.  
---
Repairing gens, you?
---
PlayStation?
---
When I play against legion
---
I think you miss understand the 10% is the godly the rest are normal and toxic. no offense I think you put waay to much faith in this community because the way I see it this isnt one community I see multiple smaller communities arguing over basically everything hell people cant even agree on killers are good.Im sorry that you seen these toxic as hell people but the entire SWF community shouldn't suffer for the people who wants to put this game in the ground like tyde
---
Hell yeah. I'm not the only one.
---
The only person who ever plays this game (and thats like once a month because I think he low key (smartly) hates it and knows to avoid it since it isn't fun most of the time) legit refuses to tell me where totems are. He wants those points for himself dammit.
---
Yes there is, season 16, the Season of Grandeur. You can earn butterfly wings.
---
Started today, only a few hours ago. :)
---
My friends lost to a michael that only had rank 1 pwyf no add ons. I feel ya.
---
How?
---
I respect that notion, and see more clearly what you represent.
---
I don't want all swf to suffer, just to be more balanced so that a good 4 man wont utterly stomp a killer, y'know, like thanos said
---
LOL!
---
Lol, I like playing games with piggy
---
Ok I leave them he heals I start another chase but I’ll stop the chase and check the gens it would never end 
---
Did someone watch monto today?
---
Depending on your level and how many you take down in a game Rancor could be a waste of a perk. Hex ruin and haunted ground together is interesting. If you can get the legion perk that notifys you when two survivors are on a Gen could be fun.
---
Thrill of the hunt, Ruin, Haunted Grounded, Devour Hope, daughter ring, prayer beads. Protector of the totems
---
Right. I think nurse is the worst killer. Learning her is the worst and once you do, it's easy mode. The stun is annoying and it's all you see at rank 1. Legion is boring nurse without any real map pressure. But he isn't op just stupid.
---
TRAPPER NOOOOOO!
---
This meme still relevant??
---
Also how hard is it to properly edit
---
Like, don't misunderstand me but I do feel like maybe killers got it worse but I never felt like my point of view regarding this was invalidated here. Meanwhile angry posts about being face-camped and etc are usually shouted down or heavily downvoted. It's always the victim blaming when killers are being toxic. "wEre yOU teabAGGing?" or "YOU JUST WANT TO BULLY THE KILLER!" and to make it worse, this shit is spilling into other horror games like Last Year.   
---
It has gotten to the point to where I have to make a mandatory "Hey fellow killers let's take it easy then try to be open minded as survivors have issues as well." comment anytime a survivor types a single damn sentence. 
---
It requires the gates to be powered to activate. That in and of itself makes the perk situational and thus quite mediocre.
---
well if your tunneling and seeing someone rush towards a hook and you preventing them from doing that its still 2 gens
---
You didnt even try to look in the front page have you? 
---
The Survivor didn't get screwed over by their teammate if I don't hook them again. So. It's either
---
A: I down and hook them again, doing my job to the best of my ability, and get called an asshole for it
---
or B: I don't punish the reckless behavior and let the Survivor go away without a fight, the exact opposite of my job. 
---
Stop trying to say that I'm an asshole for doing my job the absolute best that I can. It isn't my fault you got unhooked when I was eight feet away. 
---
This is me just snatching the pot and chugging the coffee on playing the game and visiting the sub. lol
---
So what happens when they get your totem? I just went against pig but it wasn’t you, they were rank 5 I believe. 
---
I just cant see a good way to balance it gen debuffs wont make a difference and thats really the only to balance survivors these days oh and loops which were already blackbeared nerfed
---
You talk about how effective tunneling is but it’s only effective in like rank 17-20 because the survivors don’t know what they’re doing. Doesn’t make your tactic good if you’re versing bad survivors 
---
You're saying stuff that's very very dumb. Yeah, I can't prevent gens from being done and hook people at the same time. I can't be in two places at once. What the hell are you trying to say? That I should never hook people, ever? Sure, I'll just slug everyone, because THAT will surely go well for me. 
---
This is my story
---
What do you mean? I was simply saying that you acting petty was a good solution to your problems. 
---
Every damn night!
---
*ahem*
---
RANK
---
DOES
---
NOT
---
DETERMINE
---
SKILL
---
Now then, to debate your point: No. It's a viable tool to use against Survivors of almost any skill level because it kills people sooner and ensures at least one person is not doing gens. 
---
They said on a stream they were going to make adjustments Nurse. Not going to respond to the second half because you sound like a shill. Happy New Year! 
---
Not to the point that legion has reached and the player base is more split for the dislike of Freddy than legion. 
---
I'll run No Mither David to make things interesting lol. 
---
No, it doesn't. The gates get powered in just about every game imaginable, so it's always useful. 
---
Survivors: Complain about one decent perk
---
Also survivors: Runs team all using DS, Borrowed time, self healing and urban evasion.
---
Killers: ???
---
But the real issue is that players are what makes the end game not interesting. The devs have to make it so the player base can’t ruin it for themselves, it’s not as simply as, “Mak[ing] the end game interesting,” 
---
Its your fault how you behave. You have self control, you could choose to not be an asshole.
---
Further, you are following the similar appallingly silly logic I see get thrown around this sub all the time. "But if I don't act like an asshole, my only other option is to run to a corner and stop playing." What? No. The real list of options go
---
A: down and hook them again, being an asshole in the process because this isn't necessary to win and you are ruining someone's experience (and rewarding shitty play by someone else)
---
B: be an idiot and just let everyone go away.
---
C: down and hook the unhooker. If they are making a bad unhook, that means you are in a perfect position to do this. You are going to win this game and you don't behave like an asshole to do it.
---
Since there is no reason other than being an asshole to choose option A over C the majority of the time, making that choice makes you an asshole.
---
Im telling you that your an idiot if you think tunneling is the best strat because the healthy person would go right back to whatever gen instead of trying to be this asshole who will win at any cost think it through.Where did I ever say slug everyone or to never hook someone.I see you as that person that say "survivors are too OP" while you have your thumb up your ass trying to get easy kills want to play a game where you get to slaughter people DbD isnt for you

If you can edit sound you can also edit fucking video

I've slugged a few and kept people away until they bled out after touching my sexy statue. I have no qualms about taking you straight to the basement. I am running a basement build after all..... 😤

"As they come in?" What the fuck does this even mean? Are you assuming that I have the person hooked in the basement? Buddy, in that situation, BOTH of you are going down. If I hit a guy AS HE'S ENTERING THE BASEMENT, then one of you is going to stay there, most likely both of you, as said earlier. Even in this situation, it's a good idea to still hit the guy who was just unhooked, because it will ensure the Entity gets summoned or a death. 
---
ur right dude, I should just walk to the open exit gate where you won't be so you can get the free save and all leave holding hands.
---
Main bing bong. Your life will be better
---
If someone goes for an unhook when you are right there, then it's not very difficult to hit them before they finish the unhook....
---
Those two actions are not related in the slightest. 
---
I have some great, fun games as and against the pig.
---
The other day I jump on a generator in the middle of the road (Haddonfield). Soon after, Laurie Strode runs across the street and joins me. I'm rotating the cam back and forth and see someone running at the end of the street so keep my camera there for a moment. I turn back looking straight forward, happily repairing my generator when all of a sudden I realise... Laurie isn't crouched next to me doing the generator anymore? Someone is though. It's the fucking pig! I swear I could not have looked away for more than five seconds!
---
This game is a joke, impossible to take seriously at this point
---
Yes, but that's a very specific situation. As I said, I will often try to down both of you in the basement, but if I have to choose one person, I'm gonna go for the guy who is going to be on the second or third stage of the sacrifice process. 
---
LMAO it's this dude, from the long list of people who get salty when they lose. 
---
Yes
---
Console pleb that's what you get
---
You can't really deal with them. They make pallets and windows not exist so you get the longest chases from just running in a straight line
---
People have been saying that for awhile now
---
He chased her for 2.5 minutes. That's not SUPER long. And the only other person he saw was a decisive strike player. He literally saw no one else; giving up a sure chase to try and FIND someone else, no matter if you're doctor, wraith or any other character that counters stealth, is a very very big risk. What if they're SWF on VOIP? What if the other players are just as attentive?
---
As far as the pallet goes...he saw the Meg, accounted for her. He didnt realize there'd be a 3rd player nearby (or perhaps even following him from behind) waiting to pallet drop. Sure he couldve baited a drop, but it burns time to do that every single time...
---
Honestly there’s nothing you can do about them. Just do gens and hope you don’t get chosen by the tunneling machine. 
---

---
The problem comes when you have no choice to drop the pallet early and it's clear the hit was unfair. I play killer and get unfair hits all the time because I just swing through pallets knowing that most the time I won't get punished for lunging at a pallet I know is gonna stun me. Vacuum pallets were imbalanced but also these new pallets are imbalanced 
---
I saved Adam from a hook once...so here cool now...
---
Well, I almost never get a 4 man kek. I normally just let the last survivor have the hatch because I don't wanna deal with the standoff. Sometimes I kill 3 people before two gens are done, and in that case, I get a 4K, but most of the time 2 gens have already been done. And it's always *exactly* two gens. Never three. It's weird. I don't know why that happens to me so often. 
---
Yes the issue is there is none and rank 10 killer
---
Well it has lost a lot of its playerbase 
---
Yeah just doing it for fun and boredom that’s all, thank you! I’ll work on more visuals 
---
Trapper’s hitbox is 90% horizontal I swear you can be directly on the other side of him and he hits 
---
No, not really. Sure, if I do nothing *but* tunnel the whole the game, then I'll lose, but that applies to basically every action a Killer can take. 
---

After the 4 legion I just wanted to D/C so bad
---
Damnnnn that sucks. BIG F.
---
Balanced Landing is easily better
---
Well I hope I get your game. I love fun stuff like that!
---
Any hope of legion getting a rework?
---
Whatever I’m not going to sit here and at the same thing but at the end of the day the game needs to be changed or updated 
---
Yeah I know you have to be precise but it should still be slightly larger, as it is now you can literally watch the survivor step on it while they're running past it (even worse when you see their foot step in the middle of it) and it do nothing and  when you try to do the exact same thing following their direct path you get trapped in it instead.
---
It's stupid.
---
And it should still be higher hitbox so they can't simply vault over it like it isn't there.
---
Him and Freddy are just annoying af. And doctor is also one people forget that is the OG of slow annoying games. The only way for them to be successful is to drag on games for decades which sucks
---
Yes but not gens
---
But this isn't a professional fighting game. The Dynamics of this game are wildly different.
---
And again, I want to draw you to your own words. You say "take advantage of the mistakes of your opponents." The issue is that one person is making a mistake and *another person is being prevented from playing the game at all*. Not "lose." Not "have a harder time." They are effectively removed from the game.
---
It's bad game design, but you as a human being have the ability to not reinforce it. Choosing to reinforce it is being an asshole.
---
You really can't. With this amazing logic of yours, bullying is a tool. It's the survivors job!
---
This was about tunneling though... so yes, yes really lmao
---
I suppose if you do nothing but one thing all game you will lose, yes.
---
Ah yes michael or Michelle
---
Yep. I do that all the time when using wraith. I’ll slip into invisibility outta nowhere during a chase to check on a gen, surprise attack them, then find the guy I was chasing before again and smack them down. Big pressure moves 💯
---
Yet you don't deny that you tunnel, thus meaning you dont understand why people are listing it as a/the reason... :thonk:
---
This is def the top piece of killer advice. Eat ALL pallets
---
How so? There’s usually around 20-30k people playing each day on pc. And we don’t know about the console population 
---
True true, can't say I haven't done it though. As a killer main I have a huge ego when I play survivor. 
---
Maybe in a year or two. Look how long it's taking to rework Freddy and Legion *just came out*.
---
F I N G E R G U N S
---
Yeah
---
Probably not for a while if it does happen, truly a sad moment for the game though

But that’s what I love about trapper,he is so underpowered,so when you do good with him,it feels amazing

earlier today I played a game of killer and the survivors had an Insta dc so I farmed enough points to pip and then let them all escape. I the switched over to survivor, had 2 Insta dcs on my team and the doc main just smashed us both. what a cruel world to live in
---
It seriously happens so much sometimes that I just have to play something else because it's extremely annoying especially when it's loading into a game and you lose your offering!
---
Maybe you’re just bad at map control
---
It isn't my fault that the game is designed poorly. Again, my job is not to be nice or to make sure everyone has a good time, my job is to kill people. Trust me, I'd love a mechanic where you could slap away someone's hand as they try to you off the hook. It would've saved my life countless times. But that isn't a thing in the game, so I have to deal with it just as much as everyone else. I have a job to do as a killer, and I am going to make sure it gets done. I could say that using an instaheal is an asshole thing to do, or that Brand New Part is something that only assholes use, and the obvious fact that SWF is an even more obnoxious failure of game design than anything you've mentioned so far. If we're gonna go down the stupid game design route, I will win that argument, hands down. Trust me, you don't wanna go there.

Bad at ending chases? What does that have to do with anything I just said? What I said was that it's impossible to do two things at once. I can't be in a chase and patrol gens at the same time. This is an objective fact, and is the only thing I stated above. 
---
Haha I do SWF without voice comms (Except with my girlfriend) but after each match in my chat the bottom section is so true.   
---
"KHRYN!  YOU IDIOT.  YOU USED SO MANY PALLETS EVEN THE NEXT MATCH WON'T HAVE ANY."

Steam. Infinite loading screen.. Either the screen freezes or it shows animation with text changing but no Loading bar progress.. Just lost a BPS and an Escape Cake to that happening twice in 5 games.
---
I hate slugging people. It's boring. I'd much rather just end the game quickly and get on with the next one, hopefully with Survivors that are challenging enough to offer some engagement. 
---
If you end chases quickly you can go back and patrol gens. It shouldn’t be a waste of you’re time if you don’t suck. Sure you can’t be in 2 places at once, but last time I checked time management was a factor of the game. 
---
Damn

4 = Feng Max

---
But your argument towards mine doesnt correlate to the person asking the question. If he didn't mention that they were on sale, (which means he is going to buy killers as opposed to unlocking them in-game) then your argument towards me wouldn't make any sense. If he said just unlocking a character, then yes, it would make sense. Pay attention :P
---
The correct answer here is that you and I can do whatever the fuck we want as long as it's not against the rules. [That includes teabagging, flashlight flickering, tunneling, camping, etc.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest)
---
There's literally no right or wrong, what you're talking is playstyle preference - you wanna tunnel, go ahead, I don't give a shit. But don't EVER complain about the other side without looking past your own flaws - which, in your terms, "bullying"
---
So, no, I won't 'fuck' out of here with that shit.
---
And no, a survivor's job can be whatever. The killer can pip without killing - and the survivor can pip without escaping. So there is no "job" anymore. Maybe in the older updates where in the past you needed one kill to pip, but not anymore. It's all about participating more or less in the match.

I'm not going to DC anymore though.   Think I'm just gonna take my tunnel and camps like a good dead.  
---
We weren't talking about ending chases quickly or not. We were talking about gens getting done while you are in a chase, you have the guy injured, and the last gen pops giving him a free escape. Chases are generally not very hard for me. They tend to take about 30-45 seconds for me to complete.

Just played a game where we all lost because everyone got fucked up by traps
---
But remember the intention is to be i m m e r s e d
---
Yes, but for if the gens are always getting completed in most of your games as you said the first logical assumption is you have poor map control. Then if your  next excuse is not being able to chase and patrol, that means you’re spending too much time chasing one person to prevent gen progression. Either way blaming Adrenaline for your short comings is silly, git gud 
---
I brought up camping now just because it usually goes hand in hand with tunneling and why they are  bad I was on auto pilot.
---
However
---
&gt;Who said anything about..."early"? 
---
Well, let's quote my very first reply to you....
---
&gt;The issue with tunneling *early*, of course, is that it effectively prevents....
---
I've also repeatedly talked about there being exceptions to it being an asshole thing to do, yet here you are stating I'm saying to never do it (shoot, I haven't in this thread but I think that once doors are powered straight up face camping should be *assumed*, not just acceptable).
---
Maybe you should take some breaths and work on reading things with the goal of actually understanding them before arguing.

gens get completed in every game regardless of skill even the best killers have gens get done and i already fucking said that i get chases done quickly i am fucking done with this discussion 
---
Doesn't stack

Umm he just said he was the survivor 
---
Ok pal, git gud tho 
---
Git gud.
---
Lol what was his name?
---
Was it in the swamp?
---
I really only play these days for new pets. :(
---
Maybe next season. Thanks for the info though!
---
It used to do that, but they changed it because they don't want perks modifying brightness because they want the maps to always look the same way to prevent bugs ect
---
nothing they did was toxic though? all this shows is you got salty and called them cunts and that right there is toxic 
---
This is not a safe pallet definition, lol.
---
A safe pallet is a pallet that the killer has to break cause going around it would take too much time.  Unsafe pallets are easily just bypassed by going around.  
---
I actually disagree with toxic being bad, to a degree.  Many popular streamers would be considered toxic by this sub’s standards. Mind you I’m not talking Ochido level, but I think for streaming, viewers tend to like a little toxicity from time to time. I think it makes it more entertaining. 
---
One of my favorite moments ever was I found the hatch when I had a key while the only other surviving player was being chased.  The hatch was in the killer shack and I heard the heartbeat so I popped out of the shack, did the "Come here" sign at the survivor.. They banked and headed towards me.  I popped the hatch just as the other survivor slammed the shack pallet on the killer and we both escaped.  
---
Not once in my 3k hours have I had to wait more than 5 seconds for a survivor match, and I'm a survivor main too... Killer lobbies have taken up to 30+ mins for me though
---
Mercy is for the weak. With an attitude like that guy has, it makes you not want to help people out. 
---
&gt;You don’t have to be that excited you got out by pallet looping
---
It’s the classic case of a killer just playing bad, but screaming about toxic SWF for no reason.
---
Yeah this is like the least toxic match I have ever heard of.
---
He’s not complaining about the pallet loops, he’s complaining about the teabagging. 
---
He's complaining about both. Why bring up the pallet looping if he's not mad about it?
---
Sick chirp kiddo. 
---
It’s okay. The dead man cares not for the thoughts of the living as he is enjoying his eternal slumber.
---
Obviously, mate. If you don't know what it's called, you can't win with/against it. /s
---
So it is a project the back of it has the whole description and stuff. For the kids privacy I am not gonna show that 
---
I think he’s just addressing it, not complaining. Hey OP, are you mad about the pallet looping?
---
I don't feel like this any more, think I just numbed my anger behind "gg" as a copeing mechanism (regardless if it was a good game or not).
---
Space Esports has been doing weekly tournaments with Marth for a few weeks now. 
---
[deleted]
---
I know you can just skip them 
---
Yeah instead you should make it one. I’d rather kill myself than have a second chance, amirite?
---
Came here to say this. QUALITY shitpost!
---
Here in show biz, we call that sweater a foreshadowing.
---
This is a stupid mentality.
---
Giving the survivors a 'chance to have fun' is asking to let them gen rush you and escape.
---
Tbagging and being toxic to a killer who did nothing more than kill you however is just you being a toxic cunt.
---
Sure, you can do it. But unlike the killer downing and hooking you, tbagging does NOTHING towards helping you actually win. It's the equivalant of a killer slashing you repeatedly while pn hook. It serves no purpose other than to be a dick.
---
So equating being a dick to the killer by tbagging because he did his job and killer you is just really dumb on your part.
---
Fact of the matter is, killers aren't there to entertain you or 'give you a chance'.
---
The game is already HIGHLY survivor oriented and yet you feel the killer should go easy on you and give you a bigger advantage?
---
And this is coming from a Survivor main.
---
Being on the receiving end of a tunneler isn't fun. But the killers job is to kill you, not ensure you have a 'fun' time.
---
So either play better or move onto the next match and get over it.
---
Nurse looks amazing!
---
Nope. The primary goal was to address t-bagging at the exit gate. 
---
Does this make him Legion?
---
I was already working on Sally so you're in luck
---
There could be a few reasons.
---
 1. Maybe you camped so they did that
---
 2. Tunneled
---
 3.hot on hook
---
 4. They are just jack asses honestly 
---
Did you camp or tunnel or hit on hook? If not then they prob just being assholes to try to piss you off 
---
I'm learning this the hard way. Wish I would have read this a long time ago.
---
Yes but why mention pallet looping?
---
At this point, if you play leatherface then you gotta play the part
---
Teabagging isn't toxic?
---
Ah you know what, even if it is, you guys are right. I'm being a big crybaby and just need to git gud.
---
Still pissed tho, haha. 
---
Yeah those are good. Are you a hag main by chance?
---
I agree. I'm just saying, the bullying can easily be elivated with swf. Whats worse, a group of randoms who want to annoy the killer, or a group of people who talked prior AND during the game who go in planned and ready to annoy the killer. A good player can be bad, but a group dedicated to it who can discuss what to do can be FAR worse. 
---
It's like math, i guess. One survivor trying to bully is like multiplying, SWF is squared. 
---
Great argument chock-full of good, reliable evidence to back up your claim
---
Honestly, the only things toxic that they did was the teabagging and maybe the chat (idk what they actually said so I can't judge them for that). Other than that, everything they did just sounds more sweaty than toxic. Running meta perks/builds just means they're trying to win and the whole SWF thing... I mean what? Are you gonna fault them for playing with their friends? You even said that you made mistakes during the match and that's not their fault, it's yours. If anything, you're more toxic than them calling them cunts. As someone who exclusively plays killer, I have dealt with plenty of SWF and I've put up with a lot of bullshit but in the end I can't really fault them for what they do. They're just trying to win and most of the problems with SWF lies more with the game itself than the people. What I'm trying to say is: Look, we've all been there. Sometimes you get the 4k, sometimes everyone escapes. They do things you don't like and I guarantee you do things they don't like. Best advice I can give is just suck it up and move on to the next game. 
---
If you like keeping tabs on the killer, I would recommend trying alert instead of dark sense. Dark sense only shows you the killer's aura when YOU complete a gen and when the last one pops regardless so you on average get use out of it 2 or 3 times most matches. Plus, unless you know the killet is chasing a teammate, you can generally assume he's coming your way after you've popped a gen. Alert will show you the killer every time he kicks a pallet or a gen which is far more often per match. I think you'll really like it. Good luck!
---
Only if the killer DCs using the in game option. If the killer DCs by pulling their internet, then the survivors lose everything and don’t get the 5K points. 
---
Want to bet? That’s why I still have less the 4K after that game. And the killer has more avenues for points. They get shit when people rage quit, unlike the survivor
---
Tbh I think the game would be funnerror if when you hide in lockers your screen would go blank and you would only be able to see out of the 3 slots like in one of the first trailers.
---
yes, but my point is, DCs are a big problem for both sides
---
Never getting snacks have I gone afk. I've gone maybe twice but once was me getting something for someone and the other time had to give my dog her insulin shot. 
---
But if you're making popcorn so help me I will take you down!
---
Of course they are. 
---
But that is absolutely not clear in the post I was replying to. 
---
Plus IF they actually were a 4 man SWF, doesn’t even sound like they were on voice comm if Nea led the killer to the shack where a gen was being worked on by 2 people. That wouldn’t happen.
---
It is a perk in the game sure ... but it’s overused and OP IMO ... oh cool, you can you can see all the survivors every time you hook someone? It’s one of the few ways people have found gets to certain killers who are playing like a scrub again getting out should be enough and is most of the time ... Come on .. the killers are faster and can hit people .. how is that ok to show where I’m at every hook ? Especially one-hit killers like the billy or LF... and when you use Op perks as a killer and you basement/hook camp.. what else can a Survivor do to make you feel the way they did while you were standing in front of the hook hitting him ...  just can’t let it throw you off your game ... 
---
Ye I love discordance I got legion to 42 the week he/she came out. I’ve yet to get it on the spirit.
---
I once had to AFK as Nurse because I thought one of my cats had fallen down the stairs. Thankfully she didn't, it was just a box she tossed down, but still that fucking horrified me. That's the one and only time I have gone AFK during a game for any reason.
---
SO many people teabag just to say that they got out. It's crazy. I've started playing killer and I don't camp or do anything toxic, and my perks are all pretty whatever things, and people still teabag at the gate/behind pallets in almost every round.
---
Dang man, I thought you would think I was really smart and then get scared and not respond
---
DUDEEEE THE HEART BEATS.... Buying both even if you can get them for free. That's some awesome looking stuff imo
---
You’re going to have to get me a source on that dude. 
---
I personally believe that is exactly what the devs intended to happen. 
---
it's fine dude , dont worry about it :)
---
Oh man that feeling is the absolute worst when you think your pet fell down the steps! My dogs blind and I have to keep the door shut for her! It's freaking terrifying!
---
That would be one my top priorities if I were you. Discordance is really good for spirit because of her ability to pull people off gens so easily, and with most gens only being able to have 2 or 3 people working on it at max, gen pulls are pretty much guaranteed. 
---
Ah, I thought I put a question mark. If we wanna play semantics my statement isn’t false as those are the names and I’ve already explained why your suggestion seemed impractical yet funny to me. Just saying “look properly” seemed like it was meant to be an insult, which was my issue. Like I said, just a misunderstanding so trying to assign blame is kind of pointless eh.
---
They don’t get...
---
My cat's not blind, she's just old. As such, very fragile. Makes it all the scarier if you ask me.
---
No dude, it's too late. Trying for more insults when you were already the dude with glasses calling someone else "four-eyes" just doesn't work.
---
Yes, you can. They didn’t say you couldn’t. What’s your point?
---
Just tried Scratched Mirror Myers for the first time and my god is that the most fun I've had in a video game in awhile.
---
I have never quit one game of DbD as either killer or survivor. I don't understand why you would rage over a game of hide and seek. Like dude if the game is bad it's over in 5 mins anyway chill. 
---
Yep. I watch a lot of streamers (actually way more than I play the damn game which is pretty funny) some of which play SWF squads. It’s comical seeing post game chat with a salty killer whining about toxic SWF when they played horribly.
---
This is a good one actually, read the whole thing
---
This was me in siege
---
*laughs* heh *YEP!*
---
Can you read flairs?
---
I don’t see what this is relevant to but yes, I do.
---
I see you're a Jake as well, Howdy Partner
---
No you can't. NOED activates if you are losing. Adrenaline activates if you are winning. Win-more items in games are generally not good. Comeback items are generally good.
---
I just thought that you'd been playing long enough to know that t-bagging serves no purpose other than to give assholes the opportunity to be assholes. That's how it's always been and that's how it will always be.
---
Imagine being so stupid you think I was mad there. Oh, wait, you don't have to imagine. I don't give shit if people play together. Play with your friends all you want. Just don't ask me to be impressed you can do shit while you have literal game breaking advantages.
---
This has been fun.
---
You accuse me of creating a safe space and telling me to go away so that you can...enjoy a safe space away from people like me.
---
When that doesn't work you change gears and accuse me of deflecting...despite the fact that you were the one to just ignore what was already said.
---
Now you're saying I'm practiced at my shtick. I assume the above is your shtick and you're just upset that I don't fall for your low effort attempts, because the projection is fierce with you.
---
I like how we can replace the killers place with new and everyone is just like “haha” 
---
You better apply this same logic to tunneling the first survivor to get them out of the game
---
Holy shit, is that you Tapp main number 4? I can’t believe I ran into one of 7 Tapp mains across all platforms.
---
PC. Was playing Freddy and I had my power out when someone dropped a pallet on my head. I was shunted out of the pallet, but I didn't enter the stun animation, and could turn and walk and such. I had accidentally tapped m2, and I think I was in the putting my hand away animation, so that could be something to do to it.
---
He didnt go to any gens and focused all of his time on one person. If you cant catch them move on. What else were the people supposed to do during this time he was chasing her through the middle of the for 3 mins? What else do you want the survivors to be doing?
---
Maybe if you cant catch someome move on
---
No one is complaining that survivors are doing their only objective. But it's just a fact that it's way too easy to get gens done really quickly. And the chase before the first hook was not that long.
---
The closest I ever came to was a Kate that was working with the killer to find, hook, and farm all the other survivors to death, and a Dwight that would constantly Teabag around me and always sandbagged me every second he got, whether the killer was around or not ☠️
---
But that video was just a whole new level. I couldn't imagine the anger. She would've recieved a very strongly worded message from me 🔪
---
It is I my son. Maybe someday you too can join the inner circle.
---
But he did catch her. You all are acting like he spent a decade on the first chase, but it wasn't that long of a chase at all
---
Mmmmmm tasty
---
In certain situations bullying the killer helps your team escape. It’s no different than camping, and honestly isn’t as bad because you can ignore teabagging, you can’t ignore being face camped 
---
Will never understand why peoples feelings get so hurt by repedative croutching. Just chase them out n move on. Its a game. Have fun. Quit taking it so seriously 
---
And if anyone's wondering why I would decide to torture myself by playing Nurse, it's because I got a PS4 Pro a couple weeks ago and the game's FPS *was* a lot better for a bit and it's back to shit now for some reason
---
/r/rpdrcringe 
---
I think DS is fine, and I don't think hatch needs any change other than the key. I get that the 4 person escape via hatch is an achievement, but it's broken. You just get a 4 person SWF that uses comms to get everyone to the right place ez. One key should just not equal multiple escapes, period 
---
Outstanding
---
I made it with 3ds max and ue4
---
Saggy Haggy is great fun. She's rewards high skill play as well (or low skill from survivors) so it feels good when you really outplay someone, or completely plan for how they will behave and lure them to where you want them.
---
She still has some pretty big issues though. High skill players know how to mess with her, and pop traps when she can't teleport (like carrying someone) so getting into better rank games with her can be a bit miserable. She also takes time to set up and if you do lose traps rapidly, it can stall your momentum in the game and force you to change up your strategies on the fly.
---
Personally my least favourite part of her is her add ons. It's really difficult to get at all excited about her very/ultra rares when they show up. Most come with too significant downsides to be fun outside of really low rank (ie, no teleporting, which greatly limits your control of the map and often corners you to proxy camp more as you have to keep setting up as you go, but still need to be near to your traps to profit off them.) or are low impact like the Granma's Heart/Disfigured Ear, or are simply broken right now like Rusty Shackles, which, prior to breaking was possibly her strongest and most fun add on. Now it's just a waste of a slot.
---
Yes, really.  Adren rarely pops at a time where it matters.  Usually, it just pops and heals you a health state, or just puts your "Exhaustion" perk on CD for a sprintburst that is terribly timed.  Out of 100 games, if you ran Adren in every single one of them, it may be legit useful like 5-10 times.  Too many games end pre-all gens getting done (Instantly makes adren do nothing), or you get killed before the final gen because you get tunneled/poor gen work by your team (Again, nothing from Adren), plenty of games will have you at full health if you DO get those gens done (Adren does very little if anything), and even if it pops in an endgame chase, it may do nothing depending on conditions of that chase.  If it pops while the killer swings a 1H down, you just go down.  If it pops while the killer is picking you up, nothing really happens other than that you get a full heal off of the hook if you get saved.  If.  If the killer is running NOED, you probably won't get saved, nor would that health state matter anyway.
---
Adrenaline is more of a SWF perk than anything.  The way it plays out is that when playing SWFs, and you know the person with Adren is about to be downed or such, you can hold the gen at 99% and wait for it to be useful.  You can work together to make Adren powerful.
---
“ARRGH THATS BULLSHIT!”
---
“maybe just one more match tho”
---
I know the feeling...my game froze 3 times today grabbing people out of lockers with the hag. They did that quick enter and exit and when I tried to grab them I got stuck in the grab animation. I could only spin in circles and got teabagged all around me
---
Just use the green addons
---
I have been having this issue for a while now. Playing killers like the Doctor and the Wraith is literally impossible unless you have ruin the entire match which I dont even having the perks on them right now. The fact that I have to play Hillbilly or Spirit just to pip is ridiculous
---
That was fast
---
See, you're making the exact same type of argument here that I'm complaining about in my post, wanting double blind lobbies because you think lobby mechanics should be roughly equivalent. Look at who is favored on the whole, not in this one specific way.
---
I already had about half of it done but i wanted to do wraith more
---
I mean Adren is a win more perk for survivors that is only extremely conditional on it proccing and having an impact, and won't even proc if you lose too early.
---
NOED is an catch-up perk that scales well regardless of how you are doing, so long as you can capitalize on it in time.  In the games where it doesn't proc, it is usually because you already won before then.  The situations where Adren doesn't proc is because you already lost before it could proc.
---
I necer said they weren't. But they really aren't THAT bad. Not having dedicated servers is the main issue though.
---
At high ranks Ruin is absolutely necessary, and even then you still have to be lucky. And I hate having to run meta perks
---
Are you gonna reply to anarchy's arguments or nah?
---
Its 2 gens because survivors will make a desperation play to at least get to that second gen so that the hatch is a remote chance of an out.
---
That's not the point, her green add ons make her stronger which is good, but a lot of the fun of add ons is the dynamic gameplay they bring and the way they change up how a game plays out. 90% of Hag's best add ons just bump up a duration or a range a little bit, it's nowhere near as interesting as someone like Myers who it a complete wild card going into a match or Spirit who can be so many different brands of terrifying.
---
Rusty shackles at least used to be that, survivors would shit themselves as you land hits on them, never knowing when you're coming at them. Now they still hear a heartbeat when a trap goes off so they still run and it's just like playing the default power except you don't see yourself.
---
Can’t play the video
---
I sometimes see them doing it at the gate even when the killer isn’t even looking in their direction so what’s the point if they can’t see them
---
I think he means intentionally fucking over your teammates i.e. leading the killer to where you are, unhooking front of killer, etc
---
How long would you say the average chase where a killer wins lasts at red ranks?
---
&gt;Just do all the gens 4Head
---
Why would I not want perks that help me get longer chases or help me do gens? That's how I win the game. Why would I want a dead perk for the majority of the game?
---
If all gens get done the Survivors already won. Adrenaline does not help that outside of very niche scenarios. The most reasonable case is that the person getting chased at the end gets healed and speed boosted. There is *no* guarantee that they get out because of it. You can get the same results by using Borrowed Time after that person gets hooked.
---
It's like if there was a perk for Killer that super buffed all stats by an insane degree but only proc'd once you killed 3 Survivors. There's no point. You already did your objective.
---
Just because a perk does something good does NOT mean it's a good perk if the condition to meet it is either hard or you've already won by the time you've completed it. (In this case, the condition is to literally win the game).
---
I have a comment downvoted into the negatives just for asking the parent commenter if they were going to reply to someone's arguments. This subreddit is worthless. 
---
Yea.  It really sucks as the person on the receiving end, but it's better to do it so that at least your team has the extra 30-50 seconds you provide in wasted killer time at the absolute least.
---
That extra 30-50 seconds is worth up to a gen's progress of time easily.  A single gen can be the difference between a 4k, a 3k and hatch escape, or even a full escape for everyone else (3 people working on a gen and you waste that time).
---
is it me or legion exploits have been rampant lately? For the past couple of days, when I play survivor, 95% of the time it is Legion and they all use the moonwalk exploit where there is not counter play. Pretty infuriating.
---
Faulty Left Bumper? Ive never had it he so laggy that skill checks don't register. And I've had some laggy matches. One was so bad, when I'd get hook, the screen stayed red from the blood spatter. The rest of the colors couldn't catch up, but skill checks have always been smooth.
---
"AFK".
---
So far, for me it's been Huntress and Trapper, but that's *very rare* to happen.
---
Episode 5 due out in February! I love those videos!
---
Why would he have to argue? If I say « I like to punch disabled kid », you dont need to argue that this is bad. 
---
Nope, pc
---
Lack of map pressure and chases being wasted cause this. I see a lot of new killers dedicate to chases that are bad for them and then call genrush an issue when it occurs
---
As a killer, you need map knowledge as much as possible and have to benefit in any way you can.
---
Break chases, kick nearby gens, hit fresh targets, force healing, tunnel hooks, play deadzones. Killers need to know the map they play on, where survivors most likely are and have to capitalise off it asap.

Actually, pretty sure sandbagging is fucking them over at all, accidental or intentional, like the pallet drop that forces them to pretty much always take a hit
---
I can’t remember the last time I actually saw somebody use a cypress.

There's been an inordinate amount of DCs due to the infinite loading screens, so I don't blame people when they call it at that point, this patch has been one of the worst in memory.

---
Ignore me if you want, but the advice I have was solid, just because it was broad doesn't mean it's not useful for you, him or others who are reading and need the guidance
---
Prove Thyself will only make it so that the 10% gen speed decrease when there is more than one survivor on a gen at a time, which should have always been there but it wasn't working, is negated. Ergo, gens won't get done any faster than they will naturally right now, and plus there's only one Prove Thyself effect at a time. 
---
Ahh, the fanboys trying to defend Spirit. zOmg cutie pie kawaii Thicc spirit girl UWU!!! so adorable! how could you possibly dislike her?!1 and shes a good killer too! what about lE eBin mindgames!1!1
---
shes not fun to play against at all. her 'passive phasing' is bullshit and I DC against her every match.
---
Window loops are still best vs legions. Most of them swing and miss a lot if you juke even in low ranks during frenzy. Loop around a pallet without dropping it until his frenzy is done. It’s all you can do, if he wants you he will get you but you can delay him. 
---
That's a good idea, complete a secondary objective (gathering the gas can) and then completing the primary objective (completing the gen). With the existence of holding down m1 existing for this long there is definitely room for a new way to implement the objective to take longer and be less boring.
---
Prove Thyself is most definitely going through. There's just some problems they have to iron out first with it, like the fact that when 2+ people are on a gen, it's supposed to be 10% slower per person.
---
Also, it affects Toolbox repair too when it's not supposed to. It makes gens with the engineer's toolboxes INSANELY fast. Not supposed to work like that.
---
So what’s the answer. I don’t think it’s as simple as slowing gen speed down. First off, you have idiot campers all throughout this game. So we slow down repair speed, and benefit the camper? Nope. I could maybe get onboard with something that slowed down gens a little, but repair speed increases if the killer is within a pretty large camp range of the hook, but not sure how it would exactly work. There’s also the issue with Nurse (PC) and Billy. Slow down gens and these killers are going to crush everyone, if there’s ruin especially it’s game over.  So now we’re talking killer nerfs also. It’s a balancing act that I’m not exactly confident they could pull off. All in all, I think it is pretty well balanced overall and should be left alone. Games like this might happen, but there’s also plenty that are the total opposite where survivors are getting hooked left and right with 4 gens still left.
---
What...what do you play?
---
That surprise is awesome! I'm sorry, I don't really care that much for these skins though...
---
GG has never been more than sneering and mockery. Change my mind (I never ever say it)
---
This is why SWF is bad.
---
As long as you’re not taking out your anger on others in an inappropriate manner, then being pissed is absolutely OK. 
---
The game itself is a blast. I mean, licensed Horror Killers? Intense gameplay? This is the only game I will death-grip my mouse while a P3 Nurse with NOED starts warping at me opening a gate. I love the rush of adrenaline you get while playing.
---
The only thing I can’t stand are the tilted/salty/toxic Survivors and Killers. Teabagging, Facecamping, SurviveWithFriends using cheese-Perks, ugh. 
---
Survivors have literally no reason to fear the Killer once you have the basic skills and gameplay-based thinking in order, and that’s a problem. So you end up with 3-4 person groups who play solely to bully/harass/annoy the Killer. 
---
Megs aren‘t usually toxic, they are just really bad at the game
---
I'm right here you know &gt;:(
---
Lol I’m a nea and I’m toxic as hell
---
&gt; At high ranks Ruin is absolutely necessary
---
It's not. A lot of red ranks players do just fine without it playing non top-tier killers.
---
Repairing generators, how about yourself?
---
Ah now I see
---
Just PS4? I like to play hillbilly and huntress. Sure it can slightly agitate me when someone runs in a circle for hours but then I can just face camp them cause they deserve it, so it’s basically a lose-lose but at least I got back at them. 
---
Sometimes you lose and get outplayed. This doesnt occur every game. Usually in games you have people looting chests and doing totems but if they aren't and focus then this has the chance of happening. He wasnt able to get anyone down to distract into altruism so the decisions that were made lead to him getting beaten. Which it's a game where you have the chance getting out played. It's not like they were running bnps and had gens done in like 10 seconds.
---
Meg main big brain super duper never before seen ultra iridescent F
---

---
&gt; Currently high level players just can’t play or experiment with some killers because they just aren’t viable and they cant learn new killers without dropping ranks.
---
Except their ego there's nothing stopping them from learning new killer at higher ranks. I'd say you'll learn faster playing versus better survivors.
---
Always something from you. Sorry it is a Friday night and I was busy doing something. This isnt my number one priority like it is for you.

Depends on what you mean by toxic

---
You can't use the word "every" and be serious with your question.
---
Wtf?
---
What needs to be explained?
---
Happened to me with Myers, I stalked and it let me out, so if it happens again try the secondary action and it might fix it
---
The bad players will tell you he has no counter, but goods ones will realize that you can take advantage of their decreased fov and inability to see scratch marks to perform some cool jukes that other killers wouldn't be susceptible to. Running through pallets that they respect because they can just vault over it or timing the drop for the stun is a pretty good way to shut them down because it will drain most/all of their frenzy. Running away in a straight line from the pallet that the legion just vaulted is the dumbest thing to do when fighting them, giving them the ability to see you while they are vaulting lets them stick to you and get a hit off. Forcing them to spend that small amount of time looking for you after they vault will chip away at their timer a lot. 
---
The legion takes a lot more traditional skill to escape in a chase, so its taken a while for players to learn what messes them up in a chase. The most important thing to do is learn how mind game pallets/windows that they just vaulted by getting out of their fov. If you can waste enough of their frenzy timer you can usually force a fatigue stun and have some time to get to a safer/more loopable spot while they wait to recharge their power and try again. 
---
(Unless the legion is moon walking your timer until you die, which has no counter play, is scummy af, and is something the devs need to fix asap.)
---
Äh...its a 9000 Lag spike out of nowhere, so i think the toaster he plays on just ejected the loafy breed ! 
---
Non-toxic Neas unite! 
---
Where does this quote come from? I see it everywhere, on this subreddit!
---
More like this is what "Tunneling" means 
---
That dude had a family, man. 
---
The hatch couldn’t spawn in yet, so there’s no way that person could’ve escaped through the hatch 
---
Not true. The number of gens that need to be completed for the hatch to spawn depends on how many survivors are alive. If all 4 survivors are alive, the hatch will not spawn unless all 5 generators are completed. This number goes down by 1 for each survivor killed. 
---
PC. Occasionally when grabbing a survivor out of a trap as trapper, the audio of the trap snapping shut will play and the survivor will stay in the trap and start levitating. This happens about 50% of the time and can happen multiple times in a row. The only way to reliably remove the survivor is to hit them, which will dislodge them from the trap and not reward points for grabbing a survivor out of a trap.
---
I suspect it has something to do with the angle you approach the trap from when grabbing. To reproduce, trap a survivor and try to grab them out of the trap from different angles. It seems especially common on stairs.
---
[Example at 13:30](https://youtu.be/td5Qsl-3zx0)
---
Tea bagging although killer isn't toxic, camping, etc, other bm
---
lmao you're actually right, don't listen to these other people, they're bad at killer and don't know what they're talking about. i cant fucking believe that after all these survivor nerfs that they are still complaining and blaming the game/survivors instead of themselves.
---
I guess not, I just had a friendly Nea. But I can't change the title, sorry
---
im not talking about them, im talking about spirit.
---
Wait.
---
You hooked them?
---
If that's the case then OF COURSE it's toxic.
---
Honestly no idea what you're saying but it's 75% if you take out me not 60%. 3/4 lol.. basic math
---
Dude they have to finish 2 out of 5 gens that makes 3 its in the game if all survivors die if they only did 1 and have 4 left the hatch won't spawn 
---
I'm suprised that there isn't a perk for finding the hatch. 
---
5/7, perfect match, would punch.
---
In one of my first games (survivor main) I genuinely thought the tbagging was some sort of happy dance my team mate started because I made it to the exit as well, so I joined in. After I learned what it meant I never did it again.
---
So you suddenly dropped to the ground without being touched by the killer?
---
I'd suggest Quentin, Jake or clown but do whoever you want I'll still like it
---
Oh pallet loopinig and tbagging at evey pallet is outsmarting, allright then :/
---
Memes need to make sense. What would he have  said?
---
I LOVE when low rank survivors start to teabag in the exit gates, but they don't get close enough to the exit, so a chainsaw teaches them how to behave in their next games.
---
OH  GOD 
---
OH FR*CK 
---
As you can read, i dont know math or basic gramma &gt;.&gt;
---
I don’t quite see why you’re assuming this is swf?
---
You don’t need to be coordinating in order for three gens to be finished in quick succession. Laurie went down at the shack which happened to be extremely close to a recently finished gen. Two people were working on that gen. 
---
If I was a solo queue survivor on that gen, I would have absolutely ran in to get that pallet stun. I’m not saying that this wasn’t an swf group, I’m just saying that’s it’s foolish to assume it is. 
---
"hello"
---
Do you have a recording of this? 
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Lagswitch can make this happen.
---
Connection between you and the killer is interrupted and he can hit you multiple times without you being able to move.
---
This seems as you got oneshot as the hits register at the same time once the connection comes back.
---
Because everyone is frozen the killer can do it to multiple survivors.
---
Usually tho if the lagswitch lasts so long you should be kicked out of the match.
---
Gg
---
Blood points can never be over saturated because all the resources they get are easily consumable. When something makes the rarity of certain items more common it ruins the desire for said items. 
---
Because 4 lulz
---
Please do
---
PC multiple bugs. All bugs were encountered when playing as survivor.
---
Disabling trapper traps doesn't produce the loud snapping shut noise.
---
Sometimes when someone is hit (not necessarily me) they don't run but are in their standing-still animation, gliding instead of running.
---
This happens to me once: Was playing against Legion, got hit and started mending. Then all generators were done, but my adrenaline perk that I had equipped did nothing for my healing, it only gave me a sprint burst (which I couldn't use of course since I was still mending). After I was done mending I was still injured and had to heal. Can't remember which character it was on cause I had to do a daily with a character I don't often play.
---
congrats! :)
---
What about the people who don't own Clown?
---
What?
---
Or Spirit/Nurse drop them from exit side, so they don't have enough space to run out. Lern 'em gud.
---
What about the risk/reward for killers of swinging too early and getting stunned. 
---
Still doesn't change the fact that, when the patch goes live, hooks will be further apart anf these loops will still exist.
---
PC on Steam. Game keeps crashing/loading forever, all instances have been while I was playing as killer, specifically the Legion
---
I can read English if you'd use it right.
---
Nurse is free with the game, why not just invest bp into her islnstead of wasting shards? 
---
gta sorta does it. so it is possible 
---
It’s not about a survivor being to good, it’s about where they are, if they are at a very powerful loop wasting time you need to move on and find them later, it’s not their skill it’s their location. 
---
it meant nothing before honestly. devs said the system counts it they throw all reports about it away 
---
Because I don’t feel like putting bp into a character I don’t play also I have ever kIller and I don’t care about cosmetics so I’d rather get it on the shrine

---
That’s the fucking worst. Like you have some hang time. Lemme bang out this gen for a bit and I ll be right over. 
---
You can't balance the game around a 3 minute initial chase while there are killers that can down you in a matter of seconds like Nurse, Huntress or Billy.
---
Also by having been quite a lot of time in rank 1 I can tell you that only 1 every 5~6 matches all people start doing gens right when they spawn.
---
And if there is ruin a lot will straight up ignore gens and search for the totem.
---
Well at least they’re trying to help, shit happens, you’ve probably done it before too.
---
If I do this, I try to stay at the gen and take the hit from the killer if they show up, to make up for it.
---
Did u 5 gen loop him?
---
So how nurse will get any kills? 
---
When the spirit is carrying ace away to the hook I like to think he gets a couple spanks in while he’s flailing

Everyone’s been having this problem.Happens way too often

Haha of course. Shit happens. I wasn’t meaning it as a I’m the best player and never fuck up post. Just some light humor. 
---
I wonder where she buys her clothes ? I would love to stick Micheal in that outfit. 
---
Looks like someone found a way to glitch out of the map. 
---
That’s just lag, on the killers screen you where probably still in the window. 
---
You probably wouldn't have done any better with no add ons or perks doctor
---
Usually they’re not. If I’m not being chased, I’m doing gens. Hate when kindred activates and two survivors are trying to unhook while I do the gens. 
---
Nothing wrong with being a child of a whore. We don't choose our parents so I do not see anything wrong with that :D

Run NOED, now survivor's only benefit is the sprint boost. 
---
As far as I know, there's no such thing as progress transfer.
---
I mean it’s glitched so your abusing a exploit 
---
Not in my experience unless they’re sweating 
---
Fellow Freddy my guy dunkno
---
Your problem devs give you perk you don't use it so cry more about loops because its better then usin perk that conter it
---
Does The Spirits new weapon have a new summoning animation ?
---
^(*Best headpiece for Nea @ your flair*)
---
Safe pallets are pallets, where it's nearly impossible to get an hit on the survivor without breaking the pallet first. The Shack pallet would be the best example. These pallets should be braked asap, because good survivors will stay at them, because you can't hit them.
---
Unsafe pallets are the exactly opposite. When the distance of objects around the pallet are smaller, you can hit the survivor 100% of the time with baiting and little mind gaming. These shoudnt be braked in a chase, because you can get a free hit if the surv stays on that pallet and if you break it, the surv can run to another pallet, which might be much safer. 
---
Then there are pallets in between where you get hits sometimes,when your mind gaming good or the survivor fucks up there vaults.
---
Look up OhTofu on YouTube, he made a informative pallet video about it 
---
There's no tunneling without hooking. You can't tunnel someone, if they've never been on a hook.
---
The only thing wrong with that clip is that you didn't keep the momentum after vaulting, hence why you got hit
---
Deerstalker on Freddy though
---
Well that’s what I usually do but last night it still took it off me after I escaped. 
---
Basically your only option is juke out of their fov and lose them. If they moonwalk just d/c bc at that point they’re just being an asshole and don’t deserve the points. 
---
&gt; It's a team game, not a solo one
---
Yeah....you do know that's kinda not true, right.
---
&gt;This is only true against late game builds with Remember Me. Otherwise a Killer defending 2 exit gates is nearly impossible.
---
You're assuming everyone is still alive.
---
&gt;Perhaps we are defining "winning" as different things. I define it as the majority of Survivors escaping. 2 Survivors escaping is debatable as a win. It looks like you're defining it as simply yourself escaping.
---
&gt;In that case, Adrenaline has only a chance of helping you. This is because you must have the condition of actively being in a chase or to be injured. And since you are saying winning is only if you escape then you should be running self-care. Adrenaline also works against deadhard in the event of noed. This means that you are running a dead perk for the entire game, then only have a chance of it helping you. Seems like a pretty mediocre perk to me. Not terrible, but definitely not a good perk
---
And now I'm going to ignore you because you have nothing worth listening to.
---
Lockers block auras. Legion heartbeat is not considered and aura I believe.
---
And there are tons of toxic killers too lmao, people act like only survivors or toxic when just as many killers are too, and killer toxcicity is far worse to deal with 
---
David: I don't hate him.. I don't even know him..
---
I never really thought about it like that. That’s so true. Kinda like David, especially No Mither /s
---
Just DC Vs on of the weakest killers in the game EZ
---
Yea
---
that is not my question
---
Hol up
---
I've heard a lot of people call it the cow loop rather than tree. Never heard of anyone calling it pig tho.
---
Yeah its fine
---
It was in shrine of secrets like a month ago but if u didn’t get it then that’s tuff. Bamboozle stops a lot of loops and is great against good players
---
Just think, someone took time and was paid to design the ass of an immortal killer tasked with hunting down innocent people. 
---
That’s just unlucky. 
---
Yeah I use most of it, escape with the item, by the next trial it’s on full use again.
---
Because I want to stay slugged on the ground for 4 minutes?No.You bet your ass if you slug ne to get the last guy then I dc.You do not care about me I do not care about you.
---
Haha funny
---
I’m fap as fucc boiii
---
Or when Noed Activates and you got BW
---
Well, I mean, the disconnecting person did lose all of their points and stuff in doing that right (I don't actually know, but I think killer's get all their points and a quitter bonus for it). I don't like disconnects but It kind of makes sense as a costly counterplay to hatch slugging... And the video literally ends with you and bill both in a stand-off so that's kind of seems like it led to the fairest thing ever...
---
Those people will bitch and complain no matter which killer you use don’t listen to their non sense 
---
You only know NOED is a thing when someone is actually hit, not before.
---
Regardless of how you feel its balanced it doesn't give you or anyone else the right to cheat. Besides as this clip clearly highlighted , this wasn't an act of pure dc'ing she did it on purpose to cheat for her swf bill friend , why do you think he ran into the middle of the map with no pallets right after I down'd her and she dc'd the moment he was over there?
---
Totally , guess I should have ddos'd all the survivors at the start of the match to win... Oh thats cheating and wrong? What do you mean?...
---
Yeah, man, good luck arguing that that was unsportsmanlike conduct, when you weren't the player that sacrificed to keep the game "sporting."
---
Nurse's calling is a meta? Like, it usually has to bee combined with M&amp;A or has to be used on Killers with low TR. Tbh I feel naked when I play Huntress without NC :D And I've just prestiged her and cannot find it in my BW &gt;.&lt;
---
I don't need to argue shit , I already gave the video to the devs , won't be surprised if those entitled twats get banned. Kinda hard to argue that you didn't do something when its on video...
---
Lol. You just said an ebony mori is balanced. That’s funny shit. 
---
Have you seen this threads comments? Apparently this subbreddit is overrun by them , thanks for being one of the few people to use logic when they comment.
---
It is not a waste of perk slot even if they don't complete all the gens. Remember that Rancor shows you locations of survivors and it's its main objective imo. Mori is just a little satisfying addition ;)   
---
Unless they cannot do even one gen but in that situation you probably don't need any perks xD
---
Please friend , quote me where exactly I said that? Ill wait...
---
Just play whatever feels good. Clearly isn't this one.
---
They deserve to get facecamped when they are better than you? LOL you´re funny. Looping takes actual skill, facecamping does not. Just get good
---
Well with your run on sentences, that’s exactly what it looks like. Either way, your statement here in response to it is admitting that ebony moris are not balanced whatsoever. From there we can infer that it truly does ruin the experience for all survivors that round. You got what you deserved with that DC. 
---
&gt; i cant play nurse without being called shit OP killer or noob for using more than 2 blinks
---
Play Nurse without add-ons, Ruin, NOED, Sloppy Butcher, don't camp or tunnel, and you will be appreciated for your skill.
---
Yeah pretty much. It's just weird because Nurse was like the 3rd killer I played after I got the Pro and it was smooth as hell, now it's nearly back to the way it was
---
nah.. i coudlnt replicate that effect so i did this :P
---
Are you forgetting about my girl Claudette ?
---
&gt;It takes a lot of muscle memory to learn for example omega blink
---
Allow me to disagree. When I tried them the first time, it took me literally 3-4 blinks to get used to them, i.e. less than one single match. It also didn't take me more than 1-2 blinks to then get used to the default blinks again in the next match. It doesn't take *that* much to be good with omegablinks, they are straight up too strong and have no downside or much of a learning curve once you learned default blinks. 
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone use an altered quote like that. Or not figure out that there was no reward for the person who disconnected, and not understand how sportsmanship works.
---
There are only 2 ways a killer can hold the game hostage , either they are keeping you in the basement for 40 minutes plus or they are trapping you in a corner. In any other situation the survivors have the opportunity to do gens and progress the match. Also dcing itself is a bannable offense , its just that they don't tend to ban people for their first offense because sometimes the game shits the bed and just quits working. Someone who does this for their swf friend probably quits allot anyways so yea , ill let the devs handle this.
---
SWF is terrible on console. When you do get in, the killer often quits right then and there. On the rare occurrence you make it into a game, you’ll often get tunneled and camped. Or the killer has terrible internet. 
---
*aneurysm chill, brah, it's a game, we'll get through this
---
It’s so bad, it never used to be like this.
---
That's why doctor exists, so you can be the meanie.
---
Yes you can
---
Here's the thing:
---
100% of Survivors have access to that loop. You can't have the one reliable counter to that loop be something not every Killer has access to.
---
It's like when people talk about the OP concussion grenades in Blackout and people come in with "jUsT rUN tRoPHy syStEm oR rEInFoRcEd!"
---
Strange, I've had DCs too during adept runs, but I'd still get the trophy
---
You are a genius ! Stay like this ;)
---
wait a moment ! HEY ! My Mother with a Legion mask would still be "The Clown" with a Legion Mask &gt;.&gt;
---
There was a reward:
---
Their friend gets to leave, without waiting for their mutual death, outchasing Freddy, or picking Feng back up.
---
Slugging for hatch can be sweaty, but it's not toxic. D/Cing like that is against the rules, though.
---
Thats odd. I killed 3 and the very last guy was in the screaming animation and he dcd, im not sure why it didnt count
---
Not just SWF, I wanted to play solo yesterday, but it took forever to get into a game, so I just played killer. I would get a full lobby instantly.
---
The downvotes here just states that only positive remarks and half-truth are allowed on this thread.
---
No, I don't. The only real power Freddy has to interact with is his aura-reading. It shouldn't be trumped by a perk or a locker.
---
Actually it seems like logic dictates that both sides are right for playing the waiting game as this is how this shitty mechanic is designed.
---
It just comes down to who cares more, i dont give a fuck and just hit people.
---
Not everyone owns Clown. So they *can't* use Bamboozle, unless it *happens* to appear on the Shrine again. Meanwhile, every Survivor can use these loops.
---
Yeah, man, *That Escalated Quickly Will Ferrell* plus a *yikes, dogg* on that. Ya'll gots to stop insulting each other, it's just a game, and he REALLY shouldn't talk about knocking out teeth to any one pretty much ever, everything's fine, the match ended, the videos been sent to the devs, the only one still stuck on that map is the guy still angry about it, and that's not how it should be. I hate it when killers do stuff I don't agree with and when a bunch of SWFs decide to "meme me" but everybody gotta relax about it, you get points, you complain about it, maybe something happens, maybe it doesn't, we can all be nice-ish here. We think it was ok, they think it isn't, hopefully one day they'll play survivor and have that happen to them and they'll be like, oh, this sucks, I get it.
---
No, i know what it is. I was just wondering how it was bullshit.
---
people asleep are literally in another Realm according to lore. aura reading blocking perks shouldn't work. 
---
I'd be okay with it but when I learned Legion can see and hear heartbeat in lockers.... and also doesn't need to stop Frenzy to check those not giving a chance to escape them... that's, you know...
---
Can’t blame him the gens are done why would he leave 
---
Yeah it is I mean I don't use ruin if you want something else meta
---
Ps4 hillbilly 10fps starterpack
---
i just walked along her lunging at gens so she would understand where they were, she did all the gens for bloodpoints and we ran across the whole map throwing all pallets down so i could get those bloodpoints. i just felt bad for the poor kate
---
i thought i'd get like 5 upvotes lol im just tryna show all killers arent jerks and dont have to be jerks🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It was a shitty thing for them to do, that being said, there’s no way in hell Feng will get banned. 
---
They’ll just consider it a normal DC (which they said “don’t report” btw). DCs are handled by an automated system if the person DCs above a certain threshold. 
---
Removed - Uncivil
---
This isn't usually how that works, they're usually smart enough to wait until their friend is on the hatch to D/C.
---
All said and done, you've said on this post that you think it's the only way for them to play at that point. You know, to forcibly disconnect from the in-progress match, changing the course of the end from a no-win into that shit.
---
 I'm not here to convince you, I'm here to add my support to the point that your view on this is ridiculous.
---
I’ll try that out. I seem to be having trouble finding survivors, so whispers will defiantly help 
---
yeah. There are too many counters for bbq &amp;chilli, was there really a need to ALSO count lockers? 
---
They have lol. She can now go up and down. That change happened with pig update. 
---
Ok that has nothing to do with what I said but yes finding it while being chased would create one if there isnt time to safely jump.
---
You can also end the chase by faking out the survivor once or twice (eg cutting line of sight briefly in atypical spots on avg ranks) then veering off to punch some generators, keeping everyone on their toes and inefficient. (Results may vary with SWF and survivor experience level, obviously, that's also what makes this a game)
---
Kinda false actually. I regularly see streamers do call outs. Ive had them converse on my location, my totem spawns, my perks once one died, my add ons. Its not as uncommon for Swf to be an organized "Seal Team" as youd like to believe.
---
And yes. Its wrong to have a streamers stream up as youre facing them, but I really only do it to listen to their salty tears as I annoy the shit out of them with Legion. Downvote if you want ;)
---
Yeah, I'm sorry, you are indeed NOT convincing me because your argument is unconvincing, and I'm not confused about what side of this argument you're on but thanks for clarifying your obvious position. As you said yourself, this went from a "no-win into that shit." Do you understand that the no-win part *IS* SHIT?
---
Also, spreading the stabby-love usually means more BP for those that care more about that side of things.
---
You said you had 4 Games straight with this. So i assume 4 different hosts
---
Honestly fuck that one totem I can never find
---
Lmao instant karma. Stop trying to hold someone hostage in the round for 5 damn minutes. We have better shit to do than crawl around so you can pat your ego with your pointless 4K. 
---
What?! No way can she squeeze into that santa costume! We just tried last night, with lube and everything! :P
---
Nop, aint working.
---
Yep the legion 
---
True story 
---
I’ve already explicitly explained game balance to you. If you don’t understand it by now, nothing I can do about that. I’m sticking to double blind being a good idea. 
---
But you weren't propably a newbie with nurse at the time? I'm not discussing balance here though, we all know nurse is stupid strong and i doubt she can ever be balanced.
---
You know, questioning my credibility doesn't actually address why you think using an exploit with a set punishment to protest a Dev supported mechanic is a reasonable move. It just makes you sound sweaty.
---
\^the wisdom have been spoken. and this is why I don't get all the hate for Legion. 
---
If we try to generalise, every killer works in such a way that when they find someone, they succeed if they finish the chase hooking the surv. And that is exactly the reason why ppl hate Legion (but not other killers?) - "when he finds me I end up on hook". 
---
The only difference is, as you say, the techniques you should use mid-chase, which are different than for other killers, and for me as surv it was fun to find out those techniques after they released the chapter. 
---
If you fail to lose him early or be a juke god, you probably get the hook, no matter which method he uses to follow you, but this sentence works for all killers. I think the thing that enrages most people is that they can't easily do the mindless, traditional jump-from-one-safe-loop-spot-to-another to kite him for 5 gens straight? I dunno. 
---
I play both the Legion and as surv against him, and unless I get unreasonable hard-tunnel right of the hook or moonwalk, I never thought there is no counterplay/the playstyle is boring for both sides as some ppl say.
---
I think Monitor and Abuse + Whispers is a pretty strong combo on the Pig, or at least Whispers in general.  It saves you soo much time to know when to crouch or when not to, since if you try crouching everywhere then all the gens will get done very fast from not applying any pressure.  For quite awhile I ran those two plus BBQ and Ruin, but Whispers can also be strong when combined with Nurse's Calling, to make sure they don't hear a heartbeat and start running away again letting you get very easy downs.
---
Eventually you get better at keeping tabs on roughly where all 4 survivors will be on the map at all times/what they're doing and Whispers is not absolutely necessary so I've lately been running Sloppy Butcher in place of it to have BBQ / Ruin / Sloppy Butcher / Nurses.  
---
It's also worth noting that if you're going to be using add-ons other than Combat Straps + Video Tape/John's Medical File, then perks like Enduring/Spirit Fury go up in value since it's much more difficult to use the ambush effectively at loops.  It should be more do-able without those add-ons once this mid-chapter patch hits though.
---
Overall she's a very versatile killer with lots of good builds and directions you can take her.  I would highly recommend Whispers though as it can save you an insane amount of time throughout the course of the match as long as you keep an eye on if it's lit up or not(I find the audio cues are not always as reliable as just seeing if it's lit up or not).
---
"good play" woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow I play killer and I don't need to slug to win. And he's circumventing the hook so they can't do that obviously. AND modern multiplayer games typically evolve with the meta, if this was a big enough issue we'd probably get a kill yourself button. Oh wait. I'm pretty sure I've seen other people use it already, it's called disconnecting, and if they do it enough it's apparently bannable but in this instance, seems pretty reasonable to me.
---
Dont be sad, she still can come down your chimney ! Like always XD
---
Rank 20 grind be like 
---
If a Legion with Frank and Dirt choses to tunnel you, well, your game is done. You can't outplay him whatsoever if he just cheeses the chases. Talk about getting good when you basically can't counter it... 
---
Weird flex, but ok 
---
Its a videogame people arent going to be scared after a few hours lol. If you want to talk gamebalance fine but please stop this lore bollocks
---
It simply isn't that good because you can't do much with the time it gains. At max rank you have one minute to essentially win the game after hooking someone it just isn't enough time to do anything good furthermore it takes time to travel to find survivors if you name isn't nurse or hillbilly.
---
But simply increasing the time is very hard to balance so I thought making it a hex that essentially has to be destroyed is better. No one complains about NOED as a hex except survivors. Killers mainly complain about Ruin, Devour Hope and third seal essentially doing nothing because they are destroyed a maximum of a minute into the game. 
---
I don’t even bother taking ruin anymore it gets popped way too fast against any survivor who’s not a potato 
---
Or just learn how to play? Doc is a medium tier killer at best.
---
grrr hatch is such a dumb mechanic why dont i 4k every game   !!! !?(!?) &gt;:( angery
---
Nah, it's able to manifest things. There's is a clown-monster being sent over, and it has a special message just for you! 
---
(I know that would require a comma, but I'm a rebel like that.)
---
𝐿 𝒪 𝒮 𝒮 ?
---
i did for a while and i fucking craved it more than cigarettes with a good glass of wine. fuck my life is unhealthy.
---
I only use it on Trapper and Hag, because I need that extra time to place the traps down. But, yes, you're right: it gets taken down way too fast.
---
Indeed. The current system feels very fair as a killer. It takes some practice but after some time, you'll get the timing right and it feels very consistent, I would be sad if they changed it
---
Appreciated? You've come to the wrong game, Killer. 
---
99% isn't the BIGGEST problem although you are right there is a problem with it. You still have options as a killer to activate blood warden lets say in your example you can just proximity camp the survivor and when someone saves you can then down them and guarantee the blood warden activation.
---
The bigger problem is that even when Blood warden activates it does nothing 99% of the time.
---
Same. I actually got the huntress one on PS4 few months back by having *everyone* DC (for reasons I have no idea about). 
---
When you prestige her it makes her butt look dirty.
---
BHVR is into some weird stuff
---
Yeah no.
---
I’d have left that Laurie after the first failed t-loop and find someone else instead.
---
In fact, he made so many mistakes here and got punished for it.
---
&gt; No one complains about NOED as a hex except survivors.
---
So, like 80% of players...
---
Are you sure you didn't mori anyone? Because those don't count towards adept for some reason.
---
I like the Legion, is that bad? From the multiple cosmetic choice changing their character, their backstory and their abilities in game have grown onto me.
---
crikey
---
Tends to happen.
---
Christ, you're incorrigible. Me too, so I guess I'm going to waste more of my time.
---
1) Slugging isn't being out of the match until everyone is, and nobody is getting up.
---
2) We're agreed on this, everyone should be, but this doesn't excuse pretending the disconnect option is a reasonable move.
---
3) It's a system menu. That's akin to saying that constantly save-scumming a game to undo mistakes is the same as beating it normally. Actually, I'm less annoyed by that, because it doesn't affect anyone else.
---
4) A lack of immediate punishment =/= Intended and reasonable move.
---
Why be snide about it? Why cherry pick? Why salt mine? We've got some common ground, and it's just a game. There's literally nothing here but me saying 'it's not a feature, it's abuse of a quality of life feature.' Are you going to misrepresent me, or my points this time? Let's hear it.
---
Context: I played against this guy for 3 games, first was with a 3-man SWF (which I also played against the game before this), second and third were with randoms.
---
The first game (3K, think I got him, not sure) I don't he was too salty but he threw a couple insults at me..
---
Second game he escaped, threw a lot more insults at me...
---
Third game, I camped him (sorry, it just felt too good)
---
During that game sometime after he died, he friended me on Steam and the rest is in the screenshots...
---
You could have said it depends on the day of the week
---
Attempting to lounge in Tier 3 would've put this aside, but this clip can go both ways. Sorry for the useless replies.
---
I've posted the context now, if you were wondering what happened before xd
---
I love everything about them besides the ability
---
I did that a couple of times before the video.
---
But I understand your scepticism.
---
It's a purple add on for Legion 
---
Lmao 
---
So basically you hate losing and you’re different, you’re weird. You’re not like the other gamers.  lmao 
---
Yes Officer, this one right here.
---
You don't. DBD is a game about chases.
---
One reason is because  crouching and playing scared is just boring. Imagine if every trial was silent, urban evasion Claudette. As killer it's boring because you have to go hunting behind rocks to find survivors. As survivor it's boring because you have to sit around and watch the killer check every nook and cranny until you can hold M1 on a generator again. The thrill of the game is in the chase.
---
You are correct that your success as a killer is a product of survivor's making mistakes. However, as you transform from a good killer to a great killer you'll start to realize that you can push survivors into making mistakes.  And that's much more interesting than the game punishing the survivor for successfully leading a long chase.
---
Very enlightening, basically what I was trying to say but with bigger words
---
Don’t really have a main, but I’ve been loving leveling up Hag so far.  Once you’ve established good trap coverage and are just everywhere at once scoring hits on the entire team it’s super fun.  Have definitely encountered that bit the another commenter mentioned, though, where skilled survivors will pop a ton of your traps while you’re carrying to hook.  Can slow you down a bit for sure.
---
Took me an hour, talking to him and stiching up these screenshots... (waiting for this guy to refresh my reddit page and find his post, then proceed to harass me about it..) and yes, he did send a picture of a topless woman he claims was underage, though he deleted it when I said I was going to report him (to Discord)
---
Wrong picture
---
Plenty of American people think everyone else is black.  Not just the Amish.
---
I can say with full confidence I've never had a killer game where I 4K and get told by survivors I'm really good or played it well.  It's always them being pissed.  Even when I type "GG" I'll get most times "no not a gg" and get rained by a bunch of excuses or how filthy my bloodline is.  
---
The hero we need on these kinds of posts
---
Firstly, Survivors should never have control over anything aside from how efficiently they perform their job at surviving, which requires all four of them to be competent at least at chases. 
---
Secondly, fear as a mechanic is interesting but not easy to implement when fear is not a factor in most games. Except with Hag, Wraith, and Myers with the right add-ons. Those can frighten most groups of Survivors because of how disruptive and unexpected they can be. 
---
Then, I don't know. I've never encountered this problem.
---
Why would survivors hate something that helps them win?
---
Tfw when adrenaline is a perk that can revive you.
---
He's tier 2 so his lunge should be normal 
---
Maybe you want to pick up blood warden because you like the idea of being stronger at the end game, maybe you pick it because you like its design, maybe your killer has an already strong mid game so you use your perk slots to improve the end game.
---
NOED and this perk don't activate till the end of the game and the dull totems aren't lit till the end of the game also that build is shit because if the survivors destroy all the totems before the end game you lose 2 perks. Also almost no survivors destroy all dull totems anyway.
---
Can we stop devolving the game down to survivor have shit perks so killer should also have shit perks? How about we complain that alot of the perks are shit and post recommend changes so some of them might be changed 
---
Blood Warden is just a wasted slot it does nothing for 100 games and then maybe 1 game it will do something I don't think that having a perk that is useless is good game design. I just want the perk to furfill the job it was supposed to do.
---
"it's not a feature, it's a ... feature"
---
I like them to, but their lore isn't the best. You do you though mate
---
No.  It's the closest to Ghostface we'll likely get and a lot of people did want a killer that could quickly vault over pallets and windows.  
---
Personally, I think a lot of people parrot streamers about a lot of stuff in this game and Legion is the latest example of that.  
---
All good killer players slug. Knowing when to do so is an important skill. The situation in the post is the first and most obvious situation that calls for it.
---
What is so bad about it? NOED is a totem and people complain about it non stop.
---
helll yeahh lmao
---
Coloured person? Are we in the 1700s?  
---
It's losing more than you won by making the right play.
---
added. I'm yeah boi
---
I can see that every single time a survivor attempts to backtrack over a pallet that the Legion jumps over. 
---
Survivor?
---
Adrenaline shouldn't work on dying state, nor should it remove extra conditions such as Dream State/Deep Wounds.  
---
Change my mind.  
---
There's no effort in a hatch stand off. Killer just loses. The survivor has to be in another room to lose. There's a reason every killer just gets the hit and takes the loss.
---
Play what you the enjoy the most. If you play anything based on the opinion of others you have a problem my man.
---
Sure thing, mi'lord. I shall tell the town crier immediately!
---
She doesn't deserve this.
---
The 4 mixed in with all the fives?
---
PC. Just looking to expand my dbd circle since all my friends only play fortnite :-(
---
It's cute that you have no real point to make in this thread and just decided to be condescending instead.
---
Where can I find that?
---
A survivor main with 5k hours yesterday couldn't get off my screenshot commentary page
---
Got this achievement immediately after I started playing because of a crappy Doctor. Rank resets should be golden for this achievement, as most newer killers don't listen for sound.
---
NOED makes everyone onehitdown thats why people haye it cause it rewards bad killers with a free kill at the end. Bloodwarden is meh at best you shouldnt be able to destroy it
---
I still don’t think gen rushing is still a relevant term.  It made sense with the old new part insta repairs, but now it’s just describing survivors’ main objective as if it’s a tactic.
---
Not weighing in on the game’s balance, for the record, just the use of the term.
---
This guy and his spelling lmao. How does someone get so mad over a game?
---
What a loser
---
I can't speak for survivors in general because I am only 1 and how I fee doeant represent others. I dont like it because it's just so unfun for the poor survivor it's happening to. I feel bad when they are on hook just getting whacked. I personally dont understand why killers do it since we're can hear it acrossed the map and it tells us you are face camping and I'll just do gens and escape which is a very boring game. I like the chase. I dont wanna play generator simulator every match.
---
Mi'lord, forgive me for speaking out of turn, but perchance that's not... entirely true. I've heard some musings from those savages in the Southlands that a hatch standoff is both winnable and requires great effort and skill on the part of both combatants, the ultimate mind-game, they say, not me, I'd never disagree with you. You know I and the rest of the kingdom prefer it when we wound the gladiators and tie their hands but allow you to finish them off with a mighty blow to raucous cheers and applause, your grace!
---
There's a difference, yes. It requires opening the pause menu, and taking a penalty, is frowned upon, and all around not a character, perk, item, or interaction-based feature. Trivializing that doesn't make your point accurate, it just makes you impossible to talk with.
---
If it wasn't in the system menu, and somebody turned their shit off, would you still be saying this? They're both treated the same way as far as punishment, and I'd go so far as to say the only reason they require a confirmed D/C rate is because their net code keeps dropping clients.
---
If that person just rage quit without thought of aiding their supposed companion or lightning blew apart their computer at that moment would we still be talking about this?
---
Okay, yeah, clue me in.  Is this a known bug?  I had that same cooperative action for 180 seconds daily for a good four days before finally scrapping it, and it never counted a single second despite tons of team repairs and joint heals.
---
Oh well that’s me flaccid again. 
---
If a virgin has a first time he's no longer a virgin
---
oh, man, I'm super glad it's cute, cuz I was worried it might be a little crass, like having to argue the difference between being sporting and being a selfish baby for, like, 9 hours.
---
Jokes on you - even without SWF I'm still at rank 15!
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDD oh shit ur so rite I'am dumb LOL I forgt thats how NOED works thanks you 4 teling me! :333333
---
I’m still new so yeah getting good is something I still need to do, but I can see where you’re coming from. I’m not disagreeing that face camping is bad, but I’m also not afraid to admit that if a survivor annoys me I might do it. On the other hand, if it’s a good game I’ll let a survivor have hatch, it really just depends on how I’m feeling that game. If you really want me to “just get good” then tell me how instead of just berating me. If you don’t want to tho, that’s fine, and have a nice life.
---
t. Rank 20 who doesn't know what pressure is
---
what the fuck are those visuals? i dont want to be mean but what is that? the game looks like its being rendered in an absurdly low resolution, but the text is still relatively high-res.

---
Shit, man, you tell me. Very doubtful.
---
You're the one defending D/C for the hatch, and on this post you called it the only reasonable time to do so. I asked if it 'Disconnect' wasn't listed in the menu, would it still be fine with you that they did this.
---
 You're asking if it was an entirely different situation that occurred, or act of God, would we still be talking about it? That's apples and oranges.

So not being able to leave the game at the end of the game for 3 minutes isnt a strong ability?

Survivors: Barely have any actual game changing perks

---
God, yeah, I think teabagging is stupid regardless of context, but it’s even more bewildering when the survivor literally hasn’t done anything.  The majority of the time it’s like a survivor that just dropped a pallet before I even got to the loop and stops to teabag behind it.  Like, what?  You just used up a pallet for no reason and are gonna triumphantly taunt?
---
Don't nerf SWF. 
---
Just buff Solo survivors to match up to SWF (Or near to, never going to be perfect), and from there buff killer.
---
Give all survivors Kindred and Bond after they have been once hooked.

Guess that's what happens when you play the same guy three times

I feel personally insulted when a survivor tries to do the old "vault over a window, crouch, vault back over when the killer follows" trick. No respect.  
---
I don't have my GPU with me, so I'm using a low graphics config.
---
That never works on me, but I'm mentioning how the Legion used to fly over a pallet letting survivors have a huge window to hop back over. Now that it's patched, a ton of players still try to do it and just die.
---
The answer is yes, because of how Schroddinger's Law works, geez I practically handed that one to you, ugh, man, that wouldn't be an entirely different situation because we don't know the exact situation and all of the hypotheticals remain in play when we can't eliminate them. And I said book cuz you said book first. I'm trying to help you, buddy, AND milord, but I have to go to bed. Best of luck with everything, you and OP and everyone else. I want you all to be happy. I'm going to leave through the exit gates now, thank you all for your time.
---
&gt;admits to being a paedophile
---
Killer Chris Hansen!
---
Special ability: Seat Offer
---
So. . . you're the guy that keeps boosting Megs, the very same ones that D/C on a failed pallet juke?
---
 Or what? You taught them to use flashlights and press crouch? What kinda toxic are we at?
---
im sorry to be a pain in the ass but how is it op? ive never played against it or legion in general lmao but it just reminds me of the huntress’ iridescent head 
---
&gt; People that cleanse totems when there's no ruin or signs of devour hope
---
NOED.
---
Most fun and best are two very different things. Hilbilly and Nurse are the best, then it comes to preference. Some say Spirit, some say Hag or even Huntress. If you like Myers I think you'll enjoy the Pig. 
---
Doctor is very boring to me unless its a very specific build like Snipe Doc or Impossible Skillchecks. I really enjoy Hag but she's very different from the other killers but I main Myers right know. You may also enjoy Spirit but she's a bit difficult to master.
---
I'm fairly certain you still pip with that outcome. This subs mindset about winning and losing is the reason you all don't like the game. You pip, you win. Easy as that. If I get one pip and die, I did good, end of discussion. If I kill one guy and pip, I win. I get my points, and I rank up. Quit being salty about not getting the one perfect outcome. 
---
I LOVE doing this to people, but it only ever works on brick ruins (or roofed maps).
---
Are flicking me m8?
---
&gt; balance in the early game and how momentum is gained  
---
  
---
This, while not in regards to the original topic, is also really uhm ... wonky? While 3 gens are popping off, it's not like that that would be the end of the game right away.  
---
Most killers that do not resort to camping will extend the game for incredible amounts of time, because the map has become scarce of safe options by then. OR survivors simply take risks and ignore the sudden urge to farm someone off the hook and repair a gen and actually use the prolonged hook time to their advantage.  
---
The state of the mid to late game is so snowbally, I don't even know if it is something we'd want to have.  
---
The survivors are left with too little objectives to do (in order to waste their time -&gt; beneficial for killers) while also having so little means of actually safe options (pallet scarcity, meaningful tiles for mind games that could lead to ending chases, etc.; while there are "safe pallets", you can still never escape a chase). 
---
Window traps is a great idea!!
---
It only counts joint heals, which rarely happen and only last about 6 seconds
---
I like you. Literally automori survivors when we both are at the hatch, who cares. We killers need our 4th kill after getting 25k bloodpoints! I will hatch standoff until mom calls me to dinner, and then complain on reddit! 
---
There's tonnes of exploits that killers can use. This isn't really an exploit. An exploit is usually a broken game mechanic (wraith + sloppy). The Feng DC'd to both avoid a mori and save the Bill. If she hadn't DC'd, survivors would have called her selfish.
---
Woooosh
---
The idea the killer can camp to secure a kill annoys me to no end. If you're like me and play with a group of randoms, you rarely get a 4 man escape. Camping, from my POV, looks like the killer having a tantrum. Usually they tunnel down the player who's put in the most effort and make them suffer for it.
---
Oh, wow.  What a poorly-conceived daily.  I think literally every other one could reasonably be completed in a single match.
---
Lmao
---
Better than what my grandfather called them
---
That’s not toxic
---
I’ve been playing this game on and off and I encountered my first toxic survivors yesterday! 
---
Holy crap I hope they were joking by the end because I don't even think it's possible to have that much anger
---
You didn’t even lunge properly once and when you did you got pretty much 360d
---
I hate both nurse and legion, but legion takes the cake for me
---
This is basically my mentality as well.If I can help someone else win then it is a bonus.
---
I only started recording partway through the match, there were multiple times that this happened while something was beginning a vault.
---
Spirit/Hag are the best but I find them very boring. Imo Clown is very fun and a bit different from the other killers. He's not the best though.
---
Only with Blind Warrior, if you run addons like Windstorm/Swifthunt or Bone Clapper/Ghost you should be fine, but avoid bugging Sloppy with the Blind addon. The build I mentioned eliminates the common weakness due to lack of experience: maintaining a chase and tracking down survivors after a generator is done. This is an effective build even on higher ranks because you can easily tunnel down 1, and due to NOED you can secure your second kill relatively easy. Make sure you are emotionally ready though, because you'll get a lot of shit for running this build.
---
it is a strong ability, but the difference to noed is rn that you have to earn your ability..(chase and down someone) 
---
where noed just needs a simple 1 
---
If your into purple ok
---
Ok someone who dosnt understand the woosh -.-, and how to use it.
---
There is no woosh here and adding more woosh shows just more how less you actually understand about it -.-,
---
Idk there’s a lot  of times where hits should and shouldn’t have connected but this video just shows you don’t know how to hit properly lol
---
Spirit is a very good and fun to play. Hag is also one of the best imo but I don’t really like to play her
---
Lies, Liza Minelli, lies.  
---
When they win they're like "GG EZ BABY KILLER LMAO UNINSTALL", or if you so dare kill one of them they all come to defend the dead "KILL YOURSELF YOU TUNNEL CAMPING BITCH, NOOB KILLER ILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR SLEEP"
---
(yes these are actual messages I get from killing one single person)
---
What about if Manfred von Karma was the killer? Just casually tazes you with a super charged stun gun.
---
In game Jeff doesn't look like he goes to the gym tbh (coloured)
---
Yes. Your question was if he thought it was okay and he explained why it was so. Obviously completely unrelated 
---
It is when they know they are doing it purposefully  and tbaging
---
I downvoted this when it was only a few minutes old. I don't regret it you faggots
---
Yep
---
^ this guy t-bags at the exit gates
---
Survivor- auras of gens or hooked survivors appear as large black squares
---
Weird flex but ok.  
---
Memes aside, why the insult?
---
Can’t say if these should’ve hit or not because I will never understand hit boxes in this game but those survivors were so obnoxious and annoying at the end. 
---
Yeah, I wasn't sure whether to swing and chase them away or to let them waste their time.
---
Pig is right now, very heavily add on dependent.  You'll want Combat Straps, second add on can be Last Will for an extra trap to play with. 
---
You don't want to really use the crouch to ambush people, not when approaching a generator.  Use LOS and try to remain as hidden as possible, then stand up and try to get a gen grab.  If you don't get a gen grab you still get a hit in with your M1.  You want to use the Ambush on pallet mindgames mostly. 
---
Always try to save a trap for the endgame, maybe even two depending on how quickly the gens are being done.  Just remember the trap doesn't activate on hatch escapes.  
---
When you do trap people up, patrol the Jigsaw boxes and harass them if possible.  The traps are meant to delay but the RNG can really fuck you over.  That's just the Pig life. 
---
Other than that it's just good killer fundamentals and knowing that a lot of her add-ons suck.  The URs are never worth it.  
---
I edited it to the more PC version of the gay insult
---
Freddy will soon get a rework, give him a chance! 
---
As a survivor, my number one tip is always always ALWAYS maximize the amount of time spent on a generator. Literally sprint from one gen to the next if you can. Unless you're playing swf you have to be the one responsible for moving the game along. The more time spent in the game, the more likely you are to die.
---
Ugh, TOTS.  
---
If you're really passionate about having a killer's mask, go to a reputable custom mask maker or even a good cosplayer and pay them to make you one.  You'll get better quality and likeness, guaranteed. 
---
The only killer that I would want to carry me
---
I hate when this happens, which is basically every time I use hexes (or so it feels) 
---
I dont cleanse them unless they are really hidden. Makes it easier to find the noed totem.
---
If you own all the killers you can buy with shards then have at it hauss
---
Spirit is the second best killer bro. Billy gets looped just like all the other killers except nurse
---
“He seen the totem, he must die”
---
Yes. I know that. But the gen wasn't done yet when they got downed.
---
So uh the video won't play for me and I noticed it's a YouTube vid can someone plz link it to me directly to YouTube?
---
 Not really toxic, they are just using perks and items the devs designed for the game. 
---
Why even waste your time posting this? Just kill the window and restart the game 
---
You should have seen them. They never left the corner
---
Really, toxicity depends on the player. As the person you responded to said, it's not toxic. Perhaps you view it that way and that's fine, but really you should use it as a learning lesson. The people in the corner of the maps with no hooks in sight? Leave them alone. They're not helping....at all. Who cares if they're teabagging. Killers need to learn to have more discipline. As a survivor, I'll teabag just to ensure the killer keeps chasing me. A good killer won't care if I'm teabagging, and they'll leave if I've got a good loop. A bad killer will get triggered and tunnel. Which, as the survivor, that's what I want.
---
Don't get triggered by them. Again, learn from it. Once you see they're in a spot where they can't help anyone (like the corner of the map) leave them. They'll make their way back towards the gen and put themselves in a compromising position. Your focus as the killer should be the gens. That's what the survivors ultimately need to get out. If you're in a chase for more than 30 seconds, it's time to break that chase and go back to patrolling gens.  
---
The infinite load is caused by players DCing during load screen. Alt + Tabbing is another problem that can also cause this because it can cause problems with the way the operating system handles the CPU cycles 
---
Thanks for the reply ☺️ I’ll give a few tutorials a watch! Do you know of any settings that I could change on my router or anything ? Like open ports maybe or something? Would that help?
---
That has to be a 13 year old with his bad spelling. Acting like he is a hacker, lulz. 
---
You might as well give it a rest friend , I appreciate the help but as you can see half the people on this subreddit are a bunch of entitled idiots. They don't listen to reason , if you corner them they resort to ad hominem or state something completely idiotic. 
---
I hope they buff the Pig a little, I really like that Killer. :d
---
okay, I reread what I said there. should probably remove the part where I'm confused as of why this is a thing since it's not obvious that I'm not concerned about the actual locker buff mechanics but the fact that it affects literally different realm yet doesn't affect the heartbeat giving one killer a huge boost in power while nerfing the only thing Fred has as advantage. 
---
LMAO I t-bagged a Michael when I first started playing because I thought it was a friendly gesture. I got tunneled the whole game. (,: 
---
The next picture should be the lion ripping the monkey to shreds
---
He was trying to SWAT you.
---
To promote standing in gates?
---
Yeah, I can understand that but isn't it like for other games too? I am not sure. 
---
even with 3 gens not so good tbh. if two people bait one gen, two others baiting another, Doc stands no chance. he can't injure everyone within few seconds like Legion. 
---
How about more female killers such as Carrie White (carrie) or Sadako Yamamura (the ring) japanese version? It's almost a crime Harry Warden hasn't been included in dbd... or Norman Bates if you're feeling really retro. ;)
---
Careful people don't like hearing the actual reason he did it.
---
It is much more difficult, and you are more limited than with a mouse in terms of 180 hits.  Trying to track someone through corn can feel impossible, and occasionally some other maps can be problematic too.
---
That being said, I've had pretty good success with nurse on ps4, and her power is just so game-breakingly strong that even a less optimal version of it can still be extremely powerful.  If you're not deterred by some potentially heinously bad games, especially at first, then I think it's worth a shot.  Many console players haven't really ever played against good nurses and often make mistakes/get overly cocky.  There are some really amazing console nurses out there, they're just really rare.  I'm always stoked to find a good nurse as survivor, and send them kind words after the match regardless the outcome.
---
If you're just looking for the easiest 4ks then nurse isn't even worth trying to really learn, she does have a lot of challenges to overcome(framerate is a big one). But if you enjoy playing her, then don't let anyone say she's not viable even through rank 1 on console, because she absolutely can be. It can be frustrating at times so if it ends up not being enjoyable then don't even bother too much with her.  
---
Try her out, get comfortable-ish with her, then see if you think she's worth sticking with for awhile or not.  Leveling her up isn't even bad because nurse's calling is a great teachable to get.
---
Why do people treat Hugh Jackman as a celebrity or Taylor swift, It's because a large enough group of people have come to that conclusion, as have they in our community.
---
The animation would look way way WAYYYY too weird
---
Trying to imply streamers don't have a life when they make more money than most people by playing video games, is incredibly fucking asinine.
---
True, but what if it didnt look weird? What do you think of the concept?
---
Hey
---
Think about the (non moonwalking) legion fans
---
People like him make me really hope that a lot more funding will go into mental health institutions.
---
still aids. it still removes every aspect of skill from chases and you will still go down eventually.
---
I don't really know if that's needed, I've never been able to use the entire thing unless Franklin's was involved. Commodious if you want to do gens with it as well though, Alex's sucks for that. 
---
Killers don't have **skill** checks so this is not a valid option
---
It's way too complicated, and isn't the killer supposed to be waaay stronger (body build wise) then the survivor so he should be able to pull the survivor with an ease
---
So he cant kill anymore?
---
He is easy yes, he needs fixing yes, but outright removing him is wrong
---
Lmao not op? Ok. He can instadown with his ult abs 360 mass spam. Stop. 
---
I always do that lol, I almost always give the hatch to the last person but only if they weren't one of those SWF groups
---
Slugging to prevent the hatch spawning is practically taking the game hostage. The downed survivor can't do anything and the other one has to hide.
---
nope he needs to be deleted also are you in the legion legion discord sevrer i want to be unbanned please
---
Ok then maybe give the survivor 3 decisive skill checks or something and if they can hit all 3 they escape. I'm up for discussion. I don't think killers just 'closing' the hatch is a fair solution like a lot of other people bc that would often mean the survivor has 0 chance 
---
Get all, all killers are fun to play with different play style.
---
Alright then, I'll see what I can do, thanks a lot!
---
u/Skemooo
---
Its probably because of the christmas event wich increased the chances of geting addons and offering for really cheap so people got a ton of moris and ultra rares and for the connection Just try runing the game and discord nothing else also the game has vsync turned on in the game files so look on youtube for a guide to change that since vsync=input lag 
---
I'd rather farm than play against legion or doc.  And I'd rather roll around in nettles than farm.
---
It depends on your playstyle my man. They are very similar because of the stealth factor. The only difference is while Myers snowballs the stealth into a late full on massacre, the Pig slows down the game hunting the survivors one by one, no haste.
---
I’ll brb
---
Yeah, that totem spawn was good, but you should not have spawned right next to it.
---
Nice
---
I haven’t played it in 5 months and frankly I don’t miss it
---
I'm taling a shit right now so go figure
---
Me too, always have fun playing it.  I do love a good vaulting neck grab!  The odd frustrating moment but they usually have a funny glint to them.  Does make me laugh sometimes.  I usually have a bit of admiration for those really slippy little survivors!  When they tea bag, I'm like 'Yes, yes, I know!'  Although it doesn't get me mad I do feel quite disappointed when they all escape, wish I could have another game with the same people, just to sacrifice at least one of them XD
---
That doesn't affect my ability to run into obvious walls, but I appreciate your positivity.  
---
What else are you supposed to do? Run and get hit, or fake run and then vault to *maybe* get hit, or potentially hide with no scratches. All of hear tactics are easily purpled beyond rank 15 killers...one the reasons Legion is so beloved by this community.
---
pathetic
---
Omg camped again... 
---
She's calling her shot! She's the Great BamBoozle!
---
And neither did you I guess? Instead of going for people doing gens you decided to just stay and moan and bitch about 2 people doing nothing?
---
I'd have to be stealthy because I have the same problem, plus I'd be out of breath while running in such a short amount of time, I'd be screwed in a chase. Maybe I'll let you borrow my jacket if the map isn't too cold to help you stealth too. 
---
What is your perk setup? At rank 1 you are going against top tier survivors, at least this quick after rank reset.
---
If your playing pig try to improve your chasing and use your traps accordingly to slow down the game. However against good survivors you will lose a few gens early, its unavoidable, however you have to use the hooks and traps to apply pressure and get survivors to come off gens to help
---
Imagine going into the basement to unhook a friend, when Chris Hansen comes out behind the corner. Scarier than Leather face
---
Does every square have 4 sides?
---
Well it’s not on console yet so I’m gonna dc my heart away to not deal with unskillful killers like that :)))))
---
The hatch is fine as it is in my opinion, there’s no guarantee either party will find it and standoffs are only a thing because people bother to engage in them. As survivor I jump, as killer I hit, and if the other party gets it then oh well. 
---
I dont see how sabo is toxic, hooks come back and the slugged person isnt doing anything, just pressure them till the hooks come back. I wish i could go against this sounds like a fun game.
---
Let's talk. 
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
I never really complain about the matches except when they target you after the 4% kicks in but i am starting to realize that is my own fault, or when they camp me for no reason when there is 4 survivors in the match any less sure they want to make short work of this game
---
Spirit, Maybe Hag but spirit beats her imo
---
High tier killers are

Nurse&gt; Spirit&gt; Billy&gt; Hag&gt; Huntress

I never said I had 4 games with me being hit 40-50m away and the skill checks missing, I said I had 4 games with bad hosts 
---
nice quick game.
---
Then don't body block. Counter to barbeque= hide in a locker or run distortion. (I always run distortion so) You won't get hooked more if you don't draw attention to yourself. Resilience makes you repair gens faster so you can rush gens whilst others keep the killer busy. That's the whole point of it. 
---
Sorry if you don't like the game being more challenging but I'm not a tryhard so if I lose, I lose.
---
Stay dead you need to stop justifying this bc hardly anyone is on your side. THAT is holding the game hostage. If someone doesn’t want to sit on the ground while you feel entitled for a 4K they don’t have to!!!  No one owes you anything. Stop. Literally stop.... you got outplayed. If you consider this an L take the L in silence. 
---
That's actually funny, because I was wondering if you noticed, since there were two "mistakes".
---
The four and five are switched, btw.  Not just a four in with the fives.
---
So go to sleep human must be rested for all life
---
how do i delete my reddit account
---
I spend more time in school than I get sleep
---
Isn't the objective to win, though?
---
15 years old? 
---
Beautiful
---
Good catch, didn't notice they were switched.
---
Why have I never seen this picture for this game before? It fits almost to perfectly 
---
It really isn't. It's a favorite among SWF squads for a reason and that's because it's extremely powerful. Especially considering how quickly gens can get done. 
---
Sometimes when I am pissed, I decide to stand in the basement when the game starts and stay there the whole game till an unlucky soul comes on my property. 
---
Was running arround for about 8 min. until I saw this...never happend to me before. I thought there where no gens on the map at all. 
---
I like leather face
---
No
---
We should had the 4 man but the Nea at the end just gave up. I was like WTF all that time wasted.
---
Nope
---
If you aren't injured or in chase, adrenaline is just a short speed boost. NOED however is a indefinitely long speed boost and exposes survivors. While they share conditions to proc, NOED will always be useful for the killer to catch-up and adrenaline is purely situational.
---
She's getting a small buff in the upcoming 2.5 patch:
---
Adjusted the Combat Straps add-on in accordance to the crouch duration change, decreased value from 1 second to 0.3 seconds.
---
Changed the Terror Radius fade time for when crouching / uncrouching to fade in ~4 seconds, down from 6.6 seconds.
---
Decreased the base crouch and uncrouch duration from 2 seconds to 1.3 seconds.
---
Increased Terror Radius from 28 meters to 32 meters.
---
Plus one of her teachables is getting buffed:
---
-Surveillance: Increased repair hearing distance by 8 meters. Regressing generators will be highlighted by a white aura. Once regression stops, generators will be highlighted by a yellow aura for 8/12/16 seconds.
---
But you didnt have to cleanse my totem
---
Make it like it never happened and i wasted a perk
---
I dont even need the crutch
---
Cause Im killing all your friends 
---
and it feels so rough
---
Well, secondary cosmetics are a thing in the game, so maybe you have one of those in all black
---
It’s actually a good build if you know how to use it properly, the regression is insane

I don't know how "Who hurt you?" And "yikes" became soyboy catchphrases but it's really fucking autistic just the same. 
---
Earning BP for wiggling? Sure, but it'd have to be a fairly low amount.
---
If you don't have Ruin, you will need it. High rank games tend to be very quick.
---
1%=1bp no
---
1%=3bp?
---
You can chase them and i mean they have to be really lucky that you don't catch them then. most adrenaline use is they are wounded and then healthy one noed hit they're down. if you slug survs and they got up through it it is your own fault.
---
Please fix dead Harding onto rocks
---
But see he has to find the hatch first and close it and then he has to find the chest. If he wants to camp chest then just hop on gens. The reason camping hatch is so annoying is because he can pull you off if it and he knows that’s your only way of escaping and that leads to this bull shit standoff which should have never been a think to begin with. If closes hatch he will need to look for the Key chest while also managing gens. It’s not perfect I know but I think with the proper implementation it could be a good game mechanic. We want to give the killer multiple angles to cover instead just the one. 
---
Maybe with this idea they could also throw in a perk that if your the last survivor when you complete a gen the alert given to the killer is delayed by 3 seconds. 
---
Maybe when the hatch is closed the survivor gets an auditory warning so he knows to look for the key before the killer gets there.
---
Maybe instead of the standard screeching through the chest animation they make it an instant pick up like an item pick up or cut the time on half of a normal chest searching animation. 
---
Sounds about fair.
---
Yes this also a great idea ! 
---
at least you got undies my dude :/
---
That person insulted you in so many ways yet you still had the decency to cover up their name.  *Imagine being you*
---
Borrowed time in the description says that you have to be in the killers terror radius to activate. If he was cloaked he had no terror radius hence the perk not activating
---
Was there a heartbeat the moment you unhooked the other guy? Borrowed times only works when someone is unhooked inside the terror radius. Wrsith has an add-on that suppresses his terror radius for 6 seconds after uncloaking
---
Absolutely beautiful
---
Yo the New Halloween actually banged.

If you can came here just be a dick you can just leave now.

Meg Main
---
B I G B R A I N
---
I played him a couple of matches yesterday. I'm terrible with the chainsaw, but he's quite fast, so his M1 is pretty effective too. I never camp when playing him though, but BBQ and Chili is great for applying map pressure.
---
That’s pretty much what happened to me, I’m a clown main and it was really fun to just insta down a survivor with the chainsaw  or chainsaw a pallet. He’s  definitely fun to play. 
---
oh geez oh man!!!!
---
Nobody:  
---
Airpod Users: THEY DON'T FALL OUT
---
Don’t play nice!  No matter what you do as a killer you will be considered toxic, just do what you want. 
---
Wow.... this is first time I ever felt bad for Leatherface.
---
OC Freddy is actualy a good build, but you need to know how to use it, if done properly the amount of extra stall you get is insane.
---
Main thing is to not mindlessly tap every gen you see else survivors will break out too easily, you want to target gens over 50% (to force regression) or isolated gens which people won’t go to often (to let them regress safely)
---
You also need to be prepared to be very hit and run using the stall to slowly remove most palltes from the map whilst not over comiting to chases to quickly resleep and OC the gens again.
---
If you find people break out too often, hit gens less, you have full control over OC, and you can encourage survivors to seek out OC gens to break with anti skill check addons as breaking out normaly will take far longer than the short term benefit of OC skill checks 
---
He certainly didn't do a very good job making it believable.
---
Yeah my meg is p3. I only wanted the bloody shirt for Dwight.
---
Some people are different, 'special'...
---
Thanks man!
---
Oohhh...maybe that was it. I didnt pay enough attention to listen to the terror radius because I knew he was right there and had to get the unhook and gtfo quick. Thanks !
---
I fear the hitboxes
---
Save the Best for Last is also good on him because a chainsaw hit counts as only 1hit against the Obsession. 
---
there will be ;)
---
Fengs Mouth
---
But it happens so much, people complain the pig is weak. In reality she slows everything down so much that she doesntneed to tunnel or camp. I've been in mutiple matches where the pig puts hats on the same survivor's over and over, just following them around the map......
---
haha is that a good thing because you're into Edward Cullen-esque aesthetics or a bad thing because Edward Cullen is your manifestation of unattractive, unmanly &amp; unintimidating? 
---
"made with mematic" Bro real shitposters use MS paint what you's doing?
---
Yeah that's her gig to be honest
---
When you're a stranger.
---
Or at the very least better locks
---
I, too, despise this term. I was a killer main during the times that brand new parts finished gens instantly. That was gen rushing and now anytime someone says gen rushing I immediately respect their opinion less. Gen rushing now just means that the survivors played better than you and instead of realizing that people just try to find an excuse to justify why they lost.
---
 No we’re a very nice community, do you wanna join?  I’m currently running a DND game on there
---
I could.. I could also tell him that I could get him banned and see his reaction (not that I will, lol). Though if he harrases me any more, I probably will send a ticket. At this time I don't really care about him enough to, but we'll see.
---
Play Nurse without extra blinks and also don't use Ruin or NOED.
---
You're allowed to use a crosshair for huntress lol, even the best Huntress plays like ScottJund use one and so do I.
---
At least he has the decency to get your parent's consent before inseminating them.
---
I'm not one to judge other's but sir do you never ever get salty about anything in a video game? Of course I don't mean salty to the point where you cuss at people with racials slurs but just like saying one or two fuck yous in chat? Because I'm pretty sure a lot of people in this community be like "OH LMAO LOOK AT THIS SALTY ASSHOLE LMAO" but then they get salty themselves over T-bagging and stuff. Hypocrisy
---
My brother is a leather face main, you can tell him that leather face isn't that good and he well always disagree
---
Oddly enough I do the exact same thing but as Killer because whenever I get too tilted in Overwatch its because I have to rely on braindead teammates
---
I really don't lmao. Unless the killer was super toxic
---
I'd just run to the killer to die 
---
Legion is definitely one of the best killers in the game.
---
luckily we got our farm on
---
i once disconnected when it got cleansed 15 seconds into the game. Sorry. I was ultra mega salty.
---
What are SWF cheese perks? Asking for a friend. 3 friends actually. 
---
DM that invite mate.
---
Your guess is about 53 people too high
---
Sure thing
---
Just intersted in what people have to say in legions defense :)
---
Yeah? Awesome. I got all the level 1 versions for all perks, as best i could, before I leveled them to t3 . just so I had all to begin with. But now I have all at t3. No more for Dwight until the next survivor :D 
---
awww, that's the cutest meme on this template
---
The key is variable.
---
Results? 
---
Prestige is pretty useless so it doesn't really matter
---
Oh don't worry I'm the retarded brother in our family having not seen your user flair.
---
/redditsolutions
---
say that to my bloody clothing
---
depends but this is truth in most cases. survivors like to bitch even if you play as fair as possible. 
---
I get called tunneler for going after fully healed survivor who was unhooked 3 minutes ago, as if I intentionally found specifically him on the gen. 
---
I agree with you that spirit is greatly designed, the mindgames against her is so fun and intersting. On other hand she is really powerful and I understand people having a hard time to like her cause of her strenght. But if we compare her to legion and the concepts of those two killers, spirit would win everyday. 
---
It's a cake based on a horror game what did you expect? It's not gunna have a fkn unicorn on it. 
---
my mom works for special ed she said not to say that word can we plz say okkilleridiot instead plz?
---
A very specific situation but this happens often in my games. So what happens if you are chasing someone to the gate and NOED is active. You down the person you are chasing  right in front of a person opening the door. Then down the person who just finished the door and if anyone else tries to run out you can down them too. Do you believe that you are justified in having all of those kills simply because they're no longer allowed to do anything. That would make it unnecessary for the killer to do anything all game except camp one totem by a gate and once noed activates go kill everyone.
---
What you're concerned about is why blood warden was created. Run the perk if you are interested in a situation like that. Rarely anyone runs it so when it pops people aren't expecting it.
---
Yep. I rarely ever have standoffs as a survivor. I don’t urban evade looking for it like a lot of people probably do. I just sprint around the map. I’ll either find it first, or the killer will see me and end up downing me. Whatever 
---
Stealth 100
---
I currently in my jammies and i just nutted. On the bright side I'm extremely ticklish so i get built in d-strike.
---
No ive just escaped a killer right behimd me so many times. If you get there you are out
---
DM me as well, if ya don't mind.
---
My favorite movie of 2018
---
You’re gonna have to add me on discord, cause i can’t send links properly
---
I think this guy is lost...
---
Okay who or what or why is this a thing. What are people referencing?
---
Nah, she is just freezing, that's why she is so blue! Nothing to see here folks, move on.
---
Wha- you don't seem to understand what I was saying. She is actually really easy to play it's not difficult to follow the scratches there isn't too much skill behind it
---
Obviously
---
SAY SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!
---
Not everyone who crawls out the gate got downed in it. Or even near it. Such as in [this match] (https://youtu.be/XRX1xgOHDtU) several months ago.
---
Here we go bois
---
So to turn while running you need to change the keys you're holding. If you want to look forward while running you will hold w. If you want to look to your right while running you turn your camera while switching to the a key. If you want to look behind you, as you turn the mouse you move from w to a to s as the camera looks behind entirely.
---
If you want to practice this play the tutorial and practice switching. It's weird at first but you get used to it especially when you learn the maps. Playing the tutorial will prevent you or your team being killed while learning.
---
Ah, what's your discord tag?
---
I mean, Google *does* exist...
---
That would be one of my perks; the flip flop throw or Mother's discipline( sweet childhood memories): throw the flip flop at the killer to stun him, but have reduced mov. Speed for a few seconds or until you get your flip flop back.
---
I'm really pissed that I didn't think of that...
---
Fire up is the most op perk in the game. It makes freddy unstoppable 
---
Devs confirmed the injured one won't go through I think
---
Yea they definitely earned that escape lol but yea after listening to a few replies maybe something like if you stand in the gates too long or something but blood warden could cover that I guess too. 
---
Because what he stated was devoid of evidence, making it not a fact, but an opinion. His statement is not self-evident. 
---
The not looking back to track the killer in that clip stressed me out so much.
---
Even just knowing someone else is being chased is powerful. 
---
like if you also read this in Michael's voice xD
---
True I know I’ve stood there before just for that reason. I definitely understand why they designed it that way but it’s online so ppl definitely will take advantage of it in trolling ways lol 
---

Cover one person with one colour so if there are 4 people they will have 4 different colours although it doesn't really work with one person
---
Franklin’s is almost useless unless there are 2 or more items making it completely useless when you don’t even know to bring it or not which is my point. If you take away seeing items then Franklin’s would be completely useless which, imo, isn’t good game design. Nobody lobby dodges because of items unless it’s like 4 flashlights but even then smart killers wouldn’t dodge because almost no survivors would be on gens most of the time due to trying to get a flashlight save. You say you are fine having killer perks hidden yet ask for a double blind match which is the reason I “went down that path.” It wouldn’t do much if you knew beforehand that a survivor has a key unless the killer would specifically go after the person with one and NOT chase anyone else which would most likely detriment the killer’s game doing the exact opposite of their goal by chasing the survivor with a key. Besides, you worry about the killer tunneling you to get rid of the key either A: Run a more stealthy build to not get caught in the first place or B: Don’t bring a key. Idk about you or anyone else but I don’t plan out my attack before playing a game as killer based off of items. My strategy is based off of my perks that I bring which again can be countered by a swf group looking at them. But it seems I’m not changing your mind and you aren’t changing mine so I guess we’ll agree to disagree
---
I don't, but then again I really don't care about the win and pipping currently is too easy, so you don't even really need to try to actually pip. I just like to play super aggressive, and enjoy the chases. 
---
Well its because nurse has to aim her blinks legion can just sprint around like a madman
---
depends, are you playing on console or pc?
---
Damn autocorrect fixed it
---
Bubba just wanted to have the *s e x*
---
High ranks are sweaty plays, you are not entitled to a 4K, although many of the game mechanics are straight up frustrating especially when rank 1s abuse the full extent of it.
---
People will find ways to be dicks no matter what lol. Until they create a single player version you'll have that.
---
People need to stop comparing them. The reason people hate legion more than nurse is because he takes no skill. If the legion isn't braindead there is no counter play. If legion misses he can continue to swing. Nurse has a very punishing fatigue if she misses. You can Dodge her blinks. She takes time and skill so players respect good nurses more.
---
Contagious laugh. No one else thinks so?
---
Just a random question but who did they replace Donald Pleasence (Samuel Loomis)  with ?
---
Spelling mistake from mobile
---
When you bring an objective bloodpoints offering and just get tunneled all game.
---
I thought there was something new to the game I was missing.
---
Unpopular opinion: if a killer gets 3k or 4k from face camping then you just suck as survivors. #SadTruth
---
Mhm. Sacrifice in particular is practically impossible to obtain because a Survivor transitioning between phases causes you to lose out on the 500 Bloodpoints for hooking a Survivor initially.
---
Interestingly enough the most "efficient" way to gain Sacrifice Bloodpoints is to hook a Survivor twice (700 for each hook) and then Mori them to gain 1000 (+300 on the base value you would recieve.)
---
In university? 🤔
---
This is awesome! Did you get it from a bakery or did you/someone you know make it? Love the airbrush work and the “bloody” knife.
---
Aaah ok. I was so confused and went on the dbd gamepedia looking through all the perk icons to try and find it lol
---
True that Nurse requires more skill to learn.
---
But a good Nurse does exactly what a Legion does, but even better. They'll ignore all gameplay mechanics, can even go through walls (something Legion can't), and only requires 2 hits to down.
---
They both bring the exact same problem forward, just Nurse requires more skill. But a good (enough) Nurse is as much anti-fun to play against as a Legion is.
---
Reason you don't hear people complain about Nurse anymore is because everyone's gotten used to her being there. People will probably get used to Legion at some point too. But not after we've complained about it a million times first.
---
Any ideas for fatalities?
---
Well okay then 
---
So you're one of the players who rely on Claudette's invisibility to escape the killer because you're completely shit at chases?
---
Quinton?
---
Base game on pc gives you: Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, and Huntress
---
DLC characters you can buy with shards: Hag, Doc, Spirit, Legion, and Clown
---
DLC characters you have to buy with money: Cannibal, Pig, Michael, and Freddy
---
Basically licensed killers as in come from existing material outside the devs you have to buy with money
---
I wasn’t aware he was a dentist 
---
Does hitting on the hook actually do anything or just a BM.
---
The guys face is the face of the game director Mcote
---
And deviousness for certain PIG like characters. The game could do with huge QoL and revamps. Interesting about 2 hooks and then mori. Makes me want to use dh just to get a few more sweet sweet blood points 
---
It's most likely Mori BM'ing, where the killer just trolls the survivor by repeatedly starting the Mori but not holding it. 
---
Rotten labia 
---
gotcha i didnt know how those worked because it didnt specify if its at the end game screen or in the match
---
Tier lists are based on opinion, there really isn't one everyone uses. Some say Leatherface is mod tier while most say he isn't. It just depends
---
makes perfect sense, yeah.
---
*also, films aren't good but I enjoy watching them cause they're not pretensions (?) in my view. it's something light and funny to watch, also some boys are kinda cute *cough* Jasper *cough*
---
4 man of Claudettes, never seen that before, super original
---
*laughs in Billy*
---
My mum made it for me! 
---
I bet it runs better on Snes than Ps4.. 
---
just BM
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Moonrise
---
They could really do with adding new scoring events to Survival and without a doubt switch some existing ones over.
---
For some reason Self Care (before you finish) counts towards Altruism. Which is just dumb.
---
Searching Chests, in my opinion, would fit much better in Survival than Objective.
---
Escaping a chase could also be switched to Survival while keeping the points you get for the duration of the chase in Boldness I suppose, or switch both over.
---
It's because there's no point in complaining about Nurse anymore most people have accepted that the devs aren't going to do anything with her and that it is a staple in dbd 
---
"If you take away seeing items then Franklin’s would be completely useless which, imo, isn’t good game design."
---
Except that's complete BS because hardly EVER does a game go by without at least someone bringing an item in, and a game NEVER goes by without items being found. So no.
---
"Nobody lobby dodges because of items unless"
---
You can stop right there. The fact that people are willing to lobby doge due to items only proves my point, because nobody should be lobby dodging. The feature to leave a lobby is there so you can leave a game before it starts If you need to, not so you can be a cowardly killer. 
---
"It wouldn’t do much if you knew beforehand that a survivor has a key..."
---
If you believe it makes no difference, then why exactly are you arguing so much for it? Is it perhaps because you're one of those lobby-dodging franklins-using killers? Because that's sure what it sounds like.
---
"would most likely detriment the killer’s game"
---
And yet trollish killers (and there's a lot of them) will be just as happy to rob one person of their item, even if it costs some survivors to escape. you make it sound like tunneling equals a game loss, when that's not necessarily true. But I'm sure you knew that when you wrote that sentence. 
---
"A: Run a more stealthy build to not get caught in the first place"
---
*yawn* Blaming survivors for the shitty behavior of a tunneling killer. Great job *slow clap*
---
"B: Don’t bring a key."
---
Then what's the point in having them exist? They are to be used. How about killer mains stop being a shitball just because a key is in the game? Or better yet, how about we just HIDE items before going into a game. HMMMMMM??????
---
"I don’t plan out my attack before playing a game as killer based off of items."
---
And yet you're so dead set against them being invisible to the killer. So I'm not buying it. 
---
"I’m not changing your mind"
---
Nope, you're definitely not. 
---
Yes please.
---
&gt;when often it's a cypress.
---
Are we playing the same game?
---
Nah that's just rape

And it's still up to debate since I love playing on The Game and Léry's as a survivor, but I put them since it's the general opinion on those maps.
---
And even if survivors got nerfed a lot last year, if you nerf x times something that was completly broken at first, it doesn't mean that they are shit now or even balanced. Lenght of the games have barely been touched, which is one of the principal issues, only with the healing speed change. And there are lists of killers/survivors nerfs, spoiler : killers' list is twice as long.
---
In a straight up game sense, i've gotta agree. At times it's the smart play and your best move to win.
---
On the fun side it can be extremely unfun and annoying but I can still see that it makes sense, usually.
---
...but then realises that it's a locker instead.
---
I'd actually buy this.
---
Spoken like someone who’s never tried to find a P3 Urban Claudette. 
---
Weird, when I saw the reveal, I thought "Baraka could totally be a killer in DBD"
---
Had a match last night where someone waited to DC til I picked them up and had them almost to the hook.
---
Awww bubba is a softie. A trapper dropped me at the hatch last night after all of my teammates did stupid stuff (we were 1 gen from exit gates 😭) and died
---
This is amazing to think about and love that Nea is there. 10/10
---
You’re dumb.
---
Opinions of fun are different. Great for you that you like it. Majority of the people though, hate going against a good Nurse. A chase doesn't last longer than 20 seconds against them. You can immerse and hide from her, but you can hide from the Legion, too, just stay far enough away.
---
Maybe base it off their moris? I’m not sure
---
r/wtfstockphotos
---
That's true. But a game being over quick still doesn't make that particular scenario any more or less fun, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Yesterday, I decided to switch out Adrenaline for Borrowed Time. The Freddy downed me RIGHT AFTER the exit gates got powered.
---
The ONE TIME I have ever needed it and I didn't have it. Ugh...
---
Yea I agree, I just liked this nightmare on elm street. and think this would be a good addition to the already shitty clothing line
---
I updated the [survivor](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915788214540/) one which is outdated but not in english. If you want I can translate the survivor list I updated and make a new post of it. The [killer](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/1621724915795099897/) one I believe has been updated.
---
I didn’t make this clear but it’s not that I’m struggling, I know the counters and used them, the point was that swf isn’t fun to go against most of the time, my bad for not articulating that better
---
No. That is your logic. I used your logic against you. Simple as that. You are an asshole.
---
Haha, Quinton!
---
To kill people when the exit gates are powered. Myers only uses his instadown before exit gates are powered because it takes time to charge it and you don't have time when exit gates are powered
---
Did you even read what i wrote? 
---
Just because some dumb survivor farms his friend doesn’t mean you have to automatically take the injured survivor. Knock them down fine but go chase the farmer and hook him.
---
How about okkillersilly because my mom seid that the I word isn’t good 🥺🤓😎😎😎😝
---
Yea, I forgot. The buff is not going live. Yet another perk that does nothing on legion
---
Discussing facts and math without any toolboxes or great skill checks a generator takes 80 seconds to do. This means that if the Survivors have Toolboxes (BNPs?) or hit Great checks they could easily do a gen in 60 seconds if there's no Ruin to deal with. This means that if a Killer is chasing a Survivor the other 3 could easily do 3 gens in the span of 60 seconds.
---
Hahaha ok buddy, found the guy who tunnels the same guy all game.

Oh shit for real?? That would be so awesome

Still remember the match where two people were hooked in the basement and then the Killer found me. I looped them around the *entire* map and got 8k Boldness and when I was finally downed I saw the last survivor crouching beside the shack. (Presumably the hatch had spawned around there.)
---
I struggled for as long as I could in the hopes that the Killer would find the fucker and kill them. They did. Most satisfying shit in some time.
---
yeah, far enough of objectives and never finish gens, sure.
---
type like a normal person
---
I was still running though
---
Once you name it , you start to become attached to it, now Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
---
Summon the dedicated servers!!!
---
This is why it’s the killers job to apply pressure across the map. If they can’t do this then they immediately find themselves in a losing situation against good survivors. 
---
I never think that a killer should disengage from a chase. You can’t get better by running away, it’s a stupid argument for people to use especially considering your not meant to win every game, hence multiplayer.
---
Now the real issue is that when you talk about changing how much time survivors spend on the objective you need to look at the stats which show how often survivors escape and you need to think about the low ranks as well as the high. 
---
Now going by the stats we’ve been provided each killer has over an average of two kills per match at ranks 1-4. 
---
At lower ranks this number increases and puts newer players into a game in which they lose more often than not. 
---
Now imagine you were to let’s say something as basic as add 20 seconds per gen to get closer to our 2minute average. Not only would this be incredibly boring for survivors and simply add to the m1 simulator, you’d be completing negging any new players and increasing the kill rate at high ranks even more.
---
You can’t balance around the 1% of the player base in a game like this. It’s simply not applicable here. Far too many players have this mentality and I really think it needs to stop until the game itself is in a more stable and balanced place. 
---
Also, sorry for late response, power went out and I past the fuck out.
---
Yeah. I feel like people really exaggarate how bad he is.
---
Killer: I treat all Survivors equally there's never a reason to tunnel.
---
Survivor: *Clicks Flashlight once*
---
Killer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P-IrIGObzQ
---
To instadown when youre not in tier 3? Didnt think it was rocket science
---
Why is your mom that cool
---
IDK too situational for my taste cause most maps have plenty of vaults but only a few have really good drops. Balanced is awesome on The Game which Lithe sucks on for example
---
Is that the escape cake oml
---
If you mean the doll well because he's a doll. The movies never showed him to have his own mind, he was controlled and set up by John Kramer. Plus he's really tiny and would work right for hooking and carrying. But if you mean John Kramer himself then yeah Idk why they didn't make him the killer since he was the main one and his traps are able to be escaped from unlike Amandas.
---
Is... is the knife edible?
---
You can actually fast vault the lockers because when the killer opens the locker the sound is indistinguishable from you entering so fast vaulting saves time. Still well done though I think that killer mighy need some glasses
---
Only two survivors loaded in and the one disconnected as soon as he realized only 2 people were in the game. This annoying especially since I used mint rag and didn't have a black ward or anymore. 
---
What does soy taste like?
---
Because AirPods are becoming more popular but they’re still incredibly overpriced, so people just starting making jokes like “Smells like broke in hear” and the “can’t hear us meme”
---
ive gotten 8k in survival before from a farming match, i didn’t use deliverance. i probably self cared quite a lot of time. i think it would be very very difficult in a non farming match though.
---
Lol maybe pulling them back is a little too much, but maybe a timer if you stand in there to long you can’t crawl out or something like bloodwarden kicks in because past a certain time you aren’t standing there to look out for teammates you just want to troll. Noed would definitely be busted tho if they couldn’t crawl out tho
---
I wish it was😂
---
I got the kitchen knife and stuck it in! 
---
I have flashlights everywhere in my house including 2 in my pockets right now and pretty warm and dark sweater...
---
Most accurate post I've ever seen on this page
---
seeing 8k in all categories and 32000 overall (64000 because of we’re gonna live forever) was very satisfying.
---
Have you seen any Saw movie? Jigsaw is literally a doll and John Kramer is a weak old man.
---
She did a great job! 
---
Could you link me the add on with the dbd models? 
---
The herky jerky has gotten too high.

I was running out of ideas for memes and someone on discord told me to Google stock photos and this came up

I dont break ruin often but when I do it was 3 feet away.

Youve got barbaque and ruin by rank 14 youve got some real good rng lol?

---
Me and my friends do it all the time. In fact did it like 10 mins ago and changed out names to try and get the killer to farm but he tunnelled and camped one person, but we managed to gen rush and all escape. Would have been so much better if the game had gone on longer though.
---
Pretty much every killer below rank 8 runs it now its an epidemic. Ive seen so many huntreses and myers running it its insane 
---
And when I say flashlight it's not a dumb little key ring thing... it's more like [this](https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;id=ACA6924409C62C84739414F7E77BC675734A16F0&amp;thid=OIP.0Amwpj5dT87AZsIPFkCoOAHaHa&amp;mediaurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elightbulbs.com%2Fcatalog_product_photos%2Feveready%2F10139lg.jpg&amp;exph=1024&amp;expw=1024&amp;q=flashlight+energizer&amp;selectedindex=25&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;vt=0&amp;eim=1,2,6) (yes it's the actually model, the other one is a little dynamo one so noisy but at least it last almost forever).
---
John had to have others do the kidnapping for him because he was so weak from the cancer. Makes perfect sense for Amanda to be the one chasing people. 
---
You were the last guy tho.
---
I like the knife. Really adds to it!
---
but if you /s that comment that means you actually think fire up does something
---
exactly. whiny killer mains act like survivor is still op and they keep running into depip squad every game but thats not the case. in fact, i rarely get games where more than 1 person escapes. they're so fucking entitled lmfao, they want their kills handed to them on a silver platter 
---
I s2g everytime
---
That cake looks great! but ew frosting on the handle
---
That perk is total bs for reasons like this and it is so soooooo annoying when it happens to you as a killer. I’m a survivor “main” but do play killer at sometimes and I stoped using perks like adrenaline and sprint burst because I realized how annoying it is. 
---
A timer with it being a NoEd/Bloodwarden zone I think would be fair. So once the timer runs out it becomes that way. 
---
Just to prevent a workaround i think the timer stays once they step into the zone. So they can choose to leave or stay.
---
I think at that point it should be a hatch game which the killer should be allowed to close it, for BP, and a few gens should light back up. 
---
So more gameplay and points for everybody. Maybe make the gens have a shorter repair bar
---
I never run it, specially on my Myers. If you play well you wont need it. And with Myers I'M NOED.
---
At least he would die happy...
---
Only underwear :(
---
you had me dying when you brought Philosopher Immanuel Kant into this debacle oh yes more of these memes 😍😍
---
I get that NoED is one of the two worst designed perks in the game and all, but why is anyone surprised when literally any killer uses it. 
---
Like who wouldn't use a perk that gives you free instadowns when you've lost the game? Just like no one should be surprised that people use a perk that gives them a second chance when they've lost the chase.
---
Dull totems don't get notifications. (And if you mean that you get no notification on your hex totem, then you probably just missed it)

just break the chase by hiding duh

No. The Michael in DBD is from the original 1978 Halloween
---

---
oh geez oh man oh no jkae this can’t be happnign im literally crying and shakin right now
---
A friendly Wraith did the same to me last night when I was left alone after like 5 mins into the game.
---
He even let me farm points for a while leading me into pallets to drop and gens.
---
I read a few posts about toxic community but I played 8 hours yesterday (first day and loving it) and all I got were good interactions and GGs after the game.
---
they make it so you get rituals for whoever you play as the least.
---
Fkin amazing (in my opinion) it was almond and vanilla 👌🏻
---
The last three... Badly phrased. She did nothing after getting hooked once.
---
Nurse definitely doesn't do what a legion does. Nurse has plenty of counter-play opportunities, but the vast majority of the player base doesn't know them. I see it literally all the time when I play nurse. Most players even at rank 1 have zero idea on how to play against her, so they go down real fucking fast then blame the killer, when in reality they're just playing poorly. I'm not going to go into detail as to what her counter-play options are but suffice it to say they exist.
---
Legion is the opposite in a sense that there is nothing you can do. Actually zero options in the playbook to allow you to stay up if the legion knows the most basic strategy that was apparent to anyone with a brain the moment he was released. 
---
I've been saying this since he was released, long before this subreddit decided to flip their opinions on him, when they were begging for buffs. I don't even play a game against legion, I'm just going through the motions and pretending to play a game.
---
just say him "Ochidito" and thery will be raging af, btw, ochido is trash
---
Anything that makes it hard for killers to do stuff is considered garbage. I think we all should stop complaining or find another game to play. 
---
I dont care about none of that. There should be a killer in the game that can instantly murder looping bastards.
---
Your account has a level, which caps at 100. Once you break 100 you get dropped back to level 0 and get a "devotion" level. Your iridescent shard gain goes back down to 50 (from 300), and it takes longer for you to level up, and your iridescent cap is still 300 once you work your way back up
---
Nurse: Snaps her fingers and their legs explode. She then teleports on top of them, grabs their hair and saws their head in half  
---
Spirit: The enemy looks at her and takes a few steps back. She then disappears, reappearing behind them (unseen for the camera), and stabs them through the chest. They fall to their knees and she ritualistically beheads them.  
---
Huntress: She throws two hatchets at their feet, pinning them to the ground. Then, she swing her ax at their midsection, almost splitting them in two horizontally. They fall on their knees and she delivers a final, vertical blow, cutting them in half vertically, and the removed quarter of them falls down forward, while the rest of the body falls backwards
---
"Just break the chase" lmfao
---
EZ baby survivor just break chase OmegaLuL
---
Sacrifice probably works the way it does to discourage camping. If having a survivor get hooked once and never get unhooked was the most efficient way to get points camping would be more rampant than it is. 
---
The way the points works encourages the killer to be engaged with all the survivors and the survivors to be engaged with the killer. It's not a perfect set up but it encourages a style of play that keeps everyone engaged.
---
Damn it. I'd love for an Old Man Myers skin
---
Oh okay thank you! How much longer does it take?
---
Wait are they doing something with the walking dead?
---
Exept no one complains about legion because he is the worst thing since freddy
---
You mean nurse
---
I honestly don't know why people people like this map. Doesn't matter whether you're a survivor or killer, it fucking sucks.
---
I got a seizure trying to understand the title. 
---
Because the doll doesn't do anything by itself and John Kramer is just a mastermind, while Amanda actually hunts people. Out of all the movies she's the one that makes most sense for a Saw inspired killer. I don't see the confusion in the decision.
---
Getting Quentin as the Freddy survivor instead of Nancy, now that's actually crap.
---
Don’t you mean...AN ESCAPE CAKE?!
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
It's not an outrageous amount, but for a reward system, it's simply just not rewarding (maybe even the opposite) . 
---
Nurse is a ton harder to play than legion
---
If only there were hex totem candles! Still cool though!
---
Sloppy Butcher is a great perk on her you can use to trail people while getting back into crouch. Eventually they'll think they've lost you only for you to spring up and ambush them.
---
Whispers is a good perk on them too. Approach a gen, crouch, listen for the whispers to trigger. If it does, go for a stab, if it doesn't, head to another gen.
---
Monitor and Abuse is another good one allowing you to tinker with your radius for a bit more stealth while standing and moving between gens.
---
Ruin &amp; BBQ are of course good too, but they're good on everyone.
---
True, but when you're doing that, you lose scratch marks and have very little visibility. It's super super easy to juke.
---
"Huge nurse counterplay, trust me. I cant discuss the counterplay, but it's there. Most counterplay ever." 
---
Ok.
---
Everyone has been complaining about legion.  
---
Except that penalizes the killer, whereas nothing that a Survivor does really penalizes them. And you pretend like they don't talk shit in the post-game chat.
---
Man that would be the best! 
---
No problem, thank you, it remains for me to practice and not freak out.
---
Its not just that though, when you go againts legion you you're healing like 60% of the game which is just plain borring. 
---
And then when you're in chase, sometimes the game doesnt register that he is still chaseing you so your timer keeps ticking till you have to choose to either mend infront of him or just go down.
---
Sounds like an interesting change of pace, rather than bad for the game. 
---
Except Legion is aids. Coming from someone that p3 lvl 50ed them with all perks and I can tell you that they're not fun to play as or play against. I only played them because they gave me 110k per match during the event. Other than that they're pretty useless
---
Ive made this same suggestion in the past and got downvoted into oblivion, thats for seeing the light.

if they presented it to you and said “your offering, an escape cake” best gift ever
---
Poor hag is outside alone and Amanda didn’t even get an invite :(
---
Haha standing in front of that death camera is on of my new favorite things to do as killer
---
my feels
---
Honestly that isnt really the full reason why legion is bad for dbd. Theyre really bad for dbd because their mechanic is miserable to play against and they’re functionally useless to play as. Its like being constantly harassed by a doctor except less interesting.
---
Well to maybe change your mind, we did a test with a friend with some gens to see how the addons affect repair time, my thoughts were that they are all added together so 25% from addons and 15% from the toolbox and then added to base spedd, so 140% total speed or they are added multiplicatively so roughly 145%. But in practice it seems that all the repair bonuses are added together multiplicatively then added to the base speed so in total you have roughly 119% repair speed compared to the 115% with just the toolbox. So charge addons are the way to go.
---
If I was the killer I wouldn't even hook you if I downed you right after the sandbag. Like when someone farms right in front of me, I just slug the farmed and go after the one who farmed.
---
That's sad
---
Gross, she probably has glass shards in there you masochist
---
literally do that with rank 1 Nurses. what the heck?
---
Waaaah everyone who has better things to spend $5 on is self rightous ;( Lemme totally pwn them quick with my lines from detached irony bros on Twitter

The legendary loot box drop, a Bubba that's not an asshole!

I hate how relatable this is
---
It doesn't take longer, what are you talking about? It takes exactly the same amount as the first time you leveled up.
---
So why the fuck do I get so many trapper rituals and no nurse or pig rituals?
---
I am jealous of you 
---
idk, maybe it’s not character specific, just killer/survivor
---
Amanda's bedind Anna and Rin on the floor lol
---
no benefit from it game wise. Its just being a friendly opponent to give hatch, sort of like a pat on the back like "well done, here you go"
---
Nobody who complains about how shitty legion is for the game isn’t going to also complain about nurse. Difference is one is op and the can be op but is mostly just piss poorly designed 
---
&gt;Nurse has plenty of counter-play opportunities
---
You're full of shit, literally only counterplay vs a top tier nurse is to not be found. Once you are in a chase vs her there is nothing to be done. 
---
Man, I'm glad you gave me the secret to playing survivor. Now I'll survive every game. Thanks dude 
---
Mine nod furiously 
---
Oh wait I read it wrong. I thought you said "play the last". Makes sense now
---
Baby Survivor. Back then I was still a Killer main.
---
Isn’t that achievement for getting 5k in each category 
---
Hey I've gone against someone with that twitch name. I think the scenario was flipped and I was the nurse though, lol
---
Or some headphones. Maybe both glasses and headphones. 
---
It's not always optimal to split pressure. It depends on the context of the situation. Sometimes, a lot of times actually, it is more effective to confirm a kill. This is especially true if the team is an over altruistic swf that popped 2 gens in 2 minutes. 
---
In a situation where you're not pressured by time, it's best to split pressure to keep others on gens. But generally a killer needs to confirm a kill by 2 gens or they lose. This is especially true when the survivors manage to avoid a 3 gen strat.
---
This is what I think a lot of survivor mains don't consider. If a killer is behind on gens then he has to secure a kill to have a chance at winning.
---
At the end of the day Survivors generally don't care about the killer enjoying the game (DS, flashlights, insta heals, etc.) so I don't get why some complain when they get tunneled. 
---
Claudette 100\*
---
At least Nurse takes a ton of skill. Legion is just the glue eater of the Killer cast
---
Unless you're playing against as godteir nurse which is basically never the case then she always has counterplay.
---
Wraith and Nurse, right?
---
Nope just gotta tough it out. 
---
Oooh I see what you're saying
---
I know you are trying to make an argument here, but there is literally no way you can think Legion is better equipped than Nurse. Nurse is on of the best killers in the game. Legion is one of the worst killer in the game. I say this as a Survivor.
---
I love that turn. "You're next."
---
You idiot, dbd will read this and remove nurse fatigue.
---
"because he takes no skill"
---
t. user with spirshit picture
---
Unlucky
---
God yes
---
"The killer chasing one person gives the other three free generator time." - survivors talking about any other killer.
---
I guess that bit doesn't apply to killers you don't like to play against though. Sure, Legion needs tweaks, but let's be honest, Leatherface is a stronger killer overall with the same basic skill requirements. 
---
Welcome to the community! 
---
DBD is a great game, and the subreddit is even better. At higher ranks (I believe) toxicity tends to be more predominant, but I’m not sure as I’ve never made it that far lol
---
Anyone who thinks killers are underpowered sucks at playing killer. The hierarchy is SWF &gt; Killers &gt; all other survivors.
---
Interesting for about 2 seconds, until you realize that every survivor tool is worthless to fight them. Once you're in the Legion's sight, you will only escape if they are actually braindead.
---
The only counter play against Nurse in a chase is to run around a corner, and choose to double back or not. Its literally 50/50 whether or not the Nurse predicts you. Either you faked the fake, or it was just a regular fake.
---
It’s what he deserves. 
---
I don't get it? 
---
&gt;How can killer mains say their underpowered
---
The word you're looking for is they're* The word their is possessive. 
---
Also, I don't know anyone who actually says that unless they're really bad at the game.
---
I mean, you obviously have a fair amount of teachables unlocked, not sure what you expected. 14 bloodwebs out of max of 159 is just a drop in the bucket.
---
Big difference between nurse and legion is also that legion is really consistant in his chases, no matter how good a survivor is, there is a certain amount of time before they go down when facing him/her, against a nurse a chase can last a lot longer (that being if the nurse is not that good), but her chases can also be over in a second. I'd choose a good legion over a decent nurse any time as many people, even at rank 1 and including me, can't reliably keep a decent nurse busy for as long as they would with against a legion. However,  that consistancy does make for games that are more boring, and should be looked into imo.
---
He only ignores stealth if he's hitting a fresh target. Are you really going to say that him not tunneling one person is the issue with him? 
---
against a good nurse this might work two times and then she should just short blink you
---
I’ll take that over ripping chains out of my body, cutting off my owl flesh, or other horrifying body mutilations. Just let me die quick and easy, I don’t care about my life THAT much
---
Anna loves children, Freddy “loves” children
---
You're using her best add on, an ebony mori, and NOED......right 
---
Yeah, you'll be fine
---
Wraith doesn't deserve Nurse!
---
megWOKE
---
Thanks!
---
I'm really enjoying it; I can't believe it took me so long and a free weekend to actually try the game.
---
I'm getting the Halloween edition and Leatherface, is there anything else I should get? 
---
Hey Friends,
---
This is the list that the Amino App came up with for licenses characters we would love to see in this awesome game!  Let me know what you think!
---
Very nice
---
If you think the hierarchy is SWF over killer then you're mediocre at the game. The true hierarchy is killer &gt; SWF &gt; all other survivors.
---
Sad but no
---
Nurse has a stun built into her kit. Legion has a kit built that basically eliminates any slowing or stun besides the actual pallet drop.
---
Nurse has a ton of aiming involved and can easily thwart her own chases. Once a Legion sees you, he only has to run in a straight line.
---
Nurse losing sight means she has to throw herself blindly forward. Legion losing sight means you crouched around the corner and are waiting to get hit because he's way faster than you.
---
Nurse gets one hit per set of blinks. Legion gets enough to down you and your friend through his dumb mechanic.
---
She’s a kid killer too, though.  She kills 100% of male kids intentionally and 100% of female kids unintentionally by starving them in her dungeon.  By contrast, Freddy is (in relative terms) less terrible as his child victims had a 50% survival rate irrespective of gender and while his torture was more, ahem, “severe”, it was also over more quickly whereas kids can take a really fucking long time to starve to death or die of disease chained to a wall in a corpse filled basement.
---
Clicked on the image and zoomed in to look for Nea. Did not leave disappointed
---
You’ve never played against a half decent SWF then. 
---
That came off as incredibly condescending. I’m all for correcting grammatical errors, but don’t sound patronizing when doing so. 
---
Alright let me rephrase.
---
SWF with communication with the sole purpose of depipping the killer &gt; Killer &gt; SWF &gt; all other survivors.
---
Yep. A strategy u shouldn't always use. But i played nursi gurl long enough to know her. And the ghosty boi to. ( main ) and i just started playing survivor and i troll them 😂
---
Like to see Jason, but doubtful that would happen.
---
First off dont be a grammar nazi and also im on console where everyone is shit at the game
---
The dolls name is billy. Not jigsaw. 
---
This isn't discussion, this is salt/rant. We all know FM Legion is not fun to play against. 
---
Im not the killer
---
What rank are you? He is incredibly easy to counter and everyone will simply run you around at higher ranks. You should try Hillbilly, especially once you have BBQ.
---
The difference is, with nurse you have to learn how to blink, how to predict and when to and when not to swing before you can ignore game mechanics, with legion you just plug your mouse and keyboard in and you can ignore game mechanics 
---
Changed, my bad
---
sounds like a threat
---
Im not killer
---
Well actually it’s nurse &gt; swf &gt; killers &gt; survivors
---
Im not the killer btw
---
Repost?
---
Squadette! 
---
Let’s Talk.
---
What’s the power?
---
Oh yeah that's right. I always get the names confused lmao my bad
---
The finishing the foghorn generator is my favorite thing to do in the game. 
---
Damn, I didn’t notice her at all. Nice!
---
Yea its kinda sad that people need a perk that allow them to stay at high ranks instead of learn how to be better at the game without it.
---
Boldness for Hex, Survival for dulls~
---
They’re garbage people- that’s why. 
---
Disconnecting is the only thing you can do in the game I qualify as “toxic,” and it’s ridiculous people defend it. It DOES make me smile when I’m running Dying Light and the obsession rage-quits thirty seconds into the trial... but I’d still rather have the stack.
---
Wait... Legion is considered good now? When did this happen? Were they buffed?
---
the bill was more than close enough for you to hook and then kill the bill lmao
---
She's a supernaturally powerful teenage girl with a ruler who can shatter a wooden pallet into nonexistence with two kicks and throw around guys twice her weight without breaking a sweat.
---
Fuck your face 
---
With that logic they could do the same to the Hag. But the Entity empowers the killers so. 
---
&gt;I guess my sarcasm didn't come across...
---
what did you mean by this then
---
32* says the only person running vigil
---
what? man, i'm saying you can counterplay Nurse in chase and you can't Legion no matter how much skill you have
---
Don’t expose me
---
I FINALLY QUIT THIS GAME
---
.
---
yeah, just for the exams. after this particular moment i will play dbd as usually
---
Classic.
---
my god dude, did you lose an argument with your mom and now you need gratification somewhere else?
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again.

 We need swimsuit cosmetics for everyone. Survivors and killers.

personally i bought every dlc in the last halloween sale when i was new because i was enjoying the game.

No. But you're contradicting yourself

A dbd fighting game would actually be sick though.

Even serial killers hate pedophiles

I don’t even play the game and I know he’s stupid

Even at rank 1, I rarely go up against nurses. And when I do, the majority of them aren't THAT good

Plus dead hard and and iron will are some serious counters against nurses

I mainly play killer, but my friends force me to play survivor until they’re done for the night. Though also I do suck at survivor since I fall for the SAME mind games I use as killer.
---
It's a crime that we don't have them already.
---
How was i being rude in any way?
---
""""""""""""quality""""""""""""
---
Ahh that would fuck me up too much
---
The maps are also bugged: when you're on specific hooks, you can't see aura's of your teammates in an angle of around 90 degrees.
---
Run!
---
Seconded, only if theres a horn that makes her cute squeak when you use it
---
Decisive strike stunts killer for 50 secs.
---
Yeah i play legion alot and even i wont touch that cancerous thing
---
If they're mending when the timer hits 0, then they don't get downed unless they stop mending prematurely.
---
None. It's the exact same leveling as the first time. Same XP cost per level, same shard rewards per level.
---
If BHVR  made Cosmetics they could get sued. because the "contract" was only for Movie Killers/Survivors.
---
Leatherface got the Masks because BHVR negotiated for them. ( The Masks were in the contract)
---
BHVR would´ve to make another contract to get Shirtless Myers which costs  **£** **£**  **£**   
---
Okay but those are also how you counterplay with her. If you run around a corner and hear her starting charging her blink then around back the way you came towards here. You can still use pallets effectively on a Nurse, it's not like pallets are completely out of the question when you play against a Nurse. After maining Nurse for awhile I'd rather play against her than a Leather face or Billy, or even pig because she's just fucking annoying. 
---
I should also mention that I just used the Iri Button addon and pallets didn't break when I vaulted them.
---
Just looks like a good old case of busted addons.
---
it combines star wars memes and dbd thats enough for me
---
You can only level past 50 so many times?
---
My friend and I spend like 90 minutes searching every corner of that map. After someone found it the killer dc'ed... Not fun.
---
BHVR, TAKE MY MONEY. 😍
---
*laughs in hag*
---
I never heal with Legion and it actually hurts him a *ton,* most Legion's don't even punish me for it too! They'll just deep wound me instead of downing me 90% of the time
---
I rely on plunderers and ace to give me fat loots. 
---
Yeah this is pretty much he cant kill anymore. By the time he injures the 4th survivor the first will be healed up.  Its already the reason Legion players tunnel.
---
But it's not. Sarcasm has a defined meaning and if it would apply to your comment, it would imply you think the perk actually does something. I agree though that your comment was worded poorly / without humor so it was percieved without it.
---
Also, time spent having fun isn't wasted time :)
---
“Hey, this is a really common mistake that people make. They’re, their, and there are all Homonyms. 
---
A homonym is a words that sounds the same as another word, but has a completely different meaning. 
---
‘There’ is used to point out a location. ‘Their’ is used to denote possession of something. ‘They’re’ is the contraction of the words ‘they’ and ‘are’. 
---
I hope this helps in the future.”
---
If you had written something like this, then I would not have said anything, but you didn’t. Instead you kind of came off as an asshole. 
---
You sound like a camper lol 
---
The Nurse was memeing. Notice that nodding right after they went in? She saw them.
---
Honestly, that’s the best there is. 
---
I’m a casual player with the Halloween edition, and Myers is great fun. Laurie also has some good perks but all survivors are identical.
---
Leather face seems cool, but I don’t have him. From my perspective, he seems kinda boring to play, but what would I know. He does have the best perks out of all killers though, so that’s great.
---
Otherwise, there’s not much worth buying. I’m considering buying Freddie, purely because he’s so different to all the other killers, but I’m still not sure. Pig is also very different. I dunno.
---
Have fun out in the fog. 
---
..................................
---
How many hours?
---
Spirit is better hands down. I like clown quite a bit, but Spirit is both more interesting to play as (and against).
---
I wa leaning a bit more towards Spirit as well 
---
Damn, any chance we can queue up with 40 survivors and 10 killers also?
---
Spirit is stronger in terms of you're probably gonna get more kills with her.
---
If deciding which one to buy just watch a bunch of YouTube vids and decide what looks more fun to you 
---
Spirit, easy to play, hard to counter. Also fun
---
Did he get a buff or something? Last I played he didnt have much counter play, but his map pressure was super situational and it was hard to use him super effectively. 
---
Spirit is better at chasing and countering loops, and more fun imo
---
Considering gens take 80 seconds with one survivor on them this is impossible.
---
&gt;It’s ridiculous people defend it. 
---
There are certain situations where I’m okay with DCing. Things like when you’re being held hostage in the basement for 20 minutes, cheating, getting stuck in a tree. 
---
Other than situations like that, I completely agree with you. 
---
So who cares? It can still be used as the killer. Its *fiction*.
---
What are u playing on? PS4: CoopLive5
---
Next Survivor: YuGay Motou.
---
Perks: Heart of the Cards, Mind Crush, Berserker Soul
---
HoC: Whenever you open a chest while holding an item you recharge your held Item by 10/20/30 percent along with gaining 0/1/1 Addon on it.
---
Mind Crush: When picked up by the Killer instead of wiggling gain 2 skillchecks which are moderately/considerably/slighty difficult and when hitting the skillchecks gain 10/15/25 percent of the wiggle timer afterwards you must wiggle.
---
Berserker Soul: Your determination to win allows you generate skillchecks on Generators/Traps&amp;Hooks/Totems at the cost of notifiying the Killer of your location. Skillchecks have none/slightly/moderately bigger Great Skillcheck bars.
---
When I say "max", I just meant max possible levels of getting a new perk.
---
There are 54 unique Killer perks currently. At 3 tiers a pop that means 162 bloodwebs. But you have to factor in each character starts with Tier 1 of their respect perks, so 159.
---
You can definitely level someone infinitely however.
---
Selfcare skillcheck give altruism or survival ? I can't remember.
---
On the other hand Freddy is a pedophile, which I would think of as even worse than killing kids with some being unintentional
---
I'm going to ask you, too, how much you've actually PLAYED Legion, or if you've only played against him, or if you're parroting the opinions of everyone else.
---
There's a reason why one of the notes on the current PTB is 'lessening the visual VFX of Legion's frenzy.' 
---
I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm saying it would be a crap idea.
---
I really don’t see the point of this post? Unless you’re just bragging, which is fine, I guess. 
---
Yeah, never had such a good game after all my totems got destroyed. Sorry that I bothered you with this post
---
Works of course against all nurses and especially against rank 1 nurses lol gg ez /s
---
When the spirit is more Mortal Kombatish then new mk kharacters
---
Dont worry I only got some shiny buttons
---
Nah but its nice that the middle building is more forgiving for killers then the real crotus prenn
---
The big secks
---
you win dude. I concede, you're better than me. Now take the gratification and please yourself.
---
Another counter to nurse is to think like the player who is nurse, but it's a small chance that you will outplay her with that tactic.
---
Good job. That's awesome.
---
What a fucking  virgin lmao
---
So etiquette? Nothing about that has changed as far as I'm concerned. And that spamming to alert the killer is close is still a thing but it totally depends on your teammates knowing what it means, because sometimes they think you're actually urgin them to go for the save.
---
One tip I would ask: if someones is on a hook and theres a gen left PLEASE finish it before unhooking, he might have Adrenaline. Also PLEASE open the gate before unhooking.
---
Someone has never heard of a toolbox and great skill checks 
---
Even Freddy could fight Susie and win. 
---
Haha too bad because now the ultra rare for yhe pirate is a new iridescent head. Got'em.
---
You rank up way too fast as a Killer, you'll eventually get to the point where you'll be outskilled by survivors every single game and then it'll be more frustrating than enjoyable.  I suggest you play a Killer, then play a Survivor game instead of playing pure Killer, this way you'll have experience on both sides making you an even more effective Killer in the long run. It's tricky, starts as relatively easy to kill and suddenly you'll reach ranks where 1 survivor is capable of juking you for 5 gens.
---
a dbd player had 115mil at one point because the devs reimbursed him a little bit too many bloodpoints. currently he’s sitting at around 75 mil.
---
Since when does Spirit take no skill? Facepalm
---
Probably because you’re on console the devs need to sort there shit out on console. 
---
Qounten
---
Hooks respawn
---
A follow up on this. Literally just happened to me accept he just dc as soon as I downed him.
---
Had the same problem twice with trapper a few patches ago, except I would get blood splatter and clean off his weapon after every 'hit' while the survivors ran off with no injury.  Luckily the problem seems rare.
---
I also noticed a problem where a claudette outfit would disable myers lunge and turn every swing into a quick attack when she was in lunge range (they fixed that bug after a few weeks and it got very little attention)
---
This game has more rare and inconsistent bugs then any other game I have played.
---
He’s mad you’ve been plundering his chests.
---
nah I feel like even most survivors realize there's not much you can do at that point.
---
Because killers are supposed to play poorly and deliberately make stupid decisions to not secure any kills, duh. 
---
Like after 3 minutes
---
How did you do it? Also what are those addons? I've never leveled hag

---
haHAA! Did you see the myers look at the camera when you died on the hook? That NEVER happens! Hahahaha!
---
Me_irl . But really, I love this part of the community where when the killer does something just terrible, the survivors just look at you, "really? You missed?" 
---
No, it's just different people complaining for different reasons. His map pressure still sucks and his chase times still suck, so unless you get super sweaty with him you don't win like the top tier killers win. And if you're going to try so hard why not play a killer that's actually good?
---
From the survivor's perspective, he takes very little skill to tunnel one person, and if he does 4k it's usually through a long slog of attrition where it feels like all you do is mend and kite - just stalling until it's your turn. There *is* counterplay against Legion but it's pretty basic, and unlike say a bad Leatherfacec where you can literally play a whole game against him without being hit, if Legion decides it's your turn, you're going on that hook whether he's bad or not.
---
Lol I love this. 
---
Jesus christ, finally someone gets it.
---
They are part of the base console version, because it released a year after the PC version and content up to that point was included. On PC Doctor and Hag/Feng and Ace are paid DLC.
---
Focus less on wasting a killer’s time and more on breaking the chase. Legion takes at least 3 hits, maybe 4, to down a survivor. Using the extra hits and time to prioritize finding an area with lots of walls or other means to break line of sight and hide is your best bet.  Once you break the line of sight, take advantage of it to try and hide somehow. It doesn’t always work, but it can. I escaped a legion three times in the same game and was the only person to survive the game because of it (Grim Pantry map).
---
A well timed sprint burst is also a really good method of losing legion, if you have that perk. You can sprint burst faster than Legion can frenzy. And if you outlast the initial frenzy without getting hit, that’s really advantageous. Stunning a frenzied legion with a palette can help a lot too, though that’s pretty luck based. 
---
Iron Will also helps a *lot* with breaking a chase from Legion (and most other killers). Groans tend to give you away far more than bloodstains. 
---
But on the other hand, when they don't heal I just hit them normally. I love Legion, but I acknowledge that there are huge problems on both sides. 
---
Yea I play survivor too, from time to time, and I don't want the game to be unbalanced for them either. But playing both sides has shown me that the game is more in favor of the survivors. I don't get tense or stressed as a survivor but playing as a killer I'm typically on my feet like I'm about to fight yknow?
---
That's why I think the timer should start once you step into the exit zone. If you open it and don't go in then you can go and be altruistic and help your teammates. As a survivor i generally know within a few seconds if I can save or not
---
Haha! Did you see the myers look into the camera when you died on the hook?  
---
No one has ever done that! No one has EVER done that in the history of DBD!
---
F13 done something like this, look how that turned out. 
---
Killers can still attack while blinded 
---
Try out trapper. You can quickly shut down loops and chases(with the proper set up). His beginning game is weak but can have a stronh mid-late game. You can also trap someone while you are chasing another
---
Yeah, the counterplay to "no heal" versus legion is just to walk around and M1 people. They really don't factor in how strong a 110% killer would be if they had a permanent NOED effect. I use Thanatophobia and Sloppy Butcher to further discourage healing.
---
Dead hard for nurse
---
No, people just don't like that they have to change their style of gameplay against Legion.
---
God damn it you made me chortle 
---
What is the bodyblocker add on?
---
Depending on who you’re playing as killer, idk how many times I’ve gotten people out with everyone w/ a camping killer. If someone has borrowed we all go in and go crazy. And that’s SWF and non SWF.   :)))) thanks for the challenge 
---
Especially as a DS user I hope you get me down so I get get away while the others go for the unhook.  Soooo many factors in a camper. And that’s that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
---
You miss the days of having 4 at least close enough to max level survivors at rank 18? You miss picking on brand new players? What exactly is it that you miss? The point isn't very clear here.
---
women are harder to see but make more noise then men when injured 
---
so they can be found easier by killers that are focusing on hunting through sound while the men can be found easier by killers focusing on sight
---
Dude just say black
---
Played against the Legion yesterday and the game wasnt letting me mend myself. Bug or feature? 
---
Fine because the entity will give me the clothes and items and tbh i rather be in the entities game than the real worls
---
Take the shade of white, darken it.
---
A good few shades
---
&gt; with a claudette skin tone 
---
Oh, oh no.
---
Scarred hand
---
It also penalizes the survivor, nothing the survivor does penalizes the killer too and tbagging penalizes the survivor 
---
Ruin over Lullaby all the way. Lullaby is mostly effective against inexperienced players and will only get you so far. Ruin is effective against everyone given it's not cleansed in the first few minutes of the match.
---
Did legion get buffs or has he just been out long enough people learned to use him now and stopped saying he was garbage? 
---
2 nurses sounds like a nightmare to me
---
I also assumed the survivors were above average, when most matches have maybe one decent survivor in them. 
---
There’s only a handful of killers that can’t win against top tier survivors nowadays. 
---
Yeah sure hit me up with it
---
But just run Iron Will on female characters, and that takes away that disadvantage. What then? And you can't just make male survivors shorter so they're harder to spot through sight.
---
Oh that one, but that removes ur tp unfortunately
---
You can sell it.
---
Feels bad man. I will unapologetically tunnel a survivor if I they break my totem right in front of me.
---
This is wholesome. I like this.
---
This sounds intreresting, but I believe this is a **very** big change. Like, how exactly would this multiple-killers matches be? Would this be balanced?
---
You do not get away from a good killer unless you assign three perks for this only.Just combine lithe dance with me and urban evasion if you want to actually have a chance of escaping.Otherwise you will not lose him.
---
I actually have an xbox controller that I used to use for it when I played survivor (I did like 300 hours as survivor on PC), but when I tried killer with it, it felt like I was at a major disadvantage against people who were keyboard/mouse. It's like... I play Overwatch on PC, but controllers are clunkier and don't aim as well.
---
Because David just deserved to waltz out the door uncontested, of course. How could I not see that clear and obvious fact. /s
---
No. Most survivors know this as well. If anybody goes apeshit because of that they're the kind of person that will go apeshit no matter what you do.
---
I'm glad you like it! also feel free to make any suggestions as to what I should draw next; I'm keeping a list! :)
---
I got no issues with queues on PS4, but I do get 80% disconnects from the host because the killer decides he doesn't want to play against what he sees in the lobby :)
---
Feels great to wait for it and when I find a lobby, I'm thrown back in the queue.
---
Yeah it’s infuriating being objectively better than the killer but he gets more points.
---
Lately I just run at the killer and try to loop them for as long as possible in those scenarios. Until I see Franks Mixtape then I DC on sight.
---
Is there anything to discover still tho ?
---
Sounds like the average camper.Camping because of a medkit?Excuse me?What is next?Camping because the survivor did a gen?
---
nice detailing! you did a really good job :o
---
Imagine thinking this is a good argument for Hex spawns. 
---
I see Iron Will but not more than Sprint Burst or Self Care. You can hide from a killer being an injured male and them not noticing, but if you're an injured female they are going to hear you from a mile away, so as a female character you NEED Iron Will. If you use it as a male is just your choice, you don't need it.
---
Yeah, fuck that guy for having fun in the game he payed for.
---
This is very true, on console legion is so easy to juke then the fatigue kicks in and its gg
---
They’re both pretty eh perks at high ranks unless your playing against a spirit or nurse. One merely wastes time quite often and the other is pretty situational. 
---
Mint rag and egg shell (I thinks it's egg shell), mint rag gives infinite teleport range to any trap even if it's not been triggered, eggshell is how long the traps last I'm pretty sure
---
I would say it’s a more tolerable, but it still makes the killer look kinda lame...especially if they facecamp. 
---
Well, as long as there will new perks, yes.
---
because i dont give a shit. A lot of people do and you can't really blame them for doing it.
---
Pretty much the problem is that the DLC is from the remake, so there's nothing good to take from it.
---
When at high ranks are nurses and spirits not quite common?
---
Not all the windows are always open, I've played games with only like two of them up.  It's still a good loop though
---
You can't derank past 15, ranks 16-20 are reserved for new players.
---
Based on spelling id guess the person is British
---
Or a reasonable argument you don't want to adress.
---
Always someone
---
Legion is literally the easiest killer for me. I can say to this date that I have never been fully downed by a legion while I was playing (controller died one time) my friend thinks he's overpowered but I just can't see it, unless he maybe gets buffed
---
Fuckin' Quinton
---
Getting hit for a teammate for your WGLF stack and getting “protection” points but not a stack. 
---
It's even worse if you play survivor and the killer is abusing the Sloppy Butcher glitch. It's a god damn nightmare.
---
Well, that's apparently the only version of Freddy the devs were able to get. I'd rather a Freddy than no Freddy at all. Plus, as much as I wish in-game Freddy was the original one, the 2010 version fits the aesthetic of the game more than the original.
---
Anna is the Huntress btw, who loves girls.
---
Freddy is Freddy....
---
Nothing is scarier in this game then a tier 1 meyers turning a corner and grabbing you off a gen before you can say heartbeat. 
---
I do not blame them at all.
---
I like
---
I don't have bbq of nurses , help 
---
I have unnerving and the doctor perks 
---
Anyone?
---
She is not innocent herself.
---
Fix.
---
Console.
---
Matchmaking.
---
is it good?
---
Perfect! That's exactly the stuff I need. I am 3 hours from finishing install and will be playing all Monday!
---
I know, but it doesn't make it good. I don't know, the original one with a touch of dark humor would have been much more interesting to the game. This one feels flat. The game is already a meme so it wouldn't have make it harm.
---
Yeah, but with DBD dlc is it's own special case, because it's nonlinear, alot of online dlc is typically just maps or season pass, but game's like DBD and R6 have dlc characters because character abilities are the main mechanic. A game like fallout 3 where dlc missions give the achievements, also gives a new story, while DBD you just get a new shitty character that's either to OP or to weak.
---
I thought Freddy was allegedly accused to be one but nobody had proof and he was killed and wanted revenge. I haven't seen the movies.
---
Fuck off
---
Also hearing that music and suddenly hearing the heartbeat at the same time scares the crap out of me
---
I got a pro for Christmas and I have to say it’s a lot better, very noticeable. The thing is I shouldnt have to play on a pro to get good FPS. The difference in hardware isn’t even that much, so I can’t see why it’s so bad on standard consoles compared. Just optimise your damn game.
---
X to DC
---
Some people get tunnel vision. They have someone in sight and they *need* that person before they can move on. And sometimes the longer a chase goes the less you feel like you can quit it, cause if you do all that time was wasted and what little pressure you had is gone. It's even worse when you can *almost* get them, but they 360 or you inexplicably whiff.
---
I've found myself falling into this trap before and when I do the only thing that snaps me out is the sound of a gen activating and the realization of how far behind I've fallen and that this chase isn't helping me at all. For others, though, the sound of that gen just pushes them to keep going even more, each one a new point of no return, proof they need to win *this* chase or they won't get anything.
---
The cope, lmao.
---
You assumed that i didn't watch the movies with your passive-aggresive ass: 'did you even'. Not gonna discuss with some toxic kid.
---
Thanatophobia has crap numbers though. I've used it and gone against it, literally it's only effect is turning the bar red, even if everyone is wounded it only adds a couple seconds to healing, 6-7 to a gen. Irrelevant. As long as the survivors realize this, it's a wasted perk.
---
Eric Andre references. &lt;3
---
I’m not saying I’m entitled to a 4k but I wanna have fun. I can have fun with 0 kills. Just not with a bullying swf. 
---
Ah ha ha ha! That’s hot! That’s hot!
---
Technically true about that last statement
---
I think I got face camped by you once
---
In the 2010 remake which our Freddy is based on it is confirmed, and Quinten finds the pictures proving it. They’re what’s in The Black Box add-on
---
There was nothing dumb about it as that was literally the prolific icon of the SAW franchise, the killer was dubbed the 'jigsaw killer' and the latest installment was called Jigsaw. It doesn't matter if it was a puppet that was controlled by anyone, since it's all fiction. It could easily be the killer in this game, there are literally 0 fictionious constraints for that. The only one dumb here is you, to be frank seeing you're ineptness to cope with other peoples opinion and showcasing a passive agressive tone in all of your low-quality messages.
---
Concluding, you're a childish deluded piece of shit, you can run away seeing the fact that an invidiual isn't entertaining your bait-y inferiority complex.
---
You get the trophy by getting a merciless victory, which is just the word for double pip and is only 1/4th reliant on kills.  It's possible to get it without killing a single person, and as you've seen, possible to not get it despite everyone dying.  It's all about the emblems, so you need to get lots of hooks and make sure you get away from hooks ASAP so you don't lose too many chaser points for camping.  The double pip can be tricky, especially without Ruin to help ensure a better Lightbringer emblem but just gotta keep the pressure on.
---
Ah that's hot, that's hot
---
Oh I know, but in a bizarre way she at least cares about kids despite killing them. Freddy’s just a straight up child molester
---
It would be annoying if none of the survivors did gens for a long time and instead were just crouching around in the corners. I personally never dc but I can see the reasoning for that one.
---
Myers cosmetic when
---
I only use noed on freddy cause he really needs but that's its I feel it's a useless perk and only helps at the very end 
---
r/hedidthemath
---
What
---
That depends on the structure you are hiding behind of, how you move your character, the killer itself, the angle of vision of the killer, how the killer moves and how blind the killer player is. It would make sense for bigger characters to be more spottable.
---
HEx ruin and thanatophibia are pretty hard to overcome together tho
---
Im playing on a pro and its a disaster still. 
---
Well there's nothing you can do about that, if the killer wants to ruin his and your game. He'll, I'm pretty sure you had more fun than he did, and your team survived. But I agree these kind of games are annoying for everyone but don't happen really often, and that's on the player not the game itself.
---
2019 mood
---
Thats why they remove the ability to see the killers perks postgame when you died early in a swf group :)
---
Those are all good questions let´s see what I can do here. (also this get confusing at this point already but I forgot nurse is trash at consoles so ignore those points, they´re not that big anyways)
---
1) I´m still learning English but if I understood correctly you mean that you prefer using chainsaw to move rather than using it as a proper weapon. Well to be honest I think you are in the minority who like that. Hillbilly is top tier killer and instadown is very powerful thing. I don´t play billy that much but when I do I prefer using my hammer because it´s not that easy to hit chainsaw. Well I was red ranks at the time so people knew how to counter it (daily´s etc.). I would say practice makes perfect. Don´t be afraid to use your power. Learning billy might be hard but it pays off since he is so rewarding. I just don´t like his playing style.
---
2) I can recommend Spirit highly. I main her myself so I can say a few things. Well, she is one of the best killers in the game. Definitely top tier. 2nd/3rd best after Nurse. What you´ve heard is right. She sure is hard to play as. But also rewarding. When it comes to mindgames there are not better options I think. Well as you might know her power is based on phasing. When in phase mode you move fast, like real fast. Survivours can hear when you´re near (well there is an add-on to counter that) but they never know where you are exactly. So if you have nurse´s calling for example you can see someone healing far away. You go into phase mode and then go over there and knock the survivour down. While looping you can just stand still next to a pallet. Spirit is just standing while she phases in "real life". Survivours just don´t know when you´re exactly doing that. So sometimes if you just stand still they assume that you can´t see them and then make stupid plays. When you can see them you can easily hit or even down them which is very nice. You´re on ps4 right?  Idk how common is it to use headphones over there but you know. Since you can´t see them beside scratch marks you need to use your ears. If they´re injured it makes finding survivours easier while phasing. Stridor is a good perk for beginners. I can share my build for my spirit: Hex: ruin, thanathobia, bbq and chili and nurse´s calling OR sloppy butcher. Both are good but I usually run nurse´s. 
---
Then her teachable perks are all good. Hex: haunted grounds lets you instadown for 60 seconds (lvl 3 perk) and rancor is an obsession perk that let´s you mori the obsession after they finish all the gens. Survivour becomes exposed 24/7. But he/she also gets to see your aura after completing a generator. You also see everyone´s but only for like 1 second. you can see where they are when they complete a gen. If you want to know more just ask. Also her killer design is one of the coolest in game. She looks absolutely stunning. And creepy ;)
---
3) Always use the shrine if you don´t feel like leveling up a killer you don´t wanna use (if you don´t have any extra time). Well you have started with good choices. Huntress and Hillbilly are strong. But nurse is good for all of her perks. If you want spirit you might like every 3 of her perks.
---
Hex ruin is amazing really to slow down the game. Your life will change if you get bbq and chili. These two are "meta" perks. You like to do your small build around them. Leatherface is not that good but if you learn billy chainsaw won´t be a problem with him either. Trapper´s brutal strength is nice. Agitation is okay. Unnerving is meh. 
---
I don´t know if hag is free on ps but she is good when it comes to perks and playing style. Recommend her highly. Underrated killer that you hate playing against :D 
---
I say go for hag or spirit. Watch some gameplay and make your mind. I can tell more specific stuff I believe so feel free to ask :)
---
I was in a SWF and we were all doing gens in different parts of the map. I said to everyone "Okay guys look around to see if he's stalking you"
---
Everyone said no. About 10 seconds later he pulled my friend of a gen and she said "FUCK I THOUGHT HE WAS A BIRCH TREE"
---
I keep on hearing about Legion being impossible to counter, I'm not experienced enough in the game to tell if that's true or not but I'd be interested to hear any ideas you guys have about making Legion counterable but not trash tier
---
Username checks
---
ah ok i didn't realize that, i dont really play doctor so i dont know these things
---
If you move the picture up and down you can see it move 
---
I like the way you think
---
Last time i went against a leatherface he had insidious and speed add-ons
---
Spirit
---
I had a VPN to somewhere in the bay area and didn't have this issue. 
---
I would like one, but I'm about to head off to work. Can I dm you later?
---
That update makes me happy even though im a lowkey survivor main these days
---
And like I said, that's on human anatomy, not the devs.  
---
Oh yikes, the projection in this comment is strong.
---
Nope it's not dumb, its a iconic killer and representative of the SAW franchise. Seeing that there are no fictious constraints, its entirely possible and would be, in fact, more representative of something called a 'Saw dlc'.
---
You are the one responding in my thread and keep on going about presenting your opinion as the inevitable truth. You don't know how to handle other peoples opinion thats why you resume to show passive-agressiveness in all your comments. Now you're also showcasing agressivess and emotional bramble presenting full-on projecting.
---
You sound extremely mad and you don't know how to entertain a conversation with someone that has different opinions. That's very problematic and I would advise you to take a course that helps you get some social skills. If it is misery in your personal life then I do hope it get better for you but showcasing your passive agressiveness and insulting other people on the internet will not make your life any better. Some sincere advice.
---
these all perfectly encapsulate mortal kombat's ridiculous fatalities and I applaud you for that
---
Yeah but deepwound is pretty shit to down people so my bet would be he would die first and Bubba would win thanks to his chainsaw downing multiple killers or the huntress camping somewhere and snipping people
---
If the player has decisive but isn't obsession it will take longer to get to 45% which is when the skill check will appear. But if the survivor is obsession, iron grasp will not have an impact on Decisive. Iron grasp isn't a good perk imo. I only run it during events which include "event hooks" where I may have to go to a garter hook instead of one that is closest to me. 
---
Sure you are number 2
---
Freddy probably, or Micheal. Freddy can just be a bitch and wait out the fight and then put the last killer in the dream world where he can easily win. or Micheal if he truly is unkillable. RIP Pig tho, my bet is she is dead first.
---
P3 Claudette immersion. If you are good at hiding in the non typical Claudette spots you’ll be golden. I used to play really immersed so I didn’t  even realize what the achievement was for. If you get in chase break los and leave intentional scratch marks and hide away from them. These plays work best with urban evasion. Also you might want to use balanced landing, it’s really good for breaking LOS in the main building. Sprint burst is good at getting to the building as well.
---
Playing killer requires more focus, so you can't be as responsive to chat as when you're playing a survivor. I think, that's the main reason
---
Shame on you
---
I'd become a killer and fuck all their mechanics... I'd throw down pallets and destroy them before they could use them, I'd vault windows, I wouldn't stop to wipe the blood off my weapon, etc.
---
lots of twitch streamers play killer,some people like playing killer more and some people like playing survivor more.
---
I would be so down with Billy jumping on a scooter when he goes into his sprint.
---
Finally finished this video. Thank goodness for data mining or else I would have had a hell of a time figuring out what her addons did and testing them.
---
I tried to add in more background footage from the game in this one, instead of static images during the addon section and overall to make it a bit less bland, hopefully.
---
As always, constructive criticism is appreciated!
---
I love doing that as killer. It is so funny, as a survivor, when that happens! 
---

The wurst 
---
Loops aren't the only places you can mindgame now
---
Oh, so you're bad enough at the game that you only watch it on youtube, but you feel qualified to insult someone who has first hand experience playing the killer we're discussing. OK. Got it. Glad we have that cleared up.
---
This ... does not look like a good idea
---
Keep on downvoting me little child.
---
Again, its a iconic killer and representative of the SAW franchise. Notice how in the entire movie series the killer is referenced to the 'Jigsaw killer' and how the images of the doll are used? Yes indeed. Seeing that there are no fictious constraints, its entirely possible and would be, in fact, more representative of something called a 'Saw dlc'.
---
Ironically, you are projecting and saying that I'm projecting as a response to the fact that I called you out on projecting. It's unorignial, buddy. You are the only projecting here, I was never passive agressive until you started to present your opinion as the inevitable truth and call me 'dumb'.
---
There is nothing paranoid in my comments, do you even know the definiton of this word? You are the one who is trying to frame anyone who has a different opinion as 'dumb' and using passive-agressive sentences. This is not the way to engage in discussions with people you disagree with.
---
I'm not angry at all. Look my opening post, it's perfectly calm and reasonable. My first responses to your madness-ridden comments were calm and reasonable. Until you called me dumb there was s hift in trend, but Im still not angry. It's called putting you in your place for not engaging as a civil person in a discussion that is solely based on fiction. 
---
Sure, let's keep this going. We can keep going forever.
---
The Hag and it’s not even close 
---
Every night 
---
Oh neat, thanks for letting me know!
---
I hate when people say “scared of DS”. They’re complaining that you’re not feeding their dumb perk.
---
I'm confused, haven't played for a while but tried to stay updated, wasn't people saying that Legion was shit and underpowered like 2 weeks ago? Whats changed?
---
Haha, I realise myself that this would never make it as an official gamemode, but Team Fortress 2 has community servers that have x10 weapon stats and it isn't balanced at all, but it's hella fun.
---
If you think hag you’re actually brain dead
---
I’d say spirit is more powerful, I have much better luck with her
---
Omg I’m sooooo frustrated with dc’s lately. 
---
Lobby dodge obvious SWF groups and DC if it’s a particularly toxic SWF group that wasn’t obvious from the lobby.
---
Rank doesn’t matter for killers; arguably higher ranks are bad for killers, so it’s better to DC and derank. Even better, queue times are practically non-existent for killers and longer for survivors, so you’ll be back in a game long before the toxic survivors will.
---
You’re in control of whether the game actually happens when you’re killer. You’re not forced to play with the toxic survivors, so don’t play with them if they’re making the game unfun for you.
---
Pig for Oinks and Saw.
---
Spirit for a better killer.
---
Seems like Pig it is.
---
Hey stuntman 
---
Wait what?
---
The issue I have with it is that the RNG comes in at the most crucial time. It will only proc once and if it doesn't you die. If you make it guaranteed then it turns into decisive strike and if it's a percentage then it makes the survivor angry that the perk did jack shit when it doesn't come up. If it were for some other mechanic (like hook escapes) then it'd be fine since it's not something that you'll die for if RNG failes you.
---
You also have to consider how niche a situation like that is. Since it's only for moris, devour hope 5, and rancor.
---
Basically (sorry if I haven't explained myself well up to this point) it'll piss one side off no matter what if it's part of the perk, unless there was some other special condition to it, such as having a previous survivor killed by hand in the match.
---
Something like: Watching your allies fall to the killer gives you even more determination to fight. If a survivor has already been killed at the hands of the killer and the killer starts killing you by hand, once the animation starts, receive a tremendously difficult skillcheck. If successful, the killer is stunned for 3/3.5/4 seconds and you're brought back to the injured status.
---
If they have such a bad connection, send small DDoS until the match disconnects problem solved. 
---
*Joking*
---
Haha I'm pretty sure you are the saltiest one here. 
---
I got downed in a NOED massacre and was just crawling through the exit gates when the Legion spotted me, so I started spinning awaiting to accept my death. He didn't pick me up and made signs for me to get out. I didn't do it because I knew what he was going to do. He kept insisting so I kept crawling and he grabs me, puts me on a hook and proceeds to repeteadly stab me. I knew he was going to do that.
---
Let’s talk 
---
Nurse requires muscle memory, Legion does not.
---
Legion needs to know when to use his/her frenzy at the best moment.
---
God I wish there was an Eric Andre sub :(
---
Sometimes I do watch games that were exciting though because I want to know if the others can make it out
---
Cause survivors have it so easy they can multitask while playing.
---
Kidding, probably cause you can have teammates and get easier points and there are more funny moments. 
---
Difficult to tell because of people saying “play hag optimally and she’s friggin strong”, but based on what I see and know Spirit is higher especially considering add ons.
---
How much are they?
---
Was this at Anime Los Angeles? I was there! I’d love to get one :O
---
In a raw setting Spirit. But I've seen better Hags than Spirits. Also survivors know better how to counter Spirit since she's more common. Hag is definitely top tier if played well, just not too many people mastered her. So I would go with Spirit.
---
Yeah just some random thought when i saw your post, and I mean, Brawl is my favorite content-wise, but people who play meta knight? Yikes
---
Back before I really got a grip on what I was doing as a killer, a Nea flashlight blinded me at every single pallet for no reason other than just because she could. This was also when the blind screen was the pure white screen, by the way.
---
Yeah that sounds better. I'll replace the chance part with that, thanks!
---
This is similar to when you’re about to hop into the hatch and they refuse to hit you because they want to grab you as soon as you jump. Cancer
---
You want it to what? 
---
Uhh, what?
---
Spirit by far.
---
Hell yeah, I was waiting for more Entity Education
---
Banning common reposts like this when? 
---
Let's talk.
---
If the survivor knows they are getting out via hatch then they turn into trolls.
---
Looks like a problem with your connection. I'm getting games just fine.
---
Okay time to redo the Saw class...
---
The doll is named Billy the puppet
---
John Kramer is called Jigsaw/the jigsaw killer becasue he cuts Jigsaw pieces out of those who fail his test.
---
So Jigsaw=John and Billy=The puppet.
---
In the original Nightmare on Elmstreet films, it was implied he was a child molester. In the remakes, he straight up is a child molester and I think that’s why he was killed (correct me if I’m wrong). 
---
So yep, Freddy’s a pedo. He also kills them though. 
---
But she keeps hitting me with hatchets
---
The 2010 remake of Nightmare on Elm Street which this Freddy is based on is a confirmed pedophile. They do tinker with the idea of it being ambiguous at first, but then confirm it when Quinten finds pictures proving Freddy did it under his bed in The Black Box, one of Freddy’s ultra rare add-ons.
---
I just always assume the killer will want that 4k. Hatch standoffs are on the devs, not survivors or killers.
---
I mean, the Nurse can just blink the hell out of there and wait for everyone else to kill themselves. If someone survives, she'll be right back with her bonesaw!
---
Hmm.. maybe. We live in Norway, if that has anything to say for the connections right now. 
---
I’ve never experienced this before, so I just had to ask here. :P
---
It's looks funny, when an injured survivor drops a pallet while getting hit. "Excuse me, I'll just drop this and then I'll lie down, no worries"
---
But sometimes the distance is ridiculous. 
---
What’s so bad about a p3 Claudette, is it just she’s harder to see or? I’ve seen her mentioned a lot on reddit but never known why.
---
If you are purposely using Sloppy Butcher because you know it's bugged and causes performance issues for the survivors effected, that's abuse of a bug. 
---
:)
---
People learned how to abuse chase mechanics and turns out you can down people with 0 counterplay. 
---
I don't get it.
---
Oh crap, I intended to delete the post and I only deleted the picture, my apologies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ahqv15/oh\_no\_sorry\_about\_the\_shitty\_format/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ahqv15/oh_no_sorry_about_the_shitty_format/) 
---
Yea well sitting on the ground for 4 minutes isn't exactly what most would consider "fun". I want to play dead by daylight, not "Slug Simulator". Slugging is just a general dick move.
---
50 Shades of Leatherface
---
Thank you Bubba, very cool!
---
We all know legion is broken rn. Don’t have to change your mind from the majority lol. 
---
Yeah, it’s basically just another crutch. She literally disappears into tall grass or any corner. There’s probably complications online of how difficult she is to see, especially on the darker maps.
---
Sliding into them dm’s and mindgaming.
---
doeeeeit!
---
All these words and I stopped at “aimbot”.
---
While I dislike NOED, it is completely preventable. There’s more than 1 perk to counter it, and prevent it from ever appearing.
---
DS has no counter. At all. There is no way to avoid being affected by the perk, unless the survivor is boosted.
---
NOED is only annoying when you personally cleanse 4 dulls and NOED still kills you. But that’s because your team is trash, and not the killer.
---
Is their relationship in the lore of the game?
---
she already has a tiddy out, i think we can deal with her in a bikini
---
Guess people just really don't like legion. 
---
Is it just me or does her hair look like a blue version of Nea's new hair?
---
"She's a super ghost!" 
---
Mike Meyers is the only one confirmed to be canonically unkillable. 
---
Spirit. She's pretty much the second best killer in the game.
---
Basically we happen to be both waiting for the hatch and messaged the killer to kill me by body blocking me and watched me die in the hook.
---
I love playing with Leader and Prove Thyself. Just finding teammates and shredding gens.
---
haHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Ahh ok thanks for the info, makes sense tbh. 
---
Spirit. The only killer better than her is nurse. Hag does get a nice blue ribbon for really annoying.
---
Very cool! Props to whomever made it!!
---
That Jake outfit always makes me laugh so freaking hard. He looks so derpy.
---
And then you find them hiding in a locker. lmao
---
You’re the obsession from everyone in the entire game
---
How do you 1v1 in dbd... 
---
You do know ping can change right? Ping can start at 100 or less then go up to 300 when match starts 
---
Pissing myself laughing?
---
People really need to learn to calm down, i get flamed almost everytime i play killer. And i'd like to think i play pretty regularly.
---
Prequel meme it is left to be, yess
---
Spirits a hell of a lot more common than nurse and billy and cuntress are both more common than her. 
---
Since always.
---
Don’t attempt to wiggle off the hook
---
This is funny but not accurate at all. It should be a magicarp flopping around on the ground and the skeptical black kid meme or something 
---
You’re just bad then😂
---
Playing Legion on PTB and getting no kills: "omg this killer is weaker than Freddy devs plz buff"
---
Playing against Legion on regular servers and losing because you're a fucking scrub: "omg this killer is overpo- no, wait, let's say Not Fun to Play Against, devs plz nerf"
---
Might wanna block his name. 
---
So I don’t have that much nurse experience but I was under the impression her blink only moved her forward a few feet. The second blink makes sense cus of gravity and what not but how the fuck did you pull off the first one
---
It actually has about double the upvotes now. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
If you DC whenever you face a specific killer, than it's it you that needs to be deleted, you trash rank 15.
---
Oh shit yeah, I remember when I first started I did that thinking it would work.
---
Then you shouldn’t be a rank 1 killer
---
"All these words and I stopped reading at" ds has no counter. 
---
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. 😂 You have the option of letting them bleed out, you have the option of using devour hope and mori'ing them on the spot, you have the option to dribble them to the hook and you have the option to ignore them entirely if it bothers you that much to chase someone for 4 more seconds.
---
Wiggling gives you bloodpoints too, I’ve gotten an 8k before after i wiggled out twice with boil over 
---
You don’t escape from good killers without them making a mistake. Juking doesn’t change this lmao.
---
Billy could not ever be a killer because the devs themselves they will not make any killers non-humanoid or anything that differs too far from the basic slate they use when creating killers.
---
It doesn't matter that Amanda died in the movies, the Entity's realm isn't set in a realistic world. 
---
It's even worse when you burn an arguably Survivor unfriendly map offering like the Game and you are the one who stumbles up on HG thinking it's Ruin while the Killer is already in a chase.
---
Meanwhile my adrenaline worked like this:
---
Gets downed by Leatherface - &gt; Last gen pops and so does the adrenaline right next to the Leatherface-&gt; Immediately gets smacked by his hammer. Hello entity my old friend. 
---
Please don't do this shit. This is even more toxic to do. Especially since you just force these people to que again wich in turn makes SWF groups appear more often
---
\*GIVE ME WHAT I REALLY WANT, FEEBLE MORTALS, AND I SHALL LET YOU FEAST AND LIVE\*
---
I think you can on KYF
---
Devour hope- lol
---
Dribbling still wastes time (up to 20 seconds) and 1 bodyblock while dribbling means they wiggle off.
---
Leaving then on the ground is a waste of points and unfun.
---
If you think DS only adds 4 seconds to your game as killer, then I don’t think we can continue this conversation.
---
Are you talking about Marth? Because ardetha and zubatlel are just as good
---
You won’t really escape from a good killer without either them choosing to leave or you actually escaping from the match. Your best bet is just loop them for as long as you can and if you see an opportunity to sneak away go for it but be wary as it’s very likely they will find you again.
---
I mean... the killer is always gonna win
---
Shorter game means less time dealing with the less-fun killer though, and then you can get into another game faster where you will hopefully not have less fun.
---
And yes i know the puppet isn't named jigsaw
---
Nurse takes a lot more finesse though
---
It only adds 4 seconds to my games as killer. Should I be sorry that you're bad at playing killer? 
---
Sprinting away for 2 seconds and hiding behind a tree counters this like 90% of the time
---
Really well done guide. Even as surv you can learn alot from the video. 
---
Q U I N T O N N E V E R G E T S B A N N E D
---
The longer you hold down M2 the farther you blink forward, gravity doesnt affect how far the nurse can blink
---
I mean I just dont see how it would be fun (at least for killers) because there's no scenario a killer would even get a kill. All you need is DS or Boil Over x10 and you'll never get hooked. It'd be damn hard to even get a hit with exhaustion perks giving you a 1500% speed increase for 30 seconds...
---
4 second stun is not the same as a 4 second chase. Therefore it only adds 4 seconds to the chase. Are you always this dense or do you always need pictograms to explain things to you?
---
Get good.
---
I love making people DC because they missed their DS. I just smack something near me after counting to 3. It works 2/3 times 
---
This thread is comparing about NOED, where you openly admit to not being able to count to 5. I think I’m ok :)
---
Is this game free-to-play this weekend? Just saw it on r/gaming
---
Survivor is easier to play and a lot of Streamers have an ego (due to having so many fuccboi followers) that they get off on trolling as Survivor. 
---
sorry to hear that! 😕 hope you still had some good matches with him 
---
The lore of the game covers this issue you have. 
---
Yes it was
---
Just pay the postage 
---
In about 3 hours it doubled. I’m really surprised 
---
It's more about gaining time for my team than losing him.
---
It's always fun for me to talk with someone who has the ability to process information at the same rate as grass grows. Guess you'll just be horrible at playing killer and then blame ds for your inabilities to learn, overcome and adapt to new situations. It's no one else's fault but your own if you're unable to take control of loops and end them before 1 gen pops yet alone 3. Sounds a whole lot like a you problem. Stay dense. 😉
---
Yamcha is the butt of all good dragonball jokes
---
I mean...I'm not gonna run the risk of someone escaping and being able to heal them or their fellow survivors. I'm not some stupid 80's action movie villain. I wanna be effective.
---
I had my probably most irritating match against a hillbilly who put me on a hook after I cleansed the ruin totem and nodded, spun around and chainsawed me until I was dead. during that time 3 gens got done and everyone escaped - but maybe he just had a bad day.
---
Lmao, I just wanted to shitpost. I didn’t mean to divide the subreddit in half 😂 sorry mods
---
Oh geez

This post took 8 days to hit top of all time. Good job!

You can hear Running In The 90's in the background
---
I'm sensing you don't have an argument to make here so your smear by false association attempt is pretty much all you've got. 
---
Thanks for trying. /s
---
There's nothing to talk about. There never was the second you laid claim to ds being stronger or even comparable to noed. 😂
---
Instead of crying that it takes too long to down survivors maybe you could benefit a little from this video someone here just posted. But judging from your past posts here you're still going to be thick in the head instead of getting good and say it takes 3 gens worth of time to down a single person. You're the type of person that would slam their hand in a door and then blame the door for being there.
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ
---
Legion can run backwards at you after hitting you a couple times, meaning he can follow you with little problem, while your mend timer goes down. So you either mend, which means he hits you no problem, or he can chase you til he gets close enough to hit you or you die because you didn't mend. He's more OP on an individual basis, in that he's as inescapable as the best nurses, but take basically no skill since their ability literally gives them massive move speed and no cd on swings.
---
But that’s pretty unfair to survivors. Hatch standoffs suck but they equally suck for both sides. I don’t think one side should get helped in it. I don’t know how to fix it though. 
---
I've said this before, but since these are fictional characters it depends on who is writing the scenario.
---
While certain Killers probably have better chances than others (Michael comes back from death, Remake Freddy survived getting his throat slit, Leatherface and ~~Leatherface~~ Hillbilly have freaking chainsaws, Huntress has canonically killed entire platoons of heavily armed German infantry single-handedly, and the Spirit is a corpse held together by evil magic) we just don't know how Killers powers would interact with each other (Does Michael Myers dream? If Leatherface pulled Freddy into the real world and diced him REAL GOOD would he still come back? If Huntress cleft Spirit's skull in half with a hatchet would she die or just look really gross?)
---
Besides, the circumstances of the battle would make all the difference. I, or anyone else, could write a feasible scenario in which Mandy kills everyone (despite being tiny and making adorable noises when she gets hurt).
---
*except and that's called rage-quitting, congrats!
---
Well, at least they acknowledged she wasn’t in the killer category. That’s the first step to recovery, acknowledging the problem. 
---
You can buy original characters with Iridescent Shards that you get over time from playing. But you’ll have to pay real money for the licensed DLC characters. (Freddy + Quentin, Tapp + Pig, Laurie + Mike, Leatherface).
---
If you don’t plan on buying one of the licensed DLCs for a while, if you see a perk in the Shrine of Secrets that you want, then grab it. Otherwise hold onto all your Iri shards and spend them on character unlocks until you have all the characters unlocked.
---
The only way to consistently play against your friend is to do KYF, but you won’t be rewarded Blood Points or Iridescent Shards for it, and you have to invite people to join. You guys can randomly get matched against each other in normal games, but it’s probably less likely to happen until you guys hit higher ranks.
---
The only thing I'm salty about is people getting salty for stupid reasons
---
What platform?
---
Legion does have it super easy. Nurse requires a ton of skill and practice and you can still sometimes juke her. Legion if he wants to hit you he will hit you. Slap on Franklin’s Tape and Thanatophobia with Bloodhound and a toxic 3 gen patrolling Legion, you have zero chance for more than 1 person to escape. And they’ll do so via hatch. 
---
It’s a bad killer unless you decide to be toxic and use the right perks and then it becomes the strongest. 
---
I’m okay with how long it takes to pick up/place a trap. My problem is how embarrassingly often I walk to my own traps 🤦🏽‍♀️
---
Try playing her without addons to learn the range of her blinks a little bit. If you really insist on using addons, just use fatigue-reduction, or blink movement speed, just something that isn’t an extra blink or increased blinking distance.
---
Also if a survivor runs back at your for your first blink, you can fake blink into the ground in front of/underneath you and possibly get a hit off. Depends on how close they are when you do this, though.
---
Maybe they should put Legion the Surv category.

No?
---
Yeah, sadly it’s just not that simple. 
---
You could try to spread some tracks in one direction and then walk back and hide when the killers breaking a pallet or something and then continue going the other direction but if they catch on it’s kinda useless.
---
In the current meta hiding and escaping chases just aren’t reliable or even really possible against good killers.
---
Both are both shitty to play against, Legion is just worse because Nurse actually requires some skill/thought to it while Legion takes no skill to do well with.  
---
i dont believe wiggling gives you bloodpoints, wiggling out i think does, but what non rank 20 killer lets someone wiggle out
---
Tha k you for answers. It sux for me i guess. The most interesting characters are the ones from the movies. Well maybe one day...
---
Nah I don't think anyone would've said you should've DC'ed, in my estimation, usually when the game goes bad like that people either complain in the lobby or they just move on to the next game quickly.
---
Dying Light: Your obsession has 500% increased altruistic action speed. When the obsession is killed, all survivors suffer from a 250% penalty to repairs, healing, and sabotaging.  
---
Sole Survivor: Every time a survivor is sacrificed or killed, your aura cannot be read within a range of 240 meters by the killer.   
---
Up the Ante: For each remaining survivor, all other survivors get a 300% increase to luck. (304% chance to kobe let's go)  
---
Hex: Ruin: Good Skill Checks cause a 50% regression. Great Skill Checks cause no progress boost. (slow the game down a lot more than a little bit)
---
:’( the decency

oh my godh dwodge look out the killer is comeingg oh god oh f*ck
---
Jeepers creepers
---
Are they some kind of nod to Vigo or something from the lore? If so that’s pretty cool.
---
Only seen them on Springwood, Haddonfield and Yamaoka Estate so far!
---
Oh my god she’d look amazing with a long hair. Amazing job! 💕
---
LMAO
---
Yea i know. Even with the sale is a lot for my budget. Anyway thank you !
---
same i have to close my game with task manager or its 3/2v1 whenever i bring escape cake, pudding or BPS. Idk maybe im just very unlucky 
---
No problem! You can also do manual records-- here's a helpful article that explains it a bit more: https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-record-gameplay-on-a-ps4/
---
A good thing to keep in mind is if you hit the share button and exit out of the menu without saving the video clip, you'll lose everything that was recorded up til that point and it will start recording from scratch. I've done that a few times accidentally and it sucks losing something you wish you had saved. Just a warning so you don't do the same! 
---
Coulda gone right, mighta never seen it...
---
I'm dumb nvm
---
Candyman would be neat.
---
Or little Sam, from Trick R Treat. Would certainly play from an interesting perspective for killers 
---
About 30~40 depent in how you do it.
---
Cap is 1 mill tho, so Do it now.
---
depends on the starting point of leveling and what you end up taking in the bloodweb, if starting at 1 then i’d guess up to 25-27
---
hum myers wansnt created by bvhr
---
She's so cute!!! :D
---
Dr. Sartain was the character.
---
Bruce Willy survivor perk
---
Its not supposed to be. Right now its unfair for killer. A survivor can suck ass the whole game but as long as they are close enough to the hatch they get it gauranteed. 
---
Its stupid that I can kill every other survivor *and* find the hatch before the last survivor can and they still get away. 
---
Without a doubt NOT the weakest power of the killers, considering other killers have powers that require you to WAIT a time before you can even hit a survivor. If you think that you are clueless.
---
nay unless you hold someone hostage camp
---
Ghostface from Scream.
---
I would personally love to see someone like Norman Bates, maybe having the survivor look, like the 
---
Legion. 
---
Your budget is $5?
---
They can’t get away if you don’t let them. If you’re at the hatch the only reason they get the hatch would be because you let them. And what about the survivors who don’t suck ass the whole game? A killer can suck as the entire game but get one kill because of Noed or Rancor. The current hatch standoff sucks for both sides. 
---
I'm good. Right now I'm buck naked BUT I do have a glock shoved up my ass.
---
FD can be essential depending on the survivors you go up against. 
---
If you see a SWF all with toolboxes, you better equip FD or else the gens will be gone faster than you know it. 
---
There we go, someone was saying leader and prove thyself would be OP, but unless they hit great skill checks...
---
Hurr durr the other side doesnt have reason 
---
When I play killer and the game is held hostage I’m just like “this is why I don’t play killer” 😂
---
Rotate the stick, don't go back and forth.
---
I rather have scorpion and do a get over here to survivors at the gates
---
I played a couple of games as killer and got coldwind one time too many, cause I'm sporting a cool headache now. 
---
only things i consider toxic is the shit people say in post game chat, ive seen very hurtful and mean things to me and others :( sandbagging is toxic also
---
I’m not entirely sure what for tbh
---
I don’t know a ton of the lore for dbd lol
---
PS4 editor has pretty cool stickers
---
Nurse mains were abused as kids
---
Classic nea. 
---
Honestly?
---
Fuck Legion.
---
[https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player\_Level](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level)
---
you might want to look at this, while its true that there's no real advantage to hitting 100, its not a significant negative either because the xp to iridescent shard ratio is still pretty similar. also it doesn't take longer to level the second time
---
Imagine having to wait for BBQ n Chilli in the shrine of secrets....

People can't really accuse you of camping if they're hook-diving hardcore. Especially if it's like, more than half the team doing it. 
---
I dunno, people are dumb sometimes.
---
I always found Wraith’s pallet stun screech quite terrifying. He sounds demonic
---
So you guys have convinced yourselves that losing to legion means not only that the killer is broken but that the killers who use legion are shitty.
---
Fucking hilarious. 
---
Did she seriously...? What was she *thinking*?
---
I would love to have more gens like that, for example a discoteque that when you turn a gen under the stage the music starts playing (like l4d2 concert) or stuff like that. Also the tvs at the hospital should turn on after you do the gens just at the part of the screams
---
You're the typical player who never plays the other side. 
---
You seem like the killer I want to go up against when I want to watch every hook-farming, sand-bagging piece of ass this game has and me die, Thank you.

---
Nurse is mostly about practice and muscle memory. 
---
First off, don't be afraid of the addons that "decrease accuracy". As far as I and anyone else can tell, it actually doesn't do anything. 
---
Next you probably want to be consistent with your addons, and not change them around too much. Pick a load out you are comfortable with and stick with it so your muscle memory doesn't get messed up. I prefer the green addon that increases range and +1 blink. Yeah people will rage at you for that extra blink but you might need it against anyone that knows what they are doing. When you are blinking for distance, flick your mouse up slightly to increase the range to its maximum. 
---
Alright, now for actual gameplay. If you have 3 blinks, try not to use the third blink until you absolutely need to. Make them think you only have two. That way when you use the third they won't expect it and you will definitely get the hit. You want to keep blinking from generator to generator. Only use one blink for this, as the stun time is pretty short. Remember that your base movement is slower than survivors. You can't just run them down. Always go for the blink, even if they are right in front of you. When you chase survivors try to avoid teleporting in a straight line directly behind them. It's super easy to dodge you this way. Use the first blink to go slightly to the left or right, and if you can't hit then use the second blink to correct and come at them from a more perpendicular angle. 
---
You can "fake" a blink by blinking at the ground. This is useful for survivors that like to change direction when you blink, or if they are jumping from one side of the pallet to another. They'll just run right into you. Beware of any floors below you though. 
---
Maps with good line of sight, like Asylum and The Game are your best. Maps with poor line of sight like Lery's or the Swamp are your worst. 
---
Lastly, get good at trash talking because your post game chat is always going to be super toxic.
---
My recommended perk load out is Ruin, BBQ, Nurse's Calling, and either Monitor and Abuse or Make Your Choice. 
---
Posted earlier but figured I'm a newbie for reddit use and only had a link. Figure this makes it more attractive. xD
---
I was talking about the colour did you made the game to change perks to their designs
---
Chucky lol
---
Don't forget to tag as shitpost
---
I wish i knew that guy
---
Didn't expect to see competitive Smash stuff in my DBD but yes, that comparison is apt.
---
The other Dwight is having some thoughts on the situation
---
Gotcha. Regardless of there being no xp difference, it's still a completely pointless system. I just hit my first devotion level and was really disappointed to see my iridescent shard gain dropped back down to 50. The system is pointless was the main point of this post.
---
I had a Kate get stuck in a tree last week. I felt sorry for her, because she wasn't great at chasing. I downed her and let her go because that was something I had hoped the killer had done with me when I got stuck in a tree some time ago when playing survivor. 
---
But I agree; there are definitely reasons to DC without being toxic. The one stated by OP is not one of them, though..
---
Every time I get into a lobby my Meg is always T-posing on bitches 
---
Fair enough 
---
They’re usually sitting around the map, like in family residence there’s one sitting under the main building, on haddonfield it’s beside a picnic table etc
---
Lmao you just stole my meme and changed the image
---
We were at Springwood, and I had just solo finished the third generator when our second teammate was hooked for the last time. Time to get serious, it's just you (blue haired Feng) and me, with two generators left to do. We got this.
---
Leatherface began to patrol between the last four generators. No worries, I've been here before. We can whittle these bad boys down, and if we play our cards right and work together, we can both get out of this alive.
---
I bounced back and forth between a few of them, assuming you were doing the same. That's when I saw you: blue pigtails, white mask, hiding behind the bushes near the edge of the map. I ran over to try to coordinate which generator to take care of, when you urban evaded over to the middle of the street, and proceeded to t-bag on the hatch. Cool, good to know, now let's finish this game!
---
Wrong. You walked back to your warm spot behind the bushes. You pointed at nothing, then looked at the bush. 
---
We were faced with two options:
---
1. Sit here, hiding, till Leatherface disconnects and we lose all our BP, 
---
2. Play the game, and attempt to complete the objectives.  
---
I hopped on a generator and completed about a 25% before LF's loop brought him to me. Slinking from gen to gen, I ended up progressing them a tiny bit, hoping that it would keep him occupied long enough for you to make some progress. 
---
Wrong. You stayed behind the bushes. While hopping from gen to gen, I could always find your little blue pigtails, moving around just enough to keep the crows away, always behind the bushes, as near as possible to the hatch. 
---
I ran to the farthest generator, made some noise, then snuck back to a generator I had decided to focus on. Without any help, it took a few trips, but I got it done. Each trip, there you were; blue pigtails, white mask, behind the bush.
---
One more generator to complete. Three generators to choose from. Leatherface was checking gens like clockwork now; Generator 1, Generator 2, Generator 3, repeat. I didn't even need to look behind me anymore, because he was always coming from one direction. 
---
*10% done.*
---
*20% done.*
---
*Leatherface, switch generators while he searches for a bit and damages that generator, repeat.*
---
***Blue hair.***
---
***White mask.***
---
**Bushes.**
---
Our game passed the 30 minute mark. I got impatient. I got sloppy. Leatherface saw me, and hooked me for the first time, in the middle of the map.
---
There you were. Bushes. Leatherface decided that he would run circles around me instead of search for you. I don't blame him, for any part of his game, except that he never thought to look behind the bushes, away from any of the generators. After my entire hook timer was up, I saw you move from your hidey-hole toward your long awaited prize. 
---
I play both killer and survivor, but I only play about 25% of my killer games seriously. I enjoy letting survivors go, messing around with them, or just playing games without focusing on getting the 4k. When I do play seriously, I refuse to camp or tunnel, and if I happen to run into the same survivor three times in a row, I won't hook them till I've hooked someone else. 
---
But because of you, I will never, *ever,* let a blue haired Feng live. All "toxic" behavior, all logical reasoning is now priority #2 if I ever see that *damn* mask, and those *damn* blue pigtails while I have a weapon in my hand. To all blue haired Feng's out there, you must die for the sins of your sister. 
---
^^^^I ^^^^will ^^^^also ^^^^be ^^^^burning ^^^^all ^^^^bushes ^^^^I ^^^^see ^^^^in ^^^^real ^^^^life ^^^^from ^^^^this ^^^^moment ^^^^forward. 
---
yeah happens to me quite often, i get around it by starting a swf and solo queuing from there. as for killer no problems for me so far
---
Thanks mate. It would be interesting if you could use them haha.
---
I wonder if it's anything to do with the event soon?
---
Obligatory explanation: In this bloodweb I have to choose between the perks "Left Behind" And "No One Left Behind".
---
Why would a killer dc on the game?
---
In fact, let's take it several steps further!  
---
Hex: Huntress Lullaby: Survivors receive a 20%/40%/60% progression penalty for missing a Skill Check. Each survivor hooked decreases the warning time by 200%. (so it'll work like it does at 5 stacks when it's only at 1 stack)  
---
Thanatophobia:  
---
1 Survivor: -60%  
---
2 Survivors: -90%  
---
3 Survivors: -120%  
---
4 Survivors: -150%  
---
A Nurse's Calling: See survivors healing and/or being healed within a 280 meter range.  
---
Stridor: Injured Survivors are 500% louder. Healthy survivors are 250% louder.  
---
Tinkerer: When a generator reaches 85%, your Terror Radius disappears for 120 seconds and you receive a noise notification.
---
Also nurse has some counter play just not usually with pallets you can bait going round corners and double back to avoid the attack
---
It's mainly bc they cant give the attention to their chat when they are playing killer. You'll find more killer game play on YouTube 
---
Immanuel kant's critique of pure reason isn't a moral polemic?
---
&gt; If you’re at the hatch the only reason they get the hatch would be because you let them.
---
You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Do you even play killer? 
---
If you are at hatch, and they show up, then you have to wait for them to jump in and catch them. If you hit them then they will jump in and you won't be able to catch them since your attack will be on cool down. You can even put them in the dying state and they will *still* be able to hop to their feet and into the hatch. And even if you do catch them, if they have Decisive Strike then they will stun you and easily get the hatch. 
---
NOED can be countered by cleansing totems. And lol who even complains about Rancor? It's not even a good perk dude. 
---
The hatch mechanics are completely one sided. The *only* chance that the killer has at getting the last survivor with the hatch in play is to put them in the dying state far away from the hatch. To suggest that the hatch is bad for both tells me you either don't know what you are talking about, or you are straight up lying. 
---
Yes because I am a killer main victim and I am bullied relentlessly by OP survivors &gt;:^(
---
I just disable messages/chat, what they have to say doesn’t really matter
---
In my opinion, it can be a bad map from both sides
---
Freddy darns no longer
---
I feel bad when this happens because I have 0 interest in farming but I don’t want you guys to waste your streamers either
