Mission failed successfully.
---
Just an empty room nothing in it but 5 gens 5 totems, 7 hooks and, not a cellphone just 5 players living in the moment.
---
I honestly don't know. Maybe? If it did it wasn't hugely noticible.
---
The idea is, he's supposed to be good at eberytbing, but great at nothing. He's got decent map control, decent attacks, and decent awareness, but none of it is as extreme as the peeps who specialize.
---
I'm drunk at the moment, maybe I drank too much during struggle phase, or maybe I just went out with my friends. Who knows
---
Because she's one of the most (if not the most) popular Survivor and the stereotypical Claudette player isn't that bright until they're P3.  In which case they're usually cocky.
---
Good thing more challenges are coming before the rift closes...
---
ok
---
What rank killer?
---
This clip is brighter than my future
---
happened the exact same to me
---
Did you get shadowbanned or something? I can click your profile and see the reply but I can't actually see it in this post. Anyways I don't care what you think, you are obviously an idiot.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Just suprising with how many hours I've put in.
---
I mean, it will force them to drop a pallet or use window. 
---
Of course some numbers can be changed, but it the general idea: give survivors a moment to react to her new position. Forgot to mention, the are seeing only her husk, so from survivors perspective, she stops for a few seconds and goes in their (or not) direction at an INSANE speed, covering all distance spirit traveled while in sprit world in a few seconds. Going to add this to original post.
---
bUy pReMiUm
---
Sauce?
---
I've gotten more hate mail in this game than any other, 99% from salty Survivor mains.
---
This is something I have to try lol
---
Why is your clown crying
---
This is how I know none of you play red ranks. I have yet to find any survivor or killer in red rank that disagrees the nerf went way too far. There is way too much forgiveness against Nurse now. She went from a killer you can‚Äôt make any mistake against at all to a killer where you can make far too many mistakes and still come out on top.
---
hahahahahahahahah this is so false it's funny
---
Why is this marked NSFW?
---
Actually yes it does. It does a LOT
---
So is the glowing orange stuff magma or some mysterious liquid?
---
no. you got it completely wrong my guy.
---

---
No Mither just causes you to be Broken as if a Plague has you fully Infected. However being Broken and being Infected are two totally different states. If a Plague wanted to Infect a No Mither survivor and gain any benefits that would bring she'd still need to vomit on them, and if a No Mither cleanses at a Fountain they remain Broken, it doesn't heal them and they simply remove the Infection.
---
No. A killer who is purely dedicated to slugging/being an asshole isn't always going to happen. I am not wasting a perk slot because people want to abuse game mechanics.
---
Not sure.  I have [this keyboard](https://www.ebay.com/p/1724649594?iid=264416500676&amp;chn=ps&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-117182-37290-0&amp;mkcid=2&amp;itemid=264416500676&amp;targetid=537215867968&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9029855&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=6470648147&amp;mkgroupid=74956728902&amp;rlsatarget=pla-537215867968&amp;abcId=1139336&amp;merchantid=113600634&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzIyi-6je5QIVj8VkCh3xhQ_4EAQYASABEgLGN_D_BwE).

Whenever I build a new computer, I keep using the old peripherals.  My three-year-old machine, with an i7 6700k, GTX 1080, and 32GB DDR4-3200, is powering my 1600x900 monitor.
---
It really depends on your teams play style. Don't cleanse, and she one-shot downs you if she finds/catches you. 
---
But, cleanse, and her puke does damage, and gives her range, making it much easier to hit you, even if she does have to do it twice.
---
Badically, if you're good at outrunning/mind gaming/ looping, than don't cleanse. It makes it easier for her to hit you.
---
If you duck at those three things, you should cleanse because you're probably gonna get hit anyways.
---
Whoever downvoted this just hops onto the bandwagon
---
20
---
Tell us then, its so easy to say that and not suggest anything that would fit the games lore, be balanced, be fun to play, be appealing to everyone, actually possible to get into the game ect...
---
They aren't if the killer knows how to turn his camera; with both visual and audio cues before they go off, anyone aside from people brand new to the game can easily avoid it.
---
I salute you
---
You have to remember that 4 other people queued for a good 5-10 mins to get into a game just for it to end by people like you. I don't DC because it isn't fair on the other 4 people. Even if I get camped, or tunneled or survivors bring insta heals or bnps I stay so they get something out of that match
---
Google ‚ÄúAutohotkey‚Äù and one of the most popular scripts available for it is an autoclicker/autotapper. Don‚Äôt need to write it yourself, though you can if so inclined. Bind it to an f key or like O and then you‚Äôll forget to turn it on and feel real dumb when you die.
---
Alternatively: "How the fuck did that not hit them?"
---
I got to actually see myself on some random guy's little stream a week or so ago where I was basically repeatedly failing to make lunges that looked like they should've landed and barely missed at best.  On his end I was apparently lunging from a mile away and never got close to him.
---
Then there's the times where Survivors are able to like, magically snap and change the direction they're running in without warning as if the server only recorded like a fraction of their movements.
---
Then what really makes me salty is when I use Dead Hard, get Exhausted, and yet the server decided that I was hit before I used it.
---
David and shirt off.
---
The game just glitched it means nothing
---
TFW you play spirit and still almost don‚Äôt 4K ü•¥
---
I would much, much rather have weaker killers buffed. Spirit isn‚Äôt highly played because she‚Äôs amazing, it‚Äôs because in perspective, she‚Äôs so much better than half of the roster. A good spirit can still get gen rushed and have 4 escape by a SWF.
---
Gnarly. First time it ever hit me. I had seen speed hacking videos and it looked remarkably similar.
---
I'll be on the lookout for it in the future.
---
People don¬¥t like mending and team mates that heal every time they get hit can screw the rest of the party, kinda like plague cleansing. That¬¥s what the person who sd¬¥d on hook told me though so  ü§∑
---
Buying tiers is not overpriced you must be new to the whole BP thing. $1 per tier is the norm, some games charge more
---
Hell yes man, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be done so fast!
---
agreed. frank best boy
---
Let's all DC together
---
I knew that The Plague would have to vomit on them to infect him, I just thought a No Mither user couldn't cleanse at the fountain, but thanks for the answer. :)
---
If they were to do this, they should do it if a console player wants to play with a pc player, they are automatically put on pc servers. It should not be the other way round, that would just put a pc player, who has an immediate advantage against console players. This would work.This is how Fortnite did it before forced cross play with skill based matchmaking.
---
Nice congrats! So tips for red ranks wraith? ;)
---
But aren't the Halloween syringes going away soon??
---
Perfect example of a "TACTICAL DISCONNECT" taking a fairly earned 4K away from a killer. DC Husks when?
---
Nurse. Was nurse she has no counter. The best way to learn how to counter spirit is to play her. At this point I survive against spirits 90% of the time because you can think "what would I do?"
---
Exactly. He even made his own concept and everything. He didn't copy/paste the other dudes.
---
People who claim people are thieves without legit proof... Are just idiots. Having the same idea and being a thief =/= the same thing.
---
Am I the only person who's nearly blind playing this game? There's some official reason on the wiki, but they're basically just weird, annoying, and hard to program for.
---
Spine Chill has its uses, especially now with the stealth killers update, and against prayer beads spirit (or even normal spirit) is really strong
---
NoED has its uses with weaker killers or with certain builds, although I don‚Äôt run it much so idk. It is annoying to go against, but it‚Äôs easy to counter (I have a new-found love for Detective‚Äôs Haunch) and not that common
---
I may be pressed because I run Spine Chill a lot, but telling people how to play the game ‚Äúaccurately‚Äù seems like a bit of an elitist thing to say. Unless they aware actively causing grief in others (facecamp before EGC, flashlight clicking, teabagging as killer or survivor, etc) let people play how they choose
---
If everyone runs op meta the game grows boring and stale, imo
---
*NO NUT NOVEMBER INTENSIFIES*
---
Infectious fright so you get most out off tier 3.
---
**Preach** sis
---
Color me in love
---
IIRC they started coming out during their first Christmas event? They were pretty common and folks were stacking them up quite a bit, so BHVR then upped the rarity and made them harder to get.  So now I'm lucky if I see one while I'm leveling a Survivor/Killer up to 40 for their teachables.
---
Congrats dude
---
I have a mouse with a button to "unlock" the scroll wheel. So I bound Struggle to Mouse-Up, and I just flick it periodically.
---
I wish you guys would stop giving these guys attention. Block them and move on. They‚Äôll start to wonder why their killer queues start taking 30 minutes to an hour and they‚Äôll fucking quit it.
---
What an alpha male all of us should aspire to be just like this man
---
Because 'bloodpoint economy' or whatever.  Same reason they were wanting to stop doing double bloodpoint events.
---
Well, I only have splinters, so my Myers build is having no perks and losing terribly.
---
THE BIG DADDY! HELL YES
---
I think normal replay that could also do top down would be good
---
Playing Plague or Legion, mostly.
---
They weren‚Äôt saying it was bad that she got nerfed. They were just saying that she got nerfed.
---
\#3, I guess. Personally, I really like FF and wouldn't want to completely lose it. But if I had to choose between FF and, you know, *actually being a Legion* that can summon other gang members to surround Survivors, carry them to hooks, guard gens, etc... That'd be way cooler. Hopefully they find a way to add gang summons without completely removing FF.
---
He was worth using before the rework (Bottom-Tier my ass. BEST IN CLASS stall, stealth, and tracking only hindered by a 7 second wait which can be worked around by constantly juggling and switching targets.) and he's definitely worth using post-rework as he now has strong chase potential and high mobility. He no longer has his godly stall and tracking though. Definitely one of the best M1 killers in DBD.
---
Can you turn up your screen brightness? At lower levels I can't see anything.
---
It's because there's a gay alternative
---
Using Feral Frenzy while standing still deactivates Insidious so I assume phasing would also cancel it.
---
Nurse isn‚Äôt that bad. She‚Äôs just...annoying to play.
---
It was a nerf
---
Again. Just my guess
---
I had that idea, but then I realized I can just not play Wraith.
---
Fun variant: 3K and invis on the hatch.
---
We don‚Äôt do that here
---
It was for experimentation to figure out a safe dosage according to the archives.
---
i main adam for his sweet denim jeans and jacket
---
Oh I know. I was going for sarcasm.
---
Although, when you see the first "gg ez" there's little reason to stay in post-game chat. Just move along.
---
There's a "known issue" in the current patch that allows you to rotate killers in Custom Game.
---
In a perfect world I'd want him to be DBD's first "CO-OP Killer". Up to four Legion members can be in the match and the more Legions, the slower and weaker they are, making them have to work together to herd survivors into each other.
---
Sadly there is no way to win xp faster,Im gonna explain :
---
Every second spend in a game : 1xp
---
Max at 10 minutes (600xp)
---
You can earn extra xp because of the medals but its like 18xp so whatever lol
---
"Painreliever deadbydaylight" he did a video explain it about xp if you wanna watch it
---
I haven't owned anyone slated for oblivion before (never enjoyed Nurse), but I'm playing Spirit until we see what the nerf actually is.
---
And knowing BHVR, never again after.
---
Not as good as Omega Blink.
---
In other situations, I could be mad, but to be honest the other player was clearly inexperienced, and I might have just given him the hatch anyway, and this one ran me around quite well(was my second or third spirit game)
---
Because he's bad :(
---
I revert back to what I said, whatever definition you have for it, be it salty or a survivor main, it is fine. We all have our opinions and at the end of the day the only ones who can make decisions is solely ourselves. If you feel good about not dcing for other people that‚Äôs great. My real life is centered around helping people my career as a nurse says a lot for me so, if Dcing In a video game is not really going to do much damage to my person believe me lol I‚Äôm sure dcing in a video gane is not going to tarnish my being. I‚Äôm sure your a great person, but I will continue to do what is best for me, and one of them is not investing so much Into a video game. You don‚Äôt need to play if your not enjoying yourself for the well of others, it‚Äôs a video game for sakes lol.
---
From what I understood the serums will last until the rift ends?  It's just the petal offerings and special hooks/generators that go away soon (the offerings will be locked from use).
---
‚ÄúCalculating...‚Äù
---
Ah cheers! It really has been a while since I've seen or personally played as her, sadly.
---
#I NOTICED
---
Nice one
---
For Legion, I'd say remove the current kit and make something new, like a puppet character. Maybe something like Identity V's Dream Witch.
---
But, as they should with Old Freddy, keep the old kit on-hand and work on it in the background for a new Original Killer. If it's behind the scenes, there'll be no pressure to rush it.
---
Pig doesn't, but she has a face.
---
Was still dumb on outdoor maps, [darkest](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/thumb/7/7c/NewMoonBouquetEffects.jpg/1200px-NewMoonBouquetEffects.jpg?version=44adde18d6275bd4ed63ae24a632c194) imagine a blendette on that vs the [bright](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/thumb/e/e7/FullMoonBouquetEffects.jpg/1200px-FullMoonBouquetEffects.jpg?version=693f4fcffe9e3d9ade0a36f2108b6fd7)
---
No. You can hover over them and it lasts 2 weeks after the rift ends.
---
Honestly how I expected legion to be with the lockers down to the T, still upset that isn‚Äôt the case, you know how much more money they‚Äôd get if you could theoretically run all four cosmetics in one game?
---
Oh my god... I thought the graphics on switch were bad.
---
Oh damn. I may have to install my Xbox version then until the PC servers get brushed up

My bad I meant to put ultra rare, I mixed up my rarities. I‚Äôll edit it, thanks
---
Ive started throwing pallets early to time it to the server delay......... Sorry about the vacuum.
---
Literally just play.
---
oh
---
I had this, apart from when they dc'd it ended  so you got it even worse than i did
---
Gladly. Thank you.
---
I *despise* No Mither. 
---
Personal experience is that it's almost always run by dipshits who have no clue how to run a killer or do a goddamn gen.
---
Tbh this is quite a specific case, but yeah usually intentional DC's aren't a good thing, and the why it's still not punished and accepted by the devs is a mystery to me
---
No Nerf
---
What the heck is a Fortnite
---
Lol
---
Her add ons got buffed, half of them is usable now, they removed omegablink and 4/5 blink though (which is good)
---
Boosted because you can't hit greats 100% of the time?
---
What if it caused exhaustion? That would make sense if someone is sick and puking. Just at her current state she isn't that great.
---
Yep, I noticed this a lot. I've been playing survivor casually but very often in an SWF with a few buddies who are new or otherwise not that great, and even in games where we get rolled it seems impossible to de-pip as surv.
---
Moris for the most part are fine imo, I just feel that the ebony specifically should take 2 hooks, that way it kinda forces the killer to earn more points and not just tunnel people down and have a better chance at piping.
---
Red ranks I see more games without ruin then with tbh.
---
Don't hide in lockers if you don't want to go on hook

[removed]
---
I played lot of games and got only 1 lvl
---
Complete the challenges, and then just grind games. It's 8k exp per level of the rift, which works out to be around 16 games (assuming an average of 500 exp per game). 
---
Basically if you can average 16 per day you'll guarantee getting it cleared, or alternatively focus challenges to get 10-15 levels worth of progress.
---
Too many on both sides.
---
*deathcore feels*
---
You can't really moonwalk on console because you have a joystick so when you alternate between left and right you hit forward as well. Instead of just pressing the two keys.
---
In my experience, if I play poorly I get a ‚Äúgg‚Äù or something similar. If I play well I get ‚Äútry hard‚Äù or some type of insult.
---
I've literally only used NM for the David King trophy/achievement and the This Is Not Happening challenge recently. 
---
I kind of get the appeal situationally (it's basically just a hard buff against an instadown killer like IH Huntress of Plague), but it's way too situational for me.
---
About 50x better then anything I could ever draw üòÇ
---
Hey that‚Äôs my profile pic!
---
I feel like TINH would only work in a broken build with No Mither and other perks that give you buffs in injured state.
---
For real.
---
Then you didn't play "a lot of games"
---
Okay. Do challenges and play the game. That's all you can do.
---
I'll just down the saver. The person who got unhooked doesn't deserve to go down. Think for a second. The guy who was on the hook has to now spend time on the ground on top of spending time on the hook.
---
Your friend may run OOO. Or your friend was just playing against a god tier huntress that follow there scratch marks, heard them make noise or predicted right. 
---
Or they cheated or it‚Äôs a bug even I haven‚Äôt heard of.
---
If your friend when to the same place the huntress found her before then obviously the huntress May go back there. Survivors tend to go back to the gens they where on despite killer knowing they where there.
---
Emojis
---
Before it gets locked, it's the 13th, so this coming Wednesday. 
---
Please try to search for info like this before posting. Not only has this been asked many times already, but the information is actually in the in-game news section.
---
Already completed all of them
---
Yeah... sorry about the dead hard bug, too.
---
Cool idea, I think the parole power seems a little op though! Perhaps it could be that he gets just the speed boost and for 5 seconds instead. Hell you could have the killer equivalent of a sprint burst 2 " when the executioner sees a survivor within 32 metres he runs at 150 % speed for 5 seconds but afterwards suffers from a a decreased movement speed of 110%" or something similar.
---
Pallet town sounds interesting, perhaps he could use his axe to break them the same speed as brutal strength? 
---
Hide and seek could be useful, perhaps that could be a killer perk instead of a power for executioner?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think that blood sacrifice has limited value as you usually know where the killer is at the time of the survivors death  but it could definitely help if the survivor bleeds out or the killer is away from the hook when they die. Fairly balanced I think.
---
I think hunted sounds like a really good perk, very situational but very good. However I either make it a higher % chance or make it 100% chance but for 2 extra seconds.
---
I really like the idea of this executioner killer with the mask and a big axe  who is essentially acting as a kind of prison warden for the entity! A castle map would be cool.
---
Same. I hate getting Surv challenges when I play mainly killer.
---
K, that's cool.
---
F
---
*CLAP* *CLAP* *CLAP*
---
I was with my friend on that match. I can confirm the killer was on her ALL the time even if she was hiding somewhere
---
Np, I just come here for the lighthearted memes between matches. Just thought I'd submit something I found amusing.
---
The trapper is based on him right?
---
If you look at her model, her glass shards actually glow slightly to indicate she is phasing
---
Agreed
---
you have my attention
---
Yeah, that shit is hard at high ranks.
---
Buying tiers as a whole is expensive yes but if you want to buy a tier or two to immediately get a cosmetic it‚Äôs more worth because you‚Äôre paying probably half price or less.
---
I don‚Äôt want to buy her just for that. :/
---
Sometimes I play killer, and survivors I‚Äôm chasing will run to the hooked player 85% of the time. Those are the type of people I make sure don‚Äôt survive the game.
---
But I shall. Have a good night.
---
Kind of a dumb question but was your friend running OoO?
---
Uh, no. She's already top tier,  dafuq?
---
&gt;Also letting survivors know when she‚Äôs phasing is so dumb, they always know when she‚Äôs coming and can react accordingly, prayer beads should be in her default power.
---
This is the dumbest, most op change I've ever heard for any killer ever. Just get better at her, noob.
---
&gt;doubt the devs will do it as they only care about survivors
---
You're an aspiring comedian, I see.
---
Tbh, no. Killers have splinters because their powers can be previewed, perks don't matter and in most cases are worthless unless you get a synergy build with them
---
Fair enough
---
Dear God why did I even click that...
---
Sabotuer is a relic of when sabotoging was actually useful since it perma destroyed hooks.
---
Puke on a survivor until he's broken, down him, hook him, find the next survivor with BBQ, repeat, kinda. If they cleanse, you can get your corrupt purge and end chases almost instantly.
---
Ok, thanks
---
its BLEEDING smh
---
You as well :)
---
tbf 10~ games per level is alot of games. thats 3 hours with an average 15 minute gametime.
---
No she wasnt. She wasnt even running around the map. Just using Urban Evasion and try to did some gen and unhooked the other players. But the Huntress didnt have any perk apart from Barbeque. But like I said it wasnt active when the killer found her
---
I am on Xbox, have had that every now and again. :/
---
I see nothing wrong here it's how the game gives xp
---
In fortnite you previously got 5/10 battle stars as a daily mission, and in dbd 3 isnt a lot and we wont be flying through the rift
---
I didn‚Äôt play when that was a thing, but it sounds like a nightmare. I‚Äôd love nice buffs to the weaker killers and perks, would greatly help variety.
---
Using a offering to play as a Level 1 perkless Survivor.
---
I mean if you want to why not, they're 90% skin anyways.
---
&gt;you cant blind him if he blinds you first.
---
very good point
---
Spamming space bar with toes cause you're taking a drink? [Do you drink like trump?](https://giphy.com/gifs/water-donald-trump-press-conference-26u45x8ao72LJBnsk)
---
Imagine making an addition to something that's obviously incorrect to further prove a point.
---
Same
---
Im bad at hands....
---
Just want to say this goes both ways, a lot of killers typically will thrash a survivor main in DM because they looped, blinded or stunned them as if those aren‚Äôt things we NEED to do in order to survive. I get the point of this post, this reddit is just hecka one sided.
---
Another funny Wraith build I love is with add-ons: use 'The ghost' soot and 'the beast' soot, I call it Reverse Stealth Bing Bong, TR is heard while cloaked, but suppressed for 6 seconds when you uncloak, really confuses survs the first couple times (at ranks 13-16 where I'm at at least), even got 2 gen grabs in one match because of it
---
Exactly, and it goes both ways. Killers shouldn't 4ks every game as well
---
The game is meant to be fun, get some points, have some scares and move on. Competition is good but not if it brings about negativity
---
Nerf myer
---
No I meant so it is a preview of that survivor with their perks. Since they don't have a power they could be with their perks for that round ig
---
GET OUT! AND STOP MAKING ALT ACCOUNTS JUST TO EVADE MY BLOCKS.
---
Jake is my fav!
---
but when is page 2 of the rift to be released though?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
It could be a combination of several factors, The Huntress catching a glimpse of her as she crouches around the map, a sound that tipped her off, predictable hiding spots, any number of things can tell you exactly where a survivor is, and experienced killers typically don‚Äôt have trouble locating survivors trying to hide, even just a survivors breathing can give you away if the killer has a decent headset, not to mention that whispers ready gives her a good idea of where to start looking
---
Please, don't stress to much about, only grind if you're having fun too. Also, the next batch of challenges comes on Tuesday, so we will be able to level it up faster soon
---
You go into a custom game and switch to killer, and you can rotate them as you can while in the menus.
---
I agree. I was in a match the other day with a Feng who had NM against a Clown, and she just kept getting hit after running the killer maybe 10 feet. No surprise that she died first.
---
?? Flashlights have all had the same blind time since like 2017
---
Lmao i love this
---
Yeah not rational adult thinking that went through society. She's not a child, dumbass she literally murders anyone who comes close to the cabin. No child would do that.
---
I am amused that this person with the most non optimal killer play style still manages to get 4ks because survivors must keep throwing themselves at the camped hook instead of punishing the killer by ignoring the hooked person and escaping.
---
They did state in the last Dev stream that she will be getting some changes - https://clips.twitch.tv/SoftArbitraryBobaLitFam
---
congrats! but dont you think wraith is the #1 best killer? he's literally #1 on my list of most deadly killers (playing on ps4) and ignore the Xs and Os thats a note for myself for which ones i currently have survivor pudding for

bad idea is a bad idea
---
im asking him to do dat cause I like the his art style
---
Read them and stop asking reddit
---
What a pretty woman
---
It's extremely constant for me so it's frustrating, and I'm hard wired averaging over 200 mbps download speeds while playing so I know it's not bad connection.
---
I never played old Freddy but I main him as he is now and find him fun to play and also strong enough to be viable at lower ranks.
---
Which leaves portals in farther off areas, thereby keeping map pressure
---
Don't forget the two first matches of the day giving 600 exp which drop it from 16 games to 14.8 (going on 500 exp every match)
---
Honestly the only reason the game is so competitive and toxic is because everyone is forced into ranked. 
---
At red ranks you get this stupid mix of causal players that are just good at the game and people that really play to win. It‚Äôs neither sides fault. Forced ranking just makes for a toxic experience.
---
I do the same as Alittar and go for both. I usually just assume they have borrowed time and go for the smack so they have to waste time mending. If they don't have borrowed and go down sucks for them but at least they aren't getting put back on the hook, regardless of if I think they have DS or not. Red rank killer is hard af, there's no room for empathy when you are trying to maintain pressure.
---
Well I dont really know if the killer had good hearing or better view. All I can tell the Huntress went STRAIGHT to her like I said if my friend would be visible or something. I was running around the map like an idiot but the Killer didnt paid attention to me. Even when I did some unhooking nothing. Didnt came for me. Straight to my friend who was crouching on the other side of the map. Oh and it was Coldwind Farm. So it makes harder to detect anybody.
---
It doesn‚Äôt take that long, it still allows you to do many things I mentioned, also don‚Äôt use it in the open where they‚Äôre able to go left or right. Either tap it to make them avoid vaulting or commit to it when you know they‚Äôre gonna vault or drop the pallet, or maybe when they‚Äôre going between trees or something
---
Imagine thinking that killers being able to walk around unsafe pallets means pallets are useless
---
i respect your opinion but &gt;:(
---
I played it. Gosh darn the graphics. Also the trapper was op. His traps literally suck you into them lmao.
---
Also wanna level killers or survivors? To get em teachable perks?
---
Well you gotta keep on playing that character until level 40. No BP, you gotta get exp for the characters as well. It was honestly annoying.
---
There is a bloodmarket which mixes ALL unlocked killers/survivors' add ons and items. So yeah you will see trapper's bags alongside wraith's mud. No way to just get add ons for that one character.
---
And the only free killers are the Trapper and Billy.
---
Sounds like a dream game.
---
It's what she deserved.
---
Pg 13 DBD just google it
---
Ah fuck, I always loved those tier lists haha, some were spot on and some would make me scratch my head, but either way they usually led to some good debates.
---
Thanks for your comments and I pretty much agree entirely, I just wanted to see your thoughts and get caught up on all the changes that I missed.
---
Corrupt can actually be countered , pallet camp near a wall where you can‚Äôt be exactly seen then stun -Poof -her corrupt is gone . I do get it is hard when she randomly finds you . 
---
I think her power is overall counterable since she is really huge and can be seen in almost every loop even when injured . I don‚Äôt get the whine when she has thanatatopia on , do the gen than whining why they are slow .
---
He definitely did a fast vault, go back and watch it again
---
i know i cant see my large chrome cloak as ghostface but ill be DAMNED if i dont wear it because it looks cool as fuck, whether i see it or not
---
Yea right now I only have a cypress (yellow) for her so I have to destroy the survivors to even use it
---
&gt;Before it gets locked, it's the 13th, so this coming Wednesday.
---
They literally told you when.
---
Trust me I get there‚Äôs a small group of people that slug to be jerks but there‚Äôs people that do it strategically too whether it‚Äôs waiting out DS, multiple people being in the area or perks like Infectious Fright or Surge that give you intel on people around. It‚Äôs not a bad idea to run it you‚Äôll use it more often than you think.
---
Lol. No
---
He's using an analogy with wild animals to justify fucking a 6 year old D:
---
I don‚Äôt know man, it‚Äôs hard for me to give you a definitive answer here as to whether or not it was bullshit, since an experienced killer using superior game sense to find a less experienced survivor is just as likely, if not more likely, than it just being a hacker. This would be much easier to determine if you had clipped the match
---
Nah, I  have better things to do with my.. ok
---
ive always wanted to see h2o's mask with the new cosmetics but nobody has it except like, mclean and h2o himself
---
I didnt record it tho :/ Wish I did. Anyway thanks for the guess
---
Removed please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Come on bro you would have at least had fooled some people if you didn't include the last bit
---
Yeah, and then it asks you to hit them. So not only do we have to mark them, not only do we have to lean mark them, we have to hit them while they are aware of their markdness, and will be extra cautious.
---

---
Trash yesüëç
---
Ya but when is the second page of the rift coming out?
---
I cant recomend blendwr enough! Once you get goung uts so easy. Tons of youtube tutorials and help vids
---
I agree. If she could go through pallets and windows and see survivors she would be THE broken killer. People already complain about her being op. If the devs added that buff then it would become a scramble of hate mail. Already people are hating spirit. Spirit doesnt need more hate.
---
Imagine a map where you have to swim across short distances to reach the generators and exit gates, and the killer can hide in the waters and swim after you. As a survivor, all you hear is some splashing behind you or maybe you see the water moving differently behind you, but as the killer you see their legs frantically kicking as they try to swim away.
---
I was in the exact same boat, I saved up BP from my survivor games and Iridescent shards and prayed to RNJesus for the Shrine of Secrets while I leveled killers I never even played.
---
Yes, I mean descend as in 'increasing' from 20-15-10 etc.
---
I personally don't see this game as a win/loss system. Not exactly suiting for the grindy asymmetrical gameplay. More than that though, playing for fun is always better than playing to win.
---
Of course you may simply be immune to the killer's allure. That's fine, play how you want and more power to you. Understand however, fortune favors the prey whom understands his predators hunting methods.
---
Dwight is probably in that locker waiting with Head On
---
It‚Äôs not supposed to reveal your aura if it doesn‚Äôt reveal the killers. If it does, then that‚Äôs a bug.
---
Nvm I just went against a Wraith with some sonic speed. We escaped tho but this game man...
---
Its something else
---
having a p3 legion stare into your soul is not an experience i would recommend so continue at your own risk
---
Yeah something like he killed of a submarine and then drowned after would be creepy but cool
---
r/woooosh
---
LOL @ all of these people defending the face camper who purposely disconnects to wreck newer players &amp; low ranks.
---
camping is not a legitimate strategy
---
no way to be at lvl 2 with all challenges completed
---
This is a really good breakdown for a change. Usually I just see people complaining but their arguments boil down to "I should have won cause the gates got powered but I got one shot instead". 
---
It's kinda funny cause you never see someone complain about EWIII Mikey even though he can do the exact same thing. Hell Mikey can actually control when he can and can't one hit yet I've never really seen someone complain about it like people do NOED. I played a game not too long ago as survivor against a Mikey where we got the gates powered and he ended up getting 3 of us (myself being one) because he apparently had been sitting his EW right at the edge of getting III and just popped it when he saw someone at the gate. Obviously that could still be countered but not nearly as easily as popping totems.
---
And for Adrenaline yeah anybody with a brain should be able to see that it's basically just an insurance perk. Useless until one situation pops and then it just gives you a good buff. There's also the fact that it triggers when the gates are *powered,* not actually opened. So if you're good enough you can absolutely still down them again, if not them plus others.
---
If you havent seen it look up the vashta nerada thats what I would imagine they'd look like
---
They look like gear pieces.
---
Pretty sure portals in farther off areas is the opposite of map pressure, since you cannot keep placing them like freddy, once they are down if the gen is completed its a dead zone.
---
But t-bagging is?
---
Only got two lvls only playing two hours
---
It's a set of cogs/gears, representing the generators that need fixing.
---
I would agree to the opinion, that it's not a very good symbol.
---
SKin for the demogorgon to be the monsters from the scooby doo movie
---
You're using that wrong. This isn't a joke, satire or sarcasm, this is either trolling or idiocy.
---
What do you think would be a better symbol?
---
Why does everyone like these hallow's eve lunchboxes? They give away where you are.
---
wow, i main doctor but i never rlly thought there was a problem w him but that might be bc i usually play against green/purple ranks, but you make some rlly good ppints
---
two full tier levels in two hours thats pretty fucking fast my dude
---
Grats man let is know how you like it.
---
I hit rank 1 without knowing I did and I quickly learned it was so toxic.
---
No matter what play I did I always got grief messaged after every match.
---
Ive had to dumb down my gameplay just so I can stay in yellow and have some fun.
---
The Entity is about the discover the Higgs Boson.
---
Maybe they interlock to represent how survivors need to work together as a team to win.
---
Nancy smells.
---
Did it download some files? if so that's good. Did you try playing it? if it still not working, contact them via email support here:  [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us)
---
I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the demogorgon if so no. 
---
Or if feng is just flipping her hair to the side.
---
I would like to see it as well.
---
Disagree. Camping as a viable strategy is situational.
---
You can also check the forums out [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/technical-issues](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/technical-issues)
---
Amazing counterpoint. Instead of arguing my point, you try and insult me. Nice one. Why are you so insistent that she's 6 years old? You don't stop aging after you lose contact with human civilization. You're a fucking dumbass if you think that's true.  I'm not attracted to the huntress either, I'm just pissed off that idiots like you are pretending to know how human psychology works when you clearly don't.
---
Wraiths= Predator rip off essentially.
---
was it really necessary to record ***15 minutes of it***
---
It's the gorgon
---
I like play with your food, save the best for last, ruin because he can be very slow to get going, and bbq for map knowledge. 
---
I've been trying bloodwarden for late game because I get quite a lot of hooks as by then I'll be in EW3 or close. NOED would synergise but I don't find michael needs it.
---
no one wants her nerfed, just changed so i actually get feedback and counterplay when going against her. Stop with the us vs them mentality.
---
Wait.. Really??!?
---
I like to imagine she saw you, she just didn't wanna attack Nancy. You kept running into her red stain and she immediately flicked away, like "damn it Nancy I'm trying not to kill you stay out of my way"
---
A figure running with a toolbox? Or just a figure running? Someone running...
---
Running
---
Congratulations. I did it with Doctor about 2 months after I bought the game. I will never do it again. I took a screen shoot and use it as my profile background for PS4. It was hell. Seemed like in the red ranks it was 50% good no mistake survivors or 50% BM toxic assholes. I did it just before the fixed the pallet vacs. Lol. Never again. PC guys had to deal with Nurse so I think they had it worse. If PC guys came over to PS4 or Xbox they would laugh at how easy it would be because no nurses. The toxicity was so crazy. I would get messages after every game. I saved them to remind my self to nope the fuck out of red ranks. On a side note I used NC with Doctor back then. He could see you trying to snap out of tier 3. Once they nerfed that I have a hell of a time getting him past green ranks. I'm glad I did it. Proud gaming moment. Also a lesson learned.
---
They're all good and yeah, I dropped Monitor as soon as undetectable rolled out for mikey.
---
I feel like the altruism symbol could be good too
---
Oh, little one. How much you have yet to learn.
---
Weird, it was only 5 seconds on my phone.
---
Unless you're in the kitchen, then you're the killer
---
should've applied more pressure tbh
---
*Aw shit, here we go again*
---
Honestly I will buy every version of the game possible when I can. Shit's my OoO
---
Maybe some walls and stuff could be highlighted for the killer who can do a dead hard style lunge right through them? That's the best scare Mr X gives me in re2.
---
hey uh, I have several questions about that hitbox ü§î
---
It would have killed them due to backlash and hypocrisy due to them saying they wouldn‚Äôt do that.
---
I always feel bad for survivors when I hit them on at the end of the vaulting animation
---
I just use it for my Sabo/Flip Flop build which performs much better than people would expect.
---
Ah right I keep forgetting about this, then it's possible to get blinded no matter what
---
How do you start out at 20 or even 9? Mine started at 1 lol.
---
Ok then add a charm in every couple of tiers. You can't tell me they take a lot of time or resources to make, most of them are basic as hell.
---
I get those to for some reason when I know I‚Äôm far enough away I still get stunned like what?
---
removal idk
---
I rendered one pretty quick, but the scale was off. When i went to do some stuff (i remember adding pistons) thats when i realized it would be better to just start from scratch... so all in, id have to say about 2 months/40ish hours. The pictured model probably has about 25 hours of rendering. Took 3 prints as well, and each of those were 8-10 hours
---
www.TheBible.com
---
It's been a few days since a dbd meme made me laugh, take my upvote
---
I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt agree with you I‚Äôm just talking about the last part. 
---
I think they should give more then what they give and have more non basic cosmetics. Hell I don‚Äôt think they should even have the rift because it takes more time and resources away from fixing things like bugs or weak things.
---
Toxic trash
---
Like what ?
---
But money lol. Meh I was just scrolling through it and noticed how empty it was and wanted to bitch.
---
From your comments it‚Äôs obvious you‚Äôve never played as the spirit, please only ask for changes when your familiar with both sides.
---
yes and im comparing it to being a dead power if you fuck up the placements. Why would you teleport to no objectives are?
---
The map could be a large sunken submarine, or a sunken cruise ship.
---
No but it still helps with 2 and 3
---
Lol yep I agree.
---
Thanks ! Boop
---
r/engrish
---
It just glitched out for some.
---
Where's Jeff, ash, Jane, Steve, and nancy
---
True. If survivors are being super toxic, you have the option to camp them. But it‚Äôs the scummy killers who do it to everyone .
---
You call r/dbdgonegay?
---
Absolut mood
---
It depends on what kind of angle you'd be. How wide? 90 degrees? 120?
---
Because the ranking system is HORRIBLE and the devs are too proud of themselves to fix it.
---
A hero in --death-- disconnect
---
Remember, it's only alternative variations, not replacements
---
I think even if Feral Frenzy was powerful they should give it to someone who isn't Legion. Their power turns them into an animalistic murderer bent on catching by their prey, but yeah that doesn't have like anything to do with their story. Their story and gimmick is that it's 4 people, one killer, so why not have the power actually reflect that somehow?
---
Kurt Angle
---
Enough about Myers, lets discuss an underwater killer üòé
---
lmao that is so cute of you. üñ§
---
I literally takes nothing away from bugs.
---
‚ù§
---
He wasn't that bad if he played fair, but if he exploited it was horrible. You get hit and fall in next 20 seconds no matter what you do unless you have insta.
---
Then the title should be Alternative Mori Animations not New Mori Animations which sounds like replacing Moris for other ones. 
---
Which I‚Äôm down with it just like how they did it in for honor.
---
I‚Äôd love to kill you but I‚Äôd have to wait in queue for 15 minutes
---
69
---
 Killing survivors is my objective and if I have evenly spread out portals, then I can better keep at that task if they decide to run away and regroup
---
This made my day, I can't stop laughing at this.
---
Exactly :D
---
I really really want the dual charm but I know I won‚Äôt make it, so I‚Äôve accepted that and it hurts
---
I had a game with ruin as my only hex perk. I was playing against a streamer, and after going back and watching his stream after the game ended, he found the Ruin almost immediately, but he was too afraid to cleanse it because I was playing spirit and he was afraid of Haunted Grounds. They completed 2 gens before I got that 4k. Haunted Grounds makes survivors mind game themselves
---
I don‚Äôt want to prestige my Steve because of the offerings
---
It's a free-to-play game, makes sense for devs to make it more grindy so it encourages you to buy some AC.
---
Also, I don't quite get why people are complaining about the graphics. I tried the game as well, it's laggy enough already.
---
Oh okay. Sadly, I cannot change the title, so it remains how it is.
---
üò≥
---
If you run Monitor you'll get even more value
---
It‚Äôs the opposite of GGEZ it‚Äôs a sincere GG
---
It‚Äôs not about fun it‚Äôs about winning fun doesn‚Äôt exist the only thing that matters is the 4k
---
Yet I do this and the complete opposite happens. I dont really care anymore
---
He is certainly not the best at all imo. A good spirit, nurse (yes even after the rework), or billy will show you what‚Äôs what. I just think he‚Äôs super fun to play.
---
It‚Äôs a hoot for sure.
---
What if the glass was cracked and there was no light coming out.
---
Sounds like a way someone with a small peepee and a sad life would play
---
It's fucking sick that people will literally defend face camping.
---
That would be great, and the exit gate is that covered bridge rt?
---
I mean, I feel for you. This game can be super frustrating but if you‚Äôre not being hyperbolic I think it is better for your health to stop playing. No judgement.
---
What do you mean by this is there a penalty for doing it?
---
I like this one, but I also like the suit he had in the 2nd one as well.
---
Yeah when tome 2 comes out. Everyone needs to read the full thing. You can earn them til the 13th, you have time to spend them until 2 weeks after the rift ends.
---
(Õ†‚âñ Õú ñÕ†‚âñ)
---
I've had my eye on Blender for a while, but I was concerned it was more about renders than 3D modeling. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
I was debating on it, so yeah probably
---
Nah, I was a billy boy
---
If you kill the third you have no control over whether the 4th finds the hatch first, and if you kick the hatch you have no control over the gate spawn and can potentially get screwed by that too. What you're asking is for killers to pull punches on their opponents, stop trying for max score, and end games prematurely and at a disadvantage despite winning.
---
It is absurd. It's just you struggle to realize how absurd it sounds until I mirror it by suggesting maybe the loser should pull punches, stop trying for max score, and end the game prematurely with a disadvantage. The difference is the 4th is losing and is the 3rd's teammate so in a way it makes even more sense that the survivor suicide out of courtesy to the 3rd. But still, I agree, what you're saying is absurd because the reality is the majority of 4th survivors care a lot more about sweating for their hatch than the 3rd's 4 minutes just like the majority of killers care a lot more about their last kill.
---
I've experienced as a killer getting a grab animation only for it to be cancelled.
---
I'm also experienced as a survivor getting grab off a gen after letting go or the gen completing.
---
Sounds pretty rough but congrats to you as well man. I didn‚Äôt realize they made it where you couldn‚Äôt see people snapping out of it with NC. That‚Äôs like the main reason I ever ran it on doc (and it‚Äôs just good). Can safely say that I haven‚Äôt versed many nurses, but the ones I did were either god awful or made me want to uninstall my existence.
---
It‚Äôs because they‚Äôd have to get it approved, which takes time. They‚Äôd have to render it, and ngl it would only be effective on a couple of maps. People probably wouldn‚Äôt like it
---
Honestly it's because too many impatient people who need to be hitting a button completely ruin it
---
Right after the first one I would be like" okay sorry i go now bye!!"
---
Did you win? "ez ur trash lol"
---
Did you lose? Still fucking bullshit
---
When has this ever been the case? In all of my matches, waving arms has meant they want to be helped whilst all the other team members aren‚Äôt bothering to assist them at all. It‚Äôs a cry for someone to assist to someone that‚Äôs nearby. 
---
I do it too, usually when the first half of my hook timer is nearly depleted and I‚Äôm about to enter struggle phase, I spam it to try and get someone‚Äôs attention that I seriously need to be de-hooked. Not once have I encountered a waving arms that has lead to a Camped Killer near the hook, I mean it‚Äôs an interesting idea to utilise to warn players of a camped Killer.
---
Ok
---
Yeah probably.
---
For trapper, I feel that he is a basic killer with a basic mori, but they could have just had the trapper put down a trap and smash a survivors head into it to really bump it up.
---
Pennywise is basically a god, the demogorgon is an animal
---
Big brain moment
---
Thanks man, I can understand staying low like that. I haven‚Äôt actually had just a bunch of toxicity myself but I know it can get bad. Frankly I kind of enjoy getting hate messages cause I would just try to be nonsensical and stupid just to make them more mad, always cracks me up. It also kind of made me feel that I did such a good job that it warranted a hate message.
---
rude
---
Dear god please don't let that be her nerf. It could be nerfing beads and adding a vault animation, making her light up more brightly when phasing, or removing phase collision. Please god not Nurse's horrible stun after every single skill use
---
And a question - when you undervolted, is it possible you disabled the CPU boost? I know some people do that along with undervolting. Or maybe you accidentally disabled it? The i5 8300h goes from base 2.3 Ghz to 4 Ghz boosted, so that could explain some stutters if it couldn't boost.
---
Well there's no one else on how right so he's screwed.
---
That's a dying method of conveying that particular message. Nowadays most players I encounter spam the unhook action when the killer has left them. That's how I do it, too. It makes more sense.
---
It's because they're fixing gens
---
Wow. Absolutely stunning. Mama huntress graduated from Bunny to full out cougar &lt;3
---
PC. Sometimes after a game, I just get infinite loading and have to close DbD with Task Manager.
---
Mouse wheel hold down macro noises
---
It'd be cool in game but God want an ugly costume (and not in the good way) I can't imagine it sells well during October
---
my school uses those
---
Check out sculpting. I took a cylinder and made the tires with that once i watched a great youtube vid on it. Also, search for what you want. I needed to cyt a hole in a mesh and found a vid that showed 8 ways to cut a hole in a mesh lol
---
I tried throwing a pallet on him but instead of a 6 second stun he beat me
---
Ash.
---
Its partially true though.
---
thanks for the tip, i'm gonna try it and see how it goes
---
You're here though so what's up?
---
With old Legion maybe, new legion is a joke lol, literally no reason to DC on them. Back when you could moonwalk them down and do an infinite mend it was definite dc heaven, now i see dcs on spirit, or plague
---
That sounds like a *groovy* idea
---
It's been that way from the start or close to the start. You can search this sub and see older posts saying the same.
---
Friendly pig gets multiple snoot boops.
---
Play Survivor normally. The only thing that gives you XP is game time, except for 300 XP a day for your first time as each side. However, game time XP drops off after 10 minutes, so you want to be a Survivor, who'll often die or escape before then.
---
If you're playing against a Bubba who does not have: the Carburetor Tuning Guide, Primer Bulb, Grease, or Beast's Marks, expect face camping.
---
I‚Äôm going to cry in the shower RIGHT NOW
---
Congrats. Throw a party, pop open the champagne, commit a murder, party time!
---
Are you sure it is dying or that with the influx of new players it's just being assumed?
---
I feel like that‚Äôs definitely on him. Haunted Grounds is scarier to survivors than it should be. Especially if you already know that there‚Äôs a hex perk (already seen the ruin or something) there isn‚Äôt really a downside to cleansing it. If you‚Äôre still really worried, wait until the killer injures someone, then immediately cleanse, so that they‚Äôre either forced to switch targets or lose massive duration on it.
---
The true lore of the clown
---
Pretty sure it's dying.
---
I know its gears but I always just see a cute little face.
---
why are you commenting on a 70 day old post tho
---
That has nothing to do with what I was saying lol.
---
Like White Noise 2? Yeah, it was fun there.
---
me i‚Äôm not even bragging, i‚Äôm just saying that people that smurf are just getting more boring games
---
The community is full of casual players on console due to 20+ minute queues. People will get two matches in an hour and this is the shit that exists every match to every other match.

Seeing your username, I don‚Äôt think I want to

its always my fault

Hes annoying though

Claudette is cursed. It makes decent people into to toxic pudding

Make sure that crawling also slows the bleed out, or otherwise people will be bleeding twice as fast there because you can‚Äôt recover while crawling without Tenacity

So would he hunt us in a motel by the pool? Or in a mansion and do we get shaggy and velma as survivors?
---
If I ever have the choice I chase and hook Adam's first. 99/100 times they have Deliverance and I get a good laugh.
---
What you first should be asking for is a splinter rework, then. I actually made a thread about how inadequate they are today.
---
At least perks are only 2k shards, not 9k like Killers.
---
This is by far the worst problem in the game and must be fixed immediately
---
‚ÄúEntity Displeased‚Äù
---
Yeah me too fucker

Do as much research as you can btw but uhh. If you bought dbd off of steam all the files should be saved into a steam server but you can always back it up into a USB drive.
---
ayeupppp
---
It is, but I'm also questioning the Killer's actions here. Like what exactly are they doing?
---
I‚Äôd buy it
---
cry more
---
Yeah, there are better games. This one's very binary about if you win or lose and has a lot of toxic players.
---
Uhh, well...  
---
You smell!
---
Adding onto that, where's the splinters for Ghostface and Demogorgon lol
---
Feels the same to me.
---
and? straight isn't the default, it's not /r/dbdheterogonewild, just bc there's another sub for it doesn't mean it can't still be posted on the main sub
---
Could always run Rancor and not pop T2 until they've done their first gen.
---
Splinter machine broke.
---
Its the step in the right direction. Their development can now rely on their own servers instead of client machine. Also no more lagswitch. Most of the How the fuck did that hit me (htfdthm) moments are ping related. They just have to fix the non ping related and poof

Franklin's Demise forces permanent loss of item when hit during vault animation.
---
Scoring nearly 75% in every category is a depip though ?
---
I absolutely love this idea, there‚Äôs already an outfit that the trapper has that kinda fits this theme. BHVR give me the water killer
---
Idk but him doing that saved me
---
Well, you can combine Slippery Meat, Up the Ante, and a luck offering to create a discount deliverance that's always worked in my experience (of using it that one time with a green luck offering) so at least Slippery Meat does something in that case. I'd argue it's not the **worst** one.
---
I'm not really cool with the battle pass, but if the money they get from it help them improve the game, then awesome. I just want origin skins for everybody.
---
I didn't realize till after
---
when you're spooky but ready for harvest too
---
Dude it‚Äôs bad. Yesterday a three man all in purple, and I (red rank) went against a Rank 14 freddy with one perk. I felt so bad.... seems like the matchmaking is acting up again. Working as intended I guess...
---
congratulations, that's not easy to do
---
Queue times are already 20+ minutes on console as is.
---
Like the other guy said, him losing his mind after months of underwater work or something and killing everyone on a submarine would be cool. I‚Äôm scared of what kind of map could come of that
---
I agree that salty people suck as someone who plays both sides equally, but if I'm playing survivor and  I get tunneled or my team leaves me to die on first hook even though I'm not being camped, I go full salt mode.   I would never tell someone to kill themselves or something but ooof I always regret it. I think its cause I only play solo and I need someone to vent my anger to.
---
Moonwalking on console is hard to pull off but it happens to me every so often
---
I enjoy the game and get a decent amount of shards but I can‚Äôt get killers because I use so many different perks on every killer and I never have bloodpoints
---
"What the nurse reworks were"
---
"what people think they were"
---
im a Rank 2 freddy and even i find this boring &amp; unfun
---
I mean, im not the one bitching about about downvotes
---
How is straight not default?
---
I think that's normal for this game
---
Idk how I could possibly bring another 30 syringes
---
I have tried that. I dont have a 1080p monitor and it is very faint to be noticable on smaller resolutions. Her shards mostly become noticeable at the last moment before her husk goes out.
---
No. You just need to use the 3 perks and escape. It doesn‚Äôt care about offerings or items
---
Let me know what y'all think, I know they're probably not 100% solid but I'm just spit balling
---
Is there actually a winner here everyone involved is wasting their time including me by reading it
---
Since the ps4 launch and you are only level 81?
---
But Gyro...
---
How the fuck did I hit that? This game sucks
---
...but we take those
---
Try doing that at red ranks
---
I mean.. her base kit is fine as it is. She doesn't need any buff really, just some add on rework
---
Thanks, I try
---
Omg the weeping woman ‚ù§Ô∏èGod I hope one day we get some urban legend characters that would be so cool!
---
ZubatLEL
---
haha forreal. nothing like sitting in queue for 10 minutes for a 2 minute match and a depip. 
---
fun times.
---
Is there a Dwight in there
---
I can't complain about her... Because in a year of playing I have played against her twice
---
Thanks mate
---
Ty
---
Looks like the exit gates are powered? There is no reason to not leave except to be altruistic and no reason for the killer to not camp to secure their only kill in the match. Get over it. You could have all just left.
---
Been playing a long time and I‚Äôve always taken it in two ways: 
---
1) Jumping jacks over and over mean the killer is camping 
---
2) A single jumping jack means that no one is coming
---
Right. Like I would so buy those chapters and cosmetics. I just want more content and more diverse characters cause I feel like the game is lacking that, but I don‚Äôt want to get political.
---
It's not cheese, its counterplay. Everything should have counterplay.
---
Or maybe you are wrong, ever considered that one?
---
Wow! This is worthless!
---
I recommend that you level up Phillip.
---
I'll do that to SWF all day. Most of them are toxic or try to be.
---
neas lips look incredible
---
so is mine
---
I literally just said so few people play her because she is difficult to play. The ones you've played were no doubt new nurse players. There is no reason whatsoever to believe Nurse is bad.
---
Whenever my friends get mori'd i love to teabag the shit out of them and book it as soon as the animation ends lmao
---
‚ÄúBilly is better than Spirit‚Äù üòÇ
---
Implying he isn't lol? Just because he started rotating from survivor and killer does not hide his bias towards killer balance of survivor balance.
---
15 seconds of badassery just to immediately be killed? What if you're too far from the opened exit gate or go to the wrong one? Or what if end game is activated by the killer closing hatch? If that happens no exit gates are opened are u just spoon feed the killer a win. A perk that literally kills you is just bad imo, that'd be like if there was a killer perk that'd have it to where one Survivor would be allowed to live.. it completely contradicts your objective.
---
are you braindead?
---
I just thought it was a cool concept but I don‚Äôt wanna have an argument.
---
Do you watch his streams at all?

Nearly same score, pipped
---
Just now
---
Yea, welcome to the discussion of the real problem
---
You can't be at 7 places at once and they can burn through gens stupidly fast
---
Since the game launched in 2016 it's been "arms flapping" is being camped
---
No it does lack a bit of diverse in characters but I think they do better than some other games and they usually try to give good storylines to characters.
---
Looks like another killer learned not to fuck around until the entity gets its hooks in.
---
No.. if you dc just shows how kiddish you are
---
he's been known in this community for years you brainlet. before ALL he would play was killer and only started playing survivor more when he started rotating builds. He's still a killer main and if you can't see his obvious bias you're either biased yourself or just a fucking idiot
---
I had a similar game with a nurse, it was as if she grab me from the ground and put me on the hook, I could see myself through the perspective of being carried had crows, kinda just waited for the killer to disconnect, wanted to pip I didn‚Äôt want to lose, I played the killer
---
Trapper: Oh? You're approaching me?
---
alternatively, you could make a third action on right click that slows bleeding, and then make it so it‚Äôs only if you‚Äôre doing none of them. that way survivors don‚Äôt have to constantly crawl if they have unbreakable
---
Wait is bubba not on switch?
---
Your opinion is IRRELEVANT ADEPT FREDDY GAMER
---
/s
---
I main killer. Stop assuming because you're mad I have no problem with tbagging.
---
Yeah, I just hope they have more diverse characters and original characters in the future
---
That‚Äôs your opinion, everybody has their own opinion. Again, it‚Äôs the term isn‚Äôt kiddish, it‚Äôs childish. I remember you, the illiterate dude.
---
Yeah and I want one based off of the weindgo.
---
That hurts.
---
Shirtless clown tho

One of the reason i love GF. On the very few times i bring a mori, anyone that poses in the photo has escape privilege if possible

I have felt zero difference, personally. Additionally, rank matching are still fucked and survivor queue times are crazy.
---
Damn thing pulled me from a differnt map
---
I‚Äôm hoping chapter 14 were getting The Teacher that people been speculating about the past couple of weeks and hopefully there diverse whether it‚Äôs the killer or survivor. Or at least whatever is chapter 14 it‚Äôs something cool.
---
When you refuse to learn how to play against a killer so you just bitch, whine and DC until you get your way
---
The weindgo would be cool
---
Not that i can remember, lmao. What timing that was though, i couldnt believe it
---
This is the best DBD meme I've seen in a while!  Well done!
---
Jokes on you. I was bullied (as Doctor) by P3 Claudettes when I first started playing. I learned Nurse and I find her to be a fun killer now. 
---
Little do the toxic players know, they are causing this cycle.
---
Oh, a survivor healed? Here, lose some points. Even tho that was completelly out of your control, sice you also lose points for tunelling
---
Wait what? How?
---
Wow I‚Äôm being downvoted because I‚Äôm stating the truth, I‚Äôve been playing this game since the beginning as well, I‚Äôve only joined this sub-Reddit a few months ago. From everything I‚Äôve observed, nobody in any of my matches has ever done what you say it‚Äôs meant for. It may be the way of things for those who are in the know and in the community but for the general player-base, I have no encountered a single instance where it was used to indicate a camped Killer.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, it‚Äôs the truth. But go ahead and downvote me, people are truly immature around here over opinions that don‚Äôt match their own.
---
We NEED skullkid, that flash game is fucking epic
---
Daddy myers‚ô°
---
I‚Äôve got about 100 hours on the game just got red ranks, then I moved house, currently having no internet till after rank reset, big sad
---
"What if you're too far from the opened exit gate or go to the wrong one? Or what if end game is activated by the killer closing hatch? If that happens no exit gates are opened and u just spoon feed the killer a win.". 
---
It's all or nothing perk. If exit is within ~60 meters from you, you get a free escape. If not, well, you just delayed the inevitable.
---
Yeah, 100% agree. The Teacher would be cool, I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs the Nun or a Pharaoh killer, based on the leaked game files but I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs The Teacher.
---
oh my, a killer player with 4k+ hours who spent the majority of that time playing killer and only started playing survivor equally within the past year, who continuously WHINES about survivor taking no skill and and killers being so stressful (lol), they can't possibly be biased no! I mean he does viewer builds so ofcourse not! lmfao
---
You know you get 1000 Auric Cells for getting to the end right? You literally get back your $10 in Auric cells for premium skins on top of all the other stuff
---
The rift is pretry rubbish for people who play one killer or one survivor. I play one survivor so i will not bother with any challenges. I just want to eun away from a killer thanks

I didn't downvote, so wasn't me. But it's the signal that I've seen used since launch to indicate killer is still around, although I do see more and more people using it as a "come get me" instead as new players come in.
---
He says the killer role is a lot more stressful than the survivor role. Do you really disagree with that? Playing survivor is a shitload easier than playing Killer dude.

is this comfirmed?

I had that glitch to with the Wraith, second hook as well. It was really strange, and I‚Äôm glad to see it wasn‚Äôt just me.

Why r u gay

Yeah... you are just aids.

5 o clock shadow Nea. Cool

Nope, only lunge and vault speed. His speed only goes up in tier 2. In Tier 1 I believe he's at 105%, and then jumps to 115% in Tier 2/Tier 3.
---
Pig next please. We need more mighty Oink Goddess art
---
Oh okay gotcha
---
I'm contagious I can't help it. I'm guessing you're ignoring he messaged me first.... Per usual
---
I did have about a 4-5 month break from the game, but the player levels still hadn‚Äôt been implemented yet. Also I only play about 5-6 games a day, maybe a few more on the weekends.
---
Have you contacted the support? It mught be just a visual bug
---
God could you imagine if his name was QuestyTheBot instead. Like holy shit that is a way better name than Bloody Ghost Face. I mean why name yourself after a flair.
---
To be honest dude ive played against a lot of SWF &amp; these werent it, you got lucky this match was a bunch of spurgs that collapsed once you applied actual pressure. Cant be playing strategies your build doesnt support
---
Was this in a custom game orrr
---
Lmao
---
You are literally getting free stuff and you are complaining. Generation Zed at its finest
---
Hey what does ‚ÄòSWF‚Äô mean? I had someone message me it the other day but I can‚Äôt figure out what it means.
---
I have sent a ticket but no response
---
Survive with friends! It's the opposite of solo queue
---
Me: "rescues survivor so they can escape, then get hooked when everyone else escapes, while killer teabags"
---
Entity: "frees me so I escape" maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore
---
or how the hell did that hit? On the killer side I feel bad sometimes
---
I was playing with a friend the other day, and we realized you actually don‚Äôt even have to hit the key very quickly at all to struggle. It seems to be more about keeping steady pace. The speed the icon blinks is very misleading: you can actually press at half that speed and be fine, maybe even slower.
---
There have been times I'm playing killer and I've literally seen my weapon pass through the survivor and the hit still doesn't land. Yet you swing at a window/pallet that survivor just vaulted and they get hit, even if they're on the other side. Hit boxes don't make sense half the time.
---
*petition to change terror radius to down with the sickness*

They're aware of exclusive cosmetics disappearing and they are looking into it
---
Watch the whole video before commenting ü§°
---
Pipping isn't based solely off of how many kills you get. Hooking, kicking gens, ending chases, and more all contribute to it. If you do all of these things and get 2 kills you will probably pip up. If you facecamp 2 people so they die on their first hook and do nothing else you will inevitably depip.
---
I don't think you can buy characters with shards anymore, but if you can, get your legion. He's the motherfucking best.
---
Wanna know a secret: it wont lol
---
Thank you! Is that why the killer D/C‚Äôd the match? I figured I would take a shot in the dark and just say yes, but right after they quit lol
---
It means cancer
---
And the same freedoms are granted to those that decide to downvote it.
---
&gt;I always thought it was hitboxes. What's causing this?
---
The biggest culprit is latency.
---
Very odd. Maybe try editing the .ini file and disable Vsync/frame limit, see if that helps?
---
To answer your questions, I‚Äôve tried looking over when I get stutters (I‚Äôm playing rn) and I don‚Äôt see the cpu spiking but maybe I‚Äôm not looking fast enough. It sits at 40-60% most of the time. I don‚Äôt have turbo boost enabled, I‚Äôm usually at about 3.9Ghz. One thing I noticed though is that in the lobby my GPU is at low 90% usage, and I‚Äôm on low settings. I‚Äôll keep researching lol
---
30 minutes now.

She‚Äôs most likely trolling and holding shift

---
You *could*!? Oh that's so sweet. I'm so glad you care enough about me to even give me a moment of your time! I'm honored, really
---
Imo, Kindred is pretty much mandatory, especially if you are playing solo
---
For some reason, I  legit thought the guy on the left was shooting lightning out his face.
---
She's pregnant with a gen
---
You're such a troll dude
---
Wonder what Myers, legion, and ghostface would have?
---
Boy I'm not mad about anything, let it go, goddamn üòÇ
---
Except when your at struggle (2nd hook) and the last person alive the game skips the struggle and kills you.
---
holy shit the amount of people that took the bait lmao
---
Three year old game btw
---
Play for emblems if you want pips, there‚Äôs a lot more to it than just kills
---
Lmao the funniest shitpost I have read in a while
---
You‚Äôre right my bad.
---
Downvote all you want but he spitting facts lmao
---
am i being r/woooosh\-ed? or are YOU waiting for a game?
---
That does look a little bit further than usual (in my opinion). It kinda looks like Hillbilly‚Äôs arm stretched!
---
I would have assumed it would have hit the window frame and miss.
---
360s are corny because they wouldnt work in real life. i think pig has a horizontal swing that makes them much harder to do? unless it only looks horizontal but has the usual hit box
---
I bet you're one of those big brains who think prayer beads is the problematic addon for gen grab spirit
---
Lol I do that aswell. But idk in Jeff's case... Maybe Metal of Man, Unbreakable and Adrenaline? Mostly because those sound like heavy metal songs/bands
---
I‚Äôve seen quite a few hits like this. Billy‚Äôs chainsaw‚Äôs hitbox is really weird, and is basically a large area in front of him that is very thin but quite tall and long. This allows him to get weird downs where he probably shouldn‚Äôt. So yes, it‚Äôs a normal hit. Rare, but normal.
---
Like John coffee
---
2 crashes today, never happened before last patch.
---
Looks normal to me. 
---
Next.
---
If I get behind you, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to do a 200 degree attack.
---
It absolutely is, and it's really insulting that they refuse to go back on it. You know if they actually played the game, they'd be annoyed enough to change it, too.
---
There isn't any, every add-on gets consumed once the game begins but if you use a black ward offering then you will keep your add-ons after the game ends
---
Even just a hold prompt would do, but they don't have a struggle phase in Identity V and I don't see anyone complaining.
---
This is a me me.
---
Id rather have like 6 or 8 survivors vs 2 killers and extended maps for the mode
---
You're coming off as defensive, meaning that you are mad. There's no problem with tbagging AT ALL and it is BMing, not toxic. 
---
BM = Bad Manners. Think of it as putting your elbows on the table while eating or not sneezing on your arm or hand. It's just annoying when a person does any of that. In gaming it's a bit different, but the meaning is similar. It can be used as a strategy to tilt or annoy someone into targetting you and only you.
---
Tilt = Mental or emotional confusion or frustration which may cause someone to feel and/or play worse.
---
Annoy: To disturb or irritate especially by repeated acts.
---
Toxic = Communication and/or behavior which influences someone to harm themselves AND has no point except to make a person have a negative emotion.
---
Why am I saying this? It's because if tbagging makes you mad, it's your own fault. You believe tbagging is wrong because (Correct me if I'm wrong) you were told that it is toxic and not to do it. Tbagging does not frustrate me because I believe that it's just pixels moving up and down. 
---
Something that is toxic emotionally hurts someone even just a little bit. Tbagging does not emotionally hurt you while being told "You're a dumbass who can't do  anything" can emotionally hurt you a little bit. If tbagging emotionally hurts you, you probably have mental health issues and should talk about your feelings to a therapist.
---
That's why we have the perk lightbears.
---
UwU
---
Oh no, it‚Äôs the Cyclops from SpongeBob!
---
I don‚Äôt get this feature in the game, it requires no skill and is a huge pain in the ass and if you miss one press you die. Also while I‚Äôm here I‚Äôve always wondered why the killers perk for farming extra points has a use (barbecue and chili) points+see survivors after hooking one, but we‚Äôre gonna love forever costs the survivors a perk and they get nothing out of it besides points.
---
Seriously, I waited 30 minutes for a match, just finished. It was worth it though. One survivor tried to farm another on hook, then they wouldn't unhook him, so he DC'd and waited for the match to finish to have a 10 minute argument. Very entertaining.
---
Seems pretty good at a once-over, although Haunted Ground can already win an entire game in the best of cases. Making it GUARANTEE a down is a little salty.
---
Maybe HG's Exposed timer not kicking in until an existing expose is gone would work, but the only other expose on ALL players I can think of is T3 Myers, and it'd be weird to stagger it individually.
---
I know but still it'd would be cool to have killers with built in perks.
---
Honestly I think Evey killer and survivor should have the ability to have a built in perks in addition to the standard 4 perks they normally get.
---
Can‚Äôt unsee
---
Wouldn't be surprised if you were both survivors tbh.
---
This is my girlfriend after a blowjob.
---
Dude you look bad ass! I want to dress as Joe!
---
These are some good bears. I likes it.
---
Technically, you can get some. 900 iri shards will buy you a recolour of your base outfit.
---
I'm gettin' that Witty Clown one day.
---
I wave if I can hear the tr.
---
Sure was he told me I suck after side swiping me the entire game and revealing my location to the killer on multiple occasions so I feel this was well deserved
---
Ty bro (i was afraid to post this, everybody hate legion xd)
---
No shards. Not cells
---
Push your mom in the way and play as spectator
---
No need to mimic him. I disagree with him, but you‚Äôre just acting like a child.
---
Now there‚Äôs a mother I could dwell with
---
Why the fuck did you just write a whole essay over someone saying they're not mad
---
You're both dumb.
---
At high ranks use distortion and resilience so you can do gens fast while injured and can ignore bbq n chili and keep working on gens without killer coming straight to you.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
Looks awesome man
---
I can dig it. You did a damn good job.
---
This sounds like a comment a casual player would make. I play 6-10 hours a day and this is a common issue on console in every rank. So I have no idea what you're basing your "this only happens in potato ranks" off of.
---
People need to stop defending shitty players. It's pathetic.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs brilliant
---
How am I dumb when he started the shit? I know for a fact you've done the same thing.
---
I agree shards are easy to get if you play a lot as your devotion goes up so does the ammount of shards you get
---
BMing is bad because it hurts the killer's feelings. Killers are people too!
---
I set mine to scroll wheel down, and now my character dies randomly while during the struggle mode but it's kind of a relief because i hate struggling.
---
That dude was so mad even though he chose to dc
---
Gotta give you 1 hook after 3 dc's
---
There wasnt any OoO in the match
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
This post is ironically petty.
---
I personally disagree with being killed in a locker (endgame collapse being something different ) because infinite tombstone is a thing and that's litteraly the only counter from an infinite tombstone Myers trying to get the achievement (had a game go for so long because a Myers wanted an achievement instead of hooking my friend on the hook right beside the locker )
---
I'm going to be efficient here.
---
Chapter: Sweet Dreams
---
Killer: The Sandman
---
The Sandman possesses Old Freddy's kit, but with three additonal powers. The first is Oppressive Fatigue, where players Sandman is closer to succumb to the sleep state sooner. The second is Dreamwalk, which allows very brief invisibility much like Spirit's passive phasing (no red stain, but terror radius persists). Finally, Sandman's Dream World power is Worldshaper, an ability that lets him create fake totems (by default) or other things like gens (based on addons) to which Survivors' hands stick on RELEASE, trapping them as Trapper's ability does (with no damage by default).
---
Sandman would have standard speed and a map in a deserted city street, where rumors of him once spread through the bars.
---
Survivors are traditionally unrelated to their Killers, so I'm going to go with a Vinnie Swanson, PI past his prime. Hailing from the early 1950s, Vinnie's heard a lot of stories and taken a lot of jobs, some more scrupulous than others, but he never ended up with a satisfying payday. One day, he took a well-paying job from what turned out to be the wrong guy, and when he became a loose end to tie up, he went into hiding. The Entity made him the Hide and Seek champion of the world.
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK! I WANT ONE!
---
Maybe you should just go hook yourself.
---
How so? Merely pointing out how childish my last match was considering I was very on-point with countering all of their tactics (placing traps near pallets, near the hook, blocking all ways of trying to escape me and distract me) and because of that, they all childishly threw a tantrum and left the match.
---
It‚Äôs not petty to highlight the pettiness of others mate.
---
Most people don‚Äôt play 6-10 hours a day ffs. You may have a bias from playing too many hours. Because you see it more often but I am guessing that the actual number of games where people are getting legitimately tunneled and camped is lower than you think. Then on top of that it feels bad, so it stands out in our experiences more than the good games we had. Then there is the problem of perception of tunneling and camping which is often wrong. People think they are being tunneled and camped when they‚Äôre just making bad plays. 
---
The majority of people who play this game and most other video games are filthy casuals like myself because we have jobs and lives and don‚Äôt have time to play 6-10 mins numbing hours a day every day playing a video game.
---
That's a cool concept, but shouldn't the Killer name be more like "The Split?" "The Duo?" "The Multiple?"
---
I mean, they're all psychopaths. Except Susie and Plague.
---
I had a game a little while ago where the survivors were practically throwing themselves at me. I would hook someone and they would be up my ass right behind me unhooking right in my face then had the gall to message me with salty messages about tunneling....-_-
---
No, it would be like it has a higher chance to be that box and that's why I said possibly 2 it'd give her map control and yeah it could be abused but so can everything in the game if you want it to, and it wouldn't be for everyone or every trap, maybe just like the next trap you put on or something. These are just rough ideas to get people thinking and talking
---
DbD needs Dream Witch.
---
Unbreakable, what's more metal than coming back from the dead? [Tack on Tenacity, and 2 other perks]
---
Yeah.
---
Or unhook with the killer right next to the damn hook then get downed again instantly after. So frustrating.
---
"Take the bait" implies that you were camping the hooked survivor. Were you?
---
We should, but there are no better games to move to so I guess we can go to hell.
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Okay, but hear me out here: 
---
Alastor for next killer plz, BHVR.
---
Macro for struggle and macro for wiggle
---
griefing means theyre venting. u can set messages to friends only if u like. i dont think trapper + tar bottle is bannable :P
---
Why is no one talking about that? It was so far off
---
Cuz I‚Äôm a supporter of women
---
Along with the Rift was also the Archives, I think it adds a bit more variety imo
---
If BMing hurts your feelings, you shouldn't be playing a multiplayer video game. People BM in all multiplayers that have a way to do so. Tbagging exists in Call of Duty, Halo, Overwatch, Counter Strike, and other video games. Emoting after a kill or winning in a racing game can be BMing for some people. Spamming a spray can be used as BMing. 
---
I'm saying this as a killer main who doesn't care about getting BMd. I will not change my mind on my opinion at all.
---
Set up exactly like Xbox I suppose.
---
It's all the way up! Might be cuz I'm on xbox?
---
I wasn‚Äôt camping, I laid out traps around the hooked survivor and then scouted the area, one of the survivors ended up getting trapped by one I laid out in front of a pallet (there was grass concealing it) and I got her, that‚Äôs when they decided to quit the match and the other two quit the match. 
---
The Hooked survivor was the only one who just gave me a kill by not struggling against the Entity anymore. 
---
I don‚Äôt need to be required to take the bait in any match, I play smart, hooked survivors always provide a 50/50 chance that another survivor will appear nearby to rescue them. I scout those areas then come back to check on the hooked survivor, if I feel confident nobody is rushing to save them or that my traps are near fool-proof, I leave them and proceed to scour the map for more survivors.
---
Thank you
---
Ahh...only in DBD will u get these Thomas had never seen such bullshit before moments.
---
üòÇ
---
Thought so thanks
---
PC. Special cosmetics not in character customization. Street Meg/Sciencefair Claudette, Dweard/Sharp moustache Jake, Daddy Jake jacket and Chuckles Trapper mask. Tried restarting DBD, logging out of Steam.
---
You sound fun man
---
Thanks man. I'll keep trying to work it out
---
Where'd you get your mask? That's all I need to finish mine.
---
At least you can send them a private message outside of the game itself if it were on Xbox, I don't think there's a way to contact those playing on Steam.
---
Kinda annoying, hopefully it's something they add in later, but I doubt it.
---
If your last person alive and get hooked it Insta-kills you regardless.
---
Because you seem mad. I'm allowed to state my opinion (Tbagging is allowed and is not toxic) just as you are allowed to state yours (Tbag is toxic and shouldn't be done), yet you are getting defensive over your opinion and even said something that doesn't even fit with what I am saying to tell me that tbagging is wrong. 
---
If you are going to give a half-witted argument, I will give you one that will make you think. Seeing as you don't feel like arguing, I will just ignore you as I want an actual argument instead of "SURVIVOR MAIN 4HEAD."
---
try moving your cam the opposite direction that you turn your character. it helps spinning faster
---
It's not lower than you think.
---
Go back to playing killer and face camping you degenerate. And quit trying to pretend as if you have input when you're a casual.
---
Half the time I forget to equip them. I don't understand why you have to equip one every time even when you have like 50 stocked up.
---
It is typical salty survivor fashion to say literally playing the game is a bannable offense..
---
Yeah I agree lol
---
Thanks for the advice. I didnt know that actually
---
Imagine pointing out a bad loop where the killer can essentially side step a pallet to completely negate it and the random replying to be wooshed by said example even though I followed it up with a more in depth example of how it would work in an actual loop rather than a 1 lane loop with a single pallet. Useless is useless. Examples are meant to guide you to see what the person in question is referencing, not to take it out of context as if you're inexperienced to the way the maps are set up
---
Devour is so rapey. I love discord.
---
\*sweats in mains healer Claudette\*
---
Because it's common decency, just the same as you don't go around insulting people on the street *"just because you feel like it"*.
---
I like to collect them. Every event item we get I keep some. I‚Äôll use a few here and there. Plus, I personally don‚Äôt think the Petals do much this year. Last year they were the main source to get Viles, but now they do what? Only give a few thousand points. Which is a little too insignificant to use, in my opinion.
---
So you want an addon that isn't even guaranteed to work,  but when it does is a guaranteed kill per game lmao
---
I pay a guy who makes masks, he is from mexico so... you want the contact?
---
I always miss stuff like this. No wonder my survivor game is trash.
---
2 hex perks are dicey. Sub devour out for Haunted or a tracking perk.
---
Are you injured when you get the great skill checks?
---
I‚Äôm running no mither.
---
I got:
---
Billy's Weapon and Bottom.
---
Wraith Weapon.
---
Probably getting entire Jake next.
---
They leave your inventory dont they?
---
&gt;i cant wait to post this to reddit
---
get a life pls
---
Using phrases like "I do love it" and "Oh you Survivors" in this type of context just make your entire post sound petty.
---
I dunno then, I don't run no mother sorry D=
---
Maybe try a round without it?
---
Unbalanced game with a non competitive community that thinks they're competitive while dismissing any balance changes to make it more casual for their casual mode that happens to have ranks.
---
No, they just gray out like the Lunar New Year cards I still have.
---
Not really? It can be activated multiple times in a game just once per person / 1 trap per person. And it could be like 2 boxes have a higher chance, maybe like 30-40% per box for it to be that one, itd give map control but wouldn't be broken imo
---
Looks like dedicated servers
---
On pc every couple of games I get stuck on a infinite loading screen. Its annoying but not terrible. It will happen atleast once an hour.
---
I‚Äôll get back to you on that
---
Which tracking perk would you reccomend?
---
you're not wrong.
---
The order of perks/items/offerings etc does matter so it might work if you switch the order. Though  now that the syringe only heals one health state it might just end up only healing the deep wounds.
---
Correct! Gotta pay cash for the licensed characters cosmetics! Worth it though
---
Jake, Iron Will will change your life. After playing with Iron Will 3, i legit can't go back to playing without it.
---
I love the idea of switching between sneaky T1 and dangerous T2. Could be a good idea for an add-on, they play so differently and mixing it up during a match could be great fun.
---
Whispers, Surveillance, or level 1 Discordance
---
yeah haha i learned that the hard way lmao. i kept slowly turning myself into the killer
---
Yep.
---
This is false. Blocking does nothing to prevent you from queueing with the same loser. People have been complaining about this specific thing for years.
---
The amount of casuals on this thread spewing utter nonsense is abysmal.
---
Ight. I'll be sure to pick up Discordance then as soon as I can buy Legion. I'm terrible with using Whispers
---
Its funny that you think that it is im currently sitting at rank 1 and i get 9 to 10 hooks consistently and barely pip at times.
---
Nurses is pretty good on Wraith. Plus it‚Äôs good with Sloppy Butcher. Don‚Äôt know if you need Nurses and BBQ though
---
It‚Äôs only good at level 3. It‚Äôs useful for knowing which part of the map people are on though.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø I don't know what to tell you other than that's how most players signal it on ps4. I'm not gonna change just because one guy tells me to. It's how I learned it and I'm sticking with it. 
---
And also, the unhook action makes more sense because it's like "hey, unhook me or I'll try and unhook myself." I don't understand how it's possibly the other way around, that seems stupid to me. I'm sticking to my method because it makes sense and just about everybody on ps4 does it the same way.
---
That's me 50% of chases lol it's a surprise I'm rank 11 from my gameplay lmao
---
I bought Clown‚Äôs Blight outfit, because I thought his was really cool. 
---
And I want to get Spirit‚Äôs and Jake‚Äôs outfits with the Viles.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the help
---
Good. You did didn't lookat hand
---
I'll take it into consideration. Thanks
---
Thanks, definitely considering it cause I‚Äôm liking this game
---
Its not map control at all, its a guarenteed kill or its a worthless addon, there is no inbetween. Either it hits the 40% and the boxes were close together, giving you a free kill, OR they highrolled and got it off on the other ones/ the two boxes you got are literally cross map giving you no pressure, unless you saw him check the other one and it didnt work.
---
Its why you can't see how much longer a person has to die as the pig, you can estimate it and force them off of the box if its been a long ass time you can probably assume thats their final box to check.
---
With yours, you already know the box they need to go to, and you can just hard camp it and get a free kill because they cant get it off, OR they try the others and get it off and your just like "Wow i guess this addon did literally nothing for me"
---
It's a video game though. I'm not going to stop tbagging during the survivor games that I play at times because a snowflake doesn't like the fact that I hit a key to move pixels up and down. I could care less if I get camped because of that either. I don't camp survivors for tbagging me, I just get annoyed since they're like "HAHA IM SO GOOD" just to get downed not long after. I'll even be thinking "Why the fuck are you tbagging if you're not even that good?" since the player who tbags in my games usually sucks and just made the game boring by keeping me in a chase for so little time.
---
Its funny how im sitting at rank 1 and consistently get 9-10 hooks and dont pip.
---
Its funny how i get 4ks and depip.
---
Its funny how i get 2ks with 8 hooks and dont pip. But whatever you say.
---
Thanks
---
If you depip with 2 kills you likely camped or tunnel the survivors and got punished for it.
---
Clown head and that‚Äôs it I guess. Maybe I‚Äôll get jakes outfit
---
Definitely not
---
Do what you want but I have been playing on ps4 since release and it has always been unhook action if being camped. As I said if I see someone struggling I assume they are being camped and continue doing gens.
---
Im actually  skipping on paying up because of how much grinding it is. Alot of people don't have that much time and everyone is supposed to have a chance on getting it. For example , Love or hate fortnite  the battle pass  is pretty spot on. You get 11 quests  or so every week that give 52k xp each (you need 80k to level up)  plus medals on daily that give in total around 50k aswell. It's a good way of implementing it as it make sure that people  who buy it last minute or don't play alot have a chance to get all the rewards. My time  aside weekends is very limited  and I don't think I'm gonna waste it solely on grinding for the rift.
---
None of the things you said are true.
---
Oh I did not know that.
---
PHILLIP YOUR MOUTH WITH MY DICK
---
I know right? If they are unable to play smart and just brazenly throw themselves at you, then they should accept defeat. I‚Äôve played as Survivor for a long time, I know all the strategies and ins and outs, so I can‚Äôt help it if I can see through all their tactics as a Killer, neither can I help it if I keep killing everyone if they get caught in my traps because I can predict where they‚Äôre coming from in the area surrounding the hook or they just try way too hard to unhook a Survivor when I‚Äôm still in the area.
---
I‚Äôve had a few matches play out like that now and I can‚Äôt help but shake my head every time it happens. Luckily I play on PS4 and have settings that block randoms from messaging me so who knows if they‚Äôre complaining or acting butt-hurt that I keep killing them all in the first three minutes.
---
BHVR literally said they were changing her in a recent live stream, so I think theyre starting to listen more, for better or for worse.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Considering the way they were acting, I‚Äôm entitled to mock them by using those phrases. But continue to defend poor play attitude, I was in the right.
---

Made on the day of release on pc. Do what you will but don't blame me when there is confusion haha see you in the fog :)
---
Idk after I play for too long that tunnel vision takes over and makes me feel kinda motion sick trying too keep track of some survivor who thinks they're the juke king
---
As if he's interested in women...
---
Are you the shugoki Yoda  at for honor sub?
---
Lol. The fact that you play 6-10 hours a day doesn‚Äôt mean that your opinion is any more important that anyone else‚Äôs. I do play killer but I don‚Äôt face camp, nice try though. If you want to really impress everybody why don‚Äôt you do something useful with your 6-10 hours a day of playing and actually figure out how many matches you were face camped compared with how many you played.
---
Im fairly sure undetectable trumps all aura reading now, it even trumps kindreds explicit "Kindred trumps any of the Killer's stealth abilities. " text
---
no. just... no. You clearly don't know what you're talking about. Against a spirit injured=dead, if she gets that first hit you've already lost. And attempting to mindgame a spirit at a pallet is a death sentence because they're the one that has all the info while you have to guess, not to mention that if you're injured you have no way to mindgame her

I would understand if they didn't already have it so killer add-ons stayed equipped if they have more in their inventory
---
There's nothing wrong with juking the killer...that's kind of the point of the game... and when you're legion in frenzy and multiple survivors jump in front of you to get you off a guy you already hit with frenzy and you still tunnel that's kinda messed up.
---
don't worry, there hardly ever is :)
---
A change... mainly to her add ons.
---
You thought ghostface was the only one with a leaning mechanic??
---
Why would I get my Hope's up when I've been proven right over and over again
---
Hey looks its the guy
---
It's decent. I'd pick either ruin or devour, not both personally. Nurse's, MYC, and PGTW are also good on him, and like u/Papa-Cuddles said- 
---
&gt; Whispers, Surveillance, or level 1 Discordance
---
are good as well.
---
r/okaybuddydaylight
---
Ghostface timing his shroud sure, he wasted his power to block borrowed fine whatever, but freddy literally existing is kinda retarded. To be expected to blow yourself up on a gen pre-unhooking is a a huge stretch for "counterplay"
---
Jake because Iron will is unlockable at level 30 and makes it so you don't have to level him to 40 since his last two don't see much gameplay. Iron will is going to help you make plays you couldn't have otherwise since you won't make noise.
---
Bill 2nd because borrowed time can help you make hero plays you otherwise couldn't have, granted it does not work against killers with "Undetectable" but if they have DS you've essentially weaponized the survivor and if they don't you've still given them a second chance. Assuming your killer is a tunneler.
---
David or Nea for 3rd because Dead hard and balanced landing can help create distance and loops you couldn't have other wise made. Dead hard is kinda floppy right now with it not working all the time but I run Iron will, Balanced, Borrowed time and Iron will. Makes it to where I always have options. 
---
My 2 cents.
---
Fuck, I‚Äôm sorry bro I meant to say that turbo boost IS enabled, my bad I‚Äôm drinking while playing LOL lots of distractions. I‚Äôm using task manager to monitor usage as well as the intel extreme tuning to monitor temperature as well as throttling and GHz. WITH turbo boost enabled I‚Äôm averaging 3.9 GHz, which seems normal if the max is 4.2 with turbo boost.
---
Awhile ago I made sure I was on Max Performance power settings, but since then I‚Äôve installed Razer Cortex and now that‚Äôs been replaced by Razer Cortex Power Plan? Although I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the issue, the issues I have with DbD have long surpassed the power settings I‚Äôve messed with. 
---
Thanks for being so responsive and actually trying to figure this out with me, LOL
---
He's better than before but he's still a M1 killer so id put him in the middle of the pack.
---
The fact the you only play killer is painstakingly obvious. Just quit it with the white knight bullshit that you think you're doing you fucking casual.
---
Are you trying to propose that you are some kind of badass who oftenly gets hate in their dms
---
"Oh no, the only killers that aren't super hard to play against are the ones people play! Let's complain about the top tier one until she gets nerfed, I'm sure that'll solve the problem!"
---
From what i've seen most survivors need to actually see Michael myers to take action against him, hearing the sounds aren't enough to stop them from focusing on a gen or looting a box so it becomes an afterthought....Then everyone gets exposed.
---
Here we see a usually vicious killer posing with wraith, who is also usually a vicious killer
---
We dont know that, and regardless, thats still a nerf
---
Where did he send this message to you?
---
Hey some of them are """"""""innocent""""""""and anyone they killed they just wake up again
---
I got two games today where just cause I didn't swing right away they assumed I was friendly. So when I attacked them they were all surprised and one even DCed and said baiting people is a scummy tactic and that I needed to do it cause I was shit at the game... I was trying to stalk like what the hell?
---
Nah. The reason *you're* wooshing me is because you don't know how to wooosh properly. Seriously, go look at the sub r/whooosh. What does it say there in the description?
---
"A subreddit about people who miss the joke/satire." This is neither, idiot.
---
&gt;Nah, servers are acting up right now. Played multiple games and everyone in the server is experiencing it.
---
Maybe the issue is with the server of a certain region? See if you, OP and the "everyone experience it" are from the same region. Server for South America hasn't had any issue.
---
What rank is this?
---
yeah but some maps are an issue, if they werent ppl wouldnt be complaining about it, it isnt a fair window regardless of your "just dont go to the window" the fact ur saying to avoid it proves its a ridiculous window
---
Imagine linking the wrong subreddit.
---
But seriously if you can't tell that this was a joke you must be brain dead.
---
i did and they still made the window
---
pretty much
---
It could be a building like killers shack that‚Äôs in every map that grants rewards inside when a gem or something is done, it‚Äôd get trapped to hell though so it‚Äôd be risky
---
Red blob chases blue blob around a tree for five minutes while green black and orange blob do all the gens
---
What if you don't have a dad? Do you play killer?
---
I second that, ghost face is amazing.
---
Right!
---
Bold + 1
---
I think we were all in the purple and reds
---
yeah but again they keep going to it, i hit them them they used the burst and make the window
---
its not like i didnt catch any of them its just they got so much gen pressure due to this window and its just bullshit i shouldnt have to give up a gen due to poor map design
---
yeah but i play at high ranks and it generally doesnt happen
---
Clown and Spirit. I didn‚Äôt even realize you can get last year‚Äôs outfits with serum too.
---
We have plenty of time for tier 70. The rift will close the 13th of January and before it even closes they'll put out the next few archive pages. Don't rush so much :)
---
Imagine not realizing this is either trolling or stupidity, not a joke. A joke is something entirely different. God almighty, you're dumb.
---
It could be something like, all movement speed is slowed equally percentage wise for both killers and survivors. Then we‚Äôd be able to have hip deep water as a new obstacle patched into other maps like the swamp as well. I‚Äôd love it.
---
Might have been the case for my second match, had a rank 4 who was the first to get the attention before preceding to loop the killer 5 feet away from my hook until I'm about to hit stage 2 then DCing after getting downed again.
---
i agree, its a simple thing to fix just remove the window killers shouldnt be forced to run perks/or play certain killer for the possibility of getting a window like iron works
---
I had higher hopes for you, you've disappointed me
---
I mean even if you know she just warped as soon as she gets it back you're fucked. Especially since you'll have no idea when she's used it.
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
How can you have 3 stacks of "We're gonna live forever" if you're farming?
---
I‚Äôm getting Spirit for sure, but I don‚Äôt know what else. Maybe Clown or Plague. Any suggestions?
---
I don‚Äôt even think OKBR would accept this
---
How can you fuck up so badly
---
I'm happy we're doing Hazbin Hotel memes.
---
I'm just as confused as you are
---
I wouldn't buy it,  until killers quit being dicks or maybe they already have idk. I seen a shit ton of posts on here where killers message and tell you to change,  if you don't they either face camp you to death or camp and instantly mori. I have no idea why,  buuuut that's what I have seen and I never see them anymore since. :/
---
Very accurate that the claudette is pushing the meg
---
Have some dignity
---
You dishonor yourself legion main.
---
Wow that is absolute bullshit. How is anyone with a life supposed to get to level 47? It takes way too many games to get one level.
---
The maps are literally on floating islands
---
I mean this is so unrealistic.
---
Max rank of we're gonna live forever is green.
---
MUH IMMERSION!
---
Yeah, salty survivors think that her being viable is a sin
---
Take a hit while they‚Äôre wiggling, self care, and make an unsafe unhook
---
Yeah, the Losers club wasn't a group of ordinary children. They had assistancr from Maturin.
---
So far I got Jake's full set and one cosmetic for Spirit
---
Billy? Maybe trapper.
---
Lol if anything I was like surprised he was being nice to me. Like this guy was winning easily. Not saying he‚Äôs a jerk, he or she was a good sport.
---
That's cool but I know you're just trying to play it cool but I know full well you've lost your cool before but keep thinking you're better than everyone bro.

Also why am I being downvoted? I explained the situation exactly. I‚Äôm the one in the right here.

Hey, who turned out the lights?

Seriously it's one of the dumbest ideas for a perk. It sounds nice but shit for killers and then for the game.
---
Just Finnished mine glad to see someone else likes legion to was wondering if I should post mine
---
You realise that there's 3 other survivors you have to worry about right, it's not a 1v1, sure you can make sure that 1 person doesn't get it off but the other 3 will if they're smart sit on gens so camping it won't do much for you
---
PC. Every couple games I get randomly booted from the game.

Welcome comdrade! Prepare to be annoyed, I see you play the good boy wraithüíú best of luck!
---
Drop no mither for stake out 3 stacks and your golden
---
The knife is with some girl/dude in facebook monster crafts
---
No. Like yeah some maps are unbalanced. But you are not supposed to straight up down survivors anywhere you want. You as the killer can choose your battle, it differentiate good killers from bad ones, because good killers make the best out of his options, bad ones tunnel survivors at infinites and dc.
---
She needs counterplay I agree the passive phasing is bs some times. I doubt it will be a major change to her power. Maybe take the movement of her phasing so you can kinda see where she is headed in her power where she is a bit ahead of the trail that follows behind her
---
Nah. You can definitely struggle the whole way by yourself. Someone else has to be hooked during your struggle. But if you're the last one hooked and everyone else is dead, then it's insta.
---
It's definitely not a consistent thing tho. Haven't pegged down the exact requirements for it.
---
No, I don't see how some tiny girl with a tiny blade can break a pallet as easy as that.
---
It sounds fair since killers can break through pallets and tombstone myers exists
---
Nice knife!
---
Freddy is still pretty viable. The Nurse rework was fine, I do not understand this circlejerk of Nurse being bad. If you relied on Omega Blink and extra blinks to win, you sucked. Plain and simple. People who could down with two blinks barely suffered whatsoever.
---
Yes, the idea was to get stranger things fans to play the game then make them spend money on the outfit. If people play the game free on game pass then BHVR can still make money on them.
---
Mettle of man wouldn't be bad if they hadn't nerfed it 6 feet under.
---
No
---
Not enough M1s, not enough hook events.
---
They fall apart when you kick it twice with way less momentum and force as she would be putting into her run
---
Oh ive been doing it all wrong, it seems intuitive to flail about to ‚Äúget attention‚Äù, and staying still indicates ‚Äúdanger is near, be quiet‚Äù, yes i get that i must be doing it wrong, all im saying is that its INTUITIVE to do it the other way, and COUNTER-INTUITIVE to do it the way that someone early on decided on, feels unnatural to flail about in the killers face, as if to attempt an unhook, so why would they leave? And if they are face camping and the killer knows that flailing is a warning, they arent going to move anyways if that is their intent.
---
Idk just seems backwards to me :/
---
Don't tag it as something Official when it's not
---
I can understand her kicking it as well as all other killers but there's no way she can break it with a tiny blade.
---
She's actually really mature for her age so it doesn't count*
---
Like thatcher always says‚Äù a six inch blade never loses reception‚Äù
---
Trapper and Ghostface though
---
Who's joe

I got using stake out but it was tough because I was playing against Vomit Comet.

People dying on first hook you need 8 hooks to pip or something like that
---
Most likely servers. Happens to me probably every 5 games or so.
---
It will show me as ‚ÄúDC‚Äôd‚Äù as well as the Killer, and I receive no points/XP and lose pips.
---
She could like fall into it or something along those lines
---
i heard the ender 3 is great and works even better with small upgrades did you ever upgrade it with other parts you can 3d print?
---
Killer?
---
Yeah also makes survivors feel less like skins and have actual differences
---
Haha! You're so funny and cool! Wowee!
---
I've honestly wanted to uninstall the game over these servers. It's been so frustrating on both sides. Bullshit window hits, ridiculous huntress hitboxes, and literally having my adrenaline activate while being picked up and getting a nice lil speed boost on freddy shoulders. 
---
On top of that they nerf nurse so she's pretty hard to play so I need to focus pretty intently to do well &amp; she's full of bugs. Blink charging infinitely and not actually letting me blink, tons of dead zones, and being stuck in place randomly. 
---
It's been a rough month :\[
---
They should award 1 rift shard.
---
i love you !
---
Awwww thank you. Always great to meet a fan. üòÅüòÅ
---
Makes me wonder.. If someones tier 3 is the option to escape a trap gone for them if they get caught?
---
Cmon we all know anything that helps a survivor in anyway shape or form is toxic

kinda represents that you‚Äôre spazzing out over something and just smashing your keys all at once

---
Tombstone myers which is a struggle to even get to work in most games if you're against survivors with half a brain and so breaking through pallets quickly means survivors should have a 3 second sprint burst even when the killer doesnt break through the pallet? Consult the picture.
---
Hag!! Maybe spirit as my second.
---
Depending on the brand, it can come with macro options. (steelseries and logitech let you use their software to create macros).
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/b946W2u.png) is a picture of my custom macros using the software that comes with my logitech mouse. As you can see, I use an ad bind and an f bind to run so I don't have to do any of the work.
---
How did you 1 hit your 3rd kill at the 11 min mark?
---
What are the best Legion builds anyway? I want to use my Susie but I suck with Legion.
---
Yeaaah kinda just sounds like your ISP. Ever since dedicated servers have been out I've been getting 80ms ping in every game. My guess is that dedicated servers have kinda screwed lower end internet people and made it better for better internet people
---
Exactly
---
It was a joke. There should be a new perk where survivors stand still for 2 seconds.
---
"Will be like probably be like" am I too sleep deprived or is this written wrong?
---
Not a console player but are you using headphones or speakers?
---
The flashlight itself isn‚Äôt toxic. Use it all you want.
---
It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúHey! look at me! Haha!‚Äù Click-Spamming at every loop/chase/vault that‚Äôs annoying. Especially when people have it bound to their scroll wheel, it just becomes an almost literal fly in your ear. So now I will down you and watch to make sure you die.
---
Yea, my build didn't match, but his power matches that play style.
---
I havent had much chances to vs her since i had 600 hours before she was added and i stopped playing till recently but if were trying to make her like the nurse you should be able to see or understand she's gone invisible so the most threatening part of her kit isnt her just looking at you xD.
---
I hit everyone with main attack.
---
Kate, but my flair = bias
---
LMAO the fact that you took your time to make this is so sad.
---
Took me like 2 mins not much work.
---
Hilarious
---
It would be impossible to hit anything if you had to hit the actual survivors body with the actual hit box without and kind of visual feedback in the form of a crosshair or visible arc. She would be the most unfun and unusable killer in the game as the games not very well designed for first person shooting mechanics.
---
Agreed. I play at rank 1 on both sides and when I choose to have fun with legion or something everyone suddenly wants to be toxic with flashlights and tea bags etc.. But if I switch back to Billy or Huntress I'm an asshole for 4king. It's weird to me as well that I've given hatch many times to be friendly and have recieved it, but I can't remember a time a survive with friends gave up a kill to a killer after a bad match. Killers really do get the shit end of the stick a lot.
---
Kate cos jiggle physics.
---
Or just hit em, could have easily downed someone else, maybe even 2.
---
The dirty hand made me LOL üòÇ that's gonna be infected for sure
---
Feng, I'm not biased though.  
---
She's the best.
---
For sure dude! I'd be scared as fuck of Billy as well, hearing that saw moving at warp speed wouldn't be fun
---
this was my Halloween costume in the 5th grade
---
But the way these gears are set up they're all useless together LOL.
---
Chains made out of fucking knives.
---
I love being a former red rank killer in rank 14 from decay. I can be nice to baby survivors and absolutely shit on 4 nea bully squads.
---
Oc the urban using console player immediately acts like a child when they get called out
---
The nerfs are problematic for a couple of reasons though. The barrier for entry to succeed with Nurse now is kind of insane when you factor in the dedicated servers tomfoolery. It's a legitimate question: why on earth would I choose Nurse over Spirit or Billy? Secondly, they came up with the initial blink distance math relative to her 96% speed for a reason. I've run into situations with some particularly astute red rank survivors where they simply held W when I didn't have range extensions or cooldown reductions. The base cooldown is at least 0.5 seconds too long if they are going to keep her at 96%
---
I almost nutted
---
Haha that's true. I'd probably be scared of every Killer, except for trapper, he just seems like a nice guy in a way tbh. But with the Clown I'd also be annoyed^^
---
Distortion tokens should be rewarded back for some altruistic actions, make people more active to use it more and keep their stealth. And no, guy above, running 4 perks and a tool box then sabo‚Äôing an area to m a y b e get a use or two off doesn‚Äôt make flip-flop a good perk.
---
So why is it an addon then? If your not gonna use the advantages it gives you all it tells you is where the person *could* of been when it came off.  
---
If you pick this addon, your using it for the reason of tunneling someone down, not so you know where someone might be.
---
I was literally just saying to my BF how there should be a deep sea killer. Like have a submarine or island map. It would be so much fun
---
you can message them about it and they will credit you. not that it fixes the issue but worth a try.
---
I think I was pretty accurate :D
---
Its a bug that happend. I think it was scott i saw end a match then have like 900$ worth of cells
---
Exactly! I am not even mad when I get a 2k at high ranks and I always respect low tier killers I encounter as a survivor
---
I would like the contact c:
---
You're doing gods work.
---
That's the face that I see after getting tea-bagged
---
I never said everyone else doesn't care about tbagging, it's just that I shouldn't have to stop tbagging or flashlight clicking or anything because a snowflake killer or survivor can't handle the fact I BMd them.
---
"Start thinking more about others." So just stop killing people as killer because some survivors don't like being killed. Oh, and stop destroying ruin because there are killers that hate that, too. Yeah, no. I'm not going to stop tbagging because some players don't like that just as I won't stop camping because some players don't like that.

There are no words to describe how much I love this.

That brought up a point does the entity create the worlds with the generators and ways to escape or does an outside entity add them to help the survivors?

Oh okay thank you for that. I don't own most of the survivors so I had no idea it did that. I don't own majority of survivors so thill have to pick it up in shrine

Kate, her leather biker pants pair really well with near anything.

Thanks I made it over a year ago, maybe someday i'll include all the other survivors.

That made my day. Thanks for posting.

The scratch marks.

Well, okay... fair enough.

Non-stop tunneling, and not the "well, you're the closest and I gotta hit someone" tunneling most complain about. I mean legit tunneling.
---
Camping, obviously.
---
The non-stop teabagging from survivors.
---
I would say just the overall lack of sportsmanship and honor this game's community is overwhelmingly lacking.

And I'm not new. I have a lvl 50 / P3 Claudette. I'm devotion 1 and then some. I've been purple ranks as killer and survivor.

The further you go in, the worse it gets.

I wish i had that many :(

Ive been struggling against spirit and have been mostly been getting her on Xbox the past couple of days. I'm getting better at versing her.

used em all up m8

Trapper, while setting the trap: Oh fuck oh fuck oh fu

Just today I found out there‚Äôs a trick to telling when to counter on mind games. Shards will light up? Idk. But with Spirit detection and anti-prayer beads is key.

You're technically dissing yourself
---
You mind elaborating I'm a little lost. I've been getting her with 360s and all but been really struggling with mind games. It's like a 50/50 now though.
---
This is a very old post. 
---
The mentioned matchmaking has been live since Legion update.
---
Spirit mainly tracks by following scratch marks, dance with me allows you to vault a window and then run without leaving scratch marks for 3 seconds, especially combined with lithe I have used this to completely lose spirit.
---
And that‚Äôs generally what‚Äôs wrong with it. My idea is walking one way, wait about a second, then walk the other way because that‚Äôs when a spirit would phase.
---
Wow are you serious? I googled recent stuff about matchmaking and came across this so I thought it was new smfh
---
Im spamming F.

I've gotten pretty good like landing 24k a game but no pips. Probably should've should an actual games points.

It‚Äôs tough to get a complete 4k iridescent emblems as wraith.

lol
---
I saw it coming hence why I asked what you considered toxic. Like I said, each player has their "list" and none of the things you mentioned is considered toxic by a significant part of the community.
---
Frustrating, perhaps.

Thus the point.

Oh didn't know dance with me did that. Thank you very much. Dude this community on this page is mad helpful.
---
Wait thats illegal
---
&gt;Thus the point.
---
What point? The community is garbage because people don't play as you'd like?
---
It's symbolism.
---
I had a game with a Spirit, took probably 20 minutes. Everyone was about 4 ranks lower than me. Everyone got sacrificed, except me in The Game. Spirit closed the hatch, and I waited till she left the gate (other was thankfully on the other side) and hit it. About 3/4 when she came back. Hid by some boxes with a pallet. I realized I was either gonna get found or run out of time, so when she cane by I stunned and ran to the gate. She was about to hit ne, so I let go. 1/32 away by now. Finished it and dashed (w/o Dead Hard or sprint) to the gate, heart pumping, fell into the exit, then **bam** my shitty internet dc
---
I 5th this
---
That format would've also fit lol
---
The game should also come with special anti-corn goggles. I swear i cant see 3 feet infront of me on those maps lol
---
And then the killer closes the hatch and the gates spawn within 4 meters of each other
---
You're right. Clearly the overwhelming number of posts talking shit is just a fluke and the folks playing this game are cool.
---
Have a good one.
---
This is actually a very cool cosplay! But I think the jacket you used looks a bit too... Buff.
---
I can relate but i‚Äôm not a baby killer.
---
i never even knew pizza dwight was a thing before i came here, i just thought it was hilarious to put him in all red
---
i guess that means i've found the right community
---
&gt; You're right. Clearly the overwhelming number of posts talking shit is just a fluke and the folks playing this game are cool.
---
I am probably blind because I don't see such posts or they are just too stupid to be acknowledged by my brain.

---
No one has to be polite to other players in a video game that allows you to kill other players. 
---
I've said this before about other things, this is NOT real life. You can't compare a stream sniper to a rapist because their main point is similar. You can't compare punching people to tbagging. Players also tbag for a variety of reasons in this game specifically. Tbagging can mean anywhere from "Hello" to "GG EZ." I'm never going to stop tbagging to mean "Thank you" and not for "GG EZ" either because someone thinks all tbagging can mean is "FUCK YOU BABY KILLER." I'm allowed to tbag if I feel like it and telling me it's impolite will not make me stop tbagging.
---
You're a snowflake if you complain about tbagging. Not everyone cares about your feelings due to getting tbagged, and I certainly don't because you shouldn't be mad at tbagging. Tbagging is just hitting crouch. You shouldn't get mad over that, and if you do, you are definitely a snowflake in my book.
---
oh he has eyes.....  somewhere
---
probably
---
Definitely contact support. I have been waiting over a week on a lost cosmetic though so Good luck
---
I only buy Outfits for my mains and the cases where an outfit that just released get to replace the current ones I have are almost non-existent.
---
Cloak with wraith. As soon as you cloak it should drop the chase.
---
Huntress I believe. That was when we tested it specifically. I believe it has been happening since the hotfix came out
---
put a tiny Claudette behind the gen. would be a perfect representation of dbd lmao
---
That sucks. Now I have no hope for this game. Waiting for a match as red rank survivor is hell, I even tried to derank myself to find lobbies quicker but the teams I find in lower ranks are worse
---
Wait, so you really don't see any issue with incessant teabagging and generally toxic behavior from survivors, being purposefully tunneled to death, or camped by killers?
---
You're totally fine with this happening to you?
---
If your game freezed before he left thats probably a crash, happens a lot and messaging the devs will most likely get a response saying they can't give you anything and apologising.
---
When the killer leaves you get your stuff
---
Damn lol I would've been salty just stunned a spirit while she was phasing. Wish I recorded it lol. I'm on Xbox a lot of these ranks shouldn't be what they were. From what my friend noticed before dashboarding didnt make you lose pips all the time so some of these high ranks are just awful
---
Maybe a Big Daddy would be cool. A Rapture City map would be DBD worthy. Plus its violent enough.
---
If i had that much id by the whole shop idc if i dont play them lol
---
His meme says last one alive though.
---
With an under water map???
---
Definitely just your ISP or the servers then just wait it out I guess
---
Most killers kill me no matter what item I give them.
---
That‚Äôs not a gen rush. In theory all the gens can be done in less than 2 minutes, and assuming that the killer has 2 people occupied at all times it would take them less than 4 minutes. All things considered, I would say the emblem system is more to blame then the objectives. I mean, 8 hooks no kills is still a bronze, and so is 4 hooks 4 kills. And he only got silver gatekeeper because even if the game lasts ten minutes, if all five get done in the last minute it‚Äôs iridescent but if 4 get done immediately it‚Äôs silver. 
---
I don‚Äôt watch streamers often but, when I play I try and have someone down before my last hook gets healed. That means only 1 person works on a gen at a time. He only ever occupied 1 person at a time, which seems odd.
---
&gt;because your wasting your own time on nothing. 
---
15 minute queue times...
---
&gt;wasting time

Yes but you cant choose the trap, and the key point you keep glossing over is that it enables tunneling to an extreme point. Yes, it allows the others to complete gens, but people basement bubba facecamp, this will just be a "Oh great its a ADDON pig, hope the rng worked for me "

Rank 13. Was trying to get into high ranks but you could see why I stoped trying.

LMAOOOO Must‚Äôve been survivor mains ngl. I play both sides because I‚Äôm given both sides so I rarely bait unless I‚Äôm trying to get extra bp. The only time to date in my 4 months was trying to get these people on that one Macmillan estate with the building in it to get and finish a gen
---
I‚Äôm stuck on rank 8-14 because of the rank and inconsistent time on the game. I‚Äôd say this was rank 10
---
nurse is still the best killer in the game and there are several viable killers, this is common knowledge for most of the playerbase. why must some people continue to act as if this isn‚Äôt the case?
---
I'm not even sure what he was trying to do
---
What other reason could it be?
---
Dumb question but where does it generally spawn? I think I‚Äôve only seen in the school basement or down at the end on one of the roads. Are those the most common?
---
so im not the only one ! im almost positive its a girl but regardless what i say i could be insulting them so oh well
---
I just had a match where I waited 10 minutes in a lobby to play against a Wraith who cloak camped the hook I was on just to knock me down immediately because I ran them around just a little too long at the start. People who play this game fucking suck. And the only killer I have run with anymore is Huntress but she has severe playability issues on console. I‚Äôm close to just putting away the game honestly
---
This also works if reversed
---
Me: Walks into the basement to save my teammate.
---
Bubba: YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!
---
Ok Bing Bonger
---
No... there‚Äôs always 4 people in that situation. Stay and tbag, stay and try to help, leave ASAP, or a mix of the 1st 2.
---
It‚Äôs a mask not sunglasses
---
yeah, the basement of the school is where it spawns, like, 90% of the time. in my experiences, at least. asides from there its also common for it to spawn on the roads. but deffo the school most of the time
---
There is no red add-on that increases recovery speed.
---
oh yes
---
I agree with the crows but disagree for the take on extra gen progress for a camping killer, I actually had a suggestion whereas a survivor would earn points for activities while being chased in addition to being within X meters from the killer while in the dying/hooked state to allow that player to have a chance at ranking up.
---
I love how for some reason, both my comment and your reply to it have enough down votes to be in the negative. 
---
By.mer people don't like the truth. 
---
It's so much simpler to say absolutely nothing when you're upset about something in a videogame than to push you bullshit onto some stranger online. Why would that be a truth people wouldn't like?
---
He was making fun of you because you didn't put Joe*y*
---
Passive : SHE DUMMY THICC MY DUDE
---
Because being an extremely sneaky killer and an over-exposing player is too much
---
&gt;When a killer stands within 24 meters of a hooked survivor for 30 seconds gen progression speed for all survivors is doubled for 30 seconds after the timer is completed. every additional 10 seconds the killer is within 24 meters will also be added to the timer if the killer breaks a pallet or damages a gen or interacts with their belongings the timer pauses during the interaction If the killer is in a Chase with another survivor within the 24 meters that also pauses the timer
---
How about this, when the killer is further than 24 meters of a hooked survivor, the sacrifice progression is 2x faster? 
---
I love how people are always trying to punish killers for staying "near" a hooked survivor instead of trying to come up with smarter ways to force killers away from it. Devs had the right idea with BBQ but because of inexperienced players complaining, they added unnecessary counters to it.
---
On console jumping jacks means it‚Äôs safe and none means **no**
---
***NO***
---
I would love to paint more mighty Oink Goddess art, but I sadly may not be able to until midway next year D: I also want to paint the Nurse too, cause how could I not!
---
You really need to focus on multihooking survivors and playing more aggressively instead of defending hooks.  You're going to struggle to pip period once you're out of potato ranks.

---
That would actually be pretty cool. Seasonal rewards are welcomed in most games and it rewards players to keep playing instead of just losing the rank they went for/achieved every time with no kind of reward. They've introduced charms, maybe we could get those with the color depending on rank
---
It was the endgame with an open exit gate.  Just for context.
---
A bioshock level would make me wet.
---
Fun fact: 
---
If all survivors DC, the killer also depips.
---
I expected Trapper to accidently walk into his own trap, dropping you before the hook, but this is even better
---
please dont give BHVR ideas they can barely handle their game balance without this
---
On mobile you dont really need to buy auric cells. You can get them for free by getting prestige on your characters, completing daily and weekly rituals, and from log in calendars. I actually saved up so many auric cells that I'm going to buy ghostface tomorrow. And the game is probably laggy because of your internet connenction, i play it smoothly on 60 fps.
---
You know, Ghost Face is into choking and straps too uwu
---
I played her yesterday on console multiple times.
---
Yes it's a bit weird that you have to wait for her power after using it and in chases it sucks sometimes a little bit and sometimes very hard. But in my opinion it's not that crazy, sure it's a nerf, but she is still strong. 
---
I hate that the 3rd blink add-on is completely useless because she can't teleport trough object's and that's very bad for her, so I think I will never use it. But I love the add-on where you get 6,4 m/s movement speed after a hit! That makes fun and often the survivors don't realise it fast enough and with some mindgames you get them fast down
---
I dont get why you being toxic to a toxic group needs a post
---
How did Nea survive the hit after getting unhooked?

Tesbag, probably.

You are the bad guy!

&gt;Imagine thinking Billy is comparable to Freddy
---
If Billy can be compared with Freddy in terms of skill depends on experience with both characters, preferred playstyle, and if said person is more of a strategist (Wraith, Freddy, Doctor) or mechanic (Billy, Huntress, Nurse)
---
Its sometimes Nea too
---
lol fuck off, she was THE answer to strong swf teams.

Now shes cucked on large maps and her time to down is drastically reduced if the map has a lot of debris or a strong structure.

  Very inconsistent, but it's ok they'll nerf all the high tiers and as the last point of revenge they will turn all the pallet loops into hawkins lab pallets so yall can enjoy that.

Playing the victim when killers have continuously been buffed and survivors have continuously been nerfed doesn‚Äôt really work, it just makes you look desperate.

There are a lot of rank 20 smurfs tho. Keep it clean brotha'!

‚ÄûScammed‚Äú indicates intention, malicious intent.

It‚Äòs rather a bug.

Is that all for real? I thought the game uses EAC which disallows using such scripts. You won't get banned for it?

Maybe something like Rapture, or an aquarium

Nurse was nerfed A LOT. If you think that current nurse can be compared to omegablink or fragile wheeze+ attaxic respiration nurse than you haven't played her at all. She is still good but only if you are very good on her.
---
Take the Borrowed Time-ish hit then use the slow heal and run, that should work
---
I agree but they did it the whole game even with two hexes so it was too satisfying not to share xD
---
As others have said, I think it's kinda fine it works that way. They get *approximate* knowledge of your location in exchange for you knowing exactly where they are and when they have this information since you can see their aura when it's active.
---
Pipping gets harder, the higher you get in ranks. Gold or iridescent lightbringer is not going to be enough later on.
---
Love it!
---
Randomly after restating the game around 15 times they reappeared. Out of curiosity, which cosmetics of yours disappeared?
---
Other killers being complete trash doesn't mean other killers don't need help.
---
Kills do not equal pips. 
---
You can get to red ranks with 0 kills and reach r1 with 1 kill per match. 
---
Don‚Äòt blame the devs just because you don‚Äòt know how emblems work lmao
---
Exactly.
---
it‚Äôs always nice the first time!
---
Past 9 PM Euro time I get less than a minute wait time across ranks 15 to 8ish.
---
 Other times up to 5 minutes, but almost never longer.
---
These Killer Perks are extremely overpowered. It's like someone just plays Killer despite being Red Ranks at both. Just because of personal preferences like the Ruin unnecessary buff.
---
If the glass shards on her glow it means she is using her power.
---
I hit red ranks without knowing a lot of basic things, You'll start to understand it more as you play. As for killer chases you want to force them to follow you as you run directly away, Most of them are capped at 115% movement speed so any horizontal movements that the killer can use to catch up faster are dead giveaways. Perks like sprint burst would be negated if the killer doesn't have to navigate around obstacles. Lithe (feng min perk) would probably help you out a bunch since windows would usually put the killer in a situation where he'd have to walk around the window before pursuing you-thus allowing you to effectively use that new found distance to possibly lose the killer. Unfortunately the more you play the faster you'll see the pool of killers drain to spirit and billy

---
Exactly, it‚Äôs their own fault for not focusing on the Generators whilst the Killer wastes precious time sitting on one Survivor on a hook. There‚Äôs no point attempting to rescue other Survivors when a Killer‚Äôs camping, most of the time it results in another hooked Survivor, more wounded and more time wasted when the Survivors should simply stick together and finish the Gens off.
---
Hitting the Nea and giving her a sprint boost was a mistake.

And there's people complaining about the new swf matchmaking system, I think it's perfect, of you want to play with a potato friend or play with a red rank killer know your risks
---
Between the shaved facial hair and noticeable arm hair I think it‚Äôs pretty safe to say that‚Äôs a guy.
---
I bought 33 tiers.............. LIKE A FUCKING DUMBASS!!
---
Report her, she didn't DC. It's literally the first line of the Claudette Manual; "It doesn't matter which down it is, but you must disconnect just as the killer gets to your body to pick you up, ESPECIALLY if you just made a cocky play." 
---
Clear infringement
---
I know but it's because they intentionally DC before we can get our rightfully earned bloodpoints so we can't get them cause this happens almost once every 2 games and I just don't have the motivation to play anymore
---
Wtf
---
Nah dedicated servers are absolute shit. Getting hit through dead hard and not getting my exhaustion back. Getting hit through windows and around corners. I have great internet and ping is always 70s or better but they‚Äôre just garbage.
---
this is comedy genius

Never seems to affect me ü§î

Jeez they threaten to suspend your account because you complained about losing everything after a match you should have won

Does it?

Can‚Äôt believe she has to be executed irl now ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It just annoys me how instead of fixing a bug where you lose everything in that match they add a battle pass and cosmetics
---
??? well that surely wasn't the case here
---
bruh.
---
You can accumulate chaser emblem point just by staying hidden in the killer hearbeat radius. 
---
If you do enough gens and bones you will easily get Iridescent lightbringer emblem. 
---
Even if you don't unhook yourself your teamate, the first three unhooks are shared amongst the whole team as Benevolent emblem points, which gives you the gold emblem.
---
And if you don't die during the first part of the match you'll get gold unbroken emblem too.
---
You don't need to be a good looper to pip.
---
Can someone explain to me what just happened? Never played the game it really looks interesting
---
What can you do? The laws the law... I'll be selling popcorn at the execution if anyone wants some

Well, no. Mind game in games is literally the normal definition of psychological mind game, pretty much every high level streamer agreeds to that according to how they've tried to define a mind game. Also, it's not that hard to check fighting games' forums to see that their definition of a mind game is the same. Since fighting games have the most mind games it's reasonable to say that their community knows something about them. Even Scott later said Spirit indeed have mind games despite denying that at the start. Claiming otherwise just shows that u either know shit about the topic or just try to manipulate the facts to get it your way.
---
The whole point of mind games is to make it as believeble as possible so the enemy can't realise he's being mind gamed.  That's the point where every mind game is heading towards, probably the best seen in cards games like Hearthstone, Gwent or MtG where by doing a certain play  u make the enemy think that u either do or don't have a certain card  to play, making him make a play basing on that assumption  that u can punish. It requires  some basic game knowledge to pull off but in no means require 'skill' 100% of the time. 
---
Also, 50/50 is an example oa guessing game. Mind game is not. Every mind game require opponent to guess in the end, but the  basics of pulling of a mind game and a guessing game are totally differen since.
---
Thanks! It‚Äôs my ‚ÄòI just started playing Huntress and have nothing better‚Äô build!
---
both sides think she is broken. lol you are just sad you wont have your 4k with no brain anymore
---
This is excellent üëå
---
God, Yes. I was nice to some clearly new survivors just the other day because I was so deranked from decay, and because of this I made a new friend.
---
The best way to learn how to play is watching streamers honestly. Scott Jund and zubatlel are amazing killers. Tru3ta1ent is ok if you can sit through the constant complaining but he plays both sides and rotates through killers and kind of teaches along the way.
---
Some skins stop this though
---
Now thats kind of a good idea but I'm not sure if I can trust bhvr
---
I'll trade you. Got chased by the killer for literally the entire game and didn't get a pip
---
-10IQ*
---
Yeah, I feel that, and have regrettably found myself doing such in the past. It's easy to not like the odd guy out, even though they're just playing the game. Now, I try to encourage folks to just GG a good killer, and only even comment if they were unfairly tunneled/camped, as I can understand the frustration with that in particular.
---
One dude didn't wiggle on me (i think he was afk?) so I took my chances and just ran around with him on top in good fun. Then I realised it must be scummy thing to do, so I dropped him. 
---
But damn it was fucking funny just going around while holding someone lmao.
---
Yeah, LOL.
---
‚ÄúShe is still good but only if you are very good on her.‚Äù
---
...which was the whole point of the re-work. Anyone with a working brain could easily down Survivors with omega-blinks and zero recharge between them. Now she actually requires you to have decent aiming/timing/mind gaming skills to be consistently good, and people who haven‚Äôt gotten good at her are able to be looped/mindgamed.
---
That‚Äôs people‚Äôs only major complaint with Spirit so far is that she‚Äôs impossible to mindgame half the time if she‚Äôs using Stridor/Prayer Beads and a decent headset.

Iron will, self care, dead hard, wglf

Her hitboxes are so busted, sometimes they go completely through survivors thanks to dedicated servers, sometimes they hit them through a wall.

Has hex in his name I‚Äôm not surprised he‚Äôs toxic as shit

Well bond helps find others and can tell you when a survivor is coming near
---
empathy can tell you where someone is if they‚Äôre injured
---
Kindred I would say is a must because it shows if the killer is camping plus it lets survivors know who is going for the save or if anyone is
---
Windows of opportunity is great to know where pallets and windows are
---
In my opinion bond and kindred is a must (others may say empathy over bond)
---
Replace claudettes with Jane and the meme becomes a 10/10
---
He not a nurse main nor did I see him stomping strong groups. The only Nurse gameplays I saw from him was with omegablink infectious fright slug build or simply stomping potatoes. Unless you have a link to share it's not valid for me
---
i don't think new animations for repairs would be my priority, tbh. how many people actively stare at what the characters are doing while on a gen?
---
If you haven't bought the premium pass and when you level up, but its just that blank box. Does it actually tell you to claim your reward?
---
One of them legacy p3, noone I versed was new. There is no reason whatsoever to belive that Nurse still can win on highest play.
---
Bond is excellent for situational awareness. Knowing where and what your teammates are up to will help you make much more educated choices.
---
Windows of opportunity is great for newer players but it's kind of a "training wheels" perk. After gaining more map knowledge you will be able to get a good idea of where the pallets/windows are and you won't need it anymore.
---
Yeah like old ds, removal of vacuum, more complex fast vaults, mettle of man nerf, exhaustion not recovering while running, healing taking a lot longer 
---
Not trying to say these didn't needed to be nerfed BTW. They were broken
---
To be fair, there is some blame on the devs and the game's tutorial for not explaining this shit properly.
---
Saying spirit is OK because survivors can run iron will or spine chill is not an argument. In that case old ds was fine because killers could have just ran enduring right?
---
Even if she got the unhook it would have resulted in her getting downed (and then hooked). Unhooking right in front of the killer always works in the killers favour.
---
Nurse is still better than spirit
---
That shouldn't be too bad, compared to the 700 I originally expected

Well 3 years of 0 changes is a lot and yes i do pay attention, ive played since the beginning and some variety would be cool

You know, because it is *NICE*.
---
I think it could be better in that every additional person in a party puts that party‚Äôs rank up by one I.e. a rank 12 survivor in a swf of 4 people would be classed as a rank 8; rank 8 in a 3 would be a 5 etc.
---
Imagine bandaging a hole in your shoulder

Why does the demogorgon have huntresse's head
---
LUIGI NO DONT DO IT
---
You can tell by the fact his shadow isn't even casting his legs.

Bond. I still run bond at rank 1 on all my survivors. Gets heals easy, you can help speed up a gen someone is on, and not sandbag you‚Äôre team mates when running the killer so they can focus on gens. Also running open handed is something you could run when playing with them to give them that 8 meter boost.
---
Welcome to hell
---
Dont forget that you can get 300xp per first survivor/killer game of the day. Not saing that this will make a huge difference but over the course of the 70 days the rift stays active this will give you 4 rift levels. Meaning you can deduct 52 matches from those 455 you mentioned.
---
Boring. I would hope they spend thier energy somewhere else.
---
Only after we get the smiling Ghostface mask from Scary Movie.
---
No problem! Good luck out there!
---
Well i am looking forward to seeing it!
---
Bond, spine chill, dead hard and borrowed time.
---
Bond Is great for situational awareness, knowing the location of teammates within 32 metres is huge.
---
Spine chill nullifies stealth killers like ghostface or crouched pig. The range it works is also larger than 32 meters so it will often give you an earlier warning as to when the killer is coming.
---
Dead hard is kinda hard to use for dodging attacks, I use it for the quick speed boost to extend a loop or just make it to a vault or pallet.
---
Borrowed time pretty much garentees a safe rescue and is indespensable when dealing with a proxy camper.
---
Your post appeared in my search results
---
Kindred is a good one as well. When you get hooked let‚Äôs all the other survivors know where they are.  Can help newer teammates decide who is the best to come for the save and let‚Äôs them know the killer left and isn‚Äôt too close.
---
I just don't use reddit. Only here to support a friend.

Yes and sorry for the spelling mistake
---
I‚Äôve had many times where I didn‚Äôt even have to move to see both gates.

This happened to me twice. Once we actually entered the match but it DC'ed immediately. I'm guessing because no killer was present?

What really gets me is that you can just let go of the button to cancel setting your trap :/
---
oh yea, im sure everyone has had their match like this one lmao
---
You're joking right? Survivors have held all the cards vs every killer except nurse for a long time, and now that's changed you're still complaining?
---
Those are lies she didn‚Äôt draw cp

to be fair, the other person that died, died while the exit gates were powered and the trapper was face camping them, so im sure she thought the same would happen here lmao

I'm currently rank 9. At least so far it's not getting much harder to pip, the games just become less enjoyable as the skill gap between me and everyone else in the lobby grows more apparent.

oh, so you twisted that line to fit your agenda, gotcha. too bad isn't referring to throw bottle repeatedly to a single target as "targeting specific users to ruin their game experience". It means follow a player over multiple games and make sure he never get a chance to do anything, kinda like stream sniping.

You tell me to go back to elementary when you cannot even understand a statement like that. Are you still in school? if yes, stick with it, you really need education if you cannot understand something that simple. If you're not, you're just a dishonest "person" who will twist anything to make sure to be right. If was like you said, **ANY** person who, unintentionally tunnelled somebody would get punished, something that doesn't happen.

When I do play survivor it's always the fucking Meg that farms me or other survivors followed by the Dwight. I never ever see a Adam and Davids seem to be the only smart survivors.

It‚Äòs actually well explained in their forums which are linked in every ingame pop-up for nee patches.

But what about those yellow rank killers who get destroyed by one single guy that can stay in a case for the whole game while the other 3 sit on gens?

Never seen a ton of Nurse, what‚Äôs omega blink Nurse?

Oh no i havent convinced the legendary ichdrope

It‚Äôs latency, not hitboxes.

I mean as someone who plays killer a lot, being viable/strong isn‚Äôt the problem. The problem is the lack of actual effective counter-play against her.

I wasn't, but got it anyway, bro

Goddamnit I'm reading all this in Internet Historian's voice.

One of most fantastic mask I've seen yet, I really feel like I'm going to get stabbed af. Awesome work !

I‚Äôm in the same boat.

I don‚Äôt play killer a lot because of the long queue line, which then lowers my rank, which then adds more time to my queue. Until finally I don‚Äôt really open dead by daylight anymore.

Imagine, someone laying in the grass. You won't see anything.

You can also watch YouTube channels and see how they play the game to get tips and pointers... I like Ohmwrecker as he isnt too OP but is still a good player

Except not lmao. Damn you're wasting a lot of time here, go get a job or something. Lose some weight. Do somethin with your life.

Ez to see ds coming ngl

It's also divided up into regions so maybe that might be a problem

Why are you so goddamn toxic.

lmao

That's not cheating, so no

Can you share the timings?

oh yeah lol

I think neither effect is really balanced. But the point is, Adrenaline rewards the survivor for being good, NOED rewards the killer for being bad... Yeah you see my view to the two perks lol
---
Gone, reduced to atoms

For the rare Dcs yes, 4ks no, they are pretty easy once you know what you are doing, at long as you arent playing against swf.

See if you can round some people up for kill your friend training

She played a bit weird but that could explain a lot. I didn't look at her perks tho. It was a pretty quick match and only saved this clip

People use the chat to test their lag to the host or server. Some people say 1 2 3 or just smash the keyboard.

Yeah nah it's cool, like I said it's not malicious or anything. Just kind of groan-worthy to most of us. :P

Helping the killer as survivor is still against the rules

I've eaten so many meals on the hook. I live on the hook.

Any joke would be if you hear it too many times xD

Trouble aiming?

You sure? Her mother died when she was seven, have you even seen any video about Huntress or even had the time to spend a couple of minutes to read her lore? lmao
---
Sure. I'm also a princess
---
No to mention EGC is too kind to trappers, hags, wraiths. There needs to be something to offset that for survivors.
---
Nurse with the add ons that gave her 5 blinks.
---
being a pig main I can say I like the way she is now. The only change I would make is to not let survivors see the jigsaw boxes until the timer is low

I did this when I was new, not knowing wraith could interact with things while invisible.

Say what now

She's still kinda on the weaker side though

Lol how is it not?

"GRIEFING: INTENTIONAL GAMEPLAY ABUSE

Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates

Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience

Holding the game hostage"
---
And that's something to report it for "working with the killer" not cheating

Next time before you prestige make sure you have a lot of bloodpoints so you can quickly level up.
---
I regret prestige because is not worth it for me
---
Griefing ‚â† cheating
---
The ‚Äúcirclejerk‚Äù is bc there‚Äôs way too big a window to play badly against Nurse and get away unpunished
---
I actually thought someone was jumping out of the locker with head on to knock the survivor out of her arms.
---
Yes because Killer dailies are hillariously easy :&lt;
---
Regardless, without BBQ and playing a Killer that might not get that much of a BP scoring (for example Freddy or Pig), that daily will most likely been wasted anyway. Simply because a 30k game with BBQ would give you literally the same amount.
---
Love it when people act like they know what they're talking about but obviously don't.
---
For me i don't have any issue with stuttering or lag but i don't get disconnected every 2-3 game.
---
Keep in mind it only happens when i play killer.
---
I have no issue whatsoever playing survivor. It does kinda demotivate me to even go into a killer gamer
---
I‚Äôve been well clear of a window many times to take an invisible hit.
---
The thing is that youtubers like them have access to all the perks while baby players like OP and me have to do with 1-2 perks slots and no consumables.
---
Basically every random teammate ever
---
It is cheating, it makes it impossible for him to get the hatch since the they guy can‚Äôt bleed out so try again
---
This is from this page:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system)

The above is from the section of bannable offenses, so it definitely is cheating
---
Once you go Mad Grit, you never go back
---
Camping isn‚Äôt toxic tho?
---
Tbh you should start with survivor. Killer is way harder since every little mistake cost more than a mistake as a survivor that can rely on a team, even just being meat shield
---
Start with survivor, look what killers do and take the best out of them. When you're a decent rank, like on purple, pick killer and use what you learnt against survivors.
---
Pick up killer first is too much, with bad matchmaking and swf having priority in queues, your experience will just be hell
---
Oh my god how are those guys called in Bioshock?
---
This, I use to have no wait in off hours, but now its 20 min to get a game.  The changed something after legion or around the plague.  Id rather have a laggy match than no match.
---
When the exit gates are open that's absolutely just fine. It's game over at that point, going anywhere else isn't going to help secure a kill because survivor is standing 2 feet away from the exit point. Even hitting them would push them out.
---
How is this toxic
---
OP rescued his teammate from the meat hook while the killer tried to hit the unhooked person (which doesn't work until they're properly off the hook). However, when trying to escape, OP stepped in a bear trap set by the killer and got placed on the hook himself. However, you have a 4% base chance to get off the hook when you're first placed there by trying to escape on your own (with a base of three attempts). OP managed to get off the hook on the third (and final) attempt and run out the exit gate while the killer was busy resetting that bear trap.
---
Yes, it's griefing bot cheating
---
Yeah that's what I said
---
Ds tier 3 last 60 seconds
---
Looks great
---
Wait so you're saying she's fun and useable simply because of her stupid hitboxes?
---
As a good Huntress that knows how to punish Survivors, you do NOT need those hitboxes. You're not supposed to hit Survivors around corners when your abillity punishes vaults and pallets almost for free.
---
But ofcourse, lots of Huntress players that rely on that would become salty because they'd be forced to play her properly now instead of relying on server rng. But that's the same that went with Nurse since the rework. "omg she's ded, Spirit op lul". 
---
But then they realised that it was only really impactful on the wannabe Nurse's that kept short blinking the shit out of everyone.
---
The hatchet hitbox was and probably always will stay the bullshit it is. Sadly.
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That it's griefing not cheating
---
I know, but I don't think it should stay active for the whole 60 seconds if the killer hooked someone else in the meanwhile.
---
The Legion to Myers: Did you bring a pipe to kill people

Myers: *bonk*

It's definitely a delicate balance.  I just don't think it was that bad before the 3.2 update.  The 3.2 update that caused BHVR's reactionary swing from one extreme to the other was terrible and I felt awful going against Nurses that didn't blink and Shapes that didn't stalk.  And I feel the same way playing killer now going against a pair of rank 2's and the rank 15+ friends they're trying to introduce to the game.
---
A minor passive could be interesting, although you could argue that killers got that with their powers, so make it a survivor only thing?
---
Also balancing and BHVR are not two things we should combine for more things.
---
Well nerfed...It depends on the view. But if you wanna keep the broken purge none will ever allow you use if you don't bring apples, sure, go for it.
---
But then I don't wanna see any Plague mains complaining why she sucks lol.
---
This is awesome!
---
Do you have these as pictures? I'd love to use the Meg one as my profile pic on Steam :P
---
Hatch either spawns in the middle of the road outside the school near the fence or under the school
---
And dont even try to open r34....
---
Looks dope OP!
---
If it glows it goes. Better get it out of the way now before finding out it‚Äôs devour hope. Besides if you do it when no one is being chased you can just hide for a few mins it‚Äôs not hard
---
Most people: Fuck my team I want 1500 bps

---
If you ask me he never made jason, He made a deformed kid that fucking drowned and thats it. He didnt make sack wearing jason, and sure as hell disnt make the hockey mask wearing jason we know now.
---
I play him without NOED tho :(
---
You‚Äôre correct their, but in that same sense if you‚Äôre playing with randoms they don‚Äôt care about what happens to you. The majority will go out of their way to farm/sandbag you for free points
---
Right, shouldnt stay active, anyway 60 seconds is not much time
---
Dude yeah, facecampers. I‚Äôve made it to red ranks, still get a potpourri of ranks and the killers tend to sit there and make eye contact while you‚Äôre hooked nowadays... even as recently as a month ago I didn‚Äôt have to deal with facecampers
---
Meh-g Mains can [DONG] off. Small Hitbox Abusers. That‚Äôs why I counted Ace Mains as well. Steve Mains are the real Pros
---
What the fuck is this furry looking cartoon and why are so many memes spawning from it
---
I honestly struggle the most with legion. I‚Äôm a low rank Dwight (rank 16) player, so he kinda just runs my shit over. I try to use any of my perks and discordance just ruins all of my fun. The worst part is that I haven‚Äôt learned how to properly loop a killer that isn‚Äôt huntress, so I‚Äôm even more screwed when legion just leaps over my pallet
---
Moris get complained about literally all the time...
---
This would be perfect for The Fisherman from I Know What You Did Last Summer
---
Isn't it a comedy show? Idk never seen it
---
Dope!
---
No, you edited your comment. It is cheating, as I have already pointed out via the link I posted. Why else is it a bannable offense?
---
It's technically an anime. also I think there's only a pilot it's not officially out
---
That‚Äôs the spirit of playing doc! Make them feel your pain!
---
Just close your eyes
---
I can feel the toxicity from here
---
I used to hate dead by daylight, I thought it was just a inferior version of friday the 13th. Well look at us now.
---
The point is more that SWF do shit like this A LOT.
---
Your fault. Not theirs
---
Especially now with the EGC they should really take a look at this.
---
Like, if you know that the Killers know about the hatch's wherebeing, it's a legit thing to wait at the exit gate and open it up immediately once the hatch has been closed.
---
But when the Killer is sort of mobile while the gates are literally just 20 to 30 metres away from each, not a single Survivor should make it out when the Killer ain't a absolute potatoe.
---
When Killers want a free win during EGC they should just get Whispers, it's a great perk anyway lol.
---
It really is some utter bullshit they have where it's blank for like 5-6 levels. The only time you get something is with the pass in those levels. at least throw us a bone bhvr.
---
Nope.
---
With Beads, she's just stupid. 
---
Without Beads, she's a very powerful killer. That's the target.
---
Name please
---
Yea, I play with the spirit a lot. She has ok games and then her good games. I've been also trying out some new builds to get better results.
---
&gt;she may be black but 
---
Lmao is that a bad thing?
---
'this effect is canceled when the affected survivor changes health state' maybe read the whole description before complaining...
---
Happened to me too. They were right in front of me in plain sight, no obstructions between us at all, and I just couldn't stalk them
---
Or just the moment it‚Äôs used no matter if you get downed or not, you go gain one health state after the 8 seconds timer is up
---
Nice cosplay, sucks you have no legs but eh immersion
---
Please tell me you have that meg art as a photo? I really really love that!
---
It‚Äôs gotten completely ruined hand more benefits to killers
---
Entity: laughs in de pip
---
Biker Kate all day everyday!
---
Where exactly did you shit on my arguments. All I see is you filling this feed with petty paragraphs.
---
There's always slugging that helps. As long as the gens aren't being done. I think the killer that gives survivors the most issues are Doctor and trapper. They have great speed and awesome potential to be very annoying.
---
Hazbin hotel according to the other comments
---
Yeah but I mean, that's not really the killer's fault. 
---
I always target survivors that farm others, just like this Claud right here. She had NO reason to go for an unhook when the killer is literally 10m away. Is not like the hooked survivor was on struggle phase or whatever, just lead the killer away from the hooked one and let someone else save the teammate. 
---
If I was in the position of OP I would do the same, wait a bit to try to punish the Claud for her stupid and selfish decision.
---
People run right up to you during a chase because it fucks with auto aim
---
Is this getting downvoted by pink-haired Neas with flashlights
---
What if the killer doesn‚Äôt give chase as you try to lead him away? Then what? Lose progress towards emblems because the killer wants to play like a scumbag?
---
thats keysmashing, its like a gen z version of lmao or lol or just generally representing feelings you cant really explain.
---
Same but with Steve, I think it's bugged
---
I remember when I was a baby meg and a Huntress just helped me farm and let me go
---
This doesn't really have a lot to do with swf. All it has to do is with a cocky player, your point was irrelevant.
---
True. I went on a 3 hour stint of playing with the demogorgon because everyone boasts about him being really good. So I was switching loadouts, playing differently each and every match. This match just boggled me on how I didnt even pip. There were games where I pipped with him and believe I got destroyed. I don't really think he's that good of a killer. He's like Freddy and Hag, but I've used both of them and dominated. Maybe it's the demogorgons speed that sucks. I personally think he is slow, regardless of what they say his speed is. I feel he's just a little faster than the nurse at times.
---
Thank you for commenting, i know it‚Äôs after 16 seconds, and I just think they should balance it up a bit again...
---
Perks and add ons that effect healing speed effect the timer.  Base is 16 seconds.  Botany knowledge and a needle add on can reduce it to like 8 seconds.  You want to do it at a strong loop or after taking a hit for someone being carried so you can make sure.  
---
It would also cancel if you healed before it took effect but that is probably more obvious to you. 
---
Always fully read the item/perk/power description so you aren‚Äôt running around confused.
---
Like how he's got a 3 stack on we're going to farm forever, so he isn't only farming
---
You could use your mouse wheel instead quite easier to use than the space
---
You instantly die, no struggle, no first phase
---
Do-It-Yourself Quick &amp; Quiet
---
How is an item that heals you while you run passively a benefit for the killer?  Yes it is less strong than instant heal but you can pop this and keep running as long as your not brain dead or out in the open you will heal passively.  You can even speed up the timer with perks and add ons...
---
It‚Äôs an original killer but yeah very Purge-y. They are like a little murder cult of teenagers being led by an older manipulative leader.
---
Is that a guy? Lmao
---
cool drawing! at first i thought she was flipping me off tho haha
---
Not ‚Äòthe demogorgang‚Äô?
---
If he was just "a little faster than the nurse" he wouldn't be able to catch up to anyone. You might feel that way because he is larger than most killers. 
---
Demogorgon is actually underrated, a lot of people think demo is bad, I think he is solid mid tier. You shouldn't compare demo to hag or Freddy though, they play so differently,
---
Exactly. It's only a few people that can actually put on that map pressure and still get kills. Some killers get kills but aren't good at pressure, and vice versa. It's only a few that can actually do both. And yes, it depends on your survivors too. I've been trying to figure out a build thatcslows the game without ruin... I'm getting close, but the games are close as well. The lower ranks, they still have the ability to gen rush and they also come in with maps to destroy your totem fast. You have to have good defense on your totem and the gens to keep them in long games.
---
No problem.  I ran this the other night to play around with it and two games it saved me in a chase I used it right after I dropped a pallet and then kept running and made it to a widow,  playing around that for a few seconds and right before I got hit down I healed.  Keep the chase going. I was running botany knowledge so the heal was more like 10-12 seconds instead of 16.  
---
Not as strong but still pretty decent
---
Do you have any sort of proof of source on this?
---
Source.
---
If the game does it‚Äôs normally laggy bs you can get hit from miles away.
---
You gain all the cells back. It is worth it even if the items are shit, which they are not.
---
This is so true though
---
She drew a teacher character (I believe) liking a student character but their age difference was like 2 years apart if I remember correctly. It was also many years ago. 
---
I think you can find longer and more accurate info just by googling. I personally am not sure about some of those accusations especially how old most of them are.

I also dislike Ruin but sometimes who your playing may need the slowdown.

I use pig with surveillance, Discordance, Pop goes the Weasel, and nurses. Pop + traps slows the game pretty good and the tracking perks help you now when to switch to gens being pressured or crouch and down someone who is healing. 
---
If you get a 3 gen it‚Äôs pretty much a win for sure.  
---
I honestly just dislike having perks get deactivated from me I like stuff that‚Äôs always working.  Big fan of brutal strength + enduring on basic killers like trapper.
---
Can confirm, she is my favorite and I hope she never gets nerfed, reworked or otherwise touched. She makes me so happy to play because I always screw over survivors with her traps and it honestly feels like the only way to escape me is by getting the hatch

I compared because his ability feels like both of them combined. But yes, to me, he doesn't seem all that fast. I think leatherface is faster than him. They say they have decent rates of chase, but remember, the pallets. Once you look down and back up after a break, the survivors are gone. And that's without sprint burst, balanced landing, lithe, and those crutch perks for extra speed. They even made the legion bad at getting around pallets, only person is the nurse still, or you have to equip brutal strength and other pallet perks to get around that to keep up with survivors. Now the trapper on the other hand, he has great speed along with brutal strength. His speed seems so much faster than the other killer. Like once he's on you, it's hard to lose him.

I plan on hitting at least level 50. So I get about $6 back so it cost me $4 for all those sweet items..That Trapper mask @ lvl 27 I really want. The full Wraith set and full Nurses set are nice. Anything past 50 is just a bonus if I finish. So for me  it is a def yes. Don't buy levels though. That's just wrong at a buck a level.  I heard one guy say he plans to make it to 60 and buy the rest of the levels with the $10 we gets back. I love having a reason to play. I had days where I would play 2 or 3 games that had me frustrated and I would hop off for the day. Now I just don't care and do my best to get 1 and a half levels in rift a day. Win win.  Please don't @ me. It is my choice. I like a reason to play and a reason to help my friends if they need help complaining challenges.
---
This is what it feels like to be a microwaved hot pocket
---
Let me tell you a shocking secret: ***You can pip even if you don't get a red emblem in Altruism.***
---
Amazing, right?
---
So yeah, going mindlessly for the unhook like this Claud just because *"I lose points in Altruism"* is just a stupid excuse. It can get you downed or killed and it will not only cost you your precious Altruism points, but also points in the other categories that you would get by just ignoring the killer and focusing on the game.
---
A large part of it is confirmation bias
---
Perfect UwU
---
Don't cleanse and try to stick to a solid loop. As long as your team does not cleanse very often she isn't that bad.
---
It's funny, in my opinion she is a top tier killer, the only thing keeping her in check is how hard flashlights counter her, they can literally destroy her map pressure and hook camping potential. I believe that's why people kind of underrate her in general. One of the best killers with the easiest counterplay
---
No offence but legion is a boring ass cosplay
---
Im really surprised no one mentioned demogorgon. Demo's footsteps are loud so you hear them while you're being chased, and you hear its growls whenever it injures one of your teammates across the map.
---
You go straight to struggle, I think
---
You turn your mouse back so you look behind you and in the same time you press S and let go W to keep running the same direction as before.
---
They are unhooking multiple survivors 3 feet away from killer, what are you supposed to do: let them get away? At best slug everyone, but still hit and down them. With 1 gen left, unhooks that close back to back, and everyone still alive you have little choice.
---
Yea, I just replied to someone about the trapper. And certain killers are good for gen protection. Usually when you get a 3 gen with any killer, it's bad for the survivors. But you have to let it get down to that point,  and that could get hard if the survivors actually fight through it.
---
What do you mean?
---
All the gens always pop up when the last one got finished?
---

My monitor is 144hz but I've never messed with the games files so it locks at 62. I've never noticed any jitter, frame issues or stutter. Maybe I should try unlocking it to see if it makes any difference.
---
Ruin + spirit or facecampers (on console)
---
Or you‚Äôll have DCers and the killer will try to end you with extreme prejudice.

This would not work because salty people would post anyone's name on there.

I have a feeling they are going to drop some of the grind. The feedback for lvl 4 is real. So I expect some changes.
---
I always cleanse, its just 60 seconds, which is better than leaving it and turning out yo be devour hope
---
A pop up. Instead of in the tutorial. That‚Äôs part of the problem, I don‚Äôt look at those pop ups myself, I‚Äôm sure a lot of other are the same
---
One time after the last gen was popped, I found a lit totem and thought, "Oh, NOED. Let's get rid of this." Turns out it was Haunted Grounds near one of the exit gates. I went down and was on death hook.
---
It's a new bug.
---
I will agree that her UR add-ons are basically joke add-ons, I feel like if you took away the downside of not blinking through objects, her 3 blinks would actually be worthy of UR, and the other add-on would be deadly if they made her 110% instead of 105%. Moving around at 110% speed with even just 1 blink as a decent Nurse is rather deadly.

Atleast ohm still plays the game
---
One of the first times I saw him he was up on a hill, looked afk. All three of us started fucking with him, wondering if he'd gone to the toilet or something, and started work on the gen about 10 metres in front of him. When we were about finished we heard what we would later identify as  the Tier-up sound, but I passed it off as "probably nothing". We hear it again, he starts coming towards us at speed, the game is over in seconds. Good times
---
Yes but the problem is brooch gives little to no reaction time wakazashi is 15 meter lunge (together with brooch this combo will negate any loop and have a cooldown of 3 seconds. In phase collisions makes it to easy for the spirit to find someone, which for a power this good it should be 100% prediction and smart thinking instead of the game telling you where they are
---
I've just started playing as Myers (PC)
---
Is this a bug?  Seems to work fine getting to Evil Within III first time, but after that it just doesn't refill even stood stalking in front of a survivor.
---
I wish legions gameplay was as good as your cosplay
---
Yeah that happens in any online multiplayer games at times. I will leave lobby with high yellow ping anymore
---
When I read this comment I looked at his shadow and pelted out laughing! If I could give you and award, I would.
---
Weird since your think them being directly in front of you would be the easier hit.
---
if you want easymode just get a kyf going
---
I believe that‚Äôs why they do it because aim assist fucks up BAD because of it
---
Don't forget Jeff, he has built in Stridor.
---
Exactly good teams will pressure the right gens and try to make you choose between ending a chase or defending the gen. That choice can win or lose the game for you
---
How do people not see the cloaked Wraith?
---
Anime is just animating on 3s it doesn't have to be Japanese

Not really, can you show me proof that each one isnt a tome? They said in the Q&amp;A that the event would only last 2 weeks.

Because it's literally griefing, do you see them cheating?
---
*Dwight please.*
---
WTF is r/dbdgonewild?
---
CJ Survivor DLC confirmed.
---
Yeah on PS4 purple and red ranks it seems like mostly billy, spirit, Myers, huntress and Freddy.  Every now and then I‚Äôll go against someone else.  I rotate a lot of killers but I mainly play pig
---
nice
---
Why was this even downvoted? üòÇ
---
Let's not forget Trapper.
---
Nvm I found the proof you are right I apologize I'm mistaken
---
I'm thinking of playing killer more and I'm thinking of getting Freddy with ruin,overcharge, pgtw, and discordance. Should I? And if I do i'ma need to get pgtw and discordance soon
---
Just reached rank 4, and i'm in the same situation as OP. If you say so...
---
Yep I see my flaw now I am incorrect I'm sorry, I thought each level was a tome. Why wouldnt they release all the levels at once?
---
WhO's YuRi?
---
Yuri tarted
---
Maybe because there is no skill in that and it literally denies Myer's addons? I remember how I was doing  Evil incarnate and people abusing lockers will have special place in hell.
---
It‚Äôs a game about survivors having to avoid being sacrificed to a big sky monster thing called the entity, where they take killers with powers like ‚Äòdream control‚Äô and ‚Äòshooting electrification shock fields‚Äô to hook them. But oh no their legs aren‚Äôt broken. I don‚Äôt think you understand how video games work. They‚Äôre not necessarily meant to realistic.
---
Just hide in a locker with head on and legion can never use his power on you. the mend time is short, if you play against good mindgamers and loopers you will lose alot of gens. His annoying to play against but not difficult
---
I believe they made this decision to make sure that players come back regulary.
---
I love how Piggy took a second to be like, "You satisfied? Okay, back to it, then."
---
Fair enough, but you can see how I would think you put cheating but griefing.
---
Also it is cheating as I have said, they broke the rules.
---
this is awesome ngl
---
I wanted to slap that Dwight so hard he would have landed on a hook
---
Soooo much better than a lot of the ones you see here
---
Also if I cosplay as Jeff will you please knife murder me?
---
Oh I don't disagree that it's boring for the survivor, it's just optimal play for the killer
---
Previously in the patch notes they said that they fixed it. It fixed it for me but it started again yesterday.
---
Im not saying camping during endgame isn't fine it's just pathetic that a red rank spirit got fucked so hard that they were forced to
---
Without Victor the franchise might have not existed in the first place.
---
I don't think that there is a solution for this.  
---
Some consider XY toxic, others AB, whereas many others say that YZ is bad. There are no rules against any of these, so they respond with the argument: "I play how I want to, it's nowhere forbidden." Some children do this, too, playing in kindergarten. Why should they try to understand what the other side feels, maybe show some empathy and don't be an ass (in common sense)? It's not about having fun with others for them, but only about themselves. These children are (depending on how bad their attitude is) called "socially unadapted". In school, work, whatever, they are either becoming outcasts or have to adapt to live a "normal" life. There are no such instances / punishments in this game.
---
A lack of empathy or common sense is not possible to change (I dare say so). But it's the same in real life.
---
So, if I encounter bad mannered people, looking at cute cat videos helps me. xD And obviously writing essays here that no one will ever read.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Yes, breaking the rules = cheating
---
The exact method of them breaking the rules (cheating) was  "Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates.
---
Alright
---
That's probably one of the coolest legion cosplays I've ever seen, you did a good job.
---
To quote you:
---
 "Stop being some kids crying about the world around u like a little bitch, start thinking on what u'r doing wrong and adapt." 
---
why do you have such a toxic way of speaking?
---
Joke Pork
---
Okay
---
Tbh people just expect to play against Spirit like with any normal killer and they actually shouldn't do that. All it takes is a  different play style and aknowledging things u can and cannot do.
---
Btw. there r ppl and even streamers complaining about those not willing to learn, with True being the first person I can think of. No idea why u would assume there aren't.
---
But he'll have lightborn
---
I love Trapper. That sound of a survivor caught in a trap brings a smile to my face. My fav killer to snowball with. I don't get sweaty with him. If I do good it's because I placed good traps. If I do bad it was because the survivors played correctly.  He could use a few QOL changes. I love his cosmetics too. I love a good trapper game.
---
Legion is in that regard just like Plague.
---
BOTH are capable of keeping Survivors injured. But what then?
---
While inexperienced / mediocre Survivors have a huge handicap with being injured, good players don't, reducing the efficiency of Legion's entire gimmick by a long-shot (since let's be real, the mend almost aint relevant anymore).
---
In the end, it's the same reason why Doctor is bad. Doctor's skillcheck shenanigans and anti-stealth is only good against Survivors that can't handle it. When you're up against Survivors that are capable runners while also not getting cucked by your stall cheese, you can't do shit.
---
Stall Killers besides of Freddy tend to have the issue that their stall becomes less efficient the better the Survivors are. Freddy applies percentage based slows with many of his add-ons, so his value is absolute and consistent. Especially when you combine it with let's say Ruin and / or Dying Light.
---
However there also ain't strong enough stalling Perks besides of Ruin that can actually compensate the Killers abillities. Legion and Plague might get the best value out of Thanatophobia, but Thanato sucks balls even when fully stacked as it makes a mere difference of 12,8 seconds per gen. Dying Light for example requieres to stack into late game and doesn't offer its potential value until you already got some hooks. And even then, it's worse than Thanato until you got DL's 6th stack.
---
Iridescent hatchet rework: any hit will give you one more hatchet.
---
nea for balanced landing loops. bill if you want to recuse your team8 from a camper (borrow time). Jake for iron will, great perk to use if you want to mind game the killer. Ace if you want to farm chests
---
I thought the idea was that the hatch could spawn absolutely anywhere. Bit if a shame reading this thread, it would be better that way.
---
I have noticed its tendency to spawn on roads though
---
It's not even a mindgame, it's a gamble.
---
Well, hacks are still a thing iirc, but I've never seen a Survivor altering a item in anyway. If people hack, they're mostly speed hackers to get free downs / escapes.
---
WHAT might be the case tho, is that the Survivor might've switched the Item in the very last second.
---
DbD has a meme for its spaghetti coding, as in, the more bugs are fixed, the more occur.
---
So it COULD be that the client realised a item-switch while the game / servers didn't, and thus displayed a toolbox for you instead of a key.
---
Just a theory tho.
---
I mean anyone can get 4ks against bad survivors. What rank are you?
---
Because having to mend is a mild annoyance, nothing more. 
---
If the Killer is playing Legion as intended they will tag a Survivor in Frenzy and then immediately leave to go after another, leaving that Survivor to spend 10 seconds mending before going back to work on the gen they were on. 
---
Looping is meta and as a standard speed Killer he has nothing to cut down loops aside from using perks. However most Legions go with a Sloppy/Thana healing slowdown, which further incentivises Survivors to stay injured and rush gens, running to the nearest loop when he comes over.
---
Lmaoooo
---
Maybe after taking lessons from Myers and Piggy, he decided to hit up Huntress?
---
For whatever reason I immediately knew that it was about a Huntress.
---
But actually I expected the typical "struck around corner" hatchet.
---
That they can actually bypass walls is new to me, but I'd take this over Iridescent Head 10 times a day lol.
---
I wouldn't say once ever 3 or 4 games is barely seeing it
---
‚ÄúUh, Nea‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe starring demon is at the gen‚Äù ‚ÄúWHAT, WELL DONT LET HIM WATCH!‚Äù
---
Glad to see someone else running a Babysitter - Distortion build üòÑ
---
Especially if you have deliverance, ds and unbreakable ready
---
I understand your frustrations. When I was a new killer I did not know any better.  At the endgame though anything goes.  I get FC by Bubba's and Wraith all the time. Just don't message them. Move on.
---
I don't main any role, I play both equally
---
Gonna habe to wrap this one up with a good ole "do bones" if you dislike noed so much :)
---
You knocked someone and knew two other survivors were within the area and instead of slugging you go for the pickup.  Ds is annoying and all but you misplayed here
---
I just want a perk that lets you place down a dummy hatch that sends survivors to a cell.
---
Easier said than done. Doing bones is a very easy counter but playing solo it's hard to keep track of how many are gone. That's why I think there should be a totem counter.
---
I agree. That would be a really nice QOL change.
---
I thought exactly the same thing when I saw that green locker!
---
The real Killer is your shadow. I'm at awe at the size of the complete unit.
---
It really is just kind of a grind at first that you have to deal with. It took me like 1 week before I started having good fun games, even though I knew I liked the game from the moment I started playing it. It's just about leveling up 1 Survivor enough to unlock some good perks. I started with Claudette because being able to self heal when your new is very helpful and then started using spine chill as soon as I got it. After that you can use bloodpoints you gain from survivors to level up a killer who's easy to learn with like hillbilly. Don't try and go into a killer game with only one to two perks.
---
My friends refuse to play this game because of how grindy it is.
---
Congratulations. I did it solo about a year ago. It was fun.  It's funny to me that I can play solo red rank games and have good randoms . I made it to rank 1 as killer. Doc btw. It was hell. Never again.
---
I did this challenge with no mither as well.
---
yea EU has that problem, russians always proxy camp and tunnel with freddy/spirit/huntress..they can't really fix the issue
---
Right? What kind of wizard is this killer? I get DCed on if they make any mistakes.  They RQ because it hurts their ego.
---
You can kick gens, pick survivor from the ground and open lockers while frenzied. What are talking about?!
---
No need here. Only 1/4 games with 4K tho but it‚Äôs ok
---
The reason why Doctor is categorized as "Hard" in terms of difficulty, is because the experience and overall skill as Killer becomes extremely essential once the Survivors are good enough to bypass your anti-stealth and stall shenanigans. Besides of the perfect timed zaps ofcourse.
---
But her overall gameplay is just...I don't know. The first approach as Wraith was pretty bad, she could've easily approach from the other side and bodyblock the pallet.
---
Like, I get it when people can get quite...Energetic, when it comes up to a game they're really competetive at.
---
But this Killer doesn't even seem to be aware of "high rank basics", so that amount of rage is even less justified than it already is.
---
Well you better hurry then rank reset in a couple of days. Gl!
---
Tbh they got farmed. There ds saved them.
---
Its the guy from spongebob!!!
---
You mean, a build of your best perks available... not much to chose from, but a good setup.
---
I've always thought that at the very least there should be a 4th level to perks only available to the survivor/killer whom it belongs to
---
There's so many factors though. The spirit could be new, running bad/no perks, SWF on mic's running crazyness with OoO. Ya never know.
---
When you get to 8-9 and get matched with 2-4 rank survivors you'll be happy if you just get bbq stacks :(
---
Wow you went from a decent person to an ignorant prick real quick. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs gonna ruin my chances of getting a pip all I‚Äôm saying is how can they allow a killer to dictate my pip points for saving when all they‚Äôd have to do is camp it
---
We're being downvoted for telling the truth. People want things to come way too easy and too fast. We have a rift that lasts 70 days and the FIRST PAGE is all that's out and we have people up in arms about the grind... Either they're really bad at the game and can't do the challenges or they want something to complain about per usual.
---
Lmao. You're literally playing against bad survivors, and yet you come in here saying "wow I got a couple 4ks with Legion, he must be the best killer in the game!" Sorry, that's not how it works. Go play a couple games with him at rank 1 and see how good he is.
---
She wasted so much time on that looper too xD
---
Am i the only one that actually wants Pamela Voorhees instead of Jason?
---
You received couple messages by whom should move on instead of messaging, and you say those messages don‚Äôt get you, but you are here, ranting about it. It clearly got to you and you couldn‚Äôt move on like those people. So you come here and rant about people who is not moving on, while you are not moving on.
---
Looks awesome! Did you make the mask?
---
Sounds like he was just vibing. Going for flashlight saves isn‚Äôt a wannabe Noob3
---
‚ÄúUnlucky‚Äù to not be able to exploit a known hatch-spawning bug??? Love the meme but it‚Äôs perfectly fair üòÇ
---
And that‚Äôs what my point is by saying it gives killers another benefit where as before it was instant. Now I gotta wait roughly 8 seconds and hope the ping doesn‚Äôt spike and cost me a hit
---
Urban evasion, Sprint burst, spine chill and then I usually switch up the last one but usually use empathy.
---
myers sexy tho....
---
Stop cleansing or cleanse if every other survivor does it, so the pools reset
---
This dude was in a solo match, and he also said they were rank 2 with two hex perks AND she had the new spirit cosmetic. You don't buy a cosmetic for a killer you're just trying out or are new too. 
---
Edit: also OoO against spirit being bad for her? Lmao
---
That's actually a pretty good one
---
I just want to be able to get my struggle points. I am about to die anyways, just let me get those bp. ;~;
---
That‚Äôs different if your gonna message somebody to make them feel good then yea that‚Äôs great. How did you feel when you did it to tell them how mad you were? Btw their is no point trying to change people‚Äôs minds these days. They will get an opinion and stick with it because they don‚Äôt want to be proven wrong.
---
Because she refused to swing for some reason? Disgraceful loss.
---
Ah yes, the fat shaming trees
---
But omega/5 blink was well beyond what should have been acceptable in terms of game balance. Nurse is allowed to be strong and she‚Äôs allowed to show how capable she is when the person puts the proper time. But omega was like a beyond crutch because there was so much forgiveness in that combo that you needed significantly less skill to achieve that same level of power. 
---
Even after messing with her addons and bass power, Nurse is still Nurse. She still ignores pallets and windows, still flings through walls and has her own specific style of chase that other killers do not. The only real difference is that now she allows the survivors to have 3.5 seconds to make a reaction and change their pathing in a chase instead of 1.25 seconds. 
---
But go off, thotiana.
---
Yeah! Cosplay as demi!
---
Don't know vs who u was playing, but in high purple-red ranks even if u cancel it near surv, he gonna find window or pallet in 90% times.
---
The demise of that game is why I'm in DBD now.
---
Side note: this only pretains to the free version of the pass so.. Why bitch when your getting free stuff anyway? Yikes...
---
I'm running circles around ya!
---
I wasn‚Äôt mad, my message was ‚Äúwhy camp when you got mori?‚Äù as I was curious.
---
Demo gang
---
The question is do you balance the game around discord or not. I like the way it is where information is controlled by certain perks but Discord/any other means of communication just throws it all away. It really sucks but what can you do really? I think they have no choice but to make unranked for SWF and ranked for no SWF. Or maybe give the killer an option to toggle matching with SWF or not and give bonus points for SWF games.
---
You push hard.
---
Oh, well yea I really don‚Äôt see a point in doing it but still I will give you the credit that you didn‚Äôt tell him to go fuck himself. I got a message to go fuck myself one time since I was playing the pig and I outsmarted him with my ambush attack.
---
Oh sure, I'd love to but I'm afraid I can't just set my matchmaking rank at one.
---
Been like that forever
---
I had to camp a nea once as wraith to secure 1 single sacrifice for a daily, To be fair they were really good survivors so if i had not gone ultra campy i wouldn't have finished it.
---
I got called out about it though and i knew it wasn't fun for them. Sometimes you just gotta do what needs to be done though
---
I still wish that There Was an Option to kick campers in their fucking face so they are stunned 15 seconds
---
This was honestly hilarious.
---
Honestly
---
The most hated killer has the most cosplays because it‚Äôs the easiest. Lmao
---
I don't even play spirit, it just makes me sad knowing one of the few killers that are actually powerful against survivors who know how to play the game is already going to get nerfed just because survivors expect every killer to be on the same power level as the clown or pig.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like Clown. But he's so rare to find. For every 120 Spirits, you'll find a single Clown from my experience.
---
Head on, legion runs to you hiding in the locker, you stun him, waste him power, then go on your way
---
I think it‚Äôs a good perk. Not the best because a lot of what you get is up to chance (also your teammates can open the chests before you do) but still useful. I‚Äôve gotten bad hauls like brown toolboxes/medkits and yellow/green flashlights. But I‚Äôve also gotten awesome hauls like keys that allowed for awesome escapes or rainbow maps that helped me locate ruin/ or the hatch. I have one character I mainly use this perk on and have managed to stockpile a bunch of keys, maps and purple medkits, among other good items.
---
My point is that you don't really know what you'e talking about.
---
In case you wanna have a look at them separately :) :

(This is a respost since I uploaded the wrong gif before.)
---
But how fast is it when you did break the pallet?
---
It‚Äôs cause he‚Äôs complete garbage.  I just play him cause I find him fun.  Haven‚Äôt gotten a 4K with him in a couple dozen matches...
---
If you'd read the whole thing, you'd find that I said AVERAGE gameplay, not Rank 1
---
I remember vividly a moment around the time I started in Freddy's map. Me and a Ace were staring at eachother nodding.
---
 Myers showed up and we just stared at him.
---
 He did not show mercy
---
Imaging losing as spirit
---
The funny part is that this is back when infinites were *actually* infinites.
---
When they‚Äôre affected by the snares they can only medium or slow vault
---
I think with the new update you don't need monitor for tier one
---
There is a medium vault?
---
I always save up almost the 1 million BP before prestidging any character so I can level it up to around 40 and sometimes I still complain about not getting good perks.
---
Mad respect bro.
---
I play with the doctor or freddy the best. I try and play all of the killers just for variety. But when I'm tryna get in the high ranks, I main those two. I used to main the legion until they buffed him. I got to rank 1 just for stabbing people.
---
Keep playing Legion I say. He ranks up quickly because the System likes what they do. Eventually, you'll stop getting 4ks, and you'll start finding more Survivors that juke your FF hit, then endlessly loop your M1 for way too long while the others genrush. I had the exact same experience as you: 4ks everygame when I started, (felt super powerful, even though I was new to killer) but after a while I got to rank 4 (which is where I am at right noow) and nowadays I mostly get 1-2 kills, unless somebody is a potato. Some Survivors can loop for daaaays... I really feel like their Deep Wound timer needs to decrease every time they do a rushed action/repair other than Sprinting.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs where they quickly shimmy over the vault point
---
That's very creative and impressive - great job!
---
Mindgame is a gamble on its roots.
---
The only reason why Spirit does it better than other killers is because it is hard for the survivors to track her movements (unlike all other killers).
---
It is still possible though. You need to keep in mind the CD (she can‚Äôt use it right after she used it) and her shards glow when she phases 
---
Not a gamble. Stupid argument. By these means any other mind-game where you cannot see the killer is gamble....
---
I wish survivor queues were only 5 minutes
---
Trick is to run NOED for the speed boost.
---
As *you're* running*
---
Complaining about dead hard.... which, by the way,  has become too inconsistent to use since dedicated servers, and is too easy to bait. But also, flashlights? You‚Äôre telling me facing a wall when you‚Äôre about to carry a survivor is too hard to do?
---
‚ÄúUsing dead hard just to pallet stun‚Äù that‚Äôs the point of deadhard.... so you can get to a pallet quicker and not get hit
---
Kay I get that's what it's for I'm not saying I dont like it for that I'm just saying i dont like the survivors that use it to stun just to tbag I dont care that they use it right it's the tbagging. Sorry if it seems like I'm just complaining about dead hard
---
A good Hag gives me PTSD.
---
Well that is what it has come down to
---
Once I did it and after that a Trapper found me and killed me like 10 seconds after because I was dead on hook, then I thought to myself "At least my team is safe"
---
Imagine not slugging to counter DS :P
---
Right bumper I believe
---
Wha-
---
I'm going to try this build. Never done it but someone did deliver items to me like this way. Not common but still more than once.
---
While you're right, I think many people overestimate percentages when it comes up to generators. Which is also why many people use Thanatophobia.
---
13 % of a Generator equal 10,4 seconds. That ain't much. The only reason why it's actually still useful, is because of the additional degression, which might turn the 13 % into 20 %, or even 40 % depending on how much pressure you apply and what the Survivors actually do.
---
Plus, I'm not quite sure in terms of the potential loadouts. Even when Pop and Surge would work, would you actually go for Surge just cause of that? Considering Ruin is currently a must have for more or less everyone, while BBQ is also always nice to have and that you're still lacking a tracking / detection perk...I think it would still have the typical issue of the space being too limited.
---
But once we actually have 4 instead of 3 perk slots to use, there might be occasions at which Surge + Pop might be a bit too much, I can see that.
---
Can you back that up with sources/evidence?
---
This always happens.
---
First of all, I don't care what other stuff she draws. Besides it's never been confirmed that those accusations are a 100% correct. Second of all, I dont care. I like Hazbin Hotel. And that wont change. 
---
And since you seem very sure about what you just said how about you provide us with the source of your informations?
---
Tome 1 is 4 pages long and goes for the ENTIRE Rift.
---
They wrote it badly, but you have time for the serum.
---
Yeah I think hag is far better then trapper. I think his default set should include more traps and perhaps he gets extra ones from lockers instead of having to go all over the map to pick them up.
---
omg i love it xD
---
What‚Äôs wrong with Russian players playing huntress? I fail to find the correlation.
---
Oi! Fresh meat!
---
It's fun and helps break up the occasional monotony of the M1 game
---
Let's see how many people will still play nurse at high ranks, how many will perform. I just really don't see the reason why would anyone play nurse with the current spirit who is much more stable and easier to play. Maybe you will play her?
---
I too yearn for that charm.
---
Folks despair, but they should just play and not fret over it. If you do tome challenges, and just play good matches you can level up. Managed to work my way to page 4 already without any money spent besides the initial 10 dollars
---
I'm sure we will sooner or later
---
Overcharge isn‚Äôt a great perk. Honestly thrilling tremors is amazing on Freddy because you always know which generator(s) you need to teleport. Combined with PGtW it‚Äôs a deadly combo.
---
username and flair checks out
---
"Overdone badly" you meant? Better than the standard this one isüòå lazy people make lazy cosplays, regardless of killer lol
---
It‚Äôs not. You really just don‚Äôt get it, there are enough other comments explaining why.
---
When I need to unwind and have fun in the game again, I put on plunderer's and ace in the hole. I like the RNG factor of it and not knowing what I'm gonna have to work with. In addition, it feels pretty nice to escape with a shiny new item!
---
That would probably for the better, honestly. The franchise as a whole is genuine garbage.  
---
Jason might be iconic, and understandably so, the dude's cool as all hell, but everything after the first film is almost impossible to enjoy unironically. It's kind of impressive how quickly the writing took a hard nosedive into concrete. It literally took one sequel, which completely missed the point of the first film, to turn the entire thing to be into a long running gag for years to come.  
---
These days, if I absolutely must watch a Friday the 13th movie, you can bet your ass I'm pretending it's a comedy. An iconic franchise, enjoyable only in an ironic fashion.
---
The thing is though, is that the 10.4 seconds happens without you having to manually go over there and kick it. The fact that you can down a guy, hook them, and then walk away without having to waste time at the generator is the strong part of the perk, not the 8% bonus regression. It's Brutal Strength level 5 that only works on Generators since it shaves off a good 8-12 seconds from your own gameplay as well.
---
If you could theoretically down someone in the 60 seconds prior to pop wearing off, you regressing the generator (or multiple generators) for 30.4 seconds is just  flat out unfair with how much momentum it would give you.
---
That's assuming you're not already in a chase. And if you're just hiding, legion is searching lockers without using his power.
---
Yeah. The slow vault is when walking. Fast vault is when approaching a vault at the right angle and medium vault is a (fast) vault that‚Äôs a bit slower when running at the window at the wrong angle.
---
Not really. All three survivors were there. You hit one, another saves, and you have two to tank hits while they all escape. This was a no win scenario since he was hooked so close to the gate.
---
Beautiful
---
Still depends on the rank 1 killer. I was rank 1 a week after getting the game, only playing Trapper back in the day and got there with ease again after they changed from points to victory cube - I was shit at the game, honestly.
---
what do you mean not really if this spirit had any form of braincells she could use her phasing to guarantee one person  down at all times in this situation, however i guess spirit mains and critical thinking don't really mix
---
its my 18th birthday
---
As long this change comes with a key rework / remove, which keeps the EGC a game of luck and wits, I'm in.
---
Happy birthday btw!
---
I‚Äôm talking about current pipping and rank 1
---
I'm perfectly fine having glimpses up her appear as long as it works both ways.
---
What I mean is, what could I do to improve the Stream as Myers.
---
The only thing different she could have done was to drop the player she had picked up. That would distract at least one other player to try and save them, too. Otherwise phasing doesn't help at all they'll still block any hits. She never managed to hit David he could have had DS or BT. The other survivors were healthy. There isn't a single thing she could have done in that scenario to get a kill except drop Nancy and hope they fuck up. Otherwise she had no chance.
---
Everyones sitting here talking about the ds‚Äôs while im just amazed how close those hooks are to one another
---
ü§≠
---
The fact that this comment is "controversial" shows that the majority of people here don't know dick about the Friday lawsuit. 
---
Fuck Cunningham.
---
Once everything is nerfed on all sides to the point of being usless we'll achieve true balance.
---
Get in the goddamn basement, Shinji.
---
I 100% would play a swf lobby if it meant more blood points. Ill take the ass beating and aim for them bbq stacks as much as possible. Could be just me though, I'm a whore for them blood points.
---
Whenever you mori someone you should do his signature head tilt
---
You need to slug. The Devs want it that way.
---
I was implying that it was actually much harder back then. Killer is at the most buffed its ever been. If you can‚Äôt pip in the current state of DbD as killer, there are about 3 simple answers as to why:
---
1. You don‚Äôt know how emblems work
---
2. You are simply not good enough
---
3. All of the above. 
---
Don‚Äôt blame it on the devs, the people or whatever. Others can do it, so can you. The undefined variable is you. Sorry for the rant but I‚Äôm just sick of this.
---
We could just simplify it down to 'Cheating = Breaking the rules with some outer advantage, Griefing = intentionally messing with the game against your team' Because, ngl, seeing 'New Cheating Method' would make you think that "oh, there's a new hack? Let's see it" only to see it's Team Griefing. Just report and it as Griefing/Trolling or whatever that thing is in-game, and it'll be dealt with eventually.
---
u/osukatheoracleturret
---
Nani tf?
---
The more rng the better, I love a good dice throw can you dig it
---
Im a rank 11 survivor/20 huntress and I play with a controller on pc. I can't rank up my killer because queue times are 5+mins and I either get baby survivors who I feel bad for or 3+ decayed accounts of SWF who group up and blind me anytime I try to pick up a downed survivor... its not worth it
---
They don't even get pips. What's the point
---
Tru3 has this opinion about DS should deactivate as soon as someone else gets hooked. I think that would be a good solution.
---
Huntress hitbox is so broken it aint even funny anymore. So people will abuse it for as long as it is around. 90% of my killers are russians and about 70% of them play huntress so yeah not fun playing a killer with a super broken hitbox
---
I just had one of those wheezing laughs. I love this.
---
I see screentearing so that could be fixed
---
I never said I couldn‚Äôt pip, I‚Äôm rank 1 buddy. Before they changed popping requirements it was really easy to pip
---
4K= double pip
---
3K= single pip
---
2/1k= safety pip
---
1/0k=depip 
---
Now it‚Äôs a lot more complicated
---
you're getting downvoted for being full of shit. you need to AT LEAST play 350 Games in 70 Days. That's way more than 1h per day.
---
He's wrong, first off - serum lasts two weeks after the first rift, so we still have another two months + two weeks until serum goes away.  We also still have another three books of challenges to go through.  The grind won't be that bad by the end of it.
---
Probably not, because they don't want people to have an unfair advantage.
---
They probably will, but you don't need it to be good
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
**proceeds to kobe
---
*sees Nea* how did you know what my sleep paralysis demon looks like?
---
If she phased then the healthy survivors would surround him and take a hit. Even then she only has the one chance to hit them, which is unlikely. Then they all get out just as easily.
---
What you're talking about isn't a smart move or more skill, it would be a lucky hit. There's no reason to count on luck then call the spirit an idiot for not doing a hail Mary.
---
This is really ass
---
I guess we just disagree with the verbiage.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a benefit to the killer for the survivor to run an item.  You don‚Äôt need an instant heal medkit for every chase your in or anything,  it‚Äôs a bonus you can bring in to the match with you. I believe the benefit for the survivor was nerfed to prevent 4 man SWF or hell even randoms bringing 4 in and just tanking hits like crazy.
---
Play freddy is a better clown
---
i love it!!
---
Man, Hazbin Hotel.
---
I was enjoying it until 21 minutes into it, and then that's about when I actually started looking forward to more.
---
Here's hoping they don't Jack Sparrow Alastor, where they take the best part of the show/movie and run it into the ground.
---
no they wouldn't, you're acting like all survivors are omnipresent, no survivor in the history of the entire world would know that the spirit would be coming from the front, it would literally be the best move possible in that situation because running at them and trying to m1 them literally had a 0% chance of working and it showed
---
My first time hiring rank one was with doctor,  but that was a long time ago. Right after they made snapping out of it count as a Healing action and work with nurses calling, botany knowledge, and thanatophobia. I miss those days.
---
Look man i get the frustration but its still an item that heals you in a very short amount of time and while you can do any other action.
---
thank you!
---
Good. Toxic players deserve nothing less.
---
Let‚Äôs you play as the nightmare I‚Äôm pretty sure theirs one for all the dlc characters and are in the bloodwebs of people who don‚Äôt have them
---
Meg‚Äôs part should‚Äôve been Kate
---
Why so the games easier for killers?
---
What could she do? Her only advantage in the movie was that everyone knew and trusted her, that would be very hard to adapt into game unless she could disguise herself as a survivor and I feel another killer would be better suited for that power.
---
Do you know if David's auto-broken perk counts towards Resilience?
---
Sometimes I let Myers stalk me at the beginning of the game so I can get the longest loop on him. This way when we get later into the game Myers won‚Äôt follow me when he is trying to 99% his Tier 3. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it on lag or that map with the tree in the center.
---
Thanks for that. I think i will be playing tf2 today
---
i play clown, he's a daddy
---
Yes!! ^ That‚Äôs how I feel. No matter how many times you juke me and blind me I will not allow you to think you‚Äôve broken my spirit. I‚Äôd rather take the loss. 
---
I main clown and am a level 14 killer anyway üòÖ
---
I just like to exercise.
---
You claim that it's so obvious she should attack from the front then also claim no survivor is smart enough to think of it themselves. It's a huge flaw in your argument. Even then the spirit has to get around their hit boxes in order to get in front while she can't see them. Go too wide she doesn't even get in position. Go too shallow you get body blocked.
---
Everyone knows how the spirit works. Thinking survivors won't guess she'd go for the front is naive.
---
You're welcome :)
---
&gt;Honestly I think Evey killer and survivor should have the ability to have a built in perks in addition to the standard 4 perks they normally get.
---
Then only the best built-in ability survivors would get played. If meg could run faster or claudette could heal faster by default then nobody else would really get picked. Not even mentioning possible DLC advantages. What we have now, with survivors being skins, is better.
---
Flashlights are already really underpowered, I don't think we need to nerf them further.
---
Wow i had no idea i thought ppl just screw around while hooked . the more you know there so much unspoken language in this game lol kinda overwhelming
---
I feel really guilty using NOED against survivors that aren't toxic dickheads, but I can't afford to remove it just in case I do get a neon Nea.
---
Oh, got it. Thanks.
---
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no counterplay‚Äù you literally get to decide if she gets to use her power or not. A killer that is at the mercy of the survivors for whether or not she gets to use her power. I was with yall on spirit to a degree but these ‚Äúnerf x killer‚Äù witch hunts are getting ridiculous.
---
Sorry Jane's we cant escape, were to dummy thicc, and the sound of our ass cheeks clapping keeps alerting the ghostface (should have used QAQ)
---
My eyes are still burning from last night
---
Yeah sure why not
---
Yeah the dc would have completed the Claudette starter pack.
---
I've never gotten this bug before and I've been a long time Deliverance user ever since it released with Adam and the Spirit. Although I do remember watching Monto try it out and he got a bug like this but that was around the time the Shattered Bloodlines chapter first released, like either during the PTB or a little bit after the PTB. I do remember it getting fixed and I haven't seen the bug or experienced it myself ever since then. Still one of my favorite perks.
---
Same. When F13th was going strong I told myself "I'm never playing dead by daylight; it looks like a lesser version of f13th" yet here I am with 1k hours....
---
And that's excactly what I'm talking about. When it comes up to consistent and proper value, the only Add-Ons you can actually go for are increased range and recharge speed.
---
Everything else is either just not impactful at all (Fatigue reducers for example), are gimmicks (like the Spoon or being undetectable for...16 seconds) or are just absolutely unnecessary to begin with (Plaid Flannel, handicap Add-Ons).
---
Besides of the Matchbox ofcourse, I actually like the Matchbox. Even when it's kinda lame that the Bookmark (+1 blink) is so weak on most of the maps.

There are lots of Killers that struggle to enjoy proper Add-On variety. Freddy has for whatever reason a Add-On that induces haemorrhage for 60 seconds once interacting with a dream trap. Same goes for Blindness. Why does Trapper still have Add-Ons that focus on punishing sabotaging, nobody does that, and even if, they're just as inconsistent as the ones that darken traps.
---
And to be honest I just wish there'd be more Add-Ons that are actually worth to play and experiment around with. It's frustrating and dissapointing that Nurse's Add-Ons turned out like this.
---
#LOVE TO SEE IT

honestly, i wish they added this as the loading screen. sure, the novelty'd wear off soon, but still better than the same loop of 5 lines
---
A little advice: this is not a very good build for memes or meta. Working with what you have, small game and inner strength would be solid replacements for breakdown and self care. Self-care wastes too much precious time and small game can help you find totems plus you can heal yourself extremely faster with inner strength. Borrowed time is very helpful in dire situations. I love the spine chill! It is a very underestimated perk.
---
Damn that sounds scary(never seen Terminator)

Aight, im boutta head out.

"They're very bad, It's accepted that they're mostly useless and yet you claim "They're fine where they are". 
---
To think this is coming from someone that plays dbd. No wonder it's not going anywhere outside of gp, The "community" are hell bent on dragging it down with them
---
He is using neon nea in place of "general toxic survivor" since any survivor with any cosmetics can be toxic.
---
what the absolute fuck are you on about?
---
I dont run it enough to have much input, but I remember when it came out this was an issue, though I thought it was resolved. Its a shame it isnt, since it already has a kinda steep requirement, just to be a dead perk bc of a bug
---
What would you reccomend, Stream on my established channel, or maybe create a channel dedicated to it, if I pursued the cosplay. - Thank you for the compliment.
---
Yes please. I also don¬¥t understand why it got nerfed from 12 percent to 8...was 12 really that overpowered to begin with?
---
sometimes when playing killer you have to do hail marys', there just isn't getting around it, not taking the absolute best chance you have of securing a down is dumb, you can't deny that. id argue it is critical thinking because it is using every bit of information you have to make an educated guess of whats about to happen and using it to your advantage. it's not like she had no idea what was going on, she had PLENTY of information and that alone prevents it from it being a "hail mary". if you want to use that logic then everytime you phase you're doing a "hail mary" because you can't see the survivors. that really sounds stupid, when playing a game like this, you have to take chances and not taking your best chance at securing a kill and instead  opting to hold W and run at them means you're not thinking critically. you can't say otherwise, you'd have to be extremely ignorant
---
We need more r/dogelore DbD posts.
---
Honestly, you should repost this at some point for more exposure. It's amazing!
---
‚ÄòWdym I play alot?‚Äô :p
---
lol i also tested with my friends in KYF, it is really faint, perhaps it is settings i play on the lowest
---
Personally, I think they should try to keep normal human killers to a minimum. Ghostface is stealth and Legion is stabby stab. They‚Äôd have to go far out just to fit her in the game.
---
I think you mean a slash considering the swing not shoot you?
---
Ty i forgot that i post this xd
---
*Son*?!
---
He's actually not wrong, go read the serum description in the rift again. It says it can only be earned during tome 1 of the archives.
---
You can't mind game as spirit. Mind games require skill. Spirit "mindgames" aren't skill based. The survivor has no info to make a decision. Therefore no "mind" games. As survivor you're just guessing and hoping you guessed right. As killer you hold all the cards. It's a one sided interaction that negates any mind games.
---
I feel you. I almost always exclusively die to EGC or let the killer hook me at the end. The extra 5k BP isnt worth the toxicity/sweat of red ranks.
---
Why 13 percent? Surge is 8 percent on Tier 3, where do you get the extra 5?
---
Honestly I feel like a lot of really fun and cool stuff just can‚Äôt exist in this game bc of how incompetent BHVR is at balancing.  They keep saying they‚Äôre balancing the game around the green rank but then are nerfing Spirit bc she‚Äôs too good in red rank (without understanding the dynamic of the power vacuum they created in red rank).
---
Thank you for proving my point. üòäüòä
---
True as it can be
---
Good job
---
doesn't killing a toxic survivor feel that much better when you know you outplayed them yourself and it wasn't just because of noed, otherwise the would escape? And just a bonus to that is you're not going to feel guilty killing classic polite survivors. Take no offense in that please
---
Yeah the newest update changed him. He now has a 0m terror radius in tier one compared to the 6m he previously had. The caveat now is that spine chill and premonition now work on him in tier I. He also now has the undetectable effect applied to him and all the mumbo jumbo that come with that.
---
‚ÄúFlashlights are underpowered‚Äù.
---
Lmao.
---
This
---
Does put a smile on my face
---
Everyone downvoting this guy needs to read the serum description in the rift again. He's actually right.
---
Yeah but his camera at that point was probably already pointed at the ground, and even if it wasn't the animation still has to cancel, you can't instantly stab.
---
&gt; Surge applies an additional regression of 8 %.
---
Kicking a Generator is 5% by itself (I believe), and Surge adds 8% on top of that.
---
I didnt know they added potato chips to dbd, must be a new update
---
It happened to me as well in a game, I don't want to call anyone a cheater, but I was killer and a Survivor did the same but with a map, when I asked him how, he said to me that he simply saw there was a prop to open the hatch and he pressed it...
---
If its a cheat, that sucks, if it's a bug that happens rarely after someone opens the hatch with a key and you close it, that also sucks and should be reported to devs to fix it asap
---
thx you for reminding me! ill edit this post asap! (hope you enjoyed the stream!)
---
Also if you went for a full myers theme you could add alerts with sounds from Halloween movies or gifs from them
---
I just played against a red rank spirit with Noed
---
Thats so fricking cool
---
Lol yup the next chapter update.
---
he's still sitting on "guilty until proven innocent" and his logic is shit.
---
Like saying "Oh I hate bringing Ebony Mories but, yknow, I have to every time! Just in case someone clicks their flashlight at me!"
---
AFAIK all kicking does is start regression at 0.25 charges per second, I looked at the DBD wiki and nowhere does it state that kicking applies some upfront extra regression...
---
Doesn't her hair stand up perfectly still?
---
Oh this sounds fun. Never thought of using it that way. Just started playing Friday and definitely going to have to give this a try.
---
It‚Äôs still a massive improvement over hatch camping, though.
---
Which person are you talking about?
---
If you‚Äôre looking for specific advice I‚Äôd be happy to help I‚Äôm not the best player out there but I‚Äôm a purple rank killer. I have a fair amount of success and I am still learning myself. Are there certain parts of playing killer you‚Äôre struggling with compared to others? Which ones do you play?
---
Head on field?
---
Super easy to, esp with Mud and Clapper

This is a video basically debunking everything he said; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAtndgDqh0E

Man, you have to watch both terminator movies, they're still fucking classics.
---
Once I had someone message me saying how much of a coward I was for letting them die on the hook while I was literally being chased by the killer so my friend could save them, which didnt work out anyway because the killer caught me, slugged me, then got my friend. He said, and I quote, "you died a coward and soo did your pathetic friend"
---
He then started harassing my friend about not being able to stand up for himself and getting his friend to do it when in reality he probably doesn't have any friends who would do the same for him.
---
They should really make the mud a rare addon, very underated
---
there is LITERALLY only one reason to play clown over fred
---
1. he's funnier than freddy
---
that's it
---
that's also why i play him over freddy
---
The one saying the killer shouldnt kill people clearly
---
You didnt see the chase, the hits, the hooks? I beat that whole team up and did not get a single pip. I just played a game as The Legion and double pipped from stabbing people all match and having them mend. All iridescent. That's as much pressure applied as my demogorgon game. If you want me to show you that game, I'll upload it and show you.
---
K
---
That's pretty damn smart. Better than my strat of shitting myself immediately and running into a corner.
---
Honestly, red ranks kinda suck. For killers it just nothing but sweaty SWF's that play as optimally as possible. Nothing wrong with that but it's annoying getting your ass handed to you all the time. And as for survivor red ranks it's nothing but Spirit, Nurse, or Billy. Again, nothing wrong with that but it would be nice if other killers were more viable. 
---
With purple and green ranks you get a variety of survivors and killers of all types of skill.
---
i saved someone after getting the gate open only to be hit down. luckily the other survivor got away while i dragged along the map 2 die. that same survivor sent me a message that they will remember my sacrifice. felt gr8
---
Glad to see more and more people realizing this
---
Doc, cuz let's be honest...
---
1) You would shit your pants just looking at his face IRL
---
2) You would see hallucinations over and over again, completely losing your mind, not even being able to live anymore like you used to if you ever managed to escape him
---
3) He fucking laughs while shocking you, which in game is just funny for the killer POV while for the survivors is annoying, but IRL that would literally be something that adds to being scared as fuck, being chased by a psycho that is laughing at you while trying to kill you...
---
4) He has a metal dildo
---

---
You seem.....stressed. You ok?
---
Hahahhahhaahhahah
---
Thank you BHVR very cool
---
Streaming is fine, but if you want, you could make a channel like that Jason did, and uploading every week 1 or 2 gameplays during fridays
---
Sorry I thought that was very obvious
---
Those days are still around with the doctor. He's still a viable killer til this day.
---
He saw him, but not until he was on top of the hatch because of the angle he was looking at. He also didn't know that he could close the hatch while cloaked. In that same game, I actually died because I didn't know he could open lockers while cloaked, and then he tunneled me after I escaped his grasp and then hooked me and then when I got unhooked he mori'd me.
---
Do people still hate this perk, cuz I know a lot of killers that have this same power?
---
Same. It was bugged pretty bad until its midchapter patch, I think. No issues since then for me either though. Maybe a platform specific problem?
---
Now this is something terrifying
---
You mean Heaven.
---
Oh yes it's definitely a bug. Michael has been close to unplayable since dedicated servers, but this is a new reach, it's never been this bad
---
Best of luck to you. For my fake pallet Freddy build, I like to run PGtW, Thrilling tremor, Brutal Strength, and either Ruin or Discordance.
---
Stridor, for when you want to make sure there is absolutely no counter play.
---
Haha, thanks! Piggy means no harm
---
i hope you guys made it out alive that game
---
I mean have you watched any late 80s/early 90s slasher movies, not a lot of them hold up, and for all of them, they get a lot more campy as the sequels go on. Look at Halloween where we have a whole cult story line, we have a movie where Busta Rhymes roundhouse kicks Michael and also scolds him calling him a dumb motherfucker making him walk away. Not to mention the Nightmare series where Freddy is literally playing with a power glove to mess with a guy in a video game complete with goofy sound effects. While the slashers may be iconic, the majority of their films do not hold up for horror.
---
We knew he could kick gens and pallets, and had recently discovered that he can open lockers as well (that got me killed in that same game, actually; he opened the locker, but I wiggled free and then he tunneled me and mori'd me after he hooked me). But we didn't know he could close the hatch

---
Okay, I Was Just A Bit Confused Being It Was On The Wall. Thanks.
---
Either A or B if I remember.
---
I kinda just mash until the game decides to throw them down.
---
It's only useful when used with certain other addons that mask or alter the bell sound, but definitely underrated!
---
I think there is a difference between getting killed by a Killer who chased well and played fair and a Killer who bloodlusts you to death with NOED after losing the entire game.
---
Because it‚Äôs awesome
---
Yeah, he didn't. In that same game I discovered that he can open lockers while cloaked. Then I got mori'd after a brief stint of being tunneled to my first hook (I wiggled free after he picked me up from the locker)
---
Yiyiyiyiyiyiyi
---
The person with a hex in their name was me. It's Hex:No u, which is obviously a joke. How can you possibly take that seriously? You can see that he was the only one alive at the time, and his name was zz.
---
I didn't know he could open lockers while cloaked, so I got picked up, wiggled free, then got tunneled to my first hook (there were no pallets or windows anywhere near me) and then mori'd.
---
Yes it can be countered but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be annoying
---
They absolutely are. It's pathetically easy to play around flashlight saves (look at a wall, look around you before picking up, use infectious freight, if you're lazy then use lightborn) and pallet blinds don't do anything if you have a pair of headphones and a pair of functioning ears.
---
Sure if you are Wraith or Hag then they make your life harder, but besides that they are ridiculously weak. I'll take survivors bringing in flashlights than literally any other item. In fact, I'd rather have them bring in flashlights than come in empty handed. I got so many free hits/downs thanks to flashlights baiting people into running to me.

I usually do it cuz it's exciting and funny, but I don't teabag like most survivors usually do. I also wouldn't have done it against a wraith

I‚Äôve failed just thinking about it

Blood points according to the ps4 Bubba's I have faced but like doesn't standung in one spot stop being fun at some point.

yeah, darn it for having more varied gameplay, more interesting &amp; reasonable kills, and fleshed-out (though admittedly repetitive) maps.

Good to see some people can tell.

Yes. Perfect ending to the video!

Did you pip?

I guess it‚Äôs something about not being able to escape and being one hit down. Many find it ‚Äúunskillful.‚Äù

So far I think he's got the most potential. There was that one scene where he was making fun of Charlie for not having anyone at the hotel and he genuinely showed empathy when she continued to look bummed out.

I recommend perks like Save the best for last, Brutal Strength, Bamboozled *optional, and Ruin. These perks really help close essential gaps to close in on survivors. I feel so fast as clown plus his gas having a wide proximity hitbox really helps. Hence why I like him better then freddy snares

you get 35 Tiers through the Challenges, the rest you must farm through games

ok boomer
---
Oh yeah, I run STBFL and BS on Clown. So good, they feel almost essential.
---
I don‚Äôt know. I main survivor but I can understand why people bring it if gens in their rank get rushed really quickly. At that point the perk is literally their only last chance to get a secured hook kill. Not invalidating how annoying it can be, but maybe it‚Äôs just low on my priorities of things to be annoyed at. 
---
Well actually, it‚Äôs only really annoying when someone gets one hit down by NOED and decides to be a sore player and rage DC.
---
Full on bad play by your part. Should have downed those survivors and put more pressure on the others. If you slug you still are wasting time for them.
---
It does feel really good. I don‚Äôt run Noed and had a survivor teabag after dropping every pallet. Felt great when I finally killed them, was playing pig so made sure to teabag as they died üòÑ
---
Not to be that guy, but this wasn't exactly a good spirit either.
---
~~If you were the only player left how could you have been tunneled? You're the only person left~~
---
EDIT: Didn't realize person in the video *wasn't* OP
---
Are those exit gates touching??
---
Hatch spawn is supposed to be absolutely random. 
---
Now I'm no game developer, but my theory is that the preschool takes up so much space on the map, but since the hatch can never spawn on the second floor of anything, it automatically drops to the boiler level, and since the boiler level is so compact and close quarters, the bulk of it is unsuitable for spawning a hatch. So it puts it in the closest, most suitable location. In that corner.
---
I'm already tier 26 so, 35 tiers from tomes along with naturally gaining xp from matches? Completely doable over the span of 70 days.
---
They literally used their power twice throughout the whole video and the second time almost came out on top of you but fell short, which suggests they are either not good with Spirit or didn‚Äôt have headphones on. They also kept falling for your 360s. So more like how to outplay a 110% movement speed M1 Killer who isn‚Äôt very good.
---
Lol when I play a nice Killer on Red Ranks I usually try to go for someone who isn‚Äôt in his final hook but when those who I spared escape they teabag. Not that it irritates me all that much but It brings me closer to using the thousands of Ebony Moris I have and playing mercilessly. But that probably ends with one of the triggered twats telling afterwards how trash I am.
---
Try this again against a Spirit who isnt a complete trashcan. Im pretty indifferent towards Spirit, but bro... You cant watch this gameplay and honestly think that its a good representation of an even half decent Spirit, or a half decent killer player period lmao. They whiffed easy hits, and somehow couldnt track an injured steve who was sprinting. Cmon now.
---
Don‚Äôt feel too bad I definitely think there should be a way to tell and I main her. It seems unfair that‚Äôs there pretty much no way to tell and I wouldn‚Äôt mind something like her appearing for a moment in the middle of phasing before disappearing again
---
Hey, just getting back with you, I noticed something this morning. While playing the game, the cpu usage is drastically different between intel extreme tuning and task manager. Task manager shows about double cpu usage that intel does. I‚Äôm at 67% on task manager yet intel only says 32%. Also GPU usage still sits at 90% on low which I feel is high for only being on low settings
---
That plus 70 days of playing the game like normal makes it completely possible.
---
niiice
---
WOW, wish I could run a killer like that. Very nicely done!
---
Hazbin Hotel?
---
Dead rabbit + monitor and abuse is a mean build
---

---
You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
---

---
Just reply have a nice vacation and report and move on or turn off your messages no need to be so whiny about it.
---
If you can‚Äôt take the heat get out of the kitchen
---
Ah thanks guys!
---
No I‚Äôm just saying posts that show killers in any bad light usually don‚Äôt gain traction. Sub is killer sided but if you post ‚Äútoxic flashing light tbag survivor‚Äù you get 1k internet points
---
What I‚Äôve been doing is playing a bunch of survivor games to build up bp to spend on the killer of my choice. That way I can have more than one measly perk.
---
This spirit is terrible and this is console. This proves nothing.
---
You also can‚Äôt expect every spirit you come across as a god just because they have headphones on. I main spirit myself and even I whiff hits sometimes regardless of the fact that I‚Äôm wearing headphones. Sometimes you‚Äôll have decent survivors who can actually mindgame pretty well. 
---
This game should have strong killers. She‚Äôs strong. But she‚Äôs still counterable. I just don‚Äôt want to see her get nerfed to the ground because some people don‚Äôt feel like using their brains to fake pallets or windows.
---
This is definitely not a good spirit to use as demonstration though they dont seem like they even know how to use her
---
Exactly, kind of like joining a match in progress in other games but the match doesn't count towards your stats. But in this case it doesn't effect your pips.
---
Its not that the game died, its the ratio of people playing survivor to killer. If say 50% of the people playing are playing killer (Id say about accurate) then killer lobbies will be long, as its 4 survivors per 1 killer, but half of the people playing (or more) are playing the 1/5 not the 4/5
---
r/ihavesex
---
Why are you talking like this
---
I had this issue a lot when I was below rank 15, somehow made it to 13 almost 12 and I still haven‚Äôt deranked
---
At least I know now that others have seen it too
---
That's true, but it could be easily abandoned and he'd become incredibly hollow as a character. Only time will tell though, right now we only have the pilot and Vivzie has a *lot* to improve before she can call it a quality cartoon.
---
don't you know, any time the killer looks at you you're being tunneled
---
Alright I won‚Äôt shout to hurt the deaf ppl
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug; I think if any of the 3 gens get worked on the survivors see those light up. It‚Äôs just in survivor side, killer only sees the completed one. The chances of all 3 gens getting done at exactly the same time are about 0, with skill checks and such
---
Is it that much of a difference?
---
Ohhh, I misinterpreted your original comment. I basically understood "this post is not only shitting on survivors, but it's also praising killers" for some reason.
---
Siren Head is WAY too tall. I know we have Demogorgon, but Demo can actually fit through a doorway. Isn‚Äôt Mr. Head like 40 feet tall or something
---
‚ÄúCAN‚ÄôT WAIT FOR THE RUIN NERF SO KILLERS ACTUALLY NEED SKILL‚Äù
---
Imagine being this bad at the game lmao
---
Does it feel better to win as a survivor not using good perks? It's the same question really.
---
I do agree that the skill cap on Nurse has gotten to the point that there's little reason to burden yourself with her. I have a friend who used to play Nurse at a competitive level (like in tournaments and shit) and he published a video showing that Nurse is (very slightly) slower than a 115% Killer when it comes to just traversing the map. There was some human error in his video that the Survivor mains on the official forums were too quick to pounce on but the point still stands that even if Nurse walks on a completely open (Rotten) Field(s) she's still slightly slower than a 115% Killer. Yes "Nurse can go through walls" but Nurse can also get stuck on tiny rocks on the ground since they haven't fixed the multitude of bugs that Nurse had which we sort just accepted because "she's OP so she needs to be hard to play."
---
I don't like ranking characters lower or higher on tier lists because of their skill requirement but skill is still a factor that needs to be considered. If we were operating under the context of perfect Killers playing against perfect Survivors Nurse would still be top tier by a landslide, and Spirit would honestly be below Billy and possibly below Freddy as well since "perfect" Survivors would all be running Iron Will and would all be able to instantly pallet stun her the moment she comes out of phase. But the problem with Spirit is that the relative strength she holds has little to no skill factor to balance out. Spirit is a 4 step process:
---
1. Hit Survivor
---
2. Phase
---
3. ???
---
4. Profit
---
Under the context that you're playing against a bunch of Survivors running Iron Will (and can't run Stridor because you need a 4th perk to be competitive) Spirit is trash, but under the context that you go up against people running We're Gonna Live Forever and Plunderer's Instinct and can get away with running Stridor then Spirit is pretty much a guaranteed victory.
---
Tbh i always get into a game faster on killer than i do survivor
---
Especially Nurse
---
Just play with friends that have at least some experience. You can literally play with anybody as long as you can rely on them and will at least pip most of the time
---
I‚Äôd want that. Watching that would be like being high without doing any drugs. It‚Äôd be epic
---
As a billy main, its always a pain to see the exit gates right next to each other, and then the last survivor just giving up. I dont always give them the hatch as i want the 4k and BP and pip but damn do i feel sorry for them. Needs a rework.
---
As someone who mostly plays killer, i love plunderers and ace in the hole cause i can get items for my survivor without needing to invest bloodpoints
---
Nurses instead of thana probably
---
Redheads pinky would like a word...
---
Had the same thought
---
I dunno man it's just the cartoon scheme and art that is cool.
---
the nest for the birds?
---
I dislike it cause it's a safety net, it basically rewards you as a killer for failing the basic objective of killing everyone before the gens are done,  and the kills don't feel earned IMO. Yeah it can be broken, but to me that's like saying every loop can be countered if you just get to bloodlust 3, it takes a lot of time and many might not even bother in the first place.
---
I play a lot more killer than survivor and I never use it, it just feels kinda scummy like using an OP gun in a game like COD for instance.
---
Is she not reasonably balanced as is? Sure she has huge non-linear power swings throughout the match but I don't think any of the many proposed changes we see for her (both bluffs and nerfs) on a near daily basis would improve her gameplay.
---
Meh, I wouldn‚Äôt say nurse uses noed a lot unless it‚Äôs a low rank nurse. But if it‚Äôs pig, wraith or trapper I‚Äôm 100% doing dull totems
---
What does console have to do with anything on DBD? This was a legit chase, don't be an elitists fucboi.
---
Yeah I agree. I do like the art style but the jokes desperately need improvement. I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll do better in their next episode.
---
Sloppy is useless on huntress... your hitting hatchets not m1's please remove this wasted perk slot... thana is a terrible perk in general but go off I guess.
---
Pop is ok but not good for huntress since your unlikely to be a 3 gen'ing and your too slow to reach the gens you need before they are completed.
---
Ruin is a the only good perk here... its basic and if you want to improve as a killer player, learn to play without it so you actually learn what is and isnt a good idea so you don't make mistakes because no ruin means your mistakes are punished helping you improve..... but if you want a good huntressbuild- ruin, nurses, whisper, and bbq are the literal best perks for huntress and no possible build is better.

I played with Nancy for a while and noticed I got downed way more often than with other survivors, I contributed it towards her white shirt. But then I was playing killer recently and I noticed that something isn‚Äôt right with her character. I was chasing her and was able to get a hit on her even though she completely jumped through the window. I shouldn‚Äôt have hit her she was already on her feet at that point, but I still got her, then as I chased her more I did it again over a pallet. Has anyone else noticed that she is easier to down?
---
I switched over to survivor and played her again and tried testing it, it definitely seemed like she was getting hit even after fully being on the other side of a window/pallet.
---
I play on console if that matters (XBOX)
---
Yeah I do also run it on pig, my pig build is, BBQ, NOED, Surveillance, and Devour
---
13 but haven't been playing that much
---
No I message people good game. Even if I lose I‚Äôm a chill dude.
---
I play Trapper and Clown at red ranks. I think Clown has some of the coolest looking cosmetics and I can't wait for his upcoming mascot outfit.
---
DS should end immediately if you hooked 2 other survivors.
---
I dont think its toxic as survivor bp are bp so i would do the same and as killer it doesnt come off toxic to me either bc if a survivor does that i can find hatch to close it, break some downed palletes, damage gens etc for extra bp. Basically free bp for everyone lol.
---
Honestly, there are just better perks to run. That, and the inconsistency is just too much to rely on. If the perk guaranteed a rare+, then this would be a different story.
---
*insert loud ass moans here* damnit woman ohwait‚Äî
---
19, I completed Tier 1 Archives and I played quite a lot during the Bloodhunt.
---
I do too. I farm with him with a bunch of bonus blood point perks and have an absolute blast with his play style.
---
Feels the same on killer side
---
Even still, average gameplay would be rank 10-5, right now you are at low skill gameplay
---
I... I would like to have the Meg art to put on my wall and frame it
---
Nope, not toxic
---
Even if it was toxic, in the end who cares? You should play the game how you enjoy it, regardless of little crybabies yelling at you that you‚Äôre toxic
---
No they aren‚Äôt lol a killer with a brain simply won‚Äôt facecamp and I rarely see WGLF used because it‚Äôs shit
---
Triggered by/complain about the smallest things and then throw a temper tantrum when they see a m2 killer.
---
no it‚Äôs not toxic to get struggle points
---
26!
---
I play a lot of killer as well and use the strongest perks available like everyone else but noed is the perk where I draw the line. Simply because the advantage is just that big and because playing well for the duration of the whole match and getting one-shot in the very end is extremely frustrating. So to answer your question, I do use Lithe, WGLF and Plunderer's+the other looting perk/ BT+Adrenaline.
---
22
---
25 i think maybe 24 but i play quite alot
---
"maybe if i post a video of me on console looping a very bad killer thats only at their rank due to them playing a broken killer with no counterplay ill disprove everyone! y-yeah!!!"
---
ok buddy
---
theres a few spots on the swamp maps where they can spawn along walls
---
37 billion
---
60 seconds is way too long
---
It should put you into the dying state after 5 seconds
---
True true
---

---
Pmd you
---
Dude tag this NSFW.
---
Fair and balanced
---
As someone who personally hates surviving the Wraith, I really like burn stunning that smoky, sooty boy
---
I don‚Äôt take it as toxic at all. You get points for it.
---
As far as I know the pips for that rank doesn't matter. From experience rank reset will make you go from 12 to 15. You can't derank past 15 so don't worry about getting bad matches and going to like 16 or 20.
---
I'm fully aware that Aizeyu is a real person (In fact, that comment on the tweet from September 30th was my reply!).
---
What I'm saying is that just because the two share a name does not mean that Aizeyu isn't a character in the game. Aizeyu's name IS a reference, but that doesn't mean that his namesake isn't a character.
---
I don't think it bm. You just want want BPs it understandable.
---
So basically, on the 13th of every month, the ranks reset to 20, but you get 2 pips back for every rank you are past 20. So if you go up to rank 15, at rank reset, you'll be given 10 pips, which would automatically put you at rank 17 with 1 pip.
---
Don't let survivors make you feel guilty for anything if you are playing fair. Unless survivors are new, all survivors should anticipate NOED and focus on opening the gates. It activates during the shortest phase of the game unless survivors want to extend it.
---
This sub be like....
---
getting so triggered by another comment that you have to make a separate post showing off the comment
---
killer is much harder to play as you can't rotate as precisely as you need to, if this spirit was on PC she could've easily 180'd and downed david after phasing
---
Wraith main, never once used it
---
Yes it does appear
---
Can you give ME the original photo
---
Triggered? He thought i was being serious lmao. Im just shocked tbh
---
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.
---
Okay that's how you feel about it. Not everyone shares your sentiment and gets tired of the made up rules.
---
In theory you can avoid it as long as you want, it'll just clog up your doctor BW as long as you don't pick it up, but if you don't want to play doctor you'll be fine
---
But your profile picture has a shirt on?
---
The fact that you put "high iq" is the sole reason I downvoted.
---
I get blinded at pallets and whatnot all the time, and I think a couple groups pulled off great flashlight saves on me several times. At my rank I encounter a lot of good flashlight users but I am getting pretty good at evading. 
---
I‚Äôm not good with a flashlight at all but there‚Äôs some very good flashlight people out there. Hats off to them.
---
45
---
I will use this post for my slugging excuse.
---
You can just dont learn this perk,until you get lvl 2 learn monitor and abuse
---
391 points away from perfection
---
The gate is already open and all 3 other survs are already there. How can you even call that camping, what the fuck is she supposed to do? The moment she hits anyone of those healthy survs one of the other 2 will get unhook and all of them escape.
---
Alright, I actually have a somewhat good one this time
---
Last week I wanted to play killer for once, I‚Äôm a rank 12 survivor (been playing for barely two months, still pretty much a noob) but I‚Äôve barely ever laid my eyes on killer, let alone play as killer. I‚Äôve been a fan of the game for about 3 years already but I never took time to think about how I‚Äôd play as a killer
---
I was very unprepared
---
And then there‚Äôs the matchmaking, I was a rank 20 against 3 rank 12 survivors 
---
And one baby Claudette I had a chance of catching but the rest of the group protected their baby
---
After I almost got the baby one Kate turned the tables and started chasing me instead, she had a purple flashlight and everything, so she cornered me a few times while blinding me
---
And I kind of got bullied the whole game, teabagging even from the baby, flashlight spamming and constant blinding 
---
Near the end I just wanted to skip the humiliation of getting chased while the survivors open the gate, so I opened it myself and cornered myself  with my head down to make it look comedic, wish I was kidding when I say I was about to cry- oof am a wimp 
---
Anyways eventually a player who wasn‚Äôt bullying me came and he pretty much forced me to kill him in the endgame when everyone left, he refused to let me let him leave
---
I thanked him for the bloodpoints and the title as a brutal killer by the game and he was like ‚Äúwinning is not that important, taking a baby killer for an easy win is cowardly‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôve all been there, just ignore it when this happens, you‚Äôll get there sometime‚Äù
---
Something along those lines, either way it made me happy, but I‚Äôm still scared of playing killer, even more than I was before, I think the only way I‚Äôll be able to learn is if I invite my family or friends to play and then kill them in SWF because they‚Äôre the only ones who I can get easily because they don‚Äôt know anything about the game
---
I will farm BP with a killer I have good perks on so I can level up the others.
---
I wouldn't dare to say that it's only up to the Survivors "not being dumb enough to step in them". As a Trapper you can abuse the fact that Survivors, especially in loops, want to cut as close to the walls as possible. The bare faking of setting a trap forces Survivors out of the loop. Trapper is very territorial, but once you know how to abuse the way good Survivors play, it's definetly not just up to them being "not aware enough" or whatsoever.
---
And to be honest, the tier list you linked doesn't seem legit to me at all. Legion being below LF while Plague does almost the same thing and is supposed to be C tier. However both are all about abusing the fact that healing doesn't work / enforcing the Survivors to stay injured. Simply because good Survivors will NOT cleanse against Plague. Also Pig being E Tier while she's one of the best Killers when it comes up to loops in addition to a integrated stalling tool. Ghost Face being D and Michael B while GF is literally the most efficient stealth Killer. Doctor and Freddy being in the same tier. Whoever made the video seems to have a more...Flat view in terms of the Killers abillities. Pig's crouch is definetly not just a worse version of GF and the tiers don't make sense in so many ways.
---
But yeah, on the very core you're right, Hag IS better than Trapper, that isn't anything out of ordinary tho.
---
Surge be like:
---
Ah, thank god, so it‚Äôs not that bad, I always assumed it always meant you ended up at rank 20 because it does say reset after all
---
My favorite part is that BHVR decided that survivors not leaving was such a problem that that's how we got the EGC.
---
 If you leave the match, end-game perks don't work.
---
I played my special Clown build and turned a trial around after a weak start (two generators). I was able to keep my momentum even with traversing back and forth between hooks
---
Also I got my Plague the frumpy green frock so she looks more wisened and ancient, and I'm finally getting a little more keen on how to spread the plague and when to bring out the battle chunder
---
When generators explode (not kicking, explode like when failing a skill check) they lose 10% progression. So 8% bonus regression is 18% regression. Test it.
---
Just a bad spirit lol
---
Is this even allowed?
---
Console killers lol..this Spirit was hot GARBAGE, i can also run anyone that's trash at the game for 5 minutes, that proves absolutely nothing. I can't wait for crossplay, i'm gonna have so much fun
---
&gt; However, you have a 4% base chance to get off the hook when you're first placed there by trying to escape on your own (with a base of three attempts). OP managed to get off the hook on the third (and final) attempt and run out the exit gate while the killer was busy resetting that bear trap.
---
To put some context into that, there's a roughly 15% chance to unhook yourself if you try it three times.
---
Luckily not. Otherwise I feel sorry for any new player that chose the wrong time to start playing lol.
---
I hope you reported him. Sony is actually pretty good with dealing with that. People like that one need help. Jesus. Lol
---
28 I believe
---
I FINALLY hit rank 1 today and it felt SO üëè GOOD üëè
---
And for anyone asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù I wanted to get to rank 1 - it feels good to know that I CAN get there. It‚Äôs just a personal achievement, that‚Äôs all.
---
Nah, don't bother with NOED
---
Iridescent heads aren't even fun to play as imo
---
These type of posts get deleted 24/7 dude, but I understand what you're saying that comment was dumb.
---
I make 35k one time(after rank resetüòÇ)
---
they seem to be the same
---
Nah, i mean, yes you age, but you don't become a goblin
---
Indeed, that would be awful, in fact because I believed it was like that, last rank reset I waited 5 days to play so that the people my level of skill and above would appear in my games, now I can save some time going up by not doing that
---
I stopped watching half way through. You'd be dead vs an ok Spirit.
---
I love it. And it adds a little more flavor tto the game.
---
Maybe you should go hook yourself if you're that desperate for attention in this sub.
---
When gens explode such as when you fail a skill check they lose 10% progress. surge causes them to explode, losing 10% and an additional 8% progression. This is why the tooltip description says the regress an additional 8% instead of just "they regress 8%."
---
Equally stupid statement: if they are in a swf they automatically suck.
---
And you absolutely only played 1 hour per day.
---
Its not bm or toxic in any way. You just want some bp and the killer possibly wants some too since the quick match can cause a depip. 
---
Just a bit of info. If the killer is carrying you and swinging their weapon and walking past a few hooks then stop struggling. They're possibly taking you to the hatch
---
i cant get the link, just search up "corgi eat corgi"
---
Top ten moments before disaster lmao
---
This was what I got yesterday. Just so you know, this  WAS about how I shouldn't tbag and then he made this funny comment:
---
&gt;I'm not mad, at all.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I really don't care about survivors teabagging me, just like you, I'm just trying to make you understand that online or not, insulting people is still insulting people.  
---
&gt;You say that *"this is NOT real life"*, but I must remind you that the people you play with and against ARE indeed real. Pissing them off intentionally, even through a videogame, is just as bad as doing it in real life.  
---
&gt;As I said, I can't make you stop BMing, if you want to continue doing it then do it, but I must say that I feel pity for you.  
---
&gt;Pity for your family, for not raising you with good moral values.  
---
&gt;Pity for you, for being so selfish with your own thoughts.  
---
&gt;And pity for your future family, since they will have to learn from you.  
---
&gt;Good luck my friend. May one day you see beyond you.
---
All I saw was the last part and was thinking "LMAO, that's the dumbest thing to ever say."
---
Thank you a lot much!
---
The worst part of this in my opinion is green NOED. Seriously, revert noed back to exposure at tier 3.
---
Meanwhile, in the seal team six survivor lobby: "Huh, Ruin? You mean that perk that gets rid of the great skill check bonus progression? Seems kinda weak tbh. The gens still go down in 80 seconds."
---
Which is roughly 2 hours, not one. And suddenly the time investment has doubled from your previous claim. Strange. It's as if you have no clue whatsoever but still wanna talk shit.
---
Got any more or them frames?
---
What does that have to do with my post?
---
That circle is Freddy's sleep counter
---
This just happened to me yesterday oof
---
Just reached 29! Still haven't completed 2 Archive missions yet though (2 Traps and the one before that)
---
thanks dude.
---
* Do not bring your personal drama with another player onto here.
---
i got to rank 12 the other day 
---
then depipped to 13 
---
then pipped to 12 
---
then a week after not playing i play sum matches and manage to stick my first 2 pips on rank 12
---
3 days b4 rankreset 
---
biggest oof of my life
---
NOED is a counter to Adrenaline. Prove me wrong.  
---
At least NOED is preventable.
---
Wow! Did you buy any levels?
---
Yeah. Still kinda a good idea to wait. Since rank reset is just hell for both sides. But since you don't need to worry about deranking you can at least still play and not care, maybe even see it as an opportunity to learn since its always a mix of experienced and inexperienced players
---
I don't remember who said it, but this game will always just be a fun party game. I don't think it will ever be this competitive balanced behemoth of a game. I still love it though. It's still a great game, there's nothing wrong with that. You just can't take it as seriously as some other games.
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
Not here. Good wraiths dont need Noed.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Wow, nice! You must play a lot.
---
Unpopular opinion, I think there should be a timer before the killer can close the hatch. Like 5 or 10 seconds.
---
I mean,I like the Spirit,but the problem isn't the power.It's that there is no fucking way to tell if she's phasing or just standing still.And I think no one likes guessing games.
---
i honestly just want teh achevement and ill be happy
---
15
---
You were right! First thought I was chased by spirit due to the blue color but when I was hit, iwas also blinded
---
As a colorblind guy, I will upvote every one of these. 1 in 12 guys are colorblind, so I know there are others among us who have to deal with the same stuff. Colorblind options would make the game more fair for those of us who need them, and for those that don't the advantage of using them would be negligible. It's like wearing glasses when you can already see 20/20.
---
\&gt;  dislike it cause it's a safety net, it basically rewards you as a killer for failing the basic objective of killing everyone
---
This is kind of dumb because they game isnt made for you to kill everyone before the gates are powered so its not a failure if you dont everytime. play the game how you want but there is no reason to complain about other people using perks you feel good about not using. If you feel good about not using it great, i dont use it either for most killers but thats simply because its useless for most of the match. Its a game the only time morality comes into play is when it has to do with how you treat people. using a perk people dont like is not a moral issue.
---
I mean 4 people being injured the whole time has its advantages, even though it generally just amounts to people attempting to pound gens hard AF. It's even better if one of those people happens to cleanse, for whatever reason. I use to cleanse if a Plague was having a hard time and everyone was not healing, just because it was fun lol. Hook some people, and me, I need some fucking points and pips!
---
IMO, any killer that it is best to simply stay in the injured state against is, fundamentally, flawed. That's Plague, Legion.
---
Actually, 11.5%. I programmed a hook escape odds calculator once that takes into account things like Slippery Meat and Up the Ante, and luck offerings. 11.5% is the base odds with three attempts of 4%.
---
Alright, then I‚Äôll wait but not for 5 days like before, I‚Äôm thinking 2 or 3 and then it‚Äôll be alright, good to know though, thanks!
---
Rofl!
---
You explained your full time job and this "life" that you have, so that's what's blowing out my ass. I'm basing what I'm saying off of 40+ hours of gameplay a week.
---
You're calling my lack of life an "assumption" when I'm consistently dealing with this toxic shit.  I'm not even referring to proxy camping, but a first chase into full on face camp. Every. Hour. Usually it's not even me. I report and move on, but that shit should not be tolerated.
---

---
spies from the shadows is every rank 20s nightmare fuel
---
(*Disconnected*)
---
Because I said, "unless NOED gets cleansed"
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
17.
---
I, Giorno Giovanna, will just say gg and move on.
---
My response to "camper" is uploading the match to YouTube then sending them a link lol.
---
I put lithe on Jeff and for some reason that makes me giggle. The thought of Jeff being agile and nimble, gracefully hopping through windows is great.
---
Doctor would like a word with you
---
PS4. Very rare version of BBQ and Chili is only showing survivors auras after hooking for about a millisecond then immediately disappearing. Happens 100% of the time when I run it with Spirit. I'm not sure if other killers have the same issue.
---
I feel like they changed huntress hatchets to go through survivors bc i have put the hooked survivor between me and huntress and yet still get injured :/
---
Can‚Äôt get past rank 15 if you never get matched for a game
---
Did you have a stroke writing the title?
---
You can skip teachables all you want. It won't stop from reappearing in that specific killers web, so you can pick it up whenever you change your mind.
---
It can work with tbagging, too. A killer can say they are thick-skinned then get mad that someone crouched a few times in a video games. It's pretty funny how both sides can get triggered at something that doesn't really matter. The ones I see get mad the most in my matches are TTVs. It's pretty funny seeing both sides mad tho.
---
wish you were the GF in my game last night lol
---
No. You basically said oh well they didnt clean it so why save you then you tried to be a smart ass about it when I mentioned it doesnt take much effort for 3 people to find one totem. That's what had happened.
---
Can't get matched if you don't play
---
But once you learn to hear the world, you‚Äôll also learn that sight is not always the truth.
---
I started on 16, currently 45.
---
So waste a perk slot when the killer would just leave you slugged then use their mori?
---
Correction:  
---
Gen times are 80 seconds, so full Thana adds 12 seconds, not 16
---
I have never ran across a nice killer in red ranks. You might be a unicorn
---
Yeah, he's underrated unfortunately
---
37
---
I got extremely lucky with the Archives bug when it first got released and basically got 12 levels for free
---
I also finished the first tome
---
Thx
---
A spirit who isn‚Äôt absolute dogshit has no counterplay.
---
I agree she has counter-play, but that spirit could've definitely played better TBH.
---
34. I started at 12 though.
---
1. I‚Äôve been playing this game well over a year
---
2. If the survivor is an asshole and/or bad, they‚Äôre going to lose the game for you regardless, 3v1 is significantly harder than 4v1, is it the killers fault the survivor did that, no, should the killer show mercy to the player who got unhooked infront of their face, if they want to, I‚Äôm not the bad guy because I hit an injured person that is right in front of my face
---
3. If they‚Äôre unhooking before I even leave the hook to search for somebody else, why should I leave, what reason do I have not to stay and apply pressure to not only the guy who just got off the hook, who is now downed, but also the guy who decided it was in his best interest to unhook before I‚Äôm even a bees dick away from the hook
---
The Meg in this example wasn‚Äôt doing it to be a jackass by the way, they accused me of ‚Äúcamping and tunnelling‚Äù as well as you, because they can‚Äôt get it through their thick fucking skulls that killers aren‚Äôt supposed to play around your unsafe unhooks. They‚Äôre striving for enough emblem score to achieve 1 or 2 pips, which counts as a win, and not only does downing the injured survivor help me reach my goal faster, it also puts a dent in the Megs progress towards her goal for playing like ass, which will hopefully get her entitled ass out of my red rank lobbies faster
---
and this has happened this one time out of the 3 years of this games existence. that close to 0 chance doesn‚Äôt mean impossible
---
Queue times depend on your rank and what time you try to find a match. I play late evenings and I have no trouble finding matches. The longest time I've waited was 2 minutes. Rank 10 killer
---
@Oiinamiswan that's actually a really good idea. Hooking a different survivor pretty much guarantees you aren't "tunneling" and meh idk if they should get rid of noed entirely cuz it's like the only real counter to adrenaline I can think of. But it should definitely be reworked in some way to make it less powerful. I just dk how. @getmeabeermolly yea that does normally work by recently I've been getting alot of survivors in the exit gate before they make it out and it's like welp they can crawl out and get a free escape or I can pick up get ds and they get a free escape. Which yea 1 survivor isn't a big deal it's just frustrating to work for your kills then they get a free escape for like no reason
---
Trust me. Surv jake main here. You don't want to be here. Red survivor ranks are toxic thrash that do 1 gen in 25 min.(i onow bwcause i do minimum 3 gens a game when team doing fuckall). Literally any rank 18 is more useful than rank 1-4
---
You could run DS Death is not an escape unbreakable and whatever else that would be a good combo and youd always know when someone is in chase and where they are so you don't waste any time
---
When I see a Bing Bong Bitch, I do dulls like I was born to do them.
---
iiiii 45how to print money:? fnj 622 hjhjlllllllllllllllllllllllll p[6x6^90]
---
I mean if you truly think this is counterplay against good Spirits, then you should take up ScottJund's offer.
---
Also you say you're a "spirit main too" but can't recognize that this person playing is bad.....? As an actual Spirit main this shit hurt to watch
---
It's rank dependent. It isn't dead. The recent matchmaking change fucked the whole thing up. If you're rank 1 to 2 expect a 20+ minute queue to get into a match. If you're 3 to 4 it's about a 15 to 20 minute wait. It's about 5 minutes of waiting if you're in purple and green ranks and almost instantly if you're in yellow and brown ranks. There aren't enough red rank killers to support high level game play on ps4. Theres tons of noobs though so matchmaking is super fast for them. 
---
Red rank waiting times are assuming that you don't get lobby dodged 4 or more times in a row by boosted baby killers wanting an easy match.
---
Lol this is pretty great
---
I completed the first tome page over a weekend. The rifts been out 11 days. People bitching about it being grindy when it's not even half way through it's cycle want everything to be easy. Then they'd bitch if it was too easy anyway.
---
And NO I didn't play 1 hour a day, thats simply an average of what it would take. 350 matches split over 70 days is 5 matches a day.
---
Hex: Ruin level 4
---
Thank you kanye very cool
---
Shame we didnt get to see what F13 could have become.
---
Wait, a killer can be good? Impossible
---
Oh god yeah
---
Let's teach this guy a lesson.
---
I've made it to Rank 6 killer by using only Wraith... I somehow had fun every game I played for that season.
---
wait what! Hag a camper? I don't play a lot killer but I main hag and there is like zero incentive to camp with it since the traps can teleport you back anyways..
---
Literally as soon as I got into rank 9 I got put up against a OoO swf body blocks every chance they get and like. I literally bought plauge today people. I am not qualified to do this yet. Just let me puke one your asses.
---
Yeah, because they totally have control over your internet connection.
---
At higher ranks it seems to be tied into trying to hit the hex skill check or with stacks of lullaby.  Although the tried and true method of tapping in both instances always gets around that. 
---
As for lower ranks well they're just inexperienced.
---
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) a pretty cool legion cosplay video i found.

Try to forget being OP
---
But I remember EVERYTHING
---
!remindme 1 hour
---
Yeah
---
Nope! Just completed Tome 1 and have been playing to level up... Really want the rest of the Claudette cosmetic outfit *_*
---
Agreed about the console being irrelevant.  I play console and this was just an awful Spirit.  But it was a legit chase against an illegitimate killer player.  This is like when I run a potato for 5 gens on Coldwind.  Like yeah on paper that's pretty impressive but dude was horrible....

This stolen comment
---
I never used it, so it didnt bother me. I just watch for the doctor to point in their direction and I beat on them
---
Tommorow will be my first rank reset, should I expect a harder time  on killer than usual?
---
Man that's satisfying. Hopefully your friend learned not to be a jackass and instead just take the hatch escape next time.
---
I have the same problem as a survivor every few games, it seems to have to be with the server üòï some games are great, some are unplayable
---
The only maps I never do dulls on are the inside maps. I'd rather they spawn in a place where I can easily find them than a place that I didn't know the dulls could spawn. The outside maps I can remember the totem spawns, so I always do dulls on those maps.
---
Knowing him, he probably won't
---
I myself am a survivor main but damn survivors get pissed if the killer does anything that prevents the survivor from escaping. I understand hook camping is annoying but come on, they‚Äôre hook camping you for a reason. So if you tea bag or spam your flashlight no shit they‚Äôre gonna camp you. If I t bag which I rarely do and I get camped because of it, I don‚Äôt get mad, that was my fault for t bagging and I need to accept the consequences that come with my actions as survivor. If I get camped and I didn‚Äôt do anything that would piss the killer off then I just think they‚Äôre new or had a bad day so I still tell them gg and move on. No point to baby rage at a killer for killing you lmao.
---
On ps4 i have an issue kinda like that. Everytime i get a bloodlust on any killer i always have a second where i frame lag no matter what. Nornally causing me to miss attacks.
---
The fact you commented this is the sole reason I upvoted.
---
*Curb your Enthusiasm Theme Plays*
---
hes smarter than god
---
I haven't had any issues when playing survivor
---
You're right...I should farm blood points by playing survivor so I can level up my killer characters. This will surely give me the skills I need to be an effective killer.
---
Thank you for all the great amazing help. If I only knew that playing survivor would have made me into this amazing killer I would have done it a long time ago.
---
Good one. You showed me.
---
Bruh I just recently went against a Spirit with Noed and Insidious lol, the rest of he survivors could still hear her breathing/moan noises. Killer would still try to hide nearby the hook too
---
He deserved that honestly.
---
that's sad...
---
Yeah I changed mine to my m5 button also I and missed a lot getting used to it. So it could be that yeah, but if it isn‚Äôt what they doing though lmao
---
I've seen a couple pictures of this show floating around, what is it?
---
Somebody needs to learn when to give up on a chase and go pressure some generators.
---
I'm not sure why you find this to be an absurd statement but yes: only the best killers will be competitive against a competitive survivor line-up. 
---
Would it make sense to you that every killer could 4k every single survivor composition? It would just be the opposite issue in your mind then. 
---
The trick is to learn both sides and literally "get good."
---
I've made it to rank 3 with wraith before I started getting my ass handed to me, maybe could've got rank 1 with things like noed and a stronger will.
---
Lol I still have the laundry list of dumb shit the devs did to F13 the game fresh in my mind to remind me to never go near a product with Gun's or Illfonic's brand on it.
---
When I run No Mither, I don't cleanse. Everyone else ends up cleansing and then I get tunneled to death with Corrupt Purge.
---
I had a Huntress last night that was practically a stormtrooper. Missed shots that should have been 100%. Gotta love dedicated servers.
---
Bro you gotta stop posting these clickbait vids of you looping potato killers and using it as "evidence" that horrible players being beaten while playing Spirit means she is "balanced" lol.  This is getting hard to watch.  Maybe I should post a video of me running a console Nurse player a full game.  Title will be "Nurse is D Tier Killer, easy juke counterplays".

ARRRARGH
---
Yeah, plus BHVR is always changing the totem spots and map layouts. I took a few months off from DbD and now a lot of the totem spawns are different. I might run small game for a day or two to figure them out.
---
Quentin sleeping on the hook :D
---
Who owns the rights to Jason
---
SWF?
---
I second this. I really like the character design
---
That literally hit you though.
---
Depends on what play style you wanna play
---
Edit: lvl 40 is when you unlock teachables
---
It's Hazbin Hotel, by Vivziepop.
---
Ok, what teachable perks do you get with Meg? BTW sorry if whatever i‚Äôm saying doesn‚Äôt make sense, i‚Äôm new lol
---
He was asserting his dominance
---
While I've never personally encountered that bug, I've heard it bugs out if somebody uses a luck offering. That interferes with the 100% Unhook chance Deliverance usually gives.
---
What? That'd be an unnecessary nerf? If you take away exposure, it just becomes a slight movement speed boost, which would make it super low tier outside of tier 3...
---
Dont let youtube see you saying that. Anything but positivity over it gets met with retaliation.
---
luck uh
---
Each Survivor and Killer have 3 "Teachable" perks that you can unlock. They appear in the Bloodweb at levels 30, 35 and 40. For Meg it is Sprint Burst, Adrenaline and Quick and Quiet. If unlock them, they can appear in Bloodwebs of other Survivors too, so you can combo them with perks from other Survivors as well, which is why you should level characters to 40 for sure (unless those teachables are crap and you don¬¥t want them.)
---
[This is a good site to keep track of what you need and which characters are worth levelling for which perks.](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/)
---
Your puny brain cannot comprehend his 200IQ plays is all. ;)
---
No worries mate, best ones probably adrenaline which you‚Äôll get at level 40 (sometimes a little higher if you‚Äôre unlucky). I find that quite a few people get all the survivors that they want teachable from to level 40 then pick one to play after that‚Äôs done
---
I would run Small Game, but I'm shit at survivor and need a meta build to have a chance at escaping.
---
You got off the hook recently right? Maybe he went after you since you needed to be placed on the hook less than the other survivors.
---
If I was a killer main and I saw two survivors, one who was on their last hook and someone who second hook, I would most likely go after the one on the last hook. 
---
Tunneling is going after a survivor no matter what. Logic be damned. Say if a killer chases after a survivor for a very long time and that survivor wasn't hooked over someone on their last hook, then yeah that's tunnelling.
---
That's been the game for a while unfortunately it's a shame to as queues take a while and people just leave and make the whole experience unbearable and a waste of time
---
Yes this is why Wonka told you not to eat the candy !
---
I agree
---
Data or public WiFi, likely.
---
Go do a gen.
---
Is there someplace I can go to get the full story on what happened with that game?
---
How did he tunnel you? Mind explaining?
---
Very cool.
---
Ty man)
---
Hey guys
---
Scarecrowstface
---
Even with ruin how do people mess up so much, it's so annoying when they consistently mess up and I die for it
---
It‚Äôs rough going without any perks. I am not trying to be a dick here what do you want exactly other than to complain? The matchmaker sucks sometimes and matches you with people wildly outside of your rank. Hag with only one perk may be way harder than playing a killer like Billy instead. I dunno what else to tell you. Basically everyone has to farm BP this way to get perks they want. Or you can just throw a pissy tantrum I guess.
---
I'll send you the file later ;)
---
Earlier today I literally faced 4 clowns in a row, all running pinky finger. I hate DBD sometimes
---
There are always two hooks in the bottom floor on that map
---
Do you guys ever stop contradicting yourselves, I didn't think somebody was near, I knew somebody was near, because they unhooked the Steve in front of my face, mere seconds after I hooked him, your group of friends isn't every survivor that plays this game. On top of that you're saying all of this like I lost the game, how bold of you, I actually won the game, they didn't do a single generator like you said, they were too busy flocking around the hook and having their little circle-jerk about how badly I'm camping, "B-b-but thats imp-p-posible, he camped and tunneled, why does he get to win and I don't, waaaa, I'm a little pussy who can't accept the fact that I lost, waaaa"
---
It‚Äôs for Custom Game.  Not meant for public but yeah there‚Äôs extra spots for Custom Game in case someone invites too many survivors.
---
Greedy people who are confident in their great skillcheck.
---
Huh. I will now play clown, dedicated to this comment. Ive been forgetting to level him up
---
It's not totally random. The map is made up of premade tiles. Most of those tiles have a specific spot the hatch can spawn (some tiles are ineligible.) The hatch spawns on a random elegible tile, but always spawns on the same spot on that tile.
---
Isn't this apparently a banable offense now?
---
ill be rank 13 and get matched with rank 17s and 18s 
---
and when i get to 12 im with rank 8s who usually dodge 
---
im just trying to get to purple ranks as a main goal so i have more fun games with the way matchmaking is
---
Right? I make a conscious effort NOT to chase the same person sometimes, even if it's an easy down. But even in games where everyone went on the hook at least twice and i leave people crawling around, but someone escapes and others dont, I will still get accused of tunneling. I'm just sitting here like, am I supposed to just let you guys all escape because I already hooked you twice? I swear like 95% of people in this game just don't know how to accept a loss.
---
Honestly I just use her add-one because they‚Äôre fun to screw around with. Yeah, being an M1 killer for 60 seconds is worse than the base kit, but it‚Äôs hilarious when a survivor isn‚Äôt expecting you to M1 them down and goes for line of sight blockers rather than pallets.
---
Glad you note how strong the spoon is. It‚Äôs definitely more powerful than half her add-one if paired with Stridor.
---
It‚Äôs few and far between when I miss one, but it happens. I can typically get great skill checks, but as an Xbox player, sometimes the bar stutters and I can‚Äôt judge the time in which it‚Äôll land in the zone.
---
Never expired anything like this myself when I play ether killer or survivor
---
No the killers insanely overpowered for the amount of skill. I can respect getting beaten by any other killer but there‚Äôs a reason more players are playing spirit than anyone. She‚Äôs op and takes no skill. Coming from a killer main.
---
What‚Äôs the show?
---
Egc is fair for both sides. Lmao
---
People fuck everything they touch
---
You can apply that logic all over this game imagine being essentially 7 ft and weigh god know how much and having the endurance and stamina to keep up with survivors who are smaller and faster. (Clown)
---
Oh ok
---
I'm ngl I barely see doctors with noed
---
Context for this: I had been taking this Bubba around the entire map while my teammates took on the gens. I didn't want to do this, but I did it anyways, hoping it'd go well. I used 4 pallets, 3 of which stunned, and dodged around 5 or 6 Chainsaw uses, and in that clip, he was just about to get me down, when...
---
Didn't get hit once the entire match, nor did he even *try* to M1 me, or anyone else for that matter.
---
On PC I‚Äôve been getting like 20 fps when I used to get like 40-50
---
You fell for one of the classic blunders!
---
Sometimes i can play 10 shitty games in a row, not get any tilt, other times i olay 3 games, 2 good and one bad and then i lose my shit. It is really down to mood and mental state in that specific time
---
Latrice Royale telling it like it is.  Love it!
---
That's really good! Congrats!!!!
---
It's really strange to me that these memes from a show I've never heard of before started suddenly flooding every sub..  
---
Is it paid advertisements? Lol
---
Mori spamming not cool at all.  Just makes you look like a fucking clown man.
---
Hazbin hotel, it's on youtube.
---
I did trapper, but I‚Äôve done wraith too, I didn‚Äôt see the intermediate sign so I got owned as wraith though
---
it was my 4th killer game in total with 1 month between each time (played across different platforms, trying to figure out controls each time is hard lol, 2nd time ever on pc)
---
I‚Äôll continue trying to play killer so I can finish the archives and maybe even stream it live to end up having random people end up comforting me if it goes bad- it would be funny but when I finally do get a kill on my own against baby survivors it would be legendary
---
Thanks for the tips
---
People are saying this is a waste of a slot, but the information given by the secondary effect is invaluable. They could drop the first effect and it would still be pretty solid. it's easily a slightly better/worse empathy
---
You probably have to buy each one. Think about it. If they all have Auric cells, that would be very not stonks for BHVR
---
Especially in the beginning when someone is looping for awhile im chase and you don't know if they're in chase or if the killer is ghost face near you stalking lol
---
For me, Iri head is what I use to blow off steam after a bad day at work, usually only for one game though
---
To be fair, you can't bring sharp props or anything like that to the convention centre.
---
Ye, seems everyone is just tense now. Nobody is willing to accept a mistake or deal with a challenge.
---
you can if you hide it well enough.
---
That's the thing we weren't and they still got their game crapped on xD
---
If someone wiggles free, flashlight saved, or DS they are going to get focused. It it not tunneling its finishing the job. You can call it tunneling but it is really not. Not to mention there is legit strategy in going for the weakest link in the chain.
---
How did you get this?
---
I too fantsize and call pedophiles daddies
---
It's gonna be harder since Sole Survivor is bugged and you won't get stacks..
---
From what I hear it‚Äôs not that far for new consoles to be put out. Like for example the ps5 already has rumors everywhere so maybe wait?
---
I‚Äôm 7 as survivor and 4 as killer atm, so idk
---
Not to mention you literally need to be standing right next to her to actually see it
---
Imo just look at the walls and do generators. Or take a map with the ability to track the hatch
---
Lol that was nice!
---
I had that happen against a P3 Claudette who was a cocky asshole the whole game. Ran into a basement locker to bait me and I placed a trap right outside it and went to chase someone else. She stepped in it and waited until I went back into the basement to DC right in front of me, then waited until I killed everyone else to call me a trash killer in post-game. Now I know she was just following the handbook!
---
Today I went against a Iridescent Huntress with an Ebony mori. I didn't feel shame in disconnecting.
---
Thinking of it yeah David would fit at a typical punk show lol.

Good cosplay I'd DC

Thrilling tremors and I'm all ears be like:

Alright, since I have spent many of my survivor points on my killers I think I can figure out the build part easily, I‚Äôm sure the sacrifices will get there eventually, I‚Äôve been very close so I feel I‚Äôm on my way to a sacrifice or two, maybe rank reset is a good time to try myself out as killer?
---
People are humans not robots so it happens.
---
You wait until the 13th
---
Advantage, yes, not unfair. Nothing unfair about choice. People use both controllers and kb/m on PC and nobody is callin for kb/m to be disabled due to unfair advantage.

I'm not sure how it is on regular consoles because I have both PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. What i can say is in order of general performance from crappiest performance to best, it goes Xbox One, PS4, Ps4 Pro, and Xbox One X.
---
Ive played DBD on both ps4 pro and one x and its fine so
---
I hope so.
---
Hopefully I can get there one day
---
Either your a god or the survivors are idiots.
---
Go into customs, have someone go into spectate and then when everyone readies up the spectator switches  to killer then it should work
---
Hahaha triggered killer.
---
Thanks will try
---
Just the game being itself
---
Thought I remember some commotion about a month ago when a controversial streamer got banned with this as the excuse
---
I main nurse and this, spirit power has no drawback compared to any other killer and it performs way too well to require so little practice, but I wouldn't classify her as op if she needed more skill to pull off, right now it feels like you have a discount nurse that takes the skill of a leatherface to play
---
Your welcome
---
You missed it. It's too late now.
---
I mean as someone who play survivor and killer I can say: everyone is a whiny bitch about this
---
You must of broke rule #382 then, there's no other way around it if you managed to kill one survivor that was innocently playing the game and you hacked your way in and ruined it for them.
---
But seriously there's just the survivors that can't take the loss and blame the killer for it, there's not many but they're extremely vocal and that's why you see complaints a lot. Out of roughly 50 games as killer I've ran into 3 survivors that just couldn't accept it and were toxic, granted I'll give it back but really don't phase me.
---
As a survivor main the only thing I can't stand is face camping, I'll pull them up on that but at the end of the game it's the killers job to kill, if he inly wants to kill me first then can't really do much about it.
---
Just curious: Do you guys think it's fair that Killers can close hatch?
---
Lol that‚Äôs good.
---
Sure, [here](https://i.imgur.com/xQcn6OA.png) and [here](https://i.imgur.com/Vxhj5Td.png).
---
I just set it to record my inputs for a few seconds.
---
Yeah my friend has been rank one once and decided that he would just hover around purple and green because it was more fun.
---
This is an old screen shot from back in the day, where Flashlights were OP and Decisive was in full swing. If I remember correctly this game was against a gang of flashlight saving empathy Claudettes, hence the Head cosmetic for intimidation.
---
Imo clown's speed should be nerfed to 4.2 because of how fat he is.
---
Sounds about right.
---
Either way you'll be dealing with a pretty crappy performance. For the same amount of money you can get a PC that will run DBD 10x better and you can use any controller you want. Like hundreds of them.
---
Hag is trash trapper is god tier
---
lmao ds isnt the best perk in the game but sure
---
Jane's ass also clips some charms.
---
That would ruin her power all they need to do it make it so u can hear her phase while in chase
---
You can get multiple wall spawns in one game too. Makes for a helluva match as a low movement speed Killer.
---
I hate that ur not wrong üíÄ I rly just want a cosmetic w his old hair tho not this picture in particular
---
Queue times are exactly the same on PC.

i mean thats just spirit. i run into a pretty even mix of everything else that's not spirit lol. in fact id say clown is probably one of the more common ones by a small margin

Really? I thought they had the opposite problem, high wait times as killer and short wait times as survivor?
---
This happened to me for about two weeks straight after the last rank reset but recently I've been able to spectate again. Don't know what else to say.
---
At the start of games too now :\  Keep dc'ing from host and ending up in the menus at the beginning.  No sacrifices or anything...
---
I only enjoy the green and purple ranks
---
https://youtu.be/sZyG29POXJw
---
Sad thing is that killer will probably say adrenaline op pls nerf
---
I think its because some killers use perks to slow the healing, for example sloppy, thana, dying light and it just increases the time for self care to like 50 seconds when that time can be used for a gen. It‚Äôs best to just use a medkit, use Inner Strength or find a teammate to heal BUT I personally don‚Äôt think its useless like most people say. You just have to know when is the right time to self care yourself. Like if you‚Äôre the last one alive with no medkit or teammates, self care will do a good job but also adrenaline would too and most survivors would rather use a meta perk instead of self care. Hope this answer somewhat helps
---
save the rest for last
---
Still loving your style. Hope to see more comics of yours in the future.
---
Unless you purposely ate a DS, doesn't 9 stacks of dying light do nothing? Since that means you killed 3/4 survivors and the 4th one is your obsession meaning they aren't affected by the slowdown.
---
Well I‚Äôve been in rank 2 for like two weeks and just few days back I decided to try clown. It took a while to get used to the bottles throes but I realise that clowns can cut off loops super effectively. To survivors who‚Äôs really trying to avoid the gas, clown can get downs really fast.
---
Why not?
---
Provide a counterargument against why a perk that is pretty much accepted by everyone to be the strongest perk in the game, miss in fact, not.
---
If you're going to disagree with the majority, at least explain why..
---
Nope, introduced with the latest patch.
---
People who stand around doing absolutely nothing when they could just end the game are some of the worst people in this game, and by far some of the worst people in gaming, but I see it a lot in this game.
---
I think this game just brings out the toxicity in people.
---
The time these people spent after this person didn't just jump in the hatch is literal LIFE they can never get back. If he was able to jump in, in the killers face, it would have been all to just waste time and be a scumbag. I see it all of the time. JUST. LEAVE.
---
Killers do the same shit, standing in front of you after you're downed, as if they're some kind of badass, like yeah dude, nice, you got me after my teammate sandbagged me sick, please hook me so I can go play another game. This is why people DC, can you literally not waste my entire life right now? Worse are killers who wait at hatch or door in a way suggesting that they're going to give it, and then at the last moment, close/attack/down and then hook. What a fucking waste of time. It's not funny, it's not cute, it's not fun. You're just wasting our lives away when we could be playing and having fun instead.
---
I doubt the idiot in the OP learned anything. He sounds like a dent head. Imagine taunting a rank 17 WRAITH while in at least a 3 stack? This kid must be fun to play with.
---
Do people seriously get this upset about tbagging? :D 
---
Obviously she was tbagging you because that was a stand off, not because she was being "toxic": if you hit her, she gets the unhook, if she doesn't do anything the hooked person dies.
---
They fizzle. You won't gain anything.
---
When they farm you, dive at the killer.  
---
Fuck 'em. They ain't getting safety saves. Lol
---
MADE IN HEAVEN

She never admitted to child pornography dude. Stop making things up.

Will the old tomes no longer give rift fragments if they haven't been beaten yet? I am just wondering if I should avoid finishing the tome if I already reached tier 70?
---
bonk
---
If you're good at looping Adept Laurie isn't bad at all because you got DS AND Object.  Object is an amazing perk but it is a death sentence if you don't know how to loop.  If your chase skills are lacking I'd come back to that one once you know how to handle yourself there.  Object shines once you're confident in your loops.
---
I mean you could have always done this in kyf. It doesnt let you start a match though.
---
I thought i was the only one that noticed and isnt going IsNt ThIs BaNnAbLe
---
I'll be honest, I've played maybe a total of 5-10 survivor matches and the rest of them have been killer. You don't have to play survivor first. Playing well as killer does mostly come from experience (for example, being able to predict survivors mindgames, because you've seen them used 100 times) but a lot of it is also kinda common sense. Just patrol the gens, listen for footsteps, watch for scratches, etc. When it comes down to chases, don't put all your focus on one person. If you feel like someone is giving you the runaround and they are taking up too much of your time while gens are getting fixed, drop the chase. Especially if you've already gotten a hit on them, because that forces (kinda, assuming they don't want to get downed in the next chade) them to heal instead of repairing gens and they are easier to find because they will groan in pain. Try to bait pallets, so they drop them but don't stun you. If they miss the stun and keep running, just go around the pallet. If they start looping the pallet and you don't think you can catch up to them, break it. Damage gens when nothing else is going on. Utilize the fact that you can charge attacks for extra distance when you see people going for vaults. Like I said, a lot of it comes from experience. But one of the most important things (for most killers) is to stay active and constantly moving. If nothing is happening on one side of the map, there's a pretty good chance they are repairing gens on the other side. Also, something that applies to both survivors and killers: be unpredictable. There's just as much mindgaming for killers as there is for survivors. Just switch up your tactics every so often. Go left instead of right. Vault through the window instead of going around. Let someone think they escaped only for you to loop back around in front of them to give em a good smack in the teeth.
---
I know this is kinda long, but honestly, just play and practice and you'll get better at all of it. From predicting movements, to mindgaming, to not spending too much time on one chase.
---
I'm not sure whether that's more frightening or a Myers that's always in tier 1 with no damn terror radius. Have to actually pay full attention most of the time to not get snatched off a gen
---
Ghost face doing a Mori on legion and spirit :D
---
As far as i played this game I have always seen this happen except when I play killer
---
Tbh id like Short Hair steve with the sweater he wore at the end of Season one for Christmas
---
Using this logic, the Bubba that just 4 gen destroyed me at red ranks shows that Bubba is clearly S tier and doesn‚Äôt need a buff. Come on mate, don‚Äôt be an idiot.
---
And he has 8 stacks of STBFL.
---
It's very difficult to pip in low ranks because you need to make-up for your team, and 1 will dc in about half your games.  That stops happening around as often around rank 12, which in turn makes it much easier to pip.  So there aren't a whole lot of rank 12s.  You're either rank 15 - 13 or your rank 11-8 at rank 8-5 the pretty sweaty killers come out of the wood work so the difficulty of killers go up quite a bit.  And there's another steep difficulty increase where killers are ranked 4-1.  These killers require a coordinated swf. solo queue is death.
---
Best feeling in the game is a 4k depip :)
---
... cause they had a mori, op was injured and just got off the hook? I mean, it is the legendary "actual" tunelling, but that is the winning strat here. You can power through body blocks, but if your target vanishes to the other side of the map, well that's a bit of a hassle.
---
I'm pretty new and I just cant play against freddy. Hes like a whole separate game against him
---
On PC it was very rare, when playing survivor, to get a killer with third world internet, and it wasn't very common to get WiFi killers either.  Lagswitchers were even more rare.  It was such a tiny minority of matches where killers being a listenserver was not good.  The average latency has probably gone up for people since peak play times are regional pockets but the servers lack regional coverage and geographic distance crucial for RTTs.
---
The worst thing about the change is the soft ban on TR manipulation killers.  Killers can't pull survs out of actions reliably anymore due to the netcode not being adjusted properly.  Killers get their game states retroactively invalidated with preference being given to survivor game states.  You pull the surv off and put them on your shoulder, then the surv runs away.  You're not just double fucked but triple fucked now because; the game initially gave you the pull causing you to be momentarily unable to act, the surv is out the gates on the next tile already, you haven't even managed to melee them thanks to the first thing.  You just lost the game due to garbage quality control and shitty engineering.
---
I was playing demo and the survivor was teabagging on the hatch waiting for it to open.

He never made it in

I ran Dying Light for some time, but I asked the survivors a few times after the game if they felt the difference when I had it stacked up a bit, and they all said it wasn¬¥t really that noticeable. 
---
I guess it can be nice paired with other perks like Thana, but alone it doesn¬¥t seem that worth it.
---
Implying people didn't always hate spirit
---
I clapped a wraith like 5 times with the flashlight burn in a game and he DCed... felt good, but also bad.
---
That works too, mine was just one of many suggestions that would work. Yours is better tbh, mine would take away the point of the power lol
---
I had a game earlier where a surv used a key and jumped down the hatch, there was a few gens left to do &amp; there was 1 other survivor alive.  Straight after that endgame started, I went to unlock the gate and then got dc'd.
---
Should endgame start when someone uses a key?  I was confused...
---
Read the title :d
---
Can I get consent to boop her snoot?
---
Kate&gt;Jane 
---
Please try to change my mind
---
This is amazing
---
Absolutely this, though I hear ‚Äúforever‚Äù Freddy is pretty great.
---
But I run BBQ, Ruin, Discordance, And Pop And I‚Äôm getting usually pretty good games in. Gotten up to rank 7 so far
---
Blood point cookies me and my friends made for Halloween
---
But is david a highlighter? I didnt think so
---
But if you always say this was just not a good spirit than how do you know if the spirit got juked and messed up?
---
There is a link on my account.
---
Oooooookay there's no getting to you through your coat of false evidence. Okay. Sounds good. Sure I'll go out on that hill. Are you done now? This is getting really old. Just let it go man.
---
Look at my account.
---
You gonna be looking like the survivor in the pop goes the weasel art when they take one hour to do a gen
---
Look on my account.
---
‚ÄúFine I‚Äôm defending a pedophile can I leave?‚Äù
---
If I get downed by a Leatherface next to the basement, you bet I‚Äôm killing myself
---
P3 all killers lol.
---
Why run NOED? It's such a waste of a perk slot. It's an overrated perk that's easily countered by just escaping - which is exactly what the survivors should be doing at that point anyways.
---
If I got cancer i will tell the police it‚Äôs from this, thank you.
---
What? Mirror gives undetectable status.
---
Wat do u play on
---
I play Clown for fun and memes sometimes, and he has super cool cosmetics. Buff thicc boi
---
It would be like a game mode similar to Freddy vs Jason. The killers compete to see who gets the most kills, and one that does gets to kill the other killer
---
End game started because the killer closed the hatch they opened with the key
---
2 killer 5 survivor vs mode please. Whoever sacrifices the most survivors wins or survivors escape, you can hit each other every 35 seconds to stun and make you drop a survivor
---
Awesome.
---
If people miss skillchecks over and over, I just assume they‚Äôre trying to troll me. 
---
Nobody is actually that stupid. Maybe on the first two it could be a mistake, but if they‚Äôve missed like 5 in a row then we‚Äôre not teammates anymore and it‚Äôs war
---
I could see Ghostface and  Susie dating.
---
Dont use addons when u start. Dont use whispers, overrated on nurse.
---
Like the idea, but raise it to 7 survivors and we‚Äôre golden
---
Cool thanks!
---
A girl who‚Äôs permanently in high school with a guy who permanently in his late 20‚Äôs both from the 90‚Äôs. Yeah maybe but it sounds like a toxic relationship at best
---
I met a Ghostface who did nothing but crouch around with the group. It does put a smile on my face.
---
Naw that‚Äôs way to many survivors, imagine the body blocking walls
---
I‚Äôm more upset at the fact that you were just staring at the gen like a noob lol
---
Easy prey for a Myers or Ghostface
---
I finally made rank 1 survivor yesterday. The biggest challenge wasn‚Äôt sweaty A tier killers but the fact that every few games survivors would just DC on first down almost guaranteeing a pip loss.
---
Oooh okay, so ends game for all, even with gens left to do?  I didn't know that XD
---
You seem like a blast to hang out with
---
If that's what you think man...
---
All killers except huntress prestige 3 lvl 50. Maybe because I don't have all perks on them yet or I don' play this game long enough, idk. 
---
It is horrible that I have to run a certain perk to decrease the grind.
---
Ah yes, enslaved C O A T
---
Well actually In dbd lore she would be out of Highschool you know so they don‚Äôt  get strikes with killing of teens or kids. 
---
It could be toxic, we would just have to see how is personality is, they could be a perfect little killing match. 
---
It would also be neat because they could essentially both tag up and play Ghostface.
---
Oh my god... the legends are true...
---
Hey, that'd be great.  
---
Ends with a cutscene of the winner mori'ing the loser.  
---
But uh, what would survivor do? Just run until you die? Lol
---
On nurse, yes. One of my fav perks. However one nurse. Just not needed.
---
good answer babe
---
What the... 
---
Well, okay, sure. I'll play along with it as long as u write here a dictionary, urban dictionary or whatever dictionary definition of a mind game so we'll both be on the same page in terms of judging if my examples are within the definition. 
---
I don't care what dictionary u choose as long as u  post a direct source and it's detailed enough to draw a clear view. Wikipedia's definition is great since it works for every type of mind game I can think of (fighting games, card games, MOBAs etc) but it's whatever for me.
---
I feel ya, since the event is still going. Just farm.
---
Rank 1 people suck in general.
---
And I'm still thankful &lt;3  
---
I'm planning on posting the next comic later this week!
---
Yep. Get all perks makes it so much easier.
---
Red rank survivor is the only mildly challenging survivor rank. Everything below is easy mode
---
The last thing DS needs is more invulnerability to interaction.
---
So? Whatchu think?
---
the devs say it would give an unfair advantage, HOW TF IS IT AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE
---
What would you suggest as alternative adjectives for describing dipshit behavior?
---
I like seeing Hazbin Hotel getting used for memes
---
Yes I am a pig main big brain
---
I do too brother.
---
The dev's are mentally handicapped so that response isnt all that surprising
---
Nice what‚Äôs the song name?
---
34
---
Marley will you listen to me next time ü•∫
---
She was going for borrowed time then dead hard so both could get away but got screwed by healing by mistake
---
Even if you know she is phasing you still have to make a guess where to go instead. She still has the uperhand.
---
I just laughed out loud at my desk because this is me with every free game i got.
---
Falling. Trevor Daniel.
---
Using a mori isn't dipshit behavior. It's part of the game. There's a myriad of words that you can.
---
I don‚Äôt even wanna know how much I spent
---
Throw on shadowborn immediately and get used to it early on.
---
Dc the killer probably left or something disconnecting all the players whenever I play killer it‚Äôs always good connection lobbies unless I leave the game
---
Steve just fucking killed him
---
what would his power/perks be? I mean his whole thing is being unstoppable, but we sorta already have the perks I think would fit that (enduring, spirit fury, lightborn)
---
It feels so bad that I didn't start playing this game earlier
---
Same. I went to play DBD because I wanted to get better as a killer b/c as toxic as survivors are here, they got Nothing on F13. 
---
I still feel F13 has some things better.
---
Haha yes I saw that in the video. I‚Äôm a rank 3 sweaty nerd so anything to help loop the killer for 5 gens helps üòÇüòÇ
---
Made my day
---
Exactly. She can still mindgame and stay at the other side of the pallet... 
---
She just wouldn't be able to fake phase anymore, which is probably my biggest issue with her. Her using/not using an her ability shouldn't be confusing, we should know.
---
I would hope the best killer in the game would only be god tier if you where good at her.
---
I would hope most top tier killers would take a large amount of skill, but there is one that stands out.
---
Damn, totms are usually more open
---
This is one of the reasons I like ps4. I block random messages and go on my merry way.
---
I‚Äôve never played, but wouldn‚Äôt people rather just play characters they like? Rather than what‚Äôs the strongest?
---
I want Jason in the game. :/
---
Ah well good luck it takes practice tho so take your time and dont give up.
---
You can give fucking credit to the artist you know that right?
---
She might have no mither
---
she was complained about a lot less on the Reddit at least.
---
Sarcasm/a reference? Cuz this doesn't mesh with your long as heck comment directly above. 
---
Saying, "That Nea was wasting everyone's time and I doubt they learned anything." would have been much shorter and worked as well or better at getting your thoughts across IMO.
---
24, it feels like I‚Äôm not moving at all.
---
Ah yes. Mori‚Äôing straight off the first hook is a perfectly respectable thing to do.
---
Am I crazy or is his hitbox way bigger than his weapon?
---
No I stabbed her without frenzy then vaulted the pallet with frenzy and she went down
---
What a strange little scenario you‚Äôve created in your head there pal, is everything ok at home?
---
I got to red rank accidentally. I just simply started to play more often (then just 3 games a week as usual for last year) and suddenly I was green rank for the first time. Right then purple and in second month red. Now I don't know how to play stealthy anymore. (I guess I watched noob3 too much. lol) Also I'm only solo queueing.
---
Cant you just walk off?
---
I got Myers and he is super fun to play, currently he‚Äôs at level 30. Also just got my Jake to P2 Level 35, the bloody clothes look great!
---
I'm not the previous poster, but DS is mainly strong in only two situations: if you get tunneled off hook, and during end game. DS can be used in other ways, but not commonly.
---
Killers can anticipate when someone has DS if they haven't chosen an obsession perk themselves. They can counter by slugging the recently unhooked survivor (provided no BT), and then apply pressure to other survivors. The only time this doesn't work is if someone is downed in close proximity to an exit gate, as they'll likely have to pick up the survivor before the timer expires.
---
Good killers rarely get DS'ed, as they are not tunneling survivors. This makes the perk about as effective as Unbreakable when the killer doesn't slug.
---
DS is very situational, has a one time use, and does nothing for the rest of the game. There are other perks that can be used repeatedly throughout the game to provide information and/or survivability.
---
now, im not saying that you have no point, but I would suggest looking at Tru3talent's games against the spirit. He shows pretty clear examples of being able to mind game the spirit quite well.
---
Pow, you are dead
---
Darn
---
nurse\*
---
This is the best advice for new players. Set goals low and try to expand on them as you get better. Remember: as a survivor you dont have to escape to "win" just always try to be doing something to help your team. Working on gens, being chased, unhooking or healing, cleansing totems (even if they are dull it is BP and lightbringer emblem points).
---
I run BBQ only on Billy, Freddy, Huntress, Nurse and Spirit. Wraith is another one since Windstorm he has pretty decent mobility.
---
Some killers it‚Äôs fine to not run BBQ. Sure you lose out on the extra bloodpoints, low mobility killers like Trapper is not worth running it imo instead, I‚Äôd have another slow down perk, tracking or chase perk.
---
Bloodboint
---
I only used trapper 3 maybe 4 times during my dbd career. I feel like I'm going to get memed on by survivors.
---
So you can't provide a link or?
---
Never seen a fat lad with such pure stamina. If he slimmed down he‚Äôd make an Olympic team for sure.
---
I wish it felt like a whole seperate game against every killer
---
Facecamping is just ruining the game for that specific survivor, while using flashlights and pallets can be necessary to stay alive.
---
I'm at 15. I didn't have a head start either, and have completed all of the challenges for part 1 of the tome.
---
You mispelled "Blessed"
---
See you on the frontier pilot.
---
i respect your opinion, but i love my daddy so yeah, he's still worth it
---
I agree on the map view in the beginning that would be cool to have it birds eye view then it zooms in on ur survivor or killer wherever they spawn
---
Tbh just play how you like my guy, use what perks work for you. I don't play a LOT but I mostly play wraith when I do (rank 10 killer.) My build consists of Iron Grasp, Deerstalker, Shadowborn, and NOED. I'm sure some people will say something like "that's a garbage build, why do you use shadowborn/deerstalker when there are these perks that are better?" But it works for me and I've been using it for probably a good half of my playtime as wraith without changing it up, so I don't care if other people think it's garbage.
---
I don't understand why would want to rank up though. Red ranks is nothing but pure frustration and long queue times
---
This happened to my friend who is brand new to the game the other day. I walked up to help him on the gen and saw Michael‚Äôs creepy face in the distance so I immediately turned and ran. My friend asked why I ran away when the Michael was just standing there not doing anything. Insert me screaming, ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS STALKING YOU, DON‚ÄôT LET HIM LOOK AT YOU!!‚Äù and then my friend ignoring what I said entirely. That game didn‚Äôt go well for him.
---
dont heal in terror radius, or if you do, do it in  a group and take the risk.
---
Stop right there criminal scum
---
Tell me about it =(
---
Whispers,infectious fright,BBQ and ruin is a good build that I have a lot of success with
---
Dang how did u get to 34 so fast??
---
Yea, same here, seems like without challenges it takes too many games to level it up.
---
Really? It's never been fixed for me. The issue goes away every so often after restarting my game enough, but then it just comes back after a bit. That, and it crashes randomly a lot. Verifying my files through Steam does nothing
---
Nobody breaks the law on my watch!
---
This is the second video you‚Äôve posted with Spirit doing the exact same thing to different survivors, to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that she‚Äôs counter-able? Something seems fishy here.
---
Its very underrated
---
Some people refer to it as a "crutch" perk, but I like it personally.
---
https://youtu.be/EzOmrUvLkKI
---
Hour long video for you right here. This is the only place where you‚Äôre gonna get the actual truth.
---
46
---
Blame Gun Media.
---
They just use it because gen speeds are goddamn ridiculous right now lol
---
It's talked about and used so much at this point, it's considered one of the best perks.
---
I have this issue too, but in a different game. And only that game. It honestly just makes me wonder if something with the game software is interfering with the mouse software or something
---
It works like any other app store. Just go to search and type in what you want.
---
http://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel/videos go watch the past 3 months of his vods and look for Nurse games.
---
*cries in Trapper's totally ineffective welding mask*
---
Oh man that's hilarious
---
Demo is immune to flashlights while vaulting. Found that out the hard way ;/
---
On the iPhone there isn‚Äôt any download button. It‚Äôs just a bunch of forums you can follow.
---
Yeah, I don't really understand when survivors do this to killers that play "fair" and try to give everyone a chance even though it means they don't kill everyone. It is why I dont play like that anymore. Toxic survivors are gonna be toxic anyway, so I might as well do whatever I have to as killer to make sure they don't escape.
---
how about i do you one better and make a list of perks that you can use multiple times throughout the match without having to get hooked? BL and DH are both better. BT is better. hell even bond is better than ds. you just sound like some fanboy having a fit that someone dared say his favorite perk isnt the best tbh
---
I definitely meme on every killer I can hoping he will let me escapeüòÇ
---
I wasn't lucky and didn't get a magical free boosted start like some did. One of my friends said they started at 15, 15! I started at 1 and am currently at 22.
---
Spine chill is bomb
---
I guess I must have hit too close to home for you, sorry little guy.
---
I played against a demigorgon who got salty and called ME toxic because someone else blocked him from hitting a claudette who they wanted to mori while I was the only one at the other exit gate.
---
I would gladly get hooked if I got to see a killer get mori'd for it.
---
I‚Äòd rather just use my Ears and Eyes instead of using a Perkslot but maybe that‚Äòs just me.
---
I had a game where the Hatch was in between both gates. 
---
I stood on the closed Hatch and could easily see both gate panels by just rotating.
---
You can go to the official DBD mobile site and look for more info there but i cant help you with that since i have android.
---
I can respect that playa
---
Same, it‚Äôs only good against stealth killers imo.
---
Ya I also suggested that to fix prayerbeeds instead of being silent the sound could follow behind her slowly so she can still gen yank but it will be harder or change the beeds to moderately  decrease duration so she‚Äôs still viable but not to op
---
Good idea
---
Probably about getting the custody of the baby dwight, it is
---
although, The demogorgon‚Äôs lawyer, I am
---
Custody, I think he should get
---
It's good for starters because it's non teachable but after a while you're better off dropping it for a  more survivability based load out
---
Iron Will, Calm Spirit, Premonition/Spine Chill, and Self-Care or Lightweight, or a speed boost perk.
---
14
---
It's not best to stay in the injured state
---
Scratched Mirror reveals auras of people close by; sole survivor (if it actually was decent...) blocks auras; unfortunately it's not that useful until two people are dead
---
I think you nailed why they don't change it in your complaint. "It only encourages giving up" which I think is kinda the whole point. It's like "I just want to give up but if I just hang in there for a few more seconds, maaaybe I'll make it out of this alive"
---
Unstoppable was one of his things. Also knowing where survivors are hiding, being incredibly strong, terrifying when the mask cones off, and particularly brutal with kills. 
---
I like the idea of a building rage where he gets more dangerous as he‚Äôs pallet stunned, as he gets hooks and people are closer to death. Maybe another ability related to injured survivors, like a speed boost when chasing an injured survivor. 
---
I‚Äôm sure they could do something. I mean, we could ha e aid the same about Myers. Or Ghostface.
---
The dcs bring this to life.
---
Very confused with the clip, all I see are 2 survivors getting downed
---
Edit: Nevermind I see the lag
---
That sucks.
---
I think movement speed, but no promises.
---
Really good cosplay ! Love it! Maybe legion ain't that bad to face after all.
---
That's in a private match
---
Thanks! Yeah I think it could be a cool feature :D
---
it's not that she is bad, its that the cooldown is unfun, and can be super annoying since it freezes if you start charging a blink. It is the worst feeling to miss a blink chain window because you didn't wait 0.2 more seconds for the cooldown. I have no doubt that at least becomes less frequent as you get better, but where base nurse was fun to get better with, now it is \*just\* that bit more annoying to where I don't want to do it anymore. if I had to make a comparison, I'd say it's like if someone slightly remodeled your house and moved the stairs like half an inch forward, so your muscle memory makes you constantly stub your toe when you go up them.
---
make a tutorial on the costume or something cause this looks awesome
---
Before I'd bought the game and played on the f2p weekends i saw a dbd killers subreddit that was full of "sUrViVoRs ArE sO tOxIc I'm GoNnA cAmP aNd MoRi ThEm AlL"
---
Why help contribute to a charity when you can have something exclusive?
---
"ok camper"
---
"How was I camping?"
---
Survivor exits stage left.

What killers would you not want BBQ on other than hag

Well i mean, he's asking them a question: How am I a camper?
---
I‚Äôll have two toolboxes, a commodious toolbox, A ranger ‚Äòkit with extra gauze, a broken key, two Sport flashlights, one with batteries, and a large spirit
---
You don‚Äôt see the myers literally teleporting?
---
I have mixed feelings xD
---
This sub gets like that a lot. If it weren't for the gameplay clips and weekly threads I'd be outtie already.
---
the second down was from a lag spike.
---
Why the fuck did you get downvoted so much? What you said is true, as the caption for this says "fixed an issue that caused spirit to be viable"
---
This spirit
---
- Swings way too early and often
---
- Does not break pallets
---
- Does not try to mindgame at pallets
---
- Committed to a chase for far too long with no result
---
Her lack of experience makes me think that she both got juked AND messed up several times.
---
I would suggest the in game report feature or the website. Probably not the subreddit.
---
New perk: Cap your ass
---
when you throw a pallet to the killer‚Äôs ballsack face 3 times, pres the action key to yank out a big iron on your hip and shoot the killer, killing him and ending the game
---
Let me guess, accused vivziepop of being a nazi sexist racist homophobic asshat even though none of the claims have any evidence?
---
Just got past rank 10, can confirm.
---
Yep just got Rank 3 and two killers in a row slugged and tunneled. Life is FANTASTIC üò¨
---
Idk then
---
that sucks man, DCing on either side is really just not healthy for the game.
---
I've only spent about 12$ and that was the jigsaw DLC and Ghostface. I've  thought about buying cosmetics and killers but I never did.
---
Oh I see it now
---
Yea that would be a pretty good fix but knowing how this community feels about beads it still wouldn‚Äôt be good enough. It‚Äôs definitely a good thought though
---
Watch all of Otzdarva or Painkillers (hell even both if you wanna) tip videos.
---
oh but hey, OP, you're also adorable, don't you forget that.
---
Just been grinding. A lot of it was during the Blood Hunt
---
Thank you. This is probably the best way to look at it until we learn more. The Alchemist is definitely not Vigo, but it remains to be seen if it‚Äôll be retconned to be Benedict or not.
---
Not underrated. Everyone says it is underrated therefor no.
---
It is really good on killers with small terror radius upon the condition that survivors are going to heal themselves. Given that on red ranks many survivors run adrenaline and prefer to not heal or be healed if the killer runa sloppy butcher they will simply gen rush and gain a health state from adrenaline. For that reason nurse's calling is an ok perk. Also you need to know that killers with small terror radius are usually strong on indoor maps where it's hard to spot killer. In that case nurse's calling is especially good. However, I would not take it because, again, good survivors will prefer to finish all gens and heal up from adrenaline
---
There are always going to be people who put you down but I‚Äôm glad you pull through the hate. Hope to see you again!

---
What about redheads pinkie
---
Sounds about right. A lot of good survivors also stay in green/purple if they can cause of how toxic red ranks is (and how bad the queues can become). A lot of veteran players are there as well.
---
Horrible killer, great cosplay üëèüèª
---
ranking up is the only win condition we get while in the end game screen. 
---
You can 4K or escape and still lose, that's why ranking up is important for players. It set up an official win condition with clear rules to it.
---
0 because the rift still isn't on switch.
---
At least it's coming out this week.
---
Even Fungoose (mostly on twitch) can give good advice as well.
---
I'd worry about the guy with the knife...
---
Yeah, i understand there are tip videos but (I know i have the time to sit down and play video games) but I dont really enjoy taking the time to watch videos about learning video games, especially since most times im at work and really cant but I will save those names.
---
I have it on switch as well! Good to know they said this week!
---
It‚Äôs not underrated people just like playing the full meta. Everyone knows spinechill is amazing against stealthy killers.
---
I‚Äôm just pissed off cause all four of them were super toxic the whole game, and I don‚Äôt even have any slowdown perks unlocked yet so gens got done at around the speed of light. Only reason I killed one is cause they forgot to stop teabagging at the exit gate and died to endgame collapse
---
Immediately noticed Steve's bulge. Can't look away. Don't want to look away.
---
I only run NOED because of blood warden
---
people in the comments making a mock saying "don't tunnel" which does apply to the meg but not to the steve and kate. he straight up did tunnel. he knew they just got off hook and 4000% would've hooked them again had they not had DS (which i'm not gonna talk about being the shittiest thing in the world to do) kind of your own fault for not predicting a meta perk OP. should've slugged or left them alone. but to be fair the meg used her remaining seconds of DS in a really smart way. she went for save while sick with it still active so she'd have an escape and wouldn't have to cleanse. it's annoying for the killer but it's pretty smart
---
&gt; Matchmaking like this has been pretty screwed for awhile now. My survivor is rank 5 and I'll get matches with rank 17 survivors and shit
---
It doesn't hurt to do a little research before saying "matchmaking is screwed" and going around spreading igorance. Ranks 20 to 16 aren't affected by matchmaking which means they can end up in any lobby.
---
People might not like this but that doesn't mean matchmaking is "screwed", it is working as intended.
---
I feel like im pretty good about doing gennies
---
I love how you do this example when survivors spreading out do gens faster lol.
---
Restart the game and it'll fix it.
---
I love demo great killer :)
---
I was talking about the SWF
---
Really?  Thanks!  I'm off now but will definitely try that next time :)
---
Lose the amount needed to stack, to 4/3/2 or even 3/2/1. Instead of running away how about no scratch marks for 5/7/10 seconds. Mixing it with the Nancy perk would be good for mind games
---
It seems (from lots of videos and streams I've watched, I'm still a baby lol) that people just get saltier and meaner the higher ranks you'd get.  I'd be perfectly happy getting good enough to settle somewhere around rank 10.
---
Victor Miller, the writer for the first 'Friday the 13th' movie is the current owner, having recently won it in a lawsuit. Course the reality is that the rights are up in the air since the previous owner Mark(?) Cunningham keeps launching counter-suits to get it back.

No they were the messaged me after:)
---
You could try to 3 gen them the generator in the upside down is usually impossible to defend cause it eats up so much time
---
gen speed didn't increase dude
---
*4 man SWF all with Brand New Parts intensifies*
---
Yeah the same thing usually happens to me to especially after I get like 4 errors in a row and we all ready up and get into a match. It makes it so you can't spectate. Idk why. The game is broken so the only fix that I know about is to quit the app then start it up again.
---
Posted it after the game?
---
The $20 option shows me 2250 cells.
---
Auric cells are usually 500 for $5, so if you bought $20 worth, you'd get 2000. With a 12.5% bonus, you get an extra 250, for a total of 2250.

It does; if the killer has knockout and a survivor has empathy, the survivor will see the downed one as a yellow aura instead of red
---
Working as intended has become a meme phrase for a reason my guy. Do you have any idea how stupid it is that a rank 20, someone who is fresh to the game because you cant derank below 15, gets paired with red rank players with all perks and hundreds of hours experience? Designed that way or not, ITS SCREWED, plain and simple. I dont need to do any research to come to that conclusion, and you shouldnt have to either
---
It can, the thing is it has rules on where not to spawn and preschool is small and has alot of areas to not spawn.
---
[video for anyone wondering](https://youtu.be/oiuyhxp4w9I)
---
Oof, I'm a regular rank one solo player who in my 400 hours has never disconnected.
---
Thanks guy, you answered me all.
---
I don't know about deranking just to avoid a killer. I mean, if you genuinely aren't good enough to be at a specific rank and knowingly are holding your team back due to a lack of skill and the way the ranking system works making it so you can be bad and red rank, I have no problem with it, but just to avoid Spirit? Eh
---
Depends. in red rank if you dont use a mobility killer your fucked unless you wanna be sweaty
---
I don't mind the matchamaker to put me into a match with higher ranker survivors, what I don't like is having to wait foe 20 fucking minutes for it to fucking do so.
---
But..... That killer could just down them again and get them on the second hook immediately
---
It‚Äôs a really bad map for her or any killer that doesn‚Äôt have much ability to create map pressure. :( It will help to really know the map well of course because it is full of unsafe pallets you could catch people on with your hatchets I would imagine. Running perks to slow down the game is probably a must for you.
---
Ranking up doesn't mean you "win"the game imo. As long as I have good chases and if I preferably escape, then that game is a win in my book. Sure you are likely to rank up as you escape, but my point is why would you actually try to rank up? Most of the times I play like I don't care about survival, yet I still get to red ranks every season
---
ITT: A lot of asshooes who derank on purpose to play vs easier opponents even though they're more experienced.
---
That sounds interesting. But very hard to play lol. If you have any updates on what else the killer should do or perks please update I would love that.
---
You‚Äôll get the hang of it..you just have to make your hatchets count and don‚Äôt play a the survivors game.. I often will do that and chase until I get the down..sometimes it‚Äôs better to stop and go after someone else
---

---
Again, you might not agree with how the system works but you can't go around saying it is screwed / not working. 
---
As for "*do you have any idea how stupid is that a rank 20 bla bla bla*", if you browse through the sub often enough, you'll see that half the player base complains about not being able to play while the other complains matchmaking is unfair.
---
Matchmaking being wide (aka unfair) is a way to reduce queue times.
---
Anti tunnel and anti farm, yes.
---
What exactly about that is not the case here, or in general?
---
It's been high wait times for everything all week for me.  Killer a little bit longer, but both longer than usual.
---
My current build dead hard, spine chill, prove thyself, and resilience. Helps out the team and personally me.
---
They could just call him "The Tunneler", with his ability to pull you off the hook, see where you go, then toss you right back on 30 seconds later. üòÇ
---
So I dont have to play as\* spirit
---
I agree with the vault animation should be fixed. however I personally believe that fun is subjective. me and everyone that I play with has a blast with the type of challenge that the spirit brings to the table.
---
I can absolutely say matchmaking is screwed when it's working in a way that doesnt make a single shred of sense, but you can keep trying to gatekeep my word choice if you so choose. 
---
Also funny that you mention unbalanced matches results in faster queue times when I still have to wait 15+ mins to find matches as killer. Shit I've had queue times that were literally over 35 minutes long during peak play times at like 8 pm on a Friday night, so riddle me that one.
---
R/suddenlyjojo
---
Yeah but Kate's got kinda chonk thighs too
---
And she doesn't look like Fiona from Shrek
---
If this would've been a real game the meg would've gotten herself and the Jane killed
---
Yeah when I was just playing as survivor most of the killers would face camp and all I could hope for is that I wasn‚Äôt on that hook :(
---
It was my go to perk for sure. I think it got nerfed tho so I haven't used it.
---
Sounds about right
---
PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr though
---
Hes underpowered but i would go as far as to say hes low tier. He has okay chase potential with his issue being lack of map pressure.
---
Where would you recommend i sell them?
---
Was she injured before the chase? Maybe she was in deep wound state from borrowed or styptic agent and the timer ran out when she blinded you?
---
the entire time i thought  "is he gonna get head on'd when he picks up a survivor" but nope
---
Rip. I'm actually thinking about buying Ash with ashy slashy but I've put 4500 shards, alot of time and BP into Claudette that I don't want to play anyone else. But at the same time I want to play Steve and get the last-minute babysitter outfit but I hate Steve's scream
---
Genuinely curious why is that screw driver so .....big
---
No she was just injured, no borrowed time or instaheals
---
Yeah it‚Äôs funny when a rank 6 gets knocked down first and leaves instantly.
---
And...long and...cold
---
Strange. Yeah idk
---
Beats me dude
---
Tbf you would have been down anyways poor pathing no exhaustion one unsafe pallet
---
[bruh Kate‚Äôs got a chest but not exactly much thigh there](https://carboncostume.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/katedenson-deadbydaylight.jpg)
---
Also compare that to our lord and savior and [Kate loses in both regards ](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/USURQ21_4rg/hqdefault.jpg)
---
I'm being serious why is it so big
---
Probably the part where survivors ram themselves up the killers ass deliberately because they know they have a free escape and want to use it, rather than the perk working organically to counter bad killers.
---
Lol one time, the match has just begun and then I watched the trapper set down a trap by a pallet, and so when we walked away i went to disarm it. He noticed me and was gonna hit me, but i walked around the trap and dropped the pallet..  
---
I turned around to look at him to see what his next move was gonna be...  
---
He stared at me for a few seconds, and suddenly, back to the lobby.
---
I see a lot of people do patreon and give some of their models to patrons.
---
There‚Äôs a piece of a signature that looks to be cropped out for one reason or another up by ghostface‚Äôs shoulder. I think the main thing is people do steal art and other content passing it off as their own. 
---
Not saying you specifically are maliciously doing that here, but if you couldn‚Äôt find the artist and credit them, it may just be better to not post it.
---
Yay...I get to do other stuff while I wait to play the game that I actually fucking want to play?   
---
Fucking awesome.
---
Yea if you check my post history, zoom in on some pics. The best upgrade i did was print a vent called a fang and add a 5015 fan. Other than that, just the basics like filament guides, drawers for empty spaces, and i upgraded the bed springs.
---
 I think her problem is how many people play her. Her popularity has grown sooo much in the last 6 or 7 months. Playing in red and purple ranks Spirit is typically all you see. Since she doesn't give you any clues of what she is doing or where she is possibly going, it feels like a very one sided and not fun match (once you throw prayer beads in it, it's over).  All that being said I only would like to see add on changes and maybe some clues while YOU are in chase. I would rather go against prayer beads spirit instead of forever freddy who has no cooldown when he sets snares or pallets. And he can then hit you with inspector gadget arms. At least you die fast with spirit lmao!
---
everybody's saying how bad Clown is, but a lot of people are just completely disregarding the people that are saying they play him to have fun and if they're not disregarding it, they're saying "wElL hEs BaD". People play their killer of choice to have fun y'all. Isn't that what a game is for? Having fun?
---
 
---
Seems like a lot of people that play this game have lost touch with that and like to ruin it for others by camping, tunneling and just being straight up toxic
---
Boy, that rigor mortis sure kicked in fast.
---
Hey, my favourite animation is when the autistic white kid dabs so hard that he isn't a virgin anymore.
---
One time I faced a clown and was last alive. He was chasing me and I got so lucky with a pallet stun and found the hatch
---

---
What I look like at the end of the day, sending a snap to my friends. Lol
---
You HAVE to play spirit at red ranks? HAVE TO? Interesting
---
I play a lot every day at red ranks and since the re work, I've only played against her once. I don't know if that says anything, but she's not around as much anymore.
---
I started using Spine Chill after I prestiged and had only a few perks  to choose from. You'll see some people say that they prefer to use their ears and eyes instead, and that's fine, but it does a great job against stealth killers, and smaller terror radius killers. It also helps when you're in confined areas, indoor maps, and other places where your line of sight is limited.
---
I see a lot of people use SC for stealth. As soon as mine lights up, they'll walk away and hide somewhere. Personally, I use it to get a bit of a running head start, as most of the time I'd rather loop the killer than find a place to hide. It's also helpful for knowing if someone is proxy camping a hook when you go for the unhook.
---
SC lets me relax a little bit. I just want to chill and relax when I play games, and if SC isn't lit up, I know I can take it a bit easier while I'm doing a gen or something.
---
I've toyed with removing it from my loadout, but I usually come back to it after a few games. If I was playing SWF I would probably swap it for something else. I guess you can say it's my crutch perk when I play solo.
---
So how long do you think until BEHVR nerfs these perks?
---
Np!
---
I like how we're looking at age and not the fact that Ghostface is a serial murderer and Suzie is just a girl who was under some awful influence to kill one guy
---
Sure, I choose the dead by daylight definition. Knock yourself out
---
Man we already got our Dollar Store Jason; The Trapper.
---
Could be a lighting thing, no need to bash
---
It wasn‚Äôt bugged they just gave progression based on gameplay since the 18th of October.
---
thats fair, should have said not fun for most
---
I mean, people think SWF are like tactical death squads, but my buds screw around betraying each other all the time. Lol  
---
Killer found you? Thank god you have empathy, run him to the injured guy and listen to his screams in the mic. Lol
---
Wrong sub bro this don‚Äôt got Jason in it
---
Man the popcorn munching about F13 is better than the actual game.
---
Because this community is as well.
---
Ah either way that's still tough.. they're great killers that offer a lot.. that's too bad, thanks for the info though
---
Of course!
---
How else would it be balanced for the survs?? 2v5 would already be broken as shit. Survs would have no chance!
---
CHOCOLATE RAIN
---
New objective:moon walking on mobile
---
Yeah lag BS but he couldve just ran away when he started kicking the gen instead of running straight back into him. Maybe trying to save the downed guy with a pallet, but I dont think he wouldve had the chance
---

Justice Served. Play the game. Be a good sport and not a toxic twat.

Step 2: ???

---
Meh, you can easily not tbag and do it right. I wasn't gonna even wait for the grab but then changed my mind. I'm not upset, just disappointed since these are red ranks lol
---
Where can i find the original pic? Thats adorable
---
Some stay dry but others feel the exposed status affect
---
I don‚Äôt classify those shadow... things as one.
---
Damn son, get pissed much? Good to know you have the emotional maturity of a middle schooler. I frankly wouldn‚Äôt trust you to have a decent argument anyway. I mean, I ask for mindgames and you start trying to deflect, sounds like you‚Äôre the one spouting off random quotes with no idea what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Here's the problem:
---
When you say Spirit is "viable", you mean against the tippy-top, cream-of-the-crop, 1% Survivors. Correct? Thing is, they're just that, 1% of Survivors.
---
So if Spirit is balanced to go against them, she's too powerful for the other 99% to stand a chance against.
---
Nurse got away with this due to having a high skill-floor. That meant most players couldn't really play her effectively. This is not the case with Spirit, who's *ridiculously* easy to play.
---
End of the day, no sensible person wants Spirit gutted; they just want the playing field levelled out by either increasing the information provided to Survivors (moving grass, directional whoosh), or decreasing the information provided to the Spirit (no collision), while she is phasing.
---
You saw the /s right?
---
You miss spelled freddy
---
He never got banned from the game and was in direct contact with Gun Media developers such as Wes to fix bugs and exploits and understood the game better than the own developers did. 
---
Not sure where you got that from but I dont expect much from someone who unironically starts their sentence with ‚ÄúYikes, no.‚Äù
---
How many mouths you got there?
---
I understand that. But what they really should do is buff some of the smaller killers,  we only have a few killers that are actually good in high rank. If they did at that then most people wouldn't play her nearly as much.
---
just search up "Corgi eat Corgi" and its the first result
---
It‚Äôs really demotivating to get completely demolished by coordinated SWFs in red ranks, which happens far too frequently for my own taste in Killers (Plague, Wraith and Huntress), so yes, sometimes having the upper-hand on them feels good. Out-playing them and being able to apply even pressure feels good.
---
Thanks. I feel old now.
---
I am a solo survivor main , I run head on, QaQ, iron will (for the spirits) and either unbreakabill or bt (tbh both are needed for solo q). I'd have to say that getting a head on combo in a chase is the most satisfying and fun gameplay I can have. It itsn't a meta exhaustion perk but it's so much fun!
---
I never disconnect in any match unless my internet does it for me
---
I am a yellow rank killer and I made a rank 8 DC
---
He‚Äôs on that Entity juice.
---
They wouldn't be able to mori him because he hasn't been hooked yet
---
No, they all got killed with his NOED bro.
---
I'm one pip away from red ranks with ghostface, and it gets annoying with survivors dc'ing then I have to lengthen the game as much as possible to try and pip
---
Legion after their nerf*
---
The best part for me is when people get mad when someone camps when the doors a 99% or open
---
*someone plays spirit*
---
Survivor: "oh my god what the fuck is the bullshit fucking delete your account you PoS"
---
Agreed. I tried it, it was okay, but DBD plays and feels WAY better. Some of the Jason powers were fun, but DBD in general is better IMO.
---
At least we have Trapper. I'd enjoy some more Jason-esque cosmetics for him, but I get why they don't add them.
---
It's true, Back in the early days there was no ruin
---
Slug was meta
---
~~airbag~~ adrenaline saves lifes
---
I mean you definitely could have played that a lot better, disregarding the insane lag.
---
oh how the turntables have tabled
---
Because any form of communication attempts with poor little killers counts as toxicity and taunting, obviously :D
---
3 second stun to put distance, then at least the same time before killer catches up at all. In any chase that should be long enough to get to a loop, by that point about half the exposed time gone. Play as normal after that. Giving ample time to your team to mend or work on gens. Now say after the stun legion leaves to go after others. Guess what, they wasted time getting to you and leaving. It's not hard to see how easily you can waste a legions time more than they think they are wasting the teams time. Now all this is coming from a legion main because I enjoy them.
---
BT only affects other survivors, only activates if the killer is nearby, and only lasts 15 seconds. Dead Hard is actual trash, it one and only use is to fix a mistake good players don't make often anyways. Lastly saying Bond is better than DS is like saying Brutal Strength is better than Enduring.
---
The way you worded that makes it funny.
---
It's your latency, not hitboxes.
---
2v8 like Identity V. Tho that mode is just 2 killers being the victims and escaping from the survivors lmao
---
A new killer killing new survivors is my best guess.
---
Speed up the attack cool down just a little bit.
---
sorry but u know what I mean right?

You don‚Äôt need to mori them to get the rift challenge

Check your downvotes bud, we'll see who's really "everyone."
---
get a monitor, also this is not the right sub for this.
---
- Brought the Ebony Mori for the daily and didn't even use it how it's intended to be used because I don't believe in Mori's
---
- Chases unhooks because they're free downs
---
- I slug the farmed and then proceed to punish the farmer further by downing them
---
- Survivors were near my Haunted Grounds, so I proceeded to kill them, don't see the problem there, I didn't end up needing it anyway
---
- Completely unsure of what you're referring to here, please elaborate
---
- The game was practically over so I encouraged it for more points, also, I never complained about farming, I complained about the people who take it upon themselves to blame me for their team mates poor play
---
And I would be correct, nobody did do anything, there were 5 gens at the start and 5 gens at the end, all of your points are invalid and you look stupid, they ruined that game for themselves, I very rarely get games where survivors play that stupid and then come at me for their stupidity, most games I get into, people give me the standard "ggwp" and sometimes even go as far as saying that it was a fun game, I try to play fair but fair is not equivalent to letting survivors go for the hell of it
---
Edit: I also completely forgot to mention, I was also running Ruin, so nobody knew if that was Haunted Grounds or Ruin, so I think guarding it was probably the right decision, probably wouldn't have mattered with these survivors though
---
Can‚Äôt forget about those prayer beads and the ebony a mori
---
the counter to Adrenaline is killing people bud.
---
Like i said, i dont count yellow and green ranks.
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Pfffff 80 dollars? Amateur!
---
Survivor or killer?
---
Survivor games never really get to me considering the killer, but losing on killer is personally really frustrating
---
Because it's cool and I may play him eventually
---
The stresslevel...
---
Not really but atleast make the meme ABOUT the game go post it on the F13 subreddit or something or replace Jason with trapper or something still wont make sense but it's a step closer
---
Maybe your net is just trash
---
But eyes need a new TV. Mine Is broken
---
Me and my friends have this sometimes we can get into a game sometimes can‚Äôt restarted app helps and a lot of time after a game we get a error and have to make a new damn party
---
i think the devs forgot about adam just like the entire community.
---
Makes sense
---
I don't rage quit... But I really really would have wanted to after that.
---
Also I make poor spending decisions
---
Bullshit, her blink timer is ridiculous it restricts a good nurse for no reason and it discourages a new nurse from getting comfortable with her blinks. 0 counterplay? get the fuck out, walls are her biggest enemy since there are constantly 4 mindgames being done there depending on the survivor. 1. (The most common one) Go behind a wall turn back after the blink. 2. Go behind a wall keep moving (also predictable). 3. Go behind a wall slightly move in a direction turn around in a unpredictable direction. 4. Go behind a wall stay still. Now mix these and suddenly the nurse is having a problem catching you.
---
There is even counterplay in open fields. 1. (Usually works on new nurses) Move towards the nurse as she charges her blink afterwhich move slightly left right. 2 Predict nurse blink direction move right left as soon as she blinks. 3. 360 if she blinks straight on you ( works more then you think).
---
Look for anything with at a minimum 120+Hz
---
I just played regular til I got a 4k. No NOED or Mori needed.
---
Pretty much. Just mindgamed one for minutes because of tunnel vision after a flashlight save. Finally caught me and then decided to camp me. I swear Spirit players have no shame bruh.
---
how many moris do you get on average? i‚Äôd calculate my mor√≠ ratio is maybe like 1:20? maybe even 1:50, this would be a garbage perk, like a perk that makes hooks go 1% slower would be more useful than this
---
Survivors are getting all the nerfs because they started out super overpowered. Back in the days where we‚Äôll make it applied to self healing, medium vaults didn‚Äôt exist, vacuum pallets were broken, shack had 2 windows, killers could be stunned during any part of the pickup animation, hag took way too long to place traps, Insta blind flashlights, Insta heals, Old brand new part, old DS, and back when 360‚Äôs were crazy, killers had no power over the game. All the recent nerfs to survivors have given killers the opportunity to take control of a match. Survivors needed to be nerfed and killers needed to be buffed. All the nerfs coming to survivors right now are just fixing the shit that was broken from the beginning, and now it‚Äôs the killers turn to be nerfed. No one side has been treated worse than the other.
---
U'r literally so dumb u can't even get a simple thing right XD I honestly don't know if u'r trolling or not. 
---
1. U talk about deflecting stuff while typing a 2nd comment with some garbage in it instead of opening  a browser and googling a definition of the word u want me to give examples of. Again, how can u argue on a topic u know shit about? Despite me saying openly that I'm gonna give u examples of Spirit's mind games after u answer me, u clearly can't even do that. U'r literally the one making it harder for both of us.
---
2. 'Random quotes'? U'r on the side of most generic group  of DbD players crying about Spirit not having mind games. I should literally stop responding when seen a 'No mind games' part since it's a great indicator of a moron, even Scott, who at the beggining thought the same eventually admitted that even Spirit's standing still is a mind game.  
---
U even go on saying that mind games must require skill to be a mind game even tho that's 100% not the case, literally no fighting games or MtG pro player would ever agree with that. And u dare tell  me that I'm talking about something I have no idea about XD U'r delusional beyond comprehension. 
---
Please just get lost, during an entire Fallout 4 playthrough my character got less cancer from radiation than I did from ur comments.

Get Discord and join DBD

In my experience low purple ranks are the place to be as surv. You don't get sweaty red rank killers but you still have competent teammates who know what they are doing. Just fun and fair games overall, for both sides.
---
Its not about winning. Its about sending a message
---
Spirit was a larger problem than nurse to begin with.
---
Ikr
---
Hes a level 3 for me üòÇ i only have like 4 level 40 killers
---
Good news I completed bill
---
Where do you find these mythical nurses that predict every single one of your mindgames? Ive followed ardetha a dedicated nurse main and even he has trouble with players mindgaming walls well.
---
Funny thing is there are others who will argue with you to the death that red rank NOED killers deserve to be in their place. And here you are trying to tell me that no red rank killers run NOED. There are a good few by the end of the season when all the shit killers have managed to slowly work their way up the ranks.
---
Yup or with haunted grounds popping off right when u get hit
---
Clown is fun but he suffers more than most killers on medium and big maps. I feel more pressure with clown than I do with most any killer (LF notwithstanding).
---
It's always nice to shut down loops but if you don't lock in a 3 gen strat from the get go it's basically gg against competent survivors
---
&gt; when you face [...] gen rushers
---
*Oh* you're one of those. That explains a lot.
---
Dude, you're not in a maze where u cant see. Spine chill is way better and has more benefits

Yep playing the game and surviving is toxic

David, and shirt off.
---
It could also depend where you are in the world I guess but for me at least I find games as killer within minutes with a max queue time of about 10 minutes. I still get uneven matches being a rank 11 killer but I don't mind. I recently got into a game with two rank 5s a rank 8 and a 10 but still got 4k. If anything the unbalanced mathmacking only makes me better understand players and get better
---
Imagine thinking the only good games on switch have to do with mario
---
I‚Äôll try
---
I wait 20 minutes on average for a match as killer only for someone to DC and the match to cancel
---
Im sure it's a Bill situation. They'll come eventually. Devs confirmed they don't wanna have exclusive characters.
---
I thought so too, but it also says "by any means". Disconnects and sacrificed count towards it. As long as theyre no longer alive or escaped, it counts
---
Im my opinion the best thing you can do is replace brutal strength and worry about your gens more, less spacing on your traps meaning you'll trap people and be there for the swing/pickup. If there was another survivor instead of the cutie dweet you woulda lost the game :(
---
I was a legion I believe
---
Which means this was done solely for reddit... makes them look more like a clown imo
---
Bloodlust gamers
---
And how long do those mind games work? how many gens are done before at least 3 people are downed or killed.
---
We gunna ignore the fact that doggo was hoping his team opens the gate even though the hatch was open meaning the team is dead?
---
Pretty clear indication that your skill level is around rank 12/13. Otherwise you'd be able to rank higher.
---
could we at least give her a window vault animation?
---
Just got to purple ranks. Keep losing it because of useless teammates who let me go into second phase on my first hook and always getting caught by the killer 3 seconds after the game starts
---
Is he gay
---
Or european?
---
So many shades of gray
---
Depending on the time of day
---
The Jake goes either way
---
Just play regular and you'll get it eventually. I got it on my first try 2 dc's and 2 sacrifices, but still got it. 
---
(You don't need a mori or noed)
---
New game mode: 4 killers 1 survivor
---
Rank 11 and a rank 5 is a difference of 6, but a like a rank 5 and a rank 17 is double that. It's good you have that kind of outlook on matchmaking, but for new players they wont want to play if they get stomped by high ranked people right out if the gate. It's bad for the game's health in a population sense. My killer queues average out at like 10 or so minutes, but have gone significantly longer than that, and I've had green ping every match or I've left the lobby before it starts
---
Where did I shit on them? I'm saying there is countless ways to deny them their powers, and went into just one easy on, that goes against their perk. then I explained at how you do it. Others explained ways he's easy to counter as well. I choose him as killer because I love to bounce between players fast, jump scaring as much as I can when they think they are hidden. But once you pass rank 13 you become a killer who can get map locations due to aura reading which gives you general ideas of where survivors are. But if they don't mend you lose a huge portion of what makes the legion the legion. If they don't mend and use as much time as possible to do gens after you move on, you have a lot of wasted potential. If stun you out of your power in such a way I already explained, wasted time and potential. If you don't spread deep wounds and just frenzy for a bit and some map knowledge then just go after the same survivor, what was the point of even using your power other than a quick idea of where people are. The legion is not god their as OP said. They are also not bitten of the bucket either. I'd say a bit lower than mid tier.
---
say it with me kids. None of these are counters and they will only work once or twice against a good spirit!
---
but for real. He literally said that a counter to spirit is to have her go after someone elses scratch marks. People who say spirit can be countered dont understand RNG or how good players think.
---
Yup majority of ppl aren't skilled enough to get there. It definitely feels like achievement. With that said I never try to rank up anymore since I've already been to rank 1. Usually end up in red ranks anyways but it's nice not caring at all.
---
There are no tricks.  Only death.
---
That's my point
---
Why wont you let me die?
---
what the fuck is "noob3's favorite room"? 
---
not everyone in this sub is a 12 year old kid who watches him
---
Ya I love how ppl never consider the option that they're just not good enough. Pretty funny
---
Reddit says: Spirit has counters guys!... you just need proper lighting, placement, and skin! after that you can counter her weakest "mindgame"! huh? what do you mean after she starts phasing you cant do anything? just adapt!
---
? What is THAT supposed to mean? You're the one coming at me with the "killers are unfun" excuse. Me saying that is supporting my point of why killers take the game too seriously.
---
I‚Äôve gotten a lot better at nurse thanks to some randoms who put their time aside to help me in a custom gameüòä
---
I was wondering how this worked! Thank you stranger!
---
For you maybe but not for most players
---
God I just nut. That Adrenaline play makes it be the icing on the cake.
---
Case by case basis, if you watch his streams sometimes they escape sometimes they don't it's almost like player who doesn't know how to properly run a nurse get instantly punished for it (which believe it or not, are quite a lot of people in red ranks). It's a completely different style from any other killers which means you don't get much training countering it.
---
Rank 4 is red only to warn you that youre headed for some deep meta shit
---
I'm all dlc in whatever that totals too. Bought the game full price and a handful of cosmetics. Not sure of the total but 110-160 is my guess I don't even know what the dlcs total
---
Minimum 3 gens? Lmao right
---
You really should watch some tutorial videos on Youtube or Twitch, to help you understand the basics. But if you won't do that, you can also do the in-game tutorials (there is one for killer and one for survivor) and doing those also gives you bloodpoints, which is the currency you use to buy perks and items in the leveling system. 
---
If you mostly play survivor, remember that your number one job is to do generators. And if you hear a heartbeat, you don't have to immediately go crouch behind a bush or jump in a locker or whatever. Learn to not be afraid of the killer. Let the killer find you and chase you, you'll get better at looping and running a lot faster the more experience you get so don't spend the whole match crouching around the edges hoping to survive.
---
Didn‚Äôt expect good sources who says things like ‚Äúthis is the only place where you‚Äôll get the actual truth.‚Äù That‚Äôs what anti vaxxers say before posting a link to a random website that hasn‚Äôt even been touched since 2003
---
someone dced before the match started and I instantly got it lol

I think you use the same wraith cosmetic i do, blight head with a fancy suit

The rivalry between Victor Miller, author of the original Friday the 13th, and Sean Cunningham, producer for all of the movies, began when Cunningham changed the ending to F13 (specifically the final scare where Jason grabs Alice) without telling Miller. Miller took offense to this as he thought the point of Jason was that he was an innocent victim. Needless to say, when Cunningham decided to continue the franchise focusing on Jason as a killer Miller made it abundantly clear he wanted no part of it. 
---
Cut to about 1989/90, the F13 franchise is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Victor Miller sued Cunningham and his company, Horror Inc, over unpaid royalties. Cunningham initially tried to fight this on the grounds that Miller‚Äôs contract was work-for-hire (basically, that Miller wrote the script under contract for Cunningham and that Cunningham holds all the rights to it). However, he eventually settled the case, probably because he realized it would cost less to just pay off Miller than fight him. Horror Inc actually tweeted out the amount to date about a month ago and Miller‚Äôs residuals average to about $6000 a year.
---
Cut closer to modern day: there exists in California what I‚Äôm just going to call a ‚ÄúStarving Artist Law.‚Äù It came about because some lawmakers noticed a surprising number of authors of one-hit-wonders were dying in poverty. The premise is that creators are forced to sell their work for basically rent money to companies who hold all the power, who then make all the money if the song/movie/book/etc. goes on to be a massive hit. The law allows the creator to reacquire the rights to their IP after 30 years, allowing them to renegotiate their contract from a position of power. It‚Äôs a good law: in all other cases, it‚Äôs led the company to either surrender the rights to the IP or negotiate a better deal for the artist. And, since Victor Miller was only paid $9000 for the original F13 script, it‚Äôs quite applicable here. 
---
Cunningham, however, decided not to renegotiate. Instead, he filed a lawsuit to block the rights transfer based on the grounds that Miller was work-for-hire. Miller claimed he wasn‚Äôt and ‚Ä¶ well, to make a long story shorter, it eventually came out that Miller had indeed completed the script to F13 before the contract was ever signed. In August 2018, a judge ruled in Miller‚Äôs favor. Horror Inc filed an appeal and it did seem for a few months that a rights sharing agreement might actually be reached. Unfortunately, as of today Horror Inc has thrown their full weight behind the appeals process. 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing: even if the Supreme Court rules on this case (which is unlikely), unless they rule in favor of Horror Inc (which is even more unlikely) then the two parties will still need to negotiate a rights sharing agreement for new F13 media to be made. Miller only has the domestic rights to the original movie; Horror Inc has the rights to the sequels and the rights to everything internationally. From what I can tell, Horror Inc has actually been trying to get a ruling that adult Jason is actually their own creation ‚Äî not derivative of Miller‚Äôs work ‚Äî but have been unsuccessful so far. That would give them more leverage in negotiations since they could theoretically just reboot the series around that character and give him a new origin story.

tl;dr: Spite. Just *tons* of spite.

Saw this starting up in the comments. Please do not bring up the SWF vs Anti-SWF argument here. This is simply a discussion on my 10-minute idea that probably won't go anywhere. Whether or not SWF is too strong or not can be discussed in better places.
---
Why are you so angry bruh?
---
Ya I try to play extra altruistic and always sacrifice myself for teammates since I dont care about ranking up but same as you it's a lot easier to rank up and maintain rank now for some reason. Weird that I had to try so hard the first time hitting rank 1 with really good items and addons and now it's so different. 
---
Honestly the worst part about trying to get to rank 1 for me is that you cant just play the game. You kinda have to base your play around getting points in each category. Like as killer you have to make sure not to get a 4k too quickly or you'll black pip at best. Its stupid.
---
Isn‚Äôt clown a boomer? I‚Äôm pretty sure his lore says he was born in the fifty‚Äôs.
---
Yeah, you're right.
---
What an asshole I am for looking for ppl to play with.
---
Here, let me post something you'll upvote....
---
***SPIRIT BAD...... GG EZ BB KILLER...... SURVIVORS ARE SALTY.....***
---
Better?
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you so I‚Äôm a troll. Galaxy brain over here.
---
Ah yes the tru3ta1ent tactic of immediately throwing down all pallets on the map against Spirit and dooming your team but then patting yourself on the back because you got out.
---
Alright, instead of just being childish and mocking it I'll go through fairly example by example.
---
**Example one:**
---
(All of this assumes the Survivor is uninjured or has Iron Will)
---
No, dropping the pallet and walking backwards directly into her doesn't work. In his own drawing, if the Spirit simply walked around the loop he would directly collide with the Survivor and hit her. He can also her the footsteps of walking and hear the breathing, considering they are almost within touching distance.
---
Additionally, I wouldn't even put myself in that situation. You don't have to phase and guess at the pallet. Just spend an extra two seconds walking into the pallet as normal, then phase while you are in the pallet and the survivor is on the other side of the loop. Now the survivors only options are leave the loop, or circle around the other way, which you will outspeed regardless. If run into you the other direction, you will both hear and feel the survivor. If they leave the loop, grass can be seen moving. If no grass, The Spirit ends her power early considering she's only running around half a loop and just chases you, now out of the protection of a loop.
---
Alternatively, the survivor can just immediately drop the pallet instead and avoid all of this, with the caveat being the pallet was destroyed in literally 3 seconds, which will render the map barren very soon.
---
**Example two:**
---
Essentially the same thing. Use the power at the pallet, removing all of these potential counters. Additionally, I'm not sure if he knows this, but slow vaulting a pallet still makes a very significant grunting sound for all survivors.
---
He then talks about somehow getting far away from the loop without running as if the Spirit is going to use her power for the entire 5 seconds when she's circling half a loop, which takes maybe 1-2 seconds.
---
__________________________________________
---
Honestly, even if you ignore ALL of this and just mindlessly barrel yourself directly into the pallet, the worst that happens is you get stunned, break the pallet (at which point the Survivor starts running) and you use your power again in 3-4 seconds. (Assuming you aren't an idiot and used all of your power for some reason, which you should never do except for map traversal). Even being mindless like this burns all the pallets in the map very quickly.
---
Additionally basically every example he gives is under the huge assumption that everyone has Iron Will or is never injured. Otherwise, you can pretty much pinpoint positioning down to a meter with good sound awareness.
---
His talk on "conditioning" doesn't even matter because if the Spirit is good and downs you within 20 seconds, you haven't had the time to study anything. For all you know she can just proxy camp you and you won't even have another chance to get to another window or pallet. This is not a fighting game. You go down in 2 hits, not 20. You don't have the time to condition people (unless they repeatedly misuse her power, at which point you have more time to study them instead of being dead)
---
obsession gives no stacks. 9 stacks means you hooked the 3 non-obsession survivors 3 times each, i.e. you killed them. Therefore Dying Light does absolutely nothing for you at that point since Dying Light doesn't give it's slowdown to the obsession.
---
The only possible way to get this and it still come into affect, is to 2 hook someone, then tunnel them off their 2nd hook and hope they DS you, then hook everyone else 2 times +3 hook at least 1 of them to have 1 dead survivor, the obsession still alive, and 2 survivors affected by 9 stacks of Dying Light.

he‚Äôs good tho
---
Yeah getting that too, almost after every game. As long as everyone hits ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù it generally is fine it‚Äôs when you sit in the post match screen for too long then the party seems to bug out. 
---
Also noticed a lot of lag problems but only when playing against the huntress and especially when she charges her axe
---
Well he probably lost a rank too then if he did what you said he was, so it is a valid strategy to not rank up.
---
That is all I can hope for I guess...
---
That right there is the difference between good killers and bad killers. Knowing when the chase, when to back off, and how far it's safe to extend will make or break games.
---
I like that suggestion alot actually. I still think 4/3/2 is better as its only losing chase which if you can loop well happens alot.
---
Stbfl discordance infectious whispers even agitation would work better at least imo.
---
Besides, ranking up isn't to hard. Unless you get camped every game. Which I haven't experienced.
---
6 survivors, 7 gens needed to be capped. 2 hatches spawn.
---
Wish killers were good enough to be able to incorporate this sort of strategy, but fuck balance amiright
---
It's kill by any means. Kill, sacrifice, EGC timer, RBT, DC, everything counts. You just need a 4k of any sort and you're golden. 
---
I got mine by having a loading DC, which made it super easy.
---
Then the Killer is smart and has exploited the fact that survivors don¬¥t know how the game works. 
---
Camping is easily punishable and it¬¥s a terrible strategy against anyone who knows how to play the game. BHVR doesn¬¥t need to do anything for people who don¬¥t know how the game is played. Games are not supposed to be balanced around bad players.
---
Disconnecting is a completely different issue.

r/YouFellForItFool
---
Yea I don't get that affected by it that much tho. Like I usually get rank 5s with 12s kinda like that spectrum but you can't really tell the difference in gameplay between them imo. Doesn't really matter too much games still fun
---
Deliverance can give you 1500 survival and then 5k for escaping, thus 7500, you have to have a killer with an obsession perk or an ally with DS and get lucky to be the obsession, but if they DS the killer you lose obsession... so... You kinda have to run DS
---
Oh wow. Didn't know it was that bad... Yaaay Fun... :/
---
Especially when you've been tunneled the whole game, didn't have time to cleanse totems and other survivors pop the last gen. You're running for the exit gates and bam, NOED.
---
Ehh Trapper just needs QoL changes. Even now his traps can let him snowball quickly. Clown sadly will probably lose most games but I nonetheless find him fun to play as.
---
No because if they keep nerfing killers we won't have any viable killers at red ranks.
---
Survivors will win since killers will be too weak.
---
this gets worse the longer you look at it
---
Tangent, but what really makes me laugh about "Dollar Store knockoff" is how Hillbilly is a blatant generic Leatherface. Both are disfigured abused backwoods country bumpkins that went cannibal, use a chainsaw AND a sledgehammer. The final joke though is that Hillbilly, the generic ripoff, has the stronger kit and LF is a joke.
---
Only reason it affects me is because I have friends that wont try the game or they stop playing quickly because of it. At rank 5, either I get someone my rank or someone worse (it's just more boring if they're worse), but I can empathize with new players that get discouraged.
---
Oh yeah - my killer needs a LOT of work. I‚Äôve hit rank 14 so far and find myself black pipping a lot because I don‚Äôt put enough pressure on survivors and let them heal a lot. 
---
But with my survivor, I almost always find a Hex straight off the bat, get a gen done, unhook, heal, run and repeat. There are few games where I‚Äôm hooked often now. It‚Äôs like a switch flipped and suddenly it‚Äôs easy?
---
Yes, but to some degree alot of Trevor's works have some sort of twisty, unnatural movements
---
I'm pretty sure he is a boomer.
---
Im pretty sure its just stretching Fred into the trappers model since he is the only killer likely modeled for stepping in traps. Its not Freddys "True Hitbox".

For real though I just use it to make my game look better.

I mean if I feel like a likely win I‚Äôll run iridescent heads and a mori just for the fun of it lol.

I would feel bad for a killer who‚Äôs trying to get points lol.

I would love to do it, but I don‚Äôt have anyone to do it with. Most people on Xbox just want to win.

The Spirit is Ded!?

Yeah this happens to me almost every game on PS4 :/ it's annoying bcos I love spectating

It's been suggested for years, but having prestige be like..a filter, you can apply over all cosmetics would be dope, and make prestige more worth it.

It's way too much work for them though..

That sucks....  Guess i know what char I'm buying next

Yea that's the same with me a little too. My friends won't play or give it a go and get fucked extremely hard and rage quit but I do sometimes use a fresh account so we can all get rank 20s and than I change to my main when they get better. It sucks tho
---
He covered 3/5 of the things you mentioned, so I'll answer yes :D
---
David prod Jake every now and then. That's what friends do for each other.
---
I think it's an understandable change given that previously if the killer didn't have to have tracking perks they would basically have to wander around until they either find the survivor by pure chance (unlikely since most players were immersed at this point in the game) or the survivor found the hatch after 5-10 minutes of walking around the edge of the map. Closing the hatch allows the killer to end the game relatively quickly so they can move on to other matches. That said, there are likely better ways of resolving this issue. One that I came up with would be allowing the killer to retrieve something from the hatch which would give them the aura of the last survivor when they're a certain distance away. That would allow the killer to end the match on their own terms without completely screwing over the survivor. Alternatively, [Tru3Ta1ent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLGeS2Wb6c) came up with an alternative finale which removes the hatch entirely.
---
That would be the hardest DC of my life dude
---
Is it really that hard? I did it before I had Reddit.
---
Let‚Äôs just say that they do more than go *upside down*
---
Nah they should be on the Soulja boy Console port of Dbd.
---
It's also a private match
---
If they nerf spirit (which they will) they really r e a l l y need to make more killers viable by buffing them. We have three out of like 17 killers that are actually viable at high ranks and thats a lil nuts imo.
---
Let me know what you guys think because jeez this guy was toxic
---
Yeah, maybe this would be a KYF variant that friends could play while swapping the killer role.
---
I find this very coincidental because I've been watching this over and over recently
---
Don‚Äôt know that the police care how you got cancer tbh
---
Red ranks are just a shit shoot. On average the survivors are better. But you still get a lot of people who know clue how to manage time properly. Going down to very simple mindgames rather quickly and running to the edge of the map to heal themselves or be heal. And I'm pretty sure red rankers are the most baby like as DC's are super common. The only trend I noticed is that the killer are consistently better. Cause they can't just skate their way off other people's work to rank one. So more of a challenge. Swf is another beast entirely I come across more of those sweaty swf at mid purple than Red. When it's swf though rank does not play a factor just the killer's rank.
---
I have a friend that literally plays 2 games with me, starts raging on discord with stuff like "I fucking hate this game", "this game is trash", etc as soon as he goes down and gets thrown on a hook. I know how this game works, so even if I get stomped I realize its cause of something I did wrong, but that's also because I actually have perks where as my friend only has dwight's stuff
---
So, you think that should have it? Lol
---
I definitely use premonition more than spine chill because it makes more sense to use for me. Knowing which way the killer is in general&gt;knowing when the killer is looking my direction from some angle.
