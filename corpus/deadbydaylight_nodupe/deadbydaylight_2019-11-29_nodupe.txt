Wish the sale also extended into Iri-shards rather than just Auric Cells
---
---
---
Yes.  Get all the perks except for the one you‚Äôll never use. Then just avoid it. Helps filter through bad webs sometimes.
---
This sub is not mainly killer mains mate. I‚Äôve seen more survivors and entitled survivors then I have killers or entitled killers.
---
I've never played FNAF, but their worldbuilding is very interesting and would be very cool to see in DbD. I could imagine Dwight or maybe even Meg getting an employee cosmetic for the pizza joint
---

---
The potential for cosmetics would also be pretty cool, like with Legion; we know there are multiple animatronics
---
you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
I see he made a meme... but I literally don‚Äôt see anything else about OP obsessively hating on tru3? 
---
I watched tru3 like two times and he wasn‚Äôt my thing but I don‚Äôt see how OP is being insane or having a hate boner for making a meme.
---
Now you know how survivors feel when they are being tunnelled.
---
Who T bags against a huntress with iridescent heads lol
---
Toxic
---
Or you can also get down from your high horse and see that people who complains about them, usually, are replying to people like you who only complains about moris, ignoring keys that are way more common
---
Just sayin'
---
He's not. I suspect the OP might be Tru3's stream sniper and is trying to stir things up.  It's kind of sad.
---
Wrong, my game only sometimes (about 1 out of 70) freezes when I get hitted
---
very nice üëç
---
Sure, we‚Äôll put on a farm map offering and bring toolboxes. I‚Äôm sure you can defend against 60 second solo gens.
---
Like do you not understand it‚Äôs not a killer problem at all. It‚Äôs a problem with gen speed and comms. You can literally play you best game ever and still lose.
---
I do it all the time. I get points for closing the hatch. We both get points for chasing to the gate, and they get points for opening the gate. 
---
We all get more xp
---
Well red ranks escape rate is about 35%, what you have to say about that?
---
Thats true :/ I think it might be a bit weird to get used to, especially spies from the shadows, iron grasp or third seal (do people use those perks i havent had a game with them in a while) or perks that are considered good but underused, theres also perks that are so broken, people dont use. Theres other criteria but i think it might be deemed unfair for survivors, I guess theres totem but those are on an optional to-do list, not really required to do.
---
I think just number changes or add on buffs, heck even making totem spawns harder to find could be good. Im terrible at advice but I think its an okay idea, but changing the entire perk system would be weird. Maybe you have to be a certain rank and prestige to do so.
---
Killers can also go through windows and break pallets. So going by your logic, those are perks too.
---
The boys staring at the package of beans at 3 am
---
while that's probably true for a lot of incels, there are people out there who for various reasons are just hopeless when it comes to getting laid. Like 99% of them still end up being bitter cunts with completely warped worldviews, but I'd say at least the bitter part is understandable.
---
Its very strange in a game designed to kill survivors the side that needs to kill gets an offering ti pretty much unstantly do this. Thats just bad design...
---
Bull, and might I add, shit. I've been a rank 16 killer against rank 8 survivors. Granted it was a Wednesday night and probably a swf but still.
---
Why is ruin a "given" a lot of higher ranked killers don't even use it.
---
Yet the posts show evidence, count all the posts in the last day or even the hour not including memes that show both or neither, and you will see there are more killer posts.
---
Ive known that and that's exactly why i dont do it even though sometimes it leads to a depip. I had a nurse daily and i suck with nurse. It took 3 games to do it since i was in huge maps and only found the same people but didn't wanna chase them
---
Thank you! This means a lot. I love making these concepts. I‚Äôm converting them to docs since most of mine are on paper. I‚Äôve done Jason, The Thing, Alien and even done a Resident Evil chapter. Surprisingly I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble with doing one for Candyman.
---
I can tell you the perks I came up with if you want
---
I really think you‚Äôre underestimating the fan base behind the series. The VR game was released, then an AR game this year. Plus a movie, novels, and two or three new games.
---
but im definitely not saying that it belongs in DbD, because it doesn‚Äôt really
---
Well firstly recompiling the shoes off of the legs would be a massive undertaking in of it‚Äôs self many man hours would have to go into making them separate, then they would have to do their best to prevent the inevitable clipping all the new combinations would cause, and they would still have to add more detail like socks and calves to many of the shoe models to ensure there aren‚Äôt any kinds of seams around the ankles, all of which would be a case by case per survivor. All this to say, a lot of work goes into making sure the cosmetics look  good as is, and the current design was chosen deliberately since the beta of this game as a compromise between efficiency and customizability.
---
I have to do 3 full gens in a single match...
---
Hiding lobbies doesn‚Äôt work in any game. Ppl always find a way. How do you think OW, Fortnite and apex streamers get sniped so much? Plenty of ppl tried hiding their lobbies and eventually just gave up.
---
Edit: not defending him, just pointing out hiding lobbies has been tried in many games and it doesn‚Äôt work.
---
Your welcome
---
After watching good huntress players like Umbra, it‚Äôs hard to watch him play as huntress lol.
---
D √´ m o n ?
---
Its mostly for some perks to see some use on top of an experement. Balancing can be a slippery slope, so what if this little nudge makes it easier to buff, or negate the need to buff. Not all killers are created equally.
---
Point out in my post where I'm complaining about Mori. Maybe read the full post before replying.
---
It's not impossible, 1 hook is simple, and if a second person goes down it's your time to shine. It's just dumb that it's the 2nd required one. 
---
It's difficult but far from impossible, Would much prefer these actual challenge ones to be on the side branches.
---
Workin on it :( I wish there was an online DBD discussion community that wasn't flooded with these sorts of complaints. It's fun chatting with people about games we collectively like so I'm just slowly making the switch to not doing that anymore. It's tough &gt;.&lt;
---
Easy solution. Ebony Mori lets you kill all survivors who would be on death hook, green one lets you kill 1 Survivor when you have hooked every survivor at least once.
---
If you make keys to weak they lose all purpose.
---
I have a couple concepts for some licensed and original characters, specifically Billy from ‚ÄòSilent Night Deadly Night‚Äô, but I‚Äôd certainly love to hear about yours if you want to pm them to me
---
It is if you‚Äôre referring to me and my team‚Äôs play style. You can‚Äôt slug us, you can‚Äôt hook us, insane gen speed.. how would you win?
---
I agree with u/Nerdherder72 - I don't mind the "grind" ones, since I'm free to damage gens/pallets or make unhooks without having to make it my whole focus. Sure, it'll take a few games, but it's a 70 day Rift and things like unhooks and Basement hooks are just a part of normal gameplay. Some of the Master challenges are fine too - playing a normal game but with the addition of Spine Chill, for example.
---
My personal issue is with the Master challenges that required *everyone* in the Trial to act a certain way. The NOED one is virtually reliant on a specific build with a mobile killer, and furthermore requires that the survivors don't rage quit due to it. Likewise, the EGC rescue is reliant on the killer not standing beside their hook. Imagine the hassle when these two challenges interact? The killer has to sit beside their hooks with NOED, the two remaining survivors will likely need to find and break the NOED totem or pray that the killer will follow one of them while the other makes the unhooks. With a SWF, it could work - but with random players? The average player?
---
I feel it's important to separate the Rift from the Lore - these Master challenges are what unlocks the lore, there's no way around it. If you just want to finish the Rift then you can just play more games each day - but if you want the lore, you're stuck with the Master challenges.
---
I really welcome the changes. I've said elsewhere that I wasn't happy with the current experience, and that it discouraged me from spending on the game (I don't really do cosmetics, for me the Rift is something to tempt me after unlocking the lore), but if the changes are fair then I'd have no issues continuing to support it at full price. I just really need more lore!
---
My entire point is that the original commenter is saying something ridiculous, so I totally agree with you
---
Says truth, DoWn VoTeD. Don't even try, the sub is so survivor sided. Ever wonder why everyone likes sucking otz's dick? Because he doesn't bring up the root issues with this game. Yeah he's fun to watch and I don't fault him for anything, but it's obvious why people love him and hate tru3.
---
Iron Grasp isn‚Äôt a perk I would put there because that makes the killer much stronger. 
---
But perks like uh deer stalker etc. perks that don‚Äôt do much that if it was added in as a 5th perk it wouldn‚Äôt be bad. 
---
But I‚Äôm also very iffy on this idea as well.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see much NOED. Way more Ruin/Pop/sloppy combos, and sloppy is way more annoying imo
---
And it‚Äôs not like survivors don‚Äôt all use the same small handful of perks too
---
Depends on the map. With ruin gone immediately and essentially none of your slow down perks coming into play, some maps have enough pallets to waste and still finish gens before you get a hook.
---
Okay count the countless times I have been on Reddit and seen mostly entitled survivors or survivors. 
---
Oh you can‚Äôt you haven‚Äôt been here long enough, you are only counting a small amount of time out of well let‚Äôs just go with 365 days.
---
ok boomer
---
There is no daily to get a 4k ü§î
---
Yeah I was just thinking about the new time that requires you to get two sacrifices with noed during end-game collapse
---
This is only right answer to questions like these.
---
I think another idea is to add more slots while also making ‚Äòbetter‚Äô perks take more slots similar to the notches and charms in Hollow Knight.
---
My kink
---
Auric cells only. Instead of 500 for a character it‚Äôs 250, not 50% off a chapter
---
Please tell me the killers you play in red ranks that have 0 map pressure since you seem to have every game last only 5 mins.
---
Who tf cares about ranking up, you get kills, or you survive. you will prob pip if you are good. but if you dont, who tf cares? what do you gain for ranking up?
---
I‚Äôm not talking just survivors here, it‚Äôs SWF that needs the nerf. Do you not understand that this is game you can play perfectly and still lose as killer? 
---
I can tell you don‚Äôt play killer as much as you say because you say killers have the power to decide games. Against SWF killers do not decide the game and there‚Äôs many things I can show you to prove this.
---
Oh yes that be awsome
---
From my experience, I seen the opposite.
---
Which is why they're weak or unused perks. Sure it will be salt city at first but after maybe a month it will be clear which perks should and should not be there, or changed to be there. Also killers are ment to be threatening, so this is a small nudge for the most part. Do you really feel that every killer is equally threatening in every match?
---
That still doesn't address the times the game randomly drops you out of a match for no reason
---
Killer: what are you running survivors? 
---
Uh deadhard, adrenaline, bt. 
---
Point is there‚Äôs meta in every fucking game and people will always play what‚Äôs meta.
---
Let me guess Tru3tal3nt is your fav streamer?
---
r/SpeedOfLobsters
---
They also ignore how tru3 plays both sides. He is amazing at both killer and survivor which he plays both every stream
---
You do.
---
Theres a third one!
---
I guess depending on your region, you might have issues with player pools. I'm in NA, so it's generally fine to play all the time. 
---
Honestly I could easily get tome 3 in a week and half, if I played a couple hours after work, and maybe a few more on the weekend. Even with keeping up my social life.
---
We're gonna have till Jan 8th to finish everything.
---
Lol otz is the best
---
Gotta agree with atombomb, this is b8
---
[deleted]
---
You prob guessed right
---
It's the best thing in the world when the survivors don't know how mikey works
---
[removed]
---
If uniquely tossing pallets is a passive perk, then uniquely destroying them would also be considered a passive perk.
---
Blind Spirit Twice in a Single match while the killer is carrying Nea OR Tapp.
---
Yes their is. It‚Äôs a daily and I had to have these sacrifices with the trapper. Unless I read it wrong that‚Äôs what it was.
---
Just finished getting to the epilogue of tome 3 after nerding out on mostly killer all day.
---
Finally got enough serum for my precious spirit set now because of it and tbh the rest of the tomes/rift can suck my ass.
---
Wasn't very fun but hey, free stuff!
---
If every killer was as balanced as hillbilly I think the game would be in a good spot, it‚Äôs unfortunate that there is such a large gap between them
---
I think so. Summs up his personality pretty well then ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Couldn't u just get a 4k and not let them finish the gens with unnerving presence
---
I have noticed that tru3 fans have a really weird hang-up with Otz
---
You only have to be on the gen when it pops. The wording is bad. If the gen is 99‚Äôd when you get to it, it still counts.
---
I swear if he didn't try to have all 4 survs slugged he would finish a lot of his matches faster. There's lots of times he finally hooks a survivor he's downed like 3-4 times onto their first hook.
---
Some people are already done all the challenges, and I know at least a few are done the whole rift.
---
People threw games long before the tomes. 
---
It's not even like balance is thrown off because of bad perks being forced on you (random perk wheel and stream chat builds are not only already a thing, but people copy them), or that people camping is new like AT ALL whatsoever.
---
Oh it certain is but his constant complaining isn‚Äôt making it any better.
---
... You are really giving stronger perks this slot. Think more along the lines of everyones fave perk: monsterous shrine. Or the one where your x distance away you see if someones in the basement. Are they strong if used the right way or in certain situattions? Yes, but then, every perk is strong under the right circumstances. Also them being changed to better fit the role isn't out of the question.
---
BHVR‚Äôs solution for SWF.
---
Wait..what's the rift again?
---
Really seems it. If she‚Äôs not OP then I don‚Äôt get who else could be
---
And his spam...
---
No idea why anybody would want their subscription box being spammed up with 5+ videos a day from the same person.
---
That sounds awful lol.
---
Sure.. welp I called it
---
Rank 20 survivors will cry and reviewbomb until they Nerf everything
---
Yes, yes you've said that already. Is your wall ok?
---
I'm also in NA. 
---
I sincerely think you are exaggerating your ability to grind the tome.
---
You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
---
Idk, I used to sub to Tru3 he is good at the game but he is so whiny and a man child and he criticizes everyone and everything and thinks everything should be his way because he thinks he‚Äôs god tier. The straw that broke the camels back for me was when someone donated to get their build to see how he did with it, survivors ran a train on Tru3 and he bitched and moaned that this kid was so bad and gave him a shit build and that he‚Äôs probably green ranks trash and I litterally left and unsubbed right there. He‚Äôs a trash human being
---
Nice mask!
---
I guy I like to watch now is Fungoose. He does great educational commentary while playing. AND he‚Äôs good and plays both survivor and killer.
---
That‚Äôs basically what original surveillance was before they buffed it
---
Otz is just a good natured fun loving dude how can you not like him
---
Yes. You just can‚Äôt blink through objects tho
---
Can we not go down this rabbit hole? Please?
---
It still looked really good. 
---
Just tell people that is where you keep your little black books of names and the Necronomicon. 
---
Just need an Ashy Slashy for the next one.
---
As the Hillbilly, chainsaw Nancy whilst Jane is on a hook in the basement.
---
Some people suggested that safes are added as a secondary objective that carry rare items and award a bunch of BP if opened.
---
And the killer not realizing they can just looking straight up to avoid the stun.
---
Please, tell me what perfect world you live in where all the spirits and nurses will be using there super fun perks that everyone enjoys and not just meta.
---
You cant limit this shit either, bc perk rarity means nothing in terms of actual power.
---
Naw this one is fine
---
Noed plus sloppy on a huntress?
---
Truuuuuuu
---
Yes, her ultra rare "Torn Bookmark" adds a blink, but prevents blinking outside of line of sight.

It's like iri shards, but you get cosmetics. The amount of work you gotta do though is a lil much to reach high tiers and not worth it atm if you ask me for 10$
---
Twice in a single match. You forgot that part.
---
What a bitch, I hate when I get teammates like that they fuck over the entire team
---
I've never had that happen before xD
---
The scenario mostly goes like this: killer takes you to the hatch, drops you a few feet from it, closes it, picks you back up and hooks you.
---
Cry myself to sleep.
---
Back to ps1 are we
---
Really overrated.
---
I get it but as a survivor if you dont get caught at all you just dont stand any chance, it should have more distance between them. Or else the egc is just a wast of time in situations like this one
---
Anyone who teabags gets got.
---
No, since furtive chase needs the obsession to get unhooked for it to change. You'll want something to change the obsession after the current one is dead, so basically only decisive strike (or the new killer's perk, when he's out)
---
No I'm not. If you just focus on doing it, you can get it done. I haven't started Tome 3 yet, but I'm going start after a work event tonight, I'll show you how far I get by next Friday.
---
but my god the BM potential to tbag an oni AND stomp him. That would feel horrible
---
I like getting the extra points and XP. 
---
Plus it messes with the survivors a bit.
---
Eh thats really changing the fundementals of the game, is it a good idea? Yeah it could work better than the system we have now. But realisticly it wouldn't be implimemted any time soon.
---
I haven't done any of the new tome challenges bc they're grindy garbage, I just play a lot of DBD
---
I'm a console Nurse main when I play killer. I don't play a tonne of killer, but when I do, she's one of two killers I routinely choose to play. She can be very difficult to learn, and even when you do, you're still going to get stomped a lot.
---
My first recommendation is to get decent with other killers first. Understand the basics, understand what survivors do, where they hide, etc. You mentioned that you play other killers already, so depending on your experience, you should be okay. It's just that learning those things on a Nurse makes the game very difficult. When she goes in to the first stage of her fatigue, you see next to nothing, which allows survivors time to hide and get away.
---
Second, be prepared to get BM'ed a lot. I still get BM'ed most games when I play Nurse. People know that it's difficult to play Nurse and that it's unlikely they are going to come across a good one. The people who teabag in other gamee will definitely take the opportunity to teabag you every chance they get when you're playing Nurse.
---
If you do decide to pick her up, you're going to be frustrated a lot when you start out. I'd recommend playing mostly without range or charge time add-ons for a while to train your blink muscle memory, because the precision of your blinks will make or break a game. I find that I have to play her a lot in a short period of time, or I start to lose my effectiveness with her. This might be different for you, but it could take me a few days of playing her to get back to feeling comfortable with her.
---
In short, she can be a very frustrating but rewarding killer if you take the time to learn her. She's definitely not the strongest killer on console by the numbers, but top tier Nurses can still end a game quicker than almost anyone.
---
Good luck if you decide to give her a try!
---
Get madness 2 as fast as possible and then get away. It take a while to get to madness 3 if he isn't directly shocking you. Then just concentrate on doing gens. That's basically it.
---
I have. And it‚Äôs not true.
---
Gg ez
---
idgi... The game is not fun as survivor lol..
---
I have no other perks.
---
I have and that clearly is not true 
---
I let them live so you just got an awhole
---
Nope
---
Nah pretty sure hes cheating
---
There is both a cheat that does this and a bug with sprint burst
---
Gr8 H8 M8 wanna D8?
---
I was on console and I got called a sore loser for leaving because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with this
---
Two dudes, stalking in Lampkin Lane.
---
5 feet apart cuz they‚Äôre not gay.
---
When you‚Äôre not really that great at killer but you still somehow make it to red ranks and you decide to chill and work on completing killer challenges but every match you get put up against the sweatiest and most hardcore survivors
---
Which ones, if any, do you already have?
---
Yeah you can buy just the pig with cells. You just won‚Äôt get tapp or his alternative outfit without the chapter. Pig only has the one outfit in the chapter anyway.
---
It happens. Report him for exploiting either a bug or for cheating
---
Your a sore loser for leaving an unwinnable situation?
---
Wanna join my free gift card giveaway
---
Marry me you motherfucker
---
I don't think he is actually toxic, not in the traditional sense. Just a lot of people are annoyed by him for various reasons and the truth is stretched a bit now.
---
And it wasn't fire.
---
That‚Äôs a yikes
---
Nah, she went to school with the first humans
---
Please stop posting the same shit
---
this is why i think we should be able to message the killer before the game starts
---
No. I‚Äôm not sure I will ever play enough to get there.
---
Yknow, Itzdarva streams and uploads on his YouTube channel (nototzdarva) every day ;)
---
Just the mention of the word survivor or killer doesn‚Äôt show the survivor and killer mains. Killers could be talking about survivors, survivors could mention killers.
---
Most youtubers (tru3 being one of them) avoid repeating thumbnails, meaning each one is unique and this guy just recognized this one.
---
Why? I mean I can kind of understand legion since they‚Äôre annoying to go against even tho I still wouldn‚Äôt dc against that. But pig? What‚Äôs wrong with pig?
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
i have no idea what you are saying
---
I just have what came with the base game so none
---
The colors are amazing...well done!
---
I don't see a problem here, he's just fast as fuck boiiiii
---
Also, he actively will not call out donations right away if he's playing killer, because killer requires far more concentration than survivor.
---
He'll usually apologize and then call out the backlog
---
I queued for 40 minutes for a game as survivor. Finally gave up and went to a different game
---
You can dislike streamers. It‚Äôs just lame that you feel the need to be rude to feel validated. They‚Äôre people too and no one likes feeling attacked
---
Grumbles in console
---
why do you think the term ‚Äúreddit killer‚Äù exists?
---
Was a joke. Where I replied to you telling you to take your own advice however wasnt. This is a survivor sided sub period.
---
Tbh the dlc I‚Äôve put the most time in is jeff/legion, but mostly cuz I just like his character. Ash is also pretty dope.
---
It‚Äôs worse than that, I had a game with three iridescent emblems and it didn‚Äôt count any of them.
---
If the killer fixates on you and just eats a steady diet of pallets, you can power through gens and throw them carelessly, yeah. A top killer like Fungoose will break off after getting 1-2 pallets out of you depending on what's nearby, balance his pressure &amp; his pallet breaks, and if you give them away easily you're fucked.
---
Kiss your husband right now.
---
Well he plays the game every single day for a living, how would you feel playing against god survivors every time you play killer almost every single game?
---
Everyone here is so quick to jump on True for complaining a lot but doesn‚Äôt realize he literally puts up with this shit every single day. Have you not seen the games he plays?
---
Red rank gameplay is extremely unfun for killers against teams who know how to do gens extremely well and also knowing how to do tiles optimally. If you make one mistake like breaking a pallet or generator you don‚Äôt need to, you could lose the game.
---
The reason he complains is because he wants the devs to do a better job than they already are. Gen speed in red ranks is stupid and some games lately have proven that you don‚Äôt even need to loop the killer well, just hold m1 on gens and you win the game.
---
I don‚Äôt see much fun in playing killer against survivors that just do generators extremely fast to just escape and keep doing it multiple trials. I can‚Äôt imagine how true feels because he deals with it every single day.
---
And no, I‚Äôm not a true fanboy, I do disagree with his opinion sometimes but the general point stands in the game being extremely survivor sided in very high level play.
---
I've been running into a lot of the same survivors lately, been kind of nice.
---
Happened to me too
---
Well that is terrifying...
---
Thanks got it off amazon
---
The devs are aware and are working on a fix.
---
Ruin is a risky perk, being a Hex there is a possibility of it going out before the first minute of game and skilled survivors just ignore it. Anyways, perks like BBQ and Nurse¬¥s Calling are really strong too
---
Joke's on them, because I like my knights black.
---
Thanks I thought others were going to hate it I don‚Äôt know why though
---
My strategy is faking to run around the short side of the loop, then instantly come back to break the pallet.
---
That results in either of this results:  
---
\- best, the Survivor panics and jumps over the pallet directly in your arms, even grabable if hes injured  
---
\- good, the Survivor panics and flees, you dont get blinded whilst breaking  
---
\- okayish, the Survivor panics, but returns once you start breaking, blinding you. But now hes closer then he would have been without the strategy  
---
\- worst, the Survivor sees its a fake, comes back too, and still blinds you, nothing changed
---
Not trying to be a smartass, just sharing this tactic as it got me a lot of free hits, and as mentions, sometimes even grabs
---
Thanks
---
Corrupt is more reliable than Ruin. 
---
Blocks gens where survivors spawn and basically tells you where to go first.
---
I really want to learn him just so that way I can just go apeshit when I have a bad string of games.
---
Some of them take infinite games to complete because they're luck-based
---
rework monstrous shrine
---
I watch TrU3Ta1ent's stream every day. But No0b3's content is also very good.
---
You do realize these difficult challenges are often unfun and ruin normal gameplay right?
---
Should have seen a doctor game from yesterday. The minute someone screamed, they DC'd. Stupid 1,000hr players.
---
For the NOED one I used Plague with her aura reading add on.
---
3 people were left with 1 gen to go and I knew roughly how long it would take to be done. All were broken so constantly revealing their auras and I could see someone working on it.
---
I slugged one person, and was chasing another, and downed them right as the gen was done. Because of the auras, I was able to down the last one really fast, then go open the gate myself before hooking all 3.
---
It wasn't particularly fun for anyone, but it only took me one shot and it wasn't difficult.
---
I'm sorry but is no one gonna say anything about the Wii remotes?
---
Dude even called someone stupid in his own stream for asking if there was such thing as wasting pallet thinking it was a reference to him throwing a pallet to early I think he should take a break I know it's his job but the dude is just to narcissistic to even ask himself if he is being attacked or just being asked something out of seeking knowledge
---
Ive felt some are weak, and to have some perks see the light of day without wasting a slot. I dont intend them to be a way to replace fixing the killer but rather another level of play that helps killers if used. Also the idea was based off monstrous shrine and the challanges so. And before you go to survivors and those challanges, one problem at a time.
---
Bro you totally just destroyed his entire argument. Congratulations
---
If true thinks the game is survivor sided, he's an idiot. I watch him and I can't deny he's an A+ Tier killer, but my god he's more toxic then Ochido ever was with his awful opinions.
---
Welp I'm too lazy to link the daily posts about moris that pop up every day
---
Still, you sound exactly like those kind of people because**you are** those kind of people. That's it, accept that and move on
---
When I was new, the only killer I thought was too strong was doctor lol ‚Äúyou mean I have to hit these skill checks all over the scr.... WTF HE TELEPORTED TO ME‚Äù. Cue me running from his psycho mirage right into his crazy arms. Damn how times change. 
---
Hag jump scares also made me drop my controller and caused me to need a replacement (because PDP makes shit controllers)
---
I bought the game at launch played for a month never did my daily‚Äôs. Then bought r6 and played that for years and bought gta v. Then just got back into dbd about a year ago and haven‚Äôt done my daily‚Äôs until about a week ago. Soo I‚Äôm that person.
---
"You can't find a mori in a chest" is a bullshit argument because a key isn't a secret offering that skips 66% of your objective, it's an item that can save you in a bad scenario if you still did alright despite having a massive target on your back
---
Thanks so much! I think after I get my main killers up to high levels I'm going to switch to nurse and see if I can get a hang of her.
---
I think they should  give DCers a penalty like waiting 10 minutes before entering another match and the next match they will receive 75% less BP
---
Did they fix his skin yet?
---
Guys we found his alt account
---
Only in your nightmares
---
DBD Subreddit is filled with survivor mains.
---
Why do you think you see so many videos of survivors DS‚Äôing the killer at the exit gates and putting a ‚Äúkarma‚Äù title?
---
Why do you think any relevant discussion is drowned in a sea of reposted, boring and unrelated memes? 
---
Why do you think any and all flaws with the game are quickly downvoted and if a person talks about killer being balanced it gets shafted?
---
Yeah this subreddit is something else
---
Yes sir
---
I literally thought of that when reading the title, lol
---
You get that done in 2 games. Pick wraith with purple shadow dance and windstorm and pop goes the weasel. Rest is up 2 you. You can kick anything midchase while invis without losing any distance
---
But I don't want the dev's to listen to our feedback, I want to be outraged!
---
‚ÄúWhy. Hello there Ghosty, that‚Äôs one big knife you got there. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)‚Äù *Jane mains be like.*
---
Have you been waiting on this exact day? Lol. Thank you!
---
Eating during struggle phase ruined my sandwich, my spacebar and my existence.

Thank you! I'm going to give it some time and level up the 3 I'm trying rn. I think it's worth a try once I've got more experience :)

I feel called out.

# DELET THIS

r/okbuddydaylight
---
well it was grandparent breakfast day
---
Bruh, no mither, self care, pharmacy.  Nuff said
---
Alright, thanks. I thought getting them all would actually increase the likelihood of the needed ones popping eventually
---
I've seen this before it's a speed hack
---
Oh damn, didnt expect that spice from this comment section
---
After the first one I get wise to it and do a lot of that. It's also not the smartest play to just... hang around. You can still get hit while the killer is blind.
---
I watch fungoose too but it's clear that he is way over his skill league he loops as survivor like a rank 1 but he is paired with purple rank killers.
---
Even tho Tru3 can be toxic dude is consistent I learned a lot watching him as killer and survivor and he gets paired with R1 killers
---
It sucks so much. Demo is supposed to freak people out and make them go insane, MB is just barely doing it‚Äôs job, and Cruel limits is so situational it almost never works
---
I wonder what type of survivor annoys you, considering you must have the patience of a fucking saint to mod this subreddit that could double as a salt mine lmao.
---
Exploiting a bug, WHAT, was he supposed to run into killer because a lucky bug happened to him instead of using it to have fun for once. Is that what you would do? I doubt. Killer could have gone after other survivors and leave that one be, that's what I would have done, but I dont blame them for leaving, it's their right to quit the game. I had this bug once as survivor but couldn't have much fun with it, it activated late in egc. Its not cheating bc was it cheating it would have toggled from the very start, but in the clip its the middle of the match or so. Its but a bug. Game is not perfect. Why blame players for something.
---
Only David or Jake or both.
---
Yep
---
Except I don't complain about Mori. So no, I'm not. You seem like one of those people that can't accept they aren't correct about something.
---
Oh man I can‚Äôt wait to see a David main rift. Imagine having to use No Mither and pick yourself up in a match! Just to sweeten the pot it‚Äôll be a rift with the killer being the nurse. 
---
But i do appreciate all the love trapper is getting. Loved him in the beginning and still do.
---
Ha well if they just hide and do nothing or are a little to cocky with teabagging and pointing at me at pallets to me that just says bring it on lol
---
This sub is also filled with Killer mains. If a meme mocks one side then that side gets defensive in the comments. It‚Äôs pretty equal. Some people from both sides of the spectrum don‚Äôt like TrU3Ta1ent for different reasons rather then just painting ‚Äúsurvivor mains‚Äù with a wide brush.
---
My trap game has gone up 1000% now. I‚Äôm placing them in much meaner positions than gens/loops and getting people, I would never have gotten this trapper practice otherwise.
---
Myers is always peak chad, how dare you
---
A brief explanation of the killer's power: After a gen is completed the trap on your head activates and you have to search for Jigsaw boxes around the map and interact with them to get rid of the trap. Those boxes are usually highlighted for you. If u can't make it in time or want to escape with a active trap on your head then... well you witnessed it already for yourself.
---
Play with friends that can explain each killer. In game like "ghost face has no terror radius when he has his power" look at him so he cant stalk you.
---
What's worse is it seems to not count some of them, much like the emblem challenge. I got two in a match and it only gave me one (yes they were both safe unhooks).
---
Well to clean the ps4 is the best option here.
---
Like moths to a flame
---
I just cleaned it. Like I said THIS IS THE ONLY GAME
---
But to elaborate, that was the Pig, her ability she used was the reverse beartrap, when a gen pops the timer on it activates and you must go to the jigsaw boxes scattered around the map and interact with them. From there you'll be met with skillchecks where you have to hope by the end of it that box holds the key to take the beartrap off, if not you have to hit all of them until you find a key, if you fail the trap will countdown to 0 and ultimately kill you, you also can't leave through the gates if you have one on your head or it instantly kills you. Her second ability is ambush, she can crouch and lose her terror radius entirely, she can either break it by standing again or by charging up a melee attack that gives her a dash/charge attack that damages you. You won't see many Pigs as she was heavily nerfed out of every killer.
---
Ending the match gave me 1 Iridescent toward my challenge **#feelsbadman**
---
play a game normally but dc before death hook or an escape. if you choose to dc this is the most friendly to the killers and survivors in your match

Fcking hilarious

Nea aka. The Entity or else the killer will suffer
---
I don't have iron will yet can't play him PepeHands
---
I had a super irritating SWF as Trapper. All flashlights except for dwight with a medkit. I had the injure if disarm addon and Dwight still still followed me and disarmed every trap. Once the first injure happened, he just kept following me, cuz Iron Will. Literally never got a trap off. Still managed to hook and kill the other 3, but that Dwight was sneaky AF. Finally found him and downed him. Took him to the hatch, dropped him and then closed the hatch. Just kinda stood there for a sec, looking at him. Thought about hooking him, decided his persistence and willingness to be his potato team's MVP deserved better than that.
---
 Then I picked him and walked over to gate. Put him down, placed one more trap and then picked him and let him wiggle off. He disarms the trap and then opens the gate, while I loomed over him. I let him go following him all the way to the exit, just to make him sweat that last little bit.
---

FUCK YOU KILLERS IN WIFI. YELLOW BAR GOOFS

Strongly agree, If you point at me and teabag me at a pallet you're throwing down a gauntlet and I'll pick it up every single time.

overall yes but nothing tops jumpscare daddy myers

back for more is basically old surveillance. and possessed awareness would be  overshadowed by discordance.

Any rival characters if I‚Äôm playing their killer. And noobies that throw every pallet on site and can‚Äôt loop

I know I know. Ima dumbbass
---
I was thinking that but also Freddy and or Ghostface because they are good killers
---
500 points shy of a perfect game.
---
Lord forgive me for what I‚Äôve become
---
My friend and I are on the phone right now and he's having this EXACT problem. The fuck is up with that???
---
Amazing work
---
No. He‚Äôs been his normal self lately. 
---
That‚Äôs why I said to watch him. People on this sub have a warped view about him and I‚Äôm not sure where it comes from.
---
Only when survivors give up after 2 DC's. I feel so sorry for them.

Okay either that mask is way too big or that person is way too small.
---
My PS4 fan is so loud playing this game it sounds like it‚Äôs gonna explode and then it goes quiet and then loud again, I don‚Äôt know how to stop it.
---
This is exactly the comment I came to make üëÄ
---
That‚Äôs a god tier troll right here, folks
---
Peppa! What are you doing in my Thanksgiving?
---
I like how no one cares to dispute the point but downvoted just the same
---
I‚Äôve always been the totem hunter in my group, so when inner strength came out, it was just a bonus.
---
Ah, a man of culture I see
---
??? Weird build. Especially Franklin‚Äôs. What killer?
---
I wanna be a cowboy, baby!
---
Both are very sneaky, I like ghostface more personally though.
---
Woman lol
---
Can‚Äôt you just sprint right before exhaustion wears off and then unsprint for a second and get a speed boost when you need it? Could this have been that?
---
Pop goes the weasel. Monitor and abuse. BBQ. Whispers.
---
If you have cells just buy Ghostface with cells since it's half the price (250 cells)
---
Im looking for solution everywhere and all I find is guys with the same problem. There has to be a way to make this stop!
---
I hate to just randomly promote people, but watch OhTofu. I've seen him 4k playing as wraith, with no slowdown perks. It's insane
---
It‚Äôs only like 3 bucks I think on the Microsoft store (I‚Äôm on Xbox)
---
Well Sweaty Survivors can be a thing to. If they all use meta perks, optimize chase, and Gen rush, that‚Äôs considered sweaty. Same with using optimum tactics as killer.
---
This is one of the few times in this community that a Negative Term is Universal between Survs and Killers
---
It's kinda both. It's not that great of a perk but it also has some design flaws that make it not fun to play vs.
---
Afterward the killer triggered end game, which actually didn't end the game, and eventually the killer just D/C'ed since there was nothing else to do.
---
If I miss a head on ima swear enough to fill that jar three time over
---
Thank god it‚Äôs getting changed, challenges are getting boring, like 6 grabs. Just takes too long same with 25 unhooks.

Downside is unbreakable has a higher chance of working

It's "c'est la vie" btw

i do not have any ideas but make sure it is what you really want as this is as you know perminit. and as a warning once you get 1 tattoo you will prob want to get even more lol. ik sooner or later I will be getting another tattoo

also I think that The Plauge wouldn't kill jesus
---
Same dude, I was at 7000 in hunter
---
ooo nice custom pack, where did ya find it?
---
Two stalkers, one victim.
---
Best idea I can give you is for you to be 100% sure well in advance of your appointment and not just pick it on the day on a whim. Otherwise, your idea is pretty neat.
---
I'm finished as well. good job
---
A mighty perk for sure.

Texas man finally finds friend

Congratulations, you've beaten the Blendettes. You are invisible.

If your killer is The Plague you are untouchable and cannot be affected by her
---
Yo forgot the haddonfield offering
---
He shouldn‚Äôt feel like he needs to apologize it‚Äôs a fucking green mori I have yet hear a survivor apology for using a key so he shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for it
---
Really?! Do you have the source?
---
For Pig - STBFL, BBQ, Pop, Haunted Grounds

For Frederick - BBQ, Pop, enduring, spirit fury

Sometimes I‚Äôll take Ruin off of my Trapper and Huntress in favor of Corrupt Intervention

Now this is some fucking good Thanksgiving turkey

Cool video and I love behind the scenes but I wish they gave us a snippet of Yui's voice!
---
Thank you :) You too

*the entity
---
No problem üôè I never expected this vid to do so well lol üòÇ
---
He can run at full running speed with no radius and no stain, it‚Äôs not contest.
---
Not related to the topic, but thanks for being such a cool mod. Always interacting in these new posts and making insightful comments. Never see mods do that on other subreddits.
---
The only real add-ons that make a huge difference are the coxcombed and "the ghost" when combined, since you can get easy gen grabs. While many of the other add-ons aren't terrible, they aren't really enough to make him a good killer.
---
Against even decent survivors, gens should be 'rushed'. That's their objective.
---
I'm not saying that only the top 25 killers can play without slowdown perks, but I'm also not saying that killer is easy with ruin. I'm just saying that many people play without ruin, because they can end chases quickly with M1 killers and don't need it.
---
BBQ, Whispers, Shadowborn. Depends on the killer for the 4th perk I use. 
---
I never use Ruin useless all the other perks I use are complete trash after prestiging a killer.
---
I‚Äôd take anything, but sadly he doesn‚Äôt alter much in the remake film.
---
I am salivating at this news. I grinded over 30 matches just for the damn Iridescent Age one and the ones past it look even worse
---
Well I‚Äôm doing long binges of the game now and I‚Äôm catching well up so I‚Äôm gonna press X to doubt on that one, plus I have a lot of spare time to play multiple games.
---
Yep, have you checked their twitter? They said they're changing all the challenges because people said they were too hard and some were bugged. Like the Iridescent Emblem one and some of the killer ones.
---
Nope not at all insta blonds were given to the weak role killers have insta downs because they are the power role
---
thank you:) and I do it because I love this game and I do love this sub I would comment all the time even before I was asked to be a mod :)
---
No I am perfectly aware that it's not a magic combo that wins you every chase. I am also aware that it's not that fun to go against and I don't consider it healthy for the game.
---
Plus you will run into situations where you can't drop the pallet early, the killer will just be too close for you to do it, you'll get hit either way.
---
I also don't like how it interacts with billy's chainsaw.
---
A good attempt to deflect but no, fuck them for giving themselves unfair advantages through out-of-game means

Get your bbq stack
---
I did it as Plague kekw
---
Not your fault they‚Äôre afk.
---
I agree
---
You watch tru3ta1ent for survivor tips, no wonder you last 5 seconds. Watch some decent survivor mains. Learn how to loop simple.
---
Same. I bought Ghostface the other day. Son of a...
---
Talk to someone. Try other things
---
I was getting my ass handed to me by a scratched mirror myers. He ended up trapping me in a place, so I dropped my toolbox and crouched and he let not only me out, but the rest of my team.
---
Don't underestimate the item offering. I think it works a good 75% of the time I try it.
---
stab me daddy
---
I just use my bloodpoint build on Legion: BBQ, Thrill of the Hunt, Distressing, and Beast of Prey. I plan on using this build on every killer I like playing.
---
Knock em down. Other survivors won't know they're afk and will waste gen time on reviving them.
---
This is the best news I've heard all day.
---
How often do you play killer? Your perspective on this seems off
---
You don't need to use all three though. If I'm on badham and the survivors are throwing pallets early, I get free hits as almost every pallet is super unsafe. Devs' new design seems to be a lot of pallets but all of them unsafe (badham, stranger things).
---
So you either throw it early and get hit, or get a stun and get exposed.
---
&gt;isnt super overpowered
---
I literally said that I don't think it's a magic combo that wins every chase, I said it's not fun to go against and isn't too healthy for the game.
---
Yes
---
*insert Thanos impossible meme*
---
Aura reading that most people know how to counter and Ruin that can be countered by simply hitting skillchecks, tapping the gen or deleti g the entire perk by breaking the totem that survivors can still spawn next to, truly powerful perks both
---
They could just change the sweater color. I mean..
---
too funny!
---
Good job! I just finished mine up today as well üòä
---
Reminds me of Piper from Fallout 4. Great idea!
---
Stop posting this.
---
He also has 109 Shards.
---
We aren¬¥t even worthy to look upon this majestic numbers
---
It's gonna be ok take deep breaths
---
Just bandwagoning I guess. Too bad no one is going to see it since reddit blocks posts with less than -5 karma.
---
If you would've made that second shot I would've been so mad for that Feng.
---
Good job though!
---
note this was not a SWF, this was just a match of randos that I convinced to join the pizza dwight cult.
---
I want to do it to prove to myself that i can do it.
---
No fuckin life
---
I personally really enjoy legion. He's pretty mobile and can be very fun once you get the hang of em. üòä the plague is pretty nice too imo
---
All of those are fun options. Demo and Legion are very, very weak tho so if you care about doing well, pass on them
---
What kind of play style do you enjoy?
---
They‚Äôre changing them, we‚Äôll know more tomorrow.
---
My idea is to reevaluate whether or not you truly want a tattoo based on a game you probably won‚Äôt be playing in 5+ years.
---
The chin is wrong
---
I‚Äôve done that
---
I usually give them a moment by ignoring them and finding someone else (it's not like they're helping their team anyways). If they get crows, down and hook them, cause that shit is annoying.
---
 This is a lie, you‚Äôre saying she got minimum 5k for 4-1 hooks in sacrifice points. That‚Äôs called bullshit. Stop lying about face camping
---
very true ive been running tombstone pieces for the obsession challenge its so much easier than the mori then i let everyone leave after i kill obsession
---
Amanda : \*Gives you a Turkey and calls you epic\*

If you knew the difference you would have typed the correct one. Nice try.
---
People used to use it to let old white men know that their aged views are worthless, now its just a replacement for "lalala cant hear you"
---
I can't wait for the stream tbh. When I 1st started playing dbd last year, he's the 1st streamer I watched to learn about the game, and got hooked immediately. His voice is so calming.
---
Had a killer DC the other night once they realized we cleansed all the totems and NOED didn't activate.
---
I used to run it but I realized I could use the 4th perk to end the game before the gens are done
---
Oh, as in baby boomer
---
Sadly, I only have 1/10th of Bruce's chin.
---
I‚Äôd say get demo. He‚Äôs mad underrated if you can get good with him plus, not many are great with him so if you work you can be one of the best

I‚Äôm on PS4 and Ghostface is on sale for $2.50. It‚Äôs through the in game store. Regular price on the PS store. Thinking about picking him and Mikey up for $5.00 total.
---
*Coughs in adrenaline and decisive*
---
Yea, I was like wtf. But he does address the fact that bhvr decided to shut one eye on the map nonsense that caused BL to be OP
---
&gt;Aura reading that most people know how to counter
---
They know, yeah. Most games I don't see people doing it though. They either don't care or sit on gens, so I get value out of it. The perk would be just as meta even if it didn't have the point bonus. It's been a while since I saw someone get into a locker for example, usually they just stay on the gen.
---
&gt;Ruin that can be countered by simply hitting skillchecks
---
That's 100% true, yeah. Good thing that most players suck at those and ruin gets a lot of value in most games. I see my teammates/survivors I go against just running around looking for ruin like every 2nd game. It wouldn't be this popular of a perk if it wasn't that good.
---
&gt;tapping the gen
---
If they are legit tapping through the gen then ruin did its job, gen tapping takes way longer than normal repair.
---
&gt;deleting the entire perk by breaking the totem that survivors can still spawn next to
---
Welcome to Dead by daylight and RNG, see also Trapper in general, Pig and almost every single map tile spawn. Sometimes you lose ruin instantly, sometimes it's up for 5 minutes or more. A lot of perks share the RNG problem on both sides.
---
"but hag tps to traps when i unhook a surv, that is face camping" survivors that dont know crouching doesnt trigger her traps and that flashlights destroy them
---
You and me both friend.
---
I think op would too, also demo isnt weak but hes kinda hard to play
---
Stephen King would totally allow this too lol
---
Then with the power of *OBLIGATORY NORD VPN MEME,* you won't have to worry!
---
25 saves for 25-30k BP, takes up about 8-14 games. Takes hours.  Yet hook obsession twice is also 30k, takes literally 15 minutes. 25 saves should be 50-100k.
---
I WANT NEW COSMETICS FOR MY MEG!!!!
---
Same. I'll be internally screaming too.
---
Oh, that's great! I was worried I'd have to try and find a swf group to farm with
---
DS doesn't work if you die right under a hook- the killer has enough time to hammer the action key and lock in the "hooking" animation- so not guaranteed to save you from a farming unhook.
---
Monitor, Infectious Fright, Discordance, Haunted Grounds. You can end games in a couple minutes if you play well
---
Yes, he's easy af.
---
I think every challenge thing should give you a million total bp and the master challenges should give you 7 of those blue things and the other challenges should give you 5.
---
lol
---
factual
---
Awesome
---
Honestly
---
That moment when the entity claims the killer. 
---
‚ÄúGet fucked, you‚Äôre here forever now‚Äù
---
you can technically be done instantly if you just buy all the tiers
---
I feel that. I've never played a swf before. I'm on a diffrent platform, just wanna say the dbd discord is a good option. Theres a chat for finding swf in console
---
Oh nice, lucky! Yeah all the DLCs only went down by like 75 cents on Steam. Haven't played Ghostface, but Michael is an absolute party. Definitely worth it 100%. A must-have imo!
---
As both a killer and survivor main, fuck farming. It‚Äôs boring as shit
---
Nea with pink hair/green hair is begging for my mori. Also, if I see you're the strongest. I rarely use mori tho
---
When you begin, main her non-stop until it clicks - and then main her until it's pure instinct. Mixing in "normal" killers will just mess you up.
---
Watermark intensifies.
---
I got stuck at 2 and 3 and couldn't get up to rank one until i stopped using spine chill as a perk and more as a learning tool when the cat went off i would notice sounds and small changes that would tell me to hide or get out of the area completely. Once i picked up on the different cues i had an easier time navigating the maps. But another player advised me to start small goals first. Like quick and quiet helps against certain tier killers that are heavily played. Or iron will helps big time when injured i underestimated that perk big time. Hope this helps.üòä
---
For real, trapper is actually really interesting to play. Ive begun to divide the map up and understand better trap placement in walkways
---
Dude. Stop. It‚Äôs a game. We like to have fun and unwind, but you‚Äôre using this game as escapism. That‚Äôs not healthy at all.
---
I'm a gonna get what I get and f the rest.
---
I mean challenges aren‚Äôt worth it for BP, only for fragments but we get fuck all. Like 3 saves for a daily is 35k, 25 is 30k+ 5 fragments which is 4,000 exp worth of fragments, that‚Äôs like 1 hour of playing.

But you forgot to mention the no. If only no mither had a use but it's honestly like a discount version of unbreakable that you unlock on other characters because you wanted dead hard
---
I mean lag but honestly if you got quick and quiet why you slow getting into the locker?
---
Well said :)
---
We love our pallet countering queen üëèüëè
---
And thank you! Shes always been my fave killer it's about time I did something for her.
---
Thank you! I'll make sure everyone else is out of the way so I can focus on her. Having ruin from hag will definitely help lol
---
Honestly legion is considered bad but he slows the game down a lot having the constantly heal
---
Thank you stranger :)
---
Obviously not but sure, if you say so.
---
extra sausage pizza
---
What kind of glitch is that. That‚Äôs scary
---
Sure wish I had your luck
---
Edit: this sub sees nothing wrong with camping killers with bad connection (console only feels)
---
Welcome to DBD: the land of inconsistent wording.
---
KOBE
---
Maybe get the bloodpoints that the killer is losing. 
---
 
---
The problem is that a killer can camp a hooked survivor without being right next to them. So at what point do you no longer get points? If they are 10 meters away? 15? 20? Anytime the killer is looking at you?
---
Yeah... No matter how annoying it is when 200 people mention how long queue times are, they sure do be right.
---
üò∞
---
I've noticed issues when completing daily challenge objectives that overlapped archive objectives. For example when doing two  "complete x generators" challenges at the same time, only the daily challenge was credited and not the archive.
---
&gt; ***It wasn't particularly fun for anyone***
---
With this in mind, you can see why some people would prefer we don't force one chunk of the community to torment the rest by forced participation in unfun matches just to unlock lore.
---
Killer times are way faster than survivor queues for me
---
On PS4 crouch is L1 (top button) above the stalk button, it's a hold to crouch so when you let go, he stands up again. Also, never stay still and stalk, always ALWAYS lean and stalk, he stalks twice as fast and it gives the survivors less time to react and you're harder to detect. He's an ambush killer after all, the stalk daddy is Myers who doesn't care if he's seen. But keep ghostface hidden, he doesn't like being seen
---
I spy a thicc Jane
---
What if there was a perk that would give you blood points at 10/15/20 meters?
---
I literally just commented on that bottom question. Whoa.
---
The nerf is tiny and people are over reacting it‚Äôs still a powerful exhaustion perk but now it can‚Äôt let people abuse it for infinite‚Äôs
---
I'm not shaming anyone and I'm not making rules homie, I'm saying that some people can recognize when shit isn't fun to play against. If you do certain things you also run the risk of people just straight up deciding not to play against you. You want to run Pink Mori Ruin Beads Spirit? That's cool, I'm killing myself on first hook. I play video games for fun and that ain't it chief. If you want to spend 6 minutes in queue to get a 2 minute long game that's on you.
---
Literally unplayable
---
It takes a fuckton of BP to get there.
---
Doesn't matter too much when I have DS and head on
---
Yeah slightly and then also adding a buff survivor seem to like to leave that part out while bitching and moaning
---
Scratched mirror mikey on lery's/the game is hands-down the most fun I've had in this game. I understand different strokes for different folks though. I'm a borderline Plague main and have done well with her up to red ranks, but most people don't like her.
---
Something like an exploration mode
---
It's a good idea. Right now the tutorials are severely lacking
---
You mean Unbreakable's single use? Ah yes, large counter.
---
They definitely got to the locker before your head-on activated.
---
You have literally the worst arguments i've ever heard
---
This is like the next level disrespect
---
Premonition in a nutshell
---
She literally stood there
---
Moisturize me!
---
Damn. I‚Äôm almost down with iridescent challenge.
---
Then toxic killers would just walk 21 meters away and camp you. And the perk would need an activation time. Like 10 seconds before it activates. Easily still enough time for a killer to get into the radius, attack a rescuer, and then get back out. And tbh, I can't imagine anyone wasting a perk slot in the off chance someone facecamps them.
---
It's not a proposal, it's more like "what's the point?" it's rhetoric
---
I approve of this, dev's please add
---
As someone who hovers around the 6~ range but I am not an everyday player so...?. i noticed you haven't talked about reading killer perks and helping your teammates. As a solo survivor I pay attention to obsession, if it is in play, quite a bit to find out when someone is in a chase. Paying attention to downs and where the killer is to see what you should be doing (given but I mean by the bottom left menu). At high ranks you can assume the rest of your team is swf so even in a heated moment sometimes your team is counting on you to do the gens more than helping with hooks and slugs. Figuring out if the killer is running nurses calling and such is pretty important as most killers usualy only run 2&gt; perks at most that are not focused on the chase and such and can help you stealth them. It seems like small beans in the grand scheme of it all to figure out what they are running, however: at higher ranks I have found most legions dont even run discordance because most survivors are conditioned to assume they are running it.
---
Hell, even the useful non-meta perks are so situational that they have the chance to not help you the entire trial sometimes.
---
Im thinking of Flip-Flop and Iron Maiden here, honestly good perks, but they only trigger once in 2-3 trials
---
Those 10.8 seconds so op
---
A very annoying and demanding family. And I work full time while going to school full time. You're welcome to come here and do all of that while I play games in your place! Reddit is my only regular escape because it looks like I'm working on school when I'm just taking a minute to fuck off.
---
I use a toolboxe with the sabo add ons for the trappers and only billys the deception
---
Yeah good point. At least we can hope our teammates get gens done so it isnt in vain
---
That point idea for facecamping is a good idea
---
Bbq intensifies
---
Just takes time. Once you‚Äôre there, BP is literally nothing anymore. 
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pissed by these challenge rewards. Super low fragment rewards. The BP I don‚Äôt care about, but it‚Äôs far to low of a reward.
---
Also medium vaults and fast vault are different by quite bit I recommend practicing/ watching videos
---
but shit it was \~\~99 cents\~\~ 1000 points
---
Been my main for awhile now! Just saving up to give her Yui's perks.
---
She's now my top 1 choice i guess
---
2 Options:
---
1. Go easy and let everyone get some points
---
2. Finish the game quickly so everyone can move on
---
He said "plag" as in Plague, vommy mommy, puke lady
---
Still didnt choose if anybody was wondering
---
You do realize that's the meaning of a CHALLENGE ?
---
RBTs slow the game down a lot but Pig has trouble balancing chases and map pressure because she has no mobility tools, traps, or ranged weapons. Unless she's downing you really quickly or catching you in generator triagles I'm not sure what the issue would be.
---
Every day we stray further from god
---
Meanwhile there are people who are already done with the rift challenges like myself. I wonder if bhvr will reward us for getting the "harder" challenges done without them having to be nerfed. Lol not a chance in hell.
---
Well, who wants to spend their time with normal people anyway?
---
Myers is my absolute favorite, right beside Ghost Face. Stalky Boys represent.
---
I agree, I want a claudette on the hook.
---
You can get 6 grabs in 6 games or less with just a little sweat. Also 25 hooks should be like 6 games max. You should be getting 3+ hooks even in losing games...
---
Unless this is console killer problems.
---
im just saying, i highly doubt ANY of the legion changes are making it to public, i highly doubt they are letting OG legion to barge back in and stick its dick in everyones mouth again
---
Nope, console killer isn‚Äôt that bad
---
They aren't real challenges though. They are unfun grind/luckfests.
---
It's not skill intensive to heal 25 survivors, or hook 4 survivors in the basement.
---
Getting a 4K, or escaping with the entire team is an actual competitive challenge that doesn't fuck up the entire match.
---
Sucks for the survs, but you didn't make him AFK. Kill.
---
It‚Äôs pretty awesome though. Trapper‚Äôs power is literally 3 sentences long. Yet there‚Äôs a lot of strategy, tactics and placement involved in the traps.
---
I told myself on Tuesday, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get Tome II done with before Tome III‚Äù...I‚Äôm still working on the second Tome...
---
Purple, haven't played anywhere near as much killer as usual recently  due to the last two loads of challenges demanding a billion survivor matches.
---
I kept 3 alive so even if one DCed it wouldn't be an issue.
---
 I downed someone basically as the gen went off, so even if adrenaline procced it wouldn't have been an issue. They also burnt nearly every pallet on the map while I waited for 3 gens to get done, so there wasn't a long chase to be had (they sent us to the game for some reason too.)
---
At the very least Adren wouldn't have healed them through sickness.
---
I thought this was just a joke, probably by an otz fan honestly (I'm a big fan of otz and took this as an absurdist troll post), but the comments seem to say otherwise. Hmm.
---
I don't even play as survivor but I'd still get that cosmetic
---
Toxic and incoherent, just like tru3talent
---
I‚Äôm not talking about the legion changes, I‚Äôm talking about the insane combo that Nemesis has with them. Every legion after the 3rd is gonna be running enduring + nemesis.
---
Y
---
My eyes are deceiving me haha

Ok boomer

---
Dude, bloodpoints are impossible to get, why you gotta run it in
---
It's my phone wallpaper now. Goddamn well done.
---
Hag for ruin. She isn‚Äôt the most fun killer to play, but that perk is a necessity right now imo. Or maybe clown for Pop.
---
May as well send it and get the rest of the classic slasher gang, ghost face and Freddy

Pig and Ghostface

oh def not op but it would be nice if it was every hook

it would have been nice to get a auric cell discount

You could totally use it on plague solely to confuse the shit out of them.

 NanI?!
---
hablas 2 idiomas diferentes?
---
A fix is in the works.
---
Yea it sucks but so does survivors spamming noise indicators to get you to come watch the tea-party before they leave. Why shouldn't the killer be compensated for dealing with b.s. while the survivor should?
---
Your asking for free bp for the other side being toxic, it should go both ways.
---
If you time it perfect the killer has nothing they can do. It blinds them the instance they are out of the pick up animation. When they go from knees to shoulder you start the blind.
---
I want to know what happened
---
Spoken like a true doctor player. You beautiful sadistic bastard.

&gt; Blind The Spirit twice in a single match while ~~the killer~~ The Wraith is carrying Nea OR Tapp.

Doesn‚Äôt sprit come with Adam? And Plague comes with Jane?

Exactly, I hate the ones where its like: search 3 chests using plunders instinct *must be done in a single trial*. By time you got 2 chests searched the others have already been looked through.
---
I always cleanse for free blood points
---
43
---
Hell yeah, gonna get 18k instead of the usual iri head 9k points at the end.
---
Yup! Spinechill and self heal are my two most always have perks!
---
Thx, I'll keep an eye out for it
---
Hahaha... well object is only exceptionally useful vs trapper nowadays.
---
Best way to counter object is to slug, or keep the object on hook so their information is less accurate.
---
Flashlights are an easy counter just check around before picking up someone or look at a fucking wall.
---
DS is a easy counter simply slug if you think they might have it.
---
Freddy

I finished the challenge today and I had the same SWF two games in a row, let‚Äôs say we had a party in the basement üòô
---
What is headless Dwight?
---
the gaming generation!
---
Most high rank won‚Äôt even bother healing against him, that‚Äôs what makes him weak. Kind of the same as playing against the plague without cleansing
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong he‚Äôs an average good survivor loop wise. The mans got knowledge. But by tech I don‚Äôt mean 360s and moonwalking techs. Like window tech which I mentioned people thought it got removed but you just have to be early. Soon as they vault run through them from a side angle then they follow normal routing and you gain so much distance. It‚Äôs not flashy it helps you when you‚Äôve rinsed a loop. Many techs improve game play and are not just flashy.
---
Nope, you are just a skilled killer.
---
It won't become meta... its borderline meme perk.
---
12 second totem cleanse for a 8 second heal by being in a locker later on?
---
The lack of value there is insane your saving time by being healed by someone else since inner strength requires you to do nothing for 12 seconds, however long it takes you to find a locker and 8 seconds after that.
---
Not optimal but it makes for a good joke when o leave someone alone in a chase and notice they heal 8 seconds after I leave and I know exactly where they are.
---
YAH YOU CAN STILL PIP EVEN IF YOU CAMP, DEVS NEED TO MAKE IT WHERE YOU LOSE A PIP IF YOU CAMP PERIOD. ALSO SURVIVORS WERE CRANKING ON GENS AND NO WHERE NEAR THE HOOKED GUY

Killer: what are you running survivors?
---
Uh deadhard, adrenaline, bt.
---
Sorry didn't see the other post and this is my first time hearing about this
---
In custom games multiple killers and multiple survivors should be allowed
---
Yah no shit, I would pay $20 and even if I only was able to do this to 1 person and the other ran past would be so worth it!
---
Still 700 for me
---
Pay extra attwntion to your surroundings. Once you spot him, he's weak
---
A little late but if that‚Äôs true, than I wonder who would win in ghostface vs everyone in the legion
---
Have fun
---
Is there a source for this? Not calling you a liar but would love to see the actual response
---
I'm aware. I'm not even a trapper player and I feel like I'm going to get memed on by a swf group
---
Nice to see friendly players.
---
There should be a perk where if the killer is in kindred range all generator repair speed is boosted.
---
what is it that needs to be the default? i guess i‚Äôm dumb
---
The way the survivors are lined up. Usually it's zoomed out and not at this angle.
---
I‚Äôd actually like a killer with a tranq gun that you‚Äôd have to reload at a locker
---
I take it as a challenge. One less hook to survive. It's another more positive point of view. Besides, it feels pretty good to defeat a killer with a Mori.
---
Yea I guess playing the game without unfair advantages would be too hard and frustrating for the average swf
---
CONSPIRACY TIME
---
Some people say sprint Burst as well so.
---
When you break him out he‚Äôs weak.
---
I mean mending too not necessarily healing. Good legions can constantly put mend pressure
---
I feel like we would just see enduring, spirit fury, redrum, and ruin on every single killer all the time
---
It‚Äôs because he doesn‚Äôt have to mindgame, he can run loops optimally and you have to guess majority of time when he‚Äôs in shroud.
---
If you truly don't understand why you're wrong by now, then I give up.
---
Ignorance and arrogance are a truly frightening combination.

4% squad...
---
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs above average surv. but you can learn a lot of surv stuff from watching his killer games. Plus, he teaches the basics so for beginners he‚Äôs good. But just gotta pay attention to when he‚Äôs after good survivors
---
Holy shit that's a good idea!
---
You say that, but they released statistics and the worst three maps to survive on, in order, are Hawkins lab, the game, and then Larry's.
---
Uninstalled.
---
Whispers is a very good perk. It allows you to walk up to gens and know if there on that one gen. Also, bbq is good in general to find survivors.  The other 2 are up to you really, you can make a sneaky build or a aggressive build. All up to you.
---
I felt legitimate pain
---
I remember doing that once, then everything went to heel in aboutn90 seconds and as I looked at the 4k scoreboard where survivors had a total of about 10000 points I couldn't help but grit my teeth
---
"Ooooohh.... that MIGHT'VE been my fault "
---
I don‚Äôt learn anything from him, some people might.  All I‚Äôve noticed is that anytime there‚Äôs a good survivor it‚Äôs a sniper or a SWF.
---
one of the mods for dbd confirmed that it's a bug. The survivors aren't supposed to drop more blood orbs when t bagging and it will be removed.

I bought a really good PC a few months ago, but I‚Äôve made so much progress on console I don‚Äôt want to switch. Every character is at level 50. I‚Äôm devotion level 5. I‚Äôll lose so much progress and many cosmetics. Is it really do hard to add the game to Xbox play anywhere so I can play it on PC with my progress?
---
Naw I suck. Ruin seems inconsistent, noed is admitting defeat and mori makes you lose pips unless you use it on death hook. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt run them, but I‚Äôve peaked at rank 4 so I am bad.
---
Original Samurai 1‚Äôs
---
Yeah, honestly. Optimization can only do so much, at some point you hit the limit on consoles
---
Lol BBQ aint a fair comparison cause its literally just Bloodpoint farming for the most part
---
It's even better when you're using Tuft with Judith's. So much salt.
---
On paper it must've seemed like a good idea for BHVR, but in reality with most players completing the tome at roughly the same pace you're bound to get matches where 3+ survivors are trying to do the same challenges. Grindy challenges like X amount of generators or health states healed are fine but then you get to finite resources like chests and totems in a single trial and that's enough for some players to just DC, making the match a lot less fun for the remaining players.
---
BHVR implementing DC punishments at this time with the tomes as they are just seems cruel.
---
No mither forces you to always be injured (broken) but prevents you from bleeding in anyway
---
It would be amazing if we got a Wild West collection, so much potential for badass cosmetics.

As for this Kate cosmetic it's my dream to get the cowgirl hat as a Kate main.

If they add cross play then maybe you‚Äôll be able to cross data over. There is no way atm to do so. Although on PC we had a survey where they asked about cross play. I think they‚Äôll allow Xbox and PS4 players play together before they cross between console and PC
---
Same do you think we have a chance of finishing it in time

Two stalky boys

You‚Äôve always been the kind of person that others can rely on. After achieving a very good skill check on a generator, your fellow survivors will gain the inspired status effect, causing them to complete tasks 2/4/6% faster for forty seconds.
---
I'd love to have this in game!
---
How long on average do you have to wait for a match?
---
I saw that second hatchet throw and I was prepared to be so mad if it connected.
---
Shit that‚Äôs what I am doing right now.
---
The entity is hinting something
---
Noed is fine as is. It gives the killer a final chance to win if the survivors weren't smart enough to destroy the totems during the match, and gives the survivors a nice bit of panic when their buddies start going down instantly.
---
27 tiers left,  by doing all tier 3 and 4 challenges that‚Äôs minimum 16 tiers. So 11 tiers left, 1 fragment every 800xp, so 1 tier is 8000xp, 88,000xp which is 21 levels if you‚Äôre over level 50 player level. There are 40 something days left so if you get at least 2k a day you‚Äôll be fine. 300xp bonus on first game of the day and 1xp per second in trial, bonus xp for emblems. So the average game of 10 minutes is about 640xp, that‚Äôs plus the 300 bonus 940, So if you play 3 game a day from here on out and get 2-3k and complete all challenges. You‚Äôll get it
---
Nemisis + red rum though! It would be a fun combo!
---
Don‚Äôt forget keys! I‚Äôve seen some guy really think survivors with keys are OP.  üòÇüôÑ
---
I meant anytime there is a survivor he whole chat and true accuses them of sniping or being a SWF. I‚Äôm not saying they are, most of the time I check profile when he‚Äôs so persistent on them being a SWF and they aren‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got 2k hours I know how to be optimal. Don‚Äôt watch true that‚Äôs a start, he thinks wasting pallets isn‚Äôt a thing.
---
1 sec pallet breaks + almost non existent successful hit stun. I think I prefer one survivor to die for free rather than have a killer on steroids permanently after gens are done. Combine that with STBFL, remember me (if that's the one which increases gates opening times), and enduring, 0% sucessful hit stun, 0% pallet stun, 10 minutes to open 1 gate, gg.
---
Your literally just made fireup but a hex and with stun reduction.
---
He's making an off topic post about actor Kelsey Grammer. What a nasty fuck.
---
This challenge has been impossible for me to complete because nobody is being hooked in endgame x-x
---
Dwighty &lt;3
---
Did he's a fucking lvl 35 doctor also!!!! Obviously a hacker üò§
---
well i hope you're left hand dominant otherwise...
---
I'd run BBQ, Surveillance, Whispers, and Make Your Choice I suppose. It's hard without more teachables
---
Can also confirm I've kept progress while switching challenges. They just get "paused", like it states.
---
He's like normal Dwight, but airheaded.
---
It's so situational though. On a map like Lery's the perk is almost completely worthless. Instead of changing the perk they should have fixed the maps it can be abused on. It still won't be fun for the killer when they get maps like Haddonfield.
---
Omg ü§£ü§£ that's happened to me so many times as a survivor. His face is priceless LOL.
---
BBQ, surveillance and make your choice/sloppy butcher would be ok.
---
Or play normally, when gens pop slug the remaining survivors, open the door yourself, and hang.
---
It's almost like you can do this in the normal fashion, but you chose to do it differently, and then bitched because you chose to do it differently.
---
I do all 5 totems at the start of the game. I'd only get one use of Inner Strength so I don't use it and anyone who happens to use it in my games is sad
---
They might not scratch their balls but might want to scratch something else
---
Could‚Äôve saved a thread y‚Äôknow ...since I comment whatever I want
---
God this sub is riddled with idiotic killer mains.
---
It‚Äôs to late for that and it‚Äôs a bad idea IMO. Choosing a survivor should just be aesthetics as the game play never changes.
---
Its a good day for insidious Bubba
---
People who think noob3 is toxic haven‚Äôt seen this guy, he is the epitome of toxicity in this game
---
Uses of No Mither:
---
1. Memes
---
2. Challenge
---
3. Starting the game injured to speed the game up (both your gen speed with Resilience and death with No Mither)
---
4. maybe counter one of the least played killers (Plague)
---
making it start you as healthy would
---
1. Destroy the memes or running it with OoO. As you're a simple asshole in killer eyes now
---
2. Take the challenge away, as it makes early-game easier and makes you play like a puss until you get hit once
---
3. not have the start game injured "bonus"
---
4. make new players confused
---
5. give us a perk not worth running anyway and take the memes away.
---
All we need is a bloodpoint bonus.
---
Fuck oni I want the exclusives
---
Ranked system in its entirety needs a rework, starting with the time between each rank reset.

---
And it doesn't get annoying seeing posts about tbagging and pallet looping?
---
...maybe
---
You're getting sick trapper practice, but all I've learned is how to better communicate to survivors that I'm going to farm with them.
---
Twitter
---
I was thinking about posting it myself since i'm already active on there, but go ahead!
---
Dude I think it's just your connection I play console on the original Xbox one and run at 60fps lowest ping and nice textures
---
Around 5 mins, why?
---
Keys are broken just like mori‚Äôs
---
When your parents catch you doin gens
---
Wouldn't the killer be the huntress since they came in the same chapter
---
Run quickly and listen for it. 
---
Or you can get to the closest exit and wait for the killer to close the hatch. That works too I guess.
---
Again, not all of his ideas are spot on. He‚Äôs a killer main, but if you *watch* his killer games, you can learn shit. All I‚Äôm saying man. Just because you or people don‚Äôt like his attitude doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not informative.
---
So you have joined my cult-uurrre?
---
&gt; The top comment in this chain is calling this an straight-up cash grab where BHVR is purposely creating a problem so people spend money.
---
Prove that it isn't.   They are following industry standard monetization practices in regards to their battlepass design.
---
Consistently inconsistent
---
THE MORE I PLAY THE GAME AS KILLER, AND THE HIGHER RANK I GET ON BOTH SIDES THE MORE I REALIZE THAT SURVIVOR IS SIMPLY A FAR MORE FULFILLING EXPERIENCE. AS KILLER I HAVE TO EITHER BURN A MAP OFFERING KR PRAY I DON'T GET A FARM MAP AS A STEALTH KILLER OR A GRASSLESS MAP AS A TRAP KILLER. I DONT WANT TO PLAY CHASE KILLERS ALL DAY I WANNA SPOOK.
---
He lies. Do the generators.
---
Buying the DLC is usually cheaper. Now, I think it's a little moee expensive.
---
The new chapter also comes out next week if that's something you are thinking of getting with yui and oni .
---
r/TheCouncilOfAsh
---
if the order was random (at least the "hard" ones and "easy" ones being randomized in their own categories) then it'd make more sense. now we're very likely to have the same challenges.
---
Im not saying make keys weak,im just saying they need to put a little more effort more than one button. Also i agree on the Ebony part, but green one is pointlessly complicated. Just make it 2 hooks on that one person.
---
Dude I passionately hate claudette's with their urban evasion and their self care they're always useless or huge pussies.
---
Idk who isn‚Äôt thankful but at the same time others want the game to be even better. 
---
Also with the high amount of dlcs sold shows the devs people appreciate them and more importantly appreciate the licenses they go out of their way to get for us. 
---
I am thankful they brought in licensed killers to the game.
---
Well that‚Äôs what happen to spirt players
---
He plays both equally, a killer game then survivor. You clearly haven‚Äôt since his twitch. I‚Äôve watched him since 2016, I hop in to see what BS he‚Äôs got to say each day. Never see your name in chat
---
I'm trying to unhook 25 people and getting one per game is a challenge
---
The true nea main is back bois. *sexy time has begun*
---
Awesome, thank you. That‚Äôs extremely helpful.
---
I know I‚Äôm just constantly seeing people complaining all the time but not showing the developers any love
---
them most important rule of cooling with water is making sure LIQUIDS CAN'T REACH ANYTHING IMPORTANT
---
and yes, frozen blackberries are considered water here
---
Ok Voomer
---
Send at least one a message... The others usually catch on.
---
drives me absolutely nuts between doing 15 basement hooks and then moving on to the iridescent challenge (that's bugged to only 1 progress per game regardless of how many you get) or trying to UNHOOK TWO SURVIVORS AFTER THE ENDGAME COLLAPSE HAS BEGUN yeah absolutely love it
---
Yea sorry im gay for playing a character with no add ons and a basic killer build my fault
---
Blasphemer
---
Would be great is clown had Stridor
---
See you in a few days
---
They're changing it!!??!?!? FIINNAALLLYYY
---
Sooo... bikini Yui when?
---
Ok *HRAO*omer
---
I'm the complete opposite on PS4. You wait for like 5 minutes as survivor and 30 seconds as killer
---
K. 
---
We‚Äôll see you again when you realize it‚Äôs just a rockstar game.
---
I didn't realize that was the intended way to get the challenge. Thanks for the advice!
---
Lol.
---
Level 3 is getting easier, my guess being around 11:00 since that's the normal update time
---
Staring Contest, First ro Blink loses
---
Imagine actually using any of these perks
---
You got a sweaty 5 blink Nurse once per 100 games too. Didn‚Äôt make that any less broken. The commodity of something is not and should not be a factor in balance.
---
Can we rename his power to "heres Johnny"
---
Had the same issue with pallet drops during a chase. Would get chased and drop 3 pallets during it. Find out afterward that only 1 of those counted. Was definitely mad about that one. Sure, one was in her face, but the other two were like... shes just around the corner from me.
---
I tired to farm the grab challenge on the last tome but no one would let me grab them. I had to go scratched mirror myers to get my grab this tome and last tome.
---
I am thankful it's a dev team that listen to us and take time to look at how the community is doing. Yeah, they have their mistakes and people rip into them for even the smallest things, but they truly have done a pretty good job so far.
---
I‚Äôm aware he switches off, twitch name is way diff plus I go on twitch to View. He‚Äôs a better killer than surv, pick up the actions of the survivors he goes against, not what he does.
---
Wait my names jake
---
LEGION - MULTIPLAYER KILLER, ALL 4 PEOPLE CHOOSE ONE PERK EACH, BALANCE MOVE SPEED AS NEEDED. THEY CAN EVEN BE THE EXACT SAME SPEED AS SURVIVORS WITH A BUFF LIKE THERE BEING FOUR OF THEM.
---
OR MAYBE ALL 4 OF THEM THAT ONE PLAYER CAN SWAP BETWEEN ALA FREDDY/DEMO teleport.
---
AND IF WE GET THE FORMER ONLY ONE PLAYER SHOULD HAVE TO OWN THEM AND HAVE THE PERKS UNLOCKED. NO GATEKEEPING KILLERS.
---
which means Level 4 might get adjusted as well hopefully
---
Honestly was expecting you to say ghostface or Myers but maybe I just don‚Äôt play enough wraith and forgot about him
---
I used the t-bags to destroy the t-bags!
---
There are some killer that have let me go, always appreciated. But having me work on gens until the endgame was just weird to me, I thought. I didn‚Äôt mind it, but was unusual
---
EU servers, majority of people on spirit GF or nurse don‚Äôt use add ons. Yet true uses prayer beads every spirit match. I‚Äôm rank 1 killer get there every reset, don‚Äôt use add ons unless I‚Äôm on Billy
---
CI is better than Ruin because there's no chance it'll go down in 10 seconds. Noed isn't that good in general because it only activates when you've already lost most of the time. There are also better perks to run in general, and it can't be broken. Moris are also boring and more often cause you to lose rank at higher ranks.
---
It‚Äôs happened to me sometimes especially with a DC and an early kill after but I won‚Äôt complain
---
Stake Out, Techinician
---
according to the ranking system, your goal is to "make game fun for everyone" first and then kill them all
---
Ranking up is easy at first, but soon you'll start getting punished if you end the match (kill everyone) too quickly
---
I couldn't breathe, that is hilarious. xD
---
Yep theyre free to move optimally you have to hide.
---
Never complain about a free win
---
NA player here so maybe it‚Äôs different. Not saying it‚Äôs always ultra‚Äôs but there‚Äôs ALWAYS addons. I mean GF doesn‚Äôt really have super beneficial addons, but that‚Äôs just IMO. The other two benefit a lot from addons but again imo
---
The salt is real
---
Big big facts. And free Bps
---
It's called franklin's Demise
---
I like to play Myers but getting is a grab on gens is nearly impossible that too with dedicated servers. And I hate to play gf I do not like his play style.
---
Felt like I was reading a passage from the Archives. Very similar writing style
---
Does anyone read ancient Sumerian?

Try to remember hatch spawns. Combine that with the fact that killers move faster than survivors and don't need to hide from anything, and it's obvious killers have an advantage when looking for hatch.

Man to man actually get a job that forces you to be social, i.e. restaurant host, cashier, anything. It‚Äôll make you get out of your shell. If you‚Äôre under 16 and can‚Äôt get a job just try talking to people at school, no matter who it is.
---
I remember when I was against 4 man swf, me still being baby wraith, and I'm gonna admit, they were SHREDDING me. Once the exit gates were opened, all 4 of them were tea bagging in them. I didnt want to give them satisfaction so I went stand in the corner and decided to grab a drink. And, I am not lying, I came back two minutes later AND THEY WERE STILL THERE. WHAT.
---
Ohhhhh... Idk probably?
---
I play on PS4 so I have no idea.
---
You act like you are getting a divorce. If you feel this strongly about a game you might have bigger problems.
---
Exactly, some of these challenges place people in a tough spot. Where as, for example, 25 hook saves can be obtained in time. Sure it‚Äôs a grind but your just playing the normal game and will be earned easily in time. But something like say, saving 2 people during the endgame collapse seems ridiculous. First you need to actually make it there. Then you need enough people alive still to get the hook saves and then you can‚Äôt get caught. It places people in a very difficult spot. The basement hooks bothers me the most because I don‚Äôt want to play like that, I get it‚Äôs a build some use and having been on the survivor side of that, I know I don‚Äôt want to play like that. But sadly that challenge forces me to play like that in order to unlock more of the story or rift fragments. So I hope that‚Äôs one they change is some way. Being taken out of my ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù with say perks, I‚Äôm fine with. But I don‚Äôt want to have to turn my overall gameplay upside down.
---
they definitely exist but very few and far between.  it's a pretty poor game for such a thing.
---
On steam you have to add them as a friend first and hope they accept. Otherwise just get their attention and smack a gen or something.
---
No mither, self care, pharmacy, and inner strength to heal yourself in a flash
---
They always keep running away from me :( how do you get their attention if they run away?

you seem like a nice player, so its sad to see another person like that leave, but it is strange that you announced it
---
i feel it bro. my best friend, who got me into dbd, and i can‚Äôt play sometimes, it says he‚Äôs offline even tho he‚Äôs online, and i can‚Äôt join his party or when i invite him he joins and gets kicked two seconds in. it‚Äôs a huge issue and i‚Äôve been trying to find a place to report the bug to the devs but it probably won‚Äôt help much... we aren‚Äôt toxic either, we kinda gen rush but also work on each other‚Äôs rifts and daily‚Äôs. sometimes we even have to restart the entire game due to it being so buggy. sorry that you can‚Äôt play with your friend broski
---
I like you good sir take my upvote
---
I do not understand what they did to make grabs so buggy like they are now since you say it
---
Ghost face recovery add ons are his strongest by far. So beneficial. Plus most NA players are bots. Definitely goes Asia-EU-NA in terms of skill.
---
It's kinda weird.
---
Console experiences never seem to be the same across the board. There's always "mine runs fine" from one person and then "it's unplayable" from another. I wouldn't say it's consistently 60 fps, but on my regular Xbox one, it's a pretty decent frame rate on both sides. Pc does feel smoother no doubt, but my recent experiences with console are definitely consistently above 30 fps.
---
Thank god the name is on the meme. Wouldn't want to see it stolen.
---
Yea totally
---
What if I'm on both sides and not in the middle lmao
---
I assume as, if it matches with the PTB, Level 4 is all master challenges
---
He is a bold one
---
It‚Äôll still probably be that but they said they‚Äôll make them easier if need be
---
The Doctor: "Annnd nyow, my dear Frederickk, I shall show you the inner *machinations* of the human mind: the SUBCONSCIOUS!"
---
Freddy, who's been in the Doctor's dream this entire time: "Uhh.... sure, whatever bitch!"
---
Lol like right next to you or what
---
dw i heard this yea was supposed to focus on optimization, im sure there is a huge optimization patch coming! /s
---
And then they will get instadowned anyway wich tremendously lessens the reward of healing, its the perfect dilemma to inflict to a survivor, like tuft myers with thana
---
Hey at least the store frame rates are good(when you go to buy a new character). They made sure to get that right!
---
^this 100%
---
people ruin this game..
---
 *M U S T  B E  S A F E  H O O K S*

makes me think that his rage mode should gain the ability to destroy pallets that land on him, whats the point of being a "rage mode" when you gain nothing but a weaker billy saw?
---
BAILIFF! STAB HIS NUTS!
---
The games where you loop the killer for a long time and your team *actually* does gens
---
I am so... so tired of playing against Trappers.
---
Some of them were pretty brutal so I for sure see changes coming there. Maybe somehow they‚Äôll use reactions to the level 3 changes to help decide on level 4 changes
---
who is the scary killer now?
---
Pretty sure he is at 115%
---
Hopefully. I have faith
---
No way not out of his power. He‚Äôs mad slow
---
Pharmacy is garbage for that loadout tbh. 
---
What you really need is Solidarity.
---
Mhm, other side of the little tug boat
---
That's why you go for the perk first
---
Been that way since release. Been promised to be fixed and has yet to do so. Instead, we get dlc and archives, which I am happy for, but the console port is about as dick cheese as possible.
---
On swamp? Damn lol spawn right in the heart beat

---
Yeah, but what if an ebony pops up.
---
For most killers, spam your power and intentionally avoid hitting survivors. Make sure they can notice that you‚Äôre not hitting them. If you hit a generator a lot, they might assume you want to farm gen grabs.
---
Fuck all dat
---
Well i still hide in closets i just have perks now :c
---
Then you choose between the perk or one ez game?
---
My favorite type of matches are when the game snowballs when you‚Äôre playing killer and secure a 4K with 1 or 0 gems left. Especially if gens were getting done fast.
---
*"Could you please be a little nicer?"*
---
The game is in beta but yes and there is no cross progression as of now
---
Goes in 6 either direction unless you have a SWF with a rank 18 with rank 6
---
Where in the realm is Kate Denson?
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
I know but before demo came out the framerate was pretty solid all around. Navigating menus was smooth and both killer and survivor hovered around 40 fps (except for doctor). But the update fucked something up and the devs still haven‚Äôt acknowledged it in either the mid-chapter or legacy patch.
---
No mither: the counter to plague's puke, NOED, Rancor, Ghostface stalk, Tier III Myers, chainsaws...
---
Imagine thinking No0b3 is toxic in 2019. Also yeah, AaronPlaysTV is a complete asshole. He used to run with Ochido back in 2016/2017. There are videos of him bullying killers on Ochidos channel.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt listen to that guy above. Stalking with Ghostface isn‚Äôt the best way to play him.
---
I do a few things. I spin around a lot, and that usually works unless they are baby survivors and run away. If you chase people for a while and don't hit them when you have the opportunity to, they'll usually get the message. If I have to down someone, then I'll carry them to a gen and hit it.
---
If you're Trapper, just go to an open area where you can be seen, and step in your own trap repeatedly.
---
IM FUCKING TIRED OF GEETING THE DAMN NAT ERROR ON PS4 AND BHVR DOESNT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT IT, WE STILL ARE THE GARBAGE OF THE COMUNNITY I GUESS, FUCK CONSOLE AM I RIGHT?
---
Underrated perk on spirit I like to use is surveillance. Due to her high mobility you can hit a gen and be able to phase back ASAP if it gets touched.
---
Dun dun... dun dun... dundun.... dundundundundundundundundun...
---
Chomp.
---
They included even the Entity playing pool, nice one
---
A perk slot for something that I might not even use?
---
Did you really expect them to do anything in the two months you were gone?
---
The last survivor who just stops running and points to the hook.
---
You missed a big part of what I said.
---
Killer side of this is just as bad. We'll wait half a fucking hour to get a match only for some dick to drop out the moment they see the "Secret" Offering (plot twist, it was a Shroud of Speration)
---
I swear, this game is such shit sometimes. Entitled killers always talking bout nerfing survivors BUT LOOK AT THIS, I MEAN CMON. I hope they fix this in the next update, it's literally made the game unplayable and I'm uninstalling right now
---
Tome 3 is actually pretty well possible, just requires a lot of time and as a killer you might have to play a bit dirty to get it. But thank gkd they'll adjust tome 4, the quests were simply hilarious
---
Bippity boppity, your bbq is my property.
---
The switch needs major help. When docked experience is even worse than handheld. Learn that half second early reaction time.
---
I mean they did deliver with the ST chapter and they announced in interviews that they had the most devs in BHVR history. So yeah, I kinda did.
---
I'm almost done with the entire thing before they fix it lmao
---
definitely lol he deserves it after all that stuff last month
---
You could run the Left Behind perk, which was recently buffed to show where the hatch is located within a certain radius. Personally I think it's not the best use of a perk slot, but it might help give you ideas of where to look for the hatch.
---
Keep in mind that the hatch can spawn as early as when there are 2 gens left (if there are only two survivors left in the trial). The rule is the hatch will spawn when the amount of gens completed equals the number of survivors remaining in the trial plus one. This means you can start keeping an eye out for the hatch early in some instances.
---
Oh, I was mistaken.
---
You were speaking from the perspective of the killer!
---
Oof
---
I spawned in the other day down a long hall from the trapper on hawkins, no walls between us or anything just boxes and as soon as he and I both moved in the slightest we were already staring at each other. Luckily he was farming but it felt really unfair.
---
Isn't this image from 2017?
---
Little late to the party bud
---
The speed at which people dc is amazing
---
That means you can now get the ‚ÄúWAZZZZZZZUUPPP‚Äù mask
---
Counter play to any killer is to neutralize their power. For ghostface you reveal him now hes weaker than doctor. The change in your playstyle is to be actively looking out and not staying at low vision areas
---
hangmans trick and bloody party streamers. if that doesnt scream suicidal killer idk what will
---
The killer wasnt farming, he tried to get one of the basement challenges. I believe the one where you'd have to hook 2 people in the basement since he was guarding it pretty bad
---
WHY DON'T THESE FUCKING PALLETS EVER WORK THE FUCKING THING DOESN'T EVEN GIVE ME THE PROMPT TO DROP IT LET ALONE ACTUALLY FUCKING DO IT
---
I COULD HAVE JUST HAD THE ~PERFECT~ PALLET SAVE BUT INSTEAD I'M STANDING THERE MASHING SPACEBAR LIKE A FUCKING IDIOT WHILE THE KILLER STROLLS RIGHT ON BY ME

Two in the basement with MS is bugged I think. I hooked someone in the basement, they got saved and as they were running out I downed the rescuer, hooked them in the basement and I got it. Never had both down there at the same time.
---
is this a word guess
---
It just blocks the furthest ones. You can run to the furthest ones regardless of whether they are corrupted, which is how I always find people at the start.
---
Wow, wonder if he was memeing, either way that's the craziest screen name/build combo I've seen
---
It only 'teleports' if you block its way.
---
You stupid
---
Legion is pretty good. I main him at red ranks and he is super fun
---
Just to be clear, they didn't they that they'd make them easier.
---
Being BHVR I expect them to make the challenges even more ridiculous.
---

---
Said it just in case.
---
Redrum is op, other than that, it‚Äôs fine
---
Exactlyyyyyyyy
---
HAHA!
---
Out of his power he is 115% speed
---
Good job! You got this. See you in the fog
---
Can you please do one for Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter?
---
‚ÄúBro, you know I called dibs like 30 years ago.‚Äù
---
The problem with the grindy challenges is that they are the first ones you have to do before you can even attempt the ridiculous master challenges. People are unhooking left and right without doing gens even on red ranks. It's been ruining most games for 2 days now...
---
Save the killer from the entity
---
Saw this (or a very similar) concept before
---
That's really nice of you to do man, what a weird thing to come across while gaming, hope they were just joking but its not something cool to joke about
---
Just to be clear. They didn't say they'd make them easier. BHVR being BHVR I expect them to introduce even more ridiculous challenges.
---
I had this idea for a while but I‚Äôm to lazy to make it
---
Could've been worse. You could've been using the pipe
---
I say we boycot the game so they can fix the real issue.
---
He just has a better gaming chair.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Inner Strength
---
I doubt they‚Äôll do tomes on any paid killers until they use up the 4 free ones. People already have to pay for the premium rift, let alone having to pay for an extra killer to progress through the tome!
---
See this is why people shouldn't complain about dedicated servers
---
if you add me on discord i can explain it, pm me.
---
NOOBKILLER
---
OP wasn't planning on head on actually working anyway. They knew they had ds so they went into a locker. The title is a joke
---
Is it the challenge of going against someone like that?  Do you like trying to outplay them and getting the good plays or is it just the sheer beauty of seeing a Chainsaw Car Crash?
---
I like you too: you deserve my upvote
---
I watched a video with Monto and you still bleed with no mither until they plan on changing that
---
yes, im a meme noob
---
Dread- Ghostemane. 
---
But in all seriousness I hope he‚Äôs alright, I had an unfortunate loss due to that in 8th grade.
---
It is impossible not to read in nerd's voice.
---
Of course the first perk you want is the one to aim for, the problem is on later webs (like 40-50) when you're looking to get your 2nd/3rd perk and that gets gobbled before you can reach it.
---
What? You need perks or addons for spirit? Never noticed
---
Killer side on PS4 is almost INSTANT for me. Which means I get VERY pissed at killers for dodging. It takes forever to find a match just let us have it DAMN!
---
Like those games that you get in the good jukes while things get done, eh?  A good one, I agree.  Is it the rush of out playing?   Or is it cause it's a solid win?
---
I once went to get some tea, started watching a stream and after an hour noticed strange sounds coming from an unknown location
---
the match has started
---
Okay, come back when you have 999,999 bloodpoints (it happened to me and I was severely disappointed)
---
Like those games that come down to the wire, eh?  It does feel satisfying when you get that hook and the altruistic survivors get gutsy.. Making them delicious targets.  
---
Do you run NOED or Ruin?
---
It's very possible haha. 
---
I always send gg but sometimes I can't send a message so I send a friend request instead!
---
As MCote once said, go play something else.
---
1. Plague
---
2.freddy
---
3.doctor
---
4.clown 
---
5.legion
---
6.bubba
---
Plague has some good perks and when used properly is very strong if you can apply enough pressure to survivors.
---
Freddie is extremely strong but his perks are not too great.
---
Doctor has Some good perks but his power isn‚Äôt it amazing.
---
Clown is good at stopping looping, and it has perks are great. However he lacks Map pressure so he isn‚Äôt too strong
---
Legion has OK perks and is not too good to play as, however though he is pretty fun
---
Bubba is easily one of the worst killers in the game and 2/3 of the perks that he has aren‚Äôt too great. since you have barbecue I wouldn‚Äôt even get him at this point
---
Survivor Queues are instant for me at Rank 10.  
---
Killer at the same Rank is a 9:30-ish average.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I know ya'll hate us streamers, but sitting in a killer Queue for 10 minutes isn't fun for anyone.  :(
---
Brutal stength, enduring, spirit fury, Redrum. Yep, it‚Äôs pallet eating time.
---
Dedicated servers won't fix this and according to PC players seem to make things worse.
---
I feel like there should be a 1 minute or 2 minute window for BOTH.
---
Think about it, if you were a survivor and saw on your screen that one guy got hit and loops the killer well. Why would you stop doing your gen?  
---
As a killer you have to learn when it's a good time to call off a chase. If a guy's good and loops you longer than you like, call it off and go back to patrolling gens till you find a new victim. It also helps you prevent them from just powering through them without interruption. 
---
And definitely try not to dc too much. Next update will also penalize you for it. It's better to just admit your match is a bust, take a few deep breaths and just try to earn some more bloodpoints by eating pallets, hitting gens or mindlessly chasing people around. You gain nothing when you dc, whereas if you atleast finish it you'll gain some bp and exp. You might even have gotten a late game kill if the survivors slipped up.
---
The tutorials are basically "press these buttons, listen for heartbeat. go get em champ"
---
the tutorials are as in depth as there options settings.
---
Good demo boi
---
Are they adding a two killer mode?
---
I love this game too much already. My favourite game is any game that isnt repetitive. Tunnel/camp/spirit/freddy/billy is fine a s long as its not always like that. Atm too much spirit n freddy
---
I generally smack a generator to indicate I'd like to farm. Majority of the time that works but there is the odd occasion that it doesn't
---
Lol they'll just make graphics worse AGAIN, how's that for 'optimization?'
---
He is a m1 killer. he is a noob stomper like old freddy, i cant remember the last time me and my squad gave more then 2 kills to a legion.
---
Way she goes
---
"All outfits" 
---
pigs newest outfit is still full price.
---
üê∏üçµ
---
Good thing OP was saved from atrocious tunneling by that greatly designed perk.
---
Thanks!
---
;)
---
Im surprised you were able to complete it
---
Yeah no problem. Good luck in your future games
---
well you finished it soo..
---
Basically it should read "have two people hooked in the basement simultaneously while using monstrous shine", not actually that hard imo, just need a couple of potatoes or a basement Bubba build
---
I guess the big question is; ***WHEN*** are they fixing it?
---
I'll admit it.
---
Bloodpoints are Bloodpoints.
---
Git Gud, fellow survivor kids!!!
---
Basement time.
---
It tells you what it is lol. Run monstrous shrine perk. Hook one survivor in the basement and then another while the first one is still on the hook.
---
It still have it to me
---
sorry dbd is taking a break come back later
---
Btw what I mean by the title is, why is this challenge a thing?  Or something like that
---
What does it say (i think it's akkadian)
---
I‚Äôd probably wait to complete those challenges. Devs on Twitter said they were going to make them less difficult
---
until you need it for a challenge and find that none of your killers have monstrous shrine AND agitation/iron grip. oof
---
Basement bubba ez
---
They could make them free until their rift closes
---
Weird, I even looked it up and it said you don't bleed
---
And how it has horns and a third eye? Yeah, I didn't really think about it until I actually looked at it again
---
I thought it said Player Oof in the corner ngl
---
[reminds me of this](https://youtu.be/OQW5Zms6Y5E)
---
I think the trapper's skin could be a bit darker and dirtier.
---
I very very bigbrain
---
It‚Äôs nowhere close to being as bad as unhook 2 survivors during EGC. 
---
Your challenge right there is pretty easy to get done. Monstrous shrine makes it slightly more difficult.
---
I never watched any Dbd Streamer, can you try to give me an example of why he is viewed as toxic? Ill take the risk of it being biased
---
This one was glitched for me. I never had more than one person in the basement but it gave it to me.
---
Quality meme
---
Sacrifice all 5 survivors in the basement at the same time with a Trapper Trap as Ghostface.
---
Oh you meant oni blood. I didn't know about that one but I know NORMAL bleeding still happens. Does the hemorrhage effect drop more blood orbs? If so sloppy butcher is going to be one EVERY oni
---
For the key challenge you can just burn through your green keys senselessly or usefully. At least they have a use for that.
---
See you in hot
---
I think it's glitched so you can only get 1 per game.
---
I actually hope this meme/phrase/whatever goes sooner than later, at this point I don't even know what people using it are trying to tell me.
---
Basically the campingchallenge
---
Not too sure, maybe? I know people are running thanatophobia and knockout because his design is going to encourage slugging. Infectious fright too is good.
---
Because most survivors are entitled and want the killers to follow imaginary rules that they made! While they are playing a 4 man swf with nothing but meta perks!
---
But you got iridescent head?
---
Haha that's awesome, female entity is canon now, idc what anyone says
---
If looking like a cunt is worth a few kills then feel free.
---
These issues kind of push me away. Like I‚Äôd love to play still, but having to sit 10+ minutes in a que and potentially get facecamped / tunneled or go against a Mori. It wouldn‚Äôt be that bad if survivor ques were quick
---
Some of the challenges are cancer, but to balance it out when I play like that as killer I usually throw them the win once I've gotten what I need. They don't really need it, because basement dwelling encourages gen crushing even at mid ranks, but I make sure they all get away.
---
I know right
---
Seriously, don't listen to this guy. Some streamer came up with a good build where he doesn't use stalk so now everybody thinks that's the best way to play him but it's not. Get used to using his stalk especially leaning from Corners as it builds the meter twice as fast. Again don't listen to the idiot above me.
---
Same. I was annoyed because someone suicided on hook, and I hooked the second person a second too late. Was pleasantly surprised when it counted anyway.
---
Lol this game
---
Even the entity said what the hell myers to that one!
---
You're an idiot. Just because one douche streamer came up with a way to play him without stalking doesn't mean it's the best way. Stop misleading people.
---
Got some other in mind i‚Äôd like to do first, but after sure!
---
Hmmm dedicated servers?
---
Deerstalker can actually be pretty useful as well. And not to mention nurse's calling, people are GOING to heal if you have thanatophobia and to escape blood orbs so that just makes it SOOOOO easy to find them
---
Says not a hex lol
---
Y u bully me
---
Love how they gave her a Adam‚Äôs apple.
---
Mind breaker is pretty bad, but good job!
---
I agree with ya on most points, but I like being forced to play diff styles and perks, I've learned new skills, and have become a better player for it!
---
Well I‚Äôm just making him aware because it‚Äôs in the subreddits rules about over saturated content and it could get taken down straight away without warning. I wasn‚Äôt saying he couldn‚Äôt post it, I was just informing him. 
---
No need to be like that man.

Seems to be something with the rift, or aliens are molesting your game, one or the other

It didn't change the thing about her that was OP. Her power gives you no feedback, nothing to work with. You can literally stand still and call it a mindgame. There needed to be an animation survivors could see when she is charging the power.

---
I like how the developers will probably patch this soon, but will take 6 months for an easy balance patch or bug fix.
---
I didn't create the template but I created the meme
---
I really want to but waiting time for lobbies where Im am (EU-Frankfurt server btw) is atrocious...i dont wanna spend my time waiting ...just wanna play ;(
---
thank you for this
---
Yeah ik it is but I like the meme itself
---
Yes, I used photoshop to edit the perk icons and text, but for the perk and power templates I used [this](https://imgbin.com/png/S5gSBpyj/dead-by-daylight-template-michael-myers-reddit-imgur-png)
---
I was lucky to finish the challenge that requires 2 saves at the endgamecollab if they change this now im gonna cry
---
Nah but I created the meme
---
Wrong, test it in a custom match with a friend. I belive that the shards glowing was just a rumor spread about to draw attention away from spirit. They should actually add that in
---
Shit, here we go again.
---
A) the survivors see anything as camping joke is dead and gone, let it Rest In Peace, alongside the rulebook of survivors for killers
---
B) they never said there was no boring/predictable build seen in the survivor side, they just made an observation about their side of the picture but of course you couldn‚Äôt take it because the world starts shaking when it doesn‚Äôt talk about killer mains and how they experience shit for five seconds
---
C) are you complaining about survivors running an exhaustion perk? What?
---
Possesses awareness would also apply to healing as well though
---
Whack, I tested it with a friend as killer and he said it looked lighter. Oh well, I‚Äôm likely wrong anyway. I knew how it worked I just thought it did that too. My apologies
---
Well actually I did see it once while playing today, she left me to go across the map and I noticed her body had a ton of glowing crystals, but I was pretty far away from her and it doesn‚Äôt happen consistently so I‚Äôm not sure what the deal is there
---
i wish, this is a bug in custom games. I'm the michael myers on the left in this pic lol. They should make it mode.
---
feelsbadman.jpg as a killer main, i completely understand. the queue times suck and take forever. i hope bhvr fixes it.
---
It‚Äôs gonna be a lot more common with the archive missions and shit
---
It's called photoshop and graphic design skill.
---
Happened with Claudette when i were using Myers 2 red add ons. Dropped down from on top of killer shack, we both looked at each other, and i tried again and killed her.
---
the rank 18 could be a swf bc that is how that works now but I have been getting rank 15s in rank6
---
Xbox is a fuckin mess dude.
---
it's trying to communicate
---
Hes proud of himself that he finally got someone lol
---
I‚Äôm not denying that entitlement comes from both sides, nor am I saying survivor mains are free of fault. Toxicity is a big issue, and it sucks. Now that that‚Äôs out of the way:
---
A) Camping are tunneling are legit things, but I am as tired of seeing survivors complain about it as I am of killers making fun of their complaints, even if usually survivors complain with reason about these issues.
---
B) I‚Äôm bitching about your comment because you chose a humorous thread about things survivors encounter to go ‚Äúbut you do it to!! Survivor bad too!!‚Äù Like, what for? To let us know there‚Äôs perks all survivors run too? Yeah we know.  We want to strangle every moron with self care running to a corner, so we know. The only reason I see to that comment or observation of ‚Äúbut survivors do it too!‚Äù in multiple threads (not by you of course, nothing personal) is because everything needs to revolve around how the killer perceives the game or a genuine dislike for survivor mains idk
---
C) you brought up exhaustion perks as something you were tired of seeing, that‚Äôs why it stood up to me. Like, yeah, in a chase you probably depend 100% on an exhaustion, like the killer on certain perks for initial slowing of the game, tracking, etc. But nothing deep, just pointing out something that stood out to me.
---
D) Also damn, you have been messaged a lot about camping and tunneling. Not saying they were right of a cussing you of it, just that not every survivor main out there screeches about tunneling when you hit them twice during a match, and I‚Äôm so ducking tired of that meme
---
Instead of the Psycho, the Shining would fit perfectly, but nonetheless great ideas in general !
---
Yeah you do. NOED is a meh perk anyway, I would rather take something that helps the entire game than just have a chance to give you kills in the endgame (and even then just chance because survivors might cleanse all totems, simply juke you or get saves anyway and unless you camp or slug well you get one,maybe two extra kills on average depending on how cocky they are). But acting like you "lose" the game when you use it because it's a crutch is stupid. Tons of "crutch" perks on the survivor side too if you think about it.
---
2 Questions.
---
1. Will "The Titan" have a unique story or will it be the same as the other Big Daddy's.
---
2. Who would the survivor be? The protagonist from the first game (Jack i believe) or no survivor?
---
so the generic "edgy teenager" turns into "normal but famous dude" and everyone still points towards the earlier, edgy self? I know 2 Youtubers who went through the same, just with less fame.
---
Thanks for the explanation
---
It gets rekt by sloppy butcher
---
Any thoughts on the other skins like his Devil Skin and the Stab Enthusiast Skin?
---
And nurse's calling.
---
Ha! Killer did that to me but didn‚Äôt realize I had a key.  I ran as if heading to gate, vaulted, he looked around then I vaulted back and opened that hatch.  Sweet, sweet, karma.
---
Healing time got changed a while ago. After that happened I stopped using it, and now it's pretty much obsolete because Inner Strength is a better perk
---
*Laughs in Legion
---
You cant leave it on other than the hatch. Removal is required.
---
Because an idiot tbagging or spamming noise indicators a few times isn‚Äôt stopping you from playing the game where as killer face camping literally means the survivor cannot do anything, they‚Äôre not even closely comparable.
---
Either one of his perks or his power should be named "here's Johnny"
---
Well I was his second hooked surviver, he did the same to the first surviver but I quickly unhooked her and took the hit.
---
I wanted to include that somewhere so I made that the quote for possessed awareness
---
Is that David Beard actually in-game?
---
You cant leave with it on, was it counting down or not. You can leave through the hatch with it on and if you start a chase with the killer you can also leave through any exit.
---
I found someone in same boat üò≠
---
Unhooked his first surviver that's literally all I did * insert me shrugging *
---
Same I bought it last week
---
Its still good but healing with it takes forever so if you constantly heal in the corner with it every time you get hit you throw the game.
---
Weird, all the versions should have gotten the [2.7.0 patch](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61785/patch-notes-2-7-0-mid-chapter#latest) by now and it applied this change
---
&gt; RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. *NOTE: Initiating the End Game Collapse will not complete generators, but will block them. This means that any inactive RBTs will remain inactive.
---
Psychotic. Fitting, I guess.

So soon?

What about Subject Delta's little sister? If you choose the "Bad" ending your little sister (forgot her name, something with E tho) takes your conscience. This may had picked the entity's curiosity and offer her "unlimited ADAMS" from the survivors.
---
also, totally off topic, but where did you get your light(s)? they look rly cool
---
I only do it to check for noed
---
SKILL CHECKS BAD
---
My problem remains the same, why did the devs even let those challenges go live in the first place?
---
Nothing about NOED is bad, its a salt generator, kinda like most 2nd chance perks.
---

Killers camp and tunnel because they have to. They run ruin and noed because they have to, all because gens get done too fast for them to apply any kind of pressure. When you're chasing 1 survivor, there are 3 others doing gens. So tunneling and camping them out of a game is needed to make it so now only 2 survivors are on gens. But even still there are at least 10 things making sure that they don't go down. That's the problem and that's why I'll give any survivor main shit when they talk about "how hard playing survivor is" or how killers have it "easy". I camp and tunnel because ruin does nothing if you know how to hit "skill" checks or just press m1 over and over again. Noed can be destroyed before its even used so they can't even complain about running into that be it they have the power to make sure it never comes into play. I vouch for both sides. Spirit needs to be reworked just as Legion does (as much as I love the idea of them) and shit like getting hit through a downed pallet needs to be fixed. But at the same time with all the shit killers have to face, I can't say that survivors can complain when they are getting camped because 2 gens are left and the other 3 were done, before ruin was destroyed, and with in 5 minutes of the game having started. So yeah I will bitch all day about survivors because most of them are entitled shits that think you should respect the 4% luck that they get for humping off the hook, leave the hook when you hook someone, not go after someone you just hooked, used perks that made things SO much harder for them, or played in a way that they didn't find "fun". I'm not here for your fun, i'm the killer trying to stop YOU from escaping, and if you fail, then I guess I did my job....Untill the entity says that it's been fucking displeased.
---
Someone told me you still get the ripped shirt off you just buy the characters. Not true?
---
This is Zhuge Liang level of strategy right there
---
The most fun for me is the chases, and the mind games. Having a good chase and seeing who can outsmart who gives me such a thrill. What takes the fun out of the game for me is the annoying infinite loopers. If your strategy is to get a killers attention and just loop all game without doing anything else, then it just feels annoying to me. I've pretty much figured out that if I see blue or pink hair in the pregame lobby, then it's best to just avoid that survivor. 
---
I feel like I try my best to be a "fair" killer so far. If you just got unhooked I'll usually leave you alone. If you hit me with a good pallet stun, or evade me after a good chase I'll run off and find someone else. On the other hand, if a survivor is being annoying I will absolutely tunnel the shit out of them. If you flashlight, point, teabag, and then immediately run off to an impossible loop I will ignore every other survivor just for you. 
---
The original allure of this game to me back when it released was the cat and mouse games based on the horror movies I grew up watching.
---
yay challenges i guess
---
How much dodges did this produce?
---
Not the bundle, just the stranger things DLC.
---
Positive.
---
If its not on you dont die on any system
---
I suppose your right but still. It will be really interesting to see a Big Sister in game. Also, they do show Jack's face at the beginning of the first game.
---
Thats why im so confused. Cause in that game, it did happen. The game must have glitched, im sure of it
---
Shame on that Survivor just crouching there doing nothing instead of doing gens.
---
Damn alright thanks
---
I mean its possible but unlikely, if its on and beeping you cant leave, otherwise you can just walk out
---
Out of all these insane challenge comments,  yours is by far the most realistic insane one that can be lol
---
He streams on Sunday
---
Dude, I think you need to take a deep breath and step away from this game for a little while. I‚Äôm not mocking you, I‚Äôm not being mean, I‚Äôm being 100% serious.
---
I have read studies on how the killer role is incredibly stressful (and I play killer, I know it is, especially in high ranks), and how the multiple humiliation aspects of the game work wonders on someone‚Äôs head. 
---
I could go on how these are straw mans, vocal idiots that make a community or a ‚Äúside‚Äù look bad, but I‚Äôm not gonna. I‚Äôm not going to defend survivors or defend playstyles, killers, or the game. I‚Äôm defending you. Step the fuck away from this game, for a little while. It gets frustrating, it is unfair, and it chips away at our patience and balance.
---
Open Handed increases the range at which you see auras, not the range at which aura reading is blocked

Yea I get it now thanks mate.
---
I got camped with SWF, but my friends are new and they didn't know how to deal with ruin. I was also running Kindred, so they can see the guy camping me. We only got 1 generator done and I warned my friend not to save me but he still ran in and got grabbed off the hook.

I wish you could at least cleanse infected objects with medkits.
---
Like, a channel that speeds up the infection getting off of the object x5 and using one charge per second 
---
At least medkits would have some use against her and it makes some sense
---
Thank you for correcting me though. I didnt know they patched that.

Oh god, my brain.

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;#Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;#We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;# If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
I watched this video of Scott too and I don't agree with everything from it. Sure some things are broken, but still when you DC everybody is cucked. Suicide on hook while not perfect still gives killer stacks but also does waste a bit more of killer's time than immediate DC.
---
But even aside from that I can't shake the feeling that people who leave match early in most cases are just being pussies. From people who DC on first down against perk less Legion to matches that survivors team were eventually winning against Iri Infantry Huntress when giving their best instead of giving up.
---
What's the point of playing survivor/killer in a horror game when you're afraid of challenges?
---
Though I'd assume people might DC less if the pacing of DbD was more even. As it stands now against 4 survivors killer is in a huge disadvantage and it's almost impossible to escape both if there are only two left alive. The game itself doesn't really account amount of survivors left in it's pacing apart from the hatch thing, but it's rooted deeply and I doubt it will really change.
---

Self caring against sloppy - half a gen
---
I was playing against an Ash today who just kept jumping into lockers. I'm not sure he was even actually doing anything else.
---
People running it struggle, cuz they are used to staying healthy at all time.
---
How did you get the extra shards?
---
Call me a cynic, or salty, but like, these are not challenges, they are a intentional slog and grind disguised as challenges designed to pressure you into shilling out for a season pass to feel like your getting anything worthwhile from the rift. They are designed as nothing more then a grind to keep people playing the game, Tier one was to draw us in, make us feel committed to it, but past that, they exist to pad out, to grind, to force as much engagement with the game through as minimal and monotonous elements as possible.
---
Scratch that, yes im Salty, i don't like feeling like the Lore, the thing im interested in, is being held ransom by what amounts to Sandbagging or Sabtotaging yourself for a challenge, praying some act of god happens to let you do a challenge, or having to slam your face against a random wall in the rift because they gate everything behind a 'do X task 30 times, no you cant active your other challenges, get your honing stone and start that grind'.
---
That... may have been me. I decided to play while drunk.
---
Thank you-(every survivor who has felt with someone like this)
---
I've posted the same joke lol. It's still really funny!
---
*Brazzers Logo*
---
Killers at least need to hook once in order for a Mori to work the key can be used by a survivor that did dick-diddly all game or got his teammates killed with shitty hook saves. Keep that in mind!
---
Before I hit devotion1 I got rewarded 74s and 95s and I‚Äôm now stuck with it
---
As well as loading into custom games alone.
---
I was hoping something will happen and that's the reason why I didn't done the 15 emblem Challange and only done the upper part for Killer.
---
But 2 people in basement doesn't require camping, but yes, it's easier to do it and maybe they should change something about it. But it's kinda sad, because it's challenging in some way to do it without camping, but it's not fair otherwise in red ranks with good survivors
---
To be honest that depends on the Killer...
---
Stealth Killers who have a quite easy time getting a first hit anyway, or simply Killers who thrive on keeping Survivors injured like Plague or Legion, will not even need Redrum in the first place.
---
But you're definetly right in a certain regard, Enduring and Spirit Fury is just unfun to play against.
---
I don't think they will drastically change it tho. But maybe it will at least a lil bit more manageable
---
I love when the 8 yo kid ragequits, it makes me laugh.
---
I wonder why this community gets a bad rap for being toxic and shitty, then I see comments like this. 
---
I don‚Äôt disagree that survivors teabagging is annoying but it has zero effect on the actual gameplay the way that camping does. Camping literally keeps a survivor from playing a match. The end game collapse is your answer to teabagging. It‚Äôs been fixed for killers. Face-camping has not been addressed and the BP idea would have ZERO effect on the killer‚Äôs experience. So just stop.
---
If you have the ability to find the unhooker then take it but if they‚Äôre blending in and you‚Äôve got no other option then yeah tunneling is the way to go.
---
BALANCE KEYS. Like how stupid are you? The majority of your games do survivors really use keys? Because I have probably 500+ hours and I can tell you that not even 20% of my games people have had keys.
---
Literally me whenever I queue for killer ):
---
Points in Survival category lol
---
So is it trappers, or the entity?
---
about time.
---
Yeah, I was like.. wow everyone will farm me when I play survivor and because everyone will start with this, I will need 100 matches.
---
So I've done the upper killer part first and now start the survivor quests from the last to the first
---
I‚Äôve had 0 before
---
nah i love it when i see players with this name, its literally just a sign saying "Im garbage at the game! come kill me!"
---
i dont think i have ever ran into a good player with those names, unless they are super creative
---
To make it good, you should run it with a medkit. If you run a medkit, bring something else than selfcare because it will be enough to do the job.
---
Also, Inner Strenght exists and is better, especially against sloppy butcher.
---
Literally impossible though. But I don't think Behavior would be smart enough to realize it though
---
Tfw I spent 2 days grinding every challenge just to notice that the devs are making it easyer &lt;.&lt;
---
Low on hatches, must go pick up more
---
No, its any in your terror radius that aren't regressing

Oh that was for sure the entity was displeased my cooldowns increased by 24 hrs

Possesswd Awareness + Huntress Lullaby + Overcharge
---
Redrum + Enduring + Spirit Fury
---
*What have you done*
---
That's the joke.
---
Depends on what you play more. I don't like playing as killer, so I see buying killers as a waste of money.
---
They've said they're re-working some of the challenges. I wouldn't hold your breath though; it's most likely the 4-EGC and 4-NOED ones from chapter 4.
---
Is this mobile?!

Cries in Quentin main.

The stand still mindgame is an inherent part of her kit. It is even acknowledged in her loading screen tips.

Yes add more counterplay to already mediocre killer! Seems fun
---
I HAD AN IDEA FOR A LEGION REWORK, NOT SURE IF ITS ANY GOOD.
---
BASICALLY WHEN YOU START A GAME 3 NPC LEGION MEMBERS SPAWN RANDOMLY AROUND THE MAP AND PATROL AN 8X8M AREA.
---
YOU CAN LOOK AT A LEGION MEMBER FROM A DISTANCE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEM. AN NPC LEGION IS SPAWNED WHERE YOU WERE STANDING.
---
LEGION MEMBERS CANT GO WITHIN ~20M OF EACH OTHER.
---
I personally love strider. Good pair of headphones and you're set.
---
But there are no such challenges the "do in 1 game" should be hard but some of them are a bit stupid but the ones like "sacrifice 40 survivors/kicking gens also count"
---
ghostface doesn't use the same animation set as trapper. last time a non-trapper killer tried to do that, trying to pick up a trap would crash the client.
---
That said I feel like they must have some kind of safety in place by now just in case someone did try to do that.

---
I love browsing r/deadbydaylight because my name on Twitch has Mori in it so I feel famous because it's said so much here :)
---
now this one would be interesting. Only because of the fact that it would mean they implemented a teabagging detection and could use it for other things...
---
Funnily enough, that challenge actually *discourages* camping, as they have to hook you more than once, so it's clear that the devs are actually putting a degree of thought into these. It's simply human nature to min/max the challenges they're presented with that causes killers to hard-tunnel you, in reality a killer could kill everyone *but* the Obsession and actually still beat the challenge.
---
Yeah, if there's something Plague doesn't have enough of, it's ways to completely deny her power.
---
Oh hi Jane

For real, I‚Äôve seen plenty of racist and hitler related usernames. Bring on the Hex: HavingFun names

The 15 emblem one is broken aswell, I had a game couple of games with 3 ire emblems but only 1 of them counted for the challenge

More like "give a use to the 15000 bloodpoints you took into the match that have no use cuz you happened to land on the least played killer"
---
It's nothing that would murder Plague by any means.
---
It does nothing to you when you're infected, when most people stay infected

it just lets you use your god damn medkit to start working on the gen in 5 seconds instead of 25 if you haven't been infected yet

---
I get what u mean, I also have every survivor perk obtainable what as a survivor, you're too dependent on other teammates.
---
&gt;Instead of "GG, great build!" it's now "Crutch perk, kill yourself." 
---
100% this. Weirdly enough, I never run into any of this myself, but I do see it all the time on the sub. I play killer (purp-red) and survivor (green-purp) in NA NE, maybe that's the secret?
---
I get your sentiment, above, absolutely. I get the first section about people presumably labeling you for your chosen playstyle. I just kinda lost you on the second part where you say things like not wanting to bring Franklin's. You don't have to do any of that stuff. You can play however you want, and it's still a fun game. Literally the *only* thing you can't control is the pre/post-game chat. At least with the post-game chat, there's actually a way to disable it by default! It's currently not implemented in the menu, however, so you have to edit a file, but you can look up online how.
---
Until some HUGE sweeping movement takes hold, I seriously doubt the community will change. Ask some of the psychologists on here. There are fundamental reasons the community ended up where it is. The spirit of the game has probably changed as well. The game has matured. The meta has entrenched itself. It's not the community's fault, even. People are people. The Devs are the only guiding hand, and even they are people and can't be expected to account for literally everything, not that they couldn't have done better. It just is what it is.
---
DBD is still practically state of the art in asymmetric success. BHVR isn't good at it yet, at all, but they're doing better than anyone else. It's highly experimental, and negative experiences are bound to happen. It's not surprising the game settled into a bad place. Best advise I can give is to hold out for tomorrow. Perhaps BHVR will get it's shit together. Or, much more likely, a proper AAA game dev will learn from BHVR's mistakes and create something that blows DBD out of the water. Until then, try to enjoy this one-of-a-kind roller coaster. It's truly a gem.
---
Hope to run into you in the Fog, m8.
---
God I hope this is real.
---
I only own the other survivors to unlock their teachables and just because I‚Äôm a big completionist. I literally only play as Dwight because I have all perks on him.
---
URGGGGH I FEEL GOOD
---
They're coming with the next chapter afaik.
---
There was also an idea to make injured sounds more vague (or even omnipresent) when you're phasing.
---
I dunno tho, I suck at Spirit. Gimme Wraith and Trapper lol.
---
Faced a lot of nonsense during my first 500+ hours gameplay. One of which is starting the game with 2 survivors vs 1 killer. At this point, it just goes into autopilot if anything happens and I don't take anything personally.
---
Except for the aura reveals each time you hook someone which shows gens that are being worked on by survivors
---
Oh alright thanks
---
pizza time
---
but your still at normal speed until you charge which is only a limited time AND it has to be charged up tobefore hand, giving survivors plently of time to just get out of the way., you can't insta-destroy pallets that fall on you, your speed is not increased (as far as im aware, you still are at your normal speed) sure you can down multiple survivors at once, however your LOUD really loud and its not like myers teir 3 that can be activated during a chase, you have to stand still!
---
so yes, its a weaker billy saw, who can run at nascar speed over and over and over
---
I hope you‚Äôre right. Flashlight saves are the only thing I‚Äôve never been able to master. It‚Äôs my shame, and I won‚Äôt be able to finish the Archives if I don‚Äôt get this ü•∫

It needs to be buffed so it just gives a permanent tier one bloodlust as well as the exposed effect

---
Makes me giggle when I hear people complain about games getting cancelled like no u don't want the old system.
---
Dedicated servers just need a bit more tweaking and then this game is on its way to become even more balanced
---
NOED EGC isn't hard if you slug ,open the door by yourself and then hook the both slugged
---
Run it all the time then.
---
Whenever I slapped Balanced Landing on, it was Shelter Woods, until I just refused to switch it back
---
Tbh I'm disappointed that they're changing tome 3. Tome 4 needed adjustment imo but tome 3 was fine how it was. (This quest took me 3 tries)
---
Aviable in some countries, can avoid it by changing region (on Android rly hard), or download from Tap Tap
---
The times where that poor killer has to let the 2 survivors get their bloodpoints instead of slaughtering them (except for those sadistic killers)  
---
Even as a killer myself, I would feel bad for them starting 2v1
---
I really like the game but I wish it felt more like a horror game. After awhile it feels like you stop being scared and just go into loop mode when you get chased. I miss the fear of having the killer chasing me :(
---
Oh shit, I forgot. Too used to seeing the 32m and asserting it to the terror radius. Mb
---
I only read the Title and have to say: No. I buyed the most, but not all. Killers are unique and if you want the full Dead by Daylight experience You need to buy them, survivors not
---
I felt bad for a few times then got annoyed bc how many good add-ons I wasted to this fucking problem
---
Gen protector freddy did it for me
---
You need to take a chill pill. It's only a video game. Life isn't going anywhere just because there's a few survivors playing with their friends and spamming the crouch button.
---

I'm the fun police just because I dislike Hex: \_\_\_\_ names? I'm just saying its just become a dead meme at this point and has derailed to be just a format that makes literally no sense.
---
There isn't really, I'm just saying it isn't very creative or funny up at this point.
---
And still if they didn't see issue with time they would not change s thing ;)
---
Also if you have to resort to insults to prove a points shows both lack of IQ and valid argument..., again you are so salty and buthurt about it like you have a stake in it...
---
If you have to be grammar Nazi to prove a point you are grasping at straws...., kind of pathetic . ., and not everyone is from or had English as a subject in School ;*
---
Hell yes! I always thought so! It will drastically change the game, but really wonder how colorful the game will become. All these characters and abilities to choose from.
---
Like 7 P3 claudetes per match is something new...
---
Hahaha :D What a genius, honestly. SURELY noone came up with that before him. All the others who use this build are the mere plebs or his faithful students, who use the technologies, invented by the greatest killer in EU.
---
I agree. The moment I spawn I want the survivors to be automatically be injured.
---
Now this makes me want to be in a horror movie ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Well my dear Entity, maybe if you actually gave me BBQ after 50 Bloodwebs and didn't steal good perks from me I wouldn't have to do it!
---
Love it
---
I was your 69th upvote
---
No. There are some differences to survivors, mainly the noise they make (thats why I only play Ace)  but thats just about it. I heard someone saying that there's also a height difference but I can't confirm. I really wish each survivor were more unique. Nothing huge but like: meg is a runner, give her 1% more speed, feng is all about mechanics stuff, so give her some repair buff, etc.. nothing huge but you know.. would fresh the game up a little bit. Maybe even give some debuff such as: Bill is old, so he's a bit slower. Its a shitty idea for dbd, but it would be fun idk
---
*It sucks so much fucking suck it fucks!*
---
It would be imbalance
---
This makes no sense title is trapper supposedly saying something then the meme is about the entity, what???
---
Yeah it always baffles me when I play as Myers players tea bagging not realising that I'm drinking in that evil juice ready for super speed and super lunge!!
---
Nope. If you go into their lore/details screen, you'll see their three teachables and the current status of each teachable. If it's ticked off then you'll see it in Bloodwebs no matter what happens.
---
I know, I know.... may have gone a bit out there... I just want this game to suceed...
---
Release a new chapter without breaking anything.

I hope they will not nerf him. I think he is fun to play and I love how his power is charged with the blood. I don't know if he is weaker than Billy, but he seems easier to play.. I struggle with 99  the chainsaw, hold it and then aiming right when the survivor trys to 180/360
---
# ‚ÄúLegion found the nerf stick‚Äù
---
-BHVR, probably.
---
Yeah - it's hard to tell if a killer will give you a sporting chance at an unhook or if it's gonna be an Insidious "first hook, death hook" match.
---
Sometimes the more blatant you are about leaving the hook, the more paranoid you make the survivors!
---
I hate this quest.. I don't want to waste my items when I don't want to use them

Honestly if green key had built-in aura reading and had charges for like 25-30 secounds it would be at least somehow useful. Because finding it in a chest without nuts sucks nuts

I would think that BHVR has  learned from freddy's crushing nerf, i only think there are some things to improve with his power, being unable to have a power until you gather enough blood from survivors we will have to see what happens

I don't have the problem when playing solo, but as soon as I play with my girlfriend it's crazy. Tons of connection errors and tons of Killer lobby dodged.
---
finally a reason to use all these keys
---
I guess English is their second language so verbosity is quite common. For example, the meaning of the word 'increase' and 'decrease' is altered within many perk add-ons. 
---
For example, Trapper Gloves, Trapper: *"Slightly increases the Bear Trap setting speed"*. Really, this is decreasing the time it takes to set the trap. 
---
Meanwhile, Spark Plug, Hillbilly: "*Slightly decreases the Chainsaw Charge time."* This one makes more sense.
---
Little things like this can make many add-ons really confusing.
---
So then trapper op bc u walk around the map more to collect traps?

There are more mature ways of expressing your thoughts.
---
I can take jokes, even the dark ones, but yours points to one, specific person who really wanted to make something we'll love and just happened to drop the ball and is about their death. It's just not very nice.
---
I'd add /s instead of "xD" to make the joke part clearer
---
Exactly
---
*This Killer is a* **DOODY HEAD.**
---
I knew it
---
If a survivor teabags consecutively for 5 or more times while in a chase, get bloodlust 3 instantly, along with 15% pallet breaking/window vaulting speed?
---
Must be done in a single patch.
---
I love it when I run from window to pallet to Windows, just a few loops (not infinite shit or something similar) and the Killer gives up because I have a good run.
---
It's a few months ago since my last run that went like this :/
---
i just use it to tell people i'm sad and also bad at video games so they know what to expect
---
Sorry to break it to you but if you reach bloodlust 3 you must be doing something wrong
---
I don't I'm joking about the killers who do
---
I've not been here long I dont know what "/s" means, I'll keep that in mind for the future.
---
Heal 5 different survivors in a single trial
---
Just say you got a daily to perform a mori
---
It's no error and has been confirmed in a multitude of YouTube videos. The problem with the shards lighting up is that you can only really notice it when standing right in front of her which in a normal game would mean you're already dead.
---
thank you so much!
---
thank you :)
---
Im happy you like it, thank you! &lt;3
---
no i mean the nerf they gave him during his first week in the PTB, the nerf that made him a joke before his rework that made him not a laughing stock
---
What is it with P3 Claudettes and being absolutely fucking useless?
---
BHVR has said they will be fixing this
---
Dedicated servers are way better than killers hosting, despite the flaws it can have. I play on both ps4 and pc, ping difference is enormous and killers dodging lobbies is no joke after waiting so long to get a lobby.
---
Oh it's a known issue? Ok then, that's not as big of an issue to me. They'll fix it. Thanks!
---
I haven‚Äôt encountered any issues so far on that front but perhaps in later tomes they‚Äôve developed. I‚Äôm working through Tome II currently, a challenge like that would suck completely when it doesn‚Äôt work considering how much effort gets put into accomplishing ones like that.
---
They should address the issue immediately
---
1. As a someone who plays survivor more, noed sure is annoying but all I have to do is equip it, stall the game and make sure 2 people live until the end where you finish them off
---
2. It‚Äôs annoying for survivors to get to the basement every match but 15 isn‚Äôt a high number to get. I got 7 in my two first matches going for it so it only took me 3 games to
---
finish without even having to farm. 
---
3. Pretty sure misstiming it would still work, if not then it‚Äôs too hard for unexperienced players
---
If this fella can be the poster child against toxicity in the community, I'd hope this might turn people's minds around about treating people like shit over a simple game.
---
I feel like they should at least let us equip several challenges at one time. The 15 unhook challenge wasn‚Äôt hard it‚Äôs just annoying that they‚Äôre sort of encouraging selfish gameplay that would cause survivors to not do gens at all and just hide around chases. I know I did that. Lol had too many games where I would get zero hooks so I was kind of forced to change my entire playstyle just to get through it.
---
Dude, just give it up. Quit bitching that survivors are escaping you because they earned the hatch spawn. My god, you're a fucking child.
---
That is a thing, it's just hard to notice unless you're right on her
---
You should honestly just stop playing the game. It's obvious that you suck at being a killer and are blaming every game mechanic for your shortcomings.
---
Yeah its quite common because it allows you to do a lot and negate the killer's pressure
---
I usually do the myers scratched mirror with whispers, monitor and abuse, and an offering to go to lery‚Äôs. Just in case the wraith doesn‚Äôt work too well.
---
Wait. F*cking what? That's a thing?!
---
What's it look like i did not read that under what i get if i buy from steam.
---
I've seen tome 4 and think they're all doable within reasonable time so I disagree that tome 4 needs adjustment. But congrats on the challenge.
---
I had to use the offering that created two more chests and my team still searched almost every chest in the map. I was lucky enough to find my third chest right at the very end of the match. The challenges where it is entirely luck based are so frustrating. I much prefer the grind based tasks over the single trial tasks since they at least have a finite amount of matches you play till you eventually finish them if you are capable.
---
How did you do this? I wonder if you could let us know a step by step guide on how to get soooo good?
---
You have to be right next to her right as she starts phasing (I'm serious, you have to be almost touching her) and it only happens briefly AND it is apparently bugged to not happen on some cosmetics.
---
It's the default shirt but with a slight claw mark. You miss out on nothing
---
It's pretty quick to just press "home&gt;start&gt;X&gt;X". You can smash that out in like, literally a second.
---
Why do Claudettes always fail a skill check and then their the first one to run away leaving the team to die and then the last one to be seen saving the someone from a hook. Claudettes whenever they hear a heart beat Ight Ima osmosis.
---
The dude is proud of himself. Saying that it's easy with Demo and indirectly that he is proud of something he shouldn't be is a bit of dick move.
---
I literally hate this

No, no Claudette, don‚Äôt go through that doorway, there‚Äôs swinging paint cans!
---
Ace, get out of the way, that‚Äôs a fucking iron about to drop on your head!
---
Everyone is fucking dead!
---
Honestly i hated this challenge so much, it was such a drag for the first challenge. I finally got it done last night and had a mini celebration.
---
Nah, the entity enjoys this stuff. Garm with the survs and you get max points and a pip.
---
Murder them in cold blood early and you get a down pip because...reasons
---
^Nice
---
Do you like farming other people?
---
Noice
---
He looks good, but that last perk seems rather pointless when we have perks like iron will already. 
---
So the second perk places a decoy for the killer to see? If the killer doesn't have BBQ and chili or nurses calling, then won't they know not to go after the obvious decoy?
---
Wow that's great love the hand

---
SO THIS GUY FACECAMPS ME THEN TELLS ME HE CAN DO IT COZ WE ARE GEN RUSHING .
---
CAN SOMEONE WITH THE MINDSET OF A KILLER TELL ME
---
1- WHY IS THERE COMPLAINTS AGAINST
---
GEN RUSHING AS IF IT IS TEABAGGING OR MOCKING THE KILLER ? ISNT IT THE ONLY OPTION FOR SURVIVORS TO SURVIVE ? 
---
2- HOW IS IT COMPARABLE TO FACE CAMPING FFS ?  WHILE DOING THE GENS, EVERYONE INCLUDING THE KILLER IS PLAYING THE GAME AS OPPOSED TO TIMES KILLER FACECAMPS WHERE THE ONE ON THE HOOK AND THE KILLER ITSELF IS LITERALLY INACTIVE.
---
There‚Äôs another challenge that requires you to kill the Obsession by any means about 7 times. They‚Äôre probably referring to that.
---
That'd be great, the killer could boobytrap lockers, lmao
---
Sloppy butcher + that one pink add-on that lets you see blood...they literally cant hide from you no matter what
---
The single trial double entendre got me hard.
---
when he started to move and put his hands up, I legit thought he was starting to dance and I was REALLY confused
---
I get all survivors to then put all their perks on Kate Denson because she has been the chosen one. It would have been Feng Min but I hadn't yet realized that prestiging them was worthless (outside of cosmetic)  so she was further behind. 
---
I do not play killer as much but I still have all of them, mainly because most came released with a surv at the same time. 
---
Do I think everyone should do this? Nah, it's just whatever your preference is. I know some people won't bother with perks they think aren't great.
---
Thought it was Meg face until I looked at it closely lol
---
By the wording and the title I think it has to be a save
---
This I can partly agree with, but it's so much worse when you see someone with .tv or whatever in their name and know they're a twitcher. I have never once encountered a good twitcher, let alone an altruistic one.

I has that problem too. I think you had to be actively chased, not stealth stun.
---
What about Otz
---
Yeah I love how the priority has clearly not been set by rarity, and the absolute junk offerings that burn 6000 hard earned points will never be touched while something of value can still be taken.
---
Oh no... I forgot about him. Well, I guess he's the best thing to ever hit this community. idk, I'm still somewhat stuck in late 2018 to early 2019, before Otz's big blowup. Sorry.

Many are broken. I had the emblem one in level 2 when you had to collect gold quality or better. I had a game with 3 iri and 1 silver and it counted the iri twice. Then another when I got 1 iri and the rest silver/bronze and it gave me nothing.

Happened to me two days ago. Fortunately, it was EGC and I was already pretty much out so it didn‚Äôt change anything.

Pretty cool tho

Bring world peace. Must be done until December 1st.

I hover over rank 5 and 3 usually before rank reset takes place (i do often get paired against rank 1 people before you say my ranks are low). Loadouts include Ruin,STBFL,Stridor,Pop,Sloppy,Haunted,Devour (obviously not all at the same time, i change em every game), as for addons i use anything that makes me go into phase faster and i either pair it with a second phase addon, the amulet or one of the addons that increases post-phase speed (those trully deny any sort of counterplay since you can phase for 1 second and then pop out and omega-lunge a survivor to the ground, but even when they take that away these addons are just lethal). Yes you can say these are overkill, but really i wouldn't be saying i get easy 3 and 4ks without factoring in that a good team on a less than favorable map for me (Haddonfield, Coldwind, Yamaoka) would make me struggle to get above 2k without playing scummy with those addons included.
---
Please don't
---
To be fair, the first 20 hours was scary af for me
---
How sweet
---
ngl this is the worst possible way to cry for help, like a child who's been on the internet too much. is this supposed to resonate with someone like "wow he's got hangman's noose and is just huggin' up on the hooks, that's so deep" dumb as all sin
---
now that's a lotta bloodpoints
---
You haven't played hearthstone have you?
---
&gt;go for grab
---
&gt;plays the animation

&gt;glitches, freezes, does a normal attack

&gt;doesn't even hit the survivor

That takes a slot

Lmao ok, I am not the best player and some days I'm an a total piece of shit but idk why I keep playing, a game I was actual a Kate and was blind as fuck and stepped in so many traps that I could have a second vagina
---
I'm calling de cops.
---
Yeah he's so toxic for playing the game
---
*Noed instadown
---
I do not understand how this is lag abuse, or even what lag abuse is? Seems more like something killer couldn't control, especially if he commented negatively against it in postgame chat. 
---
Still not an excuse to face camp, though.
---
I saw a clip once where an oni missed a hit in a haddonfield house and particles fell from the ceiling, like he shook the house so bad the roof started breaking. Those could just happen normally though and it was just good timing.
---
He‚Äôs just as confused as you
---
As a killer main, I can feel the pain
---
I believe it'll see more use once the patch hits, but I feel glad you didn't have to experience the headache that was the MoM Meta Crisis
---
He doesnt need a nerf. He isnt the strongest killer in the game, he just doesnt take as much skill as the other stronger killers. Hes strong, dont get me wrong, but not nerf-worthy.
---
I guess it‚Äôs not about a penalty for the camper. It‚Äôs more a compensatory for the survivor getting Bubbad and camped for 2 minutes. 
---
And the Dc-Bloodpoints are unearned as well by that logic, still we get them.
---
Well, when the gates are open, I'm getting the fuck out too.
---
Oh no those challenges are just the same as the other single trial challenges but on steroids
---
Who see the hehe boyy faceüòÇ
---
Shit game can‚Äôt even get hatchets while I get bill huntress bad someone buff pls iridescent head as standard
---
I wouldn't even mind getting a match like that every now and then if it wasn't such salt in the wound of having to queue up for an eternity
---
TTY GOOD-
---
That‚Äôs a new killer perk.
---
And they'd still be kore powerful than Fredddy, so that doesnt help your case. There is zero reason to nerf Freddy. He is not the strongest killer in the game, just the strongest of his learning curve. You will not escape against a God nurse or God spirit even post-nerf unless all 4 of the survivors make 0 mistakes, and even then you sometimes wont. However, you dont need 4 perfect survivors to escape against a God Freddy
---
&gt; it would be best that he could only attack survivors in the sleep state.
---
*rework Freddy PTSD intensifies*
---
Ofc I will stop. Right after Devs will finally do anything about keys. They must have any viable counterplay or at least require more than press m1 to escape. 
---
Currently, the only "way" to counterplay keys is to bring franklin. But if survivors run that perk for chests, this becomes useless.
---
cock and ball torture
---
Are we just going to gloss over why you prepped Better Together instead of Spine Chill there.
---
Forgot about that one
---
Killer main here. When I hit you because someone was dumb enough to unhook you right next to me, and you don't fall down. I will turn to see if the guy who unhooked you is still here. If he is a mile away already. Guess what glowing POS is getting hit again because they are still closer than any other survivor on the map? Inb4 the screams of "camping" and "tunneling" ensues other than blaming the literal teammate who did you the dirty in the first place. Oh sorry, he was in the right because he had "Borrowed Time".
---
That's dwight? I coulda swore that was Quentin lol

In the next patch u will get a punishment from dc:ing

* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
For me it just stops being scary after a while and more annoying, like "Oh of course she trapped this gen"
---
so a legion 2.0 but worse that would be fucking aids
---
Agreed. I still turn on his stream in evenings because he is so informational and well spoken. Just sucks that he has to have this mentality of 4k or lose.
---
They were never gonna nerf her in any significant way. They dumped 30k to make the bitch, they aren't gonna flush that down the drain only because people complained on reddit. It would take massive negative feedback in-game in order for the devs to take some radical steps as a rework. Like survivors literally throwing the match immediately every time they face a spirit. And even then it would take two full years for bhvr to even take notice. I don't see that happening, especially with the upcoming dc penalties.
---
The collision removal and vault animation are ok changes, but mostly unsubstantial. Collision only helped players who failed the only requirement to play her (i.e. plug in your headphones). The vault is a little better, but still affects only some marginal situations and using her power is more reliable anyway than trying to vault juke.
---
Some of the add-ons reworks are interesting, but I need to see more in action to get a better idea. Especially the post-phase add-ons seem to be still sketchy. I know they reworked those so that she behaves more like the wraith's post-uncloak speed boost, but it still sounds like bs, because bing-bong boy slows down while uncloaking before receiving the boost, while she goes straight from phase to de-phase.
---
She's just a poorly designed character from a gameplay standpoint. She needs an intelligent rework, possibly not another legion 2.0 fiasco.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting common/well-known bugs and glitches in the game. Please use our weekly smile sunday threads for this type of submission.

Like a vacuum cleaner noise when she's phasing far from you? Or a static killer when near?
---
Sorry but David is out there looking like a five course meal.
---
He's toxic for the way be plays the game, yes.
---
You know, I miss old Freddy. They could've just only changed his timer dragging Survivors into dream world for 4-5s instead of 7s. Because 7 seconds were enough to wake up from interaction and failing skill checks. Let alone having some add-on full rework.
---
Otherwise let Freddy force everyone start in one stage. Either in Dream World or awake but Survivors would still be dreaming like it's all fake. Besides being like this Freddy's add-ons would only affect on interactions. (Having two stages for Freddy Krueger seems to be overkill... at least actually optimize this bull because it's really gonna affect your gameplay pretty badly for freezing half a second)
---
That's impossible, it only teleports if its way is blocked or if you take a perk (then it teleports to the other remaining perk.

This is a great idea can't help who face camps you especially for just being good at looping and the killer finally catches you like yea bitch ready to get camped like ah fuck
---
yes bc nobody wants to fucking play nurse bc she is boring as fuck he is the most favored killer that isnt broken to all hell
---
the nurse nerf did fuck all to people that already know how to play her I can imagine the only annoying part of this to new nurse players is they cant spam blinks fast enough which is more of a balance fix than a nerf imo
---
To be fair, on legion mori he stabs three times: once in the arm, once on the feet and once on the chest.
---
The first two are normal stabs, and the survivor just feels pain. The third one is a long cut that probably can hit some vital organs, so being capable of killing.
---
At least you‚Äôll get a lot of use out of empathy
---
JOB SO FA-
---
A L W A Y S
---
Inaccurate, needs 3 tbagging survivors in the exit gate.
---
For many people (majority of them?) getting no rewards for the game is simply less fun.
---
Other than the gameplay itself, the part that gives the most fun is getting to progress your characters, unlock new perks, do prestige and much more.
---
If you want to make 4fun lobbies, your best bet is to go to customs. The gamemode you described would most likely be identical to normal lobby, but  nearly nobody would play it due to getting no rewards for that.
---
Drop DS
---
Before the rework I hated playing as him, but I've been coming back tohim more and more recently and I actually love a lot his kit. I tried a bit the pallet but I really like the snares more.
---
And the ability to teleport or fake teleport to the gen is awesome and can make for some really fun plays !
---
All you've done is bitch about keys
---
just use BT and voilaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Every time a killer drops me a few feet from the hatch instead of directly on it I‚Äôll just stare at them and won‚Äôt move toward it at all

Better yet when you‚Äôre chillin on a hook and Dwight doesn‚Äôt crouch to you just sprints in like hey I‚Äôm here to rescue you NO YOU AINT.
---
oh fuck oh shit
---
What are your page 2 perks
---
What's your horror movie approach when people pallet loop you?
---
With the new patch with the new DC they are introducing lobby/matchmaking penalties that will punish repeat offenders from leaving the current game. Its supposed to entice the players to stay in the game because otherwise you have to wait a while to get back to a lobby
---
I did that by going blendette
---
This game is so ridiculously tilted in favor of survivors that most players have to use the same couple of killers. It‚Äôs balanced for casuals so higher rank survivors have endless escape mechanisms and easy time with gens. Hex totems fall in the first minute of every match so those perks are useless.
---
Its slippery meat
---
But... Why?
---
I was doing the heal health states challenge and got 4 plagues in a row, then a legion, and then a an other plague. I took a break after that.
---
Your current perks are ok,maybe you could replace empathy with we'll make it
---
If you buy the chapter in-game (which requires you to buy each character individually without going to the store your client uses) it comes out roughly to $15, if you buy the chapter, which includes all 3 with 2 extra cosmetics, it's $11.
---
Leatherface first for bbq. Best way to earn bloodpoints
---
Already did, dumbass. Survivors ha e to complete gens to even get the hatch to spawn. Meaning they have to earn the ability to even use the key. If you don't want them to use the key, you have a perk, Franklin's demise, to get rid of the keys.  It you don't want to have to waste a perk slot to counter keys, Instead you sit around bitching about how survivors are outplaying you. Learn to get good at the game and stop blaming game mechanics for your lack of skills, scrub.
---
I'm never dropped from the game itself. 
---
The lobby needs work with all of its "errors" and syncing with together with friends and keeping those friends together when paired with the killer. The only times I have been dropped from the game is when the host's connection is so bad that I'll get dropped.... Which looks like I raged out
---
Honestly I still get spooked sometimes in a good chase, especially by the pig. The game still has some horror aspects but you can only be so scared once you got like 50+ hours on the game you just get used to it
---

They released the statistics like, a few days ago. All killers have an above 50% kill rate (except Nurse, who's EXTREMELY hard to use). In rank 1 specifically, Clown is the lowest killrate killer and he STILL has a 60% kill rate, so "killers being weaker in high ranks" is a lie.
---
Game is killer sided.
---
The teabaggers in the exit gate are missing though
---
U mustve gotten in a lobby with a hacker they always make me prestige 10 and give me all the gun progression
---
Freddy is a beast
---
Keys really need better functionality. Right now they feel like shittier maps.
---
HEHE BOI
---
As I killer main I agree. It's too hard for a killer to comunicate when he wants to farm along with survivors, even more in low ranks.
---
WHAT THE FUCK DID THE UPDATE DO TO PS4 CONNECTIVITY??? I CONSTANTLY CANT CONNECT TO YOUR *DEDICATED* SERVERS AND AFTER MATCHES IT ALWAYS SAYS "CONNECTION ERROR OCCURED" FIX YO SHIT BHVR PLS I LOVE YOUR GAME!!!
---
How do you expect any kind of experience to remain scary after you've done it a hundred times? That's not a problem with DBD, that's just what happens when you become familiar with something- it gets to be fairly routine. Unless you expect BHVR to basically re-make the game from the ground up every six months that's not a fair complaint.
---
its why I love stealth killers. sure, I might shit my pants but I had fun
---
It's leatherface
---
Don't use self care, grab a med kit instead
---
Im waiting for cursed legacy legion.
---
Its just gonna be like them old times, just without moonwalking.
---
Don't use balanced landing getting nerfed Soon!
---
So what should I use
---
Ah, I don't mean sliding - rather, just playing chicken around a loop until you get close enough to pallet stun, then moving to the next loop while you're stunned.
---
ya got clearly outplayed there
---
Please watch this video if you think it‚Äôs fine. 
---
https://youtu.be/eS7nn1B03YQ
---
Scratched mirror myers in indoor maps is probably the only instance of horror for experienced players. Thats the problem though, he's an outlier. Most killers need to have some way of being just as scary as that.
---
It seems like BHVR is somehow running out of ideas for killers when every new killer ability lately has just been a slight variation of an already existing power.
---
ANYTHING at ALL. During a chase there isnt any counter play in the slighest. Her mindgames are "lemme stand still" woo. And i get fucked for NOT KNOWING IF SHES GONE OR THERE, that is not fair in the fucking slighest.
---
I sid this but then let the Survivor escape through THE gate
---
He meant at top level play. Take a tournament level squad and put them against any killer besides the top 3 (with tournament level skill too ofc) and see what happens.
---
I bet that clown wouldnt have a 60% kill rate in that scenario lol he would be lucky to hit 25%

Spirit, Legion is low rank
---
Spirit&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Legion
---
Spirit best killer
---
Thanks for the advice!

Same principle, really. Even if they drop the pallet you can still hit them if you do it fast enough. Honestly I've never had any problem with loops that I couldn't figure out with just my wit. And I'm not bragging, by any means. I just get in a movie killer mindset and try to outwit the Survivors.
---
Spirit is Top Tier, Legion is Low tier
---
If you dont care for tiers, spirit ability is being invisible for a couple of seconds while you move around in the...spirit realms...(idk)
---
Legion is you stab people and put a mending timer on then, it also tells you where other people are if theyre close enough.
---
I have both and spirit is easy mode
---
I seriously doubt that interaction makes it out of PTB
---
I agree completely, but that's the nature of scary games. Eventually, you're just going to become desensitized to  it. That's not necessarily BHVR's problem, that's just human nature, and it's better for them to focus on the player base that's no longer scared of the game by making the game competitive than it is to try to focus on trying to make it scary again. Even if they make focus on trying to make it scary - for example, I had folks tell me constantly back when Demogorgon released that it was the most scared they'd been playing the game - eventually they'll just become desensitized again and we're back at square one.
---
It feels like BHVR just understands now that it's better to focus on the competitive aspect of the game, and if folks get scared by the new Killer(s) as a result, that's icing on the cake.
---
Getting a lot of people complaining about the fact im saying people to stop doing it, I wasn't being 100% serious and I'm not demanding everyone to change their usernames lol I just personally dislike them :/
---
Ok but I started like 2months ago so what  perks should I use for the new player probably spirit fury or whatever is it called
---
I got kicked out of a game because someone dc'd just as I started to hook them. *Yes they dc'd just as I started to hook them, which froze the killer, and the server disconnected as a response to it*.
---
Disconnecting messes up everything in this game x'D
---
"For casual". Casuals are majority. There is might as well be 66% of survivros that escape 33% of the times, and 33% that escape 66% of the times. There is no gradation, what is highest average escape rate a survivor can achieve, and how many survivors can do that (no graphs), so there is no way to know, how high is surviving rate among people that know, how to play. So basically 75% of red ranks might as well be bloated with survivors  boosted by their SWFs. That's why devs said to take stats info with a grain of salt.
---
Legion can obtain bloodpoints stupidly fast with Frenzy. (Brutality, Deviousness, and Hunter)
---
Spirit can get kills with headphones and practice.
---
DS and Head On works great too
---
T H E N U M B E R S M A S O N
---
She has Spirit Fury, Haunted Grounds and Rancor
---
Spirit Fury is usually used with Enduring to eat pallets and continue the chase
---
Haunted Grounds its useful if you're running other totem perks like devour or ruin
---
and Rancor is a Tracking perk with Noed and Green Mori installed into it
---
every game i see huntress or michel and for the claudette part i agree
---
Nancy for her perks and Steve for the swag
---
I always hated that about moris. Their flavor text gives the impression that the entity is ok with it and may even enjoy letting the killers ACTUALLY kill for once. Then its displeased at the end? lmao what?! If you didn't want it then why did you allow it, o mighty bipolar spider god?
---
Youth won‚Äôt get in lobbies with Asia.You can with super high ping, but they by far always take top place with most games. Even most popular on twitch some get 6k average viewers
---
The only scary killer is honestly Myers. :(
---
NoEd on huntress LULW
---
Yep.
---
Also reference to a meme posted here a week ago or so.
---
Lmfaoothe claudette face. I love this
---
Demogorgon was a good step in the right direction. Even though it wasn't COMPLETELY new and original, it still felt unique unlike Michael and Ghostface. I had high hopes after demo but I'm pretty disappointed with Oni and feel like they went a step back again.
---
When mom and dad are fighting in front of you and you just want to know what‚Äôs for dinner
---
i don't mind the grindy ones, its the ones that have to be done in a single trial that get me. like i suck at trapper. pls stop making me get 4+ traps in one game. thankfully if i put a trap down and step on it or stare at it in a survivors face they know what I'm saying and give me the traps, but i wish i didn't have to do it.
---
The thing about quick games is sometimes they're not worth it. You get less BP and almost always no increase in rank.
---
You're basically telling the killer: here I am, healing in the corner, injured, please down me.
---
Yeah but doing 15 gens or 25 unhooks is normal gameplay, just really boring and grindy. Not fun at all as you can‚Äôt stack challenges
---
Lack of skill. Boy, listen. If you are in the killer shack, put the pallet down and this bitch starts standing still, you will get utterly fucked. Cause she could fake it at first and then, OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE she stops faking it and since she saw where you were walking to, she gets a free hit. What a fun killer. Also i want to say one more thing
---
&gt;Using nerfs as a way to circunvent your lack of skill and/or creativity isn't a good idea. This will eventually ruin the fun for all parties envolved. Gaining skill and learning counterplay is necessary for any competitive game.
---
So by this logic, we should still have the old legion cause its the survivors fault for getting 28 stab wounds and getting downed literally instantly. Its the survivors fault for NOT HAVING COUNTERPLAY. What kind of logic is that. Some killers simply need nerfs to be balanced to fight. There is literally fuck all that you can do againts a spirit once she goes for this braindead "mindgame".
---
&gt;If she's fake phasing, she'll have to walk again to get me, or i'll increase the distance between us. If she's phasing for real, she'll lose me for lack of scratchmarks and grunts of pain (iron will best perk btw).
---
You need a perk to counter her, and even thats not completely foolproof counter. Thats the issue. Why are you defending a killer with no counter play whatsoever
---
&gt;If she's fake phasing, she'll have to walk again to get me
---
Nah she just stops faking it and actually phases btw.
---
&gt;she'll lose me for lack of scratchmarks and grunts of pain
---
You cant guarantee that. Killers arent idiots, they can guess what direction you are going to. Also if you step on grass, get fucked. Killers hear that.
---
i played spirit for all of my grabs and ayed around short pallet loops. you'd be amazed at the amount of times you just phase and stand still and grab them sliding the pallet towarss you
---
I'm not the guy, I'm the poster who posted the question on the guys phone
---
I know. Joking with you :-)
---
Trapper is Low Tier not because he's bad, but because the game does NOT let him be Trapper.
---
He takes too much time to set up, which means that Survivors pop gens, which means it's harder to rank up with him due to a horrible Gatekeeper emblem. It's like Plague, who is a pretty good killer but gets absolute dog crap for Hunter/Chaser points due to running into someone and downing them in one hit.
---
I hate how people claim that anything a survivor does is "toxic". Aaron nowadays runs with SWF and doesn't do anything not within the game's rules. If people are crying that much about going up against a flashlight squad, learn to counter it or quit the game. It's so pathetic calling everything toxic despite it being built into the game's mechanics.
---
Ruin is still powerful. Even if it gets cleansed in the first 30 seconds that's one survivor not working on gens
---
some licensed chapters prolly aren‚Äôt gonna be discounted
---
Fun fact, if you use it while fully infected you go back to being unbroken but the infection time starts back down again.
---
Nm doesn't counter rancor because you still get moried
---
Dead By Daylight Beach Volleyball.
---
Please.
---
yeah i get that. i feel like they missed out on a good opportunity to make us find ways to make wierd perks/add on viable. like the "chase a survivor for 90 sec using distressing" one was a good example. give us more stuff that makes us use perks and add ons we normally wouldn't
---
I know, first I'm trash at killer, second i didn't had anymore perks, but I changed it tho
---
I'm bout to be the nightmare on elm street dlc later because beanie Quentin
---
Unfortunately, the next drop is going to be a One Hit Wonder.
---
Soon‚Ñ¢
---
I am excited for that perk in the PTB. People are already screaming legion is broken.
---
Im on pc and currently rank 6 survivor so I don t know ifnits high ranked BUT you ll recognise me as I always play scoops ahoy steve. Always.
---
Yeah legion's power is trash don't get me wrong, it's just that nemesis would be a delayed constant spirit fury: you stun him you get downed in 12 seconds 100%, and you don't even need enduring to make it work.
---
I still fail to pip even after getting 4ks for some reason.  I don‚Äôt facecamp, I just win my chases and kill them when there‚Äôs like 1 gen left... but then I get fucked over basically just because I don‚Äôt bring Ruin or Pop goes the Weasel and the entity is entirely balanced around you having one of those two perks
---
Im in asia pacific time zone and always play in late afternoon
---
They continuously said that those stats are just numbers and there is a lot of things that come into play. Don't take them as gospel, and don't use them to back up your personal opinion.
---
I really think they should take all the Killers and give us Survivor versions, as well as take all the Survivors and give us Killer versions.
---
It'd be extremely interesting to see the "What If" of each of them.
---
Depends on the survivor on the hook. Based on his/her performance and whether there's noed or a camping Bubba I usually go for the save but if they haven't done anything in the match then I let the bitch die.
---
Because it is just OP whining and giving the Camper exactly what they want. This results in more toxic killers deciding to be campers seeing how effective the trolling and seeing how much people whine about it.
---
Do you seriously think whining about an in-game mechanic will make LESS people do it? How fucking dumb is this subreddit.
---
Ive played 4 trappers farming and doing the challenges
---
No-heal strat is probably suicide vs oni because you'll leave too man orbs. You'll want to stay healed but play it safe and sweaty so he has to work for the M1.
---
Recover from the dying state using the perk ‚ÄòUnbreakable‚Äô twice. Must be completed in a single trial.
---
He lets you spoil yourself in his torture game Don't make it angry, don't let it take away your power, do not displease the entity
---
Spirit better killer better perks also more fun
---
You can grab injured survivors out of medium/ slow vaults. If you're chasing someone and they only have windows near them, rub up against their back and wait till they start vaulting someone, press M1 (don't hold it)
---
Well we can actually make this canon, ya know.
---
The Entity feeds off hope. Farming games give you just that and kind of "re-energize" your hope batteries after getting destroyed by sweaty killers or sweaty SWFs.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a thing. SWF could possibly counter that to some degree but it ain‚Äôt a given. 
---
Beast of Prey Though is gonna be worse. Guaranteed down in a chase. Even though you gotta be in chase for at least 30 seconds. A Feeling many legion players know
---
Killers as survivors would be awesome
---
But i think survivors as killers would be to difficult to come up with a power for each of them. Unless they share the same power and are just skins
---
Broken Key: What is my purpose?
---
The Entity: To help survivors complete Rift Challenges.
---
Broken Key: Oh my God.
---
I just got them on the internet somewhere, probably amazon or something
---
That‚Äôs not remotely a good idea. If there‚Äôs someone nearby after they sprinted up to the hook, the other two get a boosted speed for the killer just chasing another survivor.
---
try, corrupt intervention, PGTW, BBQ and STBFL.
---
also with trapper you can do things which with anyone you cant: trap the gates, free Thrill of the hunt, make impossible to rescue when you pick up someone with a pallet. 
---
maybe I didnt explain myself very good tho, im kinda ill.
---
All I got to say on that is that Hook Camping is also a legitimate strategy, but I don't think you'll see it that way... Now do you?
---
Hag would be a good match potentially? She needs set up time and you can dominate the field (much like trapper)!
---
someone can't take a joke
---
Always respect the pebble. Especially when they throw it up in the air. You look at it like "wtf?"
---
Scoooooops Ahoy. No more words to say
---
I'm a survivor main you spud. Doesn't change the fact that survivors are far and away the more toxic group in this game. If you're loading into a game with the plan to be to flashlight spam the killer, especially if you do this in a group, you are toxic. That's how toxicity works. 
---
Try and justify your bullshit all you want mate, it's still just juvenile toxicity.
---
That's is a SWF, notice how theres 0 killers in the lobby
---
UK too!
---
No, but since the game isn‚Äôt balanced around the best players in the world, and instead is balanced around the majority, playing against above average survivors requires game slowing perks.
---
Stfu. We need them to think its god tier so they continue to waste time doing totems instead of gens.
---
This trial doesn‚Äôt have a fire exit!
---
Wrong it was bugs. They are discounted now.
---
I sometimes wish ps4 had chat like this. A lot of the killers always play with me cause I don't tea bag and actually play the darn game
---
The perk about "dead silence" was more to stop, noise to 0 and the bleeding. A little like in Death Stranding when the main character has to hold his breath to escape the guys. 
---
Second perk, I couldn't more agree with you, it is true. 
---
Anyways I spent a little time on this at work, just had those things in my head and thought about things that could relate to "hunting", running/silence/scent etc :)
---
Gotta save the Baby Dweet
---
I mean... I‚Äôm still only rank 6 as killer, winning most of my chases in seconds, and I still can‚Äôt pip up.  I‚Äôm playing mostly Plague and still doing a pretty good job at stopping gens but still on my get silver at best in that category.
---
Just go play Civ 5, bitch.
---
They probably got into stage 2 on the hook a lot. You need to hook every survivor at least twice if you want a good chance at pipping. You'll also want to focus more on gen patrolling than winning chases. Sounds like you're too dedicated to chases and aren't going back to generators.
---
I also play without ruin or gen perks most of the time, so just keeping all this in mind will drastically improve your pip rate.
---
I feel so fucking cool right now, I feel like I'm on AMC's Ride with Otzdarva
---
1. Right, And the only issue is when a survivor has a key. There is no way for a killer to kill that survivor if he has a key and at least 2 braincells. I would be completely fine with that, if I had any way to stop survivor from opening the hatch. Too many second chances for a survivor, who and whose team failed to complete their objective. 
---
2. So you are saying that it is easy to win a chase against a survivor? Lmao, go try to win a chase against ANY good survivor with meta shit like deadhard, bl or else faster than in 80 seconds. Of course do not play spirit or the nurse, just like me. Try Demodog, maybe clown (without purple or red addons of course, because this is how I currently play). If you are playing without tryhard stuff, winning a chase in that case becomes really hard, especially compared to sitting on a generator and HOLDING M1 button. Besides, even though killer is faster than survivors, the survivor can get a lot of extra distance by using pallets and windows. 
---
3. I am complaining about the feature, that does not work ONLY when I slug 4 survivors on 5 gens and sit on the one survivor, who dies last to ensure he doesn't get a hatch. Of course if these survivors aren't using unbreakable or else. In a normal game, where killer and survivors have equal skill, there is no way for a killer to stop gens from being done -&gt; there is always a windows of opportunity to use a key. So go fuck yourself with your idiotic argument about m1 killers who cannot prevent gens from being done.  
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv_VAuYBZb0 here you are great example of a good killer player (if you think that Tru3 is a bad player, then I see no point in talking to you anymore). He clearly outplayed and won a match against these survivors, yet they had a key, which resulted into 2-2. 
---
4. a final survivors doesn't need a key in a first place, yet he CAN use a key to open a hatch that has been closed by a killer. Did you really just forgot about that? I'm not blaming you for THIS, but it seems you really lack experience against keys to understand how they sound balanced on paper and how they are broken actually.
---
&gt;Charlie hunnam.
---
Ehh true, might have forgot some key points, maybe you dont get exhaustion with this perk there, gotta fix :P
---
purposefully making the game unfun for one person with no discernible gain = trying to escape and get points and a pip? yeah I didn‚Äôt think so
---
For me the sake of being chased by something monstrous gives at least a little bit of excitement
---
Kinda like in monsters inc.
---
The laughter and joy of survivors turns out to be way better food than suffering and death! So now the entity takes people like comedians and everybody chills and has a great time until all eternity.
---
Steps to summon a Plague EVERY TRIAL. 
---
Step 1: run autodidact for once.
---
cool
---
well not in the same way tbh u can get away with chasing and placing traps bc imo she is a more aggressive version of trapper
---
Dedicated servers be like
---
It wasn't, that's what's sad :|
---
I think this one in particular is actually easy.
---
Wow what a hard condition to use a Mori.
---
The  equivalent for survivors would be an offering which allows them to escape after they did 1 gen.
---
I only run Ruin as a distraction to have time to place more traps
---
And just sitting there at the exit gate is fun how? It's showing skill how? Yeah, thought so... it isn't.
---
Yup, its up to us to make sense of it. Because lord knows nobody at BHVR is doing it.
---
I like this, absolutely love having nice conversations with the other players, no matter how the match went
---
Well all killers weren't good people in their past lives. Some of them were already killers so them as a survivors wouldn't make sense. Also it would take way too much work for them to come up with 19 new killers out of the survivors.
---
That tier 1 spine chill wont give you enough time to react. I would suggest replacing it with 'we'll make it'. Other than that, it looks good for what you own.
---
It doesn't matter who you play, it's still a joke how any behaviour is claimed toxic. Flashlights are there to blind the killer; that is literally their sole purpose. If someones clicking at you to distract you when you're playing killer, ignore it. Crying "reeee toxic" every time a survivor does something is worse than anything survivors actually do.
---
Furthermore, "toxicity" is balanced out by killers with facecamping, tunnelling, slugging in endgame. If someone's abusing bugs to get an advantage, that's toxic. Messing around with shit that's already in the game isn't toxic, just suck it up and move on to the next game.
---
What is complicated about it? My solution stops the tunneling off hook to use the mori, now you cant really make use of the green mori when you decide to tunnel.
---
Removed someone posted this before you
---
Trapper relies to much on luck to be a top tier killer, if the survivors are oblivious then he can do very well but otherwise he's just an M1 killer that can't really do anything about getting kited through the map.
---
I would say I've gotten more grabs as Pig than anyone else, maybe because she doesn't get affected by Spine Chill while crouching?
---
both are great, spirit is more powerful rn if u care about rankin up
---
&gt;Lack of skill. Boy, listen. If you are in the killer shack, put the pallet down and this bitch starts standing still, you will get utterly fucked. Cause she could fake it at first and then, OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE she stops faking it and since she saw where you were walking to, she gets a free hit. What a fun killer. Also i want to say one more thing
---
Wow. So, you are saying that she can mindgame you into thinking she is faking by faking it but doing it right after and the only counterplay of that is counter-mindgaming her? Impossible. That should not happen. How the devs allow mindgaming to exist on this game? This is bullshit.
---
&gt;So by this logic, we should still have the old legion cause its the survivors fault for getting 28 stab wounds and getting downed literally instantly. Its the survivors fault for NOT HAVING COUNTERPLAY.
---
Well, you would be right if spirit didn't have counterplay. She has, but you just can't accept it. Its easier to blame the game than trying to improve, especially when a fundamental core of a killer is mindgaming, a mechanic that, on a superficial view, has no counterplay for those who didn't predict it.
---
&gt;You need a perk to counter her, and even thats not completely foolproof counter. Thats the issue.
---
No, you dont, but iron will helps with countering all killers of the game, since all of them can hear. In other words, you have a perk useful with all killers that's extra-useful with her.
---
If your logic was right, we should nerf doctor too, since madness tier up is inevitable unless you are using calm spirit.
---
Spirit is simple and pure mindgaming. Whoever is best at it, wins.
---
In what universe is one kill a win?
---
See, but you are taking all the use out of it. Just make it 2 hooks on that survivor. The next time you would down them, they would be dead anyways.
---
 Am absolutely in love with 3 gen trapper. Find the closest group of 3 gens and spend the match trapping loops around them! 
---
If you Include perks like pop goes and surge, the survivors will have a bloody hard time surviving!
---
I'm calling the Nancys playing vs a Spirit.
---
Well  something here doesn‚Äôt check out. There is no way that survivors are doing gens so fast that you can‚Äôt win if you end chases ‚Äúin seconds‚Äù. I mainly play survivor but I‚Äôve also been rank 1 killer more times than I can count and I know you can win with lower tier killers without ruin, I play wraith.
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, the game poster should be the four survivors flash lighting a wraith standing in the corner.
---
I am really enjoying this "Corrupt is better than Ruin" testing phase. Knowing exactly where the killer is from the start of the match is a huge game advantage. I don't have to run to totem locations wasting time finding Ruin, don't have to ruin tap, or always have great skill check builds.
---
AND MY TEAM WILL ACTUALLY DO GENERATORS! Instead of running around like headless chickens.
---
Yes. Corrupt is better than Ruin.
---
I'm a fairly new player so don't exactly know the game inside and out, but it was never going to be scary forever. You play any game/watch any movie enough times and the fear factor will wear off. It's reached a point for me where there are horror movies that I *would've* found scary 5-10 years ago now do absolutely nothing to me; It's desensitization to horror and the tropes horror has. While new killers may add a little bit of tension back to the game, nothing is going to add the fear factor while the loop of "Search for generator, watch bar fill up while you look for killer, run away if killer finds you" is the core factor to the game.

I requires more effort then using a key...
---
Not to mention you can't counter a key at all, in the old days you could at least pull 'em out of the hatch if they did it in front of you now it's just instant escape, if they at least would use a skill check with tremendous difficulty or something to (re-)open the hatch then I wouldn't have such a big problem with it.
---
The I'm here to be the killer not a killer scene. You don't get an entity displeased scene at the end of a match so that's a win
---
No it isn‚Äôt I just didn‚Äôt think all the people commenting would have seen my reasoning.
---
You cannot use those stats to say anything. They are absolute garbage.
---
Did they control for games where the killer would only have gotten 1k but got a 4K because the survivors who could have left decided to go on a suicidal mission?
---
Did they control for how imbalanced the game becomes from a hook suicidal or DC early in the game?
---
Did the they control for memers?
---
No.
---
Unless they do that, you can infer literally nothing because it‚Äôs junk data

LF is good to get BBQ if you havn't got it already from the shrine.

Well..... i did look at her booty a little bit.... C-Completely unrelated to the reason I let her go though
---
its fine, if u got medkits u can swap self care for botany, that increases item healing efficiency way more and also makes u heal faster, great for healing the teammates u find with empathy
---
In my experience this is going to happen regardless, over exposure just numbs you to the fear eventually.
---
Nice mask
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the badge update. but also my argument won't work on you. You play for 4ks, I play to hit people and put them on hooks
---
This is by far the dumbest shit I've ever heard.
---
Michael Myers AKA The Shape builds his power by stalking the survivors. How stalking works is that The Shape will stare at your survivor while holding the power button, this 'feeds' his stalk gauge (the square beneath Myers in the drawing) and powers him up. 
---
The Shape starts at Tier 1, he has almost no heartbeat / terror radius, reduced speed, cannot gain Bloodlust and is undetectable by perks. After he stalks for a short time he reaches Tier 2, where he is a regular killer (normal terror radius and speed etc.). 
---
The most dangerous thing is if he hits Tier 3, this changes his stance (his knife will be raised up by his head) and he can one-hit-down everyone. By default Tier 3 lasts around 60 seconds, iirc. The joke is that the Meg is teabagging and allowing Michael to fill his stalk gauge from Tier 2 to Tier 3, which is bad news for the survivors.
---
If you come across the Shape and he just stares at you, try to break line of sight and waste his time. The longer he stares the stronger he gets! He can't go back to Tier 1 after hitting Tier 2, but he can hit Tier 3 several times a match if the survivors aren't cautious.

Yeah but that‚Äôs playing SWF. Of course a coordinated team is going to survive more often.
---
Some aren't on x box one, from what I've seen. Which is really weird
---
Its almost like NOED is extremely easy to counter and it being allowed to do anything significant is entirely the fault of the survivors
---
Fuckin' lol though, survivors get to use multiple crutches without issue but as soon as a killer used NOED he's going too far, get over yourselves
---
People who chose that for their main and then won‚Äôt ever try anything different because they‚Äôre comfortable with being below average
---
Me for 2 fucking weeks before I realized the trophy was glitched
---
It‚Äôs like watching a scary movie 100x it‚Äôll go stale in terms of scariness eventually.
---
Okay so you don‚Äôt actually play killer then.
---
omg so op, she next for the nerf boy
---
I think exactly the opposite. A problem cannot be solved if it is not addressed. 
---
I have faced camping killers before, specially Bubbas, but I had no idea that this problem still persisted after the emblem changes.
---
So yeah, I have no issue at all with posts like this being made. You can downvote them if you want, I will upvote them back.

I tend to mori twitchers if I see them in my lobby and dont already know em. Content for them, its funny watching them rage etc

Proves my point

Ok im sorry I won't do it again
---
Yeah but let‚Äôs be honest, would you like to get killed the fourth time you‚Äôre hit with feral frenzy?
---
Spine Chill hard-counters her actually, but i've made a habit of approaching gens i expect people to be at without looking directly at them specifically since Spine Chill is pretty popular nowadays with all the Spirits roaming around.
---
The game is balanced around 1v1.
---
Why leaving? Nothing else left to say except immature insults? Great, you've only proven me right.
---
Children will come here and tell tales of me!
---
This was the worst possible time for Dwight to learn that he could levitate
---
Spamming noise can definitely screw you as a sound-based killer, especially when it gets stuck on loop. Has anyone noticed you get bp for struggling or do they just DC when the killer picks them up?

So you get bp for sucking at surviving and being carried to the hook (up to 400 I believe) then up to what another 800 for the struggle phase? So say about 1k bp. Escape is 5000, hatch is 2,000 dying on hook is say 1,000. That's regardless of facecamp or not. 
---
And if a killer facecamped you its reducing everyone's potential bp and emblem progress not just yours. You can still depip if you just genrush and leave. So your already getting half a hatch escape in bp you want more? If its better then 2,000 total screw the rescue attempt that guys getting paid. If its less then entitled survivors will still complain.
---
I know killers have challenges. That's why I said this -
---
&gt; But archives incourage players to **facecamp **, farm, **tunnel**, etc.
---
Did you see it? *facecamp* and *tunnel*.
---
I know not everything has to be perfect for me. That's where the fun is at. I said in the post I hate the amount of RNG the developers implemented. I stand by that but a healthy amount of rpg makes the game fun and surprising at times. The point of this post was to address the common problems that have come with archives. It's your choice if you want to do the challenges but that doesn't stop you from going up against people who are doing those challenges and will do anything to complete them. Ie - facecamp, tunnel and farm.
---
Here's something I've noticed; ever since archives released, there has been an increase in facecamping, tunnelling, farming, pallet wasting, etc. Though some killers and survivors prefer to farm through these challenges and throw the game. 
---
Behaviour has worked tirelessly to counter these common problems but all their progress has now regressed with the implementation of archives.
---
Archives truly do bring the worst out of people.
---
These two have some one of the best friendships/on-screen chemistry, it really makes the show
---
Don't you love it when killers camp the hook.
---
Sad thing is it shouldn't be, the Switch barely runs dbd but runs so many impressive games otherwise. Like actual DOOM. On a mobile processor from 2015.
---
Yeah, when I play with friends it's always worse too.
---
It's poorly optimized and it should be CPU bound not GPU. I used to run it on a 10 year old laptop when it first came out.
---
I thought it was a vocal from the song "Gucci Coffin" by Josh A &amp; Jake Hill. Not from that show lol
---
Yeah it really sucks, I feel like she‚Äôs super strong and fun to play but when it comes to pipping it never works
---
&gt;You can‚Äôt be playing against very good spirits if you really believe that whoever is best at mindgaming wins. Most of the time she‚Äôll fake and see what you are doing then move at ridiculous speeds towards where she saw you moving.
---
Well, that's exactly my point. The average good spirit is better in mindgaming than the average good survivor. If she's faking a phasing to see your reaction, that's a way of mindgaming. And if you aknowledge that and give her a false reaction to confuse her, it's a way of counter-mindgaming.
---
&gt;Playing against spirit is just a sequence of guessing at first and hoping you guess correctly long enough so that you can start making predictions based on their play style.
---
In other words, "playing spirit is constantly doing mindgaming until she catches you". That's exactly my point. One thing is saying that mindgaming is killer-favoured and adding some nerfs to compensate. Other thing is completely removing the mindgaming and stripping the essence of the killer.
---
For me, i save $2 AUD. Steam it's $13.56 AUD; each ST character totals 1050 auric cells so I can buy 1100 auric cells for $11.80 AUD. Guess i'll just buy the characters in game if I'm not missing out on anything then.

Undetectable only affects aura reading perks, which means she won't show up with Object of Obsession, but Spine Chill and Premonition will pick her up.

All wrong. Fun fact: you can win EVEN WITHOUT running those perks. They do not need the perk to be countered. Unlike spirit
---
&gt;cant see survivors. The counterplay is out-mindgaming her. Is it that unacceptable that a mindgaming-oriented killer is counterplayed by overmindgaming her?
---
&gt;Thats a necessary condition to a mindgame to happen. You are basically saying this game shouldn't allow mindgaming-themed killers.
---
Not at all^ im all for it, as long as its fair.
---
&gt;Anyway, i dont see this discussion going anywhere from now on. We should just agree to disagree while we are still in a civilizated way.
---
I do agree with this. Im just losing my cool with this cause of the difference is opinions, keep your opinion all you like though, at the end of the day, you are you, and im me so there isnt much to argue if you are dead set on that opinion. Have a good day and thank you for the good debate.

Ainsley chan?

Leatherface if you really want BBQ and Chili, otherwise Freddy. He's really good.

Still requires the Survivors to have completed every gen.

Everyone else: uses 2 from each side
---
Wait Jim Fairfield?
---
Yup. I love her but I want to hit red ranks this season so I'm holding off on the vomit for a while
---
Everyone still farms each other but since it's only safe hooks people don't get the challenge done and just farm more.
---
I don‚Äôt really agree with the post, in my games they usually try to help unless theres nothing we can do
---
Nice work on the right arm
---
Bubba be always camping
---
Don't worry. He lost a couple hundred bloodpoints for it. A just punishment.
---
Just facecamp any survivor that tbags you /s
---
That infinite sucks ass
---
Some are simply enough if they remove " In single trail " quote
---
Yeah I never use it. Its a huge waste of time like the others said. I'd rather spend my time doing gens i jured and just try to run a loop to not get hit. Otherwise bring a medkit or let others heal you.
---
I mean, they want to be toxic you should be toxic l

And on PS4, it‚Äôs only as survivor like I‚Äôm doing right now. If I chose to play a killer I would already be looking at survivors loading in to my lobby, and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even matter the time of the day. The only time when the killer queue on PS4 (for me at least) has been long was when an event is going on solely because of the BP gain with killer.
---
I think you should heed your own advice. Because you basically just said "I don't like it, therefore it's bad design".
---
FREDDY IS BAE
---
I‚Äôm not going to throw the game for one person. Besides, tbagging doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôll just give them a good ole‚Äô no no headshake when I down them.
---
SWF with at least 1 friend.
---
Your lucky he isnt car bubba he'd be zooming around you faster than a p3 claudette can hide in a bush.
---
I mean you do have the best outfit for spirit
---
First, that isn't even true: "lucky mindgaming" is the sensation of those who lose more than win. And that makes statistical sense, since a spirit main will practice her mindgames on most of her matches, but a survivor main won't. Consequently, spirits mains tend to be better on mindgaming than survivors mains.
---
Also, even if luck were a factor, it shouldn't be nerfed provided it isn't a heavy one. Doing that would create prerogatives to nerf trapper, pig, hook kobes, ace perks, map random choosing, etc.
---
The way you react to a random result is also part of skill, after all.
---
Awesome thanks
---
That was a great explanation, thanks a lot!
---
Not all the time, so many times I get trapped and never escape
---
Bitching about NOED in 2019 LULW
---
It absolutely should. 
---
Look at 3 gen hostage doc, a build that requires said sweaty 4 man to realistically beat without going into a 50 minute match. Said build is super boring to actually do, and is seen like once a month. A truly optimal 4 man swf team is equally as boring, as you finish the game in like 3 minutes and leave the hooked guy to die as you get out asap. Nobody has fun doing it, so it's really rare.
---
Balancing the game around a sweaty 4 man swf would be like balancing survivors around the 5 blink nurse you've mentioned. It'd hurt everyone who don't play like that, which is the vast majority of the playerbase.
---
 You aren‚Äôt a good survivor, stop blaming your teammates and notice your own mistakes. If you ran every single loop optimally then well done to ya. If not don‚Äôt blame teamates
---
"I though we were already there, what you gonna do, send me to double hell?"
---
No

Used to be able too. Not anymore.
---
LIES AND TREASON
---
I feel afraid, there are people in the Twitter replies who want to camp and say camping is a strategy.Disgusting..
---
I‚Äôve played trapper at rank 1 and I can say he‚Äôs criminally underrated if you are good at placing traps then you can snowball pretty well.
---
And?
---
lag switching report these guys under network abuse if thats even an option in this god forsaken game, now time to go back to de piping with all iri medals because the killer dced after you fucking escaped 4 head
---
The alchemist won‚Äôt be a surivor or killer he‚Äôs only meant for lore.
---
I think so. Am also waiting 5+ minutes to find a killer queu
---
I will now always be referring to leatherface as "chainsaw guy (not hillbilly though)" from now on.
---
But if you trap areas of a map survivors never go to you catch a few sure, but good teams will just hug gens while 1 goes for the save and your time is wasted
---
‚ÄúWith the nurse, unhook then heal 4 survivors. Must be done in a single trial‚Äù
---
The spirit nerf we all need
---
You can actually still do it I found. Start opening a chest and hold sprint and leave. The chest slams closed and you're running without triggering SB. Don't know if it works with anything else
---
No it absolutely shouldn‚Äôt. 
---
By your very own logic, 3 gen hostage doc, 5 blink Nurse, Omegablink Nurse, old Brand New Parts, pre-nerf Prayer beads., is all balanced because you didn‚Äôt see it often. If you don‚Äôt see something often, that does not magically make it balanced. 
---
Old 5 blink Nurse barely ever happened, yet when it did, it was a surefire way to ruin the game for 4 players because it was genuinely overpowered. Does the fact that it was extremely low in commodity suddenly make it balanced?
---
Bubba doesn‚Äôt quite understand..
---
they work fine even without it
---
you should only be opening chests with ace or if its a challenge wasting tones of valuable time on getting low teir items and SOMETIMES something you could have gotten in the blood web in 2 games any fucking way is just being a detriment to your team
---
This is top tier image editing, well done.
---
Seeing "Entity Displeased" is like being told your parents are disappointed in you. That shit stings, all I crave is approval and making a gigantic otherworldly sky spider proud of me gets me going.
---
I mean my name has been Franks Left Nut forever now lol. had a few people remember and recognize me because of it
---
&gt;when you DC everybody is cucked
---
I assure you the other guys on your team aren't thrilled to be playing against the thing you've DCd against either, as there is only so much fun you can get vs purple add ons spirit, hostage doc, etc. Those 5 seconds of you getting hooked won't turn the game around, if the killer is competent at what he's doing they will win anyway.
---
&gt;From people who DC on first down against perk less Legion
---
That's not the people I'm talking about. Those should ideally be punished but we can't really separate their disconnections from everybody else's.
---
&gt;to matches that survivors team were eventually winning against Iri Infantry Huntress when giving their best instead of giving up.
---
It's not about not being able to win and you know it. Just like with old legion, you could beat him but you had no fun in doing it. You can absolutely win vs prayer beads spirit, it's been done before and if everybody plays very optimally she's gonna lose. I can also assure you that absolutely no1 will have fun in that match, and people would rather play against something they can have fun with.
---
&gt;when you're afraid of challenges
---
It's not about challenges! It's about the said thing being boring. When you dc as killer on haddonfield you aren't doing it because you are afraid of a challenge, you do it because the map is shit and really boring to play out. Just like prayer beads are really boring to play out.
---
&gt;now against 4 survivors killer is in a huge disadvantage
---
If all of them are good, yeah. But most of the players aren't that great, and if you look at statistics even at red ranks we see something like 70% kill rate. Killers are doing well.
---
This is happening to me, too. Someone else here said that it has to do with the rift challenges so everyone is playing killer right now.
---
What would be the point of leaving? To blindly wander while his hook gets saved?
---
Self Care can be pretty clutch when you are going for the exit and there‚Äôs no one around to heal you. Making a run do a guarded exit while injured is suicide.
---
Ruin just has no serious competition, except maybe corrupt intervention. Pop can be good but feels like whenever i run it gens get popped right in my face as im heading to it. 
---
And even with pop or corrupt i think most people run it with ruin and not instead of.
---
After 900 hours, I still yell out when the hag pops outta nowhere, that always gets me.
---
My SWF group always laughs at me.
---
Lucky!
---
Thanks mate! I just like killers more and bought all of them.. i thought that i can try them and when i got in match i got players above lvl30 survivors while my killer is on lvl1 :D but thej i  practice my surviving :D
---
This is incredible!
---
[Myers Pallet Stun groan] I FEEL GOOD
---
He's just deranking and trying not to get reported
---
So if you don‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs in the meme, why did you even make it?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs totally what I was going for
---
I might be in the minority, but they usually don't scare me, even when they 'jumpscare' me. Once every 10-20 matches against jumpscare myers I'll be gen-grabbed because I'm not paying attention, but outside of that I'm almost never startled by them. Pig on the other hand has gotten me WAY more often, because I'll think it's another survivor.
---
I'd say change self care for plunderers so you cant get good items, that's what I run
---
Whoops, my bad!
---
Same here :/
---
Okay. So then why did you go after someone for responding to something you believe? Just because it‚Äôs a meme doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs nothing to engage with
---
Speak for yourself. The gameplay is fun and the maps are cool. The only real issues this game has IMO is performance, perk balance and half baked mechanics (luck, chests, survivor items in general, sabotage, lockers) on the survivor side.
---
That would be a good QOL change.

---
I think bhvr is gonna make it easier because its impossible without swf
---
this is really well done so far!
---
Even so, this is absolutely spot on and headed in the right direction.
---
Ha yeah it sucks. I just switched to PC, so i'm starting from the beginning with no teachables and rank 20, so I was hoping to start the long grind again but the killer queues are stupid right now. Bad timing, but hey, at least we can still work on levelling up survivors.
---
Yea wretched shop loop makes me sad as killer, and then there's rancid abattoir....
---
Nah it‚Äôs cool glad someone got it
---
Entity: No! This isn't how you're supposed to play the game
---
I must agree. It's so stupid that BT is mainly supposed to be a counter perk to camping but it doesn't matter if you're against a stealth killer like Ghostface for example.
---
*During a long bus ride home, Claudette took a stroll in the woods that would change her life forever.*
---
Thank
---
&gt; I think their addons definitely needed worked on but overall the power was decent and not unbeatable when you knew what you were doing as a surv.
---
On an individual level there was literally nothing you could do as a solo survivor vs a Legion that wanted you dead, even with the coordination of 3 teammates all with insta heals.
---
Old legion was a blight on the game. We don't need anything so poorly designed ever again.
---
Pretty good, delicious turkey
---
BT does kinda make you invincible if you know the map and you can get to a loop fast enough lol
---
I gave her the hatch at least
---
You really got some issues
---
You‚Äôre argument is very invalid. Dying in one hook is completely different than a survivor tbagging.
---
Practice
---
4 out of nine are for aura reading. Two of them are limited by range
---
2 are for charges
---
other 2 are for not loosing the key
---
The last one is to increase range of those two addons for aura reading with limited range
---
Basically if you don't have one of the first 4 addons on the green key then it's useless. On top of that depending on the specific aura-reading addon a very limited number of second addons will be useful. A lot of combinations will make second addon useless.
---
That's your trivia for today.
---
P.S.: if you were just poking fun at my English - yeah my English is pretty good so far
---
Huh. My bad. really didn't know that it's a common thing. Deleting thread in 3, 2 ,1...

This post again......

Oh, like you did just now?

I hate it so much. At my friend's place, I have to hit it before it even makes it to the check zone. At my place it's almost exactly perfect.

The one thing stopping me from playing him is his inability to rearm traps on the ground if you're holding one

hehe yeahh boi

Then again, he wasnt trying to seem bad, he never said to not feel proud, you're reading into it too much

healing parties are actually effective with Leader.

I think the opposite I loved the Nintendo DS

Well, you can win mindgames against spirit without iron will. But naturally, the better she is, the harder it is, and the perk makes it easier.

‚ÄúYes and yes‚Äù

Yeah DS needs nerf but we all know that survivors would flip their shit if anything but killers got nerfed!

I suck at huntress I love her more and the creepy humming but she's too slow for me and I can't aim her hatchets for shit.
---
I think that your attempt to turn this back on me is failing. The guy just said self care and you immediately attack him
---
Honestly, I would too, if I went up against a bunch of high ranks
---
Spine chill is useless if you have map awareness
---
Until Spirit, everyone was calling Spine chill a horrible perk. Now it's suddenly great because of one killer?
---
I just disagree with you, even if what I said above doesn't apply to you. Spine Chill just gives you extra awareness and it isn't necessary to do the things you continue to do. If anything, iron will and lightweight are much better options because you can deny the phase tracking instead of just gaining knowledge of the fact she's just phasing
---
I love oni I hope he doesn‚Äôt get nerved like all the killers that isn‚Äôt easily bullied by toxic survivors!
---
The fuck is up with that survivors name?
---
I‚Äôs buy Legion, especially since you just started. You can farm bloodpoints with them super easily and they‚Äôre straight forward.  
---
Go stab people. If you really want to farm bloodpoints consider buying leatherface if you haven‚Äôt already. Bbq and chili is the best perk for farming as it doubles your bloodpoints at the end of the game.  
---
Spirit plays differently and could be difficult for you early on.
---
i love how survivor mains always say this as if anyone will actually disagree lmfao
---
This is like one of those papers your English teacher used to give you where you had to fix all the mistakes.
---
I regularly get ruthless off of a mori, its more of a "key" for killers lol they get an escape once the hatch is in and we get to kill them once they've been hooked; the trick is...youve gotta stall the game outüòí you wanna kill survivors and still rank up? Fine, but you better balance all your other duties (protect totems, avoid pallet stuns, avoid stuns, chase survivors and simultaneously force them to heal a few times, hook everyone 2 times at least, etc you've just gotta be on POINT). Not for a win but a good long game of finally getting a pip and a order of 4 piece Mc.Mori nuggets.
---
p3 claudettes who think they‚Äôre good because everytime the killer chases them they lose them in the grass. Meanwhile one guy died and the other twi are on death hook because god forbid she takes aggro for a second.
---
I thought we played together before but I don‚Äôt think we have! You‚Äôll recognize me pretty easily, though... :D
---
Bonk!!!!!!
---
Heheeueehague. I like dis. Hehehauushee
---
Does it have stuff for the Oni patch too?
---
I love that nobody talks about how Nursw's Matchbox add on with max range add ons (1 blink only but she's 4.2 ms/s) makes Nurse the most powerful thing in the game even more than Omegablink, but just makes her skill cap so incredibly high nobody knows how to play her
---
Gosh, it's a good time to be a Nurse main
---
About spirit tho, glad that bitch got balanced. thought she was always better than Nurse before these changes and finally the hoe will be put in her place
---
Nope, because it's not on live yet. When it comes out I'll make their perks and portraits ASAP.
---
First time I even saw Ghostface he was creeping while I was doing a gen. When he burst out from cover I just froze like a deer in the headlights. Or one of those fainting goats. He hit me and I didn't even move, I was just shocked. So used to listening for the terror radius, he spooked me good
---
I would argue that borrowed time could be better for both sides if it was changed to within 16 meters of the hook. As 32 is just too much. Imagine the Spirit is now leaving the hook and is right on the edge of the 32 meter radius, and she phases back to hook where she sees a survivor healing. Then slaps them and has to continue chase because of BT. That isn't anti-camping, it is the survivor making a mistake that the killer can't capitalize on because of a shit perk design. I do play both sides mind you and as killer I know I wouldn't leave someone to heal in my face, Decisive, BT, or not, I would slap that person down. But with BT at 32 meters it is stupidly rediculous, especially on small maps like Lery's, The Game, or the new map which is very small. It would trigger no matter if the killer was on the other side of the map slapping a guy down, it would still trigger against the killee who is NOT camping.
---
That's my take on BT. Take it as you will, but it is an Anti-Camping perk, not a god-like saving perk that works even if the survivors mess up. This will just put killers at another all-time low like Mettle of Man did.
---
Believe me, I had my fair share of old Mettle of Man procks that made my blood boil. It was not Pretty.
---
Can't argue with that
---
Freddy,leatherface,demo
---
Gen tap it like crazy or run small game I‚Äôm rank ten and that‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôve found to counter it quickly. Run technician if you‚Äôre missing the skill checks tho
---
Just make a point to target the player who does the unhooking. Pay attention to who's who. Usually I can keep track of how many times each player's been hooked. Jumping into a locker right after being unhooked is a terrible idea because you'll make noises inside it, there'll be a blood trail, and if you avoid making scratch marks while injured stealth becomes difficult. Escaping when freshly unhooked if the Killer decides to tunnel you (whether they realise it or not) can be difficult which is why DS is useful. I know on some occasions you might unintentionally run into someone who was unhooked less than a minute ago but that's just annoying and unfortunate but I wouldn't say it's unfair. I'm in support of discouraging tunnelling and camping although I suppose camping if someone's hooked near an open exit gate is reasonable, bearing in mind good teamwork and certain perks can counter even that. Like I said just try to really pay attention to avoid a potential DS.
---
I got a game for you sir. It's called Last Year The Nightmare
---
Took me a second to notice the claudette in the bottom panel
---
if i repeat it 3 times that means its right
---
do you by chance suffer from blue checkmark syndrome?
---
Kate thicc ....lol
---
Laughs in jane
---
That part on the bottom left a B-hole?
---
My guy, I get 4k almost every time 3k if the survivor gets the hatch.
---
Cause that quote is old Freddy and the Freddy we have is 2010 Freddy so perhaps we get old Freddy skin?
---
Bubba is doing what he does best..next time sit on a generator
---
The first time I went against a prayer beads spirit I almost shit myself. A rank 19 with 20 hours being the first grab almost gave me a heart attack
---
Lol the face above the trapper in the bottom pic üòÇ
---
Dude fuck that. I *love* the hex name jokes.
---
"Hex: Post-Nut Clarity" remains my favorite survivor of all time
---
I love legion and billy portraits but I play on console :(
---
playing as the killer on red ranks is the real horror
---
Because he is handsome!
---
I referenced his in game model and just focused on the actual shape of his face. I feel like BHVR needs to go back through and update the textures on everyone. People are always talking about the "ugly" survivors, and I think it's more of an issue of textures, because everyone has nice features in my opinion.
---
Just pressure generators 4Head
---
Not really. Ruin isn't hard to work through and the spawns are always awful and found quickly
---
Wake up, get hit while trying to go for the save because Freddy is camping, hence being called a farmer because BT didn‚Äôt activate.
---
You gotta click the button when the little line thing is over the white part. Ok but seriously though there is no advice we can give you on this its all just pratice.
---

---
Only one is the killer tho
---
Finally a UI pack that fits my playstyle.
---
Rated "R" for Retarded
---
The only change i would give to ds is disabling it when you unhook another survivor.
---
You can literally see him taking traps and placing them and he also wastes time doing it..Blood coil or bad survivors are the only 2 ways that can make him win games
---
Hung guy? üòè
---
Not as useful as you'd think chief, unless you're freddy you aint gonna clear that distance before they can immerse themselves elsewhere. Survivors have Dark Sense but i dont see anybody crying about that being OP even tho it functions almost identically but with different activation
---
Oh shit are people finally realizing this ds is better than the old one?
---
Who is first if not her???
---
If he is facecamping so hard, he will get rushed
---
If people are willing to be toxic and encourage it, that would be bad for the health of the game.
---
They still have 6 hours
---
Well the problem isn't even directly with Nemesis, it's the idea that killers are able to get access to the Oblivious and Undetectable status effects.
---
By design Legion will always get that unique benefit of these 2 statuses in that you will just bleed out with little to do against Deep Wounds.
---
They have to fundamentally rework Legion's power (again...) in order to fix this issue. Just nerfing the perk or nerfing the killer will both be bad results.
---
If they ever want to make the new effects a staple in killer's arsenals, then either this is going to be an intended way of playing Legion or they will have to alter how Frenzy works again.
---
Okay thanks a lot!
---
I Love it
---
I honestly have no idea what you're referencing. 
---
The repetition is because I'm sick of seeing that tired argument get trotted out every time. It's childish and pathetic. It honestly feels like the playerbase averages out at like 13 years old half the time with how ridiculous the community acts.
---
To be honest, it was so long ago that I forgot how to myself..
---
But hey, as long as you don't break the totem :)
---
Ainsley Harriet in the sky is hilarious. They should have definitely added him saying ‚ÄúYeeeeea Boi‚Äù when you get taken by the entity for Halloween.
---
just move on? holy fuck. it is a party game with an infinite number of matches you can play
---
&gt;Spirit power dosen t need nerf or buff, it needs freddy style rework
---
Yeah, that we can agree.
---
It really bugs me how Bhvr evaluates "doing well."
---
Like for survivors it doesn't take into account the fact that you really have very little control over what happens.  Killers only chases you?  No gens.  Killer never finds you?  Fuck you apparently you should be punished.  You did the only gen in a three minute long game because your teammates suck?  *You went above and beyond*!
---
Similarly with killers, an "even" game would be one where all 5 gens get completed in a reasonable time and 2 survivors escape.  Doing anything better should get the pips rolling in.  Instead they basically say "if you don't wipe them out with a 4k before all gens get done, you failed."
---
This is fucking cursed lol
---
I mean, stridor still counters iron will too
---
Yo can only do it on PC
---
If you go in there you be in the next chapter  ;)
---
Borrowed Time is fine as is. It‚Äôs probably one of the most powerful perks already.
---
No it's just because since his perks came out for some reason they didn't have the quotes under them even though the quotes were in the files.
---
Damn these survivor buffs are wild.

That, the one window spawn in fractured cowshed, the asylum, the preschool, grim pantry. Theres a ridiculous amount of god loops still in this game.
---
Patiently waiting for my preferred trapper build to show up again after prestiging

Wow, someone that doesn't ask for "Mainssss"
---
When i find the ruin in the first minute. ragequit.
---
Only on console
---
Looks like it time for some K E Y... M O M E N T S
---
Agreed i rarely run self care and if i do i use botany knowledge so i dont have to be that one guy just self caring in a corner
---
Thx for he tip
---
Lots of practice. You start to get really good as you move up in rank and start seeing ruin in every match
---
Put in either botany or plunders for empathy
---
Sounds like a good teamwork strategy that only a dumb/tunneling killer would fall for.
---
Where to get
---
I did farm a few of them that were ridiculous for killer. But majority I did without farming
---
[Right here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e3g1fz/the_shitty_ui_pack_10/f92t1q6/)
---
Thanks you devs.
---
Sooooo much better.
---
There are only certain spots on the map that Ruin can spawn. Unless the killer is EXTREMELY lucky and it spawned in the... I don't know, shack roof, corner of the map, closed room, blatantly open spot that noone ever looks at. Should be pretty straightforward.
---
Other than that you usually hear it pretty distinctively, sometimes even before seeing it. Can't tell you how many times I spawned on it, but never saw it, only heard the crackling fire noise. 
---
And, well, seeing dull totems also helps, this way you can kinda deduct where you should look next.
---
I thought the game would have fun and friendly competition between two necessary sides and I also thought the game would be at least a little scary.
---
1. I thought you were only allowed to cleanse totems if you were Ace 
---
2. I thought you had to release the chainsaw with billy to hit them ( i never got downs with the chainsaw till i knew)
---

Ohh ok! Because I‚Äôve seen people do it when I play on PS4 but I guess those people might be cross-playing from PC
---
First footage of Rin as a survivor.
---
Yeah, wow. I can tell they poured hours of thought and soul into writing that backstory.
---
I did not understand how  lunging worked when playing killer
---
Santa gives coal too.
---
Bruh you can‚Äôt just call yourself a hung guy and not give us pics
---
The problem with this game currently is that if the killer does not play with some sort of generator slowdown perk, gens will fly left, right and center. 
---
Ruin is the most suggested perk for gen slowdown, and I'd have to say Pgtw is right behind it.
---
Looking for people to play with and do the 4-man hatch and Left for Dead achievements. We can also do the tome challenges together.  Preferably chill players that don't take the game too serious.

Pretty much.

Holy Moly, that mori is awesome. \*lewd\*
---
Just to clarify we were talking about the new content for DBD while he was playing modern warfare. thought i'd share since it gave me boyish giggles.
---
I mean does he say that in the 2010 movie? I can‚Äôt remember but if he doesn‚Äôt then perhaps something has changed
---
cool opinion but this is reddit, make a baby dweet post already
---
Why does it matter if people do this or not? It has no impact on the game. If people want to make this their name, let them do it
---
Hiding in lockers was a good idea, I have to hold rb and then press rb to do the skill check (I‚Äôm on Xbox), and if I run all perks to help other survivors theyd be nice to me
---
That's probably their actual PSN because there is no crossplay. Or maybe you can actually change it on PS4 but I don't think so.
---
But by that point you're talking about less than 1% of the playerbase, the best of the best. The vast majority of survivors are not that good and it's unlikely they ever will be.
---
Check the twitter, it's going to be fixed at 3 pm EST today, along with the other challenge changes
---
Make it 16 meters and it should be good.
---
This is much more reasonable, thank you BHVR! (Now might be a Good time to look at Tome 4 too before it releases though)
---
I'm not whinning at all, all I said was "Yup, love games like this" yes obvious sarcasm but I put this video up because I know people can relate, If I was to put this up to complain I would of wrote a lot more than what I did.
---
it took me like a week to figure out that you can lunge.
---
*visible confusion*
---
It's so weird that those were the original designs for the old 4. I like how they are now much more.
---
Yoo I was in the killer shack working on a Gen with 2 other survivors; I peeped Myers stalking us, creeping his leg through the window right behind me, not a single sound. I literally jumped lol.
---
Yeah, I wait until the upcoming changed for the tome and then I was planning to do it like this
---
Much better.
---
I play claudette yet don't run either of those perks,.
---
Can I stop being tunneled now?
---
notice the shitpost/meme flair...
---
I like the tension as a survivor and it's just fun to prove my superiority as a killer.
---
wow, here it was the same
---
It dropped like that because of lag son. What do you kids not understand? I pressed it and then 10 years later it happens.
---
I mean personally it isn‚Äôt a meme it‚Äôs not funny it‚Äôs showing off something cool and new if it was a meme it would of had the cat getting yelled at for eating dinner
---
&gt; I thought you were only allowed to cleanse totems if you were Ace
---
i need you to expand on this lol
---
I hate Ruin for multiple reasons.
---
* It penalizes you for doing the objective, 
---
* There is no pre-requisite to cause a survivor to be affected
---
* Skillchecks have input delay.
---
* Skillchecks input worsens or improves with fps it seems
---
* Skillchecks are randomized, I'v completed gens without getting a single skillcheck and other times gotten 5 skillchecks before I'v even gotten to 15% progress
---
* Totem spawns are becoming more hidden as they rework maps, Ruin shouldn't last the entire game
---
* It can be combined with other perks to slow the game down even more (PGTW, dying light, thanataphobia).
---
* Other perks focused end game (NOED, bloodwarden, remember me) can smack you in the face if ruin never gets cleansed and you finally get to the end leaving you with the feeling of "Go fuck yourself"
---
* Not hitting the great gives you the penalty while also preventing you from regaining progress for 2 seconds, and should you continue to repair during this time you can get yet another skillcheck
---
* Killers that gain the early momentum (Find a survivor fast, end early chases quickly, quick succession downs) gain more out of it. Certain killers with high map pressure or strong in chases gain more from it
---
TLDR: Its too randomised how effective it can be in its current state and doesn't have a draw back, and combining with other perks can just  amp up how frustrating it is. Personally I'd prefer it be on a timer so it's not cleansed immediately and doesn't last the entire game
---
Are we just gonna ignore Ainsley?
---
I just got the "trap survivors 5 times challenge" yesterday and I'm so relieved
---
The community wanted this
---
Really well done.
---
I'd only consider it fair if they started on the hook.
---
He can lunge with a chainsaw too
---
Agreed, thank you! :)

I even triple checked to make sure it said I stunned him. My teammate DCd shortly affer

‚ÄúThe Legion, i was just- uh, just stretching my calves on the windowsill. Isometric exercise. Care to join me?‚Äù
---
I wonder if he‚Äôll auto read something new with tome 2?
---
Yeah he's pretty stupid, just let it go. "1 kill is a win because I feel like it" lmfao
---
If they made it based on the hook survivor and not the rescuer it'd be fine. Freddy is currently the strongest killer statistically but I wonder how many of the kills were from tunneling due to anti-BT capability
---
Didn‚Äôt finish the animation so they didn‚Äôt fall off 
---
Pallet moved them because of not able to complete frames for both animations and did the pallet animation and then finished the grab animation on the other side of the pallet
---
As always on this subreddit, the perk suggestion is absolute overkill. 32 meters is way too fucking huge. Make it 16 and you've got a deal. That way it counters actual camping without giving every unhooked survivor automatic BT just because their friends decided to loop me near the hook.
---
the drawback is that it's a hex
---
Wierd. I don't remember a stickman running out a door being the disconnect symbol.
---
Lol when an offering says "when burned etc etc" I thought we had to take the offering into the game aand burn it at one of the barrels of fire. Couldn't figure out how to do it and then I learned why. -_-
---
also giving survivors a good version of bbq in regards to the blood points gains would be great. also they should make the blood points offerings be added post game like bbq so they actually have a use and don't sit in my inventory never being used
---
If he's camping that hard he's getting rushed regardless.
---
This is a little too simplified but given we still have the fourth level it might just be okay. No complaints here.
---
Still not addressing the major problem with Challenges, being unable to do multiple in the same match. 
---
Being stuck with 1 objective every time forces people to play in an unnatural way in order to complete it ASAP so they can move to the next challenge.
---
it's not just him. the community at large seems to agree. mind boggling shit
---
DADDDDDDDDDY
---
Tfw you ran a healing build.
---
I mean that the image is fake, its a shitpost
---
What is the point of cleansing the totems? I‚Äôm a new player and nobody I‚Äôve been playing with has been cleansing them
---
good
---
Mostly likely your controllers. I just lift up the analong stick and blow into it. Usually works
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs pretend 4 solo survivors are always optimal and coordinated. That‚Äôs not even the point, we‚Äôre talking about BT not doing its job when needed.
---
I do know how to play him. You lean to stalk people to 99% you chase them down and pop it when you're right on them. Listen I get it that you're a True fanboy but his way is not the best way no matter what you want to believe. How about you learn how to play him and use his power the way it's supposed to be used.
---
Is that a thing? Cause this never happened to me before. Plus, it looked/sounded like he was able to hit immediately after and hit the pallet, and seems like he finished upon rewatching
---
I dunno man, I'm still giggling about Hex: Gonna Give it to Ya.
---
I've played with a few Hex: Devour Asses. I laugh every time.
---
I‚Äôm just wondering what happened to it to make it go from a meta perk to a useless one
---
Hex: Stop Making Hex Usernames Because This Post Said So
---
that go runnin for all the map and doin all actions rushed was a good thing, guess who got hooked first in his first 30 games
---
I just played against a legion that had the same outfit on Xbox and this shit was happening. Intentional lag from the killer maybe?
---
Thank you. This is what I‚Äôve been asking.
---
Used to think you couldn‚Äôt change any of your perks except for the last one once you equipped them. Really annoyed me, thought it was completely pointless when someone on the forum told me you can deselect perks by clicking on them...oops
---
No, when they say interrupt, it means the survivor needs to be in an action like hook saving, gen repairing, gate opening, or chest searching
---
Yes, this is what happened. He was still in the grab/pickup animation when you threw the pallet, and it ended so shortly after you threw it that he could swing
---
No, you have to interrupt an action like doing a gen, vaulting a window or pallet, or leaving a locker. If they aren‚Äôt being ‚Äúinterrupted‚Äù then you won‚Äôt progress
---
For me, the annoying part about hag is having your camera locked onto her jump scare for a second or two. It makes it really hard to maneuver and has screwed me a few times.
---
This is magnificent, I began using it immediately
---
Yup, and before it was even worse with pipping being dictated by your score. They had a chance to actually make the rank system work decently with the emblem overhaul and fucked it all up again.
---
damaged controllers
---
yeah man. i was chasing this dude for his 3rd hook and the second i hit him he d/c'd like he was looping me with his escape menu already open and ready to go
---
Okay I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm at work and only took a quick peek on break and didn‚Äôt realize that my bad bro
---
I just bought this controller a month ago
---
Big oof. That really shouldn't be a thing lol
---
As far as I know, no. You‚Äôre looking window and pallet vaults, generator repair or hook sabo, etc.
---
Yeah this is true of any horror game. Once you learn the mechanics and understand what to do, the monsters or the villains no longer scare you. The Resident Evil 2 remake (and most older RE games as well) isn‚Äôt scary once you know you can run past most of the enemies. Dead Space stopped being scary about half way through once you built an arsenal. PT, while a great and fun experience, isn‚Äôt scary during a second or third play through once you learn where a lot of the jump scares are. Outlast‚Äôs pop ups and feeling of hopelessness (since you can‚Äôt fight back) are only effective the first time through. 
---
It‚Äôs like the people in this thread have never played a horror game before. The scares are only effective for as long as you don‚Äôt understand the mechanics. Once you know what you are doing and how to counter your enemies, you‚Äôre playing for fun, not for scares. Dead By Daylight is no different. Once you realize you can just run in circles instead of dropping every pallet you see, or be immersed instead of hiding in a locker, the game isn‚Äôt scary. But like no shit, that‚Äôs how horror games work.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen to me, *and* played against it once. What I think causes it is lag during a speed boost. Like both instances it happened, I was hit by the killer and my speed boost from being hit never went away, and I caught up to a bill and hit him and his speed boost stayed the whole game. It‚Äôs very unlucky because there‚Äôs absolutely no way any killer can catch up to it lol.
---
getting a stun doesn't matter. the animation has to be complete, which it seemed to be, though
---
I used to think that people couldn‚Äôt turn fast as killers so when I would juke them and they would hit me I‚Äôd get pissed.
---
I was in an active chase though. Plague was following me the whole time and I had chase music. Not sure what is going on.
---
dropped 1 mil bloodpoints on the plague last night and monstrous shrine came up 12 bloodwebs in a row
---
Eh it‚Äôs funny as fuck
---
Oh god, what have you done to Doctor
---
Sweet
---
Doubt it will be retroactive
---
Level 4 will hopefully be adjusted before launch. These changes are suitable and rather challenging but now reasonable.
---
That's what I was saying also, it looks like it was finished in the clip. Also, it's dumb that the stun wouldn't stop it regardless

If you have one PS+ account with a PS4 set as primary, you can just keep making more accounts on that one subscription. There is no crossplay yet.

... Are you illiterate?  
---
Here's what I actually said:  
---
&gt;"Who on earth would actually want to use Self-Care above the green ranks?"  
---
It's a decent perk for people who are still learning how the game works. You know, people who are at a rank where they cannot rely on others healing them.  
---
Anyone with more than two hundred hours (and I'm being very pessimistic about the average player's ability to learn the ropes in that amount of playtime) of experience knows it's just a hindrance that slows you down more than it's worth, even if you pair it with Botany Knowledge.
---
I guess so. When I was the killer in the situation I was just laughing my ass off because I killed every other survivor and closed the hatch but just couldn‚Äôt do anything about this god damn coughing old ass speed demon. But I can imagine all the try hard killers who would be pissed about it so it‚Äôd be kinda unlucky losing to a bug like that especially if the survivor was toxic about it. The guy who did it to me just apologized post game lol
---
I really don't think you get it. I was unable to do anything, he had hexes pop in my face that he teleported to. I pressed the Input way before I was ever hit or teleported backwards. I pressed the button. And then I was hit and it then it dropped the pallet. I didn't stand there and hit it after I was hit. It appears in that sequence because of the latency that's why the game skips right there. I know it's hard to understand when you are five but maybe one day you will learn .
---
Glad to see some changes but a lot of these would have been fine with better payouts for rift pass progression.  This is the grindiest, least rewarding pass I've personally experienced.
---
I mean, we won the match in the end anyways. Even with the DC we all escaped
---
Looking for people to play on PS4 - EU. Just casual is fine. :)
---
theyre worth a 1000 points thats all i need to hear... its also to counter hex perks which activate later in the game (only noed so far). if there are no totems left, the hex cant activate too.. so in game my prios are, do totems, do 2 gens if possible, go find killer and be chased for a few loops, preferably without getting hooked and open a exit gate. you dont have to go out of your way to find every totem, but if you see any, destroy them
---
I would crouch everywhere. Full-on metal gear stealthy for no good reason.
---
xDDD
---
uh no, it should be a thing. if it wasn't pallet saves would be way too easy and it would be impossible to ever pick up a survivor at a pallet
---
Lol, the final reply from a guy with nothing left to argue with!
---
legit had this game yesterday (i was the key boi, but i went for the save only to find insidious bubba)
---
&gt; Also, it's dumb that the stun wouldn't stop it regardless
---
No, and I explained why in another reply to you
---
Get out Joseph
---
Yeah, I'm fine with that.
---
When i loaded into my first survivor match i spawned next to an Ace,  the next thing he did was cleanse a totem (which i didnt even know what it was) i watched him do it for like 3 seconds and then left him. after i did a gen or whatever i did after i saw a broken totem that looked similar to what the Ace did so i tried to cleanse it but i couldnt of course. So i thought in my head (wait so you need that character to do these skeleton things) :/

Yes it should, you should need to time it correctly. 
---
Last year they actually had an update where you didn‚Äôt need to time flashlight or pallet saves and it was the dumbest thing known to man. Not only did it not make sense, but the animation looked stupid as shit, as they didn‚Äôt drop the survivor until they completed it, even if you threw the pallet ten years beforehand.

You mistimed by a split second. Sucks but it is what it is. It absolutely should be timed though.
---
final reply? you need to get your head out of your ass because this is the first comment i sent you and i was only commenting on you taking the game too seriously because you do
---
The analog stick isn‚Äôt the button I use to run. It‚Äôs the L1 button. The analog stick is just for directional use. But everything works as it should on all of my other games.
---
Dude I'm not saying the perk is good, you don't have to attack me lmao, this guy was bashing the dude for mentioning it when some people do use it
---
Can‚Äôt every killer use survivors being stupid?
---
Part of the problem is you don't get punished enough for doing poorly either.
---
Like really there should be more levels, with "safety pip" being the third or fourth level up above negative pips, then three or four pips above it. Instead they make it so moving anywhere no matter how good or bad you do takes absolutely forever.
---
I use wedding ring on it to see where the killer maybe if it's chasing the obsession.
---
This makes a lot of them way less grindy
---
The trapper ones are still kinda dumb imo. More than 3 traps in one game is way to up to chance
---
they should reduce the number of emblems required then to make up for it, then. it's crazy that the number of gen/pallet breaks was reduced which is mind numblingly easy to complete, but a more demanding challenge that was bugged isn't

I really hope their next pass makes some big changes.  This pass is so poorly thought out.  It's like someone jotted the whole thing out last minute and no one really reviewed it, even though I know that isn't the case.
---
Yeah but this perk mean, the killer need more time because he don't know how to chase ang got 360 everytime with 50 camera sensitivity.
---
I thought going around and throwing down all the pallets was a good idea because then if you vault over it mid chase the killer would *have* to break it. Boy was I dumb.
---
Lol I'm not the illiterate one, you need to learn how to read
---
Hag is just angry black woman.
---
I would love to see these purple and red rank survivors who are using Self-Care. Once again, pal, context matters.
---
What now
---
...You cannot run without pushing the analog stick in a direction. it isn't registering that correctly which is causing the issue. this is extremely common from playing this game
---
I never use it either, but NOED isn't bullshit, it's just bad. If survivors play around it properly (just fucking leave if someone gets hooked), it *might* get you one kill. It only does more than that if survivors are dumb and go for the incredibly risky save. It's only "good" in combination with Bloodwarden, but then you have to play most of the game with only two perks, and hope you get lucky in EGC.
---
Not true, my family member used the hotline and it saved their life from overdosing and they were able to locate where they were to call 911 for them. You really shouldn't go around splurging nonsense. I don't know what you've experienced with the line. But for me I still have that family member to this day because of it.
---
You‚Äôre really talented ! Post more !!
---
So the idea should have been "human players are unpredictable so it's always scary" but instead BHVR went with "tag arcade game with a horror flair"
---
If the game had centered and focused on the horror, it'd be a very different game, and honestly it probably wouldn't have been even nearly as successful, but I'd still love to see a game that's centered around letting players keep the experience scary for other players
---
Only things that count are 
---
Grab injured survivor while vaulting
---
Grab survivor off gen, totem, door or while unhooking
---
Yeah NOED is just a bad perk.
---
Fair enough I suppose. I also read someone else's comment that went more in depth about it, and I got what he was saying as well. I'm just salty about missing it by a split second. I suppose I kinda knew it was timed, being that I never went for the stun when killer was crouching, but I thought ue was completely done by the time I pulled it.
---
.... the L1 button is the button I press to run. As I have stated before, my controller doesn‚Äôt skip a beat on any other game.
---
He technically is low tier, every killer is technically an M1 killer it's their powers that change that fact, just wasting time placing bear traps, not only costs the trapper time, it also is the most unproductive thing he can do. Every second he's running around placing and picking up traps them generators are getting worked on.
---
I know his is the end game, but if no one walks in the traps he has nothing to show for his time spent placing them.
---
so after seeing this, i have to ask where is the line for this game between cool add ons and breaking the terms of service. i assume shit like this, they don't care about, but what about like hud skins or stuff?
---
...Yeah, they're true in the sense that it is accurate to say that those are the kill rates. What is not true is how that person interpreted the stats
---
okay so you're just completely ignoring what I'm saying. nice.
---
enjoy never fixing this issue becasue you refuse to listen to people
---
Love it üò≠ he‚Äôs definitely my main but I have him with the Bouncers Beard and it‚Äôs my favorite
---
Should have had someone at the gate entrance teabagging
---
Bubba being referred to leatherface?
---
dwight mains rise up
---
I didn't know that actually. I've only been playing from a little before ghostface came out, so I s'pose I'm still learning some things about the game lol. That's hilarious about the animation though. Probably super annoying back then, but funny in retrospect.
---
You have more time than you think you do. don't be too trigger happy with it
---
Are you sure? Nice then!!!
---
I've wanted this since he came out
---
That is also true. Like, the 60% kill rate for the Clown, how much of those kills were a fluke? At LEAST 5%, at most 20-30% (I assume)
---
The game is in a state right now where if you know how to loop well you'll almost never die, and if you can't you'll almost never live. It's ridiculous
---
the killer missions right now for the most part are trapper related. which is why basically every trapper you go against just wants to farm for his mission. thats why it says trapper
---
Yeah but still its take to much time to find it. It can be never or he have trill of the hunt in coldwind farm with hillbilly. And he run to his ruin when someone touch it. And killer can always have hex haunted ground
---
Understandable. It was funny back then too because everybody knew how dumb it was, but for killers man, was it annoying. Public outcry made the devs revert the changes back in like a week. Probably the quickest update I‚Äôve seen from them lmao.
---
xD, yes I guess I don't have any specific or proper reply to this question. Actually the others were just there and chit chatting.
---
Is leatherface referred as bubba? Lol
---
Copy pasta in case it's blocked for anybody.

Oh for fucks sake, I'm not saying the perk is good, you dumbass. I'm saying that at the mere mention the guy gets bashed. He was probably joking, which is also what I said in my first reply, and  the one dude took him too seriously. You need to go back to school my guy
---
xD
---
And y'all always say that BHVR doesn't listen...
---
&gt; The game is in a state right now where if you know how to loop well you'll almost never die, and if you can't you'll almost never live. It's ridiculous
---
eh it's a really casual game. even if you know how to play proficiently as survivor or killer, random shit you have no control over can fuck you. just move on.
---
üòÇ Imagine waiting 20 minutes to que, just to have that crap happen to you
---
I wonder what they'll do for Level 4, though?  
---
If I'm not mistaken, there was the same challenge but with 3 unhooks.
---
Sit on a generator? Can you please elaborate.
---
They made it one unhook so that's cool
---
Yeah seen the same thing: I‚Äôve gotten maximum of one per match (even when I‚Äôve got all four iridescent on a 4K round)
---
Bugged for sure
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ seriously
---
Ghost face for ACs and if you want perks, Clown for shards
---
Doctor can do very well each game, even with 0 add-ons. He is more perk oriented... Plague as well if you play her and only load up the disease to one hit she is a drag, if you use the disease as an added bonus and to keep people of regressing gens she can do very well also without add-ons.
---
Doctor: BBQ&amp;C, Hex: Ruin, Unnerving Presence and Distressing  
---
Plague: BBQ&amp;C, Hex: Ruin, Thanataphobia, Dying Light *(the -% on repair, heal and sabotage will fly through the roof, and if they heal away the Thanathaphobia at a fountain you get corruption charge and that levels the playing field.)*
---
No add-on needed but they can substantially make the gameplay easier, better and faster.
---
My friend genuinely thought you had to be NEAR fire to heal with botany knowledge because of the description. I was injured once and he wanted to heal me and insisted I stood next to one of those fiery barrels otherwise his perk ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt work‚Äù. I laughed so hard. He KEPT believing it even after I told him it didn‚Äôt work that way!
---
Umm, that's true that you guys might feel that I would have taken this pic from internet or stuff.. but seriously I haven't. I was so frustrated at the camper killer so just posted to see what people have a view about it.
---
üòí
---
yeah man. i got gen rushed one game as trapper(i never play him so my trapper is still level 1. trying to get all the good teachables before i level anyone else) and the survivors were standing in the exit waiting for me to chase them out and i just placed a trap at my feet and stared at it, and they realized i was doing a "trap x survivors in one game" mission and ran over and gave me my traps. i was so happy cuz my killer queues are like 10+ minutes and every game i am stuck on a trapper mission is a lot of time wasted when i could be farming bp for teachables with bbq
---
Wonder how the chat would've been if that guy died instead of escaping
---
( o_o )
---
Yeah silly me I forgot every other game I play used the D pad to walk
---
ok, I'll not better say what I think because we are gonna get in a buckle of disscusions, but i will say, doctor is shiet...
---
Voted lithe. Not sure but I think it‚Äôll be the one I like most.
---
You should check who this one dude is, because you're still talking to him.  
---
Because I have had to point this out to you, you have now proven that you are indeed (at the very least borderline) illiterate. Congratulations.  
---
I've gotten all I wanted out of you. Any more time spent on you would be a waste for both of us. I appreciate the good laugh you've given me, though.  
---
Good day to you. ‚ô•
---
Wow, I‚Äôm even more impressed since it‚Äôs console. I wish I could use huntress on ps4 :(
---
First week I played Huntress sporadically each time as an M1 killer.
---
You're still not getting it, which is fine. If you want to stutter around in dbd forever that is your prerogative
---
most likely dead hard, but i never use true same build i always try to use different builds each game just to keep it fresh.
---
All the perk i know for slow the game down. Tanatophobia, dying light, ruin, discordance, sloppy butcher, surge. But these perk can slow the game down and you don't need to tap tap or do great skillcheck all time when the killer is the doctor or try to find the ruin and take all the game to find it.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the controller, I‚Äôve been playing dbd with the same controller for almost a year and I haven‚Äôt had an issue
---
Yeah I think this is probably the best way to look at it
---
Depends on the continuity
---
But isn't this against the mechanics of the games? Like against how the game is supposed to be played? 
---
If we go by what you say then a survivor will have only one chance because then the killer will camp around him and make sure he dies :(
---
Agree
---
Yep, doesn't get brought up a lot but that is also an issue.
---
Uh i might buy a few more killers lol since the sale is on a couple more ideas? I kind of was wondering the best ac killers and the best shard killers to prioritize
---
Honestly the only one I found to be super challenging was th
---
Gf and play him without exposing them. Makes him 3rd best killer in the game
---
It‚Äôs a shame, because I really enjoyed balanced
---
I'm at 21 :)
---
Yikes.
---
alpha claudettes meggy look looks so good lol
---
3pm in which time zone?
---
I agree, I want Dwight's pizza sweater on Billy! Also, I **paid** for Neon Nea, I should be able to put it on whatever killer I want!!!
---
Lol you can't continue the argument so you decide to insult me. Very appropriate
---
He he booiiiii
---
Spine chill is great against any killer especially if you are not good at looping. It‚Äôs saved me so many times with the added vault speed and even opening the gates faster. The one time i removed Spine Chill it so happened I was the left person left alive and the killer closed the hatch I was just about to finish opening the gates when the killer turned up and killed me. If I had brought Spine Chill that added boost to opening would‚Äôve saved me.
---
You can‚Äôt go wrong with countering Ghostface Mikey and Pig as well.
---
EGC probably
---
I cannot upvote this enough! I love the bioshock series, and I played bioshock 2 pretty much drill only. It's very helpful against alphas because of its stagger which can let you get off a few shots in between dashing.
---
My first killer was Myers and my second killer was ghostface so I always thought that every killer has to stalk.
---
Okay cool! Whatever it‚Äôs be I‚Äôd like to see! This one you did is really cool
---
Is he because he is annoying to play against? Or becasue you don't know how to play him?
---
He can even stop people from being able to hooksave and vault through windows or over pallets if you learn to use his shock therapy and he switches his modes so fast that he can get a hit directly after the shock when the survivor doesn't even know what is happening and stands there pondering his options.
---
Still more useful than territorial...
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time and I‚Äôve had many controllers and this hasn‚Äôt happened before.
---
outlast speedrunners arent scared of outlast, this happens with every game
---
Entity confirmed
---
*didnt expected a legit hi*well then. Hello! (Lol)
---
Honestly I found most of the challenges not too bad. The only real ones I had an issue with was the unhook 2 survivors during end game which I figured would be very tricky to manage just due to the odds of people getting hooked when that happens, and depleting 8 keys would be annoying but not impossible.
---
Tome 5 update patchnotes:
---
Added a setting to let players link their Battle.net acount
---
Survivors be salty sometimes, since they see camping as a bad move since it makes going for the save a lot harder
---
Uh, no it isn't against the mechanics. It very clearly isn't and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it is.
---
&gt; Like against how the game is supposed to be played? 
---
Again, what is he supposed to do? Wander around for no reason?
---
&gt; If we go by what you say then a survivor will have only one chance because then the killer will camp around him and make sure he dies :(
---
sucks. move on to the next game. it isn't like he's being camped at the very start while 5 gens are still up. context matters
---
*what is the killer supposed to do?*
---
seriously, the game is over. if you want them down, then hook swap.
---
I was running devour hope, the perk to see survivors when a gen is done, NOED and bbq I think.. I killed one and hooked everyone else 2 times and then only protected my totems so they get the gens done fast. I was playing hag and trapped also everything around the gates with all 10 traps
---
Herman has seen things, things a Doctor should never have to see...
---
Mine is catdick.
---
&gt;"Oh for fucks sake, I'm not saying the perk is good, you dumbass."  
---
&gt;"Lol you can't continue the argument so you decide to insult me. Very appropriate"  
---
Okay, *now* I've gotten everything I wanted out of you. The blatant hypocrisy was a lovely little dessert, and I thank you very much for that. ‚ô•
---
they were farming, so they probably were memin around
---
ghostface and pig are great killers
---
I heard you shuffling in a chest miles away
---
Lol you called me illiterate, and I'm supposed to ignite that? After you failed to read half messages?
---
The (You transform plants found around the campfire into tinctures that slow down bleeding) in the perk really messes up new players
---
Cannibal has great teachables in Franklin's and BBQ, ghostface is fun, plague is fun but can be a little iffy with hit registration, demo is fun
---
If you *were* camping, you should know that not only does it ruin people's fun, as you progress through the ranks, good survivors will punish you for camping. You need to patrol the map to apply pressure.
---
So you hate ruin because it benefits the killer? The whole point is to try to put as much pressure as you can at the start of the match. I agree that the skill check input and all that should be fixed but other than that your reasons are dumb
---
Well this sub thinks doing some free weight squats is a game breaking toxic move so it‚Äôs not surprising.
---
He's a Tapp dancer
---
If that's how you really feel you should probably play something easier, like snakes and ladders or even better, ghost town.
---
But isn‚Äôt the purpose for me to kill the survivor? I‚Äôm not in it for them to have fun and idc really about rank...idk what that even is.
---
It's sad, Balancing Landing was my favorite :(
---
The bubba who held the game hostage by spamming M1 to stop the bleedout timer: *Happy bubba noises*
---
Agreed 100%.  Giving Freddy borrowed immunity was the stupidest decision ever.  Okay being fair the decision to remove the timing from Flashlight and Pallet saves for that one week was the stupidest decision ever but this is up there lol.
---
Take the 3rd/4th strongest killer in the game.  One with massive map pressure and an ability that ends chases quick in his snares yet somehow he needed the ability to trashcamp and tunnel survivors off hook risk free?  Shortsighted and dumb af.  And I've seen a sharp increase in Freddy Tunnels since they implemented it.
---
I played nurse as m1 killer, had a hard time catching survivors as you can imagine lmao
---
Spirit with any addons and any perks
---
Yeah, I fell like red rum would be too strong
---
Play killer and play without ruin, games end fast unless you low ranks. It a must higher ranks sadly.
---
Head on with quick n quiet saved me so many times. Too bad it needs to be 2 perks. Wish head on had a no sound when using lockers only built in
---
Thanks for the elaboration bro. Now I totally get it. It was just that I am new to the game and I was like, "What's this! He is not even giving me a chance to get out. So I was frustrated."
---
I usually scream to ham it up aith friends and hag is the only to make me *scream*
---
Nice drawing though bro!‚ô•Ô∏è
---
One DC, it was 3 am, I was tired and they were pretty much dead, so just memin yeah
---
ye but like what happened to illicit that response
---
To be fair, even in the cutscene you see every time you start the game, the guy pulls Claudette away when she wants to go unhook someone lmao
---
I think you meant to say "a wholesome survivor who got to escape so he/she isn't being toxic"?
---
Don't see any of the dead one's saying anything there , so wouldn't call it a "lobby" :D
---
And , judging by them thanking you , seems like you let them escape?
---
As someone who‚Äôs more afraid of audio than visual, I am genuinely afraid when I play against The Pig and The Demogorgon
---
Spirit did not get gutted the same way balanced landing did. Both were needed but spirit maybe not enough.
---
Same here, she‚Äôs great! :)
---
i cant tell you how many times ive man-screamed when i set off that ugly ladys trap
---
Thanks for making it so easy now my grandma can play. Like the only one need to change was the unhook 2 in endgame
---
Usually it's EST
---
I was just playing a normal game if I remember correctly, this screenshot is quite old is I can‚Äôt remember all that well but I know I wasn‚Äôt toxic.
---
Bro I main the hag and I still get scared when I encounter her while playing survivor.
---
No worries. It's understandable 
---
generally i would let that person be saved because I like to try and maximize my hooks, but most people at that point are just sort of ready to let the game end so everyone can move on
---
legion with ruin, monitor and abuse, thantaphobia, and sloppy butcher
---
I always forget that chests make sounds so when I open one and it sounds like a survivor is throwing trash cans around I cry cuz I know the killer can hear it
---
Ohk.
---
Any game will wear off. If you played Amnesia or PT a dozen times a day, eventually it'd be old hat.
---
I love using the wraith add on that lets you see auras and the one that makes the distance of the bell seem like it's always near you. I then watch through a wall and slowly condition them to ignore the bell before finally striking.
---
I don't think it's the controller, IT worker. I feel like I'm always going slower and slower in the game to the point that I feel like I'm running through jello sometimes.
---
You can use it hiding in the closet slowly, to stun and save someone at least
---
I had a high rank die to my legion and he was all "gg ez proxy camper" 
---
I started dying. I walked ACROSS the map to break gens and walked back and the Claudette didn't go for the save.. So he died when I got back and I got called a "proxy camper" 
---
People are just mad that they died
---
Who filled this chest with hundreds of tiny metal trash cans?
---
Got removed when killers were given the ability to close hatch permanently (barring keys) with the addition of the EGC.
---
That lobby wait times would be reasonable
---
Don't be a dick. I'm not saying you *have* to let them have fun, but camping is not fun for anyone.
---
Man I'd burn an Ebony, mori you three and let the rando go just to spite you.
---
clown, he has some of the best perks in the game
---
But aren‚Äôt I suppose to kill them? How am I being a dick, that‚Äôs my objective...
---
Yeah, shame most of them will be wasted with a bubba facecamping me in my first hook, therefore not being to play the "fucking game"
---
I get what you're saying, getting fed up with a game defeats the whole purpose of playing, but sometimes you cant just ignore a problem and "move on", there are other alternatives like fixing the actual problem
---
Nice.
---
I didn't try doing this one yet , but I will be trying it later today after the change to "unhook 1 survivor"  :)
---
I actually was expecting you drawing the predator effect.
---
This is my experience as a shitty killer. Every single game where I dont 4k I have assholes waiting at the gate
---
Its bad play. And bad play leads to disconnects; Leads to toxic troll playing; Leads to no fun. If people put in a tiny effort to let everyone have fun and at least play the game we all have better games. Simple. It benefits you and everyone else.
---
Neither is survivors DCing but killers get points for it.
---
Running, running, running, running.... whos the kil- SNAP!!!
---
SHHHHHHHHH   - IT!
---
3-gen Doctor with Unnerving Presence, Overcharge, Distressing, and Hex: Huntress Lullaby with double calm addons and a jigsaw piece for the Ultimate Dr. Worldwide Experience.
---
But it‚Äôs my objective to kill them...
---
Id love that david head cosmetic, he looks so much better with his default beard
---
These are far more reasonable so great job on listening. If I could make one suggestion though it would be to redesign the tome pathing itself so it‚Äôs more like a spider web and we could activate multiple nodes at once to cut down on players feeling a need to rush challenges and potentially ruin games so they could move on to the next one.
---
Yes put I would rather be doing other challenges for 3 hr then spending it trying to do 1
---
It's definitely scary for Billy and Huntress players.
---
Pardon?
---
Thank you!
---
As long as there is something discouraging people from reposting then I dont mind at all the watermarks
---
&gt;good version of bbq
---
We‚Äôll Make It and We‚Äôre Going To Live Forever should be merged into one perk. Doesn‚Äôt step on any DLC toes that way.
---
&gt;blood point offerings be added post game
---
Wait, what? Don‚Äôt they already do that? It gets added as a post-game bonus...
---
The best one!
---
Your issue is Plague.  I play her too and she is solid and pretty good at killing survivors but the one thing she's horrid at is pipping. The emblem system wrecks her for using her power.
---
*shudder* haha I've run into this build before.
---
I also run it from time to time so I get it. Lol
---
And to get blood points and have fun. Camping and tunneling dramatically reduce those parts of the game.
---
&gt;  In rank 1 specifically, Clown is the lowest killrate killer and he STILL has a 60% kill rate, so "killers being weaker in high ranks" is a lie. 
---
This is a common statistical mistake ("Survivorship Bias")
---
*By definition* red ranks contains only killers that can maintain that kill rate. Anything less *and you drop out of red ranks*, so it doesn't tell you anything about balance other than "there is a group of players that can maintain that kill rate".
---
e.g. even if killers *were* definitely weaker, if you set the kill requirement to be 100%, you would see 100% as the stats for red ranks killers.
---
Excellent changes. Overly grindy or difficult challenges are pointless whek the reward isn't a power increas
---
Yeah, but how am I ever gonna get the lore if I already need a cumulative 40 heals as a survivor? I average like 1 a game, that is insane amounts of grinding.
---
And then you have challenges that do't even work:
---
just double pipped as killer with 3 iridescents, the challenge counted 1.
---
So this is at least 15 games, that is just completely insane
---
As far as I can tell, the iridescent shard still ain't fixed.
---
Remember, she cant see you either. If you know when shes phasing, you can just walk away and she cant do much about it.
---
No respect for the self unhook
---
I must get this
---
While I do appreciate them being receptive, I'm not entirely happy with what some challenges are. It feels like a lot of them are encouraging behavior that many players complain about. For example, I keep seeing people camping the basement for that monstrous shrine challenge, and sacrifice 2 people in endgame using NOED will likely turn out the same way
---
But have you been tunneled?
---
7 amazing survivors looking at each other :wink:

Or just spirit with no add ons and like ruin only because SpIrIt Is UnFuN aNd HaS nO cOuNtEr PlAy.
---
Its like running a haunted house irl. You can't change everything up weekly over even yearly (if it is a gigantic haunt). After a while, some areas are just not scary after you have done them so many times.

---
Nice to see that they heard our feedback and decided to make those changes. Now I just hope that they change the ones for level 4 too.
---
Sure, buddy!
---
Maybe the reason I'm fully done with Lvl. 3 is because I took it seriously? Maybe the quests aren't that hard and if you took 'em seriously and prepared for them instead of posting useless trash on reddit you would be done as well... It's just a theory though!
---
You go on waiting for the devs fixes on those oh so hard quests... that way you got more time spouting your shit all over reddit ;-) I'll be here taking it serious and being proud of that!
---
i dont think most of those needed changes, but that's my two cents.
---
The challenges are hard so more people.buy rift pass tiers (sunk cost fallacy and all)
---
It was a joke about penis size. ‚ÄúHung‚Äù 
---
Seriously though people think they are ‚Äúepic trolls‚Äù for camping on leatherface. In general I‚Äôd just start assuming leatherface is going to camp hooks if you play against one. You‚Äôll be less upset and win a lot more.

It's literally getting fixed in 2 hours and 20 minutes and has been reported.

There are so many old animations that could be fixed
---
Basically 2 and a half hours from now
---
&gt; When we originally planned the Tome and Rift, we had designed it in such a way that you would earn enough fragments from Player XP¬†to finish The Rift by the time you complete¬†all¬†the challenges.
---
This is really important. Those challenges were rediculously grindy, but they apparently made them like that to match how long it would take to get fragments?
---
So by extension, they know getting fragments by xp is rediculously grindy for any person that isn't *extremely* dedicated to dbd, but they did it anyway.
---
Gee I wonder why they did that /s
---
Idk mang sometimes that last gen is the difference between silver/bronze or silver/gold gatekeeper. Usually worth it to look imo but I get you
---
It's your job to kill them, but your responsibility to not act like a dick. Also, replying to every comment in this thread with the same response about how "b-b-but I'm supposed to kill them!" shows how you aren't willing to change your mind, despite specifically asking people to explain something to you

Yeah a lot of the old mori animations are a little choppy
---
Just grind it out mate, it's only 15 games and you got 2 weeks until the lvl. 4 stuff comes along!
---
How *horrible* that people can make consistent progress now!
---
Why should I be in a rush? I‚Äôm enjoying myself :)
---
I like how they would rather DC than get trapped, lol prolly should have left when you were setting the trap up
---
Lmao
---
We would need details of the situation. Quick maths; it's something like 90 seconds for a survivor to die on hook. 80 seconds to do a gen solo. 4 survivors, 5 gens. Sitting on hooked survivors all game is therefore a really bad strategy that hands out too many free gens, and is also extremely unfun for most people involved. At higher ranks you will lose hard for doing this. So yes, your objective is to kill them, but that's going to kill 1 and let 3 escape.
---
However, survivors will often accuse you of camping for stuff like "I saw scratch marks around the hook &amp; moved to prevent the unhook", or "I could see 4 survivors all by the hook, so I had no fear you were doing gens and camped it." 
---
This stuff is often good strategy, it's just playing the game.
---
wow they really haven't changed the noed challenge and made it 1 endgame sacrifice instead of 2?
---
I was seeing how good the photoshop was then ainsly scared the shit out of me
---
Do whatever you want. I will never have to deal with you anyways since you will forever be in low ranks
---
Because there's no reason not too honestly. If I know that BT will be no issue for me 99% of the time, of course I go for that slug value.
---
I don't blame Freddys that do it, I blame BHVR for allowing it.
---
Put yourself in the survivor's place. If you play one game, and the killer stands near the hook when you're hooked for the first time, you die a couple minutes later. Ok, whatever. It happens. Now imagine that happens in most of the games you play that day.
---
People aren't going to play the game if they are just hanging on the hook all the time with no way to get off. Sure, they may need to get better at looping, but when you're new and you're on the hook because the killer is standing in front of you, it's tough to get more experience.
---
Your objective is to kill, and you're not responsible for other people enjoying the game, but you probably wouldn't play a game where you aren't given much of an opportunity to play it because someone else just standing in front of you, or hits you down just after you were unhooked. The game is designed to allow the survivors another chances after being hooked.
---
Who hurt you
---
true, the problem is that the majority of survivors play at runnin the killer and using the loops, its just a small amount of players that go for hiding and mindgaming.
---
what in the game is considered black and white ‚Äútoxic‚Äù ?? i see it getting thrown around a lot but i dont understand why things like flashlight blinds are called it at times.
---
I was planing on just bringing one into a match with no addons and fully depleting it on the spot, they serve no other purpose to me.
---
Play trapper. Trap  one exit gate. Trap the door of the other one. Catch someone at one exit gate. Hook first guy. Camp nearby with insidious. Hook the second guy. GG EZ
---
This is a good start. Making the challenges more accessible will allow people with limited time on their hands to be able to complete the challenges. One thing that should be done is to do multiple challenges at a time, maybe two or three. In each game you are always multitasking especially as survivor, so this change would be awesome.
---
"Shitty" is a strange word for "the best thing ever" but I guess that's accents or lost in translation
---
It isn't. There are chances you'll end up in a lobby without a killer. Happens often actually
---
eh a lot of that emblem is dependent on the first 2 or 3 gens. at this point is likely doesn't matter; they're probably going to pip regardless 
---
it's also the least important one to focus on imo because there are a lot of instances where you have little control over the early gens
---
I'm waiting patiently. I really want a super low cut shirt, one that is only buttoned like two from the bottom.
---
Okay, let's think about this reasonably for a second. The friend had this issue. Then OP had this issue. For this to be possible, the friend would have had to break the controller. Then almost exactly after, OP would have had to break theirs. So, that's two controllers down the drain at the exact same time? I refuse to believe that. It's probably DBD being DBD again.  
---
Also, if you think other games don't have the ability to walk and run depending on the pressure you put on the joystick, don't have kids.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if they made it two. Unless they take away the master challenge and keep it at three
---
Try bloodwarden
---
Stridor: I'm gonna stop u right here.
---
its amazing for looping. i window tech and flashlight tech with it. makes it way easier to mindgame the killer when injured
---
2s not that bad
---
This one made me laugh the hardest!
---
i'm not going to take a casual party game seriously, sorry
---
Of course Claudette has a flashlight lol
---
I know they announced a fix for today, where is it?
---
In Europe it is 18:45
---
Still haven‚Äôt changed it.
---
That's not what copypasta means
---
Meh agree to disagree.  Just because it's in the game doesn't mean we have to stoop to the level of using it.  Anyone that has to tunnel their kills off hook doesn't know how to play killer yet and won't learn how to by doing that.  I still put personal responsibility on the player.  It's up to each of us to decide how we play.  I try to keep things respectable and fair so my opponents are forced to accept their L's.  They can't blame it on me doing cheap babystrats.
---
It took three days to get a single grab off for me as I kept fucking hitting them even when I was rubbing up against them.
---
It‚Äôs not my job to care about the other side, just kill them. I‚Äôll continue to play the objective the game gave me.
---
You should put your emotions aside and realize there‚Äôs no one exclusive way to play the game, with the exception of disconnecting because that will 100% get you soft banned.
---
With the amount of good perks available nowadays I have been using exhaustion perks less and less. Lithe would probably be my choice, but I try to something different every other match.
---
‚Äúrock and roll buckaroo‚Äù is the one I drop regularly.
---
Quentin actually looks better lmao
---
&gt;not loosing the key
---
&gt;yeah my English is pretty good so far
---
This stuff honestly writes itself.
---
There is no rule stating I can‚Äôt camp you. My objective is to kill you, camping is the most sure fire way to do that.

ima be mad that i played leatherface from 1-35 without using those offerings if they really are added in post game because that was torture( but now that I'm playing hag. it feels like the game is easy mode so i guess it made me a lot better)
---
It's not nonsense, I literally have the comment in my profile with countless other people who've experienced the same exact thing as me or even worse and all unanimously agree that the hotline is bad.
---
It's cool your family member got use out of it, but they're the 1%. Many other people have been ridiculed, hung up on, ignored, or simply left unhelped. Thanks for discounting my and many other suicidal people's traumatic past experiences though!
---
That doesn't make any sense. Unnerving Presence makes skill checks harder but opening exit gates don't give you skill checks. Dafuq?
---
haha aww you deleted your newest comment like a coward
---
I'll post my reply anyway:
---
&gt; How many controllers have you broken while playing DBD?
---
Just one, because I found out what I did that caused it and stopped doing it. Again, many, many players damage the analog stick via their wiggling. Seriously, this is extremely common
---
&gt; In order for two people to break a controller at the exact same time, instead of it being a game bug, would only make sense if they had gorilla paws.
---
Huh, OP never said it happened at the same time. So, uh, you may want to abandon that argument of yours
---
&gt; You actually said this. ...You cannot run without pushing the analog stick in a direction. it isn't registering that correctly (because you can use the analog stick to control how fast you walk) which is causing the issue. this is extremely common from playing this game
---
...yes, because it is true. that doesn't mean it's the exact same as other games. it is not. 
---
i know you are on a mission to not get this for some reason I don't understand, but yikes
---
He's one of the best killers in the game and possibly THE best killer in the game without addons (Base Kit Freddy with perks is all you need).  Get him and don't look back.  He stomps SWF groups if you know what you're doing.
---
He a little confused
---
Be wraith and use the add-ons that hide your terror radius after coming out of invisibility and one that silenced the bell. You can pull a lot of people off of gens
---
And again if you have to be grammar nazi to win an argument while insulting . . ., you kind of lost it already ;*
---
Behaviour is a company, they want to get profit over anything else..., they MADE this tome to gain profit, intentionally skewed it and made it grindy to squeeze as much money from their playbase as possible..., if everything was "fine and dandy" they would not have backed down and dile grind down..., there is so much stuff in this game that playbase is very vocal about but they change nothing. . ., I guess you are just to blinded by your rage and tantrums to see it..., I honestly pity person like you that feels the need to insult online, to win an argument lol..., what an internet warrior you are! hahaha
---
But still you are wrong and fact that they are changing it plain proves it ;*
---
The challenges seem so basic. Was really hoping for more than do X Y times.
---
Basically get a 4K is what that‚Äôs telling me
---
fast vaults give the killer notifications obviously i died instantly when I was new
---
Nake sure the gates are never opened; have unnerving presence equipped, yes unnerving presence has literally nothing to do with exit gates. Survivors escaping with the hatch wont fail this challenge.
---
Just put transparent tape on your screen and draw a crosshair.
---
Pro tip right there.
---
Make it distance based, and 16 meters and we have a deal
---
Let me answer you in order of what you said.:
---
How many controllers have you broken while playing DBD? Do you have gigantic gorilla paws? In order for two people to break a controller at the exact same time, instead of it being a game bug, would only make sense if they had gorilla paws.
---
You actually said this. Here is your exact quote. It seems you don't know how games are played.
---
*  ...You cannot run without pushing the analog stick in a direction. it isn't registering that correctly (because you can use the analog stick to control how fast you walk) which is causing the issue. this is extremely common from playing this game
---
* because other games don't use the analog stick in the same way
---
Most games actually do use the analog stick the same way. DBD included. You are wrong.
---
The logic does apply. A game bug could cause the game to stutter. It actually stutters ever since the new update. The game freezes every time an action is completed and this is likely why they feel this way. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA. I pressed reply by accident, strong man on internet. Coward I am not.
---
This is precisely the sort of quality content I thrive on.
---
Chose a different challenge then. Unless that‚Äôs the last one you have nothing says you can‚Äôt do something else. Long of the short, TLDR, stop crying about the game on reddit. It will get fixed in time. Just enjoy the time you get to play and be happy there‚Äôs a game like this we can share together.
---
But its for the trappers lore so I assume it means unnerving which is one of trappers teachables
---
Entity face reveal
---
God. Now I have more to reply to. Okay. Let me crack into this.
---
You can disable auto-reading, if it's being a nuisance
---
They probably mean it in the stupid sense that Unnerving gives you a larger terror radius and people will run away when they hear your heartbeat.
---
You mean it isnt because it's damn near impossible to get people to step into traps normally without them popping every single one beforehand? üò±
---
...I only ever just used that to run away...you just gave me a lot of ideas.
---
I let EGC to kill me. I was pointing on hook and wanted killer to kill me but he didn't do it. So I just waited.
---
I threw down the jungle gym pallet if a generator was there for defense
---
I‚Äôd started playing well after the DS changes, but I‚Äôd remembered seeing players juggle against old DS as killer in videos. I proceeded to do so like an idiot when I first played killer until I realized that‚Äôs no longer a thing.
---
Looking for friends on ps4 Reaping-beauty16. I main meg but don't mind running as killer
---
Yeah true but it doesn't make sense when looking at what the perk does. If it was something like ''Make survivors fail skill checks x amount of times using the perk Unnerving Presence'' it would've made a lot more sense.
---
Do a generator, you have all the time
---
A lot of the time people dont leave they just get disconnected
---

---
Old Dwight?
---
They already announced the fix, why are still posting these?
---
Very stealthy meme there, bud
---
But I see what you did there.
---
Then the bame wouldn't make sense. It definetly means Unnerving, even if unnerving has nothing to do with exit gates
---
Part of me knows this is a joke, another part of me hopes you‚Äôre joking.
---
Imma try to 4k and see if it counts, I'll update you
---
Like I said, you can play how you want. Just don't be surprised if you continue to receive messages, that's all.
---
Yh don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs a joke u may rest easy
---
dwigt main here
---
If your self-defined objective is to kill, 1 kill out of 4 is fulfilling your self-defined objective badly. It's as simple as that.
---
LMAO. Once, at the beginning of match, I kept gesturing for my team mate to come over and do the gen with me and this team mate started gesturing frenetically for me to go to his side (there was no gen on that side) and I got really confused, until I noticed Ghostface was literally right behind me, crouching, with his face on my butt, waiting for me to notice it. I almost shit my pants. I bet that Ghostface laughed so hard at me
---
Thank the Entity.
---
Also glad they fixed Iridescent Age. Having to do 15 trials to finish it is kind of insane.
---
Meg want their box challenge :(
---
[https://youtu.be/Pm2FBVvu2ro?t=81](https://youtu.be/Pm2FBVvu2ro?t=81)
---
I ended up getting it done as leatherface but the game dragged on so long because one guy dcd after I downed him and the other suicides on hook.  I wouldnt hook the last 2 guys while they were on death hook so they thought I was memeing.  (especially as I was playing leatherface, but he has the easiest potential more me to one hit people and slug them cause noed is most likely going down) 
---
I spent the majority of the second half of the game trying to corral them to my ruin (which is needed to slow the game down enough to get everyone 2 hooked) and shaking my head and smacking them when they would follow me around instead of doing gens. 
---
Finally game is over and I about had a heart attack because the bill still had unbreakable and I had already opened the exit gates so I had to chase him down again before the nea died on hook and triggered the hatch that he knew the location of and I couldnt camp hatch because I already opened the exit gates. It wasnt a fun game.
---
I see u, Ainsley.
---
That's Distressing.
---
from what I was told many moons ago 
---
the title screen isn't locked at 30fsp    {Idk  how true this is and how it would affect the ps4 sorry} 
---
funny thing is it's been raining all week and I just flip the ps4 so the hot air blows to me while I play to keep warm \^\_\^
---
As a Jake main I agree.
---
Do other challenges while you wait? Lol
---
Bloodwardeb yes lol
---
These lazy killers are gonna force BHVR to have to stop the struggle timer when the killer is in camping radius. If you want a survivor to die you can‚Äôt just sit there and drool; get to work.
---
Yes 4king did work
---
Time zones, what is that.
---
90% of the time it‚Äôs not intentional, you do know that?
---
Camping the basement with Insidious, monsterous shrine, barbecue, and distressing on Leatherface
---
It‚Äôs quite clearly a joke, and anyone who can‚Äôt tell that is either severely mentally challenged, or knows and is being an idiot. I‚Äôm leaning towards the first option due to you response.
---
Jane is the best survivor you degenerate she is not bad
---
Which is actually kinda the only reason her traps work. People trap corners so you swing into walls. 
---
I feel like it was either that or a brief moment of being "frightened" and not moving, which would probably get old
---
i know a lot of it isn't intentional but to now be disconnected from 6 games in a row ü•¥
---
They move faster and move freely.  If you as a survivor are just hiding when they get near you you're just giving them a free pass to shut it on you.  You gotta book it and hole you find it first OR hide and take your chances with the door.  
---
Also often they simply notice its location during the game while chasing or patrolling.  They just head straight there as the 3rd is dying and stomp that bitch shut possibly in your face if you're there too.
---
I'm so happy to see Ace love. My friends just love to call Ace a back alley drug dealer. I just love his purple glasses.
---
Fantastic idea
---
Spirit has a similar problem to legion.
---
They both have abilities that have very little counterplay, so the second something works it becomes op
---
If they nerf spirit how you guys are suggesting, she falls to low tier (and we need strong killers that arent freddy or nurse)
---
If they leave her the same everyone else is unhappy.
---
The nerfs shes been given are likely the best they can do without gutting her.
---
Awesome.
---
1/4 is still bad.

Jane üòç

looks like they got mori‚Äôd, how tragic

No they got picked up at the end

Looks like a young Julian from trailer park boys.

---
The Nurse. Her rework only made it harder to play her, didn't change her skill ceiling at all
---
So you let the entity lick the food but not eat it? Okay lol
---
Or get exit gates side by side and camp there.
---
You did miss a years worth of survivor nerfs during your hiatus.  Playing killer is a lot easier and more fun now than it used to be so you probably are seeing more players wanting to play killer than you did when you last played.
---
Are you trying to get into a match as killer? If so a lot of people are playing killer right now because of the archive challenges. I've been having a hell of a time finding a match as killer lately, too.
---
It's getting easier. Removing the single trial condition in EGC challenges should be looked at IMO. With this, I guess T4 challenges will also be adjusted.
---
Basement trapper could be fun but I would say it's all based on luck because you can't exactly play around the basement if it has terrible placement.
---
And if you stay while the entire SUV team is sitting in the open then you're a camping asshole
---
&gt;Mag
---
I mean... A minute probably? Sometimes less. Just learn the spawn placements, it's really not that complicated. Also hitting great skillchecks is really not that hard after bagillion games with Ruin. Actually, Ruin trained me to hit greats even if this perk is not in play.
---
Have not seen Thrill of Hunt in a while except for occasional Spirit games. But people usually DC in those, so it never mattered. 
---
If he has Haunted grounds, then it's just a risk you have to take, that's all. Basically trading killer's perk for one hook, eh. 
---
Also if killer keeps on humping his totems - that is a free win for your team. He never engages in chases, never patrols gens, just concerned about two perks, that eventually will be broken.
---
I‚Äôm no camper, there is no need to worry
---
so exactly the same from today
---
In the case of the non-master challenges they're designed to be grindy to basically encourage players to play a lot of matches so that they'll theoretically grind out to level 70 without feeling like it was that much of a grind outside of the challenges.
---
Master challenges are the only ones that really give any form of creativity, but a lot of them are on the safe side so you're not forced into a wildly different playstyle.   That and these tomes mostly revolve around Claudette/The Trapper lore-wise so a good chunk of the challenges are built around healing or trapping.
---
I'm not complaining that they reduced some of the grindy ones but atleast they are doable and really didn't need to get nerfed.
---
Empty that stock like you are a war veteran's retirement
---
It is a cool skin, ket‚Äôs be honest
---
Jews I see you are more of a gentleman then Jonathan Joestar
---
If you want to get technical about it, you get scored on defending gens, hooking survivors, sacrficing survivors and chasing survivors. You essentially do very little of this just camping. 
---
This is ignoring the fact that funwise this ruins the game for others and is quite frankly boring for the killer to boot. They just stand there rather than actually outplaying and chasing the survivors. 
---
I'll leave it at that though, you clearly want an argument, if you want to camp and ruin the game for others fair enough.
---
Can we talk about how bad the narrator is? The pacing always feels too rushed whenever he reads the tomes.
---
I like how you quoted the source in the quote haha. Haven‚Äôt seen that in a very long time.
---
Please understand that most of the perks that you have named, except Sloppy Butcher and maybe Franklin's, require a specific playstyle. They are not as bland and simple as Ruin and actually require a strategy, read - extra effort. 
---
- Thana will require players to spread the love and injure at least 3 survivors to be effective. 
---
- Dying Light requires chases to be ended quickly in order to get early hooks, when the gen speed still matters. 
---
- Pop Goes the Weasel is now used with Ruin in most of the games. If it does not, it requires... well... let's just say that it requires less of a hook pressure and more of a gen pressure. Most people prefer to play it safe and... apply a hook pressure.
---
- Discordance and Surveillance require you to make a decision about certain gens, to have a good knowledge of the game so you would know which gens to sacrifice and which has to be kept unrepaired whatever it takes. 
---
- You know, even Sloppy - who even heals nowadays? Most survivors, me included, ignore it simply by pressuring gens, because it's a better way of using time. 
---
Those are all good conditional perks. Strong in a certain situation and with the steady effect, if used correctly.
---
Ruin is an RNG perk. Can be strong, can be useless. 50/50. I use it as a killer all the time. Sometimes it wins the game for me. Sometimes I get good teams, who does not care about this totem. Sometimes it is destroyed instantly. It's a risk that I am willing to take, because for the most part I don't want to think of a certain strategy while playing killer. I want a quick bandaid. If I want something extra, then I go with different perks and setups.
---
No problem
---
One survivor dead and three at the gate t bagging is not valid strategy
---
Those survivor ones are actually some pretty neat ideas! But I think the first two killer ones could be cheesed by letting a survivor get away inentionally :P
---
yeah, I knew. They're still gonna be annoying but not as bad as I thought. I overreacted, my bad
---
Imagine Trapper smacking your head into trap or wraith ripping of your skull like in his backstory
---
Do you know what's childish and pathetic? People can't tell the difference between a video game and real life. It's supposed to be a game where you play for a few hours a day and have fun. Did you meet toxic people? So what? You just move on and don't go on the internet with pitchforks and torches and demanding random people you've never met respect. Y'all worse than those so-called "victims" and "virtue signalers" on twitter. We get it, your daddy and mommy told you were special and you found out you weren't and now you feel like the world owes you something, but no, no one owes you anything. You. Just. Move. On.
---
is this safe to use?
---
What it sounds like is buying the nightmare edition gives you the base game (obviously) which has trapper, wraith, hillbilly, meg, Jake, dwight, and claudette.  You also get doctor, has, feng, ace, and a handful of cosmetics from it being the console version. Nurse and huntress are available for free.
---
What seems special about it is that you get clown, spirit, kate, and adam, and also steve, nancy, and the demogorgon.  You also get the head case which is just a few more cosmetics.
---
Since you already have clown and spirit it depends on which DLCs you want and the cost of the nightmare edition and if you already own the game, which i'm assuming you do.  I would buy the DLCs you want during the sale, since if you buy the nightmare edition you get a second copy of the game and clown and spirit again, which is a waste.
---
LMAO @ those downvotes. Some people just can't accept criticism.
---
Dude hag jumpscares will never fail to make me crap my pants. What's worse is when you know an entire area is trapped and her jumping screams STILL make you jump and squirt a lil brown
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. The text feels somber and hopeless and the narrator is reading at 1000 words per minute.
---
Well curtain call and shattered bloodline are the dlcs for both clown and spirit but I‚Äôm not sure about the rest
---
Imagine using the flashlight which the devs put it to stun/blind the killer. How dare you do that?
---
Which makes the bloodweb cost more points, either way I'm losing.
---
I had to do what was necessary... MORI
---
6 grabs is fine, it isn't in a single trial...
---
Than there is 2 SAFE endgame hooks IN A SINGLE TRIAL.
---
Like everyone said just run unnerving and make sure no gates are opened. You could literally 4K with no gens finished and it counts
---
It's prestige 1/3, one perk costs 6000, the other costs 4000.
---
Its not that hard, running a different build for a game or two for a challenge is to be expected
---
Legion isn‚Äôt too bad because although the mend doesn‚Äôt count at least usually he just runs around injuring people so there‚Äôs plenty of injured people to heal. Usually you only get injured people to heal after they get hooked and unhooked. The only game I got more than 1 heal was a Legion game where I got like 4 because he‚Äôd always just go for the closest target.
---
That's the entity
---
That looks awesome OP!
---
But the thing is the tag aspect is far more fun than what a typical horror game would provide. Most horror games want you to be stealthy to avoid the monsters lurking and while that might be fun as a survivor, it's fucking *boring* as killer. Nobody would wanna play killer because it'd just be like playing the guard in a Metal Gear game: mindless patrolling hoping you find something
---
I love the nurse portrait
---
why distressing tho
---
What's so strong about Freddy? I suggested adding proper sound cues for silent survivor actions and giving spirit a tell that she's phasing, allowing for actually skullful outplays even though you can't see the survivor.
---
Increased bloodpoints in deviousness so it goes with insidious
---
The crossover I never knew I needed !
---
Mint rag hag with make your choice, agitation, iron grasp, and it doesn't matter the 4th perk, but can be ruin, or franklons if you are being toxic. One man in the basement = win. Either that guy is abandoned and dies, or everyone dies.
---
He‚Äôs speaking the language of the gods
---
Unless chases were more dynamic but yeah that's basically the reasoning. I've had ideas where killers set up elaborate traps and know where the survivors are at all times, but the goal is to through survivors off because they can fight back, so killers have to out mind game them. I think that'd be really fun
---
That would be good, she would need something like that if she had a tell.
---
Freddy has a ton of pressure, can end chases quickly, and he can slow gens to a crawl by existing.
---
Just to add onto this, when Oni comes out you can run nemesis for some devastating results
---
NO RESPECT!
---
I like how Jane just gets into a locker as soon as she hears .000000001 second of a heartbeat.
---
Monstrous shrine is fucking Lego heads
---
if ruin gets found fast u lose, if not u win. this game is only balanced around rng.
---
I don't see any killer's achievment
---
hehehe
---
1100 hours in and prayer bead Spirit, T1 Mikey, and Ghostface still occasionally give me jumpscares lol
---
I don't really get it. The optimum would be for most people to get FAR into the Rift (to justify them paying for it) but not 100% it (so they don't completely get all their money back). As it is, it's too grindy, and a lot of people obviously wont pay at all.
---
Whichever one gets most invites is who I am buying next
---
Cannibal has some of the best perks in the game, and i had alot of fun with him, i bought him like a week ago, i hated him because i thought he was weak, but he's not that bad, his chainsaw is alot of fun, actually. But definitely one of the 3 weakest killers, but his perks are really good.

Changed to 3 hooks, and it‚Äôs only 1 unhook now. Well in 1 hour 5 minutes from now. Check twitter
---
Well, I was dared to do adept Meg, but Adepts is something I rarely do. I suppose Spirit is up next. I'm close to "A Feast For The Entity". As a killer main, I am ashamed to not own it yet.
---
But, to be honest, I was playing ALOT of survivor until I bought le Spirit. So, I guess that explains that.
---
\*cries in console player\*
---
I got it done with spirit. I hooked someone when exit gates were powered (but I had downed them before they were so no NOED popped up). I hooked them and then opened the gates myself to trigger EGC.
---
She killed herself on hook and I found a nearby david to NOED dowwn and kill because he was deathhook at that point.
---
If ur going to replace it in ur main build with another exhaustion perk, that has to be DH. Before the nerf it was between these two; SB is a shitty timewaster since it forces u to walk in order to keep it for a chase, lithe is decent but more situational and works with specific builds, head-on is for trolling.
---
What's the rest of ur build btw?
---
Are you serious? If so, that's hilarious. If not, it's a hilarious idea.
---
I have tons of fun camping because they hang around trying to save their friend and failing.
---
You have to teabag as a lil hello when you meet your teammates. Most important: you have to teabag after a survivor saved you from hook or healed you
---
To say tank you if you dont do this you are fckng evil
---
Explain this build to me? Impossible Skill Check Doc sounds like the perfect solution to the games I've been having lately
---
Ace is a sexy beast
---
if u like the basement get leatherface
---
Nah. And they‚Äôre reworking them anyways because everybody complained. So much for being all about that money.
---
If they can't figure out a way to make compelling challenges that don't fuck up the balance of the game, then maybe they should reconsider why they are further monetizing dbd with the battle pass.
---
It seems like they just added it cause everyone else was doing it, even though people are sick of them and they're kinda on the way out.
---
I didn't mind the grindy ones too much. That just took time, but you could generally make progress each game.
---
The ones that I don't like are the in-a-single-trial ones.
---
I might get Christmas money so who should I buy with it?
---
Freddy Krueger

Yikes I love how you just gloss right over "or other material"

This belongs on r/boneappletea

Also looking at your post history you started the game like 3 months ago. I‚Äôve been playing since 2016. You don‚Äôt know more about the game and playing killer than I do, I can guarantee it.
---
Yea but it doesn‚Äôt stop him from speaking immediately when you open the archives
---
I will onounce the winner and record it
---
Don't be ashamed bro, I just got "A Feast For The Entity" and I'm only about 20-30 hours under you

Myers is pretty scary for my group of friends. Turning left while on a Henry just to see his creepy ass staring me down is always good for a few jump scares.

Until i played killer, i didn't know about scratch marks, or at least how they worked. I thought the killer just had some perk or ability that helps with tracking, so I'd just sprint everywhere, and wonder how the killer knows where i went when I'm dodging through buildings.

I like it and super appreciate it, actually. He keeps the mood with his tone and relative pace. If he made his absolute peace slower I'd turn it off and skim, myself. This way I can appreciate the narration and not spend 5 minutes on an entry.

I like a lot of her other cosmetics, like belle of the Ball &amp; her new one from the Archives.

I really love writing in depth stories of fictional characters, and Ace has been one of my favorites. He's bursting with personality, and although he's a trickster, he crosses me as someone who would take a hit for a loved one.
---
He definitely had a really rough upbringing, and I think it molded him in a very specific manner. He had to do whatever he could to survive and work his way out of the slums of Argentina and all the way up to the states on his hard work alone. Yeah, his methods weren't always the most honest, but when you're smart and crafty, you do what you can to survive.
---
I hope you're joking
---
I really love wholesome interactions like this. I played against a Demo the other day while solo queueing and had amazing teammates (Who actually did gens!) and we put up a really good fight but ultimately got 4K‚Äôed and after he complimented our teamwork and looping and we complimented how much map pressure he had and that the game was super fun and exciting. I‚Äôve been working really hard on my chases and looping recently so to hear the killer say that I gave him a run for his money was really nice to hear.
---
In rank 4 where I am camping usually equals a safety pip. Thus viable in red ranks. It isn't a game losing strat at the moment. It is viable.
---
Legion 3 gen on a small map is aids late game.

I felt like the purple rank is the purgatory, it‚Äôs getting harder to get a pip

Hey. I still believe that the reason Bubba is so bad is because he doesn't practice between matches. He's too busy baking those gruesome gateaus and whipping up survivor puddings for the other killers to make sure they stay healthy and strong
---
You're right.
---
You can see it in her thighs and hips
---
**muffled cheering from behind the mask**
---
I mean, even when looping, my heart‚Äôs still racing. Like, if I vault or throw down a pallet, will the killer still hit me from 8 feet away even when they get stunned? Who knows? ^*heartbeat races*
---
Trapper because i like to when my 200 IQ traps work
---
The premise for the characters is more intriguing than the other killers. I think the idea of multiple people being a legion of killers is fascinating. There was a time when Dead by Daylight was quite popular and competition from other developers and fan projects would pop up sometimes. Everyone remembers Friday The 13th, but one I remember pretty well was The Slashers gamemode for Garry's Mod. That gamemode featured characters from "You're Next!" and I think The Legion is essentially exactly what I wanted when I saw that movie and played The Slashers. I still wouldn't mind seeing those killers from "You're Next!" to be added but I love the idea of The Legion nonetheless.
---
Safety is generous and not the norm for camping anywhere near reds.  But I'll indulge you.  You aren't playing to win a game a safety is a tie.  That still doesn't make it viable if your strategy either creates a tie or drops you in rank.  If you can't rank up with it it isn't viable.
---
Still, I'm a hundred away... so...
---
But okay, maybe "A Feast For The Entity" wasn't bad enough
---
On PS4, I have this achievement. Mind you, it was before the change the ranking system.
---
I still don't have the Legendary Killer achievement. Now, let me explain why.
---
The highest I've even gotten is rank 3. I'm currently rank 4.
---
At this rank, I just stop playing because the game just becomes so boring to play because Flashlights, Brand New Parts, Syringes etc. 
---
I'm aiming for rank 1 this season, but, being an old Freddy main just completely sucked the fun out of the game. I still love the old Freddy, always will, but he, truth be told, had no chance. Pig, same thing. I didn't know how to play her properly. Obviously Legion didn't work. Certainly not Wraith. I could easily do it with Freddy now however. But, I'm new to Spirit, I'm really enjoying her, so I'm gonna make it a challenge to reach rank 1 as a baby Spirit...
---
(And I just wrote an essay about why I don't a have an achievement. I'm not just wasting my time, I'm wasting my life...)
---
The entity? He's all for them spooks.
---
I just realized Oni has a picture of himself on his t-shirt. What a Chad. Nice work btw!
---
You don‚Äôt need the 4K, they can leave through hatch
---
excuse me this allows you to bank bloodpoints for the next chapter. I have ~250k BP banked and I havent even started Tome 3.
---
No it wasn't, you're just reaching now. The syntax of your sentence does not elude to that in the slightest. *"Again, never said I was the one bashing my head against it."* Does not in anyway construe to what you're now trying to imply. It doesn't make sense, because the first time you said something would be impossible to infer you corrected me prior to, as it would've been the **first** time. Which was the following sentence, "I mean i guess if you enjoy slamming your head against a wall repeatedly like that, it does at least explain the brain damage." I believe you're trying to say you felt like you had to inform me on the third time. But you also didn't inform me, you poised it as a rhetorical question, and forgot the question/exclamation mark after "brain damage." So the first time was a rhetorical question, second time was another rhetorical question with a statement about the difficulty of bashing your head against a wall. Now the third time was the only time you said you weren't bashing your head against a wall.
---
Well that is just a dumb statement. Repetition is needed when cocky asshats measure once and cut twice. However my acknowledging that you said something twice is myself not understanding?
---
Wish Jeff would stare at me like that irl ;-;
---
This stopped being an ‚Äúargument‚ÄùWhen you quit using logic.
---
B-b-but your breaking rule #33649263-b of the Survivor's Killer Rulebook!
---
It reads as stated:
---
"All killers must take obvious bait chases no matter of the circumstance. If they don't, they are a bad killer and must be flamed in the endgame chat for being a "camping asshole"."
---
I'm going to get BHVR to permaban your existence!!!!
---
God damn, that was too perfect..
---
Not the most recent, but far left isn't wrong. Why would i want to play a killer whos just a fat clown that throws bottled farts and does nothing else
---
sorry lad I don't understand, what is lucky perk and qnc? also what is it that they're changing about it
---
I assume you wouldnt need to claim then if all challenges were active at once
---
I play on PS4 so I use my right pinky for r1 and index for l1

Oh god please stop I can only get so erect

thats how i did it so yeah

yep
---
quick N quiet + lucky break
---
Lucky break isn't in the game currently, its a new perk from the new survivor. While your injured you don't drop any blood for 120 cumulative seconds. So if your hit, and use the houdini build, you leave no scratch marks, blood, no vault sound and no injured noises.

It's bugged. It's gonna be fixed in the time changes that should be coming today.

Every match IS a different experience. What you're describing is the outcome of any competitive game. People are going to play the optimal way and eventually that becomes the routine you are familiar with.

The game is only a looping simulator if you are constantly getting caught, it's a lot more fun sneaking around and narrowly avoiding the killer than it is running to pallets constantly.

Head On activates Nemesis, so you will still have the same issue with it.

To be honest, I feel like people watch him because he's the middle ground between playing flashy for content and playing fairly. Because out of other YT'ers who post content like him I feel like he doesn't come off as cocky but rather confident in his ability which can backfire horribly which just makes him funny. But I can understand where theres a fine line between confident and cocky, I just hope that if he isn't your taste theres at least a YT'er you enjoy.
---
holy shit nice, thanks for the advice. Also do you think is there a survivor who is best for stealthy? I'm using the meg atm because she's tiny and small, not sure if this kind of stuff does matter tho
---
I mean, I'm not the one still slamming their head against a wall. Probably should get that brain damage checked out.
---
Just gonna quickly steal that
---
Was this tested, if so ouch
---
Honestly, the master challenges I didn't even care for the difficulty or anything (just personally)
---
but it was the ones that were so grindy like "Unhook 25 Survivors" "Hook 15 survivors in the basement" etc

It just made me do things like Hook farm people with BT or use 4 basement perks because I got so frustrated with having to play 10000 million matches to beat those grindy challenges (that didn't even unlock lore)

Spirit is great for satisfaction. Trust me. Getting your phase exactly right, and getting that hit. Using the charge speed add ons makes you feel like the Lightning McQueen meme "I am speed". Just know that she is bugged atm. Sometimes, her phasing sound will play regardless of whether your in her terror radius or not. 
---
Freddy is my main, always has been since late 2018. I love him to bits, support him at every oppurtunity. He's basically my "I just got wrecked, here, take my fucking Freddy and die" character. I have all perks lvl 3 on him, P3, yadi yada, I won't keep on "flexing", even though that was not my intention. He's a very good killer, higher than Billy for sure. But, he's boring. And that's why I miss the old Fredd... I won't even start. But he's boring. He really is. Place a snare or two at a loop, back pedal, make the survivor run into it, and swing at them and get the hit. Rince and repeat. 
---
Piggy, I never truly got into. I had a small phase with her. I didn't really enjoy her as her playstyle just wasn't what I was looking for. But, if you ever feel like playing Piggy, check out scorpionZ on Twitch, he's an amazing and very skilled Piggy main.
---
Legion. The killer I get the most questions about. I liked Susie, I hated Legion, but I guess I just wanted Susie on my profile. I have her at P1 50 atm, and I'm never touching them again. They are the simplest of killers, and they're boring. Easily the killer I want a rework for the most.
---
And that's where my list ends. Clown, I've only ever played one round with, I played like a donkey and therefor I have a weird look on Clown. He's weak, but I do respect people who main him regardless. Billy, I completely suck at. I keep on doing a 180 every time I launch my chainsaw, and then I get booli'd in the after game chat. 
---
There's alot of great killers to choose from, with many different playstyles. Try Freddy, I'd say, since your enjoying Clown. Similar playstyle, but Freddy being an all around stronger killer. But hey, it's up to you. But just know that not everyone needs to have a main killer/survivor or main killer/survivor side. Many people just play whatever, and don't take sides in arguements. Truth be told, play whatever killer/survivor you want to play as.

You will get more up votes if you break up your text a bit.

oh yea, that as well

Also, event cosmetics are going to be released to everyone on the 3rd with the new chapter as far as I'm aware :)

Stay hidden. Being in the open opens you up to being revealed. GF is inconsistent but you need to remember that you‚Äôre not myers. You can be revealed.
---
I'd run that omg
---
So hes just an m1 killer with average perks?
---
If that was true, then I wouldn't get scared from shit that's actually scary. What isn't clicking here? The fact that because you idiots still get scared of trapper means I'm wrong for wanting the game to be scarier. That's what doesn't make any sense.
---
Understandable, I do concepts for killers and survivors too and I think the hardest part is coming up with original perks that either isn't similar to other perks or aren't under/overpowered. Still I do like most of it especially since the Shining is my personal favorite Stanly Kubrick film and one of my favorite Stephen King adaptation.
---
Eastern.
---
Yes I know that you have 4 perks per web but you are only allowed to claim 2 of those. The entity eats a perk for every time you claim a perk.

---
Ah that's what you meant. Then yeh u right, my b dawg

Then he would have cancelled it and hit her and slugged her

it says in the perk. Flashlights, pallets, or lockers.

Wait really? When I looked for a dev‚Äôs opinion on it, Peanits said it would be too difficult and that it was on the ‚ÄúBottom of their priority list‚Äù. This was back in August, so their opinion might have changed since the Mobile and Switch release. I really hope so. I‚Äôm not sure if I should just move to PC or stay on console and hope they add it so I can move to PC.

That was happening to me all day yesterday. I'd sneak up to a gen as Ghost Face and have the grab prompt on my screen but every time I tried grabbing someone the animation would play for a second then cut itself off and let the survivor get away.

Used to be spine chill, resilience balanced and either adrenaline or ds, however the main thing about this build was abusing intimates. Dead hard‚Äôs a bit meta tho, and SUPER buggy
---
This happened to me too but I played Pig
---
It's been like that for as long as I can remember, it's really inconsistent and if I had to guess it's probably a desync issue, not much to be done about it as far as I know.
---
ghost face and demogorgon are really fun, but if you are looking for perks get leatherface. oni looks fun but i would ask someone who has access to the ptb before you commit to him.
---
Legion needs a new power
---
I legitimately almost leaked my pants with excitement, then I realized it was a meme.
---
Yeah, no. Because you‚Äôre the only person that exists on this planet, and every situation you‚Äôve ever experienced and handled should be dealt with the same exact way by everyone else. There you go.
---
shhhh the devs will hear you a nerf it to an oblivion
---
Some of the maps would also need to be much bigger as well
---
Give them hatch and give up his adept? Hell no
---
I tried watching AaronPlaysTV but he is just so goddamn toxic. Always moonwalking, flashlight spamming, tbagging, and just annoying in general
---
SHIT it‚Äôs gone now! temporary immortality ;( I swear though I know 100% I equipped it for three games in a row and sadly, never escaped, but I still had it! but my game just crashed for a moment after leaving the leaderboard screen and its not there. Rest In Peace, once immortal toolbox.
---
That guy seems like a huge bitch

---
No sir
---
RNG in DBD is a joke in general.
---
I mean you can stalk people but don‚Äôt over do it.  Your power gives no terror radius or red light so it‚Äôs hard for survivors to know where you are at in at certain areas/loops. Stalking is ok but you have to kinda pick and choose when to do it
---
they use it to be completely quite because no mither is 50 percent
---
I have pretty decent internet so you never know with dbd
---
Meta perks like adrenaline and dead hard kinda cover that.
---
The survey got tweeted out on 12th November, you might be able to find screenshot examples of the question but I remember atleast one asking how important it is cross progression is implemented :)
---
I'm a PS4 player but if cross progression was a thing I'd play a lot more on PC!
---
And I thought he was a cool guy from watching him on yt before...

You are able to change your psn gamertag, Just go through settings. I think the first time is free or something like that

At least no one is gonna have to play 15 games to get 15 emblems now. That was pretty terrible to have to endure.
---
Literally impossible as a solo survivor
---
Igram ja na PC, kako se na steam zoves, ja stalno trazim sa nekim da igram odavde, ali niko od mojih prijatelja ne igra.

Sounds like every game of DbD tbh..
---
Same thing happens to my pc and ps4 pro, except the ps4 pro is like 5 times louder than my PC during the loading screen.

Just for the title you deserve my upvote

nah. he's an arse to indie devs. critique them, but don't pick on them and bully them for trying. he's a dick in general as well. I enjoyed him for a few days and then he got unbearable.
---
Trapper main here, hit rank 2 yesterday, I am here to say that its about 50/50. If the survivors play well, it really does feel like that first picture, except I'm not in the exit gates, I'm chasing someone who isn't hurt and the trap is on the other side of the map, and yes the exit gates are open XD
---
Matches like that I feel like I always have someone staring at my butt crack while I place my traps.
---
Half baked mechanics like actual looping and constantly hitting skillchecks.
---
I'm literally going to buy legion bc of this comment. I know they're not great but I love the cosmetics so much and you've convinced me
---
Ghostface is good though
---
hahah you are the guy from the other post about "green rank purgatory" wp
---
if i hear that im not going any where fucking near that locker
---
Here's hoping you aren't speaking too soon.
---
Time for Reddit circle jerk culture.

If this is true I‚Äôll become an Overcharge Freddy main
---
I‚Äôd stare at the locker.

it's similar but there's no cam in this video and it's just this one girl screaming " I hate this cunt!" "Oh come on, you didn't let me get him!!!"
---
lmao it was so funny. I dont understand why I cant find it on youtube now
---
I'm glad I convinced you.
---
Welcome to the Legion!
---
BHVR has stated they'll never ban anyone for using custom perk portraits and EAC don't give a shit as long as the important files in the game aren't tampered with so you 100% won't get banned.

i only dodge 4 mans as a killer..

Since there's no way i'm playing that shit.

Call it what you will, but i'm not dealing w/ that toxic sh!t.
---
I've moved up in the world.

Lol, can‚Äôt 3 man swf a killer at low rank?

See now I'm conflicted. On one hand I love me a serious game but on the other this is by far the greatest thing I've ever laid eyes on.

Killer: Ight imma head out
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, just a result of latency, all it means is that the survivor reacted to you in time on their client, which is why windows have been working; because the survivor can‚Äôt just stop interacting with the window to avoid the grab. I always laugh when I see it, very respectful of the killers to just give up their grab like that, no?
---
Yeah I liked Last Year but it was pretty flat. With more content to vary it, it could have been really good.
---
 Fighting back shouldn't mean winning, but it can mean resisting i.e. flashlight saves and pallet stuns
---
Oh okay. I was just very confused when this happens to me. Thanks!
---
This is great. I love it
---
I feel like your wraith buff would change almost nothing
---
As niche as it sounds, Tappe‚Äôs perks counter ruin and most hex perks for that matter. Detectives Hunch literally reveals every totem location for 10 seconds after each gen and Stake Out saves you from 4 hex skill checks. If you don‚Äôt have Tappe, Small game is useful. So are maps.
---
Bottom line, you can still work through a generator with ruin, it just takes about 20 seconds longer. It doesn‚Äôt make doing gens impossible, it just slows down the process.
---
How do you even still have any left holy shit
---
Thought the offerings were clues as to what killer I'd be vs'ing LMAO
---
does the sound travel aboveground? was always curious
---
Can someone tell me when do this changes go live? (im on work cant look it)  &lt;3
---
What if they could talk like in a chat but every time they send anything it gives their location away because talking makes noise
---
first thing i did when i got the game was buy  legion cosmetics. i didn't even have to olay the character to know they would be my favorite.
---
You have 2 notifications

I just didn't want to risk checking when I saw that ad, and risk it going away and not getting the screenshot. Believe me before I took the screenshot I tried to get rid of as much clutter as I could. I also like my screenshots clean.
---
I did the killee challenges already fml. Most of them were kinda easy like the grab challenge (I am a ghostface main when on killer.) The sacrifice 2 with no ed made me feel like a dick. Having to proxy camp as ghostface was not my playstyle but made it easy.
---
Several times now.
---
That‚Äôs because you watched a 9 month old video on twitch, watch one of his YouTube videos.
---
He is definitely good, he has the best 360‚Äôs out of any DBD player I‚Äôve seen
---
5 hours later and it's still the same
---
His power is easy to use and helps with tracking survivors, for me they are a chill killer to play and I don‚Äôt have to think very much.
---
Hag for suree
---
&gt; It penalizes you for doing the objective
---
penalized? oh please. i know for a fact you wouldn't say this same thing about DS even though it's equally true
---
&gt; There is no pre-requisite to cause a survivor to be affected
---
this is true of almost every perk on both sides of the game
---
&gt; Skillchecks have input delay.
---
&gt; Skillchecks input worsens or improves with fps it seems
---
these are fair points, but I am able to hit most of my skillchecks despite that
---
&gt; Skillchecks are randomized, I'v completed gens without getting a single skillcheck and other times gotten 5 skillchecks before I'v even gotten to 15% progress
---
This is actually an argument against you, so I don't know why you would offer this up
---
&gt; Totem spawns are becoming more hidden as they rework maps, Ruin shouldn't last the entire game
---
I've actually been tracking Ruin spawns lately and this is flat out untrue. Spawns are weaker than ever before 
---
&gt; It can be combined with other perks to slow the game down even more (PGTW, dying light, thanataphobia)
---
and survivors can make their tank builds. who cares?
---
&gt; Other perks focused end game (NOED, bloodwarden, remember me) can smack you in the face if ruin never gets cleansed and you finally get to the end leaving you with the feeling of "Go fuck yourself"
---
okay i'm just over you using this absurd "wah people use other stuff too" nonsense argument. it's utterly beside the point and this same shit applies to survivors as well
---
&gt; Not hitting the great gives you the penalty while also preventing you from regaining progress for 2 seconds, and should you continue to repair during this time you can get yet another skillcheck
---
yes this is how the perk works. congrats on being able to read I guess
---
&gt; Killers that gain the early momentum (Find a survivor fast, end early chases quickly, quick succession downs) gain more out of it. Certain killers with high map pressure or strong in chases gain more from it
---
okay?
---
What about the add-ons. Im genuinely curious of what you came up with.
---
&gt; So you hate ruin because it benefits the killer? 
---
right? that's literally what that entire cry baby post boiled down to lmao
---
The story is - a whole week earlier he uploaded a game he had as killer to yt. He got blinded a lot , and he never looked up (not during pick up animation).
---
A week later I saw him streaming when I was checking DbD streams. I dared say "make sure to look up this time" as he was about to play killer, not even sarcastically,just trying to give advice, since from what I saw he looked sideways from what I saw in the video. 
---
Apparently I should play the game more to be qualified to give advice to this guy. Playing the game since week one is not good enough...
---
It happen to me yesterday
---
B-b-but it worked last game?
---
You said he's shit and I ask why?  
---
There is no conclusion... I do see you're top of your class in understanding reading though!
---
I‚Äôll definitely need an update!
---
&gt; If you have a "special" way to wiggle, share with the class.
---
I'm only going to address this one thing because you are utterly fucking brain dead
---
you should wiggle by rotating the stick in a circle, but because of how the prompt reads a lot of people shove it back and forth which damages it.
---
you fuckingidiot
---
I legit just did today
---
enjoy never fixing this problem, kid
---
I don‚Äôt play legion for the kills or the powers. I play legion for the AESTHETIC.
---
Play how you want to play, I play the same way and really dont care how others feel about it. I play games to relax and unwind after working 13 hours a day.
---
Try blood warden
---
If you mean wraith yes.
---
Lol yes I‚Äôm sure the observer is going to start slipping in some promotional ads to his reading, gotta make that dough somehow.
---
As long as they don't care about you or how much fun you're having why should you?I always went with that mentailty.They're playing to win,so do you.I'm not saying you should camp or tunnel but sometimes you just have to.
---
The fact that you think my controller doesn‚Äôt work on specifically dead by daylight and not any single other game I play is hilarious, ‚Äúkid‚Äù
---
Welp either they didn't mean 3 pm eastern or something b.roke
---
Billy without add ons.
---
Myers with add ons.
---
I did it first try with hag.Down 2 people,open the gates and hook,voila
---
Noed, bloodwarden, bitter murmur. Keep track of hooks and only hook survivors twice. Once endgame happens hook someone who is on their last hook to activate bloodwarden and then hunt them down with noed. Bitter murmur is to show you survivors auras when the last gen is completed. Going to take some skill but that's how I did it.
---
Look who's shitting in the tall grass
---
Oh, your mad? That's so cute. Whose mad? Your mad.
---
As a GF main DONT stalk. Wasted too much time. Use his power addons for faster recharge and juggle. Ruin sloppy thanata and nurses is his best build. You can change out ruin for corrupt intervention if you wish.
---
Chill out, I never said you weren‚Äôt allowed to feel bad. I was only asking because I genuinely didn‚Äôt understand why you would feel bad about only 1 of 4 survivors escaping against a spirit who demolished the team.
---
Please stop giving me PTSD from the memories
---
I had a bug that awarded me a rift tier twice, so I got my two halloween outfits and 2 serum left over, it‚Äôs driving me crazy. :(
---
Well then, I guess you're one of those people that plays for fun, but if you don't play to win why play at all? You can't tell me it's fun to suck all the way up to the top if you claim fun is more important then winning?
---
And then you get skill based quests and everything is to hard because you never took it seriously and actually improved core abilities in order to also do harder things in this game.
---
hahah :D well the same tips still apply, now you just have to do an additional action in each category
---
so now you should aim for:
---
2+gens
---
2+unhooks (and remember to heal people)
---
a nice stun on the killer/or and "escape chase" or two
---
and of course dont die first or fast (stay hidden/play safe or be good/confident with loops)
---
this should secure a pip in purple and if you do more than that you will probably double pip since the gap is very small in purple and red ranks
---
Killing 2 survivors is considered a neutral game in terms of balance
---
Well, not for me. I'm testing it again right now to be sure, and unchecking auto-play disables the narrator for good after closing and re-opening the archives, even after restarting the game.
---
It might be a bug that affects a good portion of the players, seeing that I'm being downvoted as if I was wrong.
---
I'm gonna say it again: The Bloodweb is really annoying.
---
This must be the work of an enemy Stand.
---
At least you‚Äôre gonna be a P1
---
Welcome to bad optimization.
---
Well..got 1k..I did injure everyone a bunch but I had to camp after they opened the gate bc all three kept trying to get me to leave. Didn't realize you couldnt kill with feral frenzy üòÇ
---
I need to contact bromeri the maker of dead by roblox
---
Yeah I remember some of his "criticism" being a bit too much. Didn't watch him that much to notice how much of an ass he is I guess.
---
I made the mistake to watch him the next day. He said how much he wants a training mode with bots to practice killer... I never said that there's no need, all I said was that there are enough experienced streamers he can watch to learn how to play killer better. In response he said that I am saying that his idea is bad or some bs.
---
In response to him all I said was that I told him what he can do for now , since there is no training mode and that he should relax. For that I got timed out. One of his fanboys even said I am rude...
---
How long is her blink fatigue with that setup?
---
This is really, really good! How long did this take?
---
You're forgiven for being Trapper in the first place, but it is a really annoying perk. Kind of disappointing it's such hard meta.
---
Yes but there should be some punishment for playing that way. And there's none. 
---
The one who gets camped/1 hooked gets punished. Wth
---
I think it would be fun if leatherface was like kirby of DBD
---
Im a rank 2 p3 spirit now, and picked up legion for fun games
---
That is a strategy that rarely works and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Right now GF is at a strange point because of how wonky his reveal mechanic can be. Personally I only stalk at the very beginning (if the first expose doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt continue to try) or if there is only 2 survivors left. Also hitting a survivor resets their marked progress, so I personally don‚Äôt like to 99
---
Just normal blink fatigue time
---
Are you joking or stupid?
---
It'd be fantastic if they buffed base kicking to regress 5% and took that out of Pop's bonus. It'd essentially free up a perk slot for Killers and make tapping a potential liability.
---
Ill be waiting.
---
Um, no.
---
An Afro would be the best cosmetic
---
I played Dark souls 2 and Call of Pripyat 600hrs and 300hr respectively youre good
---
Make your profile public with comments enabled, play ten matches of killer and then see why this would be an awful idea.
---
I like Spirit because she goes fast and gives 'em the wiggles.
---
Lol gg ez trash baby camping tunnelling slugging killer get good.
---
I joke of course. I love this post because I came from the other side. I played killer main, learning the ins and outs and getting to red ranks. I played fair for the most part and often still got salty comments. I could always recognize the respectful players but the shitbags stand out, I decided that the toxic swf was the real evil in this game but looking to change things up and develop better tactics, I started queuing up in solo survivors and I faced the basement camping bubbas, the ebony mori abusers, the lazy noed killers, and I saw the justification, though wrongly placed toward myself and surely other fair killer, but still I saw the rot that feeds a survivor to strip their view of humanity from a killer. You gotta be able to look at both sides of the coin to really appreciate it.
---
As a killer main who plays swf sometimes, I completely agree and understand. I call it common sense.
---
I think I remember that one. Was one of the games on Autohaven?
---
Seriously dude? You‚Äôre not gonna play anymore cause you can‚Äôt complete the NOED challenge? 
---
You realize you can finish the archives without completing the full lvl right? Just do the ones that are easier for you man! 
---
NOED is already the most hated perk and as killer you‚Äôre basically asking for an easier way to kill during endgame? Oh man!
---
But it‚Äôs not against the rules or bannable or discouraged by the devs at all so why should it be punishable?
---
What kind of Xbox do you play on? I have a One X and it makes zero noise when I play. No game does now that I think about it.
---
If I see a 400 ping I‚Äôm out. Not dealing with that
---
Good job! Another burst of wisdom contributing the the conversation and not some petty insult. Proud of you!
---
It‚Äôs kind of what means...
---
That would get annoying fast not to mention people spamming it like they do when they fast vault back and forth.
---
Do a LeRys memorial offering and hang around the hospital beds.
---
Great decision! 
---
The killer wont have any idea :))
---
I think everyone gets tricked into thinking the "Escape" button on hook isn't a suicide button.
---
Farm your teammates and don't touch a gen.
---
he's just not adorable
---
Blame gen speed.
---
I agree with Myers but Ghostface is just goofy :D
---
Run Resilience with it and your build counters one of the most annoying killers too...if you can loop well that is..
---
MEZ is mine
---
Were you on Xbox against a Pig on Coldwind?
---
Which is why he has terrible map pressure. He‚Äôs better if you play him like Wraith and use his power to reveal.
---
Nah Im on ps4
---
I mean I Solo play too, and I didn‚Äôt stress about any challenges I just did them..
---
The one I‚Äôm stuck on was the unhook 2 people during the collapse which is pretty much impossible.
---
Then making a change is a good thing, but it‚Äôs not gonna be a easy thing for them to manage going forward cause as I said they don‚Äôt want the dedicated players getting through all the content in a day and they also don‚Äôt want casuals to struggle.
---
It‚Äôs a fine balance that they are clearly working on with updates like this.
---
The spirit also has to guess where you are so you can definitely use that to your advantage to juke her.
---
Rocket League ain‚Äôt like that...
---
This is why I always bring DS. Even then, it doesn't help if the killer slugs.
---
Yeah I meant..what time zone they the devs say that it's 3pm
---
LAN
---
What a hate is, when you play survivor you have to stay alive, but there is a Killer that is strong and want to kill you. When he trys to annoy you, he can do because he is powerful. But if you play as Killer and the survivors are annoying to you .. It's different. I don't know why, but for me it's more personal. I hate it much when the survivors annoy me when I'm the Killer than Killers annoy me when I'm the survivor
---
Whats the problem with killers doging swf groups? Survivors can do that to lol
---
Because belly
---
For something that gives only 15 seconds of protection, it's kind of ridicluous that it also doesn't apply to things like the strongest Killer in the game in general.
---
Deep Wound should be similar, which would fix Legion + Nemesis.
---
Although somebody please buff poor Wraith, because I feel like using the addon to not have radius after uncloaking and camping hooks was one of the only semi-functional things he could do.
---
Yesterday I cleansed HG about 2 frames before someone got hit.
---
I did not own up to it.
---
might want styptic and syringe on a medkit too buddy, needs more heals with that no mither :')
---
Survivors are just perks, unless you want stealth, in which case Claudette is free for visual, and Ace is just one Survivor for silence.
---
More accurately, the shadow of the Trapper in the background should be one of your allies calmly watching you die
---
They do get punished... so they lose emblem and BP for remaining in proximity of a hooked survivor when no one else is around.
---
While camping other should be doing gens (can coordinate this with swf)
---
Also killer cheats them out of more chases and downs and hits and 2 more hooks so overall they will have a harder time to rank up and get less BP.
---
Just often newer killers don't realise this or some who are close to or in green have had camping/tunnel work and so they have no reason to change.
---
I love DS but Id love it more if I wasnt so ass at its skill check I get too nervous and miss it
---
if you don't stack just go play tier 1 myers lol.
---
He is really hard to play, but he is really good if you play him good, watch some better players play him and learn.
---
The punishment is that focusing on one player lets three go on about their business. It removes the effects of many perks and powers and generally loses you the game.
---
That‚Äòs the question xD
---
I have no experience against good billys but it sounds fun
---
‚ÄúCock and ball torture. CBT on wikipedia, the Internet encyclopedia...‚Äù
---
Umm dude that's cause your ps4 is filled with dust take it apart and blow it out I had that same problem
---
i play legion for the soul perpose of me thinking frank is hot
---
There's a lot of variables but it's obvious when you go to their steam profiles and see a lot of -reps that they play that way.
---
Not OP, just unbalanced
---
Yeah that's his name in the series, leatherface is his alias, kinda like the pig is Amanda
---
Interesting , what makes you think that two windows and a pallet in one building is more balanced than the current version ?
---
At Red Ranks maybe. Not so much for higher ranks.
---
Bro this image #crispy
---
Use Freddy with NOED
---
its already one of the best berks in the game, it gets countered only pe stealthy killers wich feels fair. But it should still work agaist freedy
---
If he facecamps you the whole time your team should be getting all the generators done so he shouldn‚Äôt get any other kills, if camping is a large problem for you it may be because of the rank of players you are going against with the kindred changes coming if you are playing solo it will be a great perk to run to let your teammates know the killer is camping and to complete objectives. Other than that I always run DS just in case the killer is going to tunnel you off hook
---
Yeah it‚Äôs way too grainy.
---
Well styptic can definitely do something for your no mither
---
Exactly but if all the survivors are trying to distract him and he never follows any of them it's clear that he wants to not let no one unhook. 
---
I as a killer allways try to focus on every survivor unless one of them is being toxic.
---
Just a PSA you don‚Äôt need monitor on t1 Myers anymore. He‚Äôs undetectable and has no terror radius now after one of the last patches.
---
Why Resilience exactly? (I've a feeling I know what for but just curious as to your reasoning). Also, what killer are you referring to? Cuz I can't guess which one.
---
He‚Äôs the only survivor to only have two very rare outfits. At this point most killers have more outfits then him which is truly shocking to me.
---
Then there's the second time he got banned and then lied about the reason to get his fans to go harass BHVR.
---
Holy shit
---
I am not a red rank player.  I see Iron Will at literally any rank except &gt;12
---
Got any more of them pixels?
---
Link?
---
It‚Äôs brand new.
---
Just get better with the DS skillcheck then
---
It's easy enough to do if you use Insidious on top of Monstrous Shrine...
---
üíõ
---
Actually how I felt about it aswell
---
As always......
---
It would be easy if I did have insidious on bubba, btw I already have this challenge done, look at the picture
---
I have kindred :D and all I see is my teammates runing torwards me and try to distract the killer and none of them ia doing the objetive. 
---
I'm a rank 1 survivor and I go against arround rank 1 killers and it confuses me how they climb this way.
---
Sometimes the narrator skips some pauses where they should be, but overall I still like the narrator. Change my mind
---
Thank you, we all need more of this
---
How new
---
I'm assuming he's just not that popular
---
They make outfits the most for the most popular characters. Adam is getting kinda rare in the survivor pool.
---
That‚Äôs far from the truth. No one here claimed to main either side. I was asking a genuine question why you would be upset after demolishing a team of survivors. I play both sides and I don‚Äôt get upset when a survivor escapes through the hatch. Especially when I kill 3 of them before they can even finish one generator. What‚Äôs reasonable about his argument?
---
It's impossible for me to imagine being you.
---
It ruins the gameplay for everyone.
---
It's appropriately flaired.
---
Ah, I see it's an all about you post... Okay then!
---
I am not going to defend the rift because the challenges are poorly thought out to say the least. They could've gone with something much better than perform 100 unhooks and whatnot. 
---
With that being said, there is one thing I disagree with you:
---
&gt;Whats worse, this thing delayed and basically REPLACED an event, and will likely replace all our future events to boot.
---
This is not "worse", this is "better". Yes it removes the event objectives we would have to complete in order to unlock the rewards but the prizes being on the **free track** of the rift allows people to grind for them during 70 days instead of 14 days.
---
What is a lee-gi-auhn?
---
Spirit is pretty accurate tho
---
Aw, thank you! :3
---
Getting a gg when I get a 4 k or escape. Waking up when Freddy hooks me. The screen overlays of faces with madness. Booping pig's snoot and her being a good girl. Freddy's laugh. 360 vomiting plague (excessive vomiting from plague in general is funny) Survivors nodding yes, especially while crouched. Giving out party hats. Using a map offering and it not resulting in the slaughter of my whole team. The squishy sounds the bloodwebs makes. Survivors bargaining with items. Dance battles vs ghost face. Tokens(all of them). Cleansing hexes. Generators that open doors. Bloody party streamers.
---
I said in the description. Too easy to mind game survivors in its current form.
---
I miss it once in a blue moon. Usually in stressful situations like where I get downed near the exit gate.
---
Yea it‚Äôs hard to imagine anything with the iq of a sea cucumber.
---
Put 4 more in the corners
---
Bruh.

But there are so many ways to counter it and if you can‚Äôt that‚Äôs on you and your team also it‚Äôs mostly only common at low ranks really
---
Bruh look above trapper.
---
Im on it chief
---
Freddy its 3rd best killer in the game and he has Blood Warden which i think its a really fun perk. Demo its really fun to play do.
---
Yeah I may practice it in a custom lobby sometime, I gotta unlock it still I only have it on Laurie, it is a great perk though~
---
Id argue against the negative rep thing as I've been given negative rep for using Mori ( for challenges ) and for running a killer around infinite loops you can't base anything off a -rep as people report because they get salty :/
---
Im rank 1 and it's incredible how many rank 2/3 killers do this. 
---
I'm not a bad player I just get disgusted for this behaviour.
---
Then explain the -5 downvote the guy has who said he felt bad for the spirit... I can guarantee you it won't be killer mains doing that!
---
yes that is what he said
---
More, you forgot the corners
---
I'm at rank 1 and it would surprise you how many of these killers I get.
---
Suprise Ainsley.
---
I appreciate your elaborate ‚Äúno u‚Äù comebacks they take a lot of brain power which only further emphasizes you iq which is equal to that of a sea cucumber.
---
This is completely me being a level 15 fang
---
You're an all man/lady?
---
Mind if I ask how the plumbing is holding up?
---
Maybe try uninstalling the game? That will help
---
I see no Jesus, he must be really hard to draw.
---
Thank you for this
---
Easier with ghost face or pig you can make them think you‚Äôre picking them up with a crouch lol
---
&gt;Furthermore, with how busted servers are, I have been lucky a few times with the 9% boost on window/pallet vaulting speed
---
Honestly. That's the only reason I tend to use Resilience.
---
Do the gens
---
My final message
---
Goodbye
---
Legion is missing his 3 buddies that usually stand behind him.
---
Same and I don‚Äôt really see many so I guess it‚Äôs different for everyone
---
Never seen Mallrats? You're missing out.
---
wait a minute... are you telling me this is a common occurrence?
---
So you‚Äôre a killer main, then?
---
Wow, as a Spine Chill main, that's an easy 50K, damn!
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e3l5yk/found_janes_long_lost_sister/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It's not a report. I do not report them. I just want a better killer that makes some effort to get all survivors 3 hooked if possible.
---
I'm at rank 1, I don't mind people playing this way. But there should be a way to avoid them.
---
It‚Äôs not because of the dust, it happens to everyone I know, including me, and I got a new PlayStation 2 days ago
---
25% chance on PC for survivor.
---
Just a little bit
---
did a bug take the screenshot as well?
---
It's only punishable if they do this over and over. Ruins the gameplay and it's boring.
---
That was other guy who made a suggestion not me lol. I was just wondering your suggestion if was possible to do because of how the game is coded
---
THE NUMBERS MASON
---
BT , DS , Deliverance , DH . Just to name a few counters also if they are camping you are in a SWF you can waste 2 mins of killers time while the rest easily get 4 gens done (not to mention the initial chase time ) granted it is frustrating for the person it happens to but it hurts the killer more than the surv so let them do it while you leave with more points than them and more likely a safety pip while they depip and you won't face them again until reset
---
Yeah, I'll probably put that in 1.1 if I don't forget.
---
Even Tapp has more cosmetics, despite being licensed and (personally) more rare in queues. He needs new wares
---
That just seems like Keanu Reeves with extra steps 10/10
---
Try camping more... no, seriously. Bubba is not built for patrolling. Downvote me all you want but I have a blast playing the hook camping game where I see how many people try to unhook and outrun my chainsaw. You‚Äôd be surprised at how often it happens. 
---
You won‚Äôt get into high ranks this way, but why would you want to? It‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and might even teach survivors to stop playing so stupidly.
---
Hahaha you are soo intent in proving me wrong but you just can't change the fact that change is coming..., that they admit that challenges where too hard..., but you are just too buthurt and stuborn to admit it..., as I said like you have financial stake in it :D
---
And honestly if someone is idiot here it's you buddy only arrogant one xD
---
you're not expressing yourself monosyllabically enough
---
It actually helped lmao
---
Challenges still not updated and it's 4:26pm
---
I had a Legion endgame that lasted about 30 min once. Gen slowing perks, constant deep wounds without commitment to hooking, really poorly placed gens and all 4 survivors left. It was like going against a bot.
---
We never nudes dont have to be ashamed, there dozens of us, DOZENS!!
---
Look. I did not drop it late. The video shows it dropping after the hit because it lagged so hard that it dropped several seconds after I actually dropped it. I have over 400 hours in dead by daylight playing both sides and on pc. I am not new guy. Use your brain and think really hard about how when you send data across the internet and then you wait to receive it back from someone that is when things occur in this particular game. I pressed it correctly then lag happens and it teleported me backwards I was hit and then it slammed the pallet I did not stand there waiting to slam it and get hit then complain about it. Get it through your head. That's not what just happened
---
He's learned to post on Reddit give the sea cucumber some god damn credit man!
---
Honestly if the you are not in the Killers Terror Radius for 20 seconds it shouldn't work.
---
Oh, okay. 
---
I think so, but I'm not very sure.
---
I am. But just for a second, dont you think when people downvote you to hell is when you should start consider that your idea is dumb?
---
For me it‚Äôs when Prayer Beads Spirit appears outta nowhere right behind me or when I run into Tier 1 Michael Myers like ‚Äúoh my ba- OH SHIT‚Äù
---
Stop. It. Holy fuck. Do you even look at the subreddit. This has been posted to death and it's being fixed.
---
Is it me or does Legion have the best Killer skins? I mean, they're even getting their own terrible Christmas sweaters!
---
I turned my PS4 into a water cooled PS4 by dipping it in a 5 gallon bucket of water and now it makes no noise. Have you considered this?
---
This ^
---
Idk man have you seen some of the posts on reddit it doesn‚Äôt seem that hard for a sea cucumber.
---
Been away a bit due to moving, can someone tell me what changes we‚Äôre talking about?
---
You cant play well while also stepping in traps 5 times
---
Fix still isn't out yet it seems.
---
Not the first time this has happened. The rift is a grind already, bugs like this have been making it worse...
---
The game shouldn‚Äôt be balanced around top players
---
Really like this
---
r/stabbygang
---
Too much grind over too long a period of time for too few items doing kinda unfun stuff. I think jamming The Archive and your ‚ÄúHalloween Event‚Äù (which this year was just more exp, which in this game is pretty much worthless because prestiging is pretty much worthless) together was a big mistaku.  I used to be able to choose when I grinded and get some awesome free items in a pretty reasonable amount of time doing something new and unusual. Now I do something I‚Äôve done a million times before spread out over a few months. Please rethink this.
---
Never knew I was such a good problem solver. You are welcome mate &lt;3 Glad i could help
---
Literally stop being a dick. It's just a cute post.
---
I'm new so definitely take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I've had games where the whole team will rush hook right after i put them up. I dont neccessary camp but i will patrol the area simply because i know there are a lot of survivors around. However I've fought killers who just stare at the hook and hit the survivor over and over and i think that's stupid.
---
Honestly? If you finish this, I would 100000% buy it as a print. It's That Good
---
You can definitely run Killer games without Ruin and NOED, but the higher you get in rank, the less likely you are to 'win' and the more likely you'll run into toxic people. You have to strongly consider at least Ruin the higher you go, because without it otherwise, a single mistake or being looped too long can destroy your game. If you fail to take advantage of Survivor's mistakes, like when they're overly altruistic, you're gonna have a bad time. Survivors become desensitized to the terror radius and stop being spooked by your presence. They'll repair gens in your face even while you loop another Survivor barely meters away. Even if you push them off the gen, failing to down/hook them means they'll be right back on it again. It's tough. All the advantages Killers have in brown/yellow ranks, when hatchlings and rusty returning players populated your lobbies, quickly evaporate the higher you climb.
---
It's why in purple/red ranks, both sides tend to run meta perks and Killer mains run the best Killers, 'cause the alternative is MAYBE a 1K if you're lucky and teabagging Survivors at the exit gates, with Survivors making more points than you at the end by a wide margin. It's why you have that sensation that the only way you have a chance to do well is to run Ruin to slow the game down, NOED to ensure that extra one or two kills late game, BBQ for the information and BP, and personally, I run Discordance on most of the Killers who have map presence 'cause if I don't, I feel like it's much more difficult to maintain map pressure. Killer mains got it tough high ranks, 'cause you've gotta be everywhere and do everything, but you can't.
---
Be more efficient, don't get tunnel vision, don't be afraid to take advantage of Survivor mistakes, and you'll start to get an idea of what's expected of you at higher ranks.
---
Oh, so it was merely an ad hominem. I'm sorry that I misunderstood you as a genuine individual.
---
I feel like this when im trying out new characters and everyone else has their main at p3 50
---
That‚Äôs crazy but doesn‚Äôt really surprise me lol. Rank means nothing in this game lmao. I‚Äôm sorry you are getting stuck with those teammates
---
Was the person playing as Meg in a skirt? And the streamer was getting pissed of him juking at the killer shack?
---
I think dbd is trying to make us do this with the new challenge ‚Äúunhook 2 people in endgame collapse *do this in a single trial‚Äù
---
I actually don't mind it. The archive challenges give me something to try and do other than kill and survive and make me play a different play style that what I'm use to. Plus they give a good amount of bloodpoints which helps the grind out a lot. Love when I have bbq and chili and I finish a challenge because that's usually 100,000 points from one game. The free cosmetics are a little extra. I'm tier 40 just from playing and doing some of the challenges. If I manage to get to 70 I might buy the pass just to get all the other goodies cause it essentially gives me the next pass for free since the auric cells I get will go towards the next pass.
---
how can anyone dispute that? it has no factual basis to dispute. you just made a feelings based assertion
---
I don't mind the narrator but I was disappointed that it wasn't the narrator from the newer spotlights.
---
Y u bully my friend?
---
Nor is there skill in holding M1 for 80 seconds
---
definitely use all good items and offerings befo entering a new prestige. easy BP!
---
because jen denise screamed it constantly? doesn't make it fact lmfao
---
Oni has to slug of he loses his power 
---
No mither allows you to recover from dying an unlimited amount of times.
---
I play with the character until I saved up another 1.000.000 bloodpoints to immediately put the prestiged character back to level 35 ~ 40.
---
I do the same thing, try and use up all my items and such, you get more bloodpoints that you can use towards your next prestige! üëç
---
What deathgarden could have been if they did anything
---
go clean ur pants lol
---
GIANT BLACK BBC SHOOTING HOT MILK INSIDE YOUR WIFE
---
I actually haven't prestiged anyone after they released the cosmetic store since the only benefit was a unique outfit but now you can get others without losing everything. 
---
I think it's a bit of a waste of time, at least for me. I assume some people enjoy the grind though.
---
It‚Äôs not a feelings based assertion, if you‚Äôd watch and open your ears a little you might see that if someone disagrees on the nerfing of a killer everyone jumps on the bandwagon to tell them how their opinion is wrong. 
---
Factually, this community has some form of wrongthink and things he says fall under it. Even you didn‚Äôt make an effort to actually dispute it, you just tried to call me out on nothing.
---
It's 4:43EST and still no release yet :/
---
I've not played since hag release, anyone got a tutorial video of how to install the ui pack? K thx
---
I already finished level 3 though :/ 
---
At least its better for everyone now.
---
This is an hourly routine while trying to play on college internet.
---
Genius, not quite good sir, but regular user of the green key is my expertise
---
There's instructions in the ZIP file!
---
I use the rest of my BPS and cakes for most part, but when i was first lvling i got everyone lvl 40 to get there perks then i spammed BP into my main nea till i got every perk on her.
---
Level up someone else.  I don't care about gee cosmetic.  Does nothing else for you.
---
I play Hearthstone too, but I don‚Äòt see a connection between these two
---
Not sure, all I know is that it‚Äôs white.
---
Ruin and pop and basically any other slowdown perk
---
Oh I didnt know this was on here I found it and posted it sorry
---
I got a 3K + frame number on PC the other day with that title screen. Its just as bad on PC.
---
Don't prestige any character. It doesn't worth it.
---
Rank 1 gameplay
---
Only prestiged claudette because i liked her P3 look. 
---
Grinded my ace out to have all perks without prestiging. There's still a metric ton of BP needed to get some killers to a point of usability. And just got the stranger things DLC, so 6 more perks to unlock and grind on my ace
---
Imagine playing in 30 FPS and being afraid of crossplay because of your own admitted inferiority.
---
As a survivor playing against pig, they always seem to hit, I guess they never miss, huh?
---
The spirit does not need to guess, she can see your scratch marks, and hear you.
---
I honestly want to
---
Any one else feel like the new archive challenges are ruining the game rn ? Every second match is a insidious baba face camping cause they want that basement challenge.
---
 Carmen Sandiego?
---
you don't
---
Never saw anything about that.  I also have no issues with getting decent things on a non prestiged character.
---
man i love you
---
Just separate casual and ranked like Evey other game, getting bp or ranks doesn't matter after you've played for a few seasons and got most of the builds/perks you want anyways. It's all dumb I mean why's there only 2 game modes, that's why replayability is shit lol
---
using the ability to close the hatch :(
---
Honestly, a lot of people don't like to stalk. I personally do stalk pretty damn well and get plenty of instadowns at red ranks. But, you need map knowledge and a lot of game sense to be good at stalking. Just losing your TR and Red Stain and juggling can work.
---
I think you can get a survivor to level 30-40 with 1 million bloodpoints.
---
when is this going live? 3pm... but what time zone?
---
WOW, that‚Äôs a lot of grinding
---
If you watched it on YouTube, you could check your history.
---
Hour 6 and we're still observing both hypocrisy and inaction at it's finest.
---
Merciless Machine, too! I almost always get max Brutality
---
Can't you just use broken keys?
---
sshhshshs just let it happen
---
Walking against a spirit doesn‚Äôt do anything, sure you‚Äôre scratch marks are gone, but she is still moving way faster then you
---
More bloodpoints would be great. Like 10% more for every devotion level.
---
sshhhshh just let this happen
---
then fix the latency it occurs way to often (thanks for the clarification)
---
yeah i had something like that in mind for moris, hatch is bullshit and should be removed/changed)
---
im personally a fan of a big possible competitive overhaul that could fix a lot of these issues but i wont list my ideas here :\^)
---
Oh shit
---
Well obviously you still can get good things but as stated before is not all that often
---
I hate to be "that guy" but ... it's 5pm. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hiding under the bridge, with the rest of the trolls.
---
Thanks boss
---
Hey, was this Kate wearing a biker jacket, caribou beanie hat, and mountaineer pants?
---
Honestly I think camping just makes the game less fun for survivors and makes the community more toxic as a whole, plus you won‚Äôt improve as killer at all. As for the whole ‚Äúmight even teach survivors to stop playing so stupidly‚Äù part of your argument, there‚Äôs nothing stupid about it. They are going to try and unhook their ally, who will die if they don‚Äôt. Do you want them to just let their friend die while you rev your chainsaw in the corner? What kind of lesson is that teaching? If someone‚Äôs camping your friend just ignore it and let them die? That sounds real fun
---
I only prestiged my Killers a total of 4 times (Plague P3 and Myers P1) because Killers are more perk dependant than Survivors and it‚Äôs torture trying to do well with awful perks. I still get good add-ons and offerings in the bloodwebs, enough to keep me going at least. 
---
I‚Äôve got all perks maxed on my Killers now and got all my Survivors to P3 and so my bloodpoints now go on levelling them up for more perks and towards new chapters.
---
i've seen someone named mlaudette corel
---
Did this particular video have a part where the woman screams into the mic about her noed being gone and during the scream it showed a Rollercoaster? If so I know what video you're talking about. It's no longer on YouTube sadly :(
---
Susie is the greatest monster the Entity ever pulled into the fog. Because there is nothing more terrifying than the sweet and innocent being broken beyond mortal comprehension. I bet she even scares Myers. After all, just look at her smile in her unmasked renders. She's enjoying every second now.
---
no more
---
With a killer that has BBQ n Chili it‚Äôs essentially only 20 matches not counting any BPS you or another player might use. Not too difficult. Also OP is saying from level 1 to between 30 and 40. Not just from 30 to 40.
---
The first 10 games had me shitting my pants. Now it's just go gen to gen, oh spine chill is on, let me go the other way. Oh this guy got hooked, let me go over there. Oh he's getting farmed, I'm getting the fuck away from there. Oh great, its hex, let me run around for a while. 
---
Straight up the only killers that still get my hair to stand up and make my hands sweat when i hear/see them is Ghostface and The Pig
---
better than the bushes with the other blendettes
---
Just kind of reinforces why she's got such a problematic kit, even if she isn't that powerful.  If the Plague plays right she completely negates altruism via healing as the only way to heal infected players is to use a fountain, and then she gets empowered off of that.  So the only time Survivors are able to heal themselves/each other is when she's using Corrupt Purge and they're not already infected, or if she for some reason M1's them without infecting them first.  
---
And then all she really needs to do is double stack Thanataphobia and Dying Light.  Maybe throw on Hex: Ruin for extra Survivor suffering.
---
In my case it ebony mori works like that: "100% to meet purple rank"(and i'm a rank 17, and there was 2 puprle and 2 green rank like wtf)
---
This game is so great lol, the lore ties into the community so well. So many killer mains try to be nice, and then are subjected to endless torture, in the form of salty/toxic survivors, until they just break and become merciless killing machines. monsters that only care about serving the entity. 10/10 great lore
---
I don't feel like prestiging my characters to have to get all the perks again for some bloody clothes, besides my favorite ones (Quentin, Freddy, Laurie, Michael and Ghostface). Maybe one day I will prestige them, when they all are max level and I have leftover bloodpoints.
---
The timing with the Nea being picked up followed by the DC sound was great! Thank you for blessing me with this post
---
Its a repost.
---
Just tweeted it‚Äôs delayed
---
Can they delay the ending date while they're at it? Thank you.
---
It "gives you better rewards" and on Claudette if you get the P3 clothes it makes you blend into almost everything
---
Imma say put 1 more in the tall grass over there just for good measure.
---
I saw, not really surprised
---
You're said you get better things when you prestige. I disagreed.  Nothing more to say.
---
It‚Äôs either that or trappers farming bear trap traps
---
Fucking rip. Why is nothing ever straight forward?
---
If you don't want it don't buy it? It's no one's fault but your own if you buy something you aren't actually going to complete.
---
The Rift isn't bad, nor is it too grindy to ever finish. I've done tome 1, 2, and half of 3. Aside from that my play time averages at 2 hours a day for the past 2 weeks and I'm currently one game away from hitting tier 41. At this rate I'll be finishing before time is up, no problem. Not to mention how when I do finish, I'll have enough auric cells to buy the next one.
---
I only prestige my killers only and only if i like the bloody weapon. Also im really lazy
---
Not sure why you were downvoted, auto disable has always worked for me no problem
---
Yeah it takes probably 5 million or so bp I'd say. 1 million will get you to what, level 25?
---
Disappointed but not suprised
---
Martian, so it seems.
---
holy these are amazing
---
Actual result: they both run into it but chokehold themselves into being unable to use it until the Killer hits one of them.
---
Next week lol
---
You are taking this as a serious debate, dude. Is nit that "you get better things because you prestiged", more like better things start to pop more often, if you don't want to prestige and start from level 1 thats your thing and nobody is stopping you.
---
The update has been postponed to [next week.](https://i.imgur.com/TFhC3db.jpg)
---
Rise up brothers and sisters!
---
Nothing more satisfying in the game for me.

Well that's a slide on the deadline. 24hr fix to "next week"?
---
You can always tell who‚Äôs a legion main based on if they say ‚Äúthem‚Äù instead if ‚Äúhe‚Äù
---
You forgot your brackets cause it just looks like you can't do maths
---
The only reason I prestige is for new perks, for example I only prestiged my nea because I got self care for all survivors and didn't feel like grinding 3-7 level 50 bloodwebs.
---
I'm just amazed how easy it is to troll in this subreddit, I don't even need to swing the fishing line you guys practically jump into the boat! :-)
---
I need to quit doing it, it's gonna make me lazy!
---
Good times, good times indeed!
---
you're literally proving how you used it wrong..
---
Seriously, how do you fuck up a hotfix?
---
Because lies and deceit make BHVR money.
---
DbD survivors are some of the most entitled people I‚Äôve ever seen in the gaming community.
---
Not saying every single survivor of course, but a lot of them are little shitbags who really don‚Äôt deserve killers playing fair and square.
---
If you dont like it just ignore it? Its just cosmetics.
---
Sounds like a man stripper lmao
---
It's fine. Nothing I'm talking about is virtue signaling. 
---
As killer you have the right to play the game however you want. (And I have the right to play for fun bc I'm not going to sh*t on newbies to make up for my little dick. )
---
TR's post reeks of insecurity. Lol imagine comparing this game to your "right wing snow flake pitty party". Fcking loser.
---
If anyone it‚Äôs McCote. He‚Äôs still having flashbacks to that time he got his ass handed to him on stream so he makes sure to put anti BM tech in this killer.
---
I never have, my old roommate hasn't and I've never seen a YTer or streamer run it
---
Man I almost had it earlier then one of the survivors hit that 4 percent chance unhook well I was checking on the other and got hatch. I threw my controller down and turned off the PS4. 
---

I'd like to see challenges that involve certain characters more. Like using their teachable perks, or for killer, something like "Do X without using add-ons" or something
---
Jake would have to be paired with either billy or wraith
---
Brackets? For what? This is subtraction. Subtraction doesn't need brackets.
---
More like not just going for a hook, she decided to close hatch in front of op.
---
Play high ranks on pc. I see it daily
---
more like "DC on hook when a teammate comes to rescue you" or "DC asap"
---
Lmao fuck that. I want my BP
---
Saddly not, full biker set.
---
That gave me a chubby
---
Quick question: did you change your game settings .ini in the game files? And if so, is it set to read-only? If so, that may be your culprit
---
I always tell myself "fuck it I'll just DC, idfc anymore I'm done" as I wiggle my booty as fast as I can towards the hook for the 3rd time
---
The tome changes are...DELAYED üôåü•≥
---
Asking for a friend.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because this game is like a horror movie in many aspects (for instance, y‚Äôknow, killing people).
---
Now, name me ONE fucking horror movie that wasn‚Äôt comedic where the victims were the ones harassing and bullying the killer all the time.
---
Imagine a Sydney Prescott and Gale Weathers teabagging Ghostface every 5 minutes.
---
Imagine Halloween‚Äôs Laurie Strode spamming flashlights against Michael Myers throughout the entire movie.
---
That just doesn‚Äôt make sense whatsoever. Hence, the annoyance us killer mains get when survivors are acting toxic. They‚Äôre not supposed to have it easy. Of course there are games where the killer plays like absolute garbage, in that case then he doesn‚Äôt deserve a participation trophy. I‚Äôm no psychologist or anything but that‚Äôs really the only explanation I can come up with.
---
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
---
Its because your ps4 is full of dust and you need to clean it out
---
They are really incompetent! Other software house would have already released a perfectly working update!
---
Especially after someone brought up the definition and he still denies it
---
I be scared of both but when you think of it as long as you do not insult the oni you should be fine he was a honorable samurai who got mad at being called a ogre
---
Why use brackets here? 100-50+50=0=100-(50+50), or are you saying math can't use negatives outside of algebra or greater? (Sorry if I sound rude, more just actual curiosity)
---
Read this after the edit. Didn't downvote but I'm sure people are because of the assumption you made of him, off one video from long ago. I'm a viewer; everything he says and his negativity is a joke/sarcasm. That's basically like all meme content creators for any game. So yeah, you're stating your opinion, but the opinion is an assumption, and that'll get you downvotes anywhere.
---
You are completely right.
---
But unfortunately Bubba can't really play any other way. He is for some reason built for camping. He should be reworked, but if someone wants to use him as he was intended - remembering that they paid REAL non refundable money for him - then camping makes sense. 
---
He's still the worst killer and very unpopular. But as annoying as it is I will at least understand those who Insidious camp with Bubba.
---
You need perks to play the game with some kind of real pressure? Nearly every killer without amazing pressure needs some kind of perk to apply it. How do people not get this? It‚Äôs painfully obvious.
---
Have you managed to get a Merciless with him using only his perks? And if so, how?!
---
Noed and mori sure but ruin...? What lol
---
actually managed to complete the unhook 2 survivors after egc started challenge on my second attempt without farming, kinda bummed they changed it after I completed it but it is a necessary change. I was only able to get it because killer didn't camp first hook, and the second hook my buddy managed to distract the killer long enough for me to get down into the basement without taking a hit. Can't imagine how solo survivors can do this challenge without needing to farm
---
Slower games generally result in more points for everyone
---
That‚Äôs pretty accurate
---
"Sometimes I like to treat DBD like a videogame and just have fun."
---
BHVR: Yes.
---
Aww man. I stepped in like 6 traps in front of the trapper to help him complete his challenge.

Wraith can be very op. Especially if u have that add-on that lets you see the progress of the gens while cloaked+the one that lets you see the survivors auras within 12m
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with him ... he‚Äôs a good player. I just find him extremely boring to watch.
---
That‚Äôs true as well. I‚Äôm speaking from experience. I did play survivor too but not enough where I can say ‚Äúin x matches y amount of killers were doing or acting this way or that way‚Äù
---
Have you tried powering down the Switch then restarting it? That‚Äôs what fixed it for me.

im rank 1 and i still get hit sometimes bc id be trying to do both and messing both up anyway (bhvr please increase console sensitivity thx)

I bought him because of the black friday sale, somehow him and freddy are the only killers I can consistently get all iridescent emblems on (currently rank 10)

What's the point in designing a battle pass for hardcore players. You don't need to increase their playtime anymore and a battlepass won't make them play even more anyway. What you want to do is to give small, easily achievable goals for casual players that draws them into the game more and makes them spend more time in the game by which you increase the likelyhood that theyll spend money.
---
Current battlepass feels too grindy for casual players and thus leads to disappointment and frustration that is bring connected to the game, decreasing playtime of casual players. You might increase playtime of almost hardcore players or those that have to collect everything in a game but the other way would be more profitable as casual players are by far the largest group in the gaming industry and the group with the most disposable income.
---
How many survivors have wronged you?
---
Were you chasing them?
---
Facts
---
Same, We are samurai's, No surrendering

I like how Bubba looks like the most normal killer.

My man
---
So, what you're saying is that she didn't camp you. 
---
She played the game completely normally, didn't allow any of you to do a single generator, and then at the end of the game she downed two of your friends at the same time, and hooked them next to each other.
---
Why do you expect her not to patrol them when it's obvious that you're not bothering to do generators, and it's obvious that you're in the area, waiting to unhook? There's a difference between camping and having a functioning brain.
---
we could just sit here and throw anecdotes at eachother theres no point
---
when i talk about entitled killers(and survivors) i do not mean in game but on this subreddit
---
and generally the whole survivors vs killers thing fuck off (not necessarily you)
---
So I guess we‚Äôll just try and avoid the challenges that we know are getting nerfed to save time? Lol Behavior....

Finally, I'm not alone!
---
Was wondering this too. The red stain is so intensely bright, I was thinking it was a PC thing. Must be so easy to loop.
---
is this the McDonalds toy?  very well done
---
ah yes... hold on... let me run around the map so i can avoid doing anything of value for 90s just so that i don't run into an unfun part of the map. :)
---
Well done homie
---
If you see a survivor or killer play a certain way you can kind of guess what type of people they are (or would be) on this sub
---
I know I‚Äôm late,but you should check out PainReliever
---
Yaaaaaay. Bless you.
---
Did you add him?
---
It is activated, but it's rare to see a windows player. I just want to know if it's possible to invite people from the windows store to the steam version or not.
---
I got myself Freddy, and it is heaven. Consistent merciless every match. The closest I've been to losing was in a VERY intense match, when there was just one surv and a gen left, I closed thr hatch and he almost escaped. 10/10, recommend u buy him if u haven't already. And it is SO fun to play and SO satisfying, if u use the dream palets. I am quite the low rank player, compared to the normal in this sub, but I have risen from rank 16.5 (16 with 2 diamonds) to rank 13.5 in less than 2 days. And I haven't even played that much
---
Being chased by the killer is valuable. It buys time for your teammates. If your just running around the map for some reason you‚Äôre doing nothing.
---
How to: (for the people who still doesn't know how to do it from watching the video)
---
step 1: While sprint burst is up, activate a key and start running.
---
step 2: Release key so you don't use up the key.
---
step 3: ?????
---
step 4: Have sprint burst available at any time you want it during a chase.
---
Fair enough. I think that even if he‚Äôs patched people will still camp with him though. I understand if someone wants to play leatherface right now, and the only viable way to do that is to camp, but if the character you‚Äôre playing is good there is no excuse to camp
---
Demo with mad grit is a noisy little goblin.
---
Dope.
---
I love you
---
True
---
What's a search bar?!? Lol
---
No update till next week. Guess they decided they wanted to get some more pointless time wasting grind out of us first.
---
Ditto.
---
I absolutely hate playing legion, Hes my one regret üò≠
---
Yes but he declined friend request.
---
It‚Äôs called the Dwighticus Maximus start, +5% chance the killer will feel bad and give you hatch
---
Good, the challenges were easy anyways
---
Biggest Bruh Moment, see this is why we shit on BHVR so much. I had a huge appreciation when they announced they were actually tweaking the challenges like they were finally listening to us... but as usual something goes wrong or they're just straight up like nope.
---
that is true yeah, and this can be applied to both sides.
---
Sshhhhh don‚Äôt tell people
---
Thats not the issue. The issue is they made a commiment and then couldnt uphold it, which they are doing consistantly
---
Press the huge ass touchpad on ps4
---
What we really need is being able to see when someone else is spinning their survivor in the lobby. That's usually how I kill time when waiting for a match and I'd love to do it with others.
---
*Due to Unforeseen Circumstances*
---
If they know you're gonna hit them and they are close to a locker... Hopping in and out a few times can waste some time.
---
If there's a row of lockers there's a slim chance the killer will accidentally search the wrong one, which will buy you some more time. This has happened a few times to me.
---
There is nvidia geforce experience that brightens the game a lil bit if you get confused too much around with some dark maps it helps a little.
---
Dw, im sure people will find some bullshit reason to defend them and then they forget it like it never happened
---
My plan is to use either ghostface or wraith with bone clapper and the ghost addons. Even if it‚Äôs only 2 grabs a game (which is about average with those kits) it‚Äôll be done somewhat soon.
---
Again, ‚Äúoh no, they can‚Äôt do something when they said they would!‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs life.
---
It's not very effective in that regard since you can just grab them mid animation
---
first one was bs too, hit the hook and not the survivor.
---
Well this fucking sucks. I stopped doing certain challenges expecting a fix today.
---
I thought doing that with a key was fixed months ago pretty good job so far
---
For me it‚Äôs the ‚Äústun the killer twice‚Äù challenge. Shouldn‚Äôt be difficult but every killer I get respects pallets now. They abandon the chase before I get to throw the pallet
---
My best guess is that survivors might think you have BBQ, so they‚Äôre heading into lockers to avoid the tracking on it.
---
I'm disappointed, but not surprised.
---
it's not new by any means and it probably happens because a solid 85% of players in this game are massive noobs that have no idea what theyre doing
---
If your going for adept don't use your power at all just m1. He suffers from  the same problem as all insta down killers and plague if you use your power it will destroy your chaser emblem. and id recommend popping a game offering just so u dont get giant maps like forest.
---
Too many man, too many.
---
Sure thats life, but people are allowed to be upset about it, especially when theyve done this reapetedly in the past
---
Evan, Evan‚Äôs, Evan, Evan, Evan‚Äôs, Evan‚Äôs, Evan, Evan, Evan‚Äôs, Evan
---
Weak killers are allowed to use NoEd. Cleanse totems if you're going against a weak killer like Wraith, Leatherface, Legion, and Trapper. Also, people usually use ivorys for dailies.
---
They probably couldn't add the patch without breaking the game.
---
Then why are people upset. It‚Äôs like clinging to an abusive relationship. You knew that fist was coming.
---
Because people have already finished them and they most likely found issues with overriding their completed challenges
---
I enjoy playing both sides but I definitely get my blood boiled when someone is needlessly rude or outright hostile in post game chat. The game is really fun to play but when someone is taunting at pallets or over a hatch it takes a lot of the fun out.
---
Oh my god that was disgusting just how unlucky is that guy
---
 True aaaaaaaaaaaand... Yeah, that's pretty true. That's true and- yeah that's true. That's true. That's true- That's pretty true. That's pretty true, I mean- **inhales** ... That's true. Yeah. That's true. Uhm- That's true. That's fuckin' true. Uhm... That's how it is dude.

This is it. High rank survivors made me a ruthlessly efficient Ghostface.
---
.Survivor main here;  
---
I just do it to waste your time, every second counts. I mean, that's the survivors job right? To waste your time so your teammates can do gens without being scared.   
---
That is the hope at least, My teammates are usually pickles though.
---
Every time they drop new content everyone forgets how incompetent they are until they fuck up something else.

Only 70%? Should be 100 period

I genuinely laughed out loud at how inept they are.

As a member of the Clown delegation I uhhhh second this.

Id almost go as far as to call iron will a **requirement** against a good spirit.
---
F
---
If I choose another challenge while having progress on another one, will it reset the progress?
---
It works on baby killers 100% of the time which wastes there time
---
Had that happen before, I was running around the map but found the same person twice and probably felt like I was tunneling for them but I just never saw the other survivor. I think you‚Äôve got a good stance on what tunnelling is though.
---
If you do anything for a 1000 hours it isn't scary anymore I bet
---
Another day in xbox
---
this erks me unless they have deliverance and the killer has moved on
---
Me too
---
What ? It‚Äôs only like 1.5M bloodpoints to reach 50. 5M is enough to reach P3
---
Pick whichever horror game or movie you want. None of them will be scary any more after you watch/play it several times.
---
There's nothing scary about routine.
---
*cue 28 stab wounds*

Lol I had a guy wait until I got within 4 feet of him - only to use Deliverance right in my face.

---
I‚Äôm just saying reaching the balance between the two worlds is key and it‚Äôs a tricky thing to do.
---
There haven‚Äôt been challenges related to DLC cause they don‚Äôt want to force players to spend money to complete it.
---
They released this update to try and fix some of the issues people are having.
---
I don‚Äôt get this hostility when the developers are actively trying to make it better.
---
No body wants impossible to complete challenges but I‚Äôd also argue no one wants challenges they can do in a day.
---
Doubt
---
oh that timing would have made me so happy
---
That dude is wrong. No addons affect the amount of time it takes to blind. Only how long it blinds for. Also a correctly times save is unavoisable so you have to make sure they cant get the angle or timing
---
Is it still true that you don‚Äôt get rift fragments from uncompleted tome challenges when a new one drops?
---
The narrator reads so goddamn unnecessarily fast
---
This is me but with pig.
---
You mean pemdas?
---
Exp for the rift tiers
---
lazy fucking cunts. i wonder what theyre gonna do when everyone gets tired of their shit and they can't charge 4$ for a single cosmetic anymore?
---
Working in IT i can somewhat relate.
---
Rolling out changes before the weekend is fun for no one, especially rushed, barely tested ones.
---
Then again the complaints didn't start today so they could have reacted quicker, and in gaming weekends are the busiest times.
---
They shouldn't have promised to hotfix the problem in the first place, had they said they'll change it on monday from the start it might be a bit less infuriating.
---
Experience points are gained 1 per second so no matter what just make all your matches at least ten minutes long
---
Close to the isolation room there is a room with 3 lockers and a chest, there is only one door in front of the middle locker.
---
It‚Äôs not worth to prestige because it doesn‚Äôt affect gameplay in anyway. And they added the cosmetics store, so you can buy /grind for cosmetics.
---
I play a lot, so I just prestige characters ASAP because why tf not
---
I recently got Legion and despite being new at him, he's still fun to me. I have gotten some toxic survivors recently though. Three survivors in a swf reported me for "wallhacking" and refused to believe Killer Instinct could let you see people in lockers.
---
I play Legion for the soul purpose of pissing people off
---
Rocket League has a battle pass?
---
What are the challenges for it like? How do you make progress in it? 
---
Is it a xp based one? Cause if it is I bet you can‚Äôt get through it all in a day. That‚Äôs a grind no matter how you look at it but the difference is how you perceive the grind and I imagine it wasn‚Äôt perfect in the first iteration.
---
He dont follow the fucking rules
---
I already miss when it worked in dying state
---
Slow down buckaroo, don‚Äôt want iron will to get nerf
---
I think they definitely missed the point. I think it was mainly the egc and single trial ones that were too difficult to get done. Sure unhook 25 survivors will take a while, same with kick 40 gens/pallets, but it's not impossible just takes more time.
---
Overall it's nice to know they heard us. I just think it's weird they didn't realize the difficulty until they play tested it, like do you guys not already do that?
---
When you need fathers glasses to see blood even though you have strider and can hear them small brain spirit
---
r/AceBase approves. Well done!
---
I won't be voting for them. Love the game but they are full of shit lmao
---
Eh pc players tend to be try hards so that's not surprising
---
Tweets on that thread are funny as hell though. Besides, if you really hated them, you wouldn‚Äôt be here. I don‚Äôt mind, I mean the challenges aren‚Äôt being adjusted that much (Last Minute Hero is still very difficult).
---
And pc players are the majority of the dbd playerbase
---
At least you find lobbies... I just get errors everytime it wants to connect to a lobby. Been like that for the past week, am waiting for a lobby for nearly 2 hours as I write this
---
Killer : Yes, only one survivor left
---
Killer : Yes, found the hatch and closed it
---
Survivor with key : And I‚Äôm gone
---
Prestiging characters really only gives you the bloody clothing. If you don‚Äôt want the clothing, dont prestige.
---
You cant use it because you have to start healing to use it
---
how is that physically possible?
---
if you wanna know true pain try running a perfect flashlight(purple one with green battery and low amp fili if youre wondering btw) with a white ward and then getting hit by Franklins. and then your teammate fucking steals it
---
The people that use urban are fucking potatos
---
So, you started playing suvivor.
---
Tbh the only thing I can recommend is just be a good sportman.
---
 Sometimes the killer will down you almost instantly, other times that 4% will hit you just right.
---
Facecamps happen but god its such a powerful feeling when you rescue a survivor being camped and both make it out alive.
---
Noed, BBQ and ruin are a pain but so are many other survivor survivor perks like BL, DS and SC.
---
As long as you're enjoying the game without being toxic then you're playing it rignt.
---
Is ghost face any good?
---
I will never understand why they DC after being downed for the first time. was the expectation to not go down at all or be hooked all trial?
---
Get a good headset. So much of a difference and you will notice you can find survivors so much easier and the hatch
---
It should come back but like 50% when in dying state
---
Nice, I just reached 4 thousand shards so I‚Äôll look in the shrine fro pop goes the weasel
---
The killers like the people with urban who hate the people that use that perk are the survivors with hands
---
That's the exact place where I was bodyblocked. I was next to the chest and a claudette came and jumped fast in and out a locker and then was just standing in the way. I dont have any screenshots of this room at the moment but if you need it then let me know
---
There's toxicity because both sides argue a lot. Killers don't like Adrenaline, Survive with Friends, and Decisive Strike. Survivors don't like NoEd, face camping and tunneling. This is just a generalization, but both sides tend to BM (Bad Manners) each other a lot.
---
Damn right. Joey lookin‚Äô hella fresh in them slacks
---
Just browsing the sub seems like if you play decently then you'll do fine. I mainly just tried to repair gens and heal teammates.
---
guys no, us people who run it can NOT let the devs know. We don‚Äôt need balanced landing 2.0
---
Oh, no doubt! I know I'll pick up a survivor and get hit with DS and just roll my eyes but it's just a perk that's part of the game. Both sides do bad things
---
nahh, they probably release CL chapter and the Tome fixed.
---
I still have around 200 lmao I just don‚Äôt use them
---
I have a decent one, I was just nervous and not used to being survivor. But for those without a good headset, it's basically a must have
---
No difference to me honestly.
---
Unless it‚Äôs a spirit
---
As a spirit main
---
Nopenopenope
---
I had a stroke reading this
---
Anyones ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to use NoED, I don‚Äôt understand why you exclusively said weak killers.

I call them my ***"SWF Corrector"***

You‚Äôre not going to be able to complete challenges as fast as nolifers. Boohoo
---
Yeah, it's pretty easy to play around Decisive, just slug them. There's no solid way to play around Adrenaline. And the killers have a lot of control over your enjoyment. If you BM them or they don't like you for some reason, you can be tunneled or face camped out of the game.
---
It's not the most effective strategy tbh. It's a quick and easy catch for me

Man I dont find it scarier, I just find it cooler

Wait a fuckin second. She camped every survivor and yet there are no gens done? I found the problem here.

The main point I was trying to make was even if you're crap, you're playing right as long as you're enjoying yourself.

I can't pallet loop for shit however I can juke killers well cause they can't tell what I'm doing if I don't even know what I'm doing.

Good for you buddy. I don't see why you reply with stuff I didn't say. I have positive interactions too , and guess what - with survivors I killed too. What I see here is someone who lived being nice and that's supposed to be a wholesome lobby somehow. 
---
But hey downvote me for saying that it's not a wholesome "lobby" , only one person , that escaped , not died. 
---
And saying he is wholesome when he lived (and most likely was let go) is like saying that your tea was sweet when you added sugar to it...
---
That's true. Dead by Daylight is a crazy game, but it's one that I really enjoy whether I win or lose
---
Well congratulations! I'm glad to see you've made more than your way.
---
"Optimalzation"
---
Yeah, the only time this game still scares me is if I step on a trap before I know who the Killer is.
---
this was me 100%

The only time I've been intimidated by a p3 skin was when playing against a p3 nurse on console. I was right to be afraid

Thank you so much
